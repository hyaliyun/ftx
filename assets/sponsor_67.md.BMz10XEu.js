They were: *(1) Chicago White Sox (Central Division champion, 99–63) vs. (4) Boston Red Sox (Wild Card, 95–67): White Sox win series, 3–0. *(2) Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim (Western Division champion, 95–67) vs. (3) New York Yankees (Eastern Division champion, 95–67): Angels win series, 3–2. The higher seed (#1 is the highest) had the home field advantage. NOTE: The Yankees were designated the Eastern Division champions due to winning the season series 10–9 against the Red Sox. The Angels received home field advantage rather than the Yankees due to their winning the season series 6–4 against New York. 2005 was the first year since 2001 that the Minnesota Twins had not participated in the ALDS. Other than the White Sox' victory in the AL Central, the participants were identical to those of the previous year. The two victorious teams went on to meet in the AL Championship Series (ALCS). The victorious White Sox advanced to defeat the National League champion Houston Astros and win the 2005 World Series. Matchups =Chicago White Sox vs. Boston Red Sox= =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim vs. New York Yankees= †: Game was postponed due to rain on October 8 Chicago vs. Boston =Game 1= U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, Illinois The White Sox rocked Red Sox starter Matt Clement for five runs in the first inning. Clement hit Scott Podsednik to lead off the game. Podsednik moved to second on a groundout, then after another hit-by-pitch, stole third and scored on Paul Konerko's force out at second. Carl Everett singled before Konerko scored on Aaron Rowand's RBI single, then A.J. Pierzynski's three-run home run made it 5–0 Chicago. Konerko's home run in the third made it 6–0 White Sox. The Red Sox scored their only runs of the game in the fourth when Trot Nixon and Jason Varitek hit back-to-back singles aided by an error to put them on third and second, respectively. Jose Contreras's wild pitch scored Nixon, then Kevin Millar's double scored Varitek. Contreras went innings, giving up eight hits. In the bottom of the fourth, Juan Uribe's two-run home run extended Chicago's lead to 8–2 and forced Clement out of the game. Geremi Gonzalez allowed a leadoff walk and subsequent hit-by-pitch in the sixth. One out later, a single by Uribe scored a run, then Scott Podsednik's three-run home run made it 12–2 Chicago. Podsednik had gone homerless in the regular season and this was his first home run since September 30, 2004. In the eighth, Pierzynski's second home run of the game off of Bronson Arroyo made it 13–2 Chicago. After two walks, Willie Harris's RBI single capped the scoring at 14–2 Chicago. Cliff Politte pitched a scoreless ninth to give the White Sox a 1–0 series lead. Boston's postseason winning streak was snapped at eight games with this loss. This was the White Sox' first postseason home win since Game 1 of the 1959 World Series. =Game 2= U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago, Illinois The Red Sox struck first in Game 2 on Manny Ramirez's two-run single off of Mark Buehrle with runners on second and third. In the fourth, they loaded the bases on a single, double and intentional walk before Jason Varitek's single and Trot Nixon's groundout scored a run each. David Wells ( innings, two earned runs, seven hits) looked tough, giving up only two hits in the first four innings. But in the White Sox half of the fifth, the White Sox struck pay-dirt. Carl Everett hit a leadoff single, then scored on Aaron Rowand's double. One out later, Rowand scored on Joe Crede's single. Boston second baseman's Tony Graffanino error on Juan Uribe's ground ball put two runners on and one out later, Tadahito Iguchi's three-run home run put the White Sox up 5–4, those three runs unearned. Buehrle (seven innings, four earned runs, eight hits) earned the win with the save going to Bobby Jenks. =Game 3= Fenway Park in Boston, Massachusetts For the first time since 1993, the White Sox secured their place in the ALCS by beating the Red Sox in Game 3. Freddy García (five innings, five hits, three earned runs) faced Tim Wakefield ( innings, six hits, four runs). The White Sox struck first, when Juan Uribe doubled with two outs, then Scott Podsednik's double and Tadahito Iguchi's single scored a run each in the third. Back-to-back home runs by David Ortiz and Manny Ramirez leading off the fourth tied the game. In the sixth, Paul Konerko, with Jermaine Dye on base, hit a home run to put the White Sox in the lead for good. Ramirez's second home run of the game in the bottom of the inning cut the lead to 4–3, then Damaso Marte relieved Garcia and allowed a single and two walks to load the bases with no outs. El Duque, Orlando Hernández, came in relief and induced Jason Varitek to foul out, Tony Graffanino to pop out to short, and Johnny Damon to strike out to end the inning without giving up another run. He proceeded to pitch three total innings, giving up one hit. The White Sox got an insurance run in the ninth off of Mike Timlin when A.J. Pierzynski hit a leadoff double, moved to third on a groundout and scored on Juan Uribe's fielder's choice. Bobby Jenks retired the Red Sox in order in the bottom half, earning his second save of the series. This was the White Sox's first postseason series win since the 1917 World Series. =Composite line score= 2005 ALDS (3–0): Chicago White Sox over Boston Red Sox Los Angeles vs. New York =Game 1= Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California The Yankees were able to get to AL Cy Young Award winner Bartolo Colón early. Three two-out singles loaded the bases in the top of the first, then rookie Robinson Canó lifted a line drive over the reaching hand of left fielder Garret Anderson. The double would clear the bases, giving the Yankees a 3–0 lead. Next inning, Derek Jeter singled with two outs, moved to second on a hit-by-pitch, and scored on Jason Giambi's single. Though Colón and Scot Shields held the Yankees scoreless for the rest of the game, starter Mike Mussina pitched innings. Bengie Molina's home run in the seventh off of Tanyon Sturtze put the Angels on the board. In the ninth, Mariano Rivera walked Vladimir Guerrero with one out. After stealing second, Guerrero scored on Darin Erstad's single, but Rivera retired the next two batters to give the Yankees a 1–0 series lead. =Game 2= Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California In Game 2, the starters were John Lackey for the Angels and Chien-Ming Wang for the Yankees. The Yankees scored the first run of the game in the second when Hideki Matsui and Robinson Canó hit back- to-back doubles. They made it 2–0 in the fifth after Alex Rodríguez walked, moved to third on Jason Giambi's double and scored on Gary Sheffield's ground out. The Angels got on the board in the bottom of that inning on Juan Rivera's home run. In the sixth, Alex Rodríguez's error allowed Orlando Cabrera to make it to first base. He would move to second on Vladimir Guerrero's ground out and score on Bengie Molina's single, tying the game at two. In the next inning, Wang's throwing error would allow Jeff DaVanon and Steve Finley to reach third and second, respectively. Both scored on Cabrera's single, giving the Angels a 4–2 lead. In the eighth, Molina's home run off of Al Leiter extended the Angels lead to three. In the ninth, Jorge Posada's home run off of Francisco Rodriguez cut the lead back to two, but K. Rod retired the next three batters to end the game and tie the series heading to New York. =Game 3= Yankee Stadium (I) in the Bronx, New York In Game 3, it was Randy Johnson pitching for the Yankees while Paul Byrd pitched for the Angels. Johnson ran into trouble early, giving up a three-run home run to Garret Anderson in the first after back-to-back two-out singles and a two-run homer to Bengie Molina in the third to give the Angels a 5–0 lead. After allowing a double and single in the fourth without getting an out, Johnson was taken out of the game while being booed. The Yankees rallied in the bottom of the inning. First, Hideki Matsui homered to put the Yanks on the board 5–1. Then Robinson Canó and Bernie Williams hit back to back singles and moved one base each on a groundout. Canó scored on Jorge Posada's groundout and Williams on Derek Jeter's single. After a walk, Brendan Donnelly relieved Byrd and Jason Giambi's single scored Jeter and cut the Angels' lead to one. In the next inning, after Matsui walked, Canó doubled to left and a throwing error by Cabrera allowed Matsui to score and Canó to go to third. Scot Shields relieved Donnelly and gave up a sacrifice fly to Bernie Williams that scored Canó, giving the Yankees a 6–5 lead, but in the sixth Reliever Aaron Small allowed a one-out double to Juan Rivera before Darin Erstad's RBI single tied the game. After a strikeout and single, Chone Figgins's RBI single put the Angels back in front 7–6. Tom Gordon allowed a leadoff single and subsequent hit-by-pitch before Garret Anderson's RBI single made it 8–6 Angels. Two errors loaded the bases before Steve Finley's RBI groundout off of Al Leiter made it 9–6 Angels. In the eighth, Leiter allowed a leadoff triple, then after a one-out intentional walk, back-to-back RBI singles by José Molina and Anderson off of Scott Proctor made it 11–6 Angels. The Yankees got only one more run on Jeter's leadoff home run in the eighth off of Kelvim Escobar as the Angels' 11–7 win put them one win away from the ALCS. =Game 4= Yankee Stadium (I) in the Bronx, New York The Angels struck first in Game 4, scoring two runs in the top of the sixth on two doubles by Chone Figgins and Orlando Cabrera off Yankees starting pitcher Shawn Chacón after a leadoff walk. The Yankees cut the lead to one in the bottom of the inning when Alex Rodriguez walked, moved to second on a groundout and scored on Gary Sheffield's single off Angels starting pitcher John Lackey. In the bottom of the next inning, Robinson Canó singled and Jorge Posada walked off of Scot Shields. They would score on singles from Rubén Sierra and Derek Jeter. Al Leiter earned the win in relief and Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect eighth and ninth as the Yankees won 3–2 to force a Game 5 back in Anaheim. =Game 5= Angel Stadium of Anaheim in Anaheim, California Game 5 had the same starting pitchers as in Game 1, Bartolo Colón for the Angels and Mike Mussina for the Yankees. Colón left the game in the second inning due to a hand injury after giving up two hits in the first and was relieved by Ervin Santana, who walked Robinson Canó (who was caught out stealing), Bernie Williams, and Jorge Posada. Williams scored on Bubba Crosby's single and Posada on Derek Jeter's sacrifice fly as the Yankees took an early 2–0 lead. Mussina, however, after pitching a perfect first, allowed a leadoff home run to Garret Anderson in the second to cut the lead to one. Then, Bengie Molina singled to center. After getting two outs, Mussina walked Steve Finley before Adam Kennedy hit the ball to right center. Bubba Crosby and Gary Sheffield collided on the outfield wall trying to catch it, allowing Molina and Finley to score to give the Angels a 3–2 lead. Next inning, Mussina allowed back-to-back leadoff singles to put runners on first and third, then Anderson's sacrifice fly scored a run. After a single again put runners on first and third, Darin Erstad's RBI single extended the Angels' lead to 5–2. Mussina was pulled from the game one out later in his shortest postseason start ever. Randy Johnson, making his first postseason relief appearance since Game 7 of the 2001 World Series with the Arizona Diamondbacks against the Yankees, kept the Angels scoreless for the rest of the game, allowing just three hits. Jeter's home run in the seventh off Santana cut the lead to two. Jeter opened the ninth with a single off closer Francisco Rodríguez, but Alex Rodriguez grounded into a double play. Jason Giambi and Gary Sheffield both hit singles afterward, but Hideki Matsui grounded out to first to end the game. The Angels would face the Chicago White Sox in the ALCS. =Composite line score= 2005 ALDS (3–2): Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim over New York Yankees Notes External links *CHW vs. BOS at Baseball-Reference *LAA vs. NYY at Baseball-Reference American League Division Series American League Division Series Chicago White Sox postseason Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim postseason Boston Red Sox postseason New York Yankees postseason American League Division Series American League Division Series American League Division Series American League Division Series 21st century in Anaheim, California American League Division Series 2000s in Chicago 2005 in Illinois American League Division Series ","title":"2005 American League Division Series"},{"id":"2817302","text":"Production methods fall into three main categories: job (one-off production), batch (multiple items, one step at a time for all items), and flow (multiple items, all steps in process at once for separate items).  Job Production  Job Production is used when a product is produced with the labor of one or few workers and is rarely used for bulk and large scale production. It is mainly used for one-off products or prototypes (hence also known as Prototype Production), as it is inefficient; however, quality is greatly enhanced with job production compared to other methods. Individual wedding cakes and made- to-measure suits are examples of job production. New small firms often use job production before they get a chance or have the means to expand. Job Production is highly motivating for workers because it gives the workers an opportunity to produce the whole product and take pride in it. Batch production is the method used to produce or process any product of the groups or batches where the products in the batch go through the whole production process together. An example would be when a bakery produces each different type of bread separately and each product (in this case, bread) is not produced continuously. Batch production is used in many different ways and is most suited to when there is a need for a quality/quantity balance. This technique is probably the most commonly used method for organizing manufacture and promotes specialist labor, as very often batch production involves a small number of persons. Batch production occurs when many similar items are produced together. Each batch goes through one stage of the production before moving onto the next stage.  Flow Production  Flow production (Process Production) is also a very common method of production. Flow production is when the product is built up through many segregated stages; the product is built upon at each stage and then passed directly to the next stage where it is built upon again. The production method is financially the most efficient and effective because there is less of a need for skilled workers.  Lean Production  Contrary to job production, the method Boutique Manufacturing (Lean) is suitable for the production of very small to small batches, i.e. orders of a few units up to several dozens of similar or equal goods. The workflow organization of a Boutique Manufacturing entity can be a mixture of both jobbing and batch production but involves higher standardization than job production. Boutique Manufacturing is often organized with single workplaces or production cells carrying out a number of subsequent production steps until completion of certain components or even the whole product; large assembly lines are generally not used. The flexibility and variety of products able to be produced in the entity therefore are much higher than with the more standardized method of batch production.

Sexual recording  A woman named Adriana Smith, Guns N' Roses groupie and stripper at the time, had been with drummer Steven Adler for around a year. Smith later claimed in a TV interview that, after Adler insisted that she was not his girlfriend, she went to the mixing sessions at Mediasound Studios in NYC. Rose and Slash were there. Rose propositioned Smith that they have sex in a vocal booth so that the sounds that Smith made could be recorded and put over the bridge of the song. Smith replied that she would do it, \\"For the band, and a bottle of Jack Daniel's\\". Steve Thompson, an engineer of the album, said: Another engineer, Michael Barbiero, did not want to record the sex session, so he set up the microphones and left the task to his assistant, Vic Deyglio. Deyglio said the studio was \\"like a Ron Jeremy set\\", and he even had to enter the booth to adjust a microphone which Rose and Smith had crashed into. The Appetite for Destruction liner notes jokingly acknowledge Deyglio's contribution by crediting him as \\"Victor 'the fucking engineer' Deglio\\". It was later stated in the music magazine Classic Rock, as well as Rolling Stone, that the person who had been recorded performing sex noises on the song was indeed Adriana Smith, an on-off girlfriend of drummer Steven Adler. She also allegedly had an intimate relationship with frontman Rose. Smith revealed in an interview that Adler \\"freaked out\\" when he discovered about the recorded sex session, and she spent some years using alcohol and drugs \\"because I had this extreme shame and guilt and stuff.\\" Smith also later said in The Girls Behind Guns N’ Roses: However, further revelations could indicate that Smith and Rose have not been the only people recorded for the song. Mike Clink, longtime producer of the band, said: \\"The guys were taking turns fucking this girl in the studio. Those are actual sounds of sex, captured live on tape.\\" Furthermore, a former Geffen employee claimed that Rose had sex several times with two or three girls on tape, unhappy with the results.  Structure  The song contains two separate, distinct phases joined together by a bridge. The first of these is in a format of verse, chorus, verse, chorus and is accompanied by lyrical bravado. There is also an instrumental section in the latter part of the first phase during which the sexual recording is also played. The second phase of the song has no chorus and contains lyrics of affection and love in contrast to the bravado of the lyrics in the first phase of the song. The lyrics continue into the coda before the climax of the song (the conclusion of the song is not a fade out).  Live  * \\"Rocket Queen\\" made its live debut at The Troubadour in West Hollywood in September 1985 and has since been performed by every live incarnation of Guns N' Roses up to 2016. * Steven Adler would take a drum solo in the middle of the song while the band was supporting Appetite For Destruction in 1988, which expanded to include Duff McKagan on an additional drum kit and Axl Rose playing bass when the band opened four dates for The Rolling Stones in 1989 at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. * In 1991, Axl Rose stage dived into the audience during \\"Rocket Queen\\" to confiscate a camera that had been brought in by an attendee, and after failing to do so, canceled the remainder of the show in St. Louis, Missouri. The crowd vandalized the arena and surrounding property, leading to a riot and the eventual arrest of Axl Rose. * Slash has been regularly performing the song with Myles Kennedy while supporting his solo project since 2010.

He worked in the fields of formal language, combinatorics, and information theory.Herbert Wilf, Dominique Foata, et al., \\"In Memoriam: Marcel-Paul Schützenberger, 1920-1996 ,\\" Electronic Journal of Combinatorics, served from University of Pennsylvania Dept. of Mathematics Server, article dated 12 October 1996, retrieved from WWW on 4 November 2006. In addition to his formal results in mathematics, he was \\"deeply involved in [a] struggle against the votaries of [neo-]Darwinism\\",Foata, Dominique, \\"In Memoriam,\\" op. cit. a stance which has resulted in some mixed reactions from his peers and from critics of his stance on evolution. Several notable theorems and objects in mathematics as well as computer science bear his name (for example Schutzenberger group or the Chomsky–Schützenberger hierarchy). Paul Schützenberger was his great- grandfather. In the late 1940s, he was briefly married to the psychologist Anne Ancelin Schützenberger. Contributions to medicine and biology Schützenberger's first doctorate, in medicine, was awarded in 1948 from the Faculté de Médecine de Paris.Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul, Contribution à l'étude statistique du sexe à la naissance, Doctoral thesis, Faculté de Médecine de Paris, 2 July 1948. His doctoral thesis, on the statistical study of biological sex at birth, was distinguished by the Baron Larrey Prize from the French Academy of Medicine.Besson, Jaques, \\"La quête de M. P. Schützenberger en Médecine et Biologie,\\" dated March 2001, retrieved on 5 November 2006.

R. Acad. Sci. Paris, No. 268, pp. 1342–1344, 1969. while noting that Schützenberger is perhaps most remembered for work in pure mathematical fields, credits him for likely being responsible for the introduction of statistical sequential analysis in French hospital practice.Schützenberger, Marcel-Parul, \\"Une application de l'analyse séquentielle,\\" Semaine des Hôpitaux de Paris, Vol. 25 No. 60, pp. 2562–2564, 14 August 1949.

His later impact in both linguistics and combinatorics is reflected by two theorems in formal linguistics (the Chomsky–Schützenberger enumeration theoremChomsky, Noam & Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul \\"The Algebraic Theory of Context-Free Languages\\", in Computer Programming and Formal Systems, P. Braffort and D. Hirschberg (eds.), North Holland, pp. 118-161, 1963. and the Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem), and one in combinatorics (the Schützenberger theorem). With Alain Lascoux, Schützenberger is credited with the foundation of the notion of the plactic monoid,Lascoux, Alain & Schützenberger, Marcel-Paul, \\"Le monoïde plaxique,\\" in Noncommutative structures in algebra and geometric combinatorics (Naples, 1978), volume 109 of Quad. Ricerca Sci., pp. 129–156, CNR, Rome, Italy, 1981. reflected in the name of the combinatorial structure called by some the Lascoux–Schützenberger tree.

It was released in Japan, on December 15, 2005, in North America on February 14, 2006, in Australia on March 30, 2006, and in Europe on March 31, 2006. A version for Xbox Live Arcade was released on October 24, 2007. A version for the Nintendo DS was released in 2008 as Exit DS. Overview The basic premise is to lead the main character Mr. ESC, an escapologist, out of hospitals, underground facilities, offices and other buildings within a time limit. Along the way, the player gets hindered by obstacles such as fires, earthquakes, floods, or even meteor showers. Sometimes the player must help trapped individuals escape as well, and it will take quick thinking and planning ahead to exit the building successfully. Characters *Mr. ESC: A very professional escape artist with an eye for coffee like nobody's business. *Jet: What may be considered as a \\"villain\\", but is not much more than a rival escapologist with a jetpack. Only appears if you bring your companions to their doom or run out of time. *Companions: Several people throughout the scenarios of which you have to escape. May it be children, young adults, fat adults, or patients. Gameplay Each level includes a starting point for Mr. ESC and an exit point. There may also be one or more trapped individuals within the level, and in many cases, Mr. ESC cannot successfully complete the level unless he rescues some or all of the individuals before he escapes. There is a time limit for completing each level. Mr. ESC is rather agile, and can swim, run faster, and jump higher, more than any of the other trapped individuals. However, he is still prone to injury from hazards or from falling off of too high heights. The individuals come in four types: *Youngs - These normal-sized people can climb over moderate height obstacles, can jump, and can also assist each other or Mr. ESC in various tasks. *Children - Children can only climb over small heights but can be assisted by Mr. ESC or a normal adult. They cannot jump as far as adults, but can traverse passages too small for Mr. ESC or other adults. *Adults - These waddling large-sized people can push very large objects, but cannot climb over moderate obstacles without help from at least two people (MR. ESC and another adult, or two adults). *Patients - Injured people must be either carried by Mr. ESC or an adult to the exit, or, if a stretcher is available, wheeled to the exit. Mr. ESC (the figure with the red tie) carries an injured person down stairs while another adult waits nearby in a collapsing building. Image from the Xbox Live Arcade version. Except for the injured, the player as Mr. ESC can order these people to perform certain tasks, move to specific locations, or pick up, use, or trade tools on the level; however, until Mr. ESC has touched them, they remain in a panicked state and cannot help. These individuals will not willfully put themselves in a bad situation (they will refuse to make a drop they could not survive, for example), but they can still be injured from an indirect event (dropping a crate on them, for example). If a survivor is injured, they are carried to safety by Jet (a competitor of Mr. ESC). If too many survivors are injured to be able to meet the requirement, or if Mr. ESC himself is injured, the level is over and must be restarted. Obstacles include crates which can be used to create platforms to reach higher ledges, fires that must be extinguished before they can be passed, water hazards which only Mr. ESC can swim in, one-way doors, fallen rock walls, exposed electrical wires, and more. Some tools can be used to remove the obstacle (such as a fire extinguisher to dose a fire or a pick-axe to clear rubble). There are some levels that are dark, and a flashlight is needed to see even part of an area of the level. After completing a level, a score is given based on the number of people rescued, and the par time for the level. 100 points are possible for each level. There are a total of 100 different levels, which are designed to appeal to the pick-up-and-play qualities of the PSP. 70 stages are available from the start, and the player can then play through them in any order. A player can repeat the level later to try and beat their previous high score. In addition to the packaged levels, 100 more are available for download off the game's website utilizing the PSP's on-board network functionality. The Xbox Live Arcade version has a total of 220 levels. Reception The PSP and Xbox 360 versions received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the DS version received \\"mixed\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. In Japan, Famitsu gave the PSP version a score of two nines and two eights for a total of 34 out of 40. The same magazine later gave the DS version one nine and three eights for a total of 33 out of 40. Charles Herold of The New York Times gave the PSP version a favorable review, saying it was \\"tremendous fun for fans of logic puzzles, but it has a few annoying quirks. Jumping large gaps in the floor is tricky, and I died far too often doing this. The process for giving commands to other people is a bit cumbersome.\\" Detroit Free Press gave it three stars out of four, saying that it \\"has enough substance to keep you playing for hours and hours.\\" 411Mania gave the DS version a score of 7.5 out of 10, calling it \\"a pretty simple game with a simple premise but it's hard to master and get down to a science.\\" However, The Sydney Morning Herald gave the PSP version three stars out of five, calling it \\"A good mental workout that can prove to be addictive, despite its punishing quirks.\\" Sequel In late June 2006, Famitsu revealed that Taito was working on a sequel to Exit titled Kangaeru Exit, released elsewhere as Exit 2. It was released in September 2006; a demo of the sequel was released for download in Japan in November 2006. Eventually the game was released for the Xbox Live Arcade on February 25, 2009.

It is known from several skeletons and bonebed material from the Judith River Formation of Montana and the Oldman Formation of Alberta, living about 78 million years ago. Discovery and later finds Skull cast of the holotype Brachylophosaurus was first named and described by Charles Mortram Sternberg in 1953 for a skull and partial skeleton, holotype NMC 8893, which he had found in 1936 near Steveville in Alberta, and which was at first thought to belong to Gryposaurus (or Kritosaurus as it was known at the time). The type species is Brachylophosaurus canadensis. The generic name is derived from Greek βραχύς, brachys, \\"short\\", and λόφος, lophos, \\"crest of a helmet\\". The specific name refers to the provenance from Canada. Later, it was recognised that specimen FMNH PR 862, a partial skull discovered in 1922, could also be referred to B. canadensis. The type specimen was uncovered in a layer of the middle Oldman Formation dating from about 78 million years ago. Specimen MOR 940 seen from above The holotype remained the only described and recognised specimen of the genus until the 1980s, when Jack Horner described a second species, Brachylophosaurus goodwini, in 1988. The specific name honours preparator and collector Mark Goodwin. This species was based on a partial skull and skeleton, specimen UCMP 130139 found in the Judith River Formation of Montana, at the Skull Crest. However, in 2005 a study by Albert Prieto-Márquez concluded that the perceived differences between the two species were either due to individual variation or the result of UCMP 130139 having been reconstructed with an upside down skull crest. B. goodwini would have been a junior synonym of B. canadensis. A further Canadian find was specimen TMP 1990.104.0001, a partial skeleton with skull in 1990 discovered at Milk River in Alberta and collected by Tyrrell staffer Darren Tanke and crew. Brachylophosaurus has subsequently become better known from fossils found in Montana than Alberta, however, despite its specific name canadensis. These include specimens MOR 720, a braincase; MOR 794, a very complete skeleton with skull of an adult individual; and MOR 940, another braincase. Near Malta, Montana an entire bonebed of Brachylophosaurus fossils has been uncovered containing over eight hundred specimens, that have been catalogued under number MOR 1071. Fossil nicknamed Roberta In 1994 at Malta in Phillips County, amateur paleontologist Nate Murphy discovered a complete and uncrushed Brachylophosaurus skeleton which he nicknamed \\"Elvis\\". Subsequently, even more informative finds were made by Murphy and his team from the Judith River Dinosaur Institute. On 20 July 2000, specimen JRF 115H or \\"Leonardo\\", a fully articulated and partially \\"mummified\\" skeleton of a subadult Brachylophosaurus, was discovered by Dan Stephenson. It is considered one of the most spectacular dinosaur finds ever, and was included in the Guinness Book of World Records. They subsequently excavated \\"Roberta\\", an almost complete gracile skeleton, and \\"Peanut\\", a partially preserved juvenile with some skin impressions. \\"Peanut\\" was discovered in 2002 by Robert E. Buresh and is on display at the Institute in Malta, MT. In May 2008, Steven Cowan, public-relations coordinator at the Houston Museum of Natural Science, discovered a Brachylophosaurus skeleton subsequently dubbed \\"Marco\\" from the same area as Leonardo. Description =Size and general build= Size comparison Brachylophosaurus is notable for its bony crest, which forms a horizontally flat, paddle-like plate over the top of the rear skull.\\"Brachylophosaurus.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 134. . Some individuals, depending on their age, had crests that covered nearly the entire skull roof, while others had shorter, narrower crests. Some researchers have suggested it was used for pushing contests, but it may not have been strong enough for this. Other notable features are a relatively small head, the unusually long lower arms and the beak of the upper jaw being wider than with other contemporary hadrosaurs. Apart from the above, Brachylophosaurus was a typical hadrosaur which reached an adult length of at least . In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated maximum length at resulting in weight of .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 304 Like other hadrosaurs, Brachylophosaurus possessed features like cheeks to keep fodder in the mouth and dental batteries consisting of hundreds of stacked teeth. These teeth could be used to chew efficiently, a feature rare among reptiles, but common among some cerapodan ornithischian dinosaurs like Brachylophosaurus. =Distinguishing traits= Restoration In 2015, Jack Horner established some distinguishing traits. Two of these are autapomorphies, unique derived characters. The crest formed by the nasal bones is flat and paddle-shaped in adult individuals and largely or totally overhangs the supratemporal fenestrae. The rear edge of the prefrontal bone overgrowths the frontal bone and more to the rear is oriented inwards and downwards to support the base of the crest and contribute to the edge of the supratemporal fenestra. Additionally, there is one trait that is not unique in itself but forms a unique combination with the two autapomorphies: the front branch of the lacrimal bone is extremely elongated and with its tip only touches the maxillary bone.Fowler, Elizabeth A. Freedman, and John R. Horner. \\"A New Brachylophosaurin Hadrosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithischia) with an Intermediate Nasal Crest from the Campanian Judith River Formation of Northcentral Montana.\\" PLOS One 10.11 (2015): e0141304. =Skeleton= Partial tail with tendons The head of Brachylophosaurus is elongated. It is wide at the rear and very narrow along most of the length of the snout. The upper beak however, abruptly widens at its rear edge, forming a broad bone core for a horn sheath. The nostrils are extremely large and between them the nasal bones form a narrow tall bone wall on top of much of the snout. More to behind the nasal bones stretch out horizontally, creating a flat tongue-shaped skull crest that overgrowths and ultimately overhangs, most of the skull roof. The crest is not hollow but consists of massive bone. The crest has a low longitudinal ridge on the midline. The maxilla, the tooth-bearing upper jaw bone, is rather elongated in front. Its tooth positions increase during the lifetime of the animal, ranging from thirty-three in younger individuals to forty-eight in the holotype specimen. The teeth are stacked in a tooth battery, with up to three teeth per position. The battery forms a sharp cutting edge, bending inwards, with one or sometimes two teeth per position contributing to the attrition surface. More to behind, the lower jugal bones and quadrate bones flare out sidewards, so that the skull is much wider at its rear lower edges than at the top surface, resulting in a trapezium-shaped profile in posterior view. =Soft tissues= Underside of \\"Leonardo\\"'s head and neck, showing skin impressions Several so-called \\"mummies\\" provide information about the soft tissues of Brachylophosaurus. These \\"mummies\\" actually consist of natural casts formed in moulds in the stone matrix surrounding the skeleton, preserving the outline of the body and showing skin imprints. The best studied \\"mummy\\" has been \\"Leonardo\\", a specimen 90% of the cast surface of which is covered by imprints. Generally, the surface is close to the bones, which could be caused by desiccation before burial or the compressive action of the covering sediment. An exception is the region around the right shoulder, which shows the profile of about six centimetres thick muscles. \\"Leonardo\\" also indicates that the base of the neck was heavily muscled and that the soft tissue upper neck profile was placed in an elevated position, running much higher than was usually reconstructed in drawings which tended to follow the curvature of the vertebral column, and filling much of the bend between the front back and the head. On the snout, the remains of a broad keratinous beak are visible. The skin impressions show many folds and a structure of small polygonal scales. On the back a midline frill formed by triangular or hatchet-shaped projections is present. These seem to be individually separated and are placed as extensions of each neural spine of the vertebral column. The second, third and fourth finger of the hand are contained in a shared soft tissue \\"mitten\\". Examination of the stomach of \\"Leonardo\\" also reveals that the dinosaur was parasitized by small, needle- like worms covered in fine bristles. The discovery indicates that other dinosaur species might have been hosts of similar parasites.http://www.eartharchives.org/sharebars/409 Classification The following cladogram of hadrosaurid relationships was published in 2013 by Alberto Prieto-Márquez et al.: Premaxilla (A), compared to that of other saurolophines Paleobiology Teeth (F) In 2003, evidence of tumors, including hemangiomas, desmoplastic fibroma, metastatic cancer, and osteoblastoma was discovered in fossilized Brachylophosaurus skeletons. Rothschild et al. tested dinosaur vertebrae for tumors using computerized tomography and fluoroscope screening. Several other hadrosaurids, including Edmontosaurus, Gilmoreosaurus, and Bactrosaurus, also tested positive. Although more than 10,000 fossils were examined in this manner, the tumors were limited to Brachylophosaurus and closely related genera. The tumors may have been caused by environmental factors or genetic propensity. =Diet= A 2008 study conducted on the famous Leonardo found that Brachylophosaurus had a diet that consisted of leaves, conifers, ferns, and flowering plants. The study also found that Brachylophosaurus was a browser and a grazer, but did more of the former rather than the latter. Paleoecology Some of the less common hadrosaurs in the Dinosaur Park Formation of Dinosaur Provincial Park like Brachylophosaurus may represent the remains of individuals who died while migrating through the region. They might also have had a more upland habitat where they may have nested or fed.Tanke, D.H. and Brett-Surman, M.K. 2001.

It has rough, fibrous or string bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to egg-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of seven or nine, white to lemon-yellow flowers and conical fruit. It grows in forests near the coast of Queensland and New South Wales. Description Eucalyptus microcorys is a tree that typically grows to a height of , occasionally to and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous or stringy brownish bark on the trunk and branches. Young plants and coppice regrowth have egg-shaped leaves that are paler on the lower surface, long and wide. Adult leaves are glossy green, paler on the lower surface, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or slightly curved, long and wide on a petiole long. The leaf veins are prominent, well-spaced and at an angle greater than 45° to the leaf mid-rib. The flower buds are usually arranged at the ends of the branchlets, on a branched peduncle in groups of seven or nine, the peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are club- shaped, yellow, long and about wide with a rounded operculum. Flowering occurs between August and January and the flowers are white to lemon-yellow. The fruit is a woody conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level.Boland et al. Forest Trees of Australia. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus microcorys was first formally described in 1860 by Ferdinand von Mueller in Fragmenta Phytographiae Australiae from specimens collected by Hermann Beckler near the Hastings and Macleay Rivers. The specific epithet (microcorys) is from the ancient Greek micro- meaning \\"small\\" and corys meaning \\"helmet\\". Distribution and habitat Tallowwood mainly grows in tall open forest on fertile soil on slopes and ridges and in valleys. It is found from Fraser Island in Queensland, south to Cooranbong in New South Wales and as far inland as Toowomba.

It houses the city council, the city's administration and various other municipal organisations. The building as it stands today was constructed between 1931 and 1950, with an interruption during the Second World War. It was designed by architects Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson. The building is located in the city center, in the northern part of the Pipervika neighbourhood, and it faces Oslofjord. Oslo City Hall is built of red brick and has two towers, one 63 meters tall and other 66 meters tall. The bricks used are larger than what was typical at the time of construction, but are roughly the same size as bricks used in the Middle Ages. The bricks - measuring approximately 27,5 x 13 x 8,5 cm - were produced by Hovin Teglverk in Oslo. The eastern tower has a set of 49 bells. Various events and ceremonies take place in the building, including the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony which takes place every December. Earlier City Halls =Middle ages= It appears that in the Middle Ages, various different buildings had the function of a city hall. One source suggests that one of those buildings had a wine cellar which was open to the public. =Gamle rådhus= Gamle rådhus, Oslo's former City Hall In 1624, all of old Oslo burnt to the ground. King Christian IV decided that the city should not be rebuilt at the same location and instead be built to the north of Akershus Fortress. The new city had wide streets at right angles. Building space for a town hall was made available between Rådhusgaten and Øvre Slottsgate. What is today referred to as the old City Hall (Gamle rådhus) was finished in 1641. The building still exists at Nedre Slottsgate 1. The building fell into decay and by 1733 a building at Rådhusgaten 7 was selected to be a new City Hall. By the 1800s the building was too small and the growing administration moved to various premises across the city. Architectural competitions were held in 1876 and 1898 for a new building at Hammersborg, but the plans were never carried out due to a lack of funds. Modern-day City Hall  =History= The idea of building a new city hall in Pipervika was first suggested by architect Oscar Hoff in 1906, but nothing came of the plans. In 1915, the idea was taken up by Hieronymus Heyerdahl, who had just stood down as mayor. He noticed the city's lack of a representative city hall to receive the municipality's guests during the 1914 Jubilee Exhibition in Frogner. He set up an architectural competition which received a total of 44 entries in the first of two rounds. In 1918 Arnstein Arneberg and Magnus Poulsson were selected as winners, whose project was clearly inspired by Stockholm City Hall. A continuned lack of funds meant that construction had to wait, and in the intervening years the architects made several changes to the project. In 1930 they present their final draft, which had undergone significant changes, influenced by functionalism. The most apparent change was the addition of two office towers. The ground stone laying ceremony took place in September 1931, with King Haakon VII and Crown Prince Olav in attendance. Actual construction began in February 1933. Various buildings were also torn down. The city's old amusement park - Tivoli - was also forced to close as a new zoning plan created new plots of land for sale. The purpose was to raise funds for the construction of the building. In November 1936 the shell of the building was completed. A few floors of office space were in use by the time war broke out in 1940. Construction resumed after the war and the office space was in use by 1947, while final touches were still being added. Oslo City Hall was officially opened on 15 May 1950, as part of the city's 900-year anniversary. Three musical compositions were written in connection with the celebrations, written by Ludvig Irgens-Jensen, Eivind Groven and Karl Andersen. By the time it opened in 1950, the style of the building was no longer popular. Brick was in stark contrast to the steel and glass which architects considered modern at the time, and no further buildings were built in that style afterwards. Stockholm's city hall - also in brick - had been designed by Ragnar Östberg, and Martin Nyrop designed Copenhagen City Hall, which is also a monumental brick building. Both Nyrop and Östberg were on the jury which selected the winning design of Oslo City Hall. =Decoration= Various contests were held to decide who would decorate City Hall in January 1937. In all, eight painters and 17 sculptors were hired. Most of the work was completed by the opening of the hall in 1950, though the sculpture park was not completed until the 1960s. =Exterior= The western wall of the building is dominated by Anne Grimdalen's sculpture of Harald Hardråde on horseback. Nic Schiøll's sculpture of St. Hallvard is at the front of the building, facing Oslofjord. Reliefs by Dagfin Werenskiold face the square and are multicoloured depictions of motifs from the Poetic Edda. Joseph Grimeland designed the bronze relief over the entrance and also the Oslopike (\\"Oslo girl\\") high up on the wall. Six free-standing sculptures by Per Palle Storm in front of the building depict the craftsmen who built the building. =Main Hall= The building's main hall was decorated by Henrik Sørensen and Alf Rolfsen. The Hall is 31 metres wide, 39 metres long and around 21 metres high. The floor and parts of the walls are clad in marble. The room has a series of wall paintings depicting Norway and Oslo between the wars and also during occupation. They also depict the growth of commercial activity in the city, including the rise of the labour movement. Various monarchs and the city's patron saint, St. Hallvard are also depicted. =City Council Hall= The room in which the City Council meets (Bystyresalen) is semi-circular. It is clad in oak and tapestries, the most noticeable of which was designed by Else Poulsson, the niece of the architect. Woven by Else Halling, it depicts St. Hallvard and the seven virtues. The artist hoped the design would remind the city's politicians of ethics and good decisionmaking. Nobel Peace Prize ceremony On December 10 (anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death) each year, Oslo City Hall hosts the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in which the annual laureate gives his or her lecture and is awarded the medal and diploma. A podium for the laureate and the Nobel Committee is erected in the far end of the hall for each ceremony. The Norwegian Royal Family and Prime Minister are attendants.

It has been the home ground of Port Vale F.C. since 1950. The ground has seen its capacity go up and down, its peak being 42,000 in February 1954 against Blackpool, although a club record 49,768 managed to squeeze in for a 1960 FA Cup fifth round fixture against Aston Villa. It now has a notional capacity of just over 19,000, though has rarely seen more than 10,000 spectators since major restructuring to make the stadium an all-seater venue in the 1990s. Overview At 520 feet above sea level it is the eleventh highest ground in the country, and third highest in the English Football League. The pitch is clay underneath the grass, rather than sand. These two factors make the pitch vulnerable to freezing temperatures. There is also a coal seam under the pitch, and numerous mine shafts dotted around the local area, including many under the park opposite the ground. The Vale Park pitch is one of the widest in the Football League. The pitch was originally laid over a filled-in marl hole and does not have a subsoil structure so is liable to flooding as it lacks proper drainage; a complete re-laying of the pitch would be needed to fix the issue (the club were quoted £450,000 for this work in 2014). The head groundsman since September 1992 is Steve Speed. He was one of three groundsmen nominated for the League Two Groundsmen of the Year award in 2009. Denis Dawson was head groundsman from 1966 to 1975; he succeeded Len Parton and was followed by Graham Mainwaring. History 1950–2010. Following the club being informed that they would be evicted from The Old Recreation Ground by Stoke-on-Trent City Council, plans for a new stadium in a new area began to be made. In 1944 Hamil Road – the site of a former clay pit – was chosen, a site opposite Burslem Park, where the club had played its football in the early years of its existence. The development became known as The Wembley of the North due to the planned size of the stadium, plans which included an 80,000 capacity with room for 1,000 parked cars. The club's leadership had not allowed the club's third tier status or their lack of money to curb their ambition. Life-time seats were sold for £100 (the price of admission for roughly 200 matches) but fewer than 100 fans bought them. Also costing £100, the pitch was the most expensive ever laid in the country at the time. The ground opened in 1950 having eventually cost £50,000, and boasting a capacity of 40,000 (360 seated). The original ground consisted of just two stands, the Railway stand and the Lorne Street main stand, with banks of terracing at the Bycars and Hamil ends of the ground. The Bycars end was originally the Swan Passage stand from the Old Recreation Ground, which was taken apart, moved acros the city and re-erected as the funds for an entirely new stand had ran out. The first match was a 1–0 victory over Newport County on 24 August 1950 in front of 30,196 rain-soaked spectators. Walter Aveyard took the honour of being the first to score at the ground. On the same day the stadium's name was revealed for the first time – Vale Park. Vale Park initially had problems with drainage, causing many games of the 1950–51 season to be postponed. The problem was finally resolved in summer 1960, when new drains were installed to help ease the winter mud spots. In summer 1951, 578 seats were installed on the Railway Terrace, bringing the seated capacity of Vale Park to 1,010. In 1954 the Railway Stand was built, as capacity gradually increased to 50,000 by the end of the decade. On 24 September 1958, Vale Park saw its first match under the new £17,000 floodlights, as the club beat West Bromwich Albion 5–3. In summer 1973, the club erected a 2.5 feet high steel fence around the Bycars End to help combat hooliganism. A rare event occurred on 17 January 1976, when the Vale directors permitted rivals Stoke to play a home game against Middlesbrough at Vale Park. This happened because a severe gale severely damaged the Victoria Ground, whilst the gale also caused £2,000 worth of damage to Vale Park, the damage to Stoke's ground was much more severe. A crowd of 21,009 saw Stoke win 1–0. In summer 1985 new safety regulations reduced Vale Park's capacity down to 16,800, and later again to 16,300. The summer of 1988 saw Vale Park given a £40,000 upgrade to repair the floodlights and a £20,000 electronic scoreboard was installed at the Hamil End. Three executive boxes were also purchased from Newcastle United, whilst facilities were opened to the local community. The following year the stadium was upgraded at a cost of £250,000, though grants helped to halve the cost for the club itself. In November 1989 a £100,000 disabled stand was installed –the first purpose built enclosure of its kind in the country. Despite this effort, inspectors closed the Bycars End down due to safety issues, and reduced the stadium's capacity to 12,000 after cutting the capacity of the Railway Paddock by two-thirds. In summer 1990, 3,750 yellow and white seats were fitted in the Railway Paddock, and 1,121 seats were added to the upper tier of the Bycars End. The Bycars End roof was also removed for safety reasons, whilst a police box was constructed between the Railway Paddock and the Hamil End. The paddock at the front of the Railway Stand was later made into an all-seated area, with just the Lorne Street side left as a standing area. Vale fans stood for the last time on Lorne Street at the end of the 1997–98 season, with the stand being demolished before work began on a new £3 million structure. Work has yet to be finished on this, due to lack of finances and a change in ownership of the club. Despite the building work remaining uncompleted, the work done on the stadium under Bill Bell from 1985 had vastly improved the ground, as proven by the fact that sheep were once housed in the Railway Paddock toilets and allowed to graze on the pitch in the night; the toilets were notoriously unhygienic, and were replaced under Bill Bratt's reign in 2006. The Valiant 2001 Charter stated that Bratt's management team would invest £400,000 to install under-soil heating in mid-2002, and to also quickly complete the Lorne Street stand. However it took until 2020 for the seats to be installed. Chairman Norman Smurthwaite separated Vale Park from Port Vale after taking the club out of administration in 2012. New high-tech floodlights were fitted in March 2019, paid for by the club's shirt sponsor. The stadium's ownership was returned to the club after Smurthwaite sold the club to Carol and Kevin Shanahan in May 2019. Five months later it was declared an \\"asset of community value status\\" by Stoke-on-Trent city council. Structure and facilities The Away Stand. The current stadium holds 19,052 supporters and has four stands: Lorne Street opposite to the Railway Paddock, and the Bycars End facing the Hamil Road End. The Lorne Street Stand is relatively new, seating 5,000 when complete (2,500 before completion), with 48 executive boxes. It was not completed when it opened, however 1,500 seats were installed in the lorne street stand in April 2020. At the time of the stadium's construction it was intended to be the grandstand. It contains the stadium's main entrance, dressing rooms, club offices and enterprise centre. The away stand has a capacity of 4,500. It holds the electronic scoreboard. Other events On 1 August 1981, Vale Park hosted a one-off rock concert, dubbed 'Heavy Metal Holocaust', featuring Motörhead, Ozzy Osbourne Band, Mahogany Rush, Triumph, Riot and Vardis. Around 20,000 attended the concert, raising £25,000 for the club. Lars Ulrich was also in attendance, months before he co-founded Metallica. In 1985, the Stoke Spitfires American football team used the ground for matches. The stadium has hosted three England under-18 games. The first was a 7–2 win over Switzerland in November 1992 (which saw a Robbie Fowler hat-trick); the second was a 1–1 draw with Romania in September 1993; and the third was a goalless draw with Norway in June 2005. It also hosted a full international women's match on 7 April 2017, when England played Italy. Records A club record 49,768 attended a 1960 FA Cup fifth round fixture against Aston Villa. Other historic matches include the defeat of two reigning FA Cup champions in the competition, as Stanley Matthews' Blackpool were beaten 2–0 in February 1954, and then 42 years later holders Everton were dumped out 2–1. The biggest victory in a competitive match came in December 1958 when Gateshead were beaten 8–0.

A tireless worker, he was in charge of designing buildings and religious buildings of great value. Hired by the Serenissima as a military architect, he designed also numerous fortifications in the extensive Venetian Empire, thus ensuring a great reputation. In fact, not only in Italy, where you can find his works in Venice, Verona, Bergamo and Brescia, he worked also in Dalmatia, Zadar (Zara), Šibenik, Crete and Corfu. He was probably the only practicing Venetian architect of the sixteenth century to have had the opportunity to study Greek architecture, a possible source of inspiration for the use of Doric columns without bases. Biography Sanmicheli was born in San Michele, a quarter of Verona, which at the time was part of the Venetian Terra ferma. He learnt the elements of his profession from his father Giovanni and his uncle Bartolomeo, who both practised successfully as builder- architects in Verona. Like Jacopo Sansovino he was a salaried official of the Republic of Venice, but unlike Sansovino, his commissions lay in Venetian territories outside Venice; he was no less distinguished as a military architect, and was employed in strengthening Venetian fortifications in several cities of Crete and most notably Candia, Dalmatia and Corfu as well as a great fort at the Lido, guarding the sea entrance to the Venetian lagoon. He went at an early age to Rome, probably to work as an assistant to Antonio da Sangallo the Elder, where he had opportunities to study classic sculpture and architecture. In 1509 he went to Orvieto where he practiced for the next two decades. Among his earliest works are the first design of the duomo of Montefiascone, initiated in 1519, an octagonal building surmounted with a dome,The Montefiascone duomo was not completed until 1843. The great dome is not Sanmicheli's; it was designed by Carlo Fontana towards the end of the 17th century but left unfinished for more than a century; the Neoclassical façade and the campanili are 19th-century. and the church of Santa Maria delle Grazie, he designed and built the funerary chapel for the Petrucci family in the Gothic church of San Domenico in Orvieto. Several palazzi at both places are attributed to him. Sanmicheli was in Verona by 1527 at the latest, working on the monumental cannon-resistant city gates; he began to transform the fortifications of Verona according to the newer system of corner bastions, a system for the advancement of which he did much valuable service. Sanmicheli built two massively fortified and richly decorated city gates for Verona, the Porta Nuova and the Porta Palio, in which the richest possible Roman Doric is superimposed against layers of rustication. Giorgio Vasari's impression was that \\"in these two gates it may truly be seen that the Venetian Senate made full use of the architect's powers and equalled the buildings and works of the ancient RomansQuoted in Murray, p. 180. – the constant aim and ultimate goal of the Renaissance architects. He also regularised the Piazza Brà, opening up a vista to the Arena. Works Palazzo Roncale at Rovigo Palazzo Bevilacqua, in Verona: a richly-detailed bay of the piano nobile He found time to spare from his official commissions to build three palazzi in Verona that have been central to his reputation, though documentation has proved elusive. These are: *Palazzo Pompei (probably begun around 1530) is an enriched version of Bramante's House of Raphael. The entrance has been moved to the center of a seven-bay façadeIn Bramante's House of Raphael, the ground floor was given over to premises for shops. and given a slightly wider central bay; in order to prevent the composition from rifting apart, the corner columns of the outermost bays are stressed by being doubled with square pilasters. *Palazzo Canossa (under construction in 1537), with another seven-bay front, has a triple-arched central entrance in a high rusticated basement that is pierced by low mezzanine windows. In the piano nobile arch-headed windows are framed by doubled pilasters, so that each bay reads as a unit complete in itself, while the arch imposts are emphasized by a moulding that appears to run continuously behind the pilasters, to tie together the sequence of bays. There is a second mezzanine above the piano nobile, under a powerfully projecting cornice capped with a balustrade, with a skyline of figural sculptures. Strong mouldings continue the imposts of the arched openings and windows. The palazzo wraps round a three-sided court open to the Adige on the fourth side. *Palazzo Bevilacqua (under construction in 1529), the most famous of the three and often cited as an exemplar of Mannerism in architecture, is the richest façade of its generation, rivalling Giulio Romano's Palazzo Te. Its complex superimposed layers, its alternating superimposed rhythms of large and small bays and straight and spiralling fluting, the rich carved decor in its keystones and in the spandrels of the piano nobile arches, climax in the rich sculpture of its corbelled cornice. The lion of St. Mark on the Porta Terraferma, Zadar, Croatia One of Sanmicheli's most graceful designs is the Cappella Pellegrini in the church of San Bernardino at Verona, where the cylindrical exterior masks a domed interior that rearranges elements of the Pantheon. His other works include Palazzo Corner a San Polo and Palazzo Grimani di San Luca in Venice, the Porta Terraferma in Zadar and the funerary Petrucci Chapel in the church of San Domenico in Orvieto. Beside the Ponte Nuovo in Verona (demolished in the late 19th century), his last work, begun in 1559, was the Santuario di Madonna di Campagna (or Santa Maria della Pace), formerly outside Verona on the road to Venice. The cylindrical church, with a band of blind and windowed arcading under a wide plain frieze, crowned with a dome, was probably modified during its construction by Bernardino Brugnoli.The book that was mistaken for Sanmicheli's own in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica was Li cinque ordini dell' architettura civile di Michel Sanmicheli, printed at Verona in 1735 by conte Alessandro Pompei, the heir of Sanmicheli's patron who lived in Palazzo Pompei, Verona. Pompei was a noble amateur architect with links to the circle of Scipione Maffei. Noting the lack of existing drawings by Sanmicheli, and the absence of theoretical contributions on his part, Pompei analyzed Sanmicheli’s use of the orders of architecture, comparing them with those of the outstanding published masters, Vignola, Serlio and Palladio. His publication attracted the attention of a young generation of neoclassical architects to the forgotten Michele Sanmichele. In 1862 measured drawings published by Francesco Ronzani and Girolamo Luciolli inaugurated the modern reappraisal of his work. The work was published as three folio volumes, with a portrait frontispiece and 150 engraved plates.Alessandro Pompei, Li cinque ordini d'architettura civile di Michele Sanmicheli non più veduti in luce, ora publicati, ed esposti con quelli di Vitruvio e d'altri cinque, Verona, 1735Michele Sanmicheli; Francesco Zanotto; Francesco Ronzani; Girolamo Luciolli.

The piece is then fired until the enamel fuses, and when cooled the surface of the object is polished. The uncarved portions of the original surface remain visible as a frame for the enamel designs; typically they are gilded in medieval work.Osbourne, 332 The name comes from the French for \\"raised field\\", \\"field\\" meaning background, though the technique in practice lowers the area to be enamelled rather than raising the rest of the surface. The technique has been used since ancient times, though it is no longer among the most commonly used enamelling techniques. Champlevé is suited to the covering of relatively large areas, and to figurative images, although it was first prominently used in Celtic art for geometric designs. In Romanesque art its potential was fully used, decorating caskets, plaques and vessels, in Limoges enamel and that from other centres. Champlevé is distinguished from the technique of cloisonné enamel in which the troughs are created by soldering flat metal strips to the surface of the object. The difference between the techniques is analogous to the woodworking techniques of intarsia and marquetry. It differs from the basse-taille technique, which succeeded it in the highest quality Gothic work, in that the bottoms of the recesses for the enamel are rough, and so only opaque enamel colours are used. In basse-taille the recesses are modelled, and translucent enamels are used, for more subtle effects, as in the 14th century Parisian Royal Gold Cup.Osbourne, 332-333 Early champlevé Celtic red enamel on horse-harness, Britain, c. AD 50 Enamel was first used on small pieces of jewellery, and has often disintegrated in ancient pieces that have been buried. Consistent and frequent use of champlevé technique is first seen in the La Tène style of early Celtic art in Europe, from the 3rd or 2nd century BC, where the predominant colour was a red, possibly intended as an imitation of red coral (as used on the Witham Shield), and the base was usually bronze. The \\"Insular Celts\\" of the British Isles made especially common use of the technique, seen as highlights on the relief decoration of the Battersea Shield and other pieces.Campbell, 8-10, Osbourne, 332 However this was technically not true enamel in the usual sense of the word, as the glass was only heated until it became a soft paste before being pushed into place. This is sometimes informally known as \\"sealing-wax\\" enamelling, and may be described as \\"glass inlay\\" or similar terms. True enamelling technique, where glass paste is put into place and fired until it liquifies, was learnt from the Romans.Youngs, 173 The earliest literary description of enamel is from the Greek sophist Philostratus III, who wrote in his Icones (Bk I, 28), describing polychrome horse-harness: \\"It is said that the barbarians in the Ocean pour these colours on heated bronze and that they adhere, become as hard as stone and preserve the designs that are made on them\\".Campbell, 10 The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan, 2nd century AD Romano-British, with enamel in four colours. Celtic curvilinear styles were highly effective in enamel, and were used throughout the Roman period when they largely disappear in other media. The Staffordshire Moorlands Pan is a 2nd-century trulla with large enamel roundels in four colours of enamel, commissioned by or for Draco, a soldier, possibly a Greek, as a souvenir of his service on Hadrian's Wall. It is one of a group of similar enamelled vessels found in Britain and northern Gaul. Smaller items from similar contexts include brooches and other jewellery, and mounts for horse harness as described by Philostratus. Around the end of the Roman Empire new forms arose: the terminals of the increasingly fancy penannular brooches of the British Isles become decorated with champlevé, as do other fasteners and fittings, and the mounts of hanging bowls. These last have long puzzled art historians, as not only is their purpose unclear, but they are mostly found in Anglo-Saxon and Viking contexts, including three at Sutton Hoo, but their decoration uses predominantly Celtic motifs. One of the Sutton Hoo bowls had been repaired, but in a different, Germanic, style.Bruce-Mitford, 29-30 Altogether, production of the different types of hanging bowls covers the period 400–1100.Bruce-Mitford, 34, 43-44 While the leading expert, Rupert Bruce-Mitford, sees the bowls as the products of \\"Celtic\\" workshops, perhaps often in Ireland, in the same period the use of large areas of champlevé in the most ornate Celtic brooches reduces, though gem-like enamel highlights, some in millefiori, are still found. In Anglo-Saxon art, as in that of most of Europe and the Byzantine world, this was the period when cloisonné technique dominated enamelling. Romanesque ciborium, c. 1200 Champlevé is especially associated with Romanesque art, and many of the finest survivals of the style feature the technique. There was a great increase in use of the technique in several areas in the late 11th century, just as the Romanesque style matured. The immediate source of the style remains obscure; various exotic origins have been suggested, but the great expansion in the use of stained glass at the same period is probably connected. Copper or bronze bases were normally used, which were soft and easy to work, as well as relatively cheap, but as they discoloured in heat opaque enamels needed to be used. Blue was now the dominant colour, as in stained glass; the best blues in painting (whether on wall, panel or manuscript) were very expensive whereas in glass rich blues are easily obtainable. Mosan and Limoges enamels are the most famous, and the figures carved in the copper plate display a superb sense of line. The Stavelot Triptych in New York is an example of the finest Mosan work, and the Becket Casket in London a fine early piece from Limoges. The names of several Mosan goldsmith-enamellers are known. Relief and fully modelled figures were also enamelled, and some metal bases formed by hammering into moulds. The Limoges production increased steadily in quantity, and by the Gothic period had declined in quality, but provided a fairly cheap product, especially of chasse caskets, produced on a semi-industrial scale and exported all over Europe. Spanish enamels, not easily distinguished from Limoges work, were also produced on a large scale. Mosan work was sometimes on gold or silver-gilt, but in Limoges and Spain gilt-copper is usual, and much Mosan work uses this too, as in the example illustrated. This example also shows the mixing of different colours and shades within the same cell, here used throughout the design in a complex manner, whereas in the Limoges examples below much less, and much simpler, use is made of this difficult technique.Osbourne, 332-333 A similar technique was known as \\"shippou-zogan\\" in Japan, where it was considered a form of damascening.

It then proceeds eastwards along the 31° 20′ parallel north up to a meridian west of the point where the Rio Grande crosses the 31° 47′ parallel north, It then proceeds northwards along that meridian up to the 31° 47′ parallel north and then eastwards along that parallel until it meets the Rio Grande. According to the International Boundary and Water Commission, the continental border then follows the middle of the Rio Grande—according to the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo between the two nations, \\"along the deepest channel\\" (also known as the thalweg)—a distance of to its mouth at the Gulf of Mexico. The Rio Grande frequently meanders along the Texas–Mexico border. As a result, the United States and Mexico have a treaty by which the Rio Grande is maintained as the border, with new cut-offs and islands being transferred to the other nation as necessary. The Boundary Treaty of 1970 between Mexico and the United States settled all outstanding boundary disputes and uncertainties related to the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte) border. The region is characterized by deserts, rugged hills, abundant sunshine, and two major rivers—the Colorado and the Rio Grande (Río Bravo del Norte). The U.S. states along the border, from west to east, are California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. The Mexican states along the border are Baja California, Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila, Nuevo León, and Tamaulipas. Among the U.S. states, Texas has the longest stretch of the border with Mexico, while California has the shortest. Among the states in Mexico, Chihuahua has the longest border with the United States, while Nuevo León has the shortest. Along the border are 23 U.S. counties and 39 Mexican municipalities.

History = Prior to the Mexican–American War = Map of Mexico in 1842 In the mid-16th century, after the discovery of silver, settlers from various countries and backgrounds began to arrive in the area. This period of sparse settlement included colonizers from different backgrounds. The area was part of New Spain, but due to the lack of population and the diverse citizenry it had, it did not seem to belong to any country. This period lasted until the early 19th century, at which point the United States bought the lands known as the Louisiana Purchase from France and began to expand steadily (militarily) westward in its pursuit of Manifest Destiny. After the 1803 Louisiana Purchase, the border between the United States and New Spain was not clearly defined. The border was established in the 1819 Adams–Onís Treaty between the United States and Spain, which specified a border in the vicinity of the western edge of the Mississippi River watershed. Mexico gained its independence from Spain just over six months later, but the border was reaffirmed in the 1828 Treaty of Limits. Mexico attempted to create a buffer zone at the border that would prevent possible invasion from the North. The Mexican government encouraged thousands of their own citizens to settle in the region that is now known as Texas and even offered inexpensive land to settlers from the United States in exchange for populating the area. The influx of people did not provide the defense that Mexico had hoped for and instead Texas declared its independence in 1836, which lasted until 1845 when the U.S. annexed it. = Establishment of current border = San Diego together with Tijuana creates the bi-national San Diego–Tijuana metropolitan area. The constant conflicts in the Texas region in the mid-19th century eventually led to the Mexican–American War, which began in 1846 and ended in 1848 with the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo. In the terms of the peace treaty, Mexico lost more than of land, 55% of its territory, including all of what is today California, Arizona, New Mexico, Utah, Nevada and parts of what is Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, and Oklahoma. In addition, all disputes over Texas and the disputed territory between Rio Grande and Rio Nueces were abandoned. Five years later, the Gadsden Purchase completed the creation of the current United States–Mexico border. The purchase was initially to accommodate a planned railway right-of-way. These purchases left approximately 300,000 people living in the once disputed lands, many of whom were Mexican nationals. Following the establishment of the current border a number of towns sprang up along this boundary and many of the Mexican citizens were given free land in the northern regions of Mexico in exchange for returning and repopulating the area. = Later history = El Paso (top) and Ciudad Juárez (bottom) seen from earth orbit; the Rio Grande is the thin line separating the two cities through the middle of the photograph. El Paso and Juarez make up the third largest U.S. international metroplex after Detroit–Windsor and San Diego-Tijuana. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and another treaty in 1884 were the agreements originally responsible for the settlement of the international border, both of which specified that the middle of Rio Grande was the border, irrespective of any alterations in the channels or banks. The Rio Grande shifted south between 1852 and 1868, with the most radical shift in the river occurring after a flood in 1864. By 1873 the moving river-center border had cut off approximately of Mexican territory in the El Paso-Juarez area, in effect transferring the land to the United States. By a treaty negotiated in 1963, Mexico regained most of this land in what became known as the Chamizal dispute and transferred in return to the United States. Border treaties are jointly administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), which was established in 1889 to maintain the border, allocate river waters between the two nations, and provide for flood control and water sanitation. Once viewed as a model of international cooperation, in recent decades the IBWC has been heavily criticized as an institutional anachronism, by-passed by modern social, environmental and political issues. In particular, jurisdictional issues regarding water rights in the Rio Grande Valley have continued to cause tension between farmers along the border, according to Mexican political scientist Armand Peschard-Sverdrup. The economic development of the border region on the Mexican side of the border depended largely on its proximity to the United States, due to its remoteness from commercial centers in Mexico. During the years of Mexican President Porfirio Díaz, between 1876 and 1910, the border communities boomed, due mostly to close ties to the United States, and the Mexican government's support for financial investments from the United States. Railroads were built that connected the northern Mexican states more to the United States than to Mexico, and the population grew tremendously. The mining industry also developed, as did the United States’ control of it. By the early 20th century companies from the United States controlled 81% of the mining industry and had invested five hundred million dollars in the Mexican economy overall, twenty-five percent of it in the border regions. Vehicle barrier in the New Mexico desert 2010 The United States Immigration Act of 1891 authorized the implementation of inspection stations at ports of entry along the Mexican and Canadian borders. The United States Immigration Act of 1917 required the passing of a literacy test and a head tax by Mexicans wanting to enter the United States legally; however, during World War I, when labor shortages grew, the provisions were temporarily suspended. The United States Immigration Act of 1924 established the United States Border Patrol. The Mexican Revolution, caused at least partially by animosity toward foreign ownership of Mexican properties, began in 1910. The revolution increased the political instability in Mexico, but did not significantly slow United States investment. It did reduce economic development within Mexico, however, and the border regions reflected this. As the infrastructure of communities on the United States side continued to improve, the Mexican side began to fall behind in the construction and maintenance of important transportation networks and systems necessary to municipal development. Although the Mexican Revolution caused insecurity in Mexico itself, it also strained United States-Mexico relations. With the Mexican Revolution lasting for 10 years, ending in 1920, and World War I simultaneously occurring between 1914 and 1918, the division between the United States and Mexico began to polarize the two nation-states. Constant battles and raids along the border made both authorities nervous about borderland security. The Zimmerman Telegram, a diplomatic cable sent by Germany but intercepted and decrypted by British intelligence, was meant to bait Mexico into war with the United States in order to reconquer what was taken from them during the U.S.-Mexican War. This inspired the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to monitor suspicious activities and potential violence at the border. Within 10 years, frequent provocations caused border towns to transform into battlefields, which intensified transborder restrictions, brought federal soldiers to patrol the border, and caused the construction of fences and barriers between border towns. When the battles concluded, restrictions for crossing the border were relaxed and most soldiers were sent home; however, the fences remained as a physical reminder of the division between the two nations. As years passed, more fences and higher barriers were established as attentions focused on the boundary demarcation between the United States and Mexico. The first international bridge was the Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge built in 1910. The first barrier built by the US was between 1909-1911 in California, the first barrier built by Mexico was likely in 1918, barriers were extended in the 1920s and 1940s. The Banco Convention of 1905 between the United States and Mexico allowed, in the event of sudden changes in the course of the Rio Grande (as by flooding), for the border to be altered to follow the new course. The sudden changes often created bancos (land surrounded by bends in the river that became segregated from either country by a cutoff, often due to rapid accretion or avulsion of the alluvial channel), especially in the Lower Rio Grande Valley. When these bancos are created, the International Boundary and Water Commission investigates if land previously belonging to the United States or Mexico is to be considered on the other side of the border. In all cases of these adjustments along the Rio Grande under the 1905 convention, which occurred on 37 different dates from 1910 to 1976, the transferred land was small (ranging from one to 646 acres) and uninhabited. The Rio Grande Rectification Treaty of 1933 straightened and stabilized the river boundary through the highly developed El Paso-Juárez Valley. Numerous parcels of land were transferred between the two countries during the construction period, 1935–1938. At the end, each nation had ceded an equal area of land to the other. The Boundary Treaty of 1970 transferred an area of Mexican territory to the U.S., near Presidio and Hidalgo, Texas, to build flood control channels. In exchange, the U.S. ceded other land to Mexico, including five parcels near Presidio, the Horcon Tract and Beaver Island near Roma, Texas. On November 24, 2009, the U.S. ceded 6 islands in the Rio Grande to Mexico. At the same time, Mexico ceded 3 islands and 2 bancos to the U.S. This transfer, which had been pending for 20 years, was the first application of Article III of the 1970 Boundary Treaty. Border crossing checkpoints Climbing the Mexico–United States barrier fence in Brownsville, Texas The border separating Mexico and the United States is the most frequently crossed international boundary in the world, with approximately 350 million legal crossings taking place annually. There are 48 U.S.–Mexico border crossings, with 330 ports of entry. At these points of entry, people trying to get into the U.S. are required to open their bags for inspection. Border crossings take place by roads, pedestrian walkways, railroads and ferries. From west to east, below is a list of the border city \\"twinnings\\"; cross-border municipalities connected by one or more legal border crossings.

The Mexico–United States border is the world's most transited border. The San Ysidro Port of Entry is located between San Ysidro, California and Tijuana, Baja California. Approximately 50,000 vehicles and 25,000 pedestrians use this entry daily. Due to business of this entry port, it has influenced the every day life-style of people that live in these border towns. The world's busiest border is having an impact on communities on both sides of the border. The average wait time to cross into the United States is approximately an hour. Having thousands of vehicles transit through the border every day is causing air pollution in San Ysidro and Tijuana. The emission of carbon monoxide (CO) and other vehicle related air contaminants have been linked to health complications such as cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, birth outcomes, premature death, obesity, asthma and other respiratory diseases. Due to the high levels of traffic collusion and the extended wait times, mental health is also impacted by the border's business, affecting the person's stress levels and aggressive behavior. The San Ysidro border is heavily militarized, separated by three walls, border patrol agents and ICE. Tijuana is the next target for San Diegan developers due to the fast-growing city, its lower cost of living, cheap prices and proximity to San Diego. While this would benefit the tourist aspect of the city, it is damaging to low-income residents that will no longer be able to afford the cost of living in Tijuana. Tijuana is home to many deportees from the United States, many who have lost everything and do not have an income to rely on and are now in a new city in which they have to quickly adapt in order to survive. San Diego developers would bring many benefits to Tijuana but deportees and the poor run the risk of being impacted by the gentrification of Tijuana. =Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative= The San Ysidro border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana In late 2006, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced a rule regarding new identification requirements for U.S. citizens and international travelers entering the United States implemented on January 23, 2007. This final rule and first phase of the WHTI specifies nine forms of identification, one of which is required to enter the United States by air: a valid passport; a passport card; a state enhanced driver's license or state enhanced non-driver ID card (available in Michigan, New York, Vermont, and Washington) approved by the Secretary of Homeland Security; a trusted traveler program card (Global Entry, NEXUS, FAST, or SENTRI); an enhanced tribal identification card; a Native American Tribal Photo Identification Card; Form I-872 – American Indian Card; a valid Merchant Mariner Document when traveling in conjunction with official maritime business; or a valid U.S. military identification card when traveling on official orders. The Mexico–United States border is the world's busiest border, specifically the crossing at San Diego, California, to Tijuana, Baja California (15.6 miles between the cities), known as the San Ysidro Port of Entry. In the U.S., Interstate 5 crosses directly to Tijuana, and the highway's southern terminus is this crossing. In 2005, more than 17 million vehicles and 50 million people entered the U.S. through San Ysidro. Among those who enter the United States through San Ysidro are transfronterizos, American citizens who live in Mexico and attend school in the United States. Along the coast of Baja California, there are neighborhoods of Americans living in Tijuana, Rosarito Beach, and Ensenada, whose residents commute to the United States daily to work. Additionally, many Mexicans also enter the United States to commute daily to work. In 1999, 7.6% of the labor force of Tijuana was employed in San Diego. In August, 2015, Mexico began enforcing a rule that all foreign citizens that plan to stay in the country for more than seven days or are travelling on business will have to pay a 330 pesos ($21) fee and show their passport. =Veterinary inspections= Passport stamp upon arrival in Tijuana, Baja California land border crossing. When animals are imported from one country to another, there is the possibility that diseases and parasites can move with them. Thus, most countries impose animal health regulations on the import of animals. Most animals imported to the United States must be accompanied by import permits obtained in advance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and/or health certification papers from the country of origin. Veterinary inspections are often required, and are available only at designated ports; advance contact with port veterinarians is recommended. Animals crossing the United States–Mexico border may have a country of origin other than the country where they present for inspection. Such animals include those from the U.S. that cross to Mexico and return, and animals from other countries that travel overland through Mexico or the U.S. before crossing the border. Crossing from Mexico to the United States Thousands of cars sit from fifteen minutes to two hours waiting to cross the border. APHIS imposes precautions to keep out several equine diseases, including glanders, dourine, equine infectious anemia (EIA), equine piroplasmosis (EP), Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE), and contagious equine metritis (CEM). APHIS also checks horses to prevent the introduction of ticks and other parasites. In the Lower Rio Grande Valley, U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors look for horses and livestock that stray across the border carrying ticks. These animals are often called wetstock, and the inspectors are referred to as tickriders. Per APHIS, horses originating from Canada can enter the United States with a Canadian government veterinary health certificate and a negative test for EIA. Horses from Mexico must have a health certificate; pass negative tests for EIA, dourine, glanders, and EP at a USDA import center; and undergo precautionary treatments for external parasites at the port of entry. Horses from other Western Hemisphere countries must have the same tests as those from Mexico and, except for horses from Argentina, must be held in quarantine for at least seven days as a check for VEE. APHIS imposes similar testing and certification requirements on horses from other parts of the world but without the quarantine for VEE. These horses are held in quarantine—usually three days—or until tests are completed. Because the disease equine piroplasmosis (equine babesiosis) is endemic in Mexico but not established in the United States, transportation of horses from Mexico to the United States requires evaluation of horses for the presence of this disease. Transportation of horses from Mexico to the United States normally requires at least three days in quarantine, which is incompatible with most recreational equestrian travel across the border. A leading exception to this rule is the special waiver obtained by riders participating in the Cabalgata Binacional Villista (see cavalcade). Crossing from the United States to Mexico Import from the United States to Mexico requires evidence within the prior 45 days of freedom from equine infectious anemia, among other requirements. Security =Background= The Big Bend National Park is located at the Border. Data from the United States Border Patrol Agency's (USBP) 2010 annual report shows that among the total number of border crossings without documentation from various countries into the United States, 90 percent were from Mexico alone. In addition, there are more than 6 million undocumented Mexican nationals residing in the United States. The border, with a length of , has a very high rate of documented and undocumented migrant crossings every year. With such a high rate of people crossing annually to the United States, the country has invested in several distinct security measures. In 2010, due to insecurity and instability at the southern border of the U.S. President Barack Obama signed an appropriation bill, which gave the Customs and Border Protection, specifically the Border Patrol, 600 million dollars to implement and improve security. The U.S. government has invested many millions of dollars on border security, although this has not stopped undocumented immigration in the United States. In June 2018, the U.S. government announced installation of facial recognition system for monitoring the immigrant's activities. = Border enforcement = Border Patrol agents in southern Texas in 2013. While the Border Patrol has changed a lot since its inception in 1924, its primary mission remains unchanged: to detect and prevent the illegal entry of immigrants into the United States. Together with other law enforcement officers, the Border Patrol helps maintain borders that work – facilitating the flow of legal immigration and goods while preventing the illegal trafficking of people and contraband. Since the Border Patrol's strategy has occasionally changed and most recently within the past two decades, the present strategy to enforce migration along the United States-Mexico border is by the means of \\"prevention through deterrence\\". Its primary goal is to completely prevent undocumented immigrants from entering the United States from Mexico rather than apprehending the unauthorized who are already in the country. As assertive as it was, \\"prevention through deterrence\\" has not been as successful as it was planned to do, due to the doubling in size of undocumented immigrants population during the two decades leading up to 2014. In order to effectively enforce border protection, the United States' policies and regulations have looked to make border crossings more hazardous through the implementation of various operations, one of those being the \\"funnel effect\\". The tactic was meant to discourage migration from Mexico into the United States by forcing migrants to travel further around barriers where the terrain and weather are more risky, but the strategy was not as successful as initially planned, due to the will of migrants making the choice to pass through extreme circumstances. As a result, the effect funneled more immigrants to their death even with the assistant of coyotes (smugglers). Not only has this approach caused fatalities throughout the United States-Mexico border, but it has even stirred up a nuisance for documented immigrants and American citizens. There has been general concern about the Border Patrol and other agencies abusing their authority by racial profiling and conducting unwarranted searches outside the exception of the border zone, but still within the border zone. Notwithstanding these setbacks, billions of dollars of governmental funding are still spent on the \\"prevention through deterrence\\" strategy, especially within the rise of the Trump administration. In 2012, Border Patrol agents made over 364,000 arrests of people illegally entering the country. Considerable success has been achieved in restoring integrity and safety to the Southwest border, by putting in place a border-control strategy. These include Operation Gatekeeper in San Diego, CA, Operation Hold the Line in El Paso, TX, Operation Rio Grande in McAllen, TX, Operation Safeguard in Tucson, AZ, and the Arizona Border Control Initiative (ABCI) along the Arizona border. Over five million cars and trucks travel through the border annually. According to Vulliamy, one in five Mexican nationals will visit or work in the United States at one point in their lifetime. As of 2010, the border is guarded by more than twenty thousand Border Patrol agents, more than at any time in its history. The border is paralleled by United States Border Patrol interior checkpoints on major roads generally between from the U.S. side of the border, and garitas generally within of the border on the Mexican side. Drug trafficking tunnel under the U.S.–Mexico border used by the Sinaloa Cartel There are an estimated half a million illegal entries into the United States each year. Border Patrol activity is concentrated around border cities such as San Diego and El Paso which have extensive border fencing. This means that the flow of illegal immigrants is diverted into rural mountainous and desert areas, leading to several hundred migrant deaths along the Mexico–U.S. border of those attempting to cross into the United States from Mexico illegally and vice versa. Undocumented labor contributes $395 billion to the economy every year. While the U.S. is in favor of immigration, the increase in undocumented immigration has given border-crossing a negative image. There are around 11.5 million undocumented workers in the U.S. today, and 87% of undocumented immigrants have been living in the U.S. for more than 7 years. Local economies that develop on the Mexican side capitalize not only on available skills but also on available, usually discarded, materials. Small businesses trade in clothes that are purchased by the pound and cardboard from the United States. Some items, like the used tires found everywhere along the border, are made into certain items that support local economies and define a border. The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was passed providing for the construction of of high-security fencing. Attempts to complete the construction of the Mexico–United States barrier have been challenged by the Mexican government and various U.S.–based organizations. In January, 2013, the Government Accountability Office released a report stating that the United States Border Patrol only intercepted sixty-one percent of individuals illegally crossing the border in 2011, which translated to 208,813 individuals not apprehended. 85,827 of the 208,813 would go on to illegally enter the United States, while the rest returned to Mexico and other Central American countries. The report also showed that the number of illegal border crossings has dropped. The apprehensions per (fiscal) year are shown in the graph; they reached a maximum of over 1.643 million in the year 2000. Similar numbers had been reached in 1986 with over 1.615 million. Since 2010, the numbers have consistently remained beneath half a million. The increase of border security throughout the years has progressively made crossings at the United States-Mexico border more dangerous, which has developed a human rights crisis at the border. The number of migrant deaths occurring along the United States-Mexico border has dramatically increased due to the change of migrant traffic moving into rural areas from urban spaces. Along the Arizona-Mexico border, only seven migrant deaths were recorded in 1996; however, the remains of over 2,000 migrants were discovered from 2001 to 2012. Since the majority of deaths occur in rural areas, where extreme temperatures are common, it is likely the number of recorded deaths are far below the total. Due to harsh, inaccessible terrains, human remains may not be found for years or ever. The Human Rights Watch cited on April 22, 2020, that a United States-Mexico border shutdown could be expected following the Covid-19 public health emergency. According to HRW, the new rule introduced by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) overlooks the fact that the US is obligated to protect refugees from return to conditions threatening prosecution, as per treaties it is part of. =Barrier= The U.S. government had plans in 2006, during the Bush administration, to erect a border fence along the Mexico–U.S. border. The controversial proposal included creating many individual fences. Almost of fence was constructed, with each of the individual fences composed of steel and concrete. In between these fences are infrared cameras and sensors, National Guard soldiers, and SWAT teams on alert, giving rise to the term \\"virtual fence\\". Construction on the fence began in 2006, with each mile costing the U.S. government about $2.8 million. In 2010, the initiative was terminated due to costs, after having completed of either barrier fence or vehicle barriers, that were either new or had been rebuilt over older, inferior fencing. The Boeing-built SBI-net systems of using radar, watchtowers, and sensors (without a fence or physical barrier) were scrapped for being over budget, full of glitches, and far behind schedule.

Thereafter, the number of apprehensions increased dramatically to 95,000 in 2012, 150,000 in 2013 and 220,000 in 2014. The increased apprehensions could have been either due to improved border security, due to a dramatic rise in attempted crossings, or both. As per the media, in the fiscal year of 2006, there were twenty-nine confirmed border incursions by Mexican government officials, of which seventeen were by armed individuals. Since 1996, there have been 253 incursions by Mexican government officials. In 2014 the U.S. Department of Homeland Security informed California Representative Duncan D. Hunter that since 2004, there have been 300 documented border incursions, which resulted in 131 individuals being detained. The Washington Times has reported that on Sunday, August 3, 2008, Mexican military personnel who crossed into Arizona from Mexico encountered a U.S. Border Patrol agent, whom they held at gunpoint. The soldiers later returned to Mexico, as backup Border Patrol agents came to investigate. =Disagreements over need for more resources= Proponents of greater spending on the border argue that continuing the buildup is necessary due to increased violence and drug trafficking from Mexico spilling into the United States. However, critics such as the Washington Office on Latin America (WOLA) have argued that the diminishing number of border crossings can only be partially attributed to U.S. security measures. Unintentional factors, such as a weakened U.S. economy in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and increased violence in northern Mexico have made attempting illegal border crossings more risky and less rewarding. In 2019, there have been humanitarian crisis in the border due to lack of resources. Migrant children have specifically been affected.Stenn, L. (2019, June 25).

In 2016, Republican nominee for president Donald Trump insisted he wanted to build a border wall to control immigration. He declared that, as president, he would force Mexico to pay all costs. On January 25, 2017, several days after his inauguration and two days in advance of a planned meeting in Washington, D.C. with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, President Trump signed Executive Order 13767 to enable the building of the wall Peña Nieto denied that Mexico would pay for the wall and declined the meeting. Shortly after, Trump announced that he intended to impose a 20% tariff on Mexican goods. (Mexico did not make any payments. Tariffs increase the price of goods resulting in a tax paid by the consumer.) On September 20, 2017, California Attorney General Becerra filed a lawsuit alleging that the Trump administration has overstepped its powers in expediting construction of a border wall.State of California Department of Justice, September 20, 2017: Attorney General Becerra: Constitution, Rule of Law Barriers to Trump Border Wall (Press Release) As of the end of 2017, Mexico had not agreed to pay any amount toward the wall, no new tariffs on Mexican goods had been considered by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Congress had not appropriated funding for a wall, and no further wall construction had started beyond what was already planned during the Obama administration. In June, 2018, the Trump administration established a new policy of separating parents from their children at the Mexican border. People asking for asylum at official ports of entry were \\"being turned away and told there’s no room for them now.\\" The U.S. and Mexico mutually placed tariffs on each other's exports. Nogales border fence. On November 8, 2018, the Trump administration announced new rules to deny asylum to anyone who crosses into the United States illegally from any nation, at Trump's discretion. This was based on the Supreme Court decision of Trump v. Hawaii and the presidential powers of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Trump signed a proclamation the next day to specify that people crossing the Mexican border illegally would not qualify for asylum; he called the march of migrants from Central America towards the United States a \\"crisis\\". Civil rights groups strongly criticized the move, and several groups, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Center for Constitutional Rights, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California to challenge the proclamation. Judge Jon S. Tigar ruled in favor of the advocacy groups on November 20, 2018, placing an injunction on the administration to delay implementation of the rule. The administration appealed to the Ninth Circuit, where a divided 2-1 panel ruled that the new asylum rules were inconsistent with existing law and upheld the injunction. On December 21, 2018, the Supreme Court declined to hear the administration's challenge, leaving the injunction in place and preventing the asylum ban from being enforced. During the fiscal year from September, 2017, to September, 2018, U.S. border agents arrested 107,212 people traveling in families, a record-high number. During the following five months (October, 2018, through February, 2019), that record was shattered by the arrest of 136,150 people traveling in families. On March 31, 2019, Trump threatened to close the border, cutting off trade between the countries. On April 4, Trump said that instead he would give Mexico a year to stop illegal drugs from coming into the United States. If this did not happen, he said tariffs on automobiles would be used first, and then closing of the border.  Proposed wall  United States-Mexico-border-wall-Progreso-Lakes-Texas. While running for president, Trump claimed that the wall would cost $8 to $12 billion and that he could force Mexico to pay for it. Serious cost estimates of the proposed wall vary widely. In early 2017, shortly after Trump took office, the Department of Homeland Security estimated the cost at $22 billion, while Democratic staff on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee estimated $70 billion to build the wall and $150 million in annual maintenance. Significant cost overruns and missed deadlines are common in government projects; in recent U.S. history, see, for example, the Big Dig and the Boeing Dreamliner. In the summer of 2017, four major construction companies planned to bid for the contract. The Customs and Border Protection agency budgeted $20 million to hire these companies to build half-million- dollar prototypes of the wall. At this time, Congress had only approved $341 million to maintain the existing wall; no funds had been allocated to build new sections of wall. The Department of Homeland Security recommended that the wall's height should be between and its depth should be up to to deter drug traffickers from building tunnels. = Humanitarian assistance along the border = A volunteer from the Humane Border group is refilling water stations located on the desert of the U.S.-Mexico border. Among the diversity of humanitarian assistance along the U.S.–Mexico border, there are groups who take on a more hands-on approach. The Humane Borders, No More Deaths, and Samaritans are all humanitarian groups that provide water in order to reduce deaths of immigrants who are journeying through the Arizona desert. Despite having a common goal, a policy passed in 2010 by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife federal agency allowed water drums with of water to be placed in roads of disturbed areas, which supports method of Humane Borders and counters the methods of No More Deaths and Samaritans who place one-gallon jugs of water hanging from trees. No More Deaths (No Más Muertes) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) that is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona (roughly from the U.S.-Mexico border) that is designed to assist in ending death and suffering of immigrants along the U.S.-Mexico border by upholding fundamental human rights. Elemental services of No More Deaths is to provide humanitarian assistance, giving food and first aid treatment, witness and respond to human rights abuses, encouraging humane immigration policy, and making phone calls to relatives of immigrants. Since its founding in 2004, No More Deaths has provided assistance to thousands of migrant border crossers, however the Border Patrol and other public land agencies near the U.S.-Mexico border have challenged the efforts of various humanitarian groups, by following immigrants to a medical volunteer camp and raiding it. Humanitarian groups along the border have been tested by Border Patrol and other agencies, however the authority of the Trump administration has introduced a new tier of restriction through unprecedented levels of surveillance, harassment, and intimidation to border relief efforts. Nevertheless, volunteers of No More Deaths are committed each day to hike the trails in search of a sick or wounded abandoned by their coyote (guide), and most importantly, they walk to bear witness of injustice sufferings against basic human rights. Memorial coffins on the US- Mexico barrier for those killed crossing the border fence in Tijuana, México. In contrast, there are other humanitarian groups whose goal is create healthier communities along the U.S.–Mexico border. Due to an incidence rate of HIV and tuberculosis being higher in border towns such as El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juarez, Sonora than at the national level in both countries, the Nuestra Casa Initiative, developed with the help of Project Concern International, the US Agency for International Development, the Alliance of Border Collaborative, Dr. Eva Moya and Damien Schumman, tried to counter the health disparities by using a cross-border strategy that moved around an exhibit prominent in various Museums and universities.Moya, Eva, et al. “Nuestra Casa: An Advocacy Initiative to Reduce Inequalities and Tuberculosis along the US–Mexico Border.” International Public Health Journal, vol. 8, no. 2, 2016, pp. 107–119. Similarly, Special Action Groups as part of the Border Health Strategic Initiative created by the University of Arizona with other groups helped create a healthier Hispanic community in Arizona border towns by creating policy and infrastructure changes both in the public and private factor. These groups provided humanitarian assistance to counter the prominence of Type 2 diabetes among the Hispanic community since they acquired a block grant for new walking trails and encouraged public elementary schools to provide healthier food choices for students. A shelter is an example of a place where immigrants can feel safe from mistreatment, discrimination, extreme temperatures, and hunger. After many days, people are physically and mentally exhausted and are usually in desperate need of basic human necessities. Upon arriving at a shelter, travelers are finally able to properly bathe themselves and receive a new pair of clothes. In recent years, the number of unaccompanied children migrating through the United States- Mexico border has substantially increased and many find a shelter as a respite from their sufferings. In these shelters, children have a right to educational, mental, and health care along with other developmental services where they can rest from a troubled home country or traumatic journey. Even though there are frequent hazards that many immigrants have to encounter when crossing the desert near the Mexico–United States border, they still need to be cautious of local gangs. Immigrants are considered easy targets by gang members, because they do not have the strength to resist aggressive offenders and end up left with nothing. In June, 2018, U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, disqualified victims of gangs or domestic violence to be reasonable causes for asylum seekers. Despite the physical dangers of nature and thugs, immigrants at shelters still fall victim to trolling researchers and journalists. Fortunately, they don't harm those they are interviewing, but constantly looking for a \\"good\\" story can aggravate anyone who is still recovering from an arduous journey. A shelter like the Juan Bosco Shelter in Nogales, Sonora is supported by the Border Community Alliance, a nonprofit organization who looks to bridge the Mexico–United States border through fostering a community. Mexicans passing the Río Grande face the Big Bend National Park. Not only do these Hispanic communities faced health inequalities, but political inequalities as well. The need for political change was so huge that it has encouraged Hispanic women to engage in activism at a local level. The Neighborhood Action Group in Chula Vista, California is one of the groups of the attracted the help of local Hispanic women to implement a feminist perspective in activism in spite of the social and economic obstacles as well as Assembly Bill No. 775, 2005 that prohibited children being used as interpreters. These humanitarian groups have implemented various strategies to pursue their goals that ultimately try to counter the number of immigrant deaths and abuses in immigrant detention even if it means the criminalization and higher levels of discrimination against them. In regards to the Humanitarian assistance along the U.S.–Mexico border on the Mexico side, most humanitarian groups focus on assisting the deportees. As rates of deportation continue to drastically increase, “the deportation of many individuals is becoming more and more notable” in the streets of Mexico cities. As a result, many humanitarian groups have form along the Mexico cities where undocumented individuals are deported such as Nogales, Mexico. The humanitarian groups consist of faith-based communities and primarily non- profit organizations that assist the exhausted deportees. Not only are the deportees exhausted, but also many of them do not have any resources with them such as money, food, or family information that can help them. This oftentimes leads them to be homeless and go days without eating. They often go homeless because they \\"do not know where to turn to receive a meal, find shelter and to make a phone call\\". Along with them arriving without those resources, many immigrants \\"find themselves in distress\\" due to the fact that they arrive to Mexico emotionally and psychologically devastated. Contributing factors that might have caused them to be devastated can either be that they were separated from \\"their family members or the inability to work legally in the United States\\". Therefore, the primary purpose of the humanitarian groups on the Mexico side of the border is to create a pathway for transitional support such as providing the deportees food, shelter, clothing, legal help and social services. In addition, there are humanitarian groups that provides meals and shelter to deportees according to their deportation documents. Humanitarian groups along the border in Mexico are El Comedor, Nazareth House, Camino Juntos, La 72, and FM4: Paso Libre. In June, 2019, cases of humanitarian border crisis started to arise. For example, 300 migrant children were moved from a detention facility in Clint, Texas after a group of lawyers who visited reported unsafe and unsanitary conditions. Another alert of humanitarian crises rises when the body of Óscar Alberto Martínez and his 23-month-old daughter, Angie Valeria, were found dead, face down in Rio Grande river. The family were from El Salvador, attempting to cross from Mexico into Texas near Brownsville. Gaining attention from the media, the House passed a bill, $4.5 billion for resources at the border. Although there have been concerns of the Trump administration using the funding for further families being detained, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi explained that the bill is not an immigration bill, it will aid the children in need. Border zone policies Per the La Paz Agreement, the official \\"border area\\" extends \\"on either side of the inland and maritime boundaries\\" from the Gulf of Mexico west into the Pacific Ocean. There is also a 100-mile border zone. =Department of Homeland Security Secure Border Initiative= A U.S. Army National Guard member working with the U.S. Border Patrol in support of Operation Jump Start, Arizona, July 2006. A National Border Patrol Strategic Plan was first developed in 1994, it was then updated in 2004 and 2012. In 2004, the updated strategy focused on command structures, intelligence and surveillance, enforcement and deployment of U.S. Border Patrol agents to better respond to threats at the border. The strategic planning led to broader policy development for the Department of Homeland Security which led to the Secure Border Initiative (SBI) in 2005 to secure U.S. borders and reduce illegal migration. The main components of SBI dealt with staffing concerns, removal capacity, surveillance and tactical infrastructure and interior enforcement. An additional component was “high consequence enforcement”, which was not the subject of a formal public policy document. There was the allowance, historically, for voluntary returns of individuals apprehended at the border by Border Patrol agents. These voluntary returns, after the SBI of 2005, were limited to three “high consequence outcomes”. One \\"high consequence outcome\\" was formal removal, which meant the individual would be deemed ineligible for a visa for at least five years and subject to criminal charges if caught re-entering illegally. The Immigration and Nationality Act permitted aliens to be formally removed with “limited judicial processing” known as expedited removal. The Department of Homeland Security has expanded between 2002 and 2006, expedited removal for “certain aliens that entered within previous two weeks and were apprehended within of the border”. Another “high consequence outcome” is the increase in criminal charges. Department of Homeland Security has also worked with the Department of Justice to increase the number of apprehended individuals crossing the border illegally who are charged with criminal offenses. Most of these cases are prosecuted under Operation Streamline. The third “high consequence outcome” is known as remote repatriation. This is the return of apprehended Mexicans to remote locations by Border Patrol rather than the nearest Mexican port of entry. =100-mile border zone= Members of the North Carolina Army National Guard monitoring the U.S.–Mexico border in southwest Arizona. The United States has established a border zone which applies to all U.S. external borders including all coasts, in effect covering two-thirds of the U.S. population, including a majority of the largest cities in the U.S. and several entire states (namely Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and Rhode Island). The border zone was established by the U.S. Department of Justice in its interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have authority to stop and search within this zone, and are authorized to enter private property without a warrant within of the border as well as establish checkpoints. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against unreasonable search and seizure. However, under the border search exception, this protection does not fully apply at borders or border crossings (also known as ports of entry) or in the border zone. This means that much of the U.S. population is subject to CBP regulations including stop and search. There are some limits to CBP officials’ ability to stop and search. For instance CBP officials are not allowed to pull anyone over without a reasonable suspicion of immigration violation or crime, or search vehicles without warrant or probable cause. The ACLU, however, found that CBP officials routinely ignore or misunderstand the limits of authority, and this is compounded by inadequate training, lack of oversight and failure to hold officials accountable for abuse—incidence of abuse is common. =Operation Streamline= Federal courthouse in Tucson, AZ, where Operation Streamline proceedings take place. Operation Streamline refers collectively to zero-tolerance policies implemented at the Mexico–U.S. border that seek to remove undocumented immigrants through an expedited process if they have arrived with missing or fraudulent identification or have previously been convicted for an immigration crime. History Operation Streamline was first implemented in Del Rio, Texas, in 2005. Alt URL The program has since expanded to four out of the five federal judicial districts on the U.S.–Mexico border: Yuma, Arizona; Laredo, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; and Rio Grande Valley, Texas. Previously, immigrants apprehended at the border were either given the option to voluntarily return to their home country or they were placed in civil immigration proceedings. After Operation Streamline was implemented, nearly all people apprehended at the border who are suspected of having crossed illegally are subject to criminal prosecution. Defendants who are charged with crossing into the U.S. illegally are tried en masse to determine their guilt. Defense attorneys often are responsible for representing anywhere from six to forty immigrants at once. Around 99% of defendants in Operation Streamline proceedings plead guilty. The defendants are charged with a misdemeanor if convicted of crossing the border illegally for the first time, and a felony if it is a repeat offense. In December, 2009, it was decided in United States v. Roblero-Solis that en masse judicial proceedings like those in Operation Streamline violated Rule 11 in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Rule 11 states that the court must determine that a guilty plea is voluntarily made by addressing the defendant personally in court. The Roblero-Solis case determined that “personally” means that the judge must address the defendant in a person-to- person manner. Though many courts have changed their procedures to adapt to the ruling, there are still forms of en masse trials practiced at the border. Support and criticisms ICE ERO officers deporting a man wanted for two murders in Mexico. Proponents of Operation Streamline claim that the harsher prosecution has been an important factor in deterring immigrants from crossing the border illegally. Apprehensions have decreased in certain sectors after 2005, which is seen as a sign of success. For example, the Del Rio, Texas, sector saw a decline from 2005 to 2009 of 75% (from 68,510 to 17,082). Similarly, apprehensions declined in Yuma, Arizona, by 95% (from 138,438 to 6,951) from 2006 to 2009. Criticisms of Operation Streamline point to the program's heavy use of federal court and enforcement resources as a negative aspect. In addition, the prosecution of all illegal border crossings takes the focus away from prosecuting more serious crimes. They claim that the program's cost is too high for the effectiveness of the work it is accomplishing. In response to the claim that Operation Streamline is an effective deterrent, critics of the program claim that the incentives to cross the border in order to work or be with family are much stronger. Environment The Agreement on Cooperation for the Protection and Improvement of the Environment in the Border Area, known as the La Paz Agreement, was signed into law on August 14, 1983, and became enforceable on February 16, 1984. This agreement to protect the environment is the political foundation between the U.S. and Mexico for 4 subsequent programs. Each program has addressed environmental destruction in the border region resulting from the rise of the maquiladora industries, those who migrated to Northern Mexico to work in the industries, the lack of infrastructure to accommodate the people, Mexico's lax regulations concerning all these factors, the resulting spillover into the U.S., and the U.S.'s own environmentally destructive tendencies. The programs were: IBEP (1992), Border XXI (1996), Border 2012 (2003) and Border 2020 (2012). =Impacts of border wall on wildlife= Mexico-US border wall at Tijuana, Mexico. In 2006, during the presidency of George W. Bush, Congress approved Secure Fence Act which allowed the Department of Homeland Security to erect a border fence along the United State and Mexico border. A total of $2.2 billion was allocated to building this wall in five different areas of the border. Congress also approved a different law called the REAL ID Act which gave the Department of Homeland Security the approval to build the wall without taking into consideration the environmental and legal issues related to the wall. The United States Congress insisted that the act was passed for the sake of national security of the United States. According to a delegation of Arizona park and refuge managers, wildlife biologists, and conservationists who studied the United State and Mexico border concluded that building a wall along the Mexico border will also have negative impacts on the natural environment in the region. They argued that the border wall will negatively affect the wildlife in the Sonoran Desert including plants and animals. Naturally, animals do not tend to stay in one place and instead, they expedite to various places for water, plants, and other means in order to survive. The wall would restrict animals to a specific territory and would reduce their chances of survival. According to Brian Segee, a staff attorney with Wildlife Activists says that except high flying birds, the rest of the animals would not be able to move to other places due to the wall along the border. For instance, participants in this study argued that some of the animal kinds such as javelinas, ocelots, and Sonoran pronghorn would not be able to freely move along the border areas. It would also restrict the movement of jaguars from Sierra Madre Occidental forests to the southwestern parts of the United States. According to Brian Nowicki, a conservation biologist at the Center for Biological Diversity, there are 30 animal species living in the Arizona and Sonora that face danger and their movement to find new habitat and sources of survival would be restricted by the border wall. Transborder students Entrance into Mexico at Nogales, AZ (USA). Many schools near the border in America have students that live on the Mexican side of the border. These students are \\"transborder students\\", as they live in Mexico, but are enrolled in the United States education system. There are thousands of elementary through high school students that cross the Mexican-American border. They are known to wake up in the early hours of the morning to make their way to the border, where they wait in long lines to cross into the United States. After crossing the border, the students find a ride to school. Many students come to America for the opportunity, because it has a more developed and organized educational system. Students who go to school in America have a better chance of reaching higher education in the US. In many parts of Mexico, schooling is only required for students up to age sixteen. Many of the transborder students are natural-born U.S. citizens. Students that were born in America have the right to American education, even if they do not live in the United States. In places like the San Diego and Tijuana border, it is much cheaper to live in Mexico. San Diego has a high cost of living and one of the highest student homeless rates in the country, so many families move to Tijuana because it is more affordable to raise a family. In order to prevent Mexican children from illegally coming to America for education, some bordertown schools require official documentation (bills, mail, etc.) from students. This is to ensure that only students that are entitled to an education in the United States receive one. In Brownsville, a city on the southern border of Texas, a case ruled that school districts cannot deny students education if they have the proper paperwork. Many transborder students who live in these districts with these requirements will use extended family members’ addresses to prove their residency. Questions about the legitimacy of student residency have risen since the Trump administration took office in 2017, making it riskier to cross the border for education. These transborder students also raise questions about the acquisition of healthcare, as most Mexican students who attend university in the United States who also have family across the border are known to use the Mexican healthcare system instead of U.S. or university sources. The opposite case was also studied, seeking to find if U.S. students and citizens outsource their medical care from Mexican hospitals; however it was concluded that the use of, \\"cross-border healthcare diminishes significantly with English language acquisition.\\" Also researched is the impact of changing education for those children who attended school in the United States prior to deportation, and are now readjusting to a new education system within Mexico. In one study, when repatriated children were asked about how their world perspectives were changed once they returned to Mexico, they spoke to three main areas, \\"shifting identities, learning and losing named language, and schooling across borders.\\" The most frequent point mentioned in terms of changing schooling is the difficulty to adapt to a system in which they are unfamiliar, in a named language they might have lost, and where there is minimal continuity in the methodology of teaching. It is suggested in this study that while the U.S. has a long history of teaching immigrant students, along with tried and tested assimilation programming to support foreign children in U.S. border schools, Mexican systems just do not, making the change nearly impossible for newly-deported students to learn. While the Mexican Secretariat of the Public has vowed to change the legislation surrounding this issue, bilingual education is still only awarded to expensive private schools.

Vander Motten, ‘Killigrew, Sir William (bap. 1606, d. 1695)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 , accessed 9 September 2007 He was the son of Sir Robert Killigrew (d. 1633/5) and Mary Woodhouse, of Kimberley, Norfolk, his wife. He was the elder brother to Thomas Killigrew. He married Mary Hill and they had seven children, of whom only sons Robert and William survived their father. Killigrew was knighted in May 1626. He was elected MP for Newport and Penryn, Cornwall in March 1628, but only sat for the latter. In 1629, he and his father were jointly awarded the Governorship of Pendennis Castle. However, after some trouble, he resigned in favour of Sir Nicholas SlanningSir Nicholas Slanning (1606-43), English Civil War hero. Not to be confused with his son of the same name, who was MP for Penryn 1679-89. in April 1635. In 1634, he granted a 99-year lease of 6 shares of land () in Hamilton Tribe of Bermuda to his uncle, Henry Woodhouse, former governor of Bermuda. The rent was nominal – 100 oranges, 100 lemons and 100 potatoes, payable at the Feast of the Annunciation of the Blessed Virgin Mary – but Woodhouse did not keep up the payments. In 1637, Killigrew reclaimed the land. With partners, he attempted to drain the Lincolnshire fens, an immensely expensive undertaking. This involved him in considerable local strife.James Boyce Imperial Mud: The Fight for the Fens, Icon Books, 2020. During the English Civil War he gave loyal and effective support to the King. In 1646 he presented himself to the directors of the Levant Company and insisted that he was the king's choice as ambassador to Constantinople. His candidacy was not considered.Daniel Goffman, Britons in the Ottoman Empire, 1642-1660 (Seattle & London, 1998), p. 90. At the Restoration he was made the Queen's Vice-Chamberlain, an influential and well- rewarded post. In 1663 Killigrew published A proposal, shewing how this nation may be vast gainers by all the sums of money, given to the Crown, . . . in which he advocated that the government issue £2m in transferable bonds with the interest being covered by a yearly tax of £300k. The bonds would be for denominations between £5 and £100, mostly in the smaller denominations. The state would provide a regulatory framework to avoid fraud and ensure they were accepted as legal tender. The proposal was implemented by Secretary of the Treasury, George Downing, who started issuing Treasury Orders. Initially he hoped to side step the financial power of the goldsmith bankers. However, by 1672 most of the orders were in the hands of a handful of such bankers, and so ended up increasing their power. From 1664 to 1679 he was Member of Parliament for Richmond in Yorkshire. He was the author of four plays of some merit.\\"some merit\\": this is the judgement of the 1911 edition of Britannica. ODNB assigns them \\"limited literary value\\", but great historical interest. The four dramas, with their dates of publication, are: * Ormasdes, or Love and Friendship (1664) * Pandora, or the Converts (1664) * Selindra (1664) * The Siege of Urbin (1666). The tragicomedy The Siege of Urbin has often been considered his best play. Poet Edmund Waller addressed verses to Killigrew on the subject of Pandora, which indicate that the play was originally a tragedy; Killigrew revised it into a comedy after the tragic version failed onstage.James Orchard Halliwell-Phillipps and David Erskine Baker, A Dictionary of Old English Plays, London, J.

It is the terminus of one of the branches of the West Wales Line from Swansea. The area is also now served (since it reopened on 14 May 2012) by Fishguard and Goodwick railway station.  History  Fishguard in 1971 Certificate of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company The Great Western Railway took over the North Pembrokeshire and Fishguard Railway by agreement of 12 February 1898. Its intent was to turn Fishguard into a purpose-built ocean liner port because it wanted to take trans-Atlantic passenger traffic away from Plymouth and Southampton. In preparation of this, the GWR opened its first station, Fishguard & Goodwick railway station, in 1899 while work on the new port began with the construction of Fishguard Harbour's East breakwater. A new line would connect the proposed liner terminal on the East Breakwater to the West Wales line. The new route, which would have bypassed the steeper gradients and curves on this part of the original line, would have included a deep cutting, embankments and two tunnels. However, the project to build a breakwater and an ocean-going terminal was abandoned after it became clear silting (which could not be prevented by dredging) would stop large ocean- going ships from using the port. The East Breakwater was left unfinished. Two short sections of the planned railway to the new port terminal were completed before the project was ended. The GWR created a new port by building the North Breakwater by quarrying stone from the headland at Goodwick. The quarried-out area became the new quay and terminus for the West Wales line. On 30 August 1906, Fishguard harbour station was officially opened when the Waterford and Cork ferry services were transferred from to Fishguard Harbour. Three years later, the first Cunard liner to call at Fishguard was the on 30 August 1909.Ocean-liners.com However, passengers had to be transferred ashore and the waiting London train by tender due to the shallowness of the harbour.  Current facilities  The station is not owned by Network Rail but by Stena Line. A large part of the station is contained within the port building where there is seating and toilets. However, there are no railway ticket machines and the station is staffed only by Stena Line personnel, no rail staff are employed there. This means there is no rail ticket office and passengers travelling from Fishguard by train must purchase their tickets in advance by post, at a different station, or on board their train. The majority of passengers using the station are in possession of SailRail tickets issued at Rosslare Europort or another station in Ireland. The station has step-free access throughout and the station's owners, Stena Line, permit smoking on the platform. The station also has both long and short stay parking. The minimum connection time from Fishguard Harbour is seven minutes, and when bus replacement services are operating, the buses leave from the car park adjacent to the level crossing. After the ban on smoking in public became law in Wales in April 2007, the station became the only one in the UK where it was still permitted. Stena Line allowed passengers to continue to smoke on the platform because it was deemed too dangerous for them smoke at the nearest point where it was technically permissible: a level crossing over a busy road. Smoking is banned at all stations operated by Network Rail.  Rail services  Since the station is located in the harbour, its primary purpose has always been providing links with sea going transport. As such, there have always been daily services to and from Fishguard Harbour which coincide with the ferry services to Rosslare in Ireland. = Historic services =  1949  * There were two night-time express trains that ran daily to and from London Paddington. * Eight trains operated Monday to Saturday to and from stopping at , , , and . * One of those trains were extended to and from .  April 1964 to May 2003  InterCity 125 and St Brendan ferry in July 1988 * All the services serving the other stations on the branch were withdrawn on 6 April 1964, leaving the station served by boat trains only. This was during the Beeching cuts period. * Since that date the only scheduled passenger services have been the boat trains. * In recent years these have been one night service and one day service all year round, despite the summer-only fast ferry. At one stage the night service was formed of an InterCity 125 train running direct to/from London Paddington. The daytime service was the same, although perhaps for only part of the year. British Rail, and later First Great Western and its predecessor Great Western Trains all operated InterCity 125 services to Fishguard Harbour. ** In 2000, the night service was still operated by First Great Western (using InterCity 125s) but the daytime train was operated by Wales & West, meaning there were no longer any daytime through services to Paddington. ** Wales & West's services were transferred to Wales & Borders when Wales & West was split up.  May 2003 to September 2003  In 2003 the remaining First Great Western Fishguard services were withdrawn when the franchise was taken over by Wales & Borders. This ended almost a century of direct services to or from London Paddington. However, through services to and from other stations were added to the timetable. * The night-time train started from London Waterloo every-day, connecting with Eurostar continental services, with the train arriving at 02.38 Tuesday to Saturday mornings, and 01.00 Sunday and Monday mornings. Because of this later arrival on Tuesday to Saturday, this arriving service ran empty to Carmarthen rather than form a return journey. * The night-time train went to on Monday to Saturdays and on Sundays, leaving each day at 01.50. On Tuesday to Saturdays, this was formed of empty stock run from Carmarthen, whereas on Sundays and Mondays, it was formed of the incoming train from Waterloo. * On Monday to Fridays, the day- time train started from between 30 June and 5 September, not stopping Swansea and Carmarthen stations. Before and after these dates, the train started from and also called at Carmarthen. * On Saturdays, the daytime train went to and from * On Sundays, the daytime train started at , and went only as far as although it offered a 5- to 10-minute connection at Carmarthen for London- bound trains.  From September 2003 to September 2011  Arriva Trains Wales took over from Wales & Borders in December 2003 * A daytime train operated to and from , arriving and leaving Fishguard Harbour between 1pm and 2pm, often starting from and/or terminating at stations beyond Cardiff, such as in 2003. ** In 2010 and 2011 the service started from Cardiff and called only at and en route to Fishguard Harbour, making it the only scheduled passenger service to use the Carmarthen avoider line. On the return, the train called at as well as and before reaching , the train then continued onwards to . ** These daytime services therefore avoided in both directions. This is normally achieved using the Swansea District Line, but occasionally the service was routed via the \\"Swansea Avoiding Line\\" around the back of Landore Train Maintenance Depot instead. * A daily train operated at night, arriving and leaving Fishguard Harbour between 1am and 2am. ** The train operated to and from , but sometimes originated from stations beyond Swansea. ** As maintenance of the railways is predominantly done at night, this train was frequently replaced by buses. This was normally known well in advance. When buses replace the trains, the bus usually arrived at at around 02.05 and left after loading/unloading passengers, normally around 02.10. = From September 2011 to May 2017 = All services were operated by Arriva Trains Wales. The level of service was greatly enhanced from 12 September 2011 when five extra services per day in each direction commenced running to and from Fishguard Harbour Mondays to Saturdays. The five extra services are as follows:  Outbound  * Two trips to , with connections to stations further afield * One trip to * Two trips to  Inbound  * One early-morning trip to Fishguard Harbour from (with no connection from further east) * Two arrivals from ** One of these detaches from a train to at ** The other was later extended to start from Gloucester * Two trips from to Fishguard, one of which forms a connection out of a train from Manchester via Cardiff and Swansea (the other has no connection from further east) These are provided on a trial basis until September 2014 and are in addition to the two daily 'boat-trains', one at lunch time and one in the dead of night, which provide the traditional ferry connections. The extra services are the first regular timetabled services to Fishguard Harbour that have not been provided solely for connection with ferries since local services were withdrawn in 1964. Since the additional services only run Monday to Saturday, only the two trains connecting with ferry services serve the station on a Sunday. The decision to introduce additional trains has been credited to two teenagers from Moylegrove who collected a 1,440 signature petition in support of the move. A consultation was held in May/June 2011 on the planned services, but did not result in much adjustment to the times. The additional trains for Fishguard initiative has guaranteed funding until 2014, during which a review will be carried out to identify demand and passenger numbers and future funding. The extra services, with trains to and from Cardiff and Clarbeston Road, are not quite what was expected when the Welsh Assembly Government announced it would be funding up to £1.4m annually to provide extra services between and Fishguard. = Current services = The ferry sailing schedule was significantly revised in May 2017 resulting in changes to the train times. As a result, there are no longer trains during the night and the 01.50 departure is discontinued. From May 2018 it is proposed to extend the 19.30 from Manchester to Carmarthen to Fishguard Harbour, returning at 02.37 to Carmarthen, with an equivalent bus replacement in the early hours of Sunday.http://archive.nr.co.uk/browse%20documents/track%20access/1%20current%20track%20access%20consultations/20-03-2018%20-%20arriva%20trains%20wales%20-%2086th%20sa%20-%20section%2022%20-%20closes%2017%20april%202018/atw%2086th%20sa%20form%20p.pdf In October 2018, Transport for Wales took over from Arriva Trains Wales.

Origins of the name of the town.) is a town in County Tipperary, Ireland. In 2011 it had a population of 964. It is situated on the N52/N65 National secondary road between Nenagh and Portumna and the N52 between Nenagh and Birr. The Ballyfinboy River flows through the town on its way to Lough Derg which is only 12 km to the west. It is also a civil parish in the historical barony of Ormond Lower and an Ecclesiastical parish in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Killaloe.Parishes of Killaloe Diocese. Borrisokane is in the Dáil constituency of Offaly which incorporates 24 electoral divisions that were previously in the Tipperary North Dáil constituency. History During the Norman invasion of Ireland, the area now known as Borrisokane was the property of the O'Carrolls of Ely who claimed to be descendants of the Clan or Cian or the Cianacht. The O’Kennedys were another significant ruling family, owning tower houses in surrounding townlands. During the Cromwellian Plantation, Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey, the Earl of Cork and the Earl of Arran were among those granted lands at Borrisokane. Arran hill, a townland of Borrisokane, is thought likely to be named after the latter. Local population changes throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries have underlined the great social and economic challenges that Ireland as a nation itself faced during these times. The population of the parish in 1831 was 2, 634 and in 1841, it had risen to 3, 175. Due to reasons of famine and emigration, this number has fallen steadily to 1,145 today. During the War of Independence, and the Civil War which followed, Borrisokane was witness to local hostilities. On the 26 June 1920 about 200 IRA volunteers attacked an RIC barracks at Borrisokane, currently the town's Garda Station. The attack was unsuccessful, but the building was so badly damaged that it was evacuated the next day. One Volunteer was killed in the action, and a plaque commemorates him today as Micheál Ó Cinnéide, Uncle of the former Government Minister Michael O'Kennedy. The Modreeny Ambush took place on the 3 June 1921, during the Irish War of Independence. The ambush was an attack on an RIC and Black and Tan patrol en route to the local Petty Sessions in Borrisokane Courthouse. It was committed by a Flying Column led by Sean Gaynor at Kylebeg Cross, between Borrisokane and Cloughjordan and resulted in the deaths of four RIC/ Black and Tan members. Later that same day, a branch of the Munster and Leinster Bank was robbed of £2,000. Borrisokane Courthouse and its jail were also burned. Local industry Situated as it is in the Great Plain of Lower Ormond, much of the land around Borrisokane is well suited to farm production. As such, the area has a strong agricultural history which continues to this day. During the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, Borrisokane was an important centre for wheat production. There was an active mill in the town, which was operational from 1810 until about 1940, the mill was demolished in April, 2010, an event which caused some local anger. Beside the site of the mill there is a lane known as 'Brewers Lane' suggesting there was previously a brewery here. Culture In his poem, The Faerie Queene, Edmund Spenser is said to have referred to the local hill of Knockshegowna. Knockshegowna (Irish: Cnoc Sí Úna) translated literally means 'The Hill of Fairy Una'. In Spenser's poem, Úna, the personification of the \\"True Church\\" travels with the Redcrosse Knight (who represents England), whom she has recruited to save her parents' castle from a dragon. Knockshegowna Hill and its supposed fairies is also the subject of Richard D'Alton Williams' poem The Fairies of Knockshegowna and The Legend of Knockshegowna by Thomas Crofton Croker. In 1930, the David Clarke Memorial Hall was opened in Borrisokane, dedicated to the memory of the town's then most prominent Landlord, David Clarke. The Hall is still used today for the staging of musical and theatrical productions and is also the location of the towns cineclub. 2009 saw the opening of Tess Burkes. It has since established itself as a popular live music venue attracting up and coming bands from all over the country. The book Stella Days: The Life and Times of a Rural Irish Cinema was written by Michael Doorley. It is based on the true story of how Borrisokane's small cinema came to being in the 1950s. In 2011 Stella Days, the movie based on the book, was released. Filming, however, took place in the town of Fethard rather than Borrisokane. The movie was shown to an invited audience in the Clarke Memorial Hall on 24 March 2012.Nenagh Guardian, 24 March 2012, p. 18, columns 6 and 7 Town Park A public park on both sides of the Ballyfinboy river. The park was created and financed by the townspeople rather than the council. Borrisokane forest Borrisokane forest extends northwards from the R445 road to Portumna and from Lough Derg to the County Offaly border. The forest consists of several small, widely dispersed areas of woodland. Coillte manages the forest which includes amongst others Sopwell woods and Knockanacree woods near Cloghjordan. Sport Borrisokane FC are based at the Community Sports Grounds. Playing in Red and Black shirts, sponsored by The Green Bar public house, the club fields multiple teams at both youth and senior level. In March 2016 the 1st XI, under the management of Matty Power, secured the Division 1 League championship losing just one game all season and finishing in style with an 8-1 demolition of Ballymacky. The Borrisokane GAA club is based at Páirc Gairnéir and their colours are green and white. In 2010 they won the Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Championship and were unlucky to lose out in the Munster Intermediate Hurling Championship. In 2009, Borrisokane won the inaugural North Tipperary Junior C Hurling Championship. The Borrisokane Athletic Club caters for athletes from age 8 to senior. Athletes from this small town club have travelled the world representing their country and can boast over 100 National titles throughout its 30 years. Most recently the club's success has come from the senior ladies who were crowned National League Champions in 2008. Cycling in the town is on one of the North Tipperary Cycle Routes. This 65 km route starts at Banba Square, Nenagh and is listed as a half day cycle. Horse Racing: races associated with the Ormond Hunt pack were first held at Borrisokane on the farm of John Reddan at Kylenagoona, near Borrisokane in the year 1863. Meetings were held annually in June, July and August, with particularly keen competition for the Borrisokane Plate. Racing continued up until the early 1900s when it moved closer to the town. A song, 'The Kylenagoona Races' was composed in reference to Borrisokane's local horse racing. The town and district are today home to a number of well known equestrian personalities including former Irish champion jockey turned racehorse trainer Charlie Swan, who lives in nearby Cloughjordan.

Parties include the quinceañera (a sweet 15), the sweet 16, and other birthdays including a My Super Sweet 21 (which was broadcast during MTV's Spring Break party) and My Super Swag 18. The show aired on MTV from January 18, 2005, to September 11, 2017. The opening theme is \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" sung by Hilary Duff. Spin-offs The series had two spin- offs, Exiled and The Real Deal, which have both ended their run by 2010. The show has also covered a number of celebrity coming of age parties. Bow Wow, Sean Kingston, Aly & AJ, Chris Brown, Soulja Boy Tell Em and Teyana Taylor have all had their parties featured on the show. A United Kingdom version of the program was also produced, and also a Spanish version entitled \\"Quiero mis quinces\\" or \\"Super Dulces 16\\" produced by MTV. In 2008, MTV launched a spinoff titled Exiled. On the show, a number of parents of participants on My Super Sweet 16 banish their teens to remote countries in order to see if their \\"sweet sixteener\\" will survive the harsh conditions.Exiled, MTV homepage In 2009, MTV announced their newest addition to the franchise, My Super Psycho Sweet 16, a horror movie based on the concept of the show, which was aired on October 23, 2009 and followed by two sequels: Part 2 (2010) and Part 3 (2012). In March 2010, MTV International commissioned Maverick TV in the UK to make a new, international version of the Super Sweet franchise. Casting has begun globally on a series of 10 episodes, and interested parties are encouraged to go to the casting website. The brand has been extended to include people having birthdays aged 13–24. The series has also ended its run. Reception In retrospect, Bustle identified \\"the main 14 elements [or tropes] which happened in most episodes which made it the supernova of a show that it truly is\\", including: * \\"birthday tantrum[s]\\" (\\"the birthday boy or girl would be crying, screaming, stomping, or complaining about the fact that it's their birthday and they'll do what they want\\") * the birthday boy or girl's \\"constant belligerence\\" against their parents in demanding more money * \\"excessively decadent outfits\\" * the party planner who is \\"tasked with organizing these unachievable birthday parties\\" * overrunning the party budget * \\"the obligatory party fight\\" when uninvited guests turn up * large, expensive cars as birthday gifts * a musical celebrity guest performing at the party Bobcat Goldthwait noted that watching the My Super Sweet 16 marathon inspired him to write his controversial film God Bless America. Prior to attaining stardom in film, Jennifer Lawrence made her on-screen acting debut in an advertisement for the series depicting a fictional scenario (she never appeared in the series proper). =Criticism= English satirist Charlie Brooker gave a light-hearted criticism of the show on BBC4's Screenwipe, calling it \\"a stonehearted exposé of everything that's wrong with our faltering so-called civilization.\\" He describes the protagonists by saying that \\"Each episode follows an unbelievably spoiled rich and tiny sod as they prepare to throw a despicably opulent coming of age party for themselves and their squealing shitcake friends.\\" He said the show \\"might be an Al-Qaeda recruitment film.\\" However, he added that \\"that's exactly how the show wants you to feel - it's even more effective at creating instant hate figures than Big Brother, and that's saying something.\\"Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe, Series 4 Episode 4 One teenager (Audrey Reyes) is seen screaming at her mother and saying she \\"hates\\" her after having received a new Lexus SC430, costing US$67,000, that was not on the day of the party. However, after the episode aired, she apologized for the tantrum. In popular culture * Hip-Hop artist Common made reference to the show as well as Exiled in a line from his single \\"The Game\\", 'Watching Sweet Sixteen, Bitchin-ass rich kids Who don't know in life you gotta go the distance'. * In the film Bratz, a character named Meredith throws a Super Sweet 16 Party, and has MTV film it. * The show was parodied on an episode of Comedy Central's South Park (\\"Hell on Earth 2006\\"), broadcast on October 25, 2006. Satan was intent on throwing an over-the-top Halloween bash. His behavior reflected that of the sweet 16ers preparing for their coming-of-age birthdays. In the end, when Satan realizes his folly, the audience considers the sweet 16ers to be \\"worse than Satan.\\"Comedy Central's South Park spoofs My Super Sweet 16, broadcast on October 25, 2006 - TV.com This is a reflection of the creators' disdain for the show, which they claim is just as offensive as South Park except that, where South Park satirizes offensive behavior, My Super Sweet 16 celebrates it, stating, \\"that is probably the most disgusting, foul show ever made.\\" He went on to say that \\"where we would be ripping on the people acting like that, on My Super Sweet 16 the girls act that horrible and they're celebrated for it at the end, teaching little girls around the country that that's how you should act.\\" Trey Parker further commented, \\"I can say.....every single girl that has been on that show, My Super Sweet 16, is evil. Is an evil horrible person. It's just that simple.\\" * In 2016, on the occasion of his 60th birthday, US actor Bryan Cranston (known for his role as Walter White in Breaking Bad) featured in a parody titled \\"My Super Sweet 60\\" for the Jimmy Kimmel Live! show, with Kimmel as party planner and various guest stars including musician Sisqo. * The show was parodied in the fourth season of Robot Chicken in a sketch titled \\"Annie's Super Sweet 16\\". The segment follows the format of the show with the episode featuring Annie Warbucks from the Little Orphan Annie comic strip. * On the sister channel Tr3s, the show Quiero Mis Quinces showcases the Latin American traditions of planning a quinceañera. Broadcast In June 2018, it was announced that the series will stream on Hulu. It also currently airs on MTV Teen on the Pluto TV service. As of July 15, 2019, TeenNick started airing the series.

It means that the output of a circuit may be available as soon as sufficient inputs have arrived to allow it to be determined. For example, if all of the inputs to a mux have arrived, and all are the same, but the select line has not yet arrived, the circuit can still produce an output. Since all the inputs are identical, the select line is irrelevant. Example: an asynchronous ripple-carry adder A ripple carry adder is a simple adder circuit, but slow because the carry signal has to propagate through each stage of the adder: A ripple carry adder schematic This diagram shows a 5-bit ripple carry adder in action. There is a five-stage long carry path, so every time two numbers are added with this adder, it needs to wait for the carry to propagate through all five stages. By switching to dual-rail signalling for the carry bit, it can have each stage signal its carry out as soon as it knows. If both inputs to a stage are 1, then the carry out will be 1 no matter what the carry in is. If both inputs are 0, then the carry out will be zero. This early completion cuts down on the maximum length of the carry chain in most cases: A delay insensitive ripple carry adder schematic Two of the carry-out bits can be known as soon as input arrives, for the input shown in the picture. This means that the maximum carry chain length is three, not five. If it uses dual-rail signalling for inputs and outputs, it can indicate completion as soon as all the carry chains have completed. On average, an n-bit asynchronous ripple carry adder will finish in O(log n) time. By extending this approach to carry look-ahead adders, it is possible to add in O(log log n) time.

He is also called Maximos the Hagiorite (),; . as well as Maximus the Philosopher.. His signature was Maximus Grecus Lakedaimon (lit. Maximus the Greek of, and originating from, Lakedaimonia) and his family origins were probably from Mystras, a location in Laconia, which was the geographical site of Ancient Sparta in the Peloponnese. Early years Maximus was born Michael Trivolis (, ) circa 1475 in Arta, then in the Ottoman Empire, the scion of a noble Greek family with ties to the Byzantine emperor in Constantinople,.. and originating from Sparta. Both Maximus's parents were Christian Greeks; his mother was Irene and his father, Manuel, was a voivode. Irene and Manuel left Constantinople together for Arta and the latter may have been a Byzantine military governor of Arta before the city fell to the Ottomans in 1449. Demetrios Trivolis, Manuel's brother and Maximus's uncle, was a Greek scribe who self-identified as \\"a Peloponnesian from Sparta\\" ().. In 1461–1462, Demetrios reproduced a manuscript of Plato's Timaeus while in Corfu and in 1465, he copied Plotinus's Enneads while in Crete; after his completion of Plato's work, Demetrius wrote the following note: \\"\\" which translates as: \\"The present book was written by my own hand of Demetrios Trivolis Peloponnesian from Sparta who made these works in the island of the Kerkyreans after the fall of our fatherland\\" (referencing the fall of his native Laconia to the Ottomans). In another note, Demetrios writes: \\"\\" which translates as: \\"This most beautiful book of mine is property of Demetrios Trivolis Peloponnesian from Sparta. I bought it after the fall of our fatherland Lacedaemonia, which was once fortunate.\\" The Trivolis family was later associated with the Palaiologos dynasty in Mystras.. Maximus studied on the island of Corfu under the supervision of John Moschos and John Lascaris and later went with Lascaris to Florence (in 1492 or 1493) and continued his studies in Bologna, Florence, Ferrara, Milan, Padua, and Venice.; ; . While in Italy, he studied ancient languages, as well as ecclesiastic and philosophic works (especially Neoplatonism). He knew prominent figures of the Renaissance era such as the Venetian printer Aldus Manutius and made the acquaintance of scholars Angelo Poliziano, Marsilio Ficino, Pico della Mirandola, Scipio Callerges, and Fonteguerri.; . Maximus was also greatly influenced by the preachings of the fiery Dominican priest and reformer Girolamo Savonarola whose ashes he gathered in 1498.; ; . Career In 1504 (according to other accounts, 1505 or early 1506), Maximus left the Dominican monastery of St. Mark and went to Mount Athos where he took monastic vows at the Monastery of Vatopedi in 1507.; ; . In 1515, Grand Prince Vasili III asked the abbot of the monastery to send him a certain monk by the name of Savva to translate a number of religious texts. Savva was so old that the abbot decided to send the energetic Maximus instead, though he had no knowledge of the Church Slavonic language. Nevertheless, the monks vouched for him, and he went to Moscow, where he was met with great honor.. Upon arriving in Moscow in 1518, Maximus headed the movement of religious reform.. In 1518, Maximus met Prince Kurbskii, who later wrote about Maximus and his time in Moscow in Skazanie o Maksime Filosofe (The Tale of Maxim the Philosopher). In this work, Kurbskii describes a meeting between Maximus and Vasili III whereupon Maximus was astonished at the countless multitudes of Greek books displayed at Vasili III's court. Maximus assured the Prince that he had never seen so many Greek works in Greece itself. This testimony is the earliest known reference of a collection of ancient manuscripts belonging to the Russian Tsars which has never been found, also referred to as The Lost Library of the Moscow Tsars. This lost library later became a favorite research topic of early twentieth century Russian archaeologist Ignatius Stelletskii. Assignment to Moscow Maximus's first major work in Russia was a translation of the Psalter together with the Russian translators (including the scholar Dmitry Gerasimov) and scriveners, which would be solemnly approved by the Russian clergy and the grand prince himself. After Vasili III rejected his request to go home, Maximus continued to work on translations and correcting the books for divine service. Observing the \\"defects\\" and injustices of Muscovite life, which seemed to him in direct opposition to his Christian ideals, Maximus began to expose them and criticize the authorities, attracting different people with similar views, such as Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev, Vassian Patrikeyev, and others. With regards to the question of monastic estates, which had already divided the Russian clergy into two antagonistic camps (the Possessors and the Non-Possessors), Maximus took sides with Nilus of Sors and his startsy, who headed the Non-Possessors camp.. This would make him one of the worst enemies of the Josephites, who stood for the right of the monasteries to own land. Maximus and his followers discussed freely the shortcomings of Russia's internal and foreign policies, criticized the lifestyle of the Russian clergy, exploitation of peasants, and the system of supporting local authorities by \\"milking\\" the peasants (the so-called кормление, or kormleniye). Imprisonment Maximus the Greek has been held in the greatest repute by Old Believers, and his images are normally featured in every Old Believer church. Maximus's relations with Vassian Patrikeyev, Ivan Bersen-Beklemishev, and Turkish ambassador Skinder, Metropolitan Daniel's hostility towards him, and Greek's own negative attitude towards Vasili III's intention to divorce Solomonia Saburova decided his fate. A sobor in 1525 accused Maximus of nonconformism and heresy based on his views and translations of ecclesiastic books, disregarding his incomplete knowledge of Russian and obvious mistakes on the part of the Russian scriveners (his improper use of the imperfect tense was used to imply that he no longer believed the Holy Spirit was the Third Person of the Trinity but only had been temporarily). He was then exiled to the Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery and placed in a dungeon without the right to take communion or correspond. Maximus's \\"irritating\\" behavior at the monastery, newly discovered mistakes in his translations, and old suspicions of his unscrupulous relations with the now dead Turkish ambassador were all used against him once again at a new sobor in 1531. Worn out by the harsh conditions of his imprisonment, Maximus acknowledged some minor mistakes in his translations and excessive wine drinking. Finally, the sobor banned him from receiving communion and exiled him to the Otroch Monastery in Tver, where he would spend his next twenty years. The Patriarch of Antioch, Patriarch of Constantinople, and Patriarch of Jerusalem all attempted to negotiate Maximus's release with the Russian authorities, but to no avail. He himself pleaded with Ivan the Terrible (r. 1547–1584) and Metropolitan Macarius for his freedom. Moscow was afraid of Maximus's ability to expose wrongdoings and criticize the powers that be and, therefore, was reluctant to let him go. In 1551 (or 1553 according to other accounts), Maximus was transferred to the Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra at the solicitation of some boyars and Hegumen Artemiy of the lavra. That same year, according to some accounts, the tsar is said to have visited Maximus during his pilgrimage to Kirillo-Belozersky Monastery; Maximus is described as having advised the ruler to take care of the families of soldiers who died in the conquest of Kazan instead of merely praying for the dead. In 1554, Maximus was invited to join a sobor, which would deal with the heresy of Matvei Bashkin, but he refused, being wary of getting entangled in this case. Death Maximus died in 1556 in Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra, Sergiyev Posad. He is buried in the Refectory Church in the Lavra. Legacy Maximus left a voluminous body of original writings and translations into Russian Church Slavonic. He spent a great deal of energy and ink in his efforts to prove his innocence and Orthodoxy. He interpreted and explained for his Muscovite readers a large number of points of ancient and Biblical history, Orthodox Church practice and teachings, and features of the contemporary world outside of Muscovy. For example, he was the first to bring the discovery of the New World to the attention of Muscovite readers. He is considered a saint by the Eastern Orthodox Church, which commemorates him on 21 January.

In the form of a dialogue, the Sceptical Chymist presented Boyle's hypothesis that matter consisted of corpuscles and clusters of corpuscles in motion and that every phenomenon was the result of collisions of particles in motion. Boyle also objected to the definitions of elemental bodies propounded by Aristotle and by Paracelsus, instead defining elements as \\"perfectly unmingled bodies\\" (see below). For these reasons Robert Boyle has sometimes been called the founder of modern chemistry. (2nd edition) Contents The first part of the book begins with 5 friends (Carneades the host and the Skeptic, Philoponus the Chymist, Themistius the Aristotelian, Eleutherius the impartial Judge, and an unnamed narrator) meeting in Carneades's garden and chatting about the constituents of mixed bodies. In part one, Carneades (Boyle) lays out four propositions to the gathering, which sets the foundation for the rest of the book. They are as follows: :Proposition I. :It seems not absurd to conceive that at the first production of mixt bodies, the universal matter whereof they among other parts of the universe consisted, was actually divided into little particles of several sizes and shapes variously moved. :Proposition II. :Neither is it impossible that of these minute particles divers of the smallest and neighboring ones were here and there associated into minute masses or clusters, and did by their coalitions constitute great store of such little primary concretions or masses as were not easily dissipable into such particles as composed them.R. Boyle (1661) The Sceptical Chymist, page 30 :Proposition III. :I shall not peremptorily deny, that from most such mixt bodies as partake either of animals or vegetable nature, there may by the help of the fire be actually obtained a determinate number (whether three, four, or five, or fewer or more) of substances, worthy of differing denominations. :Proposition IV. :It may likewise be granted, that those distinct substances, which concretes generally either afford or are made up of, may without very much inconvenience be called the elements or principles of them.R. Boyle (1661) The Sceptical Chymist, page 34 Major themes Boyle first argued that fire is not a universal and sufficient analyzer of dividing all bodies into their elements, contrary to Jean Beguin and Joseph Duchesne. To prove this he turned for support to Jan Baptist van Helmont whose Alkahest was reputed to be a universal analyzer. Boyle rejected the Aristotelian theory of the four elements (earth, air, fire, and water) and also the three principles (salt, sulfur, and mercury) proposed by Paracelsus. After discussing the classical elements and chemical principles in the first five parts of the book, in the sixth part Boyle defines chemical element in a manner that approaches more closely to the modern concept: :I now mean by Elements, as those Chymists that speak plainest do by their Principles, certain Primitive and Simple, or perfectly unmingled bodies; which not being made of any other bodies, or of one another, are the Ingredients of all those call'd perfectly mixt Bodies are immediately compounded, and into which they are ultimately resolved.R. Boyle (1661) The Sceptical Chymist, page 350 However, Boyle denied that any known material substances correspond to such \\"perfectly unmingled bodies.\\" In his view, all known materials were compounds, even such substances as gold, silver, lead, sulfur, and carbon. Influence According to E. J. Dijksterhuis, \\"After the appearance of The Sceptical Chymist Aristotle’s doctrine of the four elements as well as Paracelsus’ theory of the three principia gradually passes into disuse.\\"E. J. Dijksterhuis , C. Dikshoorn translator (1961) The Mechanization of the World Picture, page 435, Oxford University Press via Internet Archive The book's influence can be discerned in Nicholas Brady's reference to \\"jarring seeds\\" in his Ode to St. Cecilia (set by Henry Purcell in 1691, well before Daniel Bernoulli's kinetic theory): :Soul of the World! Inspir'd by thee, :The jarring Seeds of Matter did agree, :Thou didst the scatter'd Atoms bind, :Which, by thy Laws of true proportion join'd, :Made up of various Parts one perfect Harmony.

Clock gating saves power by pruning the clock tree, at the cost of adding more logic to a circuit. Pruning the clock disables portions of the circuitry so that the flip-flops in them do not have to switch states. Switching states consumes power. When not being switched, the switching power consumption goes to zero, and only leakage currents are incurred. Although asynchronous circuits by definition do not have a \\"clock\\", the term perfect clock gating is used to illustrate how various clock gating techniques are simply approximations of the data-dependent behavior exhibited by asynchronous circuitry. As the granularity on which one gates the clock of a synchronous circuit approaches zero, the power consumption of that circuit approaches that of an asynchronous circuit: the circuit only generates logic transitions when it is actively computing. Details Clock gating works by taking the enable conditions attached to registers, and uses them to gate the clocks. A design must contain these enable conditions in order to use and benefit from clock gating. This clock gating process can also save significant die area as well as power, since it removes large numbers of muxes and replaces them with clock gating logic. This clock gating logic is generally in the form of \\"integrated clock gating\\" (ICG) cells. However, the clock gating logic will change the clock tree structure, since the clock gating logic will sit in the clock tree. Clock gating logic can be added into a design in a variety of ways: # Coded into the register transfer level (RTL) code as enable conditions that can be automatically translated into clock gating logic by synthesis tools (fine grain clock gating). # Inserted into the design manually by the RTL designers (typically as module level clock gating) by instantiating library specific integrated clock gating (ICG) cells to gate the clocks of specific modules or registers. # Semi-automatically inserted into the RTL by automated clock gating tools. These tools either insert ICG cells into the RTL, or add enable conditions into the RTL code. These typically also offer sequential clock gating optimisations. Any RTL modifications to improve clock gating will result in functional changes to the design (since the registers will now hold different values) which need to be verified. Sequential clock gating is the process of extracting/propagating the enable conditions to the upstream/downstream sequential elements, so that additional registers can be clock gated. Chip intended to run on batteries or with very low power such as those used in the mobile phones, wearable devices, etc. would implement several forms of clock gating together. At one end is the manual gating of clocks by software, where a driver enables or disables the various clocks used by a given idle controller. On the other end is automatic clock gating, where the hardware can be told to detect whether there's any work to do, and turn off a given clock if it is not needed. These forms interact with each other and may be part of the same enable tree. For example, an internal bridge or bus might use automatic gating so that it is gated off until the CPU or a DMA engine needs to use it, while several of the peripherals on that bus might be permanently gated off if they are unused on that board.

Also known by the English name National Foundation Day, this holiday celebrates the legendary formation of the first Korean state of Gojoseon in 2333 BC. This date has traditionally been regarded as the date for the founding of the Korean people. Gaecheonjeol is also recognized in North Korea, although not as a public holiday, with an annual ceremony at the Mausoleum of Tangun, the founder of Gojoseon.  Origin  Gae-cheon (\\"Opening of Heaven\\") refers to 3 October 2457 BCE, the date when Hwanung (환웅) descended from heaven to live with mankind.개천절(Gaecheonjeol) Encyclopedia of Korean Culture The harvest ceremony was celebrated in the Korean realms; Yeonggo (영고,迎鼓 ) of Buyeo; Mucheon (무천,舞天) of Yemaek; Gyeeum (계음,契飮) of Mahan and Byeonhan; Dongmaeng (동맹,東盟) of Goguryeo; and Palgwanhoe (팔관회,八關會) of Silla. In 1909, Gaecheonjeol was established as a national holiday.개천절(Gaecheonjeol) Doosan Encyclopedia At first, the holiday was observed on the third day of the 10th month on the lunar calendar, but it has been fixed on 3 October of the solar Gregorian calendar since 1949.  History  On 15 January, 1909, when Daejongism reopened its gate with Nachul at the center, it was established as a celebration day and celebrated every year. Events like this contributed to fostering the spirit of the Korean people under the pressure of Japanese colonial rule. When the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was established in 1919, the provisional government established 3 October of the lunar calendar as a national holiday. This is based on the universal perception of history, which saw Dangun as the founder of the Hankyoreh at the time and Gojoseon as the first nation of the Korean people. Following the establishment of the Republic of Korea after Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, the Dangungiwon(단군기원, 檀君紀元), or dan-gi(단기,檀紀), was enacted as the official calendar of the nation in the \\"Act on official calendars\\" on 25 September 1948. On 1 October 1949, the \\"Act on National Day of celebration\\" was enacted and the date of the third lunar month was designated as the Gaecheonjeol. Since it was originally a lunar calendar, it had been used as a lunar calendar even after the establishment of the Korean government, but after the deliberation of the \\"Deliberation Council regarding the change of celebrations of gaecheonjeol from the lunar calendar to the solar calendar,\\" which was appointed by the Culture and Education Ministry in 1949, it changed the lunar calendar into a solar calendar and became a great practice as it was said that the records of October 3 were precious. On the other hand, Daejongism believes that the original meaning of the word \\"Gaecheon\\" is not Dangun's founding day, but the third day of the lunar month of October 2457 BC, when Hwanung opened the sky gate and came down below Sin Dansu, Taebaek Mountain, and began the great work of 'Hongikingan'(弘益人間, translated as \\"to widely benefit the humans\\") and 'Yihwasegye'(理化世界,translated as \\"ruling the word with reason\\").  National Foundation Day Song  The song was originally sung by people who were believers of Daejongism. After the National Foundation Day becomes as a national holiday, the lyrics were changed as it is sung nowadays.https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0001734 The lyrics are as follows.https://news.joins.com/article/23015733 Section 1 우리가 물이라면 새암이 있고 If we are water, we would have a fountain that we originated from. 우리가 나무라면 뿌리가 있다.

It was designed in 1651 by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for Pope Innocent X whose family palace, the Palazzo Pamphili, faced onto the piazza as did the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone of which Innocent was the sponsor. The base of the fountain is a basin from the centre of which travertine rocks rise to support four river gods and above them, a copy of an Egyptian obelisk surmounted with the Pamphili family emblem of a dove with an olive twig. Collectively, they represent four major rivers of the four continents through which papal authority had spread: the Nile representing Africa, the Danube representing Europe, the Ganges representing Asia, and the Río de la Plata representing the Americas. Design Bernini's design was selected in competition. The circumstances of his victory are described as follows in Filippo Baldinucci's The life of Cavaliere Bernini (1682): Public fountains in Rome served multiple purposes: first, they were highly needed sources of water for neighbors in the centuries prior to home plumbing. Second, they were monuments to the papal patrons. Earlier Bernini fountains had been the Fountain of the Triton in Piazza Barberini, the Fountain of the Moor in the southern end of Piazza Navona erected during the Barberini papacy, and the Neptune and Triton for Villa Peretti Montalto, whose statuary now resides at Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi detail showing the river-god Ganges Each has animals and plants that further carry forth identification, and each carries a certain number of allegories and metaphors with it. The Ganges carries a long oar, representing the river's navigability. The Nile's head is draped with a loose piece of cloth, meaning that no one at that time knew exactly where the Nile's source was. The Danube touches the Pope's personal coat of arms, since it is the large river closest to Rome. And the Río de la Plata is sitting on a pile of coins, a symbol of the riches America could offer to Europe (the word plata means \\"silver\\" in Spanish). Also, the Río de la Plata looks scared by a snake, showing rich men's fear that their money could be stolen. Each is a river god, semi- prostrate, in awe of the central tower, epitomized by the slender Egyptian obelisk, symbolizing Papal power surmounted by the Pamphili symbol (dove). In addition, the fountain is a theater in the round, a spectacle of action, that can be strolled around. Water flows and splashes from a jagged and pierced mountainous disorder of travertine marble. A legend, common with tour-guides, is that Bernini positioned the cowering Rio de la Plata River as if the sculpture was fearing the facade of the church of Sant'Agnese by his rival Borromini; in reality, the fountain was completed several years before Borromini began work on the church. The obelisk, made of Aswan granite, has an interesting history. It is connected with the emperor Domitian, and was originally thought to have come from the Serapeum, which the emperor rebuilt in A.D. 80. However, it is equally plausible that the obelisk might have originated from the Temple of the Gens Flavia on the Quirinal Hill, built by Domitian dedicated to his family cult. The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the obelisk were of Roman authorship, offering a hymn to Domitian, and the deified emperors Vespasian and Titus, possibly on the occasion of something being restored. In the fourth century, the obelisk was relocated to the Circus of the emperor Maxentius, located between the Church of St. Sebastian and the tomb of Cecilia Metella along the Appian Way, where it was found and moved to the Fountain. The circus – as well as the nearby villa and mausoleum – was first believed to be attributed to the emperor Caracalla, until excavations carried out by Antonio Nibby in 1825, in which an inscription identifying the ownership of the site was found. At each of the four sites of the obelisk is a tablet, containing Kircher's translation into Latin of its hieroglyphs. The dynamic fusion of architecture and sculpture made this fountain revolutionary when compared to prior Roman projects, such as the stilted designs Acqua Felice and Paola by Domenico Fontana in Piazza San Bernardo (1585–87) or the customary embellished geometric floral-shaped basin below a jet of water such as the Fontanina in Piazza Campitelli (1589) by Giacomo della Porta. Bernini's design was influenced by the design of the Monument of the Four Moors (Monumento dei Quattro mori) and it may have also been influenced by a fountain in Marino, Lazio which was constructed to commemorate the defeat of the Ottomans at Lepanto in 1571. This fountain was the inspiration to Francesco Robba (1698–1757) for the Robba fountain, which stands (since 2006 as a replica) at Town Square in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia. It is one of the city's most recognisable symbols. Unveiling The Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi was unveiled to the populace of Rome on 12 June 1651. According to a report from the time, an event was organised to draw people to the Piazza Navona. Beforehand, wooden scaffolding, overlaid with curtains, had hidden the fountain, though probably not the obelisk, which would have given people an idea that something was being built, but the precise details were unknown. Once unveiled, the full majesty of the fountain would be apparent, which the celebrations were designed to advertise. The festival was paid for by the Pamphili family, to be specific, Innocent X, who had sponsored the erection of the fountain. The most conspicuous item on the Pamphili crest, an olive branch, was brandished by the performers who took part in the event. The author of the report, Antonio Bernal, takes his readers through the hours leading up to the unveiling. The celebrations were announced by a woman, dressed as the allegorical character of Fame, being paraded around the streets of Rome on a carriage or float. She was sumptuously dressed, with wings attached to her back and a long trumpet in her hand. Bernal notes that \\"she went gracefully through all the streets and all the districts that are found among the seven hills of Rome, often blowing the round bronze [the trumpet], and urging everyone to make their way to that famous Piazza.\\" A second carriage followed her; this time another woman was dressed as the allegorical figure of Curiosity. According to the report, she continued exhorting the people to go towards the piazza. Bernal describes the clamour and noise of the people as they discussed the upcoming event. The report is actually less detailed about the process of publicly unveiling the fountain. However, it does give ample descriptions of the responses of the spectators who had gathered in the Piazza. Once there, Bernal notes, the citizens of the city were overwhelmed by the massive fountain, with its huge lifelike figures. The report mentions the \\"enraptured souls\\" of the population, the fountain, which \\"gushes out a wealth of silvery treasures\\" causing \\"no little wonder\\" in the onlookers. Bernal then continues to describe the fountain, making continuous reference to the seeming naturalism of the figures and its astonishing effect on those in the piazza. Fountain of the Four Rivers by night – river god Ganges in the front. The making of the fountain was met by opposition by the people of Rome for several reasons. First, Innocent X had the fountain built at public expense during the intense famine of 1646–48. Throughout the construction of the fountain, the city murmured and talk of riot was in the air. Pasquinade writers protested the construction of the fountain in September 1648 by attaching hand-written invectives on the stone blocks used to make the obelisk. These pasquinades read, \\"We do not want Obelisks and Fountains, It is bread that we want. Bread, Bread, Bread!\\" Innocent quickly had the authors arrested, and disguised spies patrol the Pasquino statue and Piazza Navona.the diary of Giacinto Gigli, Diario di Rome, vol. II, pp. 533–34. The streetvendors of the market also opposed the construction of the fountain, as Innocent X expelled them from the piazza. The Pamphilij pope believed they detracted from the magnificence of the square. The vendors refused to move, and the papal police had to chase them from the piazza. Roman Jews, in particular, lamented the closing of the Navona, since they were allowed to sell used articles of clothing there at the Wednesday market.Francesco Cancellieri, Il Mercato, il Lago dell'Acqua Vergine, ed il Palazzo Panfiliano nel circo agonale, detto volgarmente Piazza Navona.

Radio waves can be radiated from an antenna by accelerating electrons in the antenna. This is a coherent process, so the total power radiated is proportional to the square of the number of electrons accelerating. In electrodynamics, the Larmor formula is used to calculate the total power radiated by a non relativistic point charge as it accelerates. It was first derived by J. J. Larmor in 1897, Formula is mentioned in the text on the last page. in the context of the wave theory of light. When any charged particle (such as an electron, a proton, or an ion) accelerates, it radiates away energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. For velocities that are small relative to the speed of light, the total power radiated is given by the Larmor formula: : P = {2 over 3} frac{q^2 a^2}{ 4 pi varepsilon_0 c^3}= frac{q^2 a^2}{6 pi varepsilon_0 c^3} mbox{ (SI units)} : P = {2 over 3} frac{q^2 a^2}{ c^3} mbox{ (cgs units)} where a is the proper acceleration, q is the charge, and c is the speed of light. A relativistic generalization is given by the Liénard–Wiechert potentials. In either unit system, the power radiated by a single electron can be expressed in terms of the classical electron radius and electron mass as: : P = {2 over 3} frac{m_e r_e a^2}{c} One implication is that an electron orbiting around a nucleus, as in the Bohr model, should lose energy, fall to the nucleus and the atom should collapse. This puzzle was not solved until quantum theory was introduced.  Derivation  =Derivation 1: Mathematical approach (using CGS units) = We first need to find the form of the electric and magnetic fields. The fields can be written (for a fuller derivation see Liénard–Wiechert potential) : mathbf{E}(mathbf{r},t) = qleft(frac{mathbf{n}-boldsymbol{beta}}{gamma^2(1-boldsymbol{beta}cdotmathbf{n})^3 R^2}right)_{rm{ret}} + frac{q}{c}left(frac{mathbf{n}times[(mathbf{n}-boldsymbol{beta})timesdot{boldsymbol{beta}}]}{(1-boldsymbol{beta}cdotmathbf{n})^3R}right)_{rm{ret}} and : mathbf{B} = mathbf{n}timesmathbf{E}, where boldsymbol{beta} is the charge's velocity divided by c, dot{boldsymbol{beta}} is the charge's acceleration divided by c, mathbf{n} is a unit vector in the mathbf{r} - mathbf{r}_0 direction, R is the magnitude of mathbf{r} - mathbf{r}_0, mathbf{r}_0 is the charge's location, and gamma = (1 - beta^2 )^{-1/2} . The terms on the right are evaluated at the retarded time t_text{r} = t - R/c. The right-hand side is the sum of the electric fields associated with the velocity and the acceleration of the charged particle. The velocity field depends only upon boldsymbol{beta} while the acceleration field depends on both boldsymbol{beta} and dot{boldsymbol{beta}} and the angular relationship between the two. Since the velocity field is proportional to 1/R^2, it falls off very quickly with distance. On the other hand, the acceleration field is proportional to 1/R, which means that it falls much more slowly with distance. Because of this, the acceleration field is representative of the radiation field and is responsible for carrying most of the energy away from the charge. We can find the energy flux density of the radiation field by computing its Poynting vector: :mathbf{S} = frac{c}{4pi}mathbf{E}_text{a}timesmathbf{B}_text{a}, where the 'a' subscripts emphasize that we are taking only the acceleration field. Substituting in the relation between the magnetic and electric fields while assuming that the particle instantaneously at rest at time t_text{r} and simplifying givesThe case where betaleft(t_text{r}right) eq 0 is more complicated and is treated, for example, in Griffiths's Introduction to Electrodynamics. :mathbf{S} = frac{q^2}{4pi c}leftfrac{mathbf{n}times(mathbf{n}timesdot{boldsymbol{beta}})}{R}right^2 mathbf{n} . If we let the angle between the acceleration and the observation vector be equal to theta, and we introduce the acceleration mathbf{a} = dot{boldsymbol{beta}} c, then the power radiated per unit solid angle is :frac{dP}{dOmega} = frac{q^2}{4pi c}frac{sin^2(theta), a^2}{c^2}. The total power radiated is found by integrating this quantity over all solid angles (that is, over theta and phi). This gives :P = frac{2}{3}frac{q^2 a^2}{c^3}, which is the Larmor result for a non-relativistic accelerated charge. It relates the power radiated by the particle to its acceleration. It clearly shows that the faster the charge accelerates the greater the radiation will be. We would expect this since the radiation field is dependent upon acceleration. =Derivation 2: Edward M. Purcell approach= The full derivation can be found here.Purcell Simplified Here is an explanation which can help understanding the above page. This approach is based on the finite speed of light. A charge moving with constant velocity has a radial electric field E_r (at distance R from the charge), always emerging from the future position of the charge, and there is no tangential component of the electric field (E_t=0). This future position is completely deterministic as long as the velocity is constant. When the velocity of the charge changes, (say it bounces back during a short time) the future position \\"jumps\\", so from this moment and on, the radial electric field E_r emerges from a new position. Given the fact that the electric field must be continuous, a non-zero tangential component of the electric field E_t appears, which decreases like 1/R (unlike the radial component which decreases like 1/R^2). Hence, at large distances from the charge, the radial component is negligible relative to the tangential component, and in addition to that, fields which behave like 1/R^2 cannot radiate, because the Poynting vector associated with them will behave like 1/R^4. The tangential component comes out (SI units): : E_t = {{e a sin(theta)} over {4 pi varepsilon_0 c^2 R}}. And to obtain the Larmour formula, one has to integrate over all angles, at large distance R from the charge, the Poynting vector associated with E_t, which is: : mathbf{S} = mathbf{hat{r}} = {{e^2 a^2 sin^2(theta)} over {16 pi^2 varepsilon_0 c^3 R^2}} mathbf{hat{r}} giving (SI units) : P = {{e^2 a^2} over {6 pi varepsilon_0 c^3}}. This is mathematically equivalent to: : P = {{mu_0 e^2 a^2} over {6 pi c}}. Since c^2=1/mu_0 epsilon_0, we recover the result quoted at the top of the article, namely : P = {2 over 3} frac{q^2 a^2}{ 4 pi varepsilon_0 c^3}= frac{q^2 a^2}{6 pi varepsilon_0 c^3}. Relativistic generalization =Covariant form= Written in terms of momentum, , the non-relativistic Larmor formula is (in CGS units) : P = frac{2}{3}frac{q^2}{m^2 c^3} dot {mathbf p}^2. The power can be shown to be Lorentz invariant. Any relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula must therefore relate to some other Lorentz invariant quantity. The quantity dot{mathbf p}^2 appearing in the non-relativistic formula suggests that the relativistically correct formula should include the Lorentz scalar found by taking the inner product of the four-acceleration with itself [here is the four-momentum]. The correct relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula is (in CGS units) {dtau}frac{dp^{mu}}{dtau}.}} It can be shown that this inner product is given by :frac{dp_{mu}}{dtau}frac{dp^{mu}}{dtau} = beta^2left(frac{dp}{dtau}right)^2 - left(frac{d{mathbf p}}{dtau}right)^2, and so in the limit , it reduces to -dot{mathbf p}^2, thus reproducing the nonrelativistic case. =Non-covariant form= The above inner product can also be written in terms of and its time derivative. Then the relativistic generalization of the Larmor formula is (in CGS units) This is the Liénard result, which was first obtained in 1898. The gamma^6 means that when the Lorentz factor gamma=1/sqrt{1-beta^2} is very close to one (i.e. beta ll 1) the radiation emitted by the particle is likely to be negligible. However, as beta rightarrow 1 the radiation grows like gamma^6 as the particle tries to lose its energy in the form of EM waves. Also, when the acceleration and velocity are orthogonal the power is reduced by a factor of 1-beta^2=1/gamma^2, i.e. the factor gamma^6 becomes gamma^4. The faster the motion becomes the greater this reduction gets. We can use Liénard's result to predict what sort of radiation losses to expect in different kinds of motion. =Angular distribution= The angular distribution of radiated power is given by a general formula, applicable whether or not the particle is relativistic. In CGS units, this formula isJackson eq (14.38) :frac{d P}{dOmega} = frac{q^2}{4pi c} frac{mathbf{hat{n}} times [(mathbf{hat{n}} - boldsymbol{beta})times dot{boldsymbol{beta}}]^2}{(1-mathbf{hat{n}}cdotboldsymbol{beta})^5}, where mathbf{hat{n}} is a unit vector pointing from the particle towards the observer. In the case of linear motion (velocity parallel to acceleration), this simplifies toJackson eq (14.39) :frac{d P}{dOmega} = frac{q^2a^2}{4pi c^3}frac{sin^2 theta}{(1-beta costheta)^5}, where theta is the angle between the observer and the particle's motion. Issues and implications =Radiation reaction= The radiation from a charged particle carries energy and momentum. In order to satisfy energy and momentum conservation, the charged particle must experience a recoil at the time of emission. The radiation must exert an additional force on the charged particle. This force is known as the Abraham–Lorentz force in the nonrelativistic limit and the Abraham–Lorentz–Dirac force in the relativistic setting. =Atomic physics= A classical electron orbiting a nucleus experiences acceleration and should radiate. Consequently, the electron loses energy and the electron should eventually spiral into the nucleus. Atoms, according to classical mechanics, are consequently unstable. This classical prediction is violated by the observation of stable electron orbits. The problem is resolved with a quantum mechanical description of atomic physics, initially provided by the Bohr model. Classical solutions to the stability of electron orbitals can be demonstrated using Non-radiation conditionsNonradiation condition and in accordance with known physical laws.

Tin bounds were created by the miner (or 'bounder') pitching stones or turves at the four corners of the land he intended to work. The bounder was required to declare his bounds to the stannary court and to renew them annually by re-pitching the stones or turves. During the early history of mining, the bounder was also required to actually work the land for tin in order for the bounds to remain valid, although this requirement was diluted over time. Tin bounds did not confer any rights of ownership over the land, only protection against others mining for tin in the same plot of land. The arrangement applied only to tin, not to other metals or minerals. The bounder was required to pay the freeholder of the land a portion of the tin extracted. This portion was known as toll tin. Although tin bounding has never been abolished, the use of tin bounds as the mechanism for permitting and regulating the right to work for tin was later superseded by the use of mining setts.

The yearbook is Teocalli, named after the Aztec temple, and comes out once a year several months before summer break begins. Until June 2016, \\"Idea Magazine\\" was a student-run, biannual compilation of Mark Keppel students' work in literature and art, advised by AP English teacher Mrs. Patrice Flores. \\"U Magazine\\" is a registered student publications club, also advised by Mrs. Flores, for the school year 2016–2017. Architecture Mark Keppel High School is designed in the Streamline Moderne architectural style, a variant of the Art Deco, and a product of the Great Depression. While the Art Deco celebrated the mechanization of the Jazz Age with big, bold, vertical designs, exotic materials, and elaborate decorations, the Streamline Moderne was a more reserved and utilitarian style. The Streamline Moderne mimicked the fast, dynamic look of machines with sleek, aerodynamic and nautical forms, low horizontal designs, rounded corners, and shiny materials. The architecture of Mark Keppel High School features rounded corners in and outside the auditorium, on the staircase leading up to the front entrance, and in all the interior stairwells. Incised horizontal lines cut through the brick stringcourse which wraps the lower part of the building and the brick pillars between the windows. The stucco texture coat of the facade features designs that emphasize horizontal shapes; blocks between the windows on both floors and along the top of the building contribute to the geometric, yet sleek look of the building. The uppermost block is bounded by a horizontal brick band, and the building is crowned with a small inset ledge. Extra handrails are found in front of the windows in the second floor hallways, in front of the display cases around the administration offices, and on the north wing exterior staircase.

The three enamel on stainless steel murals entitled \\"Early California\\" decorate the exterior of the auditorium, and depict the founding of California as well as the regional features of Los Angeles County. The second image show the placement of the two smaller murals on the auditorium. The largest mural crowns the entrance to the auditorium and depicts the three main groups that colonized and populated California: the Spanish Conquistadors, the Catholic Missionaries, and American Pioneers. The mural features a golden California on a backdrop of green mountain ranges, dotted with golden Redwood trees, and capped with a large reflective stainless steel sun wrapped with a sunburst decoration. On the left, the Conquistador goes before his ship, claiming the new land in the name of Spain. In the center, a Missionary kneels down, gingerly placing a mission in Southern California. On the right, a Miner 49’er pans for gold while his wife holds their child and rifle, their covered wagons behind them. The two smaller murals are located on the southern facade of the auditorium, facing toward Hellman Ave. The mural in the center right depicts early Los Angeles County with the San Gabriel Mountains to the north, the San Gabriel Mission surrounded by orange groves in the center, a dairy farm with Cowboy below, and the Long Beach Harbor in the south. The mural on the right showcases the entire state of California. From north to south: a lumberjack cuts down a Redwood tree, two miners pan for gold, and a farmer harvests oranges from his orange grove. A cowboy gallops in on a white horse from the east, while a large ship sails in majestically from the west.

Geyser University Professor at Harvard University. Together with Bengt R. Holmström, he received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2016. Biography Oliver Hart was born in Britain to Philip D'Arcy Hart, a medical researcher, and Ruth Meyer, a gynecologist. Both his parents were Jewish; his father was a member of the Montagu family; Oliver's great-grandfather was Samuel Montagu, 1st Baron Swaythling. Hart earned his B.A. in mathematics at King's College, Cambridge, in 1969 (where his contemporaries included the former Bank of England Governor Mervyn King), his M.A. in economics at the University of Warwick in 1972, and his Ph.D. in economics at Princeton University in 1974. He completed his doctoral dissertation, titled \\"Essays in the economics of uncertainty\\", under the supervision of Michael Rothschild. He was a Lecturer in Economics at University of Essex, a fellow at Churchill College, Cambridge, and then a professor at the London School of Economics. In 1984, he returned to the U.S., where he taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and, since 1993, at Harvard University. He became the first Andrew E. Furer Professor of Economics in 1997 and was chairman of the Harvard economics department from 2000 to 2003. He is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, of the Econometric Society, of the American Finance Association, a corresponding fellow of the British Academy, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He has been president of the American Law and Economics Association and vice president of the American Economic Association, and has several honorary degrees. In 2016, Hart won the Nobel Prize in Economics with Bengt Holmström for their work on contract theory, including his work on how ownership should be allocated and when contracting is beneficial over ownership. Academics Hart is an expert on contract theory, theory of the firm, corporate finance, and law and economics. His research centers on the roles that ownership structure and contractual arrangements play in the governance and boundaries of corporations. He has used his theoretical work on firms in two legal cases as a government expert (Black and Decker v. U.S.A. and WFC Holdings Corp. (Wells Fargo) v. U.S.A.) where companies claimed tax related benefits as a result from selling some of their business. The government used Hart's research to claim that because the companies retained control of the sold assets, they could not lay claim to the tax benefits. Personal life Hart is an American citizen. He is married to Rita B. Goldberg, a Harvard literature professor and author of the second-generation Holocaust memoir Motherland: Growing Up With the Holocaust. They have two sons and two grandsons. =Books= * Firms, Contracts, and Financial Structure (Oxford University Press, 1995). =Selected articles= *\\"On the Optimality of Equilibrium when the Market Structure is Incomplete\\", Journal of Economic Theory, December 1975, 418–443 * \\"Takeover Bids, the Free-rider problem, and the Theory of the Corporation\\" (with Sanford J.

The term \\"Việt\\" is cognate with the Chinese word \\"Yue\\", a name applied in ancient times to various non-Chinese groups who lived in what is now southern China and northern Vietnam ; so it means \\"Great Buddhist Viet\\". History =Background= The Ngô dynasty ended with a period of civil strife known as the Anarchy of the 12 Warlords. =Đinh Tiên Hoàng= Đinh Bộ Lĩnh's father was Đinh Công Trứ, a general under the reigns of Ngô Quyền (939–944) and Ngô Xương Văn (950–954). Đinh Công Trứ died while Bộ Lĩnh was still very young. His mother then took him back to her village to live with her family. There Đinh Bộ Lĩnh attended the village school and in his free time rode atop water buffaloes and played games with other children. When he reached adulthood he joined Trần Minh Công (Trần Lãm), one of the Twelve Warlords (Thập Nhị Sứ Quân), who made him a general due to his skills and talents.Hữu Ngọc Wandering through Vietnamese culture 2004– Page 393 \\"Nguyễn Bặc... and statesman who helped Đinh Bộ Lĩnh put an end to the period of anarchy of the Twelve Warlords before the Đinh Dynasty.\\" One by one, Đinh Bộ Lĩnh (924–979) defeated or subdued the other 11 lords. His multitude victories over other lords earned him the title Vạn Thắng Vương, which means \\"King of Ten Thousand Victories.\\" After unifying the country in 968 and bringing peace back to the land, he proclaimed himself Đinh Tiên Hoàng Đế. He renamed the country \\"Đại Cồ Việt.\\" Worried that his country was still weak (where outside influences could be easily made), he sought to strengthen the government by appointing military men to important positions. Among his top generals were Nguyễn Bạc, his oldest son Đinh Liễn, Lê Hoàn, etc. The latter became a major figure for the Đinh Dynasty succession and the rise of the Anterior Lê Dynasty. The end of Đinh Tien Hoàng's reign was marked by the following successive events. *He removed his oldest son Đinh Liễn from the throne as he had decided to have his second son, Đinh Hang Lăng, succeed him. His infant son, Đinh Tuệ, would be next in line. *One night in 980, as Đinh Tiên Hoàng and his son Đinh Liễn were having a party, a mandarin official sneaked into the palace and killed both father and son. Thus fate decreed that the infant son Đinh Tuệ would inherit the kingdom. =Đinh Phế Đế (980)= When Đinh Tuệ became emperor, because of his age, his mother the Dowager Empress Dương Vân Nga assumed the role of regent. =Lê Hoàn's accession to the throne= Appalled by this new threat, the Dowager Empress Dương Vân Nga threw her support to Lê Hoàn who was now commander-in-chief of the army. To confront the Song army who had already arrived at the border, the Empress Dowager agreed to recognize Lê Hoàn and let him step up to the throne as a new king. With the crowning of Lê Hoàn, the Anterior Lê Dynasty was founded. As Lê Hoàn was being crowned Emperor, the Song army approached the boundary of the two countries. Foreign relations From 970 to 975, Đinh Bộ Lĩnh established the status of Đại Việt as a protectorate and tributary state of the Song dynasty to gain Chinese recognition of the independence of Đại Việt. The tributary relationship would last until the French protectorate was established in 1883.

The incidents involved coal miners and union organizers on one side, and coal firms and law enforcement officials on the other. The question at hand: the rights of Harlan County coal miners to organize their workplaces and better their wages and working conditions. It was a nearly decade-long conflict, lasting from 1931 to 1939. Before its conclusion, an indeterminate number of miners, deputies, and bosses would be killed, state and federal troops would occupy the county more than half a dozen times, two acclaimed folk singers would emerge, union membership would oscillate wildly, and workers in the nation's most anti-labor coal county would ultimately be represented by a union. History In the throes of the Great Depression, Harlan County coal owners and operators, in an effort to expand national dependency on their fuel, chose to sell below cost. On February 16, 1931, in order to prevent operating at a loss, the Harlan County Coal Operators' Association cut miners' wages by 10%. Reacting to the unrest created within Harlan's already-impoverished labor force, the United Mine Workers of America (UMW) attempted to organize the county's miners. Employees who were known by their bosses to be union members were initially fired and evicted from their company-owned homes. However, before long, most of the remaining workforce had gone on strike out of sympathy.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p.32 Only three of Harlan's incorporated towns were not owned by mines, and hungry and evicted workers and their families sought refuge in them, primarily in the town of Evarts. They found sympathy there with spurned politicians and business owners who wished to see the company stores vanish. At the peak of the first strike, 5,800 miners were idle and only 900 working.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p. 46 Those who worked were protected by private mine guards with full county deputy privileges, who were legally able to exercise their powers with impunity outside the walls of their employers.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener pp.39,40 They operated under sheriff J.H. Blair, a man who made his allegiance to the business owners clear: \\"I did all in my power to aid the operators ... there was no compromise when labor troubles swept the county and the 'Reds' came to Harlan County.\\"Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p.39 The citizens of Harlan, for their part, lost any illusions they may have held about impartiality in law enforcement. Songwriter Florence Reece reported: > Sheriff J.H. Blair and his men came to our house in search of Sam – that's > my husband – he was one of the union leaders. I was home alone with our > seven children. They ransacked the whole house and then kept watch outside, > waiting to shoot Sam down when he came back. But he didn't come home that > night. Afterward I tore a sheet from a calendar on the wall and wrote the > words to 'Which Side Are You On?' to an old Baptist hymn, 'Lay the Lily > Low'.

If you wasn't a gun > thug, you was a union man. You had to be.http://www.laborheritage.org/?p=249 Strikers exchanged gunshots with private guards and local law enforcement, and strikebreakers were set upon and beaten. The most violent unprovoked attack by mine workers occurred on May 5, 1931, and became known as the Battle of Evarts. The miners lay in ambush for cars carrying company men, and shot at them. Three company men and one striker were killed in the exchange of gunfire. In response to the violence, the Kentucky National Guard was called in. The strikers expected protection, but upon replacing deputized mine guards, the National Guard broke the picket lines instead.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener pp. 42-45 On May 24 a union rally was tear-gassed, and Sheriff Blair rescinded county members' right to assemble. By June 17, the last mine had returned to work. No concessions were given by the mine operators, and UMW membership plummeted.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p.47 In the wake of the UMW failure, the openly Communist National Miners' Union (NMU) made a brief play for Harlan County. Though most workers felt disillusioned with organized labor structure, the NMU's radical ideology gained some traction: ten local lodges sprang up before the Harlan County NMU was officially chartered. The smaller but more passionate NMU made greater relief efforts than the UMW had, opening several soup kitchens throughout the county.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p. 56-88 Ultimately, their attempts at strikes, while weak in surrounding counties, were utter failures in Harlan, where only a fraction of the workforce walked out in 1931 and 1932. Ultimately, a combination of events broke the NMU's foothold: local labor organizers, many of them clergy, learned of the Communist leadership's animosity toward religion and denounced the organization, Young Communist League organizer Harry Simms was killed in Harlan, and the American Red Cross and local charities, who had been unwilling to take sides in a labor dispute, began giving aid to blacklisted miners who were unemployable as the NMU's financial troubles necessitated the closing of its soup kitchens.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W. Hevener p.79 Under the auspices of the National Industrial Recovery Act, which promoted the right to organize one's workplace and outlawed discrimination and firing based on union membership, approximately half of Harlan's coal mines, those in the Harlan County Coal Operators' Association, were run as open shops from October 27, 1933 – March 31, 1935. An open shop allows union membership but does not mandate it. However, wages at these mines came into step with the rest of the nation. Despite headway by the unions, the battle for Harlan County between labor and capital continued in earnest. Sheriff Blair was voted out of office in 1933 and died in 1934, replaced by T. R. Middleton, a candidate who ran on a pro-union platform The Kentucky National Guard was once again called in on December 8, 1934, requested by UMW organizers who had been threatened by bosses and deputies. The troops promptly escorted the union men to the county line. As national political support for the NIRA dwindled, capital gained the upper hand, and when the United States Supreme Court struck down the legislation's pro-union National Recovery Administration portion, shops with union presence in Harlan dwindled from eighteen to one.Which Side Are You On? The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39 by John W. Hevener P. 81-123 Where the NIRA had been toothless in Harlan, the Wagner Act of 1935 proved itself a far greater thorn in the side of Harlan County's mine operators. It outlawed yellow-dog contracts, company unions, blacklists, and discrimination on basis of union activity, all tactics employed by coal companies.Which Side Are You On? The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39 by John W. Hevener p. 128 While coal interests across the nation fell into step with the new legislation in 1935, Harlan was as resistant to federal meddling as it had ever been. On July 7, a group of deputies, enraged at a public celebration of the Wagner act, dispersed the crowd by beating several miners.Which Side Are You On? The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39 by John W. Hevener Pp. 130-131 1935 proved to be a turbulent year, even for Harlan; troops were deployed to maintain order in the county three times. On September 29, troops were dispatched on behalf of the miners for the first time in the Harlan County War, the governor referring to the beatings and harassment at the hands of the mine guards as \\"the worst reign of terror in the history of the county.\\" He protected the miners despite the fact that a bomb had killed Harlan County Attorney Elmon Middleton several weeks prior. Impact Author and activist Theodore Dreiser conducted an investigation under the auspices of the National Committee for the Defense of Political Prisoners (NCDPP) of the American Communist Party. With contributions by John dos Passos, Samuel Ornitz, and others, Dreiser produced a report called Harlan Miners Speak: Report on Terrorism in the Kentucky Coal Fields. The Dreiser Committee also discovered the labor folk singer Aunt Molly Jackson and her younger half-brother Jim Garland, putting them on a tour of 38 states to raise funds for the strikers.Which Side Are You On?: The Harlan County Coal Miners, 1931–39, by John W.

They published four CDs from 1997 to 2005, in which all the poems and songs of The Lord of the Rings are set to music. The project was approved by both the Tolkien family and HarperCollins Publishers. Queen Margrethe II of Denmark gave permission to use her illustrations in the CD layout. Permanent members are Caspar Reiff and Peter Hall (composition, singing and guitar), Signe Asmussen (singing), Øyvind Ougaard (accordion), Katja Nielsen (double-bass), and Morten Ryelund Sørensen (conductor and violin). The Ensemble has toured Europe in 2007, combining their own works with soundtrack pieces from Howard Shore's soundtrack to the film trilogy as well as live narration by Christopher Lee. History Composer Caspar Reiff founded the Tolkien Ensemble in Copenhagen in autumn 1995. At that time, Reiff (1971) was studying guitar at the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen. He formed an ensemble consisting of fellow students from the Academy and his former guitar teacher, composer and multi- musician Peter Hall (1946), LLCM (TD) London College of Music. The goal set by the two composers, Caspar Reiff and Peter Hall, was to create the world's first complete musical interpretation of the poems from J.R.R. Tolkien's masterpiece 'the Lord of the Rings', And the ensemble, which was to form the base of this vision, was named 'The Tolkien Ensemble' - an ensemble entirely devoted to the works of Tolkien. The Tolkien Ensemble's first concert took place at Gjorslev Castle on 21 January 1996 and was followed by a number of successful concerts in Denmark. Towards the end of 1996 Reiff and Peter Hall were granted permission by the Tolkien Estate to record the first 12 songs from 'Lord of the Rings'. The two composers chose the young Danish conductor Morten Ryelund as producer and this was to have a major influence on the interpretation of the music and the project as a whole. Ryelund later became a full member of the Tolkien Ensemble and the ensemble was granted permission by HM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark to use her illustrations on the CD cover. These unique illustrations, created when she was Crown Princess of Denmark, were to become a recurrent feature on all the ensemble's later CD's. The first album, An Evening in Rivendell, was released in autumn 1997 and was given outstanding reviews by the press. A number of concerts followed. Notably, in a 1998 concert in Oxford, the audience included members of the Tolkien family, to the ensemble's delight. An Evening in Rivendell was followed by the 2000 release A Night in Rivendell. The album contained more sombre songs from the Lord of The Rings; the ensemble worked with, among others, the singers Povl Dissing, who sang the part of Gollum, Kurt Ravn (Legolas) and Ulrik Cold (Gandalf). In the summer of 2000 The Tolkien Ensemble reached 'cult status' among Tolkien enthusiasts the world over, though the ensemble still awaited wider recognition. This came alongside the growing interest for The Lord of the Rings, when director Peter Jackson made a film version of Tolkien's books. At the end of 2001 the interest for Tolkien's works grew significantly throughout the world and fate willed that the Tolkien Ensemble was invited to take part in the Danish premiere of the first film in the Trilogy: The Fellowship of the Ring. Among the celebrities representing the film in Copenhagen was the legendary actor Christopher Lee, who played Saruman in the film. The Tolkien Ensemble contacted him and he agreed to take part in the ensemble's third Album At Dawn in Rivendell, partly as narrator, partly as singer of Treebeard's songs. The cooperation with Lee combined with the growing interest for the work of Tolkien, resulted in a huge success for the ensemble's Third album. The album was released in 22 countries throughout the world, played on the radio in a great number of countries, and was given excellent reviews. The International Herald Tribune called the ensemble's music: 'Total Lord of the Rings magic!' At Dawn in Rivendell subsequently achieved great sales worldwide.Review of At Dawn In Rivendell from Scifi DimensionsReview of At Dawn In Rivendell from TheOneRing.net The cooperation with Christopher Lee developed to include concerts. In the autumn of 2002 Christopher Lee took part in a release concert at Tivoli Concert Hall. Then followed a major tour of, among other countries, England and Sweden, culminating in the summer of 2003 when the ensemble gave a concert in Danmark for an audience including HM Queen Margrethe II of Denmark and HRH Prince Henrik. Since then the Tolkien Ensemble has continued to give concerts. In 2004 the two composers, Reiff and Hall, together with Christopher Lee, took part in a major sell-out concert in Concertgebouw, Amsterdam, and in 2005 The Tolkien Ensemble played at two major Lord of the Rings concerts at Ledreborg Castle, Denmark where more than 22,000 people attended the concerts. Among the performers was the ensemble's new member, Nick Keir of the Scottish folk-trio The McCalmans. These concerts, performed together with the Danish National Chamber Orchestra and the Danish National Chamber Choir and a number of soloists, also marked the release of the fourth and last album of the series, Leaving Rivendell. Besides Lee, Nick Keir, the Danish National Chamber Orchestra/DR and the Danish National Chamber Choir/DR performed with The Tolkien Ensemble on Leaving Rivendell. The release of the four-CD-box marks the end of more than ten years' work and, with the participation of more than 150 professional musicians, The Tolkien Ensemble finally reached their goal: the release of their Complete Songs & Poems from The Lord of the Rings.A selection of independent international reviews is given at The four-CD-box is dedicated to the memory of J.R.R. Tolkien, to The Tolkien Society in Oxford and to the millions of people for whom The Lord of the Rings has a special place in their hearts. Reception The Tolkien scholar David Bratman calls the ensemble \\"elves\\", unlike groups like Broceliande and the Hobbitons who he says are \\"hobbits in ethos\\". He calls their music \\"some of the most atmospheric Tolkien settings on disc\\". He mentions Christopher Lee's recitation of some of Tolkien's poems, where \\"[he] impersonates Treebeard half rhythmically talking and half singing, à la Rex Harrison as Professor Higgins.\\" Bratman describes the ensemble's approach as an \\"effective combination\\" of folk and classical, and the ensemble itself as consisting of conservatory students and folk musicians. In his view there is an \\"ethereal air of wistfulness\\" throughout the Tolkien Ensemble's music, which contributes powerfully to their Elvish songs; he at once adds that their hobbit songs work out well too, with a light guitar setting and simple sturdy tune that handles Tom Bombadil's songs effectively. He especially admires the third album's last track, \\"Sam's invocation of Elven Hymn to Elbereth Gilthoniel\\" by Peter Hall, where \\"Frodo's walking song meets an Elvish hymn to Elbereth\\". The Green Man Review writes that the Tolkien Ensemble \\"has made excellent use\\" of the songs in The Road Goes Ever On.

The Residenz is the largest city palace in Germany and is today open to visitors for its architecture, room decorations, and displays from the former royal collections. Plan of the Residenz The complex of buildings contains ten courtyards and displays 130 rooms. The three main parts are the Königsbau (near the Max-Joseph-Platz), the Alte Residenz (Old Residenz; towards the Residenzstraße) and the Festsaalbau (towards the Hofgarten). A wing of the Festsaalbau contains the Cuvilliés Theatre since the reconstruction of the Residenz after World War II. It also houses the Herkulessaal (Hercules Hall), the primary concert venue for the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra. The Byzantine Court Church of All Saints (Allerheiligen- Hofkirche) at the east side is facing the Marstall, the building for the former Court Riding School and the royal stables. Munich Residenz looking southwest  History and architecture  Munich Residenz in the 18th century The first buildings at this site were erected in the year 1385 and were financed by the township of Munich as a sanction for a failed uprising against Stephen III (1375–1413) and his younger brothers. The Silver Tower (Silberturm), as the strongest bastion, was significantly situated next to the inner walls protecting the castle against the city. This sturdy new castle (Neuveste – new fortress), surrounded by wide moats and located at the very north eastern corner of the new double ring of town walls, replaced the difficult to defend Alter Hof (the Old Court) located in the middle of the town as residence of the Wittelsbach rulers. For the Dukes of the often divided country had felt the need to keep some distance from the frequently rebellious city dwellers at the one hand and for some defence against their warlike relatives at the other. As a result, they sought to build themselves a shelter impregnable and easy to leave (directly towards the glacis, without having to enter city lanes) at the same time. Around 1470, under Albert IV (1465–1508), the fortress walls and the gate in the north were built, followed by the construction of two turrets. The gothic foundation walls and the basement vaults of the old castle including the round pillars of the so-called ballroom cellar (Ballsaalkeller) are today the oldest surviving parts of the palace. The Residenz's development over the centuries didn't only take place out of its main centre, the Neuveste, but in addition grew out of several single parts and extensions, the first of which used to be the Antiquarium. Finally, after more than four centuries of development, the giant palace had practically replaced a whole former city quarter with barracks, a monastery, houses and gardens. It assembles the styles of the late Renaissance, as well as of Baroque, Rococo and Neo-Classicism. =The Alte Residenz= 17th-century west wing With the order of William IV (1508–1550) to expand the Neuveste with the so-called Rundstubenbau and to set up the first Court Garden, began the history of the Munich Residenz as a representative palace. To the history cycle of this garden pavilion belonged once also the Battle of Issus of Albrecht Altdorfer. Lion in front of the Alte Residenz Under Albert V (1550–1579) Wilhelm Egkl built next to a banqueting hall of the Neuveste (St. George Hall) an art chamber in the building of the former ducal stables, many collections in Munich originate from there. Since there was not enough space for the extensive collection of sculptures, the building for the Antiquarium was created 1568–1571. It had to be built outside the castle, as there was no place in the Neuveste. William V (1579–1597) ordered the construction of the Witwenstock (Widow Wing) for the dowager Duchess Anna and in 1581–1586 the four wings of the Grottenhof. Friedrich Sustris was the architect. Around 1590 the construction of the Black Hall was begun to the southeast on the Antiquarium. Under direction of Sustris the Erbprinzentrakt (Prince Wing), north of the Witwenstock was added. Brunnenhof (Fountain Courtyard), one of the ten courtyards Maximilian I (1597–1651) commissioned what is now called the Maximilian Residenz (Maximilianische Residenz ), the west wing of the palace. Until the 19th century, it was the only publicly visible facade and it still is preserved. The portals are guarded by two lions and a statue of the Virgin Mary as patroness of Bavaria in a wall niche between the portals on the west side of the residence complex. Maximilian had rebuilt and connected the existing buildings. In addition, Maximilian I had from 1612 large parts of the south and west wings of the Neuveste with the Silver Tower demolished. Between 1611 and 1619, the wing at the large Emperor's Courtyard (Kaiserhof) was created to the north of the complex. It documents the high political claims of Maximilian. Its large dimensions satisfied Maximilian's successors up to 18th century, who contented themselves with interior upgrading and smaller extensions such as the wing for the Grüne Galerie (1730) and the Residenz Theatre (1751). =Courtyards= Ten courtyards can be found inside the large complex: The Grotto Courtyard (Grottenhof) with the Perseus Fountain was built between 1581–1586 under William V (1579–1597) by Friedrich Sustris as the leading architect, and takes its name from the grotto on the western façade of the Antiquarium. The octagonal Brunnenhof (Fountain Courtyard) served as a place for tournaments before the large Wittelsbach Fountain was erected in the middle of the courtyard in 1610. The buildings around the Kaiserhof (Emperor's Courtyard) with the Residenz Tower as clock tower, were erected from 1612 to 1618, in the reign of Maximilian I. Both courtyards are decorated with optical illusions on the facade, the same as the facade of the Alte Residenz. The Königsbauhof (King's Building Courtyard) replaced a garden. At its eastern side the rococo facade of the Grüne Galerie (Green Gallery) is situated, designed by François Cuvilliés the Elder in of 1731–33. Other courtyards are the Kapellenhof (Chapel Courtyard), the large Apothekenhof (Apothecary Courtyard) behind the Festsaalbau, the Puderhöfchen (Small Powder Courtyard), the Küchenhof (Kitchen Courtyard), the Kabinettsgarten (Cabinet Garden), and then finally the Zierhöfchen (Decorative Courtyard or Comité Courtyard). =The Königsbau= Munich Residenz, Königsbau (2014) Today's building is from the time of King Ludwig I of Bavaria (1825–1848), who instructed his architect Leo von Klenze to extend the palace. Between 1825 and 1835 the King's building (Königsbau) was constructed to the south in the style of the Florentine Palazzo Pitti. The building is 30 meters high. In the Königsbau are numerous suites of rooms, including the State Apartment of Ludwig I on the first floor and the Nibelungen Halls on the ground floor. Today also the Treasury are situated in the ground floor of the Königsbau. The royal living rooms are still preserved, they served primarily for the representation and could be visited by appointment already at that time. The actual private apartments of the royal couple on the back of Königsbau have not survived due to its destruction in World War II. On the second floor were the so-called Festgemächer, which were intended for minor court festivities. The spatial sequence was divided into lounge, reception salon, dance hall, flowers hall and private rooms for the king. These rooms are still preserved but in a highly simplified form and are now home to the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts. From 2016 to 2018 the Yellow Staircase of Klenze will be restored. Once it was the main entrance to the royal apartments in the Königsbau. The Maximilian- Joseph Denkmal (King Maximilian-Joseph Memorial) at Max-Joseph-Platz (Maximilian-Joseph Square) stands in front of the Königsbau. It was created as a memorial for King Maximilian Joseph (1799–1825) by Christian Daniel Rauch and carried out by Johann Baptist Stiglmaier. It was only unveiled in 1835 as the king had rejected being depicted seated. =The Festsaalbau= Festsaalbau of the Residenz The neo-classical 250 metre long Banqueting Hall Wing (Festsaalbau) in the north section of the Residenz was added between 1832 and 1842 by Klenze under instructions from King Ludwig I. Here were located the Large Throne Room and the royal reception halls. One of the primary concert venues for the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra is the Herkulessaal (Hercules Hall), which has replaced the destroyed Large Throne Room. The Festsaalbau today houses also the Bavarian Academy of Sciences and Humanities and the Cuvilliés Theatre (Old Residenz Theatre). The Winter Garden was commissioned by King Ludwig II of Bavaria (1864–1886) around 1870. After the king’s death, the Winter Garden on the roof of the Festsaalbau of the Residenz Palace was dismantled in 1897. The reason for this was due to water leaking from the ornamental lake through the ceiling of the rooms below. Photographs and sketches still record this incredible creation which included a grotto, a Moorish kiosk, an Indian royal tent, an artificially illuminated rainbow and intermittent moonlight.Calore, 1998, pp. 164–165. =The Old Residenz Theatre= The Cuvilliés Theatre (Old Residenz Theatre) The building of the Residenz Theatre, next to the church, was constructed already under Elector Maximilian III (1745–1777) from 1751. Before World War II, it housed the Old Residenz Theatre. The decoration of the old theatre, carefully dismantled and removed, was moved into the south-eastern wing of the Festsaalbau next to the Allerheiligen-Hofkirche after the war. Here it was reopened as Cuvilliés Theatre. In 2008, the courtyard before the theatre was also redesigned and covered with a new glass roof. It was then named Comité Courtyard after the Comité Cuvilliés, an initiative that made the renovation of the theatre possible by collecting donations. = The Allerheiligen-Hofkirche = Allerheiligen-Hofkirche next to the Residenz Theatre The Allerheiligen- Hofkirche (Court Church of All Saints) on the eastern side of the Residenz was commissioned in 1825 by King Ludwig I. It was inspired by the Cappella Palatina, the richly decorated Byzantine royal chapel in Palermo. As bombs destroyed all but the outer walls in 1944, its rich interior ornament was almost completely lost. The church is now used for concerts and events. =The Marstall= Facing the church, the Marstall, the building for the former Court Riding School (Hofreitschule) was erected under King Maximilian Joseph by Klenze between 1817 and 1822. The construction of the monumental portal arch, surmounted by busts of Castor and Pollux, is considered one of the most mature early works of Klenze. The extensive buildings for the royal stables do not longer exist. From 1923 the Marstall housed the Marstallmuseum which was in 1941 moved into Nymphenburg Palace. Today the building serves as scenery house, workshop building and study stage of the Residenz Theatre. =Opening to public and World War II damage= Königsbau facade Prince Regent Luitpold (1886–1912) ordered the rebuilding of the Stone Rooms for his purposes as he did not want to live in the apartments of the King. During his time, the new Treasury, designed by Julius Hofmann, was created. Today it forms the entrance to the counter area. King Ludwig III (1912–1918) occupied the palace for only a short period before the revolution of 1918. He first moved like his father, into the Stone Rooms at the Kaiserhof tract, and later into the Königsbau. Now technical upgrades such as central heating and electric lighting were made, which had the Prince Regent still rejected. In addition, the Nibelungen Halls were used by Queen Maria Theresa, to create with other women, items for Bavarian soldiers during World War I. As early as the reign of King Ludwig I, interested citizens could by appointment (when the royal couple were not living in the Residenz) visit the Königsbau. Under Prince Regent Luitpold, it was possible to visit all the unused parts of the palace and the Old Treasury. In 1897 the first guide book for the Residenz in Munich was published. After the revolution of 1918, the Residenz became a public museum. The palace was severely damaged by bombing during World War II. Most of its rooms were reconstructed by the 1980s. Some of the buildings, however, were rebuilt in a simplified manner. Examples of this are the facade of the Alte Residenz on Residenzstrasse or the Arcades in front of the former throne hall on the first floor of the Festsaalbau. A substantial loss was caused by the destruction of the neo-classical rooms and halls in the Festssalbau (including the Grand Throne Hall, now the Hercules Concert Hall, and the Grand Stairway), of the rich décor of the Papal Rooms including the ceiling of the Golden Hall and of the apartment of King Ludwig II (1864–1886). The frescoes of the Court Church of All Saints were also completely destroyed. Inside the palace =Residenz Museum= The Renaissance Antiquarium of the Residenz The Hall of Antiquities (Antiquarium), built between 1568 and 1571 for the antique collection of Duke Albert V (1550–1579) by Wilhelm Egkl and Jacobo Strada, is the largest Renaissance hall north of the Alps. It was remodelled into a banqueting hall by Friedrich Sustris in 1586-1600. The Antiquarium housed the Ducal Library until 1581. The low hall was then covered with a barrel vault that had 17 window lunettes. The hall was adorned with paintings by Peter Candid, Antonio Ponzano, and Hans Thonauer the Elder, though some were initially designed by Sustris himself. The Court Chapel (Hofkapelle), the Emperor's Staircase (Kaisertreppe) and Imperial Hall (Kaisersaal), the Stone Rooms (Steinzimmer; 1612–1617; general design by Hans Krumpper) and the Trier Rooms (Trierzimmer); ceiling frescoes by Peter Candid) built for Elector Maximilian I are typical examples from the early 17th century. The Baroque Ancestral Gallery The Baroque era is represented by the Papal Rooms (Päpstlichen Zimmer), erected under his son Elector Ferdinand Maria (1651–1679). Pope Pius VI lived here during his visit in Munich in 1782. As a result, the rooms were named after him. The extensions of Elector Maximilian II Emanuel (1679–1726), especially the Alexander room and Summer room are representative living rooms. They were altered not long after his death. The remains were destroyed during the residence fire of 1729. The Ancestral Gallery (Ahnengallerie; 1726–1731) along with the Porcelain Cabinet (both constructed by Joseph Effner) and the Ornate Rooms (Reichen Zimmer) designed by François de Cuvilliés for Charles Albert (1726–1745) are magnificent examples of the court Rococo style. The rich decoration was executed by Johann Baptist Zimmermann, Joachim Dietrich and Wenzeslaus Miroffsky. The two-storey exterior façade of the Green Gallery (Grüne Gallerie) with its seven arched windows facing the courtyard of the Königsbau is a masterpiece of Cuvilliés. The Green Gallery, named after the wall covering made of green silk damask, was not only a ballroom, but also a gallery for paintings and mirrors. The magnificent Bedchamber (Paradeschlafzimmer) served as the place for the electoral dressing procedure. Thus all the structures erected by the court architects Joseph Effner and François de Cuvilliés served only the glorification of the House of Wittelsbach and the attainment of the imperial crown, which ultimately succeeded in 1742. In January 1745, Charles Albert died as Emperor Charles VII in the Residenz, which was thus also for a short time the imperial palace of the Holy Roman Empire. In the times of Elector Maximilian III (1745–1777) the rococo Apartments of the Prince Elector (Kurfürstenzimmer) were constructed between 1746 and 1763. Cuvilliés and Johann Baptist Gunetzrhainer were responsible for the work. The Neoclassical Small Throne Room of the Kings of Bavaria The Neo-classical epoch is represented by the Charlotte Rooms (Charlottenzimmer), the Royal Apartments and the Halls of the Battles (Schlachtensäle) in the Königsbau. The wall and ceiling paintings are by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld in the Nibelungensäle (Nibelungen Halls; 1827–1834). They are the first monumental representations of the Nibelungenlied Nibelungen Saga of Songs. The actual private chambers of the royal couple at the back of the Königsbau no longer survive as they were destroyed in World War II. Leo von Klenze was not only responsible for the architecture, but also designed the floors, the wall paintings and all the furniture. In the Festsaalbau were spacious halls that contained the Grand Throne Room in the centre, the Imperial halls, the ballroom and the Battle Hall in the north-eastern pavilion. These facilities were intended only for state occasions and were only accessible by a grand staircase which no longer exists. Here the most important royal ceremonies were held, surrounded by twelve colossal statues sculpted by Ferdinand von Miller, representing the main Bavarian rulers. In addition to the rich accumulation of furniture, paintings and sculptures, today the museum contains bronze work, clocks, tapestries, porcelain and several special collections such as masterpieces of bronze art, European miniatures and liturgical vestments. The Wittelsbach dynasty porcelain collection includes items from their own Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory as well as from such famous porcelain producers such as Sèvres in France and Royal Porcelain from Berlin. The Wittelsbach East Asian collection includes over 500 pieces of porcelain and some paintings. In the Royal Silver Chambers, valuable pieces are housed. The collection of relics of the Munich Residenz come from the era of the Counter-Reformation. In the Festsaalbau bronze sculptures from the late 16th and early 17th centuries are presented, one of the richest collections of European bronze art from the Mannerism and early Baroque eras. =The Treasury= Renaissance Saint George's statue Founded by Duke Albert V the Treasury houses the jewels of the Wittelsbach dynasty. This magnificent display in the Schatzkammer (Treasury) is contained in ten halls in the eastern wing of the Königsbau. The collection is one of the most important in the world and spans 1000 years from the early Middle Ages to Neo-classicism. Royal insignia, crowns, swords, goblets, goldsmith works, rock crystal, ivory work, icons and numerous other treasures like precious tableware and toiletries are magnificently presented. Royal regalia of Bavaria (1807) inside the treasury) Among the exhibits are Emperor Charles the Bald's prayer-book from around 860, the altar-ciborium of Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia from around 890, the crown of the Empress Cunigunde, reliquary of the True Cross which belonged to the Emperor Henry II, a cross which belonged to Queen Gisela, all from around 1000, the Reliquary Crown of Henry II from around 1270, an English Queen's crown from around 1370 (the oldest surviving crown of England that came to the palatinate line of the house of Wittelsbach as the dowry of Blanche of England, the daughter of King Henry IV of England), the famous Statuette of St George (Munich, ca. 1599), the insignia and orders of the Bavarian monarchs, including crowns and insignia of the Emperor Charles VII (1742), the Crown of Bavaria (1807), ceremonial swords and ruby jewellery which belonged to Queen Therese. A precious set of matching dishes served the French Empress Marie Louise during her journeys. Non-European art and craftwork, including Chinese porcelain, ivories from Ceylon and captured Turkish daggers are also on display. =The coin collection= The Residenz houses the Bavarian state coin collection, the . It was found by Duke Albert V. By the accession of Elector Palatine Charles Theodore (1777–1799), the Palatine and the Electoral Bavarian collection were combined. During the Napoleonic era many monastic coin collections came into the care of the Bavarian state. Crown Prince Ludwig, later King Ludwig I, had much enthusiasm for Ancient Greek coins and spent a lot of time examining the collection. In the first three decades of the 20th Century, the collection was extended to house the Renaissance coins, medals and insignia. In 1963, the current exhibition rooms were opened in the Munich Residenz. With more than 300,000 coins, medals and banknotes from the ancient world to the present time, it is one of the world's leading collections.  Hofgarten  Hofgarten temple and fountain The Hofgarten (Court Garden) is located at the northern side of the Residenz opposite to the Festsaalbau. It was laid out under King Maximilian I. In the middle of the park in French style is a circular temple built in 1615, crowned by a statue of Bavaria created in 1594 by Hubert Gerhard. The western Hofgarten arcades with the gate (Hofgartentor) were executed by Klenze. The northern wing includes the former electoral gallery building which was built by court architect Karl Albert von Lespilliez in 1780/81, today home of a theatre museum (Deutsches Theatermueum). The remnants of some renaissance arcades in the north east of the park were integrated into the Bavarian State Chancellery in 1992. The people of Munich love to denounce it as the 'Straussoleum', named after a former state Premier who commissioned it, or even the Munich White House, in reference to the long and hard fights that prevented the state government from erecting three giant wings instead of one. These wings it was claimed would have destroyed the overall impression of the court gardens. Its middle section with the a reconstructed dome are the only surviving sections of the former Bavarian Army Museum, constructed between 1900 and 1905 and almost completely destroyed during the bombing raids of World War II. The museum is now located in the Neues Schloss (New Palace) in Ingolstadt, around 80 kilometres north of Munich.  Tourism  The Munich Residence and its museums have receive more than 300,000 visitors per year, similar to the Nymphenburg Palace and ahead of Schleissheim Palace, but clearly behind the castles of King Ludwig II, especially Neuschwanstein.

Scirea is also one of only nine players in the history of the European football that won all three major UEFA football competitions, a feat he managed while playing with Juventus, the Italian club with which he spent the majority of his career, aside from two seasons with Atalanta. At international level, he played for the Italian national team for more than a decade, during which he was an undisputed member of Italy's defensive line-up, keeping Franco Baresi out of the national team for four years, until he retired in 1986. Scirea became a World Champion with the 1982 FIFA World Cup winning team, which defeated Brazil 3–2 in a decisive second round match and Germany 3–1 in the final; he also represented Italy in two more World Cups, finishing in fourth- place in 1978, and UEFA Euro 1980, where Italy once again managed a fourth- place finish. Club career Scirea in training with Atalanta, early 1970s Scirea was born at Cernusco sul Naviglio, in the province of Milan, but was of Sicilian origin. Scirea made his Serie A debut for Atalanta against Cagliari on 24 September 1972. He remained with Atalanta for two seasons, before transferring to Juventus, with whom he would stay until the end of his playing career. In all he made 397 appearances in Serie A, scoring 24 goals. Scirea saw great success with Juventus, playing alongside Antonio Cabrini, and the hard-hitting Claudio Gentile, as well as goalkeeper Dino Zoff. He managed the impressive feat of winning every UEFA Club and domestic competition during his time at the club (7 Serie A titles, 2 Italian Cups, 1 UEFA Cup, 1 Cup Winners' Cup, 1 European Cup, 1 UEFA Super Cup, and 1 Intercontinental Cup). He retired from club football at the end of the 1987–88 season. He took up the role of scout at Juventus, later working as a coach. International career Scirea (standing, third from left) with Italian national team in the victorious 1982 World Cup Scirea debuted with the Italian national team on 30 December 1975, against Greece. He immediately became an irreplaceable pillar of the team managed by Enzo Bearzot, and played in three World Cups, and one European Championship on home soil in 1980, where Italy finished in fourth place after reaching the semi-final, and Scirea was named part of the team of the tournament. Scirea, alongside clubmates Antonio Cabrini and Claudio Gentile, centre backs Giuseppe Bergomi and Franco Baresi and goalkeeper Dino Zoff, formed the defensive backbone of perhaps the strongest Italian side of the post-war period as the Azzurri dominated international and club football during the late 1970s to early 1980s. Scirea impressed in the 1978 World Cup where Italy finished in fourth place. At the 1982 World Cup, after a quiet start in the first round group stage, Italy beat Argentina and then Brazil in the second round, later overcoming Poland 2–0 in the semi-final. A 3–1 victory over West Germany in the final earned Scirea a lasting place in World Cup history. By 1986 World Cup, however, the team was in transition, and went out to France in the second round. This was to be Scirea's last match for Italy, having won 78 caps and scored 2 goals. Style of play Scirea (right) and teammate Oscar Damiani in training for Juventus in the 1974–75 preseason Scirea was a modern and highly talented defender, gifted with excellent technical skills and tactical ability, who was known for his pace, elegance on the ball, and innate capacity to read the game. In contrast to the ruthless tactics often employed by other defenders, including his paired partner, Claudio Gentile, Scirea was renowned for his class, fair play and sportsmanship. Scirea never earned a red card in his career. He was also known for his leadership, serving as captain of both Juventus and the Italian national side. A former midfielder, he played the sweeper, or libero, role for most of his career, and contributed to the development of the position, due to his vision, composure on the ball and passing ability. Thus, in addition to aiding his team defensively, Scirea would detach himself from the defensive line and contribute to the attacking potential of his team, frequently being involved in the build-up of goals, and sometimes even scoring himself. In the latter part of his career, as he lost his pace, Scirea played a more defensive role as a centre-back. Personal life Scirea was married to Mariella Cavanna; together they had a son, Riccardo. Mariella has become a politician after her husband's death. Death In summer 1989 Scirea visited Poland as an observer to watch Górnik Zabrze, against which Juventus was to play in the UEFA Cup. On 3 September 1989 a car carrying him collided head-on with a truck near Babsk. The car carried four canisters of gasoline in the trunk (a common practice in Poland at that time due to frequent gas shortages), which exploded upon impact, killing Scirea along with two fellow passengers. Legacy Due to his own defensive skill and sportsmanship, Scirea's name has become attached to various youth tournaments and fair-play awards as a role model for sportsmanship and sporting excellence, including the Premio Nazionale Carriera Esemplare \\"Gaetano Scirea\\", which is awarded to a legendary Serie A footballer for their career achievements, talent, and personality. In 2005, former Italian national team coach Enzo Bearzot proposed the retirement of the jersey number six of that national team and Juventus in recognition of Scirea's career.

In the general melee that followed, a number of UDF and NAP workers were killed by the authorities in their attempt at ending the rally.  Exile  Since Ajmal Khattak was a prominent figure in the National Awami Party, he was wanted by the Federal Security Force as part of the general crackdown on NAP. To avoid arrest and possible torture, he fled into self-imposed exile to Afghanistan and stayed there for 16 long years. During this time he was closely associated with the Pakhtunistan movement. During his years in Kabul, Ajmal Khattak was a close confidant of Badshah Khan, and also enjoyed excellent relations with leaders of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, including President Nur Muhammad Taraki, Babrak Karmal and Dr.Mohammad Najibullah.

Ajmal Khattak was elected as the President of the ANP when Khan Wali Khan stepped down from the post.  President of ANP  In the 1993 general elections, Ajmal Khattak lost his re-election bid in Nowshera to the PPP candidate Major General Naseerullah Babar. As a leading critic of the PPP, it was important for the ANP – IJI alliance to have Ajmal Khattak in parliament, and he was therefore nominated to the Senate of Pakistan in March 1994. His two terms as President of the Awami National Party were noted primarily for the close alliance with former opponents, the Muslim League, after the alliance collapsed in January 1998 over the renaming of the province of NWFP to Pakthunkhwa and Khattak role in leading the Awami National party briefly into joining an alliance known as the Pakistan Oppressed Nations Movement (PONM). The decision to join PONM was made despite strong pressure from party critics who preferred the ANP to ally themselves with a Federal party like the Peoples Party.

A member of the Democratic Party associated with Virginia's Byrd Organization, he was the 59th Governor of Virginia in 1962–66, and the first governor of Virginia to have been born in the 20th century. Early life and education Harrison was born in Alberta, Virginia, the son of Albertis Sydney Harrison and Lizzie, (née Goodrich). According to his national obituaries, he was related to Benjamin Harrison V who signed the Declaration of Independence and two United States presidents, William Henry Harrison and Benjamin Harrison, the 9th and 23rd Presidents. However, this has been proven false. He researched and found this statement false himself. He was born in Alberta, Va, in Brunswick County. His home sat on a tract deeded to his ancestor, Henry Harrison, by King George II in 1732. He received an LL.B degree from the University of Virginia Law School in 1928. Harrison married Lacey Virginia Barkley c.1940. They had two children, Antoinette H Jamison and Albertis S. Harrison III and 6 grandchildren, Albertis Sydney Harrison IV, Joseph D. Goodrich Harrison, Monica Harrison Kopf, Virginia Lacey Jamison Walter, and James Carper Jamison II. Legal and political career Harrison went into legal practice in Lawrenceville, Virginia, where he became town attorney, before being elected commonwealth's attorney of Brunswick County. He was elected to the Senate of Virginia in 1947. He served there for ten years, before being elected Attorney General of Virginia in 1957. Harrison resigned as Attorney General in April 1961 to run for Governor, winning election that November with 63.84% of the vote, defeating Republican H. Clyde Pearson. His administration increased educational financing for new schools and laboratories and raised teachers' pay. He promoted the development of state-supported colleges and technical schools as well as improved vocational training. He helped to modernize state banking laws to attract investment and accelerated highway construction. He sat on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, later renamed the Supreme Court of Virginia, from 1968 to 1981. In 1968 he chaired the Commission on Constitutional Revision that drafted the 1971 Constitution of Virginia. =Massive Resistance= Harrison in 1962 As Attorney General, Harrison was responsible for defending the state's resistance to school integration, as part of the Massive Resistance strategy endorsed and led by the state's political leader, United States Senator Harry F. Byrd. Part of Massive Resistance involved the closing of public schools in various Virginia cities and counties to prevent racially integrated classrooms. Davis v. County School Board of Prince Edward County (1952) was one of the companion cases to Brown v. Board of Education (1954), but the Supreme Court had left enforcement to the local federal district judge. Moreover, the Gray Commission of Byrd loyalists had recommended passage of various laws to avoid or delay integration. After opinions by the Virginia Supreme Court on January 19, 1959 (the birthday of Robert E. Lee) as well as a three-judge federal panel overturned much of the new Virginia legislation, Governor James Lindsay Almond Jr. (previously attorney general) and Harrison decided not to defy those courts and allowed schools in Arlington and Norfolk to reopen. However the schools in Prince Edward County closed in 1958 and did not reopen until 1963, as white students used tuition grants to attend a private segregation academy at state expense, while black students were left to volunteer efforts. Other problematic school closures, ultimately opened pursuant to federal court orders included those in Albemarle, Warren County and later New Kent County (the subject of the 1968 Supreme Court decision in Green v. County School Board of New Kent County (1968). Harrison told the board to comply unless they were willing to risk prosecution. By this time, he, like a number of other Byrd Democrats, had concluded that obstinate resistance to integration could not continue. Another aspect of Massive Resistance involved new laws regulating attorney ethics, designed to attack practices of the NAACP, which was pursuing the desegregation actions. Initially, the U.S. Supreme Court deferred to an upcoming decision of the Virginia Supreme Court about those new ethics rules in Harrison v. NAACP (1959), but the case came before it twice more in NAACP v. Button (1963) (which was reargued after Harrison resigned as Attorney General to run for Governor, and which Virginia lost under attorney general Robert Young Button. Death Harrison died of a heart attack at his home in Lawrenceville on January 23, 1995. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Lawrenceville, Virginia. The courthouse in Lawrenceville is named in his honor.

He was the Colony Commissioner of the Boy Scout Association, Hong Kong Branch from 1934 to 1950. Biography Victor Halward was educated at The King's School, Canterbury. In 1916 he went straight from school into the army, at first in the Royal Artillery, then in 1917 he was commissioned as second lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment. In 1919 he was awarded the Military Cross: :For gallantry and devotion to duty during an attack on [an] enemy position S.W. of Fleurbaix, on 30 September 1918. His platoon was selected to secure and hold an enemy position on a flank, and he pushed them forward and occupied an advanced position, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. In face of heavy machine-gun fire and snipers he held on to his position, and it was mainly owing to his coolness and initiative that the remainder of the attacking troops gained their objectives. In June 1919 Halward was promoted to lieutenant. He then left the army and went up to Jesus College, Cambridge. After graduating he studied theology at Westcott House, Cambridge, and was ordained in the Church of England. He was curate at St Saviour's Church, Croydon, 1922–25, then in 1926 he moved to Hong Kong as Diocesan Chaplain to the Anglican Church there (Chung Hua Sheng Kung Hui).

During his commissionership, the Scout Movement rooted among the Chinese population in Hong Kong. Halward appointed Chinese district commissioners and they significantly helped to develop Scouting in Hong Kong. Through his connections in Canton he established cooperation with the Scouts of China.

The company had a presence in over 27 countries including associates and joint ventures and in 2013/14, reported revenue in excess of £23.4 billion. It had two core business activities – pharmacy-led health and beauty retailing, and pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution – and also increasingly developed and internationalised its product brands. The company was formed in 2006 by the merger of the British high street pharmacist Boots Group and the pan-European wholesale and retail pharmacy group Alliance UniChem and was listed on the London Stock Exchange as Alliance Boots plc. In 2007 it was bought out in a private equity transaction by AB Acquisitions Limited, led by Stefano Pessina and Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). Alliance Boots GmbH was established in Switzerland during 2008 and is a direct subsidiary of AB Acquisitions Holdings Limited, which held all shares in the company. In August 2012, the US company Walgreens purchased 45% of shares as part of a plan to merge the two businesses, with an option to acquire the remaining shares within three years. It exercised that option in August 2014, and following shareholder and regulatory approvals, the two businesses merged on 31 December 2014 to form Walgreens Boots Alliance. The group's operations were mainly carried out under the Boots and Alliance Healthcare brands. Boots UK is the UK's leading pharmacy-led health and beauty retailer. Alliance Boots is also the largest pharmaceutical wholesaler in the UK through its Alliance Healthcare (Distribution) Ltd business. The company employs over 120,000 staff and operates more than 4,600 retail stores, of which just over 4,450 have pharmacies. Alliance Boots pharmaceutical wholesale division serves over 180,000 pharmacies, doctors, hospitals and health centres from over 370 distribution centres in 20 countries. Both companies became subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance on completion of the merger. History =Establishment= Following a short period of speculation amongst financial analysts, it was announced in October 2005 that Boots Group would merge with Alliance UniChem in a deal valuing both companies equally and said to be worth around £7 billion. Rival firm Celesio, owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain, challenged the deal, although were rejected by the Competition Appeal Tribunal. The merger received final approval from the Office of Fair Trading in February 2006 and completed on 1 August 2006, although 96 shops were sold to comply with a condition laid down by the OFT. Former Boots Group shareholders held 50.2% of the new company, with former Alliance UniChem shareholders owning 49.8%.Alliance Boots IR =Acquisition by Stefano Pessina and KKR= On 25 April 2007, Alliance Boots was approached with a buy-out offer by New York City-based Private Equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in conjunction with Alliance Boots' then Executive Deputy Chairman, Stefano Pessina, for an estimated . Alliance Boots was the first company on the FTSE 100 share index to be bought-out by a private equity firm. Almost was advanced by investment banks, including Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan, UniCredit, Barclays, Merrill Lynch, the Bank of America and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Simultaneously the banks, as so-called \\"equity underwriters“, together invested around in the buyout company. The reverse takeover and subsequent privatisation was dubbed as \\"the best deal ever struck\\" by a managing partner at a private equity firm in June 2008. Alliance Boots GmbH was established in Switzerland during 2008 and is a direct subsidiary of AB Acquisitions Holdings Limited, a company which owns 55% of Alliance Boots GmbH’s shares. =Walgreens merger= It was announced on 19 June 2012 that Walgreens would purchase a 45% stake in Alliance Boots, as the first step in a three-year merger plan. Walgreens paid $6.7 billion for this share, and subsequently on 6 August 2014 Walgreens exercised its option to complete the second step of its strategic transaction with Alliance Boots to create the first global pharmacy-led health and beauty retailer, with over 12,000 stores worldwide. The two companies had established Walgreens Boots Alliance Development Company in late 2012 to further their integration. The first publicly visible sign of the merger came in November 2012 when Boots skincare brand No7 debuted in a Walgreens store in Los Angeles, with a view to further rolling out the Boots brand across the US. Walgreens' shareholders approved the purchase on 29 December 2014, and it was completed on 31 December. Under the terms of the merger, the two companies became subsidiaries of a new holding company, Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. which remains headquartered in Deerfield, Illinois. The new company is organised into four divisions, of which Walgreens and Boots each became one. The two remaining divisions are Pharmaceutical Wholesale and International Retail, which includes Alliance Healthcare, and Global Brands. Operations Alliance Boots operations are split into two areas, pharmacy-led health and beauty retailing and pharmaceutical wholesaling and distribution. The Group also has a stand-alone contract manufacturing business called BCM and increasingly develops and internationalises its product brands. =Health and Beauty Retail= Boots UK Interior of a Boots store Boots UK formed the main retail business of Alliance Boots in the United Kingdom, and all former Alliance Pharmacy branches were rebranded as Boots. The Boots brand has a history stretching back over 160 years and is a familiar sight on Britain's high streets. Boots stores are located in prominent high street and city centre locations as well as in local communities. Most branches include a pharmacy, and focus on healthcare, personal care and cosmetic products, with most stores selling over the counter medicines. Larger stores typically offer a variety of healthcare services in addition to dispensing prescriptions, such as flu vaccination, cholesterol screening, weight loss advice, hair retention treatment, smoking cessation advice and products, and chlamydia testing & treatment (private service). Optician services are also offered in many larger stores, with Boots Opticians providing eye tests along with the sale of spectacles and contact lenses. Many stores also feature traditional photo processing and/or a Kodak picture kiosk where users of digital cameras and camera phones can create prints. Larger stores usually offer a range of electrical equipment such as hairdryers, curlers and foot massagers, whilst selected stores offer a range of sandwiches, baguettes, wraps, salads and beverages. Boots operates a loyalty card programme branded as the Boots Advantage Card, and claims to have 17.8 million regular users. Internationally Since 1936, there have been Boots stores outside the UK. Stores in countries as widely spread as New Zealand, Canada (see Pharma Plus) and France were all closed in the 1980s. Today, there are Boots branded stores in several countries including the UK, Norway, Ireland, The Netherlands, Thailand, as well as the Middle East. Much of the Irish chain was acquired by purchasing Hayes Conyngham Robinson in 1998,Pharmacists join the ranks of millionaires although Boots had been present in Ireland prior to this. In 2013/2014, there were 76 stores in the Republic. In July 2011, an investigation by Ireland's National Consumer Agency found Boots to be the most expensive pharmacy for prescription drugs. In other countries (including Kuwait, Hong Kong, and the USA), Boots products are sold from instore 'implants' in department stores and other pharmacies. =Wholesale= Alliance Healthcare Alliance Healthcare formed the backbone of Alliance Boots wholesale and distribution service, with twice daily deliveries to more than 16,000 delivery points in the UK alone.

It retained Boots' existing Nottingham head office as its UK operational headquarters. The company was accused of making the move for tax purposes, as Switzerland had more favourable tax regime than the United Kingdom, and in January 2011, protests were held by the UK Uncut group at a number of Boots stores, including its flagship London store, which was closed down by protestors.Tax exemption protest at Boots - London The group's headquarters, listed as being on Baarerstrasse in Zug, were revealed to be a post office box within the town's post office. Alliance Boots itself stated that its Swiss headquarters reflected the international nature of its wider group and that it had an administrative office in Zurich. The Guardian reported in 2016 the findings of Richard Brooks, a former tax inspector, who it said found that the “headquarters” in Zug was “one of around 50 unrelated companies dealt with by a local business service company, the proprietors of which were none too pleased with the visit” and that no Boots employees were present. Boots' former head of corporate finance, John Ralfe, stated that he believed \\"the UK has lost about £100 million a year in tax\\" due to the move to Switzerland. Boots defended itself by reaffirming that it was a British business registered for VAT. In 2013, campaign group War on Want said on its website \\"New research shows that Alliance Boots, the high street chemist and pharmaceutical giant, has avoided more than £1 billion in tax since it went private six years ago through taking on excessive debts, profit shifting and corporate restructuring.\\" While the takeover by Walgreens was being finalized, there was growing political pressure against the company moving its headquarters from Chicago to Switzerland as part of a tax inversion to reduce its tax bill. In August 2014, Walgreens confirmed it would retain its Chicago headquarters for the newly formed group.

History Robert W. Steele Elementary School in Denver, 1918 In 1859, Owen J. Goldrick established the Union School, Denver's first school, a private school that served thirteen students. Other private schools opened shortly thereafter to accommodate Denver's rapidly growing population during the Pike's Peak Gold Rush. In 1861, the new territorial government established Goldrick as the superintendent in Arapahoe County (which then encompassed Denver). Soon after the first two public school districts in Denver were formed: District One on the east side of the city and District Two on the west side. District Two opened the first public school in Denver on December 1, 1862 in a rented log cabin and District One followed suit soon after. On April 2, 1873 the first purpose built school building, the \\"Arapahoe School\\", opened. In 1902, the 20th Amendment to the Constitution of the State of Colorado, known as the Rush Amendment, created the City and County of Denver, separating it from Arapahoe County. In 1903, Denver Public Schools was established. All school districts in Denver County were consolidated into Denver Public Schools, and Aaron Gove became the first-ever DPS Superintendent. Margaret Tupper True was president of the Denver School Board from 1906 to 1908, one of the first women to serve in such a role in a major city. In 2015, the Brookings Institution ranked Denver Public Schools first in school choice among large school districts in the United States. In 2018, Denver Public Schools joined other regional districts in banning its students from attending school-sanctioned trips to the Rocky Flats National Wildlife Refuge citing the history of the area's plutonium contamination and previous designation as a Superfund site. In February 2019, teachers in the Denver Public Schools went on strike for three days as part of the larger wave of teachers' strikes across the United States that began in 2018. The teachers union, Denver Classroom Teachers Association (DCTA), demanded higher pay and school funding as well as a change to the teachers' compensation structure, which they said was overly reliant on bonuses instead of salary increases. It was the first strike in the district in 25 years. The deal that the union ultimately reached with the district kept some bonuses in place but also increased base salaries by 7 to 11 percent and created a new pay scale that puts more emphasis on teacher training and experience. In 2020, all members of the board voted to remove police officers from schools in the wake of the killing of George Floyd. Organization DPS operates 207 schools, including traditional, magnet, charter and pathways schools, with a current total enrollment of about 92,331 students. Of those, 56% of the school districts enrollment is Hispanic, 23% is Caucasian, 13% is African American, 3% is Asian, 4% is more other, and 1% is American Indian. 140 languages are spoken, and 37% are English language learners. 11% of students have special needs. The poverty rate is 70%. Under the leadership of Superintendent Tom Boasberg and guided by the tenets of the Denver Plan, DPS had the second-highest academic growth in the nation. The total of DPS graduates has grown from 2,655 in 2006 to 3,608 in 2014. Drop-out rates have dropped from 11.1% in 2006 to 4.5% in 2014. =School Board= The Denver Board of Education is the policymaking body for DPS. The school board is made up of one representative from five districts and two at-large representatives, for a total of seven members. Dr. Carrie Olson was elected the school board president in 2019. Student demographics In the 2016-2017 school year, 92,331 students were enrolled in 207 Denver Public Schools consisting of 8 Early Childhood Education or K-12 schools, 92 elementary, 18 ECE-8 or K-8, 34 middle, 12 schools with grades 6-12, and 44 traditional high schools. 71.7 percent (62,977) of public school students qualified for free or reduced price lunch in the 2013-2014 school year.Denver Children's Affairs, facts sheet There are 11,932 employees of DPS; 4,329 of them are teachers. = Race = Although Denver is more than 52 percent non-Hispanic white, minority groups represent double the regular Denver population. The reason for this has been white flight over the past few decades and extremely strong Hispanic school-age growth due to relatively high birth rates. The predominant heritage in the Denver Public School system is Mexican American. Denver has a high Hispanic percentage of roughly 32%, and they are a majority in the public school system.

Cox held the gun to one student when the teacher doubted Cox would cause harm and stated that he would prove it to her. At that time three students escaped out a rear door and were fired upon. Cox was later tackled and disarmed by another student. A friend of Cox's told the press that Cox had been inspired by the Kuwait Airways Flight 422 hijacking and by the novel Rage, which Cox had read over and over again and with which he strongly identified. He pleaded no contest to charges of kidnapping and assault with a deadly weapon after the jury deadlocked. He was sentenced to five years in prison.

Most generally, it is the ability of moving water (flowing or waves) to dislodge and transport rock particles. Within this rubric are a number of specific erosional processes, including abrasion, at facilitated erosion, such as static erosion where water leaches salts and floats off organic material from unconsolidated sediments, and from chemical erosion more often called chemical weathering. It is a mechanical process, in which the moving water current flows against the banks and bed of a river, thereby removing rock particles. A primary example of hydraulic action is a wave striking a cliff face which compresses the air in cracks of the rocks. This exerts pressure on the surrounding rock which can progressively crack, break, splinter and detach rock particles. This is followed by the decompression of the air as the wave retreats which can occur suddenly with explosive force which additionally weakens the rock. Cracks are gradually widened so each wave compresses more air, increasing the explosive force of its release. Thus, the effect intensifies in a 'positive feedback' system. Over time, as the cracks may grow they sometimes form a sea cave. The broken pieces that fall off produce two additional types of erosion, abrasion (sandpapering) and attrition. In corrasion, the newly formed chunks are thrown against the rock face. Attrition is a similar effect caused by eroded particles after they fall to the sea bed where they are subjected to further wave action. In coastal areas wave hydraulic action is often the most important form of erosion. Tools to stem the erosion of rivers in the 18th century Similarly, where hydraulic action is strong enough to loosen sediment along a stream bed and its banks; this will take rocks and particles from the banks and bed of the stream and add this to the stream's load. This process is the result of friction between the moving water and the static stream bed and banks. This friction increases with the speed of the water and the roughness of the bed. Once loosened the smaller particles are actually held in suspension by the force of the flowing water, these suspended particles can scour the sides and bottom of the stream. The scouring action produces distinctive markings on streams beds such as ripple marks, fluting, and crescent marks.Coja Isabelle and Renard, Maurice (2002) Sedimentology (translation of Sédimentologie from French) Lisse, Exton, Pennsylvania, pages 143–144, The larger particles and even large rocks are scooted (dragged) along the bottom in a process known as traction which causes attrition, and are often \\"bounced\\" along in a process known as saltation where the force of the water temporarily lifts the rock particle which then crashes back into the bed dislodging other particles.Ritter, Michael E. (2006) \\"Geologic Work of Streams\\" The Physical Environment: an Introduction to Physical Geography Hydraulic action also occurs as a stream tumbles over a waterfall to crash onto the rocks below. It usually leads to the formation of a plunge pool below the waterfall due in part to corrosion from the stream's load, but more to a scouring action as vortices form in the water as it escapes downstream. Hydraulic action can also cause the breakdown of river banks since there are water bubbles which enter the banks and collapse them when they expand.

The song was changed for the first time keeping the show's theme signature and featured a sort of jazz tone. Each cast member, in descending age of their characters, dances alongside Cosby as his/her name is shown in the credits. Bill Cosby is seen at the end of the credits \\"dancing\\" to the music as the production credits appear and at the end, he quickly turns his head and looks into the camera before the sequence fades to black. Two versions of this theme were also used. Much like the season one theme, both versions of season two's theme song were completely different in sound than the other. The long version featured more of a synth beat than the short. Midway through the season, following her marriage to NBC sportscaster Ahmad Rashād, Phylicia Ayers- Allen's name in the opening credits is changed to \\"Phylicia Rashād\\". (The diacritic was dropped in season five and subsequent seasons, when she was credited as \\"Phylicia Rashad\\".)

Unlike the first three seasons, the opening credits featured the cast wearing some formal 1930s-style clothing with Cosby wearing a top hat and tails, Tempestt Bledsoe wearing a United States Navy uniform similar to what performers would wear when performing to the troops in the United Service Organizations. Malcolm-Jamal Warner wore a business suit and is seen looking at his watch then starts tapping his feet, etc. Geoffrey Owens (Elvin Tibideaux) is introduced to the regular cast by Cosby leading him into Sabrina LeBeauf's credit scene, symbolizing Heathcliff Huxtable \\"giving away\\" his daughter Sondra to her new husband.

The producers wound up discarding the idea when their lawyers said that in order to use the mural, they would have to get permission from all 63 young artists first. Instead, the show developed its own mural which combined some of the elements and used many of the colors of the actual one. The owners of the mural threatened to sue and denounced the show for ripping off the children. Carsey- Werner tried to negotiate a settlement with Creative Arts Workshop, but Bill Cosby decided to replace the theme with season six's opening credits. Only four episodes featured the original opening credits.CHRONICLE – BILL COSBY has stopped using a mural designed for the opening credits of The Cosby Show. By Susan Heller Anderson Published: October 18, 1990, The New York Times In all other episodes in first-run, and in all repeats as well as in syndication, only the replaced sequence was used. Lisa Bonet and Joseph C. Phillips were in the credits still but they only appeared in less than a handful of episodes during the season. New cast member Erika Alexander was featured in the original season seven sequence, but only her name and role are both listed in the replacement sequence. The spoken phrase \\"This is the best elevator music I've ever heard!\\" was removed as well in the intro, except for one episode in 1991. *Throughout this season, Cosby was often seen wearing a small black button with the letters \\"SD Jr.\\" – as a tribute to Sammy Davis Jr., who died in May 1990. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" No. in series ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" Original air date ! style=\\"background:#FF5F5F; color:white;\\" Production code } =Season 8 (1991–92)= *The mural inspired by \\"Street of Dreams\\", originally painted by inner-city youth from the Creative Arts Workshop in Harlem, was finally used full-time in season eight. The cast now danced in the sequence to a hip-hop blend that featured Lester Bowie on trumpet. The scenes of Bonet and Phillips in the original opening sequence were removed. After the controversy from the previous season, the producers gave recognition to the painters of the original mural in the closing credits. Malcolm-Jamal Warner wore glasses in this set of opening credits, but not in any episodes. At the end of the sequence, like he did in other seasons, Cosby turns his head and looks into the camera. A few episodes from season seven used this opening, albeit with Lisa Bonet and Joseph C. Philips in the opening credits, and at the end of the sequence, Bill Cosby would walk off and say, \\"Yo, chill out! Don't put your face in the mud, Pally!\\". *The final episode \\"And So We Commence\\" features an extended sequence, with clips of each cast member dancing from the opening credits of every season (except season 1, which did not have dancing in the opening credits). *A running gag throughout this season involves the house's front doorbell, which malfunctions in a variety of bizarre ways despite Cliff's attempts to fix it. *The finale was taped on Friday, March 6, 1992, under production codes 0823 and 0824. { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:100%;\\" ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" No. in series ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" No. in season ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" Original air date ! style=\\"background:#7A26C8; color:white;\\" Production code } References External links * The official guide to all episodes – Carsey-Werner Television Episodes Lists of American sitcom episodes it:I Robinson#Episodi ","title":"List of The Cosby Show episodes"},{"id":"2818166","title":"Mexican Federal Highway 8"},{"id":"2818171","text":"The Laboratory for Foundations of Computer Science (LFCS) is a research institute within the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh, in Scotland.

Though what remains is eroded and only a poorly preserved ditch and bank are still visible.Unlocking Buckinghamshire's past , Accessed 13 December 2012 =Medieval= The area today called Buckland Common had in Edward the Confessor's time been the southern and upland part of the manor of Buckland which was under the control of the see of Dorchester. Following the Norman Invasion, Buckland had become incorporated into the estates owned by the Church of Lincoln. This upland area would have originally comprised impenetrable scrub woodland but gradual clearance created pasture land which provided advantageous grazing for cattle and sheep. Perhaps this location was chosen on account of it being more sheltered lying as it does in a slight depression in comparison to the surrounding land. It is believed the first permanent settlement began in the 16th century, around the time when Henry VIII seized the lands from the Earl of Warwick in 1522.British History online, Accessed 13 December 2012 =Post medieval period= Around 1540, Queen Mary I granted a tenancy to Sir Anthony Browne, whose daughter Elizabeth married Baron Richard Dormer a wealthy landowner from Wing. Richard's descendant the First Earl of Carnarvon was killed during the English Civil War at the first Battle of Newbury. The Parliamentarians sequestrated the lands around 1653 although they were subsequently restored to the Carnarvon estate in the 1700s. By marriage it passed to the Chesterfield family and was held by Philip Stanhope, 5th Earl of Chesterfield in 1813. After his death it passed into private hands and was owned by the Lord of the Manor, Peter Parrot. Industry and economy Evidence from pottery shards and a number of kilns have been found dating industrial activity to before 1700. These made use of local clay deposits from clay pits, of which a number of which have been identified, to make pottery with a distinctive manganese-brown. This activity contributed to the development of the settlement during the first part of the 18th century. Fine examples of this pottery are to be found in the nearby Chequers Museum. Though this pottery production then ceased clay continued to be dug to support a thriving brick making industry which survived into the 20th century. Agriculture provided the main employment during the 19th and first half of the 20th centuries, though a cider factory which opened in the 1900s was for a time also an important part of the local economy. This increasing industry also supported at least three beer houses. The oldest of these and first licensed in 1698 was The Boot, which in 1864 was renamed The Boot and Slipper and remained in business until 1976. The Britannia Pub's early history is unknown but was the first to close in 1939. The Rose and Crown, licensed in 1863, changed its name in 1967 to The Horse and Hounds before ceasing to trade in 1984. All three are now private properties. Development of the settlement The Green at Buckland CommonEstablishment of the village of Buckland Common happened much later than other similar daughter settlements in this part of the Chilterns. The schism was eventually hastened by the action of the Commissioners for Enclosure in 1842 who oversaw the dividing up of the of common land between villagers, enabling the creation of a largely autonomous community. All that remained of the once extensive common was a small rectangular allotment of land. The plot was heavily depreciated through clay and gravel extraction during the 18th and 19th centuries and it was used as a rubbish tip up until the 1950s. During the 1960s restoration work was undertaken to enable it to be used for recreation purposes and was given protection through its registration as common land. Known today as The Green it is owned and maintained by the Parish Council \\"for the enjoyment of local people\\". The Rothschild family were prominent farmers and landowners. Around 1920 they were responsible for improving the tied cottages of their farm workers by building, in typical Rothschild style, two new terraces of cottages along Little Twye Road and replacing dilapidated tenements in Parrotts Lane. Prior to 1860, Buckland Common did not have its own church, being technically part of Buckland Parish. From this time it had a Strict Baptist Chapel, followed by a rapidly built wooden Anglican chapel of ease commissioned specifically to counter the impact of the non-conformist mission. The church was unable to sustain a congregation, was decommissioned and eventually was pulled down in about 1939. The Baptist Chapel continued but was converted to a private dwelling in the 1980s. The graveyard of the Baptist church remains open and is owned by the Grace Baptist Association. Before 1973 primary school age children from the village attended St Leonards National School in the nearby village of that name, which was founded in 1860. Since the closure of the school children attend Hawridge and Cholesbury Church of England School in Hawridge. Governance Buckland Common Allotments Until 1934 Buckland Common remained a remote part of Buckland Parish known as 'Upper Buckland'. Together with Cholesbury, Hawridge and St Leonards, which are locally known as hilltop villages it now forms part of Cholesbury-cum-St Leonards civil parish. The parish council purchased land in 1974 which it divided into allotments for parishioners. Adjacent to this a small development of public housing was built at the same time.

The county board is also responsible for the Leitrim county teams. Considered \\"Connacht's traditional minnows\\" and \\"one of the GAA's Cinderella counties\\", Leitrim are never considered seriously as likely to win a major title. The county football team play in the Connacht Senior Football Championship and compete in Division 3 of the National Football League. They have won the Connacht Senior Football Championship on two occasions, the first in 1927 and their second in 1994b. Leitrim were a force in the 1920s, winning an impressive haul of one Connacht and zero All-Ireland titles. Football Leitrim's football history has brought sparse reward. They first competed in the All-Ireland in the 1907 championship. They were beaten by Roscommon on a score of 0-03 to 0-01 in the Connacht semi-final in their first ever match. The county won its first ever match in the 1910 championship, beating Sligo in the Connacht quarter-final by 0-03 to 0-00. They were then beaten by Galway in the semi-final. Leitrim did not record another win until the 1914 championship. They beat Sligo by 5-07 0-02 to qualify for their first ever Connacht final but were beaten by Roscommon in the decider. In the semi-final of the 1924 Connacht Championship, Leitrim forced Mayo to a draw, then refused to play extra-time. Galway went on to be beaten in the final by Mayo following a replay. In 1927, with training from Sean O'Hehir, father of the veteran radio commentator Micheál and with the help of good fortune when Connacht semi-finalists Roscommon had to line out without five players whose car had broken down, Leitrim won their first ever Connacht title. Leitrim won the Connacht title and held Kerry to two points in the semi-final of the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship. John O'Mahony was appointed Leitrim manager to build on the success of the Under-21 team that won the 1991 Connacht Championship. He took Leitrim to the final of the 1994 Connacht Championship. Leitrim did not have an easy route to the final, beating Roscommon by a point and only overcoming Galway by a point in a replay. They took on Mayo in the final, overcoming O'Mahony's native county by two points in Hyde Park. O'Mahony's feat in leading the team that is traditionally the weakest in the province to that title is still heralded nationally to this day. Leitrim were ultimately beaten in the All-Ireland semi-final by Dublin at Croke Park. The first county to benefit under the parentage rule was also the first to lose their big catch, with the loss of Declan Darcy to Dublin depleting the panel in 1998, bringing Leitrim's most successful era to an end. Leitrim won the FBD Insurance League in 2013, defeating their southern neighbours Sligo in the final. This was the county's fourth ever trophy and their first since 1994. They retained the title in 2014, defeating Roscommon in the final.

The land around Codnor came under the jurisdiction of William Peverel after the Norman conquest.Codnor – the Domesday Book Online accessed 6 January 2008 Although registered as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade II Listed Building the site is officially, as at 2016, a Building at Risk. History =William Peverel= The castle is a stone keep and bailey fortress and was established by William Peverel. The present fragmentary remains represent a three-storey keep and a strong curtain wall and ditch, flanked by round towers. The outer bailey is on a lower level and was constructed at a later period. The castle overlooks the Erewash valley and the counties of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire. It originally had a deep moat and on its eastern side there was once a considerable abundance of trees, which have now been cut down. On the west side there was a courtyard that was strongly fortified by huge round towers, which had battlements. In other parts of the ruins there is evidence that the outer walls had arrow-loops included to allow bowmen to use them if necessary. =Henry de Grey= By 1211 it was owned by Henry de Grey, a descendant of the Norman knight Anchetil de Greye. Henry's descendants include the long line of Lords Grey of Codnor, the Lords Grey of Ruthyn, Wilton and Rotherfield, Lady Jane Grey and the Earls of Stamford, and the extinct families of the Dukes of Suffolk and Kent. His son Richard settled in Codnor and was a loyal Baron to Henry III. Along with his brother John they served the King in the Holy Land. John Grey distinguished himself in the Scottish wars and found himself in great favour with Edward III. Together with William D'Eincourt,William D'Eincourt was the son of Walter D'Eincourt, who held \\"sixty-seven lordships\\", of which Blankney was his \\"principal seat.\\" – sourced from this book extract the Lord Grey commanded all the knights of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire in case of an invasion. Henry, the last of the family, died during the reign of Henry VII without a legitimate heir. He left part of his lands to his illegitimate sons, Henry and Richard, and part to his widow, Katherine Stourton. =Zouche family= The remainder went to his aunt Elizabeth Grey, who in 1429 married Sir John Zouche, the youngest son of the fourth Baron Zouche of Harringworth. Sir John Zouche of Codnor was three times High Sheriff of Derbyshire. The castle remained in the hands of the Zouche family for two hundred years until they sold up and emigrated to Virginia in 1634. =Streynsham Master= Sir Streynsham Master, High Sheriff of Derbyshire, who bought the Codnor Castle estate in 1692, is reported as the last resident of the castle. He lived there until his death in 1724. Preservation View from NE Today the remnants of Codnor Castle are a fragile ruin; its few remaining high walls are well visited. The site is now privately owned. Public access is managed by The Codnor Castle Heritage Trust; access can be arranged by contacting the Trust. There are public footpaths to the Castle from Codnor Market Place, where there is an information board in partnership with Derbyshire County Council, as well as public footpaths from the east in the Erewash valley. In June 2007, Channel 4's Time Team programme carried out an archaeological dig around the castle. A perfectly preserved gold noble of Henry V was found in the moat and is now displayed at Derby Museum and Art Gallery.Time Team at Channel Four: Codnor Castle, first broadcast 6 January 2008, accessed 4 July 2008 Most Haunted Live! visited the castle as part of a paranormal investigation 'As Live' special in 2017.

He received Berry into the church, and prepared him for college.The Standard (London) 1 Feb 1899, p. 5 At the age of seventeen he entered Airedale College, Bradford, to train for the Congregational ministry, and in 1875 became pastor of St George's Road Congregational church, Bolton. He became widely known as a man of administrative ability, a vigorous platform speaker and an eloquent preacher. In July 1883 he undertook the pastorate of the church at Queen Street, Wolverhampton, with the supervision of nine dependent churches in the neighbourhood. Here again he exercised a wide influence, due in part to his evangelical conviction, eloquence, broad views and powers of organization, but also to the magnetic force of his personality. In 1887 he went to America in fulfilment of a promise to Henry Ward Beecher of Brooklyn, and received a unanimous invitation to succeed Beecher in what was then the best-known pulpit in the United States. Berry, however, felt that his work lay in England and declined the invitation. In 1892 he took part in a conference at Grindelwald on the question of Christian Reunion, and subsequently, with Hugh Price Hughes and Alexander Mackennal of Bowdon, conducted a campaign throughout England, introducing the ideas and principles of Free Church federation.

He was one of Alexander the Great's generals, and appears to have enjoyed a high place in his confidence even before the death of Philip II, as he was one of those banished by that monarch (together with his brother Erigyius, Ptolemy, Nearchus, and others) for taking part in the intrigues of the young prince. After the death of Philip in 336 BC, Laomedon, in common with the others who had suffered on this occasion, was held by Alexander in the highest honour: he accompanied him to Asia, where, on account of his acquaintance with the Persian language, he was appointed in charge of the captives. Though his name is not afterwards mentioned during the wars of Alexander, the high consideration he enjoyed is sufficiently attested by his obtaining in the division of the provinces, after the king's death in 323 BC, the important government of Syria. This he was still allowed to retain on the second partition at Triparadisus in 321 BC, but it was not long before the provinces of Phoenicia and Coele-Syria attracted the interest of his powerful neighbour Ptolemy. The Egyptian king at first offered Laomedon a large sum of money in exchange for his government. When the latter rejected his overtures, he sent Nicanor with an army to invade Syria. Laomedon was unable to offer any effective resistance. He was made prisoner by Nicanor and sent to Egypt. However, he managed to escape and joined Alcetas in Pisidia. It is probable that Laomedon took part in the subsequent contest involving Alcetas, Attalus, and the other surviving partisans of Perdiccas against Antigonus, and shared in their final overthrow by Antigonus in 320 BC, but his individual fate is not mentioned.

Lucas is a talented basketball player and writer. He is rival to half-brother Nathan Scott, before the two eventually become close friends. While striving for his dreams, he must balance his tumultuous relationships with his father, Dan Scott, and the two women enveloping his love life, Peyton Sawyer and Brooke Davis. The character has been described as popular among teenagers and young adults, not only for his skill at basketball but for his romantic aspirations. Specifically regarding the character's impact on female viewers, Entertainment Weekly stated that his soulful eyes contributed to the show's success. Character development =Casting= Chad Michael Murray was the first person to be cast for One Tree Hill. The producers were originally unsure as to who Murray would play. Series creator Mark Schwahn wanted him to play the character of Nathan Scott since Murray had played a bad guy several times before, and he felt it was only natural to give him this role. Murray, however, wanted to portray Lucas due to a connection he felt with the character. He felt that he could inhabit the character as the two share several similarities. Murray's mother left him when he was young, and Lucas was abandoned by his father. Murray's passion for the role led the producers to cast him as Lucas. Murray had turned down the lead role of Ryan Atwood in The O.C. to accept the role as Lucas Scott. =Personality and wardrobe= Schwahn said that in designing the show, he created Lucas as \\"this underdog kid from the wrong side of the tracks\\" who crosses over to the pretty and popular; he wanted to show what the life of such a person would be like in a basketball atmosphere. For Murray, in addition to their shared abandonment issues, Lucas's love for literature also appealed to him. Murray had become a fan of the genre during high school, and felt it changed his way of seeing things; it made him rethink his own actions. Lucas has been described as \\"caught between being charming and a nerd, a hermit and confident\\". Murray said of the character, \\"He's very introverted.\\" He described Lucas as an observer, someone who likes to watch people and try to figure out who they really are, as opposed to who they think they are, another aspect similar to Murray's own personality. Lucas's T-shirt, shorts and jeans look (left); his sleeker, more form-fitting clothing (right). Murray never played much basketball before the show, and was more into football while in high school. Because of this, a basketball coach was hired for Murray in order to improve his basketball skills. To go along with the character's personality, a \\"sedate\\" wardrobe was designed. Schwahn said of Lucas's wardrobe, \\"...He was a Levi's guy. He was, you know, he wore a lot of, like, plain T-shirts and things because we just wanted him to represent the everyman.\\" Despite having the character start out this way, the series eventually let his wardrobe evolve. Starting from the fourth season on, he was given some \\"wilder stuff\\". Schwahn clarified, \\"You know, he can [now] rock something from Sean John, which normally would have been Nathan's department.\\" He said the style of the characters really does evolve on the show, especially with the four-year timeline jump. One Tree Hill's costume designer, Carol Cutshall, stated, \\"Diesel is so wonderful on [Murray]. Diesel jeans. It's an Italian company. A lot of times, Italian designers cut much more slimly...for a really lean physique.\\" For the adult Lucas, she said that \\"they've had nice long sleeves and nice long shirts and really slim clothing and that looks best on [Murray]. He doesn't need to be swallowed up. He's got his own style as a person. It's not just up to me. I try to bring in what I think is going to fit him best.\\" With the timeline jump, Lucas's main brands became Diesel, Guess menswear, and Juicy Couture. Regarding the character's romantic life, Schwahn designed a love triangle between Lucas and the two girls, Peyton Sawyer and Brooke Davis, which created an intense fan base rivalry. While describing Lucas and Peyton as soulmates and a \\"meant to be\\" pairing, he described Brooke and Lucas as \\"also genuine\\" and as having a great dynamic.From the official TheCWSource YouTube channel. He acknowledged that the fan bases are large and \\"very passionate\\" about their pairings. \\"There is a huge fanbase dedicated to Brooke and Lucas, and sometimes [those people] feel a bit betrayed, just as the fanbase dedicated to Peyton and Lucas felt betrayed [in Season 2, and parts of Season 3],\\" said Schwahn. \\"That tells me that we've done things correctly – that's the strength of a love triangle.\\" Storylines =Overview= Lucas Scott is the son of Dan Scott and Karen Roe, and the nephew of Keith Scott; he has a younger half brother, Nathan Scott, on his father's side and a younger half-sister, Lily Roe Scott, on his mother's side (she is also his cousin through Keith). He was raised by his mother after his father abandoned them to marry Deb Lee, Nathan's mother. His uncle Keith, who always had feelings for Karen, took over the father figure role. Lucas grew up in Tree Hill, a small North Carolina town along with his best friend and later sister-in-law, Haley James Scott. He shares romantic bonds with Peyton Sawyer and Brooke Davis, is interested in basketball and literature, and suffers from the genetic heart disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. =Early seasons= At the beginning of the first season, 16-year-old Lucas Scott is recruited by coach Whitey Durham to play for the Ravens basketball team after most of the players are suspended for drunk-driving. He soon has troubles with his half-brother Nathan, who is also the Ravens captain, because Nathan wants to remain the star of the team and feels threatened by Lucas's arrival.\\"Pilot.\\" One Tree Hill, The WB.

Regarding Murray's portrayal, Paul Cooke of DVDActive.com said, \\"Murray does a fine job as a brooding Lucas.\\" Kelsey Zukowsk of 2snaps.tv said, \\"Chad Michael Murray as Lucas plays one of the deeper roles... [He] does far better as Lucas, the one who seems to be motivated by truth and what is right, than any movie role I have seen him in.\\" Television Without Pity, on the other hand, stated, \\"Chad Michael Murray is almost too pretty, looks good pouting on promo posters and modeling sponsored fashions, and can only muster one and a half emotions convincingly.\\" See also *List of fictional supercouples *Quotes References Further reading External links *One Tree Hill – Cast – The CW One Tree Hill (TV series) characters Fictional writers Fictional basketball players Fictional characters from North Carolina Television characters introduced in 2003 Male characters in television ","title":"Lucas Scott"},{"id":"2818275","text":"View east along WV 87 at WV 2 in eastern Mason County West Virginia Route 87 is an east-west state highway located in western West Virginia.

It is a sequel to Gorky Park and features former militsiya investigator Arkady Renko, taking place during the period of Perestroika.Wroe, Nicholas, The Guardian (March 26, 2005). Crime Pays Background After uncovering corruption in high places (in Gorky Park), Renko is dismissed from his job as a Moscow police investigator and is forced to accept a variety of menial jobs in remote parts of the Soviet Union. Finally, he finds himself gutting fish on a factory ship in the Bering Sea, in part to hide from the KGB, who have tried to kill him. The Soviet factory ship is part of a US- Soviet joint venture, with the US fishing vessels catching the fish and turning the catch over to the Soviets for processing (gutting, cleaning, and freezing). The other crew members have signed up with the prospect of a one- day stop at the American port of Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands, with an extra salary allowance in US dollars to let them purchase Western goods such as VCRs and cassette tapes. Then the body of a murdered female crew member is pulled up in the vessel's nets, and Renko reluctantly agrees to investigate after the ship's political commissar gives him no choice. But Renko's insistence on learning the truth behind her death, rather than allowing her murder to be covered up as a suicide, results in threats by the commissar to block the visit to the United States, which in turn causes the workers to threaten Renko. Plot Arkady Renko, former Chief Investigator of the Moscow Town Prosecutor's Office, is serving a self-imposed exile in Siberia to avoid being detained for his actions in Gorky Park several years earlier, despite the Soviet Union's ostensibly increasing liberalization. He procures menial employment as a fish gutter on the \\"slime line\\" of a large Arctic Sea factory ship called the Polar Star, part of a joint Soviet-American fishing exercise within detente. He is brought to the attention of Viktor Marchuk, the ship's captain, after a young woman named Zina Patiashvili is found dead in a net full of freshly-caught fish. Due to his past as a homicide investigator, he is given the task of finding out what happened to her—to the dislike of political officer Volovoi. Hess, the ship's chief electrical engineer—an elaborate blind for his espionage activities—welcomes Arkady more warmly. Researching the girl's background, he discovers an open and somewhat radical Georgian personality, known for her many lovers (including the Captain, before she became a crew member) and fondness for underground music. Looking into her death also attracts the attention of the ship's main gang, led by Karp Korobetz—the ship's leading fisher and Arkady's former prisoner. The American corporate representative on board, Susan Hightower, takes an interest in the case. Arkady grows weary of the investigation, largely due to the obstructive actions of many of his shipmates—many of whom are concerned that it will delay a long-awaited shore leave at Dutch Harbour. Renko finally decides to go along with the original verdict of suicide, letting the ship's crew disembark. Though lacking proper authorization to go ashore himself, Arkady is sponsored in an impromptu shore leave by \\"Fleet Electrical Engineer\\" Hess. Whilst there, he starts to enter into a relationship with Susan before encountering Volovoi in a nearby dwelling. Volovoi threatens him but is killed by a disgruntled Karp, who then locks Arkady in and sets the building on fire. The investigator manages to escape and \\"accidentally\\" falls into the water to wash off any incriminating odors. Questions are raised, but nothing is decided. Arkady has no evidence against Karp and, having already survived an attempt on his life, fears he will be attacked again. Entering the icy North, the American trawler freezes into the ice whilst trailing the Polar Star. Arkady learns of Karp's relationship with Zina and her attempts to defect aboard the American ship, as well the secret spy cable running underneath the vessel that is operated by Hess. Arkady ventures out into the ice towards the American ship, and Karp casually follows and eventually catches up with him. On board they find evidence that Zina was killed and stowed on board in one of the lockers. Arkady also finds indications that the Americans were deceiving Hess by transmitting the acoustic signatures of numerous other decommissioned American vessels. Karp kills the killer, scaring off the Americans and allowing him and Renko to escape. After a final foiled attempt to finish Arkady off, Karp finally decides, with draconian Russian justice awaiting him back home, to drown himself in the icy water. When the Polar Star returns to Vladivostok, Arkady says farewell to Susan and his fellow crewmen, suddenly finding himself in the party's favour again.

He attended the College of William and Mary for two years, earning a teacher's certificate and working for a year as a teacher/principal in Northumberland County. Tuck then enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps and served in 1917 in the Caribbean.http://www.oldhalifax.com/airport/GovWilliamMTuck.html Tuck returned to attend law school at the Washington and Lee University School of Law, graduating in 1921. In 1929 he married widow (and former schoolteacher) Eva Lovelace Dillard (1891–1975), to whom he remained married until her death in 1975, raising her son Lester Layne (L.L.) Dillard Jr. as his own. Career Upon being admitted to Virginia bar, Tuck maintained a private legal practice in Halifax for decades, eventually with his stepson L.L. Dillard.http://www.richmond.com/entertainment/article_c6de0b92-7ff9-5969-bd9a-b94d71c087ce.html His career as an elected official began in 1923, when Halifax County voters elected Tuck as their delegate (a part-time position) to the Virginia General Assembly. He was re-elected once but declined to run for re-election in 1929, citing the need to grow his legal business to support his new family. However, when his elected successor died, Tuck was drafted in 1930 and served the remainder of the term. He was then elected to the Virginia State Senate in 1931, where he became a friend of U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, a former governor. During the national New Deal, state Senator Tuck worked to repeal Prohibition and sponsored new child labor laws, as well as an unemployment compensation system, old age assistance and jail reforms. He also helped develop the state park system. In 1941, Tuck sought statewide office, but Senator Byrd slated Colgate Darden to run for Governor of Virginia, so Tuck was slated for and won election as the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Virginia. He served from 1942 to 1946 under Governor Darden, and gained visibility throughout the Commonwealth. Tuck defeated his Republican opponent, S. Floyd Landreth by a 2 to 1 margin and won election as governor. As governor from 1946–1950, Tuck demonstrated his fiscal conservatism as a Dixiecrat by reorganizing state government and enacting a right-to-work law. He also created a state water pollution control agency, helped reform state schools and mental hospitals, as well as constructed roads. Governor Tuck gained national exposure, however, for labor unrest in his home state. He worked with Senator Harry Byrd to oppose President Harry Truman, although a fellow Democrat, especially Truman's plan to establish a Fair Employment Practices Commission. Once, as governor, Tuck drafted workers of the Virginia Electric Power Company into the state's national guard to avoid a threatened strike in an unionization effort. Transportation and coal also experienced labor unrest. Tuck's resumption of legal practice in South Boston after his governorship proved short-lived, for he rose within the Byrd Organization. In 1953 Tuck won election as a Democrat to U.S. Congress vacated by Thomas Bahnson Stanley who had resigned to run for Governor of Virginia. A militant segregationist, Congressman Tuck opposed most major items of civil rights legislation during the 1950s and 1960s. Like U.S. Senator Harry F. Byrd, Tuck promised \\"massive resistance\\" to the Supreme Court's 1954 and 1955 decisions banning segregation, Brown v. Board of Education, and helped draft the Stanley Plan—a series of state laws designed to legally avoid Brown, most of which were soon declared unconstitutional. He was a signatory to the 1956 Southern Manifesto. Tuck was a member of the U.S. House of Representative's Committee on Un- American Activities (HUAC) and vehemently opposed the Civil Rights Act of 1965. He was a delegate to Democratic National Conventions of 1948 and 1952, and in 1967 announced he would not seek reelection to Congress, citing health problems. He remained a power broker in the state for years. He retired from his law practice in South Boston in 1979, after suffering a stroke. Death and legacy He is buried beside his beloved wife in Oak Ridge Cemetery in South Boston. Virginia named highway 58 in Halifax County after Tuck, and elected a historical marker in his memory.http://www.markerhistory.com/william-munford- tuck-1896-1983-marker-u-51/ His personal papers, including papers from his time as congressman and governor, are held by the Special Collections Research Center at the College of William & Mary.

Solarz was keen in international relations of the United States and was both an outspoken critic of President Ronald Reagan's deployment of Marines to Lebanon in 1982 and a cosponsor of the 1991 Gulf War Authorization Act during the Presidency of George H. W. Bush.Steve Solarz (1940–2010) and the Making of Senator Schumer, Capital New York (Nov. 30, 2010) Early life and education Born in Manhattan, New York City, Solarz attended public schools in New York City. He graduated from Midwood High School, in Brooklyn, NY., in 1958, and later received a B.A. from Brandeis University in 1962 and an M.A. in public law and government from Columbia University in 1967. Solarz taught political science at Brooklyn College from 1967–1968.  New York Assembly  In 1966, Solarz was the campaign manager for an anti-war campaign, for a U.S. House seat. He used that experience to make a successful run for the State Assembly two years later. He was a member of the New York State Assembly from 1969 to 1974, sitting in the 178th, 179th and 180th New York State Legislatures. In the 1973 Democratic primary, Solarz ran against Sebastian Leone for Brooklyn borough president, and lost. That was not unexpected; Solarz had run mostly for improved name recognition and to make political and fund-raising contacts. In 1974, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Mid-term Convention. Career in Congress = Election and re-elections = In September 1974, Solarz defeated incumbent Democrat Bertram L. Podell in the Democratic primary for the New York 13th District. At the time, Podell was under federal indictment; he was later convicted. In November 1974, Solarz was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, to the 94th Congress, beginning January 3, 1975. He was re-elected eight more times, serving until January 3, 1993. = Involvement in foreign policy = On July 18, 1980, Solarz became the first American public official to visit North Korea since the end of the Korean War, and the first to meet with Kim Il-sung.Facts on File 1980 Yearbook p 547 In the 1980s, he chaired the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, an area of growing interest to the American people in that decade. He is remembered for his leadership on the Philippines. He left Manila just as Benigno S. Aquino Jr. was coming home to challenge President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Following Aquino's assassination, Solarz returned to Manila for the funeral and proceeded to push the Reagan administration to distance itself from the Marcos government. Shortly after Marcos left for exile in Hawaii, Solarz was visiting at one of the opulent palaces and publicized Imelda's massive shoe collection. He worked closely with Aquino's widow, Corazon, who became president, and who dubbed him the \\"Lafayette of the Philippines.\\" Solarz had strong ties to India and was held in high esteem by Indian leaders across the political spectrum. His motivations were partly driven by the presence of prosperous Indian Americans in his district. He visited India dozens of times, during and after his term in Congress, and once received a standing ovation on the floor of the Indian Parliament, as has happened to only a few Westerners, among them Bill Clinton and John F. Kennedy. He received bipartisan credit for having helped set the stage for substantial improvements in U.S.-India relations since the 1990s.The New York Times In 1982 and 1986, Solarz met with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. In 1998 he led a group of neoconservatives urging President Bill Clinton to overthrow him. = Loss in primary, 1992 = The round of redistricting following the 1990 Census divided his district into six pieces, reflecting his cold relations with many state lawmakers in Albany. After conducting extensive polling, Solarz decided that rather than challenge Democratic incumbent Ted Weiss or Republican incumbent S. William Green, he would seek election to the open seat in the heavily Hispanic 12th Congressional District. Solarz entered the race damaged by the House banking scandal, having written 743 overdrafts; he was not charged, but his wife pled guilty to two criminal charges of writing bad checks on their joint account. Solarz was defeated in the Democratic primary by Nydia Velazquez. Neither Weiss nor Green were re-elected, as Weiss died before the election and was replaced on the ballot by Jerrold Nadler, while Green was defeated by Democrat Carolyn Maloney.  Post-Congressional career  Solarz was appointed by President Bill Clinton as chairman of the U.S. government-funded Central Asian-American Enterprise Fund to bring private sector development to central Asia and served from 1993 to 1998. In 1994, Solarz was a leading candidate to be nominated as the United States Ambassador to India, however Solarz was forced to withdraw from consideration after scrutiny of his efforts to obtain a visa for a Hong Kong businessman with a criminal record. Solarz's poor relations with members of the foreign service and the New York state political establishment were also identified as reasons for the failure of his nomination. The post instead went to Frank G. Wisner. Since 1994, Solarz had remained active with the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs. He was also a member of the Intellibridge Expert Network and of the executive committee of the International Crisis Group. Solarz was also co- chairman of the American Committee for Peace in the Caucasus, along with Zbigniew Brzezinski.

Life He was born at Truro in Cornwall, the son of Patrick Mackennal, a Scot, who had settled there. In 1848 the family removed to London, and at sixteen he went to the University of Glasgow. In 1854 he entered Hackney College to prepare for the Congregational ministry, and in 1857 he graduated BA at the University of London. After holding pastorates at Burton upon Trent (1856–1861), Surbiton (1862–1870), Leicester (1870–1876), he finally accepted the pastorate of the Congregational Church at Bowdon, Cheshire, in 1877, in which he remained till his death. In 1886, he was chairman of the Congregational Union, which he represented in 1889 at the triannual national council of the American Congregational churches. The first international council of Congregationalists held in London in 1891 was partly cause, partly consequence, of his visit, and Mackennal acted as secretary. In 1892 he became definitely associated in the public mind with a movement for free church federation which grew out of a series of meetings held to discuss the question of home reunion. When the Lambeth articles put forward as a basis of union were discussed, it was evident that all the free churches were agreed in accepting the three articles dealing with the Bible, the Creed and the Sacraments as a basis of discussion, and were also agreed in rejecting the fourth article, which put the historic episcopate on the same level as the other three. Omitting the Anglicans, the representatives of the remaining churches resolved to develop Christian fellowship by united action and worship wherever possible. Out of this grew the Free Church Federation, which secures a measure of co-operation between the Protestant Evangelical churches throughout England. Mackennal's public action brought him into association with many well-known political and religious leaders. He was a lifelong advocate of international peace, and made a remarkable declaration as to the Christian standard of national action when the Free Church Federation met at Leeds during the South African War in 1900. Besides a volume of sermons under the title Christ's Healing Touch, Mackennal published The Biblical Scheme of Nature and of Man, The Christian Testimony, the Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia, The Kingdom of the Lord Jesus and The Eternal God and the Human Sonship. These are contributions to exegetical study or to theological and progressive religious thought, and have elements of permanent value. He also made some useful contributions to religious history. In 1893 he published the Story of the English Separatists, and later the Homes and Haunts of the Pilgrim Fathers; he also wrote the life of Dr JA Macfadyen of Manchester. In 1901 he delivered a series of lectures at Hartford Theological Seminary, Connecticut, USA, published under the title The Evolution of Congregationalism. He died at Highgate on 23 June 1904. See D.

The earliest exploration of Seven-star Cave dates back to the Tang dynasty, about 1,300 years ago. The name can also be rendered Seven Stars Cave, Cave of Seven Stars, etc. The cave has a year-round temperature of about 20 Celsius. The maximum ceiling height inside is 27 metres, and the maximum width is 49 metres. A concrete and stone tour path of approximately 1,000 metres runs through the cave between its entrance and exit points. Artificial lighting for walkways and displays is staged throughout, including colored accents, and various formations have been given names such as \\"A Natural Fresco\\" and \\"The Chessboard\\". During the Japanese invasion of China in World War II, Guilin residents took refuge in the cave complex. The cave has scheduled tours about once per hour, conducted in Mandarin Chinese, usually with a megaphone irrespective of group size, explaining in detail the origins of various formation names, such as a dragon eating a bear, or a bear catching a tiger. The tour cannot easily be walked independently of groups, since the lights inside the cave are turned off behind the groups as they walk away.

It is colloquially referred to by students and faculty as \\"Walls\\". The school is based on a concept in urban education that encourages students to \\"use the city as a classroom\\", which is the origin of its name. SWW offers a college-preparatory academic curriculum with 22 AP courses. It is part of the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) system and draws students from all parts of the city. Applicants must earn a 3.0 GPA and meet or exceed expectations on the PARCC exam during their eighth-grade year. Through the application process, they complete a multiple choice test, written essay, and interview with teachers and current students. As part of the school's partnership with George Washington University, teachers and students are able to take dual enrollment classes at the university. Students in the GW Early College Program graduate with a high school diploma from School Without Walls and Associate of Arts degree from George Washington University.  School history  The school was established in 1971 following the model of the Parkway Program in the School District of Philadelphia. The goal was to create a learning environment that offered an alternative to the conventional programs. They started with fifty students, six teachers, and one administrator.School Without Walls of Washington, DC – Home & School Association » Our History The school is located on the George Washington University (GWU) campus, on G Street intersecting 21st Street NW. Founded in 1971, the School Without Walls was originally located on the 8th floor of 1411 K St., an office building. In the fall of 1973 the school relocated to 10th and H Streets, N.W., where SWW shared space with the Webster Girls School program, a program for pregnant teens. It then moved to 1619 M St.,N.W. in the mid 70's. In August 2007, Walls was relocated to Capitol Hill in the Logan School building on G Street NE between Second and Third Streets NE (near Union Station and adjacent to the Securities & Exchange Commission headquarters). This temporary home was used for two years while the original building was renovated. The Logan School was renovated—including a new roof and internal work—during the summer of 2007 to accept students. In August 2009, The School Without Walls moved back into the Grant School following an opening ceremony by Mayor Adrian Fenty, DCPS chancellor Michelle Rhee and GWU President Steven Knapp. In August 2011, School Without Walls was forced to temporarily close, because of damage sustained to the building's walls and roof during the earthquake and Hurricane Irene a few days later.14 Schools without Power In spite of resistance from parents and students, SWW merged with the nearby Francis-Stevens Education Campus, renamed School Without Walls at Francis Stevens, in 2014. Francis-Stevens, which serves preschool through eighth grade, was underenrolled and slated for closure, while the School Without Walls building was too small for the student body. The two schools now share an administration, though Francis-Stevens is non- selective and graduates are not guaranteed entrance to School Without Walls High School. SWW students do not take classes at Francis-Stevens, because of the distance between the buildings and because Francis-Stevens quickly became more popular, attaining a waitlist of over 900 in 2016.  Historic building  Grant School during renovations The School Without Walls facility, historically known as the Ulysses S. Grant School, is located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood. Prior to be taken over by School Without Walls, the building was badly deteriorated. There was extensive water damage throughout the school, the brick facade needed to be repainted, and the slate roof was steadily losing its shingles. On February 13, 2006 the D.C. City Council and the George Washington University Board of Trustees approved a deal for $12 million to renovate and expand the school building in exchange for transfer of the school's rear parking lot property to the university. The old facade was kept intact while the inside was renovated and remodeled. A new building was added as an additional wing to accommodate increasing enrollment.  Student body  In 2010, 52% of SWW freshmen came from DCPS middle schools and 33% from charter middle schools. The school received more than 1,300 applications for 140 spots in the freshman class for the 2018-19 school year. During the 2017-18 school year, SWW students were 43% Caucasian, 31% African-American, 12% Hispanic/Latino, 8% Asian, and 5% multiracial. The student body was also 12% economically disadvantaged and 60% female. SWW has the lowest numbers of minority and at-risk students among DCPS high schools. In 2019, DCPS rolled out a pilot program to allow students ranked in the top 15 at their schools to take the SWW admissions test even if they had not met the minimum criteria of meeting or exceeding expectations on the PARCC. The objective was to determine if relaxing standardized testing requirements would diversify the SWW student body. However, as DCPS did not inform prospective parents of the program, the 226 students affected were not ultimately permitted to take the admissions test.  Academic achievements  Walls was named a National Blue Ribbon School September 9, 2010, one of only 304 schools nationwide. The Blue Ribbon Schools Program recognizes and honors public and private elementary, middle and high schools whose students achieve at very high levels or have made significant progress and helped close gaps in achievement, especially among disadvantaged and minority students.

The school's averaged combined score was 1272 in 2018. In 2018, 80% of Walls students who took an AP exam earned a passing score of at least 3.  Sporting achievements  Walls competes in the DCIAA and offers the following sports: baseball, basketball, bowling, cheerleading, cross-country, field hockey, flag football, golf, indoor track, lacrosse, outdoor track, soccer, squash, swimming, softball, tennis, ultimate frisbee, and weightlifting. Before the school adopted the penguin as its mascot, its teams were informally called the Walls. The SWW volleyball team won the school's first DCIAA title in 1997. The Track and Field team went to the Penn Relay 2011. The softball team won the citywide championship in 2011 and 2012. A Walls student won Gatorade Player of the Year for Girls Outdoor Track and Field in 2017, the first time a Walls student won that award in any sport.https://currentnewspapers.com/sprinter-from-walls-receives-schools- first-gatorade-award/ School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens School Without Walls at Francis-Stevens is a pre-K 3 to 8th-grade school that shares an administration with School Without Walls High School. It is located in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood and operated by DC Public Schools. Unlike the high school, it is a traditional public school that primarily accepts students based on its enrollment boundary. Students may also enroll through the DC School Lottery if there is available space. Middle school graduates are not guaranteed a place at School Without Walls High School. Instead, they feed into Cardozo Education Campus for ninth grade. Ross and Thomson elementary school graduates may transfer to Francis-Stevens in sixth grade. The school had issues with low enrollment for decades, creating the first extended-day program in the District of Columbia in 1977 in an effort to appeal to parents who worked in the neighborhood. The persistent problem led to the merger of Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School and Francis Junior High School in 2008 and then the decision to close Francis-Stevens Education Campus in 2014.

Shalva Chigirinsky, head of the tower's development company, indicated that the financial crisis of 2007–2008 had left him unable to secure financing for the project and had also removed demand for the tower's office space, even if the building were able to be completed. On 3 December, Russian oil company Sibir Energy agreed to buy a number of real estate assets, including Russia Tower, from Chigirinsky. As Chigirinsky was a major shareholder in Sibir Energy, the purpose of the purchase was to alleviate financial pressures upon him, so that he would not be forced to sell his company shares, which in turn enable the company to preserve its existing shareholder structure. However, many business news analysts decried the move, arguing that such use of the oil company's business capital to assist Chigirinsky by purchasing his economically distressed real estate assets--which had no relation to the company's core oil business--at possibly inflated prices was detrimental to the company's shareholders and constituted a significant conflict of interest.Warner, Jeremy.

In June 2009, the project was officially cancelled, to be turned into a parking lot for existing buildings. However, a smaller building is planned to be built on the site eventually.

He married Sarah Saxon in 1819 and, after her death, he married Anna Eliza Shaw in 1821.  Career  In 1833, Houston and his family moved to Williamsport, Maury County, Tennessee. Here he farmed and was a member of the church. He and his wife raised their family, losing several children to infectious diseases. For a brief period, he moved to Paducah, but returned to Williamsport. In 1847, injured when his wagon overturned, he determined that he would have to seek alternative means of earning a living.

However, Houston County in central Georgia is said to have been named after John Houstoun who was governor of Georgia for several terms in the 18th century, Houston County, Georgia, and after whom some would erroneously claim John Houstoun the original name of Houston Street in Atlanta which was originally named after Oswald Houston.  Clarification on pronunciation  The pronunciation of his last name causes some friendly, and at times not-so-friendly, contention between natives of Georgia and Texas. He pronounced his last name \\"HOUSE-tun\\" and the (former) street name was also pronounced that way as is Houston Mill Road in Decatur, Georgia, named after the mill that was built by his son Washington Jackson Houston. Almost everyone who is not from Georgia will pronounce it in the way of the city in Texas, \\"HYOOS-tun\\", and will be quickly corrected by native Georgians.  Disambiguation  With the surname pronounced differently but spelled the same, Oswald has sometimes been said to be a relative of Sam Houston whose ancestry evolved in the same region but there is no documented linkage at this time.

Life He was born in Finsbury Square, London, on 20 February 1813, was the tenth child of Peter Berthon, and his wife, Elizabeth Green Park,https://archive.org/stream/pedigreeregister03sociuoft#page/48/mode/2up daughter of Henry Park of Liverpool, who were married in 1797. His father was great-grandson of St. Pol le Berthon, the only son of the Huguenot Marquis de Chatellerault, who escaped the persecutions that followed the revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685. He found a refuge in Lisbon, whence his son proceeded to London. Peter Berthon was an army contractor, who was reduced from wealth to comparative poverty by the wreck of a number of his ships and the end of the war on the downfall of Napoleon. Berthon was at school in Wanstead and then at the Monoux School Walthamstow (of which he left a memoir (quoted in Pond. Sir George Monoux's school Walthamstow 1527-1977, pub 1977 and quoted at https://oldmonovians.com/history/the- first-400-years/1820-1889.html). From there, he studied medicine in Liverpool and Dublin, but after his marriage in 1834 he gave up his intention of becoming a doctor, and travelled for about six years on the continent. Keenly interested from boyhood in mechanical science, he made experiments in the application of the screw propeller for boats. But his model, with a two-bladed propeller, was only ridiculed when it was placed before the British admiralty. Berthon therefore did not complete the patent and the idea was left for Francis Smith to bring out more successfully in 1838. In 1841 he entered Magdalene College, Cambridge, in order to study for the Church. There he produced what is usually known as \\"Berthon's log\\", in which the suction produced by the water streaming past the end of a pipe projected below a ship is registered on a mercury column above. In 1845, he was ordained, and after holding a curacy at Lymington was given a living at Fareham. Here he was able to carry on experiments with his log, which was tested on the Southampton to Jersey steamboats; but the British admiralty gave him no encouragement, and it remained uncompleted. He then designed some instruments to indicate the trim and rolling of boats at sea; but the idea for which he is chiefly remembered was that of the \\"Berthon Folding Boat\\" in 1849. This invention was again adversely reported on by the admiralty. Berthon resigned his living at Fareham, and subsequently accepted the living of Romsey. In 1873, encouraged by Samuel Plimsoll, he again applied himself to perfecting his collapsible boat. Success was at last achieved, and in less than a year he had received orders from the admiralty for boats to the amount of £15,000. Some were taken by Sir George Nares to the Arctic, others were sent to General Gordon at Khartoum, and others again were taken to the Zambezi by Frederick Selous. Alain Gerbault used one as his tender in his famous 1923-1929 solo circumnavigation aboard his 39' sailboat Firecrest. He died at the vicarage, Romsey, on 27 October 1899.

The track hosted two NASCAR K&N; Pro Series West events between 2012 and 2013. The track also hosted one NASCAR Midwest Series race in 2004. Brainerd International Raceway was damaged during a severe thunderstorm that struck portions of Minnesota on July 12, 2015. Track Information Brainerd International Raceway consists of 2 road tracks and 1 drag strip. =Donnybrooke Road Course= Brainerd International Raceway maintains the original name of the now 50-year-old course. The course is used for automotive and motorcycle racing. The 3.1-mile Donnybrooke Road Course has 10 turns and is considered wide – the main straight is 60 feet wide. There is essentially no elevation change. BIR is a high-speed course; vehicles can reach speeds of nearly 180 mph and take the slowest corners around 80 mph. There are wide runoff areas at most of the corners, which makes BIR's road course extremely safe. This configuration uses the dragstrip as part of the course. =Competition Road Course= The 2009 racing season was the first for the 2.5 mile course which was completed the previous summer. Turn 1 on the 2.5-mile Competition Road Course is the same as Turn 1 on the three-mile road course. Turn 1 is a narrow but very high-speed banked right-hand 60-degree turn, which is intended be taken flat out by all vehicles. Turns 1 through 8 of the original 3.1-mile road course are used for the new circuit. At Turn 8, a 240-degree right-hand Clover Leaf transitions drivers from the old course to the new stretch of asphalt that winds its way back across the infield, eventually tying back into the original circuit just before Turn 1, avoiding the dragstrip. In all, the Competition Road Course features 13 turns and very little elevation change. =Dragstrip= The dragstrip dates back to 1969, when BIR converted the mile-long straightaway on its road course to a drag strip and hosted an NHRA Divisional Points Race. In 1977, BIR hosted the Crown Auto Funny Car Championships and the Crown Auto Winston Points Championship. It was reconstructed in 2005, adding a 700-foot concrete launch pad and new asphalt for the remaining 600 feet was installed. Tony Schumacher, set the world record for top fuel dragsters with a run in 2005. This speed and time are recorded at the end of a standing start quarter mile acceleration race, before the NHRA shortened top fuel and funny car races to the current since 2008.

Mayo's senior Gaelic football team play in the Connacht Senior Football Championship. Mayo have three All-Ireland Senior Football Championship wins--1936, 1950, 1951 and have won the greatest number of National Football League titles consecutively (6 from 1934 to 1939). Mayo are also currently the longest serving team the National Football League (Ireland) division 1, having played there since 1997. Mayo have in recent times become known for reaching All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Finals only to fall at the ultimate hurdle. Mayo hold the Championship record for consecutive losing All-Ireland Senior Football Final appearances, this currently stands at nine. In 1989, they reached their first All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final since their last previous appearance in 1951 only to lose to Cork. In 1996, a freak point by Meath at the end of the final forced a replay, which saw Mayo concede another late score that would deny them victory. Kerry bridged an 11-year title gap against them in 1997 with a three-point win, before torturing them by eight points in 2004 and thirteen points in 2006. Mayo returned to the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final in 2012 only for Donegal to bridge a 20-year gap between titles, helped in no small part by a nightmare opening quarter for Mayo as Michael Murphy launched a rocket of a shot into the goal after three minutes. Then, in the eleventh minute, Colm McFadden seized the ball from the grasp of Kevin Keane and slid it into the net for a second Donegal goal. Mayo managed thirteen points to Donegal's two goals and eleven, only got on the scoresheet after sixteen minutes when already two goals behind and never led during the match. 2013 saw Mayo in the final again, and once more coming up short, this time being seen off by Dublin, who won by a single point. 2016 likewise, a single point against Dublin, though this time after a replay; the drawn game featuring two own goals by Mayo players. In the 2017 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final after a thrilling final, Mayo yet again lost to Dublin by a single point. Mayo have now lost 9 finals since 1989 and have not won the All-Ireland since 1951. Crest, colours and supporters The team's traditional colours are green and red. The Mayo jersey will commonly be mostly green, with a thick horizontal red stripe just below chest level. These colours are inspired by \\"The Green Above The Red\\", a rebel song. County Mayo coat of arms Mayo's current crest is based on the county's coat of arms, which is shown on the left. It features four crosses, each representing a diocese of the Catholic Church in Mayo. The Patriarchal or 'double' cross represents the Archdiocese of Tuam, while the three smaller Passion crosses represent Achonry, Killala and Galway/Kilmacduagh/Kilfenora. The Irish root word of the county, Maigh Eo, means \\"plain of the yew trees\\", and the trees that surround the crest represent this. As well as this, the number of trees is significant, with the nine trees representing the number of baronies in the county. The sailing ship represents the county's maritime history, while the red sea below the green hills represents the traditional \\"green above the red\\" motif of the county. The Mayo GAA crest also features the Irish words Críost Linn, which translates to \\"Christ be with us\\". Traditionally a football county, Mayo have always had a large support at minor, U21 and senior level. =Kit evolution= Football =County team= Though not affiliated through the 1890s, there is strong evidence of GAA activity in Mayo and the rivalry with Galway that brought success to both counties from the 1930s on was already in evidence. This history between Mayo and Galway has produced two of the finest footballing teams in the game. Between them, the two teams have more than three quarters of the Connacht titles that have been contested. Mayo have an unequalled number of consecutive National Football League titles. The Mayo team were champions in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, 1938, and 1939. One of the great turning points in GAA history west of the Shannon was the 1935 Connacht Final when 26,000 turned out to see National League Champions Mayo beat the All-Ireland champions Galway in Roscommon. In the 1936 Connacht Final Mayo were leading by a goal in the last minute when Brendan Nestor scored an equalising goal for Galway – he raised the flag himself and caused a riot. However, Mayo won the replay and went on to capture their first All-Ireland Title, beating Laois by 4–11 (23) to 0–5 (5) in the final. The following year, 1937, they were the victim of a Louis Blessing last-minute goal in the All Ireland Semi-Final against Cavan in another match that featured a pitch invasion. It ended Mayo's run of 57 matches without defeat. Mayo dominated the National Football League for six years, but pulled out of the 1939–40 league in a grievance over the 1939 semi-final, a bad-tempered draw and replay with Kerry. Mayo returned to the competition to win their seventh National Football League title in 1941. Unfortunately, due to World War II, the league was suspended for four seasons until 1946, and Mayo were unable to add to these successes. Following Mayo's 1939 Connacht Final victory, it took the team nine years to emerge from Connacht again, but they narrowly lost the 1948 All- Ireland Final to Cavan and 1949 semi-final to Meath. However, they returned to Croke Park in 1950 to win an extraordinary All-Ireland Title when Louth's Sean Boyle had his kick-out charged down and Mick Flanagan broke through for a freak winning goal, Mayo winning the game by 2–5 (11) to 1–6 (9). In 1951 Mayo retained the All-Ireland Title, winning their third title overall, with three late points from Pádraig Carney (known as the flying doctor because he had returned from the United States to play the game) giving Mayo a 2–8 (14) to 0–9 (9) win over Meath. During this period, Mayo also won the National Football League in 1949 and 1954, their eight and ninth titles in this competition. Eight wides and a one-point defeat in the replayed 1955 All- Ireland Semi-Final against Dublin brought this particular era to an end. Mayo went 12 years without winning another Connacht Championship title, until the Mayo team of the late 1960s won the Connacht Championship in 1967 (destroying Galway's 4-in-a-row All-Ireland hopes in the process) and again in 1969. Mayo also added their tenth National League Title to their collection in 1970, beating Down in the final on a scoreline of 4–7 (19) to 0–10 (10). Despite this success, the 1970s was arguably the least successful decade in the history of Mayo football, as the team failed to win a Connacht Championship title throughout the decade, coming closest when losing the 1975 final to Sligo following a replay. While the team had not won an All-Ireland title since 1951, nor even qualified for the final, the 1980s saw a marked improvement in the team's fortunes. A twelve-year gap was finally bridged in 1981 when Sligo were defeated in the Connacht Final on a scoreline of 0-12 to 0-4 at McHale Park, which was followed by a heavy defeat to a great Kerry side, 1-6 to 2-19. Mayo were on the opposite side of the draw to Galway in 1985, and easy victories over Leitrim (semi-final) and Roscommon in the final, saw them claim the Nestor Cup. The final was notable as it saw the retirement of Roscommon great Dermot Earley, Snr, who was chaired from the pitch by the Mayo players at the end of the match. Dublin lay in wait in the All-Ireland Semi-Final, and Mayo's first championship meeting with the Dubs since 1955 ended in a draw 1-13 to 1-13. The first match saw Mayo player John Finn's jaw broken in mysterious circumstances and tension was high for the replay. However, despite a goal from Padraig Brogan, Dublin made easy work of Mayo in the end, running out winners by eight points, 2-12 to 1-7. Despite this, the year marked as close as Mayo had come to an All Ireland Final since 1955. The 1989 season saw former player John O'Mahony take over as manager, and after mixed results in the league, an epic championship ensued. After a draw in the Connacht Semi-Final against Galway in Tuam, Mayo won the replay 2-13 to 1-8 in Castlebar, with goals from Liam McHale and Anthony 'Larry' Finnerty. The final was played in Castlebar against Roscommon and this too resulted in a draw, 0-12 to 1-9. A further 70 minutes in Dr. Hyde Park a week later also could not separate the teams, with Mayo eventually running out winners 3-14 to 2-13 after extra time. A scrappy game in the All-Ireland semi-final against Tyrone ended with Mayo as winners 0-12 to 1-6, and was made famous by the iconic image of a bandaged Willie Joe Padden. Mayo's first All-Ireland Final appearance in 38 years was against Cork, runners up from the previous two seasons. Cork's experience told in the final, and despite a goal by substitute Finnerty in the middle of the second half, Cork ran out winners on a scoreline of 0–17 to 1–11. Despite winning Connacht titles in 1992 and 1993, the early 1990s was a largely unsuccessful period for Mayo, as Connacht football in general suffered a severe drop in standards between 1990 and 1995. John Maughan, who had achieved some notable successes as manager of Clare including a 1992 Munster Championship title win, was brought in as manager in an effort to improve the team's standing. Maughan was a former Mayo player and Defence Forces officer. He was renowned for the physical fitness regime he imposed on his teams, and the improvements were swift. Mayo won Division 3 of the National League in 1996 before going on to win their third Connacht title of the decade, overcoming Galway in the final. Maughan's side produced their performance of the year in the All-Ireland Semi-Final against Kerry, winning by 2–13 to 1–10, a lobbed goal from 40 metres by James Horan in the last minute of the game sealing the victory. This was Mayo's first victory against Kerry in the championship since 1951. In the All-Ireland Final against Meath Ray Dempsey's 45th-minute goal gave Mayo a lead of six points; however a Meath comeback, culminating in a last-minute Colm Coyle long-range point, saw the game end in a draw on a scoreline of 1–9 to 0–12. During a bad-tempered replay – which included a brawl in which Coyle and Liam McHale, one of Mayo's most influential players, was sent off – Mayo led by four points at half-time only to succumb to a Tommy Dowd goal, losing the game by one-point on a scoreline of 2–9 to 1–11. Mayo retained the Connacht title in 1997, beating Galway, Leitrim and Sligo in the final. The Galway win was notable as it was Mayo's first victory in Tuam in over 30 years. Mayo went on to reach their second successive All-Ireland Final following a 0–13 to 0–7 victory over the Leinster Champions, Offaly. However, Mayo again lost out in the final, losing by 0–13 to 1–7 to Kerry in a poor game illuminated by the skill of Kerry forward Maurice Fitzgerald. Mortimer was again honoured with an All Star, with only Pat Fallon joining him from the ranks of the Mayo team. In 1999 Mayo returned to Division 1 of the National Football League and another Connacht title (Mayo's fifth of the decade) followed, after wins over New York, Roscommon and Galway in the final. However, Mayo failed to reach another All-Ireland Final falling to Cork 2-12 to 0-12 in the semi-final. Manager John Maughan resigned after four tumultuous seasons. In 2004, and with Maughan having returned as manager, Mayo regained the Connacht title with ease following facile wins over New York, Galway and Roscommon, with none of these teams able to finish their matches within five points of Mayo. Mayo followed this success with a surprise victory over reigning All-Ireland Champions Tyrone in the All-Ireland Quarter Final on a scoreline of 0–16 to 1–09. However, Mayo's form rapidly deteriorated following this win, and the team struggled to see off surprise semi-finalists Fermanagh following a replay before losing the All-Ireland Final to Kerry by eight points on a scoreline of 1–20 to 2–9. James Nallen and Ciarán McDonald made the All Stars team that year. Mayo failed to retain their Connacht title in 2005 losing to Galway in the final. A three-point victory over Cavan in the qualifiers led to a three-point All-Ireland Quarter-Final defeat to Kerry, bringing to an end Maughan's second spell as manager. In 2006, Mickey Moran became Mayo's first manager from outside the county since Jack O'Shea managed the team in the early 1990s. Moran guided the team to another Connacht title, beating Galway by a point in the final. Following an unconvincing replay victory over Laois in the All-Ireland Quarter-Final, in the Semi-Final against Dublin Mayo produced arguably their greatest performance since the defeat of Kerry ten years previously. Even before the game started tensions were raised by Mayo warming up into the Hill 16 end. They were soon joined by Dublin, and some jostling occurred between players and management teams. The match itself was of high quality and resulted in Mayo coming from seven points behind with 20 minutes remaining to defeat favourites Dublin on a scoreline of 1–16 to 2–12. Ciarán McDonald's winning point from under the Hogan Stand was a particular highlight. Kerry again awaited Mayo in the All Ireland Final and for the third time in 10 years they defeated Mayo, this time on a scoreline of 4–15 to 3–5. Despite the relative success of the 2006 season, rumours persisted of divisions between Moran and the Mayo County Board and Moran was not retained as manager for the 2007 season. In 2007, John O'Mahony returned as Mayo manager following a 16-year absence during which he had won a Connacht title with Leitrim (1994) as well as two All-Ireland titles with Galway (1998 and 2001) and in his first season led the team to the National League Final, where they were defeated by Donegal. Well beaten by Galway in the Connacht Final, they exited the Championship in the second round of the Qualifiers at the hands of Derry in Celtic Park, Derry, a game in which Ciarán McDonald made his final appearance for Mayo off the bench. An injury time point by Peader Gardiner saw Mayo win their first Connacht title since O'Mahony's return, and their 42nd title overall, when they beat Galway in the 2009 Connacht Final on a scoreline of 2–12 to 1–14. However, defeat to Meath followed in the All-Ireland Quarter Final, 2-15 to 1-15. MacHale Park in November 2016 2010 was a nadir for Mayo; despite reaching the National League Final, they were beaten by Cork, and defeat in the Connacht Championship first round by Sligo was followed up by an All-Ireland Qualifier Round 1 loss to Longford. John O'Mahony immediately stepped down as Mayo manager following the game. =The Final's Era= A period from 2011 until 2017 where the Mayo team consistently featured in either the All Ireland Semi Final or All Ireland final. Mayo featured in four All Ireland finals during this period, earning a replay and losing by a single point three times. After O'Mahony was replaced by James Horan for the 2011 campaign. Horan had won a Mayo Senior Football Championship with Ballintubber as manager the previous year. After suffering a scare in London in the first round of the 2011 Connacht Championship, Mayo won that years Championship by beating Roscommon in a rain sodden Dr. Hyde Park. Mayo were underdogs going into the All-Ireland Quarter Final against reigning All-Ireland Champions Cork, but won by four points. The Championship ended at the Semi-Final stage with a nine-point defeat to Kerry, but the improved performances augured well for the future.\\"Old habits stand to Tyrone in endgame\\". The Irish Times (8 August 2008). Mayo reached the final of the National Football League in 2012, but lost out to Cork 2-10 to 0-11. Mayo retained the Connacht title with wins over Leitrim and Sligo before defeating Down in the Quarter Final. Facing reigning champions Dublin in the Semi Final, Mayo survived a Dublin fightback to win 0-19 to 0-16 and reach their first final since 2006. Conceding two goals in the first eleven minutes, Mayo lost the 2012 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final to Donegal by 2-11 to 0-13. Four Mayo players earned All Stars, first timers Ger Cafferkey, Keith Higgins and Lee Keegan being joined by Alan Dillon for his second. In 2013, Mayo easily won their third consecutive Connacht Championship, defeating Galway by 17 points, Roscommon by 12 points and London by 16 points, in what was a novel final. They gained revenge against Donegal for the previous year in the Quarter Final, running out winners 4-17 to 1-10. A 6-point win over Tyrone saw Mayo return to the final, this time to face Dublin. A close game saw Dublin win by a single point on a scoreline of 2-12 to 1-14. Higgins and Keegan won their second All Stars, along with a first for Colm Boyle and Aidan O'Shea. Entering his fourth year as manager, Horan guided Mayo to another Connacht title after wins over New York, Roscommon and a final victory over Galway, 3-14 to 0-16. A one-point win over Cork led to Semi-Final match up against Kerry. A fantastic second half performance led to Mayo leading by 5 points going into the last five minutes, however a Kieren Donaghy goal saw the game end in a draw, 1-16 apiece. Controversially, the replay was fixed for Limerick's Gaelic Grounds due to the unavailability of Croke Park owing to an American Football game taking place there. Another epic match ensued, with the sides once more all square after 70 minutes. Kerry managed to pull away in extra-time, eventually winning 3-16 to 3-13. James Horan stepped down immediately afterwards, having done much to restore the pride to Mayo football, albeit falling just short of winning the All-Ireland. All-Ireland final in 2017280px Stephen Rochford was selected as Mayo manager for 2016, and a poor league campaign nonetheless saw the side stay in Division 1 of the league for an 18th consecutive year. Going for a sixth successive Connacht title, hot favourites Mayo were shocked in the semi-final by Galway, who ran out winners 0-12 to 1-12. However, Mayo battled through the Qualifiers with unconvincing wins against Fermanagh, Kildare and Westmeath to reach a Quarter Final against Tyrone. In a tight game, Mayo won by a point 0-13 to 0-12. Surprise packets Tipperary awaited in the Semi-Final, which Mayo won 2-13 to 0-14 to set up an All-Ireland Final meeting with Dublin. The game ended in a draw, Mayo battled back after conceding two unfortunate own goals from Kevin McLoughlin and Colm Boyle. Cillian O'Connor got a 77th minute equalising point to bring it to a replay, the game finishing 0-15 to 2-09. The replay ended yet another All-Ireland Final defeat by a single point. Cillian O'Connor had the chance with a free to bring the game to extra time in the 76th minute he missed it. It finished 1-15 to 1-14. It took Mayo eight games to get to the All-Ireland final in 2017. A bad start turned into a roller coaster, and after their loss to Galway would need extra time in two matches to ultimately end up in the final. After a quick concession of a goal to Dublin, Mayo took grip of the final and were in control for most of the first half, leading by a point at half time. However, Dublin bounced back and a late free deep into extra time would see Dublin edge out winners, on a score line of 1-17 to 1-16, beating Mayo by a point for the second year in a row. Hurling Although not a traditional hurling county, hurling is strong in certain parts of the county especially in the eastern region around Ballyhaunis and Tooreen. There are 4 Senior hurling clubs in Mayo, who compete for the TJ Tyrell Senior Hurling Championship each year. These 4 clubs are Tooreen, Ballyhaunis, Castlebar Mitchels, Westport. Ballyhaunis are the reigning Senior Champions and have 6 senior titles, while Tooreen hold the most titles with 26. These 4 clubs provide the players to the Mayo Senior hurling panel, who take part in the National Hurling League and in the All-Ireland Christy Ring (Tier 2) Cup. Mayo's best performances in the Christy Ring Cup came in 2008 and 2009, when the Mayo side fell at the semi- final stage to Carlow and Down respectively. The Mayo U-21 hurling team compete in the Connacht U-21B hurling championship each year along with Roscommon, Sligo and Leitrim. Hurling at underage level is also expanding in Mayo, with 10 clubs competing in underage leagues and championships in the county. As well as the 6 adult sides named above, 4 other underage clubs have formed in recent years. These clubs are Ballyvary, Moytura, Caiseal Gaels and Claremorris. These 10 clubs provide the players for the Mayo underage hurling development panels. Mayo have development panels at U14, U15, U16 and Minor age-groups, and compete in the All-Ireland 'B' competitions each year. Mayo's most famous hurlers are Joe Henry (Tooreen), who won Railway Cup medals with Connacht in the 1980s, and current dual player Keith Higgins (Ballyhaunis) who played for the Mayo football team in the All-Ireland football final in 2006, 2012, 2103 and 2016. Hurling in Mayo is administered by the Mayo GAA Hurling Committee, which is a sub-committee of the Mayo GAA County Board. In 2016 Mayo won the Nicky Rackard cup beating Armagh 2-16 to 1-15 in Croke Park =Current hurling squad= *Manager: Derek Walsh Squad as per Mayo vs Derry, Christy Ring Cup Round 1, May 2, 2015 =Honours= All Irelands * 1 Nicky Rackard Cup ** 2016 * 3 All-Ireland Junior Hurling Championships ** 1980, 1981, 2003 * 2 All-Ireland Minor 'C' Hurling Championships ** 2013, 2014 Provincials * 1 Connacht Senior Hurling Championship ** 1909 *2 Connacht Intermediate Hurling Championship ** 1969, 2014 *3 Connacht Junior Hurling Championships ** 1936, 1967, 2004 *2 Jim Hogan Couriers Connaught U21 Hurling Championship ** 2015, 2016 * 1 Connacht Minor Hurling Championships ** 1964 Ladies' football Mayo have the following achievements in ladies' football. * 4 All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Championships ** 1999, 2000, 2002, 2003 * Three times All-Ireland Senior Ladies' Football Finalists ** 2001, 2007,2017 * 1 All- Ireland Junior Ladies' Football Championship ** 1987 * 1 All-Ireland Intermediate Ladies' Football Championship ** 1993 * 1 All-Ireland Under-18 Ladies' Football Championship ** 1987 * 2 All-Ireland Under-16 Ladies' Football Championships ** 1976, 2010 * 2 All-Ireland Under-14 Ladies' Football Championships ** 1994, 2010 Camogie Mayo contested the All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship final of 1959, captained by Josie Ruane from Menulla.

Separate county boards are responsible for the promotion & development of handball, camogie and ladies' football within the county, as well as having responsibility for their representative county players/teams. The current team sponsor of Monaghan GAA is Investec. Football =Clubs= Monaghan Senior Football Championship =County team= Football was recorded in Inniskeen in 1706 in a poem. Monaghan were prominent in Ulster championship competitions during the period 1914–30 and one of the first Ulster counties to contest an All-Ireland final. Monaghan beat Kildare in a semi-final to reach the 1930 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, where Kerry beat them by 3–11 to 0-2 without their goalkeeper touching the ball. In 1979 the Monaghan team won the Ulster Senior Football Championship for the first time in 41 years with a defeat of Donegal. In the final Monaghan Kieran Finlay scored 1-09, which was a record in an Ulster final for 20 years, until Armagh's Oisin McConville bettered it with a 2-07 tally against Down in 1999. They also won the Dr McKenna Cup in 1979. Victories in the Ceannarus Tournament against Roscommon and Dublin in 1979 brought gloss to the county's finest year on the football field in almost half a century. In the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship 1979 semi-final at Croke Park, Monaghan were again beaten by Kerry, 5–14 to 0-07. In 1984 the Centenary Cup final was reached following wins over Limerick, Mayo, Offaly (quarter final) and Derry (semi-final after extra time) The Offaly and Derry games were played in Croke Park as was the final against Meath which Monaghan lost by 0–10 to 0-08. Monaghan also won Division 3 of the National Football League that year and lost to Meath in the quarterfinal. 1985 was the county's most successful year to date when a National Football League final victory against Armagh in 1985 created a momentum that peaked in 1985 when future Monaghan manager Eamonn McEneaney kicked one of the most spectacular equalizing points in many years from 48 metres out near the sideline beside the Hogan Stand to draw the All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry on a scoreline of Monaghan 2–09 to Kerry's 1-12. Kerry won the replay on a 2–09 to 0–10 score. That National football league title of 1985 was won by Monaghan on a 1–11 to 0–09 score against pre-match favourites Armagh. The game was effectively settled by an Eamon McEneaney penalty in the first half when referee John Gough from Antrim decided that an Armagh defender had taken too many steps in his own penalty area. Armagh got to within a point in the second half but a flurry of exceptional long range points from Bernie Murray, Eamon McEneaney and Ray McCarron brought the trophy to Monaghan for the first time. That year's Ulster Senior Football Championship was also a stirring success. An easy first round victory over Donegal in Castleblayney, marked by a spectacular Eamon Murphy goal, followed by a lucky draw against Armagh in the semi-final and one-point victory in the replay saw Monaghan meet Derry in the Ulster Senior Football Championship final. The first day against Armagh, Monaghan relied on pure luck to survive for a draw, as Armagh dominated the game from start to finish, doing everything but score. Paddy Linden saved a penalty, while and Armagh player saw the line barely 30 seconds after coming onto the field as a substitute, following an apparent high tackle on Declan Flanagan. The replay was a better match but a late Armagh goal had Monaghan concerned. However they won by 1–11 to 2-07. In the Ulster final against Derry Eamon McEneaney helped himself to 2-04 as Monaghan recorded and easy 2–09 to 0–08 win. As stated the drawn All-Ireland semi-final against Kerry was a thriller but the absence of David Byrne through injury in the second half probably cost Monaghan victory. Eamon McEneaney's last gasp equaliser was something special but in the replay Kerry were ruthless and despite serious Monaghan pressure the Kingdom won by 5 points. Monaghan's run that year was something special considering the fact that they were missing Declan Loughman, Gerry Hoey and Bernie Murray (all with broken legs). All three were prominent in the National Football League win over Armagh while they would form the spine of the Ulster Senior Football Championship winning side of 1988. Monaghan reached the 1986 National Football League final but this time the opposition was Laois. Played in front of over 30,000 supporters the Laoismen edged out Monaghan by 2–06 to 2-05. Monaghan's championship run in 1986 consisted of a draw against Down in Castleblayney thanks to a last gap Eamon McEneaney free while in the replay Down emerged victors in Newcastle on a 2–11 to 0–11 score. A promising season was over before it had begun. In 1987, Monaghan reached the National Football League semi-final again where they played out a thrilling game against Kerry at Croke Park. A superb second half performance against the wind had Monaghan leading by a couple of points near the end but a Pat Spillane goal and a late point by Mikey Sheehy saw the Kingdom win by 2–11 to 2-09. Monaghan's goals came from Mick O'Dowd and Hugo Clerkin. Disappointment followed in the Ulster championship with a shock 0–14 to 0–12 loss to Cavan in Breffni Park. The early promise of 1985 looked over as two successive seasons of flattering to deceive left the county in a state of gloom. In 1988, the team reached the National Football League semi-final again but ended in a 4–12 to 1-08 drubbing from Dublin at Croke Park. However a good league run prior to that had rescued a season where relegation to Division 2 of the National Football League looked a distinct possibility. A change in management during that league run also added to the merit of the achievement. The 1988 All Ireland semi-final against Cork was even less memorable. Monaghan were holding out against a gale-force wind in the first half and were 0–08 to 0-01 behind at the break. Goalkeeper Paddy Linden had saved a penalty from Larry Tompkins. Two early second half points brought Monaghan to within 5 points. A highly controversial goal following an apparent foul on Monaghan's Brendan Murray rocked the Monaghan revival and Cork took over. Linden's display in that match was a significant factor in him being the first Ulster goalkeeper to receive an All-star award that year. As stated the game was decided when Cork scored a dubious goal and the All-Ireland dream died again. With that defeat, the successful team of the mid 80s started to break up. However 1988 will be remembered for the Ulster title win over Tyrone when a \\"Nudie\\" Hughes goal following a fumble by Tyrone keeper Aidan Skelton saw Monaghan win by 1–10 to 0-11. An interesting facet of this particular game was that all Monaghan's scores came from play. Previous wins over Cavan (0-16 to 0-14), again marked by a 5 star performance from Nudie Hughes and Down (1-11 to 0-09) had brought Monaghan to the Ulster final. In 1989 Monaghan scraped home with an 0–08 to 0–05 win against Antrim in Casement Park, Belfast, where the homesters literally kicked the game away. Down ended Monaghan's run in Castleblayney a few weeks later. The 1990s and early part of the 2000s were lean years for the county. The National Football League run of 1998 was also memorable for Monaghan when they surprisingly qualified from a \\"group of death\\" that included Tyrone, Dublin, Kerry, Cavan and Sligo to qualify for the quarter-finals against Down in Croke Park. Behind at one stage early in the second half by 1–05 to 0-02, the Down goal scored by James Mc Cartan, a rousing rally with goals by Darren Swift and Stephen Mc Ginnitty and a spectacular individual point by Peter Duffy saw Monaghan cause a mild surprise with a 2–05 to 1–06 win. The semi final against Derry was less memorable and defeat on a score of 1–12 to 0-08 was the result. The game had a bit of controversy too when a Mark Daly goal was disallowed and a Monaghan player was sent off. It set the tone for a niggly Ulster Senior Football Championship meeting between both sides a few weeks later. Monaghan's Edwin Murphy was sent off on the advice of a linesman but video evidence subsequently cleared him. However it didn't stop Monaghan suffering a heavy defeat on the day to Derry. The Ulster championship final was reached in 2001 for the first time in 18 years when a splendid effort fell short with a 2–13 to 0–13 defeat again to Tyrone. 2005 was another memorable year for the county when they contested the Division 2 National Football League final against Meath at Croke Park. However it took a last gasp point from Paul Finlay in the final league game against Longford in Clones to earn a draw and automatic promotion to Division 1 for the first time in 18 years. The league semi final against Derry in Clones was also a thriller from a Monaghan perspective. A goal within 15 seconds of the throw in by Tommy Freeman set Monaghan on their way and despite Rory Woods being sent off Monaghan held out for a 1–13 to 1–11 win. The NFL Division 2 final was a thrilling ding dong battle between two well match sides and was full of top drawer scores. It had the 40,000+ crowd on their feet from start to finish. Fortunes ebbed and flowed between both sides and in injury time Meath looked like holding onto a 2-point victory. However a Paul Finlay free with the last kick of the game (sounds familiar) from 40 yards out was deflected into the Meath net by a Meath player and Monaghan edged out 3–13 to 3-12 winners. This game preceded the National Football League final which saw Armagh overcome Wexford to gain their first league title. This marked Monaghan's first visit to Croke Park in 7 years, that resulting in a 1–12 to 0–08 defeat in a National Football League semi- final to Derry back in 1998. Derry gained revenge in the Ulster Senior Football Championship with a 1–17 to 2–08 win, but \\"back door\\" wins over London, Wexford and Louth brought Monaghan to a last 12 meeting with eventual All-Ireland champions Tyrone in Croke Park. In a very entertaining game the tactic of isolating Tommy Freeman up front caused havoc for Tyrone in the first 25 minutes as they leaked 1-05, the goal a spectacular effort from Freeman. However a shrewd management move from Tyrone resulted in a player being brought back to double mark Freeman and the Farney threat was quashed. On the day Monaghan had no plan \\"B\\" and Tyrone took over. They ran out flattering 2–14 to 1-07 winners in the end, limiting Monaghan to a single point from a free in the second half. All the pre-match hype surrounded the question as to whether or not Tyrone's Ryan McMenamin would be playing, having been suspended following an incident in the Ulster final. He missed the game but later returned for the quarter-final against Dublin. Freeman's exploits in the summer of 2005 brought him an All-star nomination and an \\"Irish News\\" Ulster All star award on the \\"40\\". 2006 saw Monaghan compete in Division 1A of the National Football League but apart from a win over Dublin and a draw with Offaly, there was little else to celebrate despite battling displays against Kerry and Tyrone and relegation followed in the spring. In the 2013 championship, Monaghan were handed a \\"favorable\\" draw. They were drawn against Antrim in the first round in Casement Park, Belfast. Monaghan had previously brushed aside the Antrim men in the National League. Monaghan started shakily and took a while to get going. They survived some scares but the free taking of Conor McManus powered them over the line 0–11 to 0–6. In the Ulster semi final Monaghan were pitted against local neighbours Cavan. The game was a tight affair with both teams trading scores tit for tat. In the end it finished on a score of 1–11 to 0-13. Coming into the final Monaghan faced the reigning Ulster and All Ireland Champions, Donegal. Nobody had given Monaghan a hope coming into the final but the Farney men took the Tir Chonaill boys by surprise rushing into a 4–0 lead while also keeping Donegal scoreless for 32 minutes. Drew Wylie and Colin Walshe were outstanding marking Colm McFadden and Paddy Mcbrearty respectively. At half time Monaghan led 05–02. Despite the 3 point advantage Donegal were still much fancied but Kieran Hughes stuck over 3 quick points in succession to buffer the Farney Men's advantage. With Vinny Corey's rough housing of Michael Murphy, Donegal failed to get going. Monaghan beat Donegal at their own game using the blanket defence system while Darren Hughes and Conor McManus remained outstanding. It was tight up until the last 10 minutes when Monaghan added some scores to put a gloss on the scoreline. Tommy Freeman one of the greatest servants of Monaghan coming off the bench and firing over the last point. At the end of the game Monaghan had won their first Ulster Senior Football Championship in 25 years. This result was coupled with the Minors superb comeback win earlier in the day defeating Tyrone to complete an historic double. Owen Lennon lifted the Anglo Celt Cup as no Monaghan Captain had done for 25 years. Handball In addition to football, handball (Gaelic handball) has a strong tradition within the county. Monaghan has enjoyed several major national successes in recent years in handball with Gavin Coyle winning three GAA Handball All Ireland 40×20 Singles titles over the past few years. Other notable Monaghan Handball players include Darren Doherty who has achieved several major titles over the last 10+ years. The sport of handball continues to grow within the county, with most GAA clubs providing GAA Handball facilities, namely in the form of 40x20, Wallball/One- wall and/or 60x30 handball courts. New handball courts have been built in recent years with Truagh Gaels GAA Club (new 40x20 court), Scotstown GAA Club (new Wallball court) & Bawn GAA Handball Club (new 40x20 court) all building new courts respectively. Additionally, St Macartan's College have recently refurbished their handball courts, boasting the only combined dual 60x30 and 40x20 handball courts facility in Ireland. Beech Hill College have also added new Wallball courts to their sports facilities. Hurling Football is the dominant GAA sport in Monaghan but the county also competes in hurling.

It is a sequel to Gorky Park and Polar Star and features the Investigator Arkady Renko, taking place during the period of the collapse of the Soviet Union.Wroe, Nicholas, The Guardian (March 26, 2005). Crime Pays Summary As the existing social and economic structures of the Soviet Union break down, Arkady Renko has been reinstated as an Investigator in the Moscow Militsiya (Police Force). He is trying to clear up a nest of illicit traders when his chief informant dies in a horrific fireball. At the late informer's flat, his fax machine keeps asking the apparently meaningless question, \\"Where is Red Square?\\" The question does not pertain to a location but to an avant-garde painting by suprematist painter Malevich which has resurfaced on the black market after being lost since World War II. The story, however, reverts to the August Coup, which takes place in and around Red Square and indeed throughout Moscow in August 1991, leading to the fragmentation of the former Soviet Union. One of the subplots within this novel involves Arkady Renko's improbable reunion with the one great love of his life, Irina Asanova. Her seemingly total lack of interest in Arkady sends him resignedly on his way until, in an ultimate ironic twist, a belatedly-delivered message from Renko's recently deceased father galvanizes him into one last, determined attempt at winning Irina back.  Plot  Now back in Moscow, Arkady Renko struggles to keep the peace in a town overrun by organized crime and the economic recession caused by the death-throes of the Soviet Union. The lawlessness of the new Moscow is brought home to him when one of this informants, a Russian Jewish black marketer named Rudy Rosen, is killed by a fire bomb. Suspicion for the act is divided among each of the leading gangs, such as one led by a new Soviet \\"entrepreneur\\" or the ever troublesome Chechens. Whilst looking over Rosen's apartment, Arkady is confused by an incoming fax asking \\"where is Red Square?\\", as well as several connections to Germany, specifically Munich. He also is amazed to hear the voice of Irina Asanova, his long lost love from Gorky Park, announcing for the recently unblocked American propaganda station Radio Liberty, operating out of Munich. Uncovering more and more connections to Germany, and once again facing suppression at home - including the killing of his partner - Arkady manages to coerce the prosecutor to allow him to go to the recently reunified Germany, in an unofficial capacity. He looks up leads in the Rosen case, as well as trying to re-connect with Irina, but finds she wants nothing to do with him. He soon enters a strained but beneficial relationship with a German police officer called Peter Schmidt, who describes his father's escapades as one of Heinrich Himmler's art collectors, particularly of revolutionary avant garde Russian art, presently persecuted by the Soviet regime. Arkady finds himself a rival in Max Albov, Irina's colleague at Radio Liberty, whom he had previously encountered in Moscow and starts to suspect of involvement with Rosen. Irina repents of her dislike for Arkady, after learning that he had not been living as the spoiled apparatchik he had been portrayed, and awkwardly all three of them head for Berlin. At an art exhibition, the avant garde piece by Malevich called \\"Red Square\\" is proudly shown to audiences. Increasingly finding his present company intertwined with the case, Arkady realizes that he has stumbled across a vast, and deadly, art smuggling operation. In an effort to silence him, Arkady is framed in the death of the Chechen leader Mahmoud and has to dodge the inevitable reprisal. Arranging to get the painting, Arkady and Irina head back to Moscow - well aware of the staged coup of Communist Party hard-liners. He arranges a swap, knowing full well that it is a trap. During a fire-fight in rural Moscow where the stash of paintings are kept, both he and Max escape, and settle into the confusion of the coup and protests. Arkady finds himself cornered, but is saved by Chechen gang members who have learned the real cause of their leader's death. Together with Irina again, they stand with the other protesters and press as tanks march towards Russia's new impromptu parliament, the White House.

Born in Baildon, Yorkshire, and nicknamed \\"Ticker\\" because of a habit of chatting to himself while batting, Mitchell was a solid, determined and sometimes dour middle order batsman who converted to become an opening batsman after the retirement of Percy Holmes in 1932. An accumulator of runs rather than a stroke maker, he very occasionally allowed himself to bat more freely, and when he did he revealed himself as a particularly fine cutter. He scored centuries in four consecutive innings for Yorkshire in 1933. He was a particularly fine close-in fieldsman, noted for taking catches off the bowling of Hedley Verity. The Yorkshire cricket journalist John Bapty said of Mitchell's fielding: \\"His skill became such, and his fame mounted so that there were times when it was said he had missed a catch that never would have been accounted a chance had he not made it one.\\"John Bapty, \\"Arthur Mitchell\\", Cricket Heroes, Cricket Writers Club, London, 1959, 164–72. Mitchell's Test cricket career might have consisted of just three matches on the 1933-34 tour of India, when he performed without distinction in what was, in effect, an England second eleven. But an injury to Maurice Leyland just before the Headingley Test against South Africa in 1935 led to Mitchell being summoned, literally, from his back garden. With scores of 58 and 72, he retained his place for the final Test, and played once more, against India in 1936. His first-class career lasted from 1922 to 1945. Mitchell was appointed county coach to Yorkshire after World War II, and remained in the job until 1970.Bill Bowes, \\"Arthur Mitchell\\", The Cricketer, February 1977, p. 21.

His work started around 1839, and his sons, Jean-Baptiste (1845–99), Jacques (1849–1918), and E.J. Albert, continued making clarinets until the end of the World War I. The model of clarinet he made is still widely known, especially in the U.S., as the \\"Albert system\\", although this model is basically the same as Iwan Müller's 13-key instrument, with the addition of some improvements inspired in his tutor, Adolphe Sax. Sax was the first to use ring keys on the clarinet. In 1840 he made an improvement in Iwan Müller's 13-key clarinet, adding two rings, or brille (glasses), to the lower joint. This resulted in the 13 keys / 2 rings clarinet. In the same year, Albert, based on Müller modifications and Adolphe Sax's rings created a new keywork system, adding more two rings to the upper joint, resulting in a 13 keys / 4 rings clarinet. His instruments are reported have had \\"better tone and intonation than Boehm models of the time\\". Albert's instruments were very well made, and finely tuned. His clarinets were very popular in England, where the leading clarinettist of the time, Henry Lazarus, owned eight of Albert's instruments. When Boosey & Co. (now Boosey & Hawkes) decided to begin making clarinets, Albert was brought to London as a consultant. Eugène Albert's instruments were almost all made for high pitch, A'=c452, meaning that after World War I few professional clarinettists played them. His son, E. J. Albert, made clarinets in far more models, and in A'=440, meaning that his reputation lasted far after his death, and his instruments were played up until the end of the 20th century. Probably it was E. J. Albert, and not Eugène, who about 1890 built an early contra-alto clarinet in F.

Summerfield: The Classical Guitar. Its Evolution, Players and Personalities Since 1800, 5th edition (Blaydon-on-Tyne: Ashley Mark Publishing Co., 2002), p. 199. (born May 9, 1931) is a classical guitarist and composer from Argentina. He is now living and working in New York City. Biography Morel was born in Buenos Aires. His father taught him the rudiments of classical guitar from age seven. He went on to study advanced guitar at the internationally renowned academy of Pablo Escobar in Buenos Aires, and after graduating, joined Escobar in radio and concert performances. Morel left Argentina to perform in Ecuador, Colombia and Cuba, where he recorded his first solo LP and was featured in a weekly TV show. Vladimir Bobri, then President of the Classical Guitar Society in New York, lent his recognition and support to Morel after hearing him perform in Puerto Rico. This led to concert engagements in California and Hawaii and Morel's eventual debut at Carnegie Hall in 1961. At this time, he recorded his second LP for Decca Records and subsequently recorded three more albums. Morel appeared at Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in New York, Queen Elizabeth Hall and Wigmore Hall in London, National Concert Hall in Dublin, and Suntory Hall in Tokyo. Over the years he performed in many countries including Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Cuba, Ecuador, Puerto Rico, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Scotland, Spain, Sweden, Finland, Greece, Singapore, Germany and more. After moving to New York City, Morel performed nightly at the jazz venue The Village Gate, owned by Art D'Lugoff, who became his manager for a period of three years. During his performances at the Village Gate, he shared the bill with jazz legends such as Erroll Garner, Stan Kenton, Herbie Mann and others. Around this time, Morel met Chet Atkins and established what was to become a lifelong friendship. Chet demonstrated his admiration for Morel in a very tangible way when he helped to arrange for the recording of another album with RCA Victor. Morel was represented by Columbia Artists Management for a total of seven years throughout the 1970s and toured all of North America and Canada performing approximately 70 concerts a year. Morel continued to solidify his reputation as a performing artist and composer with the premier of Suite del Sur (a concerto for guitar and orchestra), which he performed as soloist with the Los Angeles Philharmonic under the direction of Zubin Mehta. He continued his study of composition for a number of years with teacher, author, conductor and arranger Rudy Schramm. Legacy Through his original compositions and arrangements, Jorge Morel has substantially added to the repertoire for classical guitar while consistently challenging traditional, technical, and stylistic limitations. His mastery of the technical combined with intimate knowledge of the physical and acoustical characteristics of the instrument have resulted in an innovative approach to the complex task of composing for the classical guitar. His ability to blend his love for Latin American rhythmic textures and sophisticated jazz harmonies permeates his work with a musical imagination, attested to by the many artists worldwide who have recorded his works. Names such as John Williams, Chet Atkins, the Assad Brothers, duo Evangelos & Liza, Pepe and Angel Romero, Christopher Parkening, David Russell, David Starobin, Carlos Barbosa-Lima, Ricardo Iznaola, Eliot Fisk, Vladislav Blaha, Krzysztof Pelech, Hilary Field, and the Hanser McClellan duo, have performed and recorded many of Morel's compositions and arrangements, including guitar concertos, guitar and string quartets, solos, duets, and guitar quartets as well as fine performance of his Suite del Sur with the Prague Quartet. In addition to the many artists who have recorded his compositions, Morel also created a library of solo recordings on both major and independent labels such as RCA, Decca, Guitar Masters, Sesac and Luthier Music. Morel is also recognized for his teaching and commitment to new musicians.

(also called de Panasz in some sources; , ; ; ; ; 4 October 1570 – 19 March 1637), was a Hungarian Jesuit who was a noted philosopher, theologian, cardinal, pulpit orator and statesman. He was an important figure in the Counter-Reformation in Royal Hungary. Pázmány's most important legacy was his creation of the Hungarian literary language. As an orator he was dubbed \\"the Hungarian Cicero in the purple\\". In 1867, a street in Vienna, the Pazmanitengasse, was named after him.  Biography  = Early life = Pázmány was born in 1570 in Nagyvárad, in the Principality of Transylvania (today Oradea, Romania), the son of Miklós Pázmány, vice-ispán of Bihar County. As a young man he was educated there and, under the Jesuits, in Kolozsvár (Cluj), which is where he converted from the Calvinist Reformed Church of Hungary to Roman Catholicism in 1583, partly under the influence of his stepmother, a Catholic. In 1587 he entered the Society of Jesus. Upon entering the Jesuit Order, Pázmány went through his novitiate at Kraków, after which he studied philosophy in University of Vienna (1589-1592), and then theology at the Collegio Romano in Rome (now the Pontifical Gregorian University) under St. Robert Bellarmine, S.J. (1592-1596), after which he was ordained to the priesthood there. He was made a Doctor of Theology in 1597. After his studies, Pázmány was sent to Graz, Austria, first serving on the staff of the Jesuit college there for a year, then lecturing in theology at the University of Graz. In 1601 he was sent to the Society's establishment at Sellye (today Šaľa, Slovakia), where his eloquence and dialectic won hundreds to Catholicism, including many of the noblest families. Count Miklós Esterházy and Pál Rákóczi were among his converts. In 1607 Pázmány entered the court of Archbishop Ferenc Forgách of Esztergom. The following year he attracted attention in the Diet of Hungary by his denunciation of the 8th point of the Peace of Vienna, which prohibited the Jesuits from acquiring landed property in Hungary. Particularly remarkable from this period is Pázmány's Guide to Truth, which appeared in 1613. This manual was judged to have united all the advantages of scientific depth, methodical arrangement and popular style. At the initiative of the archbishop and the request of King Matthias II of Hungary, Pope Paul V, by an apostolic brief dated 5 March 1616, granted Pázmány permission to leave the Society of Jesus and to enter the Somascan Clerics Regular; he never left the Jesuit Order, however, so there was only the submission of a request by third parties and the granting of a permission to leave. = Primate of Hungary = On 25 April 1616 Pázmány was appointed the Provost of Turóc (Slovak Turiec), and on 28 September he was appointed by the Holy See as Archbishop of Esztergom, the Primate of Hungary. Pázmány was to become the soul of the Catholic Counter-Reformation in Hungary. As the chief pastor of the Catholic Church in Hungary, Pázmány used every means in his power, short of absolute contravention of the laws, to obstruct and weaken Protestantism, which had risen during the 16th century. In 1619 he founded a seminary for theological candidates at Nagyszombat (today Trnava, Slovakia), and in 1623 laid the foundations of a similar institution at Vienna, the still famous Pázmáneum, at a cost of 200,000 florins. In 1635 he contributed 100,000 florins towards the foundation of the University in Nagyszombat (today's Trnava). The Faculty of Theology was later turned into Pázmány Péter Catholic University, and the rest of the university became what is now known as Eötvös Loránd University, which from 1921-1950 was known as Péter Pázmány University. Its theological faculty became Catholic Péter Pázmány University, Budapest/Piliscsaba, in 1992. Pázmány also built Jesuit colleges and schools at Pozsony (Bratislava), and Franciscan monasteries at Érsekújvár (now: Nové Zámky) and Körmöcbánya (now: Kremnica) (all in modernday Slovakia). Pázmány played a considerable part in the politics of his day. It was chiefly due to him that the Diet of 1618 elected Archduke Ferdinand to succeed the childless Matthias. He also repeatedly thwarted the martial ambitions of Gabriel Bethlen, and prevented George I Rákóczi, over whom he had a great influence, from allying with the Ottoman Empire and the Protestants. Pázmány was created a Cardinal Priest by Pope Urban VIII in the consistory of 19 November 1629. He received the red hat of a cardinal from the pope on 31 May 1629 at which time he was assigned for his titular church to Saint Jerome of the Croats. = Death = Pázmány died in Pozsony (today Bratislava) in 1637 and was buried underneath the floor of St. Martin's Cathedral, at the foot of the ancient tomb of St. John the Almsgiver, which he had embellished during his reign. Pázmány's grave was discovered during reconstruction on 12 September 1859 by the Rev. Ferdinand Knauz and others. They found the body dry yet almost intact. His face was missing the nose and lips but was still bearded, and he still had his biretta on his head with some hair underneath. He was wearing red damask vestments and had simple leather shoes on his feet.

In the 13th century when the Teutonic Knights began their crusade against the Prussians, some 15,000 people might have lived in the area between the rivers identified by the Knights as Pregel (now Pregolya) and Alle (now Łyna). The Natangian lands bordered with Sambia in the north and with Warmia in the south. They likely spoke a West Baltic language, now extinct, similar to Old Prussian language. History Natangians are first mentioned in a 1238 treaty between the Knights and Zwantepolc De Danceke (Świętopełk II of Pomerania). The Treaty of Christburg of early 1249, which assured personal freedom to newly converted Christians, included Natangians. However, the treaty failed to address the underlying causes of the conflict, and Natangians massacred 54 knights in the Battle of Krücken in November 1249. But the victory was short-lived, the Knights regained their strength in just two years and continued their crusade. In 1255 they built Königsberg (now Kaliningrad) at the mouth of Pregel river, right on the border between Natangia and Sambia. During the Great Prussian Uprising (1260-1274), the Natangians elected Herkus Monte, who was educated in Germany, as their chief. At first he was successful and defeated the Knights in the Battle of Pokarwis and Battle of Löbau. However, the rebels were unable to capture the brick castles built by the Knights and were defeated. Herkus, who had been one of the most prominent leaders of the Prussians, was captured and hanged in 1273. The Natangian nobles submitted to the Germans, who promised privileges and undisturbed ownership of their estates. Natangians, led by Sabynas and Stanta, rebelled for the last time in 1295. When German colonists settled in the area, the Natangians kept their local language and customs up until the 17th century. Later on, their identity disappeared by the end of the 17th century or the beginning of the 18th century as they merged with the German population, but the local populace still defined themselves as \\"Natangians\\" up to 1945 and even the local newspaper of Landsberg (Górowo Iławeckie) was called \\"Natanger Zeitung\\" after 1919.

Biography The son of George, Count of Henneberg and Johanna, daughter of Count Philipp I of Nassau- Weilburg entered the ecclesiastical profession and, after passing through its lower stages, from 1472 on was a member of the Mainz cathedral chapter, dean from 1475. On May 20, 1484 he was elected archbishop, confirmed by Pope Innocent VIII on September 20, 1484. He was made imperial chancellor in 1486 in return for supporting the election of Maximilian I. As a follower of Nicholas of Cusa and the ideas of Renaissance humanism, he appears to have been a firm supporter of law and order, an enemy of clerical abuses and a careful administrator of his diocese. Immediately after his election as archbishop he began to take a leading part in the business of the Empire, and in 1486 was very active in securing the election of Maximilian of Habsburg as King of the Romans. =Imperial Reform= Henneberg is most remembered as an advocate of administrative reform in the Empire, including the implementation of the Ewiger Landfriede (eternal public peace) to put an end to internal feuds, secured by the jurisdiction of an Imperial Chamber Court. As a member of the electoral college and archchancellor he had brought this question before the Reichstag diet during the reign of Emperor Frederick III. At first his proposals came to nothing, but he continued the struggle at a series of diets and after Frederick's death, he was the leader of the party which pressed the necessity for reform upon Frederick's son Maximilian at the Diet of Worms in 1495, where the Ewiger Landfriede was declared. He also urged the Imperial States to emulate the courage and union of the Swiss Confederacy and gained a temporary victory when the 1500 Reichstag at Augsburg established a council of regency (Reichsregiment) under his guidance, making the Emperor \\"no more than an honorary figurehead\\" while the real power in the Empire was with Henneberg and the other prince-electors. Though he persuaded the electors to form a union to uphold the reforms of 1495 and 1500, the Reichsregiment was abolished by Maximilian in 1502, defeating Henneberg's Electoral League, which had not managed to gain the trust of the Empire's other princes. The following year, he returned the imperial seal, signifying his defeat. Henneberg died on December 21, 1504. He is buried at Mainz Cathedral. Notes References *J.

They lived in Bartia (also Bartenland or Barthonia), a territory that stretched from the middle and lower flow of Łyna river, by the Liwna river, and Lake Mamry, up to the Galindian woods. The territory is quite precisely known from description in Chronicon terrae Prussiae, dated 1326. The same description mentions two provinces, the Major Barta and the Minor Barta. The territory was quite densely populated, as confirmed by abundant archeological findings. Before the wars with the Teutonic Knights, the population was estimated to be at 17,000. The Bartians, along with the other Prussians, were conquered by the Teutonic Knights, who Christianized them under duress, brought in settlers. The Prussians were forcibly assimilated by the invaders and the Old Prussian language became extinct by the end of the 17th century. History Several years of conquest attempts by Poland, aided by a number of crusades by the popes and by Konrad of Masovia, had been fairly successfully repelled by the Prussians. Then Konrad of Masovia called for further crusades and invited the Teutonic Knights, an Order of the Catholic Church, to settle in Kulmerland in 1226. Receiving support from the rest of Christian Europe, the military order was able to expand their territory northwest. Their strategy was to conquer a territory and built a castle -- a stronghold that would serve as the basis for further expansion. Castles at that time in Europe were built to serve as bases for colonial expansion. The Bartians, together with the Warmians and the Natangians, were conquered by the Teutonic Knights 1238-1240. In Barta the Knights built major castles in Bartenstein and Rößel. In 1242, just two years after their conquest, Bartians rebelled and managed to resist until 1252. During the Great Prussian Uprising (1260-1274), that started after the Knights suffered a major loss in the Battle of Durbe, Bartians chose Diwane as their leader. The rebels managed to capture a few castles, including Bartenstein in 1264. With help from other Prussian tribes, Diwane attacked Kulm, Marienburg, and Christburg. However, the Prussians could not win a war of attrition against the Knights, who could draw resources from the western Europe. In 1273 Diwane sieged another castle but was fatally wounded. Within a year, the uprising was over. Some of the rebels escaped to Hrodna (Black Ruthenia) and other Lithuanian territories,. Despite heavy losses during the uprising, Barta did not become an uninhabited land and the Bartians continued to resist. Two more attempts were made, in 1286 and 1293, to fight against the Teutonic Knights. In 1286 Bartians asked help from Duke of Rügen, and in 1293 from Vytenis, Grand Duke of Lithuania. The Bartians were forcibly assimilated by the Germans in the 16th or 17th century. They are most likely the Bartove mentioned in the Hypatian Codex (together with the Prussians: \\"Prousi i Bartove\\").

The firm was prolific and produced consistently fine work though the patronage of notable figures of the Canadian establishment, and is responsible for enhancing the architectural character and quality of the city, and indeed the rest of Canada, in the first quarter of the 20th century. Formation The firm was organized first as Darling, Curry, Sproatt, & Pearson in 1892, with partners Frank Darling, S. George Curry, Henry Sproatt, and John A. Pearson. From 1893 through 1896 it evolved into Darling, Sproatt & Pearson, then finally Darling and Pearson was founded as such in 1897. Its heyday began with Darling's commissions from the Canadian Bank of Commerce in 1898, grand Edwardian buildings in Toronto, Winnipeg, Montreal, and Vancouver, and dozens of smaller branches in smaller Canadian cities and towns. Darling's training with the English architect George Edmund Street and Sir Arthur Blomfield in the early 1870s brought a serious, substantial, Victorian influence, well-suited to large civic and institutional projects in the years of the nation's development. Their subsequent projects included the first tall steel-frame building in Canada (the Royal Tower in Winnipeg, 1904), the tallest building in Canada for three decades (the 1930 Canadian Bank of Commerce Building in Toronto, with York and Sawyer of New York), and the largest single building in the British Commonwealth (the Sun Life Building, Montreal, Started in 1914 and tower added by1931). Legacy After the deaths of Frank Darling in 1923 and Pearson in 1940, the firm was renamed Darling, Pearson and Cleveland with Darling's nephew as a partner.

However, Θ is often studied in contexts where the axiom of choice fails, such as models of the axiom of determinacy. Θ is also the supremum of the lengths of all prewellorderings of the reals.

However, suppose there were no such ordinal. Then to every ordinal α we could associate the set of all prewellorderings of the reals having length α. This would give an injection from the class of all ordinals into the set of all sets of orderings on the reals (which can to be seen to be a set via repeated application of the powerset axiom).

The boundaries are approximate. The Scalovians (; ), also known as the Skalvians, Schalwen and Schalmen, were a Baltic tribe related to the Prussians. According to the Chronicon terrae Prussiae of Peter of Dusburg, the now extinct Scalovians inhabited the land of Scalovia south of the Curonians and Samogitians, by the lower Neman River ca. 1240. Geography This region is located at both sides of the river Memel north of Nadruvians and south of Samogitia. In the North-East it stretched to rivers Šešupė, Ežeruona and Jūra. In the East it bordered on Sudovia, in the North-West on river Minija, in the West on the Curonian Lagoon and in the South-West on river Gilija. The center were the towns of Rusnė, Ragainė and Tilžė. Name The meaning is uncertain: skalwa \\"splinter (living split off)\\" or skalauti \\"between waters\\". According to Prussian legends, the tribe's name is derived from one of the sons of King Widewuto named Schalauo. History The inhabitants can be traced back to burial grounds with cremated remains and occasional graves of horses. Judging from the diggings, Scalovians are assumed to have been related to other Western Balts such as Curonians and more distantly to Prussians. Typical Scalovian sepulchral relics are found in Strewa, Skomanten, Jurgaiten, Nikeln, Paulaiten, Wilku Kampas, Weszaiten, Greyszönen, Lompönen and Wittgirren. The center of Scalovia was the castle of Ragnit. Peter von Dusburg told about a wooden castle which could not be conquered by force or starvation because the inhabitants of the stronghold had put in an artificial lake, stocked with fish. The conquerors had to burn down the castle. In 1276–1277, Scalovia was subjugated by the Teutonic Knights. In the chronicles of the Knights were mentioned the nobles Sarecka (Sareikā), Surbantas, Svirdotas and Surdota. In 1281, Jondele Schalwithe got the first \\"Landesprivileg,\\" and in 1289 the castle of order Ragnit was built. Between 1281 and 1383, privileges were made out: 1338 in Pleikischken near Plaschken, 1312 and 1333 near Sasavo in the region between Laugßargen and Tauragė, 1307 in Sintine near Tilsit, 1307 Gigen (near present-day Pagėgiai), 1309 Linkone, 1350 Linkonen (Linkuhnen) as well as Weinoten near Tilsit, Tusseinen near Ragnit and Linkuhnen. Lithuanian immigrants were Sipe (1339) and the brothers Pogins and Skirgaila (1359). In 1411, a campaign of the Samogitians under their leader Rumbaudas Valimantaitis against the castles of Ragnit, Tilsit and Splitter is testified. The last mention of the Scalovians was between 1542 (inhabitants of the castle of Ragnit) and 1563 (inhabitants of Splitter). Language Skalvian, or Scalovian, is the presumed West Baltic language or dialect of the Skalvians.

It comprised the reigns of three emperors and is known for repelling the Song invasion of its nation. Founding After the assassination of the emperor, Đinh Tiên Hoàng, and the emperor's first son, Đinh Liễn, the third son of the emperor, Đinh Phế Đế, assumed the throne at aged six with the regent Lê Hoàn. During the regency of Lê Hoàn, members of the royal court skeptical of Lê Hoàn's loyalty to the true emperor, such as the Duke of Định Nguyễn Bặc and General Đinh Điền, led an army to the imperial palace in an attempted coup. The failure of the undertaking caused those two figures to be executed. In 980, the Song dynasty of China under Emperor Taizong ordered a Chinese army to invade Đại Cồ Việt. Because the young emperor was unable to lead the country to against the invader, the mandarins of the royal court discussed with Empress Dương Vân Nga about enthroning the most trusted general and regent, Lê Hoàn. Most of them voted in the affirmative to this proposal; consequently, the empress dethroned her own son and gave the crown to Lê Hoàn. He accepted the emperorship, establishing a new dynasty named the Early Lê dynasty. Lê Hoàn is often referred to with the posthumous name Lê Đại Hành. Lê Đại Hành (980–1005) Following war threats from Song China, Lê Đại Hành made preparations for war while the Song forces advanced toward Đại Cồ Việt. Later at the Battle of Bạch Đằng River, Lê Đại Hành's forces, under the command of General Phạm Cự Lượng, were successful at halting the overland advance of the Song forces, although they incurred some losses. Seeking peace, Lê Đại Hành sent emissaries to negotiate for peace; thus the annual show of homage and offerings to the Celestial Emperor of China were resumed as a means to appease the Song dynasty. In 982, Lê Đại Hành began expeditions to Champa, a nation south of Đại Cồ Việt. Lê Đại Hành's army met the combined forces of Champa, Chenla and Abbasid Mercenaries in Đồ Bàn, (Quảng Nam province today) and be able to defeated all of them. Champa king Paramesvaravarman I had been beheaded and Champa capital of Indrapura was sacked by the Vietnamese. The new king of Champa agreed to be a vassal state of Đại Cồ Việt in 983.Ngô Sĩ Liên: Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư 1. Page 216 Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Chap 1. Page. 222 Some domestic achievements of Lê Đại Hành include constructing new monuments and galvanizing agricultural and handicraft production in order to make economic progress. Many spiritual etiquettes were developed, and Lê Đại Hành's government was the model for that of the succeeding dynasty. Lê Đại Hành died in 1005 at the age of 65 and after 25 years of rule. In his will, Lê Đại Hành gave the throne to his youngest son, Lê Long Việt. The succession crisis =Lê Long Việt (1005)= Out of his many princes, Lê Hoàn appointed his first prince Lê Long Thâu as the crown prince in the early years of his rule. Thâu died in 1000, and Lê Hoàn was forced to choose another crown prince. The fifth prince Duke of Khai Minh, Lê Long Đĩnh, nominated himself as crown prince. According to the Đại Việt sử ký toàn thư, Lê Hoàn viewed him as the favourable to become the next emperor, but royal court mandarins suggested him not to do it because they viewed other candidates as more viable. Lê Hoàn followed the advice and chose his older brother Lê Long Việ, the duke of Nam Phong. In 1005, Lê Hoàn died after reigning for 24 years at Trường Xuân Palace. After the death, there was a succession dispute between the princes Lê Long Đĩnh, Lê Long Tích, and Lê Long Kính and crown prince Lê Long Việt, preventing a government to take control over the entire country for eight months. In the winter of 1005, Lê Long Tích was defeated by crown prince Lê Long Việt. He fled to Thạch Hà province, now Hà Tĩnh Province, and ordered the massacre of the locals there. After a few months, Lê Long Việt was able to proclaim himself emperor Lê Trung Tông but was assassinated after ruling for three days by Lê Long Đĩnh, who replaced him as emperor. =Lê Long Đĩnh (1005–1009)= Lê Long Đĩnh mustered large military forces, defeating the other princes. After stabilizing his rule through war, he enhanced foreign relations with the Song dynasty with a gentle and friendly policy. The emperor gave full support for Buddhism and sought Chinese Buddhist canon and scripture for practice in Vietnam. He also supervised the national economy and began the construction of bridges, roads, and other infrastructure for easy transportation of people and commodities, especially water. In 1009, he established the exchange of goods and products in Nanning with the Song dynasty, albeit it was limited as the Song emperor only allowed Vietnamese businessmen to trade at specific locations near the border like Hepu County, Guangxi. Hemorrhoids The emperor was famous for suffering from hemorrhoids, which made him unable to sit on the throne and instead forced him to lie on his throne. His famous lying sessions earned him the name Lê Ngọa Triều throughout his reign, meaning \\"the one who rules while lying on the throne.\\"АНТОЛОГИЯ ТРАДИЦИОННОЙ ВЬЕТНАМСКОЙ МЫСЛИ. X начало XIII вв. The rise of the Lý clan Despite his supposed achievements in diplomacy, religion, infrastructure, and the economy, Lê Long Đĩnh's rule was characterized by debaucheries, wild orgies, and decadence according to ancient sources, although modern historians have dismissed these stories as legend, while other historians compare him to the Roman Emperor Nero as he was well known for his cruelties, not the least of which was sadism and torture of not only many types of criminals but also his own relatives, with him only promoting and partaking in these infamous acts. According to these stories, his favorite execution and torturing methods were immersion, Lingchi, and the burning of live victims, all of which he perceived as entertainment. Although Buddhism played a key role in his life and politics, the emperor often used Buddhist monks for so-called entertainment such as by exfoliating sugar canes atop a monk's head until it began to bleed. Employing many corrupt or otherwise incompetent officials into important court positions only further encouraged these tendencies of the emperor. As a result of the emperor's poor health, according to some sources, most power was actually controlled by one of the members of the Lý family Lý Công Uẩn. High resentment from the public and the imperial court culminated for a long period preceding Lê Long Đĩnh's death. After Lê Long Đĩnh died the court agreed to enthrone the high-rank mandarin and aristocrat Lý Công Uẩn as the new emperor under pressure from the public and from the Buddhist monks, thus ending the Early Lê Dynasty. In its place, the Lý dynasty ushered in a new age for Vietnam, with a combination of Confucian and Buddhist influences recurring in the new dynasty. Domestic =Administrative centre= The Early Lê Dynasty dynasty modified the traditional government form of the Đinh dynasty, although it modified some parts of it. In 980, Lê Hoàn appointed several men to court positions: Hồng Hiến as the grand chancellor, known in Vietnamese as Thái sư; Phạm Cự Lạng as the vice-chancellor, or Thái úy; Từ Mục as grand governor of court, Đại tổng quản; and Đinh Thừa Chinh as royal capital interior military commander, in Vietnamese Nha nội đô chỉ huy sứ. A major reform, however, was the distribution of specific duties and powers to each mandarin in contrast to the Đinh dynasty's centralizing all power to the emperor. Temple of Đình Yên Thành, Hoa Lư, Ninh Bình. =Rebellion oppression= In the ruling era, Lê emperors often faced the revolts of some local Tribal chief and viceroy, especially in remote areas, retaining the specific authorization to quell them. In 980, Lê Đại Hành ordered Dương Tiến Lộc to collect taxes from Hoan and Ái province, now Nghệ An Province and Thanh Hóa Province. However, Dương Tiến Lộc opposed it and seized the two provinces, proposing to place them under the control of the Kingdom of Champa, which refused him in order to maintain a friendly relationship with Đại Cồ Việt. Lê Đại Hành led an army to defeat and kill Lộc along with a general massacre of citizens in those two provinces. This, however, is only an example of rebellion: there were more than ten rebellions against the royal court during a reign of five years. =Transportation= After victory over Champa in 983, Lê Đại Hành merged the seized territory into the country and started to build more roads from the south estuary to Quảng Bình Province at the south of his realm. Then he ordered the dredging of the Đa Cái canal in 1003. In 1009, the country started the massive construction of transportation infrastructure for trading among the regions and to facilitate travel for soldiers heading south. =Economy= Taxation The Early Lê dynasty imposed taxation based on land property. Taxes included a public benefit tax, which was ten days' worth of labor for public projects; a household tax on property paid annually; and a military tax added to the household tax specifically for military operations, including public security at home. The taxation on property was borrowed from the Xia, Shang, and Zhou dynasties of China, only collecting goods and not money. Simultaneously, the government implementing trade-promoting policies by not taxing the property of traders except for land owned. Agriculture Agriculture was the fundamental element of the economy of Đại Cồ Việt during the Early Lê dynasty. Most of the land of villages was under the control of the royal court and owned by it by law. Land was given one of four types. The emperor's land was cultivated with a spiritual significance, intended to have the people to take part in agricultural activities, mainly prisoners and peasants, with all products going to the royal court; it was first implemented by Lê Đại Hành in 987. Meanwhile, distributive land was distributed to mandarins for the benefiting and contributing to the country or to princes as an accommodation. It was not private property and was returned to the royal court when the landowner died. Religious land was set aside for the practices of Buddhist monks; private land was owned and sold freely between individuals without government interference. Besides that, the government encouraged subjects to exploit wild and untouched land by settling it, providing property at a lower cost while simultaneously expanding its influence in unsettled regions. Peasants shared the land equally and cultivate it, regularly paying taxes to the government for the government's budget. Temple of Hoa Xá – Minh Ngự Lâu Trade The emperors were focused on an open new trade route through roads and waterways. Records report that such infrastructure projects were undertaken mainly in the years 983, 1003, and 1009. The main trade partner of Đại Cồ Việt was China, and both sides agreed to establish bilateral exchanging of goods at borders. Some local high officials supported commercial activity among local parties. A delegation of Đại Cồ Việt acted as a government arbitrator in trade disputes. Some typical exports of Vietnam were gold, silver, and bronze products.Trương Hữu Quýnh, Đinh Xuân Lâm, Lê Mậu Hãn, sách đã dẫn, tr 112 Culture There are not much sources describing the culture under Early Lê dynasty. However, it is known that Buddhism was the most widespread religion, affecting the flourishing of Buddhism in China's Tang dynasty. Monks were given an elevated status in government affairs, being allowed to participate in politics and national planning. Foreign relations =Song dynasty= Đại Cồ Việt was a tributary state of the Song during the Early Lê dynasty, maintaining a delicate balance of peace with China and independence. Lê emperors, however, were sometimes threatened by the nomadic Khitan people in the north of China. After a failed invasion in 981, the Song emperor accepted Lê Hoàn as the ruler of Đại Cồ Việt but just regarded him as the Jiedushi, or regional military governor, of the Annam protectorate, as the Chinese called the Đại Cồ Việt. Between 982 and 994, Lê Hoàn sent five tribute-bearing diplomatic envoys to the Song dynasty requesting title investiture. In 986, Emperor Taizong of the Song dynasty appointed Lê Hoàn as Annan duhu, or Superior Prefect of Annam. At the end of 993, the Song emperor appointed Lé Hoàn as Giao Chi Quan Vuong, or King of Giao Chi, after being convinced of his future loyalty. =Champa= The relation of Đại Cồ Việt in the north and Champa in the south was regarded as hostile. In 981, Lê Đại Hành sent an envoy to Champa, who was captured by them. The diplomatic incident sparked a war between the two countries. In 982, Lê Hoàn victoriously took part in the campaign against Champa, killing the Cham king at the battlefield. Then he sacked the capital of Cham and captured a hundred soldiers and concubines along with one Indian monk, taking home precious goods such as gold and silver. Moreover, he burned the fortresses and tombs of former Champa kings. In 992, the Champa king Harivarman II sent an envoy to Đại Cồ Việt to ask for the release of 360 prisoners back to the homeland.

The United Kingdom held varying parts of these territories or the whole throughout the 19th century. From west to east, the colonies became the independent countries of The Gambia, Sierra Leone, Ghana and Nigeria. Until independence, Ghana was referred to as the Gold Coast. Historical jurisdiction Bathurst, The Gambia, published in 1824 Otoo Ababio II., Omanhene of Abura, being presented to Prince of Wales, Accra, Gold Coast, 1925 British West Africa as a colonial entity was originally known as Colony of Sierra Leone and its Dependencies, then British West African Territories and finally British West African Settlements. It constituted during two periods (17 October 1821, until its first dissolution on 13 January 1850, and again 19 February 1866, until its final demise on 28 November 1888) as an administrative entity under a governor-in-chief (comparable in rank to a governor-general), an office vested in the governor of Sierra Leone (at Freetown). The other colonies originally included in the jurisdiction were the Gambia and the British Gold Coast (modern Ghana). Also western Nigeria, eastern Nigeria and northern Nigeria were included. Africa's present makeup includes Ghana, Sierra Leone, Gambia, Western Nigeria, Eastern Nigeria and Northern Nigeria. Each of these countries and areas are a post- colonial period, or what the Ghanaian writer Kwame Appiah dubs neo- colonialism. British West Africa's development was solely based on modernization, and autonomous educational systems were the first step to modernising indigenous culture. Cultures and interests of indigenous peoples were ignored. A new social order, as well as European influences within schools and local traditions, helped mould British West Africa's culture. Significant was the British West African colonial school curriculum. Local elites developed, with new values and philosophies, who changed the overall cultural development. In terms of social issues with British West Africa; sex and race usually conflicted each other (Carina E. Ray called it the \\"White Wife Problem\\"). During British West Africa's history, interracial relations were frowned upon, and couples might be discriminated against. There were even certain policies that deported the wives of these relationships back to Britain and denied them access to any of these colonies. Aftermath Even after its final dissolution, a single currency, the British West African pound, was in effect throughout the region—including Nigeria—from 1907 to 1962. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Sierra Leone was self-governing by 1958 and gained independence in 1961. Gambia gained independence in 1965. In 1954, the British Gold Coast was allowed by Britain to self-govern and in 1957, the Gold Coast was given independence from Britain, under the name Ghana.

History Tamar in the Church of the Dormition, with a model of the church; an aetiological myth has the young Tamar, when out hunting with Giorgi, lost in the caves; when called for, she replied \\"I am here, uncle\\" () \\"ac var dzia\\", giving the site its name Soviet-era excavations have shown that the area of Vardzia was inhabited during the Bronze Age and indicated the reach of Trialeti culture. Cave settlements such as Uplistsikhe are known along the Kura River from at least the fifth century BC, while rock cut architecture in the context of Georgian Christianity is known from Zedazeni and Garedzhi from the sixth century AD, and more locally from Vanis Kvabebi, Cholta and Margastani from the eighth century. Four distinct building phases have been identified at Vardzia: the first during the reign of Giorgi III (1156–1184), when the site was laid out and the first cave dwellings excavated; the second between his death and the marriage of his successor Tamar in 1186, when the Church of the Dormition was carved out and decorated; the third from that date until the Battle of Basian c.1203, during which time many more dwellings as well as the defences, water supply, and irrigation network were constructed; while the fourth was a period of partial rebuilding after heavy damage in the earthquake of 1283. A number of documentary sources supplement the knowledge derived from the site's physical fabric. The collection of chronicles known as the History of Georgia refers to Tamar erecting a church to house the icon of the Virgin of Vardzia after receiving divine help in her campaigns, before transferring the monastery from Upper or Zeda Vardzia. Tamar is said to have departed from Vardzia during her campaign against the Muslims, and her ensuing victory at Basian is celebrated in the Hymns in Honour of the Virgin of Vardzia by Ioane Shavteli. The History of Georgia also relates how Vardzia escaped the Mongol invaders in the 1290s. The Persian Safavid chronicler Hasan Bey Rumlu describes Vardzia as a \\"wonder\\", \\"impregnable as the wall of Alexander the Great\\", before recounting its sack by the Persians under Shah Tahmasp I in 1551; a near-contemporary note in the Vardzia Gospel tells of its repatriation from a Persian bazaar. After the arrival of the Ottomans in 1578, the monks departed and the site was abandoned. Site The greater Vardzia area includes also the early eleventh-century church at Zeda Vardzia and the tenth- to twelfth-century rock village and cave churches of Ananauri. The main lower site was carved from the cliff's central stratum of tufaceous breccia at an elevation of thirteen hundred metres above sea level. It is divided into an eastern and a western part by the Church of the Dormition. In the eastern part of the complex are seventy-nine separate cave dwellings, in eight tiers and with a total of 242 rooms, including six chapels, \\"Tamar's Room\\", a meeting room, reception chamber, pharmacy, and twenty-five wine cellars; 185 wine jars sunk into the floor document the importance of viticulture to the monastic economy. In the western part, between the bell tower and the main church, are a further forty houses, in thirteen tiers and with a total of 165 rooms, including six chapels, a refectory with a bakery, other ovens for baking bread, and a forge. Beyond the bell tower the complex rises to nineteen tiers, with steps leading to a cemetery. Infrastructure includes access tunnels, water facilities, and provision for defence. Church of the Dormition View to the apse and iconostasis or screen decorated with icons that separates the nave from the sanctuary The Church of the Dormition was the central spiritual and monumental focus of the site. Carved similarly from the rock, its walls reinforced in stone, it measures by , rising to a height of . Both church and narthex are painted; these paintings are of \\"crucial significance in the development of the Medieval Georgian mural painting\\". Its patron, Rati Surameli, is commemorated in a donor portrait on the north wall; the accompanying inscription reads \\"Mother of God, accept ... the offering of your servant Rati, eristavi of Kartli, who has zealously decorated this holy church to your glory\\". On the same north wall are portraits of the royal founders, Giorgi III and Tamar; she lacks the ribbon that is the attribute of a married woman and her inscription includes the formula \\"God grant her a long life\\", while that of Giorgi does not; this helps date the paintings to between Giorgi's death in 1184 and Tamar's marriage in 1186. Episodes from the life of Christ occupy the vaults and upper walls in a sequence, starting with the Annunciation, followed by the Nativity, Presentation in the Temple, Baptism, Transfiguration, Raising of Lazarus, Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, Last Supper, Washing of the Feet, Crucifixion, Harrowing of Hell, Ascension, Descent of the Holy Spirit, and Dormition (the church is sometimes known as the Church of the Assumption, which corresponds with the Orthodox Feast of the Dormition). At a lower level, more accessible as intercessors, are paintings of saints and stylites. On the rear wall of the sanctuary, behind the altar, are Twelve Church Fathers. In the narthex are scenes of the Last Judgment, Bosom of Abraham, Angels bearing a Medallion with the Cross, and three scenes from the life of Saint Stephen; other paintings were lost in the 1283 earthquake. The paintings are not frescoes, but executed in secco, and \\"testify to contacts with the Christian Orient and the Byzantine world, but applied using local artistic traditions\\". Management Since 1985 the site has formed part of the Vardzia Historical–Architectural Museum-Reserve, which includes forty-six architectural sites, twelve archaeological sites, and twenty-one sites of monumental art. In 1999 Vardzia-Khertvisi was submitted for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List as a Cultural Site in accordance with criteria ii, iii, iv, v, and vi. In their evaluation, advisory body ICOMOS cited Göreme in Cappadocia as the closest comparandum amongst cave monastery sites of international significance. In 2007 Vardzia-Khertvisi was resubmitted as a mixed Cultural and Natural Site in accordance also with criterion vii. From 2012, conservation of the wall paintings in the Church of the Dormition is to be carried out by the Courtauld Institute of Art in conjunction with the National Agency for Cultural Heritage Preservation of Georgia and Tbilisi State Academy of Arts.

Named by Robert Savage in 1973, Megistotherium is one of the largest hyaenodontids known. Like the other hyaenodontids, it had an enormous skull relative to its body; up to in length and a body mass estimated at 500 kg (1,100 lb). The carnassial teeth of Megistotherium (like those of other hyaenodontids) were the upper first molars, and overlapped with their lower molar counterparts like scissors to form a formidable and powerful shearing action. The land that is now the Sahara desert was much more fertile in the Miocene. A considerable amount of it was grassland and rainfall was plentiful. Lakes and ponds provided water for large fauna, which provided Megistotherium and other predators with an ample supply of prey. Large hyaenodontids like this one could have originally evolved as specialized predators or scavengers of large African herbivores. Gomphothere bones have been found with its fossils, indicating that Megistotherium may have hunted them for food. Taxonomy The clade Hyaenodontidae comprised a diverse group of creodont predators that were most successful during the Eocene before being possibly ecologically displaced by the order Carnivora during the late Oligocene. Megistotherium emerged in the Miocene towards the end of the hyaenodontids' flourishing; it was a part of a radiation of African hyaenodontids that occurred at that time. Hyainailouros sulzeri is very closely related to Megistotherium, extremely similar in size, structure and ratios - with a long tail, short limbs and robust body.Ginsburg, L. 1980.

She was a runner-up for the Newbery Medal for her first book, Across Five Aprils, and won the medal for her second, Up a Road Slowly. For her contribution as a children's writer she was U.S. nominee in 1974 for the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Award, the highest international recognition available to creators of children's books. Life Hunt was born to Franklin P. and Sarah Land Hunt on May 18, 1907 in Pontiac, Illinois. The family soon moved to Newton, Illinois, but Franklin died when Hunt was only seven, and the family moved again to be close to Hunt's grandparents. Hunt's childhood was lonely, but she shared a special relationship with her grandfather. He told her stories about his childhood during the Civil War. In Minneapolis she earned her M.A. In Illinois public schools, she was a teacher of English and French. Later, she taught psychology at the University of South Dakota, Vermillion, but eventually came back to elementary and junior high school to become a director of language arts in Illinois. After she retired in 1969, Hunt devoted her time to writing. Hunt was 57 when her debut novel Across Five Aprils was published in 1964, and it received much acclaim. Chosen a Newbery Honor Book, the novel was also Hunt's personal favorite among the ones she wrote. A critic maintains: \\"Brilliant characterization, a telling sense of story, an uncanny ability to balance fact and fiction, and compassionate, graceful writing mark Hunt's small but distinguished body of work.\\" With Across Five Aprils, Hunt established herself as one of the greatest historical novelists, proving that she can write for both adult and children audiences. With her faith in \\"courage, love, and mercy,\\" Hunt wrote her books to emphasize this faith. Her next novel, Up a Road Slowly, won the 1967 Newbery Medal.

The album was recorded in an apartment in Paris, France during 2003 and released by Touch and Go Records on March 9, 2004 in the United States and April 12, 2004 in the United Kingdom. The album is characterized by its lo-fi aesthetic and experimental approach to production. It has been described as pop, indie, electronic, found sounds, folk, folk rock, blues, folk-blues, and trip hop, as well as influenced by delta blues, hip hop, and 1970s folk. The album's vocal style has been compared to the vocal styles of Billie Holiday, Fiona Apple and Nelly Furtado. CocoRosie originally planned to make only a few copies of the album, with the intent to distribute it to friends, but were allegedly persuaded by Touch and Go Records to release it under their label. The album's cover art and layout were partially designed by musician and graphic designer Jon Beasley of Hecuba, who has toured with freak folk act Devendra Banhart who featured on CocoRosie's second album Noah's Ark. The album was mastered by Roger Seibel. Reception La Maison de Mon Rêve received generally mixed reviews. Sam Ubl of Pitchfork reviewed the album one day after its release, giving it a rating of 6.9 out of 10. The mixed review described it as \\"an ingratiating album that suffers only from its sometimes overbearing affectation\\", stating that it \\"beams with all the lazy romanticism of an unemployed Upper East-Sider on expat life-delay\\" and adding that \\"...what CocoRosie have done with original source material on La Maison de Mon Reve is essentially what Danger Mouse attempted to do with existing music on his lauded The Grey Album ... overdubbed two styles of music, generationally- removed but deceptively similar, and the result is closer to the mean of its parts than the sum.\\" Ubl described the album's vocals as \\"crooning unabashedly\\" and some lyrics as \\"doggone cringe-worthy\\" and \\"particularly guileless\\", but \\"delivered passionately enough to slide by unnoticed\\". Heather Phares of AllMusic gave the album 4 out of 5 stars, describing it as \\"an enchanting debut\\" and \\"a dreamy yet challenging confection of found sounds, folk-blues, trip-hop, girlish pop, and experimental recording and production techniques.\\" Amazon Music editorial reviews describe the album as \\"deceptively innocent; enchanting and sweet yet eerie and twisted\\", deeming it \\"a haze of cryptic sounds and perversely angelic voices.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from liner notes. * CocoRosie – production, recording, design, layout * Roger Seibel – mastering * Jon Beasley – layout References External links * 2004 debut albums CocoRosie albums Touch and Go Records albums Folktronica albums ","title":"La maison de mon rêve"},{"id":"2819019","text":"Thunderbugs were a British girl group, briefly popular in 1999 who played their own instruments.

Through her marriage to Johannes, 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, she became the Princess Consort of Thurn und Taxis. Early life and family Countess Gloria von Schönburg-Glauchau was born on 23 February 1960 in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, West Germany. Her father, Joachim, Count of Schönburg-Glauchau, was the nominal head of the Glauchau branch of the German princely Schönburg family, a mediatised dynasty within the former Holy Roman Empire. Her mother, Countess Beatrix Széchenyi de Sárvár-Felsővidék, was a member of the Hungarian nobility and a descendant of Count István Széchenyi. Her parents divorced in 1986 and her father married a second time to Ursula Zwicker. Gloria descends from various European royal and noble families including the Chotek, Trubetskoy, von Rechteren-Limpurg-Speckfeld, Kinsky and Golitsyn. She is one of five children from her father's two marriages. she has 2 brothers, Carl Count von Schoenburg-Glauchau, born 2.2.1966 and formerly head of the family but renounced his rights after his marriage to Juliet Helene Beechhey Fowler, younger brother Alexander, Count of Schönburg- Glauchau, a writer and the current nominal head of the Schönburg family. One of her sisters was the socialite Countess Maya von Schönburg-Glauchau. Gloria was baptized as an infant and raised in the Catholic faith. When she was a child, Gloria and her family moved to Africa, living in Togo and Somalia, where her father worked as an author and a journalist. Although a member of the German nobility, her family had little wealth as a result of Communism in Germany and Hungary. Her family's ancestral homes, Wechselburg, Glauchau Rochsburg and Penig Castles, had been seized by the Soviet government of Saxony in 1945. She moved back to Germany with her family in 1970 and was enrolled at the Konrad-Adenauer-Gymnasium in Meckenheim, later studying at Kloster Wald, a girl's boarding school in a Benedictine convent. As a teenager she worked as a waitress at a ski resort in St Moritz, Switzerland.  Marriage and issue  In 1979 Gloria met Johannes, Hereditary Prince of Thurn and Taxis at a luncheon he was hosting at Nürnberger Bratwurst Glöckl in Munich. She had attended as the guest of his nephew Johannes von Schönborn. A few days later she ran into him at Café Reitschule while on her way to a Supertramp concert with friends. She decided to have dinner with him instead of attending the concert. They began a relationship soon after and she accompanied him on a trip to South America. On 31 May 1980, Gloria and Johannes married in a Catholic ceremony in Regensburg, Bavaria. She wore a Valentino dress and a diamond diadem that had belonged to Empress Eugénie at the wedding.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNnlvzCUn0Y At the time of their marriage Johannes was estimated to be worth between US$2 and US$3 billion. She and her husband are fourth cousins twice removed, both descending from Karl Alexander, 5th Prince of Thurn and Taxis. Upon their marriage she became the Hereditary Princess of Thurn and Taxis. When her father-in-law, Karl August, 10th Prince of Thurn and Taxis, died in 1982 her husband became the 11th Prince of Thurn and Taxis.Willis, Daniel. The Descendants of King George I of Great Britain. Clearfield, 2002, Baltimore, US. p. 516. .In 1919 royalty and nobility were mandated to lose their privileges in Germany, hereditary titles were to be legally borne thereafter only as part of the surname, according to Article 109 of the Weimar Constitution. Styles such as majesty and highness were not retained. The couple had three children: * Princess Maria Theresia Ludowika Klothilde Helene Alexandra, born 28 November 1980 in Regensburg. On 13 September 2014, she married Hugo Wilson, a British artist, in Tutzing, Germany. They have two daughters. ** Mafalda Beatrix Maria Wilson (born 21 August 2015).Maria Theresia Ludowika Klothilde Helene Alexandra Prinzessin von Thurn und Taxis The Peerage. ** Maya Romy Alexandra Wilson (born 22 September 2017). * Princess Elisabeth Margarete Maria Anna Beatrix, born 24 March 1982 in Regensburg. * Prince Albert Maria Lamoral Miguel Johannes Gabriel, born 24 June 1983 in Regensburg, who succeeded his father in 1990 as both principal heir at law and nominal head of the former German princely House of Thurn and Taxis according to the traditional rules of the legal affairs committee of the Association of German Nobility.  Later life  Gloria and her husband were known for their lavish lifestyle, becoming social and fashion icons in the 1980s. She became part of the European jet set and was referred to in the media as the \\"punk princess\\" and \\"Princess TNT\\". When her husband died in 1990, Gloria was left to settle his debts, which totaled at US$500 million. Her son, Albert, became the 12th Prince of Thurn and Taxis at the time of Johannes' death. She acted as the trustee for Albert, taking over management of the family estate, Saint Emmeram's Abbey. She went into isolation from society, studying finance, accounting, and estate management. She sold off family property including art, jewelry, castles, cars, and land to preserve the family fortune.https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/08/arts/design/74-million- parts-princess-from-her-art.html During this time she undertook a spiritual pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in Lourdes, France, emerging as a sobered Roman Catholic activist and philanthropist. In 2001 Gloria was severely criticized for stating on a talk show that the high rate of AIDS in African countries was due not to a lack of safe sex practices but to the fact that \\"the blacks like to copulate ('schnackseln') a lot\\". In 2008 she said in an interview that Africans have a lot of sex because of Africa's higher temperatures. Gloria accompanied her sister, Maya, on pilgrimages to Lourdes and Santiago de Compostela Cathedral in Spain after Maya was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2012. Gloria has become a successful artist, focusing mainly on portraits done with oil paint and pastel. The Hotel Chelsea asked her to do a series of pastels of its most famous denizens—a gallery show which brought her much acclaim as a painter. She has referred to herself as a \\"dilettante\\", and cites her art collection as inspirtation for her contemporary style of portraiture.http://www.larryslist.com/artmarket/the- talks/why-a-princess-collector-turned-into-a-painter In 2015 she had a solo show at the National Exemplar Gallery in New York. She also paints freelance. In January 2019 the El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan decided to cancel an upcoming exhibition of Gloria's work at their 50th anniversary gala due to her right wing political stances and comments she had made about race and AIDS.https://www.artnews.com/art-news/news/facing-criticism-el-museo-nixes- plan-honor-princess-gloria-von-thurn-und-taxis-gala-11673/ Princess Gloria with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in 2015. A devout Catholic, Gloria serves 300 hot meals to the poor every day from a dedicated room in her home. She also works closely with conservative Traditionalist Catholic leaders including Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò, Cardinal Raymond Burke, Wilhelm Imkamp, and Steve Bannon. Her palatial home, Schloss Thurn und Taxis was suggested by Bannon as a potential site for a school to educate and train right-wing Catholics, although no firm plans have been made. Gloria is a personal friend of Hillary Clinton, and was one of a dozen women to attend her 2016 birthday party.

In this, a massive run on banks by depositors most of them from neighboring Argentina caused the government to freeze banking operations. The crisis was caused by a considerable contraction in Uruguay's economy and by over-dependence on Argentina (tourism, and construction boom), which experienced an economic meltdown itself in late 2001. In total, approximately 1/3 of the country's deposits were withdrawn and five financial institutions were left insolvent. According to many sources, the banking crisis could have been avoided if Uruguayan authorities had properly regulated their banks. The Central Bank of Uruguay (BCU) had trusted international banks to regulate themselves properly and was too lenient and slow in responding to the crisis. Banco Comercial del Uruguay In 1990, Chemical Overseas Holdings, Inc. (a subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase) together with Dresdner Bank Latinamerika and Credit Suisse First Boston acquired the Banco Comercial del Uruguay (BCU), one of that country's oldest and largest national banks. Over time, Uruguay developed into a large offshore banking center for Argentina and Brazil, largely as a result of its lax banking laws and the predominant view among Argentines that Uruguay was a stable place for their savings. As a result of the banking crisis, some US$800 million went missing from the BCU alone. In the end, five financial institutions failed and hundreds of thousands of depositors in Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil were left in dire economic straits after seeing their bank accounts literally disappear. In January 2005, the Paris-based International Chamber of Commerce ruled that the Uruguayan government would have to pay US$120 million to JPMorgan Chase & Co., Dresdner Bank AG, and Credit Suisse First Boston for failing to maintain the solvency of the BCU. The crisis underscores the three banks’ difficulty in managing risk in developing countries and dealing with local partners during a time of financial crisis. As a result, a class of BC's former depositors is suing the three international banks and the individual directors they appointed to BC's board to recover the losses suffered as a result of the bank's collapse.

Collegiate wrestling career  Woodin received a degree in agricultural engineering from Cornell University and a degree in mechanical engineering from Michigan State University. Before becoming a professional wrestler, Woodin was a successful collegiate wrestler. While wrestling for the Michigan State Spartans, Woodin won two Big Ten titles in 1958 and 1959. He also finished second in the NCAA tournament in 1958 and 1959. As a junior at Michigan State, Woodin won the 1958 Big Ten 177-pound title by pinning Gary Kurdelmeier of the University of Iowa at 8:21. A couple of weeks later, the two met again in the 177-pound finals of the 1958 NCAAs at the University of Wyoming, where Woodin lost to Kurdelmeier 6-2. As a senior, Woodin defeated Iowa's Gordon Trapp 6–4 in the heavyweight finals to win his second Big Ten title. At the 1959 NCAAs, the Michigan State Spartan competed in the 191-pound class, making it to the finals for the second year in a row, but lost 9-5 to Syracuse's Art Baker. With his two runner-up finishes at the national championships, Woodin was a two-time NCAA All-American.  Professional wrestling career  Woodin began his wrestling career at the age of 28 using the name \\"Tim Woods\\". He was then given the name \\"Mr. Wrestling\\" by Nebraska promotor Joe Dusek, and subsequently adopted both a white wrestling mask and white singlet to complete the character. Mr. Wrestling became a major superstar in the Georgia, Florida, Texas and Mid-Atlantic territories. He wrestled in the World Wide Wrestling Federation in the northeast, at the upper end of the preliminary wrestlers. Starting in the Seventies, he would alternate between his masked persona as Mr. Wrestling and wrestling unmasked as Tim Woods, depending on the territory. In 1968, Woodin faced street fighter Arnold Spurlin, a former Golden Gloves champion, in a shoot fight in Columbus, Georgia. After Woodin dominated the match, using non-wrestling moves and blows with his fists, Spurlin bit down on the only thing he could to stop the melee - Woodin’s finger. As Woodin danced around Spurlin in pain and trying to remove his finger from his opponent’s grip, other wrestlers entered the ring and began beating Spurlin. Spurlin’ s friends then joined in with knives in hand to run off the wrestlers. As they did, Spurlin spit Woodin’s finger joint across the ring. The finger was subsequently surgically reattached, but Woodin did not regain full use of it. Later that year, Woodin challenged NWA World Heavyweight Champion Gene Kiniski, with the bout being stopped after Woodin's finger began bleeding. = 1975 plane crash = Woodin was involved in the same 1975 plane crash that involved pilot Joseph Michael Farkas (he ended up in a coma and died the next year), wrestling legend Johnny Valentine (broke his back and bone fragments impacted into his spinal cord, which ended his career), wrestler Bob Bruggers (broke his back and had a steel rod put in; Bruggers could have made a comeback, but he decided to retire), future legend Ric Flair (broke his back, but recovered and returned to wrestling), and Jim Crockett Promotions' announcer David Crockett. At the hospital, Woodin gave them his real name (George Burrell Woodin), and told them that he was a promoter. Since Woodin wrestled under the name Tim Woods, a newspaper article in the Charlotte Observer listed his name as his real name, George Burrell Woodin, and mentioned that he was a promoter. Woodin was the only fan favorite wrestler on the plane, while the rest wrestled as villains, and this was back in the days when kayfabe was not broken (at the time, Woods was feuding with Flair and Valentine) and heroes and villains were not known to travel together. Eventually, rumors began circulating that Woods was in fact on the plane. Unwilling to risk the exposure of professional wrestling, he got back in the ring two weeks after the crash and was obviously in extreme pain. Flair later said in his book To Be the Man, that he was \\"more than just Mr. Wrestling that day, but was the man who saved wrestling.\\" = Retirement = Woodin retired from professional wrestling in 1983. After retiring, he ran a heating and air conditioning business.  Personal life  Woodin was an avid collector of motorcycles as well as an accomplished photographer and saxophone player.

The reservoir is long and covers . The dam is at the southern end of the reservoir, and the northern end, splits into north-western and north-eastern shallow arms. It is currently managed, jointly by the South West Lakes Trust and South West Water. There is public access to the dam and parking area only. History The reservoir was first given statutory approval in 1938 (under the Penzance Corporation Act 1938) but construction was deferred until after World War II. A joint water scheme was agreed by the Penzance and St Ives Borough Councils to provide water for the Land's End peninsula in 1951 and work finally commenced on 1 March 1959 by Robert Alpine and Sons. The original design had to be amended during excavations when rotting granite was found. It was completed for the West Cornwall Water Board in 1961. It is still the principal source of water for the Penwith area. The valley of Trewidden Vean, now known as the Lost Valley, was evacuated starting in 1938, with the last family leaving in 1961. The valley was cleared of trees before building started and most of Nanquitho Farm and farmhouse is now under water. The water level in the reservoir sometimes drops low enough to reveal the remains of houses and roads; this happened in the 1970s, the 1990s, and in the summer of 2018. Natural history and ecology Initially, in 1962, the reservoir was stocked with 8000 rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) from Loch Leven trout fisheries and many buckets of shrimps from Stithians Reservoir. At the beginning of the 21st-century there was over eighty mute swan (Cygnus olor) and many Canada goose (Branta canadensis) due to feeding them out of date items from a local bakery. At the request of the Bolitho Estate feeding was stopped to protect the fishery and water quality. Due to its geographical location close to the sea, plus good areas of shallow water and exposed mud, it is an important landfall for migrating waders. The north-west arm of the reservoir is managed by the Cornwall Birdwatching and Preservation Society (CBWPS) and the bird hide, due to insurance considerations, is open to members of that organisation only. A successful bird reserve needs an area that is free of continuous disturbance and in 2001 a no fishing area was established in the north-west arm, along with a reed bed of Phragmites australis. A year later it was reported that the no fishing area had helped breeding birds which included common coot (Fulica atra), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) and mute swan. Although generally hosting only small numbers of birds (244 species recorded), the reservoir has attracted a considerable number of North American vagrant shorebirds and wildfowl, including a number of lesser scaup (Aythya affinis). In May 2016 a Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus) was seen in western Cornwall and was frequently seen on the reservoir. There are 5,000 year old fossil remains of this species from Somerset and this bird could be the first recorded in Britain since then. At the same time as the Dalmatian pelican, a cackling goose, (Branta hutchinsii), which is a scarce but regular North American vagrant was at the reservoir. Rainbow trout and blue trout are released in the reservoir for trout fishing along with the native brown trout (Salmo trutta). The Cornish open float tube competition is held annually in May.

He was the first captain of the Pakistan Test cricket team. He is one of the only three players to have played Test cricket for both India and Pakistan, the other two being Amir Elahi and Gul Mohammad. He also served as the member of the Provincial Assembly of the Punjab and remained Punjab Minister for Food under the Bhutto government. He married an English woman, Helen Rosemary Hastilow, the daughter of the Warwickshire County Cricket Club chairman Cyril Hastilow and a Pakistani woman, sister of Pakistani cricketer Zulfiqar Ahmed. He captained the Pakistan cricket team in its first 23 Test matches from 1952 to 1958 and was later the nation's leading cricket administrator. He is widely regarded as the father figure of Pakistan cricket. He received the Pride of Performance Award from the Government of Pakistan in 1958.The top 10 Pakistan Test cricketers The Sunday Times (London newspaper), Retrieved 21 June 2019 Early career Kardar was born in a famous Kardar Arain family of Lahore, Punjab in 1925, and educated at Islamia College, Lahore and University College, Oxford. He played domestic cricket for a variety of teams, including Oxford University, Northern India and Muslims. He was one of the few players of his generation who played for India in Tests against England, and following the independence of Pakistan, representing Pakistan. Kardar was appointed to lead the team which would play its first official Test series touring India in 1952–53. Kardar fielded his men against Lala Amarnath's Indian team. Although India won in Delhi and Bombay and won the series, Kardar's Pakistani team achieved their first Test victory in only the second Test in Lucknow. He was a left-handed batsman and a slow left-arm orthodox spin bowler, scoring 6,832 runs and taking 344 wickets in first-class cricket. He averaged 29.83 in batting, and 24.55 in bowling. Kardar played for the Pakistan team from 1948 to 1952, in the years before Pakistan was granted Test status. Kardar also played for Warwickshire and Pakistan Services. Pakistan's captain Kardar captained Pakistan against all the Test playing nations of the day, and achieved an unparalleled distinction of leading his team to victory against each of them, which was remarkable for a nascent cricketing nation. Especially famous was the series-levelling victory achieved touring England in 1954 at The Oval. Kardar and his men also created history by winning the first-ever and only Test against Australia in Karachi in 1957. Although aggressive, motivated and confident, Kardar's Pakistan was yet immature, inexperienced and raw in their cricketing skills to win series victories. The attitude of the players was especially criticised when all the five Tests played by the Indian cricket team on its first tour of Pakistan in 1954–55 ended in a draw. The fear of both Indian and Pakistani players of losing to each other, owing to political tensions and the bloody legacy of independence, was too much for competitive cricket to be played. During his tenure, Pakistan won six, lost six and drew eleven matches in a total of 23 Tests. In all his positions of authority, he was inclined to be dictatorial and quickly angered, especially by any hint of criticism. But he was also a visionary and was an advocate of neutral umpires.Profile of Abdul Hafeez Kardar on espncricinfo.com website Retrieved 21 June 2019 Kardar retired from international Test cricket in 1958. Later career Kardar had been a strong supporter of Mohammad Ali Jinnah and an adherent to the idea of Muslim glory in India. Abdul Hafeez Kardar went into politics and served as the president of the Pakistan Cricket Board from 1972 to 1977. His tenure was notable for increasing representation of Asian and African cricketing nations with the International Cricket Council. Kardar was forced to resign after an embarrassing pay dispute with the players in 1977. He also worked with many charitable and social development causes, and in the last years of his life was Pakistan's ambassador to Switzerland, prior to his death in his hometown, Lahore in 1996. Kardar is today credited with popularising cricket among Pakistani people, for his tutelage of some of Pakistan's greatest cricketers, young talent and prodigies, and his stewardship of the Pakistan team and the board in its early years, developing a culture of pride and professionalism. He was also elected to the provincial assembly of Punjab in 1970 on a ticket of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), and served in the provincial cabinet as a minister. Tribute In 2019, he was featured as a Google Doodle on what would have been his 94th birthday.

A prison film, its plot concerns a boy brought up in group homes who has a gift and passion for art. It also marked the film debut of future Oscar-nominated Mary J. Blige as an actress.  Plot  The film centers around 10-year-old intelligent Elijah Butler (Justin 'DJ' Spaulding) living in New York. His mother (Mary J. Blige) is a hard-working woman who has spent the last several years attending night school – with the eventual goal of becoming a lawyer. Given that she is from a lower-class area, she is having a tough time finding employment as a legal secretary. Her fiancé, Cee (Harold Perrineau), a photographer and supporter of the family, has a genuine bond with Elijah. Later, Cee is incarcerated after assaulting an officer who began harassing him on a street corner for taking pictures of passing pedestrians. He ends up serving twenty- five to life term for having three consecutive charges. Later that night, Elijah and his best friend, Thomas Wilson (Dominique Walters), find themselves incarcerated at a juvenile correctional facility for playing a prank on a police officer with a laser pointer. When Elijah's mother comes to get him and is told he could not be released, Elijah is taken from her with both trying their best to get to one another. She assaults an officer by stabbing him with a pen and then is taken to a mental institution. The officer she assaulted tried to stop her when she tries to take Elijah out of the facility. Elijah has one visit with his mother, who is unaware of her surroundings due to obvious medication given from the facility. Elijah eventually is released from the juvenile facility and put in a foster home. The film picks up years later, and Elijah (Q-Tip) is now a sensitive adult with dreams of becoming an artist with the support of his girlfriend Jolie (Denee Rivera). He is offered a spot at a prestigious art school under scholarship, but it gets taken away and is now unable to afford the tuition. Much to the chagrin of Cee who Elijah still sees through prison visits, Elijah considers a foray into the world of drug dealing. Though he eventually decides against that route, he winds up in jail for accidentally killing one of his foster brothers Big Pete (Fat Joe) by pushing him on to the subway tracks during an altercation. Elijah is then found guilty of second-degree murder and sentenced to fifteen years to life. When he gets to jail, he is reunited with Thomas (Eric McCollum). Having a hard time adapting to prison life, Elijah takes an art class and paints works of art that impresses his fellow prisoners; however, due to funds, the art class is discontinued, much to his dismay. The prisoners are then subjected to hard labor on an abandoned building. Elijah then stages an uprising by setting fire to the building, which puts him in solitary confinement. Life for the prisoners gets worse when the officers take away the water, gym, physical education and classes, which sends Elijah to his breaking and decides to break out. Elijah concocts a plan to break out of prison and enlists the help of Thomas, his cellmate Harris (Danny Hoch), KT (Clay Da Raider), Brown (Bobbito Garcia), and Jay (Hassan Johnson), who works as an electrician in the jail. Before the group proceeds with the plan, Harris bails out at the last minute. The group uses a ladder to break through the window and press a button that opens the gate. As the group makes their way to a police car, Jay stabs Thomas multiple times in the back with a screwdriver as revenge. (Earlier in the film, Thomas stole toilet paper from Jay and he tried to stab Thomas, who turned the tables on him and slit his mouth and sent him to protective custody.) Elijah goes back to save Thomas, who ends up dying in his arms. He ends up getting stuck in between a four-wall fence while holding an officer hostage and is then killed by a shotgun blast to the chest. Sometime later, Elijah's artwork of people he drew during his time in prison ends up at an art gallery, with visitors looking at each one. The camera then zooms in on a painting of Elijah and Thomas as kids as the film ends.  Cast  *Q-Tip - Elijah Dixon Butler **Justin \\"DJ JUS\\" Spaulding - young Elijah *Mary J.

The Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum  The Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum at Sookmyung Women’s University is an exhibition, educational, and research facility dedicated to advancing the knowledge and appreciation of embroidery and textile arts. Inaugurated in May 2004, the museum houses an extensive collection of embroidered and woven textiles representing various periods and regions. The museum’s permanent collection, primarily focused on East Asian costume and decorative arts, is among the most comprehensive of its kind in Asia. Its wide scope illuminates the cross-cultural dialogues in technique and style that have enriched textile arts. Through exhibition and education efforts, the museum seeks to highlight the technical and artistic achievement of embroiderers across time and place; expand understanding of the social and cultural roles that textiles have fulfilled globally; and establish the art of embroidery as a significant contribution to world culture. Housed in a new building that includes exhibition galleries, an information center, a library, conservation studios, classrooms, and a 300-seat auditorium equipped with earphones for simultaneous translation, the museum aims to become a leading center for scholarship in embroidery and other textile arts. =The collection= The permanent collection of the Chung Young Yang Embroidery Museum includes votive textiles, ecclesiastical robes, military uniforms, folding screens, wedding garments, chair and table coverings, rank insignia, and various types of clothing, costume accessories, and household furnishings used by all social classes. The collection encompasses a broad range of examples from around the world as well as replicas of extant ancient artifacts. The museum seeks to encourage the examination of embroidered textiles as primary documents of the technological, social, and cultural environments that produced them as well as to emphasize embroidery’s position as an important cultural inheritance and an expressive, dynamic, and continually evolving art form.  Controversy  In 2012, Sookymung University's board was involved in a scandal involving alleged money \\"laundering\\". Specifically, according to the school's internal laws, the university's board is obliged to make financial contributions to the operational budget of the school through a foundation. However, when the school received a total of 68.5 billion won ($61 million) in donations from 1995 to 2009, the university's board placed these donations in a foundation account and then transferred them to a school administration account, making it appear as if it was the foundation which made a financial contribution to the school's management. Excluding these 'donations', the foundation made no contribution of its own to school administration. As a consequence, from 1995 to 2009 Sookmyung University students paid 5% more tuition fee than they otherwise would have had to do.http://www.koreaherald.com/common_prog/newsprint.php?ud=20120216001117&dt;=2  Notable people  *Moon Hee-kyung, actress See also *Sookmyung Gayageum Orchestra *Sookmyung Girls' High School *Asian Women, academic journal of the Research Institute of Asian Women (RIAW) based at Sookmyung Women's University References External links *The official website *The official English website *Sookmyung Network to Open World *SNOW (Sookmyung Network to Open World) Yongsan District Universities and colleges in Seoul Women's universities and colleges in South Korea Private universities and colleges in South Korea Educational institutions established in 1906 1906 establishments in Korea ","title":"Sookmyung Women's University"},{"id":"2819176","text":"Kim's Game is a game or exercise played by Boy Scouts,Scouting Games by Sir Robert S.

He served as Deputy President of the Nigerian People's Redemption Party during the Nigerian second republic and as a member of the governing board for the University of Sokoto, now Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto. After Dr. Okeke and S.G Ikoku defected to the NPN, Dr. Okeke served as Special Advisor to President Shehu Shagari, and as Chairman of the Nigerian Presidential Taskforce on Rice.

The series debuted on Channel 101 at the June 26, 2005 screening. It placed in the top five at subsequent screenings until the June 25, 2006 screening, where it placed seventh and was canceled. The show remained a popular download on Channel 101, convincing the creators to make two additional episodes independently. The 11th episode, featuring Jason Lee as Kevin Bacon, debuted during a screening at the Knitting Factory in New York City on December 27, 2007 and was later included with the other episodes on Channel 101. On May 5, 2010, the 12th and final episode of Yacht Rock was released onto YouTube and Channel 101. The series inspired the term \\"yacht rock\\" as a musical descriptor for the songs and artists it features.  Creation and inspiration  The series was written, directed, and produced by J. D. Ryznar, co-produced by David Lyons and Hunter D. Stair, and edited by Lane Farnham. The production has a \\"bad-on-purpose aesthetic\\". Ryznar and Stair devised the series after noticing the converging recording careers of such bands as Steely Dan, Toto, and The Doobie Brothers and the singer-songwriters Kenny Loggins and Michael McDonald. For example, McDonald co-wrote Loggins' \\"This Is It\\" and Loggins co- wrote McDonald's hit, \\"What a Fool Believes,\\" for his band The Doobie Brothers. McDonald also performed backing vocals for several other 'yacht rock' artists, including Steely Dan, Toto and Christopher Cross. Ryznar admits to having a fascination with the music of the period. As he explained, \\"Getting into Steely Dan really started this for me. As did the ability to buy dollar records at Amoeba and put them on tapes for my car. Kenny Loggins has made his way into all the pilots I've been involved with except [one].\\" As Ryznar told Reuters contributor Andy Sullivan, \\"I'm making fun of the songwriting process, but the music is generally treated pretty lovingly.\\"  Synopsis  Yacht Rock's episodes are \\"hosted\\" by \\"Hollywood\\" Steve Huey, a music critic for AllMusic. The term \\"Yacht Rock\\" is never used throughout the series by any characters except for by Huey during his introductions; instead, it is always referred to as \\"smooth music\\". The series depicts some realistic aspects of the music, but builds exaggerated storylines around them. For example, main protagonists Loggins and McDonald receive inspiration from a fictional impresario named Koko Goldstein, whose death in Episode 2 ultimately leads them to go their separate ways musically. Another example is the series' depiction of several real-life characters. McDonald is an idealistic and earnest singer/songwriter, but takes both smooth music and himself far too seriously. Loggins is his easygoing friend and frequent collaborator who eventually abandons smooth music in favor of commercial rock and roll in the 80s, which strains their friendship. The portrayal of John Oates as the abusive, foulmouthed leader of Hall & Oates, exerting sometimes violent control over the milquetoast Daryl Hall, is clearly different from reality, in which Hall is the main lead vocalist and songwriter with no hint of a rivalry. Christopher Cross, played by Justin Roiland, is depicted as a wide-eyed, timid hayseed whose song \\"Sailing\\" is lauded as the \\"smoothest song ever.\\" Loggins' former partner Jim Messina is a bitter wino who hates Loggins for his success and perceived betrayal. Michael Jackson is depicted as a hard-rock enthusiast who believes his partnership with guitarist Eddie Van Halen will lead to an endless parade of female sexual conquests. Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, the Doobie Brothers' lead guitarist, is seen threatening to kick McDonald \\"out of the Doobies\\" if he doesn't write them another hit. (The real Baxter did bring fellow Steely Dan alumnus McDonald into the band but, as they achieved their greatest commercial success, Baxter left the Doobie Brothers because of his displeasure with their new commercial sound and attitude.) The Eagles (portrayed here as jock-like meatheads) and Steely Dan (portrayed as snarky nerds, with Donald Fagen speaking in an incoherent babble of scat that only the truly smooth can understand) really did insert lyrical references to each other in their music as depicted in the show, but these were actually friendly in nature, not part of a longtime grudge involving baseball bats and lunch- money shakedowns. Reception John Oates credited Yacht Rock in 2007 with rekindling interest in Hall & Oates and lowering the demographic age of the group's fans saying: Michael McDonald commented on Yacht Rock in a 2008 interview: In 2015 SiriusXM broadcast a limited-time \\"Yacht Rock Radio\\" channel from August 21 - September 22. It returned on June 20, 2016, and again on June 21, 2017, while also maintaining a year-round dedicated Yacht Rock channel for the ever-increasing fan base.  Beyond Yacht Rock  In 2016, Ryznar, Huey, Stair, and Lyons began a podcast called Beyond Yacht Rock. This series revolves around top-ten countdowns of genres they have newly invented, as well as episodes built around analyses of the work of musicians such as Steve Perry and Van Halen.When the Guys Behind ‘Yacht Rock’ Took Aim at the Humiliating Practice of White Musicians’ ‘Try-N-Raps’. Vulture, February 29, 2016. The series also includes more commentary on the yacht rock style, such as evaluating songs according to whether or not they fit the Yacht Rock creators' description of the style (which they call \\"Yacht or Nyacht\\").That '70s Week: Yacht Rock.

The intro of \\"Peg\\" by Steely Dan is played at the outset of the episode. # \\"I'm Alright\\" #: As everyone grieves Koko's death, Loggins lashes out at McDonald and \\"smooth music\\" as a whole, causing a rift between the two. Sleazy entertainment executive Gene Balboa, who is producing the movie Caddyshack, demands that the movie's director, Harold Ramis, obtain Loggins' talents to write the movie's theme song. Ramis takes advantage of an angry and confused Loggins and gets him to write and record the hard rock song \\"I'm Alright\\", much to McDonald's dismay. #: Featured songs: \\"Time Out of Mind\\" by Steely Dan; \\"Keep the Fire\\" by Kenny Loggins; \\"How do the Fools Survive\\" by The Doobie Brothers; \\"Lights\\" and \\"Any Way You Want It\\" by Journey; \\"Kid Charlemagne\\" by Steely Dan; \\"I'm Alright\\" by Kenny Loggins. # \\"Rosanna\\" #: Steve Porcaro (Steve Agee), the keyboard player of the band Toto, is asked by his girlfriend, Rosanna Arquette (Morgan Murphy), to write a song about her, and she wants Michael McDonald to sing on the track.

Baxter suggests seeing Koko about it, and Templeman starts seeing his dream become real as he meets a young McDonald, then a background singer for Steely Dan, being talked into joining the Doobie Brothers by Steely Dan and Koko, Loggins showing signs of his imminent break from Messina and solo stardom, and an effeminate Hall and Oates with a very familiar looking manager named Gino, who tries to bully McDonald and Loggins into employing him as a manager.

Loggins, on the other hand, has grown to love doing movie soundtracks and his career is still in high gear. Extraterrestrial/composer Giorgio Moroder is sent to Earth to seek Loggins' assistance in fighting a black hole that will destroy Moroder's planet. Fearing for his friend's life, McDonald tries to rescue him, and in the process, finds his relevance.

Early life Lindsey was born in Middlewich, Cheshire, the son of Robert Lindsey, a mercer, and godson of Theophilus Hastings, 9th Earl of Huntingdon, for whose mother his mother had been a servant. He was educated at the Leeds Free School and at St John's College, University of Cambridge, where in 1747 he became a fellow. Ordained deacon in 1746 and priest in 1747, Lindsey's church career advanced by aristocratic patronage. For some time he was a curate in Spitalfields, London, a position found for him by Lady Ann Hastings, aunt to the 9th Earl. The nomination was by Granville Wheler, Lady Ann's brother-in-law. Lindsey was domestic chaplain to Algernon Seymour, 7th Duke of Somerset, who died in 1750. Then he was employed as tutor to the Duke's young grandson, Lord Warkworth—Hugh Percy, originally Hugh Smithson, the future 2nd Duke of Northumberland—from 1751 to 1753 travelling on the continent of Europe. Warkworth was destined for Eton College, and Lindsey turned down the post of accompanying him there which went to Charles Dodgson. Parish priest Lindsey was then presented to the living of Kirkby Wiske in Yorkshire, by Hugh Percy, 1st Duke of Northumberland. He was present there in 1753–4. After exchanging it for that of Piddletown in Dorset, in the gift of Francis Hastings, 10th Earl of Huntingdon, he rejected a chance to go to Dublin with the Duke of Northumberland, who became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1762. At Piddleton he came to know Thomas Hollis of Corscombe, and through him William Harris, both dissenters. In 1760, he married Hannah Elsworth, step-daughter of Francis Blackburne, whom he had known since his time at Kirby Wiske. Vicar of Catterick 15th century font in the Church of St Anne, Catterick In 1763 Lindsey went to the Church of St Anne, Catterick in North Yorkshire. He owed the living, in the gift of the Crown, to the influence of the Earl of Huntingdon. According to Catharine Harrison, daughter of Jeremiah Harrison who had been the previous vicar, the wishes of Hannah Lindsey to be closer to her Blackburne relations had much to do with the move. The parish had at around this time about 400 households, and a local Catholic gentry family, represented by Sir Henry Lawson, 4th Baronet at Brough Hall. Lindsey was wary of Catholic influence. There was some Methodist belief, but hardly any dissenting nonconformity. Around 1764 Lindsey founded a Sunday school. Hannah ran a dispensary and encouraged inoculation. Entertaining anti-Trinitarian views, Lindsey was troubled by their inconsistency with Anglican belief. On Lindsey's own account, he was influenced by William Robertson and his Attempt to explain the words reason, substance, person, creeds, orthodoxy, Catholic- church, subscription, and Index expurgatorius of 1766, with letter to his diocesan bishop from 1760 in the later editions. From 1769 the close friendship of Joseph Priestley served to foster Lindsey's scruples. Lindsey was writing to him in Leeds by 1772. The Feathers Tavern Petition In 1771 Lindsey joined with Blackburne, John Jebb (1736–1786), Christopher Wyvill (1740–1822) and Edmund Law (1703–1787), bishop of Carlisle, in preparing a petition to Parliament. This petition, now called the Feathers Tavern Petition, prayed that clergymen of the Church of England and graduates of the universities might be relieved from the burden of subscribing to the Thirty- Nine Articles, and \\"restored to their undoubted rights as Protestants of interpreting Scripture for themselves\\". Two hundred and fifty signatures were obtained, but in February 1772 the House of Commons declined even to receive the petition by a majority of 217 to 71; the adverse vote was repeated in the following year. At the end of 1773, Lindsey resigned as vicar of the Church of England. He became instead a leading Unitarian. Later life Self murder or the wolf tried and convicted on his own evidence (1791), a print by Isaac Cruikshank, depicting Joseph Priestley as a wolf in sheep's clothing and Lindsey with a serpent's body On the way from Catterick to London, Lindsey and his wife stayed with William Turner in Wakefield, a minister whose beliefs had become Unitarian. His advice to Lindsey was to become likewise a dissenting minister. Alexander Gordon writing in the Dictionary of National Biography commented that Turner disapproved of Lindsey's idea of leading a secession from the Church of England. In April 1774 Lindsey began to conduct Unitarian services in a room in Essex Street, the Strand, London, where Essex Street Chapel was built. Among the trustees was Samuel Heywood. Here Lindsey remained till 1793 when he resigned his charge in favour of John Disney, who like himself had left the established church and had become his colleague. Lindsey helped to spread Unitarianism to Wales through his correspondence with Tomos Glyn Cothi. Later the Unitarian offices, first the British and Foreign Unitarian Association and then the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, were established in Essex Street. Tomb of Theophilus Lindsey (d. 1808), Elizabeth Rayner (d. 1800) and Thomas Belsham (d. 1829) in Bunhill Fields burial ground In 1800 he received a considerable bequest from Elizabeth Rayner, a wealthy member of his congregation, and as a result his final years were spent in comfort. He died at home in Essex Street on 3 November 1808, and was buried in Bunhill Fields burial ground. By the request of Elizabeth Rayner, who had died in 1800, her remains were placed in the same grave. Lindsey was succeeded as minister at Essex Street from 1805 by Thomas Belsham, who wrote Lindsey's biography (published in 1812), and who, following his own death in 1829, was also buried in the same grave. Works Lindsey's major work was An Historical View of the State of the Unitarian Doctrine and Worship from the Reformation to our own Times (1783). It was written in response to the Plea for the Divinity of Christ of the Baptist minister Robert Robinson. There was a 1785 reply to it, arguing against Lindsey's use of Abraham Tucker's views on the Trinity, by Thomas Kynaston as \\"A Layman\\", on behalf of Tucker's daughter. Lindsey's other publications included: *The Apology of Theophilus Lindsey: on Resigning the Vicarage of Catterick (1774). Lindsey cited in this work John Oldfield, an ejected minister of the 17th century. A reply of the same year, A Vindication of the Doctrine and Liturgy of the Church of England, came from George Bingham, with criticism of Lindsey's history of the early Church as Socinian. The layman William Burgh replied also in 1774 on the divinity of Christ, with A scriptural confutation of the arguments against the one Godhead of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost produced by the Rev. Mr Lindsay. *A Sequel to the Apology (1776). It includes an account of the trial of Edward Elwall. *The Book of Common Prayer, reformed according to the plan of the late Dr Samuel Clarke (1774). Samuel Clarke (1675–1729), a cleric and philosopher with views close to those of Isaac Newton, left manuscript comments on the Book of Common Prayer that were given by his son to the British Museum, in 1768. Lindsey returned several times to revisions of this prayer book, for the Essex Street Chapel, after John Disney had copied out the comments. By 1789 he removed the Apostles' Creed. His work influenced also Presbyterians, who published five liturgies based on it in the years 1776 to 1791. *Dissertations on the Preface to St John's Gospel and on praying to Jesus Christ (1779) *Vindiciae Priestleianae (1788), defending Joseph Priestley against George Horne, and asserting the continuity of Unitarianism with the latitudinarian tradition within the Church of England in general, and John Tillotson in particular. *Conversations upon Christian Idolatry (1792) *Conversations on the Divine Government, shewing that everything is from God, and for good, to all (1802). Two volumes of sermons, with prayers annexed, were published posthumously in 1810. Thomas Belsham's Memoirs of the Late Reverend Theophilus Lindsey, M.A., including a brief analysis of his works; together with anecdotes and letters of eminent persons, his friends and correspondents; also a general view of the progress of the Unitarian doctrine in England and America appeared in 1812. Family In 1760 Lindsey married Hannah Elsworth (1740–1812), stepdaughter of Francis Blackburne.

Colin Blackburn, Baron Blackburn, (18 May 1813 – 8 January 1896) was a Scottish judge who sat in the English courts, became a Law Lord and is remembered as one of the greatest exponents of the common law. Life He was the second son of John Blackburn of Killearn, Stirlingshire, and Rebecca, daughter of the Rev. Colin Gillies. He was born on 18 May 1813. His elder brother, Peter Blackburn, represented Stirlingshire in the conservative interest in the parliament of 1859–65. His younger brother was the mathematician Hugh Blackburn. The future judge was educated at the Edinburgh Academy, Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, in which university he graduated B.A. (eighth wrangler) in 1835, and proceeded M.A. in 1838. In 1870, he received the honorary degree of LL.D. from the University of Edinburgh. Admitted on 20 April 1835, student at Lincoln's Inn, he migrated thence to the Inner Temple, where he was called to the bar on 23 November 1838, and elected honorary bencher on 13 April 1877. For some years after his call, he went the northern circuit in a briefless or almost briefless condition. He had no professional connection, no turn for politics, no political interest, none of the advantages of person and address which make for success in advocacy, and though his well-earned repute as a legal author led to his occasional employment in weighty mercantile cases, he was still a stuff gownsman, and better known in the courts as a reporter than as a pleader, when on the transference of Sir William Erle from the Queen's Bench to the chief- justiceship of the common pleas, Lord Campbell startled the profession by selecting him for the vacant puisne judgeship. He was appointed justice on 27 June 1859, and on 2 November following, was invested with the coif. He was knighted on 24 April 1860. The surprise with which his advancement was received was proved by the event to have been singularly ill-founded. Judge It was soon apparent that the new puisne judge possessed in an eminent degree all the essential qualities of the judicial mind. To a logical faculty, naturally acute and improved by severe discipline, he added a depth of learning, a breadth of view, a sobriety of judgment, and an inexhaustible patience, which made his decisions as nearly as possible infallible. Few causes célèbres came before him during his seventeen-year tenure of office as judge of first instance, but the dignity and impartiality with which he presided at the trial (28 October 1867) of the Manchester Fenians were worthy of a more august occasion, and his charge to the grand jury of Middlesex (2 June 1868) on the bill of indictment against the late governor of Jamaica, Edward John Eyre, though not perhaps altogether unexceptionable, is, on the whole, a sound, weighty, and vigorous exposition of the principles applicable to the determination of a question of great delicacy and the gravest imperial consequence. Only once was his judicial ability seriously questioned: this was an attack on him in an extraordinary letter to The Times in 1877 by the bitter-tongued Irish judge Jonathan Christian, who chose to treat Blackburn's reversal of one of his judgments O'Rorke v Bolingbroke (1877) 2 App Cas 814as a personal affront. Christian was notorious for quarreling with his Irish colleagues, and thought poorly of the ability of even the most distinguished of them (notably Lord O'Hagan, who sat with Blackburn on the appeal and joined with him in reversing Christian's decision) so his attack on Blackburn need not be taken seriously (it has been suggested that O'Hagan was the real target of his indignation). The consolidation of the courts effected by the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 gave Blackburn the status of justice of the high court, which numbered among its members no judge of more tried ability when the Appellate Jurisdiction Act of 1876 authorised the reinforcement of the House of Lords by the creation of two judicial life peers, designated 'lords of appeal in ordinary.' Blackburn's investiture with the new dignity met accordingly with universal approbation. He was raised to the life peerage on 10 October 1876, by the title of Baron Blackburn, of Killearn in the County of Stirlingshire, and took his seat in the House of Lords and was sworn of the privy council in the following month (21, 28 November) In the part which he thenceforth took in the administration of our imperial jurisprudence, Blackburn acquitted himself with an ability so consummate as to cause his retirement in December 1886 to be felt as an almost irreparable loss. The regret was intensified by the discovery of a curious flaw in the Appellate Jurisdiction Act, by which his resignation of office carried with it his exclusion from the House of Lords. This anomaly was, however, removed by an amending act. He died, unmarried, at his country seat, Doonholm, Ayrshire, on 8 January 1896. Career Blackburn was a member of the royal commissions on the courts of law (1867) and the stock exchange (1877), and presided over the royal commission on the draft criminal code (1878). He was author of a masterly Treatise on the Effect of the Contract of Sale on the Legal Rights of Property and Possession in Goods. Wares, and Merchandise, London, 1845, 8vo, which held its own as the standard text-book on the subject until displaced by the more comprehensive work of Benjamin. A new edition, revised by J. C. Graham, appeared in 1885. As a reporter Blackburn collaborated with Thomas Flower Ellis. Though greatly respected he does not seem to have been popular; according to a well-known story he informed a colleague that he intended to retire in vacation to avoid the trouble of a retirement dinner — the colleague cheerfully replied that this was quite unnecessary since no-one would have turned up to the dinner anyway.Sir John Hollam Jottings of an Old Solicitor London 1906 He was the author of a valuable work on the Law of Sales.'The Times, 10 January 1896; E Manson, Builders of our Law (1904).

It became a military base of the Russian army during the siege of Kazan (1552). Since the 18th century, Sviyazhsk served as a center of an uyezd. In 1920–1927, it was a center of Sviyazhsky Kanton; in 1927–1931—the administrative center of Sviyazhsky District. In 1932, it was demoted to rural status. There is a school and a club in Sviyazhsk, as well as a monastery associated with the name of Macarius of Unzha. Sviyazhsk railway station is located west of the island and is linked with Sviyazhsk proper by a highway running along a causeway. Another way to get there is by a boat from the port of Kazan.

He is an invested Officer of the Order of Canada and recipient of the RAIC Gold Medal. He is Board Chair of the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal. Life Born in Hamilton, Ontario in 1949, Bruce Kuwabara studied architecture at the University of Toronto and graduated in 1972. Upon graduation, Kuwabara joined the teaching studio of George Baird, an architect and architectural theorist. Baird was influential to Kuwabara's interest in ideas of city building and the narrative concept of architecture. It was in Baird's studio that Kuwabara also encountered many of the most influential architects of the time, including James Stirling, Arata Isozaki, and Leon Krier. Following the apprenticeship with Baird, Kuwabara joined Barton Myers Associates where he was an associate for 12 years. Barton Myers, who studied under the leading American architect, Louis Kahn (1901-1974), inspired Kuwabara, and his future partners who were also associates of BMA – Thomas Payne, Marianne McKenna and Shirley Blumberg - to think about the city, and how to integrate strategies of urban infill and consolidation. Honours In 2011, Kuwabara was made an Officer of the Order of Canada \\"for his contributions, as an architect, to our built landscape and for his commitment to professional excellence\\". He is the recipient of the RAIC 2006 Gold Medal. The medal recognizes Kuwabara's contribution to the profession of architecture and is Canada's highest honour bestowed by the profession on an individual. In his acceptance speech, Kuwabara offered a personal reflection contrasting the memories of growing up in the post-World War II climate as a Japanese-Canadian with the later inspirations of his mentors and seminal events that determined his vocation as an architect. His reflections of the collaborative nature of architecture and an overview of his practice is featured in a special supplement published by Canadian Architect in the June 2006 issue, with essays by George Baird and Larry Richards who wrote: \\"From his collaborative contributions on large urban projects with Barton Myers in the 1970s to his conceptions for complex city fabric insertions during the past decade…, Kuwabara has demonstrated remarkable leadership as an accomplished architect- urbanist with a very particular sense of the design and health of cities.\\" Bruce was elected into the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 2005. Sustainable design Long before the environment was considered a priority issue in Canada, Kuwabara was studying and prioritizing strategies for integrating sustainability with architectural design. His involvement as the design principal for the Canadian Embassy in Berlin (joint venture of KPMB with Gagnon Letellier Cyr Architectes, and Smith Carter Architects + Engineers) presented the opportunity to study and integrate international strategies for reducing energy consumption and developing a healthy, sustainable work environment. These lessons would greatly influence future projects in Canada, particularly Manitoba Hydro Place in downtown Winnipeg. Manitoba Hydro Place is one of the most energy efficient large-scale office towers in the world and establish a model for extreme climate design in Canada and internationally. This project is the product of a collaboration with Transsolar and Smith Carter Architects + Engineers. The project was realized through a formal C-2000 Integrated Design Process (IDP) to achieve 60% reduction in energy consumption with a signature design and catalyze the urban revitalization of the downtown. The building exceeded original goals for LEED Gold and was certified LEED Platinum in 2012. Architecture and education Kuwabara and KPMB have supported the John H. Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape and Design, at the University of Toronto as well as contributed to its curriculum. Specifically, Kuwabara helped to establish the Frank Gehry Chair for International Visitors in Architectural Design, as well as to the Faculty's ongoing building renovations. As co-chair of the University's Design the Future campaign, Kuwabara played a key role in spearheading funding for the Gehry Chair. In recognition of his contribution, he was presented with the Arbor Award for \\"outstanding personal service to the University of Toronto and its divisions.\\" Selected work Selected work (with KPMB) includes: 2019: Science Commons / Science & Academic Building, University of Lethbridge (with Stantec Architecture) 2018: Ronald O.

It is one of the main sources of replenishment for Windermere, and is part of the Leven catchment. Its name comes from Old Norse and appears in documents from 1292 as Trutebyk. The river rises between the peaks of Stony Cove Pike and Thornthwaite Crag in the High Street range, at a height of about 1,970 feet (600 m). Several tributaries flowing from the crags to the west of the High Street Roman road combine to form the young Trout Beck. The river descends rapidly, more or less in a southerly direction, through Troutbeck Park and to the west of Troutbeck Tongue. At a height of about 650 feet (200 m) the Woundale Beck, draining the eastern flanks of Broad End and Pike How, is subsumed. The engorged Trout Beck then skirts Hird Wood on its eastern side before subsuming Hagg Gill at the 460 feet (140 m) contour. This latter tributary drains the fells around the course of the old Roman road. The river passes under Ing Bridge as it continues in a southerly direction down the Troutbeck valley through the tranquil fields of the valley bottom. The hamlets of Town Head and High Green are just to the west of the river as it enters Limefitt Park. On emerging from Limefitt the river is bridged by the A592 Kirkstone Pass road. Troutbeck village lies on the west side of the valley. Continuing through a narrow area of mixed woodland the river eventually reaches the A591 road at Troutbeck Bridge near the town of Windermere. After less than a mile (2 km) the river enters Windermere on its eastern shore at a point close to Calgarth Hall. From its source the Trout Beck descends some 1,840 feet (560 m) in a distance of about seven miles (11 km). The river is a trout fishery where brown trout can be caught. Anglers should enquire locally about licences (an Environment Agency Rod Licence is required). The Trout Beck is wholly within the historic county of Westmorland, and since 1974, has also been in the administrative county of Cumbria.

It should not be confused with present-day Shamokin, Pennsylvania, located to the east. Early in the eighteenth century, the village consisted of Iroquois migrants from the north, as well as Shawnee and Lenape settlers moving away from the expanding white settlement of Pennsylvania and Saponi and Tutelo from Virginia. The date of first human settlement of is not known. However, historian C. A. Weslager indicates that it was probably Shawnee migrants who first settled there.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 192. A large population of Delaware Indians was also forcibly resettled there in the early 18th century after they lost rights to their land in the Walking Purchase. Canasatego of the Six Nations, enforcing the Walking Purchase of behalf of George Thomas, Deputy Governor of Pennsylvania, ordered the Delaware Indians to go to two places on the Susquehanna River, one of which was Shamokin.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 192. From 1727 to 1756, Shamokin was one of the largest and most influential Indian settlements in Pennsylvania.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 192. In 1745, Presbyterian missionary David Brainerd described the city as being located on both the east and west sides of the river, and on an island, as well. Brainerd reported that the city housed 300 Indians, half of which were Delawares and the other Seneca and Tutelo.Rev. John Edwards, ed., Memoirs of the Rev. David Brainerd, New Haven, 1822, p. 233. In 1754, much of the land west of the Susquehanna was transferred from the Six Nations to Pennsylvania at the Albany Congress. However, Shamokin was not sold and was reserved by the Six Nations, \\"to settle such of our Nations as shall come to us from the Ohio or any others who shall deserve to be in our Alliance.\\"Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 215. According to Weslager, \\"the Pennsylvania authorities had no opposition to the Six Nations reserving Wyoming and Shamokin from the sale, since friendly Delawares, including Teedyuskung (also known as Teedyuscung) and his people living in those settlements--and any other Indians who might be placed there-- constituted a buffer against Connecticut.\\"Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 215. The French and Indian War brought fighting to much of the region. The Delaware Indian residents of Shamokin remained neutral for much of the early part of the war, in part because a drought and unseasonable frost in Shamokin in 1755 left them without provisions.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History. Rutgers University Press: News Brunswick, p. 225-227. However, the Delaware Indians at Shamokin joined the war against Pennsylvania and the English after the Gnadenhutten massacre in 1755.Weslager, C. A. (1972). The Delaware Indians: A History.

Young Israel was founded in 1912, in its earliest form, by a group of 15 young Jews on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Their goal was to make Orthodox Judaism more relevant to young Americanized Jews at a time when a significant Jewish education was rare, and most Orthodox institutions were Yiddish-speaking and oriented to an older, European Jewish demographic. Today, Young Israel continues to promote Orthodox involvement of modern American Jews, while also advocating for the issues most relevant to its members, including support for Israel and Religious Zionism, and Jewish prisoner support. History Early in the 20th century, American Jews were striving primarily for social and economic advancement, often leaving their religious observances behind. Because most jobs required working on Saturdays, observance of the Jewish Sabbath was rare, as were many other traditions.Young Israel:About Us Accessed December 5, 2007. At the same time, the Reform movement had been expanding rapidly for about 40 years, and with its relaxed religious codes, secularly-educated leadership, and English orientation, attracted an increasing number of young people away from the folds of Orthodoxy. A group of young Orthodox Jews decided to do what they could to make Orthodox Judaism more relevant to their peers, and combat the wave of assimilation by Jews into Reform and secular American society. It developed informally with two programs, one for education and one for worship. =Seminars= The group developed a Friday night (Sabbath) lecture series in 1912, given in English. This was a major innovation in the Orthodox world. They were initially advised by rabbis Israel Friedlander and Mordecai Kaplan on topics and speakers.For Kaplan and Friedlander founding Young Israel, see: *S. Daniel Breslauer (1994).

(2007), Encyclopaedia Judaica, Volume 21, Macmillan Reference USA in association with the Keter Publishing House. p. 402. Friedlander and Kaplan were affiliates of the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary and the Conservative Judaism movement, and they sought to use Young Israel to establish a youth platform for the Conservative movement; until the end of World War I, Young Israel had two groups, the firmly Orthodox, and the more liberal group that worked with the Conservatives. =Synagogues= The first Young Israel synagogue was established in 1913 on East Broadway, on Manhattan's Lower East Side. David Warshaw traces the origins of the new synagogue to the summer of 1913, when some members of the YI seminar group were asked into a storefront shul at 205 East Broadway, to complete a minyan. Much to their delight, the shul allowed the new young members to lead services at least once each month.Kaufman, David. Shul with a Pool: The \\"synagogue- center\\" in American Jewish History, Brandeis University Press, University Press of New England, 1999, , pp. 202–203. As they led the services, the Young Israel members introduced some small stylistic changes, that were acceptable to the Orthodox wing and would make the service more palatable to the Young Israel congregants. The changes included singing many parts of the prayer service, and the distribution of worship honors equally, where they had traditionally gone to established, wealthy congregants who could pay for them. Though the shul predated its Young Israel members, within months, they had attracted so many new young members, that they outgrew the store and moved to the Educational Alliance building. The young people had taken over the shul, itself a novel experience. However, it was not directly linked to the Young Israel lecture series, only sharing a common group of leaders, and the common idea of refreshing Orthodoxy for younger Jews. Recognizing its potential for young Jews everywhere, they named themselves \\"The Model Synagogue Organization.\\" However, they recognized the synergy with the forums, and renamed the shul Young Israel. The first name of the shul was prescient. Young Jews in other neighborhoods were soon starting their own Young Israel shuls. However, each was independent, with only informal connections to the original group. =Centralization and Orthodoxy= By the end of World War I, the two Lower East Side groups shared a name, but little else. The Conservative group promoted the seminars, and the Orthodox group was focused on prayer. They reached a truce in 1918 and agreed to join forces in more than just name, and created a single Young Israel organization, led by Irving Bunim, who would be president of NCYI for many years. By 1920, Bunim and his Orthodox cohort grew nervous about the Conservative wing and their increasing theological changes. They did not like the changes in and of themselves, and these changes also prevented recognition of Young Israel by Orthodox rabbis, which would likely cause Young Israel to become a de facto branch of the Conservative movement. The merger created two years before had also caused the Conservatives to start trying to make changes in the Synagogue arm, which had been exclusively Orthodox. He sought the help of Rabbi Bernard Revel, and was able to convince the entire Young Israel to follow Revel's advice. Between Revel, and extensive networking by Bunim with other potential Young Israel leaders in the Orthodox community, the Conservative rabbis, particularly Kaplan, were shut out of the entire organization, and the movement became firmly Orthodox. To bolster this success, in 1922 the Orthodox leaders added some basic Orthodox-oriented requirements to the Young Israel charter, such as synagogue requirements for regularly-held services, Torah study, separation of men and women. In 1924, the central group organized a convention for all the other groups that had emulated them (by setting up their own original Young Israel lectures and shuls). The other neighborhood groups agreed to abide by the charter. By 1926, the organization was incorporated, and owned the trademarked name, Young Israel. Any new shuls wishing to use the name would have to get agreement from the central organization, which required subscription to the charter. This prevented any Young Israel shul from moving toward Conservative practice. =Growth= By 1925, Young Israel was extending into social services, and formed a support agency for Sabbath-observant employment that included job placement and vocational training. Later in the decade, the synagogue network grew to about 25. The central organization developed a Wall Street office with a full-time staff. The office began publishing material regularly for branches and Young Israel members. A few years later, branches starting opening outside of New York. By 1935, there were branches in New York, New England, Chicago, and elsewhere in the Midwest, Canada, and Israel. 3 West 16th Street NCYI is a not-for-profit service organization, as defined by their 501(c)(3) status. The main headquarters, having been located at 3 West 16 street for over half a century, is now located in Paramus, NJ. Through 2006, NCYI headquarters was at 3 West 16th Street, a valuable property that it owned. Young Israel of Fifth Avenue leased its synagogue in the same building from NCYI. When NCYI sought to sell the building in 2002, the synagogue sued for breach of their long-standing arrangement, as the sale would require their eviction. The synagogue claimed that they were co-owners of the building. Eventually, a deal was made involving two other parties, the building sold, and NCYI moved its small staff to leased office space in lower Manhattan. However, the other two parties eventually had a falling-out, leading to the synagogue's eviction.Wakin, Daniel J. \\"A House Divided, and for Sale; Real Estate Splits Jewish Group and Synagogue\\", The New York Times, June 20, 2003.

The organization had been subject to an investigation by then-New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer's Charities Bureau. According to The Forward: \\"New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, renowned for his jousts with the titans of corporate America, recently saw his own office tied in knots and thrown into turmoil during a three-year investigation into a small Orthodox synagogue organization.\\" Today In July 2013, Rabbi Perry Tirschwell assumed the position of Executive Director. The new administration has made significant changes in the organization: moving the national office out of Manhattan, putting Viewpoint [magazine] on hold; and creation of two monthly publications whose goal is to share best practices: Shul Solutions and Practical Pulpit. NCYI serves as the national coordinating agency for nearly 150 Orthodox congregations of nearly 25,000 member families throughout the United States and Canada. NCYI also serves as a resource to its sister organization in Israel, entitled Yisrael Hatzair - \\"The Young Israel Movement in Israel\\", encompassing over 50 synagogues in Israel. It is a grassroots organization administrated on the congregational model, taking its direction from local and national lay leadership as well as rabbis and professional staff. Its socio-cultural outlook is strongly influenced by the Religious Zionist Movement, with strong support of Israel as the homeland for the Jewish people. Congregations belonging to NCYI are generally named \\"Young Israel of...\\", followed by the name of the city or neighborhood. In recent decades, the Orthodox world has seen an increase in women's involvement in synagogue services, except for Haredi institutions. The practice has spread to several Young Israel branches. It is controversial in the Orthodox world, and most rabbis do not allow it. On advice of its rabbinical board, to help stanch the trend, NCYI implemented the Rambam's requirementHilchot Melachim, 1:5 that no women or converts to Judaism could serve as President of any of its synagogues.Leaking Ship: Young Israel on the Rocks Yeshiva University Commentator December 3, 2007 This has alienated some Young Israels. According to the Jewish Star, the rabbi of a synagogue with a female president was threatened by NCYI's leadership. Young Israel Council of Rabbis The Young Israel Council of Rabbis is the rabbinic arm of the organization. Divisions The main divisions are Synagogue Services, Rabbinical Services, and a Benevolent Association (burial society). Additional components of the organization are the Women's League, the InterCollegiate Council (ICC), Youth departmentfocus: synagogue youth programs, American Friends of Yisrael Hatzair, and the Council of Rabbis. There are also departments with a focus on seniors, singles and an employment departments.the latter originated in the days of 'if you don't come in Saturday, don't come in Monday' Controversy A 2018 statement issued by the head of a major internal committee regarding juggling of political alignments in the administration of Israel's Prime Minister led, after various Tweets and press releases, to the breakaway of an Atlanta-based branch that had joined NCYI in 1994. NCYI's president acknowledged that another branch had left the organization five years prior. Well-known branches =Young Israel of Brookline= Young Israel of Brookline is located in Brookline, Massachusetts. The Boston Globe described it as, \\"an influential synagogue described as modern or centrist Orthodox.\\".US Jews Resent Bid To limit Legitimacy (James L. Franklin, Boston Globe, December 17, 1988). It is known for the high level of Jewish scholarship among both the men and women of the congregation.Living Their Faith: Modern Orthodox Jews are blending best of both worlds.

Rabbi Saul Berman is a former rabbi of the Young Israel. The current rabbi is Rabbi David Hellman. =Young Israel of Fifth Avenue= In 1945, when NCYI bought its headquarters building on West 16th Street, it also fostered the development of new branch synagogue on site, The Young Israel of Fifth Avenue. This became a point of contention over 50 years later, when NCYI sold the building. Eventually, due to this rift, the synagogue disaffiliated with Young Israel, and is now known as the Sixteenth Street Synagogue. As of 2013, it does not have its own quarters, and other area synagogues host prayer services that 16th Street members attend. =Young Israel of Flatbush= This was one of the earliest branches, and the affiliate that then-president Irving Bunim chose as the leader, in the 1930s, for instituting rabbinic leadership of Young Israel synagogues. At the time, it was one of the larger shuls, and was initially against getting a rabbi. By winning over such a prominent dissenter, Bunim succeeded in setting a trend for all branches, and Rabbi Solomon Sharfman became the first rabbi. Young Israel Beth-El of Boro Park =Young Israel Beth-El of Boro Park= The Young Israel of Boro Park was established well before World War II.Cover of Siyum, 1943: \\"Young Israel will hold an open house Saturday night for all intermediates at the Young Israel of Boro Park\\" In the 1980s it merged with Congregation Beth El of Borough Park, which was founded in August, 1902.

A hurricane was first observed near Tobago on August 1 before continuing through the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico by August 6. It crossed over Florida, and when it reached the western Atlantic, it paralleled the coastlines of Georgia and South Carolina. It moved inland over southern North Carolina, and brought heavy rain to the Norfolk, Virginia area, delaying mail delivery and causing flooding through the mid-Atlantic as it moved northward into Pennsylvania by August 9. Its track appears similar to that of Hurricane Charley of August 2004. II. Barbados and Saint Lucia were struck by a hurricane on October 21, causing 250 deaths as it moved through the Lesser Antilles. The hurricane subsequently moved into Nicaragua by October 26. 1818 Atlantic hurricane season I. A hurricane passed through the central Atlantic east of Bermuda to south and east of the Azores between August 26 and September 5. It reportedly silted at Hamilton Harbor on Bermuda.

The hurricane intensified to a Category 2–3 before hitting Galveston, Texas on September 12 and continuing onward to Mississippi. The hurricane was \\"quite severe\\", destroying all but six houses on Galveston Island. III. A tropical cyclone seriously affected Puerto Rico on 22 September. It possibly recurved sharply offshore the Eastern Seaboard; the frigate Macedonian encountered a hurricane on 26/27 September east-northeast of Bermuda. The breeze freshened that afternoon as the ship lay near 35.6N 55.7W. By sunset, waves increased to , and southeast gales lashed the system after midnight on the 27 September. Winds continued to increase into that afternoon, as seas increased to . One man fell overboard by 5 pm and drowned. The hurricane reached its full violence by 10 pm, splitting the storm staysails and making the rigging useless. The main mast cracked under the strain by 2 am on the 28 September, and the mizzenmast followed suit by 4 am. Seawater poured into the ship from all sides, as the wooden hull twisted under the force of the waves. The ship finally cleared the storm without capsizing by noon, and her crew again saw sunset on the evening of 29 September.James Tertius de Kay, 2000: Chronicles of the Frigate Macedonian 1809–1922.

Between November 6 and November 13, another hurricane moved across the southwest Caribbean Sea into Jamaica and Cuba. A hurricane struck Jamaica on 18–20 November. 1819 Atlantic hurricane season =Bay St. Louis Hurricane= The exact origin of this hurricane is unknown, but it likely formed off the coast of Cuba before heading on a west-northwest track towards the Gulf Coast. A small hurricane, it reached an estimated Category 3–4 strength before making landfall on July 27 in southeastern Louisiana, bringing heavy winds and a 5–6 ft storm surge. The hurricane continued northeastward, making a second landfall in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi before dissipating inland. Known as one of the most destructive hurricanes to affect the United States during the first half of the 19th century, the Bay St. Louis Hurricane caused severe damage across Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, leaving behind the remains of shattered buildings and uprooted trees. Several vessels (from small boats to 60-ton brigs) were driven ashore by the hurricane's storm surge. One of them was the capsizing of the U.S. warship USS Firebrand, drowning 39 sailors. Several U.S. soldiers were caught off guard by the hurricane and perished in its midst. There were also reports of people being attacked by alligators, snapping turtles, and snakes, which further added to the death toll. The hurricane caused over $100,000 dollars (1819 US dollars) in damage, and killed between 43 and 175 people, some of them later found washed up across the Gulf Coast. =Hurricane San Mateo= Between September 19 and September 26, hurricane San Mateo tracked through the northeast Lesser Antilles and southwest of Bermuda. During September 21 and September 22, this hurricane hit the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, causing heavy damage and loss of life. In Saint Tomas about 101 ships were sunk. In Puerto Rico it destroyed most of the houses in the towns and most of the crops in the fields. =Other systems= * A tropical storm hit between New Orleans and Apalachicola in September. * From October 13 to October 15, a hurricane passed through the Leeward Islands. * A hurricane is recorded to have struck Cuba on October 27 before moving onward to the Bahamas on October 28. In the aftermath of the 1815 Great Gale, the concept of a hurricane as a \\"moving vortex\\" was presented by John Farrar, Hollis Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at Harvard University in an 1819 paper.

Nevertheless, the Communist Youth published handbills against war and nazism and some of its members joined guerilla groups and fought against the Nazi regime. In 1945, the Free Austrian Youth (FÖJ) was founded by communists, socialists and Catholics to build up a free and democratic Austria. In 1970, the FÖJ broke up because of ideological conflicts and the Communist Youth was re-established.

Biography Born at Zamora, he was a page at the court of Philip II of Spain, training in Naples in 1557, aged 32 with Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, (1507–1582), Governor of the Duchy of Milan, 1555–1556, Viceroy of Naples, 1556–1557, Governor of the Habsburg Netherlands, Viceroy of Portugal, 1582–1584, He took part in the 1580 campaign in Portugal under the Duke of Alba and in 1582 was given supreme command over the Spanish troops. In 1589, as Captain General of Portugal, he successfully defended Lisbon against the attack by the English Armada, led by John Norreys and Francis Drake. Sent in 1591 by the king to the Netherlands, he assisted after the death of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, his successor Peter Ernst von Mansfeld and later Ernst of Austria, after whose death he became intermittent stateholder of the Netherlands. He conquered Doullens and Cambrai during the Franco-Spanish War (1595–1598). His excessive severity persuaded Philip II to exchange him for Albert of Austria. He was then made governor and Captain General of Milan, 1600–1610, dying in office aged 85, where he spread fear among the Italian nobility, especially the Venetians through his policies and use of the army. In 1599, he entered into a treaty with the Count of Savoy and assisted in the conspiracy of Biron. Under his rule a famous fortress, the Forte di Fuentes, where the river Adda meets Lake Como, still named after him and now ruined, was built to guard the border against the Grisons near Colico, LC. He died in office at Milan. He was married, 1585, aged 60, to Juana de Acevedo y Fonseca, who had been awarded the title by king Philip II of Spain in 1572, being thus suo jure 1st Countess of Fuentes de Valdepero, and during that marriage, he was therefore jure uxoris 1st Count of Fuentes. As he and his wife died childless, the title passed to one of her relatives, Manuel de Acevedo y Zúñiga, 6th Count of Monterrey, Ourense, Spain, Grandee of Spain by king Philip IV of Spain on 11 July 1628, Viceroy of Naples, 1631–1637.

Founded in the 1940s in Kenya, it is currently active in 39 countries and boasts well over 1500 branches.  History  Two volunteer members of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (Swayamsevaks) that had settled in Kenya in the 1940s and started a shakha (branch). Since such shakhas were not on 'national' (rashtriya) soil, they were renamed as the branches of Bharatiya Swayamsevak Sangh, later Hindu Swayamsevak Sangh (HSS). RSS Pracharaks Bhaurao Deoras and others spent several years abroad to develop the organisation. During the Emergency RSS was banned in India and, consequently, sent its organisers abroad to seek support and carry out activism. HSS in the United Kingdom was established in 1966, and shakhas were established in cities like Birmingham and Bradford. In North America, the HSS gave the lead to the sister organisation Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP, World Hindu Council), which was founded in Canada in 1970 and in the United States in 1971. The HSS followed in its wake.  Australia  The HSS organisation in Australia, as elsewhere, says that its focus is on the country in which it is based and that it does not send money to India. It claims to be \\"ideologically inspired by the RSS vision of a progressive and dynamic Hindu society that can deal with its internal and external challenges, and contribute to the welfare of the whole world\\". Aside from providing links to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), they also have links with organisations such as the Vishwa Hindu Parishad and the Hindu Youth Network. The professed aim is to raise awareness in matters relating to Hindus but support no specific political party or candidate.  Nepal  The HSS was established in Nepal around 1992 by a group of Nepali students who were influenced by leaders of the Hindu nationalist RSS while studying in India. The two bodies share a similar Hindutva ideology. Their presence is particularly prevalent in the Terai region and they have regimented programs of education, dissemination of ideology and exercise as elsewhere in the world. The Nepali HSS has been among several groups campaigning for a reversal of Nepal's 2006 decision to become a secular state after years of being ruled by a Hindu royal family. They say that the king had not favoured Hindus, that the decision was engineered by anti-Hindu groups, included communists and missionaries, and that in any event, it was unnecessary because there had been no persecution of religious minorities under the previous system. Among their demands has been that only Hindus should be appointed to high official posts.  United Kingdom  HSS in the United Kingdom was established in 1966. On 18th February 2015, the Charity Commission for England and Wales announced that it was opening an investigation into HSS and two other organisations that were featured in ITV's Exposure programme. The two other organisations claimed to serve Muslim and Sikh communities. Among the claims against the HSS made in the broadcast was that a visitor at a summer camp told children that \\"the number of good Muslims 'can be counted on one finger'\\" and that \\"to destroy Hindu history is the secret conspiracy of the Christians\\". After an investigation by the Charity Commission HSS was cleared of all charges and the allegations were withdrawn on 26th October 2017.  United States  In the US, the HSS registered as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit organisation in 1989. It has shakhas in every State, and has the largest network of branches outside of India. The US runs a family model, where the entire family attends weekly sessions to train, play and teach Hindu values.  Kenya  HSS Kenya was started in Nairobi on 14 January 1947 by Jagadish Chandra Shashtri with his colleagues. It was originally known as Bhartiya Swayamsevak Sangh. Since then it has spread throughout Kenya with Shakhas operational in Mombasa, Nakuru, Kisumu, Eldoret, and Meru. HSS in Kenya also runs a socio-cultural-religious organisation of Hindus by the name of Hindu Religious Service Centre (HRSC). It was started in Nairobi in 1947. It is involved in many social service activities and has contributed to the Kenyan society in many ways. HSS Kenya was one of the crucibles for the Hindu Council of Kenya, which later on became the main political organization for the defense of Hindus in Kenya.  Liberia  HSS Liberia was started in Monrovia on 29 October 2017. HSS Liberia, Starter 14 October 2017 HSS Liberia Sevika Shakha started separately on 16 December 2018  Presence elsewhere  The RSS announced in 2014 that there were plans to establish HSS chapters in countries such as Denmark, Finland, France, Italy, the Netherlands, and Norway. It claimed that the two organisations worked closely together and shared a similar ideology but were not as one.

Maglich built 4 models of Migma, devices producing fusion of deuterium atoms in colliding ion beams.  Education and academic work  Maglich received his Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Belgrade in 1951, his Master of Science degree from the University of Liverpool in 1955, and his Ph.D. in high-energy physics and nuclear engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959. Upon receiving his Ph.D., Maglich joined Dr. Louis Alvarez's research group at Lawrence Berkeley Lab. During this time, he, along with Fred Kirsten, invented the \\"sonic spark chamber\\", the first film-less spark chamber particle detector system. Maglich participated in the discovery of the omega meson, as described in Alvarez's Nobel Lecture: Between 1963-67, he worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in Geneva, Switzerland. While conducting research at CERN, he invented the \\"missing mass spectrometer\\". With this instrument, his team of French and Swiss physicists reported the discovery of seven mesons. In 1967, Maglich joined the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, as well as being visiting faculty at Princeton University. In 1969, he became Professor and Principal Investigator for High Energy Physics at Rutgers University. In 1974, he left academia to pursue his research in the private sector. Early work Maglich first rose to prominence in his field working on a team at the University of California's Lawrence Radiation Laboratory analyzing liquid hydrogen bubble chamber data from Berkeley's bevatron accelerator. The team, which also included Luis W. Alvarez, Dr. Arthur H Rosenfeld, and M.L. Stevenson, discovered the first solid experimental evidence for the existence of the ω meson resonance. (In 1968, Luis Alvarez was awarded a Nobel Prize for this and related work.) Maglich's contribution to this discovery led to him receiving the White House Citation from President John F. Kennedy and being named an honorary citizen in Switzerland by the President of the Swiss Confederation. Toward the end of the 1960s, R. Macek and Maglich proposed \\"The Principle of Self Colliding Orbits\\" and the precetron, a self-colliding particle beam accelerator originally proposed for studying pion-pion collisions.R. Macek and B. Maglich, \\"Precetron - a principle for optaining pion-pion and muon-muon collisions,\\" Proceedings of 7th International Conference on High-Energy Accelerators, Yerevan, USSR, 27 Aug - 2 Sep 1969, pp 194-220. Shortly thereafter, in the early 1970s, the precetron design formed the basis for Maglich's \\"migmatron\\" concept of a self- colliding ion beam fusion reactor. Business ventures In his attempts to raise funding for his migma research, Maglich has been associated with a string of business ventures. In 1974, he formed \\"MIGMA Institute of High Energy Fusion,\\" Fusion Energy Corp. From 1985-87, he was CEO and Principal Investigator of Aneutronic Energy Labs of United Sciences, Inc. at Princeton, a research firm also known as \\"AELabs.\\" It was during this time that Maglich worked under a research grant from the United States Air Force to attempt to develop his migmatron concept into a compact power source for spacecraft with Bechtel Corp. From 1988-93, he was CEO of Advanced Physics Corporation, chaired by Glenn T. Seaborg. In 1995, Maglich founded HiEnergy Microdevices, which later became HiEnergy Technologies, Inc., a developer and manufacturer of neutron-based bomb detection equipment based on his invention of \\"atometery\\". He continued to occupy various positions with that company until being terminated for cause. 16 months after Maglic's departure, HiEnergy Technologies declared bankruptcy in 2007.HiEnergy Technologies, Inc. Announces Decision to Seek Bankruptcy Protection to Address Financial and Operational Challenges After leaving HiEnergy Technologies, Maglich became the Chief Technology Officer of California Science & Engineering Corporation (CALSEC). Personal life The son of a lawyer and elected member of the Yugoslav Royal Parliament, Maglich (at age 13) and his mother were imprisoned in a Croatian Ustaše (Nazi-affiliated) concentration camp for Serbs, but managed to escape. Maglich has five children: Angelica (born 1989) and Aleksandra Maglich (born 1991), from a prior marriage to UCLA media artist Victoria Vesna; also Marko (born 1960), Ivanka (born 1961) and Roberta (born 1972).

A small forward, he only played in the NBA for one season, averaging 1.2 points and 0.7 rebounds in 31 games. He was selected by the Pistons in the second round (30th overall) of the 1988 NBA Draft. College career Dembo was barely recruited out of high school in San Antonio, Texas, but caught a break when he was sought out by Wyoming's then head coach Jim Brandenburg, who had previously been a high school coach in that city (and would later retire to San Antonio). Dembo's campus visit was the first time he had seen snow; he went on a snowmobile trip as part of the visit, and would remember in a 2009 interview that he had a gut feeling that Wyoming was for him. At Wyoming, Dembo had a successful career, finishing as the leading scorer and rebounder in Cowboys history. He accumulated 2,311 points and 954 rebounds. He was part of the Cowboys team that qualified for the finals at the 1986 National Invitation Tournament. The following year, the Cowboys qualified for the Sweet Sixteen of the 1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. At the 1987 NCAA Tournament, Dembo was the leading scorer, averaging 27.8 points per game. Dembo appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated dressed as a cowboy. He was the first basketball player from the University of Wyoming to be featured on the SI cover. He was inducted into the University of Wyoming Athletics Hall of Fame on October 29, 1993. His number was retired and hosted up in Wyoming's Arena Auditorium during half time on December 7, 2019. After the NBA He played for several years in Europe and the CBA after his release from the Pistons, retiring in 1998. He then bounced between several jobs, including a stint as a prison guard in Alabama. After separating from his second wife, he moved in with his mother in San Antonio, and found employment as a maintenance person for the San Antonio Water District. Early on Easter morning in 2003, a man broke into Dembo's house while he and his mother were sleeping. Dembo grabbed a gun and faced the intruder, warning him to stop and leave. When the intruder failed to stop, Dembo shot and killed him. No charges were filed against Dembo, but he was shaken by the incident, fearful for a time to talk to others or to leave his room. He ultimately was able to move on from the shooting with counseling and time. His job with the Water District sparked an interest in engineering, and he began taking courses in the subject when his schedule allowed. In the autumn of 2009, he enrolled full-time at St. Philip's College, a community college in San Antonio. In the fall of 2009, he was enrolled at the University of Texas at San Antonio. Name Dembo's unusual first name came from a suggestion by an older sister, Zona. He and his twin sister Fenise were the 11th and 12th children in their family.

Embry's 11-year playing career as a center/forward spanned from 1958 to 1969 playing for the Cincinnati Royals, Boston Celtics and Milwaukee Bucks, all of the NBA. After his playing career, Embry transitioned to a career as a professional basketball executive, becoming the first African-American general manager and team president in NBA history. Since 2004, Embry has served as a senior basketball advisor for the Toronto Raptors. Early life Embry attended Tecumseh High School near New Carlisle, Ohio, where he was a three-year letter winner and earned Honorable Mention All-State honors. College career Embry went to Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, where he became a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. As a two-time all-Mid-American Conference center, Embry, a team captain, led the then-Redskins to conference championships and NCAA Tournament appearances in 1957 and 1958. He led the MAC in scoring and rebounding in two seasons and still holds several school records, including best career rebounding average (15.5). He ranks among Miami leaders in the all-time scoring list with 1,401 points and rebounding list with 1,117. He holds both Miami and MAC records for most rebounds in a game (34) and season (488). During his career, he was one of only 10 players in MAC history to total more than 1,000 career points and rebounds. He was selected to the Helms Athletic Foundation All-America third team as a senior, and he was a two-time honorable mention All-America selection in 1957 and 1958. He was inducted in the second class of the Miami Athletics Hall of Fame in 1970. He became the fourth player in Miami history to have his jersey (23) retired. Embry earned a bachelor of science in education from Miami. NBA playing career He played in the NBA All-Star game for five consecutive seasons (1961–1965) and won the NBA Championship with the Celtics in 1968. Embry was originally drafted by the St. Louis Hawks in 1958. He was then traded closer to home weeks later to the Cincinnati Royals. The Royals were rebuilding due to the collapse of the team following the hospitalization of team star Maurice Stokes. Star center Clyde Lovellette was traded to St. Louis for Embry and four others. Oscar Robertson arrived to the team in 1960, reviving the Royals. Embry, Robertson and Jack Twyman were all NBA All-Stars for Cincinnati over the next three years. Embry's play was notable for his pick and roll play with Robertson, whose encouragement improved Embry's game. A powerful 6'8\\" and 240 pounds, Embry at times appeared to be a blocker on the court, a protector of teammates. But he also had a fine all-around game. In 1963, he was named team captain of the Royals. The 1963–64 Cincinnati Royals surged to the second-best record in the NBA, with teammate Jerry Lucas now added. But the team was not able to surpass the Boston Celtics of Red Auerbach and Bill Russell, or the Philadelphia 76ers with Wilt Chamberlain in their quest for an NBA title. Retiring to be a regional sales leader for Pepsi-Cola, Embry was talked out of retirement by friend Bill Russell, the new player/coach for Boston. Embry played crucial reserve minutes for Russell and aided that team's surprising 1967–68 NBA title run. When the Milwaukee Bucks were formed, they claimed Embry from the Celtics and Embry centered the Bucks for the 1968–69 season. NBA front-office career Embry later became an assistant manager for the Bucks, keeping an eye for former Royals teammates he could lure to the rising contender. He was instrumental in numerous signings to aid the team, including Robertson. His remarkable teaming with then-named Lew Alcindor quickly produced an NBA title, with Embry by then rising into Milwaukee's front office. After retiring as a player he became the first African-American NBA general manager, managing the Milwaukee Bucks (1972–1979), Cleveland Cavaliers (1986–1999), and Toronto Raptors (2006). He was selected NBA Executive of the Year in 1992 and 1998. In 2004, Embry was hired to be the senior basketball advisor to Rob Babcock, the rookie general manager for the Toronto Raptors. After one season, Embry was elevated from senior advisor to president, bypassing Babcock in the chain of command when the board cited a lack of confidence in Babcock's moves. On January 26, 2006, Embry was named the interim general manager for the Raptors after the firing of Babcock, a position he held for two months until Bryan Colangelo was hired as the general manager. Embry has continued to serve as senior basketball advisor for the Raptors. Since then, the Raptors went on to become NBA champions in 2019. Personal life and legacy Embry and his wife Terri have two daughters and one son. He also has a granddaughter.He is distantly related to Marty Embry, another professional basketball player. He has been a founder and CEO of his own businesses, and member of numerous nonprofit and corporate boards of directors, including Kohl's, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Centerior Energy and Ohio Casualty Insurance. He is the author of an autobiography The Inside Game: Race, Power and Politics in the NBA (University of Akron Press, 2004), with Mary Schmitt Boyer of the Cleveland [Plain Dealer. Embry has been a trustee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame since 1974 and has served on various senior-level committees for the NBA and USA Basketball. In recognition of his career both on the court and in the front office, he was inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame as a contributor to the sport in 1999. He also served as a member of Miami's Board of Trustees for 14 years, including one year as chair. Embry was inducted into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006 as a member of the charter class. He was the 2013 recipient of the Ohio Heritage Award, recognizing an Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame inductee for his or her contributions to the state of Ohio off the court.

A narrator points outs sites of interest during the trip, which crosses a curved wooden trestle whose elevation yields panoramic views of neighboring islands and the West Maui Mountains. The line is currently not operating and all equipment is stored west of Lahaina. History Lahaina Station The line follows a stretch of historic right-of-way originally constructed to haul sugarcane from the sugarcane plantation fields in Kāʻanapali to the Pioneer Mill in Lahaina. At one time, the island had over of rails connecting the sugarcane plantations to the mills. Trucks, however, largely replaced the railroads by the middle 20th century. In 1969, A.W. \\"Mac\\" McKelvey and the Makai Corporation created the railroad in order to illustrate this part of Hawaii's past. On July 24, 2014, the company announced that it would be closing on August 1, 2014 due to financial difficulties. The company was put up for sale as a going concern. Within months of closing, the Sugar Cane Train was bought by a local Maui resident Craig Hill owner of Maui Concierge Services. Hill felt that the Sugar Cane Train needed to be kept running in order to preserve one of Lahaina's best-known attractions. The Sugar Cane Train is currently running seasonal \\"Holiday Express\\" trains, which run on a short stretch of track in Kaanapali. These trains take place from late November up to December 25. The full line is now in the process of being revived. The company plans to rebuild all 3 locomotives from the ground up, as well as possibly add grade crossings to prevent accidents. Plans for the Sugar Cane Train also includes hosting weddings as well as running an evening train. The old tracks are being removed and are being replaced with newer ties and rails. Although the official website stated that operations would resume in 2018, the only trips that operated were the Holiday Express trains. In an interview, the co-owner of the railroad, Lahaina businessman Todd Domeck stated that the railroad aims to return to full operations in May 2019. Motive power No.3 Myrtle *No. 1 Anaka: a narrow gauge steam locomotive produced by H.K. Porter, Inc. of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in February 1943 for the Carbon Limestone Company. The engine has undergone extensive exterior modification since it was built by Porter. It was built as a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive. In this form, it had a large tank surrounding the boiler, which held water for the locomotive. The LKPRR removed the saddle tanks, added a tender to hold water and fuel, added a larger smokestack, a wooden cab and larger headlight that resembles oil lamps once found on steam locomotives. These changes transformed the engine from a comparatively austere industrial locomotive, into a more lively and colorful engine representative of many small mainline engines once found on railroads throughout the United States in the late 19th century. *No. 3 Myrtle: produced as a brother engine to No. 1, the No. 3 is also a narrow gauge steam locomotive produced by H.K.

As such, it has a steel cab, whaleback tender, small headlight modeled on an electric prototype, and darker color scheme.

The manuscript is the first major chronicle of the Teutonic Order in Prussia and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, completed some 100 years after the conquest of the crusaders into the Baltic region. It is a major source for information on the Order's battles with Old Prussians and Lithuanians. The chronicle is written in Latin and consists of four volumes. The first volume gives the background of the Order and its crusades in Outremer. The second volume narrates how the Order arrived to the Prussian land, while the third volume details wars with Old Prussians and other Baltic tribes. The fourth volume provides a historical context of other contemporary events in the world. The chronicle has an addendum of another 20 chapters dealing with events of 1326-1330, which may also have been written by Peter of Dusburg. The chronicle is based on local monastery annals, chronicles, reports and narrations which Peter \\"considered reliable\\". Peter had access to the Grand Masters' archive in Marienburg and witnessed some events himself. The chronicle contains some ethnographic data about the Old Prussians, the indigenous people conquered by the Order. It provides numerous chapters in the styles of religious visions, miracles, and hagiography, aimed at the glorification of the mission of the Order. The war against pagans is sacred and all knights who perish go to heaven. Peter takes no interest in domestic policy of the Order; he does not describe cities, trade, or colonization. Rather the chronicle describes minor raids and clashes with great detail. While narratives of events and battles are considered to be reliable, ethnographic data is ideologically charged. As a priest Peter tried to teach the reader. Pagan Prussians and Lithuanians are presented as a moral example. They are pious in their own way, and Christians should be ashamed of their disobedient and sinful ways.

Terrain Chirikof Island consists of of grasses and sedges. Treeless, it lies west of the western tree line in Alaska. The island is shaped like a webbed duck foot with the heel to the north and the webbing to the south. The seas around Chirikof are treacherous and the island has a history of shipwrecks. The south shore has a wide beach suitable for aircraft landings and cautious watercraft landings. The island is open to general public access. Commercial carriers need a permit to visit; personal planes or boats need no permit. Habitation The first human inhabitants of the island were the Old Islanders, 4000-2000 BP (before present, i.e., before 1950.)Archaeology of Southwest Alaska and the Pacific Coast http://www.nps.gov/akso/akarc/swest.htmCultural Resources in Aniakchak National Monument A subsistence village existed up to the late 19th century, when it was succeeded first by fox farming and then by cattle farming. There has generally been continuous human habitation of Chirikof, relieved by short periods of abandonment. In 1980, the island became part of the Alaska Maritime Wildlife Refuge. The only inhabitants now are a herd of perhaps 700-800 feral cattle. Cattle have been present on the island since the late 19th century.Fields, Wanda Marie, Now It Can Be Told: Stories of Alaskan Pioneer Ranchers, Anchorage: Publications Consultants, 2000 In the 21st century, the herd has become the subject of an ongoing controversy between a small group of Kodiak ranchers and the US Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages the refuge. (See National interest lands below.) Names Alexei Chirikov, the namesake of the island. Vitus Bering, captain of the St. Peter, and Alexei Chirikov, captain of the St. Paul, sailed from Kamchatka in 1741 with charts that called the island Tummenoi, a Russian word meaning foggy. The log of the St. Peter recorded a sighting of the island on August 2, 1741, which was St. Stephen's day. For this reason, Bering renamed the island St. Stephen Island. Bering's ship and Chirikof's had become separated early in the voyage and Chirikof never saw the island. Nonetheless, in 1794, explorer George Vancouver renamed the island Chirikof Island, observing that Capt. Chirikof's \\"labors in the arduous task of discovery do not appear to have been thus commemorated.\\"Marshall & Marshall, \\"Vancouver's Voyage,\\" 1967 Alutiiqs of the area still call the island Ukamok (ooo-KA-mok) for the ground squirrels common there. Russian-American Company In 1799 the Russian-American Company was given a charter by Tsar Paul I to govern the territory of Alaska and manage the exploitation of its resources. The company had already established a permanent colony for European settlers on Kodiak Island. Supported at first by the infamous fur trade, the Kodiak colonists later pursued cattle ranching and fox farming. During the Russian period (i.e., 1740s to 1867) a population of 60-100 villagers lived a subsistence life on nearby Chirikof. The villagers were Alutiiq, Tlingit, Russian and western Europeans. Some were creoles, the Alaskan word for mixed race. They worshiped in a small Russian orthodox church. The village was abandoned soon after the Russian church called the only priest on the island back to Kodiak in 1870.Black, Lydia, address to the Kodiak Historical Society, May 2002, videotaped Alaska Commercial Company Alaska Commercial Company acquired the assets of the Russian-American Company in 1867 when Russia sold the territory to America. In 1887, an ACC subsidiary was formed to breed blue foxes on Chirikof. Voles were imported to feed the foxes. A small herd of cattle was brought in to provide meat for the American caretakers, who disliked seal meat. From time to time - 1892, 1912 - the company shipped additional cattle to the island. The cattle were not landed; the crew just drove them overboard and they swam to shore. Once on land, the cattle thrived unattended on the nutritious island grasses. They also lost many traits of domestication. They do not herd up; they charge horses and men; when spooked, they flee into the sea and swim around till it is safe to come out.Fields, 2000 Russian penal colony The late Dr. Lydia Black, a leading scholar of the Russian-American period in Alaska, rebutted the legend that there was once a Russian penal colony on Chirikof. Among those who perpetuated that myth was artist, traveler and writer Henry Wood Elliott, who wrote accurately and alarmingly of the fur trade slaughter but fictitiously of much else.Elliott, Henry Wood, \\"Our Arctic Province,\\" 1886 Few people at the time were knowledgeable enough to refute Elliott's fantasies. One who could was Capt. Arthur Morris, administrator of Alaska in 1877, who once stated, \\"Don't believe a word Elliott says except about fur seals.\\"Black, May 2002 Beef industry The beef industry on Chirikof began in earnest in 1925 and continued as late as 1983, when a $875,000 loan from the Alaska Agricultural Loan Board brought 600 new head to the island.Fields, 2000 The original venture was the brain-child of an Iowa farm boy with a law degree named Jack McCord. McCord formed the Chirikof Cattle Company and labored from 1925 to 1950 to build a successful beef industry on the island. The story is a long saga of shipwrecks, plane crashes, unruly feral cattle, unfulfilled contracts, spoiled meat and good money thrown after bad.Long, John Sherman, \\"McCord of Alaska,\\" 1975 A succession of hopeful owners since McCord has been unable to profitably market the beef from this remote island. Ranch workers report that the meat is virtually \\"inedible,\\" tough and hard to digest.Personal conversation with Ham Hamilton National interest lands As part of the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), certain state lands reverted to federal ownership. In 1980, Chirikof Island was added to the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. The management plan for the refuge entails restoring the island's native species and requires removal of the cattle, which overgraze the land and damage bird habitat. However, the most recent attempt in 2003 to remove a small part of the herd - 37 head, by barge - resulted in injuries to the animals that attracted the attention of the Humane Society of the United States.Associated Press, December 5, 2003 Additionally, legal issues have delayed plans to remove the herd and restore the island as a bird sanctuary.http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2003/Alaskan-Wild-Cattle-Herd-Faces- Expulsion/id-d32d9d3f457ca17c904dcb4e59e1a5f0?SearchText=chirikof;Display_ Additional resources * Ford, Corey, Where the Sea Breaks Its Back * Davidson, The Tracks and Landfalls of Bering and Chirikof * Golder, Bering's Voyages * Waxell, The American Expedition * Steller, Journal of a Voyage with Bering * Beaglehole, The Life of Captain James Cook * Alaska Geographic, Vol 4 No 3, 1977, Kodiak, Island of Change * Alaska Magazine, August 2000, The Wild Cattle of Chirikof Island * Rivers, Raymond, Chirikof Adventure, 1949, printed 1961 in Mukluk Telegraph * Kashevaroff, Chirikof Never a Penal Colony, Jan 28, 1929, Daily Alaska Empire * McCord/Frye letters, Kodiak Historical Society * Personal communications from Woodworth, Hamilton, Homme, Stavelund and others References External links * Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge * Chirikof (Peter’s Photos) Islands of the Kodiak Archipelago Former populated places in Alaska Islands of Alaska ","title":"Chirikof Island"},{"id":"2819328","text":"Peter of Dusburg (; ; died after 1326), also known as Peter of Duisburg, was a Priest-Brother and chronicler of the Teutonic Knights.

It is based on the memoirs of André Devigny, a member of the French Resistance held in Montluc prison by the occupying Germans during World War II. The protagonist of the film is called Fontaine. Bresson himself was imprisoned by the Germans as a member of the French Resistance. The second part of the title comes from the Bible (). The soundtrack uses the Kyrie from Mozart's Great Mass in C minor, K. 427. The film was entered into the 1957 Cannes Film Festival, and has been one of Bresson's most renowned works since its initial release. Plot After the establishing shot of Montluc prison, but before the opening credits, the camera rests on a plaque commemorating the 7,000 prisoners who died at the hands of the Nazis. On the way to jail, Fontaine (François Leterrier), a member of the French Resistance, seizes an opportunity to escape his German captors when the car carrying him is forced to stop, but he is soon apprehended, beaten for his attempt, handcuffed and taken to the jail. At first he is incarcerated in a cell on the first floor of the prison, and he is able to talk to three French men who are exercising in the courtyard. The men obtain a safety pin for Fontaine, which gives him the ability to unlock his handcuffs. This turns out to be needless as a means to help him with any escape plans he may already have, but it allows him at will, to remove the handcuffs which are kept on him 24 hours a day. He eventually gives his word parole to the German magistrate he is brought before, not to escape, and is moved to a cell on the top floor without handcuffs. Once in the new cell, Fontaine begins inspecting the door and discovers that the boards are joined together with low-quality wood. Using an iron spoon he deliberately neglects to return after a meal, he begins to chip away at the wood. After weeks of work, he is able to remove three boards from the door, roam the hallway, get back in his cell and restore the appearance of the door. Fontaine is not the only prisoner trying to escape. Orsini (Jacques Ertaud) makes an attempt, but fails to get very far because his rope breaks at the second wall. Orsini is tossed back in his cell, beaten up by the guards, and executed a few days later. Fontaine is not deterred from his plan. He makes hooks from the light fitting in his cell, fashions himself ropes from clothing and bedding and fastens the hooks to the rope with wires taken from his bed. The other prisoners grow somewhat skeptical of his escape plans, saying he is taking too long. After being taken to Gestapo headquarters to be informed that he is sentenced to execution, Fontaine is taken back to jail and put in the same cell. Soon he gets a cellmate, François Jost (Charles Le Clainche), a sixteen- year-old who had joined the German army. Fontaine is not sure whether he can trust Jost (whom he sees speaking on friendly terms with a German guard) and realizes he will either have to kill him or take him with him in the escape. In the end, after Jost admits he too wants to escape, he chooses to trust the boy and tells him the plan. One night, they escape by gaining access to the roof of the building, descending to the courtyard via a rope, killing the German guard there, and climbing over two walls. They drop down into the street undetected and walk away.

They were known for their science-fiction themed lyrics and use of keyboards, both of which were virtually unknown in extreme metal at the time. History =Formation= Nocturnus was formed in 1987 by drummer/vocalist Mike Browning following the breakup of his old band Incubus. The band was formed by Browning, former Incubus guitarist Gino Marino and former Agent Steel bassist Richard Bateman. The band eventually began working on material and added second guitarist Vincent Crowley. This first lineup recorded one self-titled demo in 1987. Crowley quit (going on to form Acheron) and was replaced by then-unknown 18-year-old guitar prodigy Mike Davis, who was also Marinos cousin. Bateman quit shortly afterwards to join Nasty Savage. Nocturnus added new bassist Jeff Estes and a keyboard player, Louis Panzer, in 1988. Panzer's addition made the band unique in the death metal scene and provided the band with an atmosphere that enhanced their increasingly science fiction-themed lyrical content and image. This lineup put out the Science of Horror demo. In 1989, Marino quit and was replaced by Davis's long time friend and neighbor Sean McNenney. With both Davis and McNenney being highly technical players, their often dueling and very fast guitar solos became another focal point of the band. =The Key= In 1989, thanks in large part to Mike Davis's friendship with Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth, the band signed to Earache Records. The band recorded their debut album, The Key with Tom Morris, which was released in 1990. The album, filled with a unique occult-meets-sci-fi concept (a blend of Browning and Davis's influences, respectively), virtuoso guitar pyrotechnics and space-age-ish keyboards, managed to become a death metal hit, spawning tracks such as \\"Standing In Blood\\" and \\"BC/AD (Before Christ/After Death)\\". It has gone on to sell 70,000 copies worldwide. It also featured backing vocals by former Mantas/Death and then-Massacre vocalist Kam Lee. During the recording of The Key, Jeff Estes began developing a major drinking problem that negatively affected his bass playing skills, and Mike Davis ended up playing much of the bass on the album. Estes was fired shortly after and was replaced by Jim O'Sullivan. With O'Sullivan on board, the band toured for The Key in 1991 in support of Bolt Thrower, and then embarked on the Grindcrusher tour with Morbid Angel, Napalm Death, and Godflesh. O'Sullivan ended up not working out and he was fired as soon as the band's tours were over. =Thresholds= In 1992, the band decided to get a full-time vocalist, allowing Browning to concentrate solely on drumming and because Earache promised the band a music video if they got a \\"real\\" frontman. Former Tortured Soul vocalist Dan Izzo was brought in on lead vocals. The band hired session bassist Chris Anderson to play on their next album, Thresholds. With Browning becoming less involved in the band's songwriting, Thresholds saw the band moving in a much more space and sci-fi oriented direction lyrically. Musically, the album was less unrelenting and more diverse than The Key, including an instrumental track (\\"Nocturne in Bm\\"), employment of acoustic guitars (\\"Arctic Crypt\\"), and exotic percussion (\\"Tribal Voudon\\"). The album did not sell quite as well as The Key, perhaps due to the band's more mature direction. Despite this, it was generally favorably received by critics and fans for its ambitious and unique progressive direction. \\"Alter Reality\\" was released as a single with a music video, and \\"Arctic Crypt\\" and \\"Subterranean Infiltrator\\" also became fan favorites. The band also got a new permanent bassist Emo Mowery (formerly of Malediction) and had a European tour for Thresholds, during which time the band was unsatisfied with Earaches lack of promotion leading them to make little money off the tour. After the band returned home to the United States, musical differences between Mike Browning and the rest of the band became increasingly apparent. This culminated in Sean McNenney and Louis Panzer, behind Brownings back, ensuring rights to the bandname \\"Nocturnus\\", which they also signed Mike Davis onto, but not Izzo or Mowery. Browning was fired from the band shortly after, and to this day there is bad blood between the McNenney/Panzer and Browning camps. Browning was replaced by James Marcinek. The new Nocturnus lineup began recording new songs for a third album, including \\"Mummified\\", \\"The Invertebrate Plague\\", \\"The Great Spot\\", and \\"Orbital Decay\\", all of which were written by Davis/McNenney/Panzer. However around this time the band began to lose label support from Earache as their contract was dropped. The new lineup put out a two song self-titled EP in 1993, which featured a recycled early song \\"Possess The Priest\\" and the brand new \\"Mummified\\". However Panzer, McNenney, and Marcinek all departed the band after this, and the band effectively split. During this time most of the band members effectively fell off the musical grid, with the exception of Mike Davis's work on a project with Trey Azagthoth which never saw the light of day. =Ethereal Tomb= In the late 1990s, Sean McNenney and Louis Panzer began playing together again, writing ambient metal riffs. Eventually deciding that these new ideas could work as new Nocturnus material, Mike Davis and Emo Mowery were readded to the fold, along with new drummer Rick Bizarro. In 1999 Nocturnus released their comeback album Ethereal Tomb, now on Seasons of Mist. The album had a more refined and ambient sound than the band's previous work. However, in 2002 the band finally split up for good. =Break-up and aftermath= Since the dissolution of Nocturnus, the most active former member has been Emo Mowery, playing in bands such as Leash Law in Florida. At a certain point Louis Panzer reformed an old band called Cry Blue, which Mike Browning described as \\"Sting type music\\", though he was known to be involved in the software industry and living in North Carolina. Currently, he is the executive director of North Carolina 8-1-1. Browning has been involved in a wide variety of projects, currently After Death, which bears a style similar to a less technical Nocturnus. The other members of the band have been inactive in music as far as is known, with former guitarist Mike Davis in particular having gained quite a mystique (false rumors of his death circulated in 2008, and he is often falsely credited with playing guitar in Rob Halfords solo band, misattributed to be Halfords bassist of the same name). Post-breakup the band has made two releases, The Nocturnus Demos, a collection of the band's pre-Earache recordings, and Farewell To Planet Earth, a DVD of live shows from various periods. In late 2008 Browning toured with his own band After Death under the Nocturnus name for two exclusive UK dates one at BUSK in Birmingham and the other in London plus some European gigs. In May 2013, Earache Records began a Kickstarter campaign to gather pledges for Thresholds to be re-released for the first time since its official release date in 1992 using the original DAT master tape, successfully reaching its goal in July. Also in 2013, After Death performed under the Nocturnus name once more for a Mexican tour. On 24 September 2013, it was announced that Nocturnus would play Maryland Deathfest 2014, and perform their album The Key in its entirety. Shortly after, the band reformed as Nocturnus A.D., containing every member from After Death.

He was captain of cricket at Eton in both 1918 and 1919. After Eton, Gibson went up to Clare College, Cambridge. In 1921, having had two successful seasons playing for Cambridge University, he was picked by the former England captain Archie MacLaren as a member of his amateur eleven that took on, and beat, the all-conquering Australian cricket team, led by Warwick Armstrong, that had won eight successive Test matches against England. Gibson took six Australian wickets for 64 runs in the second innings. After Cambridge, he toured Australia and New Zealand on an unofficial Marylebone Cricket Club tour led by MacLaren. Also at MacLaren's instigation, he was invited to join the 1924-25 official England tour of Australia and New Zealand, but declined the invitation as he had moved back to Argentina, where he spent most of the rest of his life. Having first played for the county in two matches after leaving school in 1919, he played occasional games for Sussex until 1926 and his last first- class appearance was for the M.C.C. in 1939.

He was transferred to United States military custody and held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp as a suspected enemy combatant from early 2002 to February 14, 2004, the only Spanish citizen to be detained there.Spanish inmate to be transferred from Guantanamo, The Guardian, 12 February 2004, 4 March 2013 His internment serial number (ISN) was 267.\\"Ahmad Abd al-Rahman Ahmad\\", Guantanamo Docket, New York Times, accessed 4 March 2013 In 2004, the United States allowed his extradition to Spain to face terrorism charges, based on confessions made while in US custody. Spanish authorities alleged that Abderrahman Ahmad was a member of a Spanish al-Qaeda cell. Ahmad was convicted of those charges by the High Court in 2005 and sentenced to six years in prison. Review of the case in an appeal to the Spanish Supreme Court resulted in the conviction being overturned in July 2006, as based on evidence that may have been obtained through torture by American interrogators. Such evidence is inadmissible in Spanish courts. Early life Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmad was born to a Muslim family in Ceuta, a Spanish enclave in North Africa. As a young man, he worked in construction when jobs were available. Capture in Pakistan Ahmad went to Afghanistan and, after the United States intervention, tried to escape through Pakistan. He was arrested by Pakistani soldiers and transferred to United States military custody in the fall of 2001. He was transferred in 2002 to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, where he was held as a suspected enemy combatant and interrogated. When captured, he was unmarried. Terrorism conviction in Spain and appeal The Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon, prepared the indictment against Ahmad. Prosecutors alleged that Ahmad had gone to Afghanistan to train with followers of Osama bin Laden. Ahmad was convicted in his trial in Spain. On October 5, 2005, Ahmed was sentenced to six years in prison. Three other detainees indicted with Ahmad were the Moroccan Lahcen Ikassrien, and two legal residents of Britain, Omar Deghayes and Jamil al Banna. Spanish authorities alleged that these four may have had some involvement, not only with the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, but also with planning the later 2004 Madrid train bombings. The Washington Post reported on July 24, 2006, that Ahmad's conviction was overturned, on appeal, by the Spanish Supreme Court.Reuters, Ex-Guantanamo Spaniard cleared by supreme court, Washington Post, 24 July 2006, also at http://www.redorbit.com/news/international/585649/exguantanamo_spaniard_cleared_by_supreme_court/, accessed 4 March 2013 According to Reuters, the Supreme Court found that the Spanish High Court, which had originally convicted Ahmad, had not taken into account his right to the presumption of innocence. The Court said that evidence collected at Guantanamo \\"should be declared totally void and, as such, non-existent.\\" In November 2006, the US Embassy in Madrid sent a cable to Washington, released on WikiLeaks on November 30, 2010, which described the Supreme Court findings. The Spanish Supreme Court found that any confessions or evidence obtained outside Spain could not be included in the case. In the absence of any other compelling evidence, it said there was no case as \\"interrogations, euphemistically called 'interviews,' took place under unequal circumstances because (the defendant) was in detention at the time of the interrogations.\\" The court asserted that Ahmed had been mistreated while in US custody; Reuters suggested this affected the Court's decision. The Washington Post quoted from the Spanish Supreme Court's decision: > Neither the motivation the subject had to travel to Afghanistan, nor the > activities he carried out, justifies the verdict passed by the High Court. Garzón's comments on Guantanamo Baltasar Garzón, the most prominent investigative magistrate in Spain, who had requested Ahmad's extradition, discussed the Guantanamo detention camps at a legal conference in late May 2006: > A model like Guantánamo is an insult to countries that respect laws. It > delegitimizes us. It is a place that needs to disappear immediately.\\"Spanish > Judge Calls for Closing U.S. Prison at Guantánamo\\", New York Times, June 4, > 2006 Garzón, speaking of the evidence against Ahmad, which was supplied to Spain by United States intelligence officials, said that he was convicted without evidence from Guantanamo: > Everything obtained from there [Guantanamo] was useless because it went > against the rules. (Note: In July 2006 the Spanish Supreme Court overturned Ahmad's conviction on appeal, finding that the High Court had failed to give him the presumption of innocence.) Suspected terrorist activity in Ceuta On December 12, 2006, the Spanish government arrested eleven terrorist suspects in Ceuta, the Spanish enclave on the North African coast, including two men said to be brothers of Ahmad. \\"Possible UK link with alleged Islamic terrorists arrested in Ceuta\\", Typically Spanish, December 12, 2006 Initial accounts incorrectly said that Ahmad was one of the arrested men. The press reported that the arrested men were associated with the Moroccan Islamic Combat Group, according to the Interior Ministry. The arrested men were believed to have sent recruits to fight in Iraq. CNN said the men were associated with the Salafist Group for Call and Combat.Al Goodman, \\"Spain arrests 11 terror suspects\\", CNN, 12 December 2006, accessed 4 March 2013 The Jamestown Foundation described the group as grassroots jihadist; areas of concern by Interior Ministry officials were that the group was trying to recruit Spanish soldiers of Muslim origin who were born in Ceuta, and that they were trying to build on friction resulting from the non-renewal of contracts of some Muslim military members.Javier Jordán, Robert Wesley, \\"The Threat of Grassroots Jihadi Networks: A Case Study\\", Terrorism Monitor, Volume: 5 Issue: 3, The Jamestown Foundation, 21 February 2007, accessed 4 March 2013 Torture claims investigation On April 29, 2009, that Spanish investigating magistrate Baltazar Garzon initiated a formal investigation into whether confessions from Ahmed and three other former Guantanamo captives were the result of the use of abusive interrogation techniques by the United States. Spain had originally brought charges against these four men, who claimed having suffered torture during US interrogation. Ahmad and the other three men: Lahcen Ikassrien, Jamiel Abdul Latif al Banna and Omar Deghayes, had previously faced charges in Spanish courts, based on confessions they made while in US custody. Their charges had been dropped based on their claims that their confessions were false and obtained through coercive interrogation techniques.

Life and work Kaufmann Kohler was born into a family of rabbis in Fürth, Bavaria. He received his rabbinical training at Hassfurt, Höchberg near Würzburg, Mainz, Altona, and at Frankfurt am Main (under Samson Raphael Hirsch), and his university training at Munich, Berlin, Leipzig, and Erlangen (Ph.D. 1868; his thesis, \\"Der Segen Jacob's\\" (Jacob's Blessing), was one of the earliest Jewish essays in the field of the higher Biblical criticism, and its radical character had the effect of closing to him the Jewish pulpit in Germany). Abraham Geiger, to whose Zeitschrift Kohler became a contributor at an early age, strongly influenced his career and directed his steps to America. In 1869 he accepted a call to the pulpit of the Beth-El congregation in Detroit; in 1871 he became rabbi of Chicago Sinai Congregation. In 1879 he succeeded his father-in-law, David Einhorn, as rabbi of Temple Beth-El, New York City; his brother-in-law, Emil Hirsch, becoming his successor in Chicago. Feb. 26, 1903, he was elected to the presidency of Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati. = Reform movement = From the time of his arrival in America, Kohler actively espoused the cause of Reform Judaism; he was one of the youngest members of the Philadelphia Jewish Rabbinical Conference of 1869, and in 1885 he convened the Pittsburgh Rabbinical Conference, which adopted the so-called \\"Pittsburgh Platform\\", on which Reform Judaism in America stands. While in Chicago he introduced Sunday lectures as supplementary to the regular Sabbath service. Kohler served for many years as president of the New York Board of Ministers, and was honorary president of the Central Conference of American Rabbis. He was editor-in-chief of the Sabbath Visito, a Jewish weekly for youth, from 1881 to 1882 and, with I. S. Moses, and Emil G. Hirsch, \\"The Jewish Reformer,\\" a weekly, devoted to the interests of Reform Judaism, in 1886. He was deeply interested in the \\"Jewish Chautauqua\\" movement. He was a keynote speaker at the 1893 World Parliament of Religions where he spoke about \\"Human Brotherhood as Taught by the Religions Based on the Bible\\".John Henry Barrows, The World Parliament of Religions Vol 1, Chicago: The Parliament Publishing Company, 1893, pg 366-373. Shortly before his departure from New York in 1903 he delivered a series of six lectures at the Jewish Theological Seminary on \\"Apocryphal Literature\\". He expressed doubts about the Pittsburgh Platform, stating in 1892: > We ought not be blind to the fact that Reform, with no other principle but > that of progress and enlightenment has created a tendency to treat the past > with irreverence and to trifle with the time-honored institutions and > venerable sources of Judaism.

Early in 1994 Shane Melder replaced Fox on drums and in the next year the group relocated to Sydney. Sidewinder were staples of the Australian alternative rock scene in the 1990s and released two studio albums, Atlantis (January 1996) and Tangerine (September 1997). Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described them as \\"an accessible brand of distortion-drenched, harmony-driven, indie guitar power pop.\\" Sidewinder released two albums and three EPS between 1992 and 1998, all of which were critically acclaimed and received solid Triple J and commercial airplay. These albums ‘traversed a broad sonic terrain, from Beatlesesque psychedelia to eardrum shattering ballsy rock’. Sidewinder were one of the ‘best loved live acts of this decade [1990s]’. had regular spots on festival bills, including the Big Day Out (1994, 1995, and as national touring artists 1996) and played every Homebake from 1996 to 1998 (January, December 1996/ January, December 1998). They toured extensively with many of their contemporaries, including bands such as Powderfinger, Custard, The Hummingbirds, You Am I, The Clouds, The Fauves, Tumbleweed and Magic Dirt. They also played with other bands, such as Something for Kate, the Dirty Three, the Whitlams, the Underground Lovers and Gaslight Radio. They supported international touring artists, including U2 on the Australian leg of their PopMart Tour in February 1998. They also played with Pavement, the Jesus and Mary Chain, Sebadoh, Superchunk and Red Kross. They disbanded in 2000.  History  Sidewinder were founded in 1990 in Canberra by Pip Branson on guitar, Martin Craft on bass guitar and backing vocals, his brother Nick Craft on lead guitar and vocals, and Giri Fox on drums. Most of the members were still in secondary school. They played their first live shows in 1991 and in the following year they signed to Half a Cow – a label owned by ex-Canberran musician Nic Dalton (Lemonheads, Plunderers) – which was later purchased by Universal Music. By that time Jeremy David had joined on viola. One of the group's early gigs was at a circus in July 1992. Dalton compiled a sampler album, Slice Two (November 1992), by various artists on his label, which included an early Sidewinder track, \\"Last Time\\". On 12 February 1993 the group issued their debut five-track extended play, T Star – the title refers to \\"an obscure brand of dodgy runners\\". The Canberra Times Steven Corby described their sonation as \\"grungy guitar pop, a definition Martin agrees with. It's not pop and it's not metal and the experimental move of adding a viola player to their line-up has given their sound a thickness that is its most original factor.\\" Their second EP, Yoko Icepick, which had four tracks followed on 22 October 1993. Late that year David left and was not replaced. Sidewinder toured with Tumbleweed; The Canberra Times Rachel Hill found that as a consequence \\"the songs from Yoko Icepick were being played better live, leaving a gap between what people were hearing on the CD and at gigs.\\" Early in the following year the group appeared at the Big Day Out; soon after Shane Melder (ex-the Hummingbirds) replaced Fox on drums. The group's third EP, The Gentle Art of Spoonbending, appeared in February 1995, for which Hill felt that they \\"had moved on to a different type of sound and, with the help of better equipment, were producing a bigger sound.\\" The five tracks were written by the Craft brothers and \\"display an underlying simplicity not shared by the previous releases.\\" McFarlane opined that it \\"included two of the band's strongest songs in 'Up to You' and 'Day After Day'.\\" Hill described \\"Up to You\\", which \\"represents Sidewinder's dynamics as a live band, illustrating the sonic power which drives it\\" while \\"Day After Day\\" was \\"a beautifully written ballad with a Beatlesque feel to it, demonstrating the band's songwriting skills.\\" The group relocated to Sydney in February 1995. Late that year, the band issued their debut studio album, Atlantis, which McFarlane declared was \\"brimming with unabashed, infectious rock energy and displayed a great deal of potential.\\" Ahead of its appearance they released a single, \\"Anything You Want\\" (October), and then joined Powderfinger and Fur on a national Truckstop tour. Two further singles followed in 1996, \\"Evil Eye\\" (January) and \\"Not Coming Home\\" (April). Also in January that year they appeared on the Big Day Out tour and followed, during that year, with national tours alongside Custard, Snout and then the Fauves. While still members of Sidewinder, Martin Craft and Melder formed a side project, Fragile, as a studio-only band with Wayne Connolly on guitar and backing vocals (ex-the Welcome Mat, Knievel) and Simon Holmes on guitar and lead vocals (ex-the Hummingbirds). That group issued an album, Airbrushed Perfection, on Half a Cow/Mercury in March 1996. McFarlane described how it \\"ran the gamut of sounds from jangly pop ('Dream Come True') to noisy Hüsker Dü-inspired rockers ('She Really Means that Much to Me', 'Resolving Conflict Situations').\\" Their second album, Tangerine (September 1997) made many top ten lists for the best album of the year, and is sometimes considered to be one of the finest Australian rock records of the 1990s. It was co-produced by Paul McKercher and the group. Brett Winterford of The Sydney Morning Herald reflected on the album, in January 2008, which \\"grafted a jangle of distorted guitars with electronic loops and samples, affected vocals and stunning, synth-led soundscapes... Artistically, Tangerine was a window into the future of indie music but commercially it was a flop.\\" Rolling Stones Kate Crawford felt it provided a \\"special breed of uplifting pub pop that wins hearts and minds no matter what disasters occur.\\" The lead single from their second album, \\"Titanic Days\\", was released in April 1997: it appeared on the soundtrack for the feature film, Blackrock. A second single, \\"Here She Comes Again\\", was issued in August. \\"Titanic Days\\" was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1997, with a third single, \\"God\\", appearing in February 1998. Despite their ability to pull crowds throughout Australia, their critical success, good airplay and solid sales figures, Sidewinder were dropped by Universal in 1999 when the label took over Mercury/Polygram. Post break-up Martin Craft went on to have a successful solo career under his own name and is currently working as a producer and songwriter. His albums include I Can See It All Tonight (2004), Silver and Fire (2006) and Arrows at the Sun (2008). He also plays as a touring member in Jarvis Cocker's band. Nick Craft formed The Zillions and released the albums Zig-Zag Zillionaire (2005) and Zeuxis: Xight Zeen (2008), as well as music for theatre soundtracks. In 2018, he released his debut solo album, Minerva. Pip Branson was a touring member of Something for Kate in 2001, and later formed his own band, the Pip Branson Corporation – they released an EP, Hot Dollar (April 2007). He was also a member of Mikelangelo and The Black Sea Gentlemen, under the name Rufino. Shane Melder played with a number of bands, including the Died Pretty, The Hummingbirds and David McCormack from Custard. Melder was a member of The City Lights for their debut album, Escape from Tomorrow (May 2004).

Grace periods can range from a number of minutes to a number of days or longer, and can apply in situations including arrival at a job, paying a bill, or meeting a government or legal requirement. In law, a grace period is a time period during which a particular rule exceptionally does not apply, or only partially applies. For the grace period in patent law, see novelty (patent). In games (video and real life), a grace period is the time after a respawn in which a player cannot be hit or killed- they are 'safe' for a short time so that they will not die repeatedly, which would lead to loss of enjoyment. Types =Business= Some companies and organizations do not view someone who fulfills an obligation within a grace period any differently from someone who does so before the original deadline. Thus a subject who is past due, but who meets the obligation within the grace period, receives equal treatment and no penalty or negative reputation. In other cases, clients may receive a partial, less severe penalty. For example, many utility companies will charge a small late fee for those who do not pay their bill by the stated due date. However, the utility service provider will wait a longer time before cutting off service. Some companies may suspend certain privileges during a grace period. For example, self storage services will often waive a late fee if the rent is not paid for up to several days past the due date, but will deny the tenant access to his or her unit until the bill is paid. =Politics= In politics, a grace period or honeymoon period may be observed during the transition to a new administration as \\"an initial period of harmony and goodwill\\". Advantages and disadvantages Grace periods can provide some advantages. For example, people who habitually fulfill their obligations on time, but are late on a rare occasion due to special circumstances, can avoid a penalty and maintain their reputation for timeliness provided they fulfill the obligation within the grace period. However, habitual procrastinators may come to view the grace period as the actual deadline, and if, due to unforeseen circumstances, they are occasionally late beyond that, they might complain about the applied penalty. Credit cards In personal finance, a grace period is the period during which no interest is charged on a credit card. See Credit card interest for further information. It can also be a time period after a payment due date within which the fee can be paid without penalty. For example, late charges may not be incurred for payments due on the first of the month if they are paid on or before the 10th of the month.

From 1916 to 1918, Ernst Kirchweger participated in World War I as a sailor in the Austro-Hungarian Navy. Afterwards, he fought on the side of the Red Army. Until 1934, he was a member of the Social Democratic Party of Austria, but then he joined the Communists, which was outlawed at that time. During the reigns of the Fatherland Front and National Socialist German Workers Party, he risked his life as an activist in illegal trade unions. After Austria's liberation in 1945, having survived concentration camp, he continued to speak out against Fascism and National Socialism. On March 31, 1965, a demonstration of students, former resistance fighters and unions against Taras Borodajkewycz, a university professor accused of having made anti-Semitic statements, took place in Vienna, while the student organisation of the Freedom Party of Austria organized a riot. There were skirmishes between the participants of the two demonstrations; during one in which Kichweger was attacked by Günther Kümel and severely injured. He died three days later, aged 67, as a result of his injuries. Kümel was sentenced to ten months in prison. 25,000 people attended Kirchweger's funeral. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering; his ashes are now buried in Hietzing Cemetery in Vienna. In 1990, the Wielandschule in Vienna-Favoriten, a building owned by the Communist Party, was seized by left-wing activists and named Ernst-Kirchweger-Haus.

The head of the Muay Thai Stunt team (previously known as P.P.N. Stunt Team), he is best known for his work as a martial arts and action choreographer on the 2003 film Ong-Bak: Muay Thai Warrior and 2005's Tom-Yum-Goong (known as The Protector in the US), starring Tony Jaa, whom Panna mentored. Biography =Early films= \\"You've probably never heard of my movies,\\" Panna told the Bangkok Post in a 2004 interview. \\"They are popular among taxi drivers and som tam vendors and security guards and Isan coolies. My loyalest fans are folk people in the far-out tambons, where they lay out mattresses on the ground and drink moonshine whisky while watching my outdoor movies.\\" Born in Khon Kaen Province, Thailand, Panna started out in the movie business in 1979 as a physical trainer for actors in Bangkok. Learning a little about filmmaking and inspired by the movies of Jackie Chan and Bruce Lee, as well as stunts seen in James Bond movies, Panna moved back to Khon Kaen and formed his own stunt team, the P.P.N. Stunt Team (actually known as Muay Thai Stunt) and set about making films.Rithdee, Kong (July 16, 2004). \\"Don't try this at home\\", Bangkok Post. His first was Gerd ma lui (Born to Fight), which he remade in 2004. =International fame= With the worldwide releases of Ong-Bak and Tom-Yum-Goong, with their gritty, hard- hitting stunts, action-film fans the world over have wanted to see more, so film distributors are starting to release some of Panna's older titles on DVDs geared for the international market. Among the films finding new life on the home video market are Spirited Killer, or Puen Hode, co-starring Tony Jaa, as well as Mission Hunter 2, in which Jaa portrays a villain. Panna's martial- arts choreography work also can be seen in the action-comedy, The Bodyguard, which starred and was directed by Thai comic actor Petchtai Wongkamlao. Recent and upcoming projects include Mercury Man, a Thai superhero film in which he coordinated the martial arts; the sequel to Ong-Bak, Ong Bak 2; and Chocolate, a film directed by Prachya Pinkaew starring a female martial artist, Yanin Vismistananda.

Derivation of the title The expression \\"boots on the ground\\" has an extended military-jargon history. It certainly dates back at least to British officer Robert Grainger Ker Thompson, strategist of the British counter-insurgency efforts against the Malayan National Liberation Army during the Malayan Emergency, 1948-1960 (see entry). The term is also associated with General William Westmoreland and the United States' intervention in Vietnam, particularly the large force increase from 1965–1968. The term is used to convey the belief that military success can only be achieved through the direct physical presence of troops in a conflict area. As terminology, it was coined to concisely express a counter-view against the position that other means, such as aerial bombardment (as used both by Germany and the Allies in World War II, and massively by the United States in Vietnam), economic incentives, or satellite intelligence could achieve victory. The term is particularly applied currently (2010) to counter-insurgency operations. About the book Boots on the Ground... is an account of the war in Iraq with the 2nd Brigade of the 82nd Airborne as it convoys north from Kuwait to Iraq's Tallil Air Base en route to night-and-day battles within the major city of Samawah and its bridges across the Euphrates. Zinsmeister, a frontline reporter embedded with the 82nd Airborne, seeks to convey the detailed planning and technical execution that make up today's warfare. The book brings to life local firefights and the constant air-ground interactions that are one of the key innovations of modern precision combat. About the author Karl Zinsmeister wrote Boots while working as editor of The American Enterprise. In May 2006, he was appointed the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. He is a J.B. Fuqua Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where his research has spanned demographic and social trends, economics, politics, and cultural topics. In addition to The American Enterprise, he has been published in journals ranging from The Atlantic Monthly to Reader's Digest. Zinsmeister has written a number of books in addition to Boots on the Ground.

The principal sponsor of the bill was Rep. John Brademas [IN-3]. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 replaces preexisting laws (collectively referred to as the Vocational Rehabilitation Act) to extend and revise the authorization of grants to States for vocational rehabilitation services, with special emphasis on services to those with the most severe disabilities, to expand special Federal responsibilities and research and training programs with respect to individuals with disabilities, to establish special responsibilities in the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare for coordination of all programs with respect to individuals with disabilities within the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and for other purposes. The Rehabilitation Act requires affirmative action in employment by the federal government and by government contractors and prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs conducted by federal agencies, in programs receiving federal financial assistance, in federal employment, and in the employment practices of federal contractors. The standards for determining employment discrimination under the Rehabilitation Act are the same as those used in title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act. President Richard Nixon signed into law on September 26, 1973. Section 501 Section 501 requires affirmative action and nondiscrimination in employment by Federal agencies of the executive branch. To obtain more information or to file a complaint, employees should contact their agency's Equal Employment Opportunity Office. Section 503 Section 503 requires affirmative action and prohibits employment discrimination by Federal government contractors and subcontractors with contracts of more than $10,000. Section 504 Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act created and extended civil rights to people with disabilities. Section 504 has provided opportunities for children and adults with disabilities in education, employment and various other settings. It allows for reasonable accommodations such as special study area and assistance as necessary for each student. > Each Federal agency has its own set of section 504 regulations that apply to > its own programs. Agencies that provide Federal financial assistance also > have section 504 regulations covering entities that receive Federal aid. > Requirements common to these regulations include reasonable accommodation > for employees with disabilities; program accessibility; effective > communication with people who have hearing or vision disabilities; and > accessible new construction and alterations. Each agency is responsible for > enforcing its own regulations. Section 504 may also be enforced through > private lawsuits. It is not necessary to file a complaint with a Federal > agency or to receive a \\"right-to-sue\\" letter before going to court. Section 505 Section 505 contains provisions governing remedies and attorney's fees under Section 501. Section 508 Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act establishes requirements for electronic and information technology developed, maintained, procured, or used by the Federal government. Section 508 requires Federal electronic and information technology to be accessible to people with disabilities, including employees and members of the public. An accessible information technology system is one that can be operated in a variety of ways and does not rely on a single sense or ability of the user. For example, a system that provides output only in visual format may not be accessible to people with visual impairments, and a system that provides output only in audio format may not be accessible to people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Some individuals with disabilities may need accessibility-related software or peripheral devices in order to use systems that comply with Section 508. Operational administration of the disability civil rights laws Court cases occur because operational administration of the laws may be faulty in individual or related to classes (e.g., restaurant industry, sensory impairments), or there is disagreement about the law itself (e.g., definition of reasonable accommodation), in addition to other reasons (e.g., disagreement that citizens are entitled to civil rights). Experts in civil rights laws are involved in education of governments, Americans with disabilities, citizens, special interest groups (e.g., disability classes), non-profit and for-profit agencies, and community groups on the \\"application of these federal laws\\" in daily lives, including workplaces. In the area of employment law, Syracuse University's Peter Blanck, currently Executive of the Burton Blatt Institute, has offered detailed advice on the implementation of central concepts of the employment-rehabilitation laws. While the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 is the current base law, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, amended in 1978 is also cited in these legal cases, including accommodations for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.Blanck, P. (2006). The Burton Blatt Institute: Centers of innovation in disability at Syracuse University. Syracuse Law Review, 56: 201-232. Hearings at the local levels often do not recognize experts in practice, and thus legal cases repeatedly must be appealed through the federal systems. Personal assistance in the workplace has also been supported as a reasonable accommodation, a central concept in employment and disability law (Sections IV &4.8, 4.11; XI & 11.6, 11.8, 11.10; XVI & 16.7, 16.8).Solovieva, T., Walsh,R.T., Hendricks, D.J., and Dowler, D. (2010). Workplace personal assistance services for people with disabilities: Making productive employment possible. Journal of Rehabilitation, 76:3-8. The American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities has indicated that supported employment is considered to be a workplace accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (Sections IV & 4.7, 4.11; XI & 11.6, 11.8, 11.10: XVI & 16.7,16.8). Significant amendments Significant amendments were made to the Rehabilitation Act in 1974. Rehabilitation Act Amendments of 1974. The most important was the expansion of the definition of \\"handicapped individual.\\"Section 111, , Dec. 7, 1974. The original 1973 Act defined a \\"handicapped individual\\" as > any individual who (A) has a physical or mental disability which for such > individual constitutes or results in a substantial handicap to employment > and (B) can reasonably be expected to benefit in terms of employability from > vocational rehabilitation services provided pursuant to titles I and III of > this Act.Section 7(6), . The 1974 amendments substituted a much broader definition of \\"handicapped individual\\" applicable to employment by the federal government (Section 501), modification or elimination of architectural and transportation barriers (Section 502), employment by federal contractors (section 503) and to programs receiving federal financial assistance (Section 504) that was not related to employability through vocational rehabilitation services. The 1974 amendments provided a handicapped individual meant > any person who (A) has a physical or mental impairment which substantially > limits one or more of such person's major life activities, (B) has a record > of such an impairment, or (C) is regarded as having such an impairment. Congress adopted that definition in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, substituting the term \\"disability\\" for \\"handicapped.\\"Section 3(2), , July 26, 1990. In 1986, Public Law 99-506 helped the Rehabilitation Act to refine and focus services offered to those with the most severe disabilities. Supported employment was also defined as a “legitimate rehabilitation outcome”. Title four of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 amended the Rehabilitation Act in order to work with the WIA to accomplish the goal of helping people return to the workforce. Title four created a national council on disability, appointed by the president, to link rehabilitation programs to state and local workforce development systems. However, the Workforce Investment Act was repealed and replaced by the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. See also =List of court cases= *Coleman v. Schwarzenegger *Plata v.

Ikassrien's Guantanamo ISN was 72. The Department of Defense reports that Ikassrien was born on October 2, 1972, in Targist, Morocco. On June 16, 2014, he was arrested in Madrid accused of jihadism. He received a 10 year sentence, on September 30, 2016, after being convicted of recruiting individuals to go to war-torn Syria. Ikassrien alleged that he and other Guantanamo Bay detainees were tortured during their detention, and a Spanish magisterial investigation concluded that they had been subject to abusive interrogation techniques. Background When Ikassrien was first captured authorities thought his name was Reswan A. Abdesalam. His real identity was revealed through his fingerprints. Ikassrien was believed to have ties to Imad Eddin Barakat Yarkas, a mastermind of the Madrid bombing. On July 3, 2005, Ikassrien was extradited to stand trial in Spain. The International Herald Tribune reported that Ikassrien was acquitted on October 11, 2006. Spanish court acquits Moroccan who was held at Guantanamo, International Herald Tribune, October 11, 2006 =Official status reviews= Originally the Bush Presidency asserted that captives apprehended in the \\"war on terror\\" were not covered by the Geneva Conventions, and could be held indefinitely, without charge, and without an open and transparent review of the justifications for their detention. In 2004 the United States Supreme Court ruled, in Rasul v. Bush, that Guantanamo captives were entitled to being informed of the allegations justifying their detention, and were entitled to try to refute them. =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= Combatant Status Review Tribunals were held in a 3x5 meter trailer where the captive sat with his hands and feet shackled to a bolt in the floor.Guantánamo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guantánamo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 Following the Supreme Court's ruling, the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants. Combatant status review Initially, the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror. This policy was challenged before the Judicial branch. Critics argued that the USA could not evade its obligation to conduct competent tribunals to determine whether captives are, or are not, entitled to the protections of prisoner of war status. Subsequently, the Department of Defense instituted the Combatant Status Review Tribunals. The Tribunals, however, were not authorized to determine whether the captives were lawful combatants—rather they were merely empowered to make a recommendation as to whether the captive had previously been correctly determined to match the Bush administration's definition of an enemy combatant. =Allegations= The following allegations were presented to his Tribunal: =Transcript= There is no record that Lahcen Ikassrien chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal. Torture  On November 19, 2006, El País published an article in which Ikassrien alleges that he had been tortured repeatedly over the course of a month during his detention in Kandahar. He alleges that he was subjected to various forms of torture, including being trapped with aggressive dogs, being tied up, and that soldiers held him in a cage where they showered him with feces and urine while calling him \\"Animal No. 64\\". Torture claims investigation On April 29, 2009, that Spanish investigating magistrate Baltasar Garzon initiated a formal investigation into whether confessions from Ikassrien, and three other former Guantanamo captives were the result of the use of abusive interrogation techniques. Ikassrien, and the other three men: Hamed Abderrahman Ahmed, Jamiel Abdul Latif al Banna and Omar Deghayes, had previously faced charges in Spanish courts, based on confessions they made while in US custody. Their charges had been dropped based on their claims that their confessions were false and were the result of abusive interrogation techniques. See also * The Bush Six * Torture * Imran v.

His research on Permian igneous rocks (286 to 245 million years ago) of the Oslo district greatly advanced petrologic theory on the formation of rocks. Biography He was born in Christiania (now Oslo), Norway. He was the son of Anton Wilhelm Brøgger (1820–82) and Oline (“Lina”) Marie Bjerring (1826–1905). He attended Oslo Cathedral School and graduated in 1870. He studied science and zoology under Theodor Kjerulf at University of Christiania (now University of Oslo). He was Cand. filos. (1870) and delivered his dissertation in 1875. Brøgger was then immediately employed in the Norwegian Geological Survey as an assistant. In the winter of 1875–76, he made a study trip together with fellow student Hans Reusch (1852–1922) to Corsica and Elba. The two jointly published an illustrated work, Jættegryder ved Christiania (Copenhagen. 1874) which was also published in German and English. He became an amanuensis at the Stockholm University mineral cabinet (1876) and research fellow (1878). From 1881 to 1890, he was professor of mineralogy and geology at Stockholm University. From 1890 to 1916 was Professor of Mineralogy and Palaeontology in the University of Christiania. He was Dean of the Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences (1899-1902) and became rector of the senate of University of Christiania (1907-1911). His observations on the igneous rocks of South Tyrol compared with those of Christiania afford much information on the relations of the granitic and basic rocks. The subject of the differentiation of rock-types in the process of solidification as plutonic or volcanic rocks from a particular magma received much attention from him. He dealt also with the Palaeozoic rocks of Norway, and with the late glacial and post-glacial changes of sea level in the Christiania region. He is credited for proposing that pegmatites form through the interaction of silicate melt and supercritical water. Credit for this discovery is often given to Richard H. Jahns.

He was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of the White Rose of Finland, was commander of the first class of the Swedish Order of the North Star and a knight of the Order of Dannebrog. He was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences from 1890 and a fellow of the Royal Society. The honorary degree of Ph.D. was conferred upon him by the University of Heidelberg and that of LL.D. by the University of Glasgow in 1901. He was awarded the Murchison Medal in 1891 and the Wollaston Medal in 1911, both by the Geological Society of London. Personal life He was married in 1878 to Antonie Sophie Wilhelmine Scheel Siewers (1854–1933). He died in Olso during 1940 and was buried at Vår Frelsers gravlund.

Over the course of their career, they released six full- length albums, including one for the major label East West, and broke up twice (in 1996 and 2006). The band reformed once again in 2013. Biography =Early career and To the Gory End (1988–1990)= Cancer was formed one night in 1988 in the Tontine public house in Ironbridge, Telford by drummer Carl Stokes, guitarist John Walker and bassist Ian Buchanan.Cancer biography @ www.tothegoryend.co.uk (archived) The band quickly put together their first two-track demo, No Fuckin' Cover, at the Pits studio in Birmingham, owned by ex-Starfighters vocalist Steve Burton. The demo was produced by Stevie Young (nephew of AC/DC's Angus Young) and engineered by \\"Big\\" Mick Hughes (live sound engineer for Metallica).Cancer biography @ Rockdetector The band also began playing live, starting with their first gig in Birmingham opening for Bomb Disneyland, and including shows with the likes of Bolt Thrower, Cerebral Fix and GBH. A second demo session was recorded in 1989, and was followed shortly by the bootleg live album Bloodbath in the Acid, recorded at Wrexham Memorial Hall and pressed on the Headache label. However, No Fuckin' Cover had secured Cancer a deal with Vinyl Solution and in Winter 1989 the band recorded their debut album, To the Gory End, over four days at Loco Studios in Usk. The record was then mixed by Scott Burns (record producer) at Morrisound Studios, with backing vocals from John Tardy (of Obituary) added to the track \\"Die, Die\\", and released in April 1990. The band followed it up with tours with Obituary and Deicide. =Death Shall Rise and The Sins of Mankind (1991–1993)= Cancer started preparing material for their second album at Reel to Reel Studios in Telford with engineer Tony Higley, and in February 1991 flew out to Florida to begin recording Death Shall Rise with Scott Burns at Morrisound. They enlisted the skills of James Murphy (of Agent Steel and Obituary) on lead guitar, and Deicide's Glen Benton to provide backing vocals for lead track \\"Hung, Drawn and Quartered\\". Released in April 1991, the album would go on to gain a certain amount of notoriety owing to being banned in Germany, whose state body for censorship of works likely to be dangerous to youth considered that the cover art would incite youngsters to incite violence upon each other. The album would also subsequently go on to be placed No. 27 in Terrorizer's Top 40 Death Metal Albums.Stenning, Paul. \\"Death MetalThe DM Top 40\\", Terrorizer No. 151, 2006, p.54. Throughout May, Cancer toured throughout the UK supported by Unleashed and Desecrator, then returned to USA for an appearance at the 1991 Milwaukee Metal Festival and further touring in support of Deicide and Obituary. James Murphy left the band in December 1991 to form Disincarnate and was replaced by Barry Savage. This was followed by further touring throughout the USA, Mexico, Israel and Europe. The band recorded their third album, The Sins of Mankind, with Simon Efemey at the Windings in Wrexham in December 1992. Following its release through Vinyl Solution in June 1993, Cancer embarked on a European tour with openers Cerebral Fix. Problems arose when drummer Stokes was involved in an accident when his motorbike collided with a British Telecom van, leading to the band enlisting Nicholas Barker (later of Cradle of Filth and Dimmu Borgir) for further live shows. =Black Faith and split (1994–1996)= In 1994, Cancer left Vinyl Solution to sign to major label East West for worldwide distribution, one of the first death metal bands to do so. They entered Great Linford Studios in Milton Keynes, again with Simon Efemey at the helm, to record their fourth effort, Black Faith; the record was later mixed at Pink Floyd's Brittania Row Studios. Despite Stokes allegedly using a human thigh bone for percussion on \\"Temple Song\\", the record received decidedly mixed reviews; some compared the Black Faith material to mid-period Metallica,Strong, M.C. The Great Metal Discography (2nd edition), , 2001, p.100. whilst others considered it a \\"poor man's Heartwork\\".Patterson, Dayal. \\"Death MetalUK\\", Terrorizer No. 150, 2006, p.51. Following a short European tour with support act Meshuggah, Cancer decided to call it a day, citing \\"a lack of faith from certain key individuals in the industry and Major Label Bullshit\\". =Reunion (2013–present)= On 12 September 2013, it was announced that the original lineup of Cancer was reuniting to promote their first three albums (To the Gory End, Death Shall Rise and The Sins of Mankind) which are being re-released by Cyclone Empire Records later this year. They were also planning to make a number of festival appearances, where they would only play songs from the aforementioned albums. On 22 September 2015, Cancer revealed on their Facebook page that they have been working on new material. In July 2018, they signed to Peaceville Records and would release their new album, tentatively titled Shadow Gripped, late in the year. In August 2018, Shadow Gripped was confirmed as the title of the band's next album, which was released on 2 November 2018.

The character originally appeared on the show regularly between 22 April 1986 and 3 October 2005. During that time he was first played as a baby by Richard Smith from 1986 and 1989 before the role was taken over by Christopher Smith from 1989 and 2001. In 2001, Karl Davies took over the role in order for the character to become involved in more adult storylines, as he grew older. Davies briefly reprised his role as Robert for one episode airing on 10 February 2009, when he returned for the funeral of his father and longest running character Jack Sugden (Clive Hornby). The character returned on 23 October 2014 with actor Ryan Hawley taking over the role. During his first stint, Robert has embarked on a longstanding feud with his adopted brother Andy (Kelvin Fletcher) after discovering he started the fire that killed their mother Sarah (Alyson Spiro). Their rivalry led to the events of Robert having an affair with Andy's wife Katie (Sammy Winward), whom he later cheated on by sleeping with her rival Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), and culminated with him causing the tragic death of Max (Charlie Kemp) after the pair tried to kill each other by running the other down in their own vehicle. Robert subsequently left the village to avoid going to prison for Max's death, but came back briefly for Jack's funeral in February 2009. The character returned to the series on 23 October 2014, and became the show's main antagonist throughout 2015. During that year, Robert had an affair Aaron Livesy (Danny Miller) – which led to the events of Robert killing Katie on the day he married Chrissie White (Louise Marwood); embarking on a feud with Aaron's mother Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and adopted father Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt); getting beat up and blackmailed by Chas' brother Cain (Jeff Hordley); and being shot by Aaron's ex-partner-in-crime Ross Barton (Michael Parr) in the Who Shot Robert Sugden? storyline, in the light of his affair with Aaron and role in Katie's death both getting exposed. Following his shooting, Robert became one of the show's major protagonists as his relationship with Aaron dominated the events of the series. This long-running story arc involved Robert supporting Aaron upon discovering that he was sexually abused by his father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), as a child; becoming engaged to Aaron and later surprising him with an unofficial wedding between them in 2017; bonding with Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele), and temporally becoming her guardian after Aaron is arrested and sentenced to 12 months in prison – which involved Robert struggling to cope with Aaron's drug use amid serving his prison sentence; their marriage having a breakdown after Robert ends up sleeping with Chrissie's sister Rebecca (Emily Head); and the pair remarrying in 2018 after Robert and Aaron manage to reunite and reconcile over their differences. During this time, Robert's storyline with Andy and the Whites concluded with him and Andy making amends after the pair nearly killed each other in a car-game of chicken; Robert clearing Andy's name after Chrissie framed the latter for shooting her father Lawrence (John Bowe), with the culprit being her son Lachlan (Thomas Atkinson); his one-stand with Rebecca that results in her getting pregnant and giving birth to their son Sebastian; his scheme to con the Whites in a revenge plot; kidnapping Sebastian when he found out that Rebecca and her family were planning to emigrate with his son without his knowledge, which led to the events of Lachlan causing the deaths of Chrissie and Lawrence in a road collision; being held hostage by Lachlan after he and his girlfriend, Cain's half-brother Belle (Eden Taylor-Draper), discover that Lachlan had killed their friend Gerry Roberts (Shaun Thomas) and allegedly murdered his false uncle Paul Tozer (Daniel Casey) for discovering that he caused the deaths of his mother and grandmother; nursing Rebecca from her trauma of being kidnapped by Lachlan for months and later allowing her to leave the village with Sebastian to start anew with Ross, her new boyfriend; and supporting his sister Victoria (Isabel Hodgins) after learning that she had been raped by car salesman Lee Posner (Kris Mochrie). In the latter storyline, Robert ends up killing Lee after hospitalising him in retaliation for denying to have perpetuated Victoria's rape ordeal – which sparks the events of the character's impending departure from the show when Robert, after being detained and later pleading guilty to Lee's attack prior to his death, goes on the run to avoid going to prison for the murder he unintentionally committed. Storylines =1986–2009= Robert Sugden was born on 22 April 1986 by his birth mother Pat (Helen Weir), who raised him together with his father Jack. He is their youngest child and soon has three older siblings, a brother Jackie (Ian Sharrock), a half-sister Sandie Merrick (Jane Hutcheson) and a half-brother Tommy Merrick. When Robert was four months old, his mother was killed in a car crash and his brother, Jackie, was killed in a shooting accident when he was three. Sandie also leaves the village for Scotland, and Robert loses contact with his maternal family. After Pat's death, Robert stays with his father who brings him up alone for the next two years but gets a new mother figure in Sarah Connolly (Madeleine Howard), whom Jack starts dating in 1988 and later marries in May 1994. Robert's half-sister, Victoria (Jessica Haywood), is born the same year. Throughout his childhood, he is happy with his little family unit – Jack and Sarah and then Victoria. 1994 was a tough year for Robert as his uncle nearly killed himself. His little sister, Victoria Anne Sugden, has a hole in her heart and is hospitalized. Sarah, his mother, in the hospital suffers from depression and has an emotional affair to get back at Jack. Meanwhile, Jack was left with a young Robert and as he tries to save his family, things go wrong and the year hurts Robert a great deal. When things start to look up for the family, Sarah gets a job and Jack thought she is having an affair. Robert feels alone as he has no friends at school and his father doesn't listen to his issues and this leads him to running away to Derek Simpson, leaving Jack and Sarah worried half to death. He grows a close bond to Derek Simpson after spending three days in the cold. Derek is a hermit who was in the Army. He later returns home through Derek's request, who goes to prison. This leads to Robert changing a bit. In 1996, Robert befriends Andy Hopwood (Kelvin Fletcher), a boy the same age in the care of the local authority whilst his father Billy (David Crellin) is in prison for robbery and manslaughter. Robert takes Andy to a local quarry where Andy traps his foot under a rock. Robert runs to get help and Biff Fowler (Stuart Wade) rescues Andy. When Andy's grandmother (Beatrice Kelly) dies, Jack and Sarah (now Alyson Spiro) foster him so he moves in with the Sugdens. Robert begins to resent Andy's presence and is unhappy at having to share his home and belongings. Despite this, Robert defends Andy when they are bullied by Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth) and punches her. Donna tries to blame Robert for the bullying but no one believes her so she is suspended from school. After leading Donna astray, Robert and Andy take her joyriding in Leeds, causing a feud between the Sugden and Windsor families. Robert's life is rocked when he discovers that his father is having an affair with Rachel Hughes (Glenda McKay) in 1997. Robert catches Jack and Rachel kissing. Horrified, Jack ends it, but abandons the family. Jack grows disappointed in Robert as he doesn't want to work on the farm and hits him and the dynamic changes. Robert's life seems to be back on track, but in 2000 Sarah, has an affair with Richie Carter (Glenn Lamont), and leaves Jack for Richie, taking Victoria with her. Robert sides with Sarah over his father but Jack wins custody, as Sarah is not his biological mother. Robert stays with Kathy Glover (Malandra Burrows) and tells her that he intends to leave home when he is sixteen. On 16 November 2000, Robert returns to the farm to collect some belongings and discovers the barn is on fire. Sarah is inside and subsequently dies, devastating him. Jack is arrested and stands trial for her murder but is acquitted. Robert discovers that Andy started the fire and disgusted by this, he goes to Spain in May 2001 to stay with his grandmother Annie Brearly (Sheila Mercier), and her husband Amos (Ronald Magill). Robert (now Karl Davies), returns in August 2001. Wanting rid of Andy, Robert starts taunting him about his love life. He tries to cause problems between Andy and his girlfriend Katie Addyman (Sammy Winward) but is unsuccessful. In September 2001, Robert and Andy go on a night out in Leeds with Katie, Donna, Ollie (Vicky Binns) and Marc Reynolds (Anthony Lewis), and Eve Birch (Raine Davison). When Andy is refused entry to a nightclub, the teenagers miss their bus home and Andy steals a car to drive home. On their way back, they run over and kill their headmistress Barbara Strickland (Alex Hall). Robert suggests they cover their tracks and subsequently burn the car. However, the truth eventually comes out. Marc is jailed and the other teenagers receive community service. After Andy taunts him over not having a girlfriend, Robert loses his virginity to Nicola Blackstock (Nicola Wheeler), a 24-year-old woman, shortly after his sixteenth birthday. Nicola dumps him the following day when she invites him round to her house in order for him to discover her having sex with Syd Woolfe (Nathan Gladwell). After leaving school, Robert gets a job working as a mechanic at Scott Windsor's (Ben Freeman) garage. After having sex with her in the back of his car, Robert starts dating Scott's sister, Donna. Feeling he is in need of more excitement in his life, he also starts secretly dating Elaine Marsden (Samantha McCarthy). However, Donna finds out about Robert's cheating and dumps him. Robert continues his romance with Elaine, but in September 2003, he and Elaine are in a car accident while Robert is driving. Panicking, Robert flees the scene, leaving Elaine unconscious in the car. Robert manages to lie his way out of trouble, as Elaine has no memory of how the accident happened. She later realizes the truth when she sees bruising from the seat belt across his chest, which suggests that Robert was driving, not her as Robert told everyone. In December 2003, Elaine and her family leave the village. Robert and Donna reconcile that month. Despite this, Robert still wants excitement in his life and begins an affair with Katie, now Andy's fiancée. Robert and Katie are caught by Andy's half-brother, Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor), in January 2004 when he sees them kissing in the garage. Katie threatens Daz, telling him he will be put into care if he says anything. Daz tells Andy but Katie convinces him that Daz is lying and is too much for them to cope with so he is returned to foster care. Victoria (now Hannah Midgley) also catches them together. Robert swears her to secrecy and Katie threatens her so she becomes too scared to talk and uses a puppet to speak through instead. Feeling guilty, Katie ends the affair the day before her wedding to Andy in February 2004, leaving him devastated. However, they resume the affair after the wedding, despite Robert's reconciliation with Donna. They intend to run away together but Robert insists they tell Andy the truth when he finds Katie's farewell note, leaving him distraught. Donna is also devastated by the revelation and feels betrayed by her boyfriend and best friend. The aftermath of the affair leads to Andy waiting in Robert's caravan with a shotgun, planning to kill them both. However, he accidentally shoots Jack instead, leaving him fighting for his life. Robert initially refuses to forgive Andy but when he realizes that he is responsible for the situation, they reconcile and embrace in the hospital. Jack survives the gunshot wound and sticks to the coverup story the boys told the police, but unable to see Andy unpunished for trying to do sush a thing to Robert disowns him and he returns alone to Butler's Farm. Robert also continues his relationship with Katie. In early 2005, Robert proposes to Katie and she accepts, and the pair plan to marry later that year. However, Robert is seduced by Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), a woman sixteen years his senior. Robert and Sadie embark on an affair and Robert thinks he can keep it a secret. However, Daz sees Robert kissing Sadie and he tells Andy who confronts Robert in the garage and attacks him. He tries to force Robert to tell Katie about his affair with Sadie, but Robert insists that Andy is lying. Katie eventually learns the truth when she finds erotic text messages on Robert's phone from Sadie. Heartbroken, Katie ends the relationship and Andy comforts her, leading to them sleeping together. Robert vows to get revenge on Andy, and helps Jimmy King (Nick Miles) and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), set fire to the barn at Butler's Farm. Robert sees Jimmy and Cain beat up Andy and stops them. Daz accidentally stabs Jimmy with a pitchfork while trying to protect Andy. Robert and Cain take Jimmy away and Jimmy's brother, Max (Charlie Kemp), patches him up at the vets. However, the truth soon comes out and Jack throws Robert out, disowning him and calls him a traitor. Robert and Andy's feud is reignited by this, leading Katie to leave the village in June 2005, so Robert starts dating Debbie Dingle (Charley Webb), the mother of Andy's daughter, Sarah (Lilly-Mae Bartley). Robert and Debbie plan to go to London, along with Max who was leaving the village after poisoning cows belonging to the Briggs family for his father, Tom (Ken Farrington). However, on the day that they plan to leave in October 2005, Andy finds out about Robert and Debbie's plan and forces her to tell him where she is going to meet Robert, he goes there and confronts him, and they start fighting. Max is forced to separate them and Robert tells Debbie that he doesn't care about her and was only interested in her because of Sarah and wanted to hurt Andy by taking his daughter away. Debbie leaves and returns to the village, heartbroken. Max decides not to go with Robert and asks Andy to drive him to the railway station. Filled with rage, Robert turns the car round and accelerates, driving straight at Andy's Land Rover. Max panics and grabs hold of the steering wheel. The Land Rover goes off the road and rolls onto its roof. Robert parks his car, gets out and rescues Andy but the Land Rover explodes before he can rescue Max. Max is killed and Jack arrives just after the accident and Robert tells him what happened. Jack calls the emergency services and tells Robert to leave. Robert gets into his car and drives away. Robert is last seen at a service station, ordering some food and tells the waitress that he intends on travelling whichever direction his car is pointing. Four years later, Robert returns on 10 February 2009, the day of his father's funeral. Robert visits Butler's Farm, and meets Natasha Wylde (Amanda Donohoe), who is on her horse and thinks Robert is an intruder. He explains that his father's funeral is taking place and watches from a distance, and Andy sees him. Andy tries to persuade Robert to stay and run the farm, but Robert tells Andy that he doesn't belong there any more, before driving off. Robert returns to the cemetery after nightfall, and lays a rose on his Jack's grave, before leaving. =2014–2019= Five years later, Robert (now Ryan Hawley) returns and moves into Home Farm with his fiancée, Chrissie White (Louise Marwood) and her father Lawrence White (John Bowe).

Robert thinks he will die the same way as his mother but is relieved when nothing happens. Robert asks Aaron to run away with him to Manchester, but Aaron refuses.

He goes back and turns it off when he realises that Paddy might die. He hears Andy when attempting to save Paddy and flees, leaving Andy to deal with the situation. As Paddy lies in the hospital, Robert then threatens to harm his son Leo if Paddy says anything.

With nowhere else to go Robert stays at Val and Eric's B&B.; In the following weeks, at the scrapyard, Chrissie desperately tries to get Robert to sign the divorce papers and to sign everything over to her and Lawrence, however Robert refuses so Chrissie pours petrol all over his car. She then lights a cigarette lighter and burns his car. Once Robert thinks he's put out the flames they leave arguing, while the fire spreads to a nearby car that Adam is sleeping in.

However, Connor calls the police lying that Lawrence assaulted him, leading to Lawrence being in trouble with the police. Robert is shot and placed in a coma. There are numerous suspects. When Robert wakes up, he is told that Aaron shot him. Robert struggles to believe it and accuses Andy and Chrissie of shooting him and framing Aaron. Robert attends Aaron's plea hearing and he goads Aaron to tell the truth, only for Aaron to lash out and say he should have done everyone a favour and died. Robert is left a voicemail by Ashley, who calls him instead of Andy, saying that he wants to know what deal Andy had made and why he cannot let an innocent man go down. Robert confronts Andy, who admits to being involved in his shooting. Robert and Andy drive their cars at each other, only Robert swerves leading both of them to crash. Robert saves Andy from his burning car and they call a truce. Robert calls the police and gives them a false description of his shooter to free Aaron. Once Aaron is released from prison he tells Robert that he hates him. On New Year's Eve Robert finds out Ross shot him as a result of his deal with Andy. Robert vengefully confronts Ross with a gun until Debbie and Andy walk in. Robert tells Debbie what Ross did and she decides to leave the village the next day with the kids, leaving Andy and Ross devastated. Andy angrily confronts Robert, telling him he wins again.

Chas enlists Robert's help to speed things up but grows impatient and vandalises Gordon's car by spraying \\"Paedo\\" on it. Robert explains that this isn't helping and takes her home. Robert manages to track down Aaron's stepmother Sandra Livesy (Joanne Mitchell) who has changed her name to Flaherty. He and Aaron go to see if she can help. Arriving there Aaron needs some time to pluck up the courage to say what he needs to so he and Robert take a walk which leads to them reconnecting, but they agree to take things slow. A young thief tries to make off with Aaron's wallet and Robert gives chase earning him a knee to the groin. They later learn that the thief is Aaron's half-sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele). Aaron pleads with Sandra to help him and, after initially feigning ignorance, Aaron works out that she knew about the abuse the whole time. He grows angry with his former stepmother but she still refuses to help him. Back at the Woolpack Aaron is fearful that he has ruined his chances of convicting his father. The police inform Aaron that another male victim has come forward. It is revealed that Robert is paying Gordon's neighbour Ryan (George Sampson) to lie that Gordon abused him as well. After Gordon accuses Chas of paying Ryan, Robert confesses to Chas that he was the person who found Ryan to help in Aaron's case. Two days later Ryan arrives at the pub.

Robert blames himself and is prepared to hand himself in to the police but Aaron tells him he doesn't want him going to prison for trying to help him. DS Wise (Neil Roberts) visits the pub. When Robert is about to confess Chas covers for him by saying that this is another one of Gordon's lies. While this is going on Robert learns that Chrissie has begun a relationship with his brother Andy. This riles Robert but also irritates Aaron as Robert's attentions are elsewhere when he needs him the most. A week later Aaron tells Robert not to come to court so Robert goes the next day when he is taking the stand. On the stand Robert insists Aaron wouldn't lie about something of this magnitude and admits publicly to his feelings for Aaron.

After the first night he stays, Chas seems elated to see him at breakfast the following morning and he and Aaron discuss taking a trip somewhere to get away from it all. He later turns up with two tickets for them to go to Barcelona for the weekend but is disheartened when they can't go due to Liv turning up, wanting to stay at the Woolpack with Aaron.

Robert asks Chrissie's sister, Rebecca White (Emily Head) to come to the village to help him with his vendetta against Chrissie. She sends a DNA test off to prove Lawrence is not Chrissie's biological father. When the topic of marriage comes up Aaron is embarrassed when Robert jokingly dismisses the idea. After rejecting Rebecca's advances Robert confides in Victoria that he is going to propose to Aaron. Robert asks Paddy for his blessing to marry Aaron, but Paddy tells him that he's not good enough for Aaron. Rebecca meets Robert at the scrap yard to apologise for making advances towards him.

Robert tries to keep himself and Aaron calm and makes several attempts to free him but Aaron tearfully begs Robert to go and tells him he loves him before slipping under the water. Robert screams in horror and refuses to give up, going under the water to give Aaron air before making a final attempt to free him. Adam and Victoria arrive at the scene to see Robert dragging Aaron to the surface. He desperately administers CPR and Aaron spits out water as a paramedic arrives. Robert then dives back into the lake to save Lachlan, unaware that the teen had already freed himself from the boot and is watching from a distance. Adam heads to the hospital with Aaron while Vic stays behind to wait for Robert. When Robert rises from the water again, he desperately asks Vic how Aaron is. She tells him Adam went with him to the hospital and it didn't look good.

They keep vigil at Aaron's bedside and Aaron wakes and whispers to Robert \\"Yeah\\" accepting his proposal. With tears in his eyes Robert gently slips the ring onto Aaron's finger. Aaron's eyes close and the heart monitor starts beeping. Chas runs to get help and Robert and Liv watch in fear as Aaron fights for his life, but happily survives. Robert spends the night by Aaron's bedside and is relieved when he wakes up. They discuss the aftermath of the crash, including Lachlan's escape and James' death. Aaron notices the engagement ring on his finger and asks Robert if marriage is definitely what he wants. Robert responds by tenderly touching the scars on Aaron's arm, reminding Aaron that he almost lost him once already, that he couldn't bear the thought of it happening again and he wants to be with him forever. Moved by this, Aaron asks Robert to marry him. Robert immediately agrees and they kiss. Adam and Vic drop by the hospital and Vic gives Aaron the second engagement ring. He slips it onto Robert's finger making their engagement official. Chas and Liv also visit to celebrate the good news. Later, at the pub, Robert runs into Rebecca and lets her know that Lachlan knows about their past affair. Rebecca promises to help by finding evidence against Chrissie and Lachlan to secure Andy's freedom and also offers Robert shares of her inheritance, which he accepts as he has a wedding to plan. The next day Lachlan tells Chrissie about Robert and Rebecca in front of the entire pub. Robert assures Liv that Aaron already knows. Two days later, still reeling from the bombshell of Rebecca and Robert's fling, Chrissie confronts Robert in the pub and after winding her up about Rebecca and hinting that Lawrence once had a crush on him, Robert promises he will make her life hell for what she did to Andy. Robert and Aaron gather with the rest of the village to pay their final respects to James. During the burial Aaron takes Robert's hand for comfort. At the wake Victoria's unimpressed with Rebecca offering to buy everyone drinks to gain popularity. Robert assures her Rebecca's on their side. Rebecca finds evidence from the shooting which was used to frame Andy and shows it to Robert. He wants to go to the police with it but she tells him she wants to do it her way. Later Robert and Aaron go to the Home Farm bonfire night where Rebecca publicly accuses Chrissie of framing Andy. Diane is horrified when she learns the truth and is angry with Robert for keeping it from her. Robert is upset that even if they can clear Andy's name, he has no way of letting him know. Rebecca arrives at the pub with an incriminating video of Lachlan which Diane hopes will be evidence enough to make Chrissie and Lachlan pay. The next day Diane and Robert wait for news from the police regarding the video footage of Lachlan. Robert voices his concerns it might not be enough but Diane reminds him that she promised Jack she would look after his children. She later goes to Home Farm and warns the Whites they won't get away with what they did to Andy. Robert is livid when Lawrence threatens to evict Diane after she stages a protest outside Home Farm. Later Rebecca comes to apologise for her father and Robert instructs her to get back her family's trust so they can carry out their revenge plan against them. Robert is left reeling when Diane is arrested for hitting Lachlan. Robert thanks Rebecca for getting Lawrence to change his mind about evicting Diane. Aaron is jealous when he spots them together and despite Robert's protestations that his involvement with Rebecca is strictly business and purely to get Andy home, Aaron believes she has other motives and tells Robert to stay away from her. Later, at the pub, as they reminisce, Rebecca kisses Robert. He gently pushes her back and reminds her they need to stick to their plan. It's not about them – it's not even about Andy – it's about Home Farm, at which point Diane walks in with a darkened expression on her face leaving Robert worried about what she may have overheard. The next day, Robert lays flowers at his mum's grave as Aaron watches on. Diane then arrives and voices her disapproval of Robert scheming with Rebecca to get their hands on Home Farm. Robert defends his actions, saying Chrissie deserves to lose everything after what she did to Andy but Diane coldly informs her stepson that Sarah would have been heartbroken to see what he's become, leaving Robert stunned and hurt. After some coercion from Rebecca, Lachlan decides to hand him himself into the police where he is charged with attempted murder and perverting the course of justice. Robert excitedly tells Diane the news and they hope it will finally get Andy exonerated. Robert and Aaron prepare for Lachlan's plea hearing, discussing the possibility of finally clearing Andy's name as well as their wedding plans. Robert receives a text from Rebecca saying she needs to see him urgently. Aaron asks why they can't be done with her and Robert reminds him of their Home Farm deal and insists the extra money will be useful. Diane comes to see Robert and apologises for the comments she made about Sarah. Robert reiterates to her that even though his underhand tactics against Chrissie may not be agreeable, all he really wants is to get Andy home. Rebecca meets Robert at the pub and blackmails him into breaking Lachlan out of prison, saying she'll tell Aaron about their recent kiss if he doesn't comply. They arrive at court where Rebecca sets off the alarm, causing the building to be evacuated but before Robert can get to Lachlan. Robert gets a call from Aaron, bringing him to his senses, he decides to abandon the plan. When Rebecca confronts him, still threatening to tell Aaron about the kiss, Robert tells her he used her and never hid his relationship with Aaron and only wants him, leaving her devastated. Back at the pub Aaron informs Robert that Lachlan pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice. Robert is satisfied with the result and tells Aaron the deal with Rebecca is off. The next day Robert brushes Rebecca off when she comes to see him, saying they have nothing to talk about anymore. Rebecca then turns her attentions to Aaron and tells him about the kiss but is shocked when he calmly calls her bluff, saying he already knew about Robert playing her before telling her she isn't a threat and to get over herself. Humiliated, Rebecca walks off in tears. In the back room, Robert assures Aaron he was indeed playing Rebecca all along in order to help Andy and also tells him about the failed breakout attempt for Lachlan. Aaron is incredulous but Robert promises him he changed his mind because he couldn't risk losing him. Frustrated, Aaron keeps trying to leave the room but Robert passionately defends himself, reiterating what he said a month ago – being bisexual doesn't mean he will cheat and it's because he's changed out of his love for Aaron before telling him maybe he needs to change too. The next day, things are still tense between the Robert and Aaron. Charity and Chas moan about the couple's constant bickering as well as how overcrowded the pub is which prompts Liv to ask Aaron and Robert why they can't get their own place. Later that evening, Robert looks for flats for the three of them and Joanie mentions that The Mill is up for auction. Liv offers to chip in using her inheritance but Aaron flat out refuses to use Gordon's money. Robert tells Aaron that having some security is just what Liv needs and the move would be good for them all. They bring up their argument from the previous day and have an honest discussion about everything. Robert assures Aaron of his feelings for him and they kiss. Robert agrees to help Rebecca secure a business deal in order to help Aaron get a deposit for a house and is later delighted when Aaron, after a discussion with Rebecca which leads to them setting their differences aside, decides to use the inheritance money to buy The Mill. Robert enjoys his first Christmas with Aaron, Liv and the rest of the Dingles. With Rebecca's help, Robert plans a surprise trip to Vegas for Aaron's birthday. He meets Aaron at the pub but Chrissie attempts to ruin the mood by reminding Aaron of Robert's past infidelity and warns it will happen again. Robert tells his ex-wife she is bitter and pathetic then takes Aaron into the back room which he has decorated in the theme of Vegas and excitedly tells him about their trip. Sensing Aaron is a little shaken after Chrissie's comments, Robert assures him he loves him but is upset when Aaron lets slip that he already knew about the trip after confronting Rebecca, thinking Robert was cheating on him. Robert tells Aaron they can't keep having the same argument about trust and asks him to believe in him. Robert then tells him that in exchange for the trip to Vegas, Rebecca needs his help at Home Farm during Lawrence's absence which requires an overnight stay to negotiate a business deal. Panicking, Aaron tells Robert he booked a weekend away in Manchester for them both and offers to cancel it but Robert instantly forgoes his business deal in order to be with him. Robert attends Lachlan's trial with Diane, Victoria and Bernice where they express their disgust at Chrissie for not admitting to framing Andy and letting her son take the fall for everything. Lachlan is acquitted of attempted murder but the judge reminds the teen that he had already pleaded guilty to perjury and is therefore remanded in custody, leaving the Whites in shock and the Sugdens delighted with the result. Following a suggestion from Charity, Robert and Aaron flip a coin and decide to have a secret wedding in Vegas. However, the next day, Robert is celebrating a business deal with Rebecca when Aaron bursts in. Fed up with his insecurity and jealousy, this leads to a heated argument between the pair, after which Robert tells Aaron he can't do this anymore and removes his engagement ring. Later that night, after a chat with Vic, Robert tells Aaron he doesn't want to give up on them but they are interrupted by the police who arrest Aaron for attacking Finn's love interest Kasim. Aaron is released on bail the next day and offers Robert the chance to walk away for good but Robert promises to stick by him. Robert grows concern for Aaron as his court day approaches quickly and learns that Aaron is more worried about who will look after Liv while he is inside. Robert plans a surprise wedding for him and Aaron the day before his sentencing to give Aaron more security about their family. Robert, Chas, and the Dingles keep Aaron away from the Woolpack while they decorate it for the ceremony. Paddy expresses his disapproval when he finds out, but Robert doesn't back down and Chas convinces him to accept their marriage. However just as the wedding is about to take place, the police raid the pub with a woman claiming that Faith killed her father. The wedding is then thrown in chaos as Faith runs off and is later arrested. This causes Robert to walk off as he wanted the day to be perfect. Aaron catches up to him outside the garage (where they first had sex) with the rings and they have their own ceremony in there. At the reception, Aaron tells Robert that he is worried about going to prison and doesn't want to leave him. Robert says that when it's over they can put it behind them and move on and they hug each other. Aaron is sentenced to a year in prison. Early on he is singled out by another prisoner, Jason, and develops a drug addiction to cope with the stress. Robert and Chas visit Aaron and are shocked at the changes. Robert is further dismayed when Aaron tells him to forget about him. Hurt over his husband's rejection, Robert gets drunk, destroys his and Aaron's home, and seeks comfort from Rebecca, telling her that he and Aaron are over. They sleep together, but Robert immediately regrets it the next morning. He tells Chas who furiously slaps him. The next time they visit Aaron, Robert nearly tells him what happened, but Chas covers for him. Aaron is released early after his appeal succeeds and Robert is excited to have him back. The two begin to repair their relationship when Robert learns that Rebecca is pregnant. He tries to keep the news from Aaron, and Rebecca's boyfriend Ross attempts to blackmail him into paying him to keep quiet about the baby, leading to a feud between the two of them. Robert admits his one night stand and Rebecca's pregnancy to Aaron. After some consternation, Aaron decides to forgive Robert and try to move on. Robert tries to force Rebecca to have an abortion, but she refuses. He wants nothing to do with the child but Aaron convinces him to go to an ultrasound where it is discovered that Rebecca is carrying a boy. However, Aaron's negative feelings about Robert, Rebecca, and the baby begin to impact him. He starts taking drugs, resumes self-harming, and even attacks Robert. Aaron later comes clean about his struggles and admits that he hates the baby. After an emotionally charged conversation, Aaron despondently ends their relationship, admitting that although he does love Robert he cannot be with him anymore. Giving Robert his ring back and telling him to go, the pair part ways. The next day, in spite of Robert attempting to show Aaron that they can still be together, Aaron admits that he doesn't want to be the needy angry person he is anymore and decides to visit Liv and his mother in Ireland to get away. Missing Aaron, Robert decides to try and take over Home Farm. He gets Rebecca to bring him back into the business and impacts Lawrence's health by spiking his drinks with drugs. He even manipulates Lawrence into thinking that they have slept together, makes him believe that he murdered Tim Richards (Chrissie's biological uncle) plays on Lawrence's burgeoning feelings for him. When Aaron returns, Robert attempts to get back together but is rebuffed. After Liv learns why they broke up, she is furious at Robert and Rebecca. She confronts him over this, leading Robert to express his anger towards Rebecca and the baby and his continued love for Aaron. Liv shows up at Home Farm trying to get Robert to admit his resentment to Rebecca, but Robert harshly tells her to leave. She steals a spiked bottle of brandy and Robert's car. She passes out after drinking some of it and is taken to the hospital where Robert is forced to admit his tampering to Aaron. Aaron swears to kill Robert if Liv dies, but she survives. While she recovers, Aaron takes an interest in her doctor, Alex Mason. Liv encourages him to pursue a relationship with him and Robert gets jealous. At first, it goes nowhere, but Aaron and Alex later begin a tentative relationship to Robert's dismay. Rebecca goes into labour and, with Robert present, delivers a baby boy named Sebastian. Robert, fearing that he will ruin his son's life, planned to leaves the village, but after Robert comes clean to Aaron about everything he did to the Whites, Aaron convinces him to stay and be a father. He agrees, and promises to be a better man and a good father to his son. He abandons his schemes against the Whites but Rebecca discovers his lies and later reveals it all to them. Lawrence beats up Robert and Rebecca keeps him from seeing Sebastian. At Christmas, they stop Robert from giving Seb presents. Robert drowns his sorrows at the Woolpack and drunkenly attempts to persuade Aaron to take him back, humiliating himself and insulting Alex. That night, still intoxicated, he is hit by the Whites' car and is knocked unconscious. While unconscious, he has disturbing dreams where he the same day, watches Aaron's funeral, and receives advice from the ghost of Val Pollard. When Robert wakes up, he decides to become a better, less selfish person. He encourages Alex not to give up on Aaron and he and Aaron decide to just be friends. Robert continues to try and see his son, but the Whites don't believe that he is trying to change. Lachlan manipulates them into thinking that Robert has hurt him, and Rebecca forbids Robert from seeing Seb. Robert attempts to force mediation between him and Rebecca, but she and the Whites decide to flee to Australia in secret. When Robert learns of the move, he kidnaps Sebastian from his car seat. The Whites chase after him in their car, but are hit by a truck. Chrissie and Lawrence are killed and Rebecca is put in a coma. When Rebecca wakes up, she has post-traumatic amnesia and can only remember that Robert kidnapped Seb. Robert struggles with his duties as a single parent, and enlists the aid of his friends and family while Rebecca recovers. On Valentine's Day, Robert offers to help Aaron cook a meal for his boyfriend Alex and they end up sharing an intimate moment when Aaron leans in to kiss Robert, interrupted when Alex arrives unexpectedly. Robert is hopeful and confused about whether Aaron still has feelings for him after all. On their wedding anniversary his hopes are dashed as he sees Alex moving in to live with Aaron at Mill Cottage. He decides he needs to get over Aaron, and so the following evening he goes out to a gay bar accompanied by his sister, step sister and other ladies from Emmerdale there to give him moral support. He reluctantly agrees to get the phone number of an Irish hiker called Mike, and while they are talking, Aaron arrives and sees them. Aaron finishes with Alex because he says he misses Robert, but Robert leaves with Mike. Aaron goes back to Emmerdale to the Woolpack. When he leaves the Woolpack, he hears noises coming from the garage and finds Robert inside with a bottle of whiskey. Robert admits he didn't go back to Mike's place after all, because even if it doesn't count anymore he still feels he wants to be faithful to Aaron. Aaron tells him he finished with Alex and that he still wants him, and the two talk over their past issues but Robert says he can't get back with Aaron because losing him was so hard he would rather not have him back than lose him again when Aaron figures out he is a terrible person after all. He goes back to Keepers Cottage, but an emotional Aaron arrives on the doorstep and lists all the reasons he knows Robert and the good things Robert has done, and he asks Robert to come home. Robert tells him he loves him so much, and they reunite and Robert goes home to Aaron. The following day, Liv comes home and wonders why Robert is in the house leaving Robert no choice but to inform her of his and Aaron's reconciliation. He has a heart to heart with Liv admitting he never stopped caring about her. He tells her he loves her and she is his sister. The pair prank Aaron pretending that Liv isn't happy he's back. They inform Aaron that they have talked and Liv tells Aaron she is happy to have him back. Robert tells Rebecca he is moving back home with Aaron. He informs her he will still help her, but he loves Aaron and wants to make a life with him. Robert moves back into The Mill with Aaron and Victoria's help. Aaron suggests they take Seb to give Rebecca a break. Robert argues with Joe Tate after he keeps getting Jimmy to do work for him. He then has another row with him after he insults the Dingles, which pushes Robert to lose him a client by revealing the truth about Wishing Well. Robert accepts Joe's offer of making amends unaware of his true motive. Victoria informs Robert and Aaron about Rebecca's strange behavior. Robert suggests they take Seb to Eliza's birthday party. After attending the party, Robert informs Victoria she was perfectly fine. Robert goes to see Rebecca who asks if she can join him and Aaron on a date. Despite feeling awkward he agrees. Later, Victoria informs Aaron and Robert that Rebecca has vanished. They arrive back at Victoria's and Robert is unhappy he and Aaron couldn't go out on a date because it seems Rebecca wasn't missing after all and had only wanted to sleep. She tells them to keep Seb for the night as they are taking him to the zoo the next day. Later, Robert discovers that Joe had Rebecca arrested and confronts him. Arriving back at Keepers Cottage Robert discovers smoke and is told by Aaron he had to break in to get Seb as he'd been left unattended with the cooker was on. Rebecca is shocked to discover it was her fault, so Aaron, Robert and Victoria encourage her to go the hospital where she's told she's suffering with Executive Dysfunction. Robert and Aaron worry about Seb's safety, whilst Robert praises Aaron for saving Seb, Aaron suggests Seb comes to live with them, but Robert is unsure about taking him from Rebecca after everything she's been through. However, Rebecca calls Aaron and Robert round to Keepers Cottage and informs them she no longer trusts herself and tells them to take Seb. As they pack up his belongings, Rebecca says a tearful goodbye promising Seb she still loves him before handing him over to Robert. A couple of days later Robert and Aaron arrive home at The Mill with Seb where Liv is giving Aaron the silent treatment. As they talk about Gabby, Liv confesses to her role in drugging Lisa. Robert and Aaron are shocked but decide to protect Liv insisting she keeps it quiet. In September, he was thrilled alongside Rebecca when Lachlan was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole. A year later Victoria is raped by Lee and Robert attacks him, leading Robert to be arrested for grevious bodily harm. Robert pleads guilty to GBH with intent. Later Lee dies from a brain haemorrhage sustained from the attack. Robert and Aaron both decide to go on the run together. But later Robert hands himself in to the police for Aaron's safety and then Robert is charged with Lee's murder, he pleads guilty on the advice of his solicitor and is sentenced to life in prison, minimum fourteen years without parole until full-time has been served. Casting Robert Sugden as portrayed by Christopher Smith. The character of Robert Sugden was introduced as the second son of Jack (Clive Hornby) and Pat Sugden (Helen Weir). He made his first on- screen appearance on 22 April 1986 as a baby. Initially played by Richard Smith, after three years on the show the character was recast and Christopher Smith took over the role. Christopher Smith remained in the role for twelve years between 1989 and 2001, making him the longest actor to play the character. However, when Smith played the character throughout the 1990s, he was only involved in small storylines, including his decision not to work on his father's farm and his stepmother Sarah's (Alyson Spiro) death in 2000. In May 2001, Christopher Smith was axed from the role after twelve years. ITV announced that they were casting an older actor in the role of Robert in order to involve him in more adult storylines. The character returned in August 2001, now played by Karl Davies. In September the same year, Smith sued Yorkshire Television for unfair dismissal from the role of Robert. Development Karl Davies's reign as Robert increased the character's popularity as well as establishing the character as a sex symbol. Much of Davies's time on Emmerdale centred upon his long-standing feud with adoptive brother Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher), which was used by Emmerdale producers to compete with rival soap opera EastEnders. His popular relationships with Donna Windsor, Andy's wife Katie Sugden and Debbie Dingle, established him as a bad boy, but the storyline which saw him leave his love interest Elaine Marsden for dead in a car accident, led to him being described as \\"an out-and- out villain\\" by critics. In mid–2005 it was announced that either Robert or Andy Sugden. Max King (Charlie Kemp) would be killed in a car accident that would take place in October of that year. The decision to kill off one character came after actor Charlie Kemp quit the show and producers decided to have Karl Davies written out of the soap. The episode which took place on 2 October 2005 saw Max killed while in Andy's land rover, after he grabbed the wheel when Andy and Robert began driving towards each other at high speed after Andy thwarted Robert's plan to escape the village with Andy's daughter Sarah and Sarah's mother Debbie Dingle. The following episode saw Robert leave the serial to avoid trouble with the police. =Return= Karl Davies was asked to return to the show four years following his initial departure from the show, for one episode centred on the funeral of his on-screen father Jack Sugden, following the death of Jack's real-life portrayer Clive Hornby. Davies reprised his role as Robert on 10 February 2009, which saw him return to the village alongside grandmother Annie Brearly (Sheila Mercier), who had previously been absent from the show since 1996. Davies left the show soon after. =Reintroduction= In an interview with Digital Spy in April 2014, Davies stated that he would not rule out a return to Emmerdale. He said he would \\"never say never\\". Davies told Digital Spy, \\"I'm still really glad to be working and to be part of some lovely stuff, so at the moment I'm very happy but who knows in the future? I love what I do and if that means a return to Emmerdale then so be it, but at the moment that's not on the cards.\\" Davies also said that people still recognized and remembered him from his role in Emmerdale, saying, \\"It's still very much in people's memories – I don't quite know how! I've almost forgotten what I did, but people still linger on that. I guess it's 'cos you're in their house every night – six nights a week [or] whatever it was at the time. People still seem to remember that character – nearly a decade later which is very strange.\\" In September 2014 it was confirmed that Robert would be returning but not played by Davies instead the role being recast with Ryan Hawley now playing him. Series producer Kate Oates said: \\"I'm delighted to welcome Ryan to the show. Robert is a complex character and when we were looking for someone to take over the role, Ryan had the perfect balance of charm and edge, Robert Sugden's life has moved on in many ways... but those ingrained feelings – about his father, Andy, Katie, and the village where he grew up – are sure to find an explosive outlet.\\" =Sexuality and relationship with Aaron Dingle (\\"Robron\\")= Robert was paired romantically with and eventually married Aaron Livesy played by Danny Miller (pictured). Following Robert's return and recast in 2014, the character showed romantic interest in Aaron Livesy as played by Danny Miller and has been portrayed as bisexual. Series producer Kate Oates spoke at an Emmerdale conference saying: \\"Chrissie [Robert's fiancée] doesn't know about the relationship with Robert and Aaron, and that's obviously going to be a long- burner. She doesn't know that her husband-to-be has this tendency that he also fancies men, so that might be a big surprise to her!\\" In an interview with Digital Spy she also said: \\"Robert is very different from his brother in that Andy can live in the terraced house in the village with the girl that he's always loved and be happy. He works as a farmhand on the farm where he grew up, he doesn't need any more and he's a really happy guy like that. Robert always wants more – there's never enough. He's in a position now where he's with Chrissie and he's in the big house on the hill. He's also got Lawrence in his back pocket now, but it's still not enough. Robert is still taking risks and seeking adrenaline. He just wants more all the time. I think Aaron is going to be a victim of that to a certain extent, but the attraction between them is genuine.\\" Praising Danny Miller and Ryan Hawley, Oates continued: \\"What I really like is that the lads have done a great job of creating that chemistry. In the scenes where they're together, you absolutely believe it and I think that they've done brilliantly with that. It's genuine to a point, but Robert will always be out for himself!\\" Oates also revealed that she spoke to Karl Davies and offered him the chance to return. When he declined the opportunity, a decision was made to recast the role with Hawley in the part. In an interview in December 2015, Danny Miller commented that the \\"power of Twitter\\" would keep the \\"Robron\\" storyline going. Paying tribute to Ryan Hawley, Miller said: \\"I'm very proud to work with him. He's been here a year now and he's been amazing. He's a good lad. I say too much about him, actually – I think people think I fancy him! But he's great – he's really good, and I think they know that. They've shelved the storyline for now, but I think they're quite keen to see it again.\\" =Engagement = In May 2016, new Emmerdale producer Iain MacLeod reveals Robert will heavily involves the big October storyline along with Aaron. Aaron and Robert will caught in explosive and heart-stopping twist. Iain says 'It's a massive, big storyline for Robron. It's funny, romantic and heartstopping in places. People will be on the edge of their seat – or possibly falling off the end of it. I think viewers want us to keep them together and they have earned the right to be together for a period. Obviously there will be challenges but I'm really rooting for them, I hope that they can make it through!’ The crash storyline also saw the characters of Robert and Aaron get engaged. Following Robert and Aaron's engagement in October 2016, producer Iain MacLeod was asked at a press conference if the wedding would be a \\"big event\\", he responded: \\"In keeping with their characters, I don't think anybody is expecting dancing girls and show tunes. It's quite raw and honest, and it has got a healthy dose of Dingle craziness at the heart of it that threatens to derail things. It is huge emotional territory, but it's not dancing girls and 'Dancing Queen'. It is kind of more Robert and Aaron than that, which I hope people will like. It's happening next year.\\" Danny Miller, who plays Aaron, was also present at the press conference – so this was all news to him, as he hasn't read the wedding script at the time. Danny said: \\"I was just listening in! I haven't read anything myself yet. Like Iain said, it's next year. We only really get scripts about two or three weeks before we record them, so I've not read anything yet. I think Iain's right that it would be against the characters if it was too big, or a stereotypical big pink wedding. I think it's nice that they keep it to more of a Dingle-type celebration, I guess.\\" MacLeod was also quizzed on what he makes of the Robron craze, which began when his predecessor Kate Oates decided to put the pair together in 2014. MacLeod said: \\"I have never seen anything like it, to be honest. It is a phenomenon – the Robron phenomenon. I was aware of it before I came to Emmerdale and you think you understand it. But it's only when you are immersed in it you realise how passionately our audience care about those two characters. They have been through so much and survived it, so the audience are rooting for them and so am I fundamentally. I should also say a quick word on the Robron episode you watched this week. The writer Maxine Alderton, one of our very many talented writers, is a huge Robron fan. She has got Robron dolls and stickers on her laptop, so there was never any doubt about who would write that particular episode as she is a massive superfan. Reception Karl Davies, who was the third actor to portray Robert, received much praise from fans and critics for his portrayal of the character. Anthony D. Langford of The Backlot remarked that Cain knocking Robert to the floor in one punch was \\"ridiculous\\", because Robert isn't \\"exactly a small guy\\". He also mentioned how he noticed that Robert, Aaron and Finn (all of which are either homosexual or bisexual) had been \\"beaten up, shoved around and/or intimidated by Cain\\". In August 2017, Hawley was longlisted for \\"Best Actor\\" and \\"Best Bad Boy\\" at the Inside Soap Awards, while he and Miller were longlisted for \\"Best Partnership\\". The nominations for \\"Best Bad Boy\\" and \\"Best Partnership\\" made the viewer-voted shortlist. In September 2017, Ryan Hawley won \\"Best Soap Actor\\" for TV Choice Awards. On 13 March 2018, Ryan Hawley won the industry voted TRIC award for \\"Best Soap Actor\\". In April 2018, Hawley was nominated for \\"Best Actor\\" at The British Soap Awards 2018. For his portrayal of Robert, Hawley won the accolade for Best Soap Actor (Male) at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. Robert's pairing with Aaron also won for the \\"Best Soap Couple\\" award.

It seeks to understand the world by trying to change it, collaboratively and following reflection. PAR emphasizes collective inquiry and experimentation grounded in experience and social history. Within a PAR process, \\"communities of inquiry and action evolve and address questions and issues that are significant for those who participate as co-researchers\\". PAR contrasts with many research methods, which emphasize disinterested researchers and reproducibility of findings. PAR practitioners make a concerted effort to integrate three basic aspects of their work: participation (life in society and democracy), action (engagement with experience and history), and research (soundness in thought and the growth of knowledge). \\"Action unites, organically, with research\\" and collective processes of self-investigation. The way each component is actually understood and the relative emphasis it receives varies nonetheless from one PAR theory and practice to another. This means that PAR is not a monolithic body of ideas and methods but rather a pluralistic orientation to knowledge making and social change. Overview PAR has multiple progenitors and resists definition. It is a broad tradition of collective self-experimentation backed up by evidential reasoning, fact-finding and learning. All formulations of PAR have in common the idea that research and action must be done 'with' people and not 'on' or 'for' people. It counters scientism by promoting the grounding of knowledge in human agency and social history (as in much of political economy). Inquiry based on PAR principles makes sense of the world through collective efforts to transform it, as opposed to simply observing and studying human behaviour and people's views about reality, in the hope that meaningful change will eventually emerge. PAR draws on a wide range of influences, both among those with professional training and those who draw on their life experience and those of their ancestors. Many draw on the work of Paulo Freire, new thinking on adult education research, the Civil Rights Movement, South Asian social movements such as the Bhoomi Sena, and key initiatives such as the Participatory Research Network created in 1978 and based in New Delhi. \\"It has benefited from an interdisciplinary development drawing its theoretical strength from adult education, sociology, political economy, community psychology, community development, feminist studies, critical psychology, organizational development and more\\". The Colombian sociologist Orlando Fals Borda and others organized the first explicitly PAR conference in Cartagena, Colombia in 1977. Based on his research with peasant groups in rural Boyaca and with other underserved groups, Fals Borda called for the 'community action' component to be incorporated into the research plans of traditionally trained researchers. His recommendations to researchers committed to the struggle for justice and greater democracy in all spheres, including the business of science, are useful for all researchers and echo the teaching from many schools of research: : \\"Do not monopolise your knowledge nor impose arrogantly your techniques, but respect and combine your skills with the knowledge of the researched or grassroots communities, taking them as full partners and co-researchers. Do not trust elitist versions of history and science which respond to dominant interests, but be receptive to counter- narratives and try to recapture them. Do not depend solely on your culture to interpret facts, but recover local values, traits, beliefs, and arts for action by and with the research organisations. Do not impose your own ponderous scientific style for communicating results, but diffuse and share what you have learned together with the people, in a manner that is wholly understandable and even literary and pleasant, for science should not be necessarily a mystery nor a monopoly of experts and intellectuals.\\" In the UK and North America the work of Kurt Lewin and the Tavistock Institute in the 1940s has been influential. However alternative traditions of PAR, begin with processes that include more bottom-up organising and popular education than were envisaged by Lewin. PAR strategies to democratize knowledge making and ground it in real community needs and learning represent genuine efforts to overcome the ineffectiveness and elitism of conventional schooling and science, and the negative effects of market forces and industry on the workplace, community life and sustainable livelihoods. These principles and the ongoing evolution of PAR have had a lasting legacy in fields ranging from problem solving in the workplace to community development and sustainable livelihoods, education, public health, feminist research and civic engagement. It is important to note that these contributions are subject to many tensions and debates on key issues such as the role of clinical psychology, critical social thinking and the pragmatic concerns of organizational learning in PAR theory and practice. Labels used to define each approach (PAR, critical PAR, action research, psychosociology, sociotechnical analysis, etc.) reflect these tensions and point to major differences that may outweigh the similarities. While a common denominator, the combination of participation, action and research reflects the fragile unity of traditions whose diverse ideological and organizational contexts kept them separate and largely ignorant of one another for several decades. The following review focuses on traditions that incorporate the three pillars of PAR. Closely related approaches that overlap but do not bring the three components together are left out. Applied research, for instance, is not necessarily committed to participatory principles and may be initiated and controlled mostly by experts, with the implication that 'human subjects' are not invited to play a key role in science building and the framing of the research questions. As in mainstream science, this process \\"regards people as sources of information, as having bits of isolated knowledge, but they are neither expected nor apparently assumed able to analyze a given social reality\\". PAR also differs from participatory inquiry or collaborative research, contributions to knowledge that may not involve direct engagement with transformative action and social history. PAR, in contrast, has evolved from the work of activists more concerned with empowering marginalized peoples than with generating academic knowledge for its own sake. Lastly, given its commitment to the research process, PAR overlaps but is not synonymous with action learning, action reflection learning (ARL), participatory development and community development—recognized forms of problem solving and capacity building that may be carried out with no immediate concern for research and the advancement of knowledge. =Organizational life= Action research in the workplace took its initial inspiration from Lewin's work on organizational development (and Dewey's emphasis on learning from experience). Lewin's seminal contribution involves a flexible, scientific approach to planned change that proceeds through a spiral of steps, each of which is composed of 'a circle of planning, action, and fact-finding about the result of the action', towards an organizational 'climate' of democratic leadership and responsible participation that promotes critical self-inquiry and collaborative work. These steps inform Lewin's work with basic skill training groups, T-groups where community leaders and group facilitators use feedback, problem solving, role play and cognitive aids (lectures, handouts, film) to gain insights into themselves, others and groups with a view to 'unfreezing' and changing their mindsets, attitudes and behaviours. Lewin's understanding of action-research coincides with key ideas and practices developed at the influential Tavistock Institute (created in 1947)) in the UK and National Training Laboratories (NTL) in the US. An important offshoot of Tavistock thinking and practise is the sociotechnical systems perspective on workplace dynamics, guided by the idea that greater productivity or efficiency does not hinge on improved technology alone. Improvements in organizational life call instead for the interaction and 'joint optimization' of the social and technical components of workplace activity. In this perspective, the best match between the social and technical factors of organized work lies in principles of 'responsible group autonomy' and industrial democracy, as opposed to deskilling and top-down bureaucracy guided by Taylor's scientific management and linear chain of command. NTL played a central role in the evolution of experiential learning and the application of behavioral science to improving organizations. Process consultation, team building, conflict management, and workplace group democracy and autonomy have become recurrent themes in the prolific body of literature and practice known as organizational development (OD). As with 'action science', OD is a response to calls for planned change and 'rational social management' involving a normative human relations movement and approach to worklife in capital-dominated economies. Its principal goal is to enhance an organization's performance and the worklife experience, with the assistance of a consultant, a change agent or catalyst that helps the sponsoring organization define and solve its own problems, introduce new forms of leadership and change organizational culture and learning. Diagnostic and capacity-building activities are informed, to varying degrees, by psychology, the behavioural sciences, organizational studies, or theories of leadership and social innovation. Appreciative Inquiry (AI), for instance, is an offshoot of PAR based on positive psychology. Rigorous data gathering or fact-finding methods may be used to support the inquiry process and group thinking and planning. On the whole, however, science tends to be a means, not an end. Workplace and organizational learning interventions are first and foremost problem-based, action-oriented and client-centred. =Psychosociology= Tavistock broke new ground in other ways as well, by meshing general medicine and psychiatry with Freudian and Jungian psychology and the social sciences to help the British army face various human resource problems. This gave rise to a field of scholarly research and professional intervention loosely known as psychosociology, particularly influential in France (CIRFIP). Several schools of thought and 'social clinical' practise belong to this tradition, all of which are critical of the experimental and expert mindset of social psychology. Most formulations of psychosociology share with OD a commitment to the relative autonomy and active participation of individuals and groups coping with problems of self-realization and goal effectiveness within larger organizations and institutions. In addition to this humanistic and democratic agenda, psychosociology uses concepts of psychoanalytic inspiration to address interpersonal relations and the interplay between self and group. It acknowledges the role of the unconscious in social behaviour and collective representations and the inevitable expression of transference and countertransference—language and behaviour that redirect unspoken feelings and anxieties to other people or physical objects taking part in the action inquiry. The works of Balint, Jaques,) and Bion are turning points in the formative years of psychosociology. Commonly cited authors in France include Amado, Barus-Michel, Dubost, Enriquez, Lévy, Gaujelac, and Giust-Desprairies. Different schools of thought and practice include Mendel's action research framed in a 'sociopsychoanalytic' perspective and Dejours's psychodynamics of work, with its emphasis on work-induced suffering and defence mechanisms. Lapassade and Lourau's 'socianalytic' interventions focus rather on institutions viewed as systems that dismantle and recompose norms and rules of social interaction over time, a perspective that builds on the principles of institutional analysis and psychotherapy. Anzieu and Martin's work on group psychoanalysis and theory of the collective 'skin-ego' is generally considered as the most faithful to the Freudian tradition. Key differences between these schools and the methods they use stem from the weight they assign to the analyst's expertise in making sense of group behaviour and views and also the social aspects of group behaviour and affect. Another issue is the extent to which the intervention is critical of broader institutional and social systems. The use of psychoanalytic concepts and the relative weight of effort dedicated to research, training and action also vary. =Community development and sustainable livelihoods= PAR emerged in the postwar years as an important contribution to intervention and self-transformation within groups, organizations and communities. It has left a singular mark on the field of rural and community development, especially in the Global South. Tools and concepts for doing research with people, including \\"barefoot scientists\\" and grassroots \\"organic intellectuals\\" (see Gramsci), are now promoted and implemented by many international development agencies, researchers, consultants, civil society and local community organizations around the world. This has resulted in countless experiments in diagnostic assessment, scenario planning and project evaluation in areas ranging from fisheries and mining to forestry, plant breeding, agriculture, farming systems research and extension, watershed management, resource mapping, environmental conflict and natural resource management, land rights, appropriate technology, local economic development, communication, tourism, leadership for sustainability, biodiversity and climate change. This prolific literature includes the many insights and methodological creativity of participatory monitoring, participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and participatory learning and action (PLA) and all action-oriented studies of local, indigenous or traditional knowledge. On the whole, PAR applications in these fields are committed to problem solving and adaptation to nature at the household or community level, using friendly methods of scientific thinking and experimentation adapted to support rural participation and sustainable livelihoods. =Literacy, education and youth= In education, PAR practitioners inspired by the ideas of critical pedagogy and adult education are firmly committed to the politics of emancipatory action formulated by Freire, with a focus on dialogical reflection and action as means to overcome relations of domination and subordination between oppressors and the oppressed, colonizers and the colonized. The approach implies that \\"the silenced are not just incidental to the curiosity of the researcher but are the masters of inquiry into the underlying causes of the events in their world\\". Although a researcher and a sociologist, Fals Borda also has a profound distrust of conventional academia and great confidence in popular knowledge, sentiments that have had a lasting impact on the history of PAR, particularly in the fields of development, literacy, counterhegemonic education as well as youth engagement on issues ranging from violence to criminality, racial or sexual discrimination, educational justice, healthcare and the environment. Community-based participatory research and service-learning are a more recent attempts to reconnect academic interests with education and community development. The Global Alliance on Community-Engaged Research is a promising effort to \\"use knowledge and community-university partnership strategies for democratic social and environmental change and justice, particularly among the most vulnerable people and places of the world.\\" It calls for the active involvement of community members and researchers in all phases of the action inquiry process, from defining relevant research questions and topics to designing and implementing the investigation, sharing the available resources, acknowledging community-based expertise, and making the results accessible and understandable to community members and the broader public. Service learning or education is a closely related endeavour designed to encourage students to actively apply knowledge and skills to local situations, in response to local needs and with the active involvement of community members. Many online or printed guides now show how students and faculty can engage in community-based participatory research and meet academic standards at the same time. Collaborative research in education is community-based research where pre- university teachers are the community and scientific knowledge is built on top of teachers' own interpretation of their experience and reality, with or without immediate engagement in transformative action. =Public health= PAR has made important inroads in the field of public health, in areas such as disaster relief, community-based rehabilitation, accident prevention, hospital care and drug prevention. Because of its link to radical democratic struggles of the Civil Rights Movement and other social movements in South Asia and Latin America (see above), PAR is seen as a threat to their authority by some established elites. An international alliance university-based participatory researchers, ICPHR, omit the word \\"Action\\", preferring the less controversial term \\"participatory research\\". Photovoice is one of the strategies used in PAR and is especially useful in the public health domain. Keeping in mind the purpose of PAR, which is to benefit communities, Photovoice allows the same to happen through the media of photography. Photovoice considers helping community issues and problems reach policy makers as its primary goal. = Occupational health and safety = Participatory programs within the workplace involve employees within all levels of a workplace organization, from management to front-line staff, in the design and implementation of health and safety interventions. Some research has shown that interventions are most successful when front-line employees have a fundamental role in designing workplace interventions. Success through participatory programs may be due to a number of factors. Such factors include a better identification of potential barriers and facilitators, a greater willingness to accept interventions than those imposed strictly from upper management, and enhanced buy-in to intervention design, resulting in greater sustainability though promotion and acceptance. When designing an intervention, employees are able to consider lifestyle and other behavioral influences into solution activities that go beyond the immediate workplace. =Feminism and gender= Feminist research and women's development theory also contributed to rethinking the role of scholarship in challenging existing regimes of power, using qualitative and interpretive methods that emphasize subjectivity and self-inquiry rather than the quantitative approach of mainstream science. =Civic engagement and ICT= Novel approaches to PAR in the public sphere help scale up the engaged inquiry process beyond small group dynamics. Touraine and others thus propose a 'sociology of intervention' involving the creation of artificial spaces for movement activists and non-activists to debate issues of public concern. Citizen science is another recent move to expand the scope of PAR, to include broader 'communities of interest' and citizens committed to enhancing knowledge in particular fields. In this approach to collaborative inquiry, research is actively assisted by volunteers who form an active public or network of contributing individuals. Efforts to promote public participation in the works of science owe a lot to the revolution in information and communications technology (ICT). Web 2.0 applications support virtual community interactivity and the development of user-driven content and social media, without restricted access or controlled implementation. They extend principles of open-source governance to democratic institutions, allowing citizens to actively engage in wiki-based processes of virtual journalism, public debate and policy development. Although few and far between, experiments in open politics can thus make use of ICT and the mechanics of e-democracy to facilitate communications on a large scale, towards achieving decisions that best serve the public interest. In the same spirit, discursive or deliberative democracy calls for public discussion, transparency and pluralism in political decision-making, lawmaking and institutional life. Fact-finding and the outputs of science are made accessible to participants and may be subject to extensive media coverage, scientific peer review, deliberative opinion polling and adversarial presentations of competing arguments and predictive claims. The methodology of Citizens' jury is interesting in this regard. It involves people selected at random from a local or national population who are provided opportunities to question 'witnesses' and collectively form a 'judgment' on the issue at hand. ICTs, open politics and deliberative democracy usher in new strategies to engage governments, scientists, civil society organizations and interested citizens in policy- related discussions of science and technology. These trends represent an invitation to explore novel ways of doing PAR on a broader scale. Ethics Calls for norms of ethical conduct to guide the relationship between researchers and participants are many. Norms in research ethics involving humans include respect for the autonomy of individuals and groups to deliberate about a decision and act on it. This principle is usually expressed through the free, informed and ongoing consent of those participating in research (or those representing them in the case of persons lacking the capacity to decide). Another mainstream principle is the welfare of participants who should not be exposed to any unfavourable balance of benefits and risks with participation in research aimed at the advancement of knowledge, especially those that are serious and probable. Since privacy is a factor that contributes to people's welfare, confidentiality obtained through the collection and use of data that are anonymous (e.g. survey data) or anonymized tends to be the norm. Finally, the principle of justice—equal treatment and concern for fairness and equity—calls for measures of appropriate inclusion and mechanisms to address conflicts of interests. While the choice of appropriate norms of ethical conduct is rarely an either/or question, PAR implies a different understanding of what consent, welfare and justice entail. For one thing the people involved are not mere 'subjects' or 'participants'. They act instead as key partners in an inquiry process that may take place outside the walls of academic or corporate science. As Canada's Tri-Council Policy Statement: Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans suggests, PAR requires that the terms and conditions of the collaborative process be set out in a research agreement or protocol based on mutual understanding of the project goals and objectives between the parties, subject to preliminary discussions and negotiations. Unlike individual consent forms, these terms of reference (ToR) may acknowledge collective rights, interests and mutual obligations. While they are legalistic in their genesis, they are usually based on interpersonal relationships and a history of trust rather than the language of legal forms and contracts. Another implication of PAR ethics is that partners must protect themselves and each other against potential risks, by mitigating the negative consequences of their collaborative work and pursuing the welfare of all parties concerned. This does not preclude battles against dominant interests. Given their commitment to social justice and transformative action, some PAR projects may be critical of existing social structures and struggle against the policies and interests of individuals, groups and institutions accountable for their actions, creating circumstances of danger. On the matter of welfare, empowerment through recognition and 'being heard' may be more important to the research than are privacy and confidentiality. It is important to strike a balance between allowing privacy and confidentiality, and respect for individuals and groups who wish to be heard and identified for their contribution to research. The former may be hard to reconcile with PAR. The latter can be shown through proper quoting, acknowledgements, co-authorship, or the granting of intellectual property rights. By definition, PAR is always a step into the unknown, raising new questions and creating new risks over time. Given its emergent properties and responsiveness to social context and needs, PAR cannot limit discussions and decisions about ethics to the design and proposal phase. Norms of ethical conduct and their implications may have to be revisited as the project unfolds. This has implications, both in resources and practice, for the ability to subject the research to true ethical oversight in the way that traditional research has come to be regulated. Challenges PAR offers a long history of experimentation with evidence-based and people-based inquiry, a groundbreaking alternative to mainstream positive science. As with positivism, the approach creates many challenges as well as debates on what counts as participation, action and research. Differences in theoretical commitments (Lewinian, Habermasian, Freirean, psychoanalytic, feminist, etc.) and methodological inclinations (quantitative, qualitative, mixed) are numerous and profound. This is not necessarily a problem, given the pluralistic value system built into PAR. Ways to better answer questions pertaining to PAR's relationship with science and social history are nonetheless key to its future. One critical question concerns the problem- solving orientation of engaged inquiry—the rational means-ends focus of most PAR experiments as they affect organizational performance or material livelihoods, for instance. In the clinical perspective of French psychosociology, a pragmatic orientation to inquiry neglects forms of understanding and consciousness that are not strictly instrumental and rational. PAR must pay equal attention the interconnections of self-awareness, the unconscious and life in society. Another issue, more widely debated, is scale—how to address broad-based systems of power and issues of complexity, especially those of another development on a global scale. How can PAR develop a macro-orientation to democratic dialogue and meet challenges of the 21st Century, by joining movements to support justice and solidarity on both local and global scales? By keeping things closely tied to local group dynamics, PAR runs the risk of substituting small-scale participation for genuine democracy and fails to develop strategies for social transformation on all levels. Given its political implications, community-based action research and its consensus ethos have been known to fall prey to powerful stakeholders and serve as Trojan horses to bring global and environmental restructuring processes directly to local settings, bypassing legitimate institutional buffers and obscuring diverging interests and the exercise of power during the process. Cooptation can lead to highly manipulated outcomes. Against this criticism, others argue that, given the right circumstances, it is possible to build institutional arrangements for joint learning and action across regional and national borders that can have impacts on citizen action, national policies and global discourses. The role of science and scholarship in PAR is another source of difference. In the Lewinian tradition, \\"there is nothing so practical as a good theory\\". Accordingly, the scientific logic of developing theory, forming and testing hypotheses, gathering measurable data and interpreting the results plays a central role. While more clinically oriented, psychosociology in France also emphasizes the distinctive role of formal research and academic work, beyond problem solving in specific contexts. Many PAR practitioners critical of mainstream science and its overemphasis on quantitative data also point out that research based on qualitative methods may be theoretically-informed and rigorous in its own way. In other traditions, however, PAR keeps great distance from both academic and corporate science. Given their emphasis on pluralism and living knowledge, many practitioners of grassroots inquiry are critical of grand theory and advanced methods for collaborative inquiry, to the point of abandoning the word \\"research\\" altogether, as in participatory action learning. Others equate research with any involvement in reflexive practice aimed at assessing problems and evaluating project or program results against group expectations. As a result, inquiry methods tend to be soft and theory remains absent or underdeveloped. Practical and theoretical efforts to overcome this ambivalence towards scholarly activity are nonetheless emerging.

In its original formulation as presented by Paul Ehrenfest 1909 in relation to the concept of Born rigidity within special relativity, it discusses an ideally rigid cylinder that is made to rotate about its axis of symmetry. The radius R as seen in the laboratory frame is always perpendicular to its motion and should therefore be equal to its value R0 when stationary. However, the circumference (2R) should appear Lorentz-contracted to a smaller value than at rest, by the usual factor γ. This leads to the contradiction that R = R0 and R < R0. The paradox has been deepened further by Albert Einstein, who showed that since measuring rods aligned along the periphery and moving with it should appear contracted, more would fit around the circumference, which would thus measure greater than 2R. This indicates that geometry is non-Euclidean for rotating observers, and was important for Einstein's development of general relativity. Any rigid object made from real materials that is rotating with a transverse velocity close to the speed of sound in the material must exceed the point of rupture due to centrifugal force, because centrifugal pressure can not exceed the shear modulus of material. : frac{F}{S} = frac{mv^2}{rS} < frac{mc_s^2}{rS} approx frac{mG}{rS rho} approx G where c_s is speed of sound, rho is density and G is shear modulus. Therefore, when considering velocities close to the speed of light, it is only a thought experiment. Neutron-degenerate matter allows velocities close to speed of light, because e.g. the speed of neutron-star oscillations is relativistic; however; these bodies cannot strictly be said to be \\"rigid\\" (per Born rigidity). Essence of the paradox Imagine a disk of radius R rotating with constant angular velocity omega. Ehrenfest paradox – Circumference of a rotating disk should contract but not the radius, as radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion. The reference frame is fixed to the stationary center of the disk. Then the magnitude of the relative velocity of any point in the circumference of the disk is omega R. So the circumference will undergo Lorentz contraction by a factor of sqrt{1-(omega R)^2/c^2}. However, since the radius is perpendicular to the direction of motion, it will not undergo any contraction. So : frac{mathrm{circumference}}{mathrm{diameter}}=frac{2pi R sqrt{1-(omega R)^2/c^2}}{2R} = pi sqrt{1-(omega R)^2/c^2}. This is paradoxical, since in accordance with Euclidean geometry, it should be exactly equal to . Ehrenfest's argument Ehrenfest considered an ideal Born-rigid cylinder that is made to rotate. Assuming that the cylinder does not expand or contract, its radius stays the same. But measuring rods laid out along the circumference 2 pi R should be Lorentz-contracted to a smaller value than at rest, by the usual factor γ. This leads to the paradox that the rigid measuring rods would have to separate from one another due to Lorentz contraction; the discrepancy noted by Ehrenfest seems to suggest that a rotated Born rigid disk should shatter. Thus Ehrenfest argued by reductio ad absurdum that Born rigidity is not generally compatible with special relativity. According to special relativity an object cannot be spun up from a non-rotating state while maintaining Born rigidity, but once it has achieved a constant nonzero angular velocity it does maintain Born rigidity without violating special relativity, and then (as Einstein later showed) a disk- riding observer will measure a circumference: C^prime = frac{2pi R}{sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}}.  Einstein and general relativity  The rotating disc and its connection with rigidity was also an important thought experiment for Albert Einstein in developing general relativity. He referred to it in several publications in 1912, 1916, 1917, 1922 and drew the insight from it, that the geometry of the disc becomes non-Euclidean for a co-rotating observer. Einstein wrote (1922): > 66ff: Imagine a circle drawn about the origin in the x'y' plane of K' and a > diameter of this circle. Imagine, further, that we have given a large number > of rigid rods, all equal to each other. We suppose these laid in series > along the periphery and the diameter of the circle, at rest relatively to > K'. If U is the number of these rods along the periphery, D the number along > the diameter, then, if K' does not rotate relatively to K, we shall have > U/D=pi. But if K' rotates we get a different result. Suppose that at a > definite time t of K we determine the ends of all the rods. With respect to > K all the rods upon the periphery experience the Lorentz contraction, but > the rods upon the diameter do not experience this contraction (along their > lengths!). It therefore follows that U/D>pi. It therefore follows that the > laws of configuration of rigid bodies with respect to K' do not agree with > the laws of configuration of rigid bodies that are in accordance with > Euclidean geometry. If, further, we place two similar clocks (rotating with > K'), one upon the periphery, and the other at the centre of the circle, > then, judged from K, the clock on the periphery will go slower than the > clock at the centre.

Brief history  Citations to the papers mentioned below (and many which are not) can be found in a paper by Øyvind Grøn which is available on-line. This figure shows the world line of a Langevin observer (red helical curve). The figure also depicts the light cones at several events with the frame field of the Langevin observer passing through that event. * 1909: Max Born introduces a notion of rigid motion in special relativity. * 1909: After studying Born's notion of rigidity, Paul Ehrenfest demonstrated by means of a paradox about a cylinder that goes from rest to rotation, that most motions of extended bodies cannot be Born rigid. * 1910: Gustav Herglotz and Fritz Noether independently elaborated on Born's model and showed (Herglotz–Noether theorem) that Born rigidity only allows three degrees of freedom for bodies in motion. For instance, it's possible that a rigid body is executing uniform rotation, yet accelerated rotation is impossible. So a Born rigid body cannot be brought from a state of rest into rotation, confirming Ehrenfest's result. * 1910: Max Planck calls attention to the fact that one should not confuse the problem of the contraction of a disc due to spinning it up, with that of what disk-riding observers will measure as compared to stationary observers. He suggests that resolving the first problem will require introducing some material model and employing the theory of elasticity. * 1910: Theodor Kaluza points out that there is nothing inherently paradoxical about the static and disk-riding observers obtaining different results for the circumference. This does however imply, Kaluza argues, that \\"the geometry of the rotating disk\\" is non-euclidean. He asserts without proof that this geometry is in fact essentially just the geometry of the hyperbolic plane. * 1911: Max von Laue shows, that an accelerated body has an infinite number of degrees of freedom, thus no rigid bodies can exist in special relativity. * 1916: While writing up his new general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein notices that disk-riding observers measure a longer circumference, = 2πr/. That is, because rulers moving parallel to their length axis appear shorter as measured by static observers, the disk-riding observers can fit more smaller rulers of a given length around the circumference than stationary observers could. * 1922: In his seminal book \\"The Mathematical Theory of Relativity\\" (p. 113), A.S.Eddington calculates a contraction of the radius of the rotating disc (compared to stationary scales) of one quarter of the 'Lorentz contraction' factor applied to the circumference. * 1935: Paul Langevin essentially introduces a moving frame (or frame field in modern language) corresponding to the family of disk-riding observers, now called Langevin observers. (See the figure.) He also shows that distances measured by nearby Langevin observers correspond to a certain Riemannian metric, now called the Langevin-Landau- Lifschitz metric. (See Born coordinates for details.) * 1937: Jan Weyssenhoff (now perhaps best known for his work on Cartan connections with zero curvature and nonzero torsion) notices that the Langevin observers are not hypersurface orthogonal. Therefore, the Langevin-Landau-Lifschitz metric is defined, not on some hyperslice of Minkowski spacetime, but on the quotient space obtained by replacing each world line with a point. This gives a three-dimensional smooth manifold which becomes a Riemannian manifold when we add the metric structure. * 1946: Nathan Rosen shows that inertial observers instantaneously comoving with Langevin observers also measure small distances given by Langevin-Landau- Lifschitz metric. * 1946: E. L. Hill analyzes relativistic stresses in a material in which (roughly speaking) the speed of sound equals the speed of light and shows these just cancel the radial expansion due to centrifugal force (in any physically realistic material, the relativistic effects lessen but do not cancel the radial expansion). Hill explains errors in earlier analyses by Arthur Eddington and others. * 1952: C. Møller attempts to study null geodesics from the point of view of rotating observers (but incorrectly tries to use slices rather than the appropriate quotient space) * 1968: V. Cantoni provides a straightforward, purely kinematical explanation of the paradox by showing that \\"one of the assumptions implicitly contained in the statement of Ehrenfest's paradox is not correct, the assumption being that the geometry of Minkowski space-time allows the passage of the disk from rest to rotation in such a fashion that both the length of the radius and the length of the periphery, measured with respect to the comoving frame of reference, remain unchangod\\" * 1975: Øyvind Grøn writes a classic review paper about solutions of the \\"paradox\\". * 1977: Grünbaum and Janis introduce a notion of physically realizable \\"non-rigidity\\" which can be applied to the spin-up of an initially non-rotating disk (this notion is not physically realistic for real materials from which one might make a disk, but it is useful for thought experiments). * 1981: Grøn notices that Hooke's law is not consistent with Lorentz transformations and introduces a relativistic generalization. * 1997: T. A. Weber explicitly introduces the frame field associated with Langevin observers. * 2000: Hrvoje Nikolić points out that the paradox disappears when (in accordance with general theory of relativity) each piece of the rotating disk is treated separately, as living in its own local non-inertial frame. * 2002: Rizzi and Ruggiero (and Bel) explicitly introduce the quotient manifold mentioned above.  Resolution of the paradox  Grøn states that the resolution of the paradox stems from the impossibility of synchronizing clocks in a rotating reference frame. If observers on the rotating circumference try to synchronise their clocks around the circumference to establish disc time, there is a time difference between the two end points where they meet. The modern resolution can be briefly summarized as follows: #Small distances measured by disk-riding observers are described by the Langevin–Landau–Lifschitz metric, which is indeed well approximated (for small angular velocity) by the geometry of the hyperbolic plane, just as Kaluza had claimed. #For physically reasonable materials, during the spin-up phase a real disk expands radially due to centrifugal forces; relativistic corrections partially counteract (but do not cancel) this Newtonian effect. After a steady-state rotation is achieved and the disk has been allowed to relax, the geometry \\"in the small\\" is approximately given by the Langevin–Landau–Lifschitz metric.

Early life and education Born in Aberdeen, Scotland, Sedgewick's family immigrated to Nova Scotia while he was still an infant. He was educated at Dalhousie University in Halifax, graduating in 1867. He articled in Cornwall, Ontario, in the private practice of John Sandfield Macdonald, who was at that time both the Premier and the Attorney General of Ontario. Sedgewick was called to the bar in Ontario in 1872, and in Nova Scotia in 1873 following his return to the province. Career Sedgewick established a private practice in Halifax, and subsequently played an essential role in the establishment of the law school at Dalhousie in 1883. Beginning in the 1870s, Sedgewick became active in the Conservative Party of Canada. The connections thus established would serve him well, as his friend and former Halifax colleague John Sparrow David Thompson, who had become the federal Minister of Justice, appointed Sedgewick as Deputy Minister of Justice in February 1888. In this capacity, he played an important role in the establishment of the first national Criminal Code, which was enacted in 1892.Criminal Code, 1892, SC 1892, c 29. Thompson, who had by then become the Prime Minister of Canada, also appointed Sedgewick to the Supreme Court of Canada on 18 February 1893, a position he was to hold until his death in 1906.

Gifis, p. 86 Under color of authority is a legal phrase used in the US indicating that a person is claiming or implying the acts he or she is committing are related to and legitimized by his or her role as an agent of governmental power, especially if the acts are unlawful. Color of law Color of law refers to an appearance of legal power to act that may operate in violation of law. For example, if a police officer acts with the \\"color of law\\" authority to arrest someone, the arrest, if it is made without probable cause, may actually be in violation of law. In other words, just because something is done with the \\"color of law\\" does not mean that the action was lawful. When police are suspected of acting outside their lawful authority and violating the civil rights of a citizen, the FBI is tasked with investigating. The US Supreme Court has interpreted the US Constitution to construct laws regulating the actions of the law enforcement community. Under \\"color of law\\", it is a crime for one or more persons using power given by a governmental agency (local, state or federal), to deprive or conspire wilfully to deprive another person of any right protected by the Constitution or laws of the United States. Criminal acts under color of law include acts within and beyond the bounds or limits of lawful authority. Off-duty conduct may also be covered if official status is asserted in some manner. Color of law may include public officials and non-governmental employees who are not law enforcement officers such as judges, prosecutors, and private security guards.Hate Crimes.

When two or more persons conspire to prevent the exercise of constitutional rights, or to punish an individual for having exercised them, it is deemed a conspiracy against rights (18 U.S.C. § 241). The death penalty is applicable in extreme cases when the crimes cause the death of the individual being deprived of constitutional rights. https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/241https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/242 Color of office \\"Color of office\\" refers to an act usually committed by a public official under the appearance of authority but exceeds such authority. An affirmative act or omission, committed under color of office, is sometimes required to prove malfeasance in office. Color of title \\"Color of title\\", in property law, refers to a claim to title that appears valid but may be legally defective. Color of title may arise if there is evidence, such as a writing, suggesting valid legal title. The courts have ruled that deeds are mere color of title; the actual title to land is secured with an irrefutable instrument, like a land patent. When that land is subsequently conveyed to another owner by a deed, the deed colors the title to show the new owner. Thus, the chain of title from the land patent to the present may include many deeds. The actual title remains with the land patent and lawful deeds show the chain of title to the present landowner. Because the ownership in land is a very specific thing, requiring precise and proper transfers of ownership, it used to be that people always required a certified abstract be provided with a deed to ensure the deed was not merely a color of title fiction. Today, title companies offer title insurance to secure such documents. Still, only a proper and lawful title, like the land patent, provides actual title to land; and only a proper and lawful chain of title (deeds, etc.) from such a patent to the present can secure land rights to the landowner. However, even with land secured by patent, the proper grant of title can be implied by adverse possession, which is the basis for claims exemplified in Torrens title. The Torrens system operates on the principle of \\"title by registration\\" in which the act of registering an interest in land in a state-operated registry creates an indefeasible title in the registrant, which, like the land patent, can be challenged only in very limited circumstances. =Appropriation of name or likeness= Although it is a common-law tort, most states have enacted statutes that prohibit the use of a person’s name or image if used without consent for the commercial benefit of another person. A person's exclusive rights to control his or her name and likeness to prevent others from exploiting personal information without permission is protected in similar manner to a title or trademark action with the person's likeness and personal information, rather than the trademark or title, being the subject of the protection.Invasion of Privacy , Appropriation of Name or Likeness.

The film pay homage to 1970's exploitation films shown in the now-defunct \\"grindhouse\\" theaters; as such, each film is headlined by fictional trailers of the same genre. Written, directed, photographed, scored and co-edited by Robert Rodriguez, Planet Terror revolves around a group of rebels attempting to survive an onslaught of zombie-like creatures as they feud with a rogue military unit. Death Proof, which was written, directed and photographed by Quentin Tarantino, follows a deranged stuntman who stalks young women and murders them with his \\"death proof\\" stunt car. After the film was released on April 6, 2007, ticket sales performed significantly below box office analysts' expectations despite mostly positive critic reviews. In much of the rest of the world, each feature was released separately in extended versions. Two soundtracks were also released for the features and include music and audio snippets from the film. The feature later found more success on DVD and Blu-ray. In several interviews, despite the box office failure, the directors have expressed their interest in a possible sequel to the film due to its critical acclaim and successful home media sales. Three spin-off films were later made, based on Grindhouse's fake trailers: Machete, Machete Kills and Hobo with a Shotgun. Planet Terror In a rural town in Texas, go-go dancer Cherry Darling decides to quit her low- paying job and find another use for her numerous \\"useless\\" talents. She runs into mysterious ex-boyfriend El Wray at the Bone Shack, a restaurant owned by J. T. Hague. Meanwhile, a group of military officials, led by the demented Lt. Muldoon, are making a business transaction with a scientist named Abby for mass quantities of a deadly biochemical agent known as DC2 (codename \\"Project Terror\\"). Muldoon learns that Abby has an extra supply on hand and attempts to take him hostage. Abby intentionally releases the gas into the air. The gas reaches the town and turns its residents into deformed bloodthirsty, man- eating psychopaths, mockingly referred to as \\"sickos\\" by the surviving humans. The infected townspeople are treated by the sinister Dr. William Block and his abused, neglected anesthesiologist wife Dakota at a local hospital. As the patients quickly become enraged aggressors, Cherry and El Wray lead a team of accidental warriors into the night, struggling to find safety. ; Cast Death Proof Three friends – Arlene, Shanna, and radio disc jockey \\"Jungle\\" Julia – spend a night in Austin, Texas for fun, unknowingly followed by a mysterious man in a souped-up 1971 Chevy Nova. The man, Stuntman Mike, stalks the young women with his \\"death proof\\" car, eventually killing all three. Fourteen months later, Stuntman Mike, now in Tennessee and driving a 1969 Dodge Charger, tails another group of young women – Lee, Abernathy, and stuntwomen Kim and Zoë – a group of women working below the line in Hollywood, whose stock 1970 Dodge Challenger proves a worthy adversary. ; Cast Fictitious trailers Before each segment, there are trailers advertising fake films, as well as vintage theater snipes and an ad for a fictional restaurant called Acuña Boys. According to Rodriguez, it was Tarantino's idea to film fake trailers for Grindhouse. \\"I didn't even know about it until I read it in the trades. It said something like 'Rodriguez and Tarantino doing a double feature and Tarantino says there's gonna be fake trailers.' And I thought, 'There are?'\\" Rodriguez and Tarantino had originally planned to make all of the film's fake trailers themselves. According to Rodriguez, \\"We had so many ideas for trailers. I made Machete. I shot lobby cards and the poster and cut the trailer and sent it to Quentin, and he just flipped out because it looked so vintage and so real. He started showing it around to Eli Roth and to Edgar Wright, and they said, 'Can we do a trailer? We have an idea for a trailer!' We were like, 'Hey, let them shoot it. If we don't get around to shooting ours, we'll put theirs in the movie. If theirs come out really great, we'll put it in the movie to have some variety.' Then Rob Zombie came up to me in October at the Scream Awards and said, 'I have a trailer: Werewolf Women of the SS.' I said, 'Say no more. Go shoot it. You got me.'\\" Each trailer was shot in two days. While Wright and Roth shot only what ended up on screen, Zombie shot enough footage to work into a half-hour film and was particularly pained to edit it down. Some Canadian screening releases included the South by Southwest-winning trailer Hobo with a Shotgun. =Machete= Rodriguez wrote Machete in 1993 as a full feature for Danny Trejo. \\"I had cast him in Desperado and I remember thinking, 'Wow, this guy should have his own series of Mexploitation movies like Charles Bronson or like Jean-Claude Van Damme.' So I wrote him this idea of a federale from Mexico who gets hired to do hatchet jobs in the U.S. I had heard sometimes FBI or DEA have a really tough job that they don't want to get their own agents killed on, they'll hire an agent from Mexico to come do the job for $25,000. I thought, 'That's Machete. He would come and do a really dangerous job for a lot of money to him but for everyone else over here it's peanuts.' But I never got around to making it.\\" Trejo had previously portrayed the character in a supporting capacity in the Spy Kids film series, also directed by Rodriguez. The trailer was made into a feature film which was released in September 2010; a sequel, Machete Kills, followed in 2013. =Werewolf Women of the SS= Rob Zombie's contribution, Werewolf Women of the SS, starred Nicolas Cage as Fu Manchu; Udo Kier as Franz Hess, the commandant of Death Camp 13; Zombie's wife, Sheri, and Sybil Danning as SS officers/sisters Eva and Gretchen Krupp (The She-Devils of Belzac). Professional wrestlers Andrew \\"Test\\" Martin and Oleg \\"Vladimir Kozlov\\" Prudius also featured, plus Olja Hrustic, Meriah Nelson, and Lorielle New as the Werewolf Women. According to Zombie, \\"Basically, I had two ideas. It was either going to be a Nazi movie or a women-in-prison film, and I went with the Nazis. There're all those movies like Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS; Fräulein Devil; and Love Camp 7—I've always found that to be the most bizarre genre.\\" Zombie is also quoted as saying \\"I was getting very conceptual in my own mind with it. [...] A lot of times these movies would be made like, 'Well, you know, I've got a whole bunch of Nazi uniforms, but I got this Chinese set too. We'll put 'em together!' They start jamming things in there, so I took that approach.\\" =Don't= Edgar Wright's contribution, Don't, was produced in the style of a 1970s' Hammer House of Horror film trailer. The trailer featured appearances from Jason Isaacs, Matthew Macfadyen, singer Katie Melua, Lee Ingleby, Georgina Chapman, Emily Booth, Stuart Wilson, Lucy Punch, Rafe Spall, Wright regulars Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, and a voice-over by Will Arnett. Mark Gatiss, MyAnna Buring, Peter Serafinowicz, Michael Smiley and Nicola Cunningham (who played the zombie \\"Mary\\" in Shaun of the Dead), among others, made uncredited cameo appearances. To get the necessary 1970s look, Wright used vintage lenses and old-style graphics. During editing, he scratched some of the film with steel wool and dragged it around a parking lot to make it appear neglected by wayward projectionists. According to Wright, \\"In the '70s, when American International would release European horror films, they'd give them snazzier titles. And the one that inspired me was this Jorge Grau film: In the UK, it's called The Living Dead at Manchester Morgue. In Spain and in Italy, I think it's called Do Not Speak Ill of the Dead. But in the States, it was called Don't Open the Window. I just loved the fact that there isn't a big window scene in the film—it's all based around the spin and the voiceover not really telling you what the hell is going on in the film.\\" On the Charlie Rose talk show, Quentin Tarantino also pointed out another aspect of American advertising of British films in the 1970s that was being referenced—none of the actors have any dialogue in the trailer, as if the trailer was intentionally edited to prevent American viewers from realizing that the film is British. =Thanksgiving= Eli Roth directs the fictitious trailer Thanksgiving. Eli Roth's contribution is a promo for the slasher opus Thanksgiving. Produced in the style of holiday-themed slasher films like Halloween, Silent Night, Deadly Night, April Fool's Day and My Bloody Valentine, the trailer starred Jeff Rendell as a killer who stalks victims while dressed as a pilgrim; Jordan Ladd, Jay Hernandez, and Roth himself as his intended victims; and Michael Biehn as the Sheriff. The design for the titles in Thanksgiving was based on a Mad magazine slasher parody titled Arbor Day. Excerpts of the score from Creepshow were used in the faux trailer. According to Roth, \\"My friend Jeff, who plays the killer pilgrim – we grew up in Massachusetts, we were huge slasher movie fans and every November we were waiting for the Thanksgiving slasher movie. We had the whole movie worked out: A kid who's in love with a turkey, and then his father killed it, and then he killed his family and went away to a mental institution and came back and took revenge on the town. I called Jeff and said, 'Dude, guess what, we don't have to make the movie, we can just shoot the best parts.'\\" \\"Shooting the trailer was so much fun,\\" Roth has stated, \\"because every shot is a money shot. Every shot is decapitation or nudity. It's so ridiculous, it's absurd. It's just so wrong and sick that it's right.\\" Roth's fake trailer contained elements that almost earned Grindhouse an NC-17 rating, including a cheerleader simultaneously stripping, bouncing on a trampoline and getting stabbed in the vulva, and three decapitations; the first victim dressed as a pilgrim turkey at a parade gets decapitated and his headless body stumbles around in an exaggerated manner, the second occurs as the victim's girlfriend performs fellatio on him, and the last decapitation occurs on a man while he is being kissed by a female victim. According to Roth, \\"Instead of seeing it spread out in a feature, watching it all jammed together non-stop makes it more shocking. But we had a great discussion with the ratings board. They got it. Once they saw it with all the bad splices and the distress and scratches they were fine with it.\\" Roth confirmed in an interview with Cinema Blend's Eric Eisenberg that he and co-writer Jeff Rendell are working on a possible feature film. =Hobo with a Shotgun= Some screenings of Grindhouse (mainly in Canada) also featured a fake trailer for a film titled Hobo with a Shotgun. The trailer, created by Dartmouth, Nova Scotia filmmakers Jason Eisener, John Davies, and Rob Cotterill, won Robert Rodriguez's South by Southwest Grindhouse trailers contest. In the trailer, David Brunt plays a vagabond with a 20-gauge shotgun (changed to a 12-gauge for the actual movie) who becomes a vigilante. In the trailer, he is shown killing numerous persons, ranging from armed robbers to corrupt cops to a pedophilic Santa Claus. The trailer was available in certain selected movie theaters in the United States and Canada. In 2010, the trailer was made into a full-length feature film starring Rutger Hauer as the hobo, with David Brunt playing a dirty cop. Hobo with a Shotgun was the second of Grindhouses fake trailers to be turned into a feature film, the first being Machete. The film was released March 25, 2011 in Canada, April 1, 2011 on American Video On Demand and May 6, 2011 in U.S. theatres. History and development The poster for a double feature consisting of the films Dragstrip Girl and Rock All Night sparked the idea for Grindhouse. The idea for Grindhouse came to Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino when Tarantino set up screenings of double features in his house, complete with trailers before and in between the films. During one screening in 2003, Rodriguez noticed that he owned the same double feature movie poster as Tarantino for the 1957 films Dragstrip Girl and Rock All Night. Rodriguez asked Tarantino, \\"I always wanted to do a double feature. Hey, why don't you direct one and I'll do the other?\\" Tarantino quickly replied, \\"And we've got to call it Grindhouse!\\" The film's name originates from the American term for theaters that played \\"all the exploitation genres: kung fu, horror, Giallo, sexploitation, the 'good old boy' redneck car-chase movies, blaxploitation, spaghetti Westerns—all those risible genres that were released in the 70s.\\" According to Rodriguez, \\"The posters were much better than the movies, but we're actually making something that lives up to the posters.\\" Rodriguez first came up with the idea for Planet Terror during the production of The Faculty: \\"I remember telling Elijah Wood and Josh Hartnett, all these young actors, that zombie movies were dead and hadn't been around in a while, but that I thought they were going to come back in a big way because they’d been gone for so long. I said, 'We've got to be there first.' I had [a script] I’d started writing. It was about 30 pages, and I said to them, 'There are characters for all of you to play.' We got all excited about it, and then I didn't know where to go with it. The introduction was about as far as I'd gotten, and then I got onto other movies. Sure enough, the zombie [movie] invasion happened and they all came back again, and I was like, 'Ah, I knew that I should've made my zombie film.'\\" The story was reapproached when Tarantino and Rodriguez developed the idea for Grindhouse. As Planet Terror took shape, Tarantino developed the story for Death Proof, based on his fascination for the way stuntmen would \\"death-proof\\" their cars. As long as they were driving, stuntmen could slam their cars headfirst into a brick wall at 60 mph (97 km/h) and survive. This inspired Tarantino to create a slasher film featuring a deranged stuntman who stalks and murders sexy young women with his \\"death- proof\\" car. Tarantino remembers, \\"I realized I couldn't do a straight slasher film, because with the exception of women-in-prison films, there is no other genre quite as rigid. And if you break that up, you aren't really doing it anymore. It's inorganic, so I realized—let me take the structure of a slasher film and just do what I do. My version is going to be fucked up and disjointed, but it seemingly uses the structure of a slasher film, hopefully against you.\\" According to Rodriguez, \\"[Tarantino] had an idea and a complete vision for it right away when he first talked about it. He started to tell me the story and said, 'It's got this death-proof car in it.' I said, 'You have to call it Death Proof.' I helped title the movie, but that's it.\\" Of the car chases, Tarantino stated, \\"CGI for car stunts doesn't make any sense to me—how is that supposed to be impressive? [...] I don't think there have been any good car chases since I started making films in '92—to me, the last terrific car chase was in Terminator 2. And Final Destination 2 had a magnificent car action piece. In between that, not a lot. Every time a stunt happens, there's twelve cameras and they use every angle for Avid editing, but I don't feel it in my stomach. It's just action.\\" Production =Direction= According to actress Marley Shelton, \\"Rodriguez and Tarantino really co-directed, at least Planet Terror. Quentin was on set a lot. He had notes and adjustments to our performances and he changed lines every once in a while. Of course, he always deferred to Robert on Planet Terror and vice versa for Death Proof. So it's really both of their brainchild.\\" Tarantino has stated, \\"I can't imagine doing Grindhouse with any other director in the way me and Robert did it because I just had complete faith and trust in him. So much so that we didn't actually see each other's movie completed until three weeks before the film opened. It was as if we worked in little vacuums and cut our movies down, and then put them together and watched it all play, and then made a couple of little changes after that, and pretty much that was it.\\" =Casting= Many of the cast members had previously worked with both directors. Before appearing in Grindhouse, Marley Shelton had auditioned for The Faculty, but Rodriguez chose not to cast her. She was eventually cast in the role of a customer in the opening sequence of Sin City. Bruce Willis had appeared in both Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Rodriguez's Sin City, in addition to having a cameo appearance in a segment Tarantino directed for the anthology film Four Rooms. Tom Savini had previously acted in From Dusk Till Dawn, which was written by Tarantino and directed by Rodriguez. Michael Parks reprises the role of Earl McGraw in Planet Terror and Death Proof. Parks first portrayed the role in From Dusk Till Dawn. His son, James, appears in Death Proof as Edgar McGraw, a character that first appeared in From Dusk Till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money. The first time the two characters appeared together was in Tarantino's Kill Bill. Tarantino himself plays small roles in both segments of Grindhouse, and director Eli Roth, who contributed the fake trailer Thanksgiving and whose film Hostel was produced by Tarantino, has a cameo in Death Proof. Tarantino attempted to cast both Kal Penn and Sylvester Stallone in Death Proof, but both were unable to work due to prior commitments. In an interview, Tarantino revealed that he decided to cast Kurt Russell as the killer stunt driver because \\"for people of my generation, he's a true hero...but now, there's a whole audience out there that doesn't know what Kurt Russell can do. When I open the newspaper and see an ad that says 'Kurt Russell in Dreamer,' or 'Kurt Russell in Miracle,' I'm not disparaging these movies, but I'm thinking: When is Kurt Russell going to be a badass again?\\" Rodriguez later revealed that he cast Rose McGowan as Cherry Darling in response to McGowan's blacklisting from the productions of The Weinstein Company (then the parent company of Grindhouses distributor Dimension Films) following Harvey Weinstein's alleged sexual assault of her. =Cinematography= Rodriguez and Tarantino each acted as cinematographer on their segments. Although Rodriguez had previously worked as the cinematographer on six of his own feature films, Death Proof marked Tarantino's first credit as a cinematographer. The director of photography for Rob Zombie's fake trailer Werewolf Women of the SS was Phil Parmet, whom Zombie had first worked with on The Devil's Rejects. The director of photography for Eli Roth's fake trailer Thanksgiving was Milan Chadima, whom Roth had previously worked with on Hostel. =Special effects= The intentionally \\"aged\\" look of the film, as seen in the trailer Machete. Though set in the modern day, the film uses various unconventional techniques to make the films look like those that were shown in grindhouse theaters in the 1970s. Throughout both feature-length segments and the fake trailers, the film is intentionally damaged to make it look like many of the exploitation films of the 1970s, which were generally shipped around from theater to theater and usually ended up in bad shape. To reproduce the look of damaged film reels in Planet Terror, five of the six 25,000-frame reels were edited with real film damage, plug-ins, and stock footage. Planet Terror makes heavy use of digital effects throughout the film. Perhaps the most notable effect is Cherry's (Rose McGowan) fake leg. To accomplish the fake leg that Cherry sports after her accident, during post-production the effects teams digitally removed McGowan's right leg from the shots and replaced it with computer-generated props—first a table leg and then an M16 rifle. During shooting for these scenes, McGowan wore a special cast which restricted her leg movement to give her the correct motion, and helped the effects artists to digitally remove it during post- production. =Editing= During editing, Tarantino and Rodriguez came up with the idea of inserting \\"missing reels\\" into the film. \\"[Quentin] was about to show an Italian crime movie with Oliver Reed,\\" Rodriguez recalls, \\"and he was saying, 'Oh, it's got a missing reel in it. But it's really interesting because after the missing reel, you don't know if he slept with a girl or he didn't because she says he did and he says that he didn't. It leaves you guessing, and the movie still works with 20 minutes gone out of it.' I thought, 'Oh, my God, that's what we’ve got to do. We've got to have a missing reel!' I'm going to use it in a way where it actually says 'missing reel' for 10 seconds, and then when we come back, you're arriving in the third act. [...] The late second acts in movies are usually the most predictable and the most boring, that's where the good guy really turns out to be the bad guy, and the bad guy is really good, and the couple becomes friends. Suddenly, though, in the third act, all bets are off and it's a whole new story anyway.\\" On the editing of Death Proof, Tarantino stated \\"There is half-an-hour's difference between my Death Proof and what is playing in Grindhouse. [...] I was like a brutish American exploitation distributor who cut the movie down almost to the point of incoherence. I cut it down to the bone and took all the fat off it to see if it could still exist, and it worked.\\" An extended, 127-minute version of Death Proof was screened in competition for the Palme d'Or at the 60th Cannes Film Festival. Tarantino is quoted as saying \\"It works great as a double feature, but I'm just as excited if not more excited about actually having the world see Death Proof unfiltered. [...] It will be the first time everyone sees Death Proof by itself, including me.\\" Grindhouse is rated R in the United States for \\"strong graphic bloody violence and gore, pervasive language, some sexuality, nudity, and drug use\\". On March 15, 2007, The New York Post reported that the film would possibly require heavy and extensive cuts in order to avoid an NC-17 rating. Shortly after, the film officially received an R-rating from the MPAA. Ain't It Cool News reported that according to Tarantino, only minimal cuts were made which ended up totaling 20 seconds. =Soundtrack influences= The music for Planet Terror was composed by Rodriguez. Inspiration for his score came from John Carpenter, whose music was often played on set. A cover version of the Dead Kennedys' \\"Too Drunk to Fuck\\" performed by Nouvelle Vague was also featured. The soundtrack for Death Proof consists entirely of non-original music, including excerpts from the scores of other films. Soundtrack albums for both segments were released on April 3, 2007. Reception =Box office= Grindhouse did not perform well at the box office, surprising box office analysts and fans alike given the strong reviews and favorable media buzz. Costing $53 million to produce, Grindhouse opened poorly with \\"a disappointing $11.5 million\\" in the United States, making a per-theater average of $4,417; box office analysts originally predicted an opening weekend total of at least $20–$30 million. The opening weekend box office total stood below not only the second weekends of Blades of Glory and Meet the Robinsons, but also fell below the opening weekend gross of the poorly reviewed Are We Done Yet?. In an attempt to explain the film's disappointing opening weekend, box office analyst Brandon Gray suggested that Grindhouse \\"suffered the usual horror comedy dilemma that afflicted Snakes on a Plane and Slither among others: too funny to be scary, too scary to be funny.\\" Box office analyst Lee Tistaert of tracking website Lee's Movie Info compared the result with what may have happened if Tarantino's Kill Bill saga had been released as one film, instead of two separate volumes. \\"Is it possible that Tarantino got his wish this time as a result of two back-to-back $60 million grosses?\\" he asked. Others attributed the film's disappointing opening to the timing of Easter weekend, noting that the weekend is more tailored for family-oriented films or light-comedy, not exploitative horror films. The film's length—running more than three hours—also hurt, keeping away casual theater-goers and limiting the number of screenings that could be held in a day. Quentin Tarantino was quoted as saying about the film's box office results, \\"It was disappointing, yeah. But the movie worked with the audience. [...] People who saw it loved it and applauded. [...] I'm proud of my flop.\\" Harvey Weinstein said that he was so \\"incredibly disappointed\\" with the film's opening weekend that he was considering re-releasing it as two separate films and possibly adding back the \\"missing\\" scenes. The film altogether earned $25,422,088 in ticket sales. Grindhouse was separated and released internationally: Death Proof grossed $30,663,961, while Planet Terror grossed $10,871,224, bringing Grindhouse's total gross to $67 million. In 2017, Rodriguez told Variety that he thinks Weinstein \\"buried\\" the film, due to the director's decision to cast Rose McGowan in Planet Terror. The actress had previously accused Weinstein of raping her. =Critical reception= Grindhouse was embraced by critics; review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 84% of critics gave the film a positive review based on a sample of 195 reviews, with an average score of 7.38/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"Grindhouse delivers exhilarating exploitation fare with wit and panache, improving upon its source material with feral intelligence.\\" At the website Metacritic, which utilizes a weighted average rating system, the film earned a favorable rating of 77/100 based on 36 reviews by mainstream critics. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Entertainment Weekly awarded the film a \\"B+\\" rating, praising it as a \\"crazily funny and exciting tribute to the grimy glory days of 1970s exploitation films\\" that \\"will leave you laughing, gasping, thrilled at a movie that knows, at long last, how to put the bad back in badass.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a positive review, commenting that \\"by stooping low without selling out, this babes-and-bullets tour de force gets you high on movies again.\\" Critic James Berardinelli also enjoyed the film but was not as positive as other critics. Awarding the film three stars (out of four), Berardinelli found the film to be \\"cinema as an expression of pulp with attitude... [Rodriguez and Tarantino] are speaking from the hearts... but that doesn't mean everyone sitting in the theater will get it.\\" The critics who did not like the film were not amused by the film's graphic and comical violence, with Larry Ratliff of San Antonio Express-News noting that \\"this ambitious, scratched and weathered venture never manages a real death grip on the senses.\\" Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle awarded the film a high rating, but noted that \\"the Rodriguez segment is terrific; the Tarantino one long-winded and juvenile.\\" Others considered Death Proof to be a deeper and more noteworthy segment. Critic A. O. Scott of The New York Times noted that \\"[a]t a certain point in Death Proof the scratches and bad splices disappear, and you find yourself watching not an arch, clever pastiche of old movies and movie theaters but an actual movie.\\" Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert was divided. He gave Grindhouse as a whole two and a half stars out of four, awarding Planet Terror two stars and Death Proof three stars. Ebert also noted the irony of grindhouse films largely being superseded by many big-budget R-rated mainstream films that included a great deal of nudity and graphic violence. Critics generally enjoyed the fake trailers. Geoff Pevere of the Toronto Star wrote that the use of the trailers helps the film establish \\"its credibility as both mock-artifact and geeky fetish object even before the opening feature.\\" Todd McCarthy of Variety claimed that the trailers were \\"excellent candidates for exploitation immortality.\\" Jeff Vice of Deseret News, who gave the feature films negative reviews, called the trailers \\"... the strongest aspect of the entire presentation.\\" Maitland McDonagh of TV Guide added, \\"With the exception of Werewolf Women, which tries a little too hard, they're all spot-on pastiches.\\" The double feature appeared at number six on Jack Mathews and Owen Gleiberman's respective top ten lists for New York Daily News and Entertainment Weekly, and at number seven on Stephanie Zacharek's list for Salon. Marc Savlov listed Death Proof at number ten on his list for The Austin Chronicle. Release =Theatrical= Outside the US and Canada, Planet Terror and Death Proof were released separately in extended versions, approximately two months apart. The poster artwork for each film's release in the Netherlands claimed that Death Proof would feature \\"coming attractions\\" from Rodriguez, while Planet Terror would feature \\"coming attractions\\" from Tarantino. While the separated version of Planet Terror includes the Machete trailer, none of the other fake trailers were included when the features were released individually. In reaction to the possibility of a split in a foreign release, Tarantino stated \\"Especially if they were dealing with non-English language countries, they don't really have this tradition ... not only do they not really know what a grind house is, they don't even have the double feature tradition. So you are kind of trying to teach us something else.\\" Many European fans saw the split as an attempt to increase profits by forcing audiences to pay twice for what was shown as a single film in the United States. In the United Kingdom, Death Proof was released on September 21, 2007. The release of Planet Terror followed on November 9 with an eventual, theatrical, limited run of the entire Grindhouse feature the following year. Death Proof was screened in Europe in the extended version that was presented in competition at the Cannes film festival. The additional material includes scenes that were replaced in the American theatrical release version with a \\"missing reel\\" title card, such as the lap dance scene. A total of about 27 minutes were added for this version. In Australia, the edited version of Death Proof was first screened on November 1, 2007 as a separate film. However, from January 17, 2008, Grindhouse had limited screenings. In April 2008, Grindhouse was screened by Dendy Cinemas in one venue at a time across the country, through the use of a traveling 35 mm reel. In South America, Planet Terror was released in January 2010, while Death Proof was released in July 2010 at least in Brazil. =Home media= Death Proof and Planet Terror were released separately on DVD in the United States. The trailers were omitted from Death Proof, with the exception of Machete which was from Planet Terror. Death Proof was released on September 18, 2007, with Planet Terror following on October 16, 2007. Both were two-disc special editions featuring extended versions of the films. Robert Rodriguez stated in his 10-Minute Film School that a box set of the two films would be available soon, and that his 10-Minute Cook School would appear on it.Confirmed by Robert Rodriguez on the 10-Minute Film School feature on the Planet Terror DVD This release would also reportedly include Hobo with a Shotgun. A six-DVD edition of the film was released on March 21, 2008 in Japan, featuring the films in both their individual extended versions and in the abridged double feature presentation along with previously-unreleased special features. Planet Terror and Death Proof were released individually on Blu-ray Disc on December 16, 2008 in North America. The Blu-ray edition of Planet Terror also contained a \\"scratch-free\\" version of the film that removed much of the damage effects, while the Blu-ray edition of Death Proof only contained the \\"damaged\\" version of the film. The theatrical version of Grindhouse was released on Region 2 DVD and the stand-alone version of Death Proof HD DVD was released in Germany on December 31, 2009. A two-disc Blu-ray \\"Special Edition\\" of Grindhouse was released on October 5, 2010 in the US by Vivendi Entertainment and has exclusive bonus features. This release marks the first time that US viewers can view the full Grindhouse \\"Double Feature Presentation\\" experience at home as it was originally released in theaters. The first disc of the 2-disc set contains Death Proof and Planet Terror, along with the faux trailers, including the \\"trailer\\" for Machete. The theatrical cut was released on DVD in Canada from Alliance Atlantis. All of the extras from the previous individual DVD releases were included, however none of the extras from the Special Edition Blu-ray were included. Bill Moseley stated at FanExpo on August 27, 2010 that the Blu-ray would also include a 5-minute version of Werewolf Women of the SS. Adaptations of the fake trailers In 2010, Rodriguez wrote and co-directed a feature-length adaptation of his fake trailer, Machete. Many of the original actors from the trailer returned to their roles for it. Machete screened September 1 at the Venice Film Festival and was released across cinemas in the US on September 3, 2010. Machete turned out to be more of a success at the box office than Grindhouse, grossing $44 million internationally against a just-over $10 million budget. At the end of the film it is announced there will be two sequels, Machete Kills and Machete Kills Again. Soon afterward, Rodriguez confirmed that the financing for the sequels was in place, and that once everyone was free, they could begin shooting. A trailer that played in some theaters in the United States and Canada, Hobo with a Shotgun, was also adapted into a feature. Rutger Hauer replaced Dave Brunt as the titular character, though Brunt makes a cameo as a corrupt cop. These two adaptations received mainly positive reviews, with the general consensus being that they were cartoonishly enjoyable and gleefully violent homages to their reasons for being. Although Hobo with a Shotgun was not as big a box office success in the U.S. as it was in Canada, it has since gained a cult following there. Many of the other fake trailer directors have expressed interest in making their trailers into real films, including Edgar Wright and Eli Roth. Both Rodriguez and Tarantino have said that they are interested in making a sequel to Grindhouse. Tarantino said that he wants to shoot an \\"old-school Kung Fu movie in Mandarin with subtitles in some countries, and release a shorter, dubbed cut in others\\" for his segment. It has also been reported by Rotten Tomatoes that Edgar Wright may expand Don't into a feature film. According to Eli Roth, he and Wright have discussed the possibility of pairing Don't with Thanksgiving for a Grindhouse sequel. Roth is quoted as saying \\"We're talking to Dimension about it. I think they're still trying to figure out Grindhouse 1 before we think about Grindhouse 2, but I've already been working on the outline for it and I would do it in a heartbeat.\\" Electra and Elise Avellan, Rodriguez's nieces who play the Crazy Babysitter Twins in both films, originally stated their uncle wanted to do a sequel featuring both Machete and The Babysitter Twins, but the latter concept did not materialize with the former's release. \\"Robert mentioned something about the end of the world and Hollywood action films, where we'd be trained in Mexico to come back here and fight,\\" Electra Avellan told bloody- disgusting.com. A third feature-length film based on the trailers, the Robert Rodriguez-directed Machete Kills, was released at the end of 2013.

Built in 1750, it is a classic example of a large French Colonial plantation house in the United States. Exemplifying the style of the semi-tropical Louisiana river country house, the Parlange Plantation home is a two-story raised cottage. The main floor is set on a brick basement with brick pillars to support the veranda of the second story. The raised basement is of brick, manufactured by slaves on the plantation. The walls, both inside and out, were plastered with a native mixture of mud, sand, Spanish moss and animal hair (bousillage), then painted. The ground story and second floors contain seven service rooms, arranged in a double line. The walls and ceiling throughout the house were constructed of close-fitting bald cypress planks. There is an octagonal pigeonnier near the house. The home was once surrounded by a formal garden, but the garden was destroyed during the Civil War. History of the plantation and the Ternant-Parlange family Vincent de Ternant, known as the Marquis of Dansville-sur-Meuse, received the plantation grounds in a French land grant and developed the 10,000 acres (40 km²) into an active plantation facing False River. When de Ternant's son Claude inherited the plantation, he changed the cash crop from indigo to sugarcane and cotton. When Claude de Ternant died, his second wife Virginie remarried. (By her first husband, Virginie was the maternal grandmother of Parisian socialite Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau, who was the subject of John Singer Sargent's portrait \\"Madame X\\".) Virginie's second husband, another Frenchman, was Colonel Charles Parlange, from whom the plantation took its name. During the American Civil War, Parlange alternatively served as Union headquarters for General Nathaniel Banks and Confederate headquarters for General Richard Taylor. Colonel and Mrs. Parlange had one son, also named Charles, who survived the Civil War to begin a distinguished career as a State Senator, United States District Attorney, Lieutenant Governor, federal judge, and finally justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court. After Virginie Parlange died in 1887, her son and his wife moved to New Orleans. Judge and Mrs. Charles Parlange leased the plantation to tenants for the next twenty years, until their son Walter Parlange returned to Pointe Coupée Parish to take up the life of a plantation farmer. Today Parlange retains 1500 acres (6 km²), which are still used as a cattle and sugarcane plantation. It is owned and operated by descendants of the original owners. The plantation house remains largely intact and is occasionally available for private tours by appointment only. It is located near the intersection of Louisiana Highway 1 and Louisiana Highway 78. Popular culture The Parlange Plantation and the history of Virginie de Ternant was the inspiration for the Bagatelle Plantation and the heroine Virginie Tregan in the novel Louisiane by Maurice Denuzière.Dominique Auzias, Jean-Paul Labourdette: Petit Futé Louisiane See also *List of National Historic Landmarks in Louisiana *National Register of Historic Places listings in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana References National Historic Landmarks in Louisiana Houses completed in 1750 Plantation houses in Louisiana Sugar plantations in Louisiana French Colonial architecture French Houses in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana Cotton plantations in the United States National Register of Historic Places in Pointe Coupee Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Parlange Plantation House"},{"id":"2819592","text":"An example of two-stroke oil bottle with measurement cap. Oil is dyed blue to make it easier to recognize it in the gasoline. Because it's not diluted, it appears black in this bottle. Two-stroke oil (also referred to as two-cycle oil, 2-cycle oil, 2T oil, or 2-stroke oil) is a special type of motor oil intended for use in crankcase compression two-stroke engines. Unlike a four- stroke engine, whose crankcase is closed except for its ventilation system, a two-stroke engine uses the crankcase as part of the induction tract, and therefore, oil must be mixed with gasoline to be distributed throughout the engine for lubrication. The resultant mix is referred to as premix or petroil. This oil is ultimately burned along with the fuel as a total-loss oiling system. This results in increased exhaust emissions, sometimes with excess smoke and/or a distinctive odor. The oil-base stock can be petroleum, castor oil, semi-synthetic or synthetic oil and is mixed (or metered by injection) with petrol/gasoline at a volumetric fuel-to-oil ratio ranging from 16:1 to as low as 100:1. To avoid the high emissions and oily deposits on spark plugs, modern two-strokes, especially for small engines such as garden equipment and chainsaws, may now demand a synthetic oil and can suffer from oiling problems otherwise. Engine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) introduced pre- injection systems (sometimes known as \\"auto-lube\\") to engines to operate from a 32:1 to 100:1 ratio. Oils must meet or exceed the following typical specifications: TC-W3TM, NMMA, [API] TC, JASO FC, ISO-L-EGC. Comparing regular lubricating oil with two-stroke oil, the relevant difference is that two-stroke oil must have a much lower ash content. This is required to minimize deposits that tend to form if ash is present in the oil which is burned in the engine's combustion chamber. Additionally a non-2T-specific oil can turn to gum in a matter of days if mixed with gasoline and not immediately consumed. Another important factor is that 4-stroke engines have a different requirement for 'stickiness' than 2-strokes do. Since the 1980s different types of two-stroke oil have been developed for specialized uses such as outboard motor two-strokes, premix two-stroke oil, as well as the more standard auto lube (motorcycle) two-stroke oil. As a rule of thumb, most containers of oil commercially offered will have somewhere on the label printed that it is compatible with 'Autolube' or injector pumps. Those bottles tend to have the consistency of liquid dish soap if shaken. A more viscous oil cannot reliably be passed through an injection system, although a premix machine can be run on either type. \\"Racing\\" oil or castor-based does offer excellent lubricity - at the expense of premature coking. For the average moped/scooter/trail rider it will not garner an appreciable increase in performance and will require very frequent teardowns.  Additive ingredients  Additives for two-stroke oils fall into several general categories: Detergent/Dispersants, Antiwear agents, Biodegradability components and antioxidants (Zinc compounds). Some of the higher quality include a fuel stabilizer as well.  International Standards  2-Stroke-Oil can be classified in these Categories: JASO FA JASO FB ~ ISO EGB JASO FC ~ ISO EGC JASO FD ISO L-EGD (Standard with the most rigorous Testing Procedure)  See also  * API-TC  References  External links *How Two-stroke Engines Work Two- stroke Engine lubrication systems ","title":"Two-stroke oil"},{"id":"2819621","text":"Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. 717 (1952), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that a dual U.S./Japanese citizen could be convicted of treason against the United States for acts performed in Japan during World War II.Kawakita v. United States, . Tomoya Kawakita, born in California to Japanese parents, was in Japan when the war broke out and stayed in Japan until the war was over. After returning to the United States, he was arrested and charged with treason for having mistreated American prisoners of war. Kawakita claimed he could not be found guilty of treason because he had lost his U.S. citizenship while in Japan, but this argument was rejected by the courts (including the Supreme Court), which ruled that he had in fact retained his U.S. citizenship during the war. Originally sentenced to death, Kawakita's sentence was commuted to life imprisonment, and he was eventually released from prison, deported to Japan, and barred from ever returning to the United States.  Background  was born in Calexico, California, on September 26, 1921, of Japanese-born parents. He was born with U.S. citizenship due to his place of birth, and also Japanese nationality via his parents. After finishing high school in Calexico in 1939, Kawakita traveled to Japan with his father (a grocer and merchant). He remained in Japan and enrolled in Meiji University in 1941. In 1943, he registered officially as a Japanese national. Kawakita was in Japan when the attack on Pearl Harbor drew the United States and Japan into World War II. In 1943, he took a job as an interpreter at a mining and metal processing plant which used Allied prisoners of war (POWs) as laborers. By early 1945, the population of the POW camp included about four hundred captured American troops. After the end of the war, Kawakita renewed his U.S. passport, explaining away his having registered as a Japanese national by claiming he had acted under duress. He returned to the U.S. in 1946 and enrolled at the University of Southern California. In October 1946, a former POW saw Kawakita in a Los Angeles department store and recognized him from the war. He reported this encounter to the FBI, and in June 1947, Kawakita was arrested and charged with multiple counts of treason arising from alleged abuse of American POWs.  Trial and appeal At Kawakita's trial, presided over by U.S. District Judge William C. Mathes, the defense conceded that Kawakita had acted abusively toward American POWs, but argued that his actions were relatively minor, and that in any event, they could not constitute treason against the United States because Kawakita was not a U.S. citizen at the time, having lost his U.S. citizenship when he confirmed his Japanese nationality in 1943. The prosecution argued that Kawakita had known he was still a U.S. citizen and still owed allegiance to the country of his birth—citing the statements he had made to consular officials when applying for a new passport as evidence that he had never intended to give up his U.S. citizenship. Tomoya Kawakita, in a photograph taken at his 1948 trial for treason Judge Mathes's instructed the jury that if they found that Kawakita had genuinely believed he was no longer a U.S. citizen, then he must be found not guilty of treason. During the course of their deliberations, the jury reported several times that they were hopelessly deadlocked, but the judge insisted each time that they continue trying to reach a unanimous verdict. In the end—on September 2, 1948—the jury found Kawakita guilty of eight of the thirteen counts of treason against him, and he was sentenced to death. As a consequence of his conviction for treason, Kawakita's U.S. citizenship was also revoked. In passing sentence, Mathes said: \\"Reflection leads to the conclusion that the only worthwhile use for the life of a traitor, such as this defendant has proved to be, is to serve as an example to those of weak moral fiber who may hereafter be tempted to commit treason against the United States.\\" Kawakita appealed to a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which unanimously upheld the verdict and death sentence. Certiorari was granted by the United States Supreme Court,Kawakita v. United States, (granting certiorari). and oral arguments before the Supreme Court were heard on April 3, 1952.  Opinion of the Court  Associate Justice William O. Douglas wrote the opinion of the Court in the Kawakita case. In a 4–3 decision issued on June 2, 1952, the Supreme Court upheld Kawakita's treason conviction and death sentence. The Court's opinion was written by Associate Justice William O. Douglas, joined by Associate Justices Stanley F. Reed, Robert H. Jackson, and Sherman Minton. The Court's majority held that the jury in Kawakita's trial had been justified in concluding that he had not lost or given up his U.S. citizenship while he was in Japan during the war. The Court added that an American citizen owed allegiance to the United States, and could be found guilty of treason, no matter where he lived—even for actions committed in another country that also claimed him as a citizen. Further, given the flagrant nature of Kawakita's actions, the majority found that the trial judge had not acted arbitrarily in imposing a death sentence. = Dissent = Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson wrote the dissent in the Kawakita case. Chief Justice Fred M. Vinson authored a dissenting opinion, which was joined by Associate Justices Hugo Black and Harold H. Burton. The dissent concluded that \\"for over two years, [Kawakita] was consistently demonstrating his allegiance to Japan, not the United States. As a matter of law, he expatriated himself as well as that can be done.\\" On this basis, the dissenting justices would have reversed Kawakita's treason conviction.  Subsequent developments  On October 29, 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower commuted Kawakita's sentence to life imprisonment plus a $10,000 fine. After the commutation of his sentence, Kawakita was transferred to the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary. Ten years later, on October 24, 1963, President John F. Kennedy—in what would be one of his last official acts before his assassination—ordered Kawakita released from prison on the condition that he leave the United States and be banned from ever returning.

In 1978, Kawakita sought permission to travel to the United States to visit his parents' grave, but his efforts were unsuccessful. As of late 1993, he was living quietly with relatives in Japan.

She was launched in 2006 on the Clyde and conducted contractor's sea trials during 2007 and 2008. She was handed over to the Royal Navy in December 2008, entered her base port of Portsmouth for the first time in January 2009 and was formally commissioned on 23 July 2009. As the lead ship of the first destroyer class built for the Royal Navy since the Type 42 in the 1970s, she has attracted significant media and public attention. Her name, crest and motto are a reference to the Roman youth Gaius Mucius Scaevola, famed for his bravery. Construction Darings construction began at the BAE Systems Naval Ships yard (now BAE Systems Surface Ships) at Scotstoun on the River Clyde in March 2003. The ship was launched at 14.21 GMT on 1 February 2006. The Countess of Wessex was the ship's sponsor at her launch. On 16 November 2006, the Countess of Wessex brought Daring to life on her first official visit. On 17 November 2006, the countess switched on the ship's diesel generators, part of the 'powering up' ceremony. Sea trials On 18 July 2007 Daring sailed on the first set of sea trials (Stage 1.1), successfully completing them four weeks later on 14 August 2007. As she is the first in the class some structural areas needed to be tested, including the loads that the main 4.5-inch Mark 8 naval gun puts on the ship. During these trials, Daring reached her design speed of in 70 seconds and achieved a speed of in 120 seconds. She sailed for Stage 1.2 on 30 March 2008 and returned on 2 May. Stage 1.2 included trials on the Long Range Radar and navigation system, medium calibre gun blast trials, weapon alignment tests and endurance tests. Stage 1.3 trials were conducted between 26 August and 22 September 2008 and emphasis was placed on testing the full range of communications equipment. The ship's company used the opportunity to conduct familiarisation and training activities in preparation for the transfer of the vessel to the Royal Navy in December 2008. Stage 2 trials took place in 2009, once the ship had been handed over to the Royal Navy. HMS Daring arrived in her home port of Portsmouth on 28 January 2009 to large crowds along the seafront. She was given the honour of a flypast to coincide with her passing of the Round Tower, just outside Portsmouth. Operational service Visiting Gibraltar in 2016 Daring was formally commissioned on 23 July 2009 with The Countess of Wessex inspecting an honour guard on the quayside, and reception. The commissioning cake was cut by the wife of the commanding officer and Able Seaman Daniel Small, who was the youngest member of the ship's company. Daring was declared officially \\"in service\\" one year later, on 31 July 2010. Daring fired her first Sea Viper missile in May 2011 during a test launch in the Outer Hebrides, after years of trials. During the same year she was equipped with two Phalanx CIWS mounted on either side of the superstructure. On 6 January 2012, the Royal Navy announced that Daring would leave Portsmouth on 11 January 2012 to undertake her first mission, a deployment to the Persian Gulf. Daring travelled through the Suez Canal on 2 February 2012, then continued on to the Persian Gulf, relieving the Type 23 frigate that was on station there. In February 2012, as part of the Persian Gulf deployment, Daring joined Operation Scimitar Anzac, an anti-piracy operation in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. This international operation included the Royal Fleet Auxiliary , the Royal Australian Navy frigate , and the Pakistan Navy's PNS Babur. Daring acted as the command ship for all the vessels. During operation in the Persian Gulf and North Arabian Sea, Daring operated with the U.S. Navy's Carrier Strike Group One and Carrier Strike Group Nine. In September 2013, Daring transited the Panama Canal on deployment to the Pacific Ocean. She made port visits to the US Naval Base San Diego, Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam, and the Marshall Islands. While in the Pacific, Daring took part in the Royal Australian Navy's International Fleet Review 2013 at Sydney and also participated in the 2013 Five Power Defence Arrangements exercise, Bersama Lima. During Bersama Lima, Daring was urgently dispatched to the Philippines as part of the British government's humanitarian response to Typhoon Haiyan. Before her return to the United Kingdom, Daring made port visits in Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia. On 4 July 2016, Daring fired an Aster 30 off the coast of Scotland. In September 2016 Daring deployed to the Persian Gulf to assist in Operation Inherent Resolve. In April 2017, after being relieved East of Suez by , Daring transited the Bosphorus for exercises in the Black Sea with the Romanian Navy. , Daring has been laid up since 2017, pending a refit.https://twitter.com/NavyLookout/status/1152873506968940549 Characteristics Affiliations =Ship's sponsor= *The Countess of Wessex =Official affiliations= *City of Birmingham * Warwickshire District Sea Cadets *Guernsey *The Royal Dragoon Guards *No. 11 Squadron RAF * (Birmingham Royal Naval Reserve) *The Daring Association *King Edward's School, Birmingham *4th Knowle Sea Scout Group *Worshipful Company of Carpenters (A City of London Livery Company) *Birmingham University Royal Naval Unit *The D-Boats Association *Midland Naval Officers Association *Daring Class Yachts Notes References External links 2006 ships Active destroyers of the United Kingdom Ships built on the River Clyde Type 45 destroyers ","title":"HMS Daring (D32)"},{"id":"2819636","title":"Hornchurch F.C."},{"id":"2819652","text":"Marilyn Miller (born Mary Ellen Reynolds; September 1, 1898 – April 7, 1936) was one of the most popular Broadway musical stars of the 1920s and early 1930s. She was an accomplished tap dancer, singer and actress, and it was the combination of these talents that endeared her to audiences. On stage, she usually played rags-to-riches Cinderella characters who lived happily ever after. Her enormous popularity and famed image were in distinct contrast to her personal life, which was marred by disappointment, tragedy, frequent illness, and ultimately her sudden death due to complications of nasal surgery at age 37. Early life Marilyn Miller was born in 1898 in Evansville, Indiana, the youngest daughter of Edwin D. Reynolds, a telephone lineman, and his first wife, the former Ada Lynn Thompson.Staff (March 20, 1942) \\"Marilyn Miller's Mother Dies\\" The New York Times, p.19 The tiny, delicately featured blonde was only four years old when she debuted in the role of Mademoiselle Sugarlump at Lakeside Park in Dayton, Ohio, performing as a member of her family's vaudeville act, anamed The Columbian Trio. That act, which included her stepfather Oscar Caro Miller and her older sisters Ruth and Claire, was renamed the Five Columbians after she and her mother joined the routine. From their home base in Findlay, Ohio, the five toured the Midwest and Europe for 10 years and managed during that time to skirt the child labor authorities until Lee Shubert discovered Miller at the Lotus Club in London in 1914. Miller, on the cover of the June 24, 1922 Movie Weekly. Career Miller appeared in New York City for the Shuberts in the 1914 and 1915 editions of The Passing Show, a Broadway revue at the Winter Garden Theatre, as well as in The Show of Wonders (1916) and Fancy Free (1918). It was, however, Florenz Ziegfeld who made her a star after she performed in his Ziegfeld Follies of 1918 in Manhattan at the New Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street, with music by Irving Berlin. Sharing billing with Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers and W.C. Fields, she brought the house down with her impersonation of Billie Burke, Ziegfeld's wife, in a number titled \\"Mine Was a Marriage of Convenience\\". Miller followed as a headliner in the Follies of 1919, dancing to Berlin's \\"Mandy\\" and reputedly became Ziegfeld's mistress, though this was never proven. She attained legendary status in the Ziegfeld production Sally (1920) with music by Jerome Kern, especially for her performance of Kern's \\"Look for the Silver Lining\\". The musical, about a dishwasher who joins the Follies and marries a millionaire, ran 570 performances at the New Amsterdam. In 1921, the still- obscure Dorothy Parker memorialized her performance in verse: > From the alley's gloom and chill / Up to fame danced Sally. / Which was nice > for her, but still / Rough upon the alley. / How it must regret her wiles. / > All her ways and glances. / Now the theatre owns her smiles, / Sallies, > songs, and dances. ...Parker, Dorothy (December 15, 1921) \\"Marilyn Miller.\\" > Life. p.5 Poster for the 1929 film version of Sally After a rift with Ziegfeld, Miller signed with rival producer Charles Dillingham and starred as Peter Pan in a 1924 Broadway revival, then as a circus queen in Sunny (1925), with music by Kern and lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein. A box-office smash, it featured the classic \\"Who?\\", and made her the highest paid star on Broadway. In 1928, after reuniting with Ziegfeld, she starred in his production of the successful George Gershwin musical Rosalie, then in Smiles (1930) with Fred Astaire, one of Ziegfeld's rare box-office failures. Miller's movie career was short-lived and less successful than her stage career. She made only three films: adaptations of Sally (1929), Sunny (1930), and Her Majesty, Love (1931), with W.C. Fields. Her last Broadway show, marking a major comeback, was the innovative 1933-1934 Irving Berlin/Moss Hart musical As Thousands Cheer, in which she appeared in the production number \\"Easter Parade\\". Miller's appearance in As Thousands Cheer was her last professional outing. She quit the show after her boyfriend and future husband Chester O'Brien - a chorus dancer who served as the production's second assistant stage manager - was fired for allowing the Woolworth department store heir Jimmy Donahue to sneak onstage during a scene in which she was impersonating his cousin, the heiress Barbara Hutton. After her death, this incident gave Irving Berlin the inspiration for a film musical On the Avenue, for which he received a script credit in addition to writing the songs. At the time of her death, Miller was described as being in retirement. Origin of stage name Miller's last name was adopted from the surname of her stepfather, Oscar Caro Miller, while her first name was formed by combining her birth name, Mary, with her mother's middle name, Lynn. Initially calling herself Marilynn, she would drop one \\"n\\" at the urging of Florenz Ziegfeld. In the late 1940s, Norma Jeane Baker (née Mortenson) changed her name to Marilyn Monroe at the urging of Ben Lyon, a one-time actor turned casting director at 20th Century Fox, who said she reminded him of Miller - he had played Miller's love interest in Her Majesty, Love. Monroe had the name Marilyn Miller when she married the playwright Arthur Miller in 1956.

He was portrayed by Gordon MacRae in the Miller biopic Look for the Silver Lining and by Walter Willison in Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women. * Jack Pickford, an actor and the brother of film star Mary Pickford. They were married in 1922, separated in 1926, and divorced in Versailles, France, in November 1927. By all accounts it was an abusive marriage due to Pickford's substance abuse (both alcohol and hard drugs). Miller had attempted to secure a divorce in the Paris courts in the spring of 1927, but her published comments about how easy it would be to end her marriage in France \\"stirred the ire of the Paris Tribunal with the result that the court would take no action on Miss Miller's petition\\". She filed for divorce the following July in the nearby city of Versailles, whose tribunal eventually ended the marriage.Staff (November 3, 1927) \\"Marilyn Miller Gets French Divorce\\" The New York Times * Jack Donohue, a dancer who went on to become a successful director and choreographer in theater, films, and television.

He also was the stage manager and an actor on Sesame Street from the premiere of the show in 1969 until 1992. In 1930, Miller briefly was engaged to Michael Farmer,Staff (March 24, 1930) \\"Marilyn Miller Engaged to Wed\\" The New York Times who later became a husband of Gloria Swanson.

According to reports shortly before her death, she entered a New York hospital in early March 1936 to recover from a nervous breakdown.Staff (March 31, 1936) \\"Marilyn Miller Worse\\" The New York Times Three weeks later, however, she developed a toxic condition and died from complications following surgery on her nasal passages at age 37 in New York City on the morning of April 7, 1936. Miller’s funeral was held at Saint Bartholomew Church on Park Avenue which drew 2,500 people, including former mayor Jimmy Walker, Beatrice Lillie, and Billie Burke. The procession led to Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, where Miller was buried alongside her first husband, Frank Carter, in a mausoleum she had constructed to house his remains. Memorials A statue of Miller, in the title role of Sunny, can still be seen atop the former I.

Biographies (film and print) In 1949, a sanitized biopic, appropriately titled Look for the Silver Lining, starred June Haver as Miller. She was portrayed by Judy Garland in Till the Clouds Roll By, MGM's biopic of Jerome Kern. In 1978, the story of her tempestuous relationship with Ziegfeld was portrayed in the Emmy- winning made-for-TV biopic Ziegfeld: The Man and His Women, starring Pamela Peadin as Miller, Paul Shenar as Ziegfeld, and Walter Willison as Frank Carter. Rare film footage of Miller in the 1929 film version of Sally can also be seen in the 2004 PBS documentary series Broadway, the American Musical. In the only published biography of Miller, The Other Marilyn (1985), author Warren G. Harris describes her as \\"Ziegfeld's most dazzling star\\" and the premier musical comedy star of the Jazz Age. He adds, \\"She had rivals who may have been better dancers, singers, actresses, or mimics, but no one individual could equal her when it came to combining all those talents.\\" Filmography * Sally (1929) * Sunny (1930) * Her Majesty, Love (1931) All three films survive in some form, but Sally, filmed entirely in two-color Technicolor, now exists only in black-and-white, except for one fragment - most of the \\"Wild Rose\\" musical number - that has survived from an original Technicolor print.

It is an essential step in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals such as antibiotics, hormones (e.g. insulin and humans growth hormone), antibodies (e.g. infliximab and abciximab) and vaccines; antibodies and enzymes used in diagnostics; industrial enzymes; and natural fragrance and flavor compounds. Downstream processing is usually considered a specialized field in biochemical engineering, itself a specialization within chemical engineering, though many of the key technologies were developed by chemists and biologists for laboratory-scale separation of biological products. Downstream processing and analytical bioseparation both refer to the separation or purification of biological products, but at different scales of operation and for different purposes. Downstream processing implies manufacture of a purified product fit for a specific use, generally in marketable quantities, while analytical bioseparation refers to purification for the sole purpose of measuring a component or components of a mixture, and may deal with sample sizes as small as a single cell.  Stages  A widely recognized heuristic for categorizing downstream processing operations divides them into four groups which are applied in order to bring a product from its natural state as a component of a tissue, cell or fermentation broth through progressive improvements in purity and concentration. Removal of insolubles is the first step and involves the capture of the product as a solute in a particulate-free liquid, for example the separation of cells, cell debris or other particulate matter from fermentation broth containing an antibiotic. Typical operations to achieve this are filtration, centrifugation, sedimentation, precipitation, flocculation, electro-precipitation, and gravity settling. Additional operations such as grinding, homogenization, or leaching, required to recover products from solid sources such as plant and animal tissues, are usually included in this group. Product isolation is the removal of those components whose properties vary considerably from that of the desired product. For most products, water is the chief impurity and isolation steps are designed to remove most of it, reducing the volume of material to be handled and concentrating the product. Solvent extraction, adsorption, ultrafiltration, and precipitation are some of the unit operations involved. Product purification is done to separate those contaminants that resemble the product very closely in physical and chemical properties. Consequently, steps in this stage are expensive to carry out and require sensitive and sophisticated equipment. This stage contributes a significant fraction of the entire downstream processing expenditure. Examples of operations include affinity, size exclusion, reversed phase chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, crystallization and fractional precipitation. Product polishing describes the final processing steps which end with packaging of the product in a form that is stable, easily transportable and convenient. Crystallization, desiccation, lyophilization and spray drying are typical unit operations. Depending on the product and its intended use, polishing may also include operations to sterilize the product and remove or deactivate trace contaminants which might compromise product safety. Such operations might include the removal of viruses or depyrogenation. A few product recovery methods may be considered to combine two or more stages. For example, expanded bed adsorption (Vennapusa et al. 2008) accomplishes removal of insolubles and product isolation in a single step. Affinity chromatography often isolates and purifies in a single step.

Their last use was to scrap their own line in 1953. Knott purchased the RGS Motor #3, which is run on the GT&C; during the off-season – when there aren't sufficient passengers to justify hostling a steam locomotive. The Galloping Goose was constructed from a Pierce-Arrow limousine frame, engine, radiator, cowling and body with a four- wheel bogie truck at the front and putting flanged wheels on the rear axle. Later a bogie truck replaced the rear axle, linked to the front truck by a chain drive. A RGS shop-built freight box (converted with trolley seats for passenger service in 1950) articulates on the kingpin over the chain driven center truck. The wooden limousine body was replaced after World War II with a 1939 Wayne military-surplus bus body with both left and right doors. The Pierce-Arrow gasoline engine has been replaced, first with a war-surplus GMC gasoline engine at the RGS, then at Knott's with a war-surplus in-line 6 cylinder Diamond-Reo gasoline engine. In 1997 the engine was replaced once more with a Cummins Diesel engine supported with an I-beam frame extension salvaged from the demolished Windjammer Surf Racers roller coaster. In late 1973, the park received ex-D&RGW; K-27 #464, a Mikado locomotive. However, due to clearance issues, Knott's later donated the locomotive to the Huckleberry Railroad in Flint, Michigan.Resolution by Parks and Recreation Committee. City of Flint, MI.

The planned restoration of this locomotive did not happen and it was sold in 2017 to Garner Holt of Garner Holt Productions, who is planning to restore it to operating condition. Rolling Stock =Revenue= When the route opened on January 12, 1952 for passenger service, the locomotives would haul several yellow vintage closed- vestibule wooden passenger coaches led by a No. 103 parlor car Chama which was converted at Knott's in 1954 to combination baggage/coach Calico with arrows simulating an Indian attack embedded near the baggage door. The arrows have since been removed and the cars have been painted in heritage period Pullman- green livery of D&RGW.; The consist also includes a gondola (converted from a flat car for open-air passenger seating), and a stock car which was converted from a gondola, fitted with side benches and a wheelchair lift.

His Guantanamo Internment Serial Number was 546. American intelligence analysts estimate that Muhibullah was born in 1982, in Shah Wali Koot, Afghanistan. He was captured in Afghanistan in November 2001, transferred to Guantanamo on May 5, 2002, and was transferred to Afghanistan on July 19, 2005. US Intelligence analysts have asserted that Muhibullah was a recidivist, who, after his transfer, \\"engaged in terrorism or militant activity\\" and had \\"re-engaged in terrorism\\". When Borekzai and fellow Afghan captive Habir Russol were repatriated in July 2005, they provided the first account of a widespread hunger strike. Borekzai also offered accounts of Quran abuse. Conflicting accounts of his real name Guantanamo contained at least two captives with very similar names. Guantanamo captive 974 was listed as Mohe Bullar on the official lists released on April 20, 2006, and May 15, 2006. * He was listed as Mohib Ullah on his Joint Task Force Guantanamo assessment, date November 15, 2003. * He was listed as FNU Muhibullah on the Summary of Evidence memos drafted for his 2004 and 2005 OARDEC status reviews, and on the official lists of captives first published in 2006. However, in the Associated Press interview he gave upon his repatriation his name was listed as Moheb Ullah Borezkai. Official status reviews Initially the Bush administration asserted that they could withhold all the protections of the Geneva Conventions to captives from the war on terror. However, in 2004, in Rasul v. Bush the United States Supreme Court ruled that the captives had to be informed of the justifications for their detention, and had to be given an opportunity to try to refute those allegations.Guantánamo Prisoners Getting Their Day, but Hardly in Court, New York Times, November 11, 2004 - mirror Inside the Guantánamo Bay hearings: Barbarian \\"Justice\\" dispensed by KGB-style \\"military tribunals\\", Financial Times, December 11, 2004 =Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants= In response to the Supreme Court ruling in Rasul v. Bush the Department of Defense set up the Office for the Administrative Review of Detained Enemy Combatants, which conducted annual reviews of the captives status. Borekzai had reviews scheduled in 2004, and he chose to attend both of them. According to Andy Worthington, the author of The Guantanamo Files Borekzai had been a Taliban conscript, who was taken captive by post-Taliban forces, handed over the powerful militia leader Ismael Khan, who, in turn, sold him the US forces. Worthington noted with skepticism that American analysts accepted the claim that 19-year-old conscript Borekzai was the \\"acting governor of Sheberghan\\". Addressing the claim of American analysts that he \\"was part of a tribal militia that supported the Taliban for three and a half years since 1998″ Worthington pointed out that \\"he was 15 or 16 years old, and was therefore not responsible for his actions, which, presumably, were dictated by his family.″ Muhibullah chose to participate in his Combatant Status Review Tribunal.[ Summarized transcripts (.pdf)], from Muhibullah's Combatant Status Review Tribunal - pages 64-76 =Allegations= The allegations Muhibullah faced, during his Tribunal, were: =Response to the allegations= *Muhibullah confirmed that he worked as a guard to Syed Sha Agha, but he disputed that he did so for a year and a half. Rather he was forcibly conscripted twice. Both times for periods of two or three months. *Muhibullah repeatedly stated that he did not understand the European date system. *Muhibullah stated that, in addition to guard duty his responsibilities including kitchen and other household chores. *Muhibullah confirmed his presence at a dinner where Commandant Kamal was present. But he did not know Kamal. He wasn't invited by Kamal. He was present merely to perform guard duty. *Muhibullah denied knowing anyone named Abdul Ghafar. Administrative Review Board hearing Detainees who were determined to have been properly classified as \\"enemy combatants\\" were scheduled to have their dossier reviewed at annual Administrative Review Board hearings. The Administrative Review Boards were not authorized to review whether a detainee qualified for POW status, and they were not authorized to review whether a detainee should have been classified as an \\"enemy combatant\\". They were authorized to consider whether a detainee should continue to be detained by the United States, because they continued to pose a threat—or whether they could safely be repatriated to the custody of their home country, or whether they could be set free. The factors for and against continuing to detain Muhibullah were among the 121 that the Department of Defense released on March 3, 2006.[ Factors for and against the continued detention (.pdf)] of Muhibullah Administrative Review Board - page 82 =The following primary factors favor continued detention= =The following primary factors favor release or transfer= =Transcript= Muhibullah chose to participate in his Administrative Review Board hearing.[ Summarized transcript (.pdf)], from Muhibullah's Administrative Review Board hearing - page 8 Repatriation On November 26, 2008 the Department of Defense published a list of when captives left Guantanamo. According to that list Mohibullah was repatriated on July 19, 2005. Reporters interviewed Borekzai, and Habir Russol, another Afghan who was released at the same time, on July 20, 2005, the day they arrived home. In this interview they revealed that Camp Delta was in the midst of a widespread hunger strike. Borekzai and Russol estimated that over 180 detainees were participating in the hunger strike, and that it had been going on for over two weeks. Initially DoD spokesman Flex Plexico denied any knowledge of a hunger strike. In her book Democracy Detained: Secret Unconstitutional Practices in the U.S. War on Terror Barbara Olshansky, a senior lawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights, attributed the first public news of the hunger strike to Borekzai and Russol. She noted that DoD press officers initially denied there was a hunger strike, but that \\"over the course of the week following Russol and Borezkai's public announcement, the Defense Department was forced to admit that yet another strike was ongoing.\\" On July 21, 2005, three days after their departure, Plexico claimed that only a small number of detainees had been refusing food, and that they had only been doing so for three days. The lawyers of Guantanamo details later corroborated the details of the Afghans claims, saying that they had been aware of the hunger strike as early as June 23, 2005, but had not been able to say anything because of a DoD gag place on them. Borekzai told the Associated Press the detainees were protesting because \\"some of these people say they were mistreated during interrogation. Some say they are innocent.\\" The two Afghans said they had been accused of being members of the former Taliban regime, but both said they were innocent. Borekzai said that camp authorities had announced over the camp public address system that guards would stop showing disrespect to Quran, and that he was not aware of any recent incidents. Pentagon claim he had \\"returned to the fight\\" On May 20, 2009, the New York Times, citing an unreleased Pentagon document, reported that Department of Defense officials claimed Mohibullah was one of 74 former Guantanatmo captives who \\"are engaged in terrorism or militant activity.\\" On May 27, 2009, the Defense Intelligence Agency published a \\"fact sheet\\" listing Guantanamo captives who had \\"re- engaged in terrorism\\".

It is the only species in the genus Auriparus and the only representative of the old world family Remizidae to be found in North America.  Description  The verdin is a very small bird. At in length, it rivals the American bushtit as one of the smallest passerines in North America. It is gray overall, and adults have a bright yellow head and rufous shoulder patch (the lesser coverts). Unlike the tits, it has a sharply pointed bill. Juveniles have a light gray body without the rufous shoulder patch and yellow head. The base of the short bill is thick by the head, and draws to a sharp point at the tip.  Taxonomy  Ornithologists currently recognize 6-7 subspecies, all of which differ slightly in plumage tone and size. Two of these nest in the United States. The subspecies (A. acaciarum) is resident from southern California, Nevada, and Utah southward into Mexico; it is associated mostly with the Sonoran Desert. The subspecies (A. ornatus) is found from New Mexico and Oklahoma southward into Mexico and is associated with the Chihuahuan Desert and its scrublands. The remaining 4-5 subspecies are resident to Mexico, and aren't known to migrate into the United States. Habitat Selection Verdins nest in shrubs and thorny thickets with few trees. Their nests are best described as spherical masses of bulky twigs and branches that are then lined with grasses, feathers, and hair. The entrance to the nest is about 1\\" in diameter, and is usually at the bottom of the sphere. They feed in shrub-land and scrubby outcrops where insects are hosted and berries and seeds are plentiful.https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/verdin  Behavior and Ecology  = Reproduction = Verdins nest in the spring and tend to form monogamous pairs, but do not stay together year-round. Otherwise, they are usually solitary. Both males and females build nests for roosting and nesting, and both incubate the eggs and tend to young. Clutch sizes vary from 3-6 eggs, which are light green with irregular dark red-brown spots, concentrated at the bottom end of the egg. No formal courtship display is known for the species, but males sing more frequently during breeding and sometimes also build a \\"display nest\\" of sorts. This display nest may help to display partner suitability, but this correlation has not been confirmed. Once paired, the male and female claim a territory (as large as 20 acres) and will defend the boundary starting early in the breeding season through fledging. After fledging, the young forage with both parents until winter, and then disperse short distances from their hatching site. = Diet and Feeding = Verdins are insectivorous, continuously foraging among the desert trees and scrubs. Verdins occasionally try to obtain sugar water from hummingbird feeders. Feeds on many kinds of tiny insects, both adults and larvae, and also consumes hard and soft mast of many trees and shrubs. = Vocalizations = Little is known about geographic or individual variation in vocalizations. Verdins produce a variety of calls, loud for their size. The typical call note is a repetitive \\"tschep\\" sound repeated in rapid staccato. In Texas, rapid \\"chip-chip-chip\\" calls have been observed, all at the same pitch and at the same speed in each call series.”Oberholser, H. C. (1974). The Bird Life of Texas. University of Texas Press, Austin, TX, USA. The day of hatching, nestlings can produce short peep notes, faint and high-pitched. Fledglings, during their post-juvenile molt, can make soft warbling notes, similar to more complex signatures of adult calls.https://birdsna.org/Species-Account/bna/species/verdin/sounds The verdin gives rapid \\"tschep\\" calls frequently while foraging. Unmated males sound \\"tseet\\" calls repeatedly in early spring, which may function to attract females. \\"Tseet\\" calls are also given by either sex of a mated pair, by solitary foraging birds, and by older nestlings. This may be used as an identifier call to help keep members of the breeding pair together as they move through brush to forage.Dawson, W. L. (1923) The Birds of California: A Complete, Scientific and Popular Account of the 580 Species and Subspecies of Birds Found in the State. Volume 2. South Moulton, San Diego, CA, USA. \\"Tweedle\\" warbling calls may reinforce a breeding pair bond. The verdin also gives a \\"gee-gee-gee-gee\\" alarm call in response to predators or when captured.  Conservation  Although the verdin is listed as a species of least concern [LC] by the IUCN,https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/22711568/118703371 The North American Breeding Bird Survey suggests that verdin populations have declined by 1.9% per year between 1968 and 2015. This decline could mean that the species has experienced a cumulative decrease of 60% in that 47-year period. Threats to verdin populations include habitat loss as a result of urbanization, human structure collisions, and predation.

Background and education Campbell was born at Fermoy, County Cork, the eldest son of John Campbell, 6th Earl of Breadalbane and Holland, by Mary Theresa, daughter of John Edwards, of Dublin. He was educated at St Andrews. After his father succeeded in the earldom of Breadalbane and Holland in 1862, Campbell became known by the courtesy title Lord Glenorchy.thepeerage.com Sir Gavin Campbell, 1st Marquess of Breadalbane until he succeeded his father in the earldom in 1871. Military and political career Breadalbane served as a lieutenant in the 4th Battalion, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders from 1873 to 1874. He was later in the Shropshire Yeomanry, from entering as Sub-Lieutenant in 1877, being promoted lieutenant in 1882, retiring as captain in 1887. From 1897 to 1910 he was Lieutenant- Colonel commanding the Highland Cyclist Battalion, of which he became Honorary Colonel in 1913, and was an Aide-de-Camp to King Edward VII in 1903. As his earldom was a Scottish peerage it did not entitle him to an automatic seat in the House of Lords. However, in 1873 he was created Baron Breadalbane, of Kenmure in the County of Perth, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him a seat in the House of Lords. That same year he was appointed a Lord- in-waiting in the Liberal administration of William Ewart Gladstone. The Liberals fell from power in 1874 but returned to office in 1880, when Breadalbane was sworn of the Privy Council and appointed Treasurer of the Household by Gladstone, a post he held until 1885. The latter year he was created Earl of Ormelie, in the County of Caithness, and Marquess of Breadalbane, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Lord Breadalbane did not serve in Gladstone's brief 1886 administration, but once again held office as Lord Steward of the Household from 1892 to 1895, firstly under Gladstone and from 1894 under the premiership of Lord Rosebery. In 1894 he was appointed a Knight of the Garter. He also served as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1893, 1894 and 1895 and as Lord Lieutenant of Argyllshire from 1914 until 1922 and was the last holder of the office of Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, which he held from 1907 until his death in 1922 in Glasgow. He was a Knight of the Order of the Seraphim of Sweden and a Knight of Justice of the Order of St John of Jerusalem (KStJ), in which capacity he represented King Edward VII during the dedication in June 1902 of the restored chapel at Marienburg Castle, originally the seat of the Teutonic Order. He was awarded the silver medal of the Royal Humane Society, and was also a Brigadier-General of the Royal Company of Archers. Personal life Lord Breadalbane married Lady Alma Imogen Carlotta Leonore Graham, the youngest daughter of James Graham, 4th Duke of Montrose, in 1872. They had no children. He died at the Central Station Hotel in Glasgow in October 1922, aged 71, and was buried at Finlarig. The barony of Breadalbane, earldom of Ormelie and marquessate of Breadalbane became extinct on his death, while he was succeeded in his Scottish titles by his nephew Iain.

Its origins and relation to other Greek dialects are uncertain. A number of scholars have distinguished in Pamphylian dialect important isoglosses with Arcadocypriot which allow them to be studied together. Pamphylia means \\"land of all phyles (tribes)\\". The Achaeans may have settled the region under the leadership of Amphilochus, Calchas, and Mopsus. However, other cities in Pamphylia were established by different Greek tribes: Aspendos was a colony of Argos, Side was a colony of Aeolian Cyme, Sillyon was a colony of an unknown Greek mother city, and Perga was a colony established by a wave of Greeks from northern Anatolia. The isolation of the dialect took place even before the appearance of the Greek article. Pamphylian is the only dialect that does not use articles other than Mycenean Greek and poetic language. Pronunciation and writing Pamphylian digamma Pamphylia had a variant local alphabet, that made use both of the original \\"Pamphylian digamma\\" (Ͷ) and a standard digamma (Ϝ), which was probably borrowed from other Greek alphabets.

He became a Vassal of Rana Sanga of Mewar who help him and Medini rai in various battles and conquering Malwa for them from Sultans. He joined the Rajput confederacy with garrison of 30,000 Rajputs but betrayed Rana Sanga in later hours of battle resulting in Disastrous defeat of united Rajput confederacy at Battle of Khanwa which was fought for supremacy of Northern India between Rajputs and Mughals.  Early life  Silhadi has been variously described as of Gahlot, Sisodia, Tomar or Puar ancestry. His association with the Gahlots and Sisodias (a branch of Gahlots) is probably a result of his marriage into the Sisodia ruling family of Mewar. However, he most probably belonged to the Tomar clan, and came from the Tonwarghar tract located to the north of Gwalior. Silhadi has also been described as a Purbiya Rajput, but the term \\"Purbiya\\" here is not a clan name. He commanded a mercenary force of Rajputs from the eastern region (Purab), which included Awadh, Bihar and the area around Varanasi. These soldiers were called Purbiya (eastern), and therefore, Silhadi was described as a Purbiya too.The Purbiya or eastern rajputs were regarded as Pseudo rajputs by their western counterparts.  Military career  Along with his relative Medini Rai, Silhadi rose to positions of power in the service of Sultan Mahmood Khilji II (ruled 1510-1531) of the Malwa Sultanate. Medini Rai and Silhadi were de facto rulers of the northeastern Malwa region during Mahmood’s reign. Bhilsa, Chanderi and Raisen were their strongholds. At one time they had become so powerful that they seemed to start open rebellion. But in any ways they became semi-independent regions. Both Silhadi and Medini Rai assisted by Rana Sanga of Mewar manage to conquer most of the Malwa.Chanderi was capital of Medini rai's kingdom Malwa now under lordship of Rana Sanga. While Silhadi establish himself as lord of Sarangpur and Raisen region as a vassal ruler of Rana Sanga. He remained a decisive factor in the politics of north and central India during his life and was responsible for sinking the fortunes of many kings by his sudden defections. He gained everlasting notoriety by betraying Rana Sanga in the Battle of Khanwa and causing the Confederacy defeat.He joined the Rajput confederacy with a garrison of 30,000 Rajputs.

Known for most of its length as Kearneysville Pike, the highway extends from WV 115 in Kearneysville north to the Maryland state line at the Potomac River in Shepherdstown, from where the highway continues as Maryland Route 34 (MD 34). The route is one of the main north-south highways of northern Jefferson County and passes through the campus of Shepherd University. WV 480 was originally established in the early 1920s as West Virginia Route 48. The highway was paved in the mid-1920s, which included a different routing through Shepherdstown. WV 48's present routing through the town was established in the late 1930s when the first James Rumsey Bridge was completed; that bridge was replaced with the current bridge in the mid-2000s. WV 48 was renumbered to WV 480 in the mid-1970s after U.S. Route 48 (US 48) was established in West Virginia and Maryland. Route description View north along WV 480 at CR 48/3 in Kearneysville WV 480 begins at a four-legged intersection with WV 115 (Charles Town Road) in the unincorporated village of Kearneysville. The south leg of the intersection is County Route 1 (CR 1), which heads southwest along Leetown Road through its interchange with WV 9. WV 480 heads northeast along two-lane Kearneysville Pike, which passes under CSX's Cumberland Subdivision rail line.

The highway follows Duke Street along the west side of the Shepherdstown Historic District. WV 480 intersects German Street; the intersection forms the eastern terminus of WV 45 and the northern terminus of WV 230. North of downtown, the highway bears back slightly eastward and passes through the campus of Shepherd University, including Ram Stadium. WV 480 reaches its northern terminus at the Maryland state line on the West Virginian bank of the Potomac River. The highway crosses the Potomac River on the James Rumsey Bridge and continues as MD 34 (Shepherdstown Pike) toward Sharpsburg. History In its original 1922 state route system, the West Virginia State Road Commission established WV 48 along the Smithfield and Shepherdstown Road from WV 49 (later WV 9, now WV 115) at Kearneysville through Shepherdstown to the Potomac River. WV 48's routing was the same as modern WV 480 from Kearneysville to Shepherdstown; within the town, the route followed Duke Street, German Street, and Princess Street to the river, which the highway crossed on a bridge downstream from the current bridge. The road commission developed plans to improve WV 48 into an all-weather highway starting in 1922. The Shepherdstown routing was paved as concrete streets in 1924 and 1925, and the road from the town south to Kearneysville was constructed as a bituminous macadam road in 1925. The road commission and the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad started planning for the highway's railroad grade separation at Kearneysville in 1929. The railroad constructed its overpass of the highway and the road commission paved the underpass and its approaches as a concrete road in 1931. The West Virginia State Road Commission surveyed the approach road for a new Potomac River bridge in 1933; the need for the new bridge became acute after the privately owned toll bridge was destroyed in a March 1936 flood. The Maryland State Roads Commission constructed a high-level Wichert continuous truss bridge at the site of the present bridge starting in 1937. The new bridge, which had a concrete road surface, opened July 15, 1939, and was dedicated to James Rumsey, an 18th-century pioneer of the steamboat, who demonstrated his invention on the Potomac River at Shepherdstown in 1787. Also in 1939, the West Virginia State Road Commission extended WV 48 north from German Street along Duke Street and a northern extension of the street to the new bridge as a bituminous concrete road. The following year, the road commission widened the portion of WV 48 between the Kearneysville concrete section and the town of Shepherdstown to and resurfaced the highway with bituminous concrete. The state renumbered WV 48 as WV 480 between 1975 and 1977 after US 48 was assigned to the fMorgantown–Cumberland freeway that later became part of Interstate 68. The West Virginia Department of Transportation started construction to replace the 1939 James Rumsey Bridge with a steel girder span immediately to the north of the old bridge in June 2003. The new James Rumsey Bridge opened July 15, 2005, exactly 66 years after the opening of the previous bridge, which was subsequently torn down.

Having completed his studies he was ordained, and set out for England on 26 December 1602. Although observed by a Government spy, Roberts and his companions succeeded in entering the country in April 1603, where he was appointed vicar of the English monks of the Spanish Congregation on the Mission.\\"The History of Downside Abbey\\" He was arrested and banished on 13 May.Huddleston, Gilbert. \\"St. John Roberts\\".

Soon he managed to return to England; he worked among the plague victims in London. In 1604, while embarking for Spain with four postulants, including William Scott (later known as Maurus Scott) he was again arrested. Not recognized as a priest, he was released and again banished, but he returned to England at once. On 5 November 1605, while Justice Grange was searching the house of Mrs. Percy, first wife of Thomas Percy, who was involved in the Gunpowder Plot, he found Roberts there and arrested him. Though acquitted of any complicity in the plot itself, Roberts was imprisoned in the Gatehouse Prison at Westminster for seven months and then exiled again in July, 1606. Foundation of St. Gregory's monastery, Douai, France This time he was absent for some fourteen months, nearly all of which he spent at Douai where he founded and became the first prior of a house for the English Benedictine monks who had entered various Spanish monasteries. This was the beginning of the monastery of St. Gregory's at Douai. This community of monks was banished from France in 1795 at the French Revolution and travelled to England where they settled at Downside Abbey, Somerset in 1814. Return to England and martyrdom Roberts returned to England in October 1607 and in December he was again arrested and placed in the Gatehouse at Westminster, from which he escaped after some months. After his escape, he lived for about a year in London, but in May 1609 was taken to Newgate Prison. He might have been executed, but Antonie de la Broderie, the French ambassador, interceded on his behalf, and his sentence was reduced to banishment. Roberts again visited Spain and Douai, but returned to England, for a fifth time, within a year. He was captured again on 2 December 1610; the arresting men arrived just as he was finishing saying Mass in a house, having been followed by former priest turned spy John Cecil, who had compiled a dossier on Roberts for James I.\\"Open-air mass for Wales' martyr\\", WalesOnline, 5 June 2010 He was taken to Newgate in his vestments. On 5 December he was tried and found guilty under the Act forbidding priests to minister in England, and on 10 December was hanged, drawn, and quartered, at the age of thirty-three, along with Thomas Somers, at Tyburn, London. It was usual for the prisoner to be disembowelled while still alive, but he was very popular among the poor of London because of the kindness he had shown them during the plague and the large crowd which gathered at his execution would not allow this. They insisted he be hanged to the death so as not to feel the pain. His heart was then held aloft by the executioner who proclaimed: \\"Behold the heart of the traitor!\\" But the angry crowd did not provide the standard response of \\"Long live the King!\\"; there was deathly silence. Veneration The introduction of the cause of beatification was approved by Pope Leo XIII in his Decree of 4 December 1886. On 25 October 1970,\\"Welsh service for martyred Saint John Roberts\\", BBC Wales, 17 July 2010 Roberts was canonised by Pope Paul VI as one of the representative Forty Martyrs of England and Wales. Roman Catholic Bishop Edwin Regan said: \\"Although the name St John Roberts isn't as well known today, he is a major figure in our religious history.\\" He was the first monk to return to Britain following the Protestant Reformation; the hostility between the Catholics and Protestants was at its height at this stage, when a Catholic priest could only expect to live for approximately two years in Britain during that period.\\"Celebrations planned for 'forgotten martyr of Wales'\\", WalesOnline, 26 November 2009 On 17 July 2010, Metropolitan Seraphim of Glastonbury of the British Orthodox Church, accompanied by Deacon Theodore de Quincey, attended an Ecumenical Service at Westminster Cathedral in celebration of the 400th anniversary of the Martyrdom of St. John Roberts. Abba Seraphim noted that as a Londoner he wanted to honour the humanitarian and pastoral ministry of the saint to Londoners; and that all those who are conscious of the problems of exercising Christian ministry in times of persecution would immediately value the saint's determination as well as realising the extraordinary sacrifice he made to fulfil his priestly vocation. Large contingents from Wales were in attendance and the service was bi- lingual. Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams addressed the congregation in both English and Welsh. It was the first time Welsh had been spoken in a ceremony at Westminster Cathedral. The choral piece, \\"Beatus Juan de Mervinia\\" in both Latin and Welsh, was specially commissioned for the service from the Welsh composer Brian Hughes. Roberts is commemorated by a tourist trail from St Madryn's church Trawsfynydd to Cymer Abbey near Dolgellau, and by an exhibition in the Llys Ednowain Heritage Centre in Trawsfynydd. =Relics= The body of Roberts was recovered by a group that included Maurus Scott and taken to St. Gregory's, Douai, but disappeared during the French Revolution. An arm was found in the possession of the Spanish royal family before being returned to the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, where he had served as a novice. Fingers preserved as relics went to Downside Abbey, to Erdington Abbey, to the Sacred Cross Church in Gellilydan near Robert's birthplace, to Tyburn convent and to St Joseph's Convent, Taunton.

For example: \\"Gorilla gorilla gorilla\\" (Savage, 1847) for the western lowland gorilla (genus Gorilla, species western gorilla). Also, \\"Bison bison bison\\" (Linnaeus, 1758) for the plains bison (genus Bison, species American bison). A trinomen is a name with three parts: generic name, specific name and subspecific name. The first two parts alone form the binomen or species name. All three names are typeset in italics, and only the first letter of the generic name is capitalised. No indicator of rank is included: in zoology, subspecies is the only rank below that of species. For example: \\"Buteo jamaicensis borealis is one of the subspecies of the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis).\\" In a taxonomic publication, a name is incomplete without an author citation and publication details. This indicates who published the name, in what publication, and the date of the publication. For example: \\"Phalacrocorax carbo novaehollandiae (Stephens, 1826)\\" denotes a subspecies of the great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) introduced by James Francis Stephens in 1826General zoology, or Systematic natural history London, Printed for G.

For example, one might write: \\"The great cormorant Phalacrocorax carbo has a distinct subspecies in Australasia, the black shag P. c. novaehollandiae\\". While binomial nomenclature came into being and immediately gained widespread acceptance in the mid-18th century, it was not until the early 20th century that the current unified standard of nomenclature was agreed upon. This became the standard mainly because of tireless promotion by Elliott Coues - even though trinomina in the modern usage were pioneered in 1828 by Carl Friedrich Bruch and around 1850 was widely used especially by Hermann Schlegel and John Cassin. As late as the 1930s, the use of trinomina was not fully established in all fields of zoology. Thus, when referring especially European works of the preceding era, the nomenclature used is usually not in accord with contemporary standards.

The blast took place less than 200 yards west of Oklahoma Memorial Stadium, where 84,501 spectators were attending a football game. The bomber, OU student Joel \\"Joe\\" Henry Hinrichs III, was killed in the explosion; no one else was killed. After the incident, speculation began immediately about Hinrichs' motivation and the number of accomplices, if any. An off-duty police officer had noted Hinrichs talking with a local feed store owner about ammonium nitrate and had begun an investigation. There was innuendo regarding the Pakistani heritage of the bomber's roommate. Terrorism-related speculation was heightened after the explosive agent was found to be TATP, an explosive of similar manufacture, though separate makeup, to the compound used in the July 2005 London bombings, the attempted destruction of a by a shoe bomber, and by Hamas in clandestine devices for use by suicide bombers. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and local authorities concluded in 2006 that Hinrichs was alone and had no assistance from other groups. They could not prove or disprove allegations that Hinrichs intended to enter the packed stadium and kill football fans along with himself. Initial events Shortly before halftime of the Saturday evening game between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Kansas State Wildcats, spectators inside the stadium heard an explosion. The explosion was reported as being heard up to five miles away, but people on the east side of the stadium heard only a rumble like low-volume thunder. A few heard nothing. Spectators were not allowed to leave the stadium at half-time, which caused concern among fans who did hear the explosion. No stadium announcements were made until the third and fourth quarters of play, when bus drivers were asked to leave the stadium and meet at the northwest corner of the Asp Avenue Parking Facility. During the last six minutes of the game, an announcement was made over the public address system in the stadium and over local radio for attendees to exit through the south and east gates, and to avoid the area, known as the South Oval, west of the stadium. University officials had decided against giving any further explanations to game attendees because they \\"didn't want to start any kind of panic.\\" > \\"Everyone in my section heard it [the explosion]. We looked to the opposite > side of the field though thinking it was thunder. Me and my family were > gonna go to the university bookstore after the game but the direction we had > to go was blocked by caution tape. We knew something was up and got out of > there ASAP.\\" said a Sooner fan. First reports said the explosive device was made using hydrogen peroxide, though as later noted this was only a component of the actual explosive compound used. The initial accounts also indicated a second bomb was found, but these accounts were false. The area was searched by bomb-sniffing dogs, and no more explosives were found. The remains of the backpack contained a circuit board, wires, and a battery; a small explosive was used to safely detonate it at about 9:00 p.m. Other items at the bomb site included a crescent wrench, a white sock with protruding wires, a screwdriver, unused wooden matches, and a chemistry book. Following the bomb explosion, the entire South Oval was marked as off-limits with crime scene tape. Fans exited the stadium at the conclusion of the game without incident. The South Oval was open the next afternoon except for the immediate area of the explosion, so a broken glass door could be replaced and firefighters could finish spraying down the area with water to wash debris, chemicals and bodily fluids away from the sidewalk and a bus parked there before the preceding day's game. Classes resumed as normal on Monday. Hinrichs In a press conference the next day, OU president David Boren identified Hinrichs, a 21-year-old mechanical engineering student, as responsible for the detonation. Originally from Colorado Springs, Colorado, Hinrichs was a National Merit Scholar who graduated from Wasson High School in May 2002. His father, Joel Hinrichs Jr., described him as a \\"very private individual\\" who had gone through \\"several severe bouts of depression\\". Hinrichs' depression was noted as early as ten years old. His father believes that the \\"underlying cause was his inability to bond with other people. He couldn't make friendships,\\" and also said that Hinrichs began counseling at the university's on-campus health center two years earlier. He did not know if his son was still seeing a counselor, and denied knowledge of the young man's suicidal ideations. Hinrichs was a member of Triangle Fraternity, a social fraternity of engineering, science and architectural majors. Hinrichs' father said that his son had \\"recently moved out of the Triangle fraternity house because \\"he didn't bond, didn't relate well to the other fraternity members.\\" In the chapter meeting following the bombing the members of his fraternity were asked to direct all questions and comments to one member of their fraternity and not to discuss anything with the media, this was advised in hopes of limiting rumors and other theories. Investigation According to local media, Hinrichs inquired about purchasing a large quantity of ammonium nitrate, the chief ingredient in the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, at a local feed store two days before the explosion. An off-duty Norman police officer was in the store and overheard the conversation between the feed store owner and Hinrichs. The officer followed Hinrichs out of the store, checked Hinrichs' license plate, and began an investigation when his shift started. That investigation was still in progress when the bomb went off. A computer check, however, showed no outstanding arrest warrants for Hinrichs and no criminal record. A robot operated remotely prepares to enter Hinrichs' apartment. After more investigation, the explosive was found not to be hydrogen peroxide, as first indicated. Instead, Hinrichs detonated triacetone triperoxide (TATP), an extremely unstable compound which can be made by mixing common household products like acetone, hydrogen peroxide and an acid catalyst. According to a Norman bomb squad agent, Hinrichs had between two and three pounds of TATP in a bag in his lap. When investigators entered Hinrichs' apartment the morning after the explosion, they found more TATP and the necessary chemicals to make more of the substance. Since TATP becomes more unstable as time passes, the Norman Police and the FBI evacuated Hinrichs' building and the four apartment buildings that surrounded it as a precaution. A suicide note was displayed on Hinrichs' open laptop monitor. While detectives were unable to completely retrace Hinrichs' steps that day, they did find that Hinrichs typed \\"None of you are worth living with. You can all kiss my ass\\" at about 6:15 pm that evening, approximately 75 minutes before he died. The message was on the computer screen when agents entered Hinrichs' apartment. Hinrichs told friends and fraternity brothers that he liked explosives, and frequently experimented with building and detonating bombs made in or of plastic soda bottles. Hinrichs kept detailed records of many experiments he performed, done mostly at Red Rock Canyon in Caddo County, in the weeks prior to his death. Along with the chemicals and the suicide note, they found used artillery shells, spent bullets, belts made of used brass shell casings, and military ammunition boxes. Other items taken in the search included a thermometer, a slow cooker, rolls of tape, mixing bowls, and plastic containers. Hinrichs' roommate met Hinrichs when he placed an advertisement online for a roommate, and Hinrichs responded. The two did not socialize, and although Hinrichs showed the remains of detonated explosive devices to at least one fraternity brother, the roommate was unaware of Hinrichs' interest in explosives. There was already speculation among some bloggers and pundits that Hinrichs was a Muslim, but the news of a Pakistani roommate ignited louder rumors that Hinrichs was an Islamic convert who attended the same Norman mosque Zacarias Moussaoui previously attended. Ashraf Hussein, the president of OU's Muslim Student Association, said he had never seen Hinrichs at a mosque and that he did not believe Hinrichs was Muslim. As many as eight people, Hakim Mansouri (OU student), Djamal Rabli (OU student) and others including OU Arabic language instructor Hossam Barakat, were detained by the Norman Police Department in the early morning hours of October 2 for questioning. They were again questioned the next day, after which they were cleared of suspicion. Rumors also circulated that Hinrichs intended to detonate his homemade bomb inside the stadium; these included allegations that he tried to enter the stadium that evening but was denied entry after he refused to be searched. Hinrichs was not a student football season ticket holder; there was no evidence that Hinrichs tried to enter the stadium, and Hinrichs apparently neither bought nor tried to buy a game ticket. Agents scoured hundreds of hours of security camera tapes and found no images of Hinrichs, but, since not all entrances had cameras, they conceded they may never know if Hinrichs wanted to enter or tried to enter the stadium that night. Boren noted that Hinrichs waited until the game was underway and pre- game fans and students had cleared the South Oval; there would have been injuries or deaths to bystanders had Hinrichs detonated his device in the same area prior to or after the game. Before the October 22, 2005 game, with the Baylor Bears, season ticket holders received a letter from Boren which outlined new stadium security procedures, including restrictions on bags and purses brought into the stadium, more security cameras, and hand searches of belongings. Readmission to the stadium after exiting during the game or at half-time was prohibited except for medical emergencies. Conclusion and aftermath In July 2006, the FBI formally declared that there was no evidence Hinrichs was a terrorist. Over 200 witnesses were interviewed about the event, and no indications were found that Hinrichs was an extremist, had extremist views, or was working with anyone else to make and explode the bomb. Agents with the Norman police and bomb squad said that Hinrichs likely \\"got cocky\\" with his explosives – a witness saw Hinrichs rummaging around his backpack shortly before it detonated. In November 2006, Thomas Carlisle Hinrichs, Joel Hinrichs' brother, was arrested after he allegedly attacked his father and threatened to murder an FBI agent. He was found guilty of the crime in June and was sentenced to 37 months imprisonment in October 2007. In August 2007, the university held an emergency drill to better prepare for future events during home football games. A gas line rupture inside Oklahoma Memorial Stadium was simulated. More than 500 students participated, along with responders from the Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the Norman Police Department and Fire Department, the University of Oklahoma Police Department, and the Oklahoma Highway Patrol. It was the first university stadium emergency drill of its kind in the United States.

Administrative divisions Communes of Kouffo The department of Kouffo was created in 1999 when it was split off from Mono Department. Its capital is Aplahoué. Kouffo is subdivided into six communes, each centered at one of the principal towns: Aplahoué, Djakotomey, Klouékanmè, Lalo, Toviklin and Dogbo-Tota. Benin originally had six administrative regions (départements), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (directions départementales) of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the sous-prefectures, the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments. Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.

Besides agitating for the economic agenda one would expect of a labour union the STC has an agenda pushing for greater cultural autonomy from France. Strikes against SNCM In late February 2004, the STC declared a campaign on the state owned maritime transport firm National Corsican Mediterranean Company (Société Nationale Corse Méditerranée, SNCM). STC demanded that the company, which provides a great deal of the sea borne transport to and from the island, hire more Corsicans as well as raise their wages. An initial compromise was reached at the time, but a court struck it down on grounds of discrimination. STC renewed their effort September 3 of that year, much to the chagrin of the financially destitute company. The strike was brought to a close September 19 with SCNM agreeing to, \\"Rebalance the numbers of new crew members recruited in Corsica and in other regions, using equal competence criteria and within the normal parameters of the company’s recruitment\\" in addition to 'island resident' bonuses for Corsican employees. It is likely SCNM was motivated to compromise by competition from Corsica Ferries, a Swiss company that, nevertheless, is headquartered in Bastia and has \\"A management structure young Corsicans\\". Although employing only 290 islanders, as opposed to SCNM's 816, Corsica Ferries had a bill of 50 million euros and was a likely contributor to SCNM's 11% decline in profits from Corsican services between 1996 and 2003 (72% to 61%). The agreement served to highlight the tensions between STC and the mainland General Confederation of Labour (Confédération générale du travail, CGT). SNCM ships were blockaded for four days as a protest against what mainland unions feel is a political agenda, namely Corsican nationalism that threatens French principles of non-discrimination. The French government, however, ruled the compromise, \\"Does not infringe the principle of non-discrimination in employment\\" and the Corsican CGT branch joined local business and political leaders in what they saw as an important step against the disparity in Corsican employees in a business receiving substantial subsidies from the Corsican regional authority. By 2005 SCNM was in even worse financial condition. When plans for a Butler Capital Partners of the firm were announced sometimes violent STC protests erupted in Bastia (there were protests in Marseille as well, but these were not affiliated with STC but the CGT). Commandos were brought in to recapture the Pasquale Paoli, an SCNM ship hijacked in Marseille by 30 STC members, when it attempted to enter the Bastia port. An investigation into \\"hijacking a ship\\" was launched, if found guilty the ring leaders may be faced with 30 years in prison. More demonstrators attempted to seal the port and stop two ships from leaving. They clashed violently with riot police for four hours injuring a photographer before the ships were free to leave. Contrary to the earlier disagreement with SCNM, the STC and the CGT were united in their condemnation of the privatization plans; \\"The government bears the entire responsibility for the conflict... The workers are raising their heads and have decided to fight against the consequences of intensive liberalism\\" read the joint statement released by France's main trade unions who were joined by the French Socialist Party in their condemnation of the military response to the strikes.

The Church of England parish has been the Parish of St Anne with St Thomas and St Peter since 1945. The church and parish are part of the Deanery of Westminster (St Margaret) within the Diocese of London in the Church of England. Parts of its churchyard around the tower and west end are now the public park of St Anne's Gardens, accessed from the Shaftesbury Avenue end of Wardour Street, whilst the church itself is accessed via a gate at the Shaftesbury Avenue end of Dean Street, as it does not front onto the street. History =1677–1799= The parish was dedicated to Saint Anne because Compton had been tutor to Princess Anne before she became Queen. Construction commenced in 1677 on a plot in what was then the countryside of Soho Fields, with William Talman and/or Christopher Wren as architect(s). The church was designed as an long and wide basilican church, with a high west end tower. In 1699 a tuition-free parish school was founded for boys and in 1704 it started to admit girls. The church received an organ in 1699 from the Dowager-Queen's Chapel in St James's PalaceSt. Anne's Church  British History Online and from 1700 the church's first organist was William Croft (composer of the \\"St Anne\\" tune to O God, Our Help in Ages Past). The church's tower was only completed in 1718, with the addition of a timber spire by local carpenter John Meard. Edmund Andros was buried in the church's churchyard in 1714 as was the actress Hester Davenport in 1717, while in 1724/5 the church saw the marriage of Edward Harley, 3rd Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer, and in 1743 Prince William Henry (younger brother of George III) was baptised here. =1800–1939= The tower, however, became unstable by 1800 and, after 41 meetings of a \\"Tower Rebuilding Committee\\" came no closer to solving the problem, the architect Samuel Pepys Cockerell was commissioned to design a replacement. The original tower was demolished (though the 1 ton clock bell, cast in 1691 and still in use, was retained) and the new tower's brickwork was completed by 1801, its bell chamber's Portland stonework by March 1803, and its copper cupola by May 1803. The new tower's ground floor room became the parish's vestry room, and later (in the 20th century) a robing room for the clergy, and in the deep brick chamber beneath it are interred the ashes of the novelist Dorothy L Sayers, who was a longtime Churchwarden of the parish and member of the St Anne's Society. 19th century burials in St Anne's churchyard included David Williams (1816) and William Hazlitt (1830). Also placed in the crypt was the body of Thomas Pitt, 2nd Baron Camelford in 1804. The church's choir and musical, famous since its consecration, continued with Sir Joseph Barnby (later Precentor of Eton), who served as its organist from 1871 to 1888 and introduced the first UK performance of Bach's \\"St John Passion\\", and with royal command performances (in 1886 for Queen Victoria at Windsor, singing Louis Spohr's \\"Last Judgement\\"; and later, at Buckingham Palace, for Queen Alexandra). The first religious service with music to be broadcast on the radio came from St Anne's in the 1920s. =1939–present= The whole church was left burned out on the night of 24 September 1940 during the Blitz, apart from the tower, which was left derelict. St Thomas's Regent Street (now demolished) and the adjoining St Anne's House in the \\"Upper Room\\" (now known as the \\"Allen Room\\") were used for worship from then on. Though Jacques Groag in 1945 proposed keeping the ruins as a war memorial, it was by 1949 assumed that the church would not be rebuilt, so in 1953 the remains of the east wall (the only significant parts left standing) were demolished, the site deconsecrated and prepared for sale and the parish amalgamated with those of the churches of St Thomas's Regent Street and St Peter's Great Windmill Street (creating the Parish of St Anne with St Thomas and St Peter, centred on St Thomas's). The tower was used as a chapel for a time in the 1950s, partly restored in 1979 by the Soho Society, and fully restored in the 1990–91 rebuilding of the whole church – the tower is now a Grade II listed building. That reconstruction had been the result of London County Council's policy to keep Soho as a residential area, was facilitated by a new private act of parliament in 1965 allowing the site to be cleared and began in earnest with a foundation stone laid by Princess Anne on 12 March 1990. The new complex was completed in time for an opening and rededication on St Anne's Day, 26 July 1991. The new church and its associated complex is not per se a reconstruction of the old and can be varied from a large to a small space. It is set within a community centre and is a community focus such as for grief surrounding the 1999 Admiral Duncan pub bombing. Despite the lack of a building at that time, from 1941 to 1958 the St Anne Society under Father Patrick McLaughlin encouraged links between the literary world and the Church of England, with members such as Fr Gilbert Shaw, J. C. Winnington-Ingram, Charles Williams, Agatha Christie, T. S. Eliot, Fr Max Petitpierre, Dom Gregory Dix, Arnold Bennett, C. S. Lewis and the churchwarden Rose Macaulay. Continuing the work of the church's 18th and 19th century philanthropic rectors, in the 20th and 21st centuries the \\"Vestry of St Anne's\\" ( now called the Parochial Church Council) has been active in social work with London's poor and homeless (Kenneth Leech founded the charity Centrepoint in St. Anne's House's basement in December 1969 whilst he was assistant priest at St Anne's and it remains based at the church). The Church is currently thriving as a church community and as venue for many local community and charitable events and meetings; it also houses the Soho Society, the archives of MoSoho (the Museum of Soho) and ( from June 2016) anti homophobic bullying charity Diversity Role Models. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the rebuilding of the church a redesigned entrance on Dean Street was unrevealed on 8 December 2016. The new entrance was designed by students Lina Viluma and Sherief al Rifa’i, who were chosen as a result of a competition to redesign the entrance of St Anne's The judges of the President's Award for alterations to a church building in the 2017 Church Architecture Awards said that \\"The design has a strong idea but has been carefully refined employing subtle geometries in the ceiling and joinery.

This space with its universal fibration may be constructed as either # the Grassmannian of n-planes in an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space; or, # the direct limit, with the induced topology, of Grassmannians of n planes. Both constructions are detailed here. Construction as an infinite Grassmannian The total space EU(n) of the universal bundle is given by :EU(n)=left {e_1,ldots,e_n  :  (e_i,e_j)=delta_{ij}, e_iin H right }. Here, H denotes an infinite- dimensional complex Hilbert space, the ei are vectors in H, and delta_{ij} is the Kronecker delta. The symbol (cdot,cdot) is the inner product on H. Thus, we have that EU(n) is the space of orthonormal n-frames in H. The group action of U(n) on this space is the natural one. The base space is then :BU(n)=EU(n)/U(n) and is the set of Grassmannian n-dimensional subspaces (or n-planes) in H. That is, :BU(n) = { V subset H  :  dim V = n } so that V is an n-dimensional vector space. = Case of line bundles = For n = 1, one has EU(1) = S∞, which is known to be a contractible space. The base space is then BU(1) = CP∞, the infinite-dimensional complex projective space. Thus, the set of isomorphism classes of circle bundles over a manifold M are in one- to-one correspondence with the homotopy classes of maps from M to CP∞. One also has the relation that :BU(1)= PU(H), that is, BU(1) is the infinite- dimensional projective unitary group. See that article for additional discussion and properties. For a torus T, which is abstractly isomorphic to U(1) × ... × U(1), but need not have a chosen identification, one writes BT. The topological K-theory K0(BT) is given by numerical polynomials; more details below. Construction as an inductive limit Let Fn(Ck) be the space of orthonormal families of n vectors in Ck and let Gn(Ck) be the Grassmannian of n-dimensional subvector spaces of Ck. The total space of the universal bundle can be taken to be the direct limit of the Fn(Ck) as k → ∞, while the base space is the direct limit of the Gn(Ck) as k → ∞. =Validity of the construction= In this section, we will define the topology on EU(n) and prove that EU(n) is indeed contractible. The group U(n) acts freely on Fn(Ck) and the quotient is the Grassmannian Gn(Ck). The map : begin{align} F_n(mathbf{C}^k) & longrightarrow mathbf{S}^{2k-1}  (e_1,ldots,e_n) & longmapsto e_n end{align} is a fibre bundle of fibre Fn−1(Ck−1). Thus because pi_p(mathbf{S}^{2k-1}) is trivial and because of the long exact sequence of the fibration, we have : pi_p(F_n(mathbf{C}^k))=pi_p(F_{n-1}(mathbf{C}^{k-1})) whenever pleq 2k-2. By taking k big enough, precisely for k>tfrac{1}{2}p+n-1, we can repeat the process and get : pi_p(F_n(mathbf{C}^k)) = pi_p(F_{n-1}(mathbf{C}^{k-1})) = cdots = pi_p(F_1(mathbf{C}^{k+1-n})) = pi_p(mathbf{S}^{k-n}). This last group is trivial for k > n + p. Let : EU(n)={lim_{to}};_{ktoinfty}F_n(mathbf{C}^k) be the direct limit of all the Fn(Ck) (with the induced topology). Let : G_n(mathbf{C}^infty)={lim_to};_{ktoinfty}G_n(mathbf{C}^k) be the direct limit of all the Gn(Ck) (with the induced topology). > Lemma: The group pi_p(EU(n)) is trivial for all p ≥ 1. Proof: Let γ : Sp → EU(n), since Sp is compact, there exists k such that γ(Sp) is included in Fn(Ck). By taking k big enough, we see that γ is homotopic, with respect to the base point, to the constant map.Box In addition, U(n) acts freely on EU(n). The spaces Fn(Ck) and Gn(Ck) are CW-complexes. One can find a decomposition of these spaces into CW-complexes such that the decomposition of Fn(Ck), resp. Gn(Ck), is induced by restriction of the one for Fn(Ck+1), resp. Gn(Ck+1). Thus EU(n) (and also Gn(C∞)) is a CW-complex. By Whitehead Theorem and the above Lemma, EU(n) is contractible.  Cohomology of BU(n) > Proposition: The cohomology of the classifying space H*(BU(n)) is a ring of > polynomials in n variables c1, ..., cn where cp is of degree 2p. Proof: Let us first consider the case n = 1. In this case, U(1) is the circle S1 and the universal bundle is S∞ → CP∞. It is well knownR. Bott, L. W. Tu-- Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology, Graduate Texts in Mathematics 82, Springer that the cohomology of CPk is isomorphic to mathbf{R}lbrack c_1rbrack/c_1^{k+1}, where c1 is the Euler class of the U(1)-bundle S2k+1 → CPk, and that the injections CPk → CPk+1, for k ∈ N*, are compatible with these presentations of the cohomology of the projective spaces. This proves the Proposition for n = 1. There are homotopy fiber sequences : mathbb{S}^{2n-1} to B U(n-1) to B U(n) Concretely, a point of the total space BU(n-1) is given by a point of the base space BU(n) classifying a complex vector space V, together with a unit vector u in V; together they classify u^perp < V while the splitting V = (mathbb{C} u) oplus u^perp , trivialized by u, realizes the map B U(n-1) to B U(n) representing direct sum with mathbb{C}. Applying the Gysin sequence, one has a long exact sequence : H^p ( BU(n) ) overset{smile d_{2n} eta}{longrightarrow} H^{p+2n} ( BU(n) ) overset{j^*}{longrightarrow} H^{p+2n} (BU(n-1)) overset{partial}{longrightarrow} H^{p+1}(BU(n)) longrightarrow cdots where eta is the fundamental class of the fiber mathbb{S}^{2n-1}. By properties of the Gysin Sequence, j^* is a multiplicative homomorphism; by induction, H^*BU(n-1) is generated by elements with p < -1 , where partial must be zero, and hence where j^* must be surjective. It follows that j^* must always be surjective: by the universal property of polynomial rings, a choice of preimage for each generator induces a multiplicative splitting. Hence, by exactness, smile d_{2n}eta must always be injective. We therefore have short exact sequences split by a ring homomorphism : 0 to H^p ( BU(n) ) overset{smile d_{2n} eta}{longrightarrow} H^{p+2n} ( BU(n) ) overset{j^*}{longrightarrow} H^{p+2n} (BU(n-1)) to 0 Thus we conclude H^*(BU(n)) = H^*(BU(n-1))[c_{2n}] where c_{2n} = d_{2n} eta. This completes the induction. K-theory of BU(n) Consider topological complex K-theory as the cohomology theory represented by the spectrum KU. In this case, KU^*(BU(n))cong mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]c_1,...,c_n,Adams 1974, p. 49 and KU_*(BU(n)) is the free mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}] module on beta_0 and beta_{i_1}ldotsbeta_{i_r} for ngeq i_j > 0 and rleq n.Adams 1974, p. 47 In this description, the product structure on KU_*(BU(n)) comes from the H-space structure of BU given by Whitney sum of vector bundles. This product is called the Pontryagin product. The topological K-theory is known explicitly in terms of numerical symmetric polynomials. The K-theory reduces to computing K0, since K-theory is 2-periodic by the Bott periodicity theorem, and BU(n) is a limit of complex manifolds, so it has a CW-structure with only cells in even dimensions, so odd K-theory vanishes. Thus K_*(X) = pi_*(K) otimes K_0(X), where pi_*(K)=mathbf{Z}[t,t^{-1}], where t is the Bott generator. K0(BU(1)) is the ring of numerical polynomials in w, regarded as a subring of H∗(BU(1); Q) = Q[w], where w is element dual to tautological bundle. For the n-torus, K0(BTn) is numerical polynomials in n variables. The map K0(BTn) → K0(BU(n)) is onto, via a splitting principle, as Tn is the maximal torus of U(n). The map is the symmetrization map :f(w_1,dots,w_n) mapsto frac{1}{n!} sum_{sigma in S_n} f(x_{sigma(1)}, dots, x_{sigma(n)}) and the image can be identified as the symmetric polynomials satisfying the integrality condition that : {n choose n_1, n_2, ldots, n_r}f(k_1,dots,k_n) in mathbf{Z} where : {n choose k_1, k_2, ldots, k_m} = frac{n!}{k_1!, k_2! cdots k_m!} is the multinomial coefficient and k_1,dots,k_n contains r distinct integers, repeated n_1,dots,n_r times, respectively.

He was the youngest of five sons of Earl Sigurd Hlodvirsson and the only one resulting from Sigurd's marriage to a daughter of Malcolm II of Scotland. He ruled alone as earl for about a third of the time that he held the title and jointly with one or more of his brothers or with his nephew Rögnvald Brusason for the remainder. Thorfinn married Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, daughter of Finn Arnesson, Jarl of Halland. The Heimskringla of Icelandic historian Snorri Sturluson, and the anonymous compiler of the Orkneyinga Saga wrote that Thorfinn was the most powerful of all the earls of Orkney and that he ruled substantial territories beyond the Northern Isles. A sizeable part of the latter saga's account concerns his wars with a \\"King of Scots\\" named Karl Hundason whose identity is uncertain. In his later years he went on a pilgrimage to Rome and he was instrumental in making Orkney and Shetland part of mainstream Christendom. On his death in the latter half of the 11th century he was followed as earl by his sons Paul and Erlend. There are numerous problems associated with the chronology of Thorfinn's life and in identifying his relationships to the southern polities of the Kingdom of Alba (the precursor to modern Scotland) and the Kingdom of Moray. His diplomacy with the Norwegian court has also been interpreted in various ways. His life has been the subject of various works of historical fiction. Sources The sources for Thorfinn's life are almost exclusively Norse sagas, which were written down long after the time of the events in his life they record. The main sources are St Olaf's saga and the more detailed Orkneyinga Saga, which were first compiled in Iceland in the early 13th century. Much of the information the latter contains is \\"hard to corroborate\\"Woolf (2007) p. 242 although it is a \\"generally credible\\" narrative in this context. Background Thorfinn was the youngest of the five known sons of Earl Sigurd Hlodvirsson, but the only son of Sigurd's marriage to an unknown daughter of King Malcolm II (Máel Coluim mac Cináeda). His elder half-brothers Einar, Brusi and Sumarlidi survived to adulthood, while another brother called Hundi died young in Norway, a hostage at the court of King Olaf Trygvasson.Orkneyinga Saga c. 12; St. Olaf's Saga c. 96. Other versions are given in Anderson (1990) pp. 507–511. The locations of Orkney, Shetland, the Hebrides, Mann and various mainland territories in the late 11th century Earl Sigurd was killed at the Battle of Clontarf on 23 April 1014. Before setting out for Ireland, he had sent Thorfinn, then aged five, to be fostered by his maternal grandfather, the King of Scots. When the news of Sigurd's death came, Thorfinn's older half- brothers divided Orkney and Shetland between them. King Máel Coluim set Thorfinn up as ruler of Caithness and Sutherland with Scots advisors to rule for him.Orkneyinga Saga cc. 12–13 Earl Sigurd had also been a ruler of the SuðreyarGregory (1881) p. 5 but these holdings appear to have escaped the control of the earls of Orkney at the time of his death or shortly thereafter. The Orkneyinga Saga provides this description of Thorfinn: > He was unusually tall and strong, an ugly-looking man with a black head of > hair, sharp features, a big nose and bushy eyebrows, a forceful man, greedy > for fame and fortune. He did well in battle, for he was both a good > tactician and full of courage.Orkneyinga Saga c. 20 p. 50; St. Olaf's Saga > c. 96; Anderson (1990) pp. 542–543 Joint rule = With Einar and Brusi= Joint earldoms were a frequent feature of the Norse earldom of Orkney, although the Orkneyinga saga is less than explicit about how these shares were divided up geographically. Sumarlidi died in his bed not long after his father, most likely no later than 1018Muir (2005) pp. 44-45 and Einar took his share, ruling two-thirds of the earldom with the remaining third held by Brusi. Einar soon became unpopular, demanding heavy taxes and frequent military service from the farmers, and gaining little booty on his raids. He was, the saga says, \\"a great bully\\", whereas Brusi was \\"well liked by everyone\\".Orkneyinga Saga, c. 13; St Olaf's Saga, c. 97. The Brough of Deerness - a Viking age ecclesiastical ruin here is associated with Thorkel Fosterer.Thomson (2008) pp. 86-87 The farmers of the isles opposition to Einar's rule were led by Thorkel Amundason and, in danger of his life, he fled to Thorfinn's court in Caithness. He became his foster-father, hence his by-name, \\"Thorkel Fosterer\\".Orkneyinga Saga c. 12-13 p. 38 After Sumarlidi's death the disposition of his third share in Orkney and Shetland became a matter of dispute when Thorfinn claimed it as his. While Brusi was willing to grant it to him, Einar, who was \\"ruthless and grasping, a hard and successful fighting man\\" and somewhat like Thorfinn in temperamentMuir (2005) pp. 44-46 was not. Einar and Thorfinn each began raising an army to settle matters by force, but Earl Brusi made peace between them by raising his own men to come between them and then persuading Einar to give Thorfinn what he asked for.Orkneyinga Saga cc. 14–15. It was also agreed that on the death of either Brusi or Einar, the surviving brother would inherit the other's share. Thorfinn appointed Thorkel Fosterer as his tax-gatherer in the islands, but Einar had not forgotten their earlier dispute and Thorkel again left the islands in fear of his life, returning to Thorfinn's base in Caithness (probably at Duncansby). Thorkel then travelled to Norway with Thorfinn's support, to meet with King Olaf Haraldsson. He was well received there, for Olaf bore his own grudge against Einar for the killing of his comrade Eyvind Aurochs-Horn some years earlier. Olaf invited Thorfinn to Norway, and he too was welcomed to Olaf's court. Thorfinn and Thorkel returned to Orkney to find Einar raising an army against them. Brusi again made peace between them, and it was agreed that Einar and Thorkel would entertain one another to a feast. In October 1020Anderson (1990) p. 554 Einar attended Thorkel's hall at Hlaupandanes in Deerness in a sour mood. On the last day of the feast Thorkel was supposed to travel with Einar for the reciprocal event, however his spies reported to him that ambushes had been prepared against him along his route. Thorkel therefore delayed his departure, leaving Einar to wait for his arrival by the fire in his great hall. Thorkel arrived by stealth, walked into the hall with one of his men and they killed Einar. Thorkel then escaped to Norway.Thompson (2008) p. 74Muir (2005) p. 46Orkneyinga Saga c. 16St Olaf's Saga, cc. 98-99. = With Brusi= A coin from the reign of Olaf Haraldsson of Norway dated 1023–28. The death of Einar did not end the dispute over Sumarlidi's third of the islands. Brusi considered that it belonged to him, as he and Einar had agreed when Thorfinn received a third of the islands. Thorfinn thought that the islands should be divided equally. However, Thorfinn could count on the assistance of his grandfather, King Malcolm, while Brusi had only the forces he could raise from his share of the islands, making any conflict a very unequal one. Brusi went to Norway to have King Olaf judge the dispute, and Thorfinn joined him there. Brusi surrendered the earldom to Olaf, who granted a third to each brother, and kept a third for himself. Thorfinn attempted to use his relationship with the King of Scots as a means to avoid acknowledging Olaf as his overlord in Orkney and Shetland, but Olaf threatened to appoint another to rule Thorfinn's share. Following Thorkel Fosterer's advice, Thorfinn agreed to Olaf's settlement. After Thorfinn left Norway, Olaf gave Brusi the disputed third to rule on his behalf, but kept Brusi's son Rognvald in Norway as a hostage.Orkneyinga Saga, cc. 17–19; St. Olaf's Saga, cc. 100–102. These events have been dated to 1021. This arrangement lasted while Olaf was king but in 1030 he was overthrown by the Danish king Cnut the Great at the Battle of Stiklestad.Muir (2005) p. 48 After this Orkney was raided by Norwegians and Danes and Brusi agreed to give the King's third to Thorfinn in return for his seeing to the defence of the islands. This agreement lasted until Brusi's death, some time between 1030 and 1035. After that, Thorfinn was sole ruler of the Orkney earldomOrkneyinga Saga, c. 19 pp. 49-50; St. Olaf's Saga, c. 102 as a vassal of the King of Norway and as Earl of Caithness responsible to the King of Scots. War with Karl Hundason The Orkneyinga Saga says that a dispute between Thorfinn and Karl Hundason began when the latter became \\"King of Scots\\" and claimed Caithness, his forces successfully moving north and basing themselves in Thurso.Crawford (1987) p. 72 In the war which followed, Thorfinn defeated Karl in a sea-battle off Deerness at the east end of the Orkney Mainland. Then Karl's nephew Mutatan or Muddan, appointed to rule Caithness for him, was killed in Caithness by Thorkel Fosterer. Finally, a great battle at \\"Torfness\\" (probably Tarbat Ness on the south side of the Dornoch FirthPálsson and Edwards (1981) p. 54) ended with Karl either being killed or forced to flee. Thorfinn, the saga says, then marched south through Scotland as far as Fife, burning and plundering as he passed.Orkneyinga Saga c. 20 Joint rule with Rognvald At some point around 1034 Thorfinn is said to have conquered the Hebrides and he is likely to have been a de facto ruler of the Kingdom of the Isles, in whole or in part until his death (although the assumption of Echmarcach mac Ragnaill as \\"King of Mann\\" from 1052–1061 may have encroached on his territories).Woolf (2007) p. 245Duffy (1992) p. 100 Kalf Arnesson with the young Magnus at the Battle of Stiklestad: 19th century illustration by Halfdan Egedius Thorfinn ruled alone in Orkney until the return of his nephew Rognvald Brusason in about 1037. Rognvald had received the favour of King Magnus \\"the Good\\" Olafsson, who granted him Brusi's share of the islands and the third which Olaf Haraldsson had claimed after Einar's death. Thorfinn agreed to this division, but presented the transfer of the third claimed by the Norwegian king as a gift to Rognvald in return for aid in Thorfinn's wars in the Hebrides and the Irish Sea.Orkneyinga Saga, c. 22 King Sigtrygg Silkbeard had died c. 1036, and the kingship in Dublin had come to Echmarcach mac Ragnaill, who was challenged by Imar mac Arailt and driven out in 1038. This instability in Dublin can only have helped Thorfinn and Rognvald, who raided far and wide and established their rule over various lands around the Irish Sea. They are said to have won a major victory beside Vatzfjorðr, perhaps Loch Vatten on the west coast of Skye,Anderson (1990) p. 585, note 2Orkneyinga Saga c. 22 and to have raided in England, with mixed success.Orkneyinga Saga c. 23 In time, Thorfinn and Rognvald fell out. The vivid account of the war between Thorfinn and Rognvald in the Orkneyinga Saga which survives may well be only a part of a much longer saga now lost.Anderson (1990) p. 585, note 2. Their enmity arose with the arrival of Kalf Arnesson and his followers in Orkney. Kalf was the uncle of Thorfinn's wife Ingibiorg and he had been instrumental in the death of King Olaf. He later left Norway to escape King Magnus Olafsson.Orkneyinga Saga c. 25 Rognvald, with Kalf's brothers, had shared Magnus's exile in Kievan Rus under the protection of Prince Yaroslav the Wise and the saga says that when Kalf and Einar Belly-Shaker came to Ladoga to invite Magnus back to Norway, Rognvald had been on the brink of attacking Kalf until Einar explained the reason for their visit and that Kalf had repented for his part in overthrowing Olaf.Orkneyinga Saga c. 21. Papa Stronsay, the supposed location of Rognvald Brusason's death at the hands of Thorkel Fosterer Thorfinn found hosting Kalf and his men a burden, and in time asked Rognvald to return the third of the earldom \\"which had once belonged to Einar Wry-Mouth\\". Rognvald refused, saying that it was for King Magnus to settle matters. Thorfinn began raising an army, and Rognvald's islanders were unwilling to fight Thorfinn, so Rognvald sailed to Norway where King Magnus supplied him with ships and men. He returned to the islands, facing Thorfinn and Kalf Arnesson in a sea battle which Arnór the skald commemorated in verse. The battle went Rognvald's way to begin with, but in the end he was defeated and forced again to seek refuge with King Magnus.Orkneyinga Saga c. 26 King Magnus offered to fit out another expedition for Rognvald, but he decided to take just one ship and a picked crew. He sailed to Shetland in winter and, learning that Thorfinn was staying on a farm on the Orkney Mainland with only a few men, he set out at once to attack him. Rognvald's men surprised Thorfinn, and set the farm ablaze. The saga says that Thorfinn had to break down a wall and escape, carrying his wife in his arms, flying south to Caithness for safety. Rognvald ruled in Kirkwall over the winter, believing Thorfinn dead, but in the spring, while staying on Papa Stronsay, Thorfinn and his men turned the tables, taking Rognvald by surprise, just as he had surprised Thorfinn. Rognvald escaped the house Thorfinn had surrounded, but was tracked down, given away by the barking of his lap dog, and killed by Thorkel Fosterer.Orkneyinga Saga, c. 25–29 The Orkneyinga Saga offers this assessment of Rognvald: \\"Everyone agrees that of all the Earls of Orkney he was the most popular and gifted, and his death was mourned by many\\".Orkneyinga Saga, c. 29. Pilgrimage St. Magnus Church, Birsay. The site is a possible location for Thorfinn's \\"Christ Kirk\\". Even with Rognvald dead, Thorfinn was not entirely secure. The saga recounts an attempt to make peace with Magnus Olafsson, who had sworn vengeance for the death of his men in Thorfinn's attack on Rognvald. Magnus was at war with the Danish king Sweyn Estridsson, and died before he could take any action. Magnus's uncle and successor, Harald Hardrada, was more friendly towards Thorfinn, and made peace, accepting Thorfinn's gifts.Orkneyinga Saga cc. 30–31 Thorfinn had two sons, both by his wife Ingibiorg, and unlike a number of his predecessors he appears to have married only once. Furthermore, unlike his brothers, Thorfinn had been raised as a Christian. Among the signs of the changes in Orkney society was Thorfinn's pilgrimage to Rome, which took place after his meeting with King Harald, probably beginning in 1048. The saga says that he travelled through Saxony, meeting with Emperor Henry III on the journey. It is thought that he also met with Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen.Crawford (1987) pp. 80–81 The Orkneyinga saga suggests that, as a result of Thorfinn's request, the first Bishop of Orkney was appointed at about this time.Woolf (2007) p. 309 Named Thorulf, he may have been the same person as \\"Roolwer\\", Bishop of the Isles.Crawford (1987) pp. 81–82; Watt (1994) p. 109–110 The original seat of the bishops of Orkney was Thorfinn's new Christ Kirk at Birsay, (or perhaps the Brough of Birsay), near the Earl's palace where Thorfinn had his residence in his later years.Orkneyinga Saga cc. 31–32Thomson (2008) pp. 85–87 Death and legacy The Orkneyinga saga dates Thorfinn's death no more precisely than placing it \\"towards the end\\" of Harald Sigurdsson's reign, who died at the battle of Stamford Bridge in 1066.Orkneyinga Saga, cc. 32–33 Thorfinn was buried at the Christ Church he himself had built. He is known to history as \\"Thorfinn the Mighty\\", and at his height of power, he controlled all of Orkney and Shetland, the Hebrides, Caithness and Sutherland, and his influence extended over much of the north of Scotland. The saga also makes a grander and more unlikely claim – that he controlled a total of seven earldoms in Scotland.Orkneyinga Saga c. 32 He was followed as earl by his sons Paul and Erlend and his widow Ingibiorg the \\"Earls' Mother\\" later married Malcolm Canmore, King of Scots. St Olaf's saga states that following Thorfinn's decease \\"many of the dominions that the earl had laid under himself were lost\\".Anderson (1922) p. 2 Interpretations There is clearly some doubt about the historicity of many of the claims in the Orkneyinga saga. Just as the backdrop to the supposed great expedition to the west undertaken by King Harald Fairhair that led to the founding of the Orkney earldom was the mid-13th century Norwegian contest with the Kings of Scots over the HebridesCrawford (1987) pp. 52-53. we can see parallels with later events that have been included as embellishments to the life of Thorfinn. The saga writer would have had access to Arnór jarlaskáld's Þórfinnsdrápa and whatever oral history was available in the early 13th century. There are also a number of parallels with the life of Harald Maddadsson and Woolf (2007) speculates that aspects of Thorfinn's story may have been included to legitimise the latter's adventures.Woolf 2007, p. 244 =Descent= The saga states that Thorfinn's grandfather was \\"King Malcolm of Scotland\\"Orkneyinga Saga c. 13 and it is often assumed that this was Malcolm II. However, both the Irish annals for this period and the Norse sagas have a tendency to refer to a \\"king of Scots\\" when discussing a regional chief or mormaer. Woolf (2007) suggests that the reference may then be to Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti a Pictish Mormaer of Moray or alternatively that, as elsewhere in Icelandic literature, Melkólmr was simply used as a generic name, in this case for Scottish royalty. =Chronology= One of two surviving pages of an early version of the Heimskringla known as the \\"Kringla leaf\\", which is kept in the National and University Library of Iceland. The text is part of Óláfs saga helga.\\"Óláfs saga helga--Heimskringla; Iceland, 1258-1264\\". National and University Library of Iceland. Retrieved 1 January 2015. The chronology of Thorfinn's life is problematic,Duncan (2002) p. 42. the dating of his assumption of the earldom being an example. The Heimskringla states that Thorfinn was 5 years old when his father Sigurd was killed at Clontarf, reliably dated to 1014. \\"When Thorfinn came of age he asked Earl Einar for a third of the islands\\" and it is clear from the text of the Orkneyinga saga that Einar, Brusi and Thorfinn were joint earls for a period. Muir (2005) states that Einar died in October 1020 but if Thorfinn was five years old in 1014 this would have made him only eleven by then. A rather earlier birthdate for Thorfinn is thus implied, with a coming of age c. 1016 at about the time of Sumarlidi's death. Similarly, Thorfinn is often stated as dying c. 1064, although Woolf (2007) states that \\"there is no reason why a date in the late 1050s is not just as credible.\\"Woolf (2007) p. 267 St Olaf's saga states that Thorfinn \\"took the earldom when he was five winters old, and he ruled for more than sixty winters\\" although this implies a very late death date of 1074.Anderson (1922) p. 3 One version of the Icelandic Annals has his rule lasting 52 years, providing the more commonly quoted year of death as c. 1065. =Ingibiorg= Related to this are the actions of his widow. Historians offering a later date for Thorfinn's death have proposed that Malcolm Canmore married a postulated daughter of Thorfinn named Ingibiorg rather than his widow. If a date in the 1050s is presumed, then Malcolm could well have married Ingibigiorg as the saga suggests.Crawford (1987) p.67, fig. 21, & p. 74; Donaldson (1990) pp. 57–58; Duncan (2002) pp. 41–43. Duncan (2002) argued that Malcolm came to marry Thorfinn's widow because he spent some or all of the period of MacBeth's reign in Orkney or Caithness at Thorfinn's court. Thorfinn and Malcolm were both descendants of Malcolm II, daughter's son and daughter's grandson respectively, and both had good reason to be hostile to MacBeth and his Moray kinsmen.Duncan (2002) pp. 38–42 Malcolm Canmore became king of Scots c. 1058 and the Orkneyinga Saga records that he and Ingibiorg had a son, Duncan who was later king.Orkneyinga Saga, c. 33. There is some circumstantial evidence that Ingibiorg may have backed Malcolm's claim to the kingship which adds further weight to a slightly earlier death date for Thorfinn, although the evidence for her marriage to Malcolm is not entirely convincing.Woolf (2007) p. 269 =Who was Karl Hundason= The identity of Karl Hundason, unknown to Scots and Irish sources, has long been a matter of dispute. His existence rests solely on the Orkneyinga saga, and more particularly on those elements of Þórfinnsdrápa which are preserved within it. Robertson (1862) proposed that Hundason should be identified with Duncan I.Robertson (1862) II pp. 477-479 Skene (1902) suggested that Karl (or Kali) Hundason should be identified with \\"Malcolm MacKenneth\\", a son of Kenneth III.Skene (1902) 1 c. 5 Another candidate is MacBethWilliams, Smyth & Kirby (1991) pp. 106-107 whose father may be called \\"jarl Hundi\\" in Njál's saga. Woolf (2007) proposes that Hundason, rather that being some hitherto unknown Scots king, was the son of Thorfinn's brother Hundi.Woolf (2007) pp. 309-310. However, Thomson (2008) notes that both the Orkneyinga saga and St Olaf's saga suggest Hundi only lived \\"a short while\\" and was unlikely to have had a son himself.Thomson (2008) pp. 75-77 Anderson (1990) suggested that this is \\"a fabulous story\\" and concluded that \\"[n]o solution to the riddle seems to be justified\\".Anderson (1990) p. 576, note 7 Muir (2005) points out that a literal translation of \\"Karl Hundisson\\" is \\"peasant son-of-a-dog\\", an insult that would have been obvious to Norse-speakers hearing the saga and that \\"we can assume this wasn't his real name\\".Muir (2005) p. 47 The implication is that there is no purpose in seeking phonetic parallels with known Scots personages. Thomson points out that both \\"Karl\\" and Hundi\\" are names used in other contexts without disparaging intentions although the combination is otherwise unknown. Thomson (2008) notes that the war with Hundasson seem to have taken place between 1029 and 1035 and that the Annals of Ulster record the violent death of Gillacomgain, brother of Máel Coluim mac Máil Brigti and Mormaer of Moray, in 1032. He too is thus a candidate for Thorfinn's Scots foe --and the manner of his death by fire bears comparison with Arnór's poetic description of the aftermath of the battle at Torfness.Thomson (2008) p. 79 Whoever Karl son of Hundi may have been, it appears that the saga is reporting a local conflict with a Scots ruler of Moray or Ross: > [T]he whole narrative is consistent with the idea that the struggle of > Thorfinn and Karl is a continuation of that which had been waged since the > ninth century by the Orkney earls, notably Sigurd Rognvald's son, Ljot, and > Sigurd the Stout, against the princes or mormaers of Moray, Sutherland, > Ross, and Argyll, and that, in fine, Malcolm and Karl were mormaers of one > of these four provinces.Taylor (1937) p. 338; see also Crawford (1987) pp. > 71–74. It is therefore entirely possible that Thorfinn's campaign was not fought against the Scottish crown as such but that rather the Scots may have been his allies in a struggle they both had against the power of Moray.Thomson (2008) p. 80 According to local tradition, a series of stone mounds on a hillside near Kirkhill, west of Inverness, marks the site of a battle between Thorfinn and 'Malcolm'. The location may have been close to the northern boundary of the medieval lordship of Moray at the time.Blar nam Feinne. Canmore. Retrieved 12 February 2018. =Christianity, morality and power= Modern statue in Bremen Cathedral of Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg, who may have met with Earl Thorfinn and who appointed Bishop Thorulf of Orkney. The joint rulership of earls was a recurring theme in the period up to 1214 and was \\"inherently unstable and usually ended in violence\\".Thomson (2008) p. 58 Thomson (2008) identifies these family feuds as being the main theme of the Orkneyinga saga, culminating in the martyrdom of St Magnus c.1115, and that the saga writer regularly emphasises the doom of \\"kin-slaying\\". In this case the Sigurdsson brothers do not assassinate one another, but rather Thorkel Fosterer becomes an intermediary, killing both Einar rangmunnr and, at a later date, Rögnvald Brusasson on behalf of Thorfinn.Orkneyinga Saga c. 29. It is also clear that there is a moral element to the tale, with Brusi cast as the peacemaker who is father to the noble Rögnvald and who stands in contrast to his greedy half- brother. Notwithstanding these roles, Thorfinn's Christianity is emphasised in the saga materials. The Norse in the Northern Isles would have been strongly influenced by the neighbouring Christian countries and it is likely that marriages to individuals from such polities would have required baptism even before his time. Informal pagan practice was likely conducted throughout his earldom,Woolf (2007) p 311 but the weight of archaeological evidence suggests that Christian burial was widespread in Orkney even during the reign of Sigurd Hlodvirsson, Thorfinn's father.Thomson (2008) p. 64 Furthermore, Brusi has a relatively minor role to play compared to Thorfinn \\"the Mighty\\", whose conquests included expansion well into north mainland Scotland and whose rule may have marked the zenith of Scandinavian influence in Scotland. As there were only seven traditional Scottish earldoms in total, the sagas claim that he held this many seems to suggest that he was King of Scots. However, this may reflect either a royal pretension of Thorfinn's, or given that his conquests were in the north and west rather than in the lowland heartland of Scotland, that they are references to local chieftainships. Although the saga suggests that the first Bishop of Orkney was installed towards the end of Thorfinn's time as earl, the first recorded bishop was Henry of Lund (also known as \\"the Fat\\") who was appointed sometime prior to 1035. He may have been more of a missionary bishop than a permanent resident in the islands,Watt and Murray (2003) p. 247. indeed there is no record of his ever having visited Orkney.Thomson 2008 p. 85 The bishopric appears to have been under the authority of the Archbishops of York and of Hamburg-Bremen at different times during this early period.\\"The Diocese of Orkney\\" Firth's Celtic Scotland. Retrieved 9 September 2009. =Relations with Norway= The Scar boat burial whalebone plaque found on the island of Sanday The role of the Norwegian crown is another recurring aspect of the saga. Crawford (1987) observes several sub- themes: \\"submission and of overlordship; the problem of dual allegiance and the threat of the earls looking to the kings of Scots as an alternative source of support; the Norwegian kings' use of hostages; and their general aim of attempting to turn the Orkney earls into royal officials bound to them by oaths of homage, and returning tribute to them on a regular basis.\\"Crawford (1987) pp. 76-77 King Olaf was a \\"skilled practitioner\\" of divide and rule and the competing claims of Brusi and Thorfinn enabled him to take full advantage. Thorfinn's journey in 1020 is the first occasion on which an earl of Orkney is known to have visited the royal court in Norway.Crawford (1987) pp. 78 The Icelandic annals have little to say about Orkney but under the year 1021 it is recorded that \\"Earl Thorfinn and earl Brusi, Sigurd's sons, gave the Orkneys into the power of King Olaf.\\" Although the saga writer paints a vivid and plausible picture of the scene, this \\"merely tell us that the thirteenth- century saga writer knew his Orkney traditions and the recurring factors which did indeed come to the fore on occasions during the thirteenth century when the kings and earls fought or negotiated from their related positions of strength\\". Although Thorfinn is clearly stated to be fighting in and around FifeOrkneyinga saga c. 20 p. 55 Thomson (2008) suggests that his presence so far south may have been as an ally of his grandfather rather than at the head of an invading army. He adds that King Cnut was in Scotland c. 1031 receiving the submission of Malcolm II, MacBeth and a third king called \\"Iehmarc\\" and that the location of the meeting is stated as being in Fife in a verse by Sigvatr Þórðarson. Thomson therefore speculates that Thorfinn's visit to Fife may have involved an attempt by Cnut to avoid a threat to his position from Orkney and that this issue was one of the factors involved in the feud between Thorfinn and earl Rögnvald, who supported Cnut's rival Magnus Olafsson.Thomson (2008) pp. 81-82 Finally, Thorfinn's death may have created a power vacuum and been a cause of the invasion of the Irish Sea region nominally led by King Harald harðraði 's young son Magnus Haraldsson dated to 1058. =In fiction etc.= MV Earl Thorfinn in Kirkwall harbour The basis of Dorothy Dunnett's 1982 novel King Hereafter is a point made by W. F. Skene, who noted that the historical sources which mention Thorfinn do not refer to MacBeth, and vice versa. Pursuing this idea, Dunnett wrote the novel on the premise that MacBeth and Thorfinn were the same person (Thorfinn is his birth name and Macbeth his baptismal name).Donaldson (1990) pp. 56–57 In his historical novel MacBeth the King Nigel Tranter portrayed Thorfinn as a half-brother of Macbeth, with a common mother. It also seeks to tie together the pilgrimages made to Rome by both, as one and the same. The MV Earl Thorfinn is a Ro-Ro vehicle ferry operated by Orkney Ferries on the northern route to Westray, Stronsay and neighbouring isles. It is identical to its sister ship MV Earl Sigurd.\\"Westray Ferry\\". Undiscovered Scotland. Retrieved 30 December 2014. References =Notes= =Citations= =Primary sources= * Anon.

Most of these small school buildings were of frame or log construction and only two were made of brick. In 1885 the scholastic population in the public schools was 3,135. By contrast, the scholastic population of Chester County now is about 2,400. Henderson had two school in the role of public schools and were run as consolidated schools. They were the Henderson Male and Female College on North Street and the Henderson Male and Female Masonic Institute. There was also a consolidated school at Montezuma, the old Jackson District High School, the Howard Seminary located at the junction of the Lexington-Purdy Road with the Enville-Henderson Road and the Pine Springs Normal School which was on the road to Roby not far from the current location of Bailey's Store. The average length of the school term was about fifty days during the summer months since the school houses were not suitable for use in cold weather. Consequently, attendance was not very good, work was not too effective, and many people sold their farms to move to areas with better schools. Until the advent of the school bus program in the early 1930s a student desiring to get a high school education had to provide his own transportation to Henderson or board in town, as the only high school was in Henderson. There were public schools for black children in Chester County in the nineteenth century. These schools were held in church buildings. There were schools in Chester County in churches as late as 1938. The first school building in the county for black children was built as early as 1906 in the northern part of Chester County on land given by Tom Cawthon. This school was named Cawthon School, soon followed by Oak Grove School. Schools in Masseyville and Montezuma were also built but both were destroyed by fire. The first black high school, Chester County Training School, was opened in 1932 and was located on Highway 45 North. In 1936, the first graduating class of seven pupils received their diplomas. This school was burned in 1949 but a new building was erected on the east side of town. In 1963, Chester County Training School's name was changed to Vincent High. In 1969, following integration, the school was closed; however, the building is now being used as North Chester Elementary.

Several generations of the de' Rossi participated in the family publishing firm established in the 17th century, which continued to produce engravings for the use of designers .

De' Rossi also produced a book of designs for altars and chapels, Disegni di Vari Altari e Cappelle, 1685.

The film features Alan Rickman as the prize- winning professor and Mary Steenburgen as his wife, with Bryan Greenberg as their kidnapped son. Principal photography for Nobel Son started on October 6, 2005, in Venice Beach, California, and ended on November 17, 2005. The official trailer and website were released on January 12, 2007. Plot Eli Michaelson (Alan Rickman), a self-involved chemistry professor, learns he has been awarded the Nobel Prize. After verbally abusing his wife, son, colleagues, and nominal girlfriend, he heads off to Sweden with his wife, Sarah (Mary Steenburgen), to collect his award. His son, Barkley (Bryan Greenberg), misses the flight. Barkley Michaelson has chosen to study not chemistry but anthropology, and this perceived failure triggers constant torrents of abuse from his father. His missing the flight, though, is the apparently innocent result of having been kidnapped by the deranged Thaddeus James (Shawn Hatosy), who claims to be Eli Michaelson's son by the wife of a former colleague. Thaddeus successfully obtains a ransom of $2 million, which he then splits with Barkley who, it appears, has orchestrated the kidnapping to obtain money from his father. Shortly after Barkley's release, Thaddeus rents a garage apartment from the Michaelsons and begins to charm Eli with his knowledge of chemistry. Barkley undertakes a campaign of psychological terror aimed at Thaddeus and his girlfriend, performance artist City Hall (Dushku). This ultimately results in the death of Thaddeus and commitment to a mental hospital for City. Meanwhile, Barkley kidnaps Eli and threatens to expose the scientific fraud that led to Eli receiving a Nobel Prize that he did not deserve. Eli's long-suffering wife, Sarah, demands a divorce while praising her son for his devious behavior. In the final scenes, Sarah, Barkley, and Sarah's police detective boyfriend, Max Mariner (Pullman) are seen on a tropical beach. Mariner appears to have been in the dark through most of the movie, but has figured out towards the end that he wants to be with Sarah and can live with the theft of $2 million from her scoundrel husband. Eli is seen in his classroom unrepentantly flirting with another student. He has lost his wife, son, and the money, but he still has his Nobel Prize and the professor position.

It was a pale brownish alien known for its multi-colored \\"Mohawk\\" hairdo and an obsession for eating Smith's Potato Crisps. The Gobbledok's fictitious home was Dok the Potato Planet. The Gobbledok became famous for the catchphrase \\"chippie, chippie, chippie!\\" The campaign was first conceived in 1987 by Sydney's George Patterson Advertising for what was then The Smith's Snackfood Company. Brainchild of in-house writer John Finklesen, the character was designed and brought to life by special effects creator Warren Beaton - also responsible for creating Wattie's NZ's \\"Getti\\" - and initially performed by small stature person Steven George who stood at 1.21m tall. The Gobbledok's voice was provided by veteran Australian voice actor Dave Gibson who had also done voices for several Australian television commercials as well as lending his voice to the well known Australian TV series Australia's Funniest Home Videos. Initially, Finkleston conceived of the Gobbledok as a one-off spot to introduce Smith's new \\"Seal of Freshness\\" packaging for their Chips - featuring a new less moisture-permeable wrapper. The very first TVC featuring the gobbledok began shooting on location at Sydney's Chatswood Coles Supermarket on 31 May 1987, and was Directed By John Clark & produced by Ian Iveson of Iveson Clark Productions, Agency producer for George Patterson was Des Freeman. The unexpected success of the Gobbledok's first \\"one-off\\" commercial spot lead to problems in further productions. As the first spot featuring the Gobbledok was never intended to be a continuing series, the animatronics Warren Beaton used to bring his design to life were necessarily limited in their facial expressions due to budget and time. With the increasing budget in later commercials, the Gobbledok costume became somewhat improved, but the range of expressions still had to relate to the first version. Smiths, aware of the success, later had the agency create a list of \\"rules\\" for the creature's behavior. The Gobbledok's trademark Red, Yellow, and Blue mohawk and hairdo was originally inspired by a popular receptionist at George Patterson's at the time of its inception in early 1987, the colours also suggested Smith's trademark packaging. The great popularity of the Gobbledok, and the associated rise in Smith's Crisps sales, prompted the long association of the Gobbledok with the Smith's brand in Australia. Gobbledok's many TV spot adventures included: *Having crashed his tiny spaceship into a supermarket carpark, he breaks in, then levitates up to a shelf to steal 'chippies'. *Riding with a truck driver named Big Eddie. After actress Robyn Moore - portraying a truck-stop waitress - says \\"you watch out for Gobbledoks then!\\", then Big Eddie replies \\"Gobbledoks? HAH! NOBODY believes in Gobbledoks!\\" knocking the fellow over with the shop door on the way out he follows Big Eddie towards his truck as he put the 3 packets down and then talks on his walkie talkie as the Gobbledok grabs his packets. As he drives off the little fellow starts talking to his crisps. Big Eddie then stops looking scared then the camera pans to the Gobbledok on his roof with his packets. *Being mistaken for a guest wearing a \\"great suit\\" at a costume party, then hovering across the pool with stolen chips. *Running at the \\"speed of sound\\" (inspired by the Mike Jittlov film The Wizard of Speed and Time). *Using \\"the Force\\" to steal Chippies from a lounging couple. *A Professor and assistant try to catch him by luring him into a trap but he again uses the force to steel the crisps and then the Professor lets go of the rope and they both look scared. *Uses the force to steel Smith's brand new flavours on a trolley while he is on a tree as a dog looks at him. *Looking through his telescope where he sees his old home and starts crying before he looks around and sees a married couple eating crisps and runs at top speed for them scaring a bulldog on his way who jumps into his owner's arms. *Hitching a ride, then Moving in with an elderly potato farmer. Who - responding to his wife's quip \\"Don't you think he's a bit... unusual?\\" - replies \\"It's all right, he's from the city, love\\". The series ran for 3 \\"episodes\\". *Being hunted by the police and the armed forces to the tune of \\"The Gobbledok is Coming to town\\". (to which, an undisclosed sum had to be paid to the estates of J. Fred Coots and Haven Gillespie, copyright owners of \\"Santa Claus is Coming to Town\\"). *Appearing in clips of old classic and B-grade movies such as Jason and the Argonauts and Plan 9 from Outer Space, climaxing with the film characters all \\"street dancing\\" along with the Gobbledok. *Bungee jumping Warner- Bros.-cartoon-style off a bridge to steal chips from a young girl riding in the back of a Pickup truck. This was the first use of CGI replacement of the Gobbledok \\"suit\\". The animation was done by Sydney's Animal Logic company. *Disguised as a rug while a man has some Smith's thinly cut chips watching Godzilla. The fellow then creeps towards him as he is about to grab another crisp the Gobbledok puts his hand on the table and snatches them as the man looks confused then the Gobbledok hides behind the man's chair and laughs hysterically as the man holds the bowl. *Sneaking into Woolworths to steel the New Smiths flavors that have just arrived. Attention has been often drawn to obvious \\"deliberate\\" bloopers, such as the Gobbledok's large golden ear ring swapping left to right from scene to scene, or that he had no visible teeth, or that it was rarely actually seen to put Crisps in his mouth. The Gobbledok campaign ran continuously for over 10 years until the mid-1990s. In 1996 a new Gobbledok was commissioned, but due to a change of advertising agencies, the TVC was never filmed. It has long since been replaced by a succession of new advertising campaigns. A facsimile of the original Gobbledok made a cameo in the Smith's Crisps \\"Eat happy\\" TVC in 2005. Since 1987 many Smith's Snackfoods trucks in Australia have carried the Gobbledok's trademark word \\"Chippies\\" on their sides. As of 2008, an illustration of the Gobbledok has begun to re- appear on some Smith's chips packaging. The Gobbledok also made an appearance at the launch of Hamish and Andy's 'peoples chip' which was gravy flavoured. In May 2010 Smiths re-introduced the Gobbledok into new TV commercials. A costumed performer was still used. Its then redesigned face was computer generated. At around 40 seconds into the 2015 Clemenger BBDO commercial \\"Happy Together\\" the Gobbledok can be spotted in its original \\"practical effects suit\\" equipped with its signature mohawk underneath a red construction hat. In the scene, the Gobbledok is wobbling idly behind a row of tradies on a crowded building site. The Gobbledok's most recent appearance is in Smiths \\"Comebacks\\" commercial. In this cameo the Gobbledok appears, squealing, from behind a tree in an Aussie backyard. The Gobbledok is again shown in its original 'practical effects suit' but without its signature coloured mohawk; this time the Gobbledok is sporting a flowing golden mane. The associated 'comeback' chip flavours Bega Cheese and Heinz Tomato Sauce, both feature this new golden- maned version of the Gobbledok. The monster can be seen hiding behind a chip shown on the packaging. Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band is a well-known fan of the Gobbledok, often seen wearing a homemade Gobbledok shirt onstage.

It operated as a division under the Israel Broadcasting Authority, until 14 May 2017, and the following day the frequencies were handed over to the Israeli Broadcasting Corporation (which replaced the IBA). History Kol Yisrael was originally an underground Haganah radio station that broadcast from Tel Aviv. It started consistently broadcasting in December 1947 under the name Telem-Shamir-Boaz, and was renamed to Kol HaHagana (\\"Voice of the Haganah\\") in March 1948. With Israel's declaration of independence on May 14, 1948, it was transformed into the official station Kol Yisrael. Another station named Kol Yisrael operated in Haifa, and was renamed Kol Tzva HaHagana (Voice of the Defense Force). The first Kol Yisrael transmission was a live broadcast from Tel Aviv of David Ben-Gurion reading of the declaration of independence. It was operated by a department of the Ministry of the Interior responsible for domestic and international broadcasts. Responsibility for the service was later transferred to the Office of Posts and Telegraphs and then to the Prime Minister's Office. The station inherited the facilities of the former Palestine Broadcasting Service which had been founded as the official broadcaster of the Mandate of Palestine in 1936, and had run the Kol Yerushalayim radio station. Kol Yisrael staff was made up both of former PBS personnel as well as former staffers at the underground radio stations run by the Haganah. Kol Yisrael pioneered the use of FM transmission. In the early years, stations were operated in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa. The PBS had had its transmitter in Ramallah, but this transmitter was lost to Kol Yisrael due to Ramallah being in the Arab sector and under Jordanian governance. In March 1950, international broadcasting was begun under the name Kol Zion La Golah (\\"The Voice of Zion to the Diaspora.\\") The broadcasts were produced at Kol Yisrael by the World Zionist Organization in cooperation with the Jewish Agency. In 1958, the international service was merged with the domestic broadcaster, with both services operating under the Kol Yisrael name. In 1965, the Israel Broadcasting Authority, an independent public entity, was created and took over responsibility for Kol Yisrael from the Prime Minister's office. In 1973, the IBA adopted the name Shidurei Yisrael (Israel Broadcasting) for the service's domestic radio and television services. The name Kol Yisrael was revived for the domestic and international radio service in 1979. Name: meaning and significance A previous station named Kol Yisrael had briefly been operated by the Haganah in 1940 on the 42-meter band. However, the station was soon renamed when the Haganah decided that the Kol Yisrael name should be reserved until independence. Besides meaning \\"voice of Israel\\", Kol Yisrael is also a wordplay which in Hebrew sounds like the phrase \\"all of Israel\\" (although spelled differently), known to many Jews as part of the Talmudic expression, \\"כל ישראל ערבים זה בזה\\" (\\"kol Yisra'el arevim ze baze\\", roughly translated, \\"all of Israel are responsible for one another\\"). An internet radio station was launched in 2014 and operated through 2015 under the confusing name of \\"Voice of Israel\\". This station is not connected to the official \\"Kol Yisrael\\" run by Israel Radio International. Broadcast channels Israel Radio Persian-language broadcasting Kol Yisrael channels include: *Kol Yisrael Israel Radio International – Broadcasting internationally in 14 languages: English, French, Persian, Bukhori, Yiddish, Spanish, Maghrebi Arabic, Georgian, Amharic, Tigrinya, Ladino, Hungarian, Romanian, and Russian.

Kol Yisrael's Arabic and Persian-language services have broadcast extensively to Arab countries and Iran for decades. As of April 1, 2008, only Persian to Iran is broadcast on shortwave, using leased airtime from Bezeq transmitters. The transmissions in Persian are occasionally jammed. Broadcasts to Arab countries are not jammed, apparently to avoid retaliatory jamming of their broadcasts to Israel. Kol Yisrael's Persian-language service is reportedly popular in Iran.Israel Radio Often Finds Best Friends Are Iranian - The New York Times - 20 February 1998 There are also educational stations broadcasting via low-power transmitters from colleges and universities across Israel under the collective banner of Tachana Chinuchit. Israel Radio International, also known as Reshet Hei (\\"Network E\\") (formerly known as Kol Zion Lagola), is a shell of what it used to be. As of July 29, 2007, the only program created for Israel Radio International, is Persian. The rest of the network is a direct relay of the REKA network. As of June 13, 2013, there are no shortwave broadcasts left of Israel Radio International. To listen, users are pointed to the new official Israel Radio International website. Transmission was shifted from shortwave to internet as a cost-saving measure. All of Kol Israel's stations are available worldwide through streaming audio over the Internet.

Early career  Adams debuted at the highest level for New Zealand in March 2002, but a bout of back injuries on the West Indies tour of 2002 allowed Jacob Oram to move ahead of him in the pecking order, limiting him to one Test. Following that, question marks were raised about his attitude. He played in the 2003 World Cup, but soon lost his place again and was resigned to a life in the wilderness until he received a very late call-up to New Zealand's one-day squad in England towards the end of the 2004 NatWest Series. He didn't end up playing, but later signed with Essex for the remainder of the summer, where he stayed for the 2005 and 2006 seasons. He had a productive 2006-07 domestic season for Auckland, claiming 32 wickets at 18.78 in New Zealand's domestic first-class State Championship and scoring 318 runs at 39.75. However, this was overshadowed by his one-month suspension for grabbing and shaking the helmet of Central Districts batsman Bevan Griggs. Along the way, Adams was recalled for three ODIs against Sri Lanka in December but was overlooked for the World Cup and lost his national contract in May 2007. He was overlooked again the following season, despite impressive performances in the State Championship, and the frustration prompted him to sign a two-year contract with the now defunct Indian Cricket League.  County Cricket  In 2007, Adams signed with English county Nottinghamshire. He had a fine 2010 County Championship, topping the bowling charts for the Country with 68 Wickets including the wicket of Shivnarine Chanderpaul to seal the Title at Old Trafford on the last day of the Season. 2011 was also very productive with 550 Runs and 67 wickets from 16 matches (including 7 Five Wicket Hauls) at 22.61, placing him third on the season's overall bowling table. He was a part of the Auckland side that won the New Zealand's domestic one-day cup and Twenty20 tournament in 2010-11, and traveled with the team in September to India for the 2011 Champions League T20. Adams had intended to end his professional career at Nottinghamshire where he had taken 334 first class wickets for an average of 24.18. He signed a three-month contract with Hampshire for the beginning of the 2015 season. Injuries limited him to only three first class appearances for Hampshire and he announced his retirement at age 39. He received high praise from his former club Nottinghamshire where he spent eight seasons for his role in inspiring younger bowlers at the club.  Coaching  In 2015 Adams joined the Auckland Cricket Club as bowling coach for the 2015/16 season. The club had a successful season and for the 2016/17 Adams will be Auckland A Head Coach.

The document – the title of which deliberately echoes the Czechoslovak human rights declaration Charter 77 20 years earlier – was created on the anniversary of a referendum held in 1996, and which, in the words of the organisation of the same name, declares: > \\"devotion to the principles of independence, freedom and democracy, respect > to the human rights, solidarity with everybody, who stands for elimination > of dictatorial regime and restoration of democracy in Belarus\\". Belarusian journalist Pavał Šaramiet acted as the group's spokesman at the declaration's public launch. Charter 97, as a citizens' human rights organisation based on the principles outlined in this document, is a non- partisan organisation which has organised protest rallies and has provided a springboard for other democratic movements in the country. It also maintains a website of news with a focus on human rights developments. The site's editor- in-chief, Natalla Radzina, received the 2011 International Press Freedom Award, \\"an annual recognition of courageous journalism\\", for her work. On 3 September 2010, the body of the founder of Charter 97, Aleh Biabienin, was found in his house near Minsk. According to initial statements by the Belarusian government, Biabienin committed suicide by hanging himself. However, friends of Biabienin have rejected this, stating that there was no indication he was planning to commit suicide, and that there were no messages or notes left behind. In the weeks following the disputed December 2010 presidential election – in which pro-democracy candidate Andrej Sańnikaŭ lost to Lukashenko, often called \\"Europe's last dictator\\" – a number of opposition protesters took to the streets, alleging fraud. Radzina and the Charter 97 staff posted numerous articles documenting arrests and injuries to the protesters by state security forces. On 21 December 2010, the Charter 97 office was raided by agents of the State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus (known in Russian as the \\"KGB\\"). Radina only had time to post \\"We're all at the KGB\\" on the site before being arrested and taken away. On 30 December 2011, Charter 97 fell victim to a hacking attack that deleted archives and posted false news articles to the site; it also suffered a denial of service attack.

This type of ocular surgery is indicated for a number of ocular tumors, in eyes that have suffered severe trauma, and in eyes that are otherwise blind and painful. Self-enucleation or auto- enucleation (oedipism) and other forms of serious self-inflicted eye injury are an extremely rare form of severe self-harm that usually results from mental illnesses involving acute psychosis. The name comes from Oedipus of Greek mythology, who gouged out his own eyes. Classification There are three types of eye removal: * Evisceration – removal of the iris, cornea, and internal eye contents, but with the sclera and attached extraocular muscles left behind * Enucleation of the eye - removal of the eyeball, but with the eyelids and adjacent structures of the eye socket remaining. An intraocular tumor excision requires an enucleation, not an evisceration. * Exenteration – removal of the contents of the eye socket, including the eyeball, fat, muscles, and other adjacent structures of the eye. The eyelids may also be removed in cases of cutaneous cancers and unrelenting infection. Exenteration is sometimes done together with maxillectomy (removal of the maxilla). Indications  * Cancer of the eye, such as retinoblastoma and uveal melanoma * Severe injury of the eye when the eye cannot be saved or attempts to save the eye have failed, such as after a globe rupture * End stage glaucoma * Phthisis bulbi * Painful, blind eye * In cases of sympathetic ophthalmia (inflammation of the eye) to prevent travel to the other eye, which if untreated can cause blindness * Congenital cystic eye * In a deceased person, so the cornea can be used for a living person who needs a corneal transplant by a surgical operation called keratoplasty * Constant infection in a blind or otherwise useless eye  Orbital implants and ocular prostheses  Removal of the eye by enucleation or evisceration can relieve pain and minimize further risk to life and well-being of an individual with the above noted conditions. In addition, procedures to remove the eye should address the resultant appearance of the orbit. Orbital implants and ocular prostheses are used by the surgeon to restore a more natural appearance. An orbital implant is placed after removal of the eye to restore volume to the eye socket and enhance movement or motility of an ocular prosthesis and eyelids. The eyeball is a slightly elongated sphere with a diameter of approximately 24 millimetres. To avoid a sunken appearance to the eye socket, an implant approximating this volume can be placed into the space of the removed eye, secured, and covered with Tenon's capsule and conjunctiva (the mucous membrane covering the natural sclera). Implants can be made of many materials with the most common being plastic, hydroxylapatite, metal alloy or glass. Later, once the conjunctiva have healed and post-operative swelling has subsided, an ocular prosthesis can be placed to provide the appearance of a natural eye. The prosthesis is fabricated by an ocularist. Its form is that of a cupped disc so that it can fit comfortably in the pocket behind the eyelids overlying the conjunctiva that covers the orbital implant. The external portion of the ocular prosthesis is painted and finished to mimic a natural eye color, shape and luster. It can be removed and cleaned periodically by the individual or a care giver. The two part system of orbital implant and ocular prosthesis provides a stable, and well tolerated aesthetic restoration of the eye socket. Although vision is not restored by removal of the eye with placement of an orbital implant and ocular prosthesis, a natural appearance can result. The implant, along with the attached, visible ocular prosthesis, can be moved by intact extraocular muscles that will track or move simultaneously with the other eye. The eyelids are able to move and blink over the prosthesis as well.

( ) is an American publicly traded company based in San Jose, California that manufactures a variety of digital media players for video streaming. Roku has an advertising business and also licenses its hardware and software to other companies. History Roku was founded in October 2002 as a limited liability company (LLC), by ReplayTV founder Anthony Wood. Roku (六) means \\"six\\" in the Japanese language, to represent the fact that Roku is the sixth company Wood started. In April 2007 Wood was named a vice president of Netflix. After Netflix decided to not build its own player, a new Roku company was incorporated in February 2008, based in Palo Alto, California, with Netflix as an investor of $6 million, to build a player. Later in 2008 company headquarters moved to Saratoga, California, further south in Silicon Valley. A round of venture capital funding from Menlo Ventures was announced in October 2008. Another round of about $8.4 million was disclosed in 2009. In 2015, the company announced it would be sub-leasing the buildings in Los Gatos, California from Netflix. On September 28, 2017, the company held an initial public offering of stock and began trading on the Nasdaq exchange. On November 9, 2017, the company acquired Danish-based smart speakers start-up company Dynastrom (including its AROS Technology). In 2017, Roku launched its self- serving advertising product to allow advertisers to serve ads to Roku's users. These include video ads, interactive video ads, audience development promotions and brand sponsorships. This was made possible through Roku allowing advertisers to transition from standard cable TV advertising to Roku's streaming platform. In 2016, Roku partnered with Magna, a media firm that specializes advertising, in order to incorporate targeted advertising on its streaming platform. In order to measure the success of its advertising efforts success, Roku partnered with Nielsen, a company that specializes in advertising effectiveness. In November 2019, Roku announced its acquisition of dataxu video advertising platform, for $150 million in cash and stocks. Roku shares rose more than two percent subsequent to the announcement. In July of 2019 Roku started moving to a new headquarters in San Jose, with plans to vacate offices subleased from Netflix.

The tone for urban fiction is usually dark, focusing on the underside of city living. Profanity, sex, and violence are usually explicit, with the writer not shying away from or watering-down the material. Most authors of this genre draw upon their past experiences to depict their storylines.  Genesis and historical forces  Contemporary urban fiction was (and largely still is) a genre written by African Americans. In his famous essay \\"The Souls of Black Folk\\", W. E. B. Du Bois discussed how a veil separated the African American community from the outside world. By extension, fiction written by people outside the African American culture could not (at least with any degree of verisimilitude) depict the people, settings, and events experienced by people in that culture. Try as some might, those who grew up outside the veil (i.e., outside the urban culture) may find it difficult to write fiction grounded in inner-city and African American life. City novels of yesteryear that depict the low-income survivalist realities of city living can also be considered urban fiction or street lit. In her book, The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature (2011),The Readers' Advisory Guide to Street Literature (2011) Vanessa Irvin Morris points out that titles considered canonical or \\"classic\\" today, could be considered the urban fiction or \\"street lit\\" of its day. Titles that depict historical inner-city realities include Stephen Crane's Maggie, A Girl of the Streets (1893), Charles Dickens's Oliver Twist (1838), Paul Laurence Dunbar's The Sport of the Gods (1902) and Langston Hughes's “The Ballad of the Landlord” (1940).The Ballad of the Landlord In this vein, urban fiction is not just an African American or Latino phenomenon, but, rather, the genre exists along a historical continuum that includes stories from diverse cultural and ethnic experiences.  Emergence of contemporary urban fiction  In the 1970s, during the culmination of the Black Power movement, a jailed Black man named Robert Beck took the pen name Iceberg Slim and wrote Pimp, a dark, gritty tale of life in the inner-city underworld. While the book contained elements of the Black Power agenda, it was most notable for its unsparing depiction of street life. Iceberg Slim wrote many other novels and attained an international following. Some of the terminology he used in his books crossed over into the lexicon of Black English. Other writers included Donald Goines and, notably, Claude Brown's Manchild in the Promised Land, which was published in 1965. Also published that year was The Autobiography of Malcolm X by Alex Haley. Because Haley's non-fictional read captured the realistic nature of African American urban life for coming-of-age young men, the book has consistently served as a standard for reading among African American teenaged boys.  Hip hop lit: hip hop music as an urban ballad  During the 1980s and early 1990s, urban fiction in print experienced a decline. However, one could make a cogent argument that urban tales simply moved from print to music, as hip hop music exploded in popularity. Of course, for every emcee who signed a recording contract and made the airwaves, ten more amateurs plied the streets and local clubs, much like urban bards, griots or troubadours telling urban fiction in an informal, oral manner rather than in a neat, written form. One of the most famous emcees, Tupac Shakur, is sometimes called a ghetto prophet and an author of urban fiction in lyrical form. Shakur's early poetry was posthumously compiled into a volume entitled The Rose That Grew from Concrete in 1999. Modern hip-hop literature in print form is a thriving and popular genre.PINTO, C. \\"Urban lit blazes off bookshelves.\\" Gannett News Service. 2009, August 31 Many non-fiction publications from figures in the hip-hop realm such as Russell Simmons, Kevin Liles, LL Cool J, and FUBU founder Daymond John feature prominently in this genre. Karrine Steffans and shock jock Wendy Williams have written blockbuster books for this audience. Both Steffans and emcee 50 Cent have had such success with their books that they were given their own imprints to usher in similar authors, such as for 50 Cent's G-Unit Books.  Contemporary street lit: The new wave of urban fiction  =1990s= Toward the end of the 1990s, urban fiction experienced a revival, as demand for novels authentically conveying the urban experience increased, and new business models enabled fledgling writers to more easily bring a manuscript to market and to libraries. The first writer in this new cycle of urban fiction was Omar Tyree, who published the novel Flyy Girl in 1996, which was reissued as a reprint in 1999. The genre gained significant momentum in 1999 with Sister Souljah's bestseller The Coldest Winter Ever.(Morris, Hughes-Hassell, Agosto, & Cottman, 2006) Teri Woods's True to the Game was also published in 1999, and became the standard from which the entrepreneurial publishing and distribution of contemporary urban fiction took note. The simultaneous publishing of these three novels created a momentum of readership for urban fiction and carried that wave for years. Thus The Coldest Winter Ever, True to the Game, and Flyy Girl are considered classics in the renaissance of the genre.(Morris, 2011) Sister Souljah describes the untapped market for urban fiction and the stereotypes that held it back in its early years: =2000–present= In less than a decade, urban fiction has experienced a renaissance that boasts thousands of titles. The newest wave of street fiction is urban Latino fiction novels such as Devil's Mambo by Jerry Rodriguez, Chained by Deborah Cardona (a.k.a. Sexy) and Jeff Rivera's Forever My Lady. Major writers of contemporary urban fiction include Wahida Clark, Vickie Stringer, Nikki Turner, K'wan, Toy Styles, Kole Black, Roy Glenn, Kwame Teague, who many believed penned Teri Woods' Dutch, and the writing duo Meesha Mink & De'Nesha Diamond. There is also an unexpected literary wave of hip-hop fiction and street lit, which was sparked by Sister Souljah. Authors with a book or books in this offering include Saul Williams, Abiola Abrams, and Felicia Pride. These are hip hop lit or street lit books that take a more literary approach using metaphor, signifying and other literary devices. These books may also be used in socially redeeming or classroom capacities, while maintaining love and positivity for the music and hip hop culture. With this new wave of renaissance, \\"street lit\\" was breaking new ground when it came to promotion and exposure. Aside from hand-to-hand sales, which seems to work best in a genre where word-of-mouth has proven to be worth more than any large ad campaign, the Internet has increased the authors' and publishers' ability to reach out to the genre's readers. With Internet savvy, many self-published authors who once had no shot of recognition are now household names, such as author Rasheed Clark, who went from relatively unknown, to being honored with fourteen Infini Literary Award nominations for his first two novels, Stories I Wouldn't Tell Nobody But God and Cold Summer Afternoon, both of which became instant bestsellers and proved that Clark was a fresh voice in African American fiction, and a leading African-American writer. Authors in this genre such as K'wan Foye, Nikki Turner, Toy Styles, and Kole Black are known for bringing street teams and other musical promotion efforts to the book scene. In recent years, some of these authors have joined with hip hop artists such as 50 Cent to further promote the genre by penning the musicians' real-life stories. In 2010, the hip hop music label Cash Money Records established a publishing branch, Cash Money Content. However, Cash Money Content's last book, Animal 3, was published in November 2014. Vickie Stringer is an urban lit author, as well as founder and CEO of her own publishing company, Triple Crown Publications, a publisher of 45 novels and 35 writers as of 2008. Forums like AALBC are often used to keep track of the progressive urban fiction genre as it grows tremendously daily. =Criticism= Early criticism of street lit was that books were badly edited due to lack of copy editing by independent publishers. However, in recent years the mainstream publishing industry recognized the genre's potential and signed many street lit authors to contracts, thus producing better packaged product. One such author was Treasure E. Blue, according to Kirkus Reviews Magazine, a self-published sensation—it has reportedly sold 65,000 copies before getting signed to a major six-figure deal with Random House Publishing. The reach of urban fiction into a large youth readership is undeniable today. Researchers have turned their attention to its influence on urban literacy, particularly among adolescent girls. Despite misgivings about editing quality issues, secondary school teachers in suburban settings have included urban literature in curricula, referring to it as \\"multicultural young adult literature\\" to expose students to \\"authentic\\" voices representing urban life.

Born and raised in Greenup County, Kentucky, Stuart relied heavily on the rural locale of northeastern Kentucky for his writings. Stuart was named the poet laureate of Kentucky in 1954. Early life Stuart was born near Riverton, Greenup County, Kentucky, to Mitchell and Martha (Hilton) Stuart on August 8, 1906. Stuart served in the US Navy during World War II but did not see combat as his mission in his life. In 1939, Stuart married Naomi Deane Norris, a school teacher. They settled in W Hollow and had one daughter, Jessica Jane. Education After being denied admission at three colleges, Stuart was finally accepted at and attended Lincoln Memorial University, located in Harrogate, Tennessee. After graduating he returned to his home area and taught at Warnock High School in Greenup, Kentucky. Later he was appointed principal at McKell High School, but resigned after one year to attend graduate school at Vanderbilt University, where Edwin Mims was one of his professors. He then served as superintendent of the Greenup County Schools before ending his career as an English teacher at Portsmouth High School in Portsmouth, Ohio. Poetry One day while Stuart was plowing in the field, he stopped and wrote the first line of a sonnet: \\"I am a farmer singing at the plow,\\" the first line of the 703 sonnets he would collect in Man with a Bull- Tongue Plow (1934). The book was described by Irish poet George William Russell (who wrote poetry under the name of AE) as the greatest work of poetry to come out of America since Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass. Stuart was named poet laureate for the Commonwealth of Kentucky in 1954, and in 1961 he received the annual award from the American Academy of Poets. Novels Stuart's first novel was Trees of Heaven (1940). Set in rural Kentucky, the novel tells the story of Anse Bushman, who loves working the land and wants more land. Stuart's style is simple and sparse. Taps for Private Tussie (1943) is perhaps his most popular novel, selling more than a million copies in only two years. The novel also received critical praise and won the Thomas Jefferson Memorial Award for the best Southern book of the year. In 1974, Gale Research (in American Fiction, 1900-1950) identified Jesse Stuart as one of the forty-four novelists in the first half of the 20th century with high critical acclaim. Jesse Stuart was the second youngest of that group (William Saroyan was one year younger). Short stories Stuart published about 460 short stories. He wrote his first short story \\"Nest Egg\\" when he was a sophomore in high school in 1923. The story is of a rooster at his farm, whose behavior was so dominant that it began attracting hens from other farms, leading to conflict with the neighbors. Twenty years later, he submitted the story unchanged to the Atlantic Monthly, which accepted the story and published it in February 1943; it was later collected in Tales from Plum Grove Hills. One of his most anthologized stories is \\"Split Cherry Tree,\\" first published in Esquire, January 1939. In this story, a high school teacher in a one-room schoolhouse keeps a boy after school to work and pay for damage he did to a cherry tree. The boy's uneducated father comes to school to argue with the teacher, but comes to appreciate the value of higher education. Enduring classic autobiography The theme of education appears often in Stuart's books. He described the role that teaching played in his life in The Thread that Runs So True (1949), though he changed the names of places and people. He first taught school in rural Kentucky at the age of 16 at Cane Creek Elementary School, which became Lonesome Valley in his book. The Thread that Runs So True (1949) has become a classic of American education. Ruel Foster, a professor at West Virginia University, noted in 1968 that the book had good sales in its first year. At the time, he wrote, sales for the book had gone up in each successive year, an astonishing feat for any book. The book has remained continuously in print for more than 50 years. Death Stuart died February 17, 1984 at Jo-Lin Nursing Home, near his boyhood home, in Ironton, Ohio. He was 77 years old. Jesse Stuart State Nature Preserve The natural settings of W Hollow were prominent throughout Stuart's writings. Prior to his death he donated of woodlands in W Hollow to the Office of Kentucky Nature Preserves. The Jesse Stuart State Nature Preserve is dedicated to protecting the legacy of Stuart, and ensures that a significant portion of W Hollow will remain undeveloped in perpetuity.

In 2008, David Jefferson Adams has been elected as the 44th President of the United States following a disputed election and a tie vote in the Electoral College (and subsequent tie-breaker by the United States House of Representatives), becoming the most hated and unpopular president in U.S. history. A combination of foreign terrorist attacks and poor economic conditions contributes to civil unrest. As a result, rioting springs up all throughout the United States, resulting in domestic terrorism. In response, President Adams uses the Homeland Security Act and declares martial law on many areas of the country, but it is particularly concentrated in the West Coast. Four years later, during the 2012 U.S. Presidential Election, the Supreme Court of the United States disqualifies all the popular presidential candidates from several states, effectively handing Adams his reelection. The public reacts violently when incumbent Adams accepts a second term. During the Inauguration Ball in Washington, D.C. on the night of January 20, 2013, a low-yield tactical nuclear weapon is detonated in an apparent groundburst, presumably having been concealed there in advance. The yield is sufficient to destroy most of the city, killing Adams, his cabinet, and most of the U.S. Congress, effectively wiping out the presidential line of succession, resulting in the United States being thrust into total chaos. The European Union Parliament meets in an emergency session, and votes to send peacekeepers to the Washington Metropolitan Area to secure international interests and protection of European citizens in the United States. As secessionist sentiment rises in America, the governor of California declares home rule, and California secedes from the Union on April 15, 2013. Texas follows a few days later on April 17, 2013, taking neighboring states with it and re-forming the Republic of Texas. Other factions form in the following months, and by 2014, all hopes for a peaceful resolution are gone and the Second American Civil War begins. Early in the war, Russia invades and occupies Alaska, using the expanded operations of the European Union as an excuse. The invasion is personally led by President Nicholai Vladekov, an ex-general and former Soviet hardliner, who claims that Alaska was never really part of the United States, and that Russia is merely reclaiming its former territory. What little resistance does occur is confused and disorganized, making the invasion largely unopposed. Later, Interpol reveals the results of its investigation regarding the Inauguration Day bombing. President Vladekov had been dealing weapons on the black market for more nearly thirty years, and masterminded the D.C. bombing as part of his goal to disrupt the world economy, so that Russia could regain its military dominance, and more easily control Europe. Protests throughout Russia force Vladekov to declare martial law in Moscow. After the former contiguous United States is unified under one faction, the independent Commonwealth of Hawaii agrees to join the new government. Vladekov refuses to cede control of Alaska, so the faction's forces prepare to invade the state and drive the Russians out of North America. A closing cinematic depicts the aftermath of the war. If the invasion fails, the reunified U.S. is still suffering unrest and faces an uncertain future. If the invasion succeeds and the player faction's reputation is very good, the troubled American states are \\"united again under uncommon greatness\\" – a leader whose merciful acts and strategic and tactical brilliance will be spoken of for centuries to come. If the player faction's reputation is very bad, the U.S. transforms into a new fascist state, \\"one that will never again feel the sting of dissent\\". =Factions= The factions in the game include the entirety or portions of the following states: *California Commonwealth: Arizona, California, Nevada, Utah *Commonwealth of Hawaii: Hawaii (non-playable faction) *Confederacy: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia *European Union Occupation: Delaware, District of Columbia, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia *Great Plains Federation: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin *New England Alliance: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, West Virginia, Vermont *Pacifica: Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Wyoming *Republic of Texas: Arkansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas *Russia: Alaska (only multiplayer) Gameplay The game is based on a hex grid system. The various factions left over when the country broke apart (see below) wage warfare in numerous territories. The amount of income the player gets each round of attacks is based on how many territories he controls. When attacking a territory, the player selects which of his units to deploy to that area on the Deployment screen. If a unit is deployed to one area, it cannot be redeployed to another until that round of attacks is over. Each side can choose to either manually place their units on the battlefield where they want them to be, or have the computer do it for them automatically, with the Manual and Auto buttons on the deployment screen. In each area there are various forms of terrain, each with its own effect on how a unit moves. Roads enable much faster movement, but decrease the unit's defense score. Forests, mountains, swamps, and other such terrain greatly decrease unit movement, but most increase defense. Cities do not have much of an effect on a unit's movement (unless a road runs through it, in which case it is increased), but increase the unit's defense. If not crossed by a bridge, rivers heavily hinder unit movement, slowing down infantry, requiring a whole day (turn) to cross for some vehicle units, and completely blocking other units, which must search for an intact bridge. Two units, enemy or allied, can never occupy the same hex at once. Combat itself takes the form of one unit directly engaging another, without outside interference from any other units which might be in the area. The attacking unit always fires first. If the defending unit is still alive following the first strike, it will retaliate against the attacking unit. Each unit can only attack once per turn and retaliate once per turn, unless a sidebar power enables another attack. Air attacks are always retaliated against, provided that the unit has an anti-air score and will not get killed by the air unit's attack first. Each unit type has three statistics for attacking: effectiveness against infantry (EI), effectiveness against vehicles (EV), and effectiveness against air units (EA). If the attacker's effectiveness stat against the unit type of the defender is higher than the defender's armor rating, damage will be done according to Attacker Effectiveness # - Defender Armor #. If not, no damage or extremely low damage will be done. Some units are specialized to only be able to attack a single type of unit. If enough damage is done to a unit, it will be destroyed. The objective of the battle is either to destroy all the enemy's units or capture enough objective towns to control the battlefield. Objective towns can be identified for both their Objective Point worth and position on the Map screen, and can be made visible on the main battle screen using the Objective button (flag). On the left side of the screen are the Sidebar Powers. These powers recharge over time, and the amount of time until they are usable again is shown over their picture/button. In the campaign, depending on his political rating (judged by how much Collateral Damage (see below) he inflicts), the player will get more powers of varying type. =Unit data= In battle, if the player clicks on one of his own units, a bar will appear in the lower right corner. This bar shows all the immediate stats for the unit, including EI, EV, and EA stats, their armor rating (how much attack power a unit can shrug off before it takes damage), their health rating (how much more damage the unit can take until it dies) and their gas level. Gas is required for vehicle and helicopter units to move- moving one hex drains one point of gas. If a unit runs out of fuel, it can still attack within its range, but it cannot move for a turn or so until it is resupplied. Infantry, obviously, do not require fuel. There will also be a question-mark button next to the basic stats. Clicking this gives the player a more detailed setup of stats, including its Movement rating (the tire; how many hexes a unit can move per turn), its Attack Range (the target; how many hexes away from itself the unit can attack), its line-of-sight (binoculars; how far away from itself the unit can see), and its [cCollateral damage rating (explosion; how much damage the unit will do depends on the surrounding environment when it attacks). As units survive multiple combats they also increase in rank. Higher ranked units gain bonuses to their attack, defense, and health. =Specific units= There are three general types and nine general classes of units. The types are Infantry, Vehicles, and Aircraft. The classes are One-Time Use units, Infantry, Light Armor, Medium Armor, Heavy Armor, Artillery, Anti-Aircraft, Helicopters, and Aircraft. Each class has a variety of specific units, varying in effectiveness with cost. One-time use units These are units that a faction can purchase for use in a single battle. These include defensive towers and bunkers, fixed artillery, and light infantry. Infantry There are three varieties of infantry units, each with its own specialized purpose. Commando- style units are effective against infantry and vehicles, but have no anti-air ability. Heavy infantry are able to attack aircraft and vehicles. Engineers are the weakest in direct combat, but have the ability to construct and place barbed wire, dragon's teeth (an anti-vehicle barricade), and land mines that damage enemies which move over them. Light, medium, and heavy armor All three of these are varieties of armor, with similar abilities and differing mainly in cost to attack points. Armor is a primarily anti-vehicle class, but some varieties are more effective against infantry. Light armor is armored personnel carriers like the M2/M3 Bradley, medium armor is light tanks like the EU's French-made AMX-30, and heavy armor consists of main battle tanks like the M1 Abrams and the EU's German-made Leopard 2. In addition, 6 out of the 7 factions fields a unique, more expensive heavy armor unit, such as the slow-moving but extremely well armed and armored Hood tank fielded by the Republic of Texas. Artillery Similar to fighters and bombers, artillery units are powerful support units, but possessing many significant limitations. A target must be at least two hexes away for artillery to fire on it, leaving such units vulnerable to close-up attacks. Artillery units can also do little to defend themselves in most cases, with only a few out of all in the game having any real armor and/or anti-air capability. However, artillery units have the longest firing range of any unit type in the game- up to five hexes away. Though they require extensive support and are vulnerable by themselves, artillery units are extremely powerful and can prove devastating if used in significant numbers. One of the factions fields a unique self-propelled artillery. Anti-air Anti-air units have low or nonexistent ratings against armor and moderate to nonexistent ratings against infantry, but they are unparalleled in their ability to destroy any airborne unit. In addition, each anti-air unit has a \\"radius of protection\\" around it; any fighter or bomber unit attacking another unit within that radius gets attacked by the AA unit as well as the defending unit. Helicopters With the longest line-of-sight, the highest per-turn movement rate, and unimpeded by terrain, helicopters make both good scout and combat units. They can move from one front of attack to another with high speed, and are effective against most types of units. A significant downside to helicopters is that they cannot capture or hold objectives, which means they can only act as support. Helicopters also attract considerable attention from enemy fighter aircraft and AA units, meaning they ultimately require much support from a faction's other air and ground forces. Aircraft Aircraft do not move along the field like other units- they are based at an Airfield and are called in via the Air Strike command menu. There are two types of aircraft: fighter and bomber. Both are extreme in their cost of purchase and capability in combat, but have significant limitations. AA fire and enemy fighters are a significant threat to both types of aircraft- if the enemy has two or more such units in range of an area where a fighter or bomber is ordered to attack, the aircraft will be destroyed. Fighter craft have no ground attack capability- they can only fight against other aircraft. Fighters can also \\"patrol\\" an area from around a hex visible to the player, lending their line- of-sight to it and their protection to the units below- if an enemy aircraft tries to attack a unit within the radius of the fighter's patrol sweep, it is intercepted- but not always shot down- by the fighter. Patrols reset after one turn of both the player and the enemy. Fighters always cause damage to other fighters in battles, even if the other fighter shoots them down; however, a patrolling fighter attacking another craft coming into its patrol radius (if not directly attacked itself) does not suffer retaliatory attack. Bombers, on the other hand, have no anti-air capability. They cannot patrol as fighters do, but instead are called into attack a single target and leave. The attacks of bombers can cause devastating damage to enemy units, and bombers are able to withstand more enemy fire than fighters. They are some of the most expensive units in the game, and the loss of even one to AA fire can sometimes mean an irreparable blow to that faction. Reception Shattered Union received \\"average\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The gameplay was praised as being \\"simple but deep\\", and the concept was well liked, while criticisms included unbalanced AI and a total lack of any diplomacy features. Legacy =Film adaptation= In 2009, Variety and Gamasutra reported that Jerry Bruckheimer was creating a movie adaptation of the video game to be distributed by Touchstone Pictures. J.

It is used to open parachutes automatically for paratroopers and novice parachutists.  Design and use  A static line is a cord attached at one end to the aircraft and at the other end to the top of the jumper's \\"D-Bag\\" (deployment bag, into which the canopy is packed). The parachutist's fall from the aircraft causes the static line to become taut, this then pulls the D-Bag out of the container on the jumper's back. The static line and D-Bag stay with the aircraft as the jumper leaves, and is pulled back into the aircraft by the dispatcher. Now free of its D-Bag, the canopy is allowed to inflate as the jumper continues to fall. Effectively, the jumper drags the parachute behind him, causing the upward-rushing wind to force open and inflate the canopy. The canopy should inflate and begin supporting the jumper within 4 seconds. In the unlikely event of a malfunction, students are taught how to cut away the main canopy and deploy the reserve chute. The aim of static line progression is to train students to maintain the correct, stable body position upon exiting the aircraft, and to teach how to deploy the canopy via the pilot chute mechanism. As mentioned above the parachutist must adopt and maintain a stable body position throughout deployment to minimize the chances of a parachute malfunction. This method of parachute deployment is commonly used in several ways: * Training student skydivers,Poynter, Dan (1993). Parachuting Manual With Log for the Static Line Course.

For training students in civilian operations, modifications to existing static line equipment may be made to simplify operations. One such modification is to attach the deployment bag to the parachute instead of the static line, which also requires some modification to allow the static line to detach, typically a Velcro fastener. This leaves much less material \\"in the wind\\" behind the plane after the jumper has left. This isn't a problem for larger cargo aircraft used in military jumping, but presents a major issue for smaller aircraft used in civilian operations. This modification also results in a somewhat slower opening, which softens the opening shock at the cost of altitude, a minor concern for jumpers exiting at .

He supported the Royalist cause in the English Civil War. Livingston was the only son of Sir John Livingstone, 1st Baronet, of Kinnaird, Perth and his wife Jane Sproxton, daughter of Richard Sproxton of Wakefield, Yorkshire. He succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet in 1628.History of Parliament Online - Livingston, James, 1st Earl of Newburgh He matriculated at Merton College, Oxford on 17 December 1638, aged 16 'Alumni Oxonienses, 1500-1714: Lee-Llewellin', Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 (1891), pp. 892-921. Date accessed: 27 June 2012 and travelled abroad in France from about 1642 to 1646. When he joined King Charles at Newcastle in 1646, he was created Viscount of Newburgh in the Peerage of Scotland. He and his wife made plans in December 1648 to rescue the King before his trial but nothing came of it and they fled to the Netherlands. In 1650 he went with Charles II to Scotland, subscribed to the Covenant, and took his seat in the Scottish House of Lords. He was a lieutenant colonel in the Life Guards at the Battle of Worcester and after the battle he fled abroad again where he spent his time duelling and corresponding with the Scottish Royalists. From 1656 to 1658 he was a colonel of horse in the Spanish army and commanded a Scottish Royalist regiment which fought at the battle of the Dunes. After the Restoration, Livingston was captain of the bodyguard in Scotland and was created Earl of Newburgh, Viscount of Kynnaird and Lord Livingston. He became lord of the manor of Cirencester in 1660 through his second marriage. In 1661 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cirencester in the Cavalier Parliament. He was awarded MA at Oxford on 9 September 1661. Livingston died at the age of about 48 and was buried at St. Margaret's, Westminster. Livingston married firstly before 1648 Katherine Stuart, widow of George, 9th Seigneur d'Aubigny and daughter of Theophilus Howard, 2nd Earl of Suffolk. They had one daughter, Elizabeth (1648-1717), who was brought up in England by his sister Dorothy Livingston, the wife of Sir Charles Stanhope, and married Robert Delaval. She is known for her journal and moral reflections.Douglas G. Greene, The Meditations of Lady Elizabeth Delaval Written Between 1662 and 1671 (Surtees Society, 1975).

The film was based on the 1989 novel Weapon by Robert Mason, and was adapted into a screenplay by David L. Corley for Columbia/TriStar Pictures. Plot Solo (Van Peebles) is an android designed as a military killing machine. He is sent to Central America by General Haynes (Barry Corbin) to battle guerrilla insurgents, but a flaw develops in his programming and he develops a conscience and compassion. His developers try to take him back for deprogramming, but he flees to the jungle in a helicopter. His main energy supply was damaged during the first mission, forcing him to switch to his much less powerful secondary power. He joins a small village community that is under constant threat from guerilla attackers, and he protects them in exchange for use of their electric generator (they previously used it to power a TV). There he learns to 'bluff' from a child that befriends him, Miguel. Solo helps the villages drive off a local Warlord (Demián Bichir) and his small army, but the combat is detected by a military satellite. A black ops team is sent to recover or destroy Solo, while they ally with the Warlord. The black ops leader, Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) brings in Solo's creator (Adrien Brody) as a lure, leaving the man mortally wounded but Solo survives. Having occupied the village, the militiamen and black ops team attempt to kill Solo, but he is able to kill all of them. The Warlord is betrayed by Madden, who tries to kill Solo with an automatic grenade launcher. Solo is able to fight Madden in hand-to-hand combat and non-fatally break his spine. Suddenly a helicopter delivers a more powerful version of the android (Sadler), which is armed with a multi-barreled gun and has Madden's face. The MkII kills Madden and proceeds to hunt down Solo. Solo is able to save the villagers and beat the MkII android, using his acquired bluffing skills. After the temple the two androids fought in collapses, causing the military to pull out believing both units are destroyed and unrecoverable, Miguel, Solo's companion, mourns Solo believing he was destroyed by cave-in, but Miguel starts to hear Solo, laughing, as he knows he has earned his freedom.

Upon arrival in the New World, he was a signer of the Mayflower Compact. James Chilton was one of the earliest to die that winter, perishing within the following month.Pilgrimσ Hall Museum  Life in England  Chilton was born about 1556 (age 63 in 1619) probably in Canterbury, Kent, England. The Chilton surname is an ancient one that appears in records from at least 1339, when his ancestor Robert Chilton was a Canterbury parliamentary representative.A genealogical profile of James Chilton, (a collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society accessed 2013) His father was Lyonel Chilton.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691 (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 262 James became a freeman in 1583 in Canterbury, and in a Canterbury Quarter Session in the next year, he was recorded as being a tailor. Per Banks, in 1583 he was recorded as James \\"Chylton\\", citizen and tailor of Canterbury.Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623 (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 45 James Chilton married about 1586 (date based on his first child's baptism date). Research has not revealed the name of his wife, which was at one time thought to have been his stepsister, Susanna Furner, but recent research has found this not to be true. As far back as 1840 Nahum Mitchell's History of Bridgewater provided the given name of James' wife as \\"Susanna\\", but there is no solid documentary evidence to this claim. James Chilton and his wife had seven children who were baptized in Canterbury, Kent between 1587 and 1589. About 1600 the family moved to Sandwich, also in Kent, where three more children were baptized. It is believed that here James met Moses Fletcher, who was also a Mayflower passenger, as well as other Separatists who later went to Holland, and so became part of the English Leiden religious company. Sandwich was becoming a center of Separatist activity, and was home to several future members of John Robinson's Leiden church. The first evidence that the Chilton family had its own Separatist views appears in 1609. In late April, Chilton's wife was among four people who secretly buried a dead child, without having the Church of England perform its mandatory burial rites.  Life in Leiden  After the excommunication, sometime between 1609 and 1615, James Chilton and his family left England and joined John Robinson's congregation in Leiden, Holland. The first the family is heard from in Leiden is on July 2, 1615 when their eldest daughter Isabella married Roger Chandler. She is recorded as \\"Ysabel Tgiltron spinster from Canterbury.\\" James Chilton's name was recorded for the first time in Leiden records on April 30, 1619 when he made a Leiden Remonstrant statement. An incident involving James and a daughter was recorded in Leiden on April 28, 1619, when it was reported that as they were returning to their home, about twenty boys began throwing rocks at them. When Chilton confronted the crowd, he was struck in the head by a large cobblestone, and was knocked unconscious.(in Dutch) 008 reg./ONA180fo. 239/30-4-1619 State of Facts, Leiden, The Netherlands: Leiden Pilgrim Archives, retrieved 2008-11-17Jeremy D.

Leiden Pilgrim Documents Center Leiden, The Netherlands  On the Mayflower  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 All members of the James Chilton family did not travel on the Mayflower. The Chilton family on that ship consisted of James Chilton, age about sixty-four and the oldest Mayflower passenger, his wife and their daughter Mary, age about thirteen. Their daughters Isabella, married in 1615, and Ingle (Angel) stayed behind in Leiden. Isabella later came to Plymouth, but Ingle stayed in Leiden and married in 1622. She was still in Leiden in 1636, when she remarried. The records of their other children are not complete, although it is known that some died in infancy. James Chilton and his family left Plymouth, England aboard the Mayflower on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton. Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. And after several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas and a damaged ship forced them to return to the Cape Cod Hook where they anchored on November 11/21. Since there were no established laws where they landed they wrote the Mayflower Compact, which made rules on how they would live and treat each other.

Bradford's statement that Chilton had another daughter is the only proof that Isabella came to Plymouth.William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), p. 449 The family probably came to Plymouth in either 1629 or 1630 when Bradford states that \\"the rest of the Leiden contingent arrived\\".William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation by William Bradford, the second Governor of Plymouth (Boston: 1856), pp. 105-107 There is also an earliest tax record showing Roger Chandler March 25, 1633. Chandler is also shown in a record of those men able to bear arms in 1643, and a land record in 1644. He is also listed as a Freeman in 1648. Chandler died in Duxbury between 1658 and 1665. In October 1665, the land in Plymouth Colony (150 acres) is granted to the three unnamed daughters of Roger Chandler, deceased. 2 Jane Chilton was baptized June 8, 1589. 3 Joel Chilton was born about 1591 and buried in 1593. 4 Mary Chilton (first with that name) was born and died in 1593. 5 Elizabeth Chilton was baptized July 14, 1594. 6 James Chilton (the first with that name) was baptized August 22, 1596. 7 Ingel (Ingell) (Angel) Chilton was baptized on April 29, 1599. She married Robert Nelson in Leiden, Holland on August 27, 1622. She also married to Daniel Pietersz in Leiden on 26-3-1636 and to Matthijs Tilligem on 27-6-1637, witness was her sister Christina and her brother-in-law to be, Dionys van Steenstraten. http://www.archiefleiden.nl/home/collecties/personen/zoek-op- personen/q/persoon_achternaam_t_0/Nelse http://www.archiefleiden.nl/home/collecties/personen/zoek-op- personen/q/persoon_achternaam_t_0/Tilligem http://www.archiefleiden.nl/home/collecties/personen/zoek-op- personen/q/persoon_achternaam_t_0/Gilten?sort=datum_i&direction;=asc 8 Christian was baptized on July 26, 1601.

Her parents died early at Plymouth Colony. She was an orphan at age 13. In the 1623 land division, a \\"Marie\\" Chilton received shares for her parents' land. Since it is listed between Alden and Standish, it has been suggested that she lived with either of those two families. There is no record which states with whom she lived after her parents' death. Between July 1623 and May 22, 1627, she married John Winslow in Plymouth. They had ten children. John is listed as having arrived at Plymouth in 1621 aboard the Fortune. John and Mary are part of the records of the 1627 division of cattle. John died before May 21, 1674, which is the date his will is proved.

Every year since its inception, SPX has put on a festival, known as The Expo, that provides a forum for artists, writers and publishers of comic art in its various forms to present their creations to the public and to expose the public to comic art not normally accessible through normal commercial channels. The annual SPX festival, typically held in the fall in Bethesda, Maryland, rivals the Alternative Press Expo as the premiere convention for alternative comics creators and fans. SPX is unique amongst the various comic conventions as it does not allow retailers to have a formal presence at the convention. Only creators and publishers are allowed to set up at the festival, although retailers can and do attend the show with the general public through paid admissions. SPX is the home of the Ignatz Awards, which have been presented there annually since 1997.\\"Small Press Expo Initiates First Festival Prize for Comic Books: Ignatz Award,\\" Comics Buyer's Guide (Sept. 12, 1997), p. 8 As one of the few festival awards rewarded in comics, they are voted on by attendees. SPX is closely associated with the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund (CBLDF). A portion of the profits from the annual SPX festival including raising activities that take place during the convention weekend, go to the CBLDF. Since 1997, SPX has been held in conjunction with the International Comics and Animation Festival (ICAF) many times.  History  SPX was founded in 1994 by a group of Washington-Baltimore area retailers to promote diversity in the comics marketplace. It also coincided with Dave Sim's \\"Spirits of Independence\\" tour. Attendees of the early years often speak of the close-knit community that was attained during the convention, citing offbeat occurrences such as James Kochalka's nude musical performance in 1998 and the annual pig roast/picnic. Both the Expo and ICAF, scheduled for September 14–16, were cancelled in 2001 due to creators' travel difficulties related to the September 11, 2001 attacks.\\"Newswatch: SPX/ICAF Cancelled in Wake of Terrorist Attacks on New York and Washington DC,\\" The Comics Journal #238 (Oct. 2001), p. 100.

In this interview they revealed that Camp Delta was in the midst of a widespread hunger strike. Borekzai and Russol estimated that over 180 detainees were participating in the hunger strike, and that it had been going on for over two weeks. Initially DoD spokesman Flex Plexico denied any knowledge of a hunger strike. On July 21, 2005, three days after their departure, Plexico claimed that only a small number of detainees had been refusing food, and that they had only been doing so for three days. The lawyers of Guantanamo details later corroborated the details of the Afghans claims, saying that they had been aware of the hunger strike as early as June 23, 2005, but had not been able to say anything because of a DoD gag place on them.

Advanced Organic Chemistry, 3rd Ed.; John Wiley & Sons: Chichester, 1985; S. 499ff.Blatt, A. H. Org. React. 1942, 1. It involves migration of an acyl group of phenol ester to the aryl ring. The reaction is ortho and para selective and one of the two products can be favoured by changing reaction conditions, such as temperature and solvent.  Mechanism Despite many efforts, a definitive reaction mechanism for the Fries rearrangement has not been determined. Evidence for inter- and intramolecular mechanisms have been obtained by crossover experiments with mixed reactants. The Reaction progress is not dependent on solvent or substrate. A widely accepted mechanism involves a carbocation intermediate. The Fries rearrangement In the first reaction step a Lewis acid for instance aluminium chloride co-ordinates to the carbonyl oxygen atom of the acyl group. This oxygen atom is more electron rich than the phenolic oxygen atom and is the preferred Lewis base. This interaction polarizes the bond between the acyl residue and the phenolic oxygen atom and the aluminium chloride group rearranges to the phenolic oxygen atom. This generates a free acylium carbocation which reacts in a classical electrophilic aromatic substitution with the aromatic ring. The abstracted proton is released as hydrochloric acid where the chlorine is derived from aluminium chloride. The orientation of the substitution reaction is temperature dependent. A low reaction temperature favors para substitution and with high temperatures the ortho product prevails, this can be rationalised as exhibiting classic Thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control as the ortho product can form a more stable bidentate complex with the Aluminium. Formation of the ortho product is also favoured in non-polar solvents; as the solvent polarity increases, the ratio of the para product also increases. Scope Phenols react to form esters instead of hydroxyarylketones when reacted with acyl halides under Friedel-Crafts acylation conditions. Therefore, this reaction is of industrial importance for the synthesis of hydroxyarylketones, which are important intermediates for several pharmaceuticals. As an alternative to aluminium chloride, other Lewis acids such as boron trifluoride and bismuth triflate or strong protic acids such as hydrogen fluoride and methanesulfonic acid can also be used. In order to avoid the use of these corrosive and environmentally unfriendly catalysts altogether research into alternative heterogeneous catalysts is actively pursued.  Limits In all instances only esters can be used with stable acyl components that can withstand the harsh conditions of the Fries rearrangement. If the aromatic or the acyl component is heavily substituted then the chemical yield will drop due to steric constraints. Deactivating meta-directing groups on the benzene group will also have an adverse effect as can be expected for a Friedel–Crafts acylation.  Photo-Fries rearrangement In addition to the ordinary thermal phenyl ester reaction a photochemical variant is possible. The photo-Fries rearrangement can likewise give [1,3] and [1,5] products. that involves a radical reaction mechanism. This reaction is also possible with deactivating substituents on the aromatic group. Because the yields are low this procedure is not used in commercial production. However, photo-Fries rearrangement may occur naturally, for example when a plastic object made of polycarbonate, or certain types of polyester or polyurethane, is exposed to the sun, particularly to UV light at a wavelength of about 310 nm, if the plastic has been heated to 40° Celsius or above (as might occur in a car with windows closed on a hot summer day). In this case, photolysis of the ester groups would lead to leaching of phthalate from the plastic. Photo Fries rearrangement  Anionic Fries rearrangement  In the anionic Fries rearrangement ortho-metalation of aryl esters, carbamates and carbonates with a strong base results in a rearrangement to give ortho-carbonyl species.

His early work focused on portraits of the many ships in New Bedford Harbor. In 1858, his painting New Bedford Harbor at Sunset was included in Albert Bierstadt's landmark New Bedford Art Exhibition. Career He is known for his paintings of ships and Arctic seascapes. He went on several Arctic expeditions with Dr. Isaac Israel Hayes, and was the first American painter to portray the frozen regions of the north. In 1862, Boston, he was an art teacher to Charles Dormon Robinson. With funds provided by LeGrand Lockwood, Bradford traveled to the Arctic aboard the steamship Panther in 1869, accompanied by photographers John L. Dunmore and George Critcherson. Upon his return, Bradford spent two years in London, where he published an account of his trips to the north, entitled The Arctic regions, illustrated with photographs taken on an art expedition to Greenland; with descriptive narrative by the artist.(London, 1873) In 1874, he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member. He was associated with the Hudson River School, not an institution but rather an informal group of like- minded painters. He adopted their techniques and became highly interested in the way light touches water and how it affects the appearance of water surfaces and the general atmospherics of a painting. He compositionally balanced many of his paintings by creating a counter-subject and by placing darker colors around the edges, framing and counteracting the center's better- lit subject.

Unlike most college strips, its popularity led to a print life past Hurt's graduation.  Publication history  The strip ran in the college's The Daily Texan from 1980–1990, though examples from 1978-1979 exist. In 1983, Austin's daily paper, the American-Statesman, picked up the strip. Other newspapers around the U.S. followed suit, although Eyebeam's family of subscribers was never greater than a few dozen. By 1982, Eyebeam's popularity was such that a monster character called Hank the Hallucination ran for the University of Texas Student Government presidency (campaign slogan: \\"Get Real\\") and won. A figment of Eyebeam's imagination even within the boundaries of the comic, Hank received more votes than the two human candidates combined. After it was ruled that imaginary characters could not serve in the post, future Democratic adviser and CNN political contributor Paul Begala was the campus' second choice. Following his loss, Begala wrote a tongue-in-cheek complaint for the Texan, arguing \\"I cannot help but feel Hank's platform is illusory at best .... I must say that the candidate himself lacks substance.\\" The strip developed a devoted enough fanbase to support a steady series of paperback collections, as well as ancillary merchandise such as T-shirts. = Switch to Queen of the Universe= In 1990, Hurt abandoned the comic strip, taking an offer from United Feature Syndicate to start a new strip based on the Peaches character, Queen of the Universe.Sam Hurt, Biography ; accessed 2009.01.14. The strip was sometimes called Peaches, Queen of the Universe. Hurt's freewheeling style did not translate as well under the syndicated system, which was apparently hoping for a female Calvin character, and the latter strip was not a success. Hurt described the strip's demise as the result of \\"a printing accident... [it] drowned in a sea of red ink.\\" Some readers felt the most Eyebeam-like sequences of the strip's run came at the very end, after Hurt had gotten the cancellation notice. = After Queen of the Universe= Sam Hurt revived Eyebeam in 1995, but as a weekly. A comic book series also appeared, combining reprints with fresh material. Hurt discontinued Eyebeam for a second time in 2002, and resumed it for a third time in 2006. As of 2008, the strip appears weekly in the Austin Chronicle as well as on Hurt's website.  Story and characters  Beginning as a fairly typical \\"college life\\" strip, Eyebeam quickly mutated into something more. Besides the title character (a bemused, rail-thin lawyer and acceptor of weirdness) and the aforementioned Hank, regular characters included Eyebeam's down-to-earth but sexually voracious girlfriend Sally, and his best friend, the conical ne'er-do-well Ratliff McNubb. Secondary characters included the slacker robot IM4U, the narcissistic Rod Rutherford, Rod's lovestruck girlfriend Beth, and Eyebeam's coworker Vernon (who seemed to be missing the top of his head). Much later, Ratliff's rambunctious niece Peaches burst into the storylines, which indirectly led to the strip's demise. Style A strip showing Eyebeam in the foreground, Rod and Beth in the background, and an object that changes from panel to panel: first a vase, then a pot, then a desk lamp, then a lava lamp. Hurt's drawing style was thick and loose, and used periodically shifting backgrounds as were found in George Herriman's \\"Krazy Kat\\". A vase of flowers, for example, could be exchanged for an umbrella stand and then a fountain, without narrative explanation. The strip's logo was similarly ever-changing. Many of the strip's odder visual elements were accepted at face value, if discussed at all, such as Sally's endless jet stream of hair, Ratliff's sea-of-trash bedroom, or Ratliff's spherical automobile.  Legacy  When the Comics Journal compiled its 2000 list of the greatest comics of the century, Eyebeam received one judge's vote. Hurt remains in Austin, Texas where he does animation and sculpture.

History  They were designed as small mixed traffic locomotives, mainly used on branch lines. The design was based on the earlier 4400 Class, but with larger driving wheels and altered wheel spacing. This gave them extra speed — capable of in service. A total of 75 were built; 55 were built in four batches between 1906 and 1915 and a fifth batch of 20 locos was built in 1924, during Collett's tenure at Swindon. The first two batches were originally numbered 2161–2190 but were renumbered 4500–4529 during 1912. The first batch (2161–2180) is significant in that it was the last batch of locos built at Stafford Road Works, Wolverhampton. Of this batch 2168 (as 4507) was the last Wolverhampton-built loco to remain in service with BR, not being withdrawn until 1963. The final two batches built were nos. 4530-4554 in 1913-15 and nos. 4555-4574 in 1924. The 4575 Class was a later development with larger side tanks. =Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway and Port Talbot Railway= The Rhondda and Swansea Bay Railway (R&SBR;) had been worked by the GWR since 1 July 1906, although it was not absorbed until 1 January 1922. In April 1907, the GWR sent three new locomotives of the first batch, nos. 2165–7, to the R&SBR; these were given R&SBR; numbers 31–33. The Port Talbot Railway (PTR) was absorbed by the GWR in 1 January 1908, but its locomotive fleet remained separate until 1 January 1922. In March 1909, R&SBR; nos. 31 and 32 were transferred to the PTR, regaining their GWR numbers 2165 and 2166. These two were returned to the GWR in 1912, being renumbered 4504 and 4505 in December that year. No. 33 was not returned until January 1914, when it was renumbered 4506.  Preservation  Three of the class still exist, two of them survivors from Woodham Brothers scrapyard in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales.

The region of Iraq, which used to be Mesopotamia, has been referred to as the \\"cradle of civilization\\", and wars of conquest have been recorded in this region as far back as the third millennium BC. The area possesses strategic value, initially for the rich, fertile agricultural region in the Mesopotamian plain, and more recently for large petroleum deposits and access to the oil-rich Persian Gulf. The present territory of Iraq lacks significant strategic barriers, making it difficult to defend against foreign invasion. Ancient times *In 2525 BC, there was a battle between King Eannatum of Lagash, and Umma. The battle is recorded on the Stele of the Vultures. The king won the battle by using armored soldiers who were in phalanx formation, and also used chariots pulled by onagers. *About 2300 BC, Sargon of Akkad attacked and conquered 34 Sumerian cities, beginning the Akkadian Empire. *The Sumerians living in Iraq had to battle the Elamites from western Iran. *Kassites attacked Babylonia in the 16th century BC *About 1263 BC, the Assyrian king Shalmaneser I defeated a rebellion led by Shattuara II of Hanigalbat. *Nebuchadnezzar I (1119–1098 BC) attacked Assyria. *The Chaldeans took over Babylonia in the 9th century BC, forming the Neo- Babylonian Empire, and had to fight many revolts and aggressors. *Nebuchadrezzar II (605-562 BC) conquered Jerusalem taking 15,000 Jewish captives, who were put into exile for 70 years. (See Babylonian captivity.) *Cyrus the Great, founder of the Achaemenid Persian Empire, defeated the Neo- Babylonian Empire and conquered the region in 539-538 BC *In 331 BC, Alexander the Great defeated Darius III of Persia at the Battle of Gaugamela, east of present-day Mosul. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC. *In later centuries, starting from 190 BC, the Persians ruled Iraq for hundreds of years under different dynasties including the Parthian and Sassanid dynasties, after the first conquest in the 6th century BC. *In 627 AD, the Byzantines sacked Ctesiphon, which was invaded again in 637, this time by Muslim Arabs. The battle between 18,000 Arab tribesmen led by General Khalid ibn al-Walid (The Sword of Allah) and the Persians led by Rostam Farrokhzād, was fought at the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah, south of Baghdad. Middle Ages (634–16th century) *Muslim Arab forces led by Khalid ibn al-Walid and Sa\`d ibn Abī Waqqās conquered the area from the Sassanid Persian Empire during the Islamic conquest of Persia in the 7th century. *In 680, Hussein bin Ali, the grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, was killed in the Battle of Karbala on the day of Aashurah. *In 701, a revolt by Ibn Ash'ath was crushed by Syrian armies. *Around 747, a revolt led to the Abbasid caliphate being proclaimed in 750. The city of Baghdad was founded in 762 and became the center of the caliphate. *Baghdad was sacked during the Fourth Fitna around 811. *By 865, the Abbasid civil war (865–866) resulted in rival capitals in Samarra and Baghdad. *In 945, the Buyid people from the Caspian Sea took over Baghdad, with the Abbasid caliphs becoming puppet rulers. *Mosul was captured in 977. *In 1055, the Seljuk leader Togrul Beg overran the central area of Iraq. *The Abbasids regained control in 1135. *Baghdad repelled an attack by the Mongols in 1245 Hulagu's army attacks Baghdad *Baghdad was sacked on February 10, 1258, by Hulagu Khan following the Siege of Baghdad (1258), with between 250,000 and 800,000 people killed during the Mongol invasion. *Baghdad was sacked again in 1401 by Tamerlane. *From 1405 Turkish tribes from Anatolia took over Iraq and there was much infighting between themselves, and against local groups. The Black Sheep Turkmen at first ruled Iraq until 1466 when the White Sheep Turkmen took control. *Around 1508, Iraq was conquered by the Safavid dynasty of Iran. *1533–1534 Iraq was conquered by the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman rule (16th century–World War I) *Baghdad was put under Persian rule between 1623 and 1638, when Murad IV restored Ottoman rule and massacred many local Shiites. *In 1776, Basra was occupied by the Persians. They held it until 1779 when Karim Khan Zand's death precipitated a period of internal disorder and resulted in withdrawal from Basra. British Mandate of Mesopotamia (1918–1932) *The British invaded Iraq during World War I in the Mesopotamian Campaign. They invaded southern Mesopotamia in November 1914. The Battle of Ctesiphon was fought in November 1915. The undermanned and overstretched British forces were defeated by the Turks, who besieged the British in the city of Kut-al-Amara for 143 days in the Siege of Kut, ending with a British surrender, with 10,000 men becoming prisoners in April 1916. The British took the middle eastern campaign more seriously following this defeat, transferring command from India to the main British command, and General Frederick Stanley Maude was put in charge of British forces, leading the British to a series of victories. The battles of Mohammed Abdul Hassan, Hai and Dahra were won by the British in January 1917. In February, they recaptured Kut. On March 11, 1917, the British occupied Baghdad after the Fall of Baghdad (1917). *Between 1920 and 1922, the British put down an Iraqi revolt costing them 40 million pounds to do so. *In January 1921, the Royal Air Force's Mesopotamian Group was formed by raising Mesopotamian Wing to group status *On 1 October 1922, Mesopotamian Group was absorbed into the newly formed RAF Iraq Command which was given control of all British forces in Iraq. *Faisal I, leader of Iraq from 1921 to 1933, helped to make his country fully independent in 1932. Post-colonial monarchy (1932–1958) On 1 April 1941, Rashid Ali and four generals overthrew the pro-British Iraqi government. The British were concerned that the Axis powers might get involved in Iraq since the new government was pro-Axis. The British landed troops at Basra while Iraqi forces besieged RAF Habbaniya. On 2 May, the British launched pre- emptive air strikes against Iraqi forces. On 7 May, the Iraqis abandoned the positions above RAF Habbaniya. By about 11 May, the Iraqi Air Force was neutralized. From about 13 May, the \\"Flyer Command Iraq\\" (Fliegerführer Irak) of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) started to arrive. The aircraft of Fliegerführer Irak started to fly sorties under Iraqi colours from Mosul against the British and Commonwealth forces. For a variety of reasons, Fliegerführer Irak was able to achieve little in the way of results. British ground forces from RAF Habbaniya attacked Iraqi forces in Fallujah and, by 22 May, had withstood an Iraqi counter-attack. The British forces then attacked Baghdad, Rashid Ali and his government fled, and an armistice was signed on 31 May. The pro-British Iraqi government was restored and the Kingdom of Iraq declared war on the Axis on 17 January 1943. The Iraqi Army participated in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War against Israel. Early republic (1958–1963) The US began military aid to Iraq in 1954, and Iraq joined the pro western Baghdad Pact in 1955. A garrison in Mosul rebelled against Qassem, and Kurdish leader Barzani returned from exile in the Soviet Union to suppress them. Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait after it gained independence from Britain in 1961, but it backed down after the British sent troops to Kuwait. Iraq sent troops and planes to Jordan during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war (the Six-Day War). Ba'ath Party (1968–2003) =Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr (1968–1979)= Iraqi divisions fought in the 1973 October War against Israel. =Saddam Hussein (1979–2003)= Saddam Hussein came to power as President of Iraq in 1979. Iran–Iraq War After months of provocations and shelling of Iraqi towns and villages on the border with Iran by the newly established Ayatollah regime in Iran, Iraq responded on 22 September 1980 and achieved success in stopping the shelling of its border towns and villages. The Iran–Iraq dragged on into a long war, with between 1 and 2 million casualties. The war ended with a ceasefire on August 20, 1988 and the Iraqi military came out of it as one of the powerful military in the region. On June 7, 1981, Israeli F-15s and F-16s bombed and destroyed the Osirak nuclear reactor, south of Baghdad following the orders of Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin. On May 17, 1987, an Iraqi Mirage fighter fired two Exocet missiles at the American ship USS Stark (FFG-31), killing thirty-seven of the crew. Gulf War On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and annexed Kuwait. The United States led an international coalition which heavily bombed Iraq and freed Kuwait in 1991. After this war, sanctions were imposed on Iraq as well as a north and south no fly zones, and during the 1990s, Iraq was frequently bombed by American and British aircraft in small sorties. No-fly zones in Iraq, 1992–2003 In January 1993, the US launched a cruise missile attack against Iraq, because of it not dismantling police posts near the border with Kuwait. In June 1993, another US cruise missile attack was launched because of a suspected assassination plot against former US president George H. W. Bush. In 1996, Iraqi troops moved into northern Iraq to support the Kurdish Democratic Party against the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. The US responded with limited air attacks in the south. There were Iraqi attacks against allied aircraft in the no fly zones in January 2001, with American and British responding with bombing of targets in northern Iraq in February. Invasion of Iraq Oil filled trenches set on fire in Baghdad on April 2, by the Iraqis to try to hinder Allied air strikes The United States led a \\"coalition of the willing\\" which invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, in a war that took three weeks to get control of the country, yet the fighting lasted much longer. Baghdad was captured on April 9. Saddam Hussein was deposed, but remained in hiding until December 14, 2003, when he was captured by the US, tried by an Iraqi court, and executed in accordance with the court's death sentence. Interim government (2003–2008) Iraq rebuilt its military with the aid of countries from the Coalition of the Willing (see Military of Iraq). The effort to create a new national military was complicated by focused insurgent attacks on recruitment centers and claims of insurgents' infiltration of the new forces. Saddam Hussein was executed on December 30, 2006, after a court appointed by the interim government found him guilty of ordering the deaths of the inhabitants of an Iraqi village almost 10 years earlier.

Listed on the National Register of Historic Places. 1915 Railroad Map of Dickinson County The Abilene and Smoky Valley Railroad is a heritage railway located in Abilene, Kansas, United States. It is a non-profit organization that offers public excursion train rides May through October. The depot is located in the Historic 1887 Rock Island Depot, Old Abilene Town, south of the Dwight D. Eisenhower Presidential Library & Museum. A 1919 steam locomotive was under restoration from 2005–2008. It was first steamed up and moved under power in the fall of 2008. Starting May 23, 2009 the ex-Santa Fe 3415 became the only operational steam locomotive in the state of Kansas. The 4-6-2 Pacific locomotive hauls the train once a month. When the steam engine is not running, the regular tourist train is pulled by an ALCO S-1 locomotive that used to work for the Hutchinson Northern Railroad (HNRR). The locomotive, #4, was donated to the A&SVRR; by the HNRR when it was retired. The locomotive is a type normally used for switching and has 660 horsepower. Dinner trains are operated once a month. The trip travels along an old Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad line that used to run from Herington to Salina. Currently the train operates on approximately of trackage between Abilene and Enterprise. At Enterprise passengers are allowed to explore the caboose and locomotive. Seating in the diner or in open-sided gondola cars is available. Once a month an all-day excursion between Abilene and Woodbine is operated. At Enterprise passengers are transferred to a hyrail bus, which can travel on both road and rail. After a short tour of Enterprise the bus is placed on a second section of trackage that extends east out of Enterprise, travels through Pearl and ends in Woodbine. The trip is narrated. At Woodbine lunch is provided as part of the ticket price. After lunch the bus travels back to Enterprise with stops to showcase some of the older stone work buildings still located in the area. Upon arrival in Enterprise, the afternoon train returns to Abilene. Caboose and locomotive cab rides are available at extra charge.

Some people refer to the kata as '13 Hands', '13 Fists', '13 Techniques', '13 Steps' or even '13 killing positions'. However, these names have no historical basis. Seisan is thought to be one of the oldest kata, being quite spread among other Nahate schools. Shito-ryu has its own version similar to Sanchin and different versions are now practiced even in Shuri-te derivatives like Shotokan (called Hangetsu) and in Wado-ryu (called Seishan). Isshin-ryū also adopted this kata. This kata was adopted by Korean Tang Soo Do and is called either by its original name Sei-Shan or Seishan, or Ban Wol which is the Korean translation of Han Getsu (\\"half moon\\"). Due to its difficulty, this kata is often reserved for advanced students. Practicing styles The following styles have made this kata a formal part of their curriculum. *Chitō-ryū *Gōjū-ryū *Go-Kan-Ryu *Isshin-ryū *Isshin Kempo *Koryu Uchinadi *Meibukan *Moo Duk Kwan *Ninjutu Shito Ryu *Ryū-te *Ryūei-ryū *Seito Matsumura-ryu *Shōrin-ryū Seibukan *Shōrin-ryū Okinawa Seidokan *Shōrin-ryū *Shōrinji-ryū *Shinki-ryu *Shitō-ryū *Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo *Shotokan *Kaminohenshi-ryu karate *Tang Soo Do *Uechi-ryū *Wadō-ryū *Yoshukai Karate *Shindo-ryu Karate *Kiaido Ryu *JKF Renbukai *Ronin Kempo - Jutsu Myth and history There are numerous theories regarding the name of the kata. These include the number of steps originally in the kata, the number of different types of 'power' or 'energy' in the kata, the number of applications, or that the kata represents defence against 13 specific types of attack. The most likely explanation is the number of non-repeating techniques contained within the kata. It is believed Seisan derives from Yong Chun White Crane Boxing from Fujian Province in Southern China, where the form is known as 'Four Gate Hands'. (This is completely unproven and uncorroborated. There are some other Chinese styles having a form called 'Shisan' (13) in their curricula. According to research conducted by researcher Emanuel Giordano, the kata would derive from the Chinese form 三戰十字 San Zhan Shizi, as demonstrated in the article \\"Seisan's origins\\" https://karate-shorin-ryu- piemonte.webnode.it/news/seisans-origins/. Variations Versions of Seisan taught today have roots in Shuri-te, Naha-te and Tomari-te streams of karate (that is the karate that was traditionally taught in the Okinawan towns of Shuri, Naha and Tomari respectively). =Uechi-Ryū Seisan= This is the second of the three kata of Pangai-noon learned and then taught by Kanbun Uechi. It has obvious foundations in Sanchin, relying primarily on the \\"Sanchin stance\\" or and opening as does Uechi-Ryū Sanchin for three strikes then later returning to these strikes near the end of the kata. Compared with other versions of the kata, Uechi-Ryū's is very different. The kata introduces some of the basic techniques such as knee strikes, the one-knuckle punch , spearhand , and the front kick which were then incorporated in the \\"bridging\\" kata created by Kanbun Uechi's son and senior students between Sanchin and Seisan. In modern Uechi-Ryū, it is the fifth kata learned and the one tested for the first \\"black belt\\" or grade. =Isshin-Ryū Seisan= Isshin-Ryū traditionally teaches this kata as the first one to be learned in their curriculum, unlike other styles. As is a feature of the style, all punches are performed with a vertical fist. The founder's primary teacher of the kata was Chotoku Kyan of the Shorin-Ryū style, but the Isshin-ryu version also shares many features with the Goju-Ryū style, including tension and breathing techniques. =Goju-Ryū Seisan= The Goju-Ryū (Naha-te) version of the kata is a more complicated version that contains close range fighting techniques such as short-range punches, low kicks, and directional changes to unbalance the opponent. It contains techniques performed under full tension through the range of motion, as well as strong fast techniques. Seisan is said to complement Seiunchin. Although rooted in the same form, significant differences can be seen in the Goju version compared to the other versions mentioned above. =Seibukan Shorin-Ryū Seisan= The version of Seisan taught in the Seibukan Shorin-Ryū syllabus can be traced back to Sōkon 'Bushi' Matsumura (a highly influential teacher to Shorin styles, hence the name Matsumura-no-Seisan). The form predominantly features the stance Shiko-Dachi (common in Tomari-te kata) accompanying a block which often sets up a powerful pivot and punch into Zenkutsu-dachi. This form introduces many recurring concepts used in higher level Seibukan Shorin-Ryu kata. =Okinawa Seidokan Shorin-Ryū Seisan= Very closely resembling the Seibukan Shorin-Ryū Seisan from the same lineage the Okinawa Seidokan system traditionally teaches Matsumura-no-Seisan as the first kata in their curriculum. Though not considered a basic kata, the Okinawa Seidokan version is foundational in teaching koshi (trunkial twist power) from a beginners onset. The use of the , , and serve to build up the legs of the practitioner for low travel and centered transitioning. Traditionally the regular performance is performed to a regular counting cadence maintaining the same tempo throughout the kata. However, Okinawa Seidokan also teaches a slowed down version where every count performs breathing similar to Goju-Ryū's Sanchin kata where breathing in and out is timed upon every outward movement. This slower version is called 'Seisan Breath' and taught to higher level students to develop internal martial arts. This kata is considered a gateway kata to understanding applications of many Shorin-Ryū kata following in the system. =Shotokan Hangetsu= Hangetsu contains many slow movements under tension, popular in Naha-te schools such as Goju-Ryū, but rare in Shotokan and Shuri-te influenced styles making the kata quite unique. Funakoshi was taught by Sokon Matsumura (Shuri-te), Kodatsu Iha (a student of Kosaku Matsumora of Tomari-te) and Seisho Aragaki (associated with Goju-Ryū) all of which had knowledge of a version of Seisan. Funakoshi's could have taken the best from these contrasting styles synthesising them into Hangetsu, which possibly explains why the form is so different from other kata in the Shotokan canon. =Aragaki no Seisan= 100px Another more obscure version of this kata known as Aragaki- no-Seisan, bears the closest surface resemblance to the Shotokan kata Hangetsu. The Shotokan version was probably renamed when Gichin Funakoshi formed his school in Japan. Hangetsu translates to 'Half Moon' or 'Half Month' a reference to the half-moon stance used extensively and the semi-circular stepping actions in this kata. The name Seisan could have been a reference to the 13-day cycle of the moon's phases, and knowing this Funakoshi named the kata 'Half Moon/Month'. A more obscure and unlikely theory is that the kata was taken from a Chinese folk dance where the performer is explaining the importance of the tides as they cycle on 13-day intervals as the moon revolves around the earth.

Administrative parts The municipality comprises the villages Benkov, Brníčko, Dětřichov, Dolní Sukolom, Horní Sukolom, Nová Dědina, Renoty and Střelice. History Uničov is one of the seven royal Moravian towns. It was founded around 1213 by the Margrave Vladislaus III, the brother of the Přemyslid king Ottokar I of Bohemia. Uničov has the oldest city chart in the Czech Republic, it received Magdeburg rights in 1223 and was granted further privileges by Ottokar's successor King Wenceslaus I in the year 1234. After the devastations during the 1241 Mongol invasion of Europe, the Olomouc bishop Bruno von Schauenburg had the area redeveloped by German craftspeopleand tradesmen descending from Schaumburg Land in the course of the Ostsiedlung. In 1422 Hussite forces under Sigismund Korybut laid siege to the town, which upon the accession of the Hussite king George of Poděbrady in 1458 became a centre of the new confession until it fell to his rival Matthias Corvinus in 1479. A part of the Habsburg Monarchy from 1526, Uničov upon the 1620 Battle of White Mountain for participating in the Bohemian rebellion was divested of its privileges by Emperor Ferdinand II and made a subject of the Austrian House of Liechtenstein, a verdict that however was overruled a few years later. The citizens nevertheless suffered severeley in the Thirty Years' War, when in 1642 the town was occupied by Swedish troops. After the Seven Years' War, Emperor Joseph II met here with the Prussian king Frederick the Great in 1770, a rapprochement of the former enemies that would lead to the First Partition of Poland two years later. After World War II the remaining German population was expelled, many of the citizens fled to Limburg and Naumburg in Hesse.

Known for most of its length as Maryland Highway, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 219 (US 219) in Oakland in Garrett County east to US 220 in McCoole in Allegany County. MD 135 is the main link between the towns of Oakland, Mountain Lake Park, Loch Lynn Heights, and Deer Park on the Appalachian Plateau and the communities of Bloomington, Luke, Westernport, and McCoole in the upper valley of the North Branch Potomac River. These groups of towns are separated by Backbone Mountain. MD 135 was originally built in the early 1930s as a link between McCoole and Westernport. In the late 1930s, the state highway was extended west to Bloomington. In addition, a separate segment of MD 135 was completed around Swanton in the mid-1930s. These separate segments were unified in the early 1950s when the highway over Backbone Mountain was completed. In the late 1950s, MD 135 was extended west over a portion of MD 38 and all of Maryland Route 41 to Oakland, and was mostly rebuilt over its entire length, bypassing Bloomington, Swanton, Deer Park, and Mountain Lake Park. MD 135 remains notorious for the eastbound descent from Backbone Mountain, which has claimed many lives. The Maryland State Highway Administration has instituted many measures to get trucks down the mountain safely and to avoid the downgrade if possible. Route description MD 135 begins at an intersection with US 219 on the eastern edge of Oakland. Northbound US 219 (Oak Street) continues straight west into downtown Oakland, southbound US 219 (Garrett Highway) heads south toward Red House, and 9th Street (unsigned MD 219) heads north along the alignment of the future Oakland Bypass. MD 135 heads east through Mountain Lake Park as Maryland Highway, a controlled access two-lane undivided highway. Oakland Drive, which is unsigned MD 825B, splits to the northeast to serve residential areas on the north side of town. The old alignment rejoins MD 135 at G Street before access controls cease upon crossing the Little Youghiogheny River. The state highway intersects MD 560 (Paull Street), which heads south into Loch Lynn Heights. After crossing the river again, MD 135 leaves Mountain Lake Park. The state highway passes scattered residences, farms, and businesses before entering Deer Park. After passing Deer Park Hotel Road, which passes the Pennington Cottage, MD 135 intersects the old alignment of MD 38, which is Sand Flat Road to the north and Main Street to the south. The state highway passes the historic home Glamorgan and Edgewood Drive, part of the old alignment of MD 38, before leaving Deer Park. Upon reaching the hamlet of Altamont, MD 495 (Swanton Road) continues straight northeast toward Swanton while MD 135 turns to the southeast. MD 135 westbound in Luke MD 135 heads straight southeast toward a grade-separated crossing of CSX's Mountain Subdivision very close to the railroad's crossing of the Eastern Continental Divide. The state highway curves to the northeast and gently ascends Backbone Mountain. A scenic overlook marks the highest point on MD 135 () shortly before the intersection with MD 38 (Kitzmiller Road). The state highway continues northeast along the ridgeline through Potomac-Garrett State Forest and intersects Swanton Road and a few roads on the south side of the highway that access Jennings Randolph Lake. Upon leaving the state forest, MD 135 begins to pass scattered residences ahead of the descent of Backbone Mountain, which has grades as steep as 9%. Trucks are required to stop at three different brake check locations and obey a posted speed limit of . After Bloomington Hill Road splits to the north and the state highway passes the third brake check stop, a runaway truck ramp splits to the south. The downhill grade eases as MD 135 enters Bloomington, where the name of the highway changes to Bloomington Road. After passing through residential areas, the state highway crosses the Mountain Subdivision and the Savage River before meeting Savage Hillside Road at a T intersection in front of Franklin Hill. View west from the east end of MD 135 at US 220 in McCoole MD 135 turns southeast into Allegany County and enters the town of Luke as Pratt Street. The state highway immediately intersects Masteller Road, which is unsigned MD 135D and meets the eastern end of the western segment of West Virginia Route 46 (WV 46) at the North Branch Potomac River. At a bend in the river, MD 135 makes a sharp turn to the north around the mountain and the road passes the large NewPage Corporation paper mill. The state highway turns east and its name changes to Church Street upon entering Westernport, where the highway intersects MD 36 (New Georges Creek Road), which crosses the North Branch Potomac River to become the eastern segment of WV 46. MD 135 crosses Georges Creek and meets the Georges Creek Railway at-grade before intersecting Main Street, which is unsigned MD 937. Upon leaving Westernport, the road's name changes to McCoole-Westernport Road. MD 135 parallels the North Branch Potomac River and Georges Creek Railway as it passes scattered residences and businesses. Upon reaching McCoole, the highway passes unsigned MD 135A, which provides an alternate access route to US 220 north. Shortly after, MD 135 reaches Paxton Street, which is officially MD 135B but is marked as MD 135. Paxton Street leads to a junction with US 220 (McMullen Highway). MD 135 itself continues east under the McCoole-Keyser bridge to its eastern terminus at the intersection of Queens Point Road and Golden Cross Street. History The present course of MD 135 consists of the original course of the state highway and its extensions westward, and assumption of a portion of MD 38 and all of MD 41. MD 135 also followed a segment of what is today MD 495. The original segment of MD 135 was under construction between McCoole and Westernport in 1930 and completed by 1931. The state highway was constructed between Bloomington and Luke in 1936 and 1937, including the bridge over the Savage River. This segment was connected to Westernport in 1940 by carving a roadbed out of the cliffs of Franklin Hill. MD 38 was paved from its original northern terminus to Altamont between 1924 and 1926 and to the top of Backbone Mountain by 1930. The present segment of MD 38 south to Kitzmiller was under construction by 1930 and completed by 1933. MD 41 included the first section of what is now MD 135 to be constructed; the segment of the state highway between Oakland and Mountain Lake Park was paved between 1916 and 1919. The state highway was extended past Loch Lynn Heights in 1933 and to MD 38 in Deer Park by 1938. A second, disconnected segment of MD 135 was constructed in two sections between MD 38 in Altamont and Swanton that were completed in 1933 and 1935. This road was extended east to the top of Backbone Mountain in 1939. The discontinuous segments of MD 135 were unified in 1953 when the pre-existing Bloomington Road was reconstructed between the eastern end of the western MD 135 on top of Backbone Mountain and the western end of the eastern MD 135 in Bloomington. When the present US 220 bridge over the Potomac River was completed in 1951, MD 135 was extended east from its old intersection with US 220, which is today the intersection with MD 135A, to its present eastern terminus. MD 135 attained its present alignment through several projects in the mid to late 1950s, concurrent with MD 135's extension west over part of MD 38 and all of MD 41 to Oakland in 1956. The segment of MD 38 in Deer Park was bypassed by the newly extended state highway in 1956. The state highway between McCoole and Westernport was relocated, and Bloomington Hill Road was bypassed with a straighter highway featuring a grade-separated crossing of the railroad in Bloomington in 1956 and 1957. The present section of MD 135 between MD 38 and Swanton Road was built in 1955 and 1956; MD 135 was then removed through Swanton and partially replaced by MD 495. The segment between Swanton Road and Bloomington Hill Road was upgraded between 1953 and 1956. Finally, the portion of MD 135 between Deer Park and Oakland, including the bypass of Mountain Lake Park, was rebuilt between 1957 and 1959. Since the present alignment of MD 135 was completed west of Bloomington in the late 1950s, the descent of Backbone Mountain has become notorious due to its steep grade and the 90 degree turn at the bottom to avoid a mountain dead ahead. A retaining wall at the bottom of the mountain features white crosses in memoriam of those who lost their lives; there were 24 crosses painted as of 2009. After five people had been killed on the descent by 1965, the State Roads Commission responded in 1967 by enacting the truck speed limit of , marking the three mandatory stopping areas, and installing ample warning signage, including the infamous \\"If Brakes Fail Ditch Truck Immediately\\" sign. In 1997, signs were installed on Interstate 68, US 219, and US 40 advising truckers to use MD 36 instead of MD 135 to access Luke and Westernport. The runaway truck ramp was installed by 2005 and supplemented with a runaway truck warning system and updated signage in 2007.

Borsodi - \\"Az élet habos oldala\\" - \\"The frothy side of life\\" History Construction of a 22,000 m² brewery began in 1969 in the village of Bőcs, Hungary. The brewery began producing beer in 1973 with initial production of 874,000 hl. In 1991 after the fall of communism, the brewery was privatized and in 1993 it was purchased by the Belgian Interbrew (now InBev). The purchase of the brewery led to significant improvements in several aspects of brewing including higher quality, use of improved technology, and better product development. Although the company has been under foreign ownership since 1993, it still produces a line of Hungarian beers in addition to some foreign beers brewed under license. At the Borsodi Sörgyár Rt. plant in Böcs, northern Hungary, another brewery with a capacity of 370 million liters per year for Ft 1.5 billion was put into operation in March 2005. The plant produces about 33% more beer than the old one. The huge boilers and vats imported from Korea are able to manage 28 tons of raw material at once. The process consumes 10% less energy. In mid October 2009, private equity fund CVC Capital Partners bought all of Anheuser–Busch InBev's holdings in Central Europe (including Borsod) for €2.23 billion. They renamed the operations StarBev.Apatinska pivara prodata CVC-u, B92, October 15, 2009 In 2012, the StarBev Group was taken over by Molson Coors Brewing Company,https://web.archive.org/web/20120826011111/http://invest- iq.net/2012/04/cvc-starbev-sale/ an American-Canadian brewing company which is the fifth biggest brewer in the world. Borsodi is a market leader in Hungary. During the socialist period, all breweries in Hungary had defined regions, where they operated. There was no competition between the breweries for local markets. Borsodi was in charge of the eastern part of Hungary and supplied this market. After the privatization process in the early 1990s, all breweries became competitors as they fought for the largest possible share of the Hungarian market. Borsodi managed to remain competitive and strengthened its position on the Hungarian beer market by offering beer drinkers a wide range of brands. The brewery’s main brand is “Borsodi Sör”. In order to maintain and improve the market position, the company is using marketing communication activities: The brewery regularly participates in the organization and sponsorship of various sports and music events. Borsodi collaborates with the university of Miskloc for market research projects. The university also has a post-graduate program in which Borsodi’s staff is trained. The brewery is also collaborating with the Food and Agricultural University Herteszeti Egyetem located in Budapest, which trains food engineers. The Borsodi Búza is made from wheat Beers Borsodi beer As of October 2005, Borsodi Sörgyár produces 5 kinds of Hungarian beer. The beers are well known throughout Hungary. *Borsodi Sör (4.6% alcohol, pale lager) – The flagship of the brewery and best-selling beer brand in Hungary is a traditional golden-colored light beer. *Borsodi Bivaly (6.5% alcohol, Hungarian lager) – Introduced in 2004 as a stronger (both in taste and alcohol content) light-colored beer. *Borsodi Barna (6.7% alcohol, dark German style) *Borsodi Póló (0.5% alcohol, non- alcoholic beer) – A light, non-alcoholic beer introduced in 1996. *Borostyán (5.2% alcohol, amber) – A premium beer introduced in 2003 using a unique roasted malt which gives it an amber color, and a mildly bitter taste. *Borsodi Super Dry (4% alcohol) Borsodi Sörgyár also produces Beck's and Stella Artois under license. In addition to the beers it brews on site, Borsodi Sörgyár sells and distributes Belle-vue Kriek, Hoegaarden, Leffe, and Staropramen in Hungary.

The game's primary features are its ability to simulate actual racing physics, online play, and support for the addition of third party content via plug-ins. The combination of these features have attracted numerous players and led to the creation of a seasonal racing league. Redline also has several modes of gameplay for those who prefer arcade style physics commonly found in other racing games. The game is now currently obsolete and an error message will be displayed upon opening the application as of OS X Snow Leopard and above. However, a fan-made patch allows the game to run on OS X Mavericks and above, but in single-player modes only. Gameplay Players may race in one of four modes: Time Trial, Quick Race, Challenge, or Multiplayer. In all of these modes, except for Challenge, the player may choose the track, their car, the weather, forward or reverse orientation, and the physics mode to race under. The modes available are: Simulation, Strict, Arcade, and Turbo Arcade. In Simulation, every car handles differently based on weight, drivetrain, horsepower, suspension setup, and other variables. Strict is a derivative of the Simulation mode, that was added in a later update that adjusts how car-scenery collisions are handled to help reduce the effectiveness of the \\"wall riding\\" technique. Arcade sacrifices realism for playability. Cars in Arcade differ less in performance than they do in Simulation or Strict. Turbo Arcade has the same physics as Arcade, but all cars much faster than normal, resulting in the least realistic method of play. Screenshot of Redline's gameplay The main modes of gameplay are Quick Race and Multiplayer, the former a single player race between the player and up to eleven Artificial intelligence opponents, the latter a race of up to twelve human or A.I. racers over the internet. The host of the game chooses the track, weather, physics mode, and number of laps to be raced. Any cars a player has unlocked in the Challenge mode can be used, even if other players in the game have not unlocked them. However, if the host chooses, they can force all players to use the same car. Additionally, only plug-in cars and tracks that are had by all players may be used. If a player chooses a car or track which other players do not have, an error message is displayed and the race can not be started. In the Time Trial mode, the player attempts to get the fastest lap time possible. They are able to compete locally on the host machine with stored scores and worldwide via an online time tracker. Times are submitted to the time tracker when a lap is completed and the rank, if any, of the time is returned. To simulate a rolling start, the player is placed some distance away from the starting line, allowing them to begin the first lap at the same speed as a normal race lap (versus Redline's usual standing start). Challenge mode presents the player with specific car and track combinations, and a set of rules for completion. Some challenges require getting from start to finish under a certain time limit, and others call for avoiding obstacles that will disqualify the player if they are touched. Players are graded by how fast they complete the challenges with bronze, silver, or gold medals. Fast completion times can unlock new cars for use in any of the other modes. Additionally, like Time Trial, the player can compete for best times locally and worldwide. Redline Racing League The Redline Racing League (RRL) is a multi-race Simulation tournament (the Summer 2007 season was 20 races) held over the course of about 3 months. Three seasons of RRL have been held so far, and the last one, in the summer of 2007, attracted more than 30 racers from all over the globe. Third party content Several user-made cars racing on a user-made track. Redline has a now-inactive community of dedicated third party developers who once constantly released new cars, tracks, weather settings, challenges, and other plug-ins for the game. As of February 24, 2011, there are over 450 cars and tracks available for download. Reception Redline has received positive reviews from critics, including an 8/10 from Inside Mac Games. The game was praised for its accurate simulation of realistic physics as well as including arcade style physics. Macworld noted its multiple game modes, open architecture, and multiplayer, among other things.

It is located in Seattle, Washington and owned by Cascade Designs. History MSR began as a newsletter in 1969 that covered topics around mountaineering safety. In 1973, Larry Penberthy (1916–2001) developed the MSR Model 9 camp stove, a design which was relatively efficient in cold weather. He separated the stove burner from then small fuel tanks, and then pressurized auxiliary fuel bottles as the tank, and used a better wind screen. He also designed an ice axe that was supposed to dig into the ice better and stop a slide. Penberthy also introduced metal-shafted ice axes; metal axes have replaced earlier wooden-shaft designs. The company was acquired by REI in 1981. In 2000, MSR merged with Edgeworks, the manufacturer of Moss, Walrus and Armadillo tents.

It is situated along the river Nore in the north of the county. It is located in the province of Leinster in the south-east of the island of Ireland. Ballyragget situated on the N77 north of Kilkenny and had a population of 1,082 people as of the 2016 census.  Toponymy  The name 'Ragget' is Anglo-Norman in origin, and denotes a once-prominent Norman landowner Richard le Ragget who held these lands in the early part of the 13th century. Older names of the settlement include Donoughmore (or Donaghmore; \\"large church\\") and the even more ancient Tullabarry () - the name of a Celtic or possibly pre-Celtic tribe which held their seat in the vicinity. There is some debate as to the meaning of Donoughmore. The very first issue of the Journal of the Kilkenny Archaeological Society (January 1948), which has an article about Ballyragget and its environs, states a belief that Domhnach Mór means \\"big Sunday\\" and relates to the fact that thousands of people congregated at the now ruined church in Donoughmore for its opening on a Sunday and the name stuck. History The settlement of Ballyragget originally formed at a fording-point on the River Nore at this location. Originally named after the 13th century Anglo-Norman landowner Richard le Ragget, Ballyragget was later held by Mountgarret family. The town is dominated by a large medieval keep (known as Ballyragget Castle) and its adjoining walls. This tower dates to the late 15th century , and contains a late 16th century inscribed stone which commemorates Edmund Butler, 2nd Viscount Mountgarret. Much of the town streetscape was laid out around the town's square in the mid-17th century. A large mid 19th-century Catholic church sits on a rise overlooking the town's central square.  Geography  The River Nore flows beside the town, which nestles in a wide alluvial valley between the Attanagh Plateau and several hills to the east, including 'Knockmannon' and 'The Balla boys'. The Nore passes by one of the most significant ancient sites in North Kilkenny south of Ballyragget at Rathbeagh. The statistical Ballyragget Geographical Area is recorded by the CSO as containing . To the north lies the town of Durrow in County Laois, to the south the River Nore flows on towards Kilkenny City. The town is located in the townland of the same name which is in the civil parish of Donoghmore in the ancient barony of Fassadinin. Demographics Statistics available from the Central Statistics Office of Ireland show that Ballyragget's population had increased by over 30% in the 20 years between the 1996 census and the 2016 census (from 803 to 1,082 inhabitants). For the electoral division which surrounds the town, the population was 1,451 persons as of the 2006 census. The majority of residents in Ballyragget are nominally Roman Catholic, although there are minority Protestant and non-religious populations. The Square, Ballyragget Economy Agriculture and the Agri-Food industry are the largest employers, with the large Glanbia factory across the river dominating the town's industry for the past forty years. The plant at Ballyragget is the largest multi-purpose integrated dairy plant in Europe, and Glanbia plc can trace its roots to the Avonmore co-operative founded in Ballyragget in the 1960s. A percentage of the area's residents commute to work (or education) some distance from the town.  Politics  At national level, Ballyragget, as part of the Carlow–Kilkenny constituency, is represented by five Teachtaí Dála in Dáil Éireann. At a local level, the town is within the administrative area of Kilkenny County Council. Ballyragget is also a Local Electoral Area of County Kilkenny and includes the electoral divisions of Attanagh, Balleen, Ballyconra, Ballyragget, Baunmore, Castlecomer, Clogh, Clogharinka, Clomantagh, Coolcraheen, Freshford, Galmoy, Glashare, Johnstown, Kilkieran, Kilmacar, Lisdowney, Moneenroe, Mothell, Muckalee, Odagh, Rathbeagh, Rathcoole, , Tiscoffin, Tubbridbrittain and Urlingford.

Like Corythosaurus, it had a tall, hollow rounded crest, although not as large and straight. It is known from the remains of two species that spanned 75 to 67 million years ago, in the Late Cretaceous of Alberta, Canada, and Montana, United States, and is the latest hollow-crested duckbill known from good remains in North America. It was an obscure genus until the discovery in the 1990s of nests, eggs, and hatchlings belonging to H. stebingeri. Discovery and history H. altispinus skull and neck The type remains of Hypacrosaurus remains were collected in 1910 by Barnum Brown for the American Museum of Natural History. The remains, a partial postcranial skeleton consisting of several vertebrae and a partial pelvis (AMNH 5204), came from along the Red Deer River near Tolman Ferry, Alberta, Canada, from rocks of what is now known as the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (early Maastrichtian, Upper Cretaceous). Brown described these remains, in combination with other postcranial bones, in 1913 as a new genus that he considered to be like Saurolophus. No skull was known at this time, but two skulls were soon discovered and described. During this period, the remains of small hollow-crested duckbills were described as their own genera and species. The first of these that figure into the history of Hypacrosaurus was Cheneosaurus tolmanensis, based on a skull and assorted limb bones, vertebrae, and pelvic bones from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. Not long after, Richard Swann Lull and Nelda Wright identified an American Museum of Natural History skeleton (AMNH 5461) from the Two Medicine Formation of Montana as a specimen of Procheneosaurus. These and other taxa were accepted as valid genera until the 1970s, when Peter Dodson showed that it was more likely that the \\"cheneosaurs\\" were the juveniles of other established lambeosaurines. Although he was mostly concerned with the earlier, Dinosaur Park Formation genera Corythosaurus and Lambeosaurus, he suggested that Cheneosaurus would turn out to be composed of juvenile individuals of the contemporaneous Hypacrosaurus altispinus. This idea has become accepted, although not formally tested. The Two Medicine Procheneosaurus, meanwhile, was not quite like the other Procheneosaurus specimens studied by Dodson, and for good reason: it was much more like a species that would not be named until 1994, H. stebingeri. =Species= H. stebingeri holotype skull H. altispinus, the type species, is known from 5 to 10 articulated skulls with some associated skeletal remains, from juvenile to adult individuals found in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. H. stebingeri is known from an unknown but substantial number of individuals, with an age range of embryos to adults. The hypothesis that H. altispinus and H. stebingeri form a natural group excluding other known hadrosaur species may be incorrect, as noted in Suzuki et al.'s 2004 redescription of Nipponosaurus; their phylogenetic analysis found that Nipposaurus was more closely related to H. altispinus than H. stebingeri was to H. altispinus. This was rejected by Evans and Reisz (2007), though. The new species Hypacrosaurus stebingeri was named for a variety of remains, including hatchlings with associated eggs and nests, found near the top of the late Campanian (Upper Cretaceous) Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana, and across the border in Alberta. These represent \\"the largest collection of baby skeletal material of any single species of hadrosaur known\\". Description Life restoration of H. altispinus Hypacrosaurus is most easily distinguished from other hollow- crested duckbills (lambeosaurines) by its tall neural spines and the form of its crest. The neural spines, which project from the top of the vertebrae, are 5 to 7 times the height of the body of their respective vertebrae in the back, which would have given it a tall back in profile. The skull's hollow crest is like that of Corythosaurus, but is more pointed along its top, not as tall, wider side to side, and has a small bony point at the rear. Unlike other lambeosaurines, the passages for the airways do not form an S-curve in the crest (at least not in H. altispinus). The animal is estimated to have been around long, and to have weighed up to 4.0 tonnes (4.4 tons). As with most duckbills, its skeleton is otherwise not particularly remarkable, although some pelvic details are distinctive. Like other duckbills, it was a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore. The two known species, H. altispinus and H. stebingeri, are not differentiated in the typical method, of unique characteristics, as H. stebingeri was described as transitional between the earlier Lambeosaurus and later Hypacrosaurus. Photographs of an adult H. stebingeri skull show an animal that looks very similar to H. altispinus. Classification Hypacrosaurus was a lambeosaurine hadrosaurid, and has been recognized as such since the description of its skull. Within the Lambeosaurinae, it is closest to Lambeosaurus and Corythosaurus, with Jack Horner and Phil Currie (1994) suggesting that H. stebingeri is transitional between Lambeosaurus and H. altispinus, and Michael K. Brett-Surman (1989) suggesting that Hypacrosaurus and Corythosaurus are the same genus. These genera, particularly Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus, are regarded as the \\"helmeted\\" or \\"hooded\\" branch of the lambeosaurines, and the clade they form is sometimes informally designated Lambeosaurini. Although Suzuki et al.'s 2004 redescription of Nipponosaurus found a close relationship between Nipponosaurus and Hypacrosaurus stebingeri, indicating that Hypacrosaurus may be paraphyletic, this was rejected in a later, more comprehensive reanalysis of lambeosaurines, which found the two species of Hypacrosaurus to form a clade without Nipponosaurus, with Corythosaurus and Olorotitan being the closest relatives. Size comparison between the two species and a human The following cladogram illustrating the relationships of Hypacrosaurus and its close relatives was recovered in a 2012 phylogenetic analysis by Albert Prieto-Márquez, Luis M. Chiappe and Shantanu H. Joshi. Paleobiology H. stebingeri nest As a hadrosaurid, Hypacrosaurus would have been a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating a variety of plants. Its skull permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing, and its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Its feeding range would have extended from the ground to about above. =Nests and growth= Juvenile H. altispinus, American Museum of Natural History. Hypacrosaurus stebingeri laid roughly spherical eggs of , with embryos long. Hatchlings were around long. Studies of lines of growth (i.e. lines of von Ebner) in the teeth of embryonic H. stebingeri suggests plesiomorphically long incubation times, with a minimum incubation time of 171.4 days for H. stebingeri. Young and embryonic individuals had deep skulls with only slight expansion in the bones that would one day form the crest. Growth was faster than that of an alligator and comparable to ratite growth, for several years, based on the amount of bone growth seen between lines of arrested growth (analogous to growth rings in trees). Research by Lisa Cooper and colleagues on H. stebingeri indicates that this animal may have reached reproductive maturity at the age of 2 to 3 years, and reached full size at about 10 to 12 years old. The circumference of the thigh bone at postulated reproductive maturity was about 40% that of its circumference at full size. The postulated growth rate of H. stebingeri outpaces those of tyrannosaurids (predators of hypacrosaurs) such as Albertosaurus and Tyrannosaurus; rapidly growing hypacrosaurs would have had a better chance to reach a size large enough to be of defensive value, and beginning reproduction at an early age would also have been advantageous to a prey animal. Secondary cartilage has been found in the skull of a hatchling specimen of H. stebingeri. =Crest functions= H. altispinus skull, AMNH The hollow crest of Hypacrosaurus most likely had social functions, such as a visual signal allowing individuals to identify sex or species, and providing a resonating chamber for making noises. The crest and its associated nasal passages have also figured in the debate about dinosaur endothermy, specifically in discussions about nasal turbinates. Turbinates are thin bones or cartilages that come in two types, with two functions. Nasal olfactory turbinates are found in all living tetrapods and function in smell. Respiratory turbinates function to prevent water loss through evaporation and are found only in birds and mammals, modern endotherms (warm-blooded animals) who could lose a great deal of water while breathing because they breathe more often than comparably sized ectotherms (cold-blooded animals) to support their higher metabolism.Chinsamy, Anusuya; and Hillenius, Willem J. (2004). \\"Physiology of nonavian dinosaurs\\". The Dinosauria, 2nd. 643-659. Ruben and others in 1996 concluded that respiratory turbinates were probably not present in Nanotyrannus, Ornithomimus or Hypacrosaurus based on CT scanning, thus there was no evidence that those animals were warm-blooded. =Paleopathology= The discovery of tooth marks in the fibula of a Hypacrosaurus specimen inflicted by a bite from the teeth of a tyrannosaurid indicated that this, and other hadrosaurids were either preyed upon or scavenged by large theropod dinosaurs during the Late Cretaceous period. =Thermoregulation= Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio from the bones from different parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An endothermic (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold- blooded) physiology.Martin, A.J. (2006). Introduction to the Study of Dinosaurs. Second Edition. Oxford, Blackwell Publishing. 560 pp. . Oxygen- isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was endothermic.Barrick, R. E., Showers, W. J. and Fischer, A. G. 1996. Comparison of thermoregulation of four ornithischian dinosaurs and a varanid lizard from the Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation: Evidence from oxygen isotopes. Palaios 11: 295–305. This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above). Paleoecology =Taphonomy= The large, monospecific assemblage of Hypacrosaurus stebingeri in Montana was interpreted as a group of dinosaurs that was killed by a volcanic ashfall. This assemblage is considered autochthonous, meaning that the remains are thought to have been buried on or near the same spot where the individuals died. The variety of ages in this group supports that this was a biocoenosis—an actual life assemblage of animals.Behrensmeyer, A. K. 1991. Terrestrial vertebrate accumulations. In Allison P. A. and Briggs D. E. G. (Eds), Taphonomy: Releasing the Data Locked in the Fossil Record. New York: Plenum Press. The cause of death in a volcanic ashfall is suffocation by the ash and by the gases released from volcanic eruptions. The preservation of this diverse group of dinosaurs provides researchers with a growth series, which is a sequence of growth stages from juvenile to adult. =Environment= Hypacrosaurus sp. skeleton exhibited in the National Museum of Nature and Science, Tokyo, Japan. H. altispinus shared the Horseshoe Canyon Formation with fellow hadrosaurids Edmontosaurus and Saurolophus, hypsilophodont Parksosaurus, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus, nodosaurid Edmontonia, horned dinosaurs Montanoceratops, Anchiceratops, Arrhinoceratops, and Pachyrhinosaurus, pachycephalosaurid Stegoceras, ostrich-mimics Ornithomimus and Struthiomimus, a variety of poorly known small theropods including troodontids and dromaeosaurids, and the tyrannosaurs Albertosaurus and Daspletosaurus. The dinosaurs from this formation are sometimes known as Edmontonian, after a land mammal age, and are distinct from those in the formations above and below. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. H. altispinus may have preferred to stay more landward. The slightly older Two Medicine Formation, home to H. stebingeri, was also populated by another well-known nesting hadrosaur, Maiasaura, as well as the troodontid Troodon, which is also known from nesting traces. The tyrannosaurid Daspletosaurus, caenagnathid Chirostenotes, dromaeosaurids Bambiraptor and Saurornitholestes, armored dinosaurs Edmontonia, Oohkotokia, and Scolosaurus, hypsilophodont Orodromeus, hadrosaur Prosaurolophus, and horned dinosaurs Achelousaurus, Brachyceratops, Einiosaurus, and Rubeosaurus were also present. This formation was more distant from the Western Interior Seaway, higher and drier, with a more terrestrial influence.

He studied in Venice, Italy under the direction of A. Nazari (violin) and F. G. Bertoni (composition). Beginning in 1780, he was concertmaster with the orchestra at the Teatro di S. Samuele and eventually became the orchestral director at the Teatro di S. Benedetto. After his tenure at the Teatro di S. Samuele in 1805, he became orchestral director and a professor in the conservatory at S. Maria Maggiore in Bergamo, Italy. Although popular in his day, most of his music is now forgotten. The most commonly performed piece today is his concerto for double bass. The concerto was found in the British Museum, and was dedicated to Kavalier Marcantonio Montenigo, who is assumed to have performed on that instrument. An arrangement of the second (andante) and third (rondo) movements of the concerto is also performed on tuba, euphonium, and trombone. In addition Philip Catelinet arranged all three movements of the concerto for concert band and symphony orchestra. He performed it several times during his tenure at the Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, PA. His students also performed this piece. The parts may be obtained from Barry Catelinet. Several of Capuzzi's string quintets are also performed by chamber groups. He was also a prolific composer of ballets that took place between acts of plays and operas. The most famous ballet was La villageoise, performed in London in 1796. His other known works include 5 operas, 11 ballets, 4 violin concertos, 18 string quartets, and other chamber music.

Etymology  The word podunk is of Algonquian origin. It denoted both the Podunk people and marshy locations, particularly the people's winter village site on the border of present-day East Hartford and South Windsor, Connecticut.Lacy, John. 1982. \\"If this is Podunk, it is truly nowhere\\", Hartford Courant, May 30, pg. E6. Podunk was first defined in an American national dictionary in 1934, as an imaginary small town considered typical of placid dullness and lack of contact with the progress of the world.Shea, Jim. 2007. “Proud to be Podunk!” Hartford Courant, Jan 22. The earliest citation in the Dictionary of American Regional English is from Samuel Griswold Goodrich's 1840 book The Politician of Podunk: :Solomon Waxtend was a shoemaker of Podunk, a small village of New York some forty years ago. The book portrays Waxtend as being drawn by his interest in public affairs into becoming a representative in the General Assembly, finding himself unsuited to the role, and returning to his trade. It is unclear whether the author intended to evoke more than the place near Ulysses, New York by the name \\"Podunk\\". Possibly the term was meant to exemplify \\"plain, honest people\\", as opposed to more sophisticated people with questionable values. An 1875 description said: :Sometimes the newest State, or the youngest county or town of a State is nicknamed \\"Old Podunk,\\" or whatever it may be, by its affectionate inhabitants, as though their home was an ancient figure in national history. In American discourse, the term podunk came into general colloquial use through the wide national readership of the \\"Letters from Podunk\\" of 1846, in the Daily National Pilot of Buffalo, New York. These represented \\"Podunk\\" as a real place but one insignificant and out of the way.Read, Allen 1939 \\"The Rationale of Podunk.\\" American Speech 14(2): 99-108. The term gained currency as standing for a fictional place. For instance, in 1869, Mark Twain wrote the article \\"Mr. Beecher and the Clergy,\\" defending his friend Thomas K. Beecher, whose preaching had come under criticism. In it, he said: : They even know it in Podunk, wherever that may be. It excited a two- line paragraph there. At the time he was living in Buffalo, moving to Hartford, Connecticut in 1871, in a home within of the Podunk River. Elmira, where Twain had lived earlier, is within of Podunk, New York, so it is not clear to which village Twain was referring.

They have released two albums. History Originally inspired by bands like Dr. Feelgood and The Modern Lovers, their later material gives a heady nod in the direction of Krautrock and sees an increasing complexity in their music combining elements of funk and rock and roll. Mother and the Addicts released their debut single \\"Who Art You Girls?\\" in December 2004, followed by \\"Oh yeah, You Look Quite Nice\\" in July 2005 and their debut album, Take The Lovers Home Tonight in August 2005. Their next single a double a side \\"Watch the Lines/Are Other?\\" was released in August 2007. The band have toured extensively along with the likes of Sons and Daughters and the 1990s. Though meeting at the Glasgow School of Art only two of the original members, Douglas Morland and Kendall Koppe attended. All of the current lineup come from Glasgow with the exception of Mother who was brought up in the Orkney Islands. Kendall Koppe left the band in 2005 to pursue a career in photography. Through 2006 the band played a handful of shows including the Indian Summer Festival and the GSA degree show as a four- piece. During this period Mother wrote the majority of the material for Science Fiction Illustrated, and the album was recorded over the winter and completed in January 2007. They have been actively touring since May 2007 being joined live by Timothy Dyer on Keyboards and samples. Musical style The band's sound includes elements of \\"white funk\\", disco, krautrock and pub rock, and has seen them compared to the likes of Franz Ferdinand, Dr. Feelgood, The Violent Femmes, and Roxy Music, while Mother's songwriting and singing have been compared to Mark E. Smith and Jarvis Cocker. Break Up On 17 July 2008, the band announced on their website that they had disbanded.

They spoke the Siouan Tutelo-Saponi language, which was related to the languages of the Tutelo, Occaneechi, Monacan, Manahoac and other eastern Siouan peoples. Since the mid-20th century, certain groups in the Southeast have organized to assert their American Indian cultural identity; some claim descent from the historic Sappony. Among them are the Haliwa-Saponi, and the Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation of North Carolina, who took names referring to the historic tribe; and the Indians of Person County (known as the Sappony since 2003). Other Saponi bands are located in Ohio, Georgia and Texas. None of these organizations have federal recognition as a tribe, which grants to tribes the right to certain benefits and requires documentation as regulated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Etymology The Saponi, allegedly, gain their name from a specific tribe among them, known as the Sapon.http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nc-american-indians/7283 While their language is extinct, it can be assumed that the correct translation of Sapon is 'black,' as the Lakota word is Sapa. However, there is a precedent in Siouan language to contract words into each other to make a name, so the use of Sapon as the name of a tribe may have actually been meant to mean 'Blackfoot,' hence the title Eastern Blackfoot. In Lakota, this is Si- sapa.Buechel, Eugene & Manhart S.J., Paul \\"Lakota Dictionary: Lakota-English / English-Lakota, New Comprehensive Edition\\" 2002. Pre-Revolutionary history In their oral history, they claim to have migrated from Ohio to Virginia, chasing out a rival nation known as the Doeg.http://www.saponi- ohio.org/8001.html It is believed that the Doeg may be the same as either the Powhatan, or the Nanticoke. While this isn't much to go on, this mirrors the oral histories of most other Siouan-speaking peoples. Most experts agree with the claims of the Dhegihan Sioux (Osage, Omaha, Ponca, Quapaw, Kaw) tribes.http://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/28545/1/Rankin%20Presentation.pdf It was possibly invasions of Iroquoian people who chased them out. Early 20th- century anthropologist John R. Swanton agreed with James Mooney, Hale, Bushnell and other scholars that the Sappony were probably the same as the Monasuccapanough, a Virginia people mentioned in 1608 by John Smith as tributary to the Monacan. Their main village as described then is believed to have been in the vicinity of present-day Charlottesville, Virginia. The first known contact between a European explorer and the Sappony was in 1670, when John Lederer found their village on the Staunton River at Otter Creek, southwest of present-day Lynchburg, Virginia. In 1671 Thomas Batts and Robert Fallam led an expedition that passed through the same village, as well as a second in Long Island in the Stauton River between present-day Campbell County, Virginia. Here settlers during Bacon's Rebellion in 1676 murdered the friendly Sappony, as well as the closely related Occaneechi, without justification. The colonists were retaliating for raids conducted by the unrelated Doeg tribe. Nearly decimated, the Sappony relocated to three islands at the confluence of the Dan and Staunton rivers in Clarksville with their allies, the Occaneechi, Tutelo, and Nahyssans. By 1701, the Sappony and allied tribes, often collectively referred to as \\"Saponi\\" or \\"Tutelo,\\" had begun moving to the location of present-day Salisbury, North Carolina to gain distance from the colonial frontier. By 1711 they were just east of the Roanoke River and west of modern Windsor, North Carolina. In 1714, Governor Spotswood resettled them around Fort Christanna in Virginia.Swanton, p. 72 The tribes agreed to this for protection from hostile tribes. Although in 1718 the House of Burgesses voted to abandon the fort and school, the Siouan tribes continued to stay in that area for some time. They gradually moved away in small groups over the years 1730–1750. One record from 1728 indicated that Colonel William Byrd II made a survey of the border between Virginia and North Carolina, guided by Ned Bearskin, a Sappony hunter. Byrd noted several abandoned fields of corn, indicating serious disturbance among the local tribes. In 1740, the majority of the Saponi and Tutelo moved to Shamokin, Pennsylvania. They surrendered to the Iroquois and joined the latter in New York. They were formally adopted by the Cayuga Nation in 1753. Smaller bands were noted in Pennsylvania as late as 1778. Some were still in North Carolina much later.Swanton p. 73 Since most of the Iroquois sided with the British in the American Revolutionary War, after the victory by the United States, the Sappony and Tutelo who had joined the Iroquois were forced with them into exile in Canada. After that point, recorded history was silent about the tribe. Language According to William Byrd II, the Sappony spoke the same language as the Siouan Occaneechi and the Steganaki (also known as Stuckenock). It was probably the same as that spoken by the Meipontsky, a minor tribe \\"...mentioned only in the report of the Albany conference of 1722. ... \\" By the time linguistic data was recorded, these related eastern Siouan tribes had settled together at Fort Christanna in Brunswick County, Virginia, where the colonists sometimes referred to them as the Christanna Indians. Horatio Hale recorded the Tutelo language in considerable detail. In the 21st century, his work is being used by the Occaneechi as the basis for the revival of the Tutelo-Occaneechi language, also called Yésah. The Sappony dialect is known from only two sources. One is a word list of 46 terms and phrases recorded by John Fontaine at Fort Christanna in 1716. This contains a number of items showing it to be virtually the same language as recorded by Hale.G. Oliverio, Tutelo Grammar and Dictionary, 1996. The other source is William Byrd II's History of the Dividing Line betwixt Virginia and North Carolina (1728), in which he recorded the names of some local creeks. Byrd's scant list has been found to have included several names from unrelated Indian tribes. Culture Very little of Saponi culture has been recorded. Catawba Texts, written by Frank G. Speck in 1934, about the closely related Catawba people to the south, gives some indications of cultural practices and beliefs held in common with both the Catawba and neighboring tribes of other language groupings, such as the Cherokee.Speck, Frank G. Catawba Texts 1934. The book mentions a story of a giant, blood-sucking snake that was killed by a giant eagle. This mirrors other Siouan stories of Thunderbirds facing off against evil snake monsters.Walker, James R. & Jahner, Elaine A. \\"Lakota Myth (Second Edition)\\" 2006. Catawba Texts also includes practical instructions such as methods of making pottery, baskets and traps, various ways of fishing, instructions on how to make hominy and cornbread, and how to tan hides and make soap. After the American Revolution Like other Native Americans in interaction with other peoples, the Sappony intermarried. In some of the early Spanish and Portuguese colonies, mulatto meant mixed-race African and Native American, but under the English tradition, it came to mean persons of European and African ancestry.Jack D. Forbes, \\"The Use of Racial and Ethnic Terms in America: Management by Manipulation\\", Wicazo SA Review, Fall 1995, vol. XI, No. 2 Because of slavery society, some whites in slave state areas tended to classify anyone of visible African ancestry as African, even mixed-race people who identified and lived culturally as Native American. But in other parts of the South, race was considered a more fluid concept, with mixed-race people being classified as \\"white\\", \\"Indian\\", \\"negro\\", \\"mulatto\\", or sometimes even \\"Mexican\\", as the situation suited them. In Maryland, the Catholic Church kept records that recognized its Indian parishioners identifying as Native American; these have helped some descendants prove continuity of communities. Because South Carolina taxed American Indian slaves at a lesser rate than African slaves as early as 1719, that colony had legislated that \\"all such slaves as are not entirely Indian shall be accounted as negro.\\"Forbes p. 55. After the legal decision in Hudgins v. Wright in 1808, Virginia tended to classify persons of mixed Native American and African ancestry as 'Negroes', a decision that favored slaveholders after Indian slavery was ended. Colonial and early United States governments generally failed to recognize how people identified culturally. The problem grew more severe at the turn of the 19th century, resulting in records that are biased toward classifying all free people of color as African American, when some identified culturally and by descent as members of specific Native American tribes. There have been many academic disagreements about the cultural identity of numerous people recorded simply as free blacks or free people of color.Jack D. Forbes, \\"The Use of Racial and Ethnic Terms in America: Management by Manipulation\\", Wicazo SA Review, Fall 1995, vol. XI, No. 2, pp. 55, 58-59. Pages 58 and 59: Quote: \\"In 1857, a William Chavers was charged \\"as a free person of color\\" with carrying a shotgun. Chavers was able to win his case eventually ... because he is charged as \\"a free person of color\\" whereas ... the act ... makes it penal for any \\"free negro\\" to carry arms ... Free persons of color maybe ... persons colored by Indian blood. The indictment cannot be sustained.\\" Jack Forbes has noted that the terms \\"mustees\\" and \\"mulattoes\\" at one time referred to persons of part American [Indian] ancestry. A mustee may have been primarily part- African and American [Indian], and a mulatto was usually part-European and American [Indian], but the latter term particularly was used more generally to refer to mixed-race people of African American and European ancestry. At the time, the federal censuses had no classification for American Indian, and did not ask people with which culture they identified. Paul Heinegg and Virginia DeMarce have found that a high percentage of people identified as \\"free blacks\\" or \\"free people of color\\" in federal censuses from 1790–1810 (when there was no designation for Indian) in the Upper South were descended from families classified as free African Americans in colonial Virginia. Most were free because they were descended from unions between white women (who were free) and African or African-American men. Their children and descendants maintained this free status. At the time, most working-class people shared living and working quarters. These families were documented through extensive research in colonial records of Virginia and the Chesapeake Bay Colony, including court records, land deeds, wills and manumissions. Some free African Americans were descended from enslaved Africans freed by owners as early as the mid-17th century. By the early decades of the 19th century, such free families had many descendants; they often moved to frontier areas where racial strictures were reduced.Paul Heinegg, Free African Americans in Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware, 1999–2005 In some areas, the lighter-skinned descendants formed close communities in which they called themselves or were known as Indian, Portuguese or one of a variety of terms, such as Melungeon. In some cases, descendants married more into one or another of their ancestral communities, becoming increasingly white, black or Indian. Issues about identity became more confusing under Jim Crow in the late 19th century as white Democrats imposed racial segregation to enforce white supremacy. In the 20th century, as both North Carolina and Virginia adopted one-drop rules as part of their racial segregation laws, requiring all individuals to be classified as either white or black (essentially, all other or all people of color). They classified as black any person with any black ancestry, regardless of how small. Walter Ashby Plecker, the Registrar of Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics, issued orders to field offices to change birth records of individuals whose families he had decided were trying to pass as Indian to avoid being classified as black. Due to his application of the Racial Integrity Act, records of many Native American-identified people were changed without their consent, and often without their knowledge. In later years, their descendants have had difficulty in proving their communities' continuity of identity.  State-recognized tribes  Three groups, each recognized by the state of North Carolina, claim descent from the historical Sappony. The people known as the \\"Indians of Person County\\" were recognized by North Carolina in 1911 as an American Indian tribe. In 2003 they formally changed their name to Sappony. The Haliwa-Saponi, a group based chiefly in Halifax and Warren counties, is another Native American band formally recognized by North Carolina in 1965. They organized that year under the name Haliwanash Indian Club. They changed their name in 1979 to include a reference to the historic Sappony. This group attracted media attention for claiming its tribal council had reviewed and approved a loan for $700,000 and a $600,000 HUD grant for matching funds. The North Carolina Auditors became involved at that time.Costly mistake\\", The Daily Heraldaudit report\\", North Carolina Auditor The Occaneechi Band of the Saponi Nation was recognized by the state of North Carolina in 2002, after being organized in 1984 as the Eno- Occaneechi Indian Association. In 1995 it added Saponi to its name.Occaneechi Saponi timeline\\", Occaneechi Saponi Both the Indians of Person County/Sappony and the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe of North Carolina were at one time classified by some anthropologists as among groups known as tri-racial isolates. Members were observed to have (or claimed) European, African and Native American ancestry, to varying degree. Some such groups settled and created communities in frontier and border areas of the southern states, where there was initially a lower level of development of plantations. These two communities each stressed cultural identification with historic American Indians. Their applications for recognition as American Indian tribes were approved by the state of North Carolina in 1911 and 1965, respectively.  Other Tribes & Organizations  Ohio is home to the second-largest population of people claiming Saponi ancestry; the Ohio Saponi community was established by migrants from Halifax, Warren, Orange, Alamance, Granville, and Robeson counties of North Carolina (and bordering counties in Virginia). These families migrated to the Midwest in response to a period of intensified violent oppression of free people of color in the South that extended from approximately 1810 to 1860. This period of oppression was codified in a set of legislative acts that included federal laws such as the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which set off a period of attempted violent removals of Native Americans from the entirety of the Southeast that resulted in at least 19,000 deaths on the Trail of Tears, as well as state laws such as the North Carolina Constitution of 1835, which removed the right of free Native Americans and African-Americans to vote; and the Act Concerning Slaves and Free Persons of Color (1855), which restricted the residencies and movement of free Native Americans or African-Americans, and also prohibited them from serving as witnesses in courts of law. The Haliwa-Saponi Tribal History describes the cause of the migration as follows: \\"In 1835 North Carolina amended its constitution and barred people of color from voting and participating in the government. Many Haliwa-Saponi families reacted by migrating to areas north and west such as Chillicothe, Ohio, which had more favorable laws for non- white peoples. Other families chose to continue their lives in the Meadows.\\" http://www.haliwa-saponi.com/a-brief-haliwa-saponi-tribal-history/ Scholar and Director of the Haliwa-Saponi Historic Legacy Project, Dr. Marty Richardson further writes, \\"A large group of Meadows Indians migrated to Ohio after 1835 and took advantage of fewer race-based restrictions. Their migration provided more economic opportunities, education, freedom of movement, and inspired Civil War military service as part of the U.S. Colored Troops. Those who stayed in the Meadows faced another challenge in 1865, after the end of the Civil War and emancipation. They developed social and religious institutions to maintain their distinct identity as Natives, while also exercising rights as Americans. Using institutions such as landownership, family, the military, and church, Meadows Indians debated the consequences of these changes and how they could keep their core identity markers alive.\\" (pg 26, Chapter 1) https://cdr.lib.unc.edu/concern/dissertations/8c97kq961?locale=en In the present day, members of midwestern Saponi communities are dispersed across multiple counties in Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. Members generally belong to one of three self-organized tribes based in Ohio; the largest of these is the Saponi Nation of Ohio. In 1998, the Saponi Nation of Ohio submitted a letter of intent to Petition for Federal Acknowledgement of Existence as an Indian Tribe to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In addition, the Carmel Indians of Carmel, Ohio; and a group in Magoffin County, Kentucky claim descent from the historic Sappony tribe. THE MIXED-BLOOD RACIAL STRAIN OF CARMEL, OHIO, AND MAGOFFIN COUNTY, KENTUCKY by EDWARD T.

They were signed with Artemis Records before being dropped from the label in 2003. The band released two EPs and three full-length albums before disbanding in 2010. History =Early years= Crossbreed was formed in 1996 as a four-man band consisting of James Rietz, Chris Nemzek, Charlie Parker & Travis Simpkins. A year later they added keyboardist Jason Troph who left in 1998 to front the Orlando-based band Irrational. He was replaced by Phil \\"Flip\\" Marquardt. Their self-produced album .01 was released in 1998 with only 1,000 copies made; the album featured a cover version of \\"Wicked Game\\" by Chris Isaak. In 1999, Dan \\"DJ\\" Izzo (then under the moniker \\"D.J. Balistick\\") joined the band as their Turntablist/2nd Keyboardist. It was at this time that he began developing their stage show using black lights and glow paint, which helped bring the band to the attention of the music industry. =2000–2005= On April 29, 2000 Crossbreed played Tampa's 98Rock's radio festival, Livestock, where they met the girls from the band Kittie. They gave them a copy of their Babydoll EP, which found its way to the A & R Rep for Kittie's former label Artemis. Crossbreed was signed to Artemis by the end of the year and their debut album, Synthetic Division was released nationally on May 8, 2001. Their first single, \\"Underlined\\", debuted on MTV2 & MTVX. The video for that song was nominated for a Billboard Music Award. In the summer of 2001 they toured the U.S. and Canada with the German band Rammstein and did a short run with Static-X. Synthetic Division has sold to date a total of over 100,000 copies. In what would be a sign for the future, bassist Charlie Parker left the band after a show on April 20, 2002. Crossbreed then parted ways with their label in 2003 and after a show with Orgy on May 2, 2004, bassist Bishop, keyboardist \\"Flip\\", and drummer Simpkins left the band as well. Later that year, Izzo would also leave the band. James Rietz & Chris Nemzek chose to continue and re-form the band with new members. =2005–2010= With a new line-up and manager (Bill Aucoin, former manager of Kiss), Crossbreed spent their time writing new material and doing shows in Florida, including opening for Orgy, Mushroomhead, and Mindless Self Indulgence. On July 25, 2005 they released their self- produced EP New Slave Nation and toured the Midwest with Mushroomhead and Dope on the \\"Music for Freedom\\" Tour. The following spring, they went out with Nothingface and Silent Civilian for a brief time before dropping off the tour due to conflict. Since that time they have toured again with Mushroomhead as well as alone throughout the Eastern U.S. As of May 14, 2008, it was noted on Subkulture's Myspace Blog that Kem Secksdiin was co-writing and performing numerous songs on the upcoming Crossbreed album. In July 2008, Crossbreed opened up their own audio-visual recording studio. Dubbed \\"The Candy Factory\\", the studio was located in the warehouse district of Downtown Clearwater, Florida and served as the studio where Crossbreed's new record KE 101 was recorded. In June 2008, Crossbreed signed with \\"Driven Music Group\\", the new label of ex-Korn guitarist, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch. According to the band's MySpace, KE 101 was scheduled to be released in late spring/early summer 2009 via Ryko distribution, but due to the company going under, they decided to sign with Crash Music, an affiliate of Driven Music Group. Due to this and several other issues, KE 101 was released on September 15, 2009. Crossbreed played their last show on December 17, 2010 at The State Theatre in St. Petersburg, Florida. =Hiatus and other projects= Frontman James Rietz released this statement on the band's hiatus: \\"I will start out with nothing is official cause nothing stays gone, but, as of now, Crossbreed and its members will be moving on to other projects. We have had a great run, but after all these years, some of us have never had a chance to expand beyond Crossbreed. Personally, Chris and I (James) have been doing this group on paper for 14 years and have never had a chance to do anything else. As some of you might know, we have our studio which will be running as usual, but there has to be a point where some journeys end to begin new ones. Now, I’m not saying there will never be another Crossbreed show, I’m only saying that Crossbreed will no longer be the primary focus any longer for our members.\\" Members of Crossbreed James Rietz and Ian Hall teamed up with Tamara Kemp to form a band called \\"Shu-Tang\\". They released their first EP \\"Drink Til You're Hott\\" on March 1, 2011. On September 2012, they released a video for the song \\"Dance Like A Zombie\\". Kem Secksdiin released solo album called [eMerGe-n- EvoLve] on January 12, 2010. The album features guest appearances from Crossbreed's singer James Breed on the song \\"Night (Replace The day)\\" and F@mu$ (aka Famus, also known for work with XXX Car Ride) for the song \\"rEZuRekdEAD\\".

OTA's purpose was to provide Congressional members and committees with objective and authoritative analysis of the complex scientific and technical issues of the late 20th century, i.e. technology assessment. It was a leader in practicing and encouraging delivery of public services in innovative and inexpensive ways, including early involvement in the distribution of government documents through electronic publishing. Its model was widely copied around the world. The OTA was dismantled in 1995, following the 1994 mid-term elections which led to Republican control of the Senate and the House. Republican legislators characterized the OTA as wasteful and hostile to GOP interests. Princeton University hosts The OTA Legacy site, which holds \\"the complete collection of OTA publications along with additional materials that illuminate the history and impact of the agency\\". On July 23, 2008 the Federation of American Scientists launched a similar archive that includes interviews and additional documents about OTA. History Congress established the Office of Technology Assessment with the Technology Assessment Act of 1972. (HTML version) It was governed by a twelve-member board, comprising six members of Congress from each party — half from the Senate and half from the House of Representatives. During its twenty-four-year life it produced about 750 studies on a wide range of topics, including acid rain, health care, global climate change, and polygraphs. =Closure= Criticism of the agency was fueled by Fat City, a 1980 book by Washington Times journalist Donald Lambro that was regarded favorably by the Reagan administration; it called OTA an \\"unnecessary agency\\" that duplicated government work done elsewhere. OTA was abolished (technically \\"de-funded\\") in the \\"Contract with America\\" period of Newt Gingrich's Republican ascendancy in Congress. According to Science magazine, \\"some Republican lawmakers came to view [the OTA] as duplicative, wasteful, and biased against their party.\\" When the 104th Congress withdrew funding for OTA, it had a full-time staff of 143 people and an annual budget of $21.9 million. The Office of Technology Assessment closed on September 29, 1995. The move was criticized at the time, including by Republican representative Amo Houghton, who commented at the time of OTA’s defunding that \\"we are cutting off one of the most important arms of Congress when we cut off unbiased knowledge about science and technology\\".Nader proposes reviving Congressional Office of Technology Assessment Critics of the closure saw it as an example of politics overriding science, and a variety of scientists have called for the agency's reinstatement. Law professor and legal scholar David L. Faigman also made a strong case supporting the role OTA had played, also calling for its reinstatement. =Subsequent developments= While the OTA was closed down, the idea of technology assessment survived, in particular in Europe. The European Parliamentary Technology Assessment (EPTA) network coordinates members of technology assessment units working for various European governments. The US Government Accountability Office has meanwhile established a TA unit, taking on former duties of the OTA. While campaigning in the 2008 US presidential election, Hillary Clinton pledged to work to restore the OTA if elected President. Text of Clinton's speech to the Carnegie Institution. On April 29, 2009, House of Representatives member Rush Holt of New Jersey wrote an op-ed piece articulating the argument for restoring the OTA. In April 2010 The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars released a report entitled \\"Reinventing Technology Assessment\\" that emphasized citizen engagement and called for performing the functions of the OTA by creating a nationwide network of non-partisan policy research organizations, universities, and science museums: the Expert & Citizen Assessment of Science & Technology (ECAST) network. ECAST would conduct both expert and participatory technology assessments for Congress and other clients. The author of the report was Dr. Richard Sclove of the Loka Institute. The report states that the drive to modernize OTA was initiated by Darlene Cavalier, a popular citizen science advocate and author of the Science Cheerleader blog. Cavalier outlined the idea of the citizen network in a guest blog post for Discover Magazine's The Intersection. She introduced the concept in an article in Science Progress in July 2008. Andrew Yang became the first 2020 presidential candidate on April 4, 2019 to push for the idea to reestablish the OTA.https://twitter.com/AndrewYang/status/1113862421830090752 He did so with a detailed proposal that includes refusing to sign any budget that doesn't include the OTA.https://www.yang2020.com/policies/reviveota/  See also  References Further reading * Bruce Bimber: Politics of Expertise in Congress: The Rise and Fall of the Office of Technology Assessment, State University of New York Press, 1996. * Peter D.

It has been built by analysing significant social factors and population behaviour to provide precise information and improved understanding of the different types of people and communities across the UK. Acorn segments households, postcodes and neighbourhoods into 6 categories, 18 groups and 62 types. The Acorn structure  Methodology  In March 2013 CACI launched the latest version of Acorn, although the necessary data from the 2011 census was not available for the whole of the UK. Instead, the current version of Acorn was created with a new approach to geodemographics. It does not rely on census data,Taking leave of the Census but takes advantage of the new data environment created by government policies on Open data and the availability of a number of brand new private sector datasets. Peter Sleight, Chair of Association of Census Distributors, considered Acorn's new version a sufficient improvement to have \\"revolutionised geodemographics\\". At The Census & Geodemographics Group'sThe Census and Geodemographics Group decennial conference, Tracking a Decade of Changing Britain,Tracking a Decade of Changing Britain CACI presented a paper on why it had chosen to eschew Census data and how it had gone about developing a new way of creating a demographic segmentation. Traditionally (since the 1970s), all geodemographic segmentations and classifications were built in broadly the same way.OAC Methodology A good example of this is the Output Area Classification (OAC). The first OAC was developed in 2005 by the University of Leeds in cooperation with the UK Office for National Statistics' (ONS). It is a free and open geodemographic segmentation based on the 2001 UK Census. Currently, at University College London, the OAC is being rebuilt using the 2011 UK Census. In the traditional approach census and lifestyle data is fed through statistical software to perform a multi-variate segmentation. The resulting segmentation is analysed, named and described. The most significant aspects of this \\"traditional\\" approach are that: # The same statistical process builds the definition of how to describe communities and allocates local areas (postcode or household) to these types. # Every local area is classified using the same data variables. # Every local area is classified using the same statistical algorithm. The problem with this approach is that housing built after the census cannot be classified primarily because of the requirement to always use the same data and the same algorithm and so, by definition, census data does not and cannot be applied to newly built housing. Furthermore, lifestyle data does not apply either as it takes time to build up a pool of information from new residents. Similarly, data gleaned from things like credit applications can be highly inaccurate if the new housing is a redevelopment of previous housing, since the bulk of information in these traditional data sources can apply to residents of housing that has been demolished. Having developed its own statistical technique to classify such housing, CACI refrained from the traditional method and developed new approaches for postcodes in other circumstances, starting by separating the definition of the types that describe the population from the assignment of postcodes to the types, allowing them to be assigned by use of many different algorithms. The general principle is to use appropriate data and specific algorithms to give the best segmentation. Examples include age limited housing, newly built social and private housing, manual allocations, student accommodation, etc.  New Data Environment  This new approach is better suited to the new data environment as increasingly more local information is being published as Open Data and more is available from commercial sources. The first benefit of the new approach is that any future data that becomes available can be incorporated into the segmentation process, thereby bringing about improved updating intended to ‘future-proof’ the solution, since new censuses are not conducted every year. The second benefit is that it is not essential to have data for all of the United Kingdom. If the Acorn solution can be improved for only part of the country without losing anything elsewhere, then it is clearly advantageous to do so. With devolved government, a great deal of Open Data is released covering only England, only Scotland, only Wales, etc. The traditional approach could not use this data since it required the same data for every postcode, but the new approach can.

Background  As a kid in South Dakota, he took accordion lessons and discovered guitar when he saw the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. He attended the University of South Dakota but switched to the Berklee College of Music in 1976. He took private lessons from Jerry Bergonzi and Charlie Banacos. He moved to New York City in 1988 where he became an active member of the jazz community, producing many recordings as a sideman and leader. He is one of the few electric guitarists in the world to use the computer program SuperCollider in both his compositions and improvisations. Arnold is a founding member of Spooky Actions, a jazz group which explores improvisation using classical music repertoire. He has played with Stuart Hamm, Peter Erskine, Joe Pass, Joe Lovano, Lenny Pickett, Randy Brecker, Stanley Clarke, the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and the Absolute Ensemble under the baton of Kristjan Järvi. Arnold's recording credits include over twenty albums and DVDs (on Muse-eek Records, Mel Bay Recordings, Truefire and other labels), ranging from standard jazz repertoire to free improvisation to reinterpretations of classical music. Teaching and writing He is the director of Guitar Studies at New York University and Princeton University as well as the creator of the New York University Summer Guitar Intensive. He has taught at the New England Conservatory, Dartmouth College, Berklee, New School University, and City College of New York.

It pertains to the features of the cervix and the uterine isthmus. It is demonstrated as a softening in the consistency of the uterus, and the uterus and cervix seem to be two separate regions. The sign is usually present from 4–6 weeks until the 12th week of pregnancy. Hegar's sign is more difficult to recognize in multiparous women. Interpretation: On bimanual examination (two fingers in the anterior fornix and two fingers below the uterus per abdomen), the abdominal and vaginal fingers seem to oppose below the body of uterus (examination must be gentle to avoid abortion). This sign was repeatedly demonstrated and described by Ernst Ludwig Alfred Hegar, a German gynecologist, in 1895.

Muddiman was born in the Strand, London. He was educated in St Clement's Temple and at St John's College, Cambridge, after which he worked as a school teacher. He began producing two regular newsbooks - Parliamentary Intelligencer and Mercurius Publicus - in late 1659 on the proceedings of the newly reconvened Rump Parliament. This seems to have been at the suggestion of George Monck, who also received good publicity. On 16 April 1660 this role was secured when all other such journals were banned particularly those of Marchamont Needham the chief Cromwellian publisher. Muddiman received a monopoly of print along with arch-royalist John Birkenhead as a supervising editor. Muddiman lost the right to publish the journals three years later when it was handed to Roger L'Estrange. He would transform the subtle propaganda of the newsbooks into heavy-handed political polemics leading to the rights being returned to Muddiman in 1665. By that time, Muddiman had established a good business distributing hand-written details of parliamentary proceedings which he was not allowed to print. Once the rights were returned he began publishing the London Gazette which remains the oldest surviving English newspaper. With a short hiatus over the Exclusion crisis, when there were attempts to suppress all publications, he retained exclusive rights until the Glorious Revolution of 1688. At the change of regime he was considered too close to the previous incumbents and retired, dying in 1692.

It was designated a National Heritage Site in 2005. The temple was influential in the promotion of Candomblé and in distancing the religion from Catholicism under the leadership of High Priestess Olga de Alaketu in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. History The oral tradition maintained by the temple claims that the temple was founded in 1636 by a princess brought from the Yoruba Kingdom of Ketu, in present-day Republic of Benin. Otherwise the historical account tells us that surrounding areas of the Royal City of Ketu was raided by Dahomean army only in 1789, when possibly they captured some royals who were sold to slave- traders. Ile Maroia Laji's tradition corroborates this account, providing a succession of seven leaders to the temple since its foundation that hardly couldn't cover the claimed 350 years of its existence. The temple's account tells that nine years old twin sisters princesses captured in Ketu by Dahomean army and were sold to slave-traders and sent to Salvador, Bahia. The twins belonged to the Aro or Ọja Aro Clan, and their namer were Otampe Oja-Aro (or Ojaro) and Gogorixá. They were miraculously freed when they just arrived in Salvador. Whenceforth they worked for nine years as food sellers and maidservants in order to buy a ticket to get back to their homeland. Otampe Ojaro, initiated to the orisha Oxumarê (the serpent-rainbow), back in Dahomey, married a cousin called Alaji, and gave birth to a daughter called Akobi-Odé. The family went to Salvador and achieved a farm in the neighborhood of Matatu de Brotas, where they made a shrine to orisha Oxossi, the family's mythical ancestor. And named the shrine Ilé Ọmọ-Aro Alají (House of Alaji, son of Aro[Clan]), abbreviated as Ile Moroialaji or Maroialaji and nowadays recorded as Ile Maroia Laji. The shrine became a temple where Otampe Ojaro was the high-priestess. The couple adopted Brazilian Portuguese names: Otampe Ojaro became Maria do Rosário Régis, Alaji was Porfírio Régis and Akobi-Odé was Maria Francisca Régis, their chosen family name, Régis, meaning \\"regal\\", \\"from the kings\\". After Otampe Ojaro death the leadership passed to her daughter Akobi-Odé/Maria Francisca Régis. The later's last will is the oldest document preserved in the temple examined by the anthropologist Vivaldo da Costa Lima, and dates from 1867. Akobi-Odé left the high-priesthood to her grandson,or son, if Akobi-Odé is the same Chiquinha Odé Akobi, recorded by the oral tradition as José Gonçalo's mother and immediate antecessor. Silveira, Renato (2003) José Gonçalo Régis (Babá Aboré), initiated to the orisha Oshala. José's niece, Dionísia Francisca Régis (Obá Oindá), initiated to orisha Xangô, succeeded him in the late 19th century. After a long period in the leadership, Mother Dionísia died in 1948, and left her grand-niece, Olga Francisca Régis (Oiá-funmi), a 23 years old young woman initiated to the orisha Oya-Iansan, in the leadership of the temple. So then the temple, also known as Terreiro do Alaketu, reminding the leading family origins, gain national and international-wide notoriety, and the new high priestess, nicknamed Olga de Alaketu, became an important figure in the Candomblé, ruling over her temple and respective community with her strong personality over 57 years, passing away victimized by diabetes on 28 September 2005 just after the old temple's official recognition as National (Brazilian) Heritage by the Ministry of Culture. Mother Olga's successor is her eldest daughter, Jocelina Barbosa Bispo, Mother Jojó, initiated to Nanã Buruku. References *Lima, Vivaldo da Costa.

Bleecker holds a Ph.D. from the History of Consciousness Program at University of California, Santa Cruz. He's been an artist-in-residence at Eyebeam, exhibited work at Ars Electronica, a Research Fellow at the Annenberg Center for Communication and an Assistant Professor at the USC Interactive Media Division. He now works as an interaction designer at Nokia Design (Los Angeles). Bleecker has been active as a researcher in the areas of mobile computing, pervasive networks and near-field interaction systems. In 2006, with Nicolas Nova, he organized a workshop entitled \\"Networked Objects\\" at [EPFL  Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne], held in May 2006, exploring his interest in Near-Field Interaction and the Internet of Things. This vector of research on mobile computing, pervasive networks and near-field or proximity-based interaction systems has been a theme of Bleecker's research and design projects for a number of years. One of his earlier projects in this area was PDPal (2003–2005), a series of technology project that investigated how mobile devices could be integrated into a system to allow people to annotate the experiences they have, as in a location-specific diary. The PDPal series was commissioned by Eyebeam in New York City, and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis to find ways for creating art-technology projects that made use of readily available mobile devices, such as PDAs and mobile phones. PDPal was a collaborative project with designers Marina Zurkow and Scott Patterson. Other more exploratory projects looked at ways to use common technologies, such as WiFi, in unexpected ways. WiFi.Bedouin and WiFi.ArtCache were two projects that use wireless communications networks to create local networks that make digital content available in very location-specific ways. WiFi.ArtCache was invited for exhibition at ISEA 2006 in San Jose, California, and was the winner of the Audience Choice Award. It was also commissioned for exhibition at the group show \\"Reclaim the Spectrum\\" in Seville, Spain (2006). More playful commissioned art-technology projects include \\"Pussy Weevil\\", an animated, sensor-based, screen-based character, which was selected for exhibition at Ars Electronica (2005), the Museum of the Moving Image in New York City (2003–2004), and Art Interactive in Boston (2003). Bleecker was lead technologist on the Sonic Memorial Project, a Peabody Award-winning website and radio documentary based on audio recollections of the events of September 11.

This is a description by himself: \\"My real name is Giovanni Luigi Brera. I was born on 8 September 1919 in San Zenone Po in the province of Pavia, and grew up like a wild man among woods, river banks and still waters. [...] I am a Padan from the banks and flood plains, the bush and the sandbanks. I soon realized I was a legitimate son of the Po\\". Biography The Lakefront Gianni Brera in Bosisio Parini, Italy Brera was born in San Zenone al Po, near Pavia, the son of Carlo, a tailor, and Marietta Ghisoni. Among his ancestors was a Hungarian great-grandmother who married a Lombard sergeant of the Imperial Austrian Army. He obtained his degree in Political Sciences at Pavia University in 1943, while on leave from his post as Lieutenant of the paratrooper division \\"Folgore\\". In late spring 1944 he joined the Italian Resistance movement and fought in the Ossola Valley. He took pride in having lived through World War II without ever shooting another human being. In 1943 he married Rina Gramegna (a teacher, 1920–2000) and had four sons: Franco (1944-1944), Carlo (a painter, 1946–1994), Paolo (an economist, journalist, multi-lingual translator, and novelist, 1949-2019), Franco (a musician, 1951-). When he was discharged in 1945, he started working for La Gazzetta dello Sport (Italy's first sports daily), eventually becoming Editor-in-Chief in 1949, the youngest-ever Editor- in-Chief of a national newspaper in Italy. Brera wrote for La Gazzetta dello Sport, Il Guerin Sportivo, Il Giorno, Il Giornale, La Repubblica and several other publications. His articles were translated into several European languages. He often referred to himself as \\"Gioannbrerafucarlo\\" (a reference to Italy's long-foregone system of including the father's name in a citizen's complete name). He also wrote a number of books (handbooks, essays and fictional works), a theatre play, and a couple of radio plays. Brera died at middle-way between Codogno and Casalpusterlengo, in 1992, from injuries suffered in a car accident: a car on the other side of the road crashed into his car, causing his death and of two other passengers. Legacy Brera is considered one of the most influential Italian sports journalists of the 20th century. In 2003, the monumental Arena Civica (stadium), built in Milan by Napoleon I of France in the early 19th century, was renamed Arena Gianni Brera. Brera is widely credited for innovating Italian language, notably by creating a whole new terms for football (soccer), some of which have been adopted by other countries. The word libero (sweeper) for the third defender was coined by Brera. Famous nicknames he invented for Italian players include Abatino (\\"Little Abbot\\") for Gianni Rivera and Rombo di tuono (\\"Rolling Thunder\\") for Gigi Riva. He also nicknamed Silvio Berlusconi Il Cavaliere (\\"The Knight\\") after the businessman was awarded the Order of Merit for Labour. Furthermore, he coined the monikers \\"Il Vecchio Balordo\\" (The Old Fool) and \\"La Beneamata\\" (The Well-Cherished One) for Genoa and Internazionale football clubs, respectively. Living and working in Milan, Brera was a supporter of Internazionale, but he claimed to be a fan of Genoa in order to preventing him from being dragged into the rivalry between Inter, A.C. Milan and Juventus F.C. and to be able to write about those teams without alienating the readerships from their sides. Anyway, Brera's self-declared fondness for Genoa testified his love for the \\"heroic age\\" of Italian football (Genoa was Italy's first club and dominated the football championships until the early 1920s); moreover, after Brera's death the original foundation charter of the Genoa Cricket and Football Club was found among his papers, and his family donated it to a Genoese museum. Apart from the imaginative lexicon, Brera was noteworthy for his rich style and liberal use of foreign or regional phrases. He spoke fluent French and Spanish, a little German and Latin, and some English. In May 2019, Brera was inducted into the Italian Football Hall of Fame for the 2018 edition, under the category Special Awards. Bibliography * Atletica leggera. Scienza e poesia dell'orgoglio fisico.

Its modern version formulated in terms of the members' flexibility matrices also has the name the matrix force method due to its use of member forces as the primary unknowns. Member flexibility Flexibility is the inverse of stiffness. For example, consider a spring that has Q and q as, respectively, its force and deformation: * The spring stiffness relation is Q = k q where k is the spring stiffness. * Its flexibility relation is q = f Q, where f is the spring flexibility. * Hence, f = 1/k. A typical member flexibility relation has the following general form: :mathbf{q}^m = mathbf{f}^m mathbf{Q}^m + mathbf{q}^{om} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(1)} where :m = member number m. :mathbf{q}^m = vector of member's characteristic deformations. :mathbf{f}^m = member flexibility matrix which characterises the member's susceptibility to deform under forces. :mathbf{Q}^m = vector of member's independent characteristic forces, which are unknown internal forces. These independent forces give rise to all member- end forces by member equilibrium. :mathbf{q}^{om} = vector of member's characteristic deformations caused by external effects (such as known forces and temperature changes) applied to the isolated, disconnected member (i.e. with mathbf{Q}^m = 0 ). For a system composed of many members interconnected at points called nodes, the members' flexibility relations can be put together into a single matrix equation, dropping the superscript m: :mathbf{q}_{M times 1} = mathbf{f}_{M times M} mathbf{Q}_{M times 1} + mathbf{q}^{o}_{M times 1} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(2)} where M is the total number of members' characteristic deformations or forces in the system. Unlike the matrix stiffness method, where the members' stiffness relations can be readily integrated via nodal equilibrium and compatibility conditions, the present flexibility form of equation (2) poses serious difficulty. With member forces mathbf{Q}_{M times 1} as the primary unknowns, the number of nodal equilibrium equations is insufficient for solution, in general—unless the system is statically determinate. Nodal equilibrium equations To resolve this difficulty, first we make use of the nodal equilibrium equations in order to reduce the number of independent unknown member forces. The nodal equilibrium equation for the system has the form: :mathbf{R}_{N times 1} = mathbf{b}_{N times M} mathbf{Q}_{M times 1} + mathbf{W}_{N times 1} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(3)} where : mathbf{R}_{N times 1} : Vector of nodal forces at all N degrees of freedom of the system. : mathbf{b}_{N times M} : The resulting nodal equilibrium matrix : mathbf{W}_{N times 1} : The vector of forces arising from loading on the members. In the case of determinate systems, matrix b is square and the solution for Q can be found immediately from (3) provided that the system is stable. The primary system For statically indeterminate systems, M > N, and hence, we can augment (3) with I = M-N equations of the form: : X_i = alpha Q_j + beta Q_k + . . . qquad i=1,2, ... Iqquad qquad mathrm{(4)} The vector X is the so- called vector of redundant forces and I is the degree of statical indeterminacy of the system. We usually choose j, k, ..., alpha , and beta such that X_i is a support reaction or an internal member-end force. With suitable choices of redundant forces, the equation system (3) augmented by (4) can now be solved to obtain: :mathbf{Q}_{M times 1} = mathbf{B}_R mathbf{R}_{N times 1} + mathbf{B}_X mathbf{X}_{I times 1} + mathbf{Q}_{v cdot M times 1} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(5)} Substitution into (2) gives: :mathbf{q}_{M times 1} = mathbf{f}_{M times M} Big( mathbf{B}_R mathbf{R}_{N times 1} + mathbf{B}_X mathbf{X}_{I times 1} + mathbf{Q}_{v cdot M times 1} Big) + mathbf{q}^{o}_{M times 1} qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(6)} Equations (5) and (6) are the solution for the primary system which is the original system that has been rendered statically determinate by cuts that expose the redundant forces mathbf{X} . Equation (5) effectively reduces the set of unknown forces to mathbf{X} . Compatibility equation and solution Next, we need to set up I compatibility equations in order to find mathbf{X} . The compatibility equations restore the required continuity at the cut sections by setting the relative displacements mathbf{r}_{X} at the redundants X to zero. That is, using the unit dummy force method: :mathbf{r}_{X} = mathbf{B}_X^T mathbf{q} = mathbf{B}_X^T Big[ mathbf{f} Big( mathbf{B}_R mathbf{R} + mathbf{B}_X mathbf{X} + mathbf{Q}_v Big) + mathbf{q}^{o} Big] = 0 qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(7a)} :or mathbf{r}_{X} = mathbf{F}_{XX} mathbf{X} + mathbf{r}^o_X = 0 qquad qquad qquad mathrm{(7b)} where : mathbf{F}_{XX} = mathbf{B}_X^T mathbf{f} mathbf{B}_X : mathbf{r}^o_X = mathbf{B}_X^T Big[ mathbf{f} Big( mathbf{B}_R mathbf{R} + mathbf{Q}_v Big) + mathbf{q}^{o} Big] Equation (7b) can be solved for X, and the member forces are next found from (5) while the nodal displacements can be found by :mathbf{r}_{R} = mathbf{B}_R^T mathbf{q} = mathbf{F}_{RR} mathbf{R} + mathbf{r}^o_R where : mathbf{F}_{RR} = mathbf{B}_R^T mathbf{f} mathbf{B}_R is the system flexibility matrix. : mathbf{r}^o_R = mathbf{B}_R^T Big[ mathbf{f} Big( mathbf{B}_X mathbf{X} + mathbf{Q}_v Big) + mathbf{q}^{o} Big] Supports' movements taking place at the redundants can be included in the right-hand- side of equation (7), while supports' movements at other places must be included in mathbf{r}^o_X and mathbf{r}^o_R as well. Advantages and disadvantages While the choice of redundant forces in (4) appears to be arbitrary and troublesome for automatic computation, this objection can be overcome by proceeding from (3) directly to (5) using a modified Gauss-Jordan elimination process. This is a robust procedure that automatically selects a good set of redundant forces to ensure numerical stability. It is apparent from the above process that the matrix stiffness method is easier to comprehend and to implement for automatic computation. It is also easier to extend for advanced applications such as non-linear analysis, stability, vibrations, etc. For these reasons, the matrix stiffness method is the method of choice for use in general purpose structural analysis software packages. On the other hand, for linear systems with a low degree of statical indeterminacy, the flexibility method has the advantage of being computationally less intensive. This advantage, however, is a moot point as personal computers are widely available and more powerful. The main redeeming factor in learning this method nowadays is its educational value in imparting the concepts of equilibrium and compatibility in addition to its historical value. In contrast, the procedure of the direct stiffness method is so mechanical that it risks being used without much understanding of the structural behaviors. The upper arguments were valid up to the late 1990s. However, recent advances in numerical computing have shown a comeback of the force method, especially in the case of nonlinear systems. New frameworks have been developed that allow \\"exact\\" formulations irrespectively of the type or nature of the system nonlinearities. The main advantages of the flexibility method is that the result error is independent of the discretization of the model and that it is indeed a very fast method. For instance, the elastic- plastic solution of a continuous beam using the force method requires only 4 beam elements whereas a commercial \\"stiffness based\\" FEM code requires 500 elements in order to give results with the same accuracy. To conclude, one can say that in the case where the solution of the problem requires recursive evaluations of the force field like in the case of structural optimization or system identification, the efficiency of the flexibility method is indisputable.

Electrocoagulation has become a rapidly growing area of wastewater treatment due to its ability to remove contaminants that are generally more difficult to remove by filtration or chemical treatment systems, such as emulsified oil, total petroleum hydrocarbons, refractory organics, suspended solids, and heavy metals. There are many brands of electrocoagulation devices available and they can range in complexity from a simple anode and cathode to much more complex devices with control over electrode potentials, passivation, anode consumption, cell REDOX potentials as well as the introduction of ultrasonic sound, ultraviolet light and a range of gases and reactants to achieve so- called Advanced Oxidation Processes for refractory or recalcitrant organic substances.  Medical treatment  A fine wire probe or other delivery mechanism is used to transmit radio waves to tissues near the probe. Molecules within the tissue are caused to vibrate which lead to a rapid increase of the temperature, causing coagulation of the proteins within the tissue, effectively killing the tissue. At higher powered applications, full desiccation of tissue is possible.  Water treatment  With the latest technologies, reduction of electricity requirements, and miniaturization of the needed power supplies, EC systems have now become affordable for water treatment plants and industrial processes worldwide.OilTrap Environmental Products, Tumwater, WA. \\"Wash Water Treatment System.\\" Accessed 2012-12-05. = Background = Electrocoagulation (\\"electro\\", meaning to apply an electrical charge to water, and \\"coagulation\\", meaning the process of changing the particle surface charge, allowing suspended matter to form an agglomeration) is an advanced and economical water treatment technology. It effectively removes suspended solids to sub-micrometre levels, breaks emulsions such as oil and grease or latex, and oxidizes and eradicates heavy metals from water without the use of filters or the addition of separation chemicals Noling, Calvin (2004-07-01). \\"New Electrocoagulation System Addresses Challenges of Industrial Storm, Wash Water.\\" WaterWorld. PennWell Corporation. A wide range of wastewater treatment techniques are known, which includes biological processes for nitrification, denitrification and phosphorus removal, as well as a range of physico-chemical processes that require chemical addition. The commonly used physico-chemical treatment processes are filtration, air stripping, ion exchange, chemical precipitation, chemical oxidation, carbon adsorption, ultrafiltration (UF), reverse osmosis (RO), electrodialysis, volatilization, and gas stripping. =Benefits= * Mechanical Filtration addresses only two issues in wash rack wash water: suspended solids larger than 30 µm, and free oil and grease. Emulsified oil and grease cause damage to the media filters, resulting in very high maintenance costs. Electrocoagulation addresses any size of suspended solids (including destructive >30 µm particles and heavy metals that can wear-and- tear pressure washers and pose an environmental and employee hazard). * Chemical treatment addresses suspended solids, oil and grease, and some heavy metals—but may require up to three polymer and multiple pH adjustments for proper treatment. This technology requires the addition of chemicals resulting in expensive, messy, and labor-intensive treatment. This process also requires addition of compressed air for floatation of coagulated contaminants. Generally filtration is also required as a post-treatment phase for polishing. Electrocoagulation requires no filters, no daily maintenance, no additives, and removes any size of suspended solids, oil, grease and heavy metals. = Technology = Treatment of wastewater and wash water by EC has been practiced for most of the 20th century with increasing popularity. In the last decade, this technology has been increasingly used in the United States, South America and Europe for treatment of industrial wastewater containing metals.Rodriguez J, Stopić S, Krause G, Friedrich B (2007). \\"Feasibility Assessment of Electrocoagulation Towards a New Sustainable Wastewater Treatment.\\" Environmental Science and Pollution Research 14 (7), pp. 477–482. It has also been noted that in North America EC has been used primarily to treat wastewater from pulp and paper industries, mining and metal-processing industries. A large one-thousand gallon per minute cooling tower application in El Paso, Texas illustrates electrocoagulations growing recognition and acceptance to the industrial community. In addition, EC has been applied to treat water containing foodstuff waste, oil wastes, dyes, output from public transit and marinas, wash water, ink, suspended particles, chemical and mechanical polishing waste, organic matter from landfill leachates, defluorination of water, synthetic detergent effluents, and solutions containing heavy metals.Lai, C. L., Lin, S. H. 2003. \\"Treatment of chemical mechanical polishing wastewater by electrocoagulation: system performances and sludge settling characteristics.\\" Chemosphere 54 (3), January 2004, pp. 235-242. = Coagulation process = Coagulation is one of the most important physio-chemical reactions used in water treatment. Ions (heavy metals) and colloids (organic and inorganic) are mostly held in solution by electrical charges. The addition of ions with opposite charges destabilizes the colloids, allowing them to coagulate. Coagulation can be achieved by a chemical coagulant or by electrical methods. Alum [Al2(SO4)3.18H2O] is such a chemical substance, which has been widely used for ages for wastewater treatment. The mechanism of coagulation has been the subject of continual review. It is generally accepted that coagulation is brought about primarily by the reduction of the net surface charge to a point where the colloidal particles, previously stabilized by electrostatic repulsion, can approach closely enough for van der Waals forces to hold them together and allow aggregation. The reduction of the surface charge is a consequence of the decrease of the repulsive potential of the electrical double layer by the presence of an electrolyte having opposite charge. In the EC process, the coagulant is generated in situ by electrolytic oxidation of an appropriate anode material. In this process, charged ionic species—metals or otherwise—are removed from wastewater by allowing it to react with an ion having an opposite charge, or with floc of metallic hydroxides generated within the effluent. Electrocoagulation offers an alternative to the use of metal salts or polymers and polyelectrolyte addition for breaking stable emulsions and suspensions. The technology removes metals, colloidal solids and particles, and soluble inorganic pollutants from aqueous media by introducing highly charged polymeric metal hydroxide species. These species neutralize the electrostatic charges on suspended solids and oil droplets to facilitate agglomeration or coagulation and resultant separation from the aqueous phase. The treatment prompts the precipitation of certain metals and salts. > \\"Chemical coagulation has been used for decades to destabilize suspensions > and to effect precipitation of soluble metals species, as well as other > inorganic species from aqueous streams, thereby permitting their removal > through sedimentation or filtration.

When connected to an external power source, the anode material will electrochemically corrode due to oxidation, while the cathode will be subjected to passivation. An EC system essentially consists of pairs of conductive metal plates in parallel, which act as monopolar electrodes. It furthermore requires a direct current power source, a resistance box to regulate the current density and a multimeter to read the current values. The conductive metal plates are commonly known as \\"sacrificial electrodes.\\" The sacrificial anode lowers the dissolution potential of the anode and minimizes the passivation of the cathode. The sacrificial anodes and cathodes can be of the same or of different materials. The arrangement of monopolar electrodes with cells in series is electrically similar to a single cell with many electrodes and interconnections. In series cell arrangement, a higher potential difference is required for a given current to flow because the cells connected in series have higher resistance. The same current would, however, flow through all the electrodes. On the other hand, in parallel or bipolar arrangement the electric current is divided between all the electrodes in relation to the resistance of the individual cells, and each face on the electrode has a different polarity. During electrolysis, the positive side undergoes anodic reactions, while on the negative side, cathodic reactions are encountered. Consumable metal plates, such as iron or aluminum, are usually used as sacrificial electrodes to continuously produce ions in the water. The released ions neutralize the charges of the particles and thereby initiate coagulation. The released ions remove undesirable contaminants either by chemical reaction and precipitation, or by causing the colloidal materials to coalesce, which can then be removed by flotation. In addition, as water containing colloidal particulates, oils, or other contaminants move through the applied electric field, there may be ionization, electrolysis, hydrolysis, and free-radical formation which can alter the physical and chemical properties of water and contaminants. As a result, the reactive and excited state causes contaminants to be released from the water and destroyed or made less soluble. It is important to note that electrocoagulation technology cannot remove infinitely soluble matter. Therefore, ions with molecular weights smaller than Ca+2 or Mg+2 cannot be dissociated from the aqueous medium. = Reactions within the electrocoagulation reactor = Within the electrocoagulation reactor, several distinct electrochemical reactions are produced independently. These are: * Seeding, resulting from the anode reduction of metal ions that become new centers for larger, stable, insoluble complexes that precipitate as complex metal ions. * Emulsion Breaking, resulting from the oxygen and hydrogen ions that bond into the water receptor sites of emulsified oil molecules creating a water-insoluble complex separating water from oil, driller's mud, dyes, inks, fatty acids, etc. * Halogen Complexing, as the metal ions bind themselves to chlorines in a chlorinated hydrocarbon molecule resulting in a large insoluble complex separating water from pesticides, herbicides, chlorinated PCBs, etc. * Bleaching by the oxygen ions produced in the reaction chamber oxidizes dyes, cyanides, bacteria, viruses, biohazards, etc. Electron flooding of electrodes forced ions to be formed to carry charge into the water, thereby eliminating the polar effect of the water complex, allowing colloidal materials to precipitate and the current controlled ion transport between the electrodes creates an osmotic pressure that typically ruptures bacteria, cysts, and viruses. * Oxidation and Reduction reactions are forced to their natural end point within the reaction tank which speeds up the natural process of nature that occurs in wet chemistry, where concentration gradients and solubility products (KsP) are the chief determinants to enable reactions to reach stoichiometric completion. * Electrocoagulation Induced pH swings toward neutral. = Optimizing reactions = Careful selection of the reaction tank material is essential along with control of the current, flow rate and pH. Electrodes can be made of iron, aluminum, titanium, graphite or other materials, depending upon the wastewater to be treated and the contaminants to be removed. Temperature and pressure appear to have only a minor effect on the process. In the EC process the water-contaminant mixture separates into a floating layer, a mineral-rich flocculated sediment, and clear water. The floating layer is generally removed by means of an overflow weir or similar removal method. The aggregated flocculent mass settles either in the reaction vessel or in subsequent settling tanks due to gravitational force. Following removal to a sludge collection tank, it is typically dewatered to a semi-dry cake using a mechanical screw press. The clear, treated (supernatant) water is typically then pumped to a buffer tank for later disposal and/or reuse in the plant's designated process. = Advantages = * EC requires simple equipment and is easy to operate with sufficient operational latitude to handle most problems encountered on running. * Wastewater treated by EC gives palatable, clear, colorless and odorless water. * Sludge formed by EC tends to be readily settable and easy to de-water, compared to conventional alum or ferric hydroxide sludges, because the mainly metallic oxides/hydroxides have no residual charge. * Flocs formed by EC are similar to chemical floc, except that EC floc tends to be much larger, contains less bound water, is acid- resistant and more stable, and therefore, can be separated faster by filtration. * EC can produce effluent with less TDS content as compared with chemical treatments, particularly if the metal ions can be precipitated as either hydroxides or carbonates (such as magnesium and calcium. EC generally has little if any impact on sodium and potassium ions in solution. * The EC process has the advantage of removing the smallest colloidal particles, because the applied electric field neutralises any residual charge, thereby facilitating the coagulation. * The EC process generally avoids excessive use of chemicals and so there is reduced requirement to neutralize excess chemicals and less possibility of secondary pollution caused by chemical substances added at high concentration as when chemical coagulation of wastewater is used. * The gas bubbles produced during electrolysis can conveniently carry the pollutant components to the top of the solution where it can be more easily concentrated, collected and removed by a motorised skimmer. * The electrolytic processes in the EC cell are controlled electrically and with no moving parts, thus requiring less maintenance. * Dosing incoming waste water with sodium hypochlorite assists reduction of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and consequent chemical oxygen demand (COD) although this should be avoided for wastewater containing high levels of organic compounds or dissolved ammonia (NH4+) due to formation of trihalogenated methanes (THMs) or other chlorinated organics. Sodium hypochlorite can be generated electrolytically in an E cell using platinum and similar inert electrodes or by using external electrochlorinators.United States Bureau of Reclamation. Yuma, AZ. \\"Research Facilities and Test Equipment - Chemistry Research Units.\\" Updated 2012-07-27. * Due to the excellent EC removal of suspended solids and the simplicity of the EC operation, tests conducted for the U.S. Office of Naval Research concluded that the most promising application of EC in a membrane system was found to be as pretreatment to a multi-membrane system of UF/RO or microfiltration/reverse osmosis (MF/RO). In this function the EC provides protection of the low- pressure membrane that is more general than that provided by chemical coagulation and more effective. EC is very effective at removing a number of membrane fouling species (such as silica, alkaline earth metal hydroxides and transition group metals) as well as removing many species that chemical coagulation alone cannot remove.

Early life Hague's parents realised something was wrong with their son when he was 12 months old and still unable to sit up unaided. After visiting many specialists he was diagnosed with \\"infantile paralysis\\" though his condition is now known to be cerebral palsy. With the help of a toy railway engine made by his father, Hague learned to walk when he was three and half years old. At nine years of age, Hague went to Canada with his parents, where he received treatment at the Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children. The treatment was not successful, and the family returned to England after two and half years. Unable to settle, they returned to Canada, where they lived for about six years. In his teens, while at school in Oakville, Ontario, Hague took part in and won a mock election to \\"replace\\" the local mayor. It was at this time he discovered an ability to entertain people. Another achievement while in Canada was when Hague's father taught him to drive. Music career On his return to England at the age of 18, Hague soon started singing with various bands. At this stage it was mostly rock and roll with some country and western. He decided that the latter was his main interest. In 1964 he formed his own country trio called The Westernaires. In 1966, Hague turned professional and made his first recording, called \\"Mule Train\\", and married Ivy. They now have two children. \\"Mule Train\\" carried three tracks: the title song, a Hank Williams song and a self-penned song called \\"Don't Say a Word\\". Since then Hague has made 15 albums and a video. He has won numerous music and song writing awards at both club and national level. His most important award was as Country Music Entertainer of the Year in the 1981 Aria/Daily Mirror Golden Guitar Awards. In his act he covered Hank Williams, Johnny Cash, Jim Reeves, Don Williams, Waylon Jennings, Bobby Bare, Randy Travis, Alan Jackson, Confederate Railroad, The Tractors and The Mavericks. Hague's last public performance was on 9 July 2004. He was suffering from pain through the gig and in the following days things got worse. He was diagnosed as having a problem with four of his intervertebral discs. He was told that it would be a long road to recovery, so he decided to retire from musical performance. Doctors were not confident that he would walk again given his cerebral palsy, but he has made significant progress and is now able to get around using walking sticks. Writing and broadcasting Hague spent ten years with BBC Radio Sheffield presenting a weekly one-hour country music programme. He was with Great Yorkshire Radio for a year, presenting a weekly three-hour show. Hague is also a journalist. He does an occasional piece for Country Music Round Up, a weekly column for the South Yorkshire Times which ran for two years, and CD and book reviews for The New Entertainer in Doncaster, as well as a fortnightly column for the Doncaster Free Press. He also writes book reviews for The Goole Courier, and CD reviews for Traditional Music Maker and Country Music & Dance in Scotland along with X Country. In 1998, he set out to realise a lifelong ambition to become a novelist and has since written three westerns, To Hell with the Badge, Death on a Rope and Twisted River, and a horror novel, The Grey Man.

It includes routes that were defined by the California State Legislature but never built, as well as routes that have been entirely relinquished to local governments. Each state highway in California is maintained by the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) and is assigned a Route (officially State Highway Route) number in the Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635). Under the code, the state assigns a unique Route X to each highway, and does not differentiate between state, US, or Interstate highways. Overview * Lengths for each state route were initially measured as they were during the 1964 state highway renumbering (or during the year the route was established, if after 1964) based alignment that existed at the time, and do not necessarily reflect the current mileage. Portions of some routes have been relinquished to or are otherwise maintained by local or other governments, and may not be included in the length listed below. Several routes are broken into non-contiguous pieces, and their lengths may not reflect the overlaps that would be required to make them continuous. Some routes may also have a gap because it is either explicitly defined in the California Streets and Highways Code or due to an unconstructed portion, and the listed length may or may not reflect the gap. * If a route was renumbered, the old or new number is given in the \\"notes\\" column. * The years are when legislative action was taken, not when real-world changes were made. * Concurrences are not explicitly codified in the Streets and Highways Code; such highway segments are listed on only one of the corresponding legislative route numbers—for example, the I-80/I-580 concurrency, known as the Eastshore Freeway, is only listed under Route 80 in the highway code while the definition of Route 580 is broken into non-contiguous segments. When a highway is broken into such segments, the total length recorded by Caltrans only reflects those non-contiguous segments, and does not include those overlaps that would be required to make the route continuous. * Since the 1990s, a number of piecemeal relinquishments have been made. These are generally reflected in the length but not the termini. * Former termini are not shown if they are along the current route, meaning that the route was simply extended. * One Interstate Highway—Interstate 305—is defined only federally; the state calls it part of US 50. It was signed as part of Business Interstate 80, the only state-maintained Interstate business route in California.

He was noted for his extensive travels. Biography Barnekow was a son of Pomeranian nobleman Hans Mortensen Barnekow til Birkholm (d. 1559) and Mette Johansdatter Oxe (d. 1582), sister of Danish finance minister and Steward of the Realm, Peder Oxe (1520–1575). Barnekow held several estates, including Løvenborg (Løvenborg slott) which had been acquired by his father from the Crown in 1547 at which time he was also ennobled. Christian Barnekow inherited the estate after the death of his elder brother Johan Barnekow Birkolm in 1603. Barnekow acquired Vittskövle Castle (Vittskövle Slot) in Scania following his marriage Margareta Brahe (1584-1617), daughter of Henrik Brahe who had completed the castle in 1577. He acquired Tølløsegård (Tølløse Slot) jointly with his brother Jens Barnekow, in 1592 from the estate of Mette Rosenkrantz (1533-1588), widow of Peder Oxe. Barnekow spent nearly 16 years of his early life travelling throughout Europe and the Middle East, including a three-year journey in the Holy Land and Egypt. He spent six years at the Universities of Jena and Ingolstadt and two years at the University of Padua. After his return he became a diplomat for the Danish king, with further travels in Scotland, England, Poland and Brandenburg. Probably in 1591 he gave his autograph to Dietrich Bevernest, writing a Spanish proverb, Qui no ci cança, nunca alcança, meaning \\"those who never grow weary will achieve\\".Leonard Forster, Das Album Amicorum von Dietrich Bevernest (Amsterdam, 1982), p. 41. On 12 July 1594 he came to Scotland with Danish envoy Steen Bille (1565-1629) for the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. When they arrived Queen Anne left Edinburgh for Falkland Palace because Holyrood Palace was not magnificent enough. King James VI had an audience with them on 15 July, and after a few days arranged for them to lodge in private houses in Lothian because he could not afford to host them.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 376-7, 382, 385. Barnekow and his colleague Steen Bille brought necklaces for Queen Anne and Prince Henry, and King James gave them gold chains, which were heavier than those made for the ambassadors from the dukes of Mecklenberg and Brunswick.Thomas Rymer, Foedera, vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263: Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), pp. 77-8, 87. In March 1595, Scottish Jesuit Father James Myreton, brother of the Laird of Cambo, was detained at Leith and brought to King James VI. He said he was sent from Pope Clement VIII and Cardinal Cajetan. He brought a jewel from the Cardinal that depicted the Crucifixion made of gold, crystal, and bone, which King James gave to Queen Anne.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 556-579. The incident was of some significance and was reported to Barnekow, who commented that James VI did not have strong links with Rome.Maureen M. Meikle, 'Once a Dane, Always a Dane', Court Historian, 24:2 (August 2019), p. 174, citing University of Lund, Christian Barnekow archiv, Letters A 2.1. In September 1597, Barnekow and Arild Huitfeldt (1546–1609) were envoys to London and lodged in Fenchurch Street in the house of Alderman Houghton or the Customer Master Smith. Their mission concerned the Sound tolls. They returned the insignia of the Order of Garter that had belonged to King Frederick II of Denmark. Queen Elizabeth made a joke at their expense on her birthday, 7 September. After their audiences in London they came to Scotland.William Acres, Letters of Lord Burleigh to his son Robert Cecil (Cambridge, 2017), p. 272: Nichols, John, Progresses and Public Processions of Elizabeth, vol. 3 (London, 1823), pp. 419-420: Elizabeth Goldring, Faith Eales, Elizabeth Clarke, Jayne Elisabeth Archer, John Nichols's Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth: 1596-1603, vol. 4 (Oxford, 2014), p. 57. Christian Barnekow died in 1612 during the Kalmar War against Sweden after which his widow, Margrethe Brahe, took over his estates together with their two still underage sons Hans Barnekow (b. 1601) and Ove Barnekow (b. 1608). Hans Poulsen Resen (1561-1638), Bishop of the Diocese of Zealand held the funeral session for Barnekow on 26 March 1612 in Elsinore. He noted in his writings that Barnekow brought back with him many rare things, which he had found in foreign countries; unfortunately they have all disappeared.

New England Historical and Genealogical Society, 1860, pgs. 872-882 Quincy's father had traveled to England in 1774, partly for his health but mainly as an agent of the patriot cause to with the friends of the colonists in London. Josiah Quincy II died off the coast of Gloucester on April 26, 1775. His son, young Josiah, was not yet three years old. He entered Phillips Academy, Andover, when it opened in 1778, and graduated from Harvard in 1790. After his graduation from Harvard he studied law for three years under the tutorship of William Tudor. Quincy was admitted to the bar in 1793, but was never a prominent advocate. In 1797 Quincy married Eliza Susan Morton of New York, younger sister of Jacob Morton. They had seven children: Eliza Susan Quincy, Josiah Quincy, Jr., Abigail Phillips Quincy, Maria Sophia Quincy, Margaret Morton Quincy, Edmund Quincy, and Anna Cabot Lowell Quincy. =Career= In 1798 Quincy was appointed Boston Town Orator by the Board of Selectmen, and in 1800 he was elected to the School Committee. Quincy became a leader of the Federalist party in Massachusetts, was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States House of Representatives in 1800, and served in the Massachusetts Senate in 1804–5. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1803. From 1805 to 1813, he was a member of the United States House of Representatives where he was one of the small Federalist minority. In the dark days of the Embargo in the second term of President Thomas Jefferson, he suggested his impeachment. He attempted to secure the exemption of fishing vessels from the Embargo Act, urged the strengthening of the United States Navy, and vigorously opposed the admittance of Louisiana as a state in 1811. In this last matter he stated as his \\"deliberate opinion, that if this bill passes, the bonds of this Union are virtually dissolved; that the States that compose it are free from their moral obligations; and that, as it will be the right of all, so it will be the duty of some, to prepare definitely for a separation, amicably if they can, violently if they must.\\"Speech on January 14, 1811.

Quincy left Congress because he saw that the Federalist opposition was useless. In 1812, Quincy was a founding member of the American Antiquarian Society.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory Josiah Quincy, oil on canvas, Gilbert Stuart, 1824–1825. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston After leaving Congress, Quincy was a member of the Massachusetts Senate until 1820. In 1821–22 he was a member and speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives. Quincy resigned from the legislature to become judge of the municipal court of Boston. Quincy was a candidate for Mayor of Boston in Boston's first election under a city charter, held on April 8, 1822. The votes of this first election were evenly split between Quincy and Harrison Gray Otis, with a few votes to others. Neither Quincy nor Otis had a majority, so neither was elected. They both withdrew their candidacies, and John Phillips was elected Boston's first mayor. In 1823 Quincy was elected as the second mayor of Boston; he served six-one year terms from 1823 to 1828. During his terms as mayor Quincy Market was built, the fire and police departments were reorganized, and the city's care of the poor was systematized. From 1829 to 1845, he was President of Harvard University, of which he had been an overseer since 1810, when the board was reorganized. At a time when college presidents were chosen for their intellectual achievements, Quincy's past experience as a politician and not an academic made him an unusual choice. He has been called \\"the great organizer of the university.\\" He gave an elective (or \\"voluntary\\") system an elaborate trial; introduced a system of marking (on the scale of 8) on which college rank and honors, formerly rather carelessly assigned, were based; first used courts of law to punish students who destroyed or damaged college property; and helped to reform the finances of the university. During his term Dane Hall (for law) was dedicated, Gore Hall was built, and the Astronomical Observatory was equipped. Quincy House, one of the university's twelve upperclass residential houses, is named for him. In 1856 Quincy gave an address concerning the then upcoming American presidential election. Quincy endorsed the Republican candidate, John C. Fremont, and denounced how \\"for more than fifty years, the Slave States have subjugated the Free States.\\"Address Illustrative of the Nature and Power of the Slave States and the Duties of the Free States (Ticknor and Fields, 1856) This speech is cited in \\"Negro President\\": Jefferson and the Slave Power, by Garry Wills.

He was a principal spokesman for the Sons of Liberty in Boston prior to the Revolution and was John Adams' co-counsel during the trials of Captain Thomas Preston and the soldiers involved in the Boston Massacre. Family Quincy was the son of Col. Josiah Quincy I and the father of the Harvard president and Boston mayor Josiah Quincy III. He was a descendant of Edmund Quincy, who emigrated to Massachusetts in 1633. His first cousin once removed was Dorothy Quincy, wife of Governor John Hancock. He was also a distant relative of John Quincy Adams through the sixth President's mother, Abigail Smith Adams. Life Quincy was born in Boston in 1744, to Col. Josiah Quincy and Hannah Sturgis Quincy. In 1756, shortly after the death of his mother, he moved with his father and other siblings to their ancestral homestead in Braintree. In 1763, he graduated Harvard, and began studying law in the office of Oxenbridge Thacher (died 1765), a top Boston attorney, whose practice he would take over in 1765. A gifted orator, in 1766 he delivered an impassioned address in English \\"on liberty,\\" or as others would recall it, on the meaning of being \\"a patriot,\\" at Harvard's commencement upon receiving his Masters. The speech caught the attention of Boston's patriot leadership, and by 1767, he was contributing regularly to Samuel Adams' Boston Gazette. Published initially under the name \\"Hyperion\\", his essays were notable for their colorful rhetoric and denouncement of British oppression. On February 12, 1770, he published in the Gazette a call to his countrymen \\"to break off all social intercourse with those whose commerce contaminates, whose luxuries poison, whose avarice is insatiable, and whose unnatural oppressions are not to be borne He used the signatures Mentor, Callisthenes, Marchmont Needham, Edward Sexby, &c.;, in later letters to the Boston Gazette. After the Boston Massacre (March 5, 1770) he and John Adams defended Captain Preston and the accused soldiers and secured their acquittal. Prosecuting the case were Robert Treat Paine and Josiah's older brother Samuel Quincy, who shortly after was named solicitor general.Pages 1-17 The life of Josiah Quincy, by Edmund Quincy, Little, Brown and Company Boston 1874 6th Edition He traveled for his health in the South in 1773, and left in his journal an interesting account of his travels and of society in South Carolina; this journey was important in that it brought Southern patriots into closer relations with the popular leaders in Massachusetts. Perhaps seeking to enhance his standing in advance of the selection of delegates to the First Continental Congress, in May 1774 he published Observations on the Act of Parliament, commonly called The Boston Port Bill, with Thoughts on Civil Society and Standing Armies, in which he urged patriots and heroes to form a compact for opposition and for vengeance. In September 1774 he secretly left for England, where he argued the American cause to British politicians who were sympathetic to the colonies. On March 16, 1775, he started back, but he died of tuberculosis on April 26, 1775, on a boat within sight of the Massachusetts shore.Page 21 The life of Josiah Quincy, by Edmund Quincy, Little, Brown and Company Boston 1874 6th Edition See also *Quincy political family References ;Attribution Massachusetts lawyers Harvard University alumni Quincy family Members of the Universalist Church of America 1744 births 1775 deaths 18th-century American lawyers 18th-century Christian universalists 18th-century deaths from tuberculosis Lawyers from Boston People from Braintree, Massachusetts People of Massachusetts in the American Revolution People from colonial Boston People of colonial Massachusetts ","title":"Josiah Quincy II"},{"id":"2820588","text":"Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520 (1979), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court addressed the constitutionality of various conditions of confinement of inmates held in federal short-term detention facilities.. The Court found that while treatment of pre-trial detainees is subject to constraint by the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments,[2] all of the policies challenged in the case passed constitutional scrutiny. Factual background  Inmates at the Metropolitan Correctional Center (MCC) filed a class action suit challenging the constitutionality of several conditions of their confinement.Bell, 441 U.S. at 523–25. Opened in 1975 in New York City, the MCC served as a federally-operated short-term detention facility mainly for defendants awaiting trial at one of three federal district courts located in the New York City area. Though the MCC was initially constructed to house some 449 inmates, administrators were quickly forced to double-bunk inmates to accommodate the \\"unprecedented\\" increase in new detainees. In their complaint, petitioners argued that this practice of double-bunking inmates awaiting trial was unconstitutional. They also made claims against various MCC policies, including the \\"undue length of confinement, improper searches, inadequate recreational, educational, and employment opportunities, insufficient staff, and objectionable restrictions on the purchase and receipt of personal items and books.\\"  Procedural history  After certifying the case as a class action, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York enjoined the MCC practices challenged by petitioners, holding that inmates could only be deprived of liberty as a matter of \\"compelling necessity.\\" On appeal, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed nearly all of the District Court's rulings, including the due process standard the District Court utilized in enjoining the MCC's practices. The Court of Appeals did not affirm the District Court's Eighth Amendment analysis related to convicted inmates at the MCC awaiting sentencing or transfer, and instead remanded that issue to the District Court.Bell, 441 U.S. at 530. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari on October 2, 1978..  Majority opinion  = Double-bunking = In its majority opinion, the Supreme Court reversed the Court of Appeals. First, it noted that the “compelling necessity” standard on which the Court of Appeals relied was not grounded in the Constitution. Rather, the Court held, in order to evaluate whether conditions of pre-trial confinement violate an inmate's guarantee of due process, a court must determine whether those conditions “amount to punishment of the detainee”.Bell v. Wolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 535 (1979). Because the MCC's practice of double- bunking did not amount to punishment, the policy did not violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.[2][3] = Other challenged practices = The Court also determined that the policy of prohibiting detainee from receiving hard-cover books not mailed directly from the publisher did not violate the First Amendment. In addition, the Court held that the practice of prohibiting detainees from receiving packages from outside the facility was not a due process violation under the Fifth Amendment. Nor, in the Court's opinion, was the practice of performing body cavity searches on detainees after contact visits a violation of the Fourth Amendment. Finally, the Court held that none of these practices constituted punishment within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. References Further reading = Journal articles = *Keith A. Hassler, Bell v.

It was the practice of making small scale night-time surprise attacks on enemy positions. Overview Typically, raids were carried out by small teams of men who would black up their faces with burnt cork before crossing the barbed wire and other debris of no man's land to infiltrate enemy trench systems. The distance between friendly and enemy front lines varied, but was generally several hundred metres. Any attempt to raid a trench during daylight hours would have been pointless because it would have been quickly spotted: enemy machine gunners and snipers had a clear view of no man's land and could easily shoot anyone who showed their head above the trench parapet. U.S. M1917 \\"Knuckle Duster\\" trench knife and leather sheath of World War I Standard practice was to creep slowly up on the sentries guarding a small sector of an enemy front line trench (looking for the glow of cigarettes in the dark or listening for conversations) then kill them as quietly as possible. Having secured the trench the raiders would complete their mission objectives as quickly as possible, ideally within several minutes. Raiders were aware that the longer they stayed in the trench, the greater the likelihood of enemy reinforcements arriving. Grenades would be thrown into dugouts where enemy troops were sleeping before the raiders left the enemy lines to return to their own. Irish troops comprised the majority of British trench raiders. This was because the Irish troops wanted to prove their worth to the British high command. This resulted in the Irish trench raiders receiving the most Victoria Crosses during the war. There was always a risk that returning raiders could be shot in so-called friendly fire incidents. Therefore, it was standard procedure to notify sentries along the line whenever raiding parties were sent out, and to use some form of password system so that returning raiders could identify themselves when challenged in the dark. Purpose Trench raiding had multiple purposes. Typically, the intention would be one or more of the following: * Capture, wound or kill enemy troops * Destroy, disable or capture high value equipment e.g. machine guns such as the MG08 * Gather intelligence by seizing important documents (e.g. maps) or enemy officers for interrogation * Reconnaissance for a future massed attack during daylight hours * Keep the enemy feeling under threat during the hours of darkness, thereby reducing their efficiency and morale * Maintain aggressiveness and fighting spirit in the troops by sending them on such missions Weapons Despite the fact that World War I was the first conflict to be fought by mechanized means, trench raiding was very similar to medieval warfare insofar as it was fought face-to- face with crude weaponry. Trench raiders were lightly equipped for stealthy, unimpeded movement. Typically, raiding parties were armed with deadly homemade trench raiding clubs, bayonets, entrenching tools, trench knives, hammers, hatchets, pickaxe handles and brass knuckles.\\"In the Trenches\\", Nov 12, 2012, John S. Nash, Bloody Elbow The choice of weaponry was deliberate: the raiders' intention was to kill or capture people quietly, without drawing attention to their activities. Clearly, this would have been impossible if they had routinely used firearms during raids. Trench raiders were also armed with more modern weapons such as pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and hand grenades, though these were only intended to be used in an emergency i.e. if the enemy discovered their activities and raised the alarm.

Product  Therm-a-Rest sleeping bag A Therm-a-Rest self-inflating mattress consists of an airtight nylon fabric envelope filled with a sheet of low density, open-cell polyurethane foam. When a valve is opened the foam expands and draws air into the mattress. When the mattress has fully inflated, the user simply closes the valve. To increase firmness a few breaths of air can be blown into the mattress. To pack the mattress the valve is opened and it is rolled up tightly to force the air out, whereupon the valve is closed to prevent re-inflation.

The term came in the form of hostile reviews in Blackwood's Magazine in 1817. Its primary target was Leigh Hunt, but John Keats and William Hazlitt were also included. Only Keats could properly be regarded as a cockney. Hazlitt was not even born in London. John Scott died after a duel over the controversy. Leigh Hunt the supposed chief offender of the \\"Cockney School.\\" Each of the writers was derided for a slightly different quality. Keats, for example, was accused of \\"low diction\\" for rhyming \\"thorns/fawns\\" in \\"Sleep and Poetry\\" and other rhymes which suggested a working class speech. Hunt and Hazlitt were similarly vilified for their diction, but the criticisms were more ideological with them than with Keats. John Wilson Croker perpetuated the term \\"Cockney School\\" beyond the pages of Blackwood's in 1818 when he attacked Keats's Endymion in the Quarterly Review.John Wilson (Christopher North) and Lockhart had joined its staff in 1817. Lockhart shared in the caustic and aggressive articles that marked the early years of Blackwood; but his biographer Andrew Lang denied he was responsible for the virulent articles on Coleridge and on \\"The Cockney School of Poetry\\" of Leigh Hunt, Keats and their friends. Lockhart has been accused of the later Blackwood article (August 1818) on Keats, but he did show appreciation of Coleridge and Wordsworth.[4] Background The term, and the campaign against Hunt and the others, was not a question of aesthetics. It was, instead, an attack on the class background of the authors and their aspirations to the highest level of the literati, and it was, additionally, a reaction to the \\"Cockney\\" politics of the authors. The political, reformist agenda and the democratic ideology of Hunt and Hazlitt were offensive to the Blackwood's review staff, and the cultural and class background of the authors was introduced as a mechanism. Percy Bysshe Shelley was accused of being similarly offensive politically, but the reviewers excused him for his genius (and, of course, his high birth). The second generation of the Romantic movement was as politically and economically revolutionary as it was aesthetically challenging to the status quo, and the controversy and partial reviewers responsible for the creation of the \\"Cockney School\\" epithet foreground how offensive it was to the establishment that lower class persons might emerge. According to the 1907 Nuttall's Brief Encyclopedia, the term was revived in the 1890s by working class London poets, but, although this may have been en vogue at the turn of the twentieth century, the term is currently remembered for the Romantic reference only.

They are sometimes called as well, particularly if they have a green fabric hem. Sudare are made of horizontal slats of decorative wood, bamboo, or other natural material woven together with simple string, colored yarn, or other decorative material to make nearly solid blinds. They could be either rolled or folded up out of the way. Yoshizu, non-hanging type sudare, are made of vertical slats of common reed and used as screen. Sudare are used in many Japanese homes to shield the verandah and other openings of the building from sunlight, rain, and insects. They are normally put up in spring and taken down again in autumn. Their light structure allows breezes to pass through, a benefit in the hot Japanese summers. Since the building materials are easy to find, sudare can be made cheaply. Elaborate sudare for palaces and villas used high-quality bamboo, with expensive silk and gold embroidery worked in. Sometimes they featured paintings, most often on the inside; some Chinese screens had symbols painted on the outside as well. Social role File:Genji_monogatari_%28ch._34%29.jpgOutside view.

They are featured prominently in The Tale of Genji. During the Heian Era, a court lady would conceal herself behind a screen when speaking with a man outside her immediate family. She could peep through it and see her interlocutor, but because he had to remain at a distance from it, he could not see her. Only with her permission might he step closer and only she would ever raise the screen. Any unwarranted moves on the man's part were seen as a grave breach of etiquette and a threat against the lady's honour. Sudare were also used in imperial audiences. Since looking directly at the tennō (\\"heavenly ruler\\") was forbidden, he would sit hidden behind a screen in the throne hall, with only his shoes showing. This practice fell out of use as imperial power declined. Modern production With the dawn of modernity, the production of sudare went into decline and became a traditional handicraft, but they still are sold and shipped abroad by various companies. They are woven on looms, and they are now made into a variety of products.

The village lies about south of both Edinburgh and Glasgow. It is bounded by the North Medwyn and South Medwyn watercourses. Carnwath is a farming town set in rolling countryside, on the edge of open moorland and with views to the Pentland Hills. Its proximity to the A70 makes it popular with commuters to Edinburgh. Carnwath is at the heart of Scotland's central belt and has been reputed to be the town furthest away from the sea anywhere in Scotland, though only being from the coastal resort of Portobello, it falls well short of the distance from the sea of towns such as Kingussie and Pitlochry. Little remains of the original castle, but the motte on which it was built can still be seen at the Carnwath Golf Club (founded 1907), at the west end of the village. Carnwath also hosts the oldest foot race in Scotland, possibly Europe, the Red Hose Race, dating back to 13 March 1508. It has seen many changes over almost 500 years, but the running of The Red Hose is still a strong tradition in Carnwath. Hose being the Scots word for stockings or long socks. Each year a foot race is run at Carnwath and the local Laird must provide a pair of red stockings as the prize. The Wee Bush Inn, until a fire, was the last pub in Scotland to have a thatched roof. For insurance purposes it has had to be replaced with a slate roof. The Inn's other claim to fame is that actor Oliver Reed was a regular customer.Visit Lanarkshire History At the centre of Carnwath is Carnwath Cross, the mercat cross, set back a little where the Main Street widens to form the Market Square. This was erected by the 5th Lord Somerville in 1516 to celebrate the granting of burgh status to the village in 1514. On the opposite side of the main road from the golf club and motte is Carnwath Parish Church. Initially the architectural style appears to be a standard 19th century church with spire, but the west side reveals an almost separate tiny chapel, St Mary's Aisle, a surviving part of the collegiate church founded here in 1425 by Thomas, First Lord Somerville and incorporating an earlier church established in 1386. St Mary's Aisle is the only remaining part of the Collegiate Church built in Carnwath in 1386. It stands at the west entrance to Carnwath alongside the parish church and is recognised as a Category A listed building. St Mary's Aisle is the mausoleum of the Lockhart family and previously of the Earls of Carnwath and the Lords Somerville. In 1630, the Carnwath estate, then owned by the Earl of Mar was purchased by Sir Robert Dalzell, later to become Lord Dalzell. In 1639, his son, Robert the 2nd Lord Dalzell, was further elevated to become the Earl of Carnwath. The title was forfeit in 1716 when the 5th Earl of Carnwath, Robert Dalzell was attainted due to his support of the Jacobite cause during the Fifteen, however the titles were restored to the family in 1826.The PeerageDalzell Writer, spy and politician, George Lockhart, inherited the Carnwath estates from his father, Sir George Lockhart, of the Lockharts of Lee, who had purchased them in 1681 from the Earls of Carnwath. The Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland (1882–1885) said the village was: \\"Long a dingy and disagreeable place, it has been greatly improved\\".The Ordnance Gazetteer of Scotland There is a Gothic church that dates from 1798, directly abutting the former tiny church of 1424. Other buildings of note in the village include the old primary school on Main Street, dated 1876 and abandoned since 2006. Additionally, within King George's Park sits a 1935 sports pavilion, formerly used by Carnwath Bowls Club. In 1845 the area became a civil parish. Carnwath railway station, originally part of the Caledonian Railway, later the London, Midland and Scottish Railway and finally the Scottish Region of British Railways, was closed in the Beeching Axe in the 1960s. Famous people from Carnwath include the first woman provost of Kirkintilloch, Jenny Coutts, author and critic, Robert Anderson, footballer, Tom Brownlee and the Ordnance Gazetteer remarks that: \\"the minor poet, James Graeme (1749-72)\\" was a resident of the locality. Education There is a nursery school in the village which is part of the Biggar Learning Community, that includes the Biggar High School A new school was built and opened in 2015.Carnwath Primary School A notable spell of cold weather In January 1979 the temperature in Carnwath sank to , which was the lowest temperature recorded anywhere in the British Isles in the 1970s. In popular culture Carnwath is mentioned twice in the traditional song We're No' Awa' Tae Bide Awa', also known as Carnwath Mill. So we had a hauf an' anither hauf, And then we had anither, When he got fou' he shouted \\"Hoo! It's Carnwath Mill for ever.\\" For we're no' awa' tae bide awa' , etc. And:- So whenever friendly friens may meet, Wherever Scots foregather, We'll raise our gless, we'll shout Hurroo, It's Carnwath Mill for ever. The allusion is obscure. Carnwath Mill is a farm (and formerly, a mill) about a mile from Carnwath; alternatively, there was lint mill at Carnwath erected in 1762; the former survives as a house and holiday let and The Lint Mill hosts a B&B; and is an organic smallholding. The song also alludes to Wilsontown, which was about six miles away.

He was born on 6 January 1830 in Darmstadt, Germany and died on 5 August 1914. He was buried in Breisgau. Hegar was the son of Johann August Hegar (1794-1882), a country Doctor. He studied medicine in Giessen, Heidelberg, Berlin and Vienna, and after graduation went into the army and worked as military physician. He later went into private practice as an obstetrician in the city of Darmstadt. Alfred Hegar was chosen to be the successor of Otto Spiegelberg as professor for gynecology and obstetrics at the University of Freiburg in 1864 and was the first head of the Universitäts-Frauenklinik of the University Medical Center Freiburg when it opened in 1868. Hegar also founded the journal \\"Beiträge zur Geburthilfe und Gynäkologie\\" in 1898. He was a pioneer of antiseptics and antiseptic procedures. Hegar retired in 1904. Among the many techniques and instruments he developed were Hegar's sign and Hegar dilators, as well as Hegar's operation, an operation for repairing a ruptured perineum. His works are still widely discussed at colleges of obstetrics worldwide.

He is best known as a member of the blues-rock band Derek and the Dominos, with Eric Clapton, in 1970–71. Whitlock's musical career began with Memphis soul acts such as Sam & Dave and Booker T. & the M.G.'s before he joined Delaney & Bonnie and Friends in 1968. His association with Delaney & Bonnie bandmate Clapton led to Whitlock's participation in sessions for George Harrison's 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass, in London, and the formation of Derek and the Dominos that year. On the band's sole studio album, the critically acclaimed Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs, Whitlock wrote or co-wrote eight of the album's fourteen tracks, including \\"Tell the Truth\\", \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" and \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?\\" Whitlock recorded four solo albums during the 1970s, among them Bobby Whitlock and Raw Velvet, and contributed to albums by Clapton, John Lennon, Dr John and the Rolling Stones. He then withdrew from music until releasing It's About Time in 1999. Following his return, Whitlock has recorded and performed with his wife, CoCo Carmel, and since 2006 with other musicians based in Austin, Texas. Among his and Carmel's projects, Other Assorted Love Songs, Live from Whitney Chapel contains acoustic interpretations of songs originally recorded by Derek and the Dominos.  Biography  =Early career 1965–68= The Stax Museum in Memphis, a replica of the now-demolished Stax studio, where Whitlock spent part of his teenage years In an article for Mojo magazine in May 2011, music journalist Phil Sutcliffe described Whitlock as having been born in Memphis and learning to play the Hammond organ \\"peering over Booker T's shoulder at Stax studios\\". While still a teenager, Whitlock befriended acts associated with Stax Records, including Albert King, Sam & Dave, the Staples Singers and Booker T. & the M.G.'s,Whitlock, pp. 28–29. and was the first white artist signed to the label. His first contribution to a recording was in 1967, when he supplied handclaps on Sam & Dave's single \\"I Thank You\\". Between 1965 and 1968, Whitlock performed regularly in the Memphis area, playing organ with local soul band the Short Cuts before forming the Counts.Whitlock, pp. 27, 31, 34. In his 2010 autobiography, Whitlock writes of this period in Memphis: \\"It was a great time and town for music then, especially soul music. It was real rhythm and blues. Albert King R&B;, that's what I'm talking about. It was loose and all about music everywhere that you turned.\\"Whitlock, p. 27. With established Stax musicians such as Steve Cropper as his mentor, and Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn and Don Nix preparing to produce a pop album by him on a Stax subsidiary label, Whitlock instead left Memphis after meeting the husband-and-wife team Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett.Whitlock, pp. 34–35. Whitlock recalls that he was performing at a club with the Counts when the Bramletts invited him to join a soul-revue band they were forming in Los Angeles.Whitlock, p. 35. =Delaney & Bonnie 1968–70= Whitlock contributed on keyboards and vocals to two Delaney & Bonnie albums in 1969, Home and Accept No Substitute. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Their touring band, known as Delaney & Bonnie and Friends, included musicians he would continue to work with on projects through to the early 1970s: bassist Carl Radle; drummers Jim Keltner and Jim Gordon;Whitlock, pp. 42, 48–49. and a horn section comprising Bobby Keys and Jim Price.Graff & Durchholz, p. 327.O'Dell, pp. 111, 167. Another member was Eric Clapton, who joined the Friends as lead guitarist midway through a U.S. tour in July–August 1969.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, p. 183. On this tour, Delaney & Bonnie were supporting Clapton's short-lived supergroup Blind Faith, with Steve Winwood.The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll, pp. 183, 254.Harris, p. 69. Clapton later described Whitlock as \\"without doubt the most energetic sideman I had ever seen\\".Eric Clapton's foreword, Whitlock, p. 1. Along with all the other members of Delaney & Bonnie, Whitlock flew to England in November 1969 to prepare for a highly publicized European tour, financed by Clapton. In his autobiography, Whitlock states that their arrival in London changed the dynamics within the band, as the Bramletts now considered themselves \\"big stars\\" and the ones solely responsible for the new-found success.Whitlock, pp. 52, 53. Once in London, Whitlock participated in a session for a solo album by the American soul singer Doris Troy, on the Beatles' Apple record label.Harris, p. 70. The album, Doris Troy (1970), was co-produced by George Harrison, who, having championed Delaney & Bonnie in the British press, accepted Clapton's invitation to join the tour.Whitlock, pp. 53–54. Through Harrison, Whitlock and the band then played at John Lennon's \\"Peace for Christmas\\" concert, held at the Lyceum Ballroom in London on December 15, 1969.Leng, p. 67. In early 1970, Delaney & Bonnie and Friends backed Clapton on his debut solo album, Eric Clapton,Reid, p. xiii. and toured America with the English guitarist.Whitlock, p. 60. After arguments with the Bramletts over money, the other Friends quit the band and joined Leon Russell on Joe Cocker's Mad Dogs and Englishmen tour. Whitlock continued to work with Delaney & Bonnie until April, following sessions for their album To Bonnie from Delaney (1970).Whitlock, pp. 61, 65. On Cropper's advice, he then returned to England to stay with Clapton at his home, Hurtwood Edge, in Surrey. =Derek and the Dominos 1970–71= Derek and the Dominos in 1970 (from left to right): Jim Gordon, Carl Radle, Whitlock and Eric Clapton Seeking to start a new band, Whitlock and Clapton reunited with Radle and Gordon at a session for P.P. Arnold,Harris, p. 72. before going on to back Harrison on his 1970 triple album All Things Must Pass.Reid, p. 95. Whitlock has described the latter sessions as \\"spectacular in every way\\". Although individual contributions remain hard to ascertain, due to the large cast of musicians on the Phil Spector-produced recording, Harrison biographer Simon Leng identifies Whitlock as one of two \\"core keyboard players\\" on All Things Must Pass.Leng, p. 82fn. Having traditionally favored Hammond organ as his keyboard instrument,Whitlock, pp. 75–76. Whitlock played piano for the first time on a studio recording during the session for Harrison's \\"Beware of Darkness\\".Leng, p. 92fn.Reid, p. 94. In June 1970, early in the All Things Must Pass sessions, Clapton, Whitlock, Radle and Gordon formed the blues-rock band Derek and the Dominos. Their first release was a US-only single, \\"Tell the Truth\\", produced by Spector and written primarily by Whitlock.Reid, pp. 104, 105.Schumacher, p. 143. In August, once their work on Harrison's album was complete, Derek and the Dominos toured the UK, playing to small venues.Reid, p. 107. That summer, Whitlock and his bandmates also participated in London sessions for Dr John's album The Sun, Moon & Herbs (1971).Reid, p. 105. Unhappy with Spector's treatment of their sound, the band went to Criteria Studios in Miami to work with producer Tom Dowd,Clapton, pp. 135–36.Harris, p. 73. on what became a double album – Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs (1970).Graff & Durchholz, p. 238. As well as a remake of \\"Tell the Truth\\",Reid, p. 128. the album included six other songs written or co-written by Whitlock, including \\"Anyday\\", \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?\\", \\"Keep on Growing\\" and \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden\\". In addition, Whitlock helped Clapton finish \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", although he was not initially credited as a co- writer on that song. \\"Keep on Growing\\" and \\"Thorn Tree in the Garden\\" featured Whitlock on lead vocals, while on other tracks he and Clapton shared the singing in a style reminiscent of Sam & Dave.Reid, pp. xv, 126, 127, 130. Adding to the power of the Dominos' music, Clapton's inspiration for the songs on Layla was his unrequited love for Pattie Boyd, Harrison's wife. Whitlock began a relationship with Boyd's sister Paula at this time,Clapton, p. 135. and was therefore, as he has described it, \\"in the inner circle ... in the middle of it with all of them\\".Whitlock, p. 77. He comments on a musical dialogue between Harrison and Clapton in their songs: \\"There were subliminal messages, going back and forth, between two good friends as a way of healing and setting each other free ... I have always known that the better part of those songs [on All Things Must Pass] were directed to Eric, just like Eric's were to George on the Layla record.\\" Between October and December 1970, Derek and the Dominos toured the United States in support of Layla. The Elton John Band was their opening act. In his autobiography, Elton John said ‘They were phenomenal. From the side of the stage, I took mental notes of their performance…it was their keyboard player Bobby Whitlock that I watched like a hawk…. You watched and you learned, from people that had more experience than you.’ But the Layla album made little commercial impact on release, failing to chart in the UK. Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). Clapton's despondency at being rejected by Boyd, the band's drug consumption, and personal conflicts between the members, particularly with Gordon, all contributed to the break-up of the Dominos in May 1971. =Solo career 1971–76= Whitlock recorded his debut solo album, Bobby Whitlock (1972), at London's Olympic Studios in 1971, with Andy Johns as his co-producer. The recording took place before the abortive sessions for the Dominos' second studio album; a press release for the 2013 reissue of Bobby Whitlock gives the recording date as starting in March 1971, while Dominos biographer Jan Reid writes of sessions happening in January that year.Reid, p. 145. Whitlock played acoustic or electric rhythm guitar on much of the album,Whitlock, pp. 237–38. which also included musical contributions from all the Dominos (often recorded separately), the Bramletts, Harrison, Keys, Price and Keltner.Leng, p. 123fn. Among its tracks, \\"Where There's a Will\\" was a Whitlock–Bonnie Bramlett collaboration that had featured in Delaney & Bonnie's live shows in 1969–70,Reid, p. 74. and \\"A Day Without Jesus\\" was co-written by Whitlock and Don Nix. The record peaked at number 140 on the US Billboard 200 chart, the same magazine praising it as \\"a persuasively powerful first album\\". Whitlock's second solo album, also on ABC-Dunhill Records, was Raw Velvet, released in November 1972. It included appearances by Clapton and Gordon, on \\"Hello L.A., Bye Bye Birmingham\\", although the majority of the album, including another remake of \\"Tell the Truth\\", featured new associates such as guitarist Rick Vito and ex-Van der Graaf Generator bassist Keith Ellis.Whitlock, p. 238. The album was co-produced by Jimmy Miller, whose connection with the Rolling Stones led to Whitlock making an uncredited contribution to the band's Exile on Main St. double album (1972). By this point, Laylas title track had become a hit song, following its release as a single to promote the History of Eric Clapton compilation (1972), leading to a critical reappraisal of Derek and the Dominos and belated commercial success. A 1970-recorded live album, In Concert, was similarly well-received when issued in January 1973. Raw Velvet peaked at number 190 on the Billboard 200, however, and it was Whitlock's last album to place on the chart. Whitlock tried in vain to get Clapton to come out and play; realizing it was not going to happen, after two years of waiting, he went back to the United States. His next solo album was One of a Kind, co- produced with Bill Halverson and released in 1975 on Capricorn Records. Rock Your Sox Off followed in 1976, opening with a new recording of \\"Why Does Love Got to Be So Sad?\\" Whitlock then withdrew from the music industry; he told Mojo contributor Harry Shapiro in 2001: \\"I had my own problems to deal with.\\" Speaking to The Austin Chronicle in 2006, Whitlock said of his retirement, \\"It wasn't hard to stop, because there was nothing going on in music\\", and rued the popularity of disco. =Later career= For much of the 1980s and 1990s, Whitlock lived on a farm in Mississippi, raising his children and doing occasional session work. He had his own television show with Steve Cropper. A rare music release during this period was \\"Put Angels Around You\\", a duet with Scottish singer Maggie Bell, issued as a single in 1983 on Led Zeppelin's Swan Song Records.Listing: \\"Maggie Bell and Bobby Whitlock – Put Angels Around You\\", Discogs (retrieved October 2, 2013). In 1999, Whitlock resumed his solo career with It's About Time, which included contributions from Cropper and saxophonist Jim Horn.Michael B. Smith, \\"Bobby Whitlock It's About Time\\", AllMusic (retrieved September 30, 2013). Michael Smith of AllMusic described the album as \\"one of Whitlock's most intriguing creations yet\\" and a \\"fine set from a musician we haven't heard enough from in recent years\\". In April 2000, Whitlock reunited with Clapton to play live on the BBC's Later... with Jools Holland. The following year, he contributed piano to Sweet Tea by blues guitarist Buddy Guy.\\"Buddy Guy Sweet Tea\\" > Credits, AllMusic (retrieved September 30, 2013). In 2003, Whitlock and his wife, musician CoCo Carmel, collaborated on Other Assorted Love Songs, a live album that again revisited the Dominos' songs, as well as including a cover of Harrison's \\"All Things Must Pass\\".Bruce Eder, \\"Bobby Whitlock & Kim Carmel Other Assorted Love Songs\\", AllMusic (retrieved September 30, 2013). Music critic Bruce Eder praised the album, writing: \\"The classic pieces [from Layla] hold up magnificently ... [H]ere, acoustic guitar and piano are more than sufficient accompaniment and, indeed, coupled with Whitlock's powerful singing and range, make a strong case for these being the definitive versions.\\" Whitlock and Carmel moved to Austin, Texas in 2006. The couple worked with musicians such as David Grissom, Stephen Bruton and Brannen Temple, and special guest Willie Nelson, on the album Lovers (2008)Whitlock, pp. 238–39. and Metamorphosis (2010), another live recording. Released on the Domino label, Lovers included a song that Whitlock had begun writing with Clapton in the early 1970s, \\"Dear Veronica\\", and a remake of \\"Layla\\" that omitted the Gordon-composed piano ending, which Whitlock had never thought suitable for the track.Whitlock, pp. 47, 239.

In 2013, in connection with the release of the latter album, Whitlock and Carmel gave an interview for Tracy Thibodeaux's Pods o' Pop in which he spoke in depth about the formation of Derek and the Dominos, composing with Clapton, and playing on Harrison's All Things Must Pass. In 2010, Bobby Whitlock: A Rock 'n' Roll Autobiography, written with music historian Marc Roberty, was published, with a foreword by Eric Clapton. Whitlock's first two solo albums appeared, remastered, as Where There's a Will, There's a Way: The ABC-Dunhill Recordings, released by Future Day Records in September 2013. In 2015, Bobby Whitlock and Coco Carmel's \\"The Just Us Tour 2015\\" visited the eastern and mid-western United States, using guest guitarists in each city. The tour ended with a performance at The Jass Blues Festival in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

Development Aerial refueling Probe-and-drogue system visible at the forward left side of fuselage The Ilyushin Il-80 has the NATO reporting name Maxdomehttp://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/il-87.htm (though some sources claim it uses the reporting name Camber, like the Il-86 passenger jet). The Russian reporting name for the aircraft is Aimak, or Eimak (Mongolian for \\"clan\\"). The aircraft is believed to have first flown in the summer of 1985, with the first post-modification flight taking place on March 5, 1987, and deliveries starting later that year. In all, four aircraft are known to have been converted from Il-86s They were registered CCCP-86146 through 86149, and were first observed by western photographers in 1992. Heavily modified from the Ilyushin Il-86, the Il-80 (also referred to as the Il-86VKP) is meant to be used as an airborne command center for Russian officials, including the President, in the event of nuclear war. The role of the Ilyushin Il-80 is similar to that of the Boeing E-4B.Rendall, David. Jane's Aircraft Recognition Guide, 2nd edition, 1999. , pg. 154. The Il-80 has no external windows (save those in the cockpit), to shield it from a nuclear blast and nuclear electromagnetic pulse.Taylor, Michael J.H. Brassey's World Aircraft & Systems Directory 1999-2000, 2000. , pg. 156. Only the upper deck forward door on the left and the aft door on the right remain from the standard design. There is only one airstair door, instead of three. An unusual baffle blocks the aft cockpit windows. This may serve to block EMP or RF pulses. Unlike the standard Il-86 airliner, the Il-80 has two electrical generator pods mounted inboard of the engine nacelles. Each pod is approximately 9.5 metres (32 feet) long and 1.3 metres (4 feet) in diameter. Both pods include landing lights. Like the E-4B, the aircraft has a dorsal SATCOM canoe, believed to house advanced satellite communications equipment, and a trailing wire antenna mounted in the lower aft fuselage for very low frequency (VLF) radio transmission and reception (likely for communication with ballistic missile submarines). Replacement When the present upgrades have reached the end of their life, it is expected that a new airborne command post, based on the Ilyushin Il-96-400 commercial aircraft and delivered as the so-called Doomsday plane, will replace them.http://tass.com/defense/1060866 Operation Upon completion, all four Il-80s were delivered to the 8th Special Purposes Aviation Division at the Chkalovsky Airbase near Moscow. As of 2011 three Il-80s remain in service. They are painted in the current livery of Aeroflot, the Russian state airline; and carry international civilian registrations RA-86147, RA-86148, and RA-86149. The first Il-80, registration RA-86146, has been photographed without engines and is apparently out of service. As of 2011 the Il-80s remain based at Chkalovsky Airbase, located northeast of Moscow. The aircraft are rarely observed in operation, though at least one was seen at an air show.

It was discovered in 2005 by Mike Brown and the laser guide star adaptive optics team at the W. M. Keck Observatory, and carried the provisional designation of ' until officially named Dysnomia (from the Ancient Greek word meaning anarchy/lawlessness) after the daughter of the Greek goddess Eris. Dysnomia has an estimated diameter of (25% to 35% of Eris's diameter), and is among the dozen or so largest objects in the trans-Neptunian region.  Discovery  Artist's conception of dwarf planet Eris seen from above the surface of Dysnomia During 2005, the adaptive optics team at the Keck telescopes in Hawaii carried out observations of the four brightest Kuiper belt objects (Pluto, , , and ), using the newly commissioned laser guide star adaptive optics system. Observations taken on September 10, 2005, revealed a moon in orbit around Eris, provisionally designated . In keeping with the Xena nickname that was already in use for Eris, the moon was nicknamed \\"Gabrielle\\" by its discoverers, after Xena's sidekick.  Physical characteristics  Dysnomia has an estimated diameter of with an albedo of . The estimate was obtained using radiometric observation by ALMA observatory in submillimeter spectral region. The same study suggested a wide range of potential masses for the satellite, depending on its actual density, with a system mass ratio anywhere from 37:1 to 115:1 (thus masses of approximately with a minimal density, to for the same density as Eris itself). Although the shape of Dysnomia is not known, it is presumed to have a spherical shape due to its large dimensions; it is larger than the three smallest ellipsoidal moons of Saturn and Uranus (Enceladus, Miranda, and Mimas). In its discovery images Dysnomia was ~60 times fainter (or 4.43 magnitudes) than Eris in the K band, and later observations with the Hubble Space Telescope found it to be 500 times fainter in the visible band. This indicates a very different, and quite redder, spectrum, indicating a significantly darker surface. Its diameter reveals it to be a rather large trans-Neptunian object. Of the known moons of dwarf planets, only Charon is larger than Dysnomia.  Orbit  Combining Keck and Hubble observations, the orbit of Dysnomia was used to determine the mass of Eris through Kepler's third law of planetary motion. Dysnomia's average orbital distance from Eris is approximately , with a calculated orbital period of 15.786 days, or approximately half a month. This shows that the mass of Eris is 1.27 times that of Pluto. Extensive observations by Hubble indicate that Dysnomia has a nearly circular orbit around Eris, with a low orbital eccentricity of . Over the course of Dysnomia's orbit, its distance from Eris varies by due to its slightly eccentric orbit. Dynamical simulations of Dysnomia suggest that its orbit should have completely circularized through mutual tidal interactions with Eris within timescales of 5–17 million years, regardless of the moon's density. The present non-zero eccentricity of Dysnomia implies that its orbit is being perturbed, possibly due to Eris's oblate shape or the presence of an additional satellite of Eris. From Hubble observations from 2005–2018, the inclination of Dysnomia's orbit with respect to Eris's heliocentric orbit is calculated to be approximately 78°. Since the inclination is less than 90°, Dysnomia's orbit is therefore prograde relative to Eris's orbit. In 2239, Eris and Dysnomia will enter a period of mutual events in which Dysnomia's orbital plane is aligned edge-on to the Sun, allowing for Eris and Dysnomia to take turns eclipsing each other.  Formation  Astronomers now know that the six brightest Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) have satellites. Among the fainter members of the belt only about 10% are known to have satellites. This is thought to imply that collisions between large KBOs have been frequent in the past. Impacts between bodies of the order of across would throw off large amounts of material that would coalesce into a moon. A similar mechanism is thought to have led to the formation of the Moon when Earth was struck by a giant impactor early in the history of the Solar System.  Name  Mike Brown, the moon's discoverer, chose the name Dysnomia for the moon. As the daughter of Eris, the mythological Dysnomia fit the established pattern of naming moons after gods associated with the primary body (hence, Jupiter's largest moons are named after lovers of Jupiter, while Saturn's are named after his fellow Titans). Also, the English translation of \\"Dysnomia\\", \\"lawlessness\\", echoes Lucy Lawless, the actress who played Xena in Xena: Warrior Princess on television. Before receiving their official names, Eris and Dysnomia had been nicknamed \\"Xena\\" and \\"Gabrielle\\", though Brown states that the connection was accidental.Mike Brown (2012) How I Killed Pluto and Why It Had It Coming, p. 239 A primary reason for the name was its similarity to the name of Brown's wife, Diane, following a pattern established with Pluto. Pluto owes its name in part to its first two letters, which form the initials of Percival Lowell, the founder of the observatory where its discoverer, Clyde Tombaugh, was working, and the person who inspired the search for \\"Planet X\\". James Christy, who discovered Charon, did something similar by adding the Greek ending -on to Char, the nickname of his wife Charlene. (Christy wasn't aware that the resulting 'Charon' was a figure in Greek mythology.) \\"Dysnomia\\", similarly, has the same first letter as Brown's wife, Diane, and Brown uses the nickname \\"Dy\\" for the moon, which he pronounces the same as his wife's nickname, Di. Because of this, Brown pronounces the full name , with a long \\"y\\" sound.  Notes   References  External links * Moons of dwarf planets Eris (dwarf planet) Discoveries by Michael E.

Jarislowsky, (born September 9, 1925) is a Canadian business magnate, investor, and philanthropist. He is the Founder, Chairman and CEO of Jarislowsky Fraser Limited, which he built into one of the largest and most successful investment management firms in Canada, with over C$40 billion in assets under management.JFL Corporate history His personal wealth was estimated at $1.42 billion in December 2017, making him the 34th richest person in Canada. Biography Jarislowsky was born in Berlin, Germany, the son of Kaethe (née Gassmann) and Alfred Jarislowsky. He is the stepson of a steel mill owner in Germany, who was ousted by the Nazis for harbouring Jews. Jarislowsky emigrated to the United States in 1941 after boarding schools in the Netherlands and France. He came of age and was deeply affected by the Great Depression. In Asheville, North Carolina, he attended the college preparatory school, Asheville School, and then studied mechanical engineering for two years at Cornell University. With the US entry into World War II, he served in the US Army. He finished basic training and studied Japanese at the University of Chicago before serving in counter-intelligence in Japan after the war. He returned to the University of Chicago in 1946 and graduated with an MA in Asian Studies and Phi Beta Kappa Honours. This was followed by a Masters in Business Administration from Harvard Business School in 1949. For the next three years, he worked as an engineer for Alcan Aluminum in Montreal. He briefly returned to the United States, but by June 1955 he returned to Montreal where he started Jarislowsky, Fraser & Company Limited. In 2007, Jarislowsky's firm, which owns 18 percent of the shares of Canfor, was embroiled in a bitter proxy fight with Vancouver-based tycoon Jim Pattison, who owns 25 percent of the company. Pattison won and ousted CEO Jim Shepherd over Canfor's poor performance and declining share price, replacing him for the interim with Jim Shepard.Nathan VanderKlippe, \\"Jimmy Got Mad\\" , Financial Post Business, September 4, 2007 In several magazine and newspaper articles between 2002 and 2004, Jarislowsky correctly predicted the deep economic recession which began in 2008 in the United States and spread around the world. On December 16, 2008, in an interview on CBC's The Current, he opined that the current recession would last at least two to five years and may last much longer if corrective measures are not taken by governments and the general public. He further argued that inflation is the only solution in the circumstances to reducing the enormous debt loads held at all levels of society and that massive and immediate government spending is also needed to stimulate the economy. Personal life He is married and has four children. Jarislowsky is a Companion of the Order of Canada and a Grand Officer (promoted from Knight) of the National Order of Quebec. He has Honorary Doctorates of Law from Canadian universities including McGill University, Queen's University, University of Alberta, McMaster University, Université Laval, Concordia University, the University of Windsor, the Université de Montréal and the University of Ottawa. Criticism and advocacy =Business ethics= Apart from his personal business pursuits, he is an outspoken defender of business ethics (and a critic of ethical breaches). In 2002 he co- founded (with Claude Lamoureux) the Canadian Coalition for Good Governance to further this cause, focusing on such contemporaries as Frank Stronach and Conrad Black for their corporate excesses. =Quebec separatism= Although not involved in politics, Jarislowsky is openly against Quebec nationalism. In 1997, in a speech to the Westmount Municipal Association, Jarislowsky drew comparisons between Parizeau and Bouchard with the fascism of Franco's Spain and Hitler's Nazi Germany and told how, days after the 1995 referendum, he suggested the partition of Quebec and the transformation of Montreal into a City state. In his speech, he stated that his fellow citizens should oppose the PQ which he said, \\"feed on the same kind of quasi religious fervor on which all fascists feed (be it the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany of fascist Italy, etc.) A Parizeau, a Bouchard should never be underestimated and, despite lullabies, should never put one to sleep.\\"Stephen Jarislowsky, Speech to Westmount Municipal Association, May 1997 In 2011, a journalist from La Presse, Denis Lessard, contacted him to discuss his 1997 statements. During the interview, Jarislowsky restated his opinion saying that the independence movement in Québec \\"is still driven by a religious fervour. The people who want the power at any cost will tell you all kind of stories to get it. It is maybe not Nazi... but it is fascist\\" (\\"[Le mouvement] est toujours animé d'une ferveur religieuse. Les gens qui veulent le pouvoir à tout prix vont raconter toutes sortes d'histoires pour l'obtenir. Ce n'est peut être pas nazi... mais c'est fasciste!\\") Following publication of this interview, Jarislowsky withdrew from the 2011 ADQ party congress to which he was invited. =Boards and charities= He was a Director of the influential C.D. Howe Institute and has also been active in numerous other corporations besides his own including SNC-Lavalin, Canfor, Southam, Swiss Bank Corp., Velan Valve Inc., Abitibi and Goodfellow Lumber Inc. He has participated in educational, cultural and charitable activities, and with his wife Gail, to date has endowed numerous eponymous university chairs in Canada including those in Economic and Cultural Transformation (Memorial University), Economic and Financial Policy (Queen's, established 1990), Environment and Health (McMaster, established 2003); Families and Work (Guelph, 2003); Religion and Conflict (Assumption University, Windsor); Public Sector Management (University of Ottawa, 2003); International Business Administration (Laval, 2000); Urology (McGill); Finance (University of Alberta, School of Business); Biotechnology (Saskatchewan, 2004); Technology and International Competition (École Polytechnique de Montréal); History (Concordia); and Public Sector Management (Ottawa, 2005), Water and Global Health (Carleton, 2016). \\"All these chairs are concerned with excellence,\\" he is quoted as saying, \\"something Canadians have never really espoused\\".Rick Spence, \\"The City Builders: Three philanthropists with impact\\" , Corporate Knights, March 25, 2004 Cultural contributions include The Stephen A Jarislowsky Dance Studio in Vancouver, and the Gail and Stephen A.

SPA claims that it is an \\"ecological group dedicated to preserving species' habitats globally and in Australia from the degradation caused by human population growth\\", and that it \\"works on many fronts to encourage informed public debate about how Australia and the world can achieve an ecologically sustainable population\\". SPA argues that population growth exacerbates Australia's water shortage and adds to greenhouse gas emissions. SPA also seeks to highlight what it claims are the negative economic effects of population growth, such as increased housing costs, lower wages and living standards, and opposes the current historically high level of immigration to Australia. Immigration to Australia has averaged around 200,000 per annum over the past decade. It is the highest rate of immigration in the world.

It is distinguished by a spike-like crest which projects up and back from the skull. Saurolophus was a herbivorous dinosaur which could move about either bipedally or quadrupedally. The type species, S. osborni, was described by Barnum Brown in 1912 from Canadian fossils. A second valid species, S. angustirostris, is represented by numerous specimens from Mongolia, and was described by Anatoly Konstantinovich Rozhdestvensky. Discovery and history Photo from the excavation of S. osborni in 1911 Barnum Brown recovered the first described remains of Saurolophus in 1911, including a nearly complete skeleton (AMNH 5220). Now on display in the American Museum of Natural History, this skeleton was the first nearly complete dinosaur skeleton from Canada. It was found in rocks of early Maastrichtian age, in the Upper Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation (then known as the Edmonton Formation) near Tolman Ferry on the Red Deer River in Alberta. Brown wasted little time in describing his material, giving it its own subfamily. Saurolophus was an important early reference for other hadrosaurs, as seen in the names of Prosaurolophus (\\"before Saurolophus\\") and Parasaurolophus (\\"near Saurolophus\\"). However, little additional material has been recovered and described. Instead, more abundant remains from Asia have provided more data. Initial remains were not promising; a partial fragmentary ischium from Heilongjiang, China, that Riabinin named S. kryschtofovici. Much better remains were soon recovered, though, but from Mongolia's early Maastrichtian-age Nemegt Formation. The 1946–1949 Russian-Mongolian paleontological expeditions recovered the large skeleton that became S. angustirostris as described by Anatoly Rozhdestvensky. Other skeletons from a variety of growth stages have also been discovered, and S. angustirostris is now the most abundant Asian hadrosaurid. =Species= A photograph of the panel mount of the holotype of S. osborni, from Barnum Brown, 1913 Two species are regarded as valid today: the type species S. osborni, and S. angustirostris. S. osborni Brown, 1912 is known from a skull and skeleton, two other complete skulls, and skull fragments. S. angustirostris (Rozhdestvensky, 1952) is known from at least 15 specimens. It differs from S. osborni by some details of the skull, as well as in the pattern of scales found in skin impressions. The Mongolian species had a longer skull (by 20%) and the front of the snout (the premaxillary bones) were more upwardly directed. S. angustirostris also had a distinctive row of rectangular scales along the midline of the back and tail, known as 'midline feature-scales'; these are not currently preserved in S. osborni. In S. angustirostris, the scales on the tail flank were arranged in vertical patterns, which may have corresponded to striped coloration in life. This area was covered in radial scale patterns in S. osborni, possibly indicating a more mottled or spotted coloration. S. kryschtofovici Riabinin, 1930 is not considered valid; either it is regarded as a dubious name, or as a synonym of S. angustirostris (although the name antedates S. angustirostris). Restoration of S. angustirostris Until a 2011 reevaluation of the species by Phil R. Bell, S. angustoristris was not well- described. No autapomorphies, unique derived traits, had been established distinguishing it from S. osborni. Bell found in a publication earlier in the year that the two previous studies of S. angustirostris, by Rozhdestvensky in 1952, and Maryanska and Osmolska in 1981, do not provide a comprehensive enough description to compare the species with S. osborni. In 1939–40, two partial skeletons were found in the late Maastrichtian age Moreno Formation of California. These specimens were referred to cf. Saurolophus sp. In 2010, one of the skulls was instead assigned to Edmontosaurus. A 2013 study placed the two specimens in a new species, S. morrisi. In 2014, the species was reassigned to a new genus, Augustynolophus. Description The size of the two Saurolophus species compared to a human Saurolophus is known from material including nearly complete skeletons, giving researchers a clear picture of its bony anatomy. S. osborni, the rarer Albertan species, was around long, with its skull long. It has been estimated to have weighted around . S. angustirostris, the Mongolian species, was larger; it got as large as in length, and larger remains are reported. It has been estimated to have potentially weighed up to . The largest known skull of S.angustirostris measures in length. Aside from size, the two species are virtually identical, with differentiation hindered by lack of study. Restoration of S. osborni The most distinctive feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which is present in young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest is often described as solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that may have had a respiratory and/or heat-regulation function. The unique crest of Saurolophus is made up almost completely by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid. In adult specimens the crests are a rounded triangular shape in cross section. The crest protrudes past the edge of the skull backwards. Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen it. At the end of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently. The holotype of S. angustirostris is a skull and postcrania, so the cranium of the species is well-described. Bell et al. re-evaluated the entire species in a 2011 publication with Acta Palaeontologica Polonica. Their description found the skull to be generalized among hadrosaurines, and are much larger than any skulls of S. osborni. The most unusual feature for a hadrosaurine is the long, protruding, solid crest that extends upwards diagonally from the back of the skull roof. Unlike lambeosaurines, the crests are made up completely of the nasal bone. The premaxilla bones make up almost 50% of the entire skull length, and both sides are filled with small holes. Only in adult individuals has the front of the premaxillary contact been fused. Longer than the premaxilla, the nasal bones are the longest in the skull. They make up the entire length of the crest, and are never preserved as fused. Classification Skull of the holotype specimen of S. osborni Skulls in Moscow Paleontological Museum S. angustirostris skin impressions Barnum Brown, who described the first specimens, put it in its own subfamily in \\"Trachodontidae\\" (=Hadrosauridae), the Saurolophinae. At the time, this also included Corythosaurus and Hypacrosaurus, the only well-known examples of what would become the Lambeosaurinae. Brown thought that Saurolophus had an expanded tip to the ischium bone in the hip, as dinosaurs now recognized as lambeosaurines had, but this appears to have been based on a mistakenly associated lambeosaurine ischium. Additionally, he misinterpreted the crests of Saurolophus and lambeosaurines as being made of the same bones. Most publications before 2010 classified Saurolophus as a member of Hadrosaurinae, often known colloquially as the \\"flat-headed hadrosaurs\\". In 2010, the subfamily Saurolophinae was brought back into use because Hadrosaurus appears to have branched off prior to the \\"hadrosaurine\\"–lambeosaurine split. As a result, Hadrosaurinae by definition cannot include the traditional \\"hadrosaurines\\". Saurolophinae is the oldest available name for the former \\"hadrosaurine\\" clade. Saurolophus, as the name suggests, is a saurolophine, as it has a saurolophine pelvis and a (largely) solid crest. The following cladogram of hadrosaurid relationships was published in 2013 by Alberto Prieto-Márquez et al. in Acta Palaeontologica Polonica: Paleobiology As a hadrosaurid, Saurolophus would have been a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating a variety of plants. Its skull permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing, and its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Its feeding range would have extended from the ground to about above. =Crest function= Skull of S. osborni The distinctive spike-like crest of Saurolophus has been interpreted in multiple ways, and could have had multiple functions. Brown compared it to the crest of a chameleon, and suggested it could provide an area for muscle attachment and a connection point for a nonbody back frill like that seen in the basilisk lizard. Peter Dodson interpreted similar features in other duckbills as having use in sexual identification. Maryańska and Osmólska, noting the hollow base, suggested that the crest increased the surface area of the respiratory cavity, and helped in thermoregulation. James Hopson supported a function as a visual signal, and further mentioned the possibility that the inflatable skin flaps over the nostrils could have acted as resonators and additional visual signals. This idea has been picked up by authors of popular dinosaur works, such as David B. Norman, who discussed hadrosaurid display at length and included a life restoration of such an adaptation in action. =Ontogeny= The cranial ontogeny of Saurolophus angustirostris Though the growth rates of Saurolophus are poorly understood, a group of perinatal Saurolophus was recently discovered in an area of the Gobi Desert known as \\"The Dragon's Tomb\\". The animals uncovered had skull lengths less than five percent of the length of the skulls of the adults, indicating they were in the earliest developmental stage at the time of their deaths The discovery of Saurolophus neonates also indicates the distinct crest found in adults was poorly developed in infancy. It remains unknown if the animals were still within their eggs or if they had hatched before they died. The specimens were described in the journal PLOS One on October 14, 2015 by Leonard Dewaele et al. Paleoecology Restoration of Tarbosaurus pursuing S. angustirostris S. osborni is known only from the upper part (unit 4) of the Horseshoe Canyon Formation. It lived alongside other dinosaur species including the ornithopods Hypacrosaurus altispinus and Parksosaurus warreni, ankylosaurid Anodontosaurus lambei, pachycephalosaurid Sphaerotholus edmontonense, ornithomimids Ornithomimus brevitertius and an unnamed species of Struthiomimus, small theropods including Atrociraptor marshalli and Albertonykus borealis, and the tyrannosauroid Albertosaurus sarcophagus. The dinosaurs from this formation form part of the Edmontonian land vertebrate age. The Horseshoe Canyon Formation is interpreted as having a significant marine influence, due to an encroaching Western Interior Seaway, the shallow sea that covered the midsection of North America through much of the Cretaceous. S. osborni may have preferred to stay inland. A 2001 study suggested that Saurolophus osborni was part of a distinct inland fauna characterized by an association between Anchiceratops ornatus and it, while the contemporary coastal fauna was characterized by the association of Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis and Edmontosaurus regalis.Lehman, T. M., 2001, Late Cretaceous dinosaur provinciality: In: Mesozoic Vertebrate Life, edited by Tanke, D. H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, pp. 310-328. However, the association between S. osborni and Anchiceratops was later noted to be in error, Anchiceratops only occurs lower in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, before the major transgression of the Western Interior Seaway represented by the Drumheller Marine Tongue.Sullivan, R.M. and Lucas, S. G. (2006). \\"The Kirtlandian land-vertebrate \\"age\\"–faunal composition, temporal position and biostratigraphic correlation in the nonmarine Upper Cretaceous of western North America.\\" Pp. 7-29 in Lucas, S. G. and Sullivan, R.M. (eds.), Late Cretaceous vertebrates from the Western Interior. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 35. S. angustirostris was one of the largest herbivores of the Nemegt Formation, which lacked large horned dinosaurs, but had sauropods and a more diverse theropod fauna. It coexisted with the rare hadrosaurid Barsboldia, flat-headed pachycephalosaurian Homalocephale and domed Prenocephale, the large ankylosaurid Saichania, rare saltasaurid sauropods Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia, the alvarezsaurid Mononykus, three types of troodontids including Zanabazar, several oviraptorosaurians including Rinchenia and Nomingia, the ostrich-mimics Gallimimus and Deinocheirus, therizinosaurid Therizinosaurus, tyrannosaurid relative Bagaraatan, and the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus. Unlike other Mongolian formations like the well-known Djadochta Formation that includes Velociraptor and Protoceratops, the Nemegt is interpreted as being well-watered, like the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta. When examined, the rock facies of the Nemegt formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Sediments also indicate that a rich habitat existed, offering diverse food in abundant amounts that could sustain Cretaceous dinosaurs.Novacek, M. (1996). Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs. Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing Group Inc. New York, New York. S. angustirostris was common, and would have been an important large herbivore in the Nemegt Formation. By comparison, S. osborni was rare in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, and faced competition from other duckbills (genus Hypacrosaurus). Comparisons between the scleral rings of Saurolophus and modern birds and reptiles suggest that it may have been cathemeral, active throughout the day at short intervals.

Articles are also available online at the official Daily Trojan web site. The Daily Trojan is produced weekly as the \\"Summer Trojan\\" during the summer session, typically on Wednesdays, from commencement until July. Although the length of the Daily Trojan varies depending on the volume of advertisements, larger issues throughout the semester include the Orientation version, Career Guide, Transportation Guide, and Restaurant Guide. Starting in 2006, at least four pages (two spreads) of the paper are printed in color. Additional color pages vary with each issue. Each currently issue contains a news, opinion, lifestyle and sports section and each section has its own senior editor(s) and staff. The Daily Trojan is an affiliate of UWIRE, which distributes and promotes its content to their network. The paper also publishes all of its articles online, with some publications, such as podcasts and videos, being available online exclusively. History The Daily Southern Californian, Vol. 10, No. 1, February 11, 1913 The first edition of the newspaper was published September 16, 1912, after W.R. “Ralph” La Porte, the first student editor of the paper, persuaded university President George Finley Bovard to give USC a student newspaper. Subscriptions to the paper, then called The Daily Southern Californian, originally cost $1.75. The newspaper was called The Southern Californian in 1915, after it began publishing only four days a week, but returned to five-day-a-week production in 1925 and was redubbed The Daily Trojan, as USC had informally adopted the Trojan as a mascot by then. The newspaper moved from the now-defunct Moneta Print Shop on Jefferson and University Avenues to its current location in the Student Union in 1928. Production was held off-campus until the 1980s in USC's Graphic Services Department, which was located west of the [Harbor Freeway] on Exposition Boulevard. The Daily Trojan increasingly began using computers in the '90s, moving to all-digital production in 2005. Editors create the paper using Adobe InDesign, InCopy, Photoshop, Illustrator and Dreamweaver. The Daily Trojan's first website was created in 1996, and has gone through several iterations. Organization While the university publishes the Daily Trojan, student editors and staff handle all day-to-day operations. Unlike many university newspapers, the Daily Trojan receives no financial support from the university or from student government funding allocations, and is wholly supported by advertising revenue. The Daily Trojan is part of USC's Office of Student Publications, which is part of USC's Division of Student Affairs. The office oversees the publishing of both the Daily Trojan and El Rodeo yearbook.

The stadium was built in 1989 and plays host to Liberty Flames football, which is a part of the NCAA Division I - Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). A new field house has recently been constructed at the north end of the stadium. This new facility houses a new home locker room, coaches offices, meeting rooms and training facility as well as a weight room. In the 2009 off season, Liberty University added a video scoreboard on the north end of the field. The video scoreboard measured tall and wide. This video board was replaced by a massive new high- definition video board in time for the 2018 football season. In September 2011, a ribbon video board was added to the facade of the upper deck. This too was replaced by a state of the art ribbon video board on both the eastern and western facades of the upper deck in 2018. The stadium was named in 1994 to honor Arthur L. Williams, Jr. who is a major contributor to the University. Williams Stadium after the construction of its old scoreboard Expansion Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. announced on August 28, 2009 a three phase addition to Williams Stadium. The plan was to increase the seating capacity of the stadium from 12,000 seats to 30,000. The first phase of the construction included a five story press box and expanded the stadium by 7,200 seats. This was done by adding a second deck to the home side of the stadium and lengthening the east and west stands of the stadium. The seating capacity was 19,200 after phase one was completed. The estimated cost for the first phase of the project was $18 million. The new press tower was ready for Liberty's Oct. 2, 2010 home game against Savannah State. The tower includes 18 luxury suites, all of which were sold for the 2010 season. Phase two has added a second deck to the student side, which has increased capacity to 25,000, beginning with the 2018 football season. The estimated cost for the second phase of the project was $40 million. Phase three will complete a \\"horseshoe\\" around the south end zone, bringing the total capacity to 30,000.

Brush (DD-745) was launched on 28 December 1943 by Bethlehem Steel Co., Staten Island, New York; sponsored by Miss Virginia Perkins, great-granddaughter of Charles Brush; and commissioned on 17 April 1944, Commander J. E. Edwards in command. Service history =World War II= On 30 August 1944 Brush arrived at Pearl Harbor and after training got underway for Eniwetok, Marshall Islands on 28 September. From Eniwetok she escorted convoys to Ulithi and the Palau Islands. Serving with the 5th and 3rd Fleets she took part in the Leyte operation (5 November – 16 December 1944); Luzon-Formosa-China coast-Nansei Shoto strikes (3–22 January 1945); invasion of Iwo Jima and the supporting 5th Fleet raids (15 February – 5 March), and Okinawa operation (17 March – 27 April), including 21 April bombardment of Minami Daito Shima. She retired to Ulithi, Caroline Islands, where she lay 30 April – 10 May before joining the 5th Fleet for the projected invasion of Kyushu, Japan. Brush lay at anchor in Leyte Gulf from 13 June to 1 July 1945 and then departed for a raid on the Japanese island of Hokkaidō. On 22 July Brush and other destroyers of her squadron conducted an anti-shipping sweep near the entrance of Tokyo Bay. She remained in this area on air-sea rescue duty until 14 September when she steamed into Tokyo Bay. On 24 September 1945 she left the Far East for the United States. She arrived at Seattle, Washington, 15 October 1945 and operated along the west coast until early 1946 when she departed for Guam. She remained at Guam until 9 March and then steamed to Tsingtao, China, arriving on the 19th. With the exception of two voyages to the Philippine Islands, she operated in the East China Sea between Tsingtao and Shanghai until January 1947. Brush returned to Guam 18 January 1947 for repairs. Repairs completed 16 February 1947, she sailed to San Diego, via Saipan, Kwajalein, and Pearl Harbor, arriving 24 March. Until May 1950 Brush remained on the west coast participating in local operations, plane guard duties, and type training. =Korea= In May 1950 she was ordered to the Far East and entered Formosan waters as a unit of TF 77 on 29 June 1950. She screened the carrier units during the United Nations air strikes against North Korea and participated in shore bombardment. On 26 September 1950 while shelling the shore off Tanchon, Korea, Brush struck a mine, ripping her midships section and breaking her keel. Thirteen men were killed and 31 injured. Brush received temporary repairs at Japan and returned under her own power to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, arriving on 22 December 1950. Almost a year later Brush departed on her second Korean cruise. She stopped at Pearl Harbor for one month and then joined TF 77 for anti-submarine and anti-aircraft duties off Korea until 25 February 1952. In March Brush was assigned to the Formosan patrol and then participated in hunter-killer exercises off Okinawa. She returned to Japan 12 April and joined the blockade of Korea's west coast with TF's 95 and 77. She returned to San Diego 26 June 1952. Brush operated off the California coast until February 1953 when she commenced her third Korean cruise. She returned to the United States 30 August. Brush conducted seven more Western Pacific deployments over the next decade (4 May – 5 December 1954; 30 June 1955 – 15 February 1956; 31 August 1957 – 1 March 1958; 25 October 1958 – 22 April 1959; 1 January – 28 July 1960; 29 July 1961 – 9 March 1962; 13 March – 1 October 1964), each involving carrier escort, ASW exercises and the occasional Formosa patrol. During the last 1964 deployment, Brush cruised in the Gulf of Tonkin as American intervention in Vietnam escalated. Over the next five years, Brush conducted three Vietnam deployments (20 November 1965 – 13 May 1966; 8 April – 6 October 1967; 20 August 1968 – 4 March 1969), each marked by intensive patrol and gunnery operations in the South China Sea. Fate Brush was decommissioned and stricken from the register on 27 October 1969. She was subsequently sold to Taiwan 9 December 1969, and renamed Hsiang Yang, which was later stricken in 1984 and transferred to Naval Weapons School and then broken up for scrap.

The screenplay was written by Michael Moorcock and James Cawthorn and directed by Kevin Connor. The cast included Doug McClure, John McEnery, Keith Barron, Susan Penhaligon, Anthony Ainley and Declan Mulholland. Plot The movie begins with a bottle with a written manuscript inside it being thrown into the sea, hoping for it to be discovered later. Floating to the coast of England, a sailor discovers the bottle and opens to read the manuscript as Bowen Tyler (Doug McClure) narrates the events, much as we see in many of Edgar Rice Burroughs' novels. The story is set during World War I and involves the survivors of the sinking of a British merchant ship who are taken on board a German U-boat. Bowen Tyler and Lisa Clayton (Susan Penhaligon) are passengers on the ship torpedoed by Captain von Schoenvorts (John McEnery). Along with a few surviving British officers, Tyler convinces the other men to take over the surfacing submarine, this being their only chance for survival. After confronting the Germans on the deck, a fight ensues and they seize the German U-boat. Tyler takes command hoping to sail to a British port. Von Schoenvorts has his crew steer toward a safe sea port. But German officer Dietz (Anthony Ainley) gets loose and smashes the sub's radio. Off course and running out of fuel in the South Atlantic, the U-boat and its crew happen across an uncharted subcontinent called Caprona, a fantastical land of lush vegetation where dinosaurs still roam, co-existing with primitive man. There are also reserves of oil which, if the Germans and British can work together, can be refined and enable their escape from the island. Tyler discovers the secret of Caprona: individuals evolve not through natural selection, but by migrating northward across the island. With the submarine working again, a sudden outbreak of volcanic eruptions occurs across the island. Dietz starts a mutiny and shoots Captain von Schoenvorts to take command. Dietz abandons Tyler and Clayton in Caprona in an attempt to escape, but the U-Boat cannot function in the boiling waters and the crew is killed as it sinks. Tyler and Clayton are stranded and being the only survivors of their group, they are forced to move northward. The movie ends with Tyler throwing the bottle, with the manuscript inside it, as seen in the beginning of the movie.

Then Samuel Z. Arkoff of American International Pictures came on board as co-financers, providing the bulk of the budget, but would only make the film if McClure was cast. He changed his mind and agreed to do the film.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p. 293 Kevin Connor said \\"Doug was a great asset. In fight scenes he was especially good due to his hours of American TV action films. He knew exactly where the camera was at all times and threw punches precisely where the effect would work for the screen. He was always co-operative and came up with many ideas.\\" Shooting began February 1974 and went for 16 weeks. Shepperton Studios were used for filming whilst some of the scenes set in the landscapes of Caprona were filmed in a disused claypit in Reading. Kevin Connor recalled, \\"The reason we went for the hand puppets was for a more fluid look. Roger Dicken, who created the dinosaurs did such fine details and had the movement down so well that we went with him and used that technique. Also, we developed the use of a small VistaVision camera to shoot the dinosaur back-ground plates which gave us great quality because the exposed frame is twice the size of a normal 35mm. Everything was shot front projection as well.\\" The U-boat and ships were models and the dinosaurs and other prehistoric animals were puppets, hand-held or on strings rather than stop motion. The speaking part of Von Schoenvorts was later dubbed in post-production by German-born actor Anton Diffring. Amicus was to make two more Burroughs adaptations, The People That Time Forgot (1977), a direct sequel to this film starring Patrick Wayne, Sarah Douglas and McClure in an appearance midway to towards the end and At the Earth's Core (1976), with McClure (in a different role), Peter Cushing, and Caroline Munro. All three films were distributed in the United States by American International Pictures Reception The Land That Time Forgot was met with mixed reviews from critics and audiences, earning a Rotten Tomatoes approval rating of 50%. The New York Times noted the film is \\"an initially agreeable picture about the discovery of a mystery realm where various stages of evolution coexist,\\" but \\"the early virtues of \\"Land\\" collapse once the island is reached and the traffic jam in artificial monsters develops.\\"Anon (August 14, 1975). \\"The Land That Time Forgot\\", The New York Times.

He was a minor upon his succession, and was under a regency until 1354. His actual rule was short, for he died in an outbreak of plague the next year. His reign was marked by civil war. Birth and succession Born in Catania, Louis was the son of King Peter II and Elisabeth of Carinthia. On the day of his birth, his father announced him as his heir in a proclamation to the municipal governments (universitates) of the realm. Louis was the first male child of Peter since the death of the firstborn, Frederick, in 1325. On 12 February, Peter issued a privilege to the city of Catania exempting it from the payment of the customary hospitality to the royal court. He also credited the intervention of Catania's patron saint, Agatha, on whose feast the child was born, for the successful delivery of a boy. Louis was only four years old when his father died on 15 August 1342, and he was not immediately given the title of king. His uncle, Marquis John of Randazzo, already Peter's second-in-command as vicar, assumed the regency. During his father's lifetime, Louis was called primogenitus (first born) and infans (royal prince, i.e. infante). After his father's death and before his own coronation, he was titled successor. On 10 September John ordered the citizens of Palermo to nominate their representatives to swear the oath of fealty at Louis's coronation. Louis was crowned in the cathedral of Palermo on 15 September and thereafter he bore the title of king (rex). Early reign After his coronation, Louis lived at Catania from October 1342 until at least March 1343. Towards the end of 1344 negotiations were begun to marry Louis to Constance, the newborn daughter of Peter IV of Aragon. In June 1346 an ambassador from Louis I of Hungary arrived proposing a marriage between Louis and one of the Hungarian king's relatives. On 7 November 1347 Sicily concluded a peace treaty at Catania with the Kingdom of Naples, which claimed the island of Sicily. The latter's independence was preserved, but Louis was required to take the title king of \\"Trinacria\\", an ancient name for Sicily. The treaty never received the necessary ratification of Pope Clement VI. After the death of John of Randazzo on 3 April 1348, the regency passed by his testament to Blasco II de Alagona, a Catalan nobleman who was already the grand justiciar and had been John's lieutenant since October 1342. In May 1348 Louis was residing in Messina when he confirmed the succession of John's son Frederick to the duchies of Athens and Neopatria and the marquisate of Randazzo. Civil war Louis was at the castle of Montalbano Elicona in November 1348, when Matteo Palizzi took over his guardianship =Guardianship of Palizzi= In the first half of June 1348, Count Matteo Palizzi returned from exile in Pisa. This act spurred the rivalry between the local Sicilian nobility (the families of Chiaramonte, Palizzi and Scaloro degli Uberti) and that of Catalan origin (the families of Peralta, Alagona and Ventimiglia), which eventually degenerated into civil war. The Sicilian families are sometimes called filoangioini (pro-Angevin, the house that ruled Naples) and the Catalans filoaragonesi (pro-Aragonese). Initially, Blasco sent Louis to Catania, but the court stopped at Taormina early in November and then moved to the castle of Montalbano Elicona. From there the queen mother made contact with Matteo, who was at Messina, and made him guardian of the young king. By the end of the year, open warfare had broken out between the two camps. Louis's movements can be traced during the period of civil war, in which his mother sided with the pro-Angevin (Neapolitan) party. He was at Lentini from late March through April 1349 and at Augusta in May and early June. Around this time, between May and July, the queen mother died and her role was taken up by Louis's older sister, the abbess Constance. From late June through July Louis was with the army besieging Catania. By 22 July Louis had returned to Lentini. In September and October he was at Castrogiovanni, in November at Agira and in December at Messina. An armistice was signed on 10 September 1350 in the king's presence. Both parties agreed to suspend hostilities until the king attained his majority and could judge the dispute. On 23 February 1352, after Louis had turned fourteen, Matteo pushed him to write a letter to the people of Catania declaring his intention to begin his personal rule. Blasco denounced the letter and sent ambassadors to Louis's court on 22 August. Peace was finally concluded in October. =Vicariate of Constance= On 9 June 1353 Louis left Messina in the company of the Chiaramonte, his supporters, to put down the revolt of Castroreale. At Taormina he received the homage of Count Enrico Rosso, who nevertheless refused to help him put down the revolt. On 13 June the king was on the plain of Milazzo, but he had soon returned to Taormina, where the Chiaramonte prevented him from meeting with the nominal regent, Blasco, in spite of the accord that he been reached through the intervention of his sister Constance, who was also with him. By the end of June he had returned to Messina to attend the burial of his brother John (died 22 June) in the cathedral there. Support for the king had been slipping among his erstwhile allies, and on 17 July a popular riot in the city of Messina opened the gates to the armed forces of Enrico Rosso and Count Simone Chiaramonte. They demanded that Louis hand over his guardian, Matteo Palizzi, which he refused on 19 July. The palace was invaded but, while Matteo was found and killed, the king escaped. He boarded a Catalan ship and on 29 July arrived at Catania, where he joined his new allies under Blasco de Alagona. The king moved into the Castello Ursino. On 2 October, Louis and Blasco led a force against Milazzo, but were repulsed and retreated to Catania on 24 October. On 8 November Louis declared the Chiaramonte traitors. A royal charter from 10 November indicates that at some point the office of vicar was transferred to Constance. Louis's subsequent attempts to break out from Catania were failures. On 15 November he entered the fortress at Agira and then moved on to Calascibetta, but he could not take Castrogiovanni and was forced to return to the safety of Catania by 28 November. A few days later he ventured to Taormina, but had returned to Catania by 4 December. Neapolitan invasion and death In April 1354, the Neapolitans, with Grand Seneschal Niccolò Acciaiuoli at the head of a small fleet, invaded Sicily and subjugated Palermo and most of the interior in alliance with the Chiaramonte and the other filoangioini families. Only Catania and Messina remained under Louis's control, that is, with the Catalan (filoaragonese) faction. Fortunately for Louis, the new Neapolitan king, Louis I, refused to provide the required reinforcements and supplies to maintain the invasion. In May the king of Sicily (Trinacria) sent an ambassador to Naples to protest the invasion. On 4 June he sent out an embassy to Peter IV of Aragon to request assistance. The castle of Aci, where Louis died In June Louis rehabilitated the Ventimiglia family, old rivals of the Chiaramonte, and restored them to the office of chamberlain. In November he personally led the force that reconquered Piazza Armerina. He followed up his success with further actions in the westernmost Sicilian province, the Val di Mazara, occupying Cammarata and Trapani. During late December and early January he was in Calatafimi. Only the town of Castronovo continued to resist in the province. On 7 January 1355 Louis was in Giuliana, but he returned to Catania in February. From there he and the Alagona launched an assault against Lentini on 13 May, but the siege of the town had to be lifted in mid-June. On 10 July an epidemic of bubonic plague broke out at Catania and the king left for Messina. From Messina Louis led a naval and land campaign against Palermo, but succeeded only in devastating the countryside. By September he was able to return to Catania. He was struck by the plague, moved to Aci, a castle belonging to the recently deceased Frederick of Randazzo. There he died on 16 October, only seventeen years of age. That same night his body was moved to the church of Santa Maria la Grande outside the walls of Catania. The next day (17 October) his funeral procession passed through the streets to the cathedral of Sant'Agata, where his body was placed in the same tomb as his grandfather, Frederick II (III), and uncle, John of Randazzo. Although marriage negotiations had languished since his accession, Louis did leave two illegitimate sons, Antonio (Anthony) and Luigi (Louis), who were sent to Barcelona to be raised by their aunt Eleanor, queen of Aragon. On 10 October 1355, days before his death, Eleanor had written to Louis to reopen the negotiations for his marriage to Constance, her stepdaughter. Negotiations were apparently also underway for the hand of a daughter of Matteo II Visconti, ruler of Milan, and for the hand of the King of Naples's niece Margaret of Durazzo, ten years Louis's junior.

Reign With the help of the Ethiopian defector Harb Jaush, who also served as a commander under his brother Sabr ad-Din II, Jamal ad-Din was able to defeat the armies of the Ethiopian Emperor in three important battles in Bale, at Yedaya, and at Jazja, although he was eventually defeated. Jamal ad-Din sent an envoy to arrange peace at the beginning of his reign, but the effort failed and Harb Jaush engaged and was able to overcome the Emperor's troops, reportedly including 7,000 archers and swordsmen. Yeshaq responded by gathering a larger army and occupying Yedaya before being repulsed by Jamal ad-Din's forces. His army then took Jazja, although here, too, Jamal ad-Din was able to successfully counter- attack and force the imperial army to withdraw, allowing the forces of the Adalite Sultan to pillage the region over the next three months. Following this success, he organized another successful attack against the Emperor's forces and inflicted heavy casualties in what was reportedly the largest Adalite army ever fielded. As a result, Yeshaq was forced to withdraw toward the Blue Nile over the next five months, while Jamal ad-Din's forces pursued them, while looting much gold on the way, although no engagement ensued. After returning home, the Sultan sent his brother Ahmad with Harb Jaush to successfully attack the Ethiopian province of Dawaro. Despite his losses, the Emperor Yeshaq was able to continue to field armies against the Walashmas. After another campaign by Jamal ad-Din against the Ethiopian frontier, Yeshaq sent his forces to attack three different areas of Adal, threatening the capital and seat of the ruling Walashma family. Jamal ad-Din was forced to return to Adal where he fought Yeshaq's forces at Harjai, where his soldiers were defeated. According to al-Maqrizi, Yeshaq was said to have died during this battle, although it is not mentioned in the Ethiopian Royal Chronicles of Yeshaq.Pankhurst, Ethiopian Borderlands, p.58.

Built in 1772, it is the second-oldest surviving house in Watertown (after the Browne House, built c. 1698), and served as the meeting place for the Massachusetts Provincial Congress in the first year of the American Revolutionary War. Now owned by the local historic society, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description The Edmund Fowle House is located northeast of Watertown Square, on the south side of Marshall Street between Spring and Mount Auburn Streets. It is a two-story wood-frame structure, with a hip roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. It has a five-bay front facade, with a center entrance sheltered by a projecting enclosed flat-roofed vestibule. The vestibule entry is flanked by sidelight windows and framed by fluted moulding. History The house was built by Edmund Fowle (1747–1821) in 1772, and was originally located on Mount Auburn St., then called Mill St. Watertown was the seat of Massachusetts Provincial Congress, its de facto government, during the British occupation of Boston in the American Revolution. The committees of the 2nd and 3rd Provincial Congress met in this house from April 22 to July 19, 1775, and the Executive Committee met here from July 19, 1775, to September 18, 1776. In 1776 the Treaty of Watertown, the first treaty signed between the newly formed United States of America and a foreign power, the St. John's and Mi'kmaq First Nations of Nova Scotia, was signed in this house. Sturgis and Brigham Architects (Charles Brigham and John Hubbard Sturgis) purchased the house in 1871, moved it to its present Marshall St. address and converted it into a two family residence. The Historical Society of Watertown purchased the house in 1922. The Historical Society was awarded $500,000 in 2004 and another $200,000 in 2006 by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for the restoration of the Edmund Fowle House.

The stratigraphic interval of Shantungosaurus ranges from the top of the Xingezhuang Formation to the middle of the Hongtuya Formation, middle to late Campanian in age. Shantungosaurus is so far the largest hadrosauroid taxon in the world: the greatest length of its femur is about , and the greatest length of its humerus is about . Description Size comparison of several large hadrosauriformes, Shantungosaurus in red Shantungosaurus giganteus is one of the largest known ornithischians. The type skull is long, and the composite skeleton mounted at the Geological Institute of China in Beijing measures in length. Another mounted skeleton, originally referred to as Zhuchengosaurus maximus, measures in length. The largest individuals may have weighed as much as . Like all hadrosaurs its beak was toothless, but its jaws were packed with around 1,500 tiny chewing teeth. A large hole near its nostrils may have been covered by a loose flap of skin, which could be inflated to make sounds. Discovery and species Restoration First described in 1973,C.-C. Hu. 1973. [A new hadrosaur from the Cretaceous of Chucheng, Shantung]. Acta Geologica Sinica 1973(2):179-206 Shantungosaurus is known from over five incomplete skeletons. Chinese scientist Xing Xu and his colleagues indicate that Shantungosaurus is very similar to and shares many unique characters with Edmontosaurus, forming an Asian node of an Edmontosaurus–Shantungosaurus clade, based on the new materials recovered in Shandong. Remains of several individuals, including skull bones, limb bones, and vertebrae, were found in Shandong, China. These specimens were classified in the new genus and species Zhuchengosaurus maximus in 2007. However, further study showed that the supposedly distinct features of Zhuchengosaurus were simply a result of different growth stages.Ji, Y., Wang, X., Liu, Y., and Ji, Q. (2011). \\"Systematics, behavior and living environment of Shantungosaurus giganteus (Dinosauria: Hadrosauridae).\\" Acta Geologica Sinica (English Edition), 85(1): 58-65. Sacrum once classified as Huaxiaosaurus Recent maximum parsimony-based phylogenetic analyses of Hadrosauroidea from Xing and colleagues recovered a stable sister group relationship between Edmontosaurus and Shantungosaurus. Shantungosaurus is the single hadrosaurid from the Zhucheng area that is considered valid. Zhuchengosaurus and Huaxiaosaurus, both of which are known from the same region, have been interpreted by the analyses as junior synonyms of Shantungosaurus. All unequivocal morphological discrepancies among these three taxa could be attributed to intraspecific variation (ontogenetic and polymorphic variation) and post-depositional distortion. = Classification = The following cladogram is the result of Prieto-Márquez et al. in 2016.

It clarifies a minor ambiguity problem of the marching cubes algorithm with some cube configurations. It was originally introduced in 1991.Akio Doi, Akio Koide. \\"An Efficient Method of Triangulating Equi-Valued Surfaces by Using Tetrahedral Cells.\\" IEICE Transactions of Information and Systems, Vol.E74-D No. 1, 1991 While the original marching cubes algorithm was protected by a software patent, marching tetrahedrons offered an alternative algorithm that did not require a patent license. More than 20 years have passed from the patent filing date (June 5, 1985), and the marching cubes algorithm can now be used freely. Optionally, the minor improvements of marching tetrahedrons may be used to correct the aforementioned ambiguity in some configurations. In marching tetrahedra, each cube is split into six irregular tetrahedra by cutting the cube in half three times, cutting diagonally through each of the three pairs of opposing faces. In this way, the tetrahedra all share one of the main diagonals of the cube. Instead of the twelve edges of the cube, we now have nineteen edges: the original twelve, six face diagonals, and the main diagonal. Just like in marching cubes, the intersections of these edges with the isosurface are approximated by linearly interpolating the values at the grid points. Adjacent cubes share all edges in the connecting face, including the same diagonal. This is an important property to prevent cracks in the rendered surface, because interpolation of the two distinct diagonals of a face usually gives slightly different intersection points. An added benefit is that up to five computed intersection points can be reused when handling the neighbor cube. This includes the computed surface normals and other graphics attributes at the intersection points. Each tetrahedron has sixteen possible configurations, falling into three classes: no intersection, intersection in one triangle and intersection in two (adjacent) triangles. It is straightforward to enumerate all sixteen configurations and map them to vertex index lists defining the appropriate triangle strips. Comparison with marching cubes Marching tetrahedra computes up to nineteen edge intersections per cube, where marching cubes only requires twelve. Only one of these intersections cannot be shared with an adjacent cube (the one on the main diagonal), but sharing on all faces of the cube complicates the algorithm and increases memory requirements considerably. On the other hand, the additional intersections provide for a slightly better sampling resolution. The number of configurations, determining the size of the commonly used lookup tables, is much smaller, since only four rather than eight separate vertices are involved per tetrahedron. There are six tetrahedra to process instead of one single cube. The process is unambiguous, so no additional ambiguity handling is necessary. The downside is that the tessellation of a cube with tetrahedra requires a choice regarding the orientation of the tetrahedra, which may produce artificial \\"bumps\\" in the isosurface because of interpolation along the face diagonals. Diamond Lattice Cell - Alternative Cube Slicing Method The cubical cells to be meshed can also be sliced into 5 tetrahedra, using a (Diamond cubic) lattice as a basis. Cubes are mated on each side with another that has an opposite alignment of the tetrahedron around the centroid of the cube. Alternating vertices have a different number of tetrahedra intersecting on it, resulting in a slightly different mesh depending on position. When sliced this way, additional planes of symmetry are provided; having a tetrahedron around the centroid of the cube also generates very open spaces around points that are outside of the surface. Visualization diamond cubic Diamond cubic has a variety of visualizations. Instead of empty cells, every cell should be filled, with alternating inner tetrahedrons. For each tetrahedron inscribed in a cube, using the vertices of the cube and edges that cross the faces of the cube, the tetrahedron will occupy 4 points; the other 4 points form the corners of an inverted tetrahedron; the cubic cells are tiled such that the position of the cell (x+y+z+...) is odd, use one, else use the inverted; otherwise near cells would use a different diagonal to compute the intersection. Illustration of inverted inner Diamond Crystal Lattice cells Calculation of color based on a spacial texture system can be done using the current fragment position to select from a repeating texture based on the pairs of Texel_(graphics) coordinates (x,y), (y,z) and (x,z) and scaling those values by the absolute value of each respective component of the normal z, x, and y respectively. Texture decalling can be applied as Texture_splatting by projecting the position of the current fragment in the direction of the decal' normal, to the plane of the texture given by an origin point and normal, then using a 'up' or 'right' directional vector to compute the texture coordinate. This technique would be more closely compared with dual contouring which is listed under Isosurface, as a potential technique. DCL tetrahedra involves additional calculations for the diagonals across cube-faces, where dual contouring does not. This technique also has not addressed when two near points 'inside' a surface are a combined distance < 1 from the surface, where they should generate two points on the edge instead of 1; the related modification is Manifold Dual Contouring .

The flag was designed by Roy E. Silent and E.S. Jones in 1931 for the Los Angeles sesquicentennial from 1781. The flag evokes mixed reactions, with some disliking the design, and some praising it. Design and symbolism The three colors on the flag represent olive trees (green), orange groves (gold) and vineyards (red). They also symbolize the history of the city, with gold and red representing Spain, the country who first settled in the city and green and red representing Mexico, who took over when New Spain achieved independence. The city seal is shown in the center of the flag. Surrounding the shield are representations of three major Californian crops: grapes, olives, and oranges. The seal contains a heraldic shield quartered showing: # an approximation of the shield shown on the Great Seal of the United States, though the blue chief features thirteen stars; # an approximation of the flag of California; # an approximation of the coat of arms of Mexico; # a tower and lion of the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of León, representing the arms of Spain. History The flag, designed by Roy E. Silent and E.S. Jones, was presented to the city by the La Fiesta Association for the city's sesquicentennial anniversary. The seal on the flag was officially adopted on March 27, 1905. The flag received brief international prominence when, during the closing of the 1980 Moscow Olympics, it was raised instead of the United States flag as a symbol of the next Olympic host. The move was done upon the request of the United States government, which asked the International Olympic Committee to not use the American flag, because the U.S. had boycotted the Moscow Olympics. \\"Games end, boycott debate continues\\", Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, August 4, 1980, p9 A Los Angeles flag was taken to space in 1984 by Sally Ride, on the Space Shuttle Challenger. It is on display in the Los Angeles City Hall. In a 2004 North American Vexillological Association survey, the design ranked 33rd out of 150 American city flags.

A similar figure appears in the paintings of the Matriculation of the Aztecan tribute and in the Mendocino Codex. This coat of arms was first published in 1941 in the Municipal Gazette of Tuxtla Gutiérrez and in the book Tuchtlan: Documents and unpublished information for the particular history of Tuxtla Gutiérrez, written by Castañón Gamboa. From 1941 to 1996, the design of the coat of arms of Tuxtla Gutiérrez was modified six times without being actually adopted by the official approval of the city council. At first, the figure of the rabbit appeared inside a shield according to the classic form of royal Spanish blazons; the form was later modified. The coat of arms of Tuxtla was used more as a logo of the city government than as an emblem of the city or area itself. In a regular town hall session on 20 June 1996, the city council announced a competition in which the people of Tuxtla would compete in redesigning the coat of arms. Painters, writers and historians judged the 57 participant sketches and chose the winner: a sketch done by a young boy named Luis Ernesto Moran Villatoro. The coat of arms was adopted officially on 23 December of that same year. Interpretation of the blazons The border of the shield is gold (heraldic yellow). The field (background area of the shield) is heraldic red. The figure of the grey rabbit in the field above the jawbone symbolizes the abundance of rabbits. The figure of the upper jawbone with three teeth (also grey) symbolizes an area of abundance. Together, the two figures signify the place of an abundance of rabbits (Tochtlan in Náhuatl), a name that the Mexicas gave to the valley surrounding the zoque settlement which was characterized for its abundance of rabbits. Thus the coat of arms actually corresponds to its toponomy, bringing to mind its indigenous origin in a distinct departure from European heraldry norms.

The two stories are Shadowplay: The Secret Team by Alan Moore and Bill Sienkiewicz, and Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing documented by Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan and adapted by Joyce Brabner and Tom Yeates. Brought to Light was edited overall by Joyce Brabner, Catherine Yronwode acted as executive editor, and Eclipse publisher Dean Mullaney was the publication designer. Both stories were based upon research by the Christic Institute, who initiated the work. Shadowplay: The Secret Team Shadowplay: The Secret Team was written by Alan Moore and drawn by Bill Sienkiewicz, with an introduction by Daniel Sheehan (general counsel of TCI). It covers the history of the Central Intelligence Agency and its involvement in the Vietnam War, the Iran-Contra affair, and its relationship with figures like Augusto Pinochet and Manuel Noriega. The narrator of Shadowplay is an aging anthropomorphic American Eagle, a bellicose, retired CIA agent. There were rumors that Moore was unable to travel to America due to the CIA being annoyed at his story in Brought to Light. However, the real reason was Moore not renewing his passport.Beaton, Frank. \\"Snake Charmer: An Interview with Alan Moore,\\" part II , NinthArt (April 7, 2003). The story of \\"Shadowplay\\" is of an unseen character in a bar, where he is approached by a man-sized, walking, talking eagle. The eagle, from the emblem of the CIA, proceeds to drink alcohol and, in a drunken stupor, divulge all the details of The Agency's past. Early on a reference is made to the number of gallons an Olympic swimming pool can hold, and the fact that an adult human body has one gallon of blood; from then on, the victims of CIA activities (directly or indirectly) are quantified in swimming pools filled with blood, with each pool representing 20,000 dead. =Shadowplay spoken word= Shadowplay was made into a spoken word performance with Alan Moore and released on an audio compact disc () by Codex Books in 1998. The narrative for the production is performed by Moore himself, in character, set to music by the composer Gary Lloyd who also collaborated on a similar narrative/music performance piece with Scottish author Iain Banks. Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing Flashpoint: The LA Penca Bombing is written by Joyce Brabner, as told to her by Christic Institute clients Martha Honey and Tony Avirgan. It deals with the La Penca bombing which happened during the civil war in Nicaragua in 1984.

Moore (DD-747) was laid down on 30 September 1943 by Bethlehem Mariners Harbor Shipbuilding Yard, Staten Island, New York and launched on 23 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Samuel N. Moore. The ship was commissioned on 24 June 1944, Commander Horatio A. Lincoln in command. Service history = World War II = Following shakedown off Bermuda, the new destroyer steamed, via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, to the Pacific war zone, arriving at Ulithi on 3 November 1944. There she joined the Fast Carrier Task Force and defended Vice Admiral Marc Mitscher's aircraft carriers from enemy aircraft and submarines. The carriers that she guarded launched numerous air strikes against Japanese positions in the Philippines, the Ryukyus, Formosa, the Pescadores, Indochina, China, and the Japanese home islands. She was damaged by a typhoon on 5 June 1945. In an attack on the night of 22 and 23 July, she launched torpedoes at enemy shipping off the east entrance to Sagami Wan, Japan. She rescued one aviator on 10 June and two more on 18 July. After Japan capitulated, Samuel N. Moore aided occupation forces, visiting Shanghai and Tsingtao, China, and Pusan, Korea. From 1947 into 1950, she operated off the west coast. Departing San Diego on 1 May 1950, she steamed to the western Pacific. = Korean War = In response to North Korea invading South Korea, she headed north from Hong Kong on 27 June. During the summer and fall, she served off Korea, before returning to San Diego on 11 February 1951. Sailing again for the Far East on 1 December, she guarded carriers and bombarded enemy shore installations in Korea from February to May 1952 before returning to San Diego on 26 June. Steaming from Long Beach on 2 February 1953, she returned to Korea. Defending the fast carriers again, she visited Koje Island in March. In April, she aided the defense of Yang-do Island and patrolled near Chongjin; in May, she fought enemy shore batteries at Wonsan Harbor. In June, she patrolled the Taiwan Strait; and, in July, she provided shore bombardment off Korea. After the end of fighting in Korea, she returned to Long Beach, California on 30 August. Departing Long Beach on 4 May 1954, she cruised with antisubmarine forces in the western Pacific; patrolled Taiwan Strait, and visited the Tachen Islands on 19 August, before returning to Long Beach on 5 December. From 1955 through 1959, she made annual deployments to the western Pacific, visiting the Philippines, Taiwan, and Japan. In 1960 and 1961, she served with a specialized antisubmarine task force in the western Pacific, before conducting operations off the West Coast in 1962 and 1963. = Vietnam = From 13 March to 2 October 1964, Samuel N. Moore was away from Long Beach on another deployment to the western Pacific. In August, during the crisis following the Gulf of Tonkin incident, Samuel N. Moore supplied ammunition to the destroyer , and transferred documents from Maddox and to . Sailing from the West Coast for the western Pacific on 28 September 1965, she provided gunfire support off Vietnam, operated as a plane guard in the South China Sea, and fired on targets in the Mekong Delta, before returning to Long Beach on 8 April. Getting underway again for the western Pacific on 28 March 1967, she patrolled off North Vietnam, as part of Operation Sea Dragon, and protected aircraft carriers in the Tonkin Gulf, before arriving at Long Beach on 20 September. Underway from Long Beach to the western Pacific on 18 July 1968, she again conducted several shore bombardments and guarded carriers in the Tonkin Gulf before returning to Long Beach on 26 February 1969. In April, she became a Naval Reserve training ship at Tacoma, Washington. Decommissioned on 24 October, she was struck from the Navy list that day. Samuel N. Moore received five battle stars for World War II, three battle stars for Korea, and seven battle stars for Vietnam. Taiwan She was sold in December 1969 to the Republic of China. The ship served in the Republic of China Navy as Heng Yang (DD-2). By 1986 Heng Yang, by now carrying the pennant number D976, underwent the Tien Shi modification, with the ship's aft 5-inch mount and 3-inch anti-aircraft guns were removed, allowing six Hsiung Feng I anti-ship missiles in two triple mounts and two twin 40-mm anti-aircraft mounts to be added. She later had a quadruple Sea Chaparral surface-to-air missile launcher added, and changed pennant number to D902. She was stricken in May 1995.

Tokely previously played for Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Ross County and Brora Rangers as a right back. Tokely joined Inverness from Highland League club Huntly in 1996 and remained at the club until June 2012, for a total of 16 seasons at the Inverness club. Tokely was ICT's longest serving player and currently holds their appearance record. He also holds the distinction of having played and scored in every division of Scottish league football, from Third Division to the SPL, for Inverness. Playing career =Inverness= Tokely was born in Aberdeen. He was signed to Inverness Caledonian Thistle by manager Steve Paterson and made his first appearance in the side that won the Third Division title in 1997. Tokely gradually established himself in the side, usually playing at right back, although he has sometimes played in central defence or as a holding midfielder. Tokely retained his place in the team as Inverness progressed through the Third Division and Second Division to the First Division. Tokely also had more positive successes during this period, notably a fantastic goal against his boyhood heroes Hearts in the 2002 Scottish Cup. Tokely hit a 20-yard shot into the top corner at Tynecastle as Inverness defeated another SPL club in the cup, having won 3–1 at Celtic Park in 2000. Tokely also scored the winning penalty in a shoot-out against Dunfermline Athletic in the following season's League Cup. Tokely was part of the squad that won promotion to the SPL in 2004, by winning the First Division title. As Inverness moved into the SPL, he retained his spot in the side, being awarded the number 2 jersey. After 10 years of service to the club, Tokely was awarded a testimonial match against Sheffield United. Tokely on stage as the Inverness team celebrate winning the First Division title in May 2010 at the Caledonian Stadium Throughout their five-year stint in the top league, Tokely was an established player in the side. His longest spell out of the team came in 2007, when he missed a month of first team action after being sent off for an off the ball punch on Motherwell player Steven McGarry. As the Highland club unsuccessfully battled against relegation in 2009, manager Terry Butcher joked that he wanted his side to achieve more league points than Tokley's total of disciplinary points. Tokely racked up further disciplinary points as he was sent off for a professional foul on the final day of the season against Falkirk. Inverness went on to lose the decisive match 1–0, and were consequently relegated. Nonetheless, Tokely retained his place in the Inverness side after their drop back down to the First Division, helping the club gain promotion straight back to the SPL in 2010. He was made captain of the team for his 500th appearance for Inverness, a 1–0 win against Airdrie United. Tokely agreed a new contract with Inverness in June 2010, despite receiving offers from overseas. In May 2012, he rejected a contract offer from Inverness and ended his 16-year career with the club. =Ross County= On 7 June 2012, Tokely signed for Ross County on a one-year contract. =Brora Rangers= Tokely joined Brora Rangers as a player/coach in January 2013. On Saturday 5 October Brora drew 1–1 with league rivals Cove Rangers, but went on to beat them 3–0 away from home in the Scottish Cup, flying high in the Highland League, Brora were favourites to beat Clyde in the 2nd round but lost 2–1 at Broadwood. In 2013–14 Brora won the Highland League for the first time in their history - by twenty-clear-points. They also won the North Of Scotland Cup for the fourth time when they beat Elgin City in the 2014–15 final. On 26 July 2014, Brora knocked Stenhousemuir out of the Challenge Cup after extra- time 3–1, Alex Sutherland hat-trick, to be beaten by East Fife in the second round 3–1. Ross Tokely playing for St. Duthus FC =St Duthus= Midway through the 2018–19 season, Tokely made a return to senior football when he joined Tain based North Caledonian League club St Duthus. Coaching career Tokely was appointed Brora Rangers manager in December 2016. Brora knocked SPFL clubs Stranraer and East Fife out of the 2017–18 Scottish Cup, before eventually losing to Premiership club Kilmarnock in the fifth round (last 16). They had poorer results in the 2017–18 Highland Football League, however, and Tokely left the club near the end of the season. Tokely returned to Inverness to become their Youth Team coach.

The screenplay was written by Eric Ambler and Peter Ustinov. The film stars David Niven, Stanley Holloway and William Hartnell along with an ensemble cast of other British actors, including Ustinov in one of his earliest roles. The Way Ahead follows a group of civilians who are conscripted into the British Army and, after training, are shipped to North Africa where they are involved in a battle against the Afrika Korps. Plot In the days after the Dunkirk evacuation in the Second World War, recently commissioned Second Lieutenant Jim Perry (Niven), a pre- war Territorial private soldier, is posted to the (fictional) Duke of Glendon's Light Infantry, known as the \\"Dogs\\", to train replacements to fill its depleted ranks. He is joined by Sergeant Ned Fletcher (Hartnell), a veteran of the British Expeditionary Force. A patient, mild-mannered officer, Perry does his strenuous best to turn the bunch of grumbling ex-civilians into soldiers, earning himself their intense dislike. The conscripts also believe that the sergeant is treating them with special severity; in fact, he is pleased with the way they are developing and has his eye on some of them as potential NCOs. Eventually, however, the men come to respect both sergeant and officer. After completing their training, the battalion is shipped out to North Africa to face Rommel's Afrika Korps, but their troopship is torpedoed en route, and they are forced to abandon ship. Sergeant Fletcher is trapped by a burning vehicle sliding on the deck as the boat heels to one side, but is rescued by Perry and Private Luke (John Laurie). The survivors are taken on board a destroyer and are sent to Gibraltar, missing the invasion. When they eventually arrive in North Africa, the platoon is assigned to guard a small town. Perry appropriates a cafe as his headquarters, much to the disgust of the pacifist owner, Rispoli (Ustinov). When the Germans attack, Perry and his men fiercely defend their positions, aided by Rispoli. At one point, the Germans invite them to surrender – their response is \\"Go to Hell!\\" The besieged British soldiers fix bayonets and join other surviving units in advancing on the enemy, hidden in the smoke from explosions. At home, veteran \\"Dogs\\" appreciatively read about the men's bravery.

The three had originally produced the 1943 44-minute training film The New Lot, which was produced for the Army Kinematograph Service. The Way Ahead was an expanded remake of their earlier film, this time intended for a commercial audience. The two films featured some of the same actors, including John Laurie, Raymond Huntley and a 23-year-old Peter Ustinov. The driving force behind the film was David Niven, a 1930 graduate of Sandhurst, who at the time was a major in the British Army working with the Army Film Unit and later served in Normandy with GHQ Liaison Regiment. Niven was the executive producer on The Way Ahead.McGee, Scott. \\"\\"Article: 'Immortal Battalion'. TCM. Retrieved: 9 July 2017. The last scene in The Way Ahead shows the soldiers advancing in a counter-attack. Instead of the film ending with the words \\"The End\\", it concludes with \\"The Beginning\\". In a film made and released during the war, this was an effort to galvanise public support for the final push in the war effort, with a perhaps not unintended reference to one of Winston Churchill's famous quotations: \\"This is not the end.

Babbio Jr., generally called Larry, is a former vice chairman and president of Verizon, with responsibility for the Verizon Telecom and Verizon Business units. He was also a member of the board of directors of Verizon Wireless. Since 2007, Babbio has been a senior adviser to Warburg Pincus, a private equity firm.Forbes Magazine profile Babbio began his communications career in 1966 with New Jersey Bell Telephone. He served in a variety of positions in engineering, network construction, and technology development with New Jersey Bell and AT&T.; In January 1995 he was elected vice chairman of Bell Atlantic Corporation. Prior to the Bell Atlantic/GTE merger, Babbio was president and chief operating officer for Bell Atlantic. He shared oversight of, and responsibility for, all of the corporation's business operations, restructuring of the business units, the GTE merger process, and developing new growth opportunities. Babbio also served as chairman of the company's Global Wireless Group, one of the largest wireless operations worldwide. He was the lead executive in charge of developing Bell Atlantic's domestic and international wireless communications strategy. Under his leadership, Bell Atlantic substantially increased the size and scope of its domestic and international wireless holdings. In May 2002 Babbio was elected to the board of directors of Hewlett-Packard Company. He previously served on the board of Compaq Computer Corporation since 1995.

He holds a B.E. in electrical engineering from Stevens Institute of Technology, and an M.B.A. from New York University. Attorney General Matter On September 17, 2009 Attorney General Anne Milgram announced charges against Lawrence Babbio and Stevens Institute of Technology president Harold J. Raveché. According to the state's 16-count lawsuit, Stevens' leaders kept several trustees in the dark about the school's financial condition. Raveché and his administration allegedly spent the school's money at greater rates than the board approved, scavenging restricted assets, excessive loans and gifts to the school earmarked for other purposes. Milgram also sought reforms to the school's governance and accounting. The lawsuit alleged that Raveché and Babbio misrepresented the finances of the school and caused the endowment to fall by $42 million from $157 million in 2000 to $115 million in 2009. The lawsuit detailed that Raveché received below-market loans from the school, at least some of which were forgiven by Stevens. The complaint also raises questions about Raveché's salary which had been greater than that of the president of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a much larger, better known school. The school disputed the allegations, brought a preemptive lawsuit against the State of New Jersey, and contended that the state attorney general had overstepped her legal authority. Stevens also sought unsuccessfully to keep the Attorney General's lawsuit confidential. The litigation was settled on January 15, 2010, on Milgram's last day in office. The settlement required Dr. Raveché to repay low-interest loans from the school, and for Stevens to correct by-laws to forestall future allegations of perceived misconduct.http://www.stevens.edu/pdf/fcj.pdf Raveché voluntarily stepped down as president of the Institute at the end of the 2010 academic year, after 22 years in office. He was succeeded as president in 2011 by Dr. Nariman Farvardin. Mr. Babbio's term as Board Chairman expired in May 2013, and he was succeeded as Chair by a fellow Stevens alum and Verizon executive, Ms. Virginia P. Ruesterholz. Babbio was subsequently named Chairman Emeritus of the Stevens Board by President Farvardin. On June 6, 2016, the Consent Judgment which had been in place since January, 2010, between Stevens Institute of Technology and the New Jersey Attorney General was lifted by Court Order and with the consent of the Attorney General's Office. The Consent Judgment arose from circumstances at Stevens pre-2010, and addressed a number of matters relating primarily to governance. As stated in the Consent Judgment, “Stevens has fully complied with the obligations to which it agreed in the Consent Judgment and has demonstrated to the State a continued focus on maintaining best practices in the area of governance for institutions of higher education. Lifting the Consent Judgment will afford Stevens added flexibility to make further enhancements to the ways it oversees its affairs and to respond and adapt to the evolving landscape of best governance practices....” References External links *http://investor.verizon.com/corp_gov/bios/babbio_lawrence.aspx Hewlett-Packard people New York University Stern School of Business alumni Stevens Institute of Technology alumni Place of birth missing (living people) Year of birth missing (living people) Living people Verizon Communications people American corporate directors ","title":"Lawrence Babbio Jr."},{"id":"2821008","text":"United States v. Moreland, 258 U.S. 433 (1922), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States on March 9 and 10, 1922, and decided a month later on April 17. The case involved a Fifth Amendment rights issue centering on whether or not hard labor was an infamous punishment (thus triggering the necessity of a grand jury indictment) or whether imprisonment in a penitentiary was a necessity for punishment to be considered infamous. The majority opinion also included the court's contention for continued support of the findings of a previously held case, Wong Wing v. United States, . Lawyers for the United States argued that Wong Wing was improperly applied in the Moreland case, and had been modified or overruled by subsequent cases. The court strongly rejected the government's contentions regarding Wong Wing in its opinion, and ruled in favor of Moreland. Facts and History The dissenting opinion written by Justice Louis Brandeis offers a succinct account of the facts that led up to this case: > On January 18, 1921, an information, under the Act of March 23, 1906, c. > 1131, 34 Stat. 86, was filed against Moreland in the juvenile court of the > District of Columbia for willfully neglecting to provide support for his > minor children-girls aged 8 and 13. He was tried by a jury and found guilty. (An information is defined as “a formal accusation of a crime made by a public officer rather than by grand jury indictment.”) The statute described by Justice Brandeis (also referred to as the Act of March 23, 1906 or the Act) suggests the punishment of > ‘a fine of not more than $500 or by imprisonment in the workhouse of the > District of Columbia at hard labor for not more than twelve months or by > both such fine and imprisonment.’ Mr. Moreland underwent a jury trial and was found guilty of failing to provide proper child support; the Supreme Court found no issue with the proceedings themselves. The juvenile court suspended sentence and gave him a chance to make these obligatory payments. After a month of failing to do so, “Moreland was sentenced on April 19, 1921, to be committed to the workhouse at hard labor for 6 months.” Moreland objected to the sentence, claiming the offense he had been charged with amounted to an infamous crime because the Act of March 23, 1908 included hard labor as a potential punishment; the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution would therefore apply, as would its ban on individuals being held to answer for infamous crimes without indictment or presentment by a grand jury. The juvenile court overruled his claim. Moreland appealed. The trial originated in the D.C. court system, so the appeal went directly to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which reversed the juvenile court's decision and directed that the complaint be dismissed, freeing Moreland. The Court of Appeals relied upon the findings of Wong Wing in making its determination that Moreland's claim was valid, and therefore found the Act of March 23, 1908 to be unconstitutional. Writ of certiorari was filed and granted by the Supreme Court. Issues Three separate but interconnected issues were addressed: First, there was contention over the issue of what exactly made a crime (or its punishment) infamous: the location (a penitentiary), or the inclusion of hard labor in the sentence. Crimes in which only a fine was faced are not considered infamous, and crimes where a convict must serve at a penitentiary had previously been found to be infamous. But Moreland argued crimes where a convict must spend time in confinement (penitentiary or not) and carry out hard labor should also be considered infamous. Merely the addition of hard labor to a sentence was enough to make it infamous. The United States contended that hard labor was not in and of itself an infamous punishment, and that time in a penitentiary was a necessity. Second, because the Act gave the option of either a fine, imprisonment, or both, the United States maintained that the Act was not unconstitutional because the threat of imprisonment was severable from the threat of fine (which would not be infamous). Because the court could decide to impose only a fine, the United States argued the Act as a whole should not be struck down. Third, the United States in its arguments attacked the legality of Wong Wing v. United States and its application to this case, arguing that other Supreme Court cases modified or overruled Wong Wing. Wong Wing was the primary case cited by the Court of Appeals in finding the Act of March 23, 1908 unconstitutional, so in arguing this, the United States argued for the entirety of the Court of Appeals' decision to be set down. Majority Opinion The Court, in its 5-3 ruling (Justice Clarke not having participated), upheld the Court of Appeals’ decision fully, including its decisions to strike as unconstitutional the Act of March 23, 1908, and to order Moreland's release. The majority opinion – written by Justice Joseph McKenna and joined by Justices Day, McReynolds, Pitney, and Van Devanter – noted their reluctance in the inevitable end result, but felt duty-bound to uphold the right of a U.S. citizen to be protected by the Fifth Amendment, and “... the right, at times, must be accorded one whose conduct tempts to a straining of the law against him.” =Infamy and Severability= In deciding the issue of infamy and infamous crimes, the Court had to lay down some basic definitions. The Court ruled the workhouse at Occoquan in the state of Virginia (a prison farm), to which Moreland was to be sent, was not a penitentiary. It was the contention of the United States that this meant the crime was not infamous, because they argued “the place of imprisonment – that is, imprisonment in a penitentiary – ... makes the infamy; the accompaniment of hard labor being but an incident.” However, the Supreme Court held that the status of Occoquan was not a relevant fact to the Moreland case; crimes requiring time served in a penitentiary had already been deemed to be infamous in the 1885 case Ex Parte Wilson (114 U.S. 417). The focus of the case instead rested upon the sentence of hard labor, and the majority quoted from the Wilson case: “... it was declared that, if imprisonment was in any other place than a penitentiary and was to be at hard labor, the latter ... made it infamous.” The United States’ contention was in direct opposition to the findings of Wilson, and was rejected. The Court also rejected the United States’ argument that “the provision of the Act [Moreland was charged under] for punishment by fine or imprisonment are severable.” Justice McKenna wrote: > The contention is untenable. It is what sentence can be imposed under the > law, not what was imposed, that is the material consideration. When an > accused is in danger of an infamous punishment, if convicted, he has a right > to insist that he be not put upon trial, except on the accusation of a grand > jury. In upholding the Court of Appeals’ decision the Supreme Court again upheld a key finding of Wilson, noting that even the possibility of an infamous punishment (regardless of whether or not lesser punishments like fines were available) made the crime infamous, and required Fifth Amendment constitutional requirements to be met. =Defense of Wong Wing= Justice McKenna devoted a vast portion of the majority opinion to a defense of Wong Wing v. United States in a prime example of the principle of stare decisis. McKenna wrote that the United States “resists both the authority and extent of [Wong Wing] by the citation of others, which, it asserts, modify or overrule it. A review of it, therefore, is of initial importance.” The majority opinion found odd the United States’ efforts to “modify the case or to remove it as authority for” the issue at hand before the Court of Appeals, noting “the means and pains taken to accomplish [that goal] are somewhat baffling to representation.” Arguments that the Supreme Court (and the Court of Appeals) were wrong to even cite Wong Wing and that a key finding of that case was incorrectly applied gave the majority pause and lead to a lengthy defense of that 1896 verdict. The United States noted Wong Wing was not referenced in the opinion of Fitzpatrick v. United States (178 U.S. 304) (1900), a case that occurred four years later. The United States claimed that this omission meant Wong Wing did not apply, or had been set aside by the Supreme Court, but this argument is rejected in the court's opinion for two reasons: “… a case is not overruled merely by an omission to mention it”; and Ex Parte Wilson had been cited in both Wong Wing and Fitzpatrick to justify the findings of each case. In Wong Wing, just like in Ex Parte Wilson, a punishment requiring hard labor was set aside because it was brought about without the involvement of a grand jury indictment. But the United States suggested Wong Wing's punishment was found to be infamous because he was to be sent to a penitentiary, and not because the sentence involved hard labor. The majority opinion found this contention odd, because the Detroit House of Corrections, to which Wong Wing was sent many years ago, was in fact not a penitentiary: “it was, and is, what its name implies – a place of correction and reformation, not of condemnation to infamy.” Since the hard labor sentence against Wong Wing was set aside and not done so because he was to be sent to a penitentiary, it can only have been because the inclusion of hard labor was infamous and therefore led to a Fifth Amendment violation. Dissenting Opinion Justice Brandeis wrote the dissenting opinion, which disagreed with the majority on key issues. In regards to findings of the Wong Wing case, the dissenters felt the case had been improperly applied, agreeing with the United States’ case. In particular, the minority found the Detroit House of Correction to be a penitentiary. A court commissioner, and not a grand jury, sentenced Wong Wing to an infamous penitentiary imprisonment; this is why the Wong Wing punishment was in violation of the Fifth Amendment. The minority opinion devoted several sentences to the suggestion that the workhouse at Occoquan was nothing like a penitentiary. Therefore, they focused on the matter of hard labor as a trigger for infamy. Citing several examples from colonial America or examples in history of times when hard labor was considered an acceptable punishment, the minority sided with the United States: “It is not the provision for hard labor, but the imprisonment in a penitentiary, which now renders a crime infamous.” The minority disagreed that Wong Wing found the presence of hard labor alone to be an infamous sentence. The minority noted a statement made in Ex Parte Wilson: “‘What punishments shall be considered as infamous may be affected by the changes of public opinion from one age to another’.” Because the Constitution contains no mention of hard labor, and the Fifth Amendment only refers to infamous crimes, the minority contended the two could not be linked together, because “commitment to Occoquan for a short term for nonsupport of minor children is certainly not an infamous punishment.” However, this statement ignored another finding of Ex Parte Wilson mentioned by the majority: “… if imprisonment was in any other place than a penitentiary and was to be at hard labor, the latter … made it infamous …” Also, this same cited statement would seem to apply to the majority opinion as well: through the cases of Wong Wing and now United States v. Moreland, public opinion had changed to include any hard labor as the very definition of infamy. Justice Brandeis contended that the Court had never held hard labor alone to be an infamous punishment; it did so in its Moreland opinion.

The Director of Photography was Zhang Li, a fifth generation filmmaker and classmate of Chen Kaige. Red Cherry won Best Picture at the 1996 Golden Rooster Awards. The film was made in China in 1995 under the title Hong ying tao starring Ke-Yu Guo, Vladmill Nizmiroff, Xu Xiaoling. The movie was based on the true story of Chuchu, a 13-year-old Chinese girl, and Luo Xiaoman, a 12-year-old Chinese boy, who were sent to Moscow, Russia in the 1940s and enrolled into an international boarding school. There they had so many great and difficult experiences as they tried to survive during World War II. The children's real encounter with fate began as kanikuli (summer break) arrived, Chuchu accompanied her class to a children’s camp in Belarus, while Xiaoman remained in Moscow. Then, Russia was invaded by Germany's Operation Barbarossa. Red Cherry is basically an account of the two orphans’ parallel experiences of the war. The film was China's biggest box office hit in 1995. Internationally, the film was selected in the Panorama section of the Berlin International Film Festival in 1996. The film also won Audience Choice award (Best Foreign Language Film) in Palm Springs International Film Festival in 1996. The film was selected as the Chinese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 68th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Plot The film begins in the early summer of 1941, at the Ivanov International School in Moscow. Luo Xiaoman and Chuchu were two new students who had come to Russia after the brutal White Terror in China killed their parents (as Chuchu described in front of her class how her father, a communist revolutionary, being executed in front of her by the Kuomintang). Chuchu and Luo quickly learned to fit in with the other international students and they also learned to speak Russian fluently. When summer came, several students, including Chuchu, left for the summer camp in Belarus accompanied by their teacher, Miss Vera. Xiaoman remained behind in Moscow. During this time the Nazis invaded the Soviet Union. Moscow was left unoccupied after the invasion, and Xiaoman was soon left to survive on his own in a land that he knew little of. For a time he was a homeless child begging and stealing on the streets, forced to sell blood so he could get money for food (only to be robbed by others later). He eventually found a job delivering condolence letters to families of fallen soldiers. At one apartment, he found an orphaned girl (whose mother died silently due to starvation and illness) and took her in as though she was his own daughter. Things were very different for the students at the summer camp. Captured by the invading Germans, Chuchu and her classmates were kept as slaves, and were alone and in great danger. Miss Vera was soon ruthlessly murdered in front of the students for defying the Germans by teaching her class. One of the students, Carl, who was half-German himself and liked Chuchu deeply, managed to help the other students escape by using his Aryan descent to trick a German soldier's trust, but he was soon injured, cornered and machinegunned to death in a forest pit. The others were quickly recaptured and sentenced to death by hanging. One girl was executed with a brutal shot to the head, but Chuchu and several other students were spared when a high-ranking German officer, General Von Dietrich arrived and sent them to work as servants at Nazi headquarters in the Yakovliv Monastery. General Von Dietrich was not only a military general, but also a doctor who took tattooing as a hobby — he enjoyed tattooing the bodies of young girls and showing them to his guests at parties. He decided to use Chuchu for his greatest \\"masterpiece\\". This was what saved her life because when the General learned that the Third Reich was doomed, instead of having Chuchu executed with the rest of the prisoners, he had her dumped in a field so that his \\"masterpiece\\" would live on. The large tattoo (a Nazi eagle) on her back become a shame to her for the rest of her life. Luo Xiaoman tried to enlist in the expeditionary Soviet Red Army, but was rejected due to his young age. Out of his deep, vengeful hatred towards the Nazi invaders, he decided to \\"punish\\" the German POWs (who were now forced to work in labour camps) by sniping them with a home-made slingshot. When the German POWs rioted, Xiaoman lured them into an empty, ruined apartment building and set the oil tanks on fire. He himself was killed in the explosion together with the German rioters. At the end of the movie Chuchu was reunited with the orphan girl Luo Xiaoman adopted, and after hearing the same speech Xiaoman gave for his Russian class, Chuchu understood, embraced the young girl and broke down. At the end of the movie Chuchu was seen taking a shower, and the tattoo on her back could be seen along with the scar caused by her attempt to burn off the tattoo with a firewood. Later credits appear telling that a skin graft operation to remove the tattoo was not successful, and about the real Chuchu and what she did with her life. The movie then ends.

The dish was invented by Ben Wenberg, a sea captain in the fruit trade. He demonstrated the dish at Delmonico’s Restaurant in New York City to the manager, Charles Delmonico, in 1876. After refinements by the chef, Charles Ranhofer, the creation was added to the restaurant’s menu as Lobster à la Wenberg and it soon became very popular. An argument between Wenberg and Charles Delmonico caused the dish to be removed from the menu. To satisfy patrons’ continued requests for it, the name was rendered in anagram Lobster à la Newberg or Lobster Newberg. It is still quite popular and is found in French cookbooks, where it is sometimes referred to as “Homard sauté à la crème.” When Ranhofer’s printed recipe first appeared in 1894, the lobsters were boiled fully twenty-five minutes, then fried in clarified butter, then simmered in cream while it reduced by half, then brought again to the boil after the addition of Madeira.

It was based on the recommendations published in the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration in 1885. Assented on 20 July 1885, the intention of the Act was stated explicitly in its heading: \\"to restrict and regulate Chinese immigration into Canada.\\"Statutes of Canada. An Act of Respecting and Regulating Chinese Immigration into Canada, 1885. Ottawa: SC 48–49 Victoria, Chapter 71 It followed the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act, which was passed in 1882.  History  In the early 1880s, during the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway, as many as 17,000 Chinese immigrants came to Canada to work as labourers. Many individuals arrived from China, but others came from American states that included Washington, Oregon, and California, following their work on railroads and in mining camps. The arrival of the Chinese in Canada was partially the result of a demand for cheap labour in the West. Major labour shortages in British Columbia and surrounding provinces threatened the economic viability of Canada.Vic Satzewich, \\"Racisms: The Reactions to Chinese Migrants in Canada at the Turn of the. Century,\\" International Sociology 4, no. 3 (1989): 313. Thus, as a way to bring the West economic efficiency, Chinese immigration was encouraged in the early 1880s. Furthermore, the Canadian Pacific Railway, also called the CPR, was formed to physically unite Canada, and required cheap labour to complete its construction. Founded in 1881, the CPR was completed on November 7, 1885, \\"six years ahead of schedule, when the last spike was driven at Craigellachie, B.C.\\"'Our History'. Accessed 23 October 2015. http://www.cpr.ca/en/about- cp/our-history Following its completion, the demand for Chinese immigration decreased significantly. Immigration to Canada also resulted from troubling political and social circumstances in China. Over 44, 000 immigrants arrived in Canada between 1858 and 1923, most of whom were “male, relatively uneducated, and unskilled.” Most Chinese immigrants during this period resided in the province of British Columbia, particularly in the cities of New Westminster and Victoria. In addition to their work on the CPR, early immigrants were employed in occupations that included mining, forestry, and fishing. Although initially welcome in Canada, an increasing fear that immigrants would take jobs from Canadians, as well as a fear of Chinese people in general, resulted in the ostracization of the Chinese community and calls for immigration reform. They were also said to be \\"subject to loathsome diseases and demoralising habits\\" and considered to be an \\"unassimilable people.\\" As a result of the public's distrust of Chinese immigrants, the province of British Columbia reconsidered their legal status between the years 1872 and 1885. In 1884, for example, British Columbia's Legislature attempted to \\"prevent their immigration, to impose an annual poll tax of $10, and to forbid their acquisition of Crown Lands.\\" = The Royal Commission = Dissatisfaction with Chinese immigration grew, and in 1885, a Royal Commission was appointed to obtain proof that restricting Chinese immigration would be in the best interests of the country. Prime Minister John A. Macdonald originally refused to introduce prohibitive measures, but eventually yielded and appointed the commission. The commission was entitled the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration in 1885, and interviewed hundreds of people with the goal of understanding the majority's view on Chinese immigration.Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence of 1885 The Commission was led by Joseph-Adolphe Chapleau and John Hamilton Gray, who gathered testimony regarding Chinese immigration at public hearings across British Columbia and compared these testimonies to those gathered on the Pacific Coast of the United States. The testimonies of 51 people were submitted. Only 2 Chinese witnesses were consulted: 2 officials from the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco. Multiple viewpoints were reported, including some in favour of Chinese immigration on an economic efficiency scale.Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence of 1885, page 97 However, the overall consensus on the state of Chinese immigration was a vocalized demand for its restriction.Report of the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration: Report and Evidence of 1885, page 94. Claims against the Chinese were slanderous and were found to have little evidence behind them. Despite this, the Commission recommended a moderate legislation against Chinese immigration and proposed a $10 head tax.  Implementation  The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 was enacted as a result of the findings of the Commission. The Act imposed a $50 head tax on Chinese immigrants, with the exceptions of diplomats, government representatives, tourists, merchants, scientists, and students. The imposed duty of $50 was a significant increase from the $10 duty recommended by the Royal Commission. This piece of legislation became the first in Canada's history to exclude immigrants on the basis of their ethnic origin.Ninette Kelley and Michael Trebilcock, The Making of the Mosaic: A History of Canadian Immigration Policy (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1998), 107. It also defined \\"Chinese Immigrant\\" in section one as \\"The expression 'Chinese Immigrant' means any person of Chinese origin entering Canada and not entitled to the privilege of exemption provided for by section four of this Act.\\" Furthermore, vessels that were transporting Chinese immigrants were permitted to only carry one Chinese immigrant per fifty tonnes of the ship's weight. This law also prevented any Chinese immigrant who suffered from a contagious disease, such as leprosy, or any Chinese woman who was known to have been a prostitute. Therefore, the Act limited the number of Chinese immigrants to the extent that a 300-ton ship could only carry six Chinese immigrants to Canada. Despite mass fervour toward the banning of Chinese immigrants in 1885, due to Canada being a colony under Britain, the passing of Chinese exclusion would not be possible. This was because the banning of Chinese immigrants did not fall with British interests at the time. The Act was amended in 1887 to allow Chinese women who were married to non-Chinese men to enter Canada, as well as Chinese passing through Canada via the railway. An additional amendment in 1892 required Chinese residents of Canada who wished to temporarily leave the country to register with an immigration official prior to their departure. In 1900, the head tax was raised to $100 by Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier, due to a still growing influx of Chinese immigrants. In 1903, this was further raised to $500, “An equivalent of two year’s wages for a Chinese labourer.” Companies in short supply of cheap labour would often advance this money to bring Chinese immigrants to Canada. The Act was eventually superseded in 1923 by the Chinese Immigration Act, 1923, also known as the Chinese Exclusion Act (not to be confused with the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882), which banned Chinese immigration entirely.  Aftermath and legacy  Following the implementation of the Chinese Immigration Act of 1885, prejudice against the Chinese grew across Canada. During the 1890s, for example, labour organizers in cities that included Quebec City, Montreal, and Toronto objected to Chinese immigration. Numerous riots occurred across the country to protest the presence of Chinese people in economic and social settings. In 1887, a riot occurred in Vancouver in protest of Chinese land clearing crews. In 1907, another riot occurred in Vancouver in which participants protested all Chinese immigration. Numerous Canadian provinces disenfranchised the Chinese or placed heavy restrictions on them in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The province of Saskatchewan disenfranchised them in 1908. The province of British Columbia placed various restrictions on them, including \\"Natal Acts,\\" which incorporated a language test that was created to prevent the immigration of Chinese people to the province. Thus, the Act contributed to anti-Chinese sentiment across Canada. Although the 1923 Chinese Immigration Act was repealed in 1947, restrictions remained in place during the 1950s and 1960s. For example, immigration remained limited to the wives of Chinese Canadian citizens and their unmarried children under the age of eighteen. Several notable Canadian politicians protested these policies. These included John Diefenbaker, a member of the Progressive Conservative party who was very supportive of human rights, and Stanley Knowles, a member of the CCF who protested the unequal treatment of the Chinese. As a result of protest against strict immigration regulations, during the late 1960s, the Canadian government altered their policies to include immigrants who were admitted to the country based on \\"their skills and the capital they had for investment\\" as opposed to their \\"family relationships.\\" In the 1980s, voices for redress emerged in the Chinese-Canadian community. Organizations that strove for promoting the rights of all individuals, particularly those of Chinese Canadians, encouraged their full and equal participation in Canadian society. In the 1980s, the Chinese Canadian National Council, or CCNC, began to collect head tax certificates, and in 1984 \\"the CCNC presented the government with a list of names of 2,300 surviving Chinese who had each paid a head tax.\\" A subsequent survey by the CCNC \\"found that of the 867 respondents who completed the questionnaire, forty-six percent were in favor of an official apology and a symbolic redress to the individual victims, while thirty-eight percent also supported some form of community redress.\\" In 1990, the CCNC successfully lobbied for political endorsement for a redress. By 1993, a redress proposal was submitted to the representatives of five groups, including Chinese Canadians. At this time, the redress only offered an omnibus apology. The offer was rejected by the Chinese Canadian groups, and no resolutions were made that federal term. As a result of the Act and its imposed head tax, a redress, with apologies and compensations, took place only officially in 2006. After the election of the minority Conservative government in 2006, Stephen Harper affirmed his position on Chinese immigration:\\"Throne speech promises crime crackdown, GST cut.\\" CBC News. April 4, 2006. > Chinese Canadians are making an extraordinary impact on the building of our > country. They've also made a significant historical contribution despite > many obstacles. That's why, as I said during the election campaign, the > Chinese Canadian community deserves an apology for the head tax and > appropriate acknowledgement and redress. Effective August 29, 2006, Canada's redress program combined \\"payments to individual head tax payers, (or, if the payer is deceased, to their spouse) with funding for educative and commemorative programs.\\" = Significance = The Chinese Immigration Act of 1885 carried great weight as a result of it being the first of its kind in Canada's history and subsequently laying down the foundations for future exclusionary policies and acts. The act laid down the legal framework for head taxes, which were later refined even more harshly. As such, immigration from China was greatly reduced until the 1940s. The aim of establishing a \\"white\\" society for Canada, as Kenneth Munro explains, \\"such discrimination flew in the face of that crucial premise of Canadian nationhood, namely, respect for diversity of culture and traditions.\\"Kenneth Munro, \\"The Chinese Immigration Act, 1885: Adolphe Chapleau and the French Canadian Attitude,\\" Canadian Ethnic Studies, no. 3 (1 January 1987): 90.

The Rose Garden is situated in a residential area of the Berkeley Hills between the Cragmont and La Loma Park neighborhoods, occupying most of the block between Eunice Street and Bayview Place along the west side of Euclid Avenue. Rose Garden The Rose Garden is in the form of a terraced amphitheater nestled in a small canyon and offers stunning views of the city and bay of San Francisco and the Golden Gate. More than 100 rose varieties grow along the terraces, with maximum blooming occurring in mid-May. The park is bisected by Codornices Creek. The north side of the Rose Garden includes a set of tennis courts. The south side is a grove of Coast Redwoods, bay trees and coastal live oak. Construction of the Rose Garden began in 1933 with funds provided by the federal Civil Works Administration. Construction continued in subsequent years with funding from the California State Relief Administration and the federal Works Progress Administration. It opened on September 26, 1937. Since its inception, the Rose Garden has been the site of numerous rose shows.

The single example built was destroyed in a crash in 1951. Design and development In 1949, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) began assessing replacements for two fighters built in Australia: the Mustangs built by Commonwealth Aircraft Corporation (CAC) and Vampires of De Havilland Australia (DHA).RAAF Museum, 2009, A94 CAC Sabre (14 December 2012). A series of designs were considered, including the Grumman F9F Panther and the CAC CA-23 – an unconventional, twin- jet all-weather design by CAC. Hawker Aircraft also submitted a proposal, for a swept-wing, swept-tail fighter based on the Hawker P.1052, but using a Rolls-Royce Tay engine. Work began to modify the second prototype of the P.1052 (VX279) along these lines, although the Rolls-Royce Nene engine already fitted was initially retained. To allow an afterburner, the bifurcated tail- pipes of the P.1052 was replaced by a single tail-exit pipe. VX279, which was now the prototype P.1081, took to the air on 19 June 1950. CAC, evidently planning to build any design accepted by the Australian government, assigned the serial number CA-24 to the P.1081. By mid-1950, however, the RAAF urgently required a replacement for its Mustangs, some of which were in action in Korea and faced the possibility of clashes with MiG 15s. The P.1081 could not realistically become operational within the time frame required; in November 1950, Hawker decided to cease development. Likewise, the US-built North American F-86 Sabre could not be delivered to the RAAF for at least a few years. As a stop-gap, the RAAF ordered the ready-made Gloster Meteor F.8. CAC instead built a more powerful, Rolls-Royce Avon-engined variant of the F-86 a project which resulted in the CAC Sabre.RAAF Museum, 2009, A94 CAC Sabre The P.1081 prototype, which had remained in the UK, was handed over by Hawker to the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE). Its swept tail increased the Mach number above that of the P.1052 into the Mach 0.9-0.95 region, providing valuable data that contributed to the design of the axially-powered Hawker Hunter.

Named species of Gryposaurus are known from the Dinosaur Park Formation in Alberta, Canada, and two formations in the United States: the Lower Two Medicine Formation in Montana and the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah. A possible additional species may extend the temporal range of the genus to 66 million years ago. Gryposaurus is similar to Kritosaurus, and for many years the two were thought to be synonyms. It is known from numerous skulls, some skeletons, and even some skin impressions that show it to have had pyramidal scales projecting along the midline of the back. It is most easily distinguished from other duckbills by its narrow arching nasal hump, sometimes described as similar to a \\"Roman nose,\\" and which may have been used for species or sexual identification, and/or combat with individuals of the same species. A large bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore around long, it may have preferred river settings. History of discovery G. notabilis (formerly G. incurvimanus), collected 1918 Gryposaurus is based on specimen NMC 2278, a skull and partial skeleton collected in 1913 by George F. Sternberg from what is now known as the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, along the Red Deer River. This specimen was described and named by Lawrence Lambe shortly thereafter, Lambe drawing attention to its unusual nasal crest. A few years earlier, Barnum Brown had collected and described a partial skull from New Mexico, which he named Kritosaurus. This skull was missing the snout, which had eroded into fragments; Brown restored it after the duckbill now known as Anatotitan, which was flat-headed, and believed that some unusual pieces were evidence of compression. Lambe's description of Gryposaurus provided evidence of a different type of skull configuration, and by 1916 the Kritosaurus skull had been redone with a nasal arch and both Brown and Charles Gilmore had proposed that Gryposaurus and Kritosaurus were one and the same. This idea was reflected in William Parks's naming of a nearly complete skeleton from the Dinosaur Park Formation as Kritosaurus incurvimanus, not Gryposaurus incurvimanus (although he left Gryposaurus notabilis in its own genus). Direct comparison between Kritosaurus incurvimanus and Gryposaurus notabilis is hindered by the fact that the incurvimanus type specimen is missing the front part of the skull, so the full shape of the nasal arch cannot be seen. The 1942 publication of the influential Lull and Wright monograph on hadrosaurs sealed the Kritosaurus/Gryposaurus question for nearly fifty years in favor of Kritosaurus. Reviews beginning in the 1990s, however, called into question the identity of Kritosaurus navajovius, which has limited material for comparison with other duckbills. Thus, Gryposaurus has once again been separated, at least temporarily, from Kritosaurus. Skull, Royal Tyrrell Museum This situation is made more confusing by old suggestions by some authors, including Jack Horner, that Hadrosaurus is also the same as either Gryposaurus, Kritosaurus, or both. This hypothesis was most common in the late 1970s–early 1980s, and appears in some popular books; one well-known work, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Dinosaurs, uses Kritosaurus for the Canadian material (Gryposaurus), but identifies the mounted skeleton of K. incurvimanus as Hadrosaurus in a photo caption. Although Horner in 1979 used the new combination Hadrosaurus [Kritosaurus] notabilis for a partial skull and skeleton and a second less-complete skeleton from the Bearpaw Shale of Montana (which have since fallen out of the literature), by 1990 he had changed his position, and was among the first to again use Gryposaurus in print. Current thought is that Hadrosaurus, although known from fragmentary material, can be distinguished from Gryposaurus by differences in the upper arm and ilium. Further research has revealed the presence of a second species, G. latidens, from slightly older rocks in Montana than the classic gryposaur localities of Alberta. Based on two parts of a skeleton collected in 1916 for the American Museum of Natural History, G. latidens is also known from bonebed material. Horner, who described the specimens, considered it to be a less derived species. New material from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust than that of the other species, and its predentary had enlarged prongs along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus, and there may be a second, more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts. =Species= G. monumentensis skull As of 2016, there are currently three named species that are recognized as valid today: G. notabilis, G. latidens, and G. monumentensis. The type species G. notabilis is from the late Campanian-age Upper Cretaceous Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, Canada. It is now thought that another species from the same formation, Kritosaurus incurvimanus (also known as Gryposaurus incurvimanus), is a synonym of G. notabilis. The two had been differentiated by the size of the nasal arch (larger and closer to the eyes in G. notabilis) and the form of the upper arm (longer and more robust in K. incurvimanus). Ten complete skulls and twelve fragmentary skulls are known for G. notabilis along with postcrania, as well as with two skeletons with skulls that had been assigned to K. incurvimanus. G. latidens, from the late Santonian-early Campanian Lower Two Medicine Formation of Pondera County, Montana, USA, is known from partial skulls and skeletons from several individuals. Its nasal arch is prominent like that of G. notabilis, but farther forward on the snout, and its teeth are less derived, reflecting iguanodont-like characteristics. The informal name \\"Hadrosauravus\\" is an early, unused name for this species. G. monumentensis is known from a skull and partial skeleton from Utah. G. monumentensis was listed second on the top 10 list of new species in 2008 by the International Institute for Species Exploration. Recently, a possible fourth species of Gryposaurus, Gryposaurus alsatei, was unearthed in the Javelina Formation, which dates to the late Maastrichtian, along with an unnamed species of Kritosaurus and an undescribed saurolophine which closely resembles Saurolophus, but with a more solid crest. The dubious hadrosaurid Stephanosaurus marginatus was considered a possible species of Kritosaurus, following the synonymy of Gryposaurus with Kritosaurus.Lull, Richard Swann; Wright, Nelda E. (1942). Hadrosaurian Dinosaurs of North America. Geological Society of America Special Paper 40. Geological Society of America. pp. 164–172. However, this synonymy was rejected in the 2004 edition of the Dinosauria, with Stephanosaurus being tabulated as dubious. Description G. notabilis restoration Gryposaurus was a hadrosaurid of typical size and shape; one of the best specimens of this genus, the nearly complete type specimen of Kritosaurus incurvimanus (now regarded as a synonym of Gryposaurus notabilis) came from an animal about long. This specimen also has the best example of skin impressions for Gryposaurus, showing this dinosaur to have had several different types of scalation: pyramidal, ridged, limpet-shaped scutes upwards of 3.8 centimeters long (1.5 inches) on the flank and tail; uniform polygonal scales on the neck and sides of the body; and pyramidal structures, flattened side-to-side, with fluted sides, longer than tall and found along the top of the back in a single midline row. The three named species of Gryposaurus differ in details of the skull and lower jaw. The prominent nasal arch found in this genus is formed from the paired nasal bones. In profile view, they rise into a rounded hump in front of the eyes, reaching a height as tall as the highest point of the back of the skull. The skeleton is known in great detail, making it a useful point of reference for other duckbill skeletons. Classification Size of Gryposaurus monumentensis. Gryposaurus was a saurolophine (hadrosaurine of older references) hadrosaurid, a member of the duckbill subfamily without hollow head crests. The general term \\"gryposaur\\" is sometimes used for duckbills with arched nasals. Tethyshadros was once thought to fall into this group as well, before it was described (then known under the nickname \\"Antonio\\"). A subfamily, Gryposaurinae, was coined by Jack Horner as part of a larger revision that promoted Hadrosaurinae to family status, but is not now in use. A rough equivalent is Kritosaurini, as used by Alberto Prieto-Márquez. The main difference between the two is and age (Kritosaurus comes from slightly younger rocks than Gryposaurus). Otherwise, the skull of Kritosaurus is incompletely known, lacking most of the bones in front of the eyes, but very similar to that of Gryposaurus. The following is a cladogram based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Prieto-Márquez and Wagner in 2012, showing the relationships of Gryposaurus among the other kritosaurins: Paleobiology Restored head of G. notabilis. As a hadrosaurid, Gryposaurus would have been a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore, eating a variety of plants. Its skull had special joints that permitted a grinding motion analogous to chewing, and its teeth were continually replacing and packed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of teeth, only a relative handful of which were in use at any time. Plant material would have been cropped by its broad beak, and held in the jaws by a cheek-like organ. Its feeding range would have extended from the ground to about above.While its diet is unknown, its beak would imply it dined on fibrous plants that grew low to the ground. Like other bird-hipped dinosaurs of the Dinosaur Park Formation, Gryposaurus appears to have only existed for part of the duration of time that the rocks were being formed. As the formation was being laid down, it recorded a change to more marine-influenced conditions. Gryposaurus is absent from the upper part of the formation, with Prosaurolophus present instead. Other dinosaurs known from only the lower part of the formation include the horned Centrosaurus and the hollow-crested duckbill Corythosaurus. Gryposaurus may have preferred river- related settings. =Nasal arch= The distinctive nasal arch of Gryposaurus, like other cranial modifications in duckbills, may have been used for a variety of social functions, such as identification of sexes or species and social ranking. It could also have functioned as a tool for broadside pushing or butting in social contests, and there may have been inflatable air sacs flanking it for both visual and auditory signaling. The top of the arch is roughened in some specimens, suggesting that it was covered by thick, keratinized skin, or that there was a cartilaginous extension.

Miscellaneous Publication 02-4, Utah Geological Survey, 66 pp. During the Late Cretaceous period, the site of the Kaiparowits Formation was located near the western shore of the Western Interior Seaway, a large inland sea that split North America into two landmasses, Laramidia to the west and Appalachia to the east. The plateau where dinosaurs lived was an ancient floodplain dominated by large channels and abundant wetland peat swamps, ponds and lakes, and was bordered by highlands. The climate was wet and humid, and supported an abundant and diverse range of organisms.Titus, Alan L. and Mark A. Loewen (editors). At the Top of the Grand Staircase: The Late Cretaceous of Southern Utah. 2013. Indiana University Press. Hardbound: 634 pp. This formation contains one of the best and most continuous records of Late Cretaceous terrestrial life in the world. Gryposaurus monumentensis shared its paleoenvironment with other dinosaurs, such as dromaeosaurid theropods, the troodontid Talos sampsoni, ornithomimids like Ornithomimus velox, tyrannosaurids like Albertosaurus and Teratophoneus, armored ankylosaurids, the duckbilled hadrosaur Parasaurolophus cyrtocristatus, the ceratopsians Utahceratops gettyi, Nasutoceratops titusi and Kosmoceratops richardsoni and the oviraptorosaurian Hagryphus giganteus. Other paleofauna present in the Kaiparowits Formation included chondrichthyans (sharks and rays), frogs, salamanders, turtles, lizards and crocodilians. A variety of early mammals were present including multituberculates, marsupials, and insectivorans.

He was the primary party theoretician or the 'brain' of the party, and was more analyst than political leader. Following the February Revolution of 1917, Chernov was Minister for Agriculture in the Russian Provisional Government and advocating immediate land reform.Lazar Volin (1970) A century of Russian agriculture. From Alexander II to Khrushchev, p. 123. Harvard University Press Later on, he was Chairman of the Russian Constituent Assembly.  Biography  = Early years = Viktor Chernov was born in Novouzensk, a town southeast of Saratov in Samara guberniya. He was the son of a former serf peasant who had risen to become a low-level functionary in the local civil service.Maureen Perrie, \\"Viktor Mikhailovich Chernov,\\" in George Jackson with Robert Devlin (eds.), Dictionary of the Russian Revolution. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1989; pp. 116-119. Chernov attended gymnasium in Saratov, a hotbed of radicalism, where he joined a populist discussion circle in which he studied the works of Nikolay Dobrolyubov and Nikolay Mikhaylovsky. His radical proclivities attracted the attention of the local police and Chernov transferred to school in Iurev for his final year of study. Chernov enrolled in the Law department of Moscow University, where he once again joined a radical discussion circle, defending populist views against Marxists. He was arrested for his political activities in the spring of 1894 and spent 9 months in Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg. Following his incarceration, Chernov was sentenced to a period of administrative exile in central Russia. = Political career = By the end of the 1880s, he was involved in revolutionary activity. He attended the law faculty of Moscow University and in the early 1890s joined the Narodniks; in 1894, he joined Mark Natanson's \\"People's Right\\" (Narodnoe pravo) group, an attempt to unite all the socialist movements in Russia, and with other members was arrested, jailed, and exiled. After spending some time organizing the peasants around Tambov, he went abroad to Zurich in 1899. He joined the Socialist- Revolutionary Party upon its founding in 1901 and became the editor of its newspaper Revolutionary Russia. He returned to Russia after the Revolution of 1905; after boycotting the elections for the First Duma, he won election to the Second Duma and became a leader of the SR faction. In 1907, he published Philosophical and Sociological Studies in which he espoused the viewpoint of Richard Avenarius. As such, he was one of the Russian Machists criticised by Lenin in Materialism and Empirio-criticism (1909). Under Alexander Kerensky's provisional government in 1917, Chernov was the Minister for Agriculture. On 17 March the Provisional Government issued its first appeal to the peasant population. It stated that the land question must be solved not by force but by legislation to be passed by the people's representatives. In summer the Stolypin land-tenure laws were suspended. Chernov resigned shortly after the departure of Prince Lvov. Then on 9 August the elections were postponed until 12 November. Chernov continued his campaign for immediate agrarian reform. The Union of Landowners saw in Chernov its principal enemy.Lazar Volin (1970) A century of Russian agriculture. From Alexander II to Khrushchev, p. 121, 124, 127. Harvard University Press Until January 1918 he was Chairman of the Russian Constituent Assembly, which was dissolved by the Bolsheviks shortly after it began meeting. He became a member of an anti-Bolshevik government leading the more moderate Social Revolutionaries in Samara, before fleeing to Europe and then the United States.

It uses the trackbed of the defunct Oahu Railway and Land Company. History In 1970, Waialua Agricultural Co. said it would scrap its 0-6-2T locomotive No. 6 because rust and deterioration had reduced the engine to an unsightly liability and posed a danger to children who played on it. John Knaus then contacted Bill Paty, then manager of Waialua Agricultural Company, about saving and restoring the locomotive. John then contacted his boss, Captain Henry Davies, of the Naval Ammunition Depot, Lualualei about having the locomotive moved there since it had the only locomotive facility left on Oahu. This was followed by a letter to Ed Bernsten of the National Railway Historical Society seeking information on organizing a local chapter. John received approval to have No. 6 restored at Lualualei. He then talked to Nick Carter, another rail fan who had expressed interest in saving the Navy mainline on the leeward coast for an operating railroad. On August 22, 1970, John Knaus, Nick Carter, Luman Wilcox, and Ken Peale met to discuss forming a local chapter of the NRHS. Wilcox was appointed to draw up the temporary by-laws. On August 27 an organizational meeting was held at Cocco's Restaurant with 15 people in attendance. Wilcox successfully proposed forming a local chapter of the NRHS. Thirteen of the fifteen people present signed up. Nominated and elected were: Luman Wilcox for pres., Ken Peale for VP, Nick Carter for Secretary-Treasurer, and John Knaus for National Director. On Oct 9, 1970 the membership met to approve the By-Laws and Charter Night was set for Nov. 13th at Bishop Museum. On February 17, 1971 a Waialua Agricultural Co. trailer was used to transport WA Co. 6 to Lualualei. Waialua Elementary School students gave the old locomotive a send off before it left Waialua. No. 6 was a magnet that brought a group of talent to Lualualei shortly after. A boiler maker named Dave Griner, a welder named Dick Marshall and a machinist named Bob Haney were all joined by others who wanted to lend a hand. On October 13 the Hawaii Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society was granted a charter. On October 13, 1971 The State of Hawaii, Department of Regulatory Agencies granted the Hawaii Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society a charter of incorporation. The use of Hawaii Chapter, NRHS posed a problem: the name was too long and it really did not say anything about local railroading. At a membership meeting on December 19, 1973, the members voted to use the name of Hawaiian Railway Society without severing itself from the NRHS. On November 25, 1972, a Saturday, a dedication ceremony marked the restoration of No. 6 after 84 Sundays of restoration work, This educational, non-profit organization was able to get the remaining stretch of track on Oahu, (from Ewa to Nanakuli), placed on the State and National Register of Historic Places. As of early 2009, the Society has restored about and is working to restore more. O. R. & L. Co. No. 6, an 0-4-2T A usual consist features open-air cars built on ex-US Army flatcars.

On October 2, 2005, at 2:55 p.m., with 47 passengers—all from Michigan and Ohio and mostly seniors—aboard, the Ethan Allen capsized and sank just south of Cramer Point in the Town of Lake George. Twenty passengers died. The accident caused government regulators to consider new laws on passenger boat capacity. Accident The boat was carrying a tourist group, the Trenton Travelers, based out of Trenton, Michigan. The group included senior citizens from Michigan and Ohio. They were on an hour-long fall foliage tour on the lake. When the boat capsized it sent about 47 passengers and crew, including the captain into the water. The boat sank in water about deep, and witnesses told officials that passengers had not been wearing life preservers. There were multiple attempts to save individuals on the boat with people passing on boats, or who had swum from shore tossing them life preservers or pulling them out of the water. = Victims = Three passengers were treated for major injuries at local hospitals and six passengers were treated for minor injuries. The 20 deceased victims are believed to have died from drowning, not hypothermia, as the water in the lake was .  Aftermath  Injured passengers and crew were sent to Glens Falls Hospital by ambulances from Lake George and the nearby towns of Hague, Warrensburg, and Moreau. North Warren EMS, which incorporates the towns of Horicon and Chester, assisted in the effort. The Water Rescue Teams, a part of the Horicon VFD, North Queensbury VFC, and Lake George VFD were also called to the scene. Officials of Warren County set up a makeshift morgue on the lawn by the lake, while locals helped survivors. One local recounted an interaction with one survivor stating the individual looked over the local's shoulder and said, \\"That's my wife. She's dead.\\" = Initial speculation = Speculation about the cause of the capsizing originally centered on the sizable wake of a much larger cruise ship, the Lake George Steamboat Company's Mohican, which traverses Lake George daily. However, no evidence emerged to support this theory. Tourists at a nearby camp reported that the Mohican did not pass the area of the lake where the Ethan Allen sank until 20 minutes later. There were multiple reports by people near and around the lake of several other boats being in the vicinity. Reports from some people at local campsites claim that a speed boat had passed by, while others claim the lake was calm. Warren County Police did not confirm whether there were other boats around the Ethan Allen. Weather was also not a factor in this accident, as the skies were clear and the wind calm. =Investigations= On October 3, the Ethan Allen was raised by investigators and taken to the Warren County Airport. By Friday, October 7, two of the survivors who returned to Michigan filed lawsuits for damages of $70,000 each. The following week, the Ethan Allen was returned to Lake George for a series of tests to determine what caused it to capsize. According to WRGB, the Mohican was used during tests on three consecutive days. On October 15 it was confirmed that the Ethan Allen was making a sharp turn and that weight was a factor for the capsizing. There was a rumor that the glass windows on the boat had acted like a box, trapping the passengers inside. However, it was later established by the NTSB that there were no glass windows; they were made of acrylic glass and fitted in a swing-up frame. The frame attaches to the overhead. At the time of the accident they were swung up and out of the way. They remained in that position even with the boat sinking and were still up when the boat was recovered. Further reports showed that with the canopy installed the capacity rating of the boat was 14 people. There were 47 people on the boat the day of the incident. On November 4, the alcohol results from the toxicology center showed that the captain of the Ethan Allen did not drink alcohol on the day of the accident. =Indictment= On February 5, 2007, a grand jury indicted Richard Paris, the boat's captain, and Shoreline Cruises on misdemeanor charges of criminal negligence. Paris faced a maximum $250 fine and/or 15 days in jail if found guilty. The grand jury, which met for two months, also issued a report proposing new laws to prevent a repeat of the disaster. This was the third report about the capsizing. In March 2007, Paris pleaded guilty and received a fine of $250 and 200 hours of community service.  Reports  = Official police report = On February 3, 2006, the official police report for the Ethan Allen accident was released after a three-month delay. The report is 530 pages in three volumes, with all the information about the Ethan Allen. There are 84 pages written by survivors and 101 pages about police discussion. There has been much discussion over whether or not the Mohican did or did not pass the Ethan Allen, causing it to capsize. People around and on the lake at the time claim the Mohican had passed 20 minutes after the Ethan Allen had capsized. The pilot of the Ethan Allen, Richard Paris, stated: > I started to swing the bow of the boat to the right and immediately > encountered stray waves from the wake of the Mohican that was going > northbound. The entire boat then tipped to the left and just kept right on > going. Regardless of the actions or locations of other craft, the report concluded that the Ethan Allen incident was not a crime. =NTSB report= On July 25, 2006, the final report for the Ethan Allen boating accident was released by The National Transportation Safety Board. It established that Ethan Allen had capsized as a result of insufficient stability. The US Coast Guard was responsible for the original certification of the vessel, then called the Double Dolphin. She was originally certificated by the USCG for 48 passengers and 2 crew. When the owner of the Double Dolphin fitted the boat with an elaborate pipe structure and canvas top, the center of gravity was raised and, more importantly, the projected side area vastly increased. No retesting to either SST nor to Subchapter S is recorded to have occurred under Coast Guard oversight after those modifications were carried out. In the mid-1970s the boat along with two other sister vessels was sold to Shoreline Cruises in Lake George. The US Coast Guard certificates were at that point still current and valid. New York State vessel regulators were given those certificates and, based on the US Coast Guard officially stating (incorrectly) that the boat had sufficient reserve stability to safely carry 48 passengers and 2 crew, New York regulators then gave the boat the same rating. In 1989, when the owner had a hard (wood and fiberglass) top installed to replace the pipe structure canopy, it was determined that its lower height more than compensated for its slightly greater weight. The state of New York did not have any method in place for assessing vessel stability and the vessel received no further testing or oversight regarding stability. The NTSB carried out stability tests of a sistership, to both the SST and to subchapter S and discovered that there was not anywhere near a 47 person capacity. In fact 14 persons at the official 140 lb weight per person was as much as the Ethan Allen could have been certificated to. According to the NTSB, the capsizing occurred due to a series of events. The total load of 47 was far in excess of the safe passenger weight under prevailing U.S. laws, the pilot made a hard turn to the right at speed, the seating arrangement put three people on the left versus two on the right (giving a permanent two-degree list to port), and the bench seats had no way of stopping involuntary sliding, so the centrifugal force of the hard turn caused involuntary movement of the passengers to the port. That movement increased the list to port and the increased list caused more sliding. Within seconds the center of gravity was no longer over the hull and the boat rolled over.  Lawsuit  Memorial monument A lawsuit was brought by the victims and their families in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York against Shoreline Cruises; its affiliate Quirks Marine Rentals; boat captain Richard Paris; Scarano Boat Building Inc., which modified the Ethan Allen; Shoreline Travel & Tours Inc., a Canadian firm that organized the leaf-peeping tour; and the Lake George Steamboat Company, operator of the Mohican. On June 25, 2008, it was announced that Shoreline Cruises, Quirks, and Paris settled with the plaintiffs for undisclosed terms. In September 2008 a trial date for April 13, 2010 for the remaining defendants was announced. The portion of the suit against Scarano was dismissed because of a lack of evidence. It came to light that Shoreline Cruises had been sold a fraudulent liability insurance policy. Shoreline paid premiums for a $2 million policy for about two years before the Ethan Allen capsized. Two weeks after the incident, they were told the policy did not exist. The last lawsuit, in which the state of New York was named as a defendant because state boat inspectors were alleged to have been negligent, was dismissed by the state’s highest court in November 2012. The Court of Appeals found the state had “governmental immunity.”  Memorial  On February 1, 2006, a service to community ceremony was held at the Glens Falls Civic Center to recognize the people, including paid professionals, volunteers, and citizens, who helped during the accident. The names of the 20 people who died that day were read. An estimated 600 people attended the ceremony. Lake George Village Mayor Robert M. Blais said that plans were in the works for a memorial to recognize the victims and the survivors sometime around the one-year anniversary of the accident, October 2, 2006. The monument is in place on the shore near Lower Amherst Street.
