The pre-Columbian New World was in a time of general transition in many regions. Wari and Tiwanaku cultures receded in power and influence while Chachapoya and Chim√∫ cultures rose toward florescence in South America. In Mesoamerica, the Maya Terminal Classic period saw the decline of many grand polities of the Pet√©n like Palenque and Tikal yet a renewed vigor and greater construction phases of sites in the Yucat√°n region like Chich√©n Itz√° and Uxmal. Mitla, with Mixtec influence, became the more important site of the Zapotec, overshadowing the waning Monte Alb√°n. Cholula flourished in central Mexico, as did Tula, the center of Toltec culture. World population is estimated to have been between c. 250 and 310 million.310 million: United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division. 254 million: Jean-No√´l Biraben, 1980, \\"An Essay Concerning Mankind's Evolution\\", Population, Selected Papers, Vol. 4, pp. 1‚Äì13.  Events  =Americas= * The Ta√≠no have become the dominant culture of modern day Puerto Rico = Christendom = Europe in 1000 In continental Europe, the Holy Roman Empire established itself as the most powerful state. Otto III made a pilgrimage from Rome to Aachen and Gniezno (Gnesen), stopping at Regensburg, Meissen, Magdeburg, and Gniezno. The Congress of Gniezno (with Boles≈Çaw I Chrobry) was part of his pilgrimage. In Rome, he built the basilica of San Bartolomeo all'Isola, to host the relics of St. Bartholomew. In France, Robert II, the son of Hugh Capet, was the first of the Capetian kings. The Byzantine Empire under the Macedonian dynasty was engaged in a long and hard war with the First Bulgarian Empire. In the year 1000, the Byzantine generals Theodorokanos and Nikephoros Xiphias captured the former Bulgarian capitals of Pliska and Great Preslav, along with Little Preslav, extending Byzantine control over the northeastern portion of the Bulgarian state (Mysia and Scythia Minor). At the same time, Byzantium was instrumental in the Christianization of the Kievan Rus' and of other medieval Slavic states. In Great Britain, a unified Kingdom of England had developed out of the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In Scandinavia, Christianization was in its early stages, with the Althingi of the Icelandic Commonwealth embracing Christianity in the year 1000. On September 9, King Olaf Tryggvason was defeated by Denmark and Sweden in the Battle of Svolder. Sweyn I established Danish control over part of Norway. Oslo, Norway, was founded (the exact year is debatable, but the 1,000 year anniversary was held in the year 2000). The Papacy during this time was in a period of decline, in retrospect known as the saeculum obscurum (\\"Dark Age\\") or \\"pornocracy\\" (\\"rule of harlots\\"), a state of affairs that would result in the Great Schism later in the 11th century. Hungary was established in 1000 as a Christian state. In the next centuries, the Kingdom of Hungary became the pre-eminent cultural power in the Central European region. On December 25, Stephen I was crowned as the first King of Hungary in Esztergom. Sancho III of Navarre became King of Aragon and Navarre. The Reconquista was gaining some ground, but the southern Iberian peninsula would still be dominated by Islam for centuries to come; C√≥rdoba at this time was the world's largest city with 450,000 inhabitants. It is known that in or around this year, Norse explorer Leif Ericson became the first European to land in the Americas, at L'Anse aux Meadows in modern-day Newfoundland. * The Ch√¢teau de Goulaine vineyard was founded in France. * The archdiocese in Gniezno was founded; the first archbishop was Gaudentius (Radim), from Slavn√≠k's dynasty, and dioceses in Ko≈Çobrzeg, Krak√≥w and Wroc≈Çaw. * The Bell foundry was founded in Italy by Pontificia Fonderia Marinelli. = Muslim world = The Islamic world was in its Golden Age; still organised in caliphates, it continued to be dominated by the Abbasid Caliphate, with the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba to the west, and experienced ongoing campaigns in Africa and in India. Persia was in a period of instability, with various polities seceding from Abassid rule, among whom the Ghaznavids would emerge as the most powerful. The Islamic world was reaching the peak of its historical scientific achievements. Important scholars and scientists who flourished in AD 1000 include Abu al-Qasim (Abulcasis), Ibn Yunus (publishes his astronomical treatise Al-Zij al-Hakimi al-Kabir in Cairo in c. 1000), Abu Sahl al-Quhi (Kuhi), Abu-Mahmud al- Khujandi, Abu Nasr Mansur, Abu al-Wafa, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Al-Muqaddasi, Ali Ibn Isa, and al-Karaji (al-Karkhi). Ibn al-Haytham (Book of Optics), Avicenna, and Abu Rayhan al-Biruni, who all flourished around the year 1000, are considered to be among the greatest scientists of the Middle Ages altogether. The Turkic migration by this time had reached Eastern Europe, and most of the Turkic tribes (Khazars, Bulghars, Pechenegs etc.) had been Islamized.

At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Maximus and Aquilinus (or, less frequently, year 1039 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 286 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.  Events  = By place =  Roman Empire  * April 1 - Emperor Diocletian elevates his friend Maximian to co-emperor, giving him the title Augustus. The Bagaudae are crushed, after their revolt in Gaul. * Carausius, commander of the Classis Britannica, is accused of piracy and sentenced to death. He responds by declaring himself emperor of Britain and Northwestern Gaul. His forces consist of the newly built Roman fleet and three legions in Britain.

At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Basiliscus and Armatus (or, less frequently, year 1229 Ab urbe condita). The denomination 476 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

He petitions Orestes (magister militum) to reward his mercenaries for their services and their support of his rebellion a year earlier, by making good on his promise to grant them lands to settle permanently in Italy. Orestes refuses this proposal and Odoacer leads his tribesmen in a revolt. * August - Basiliscus, Roman usurper, is deposed and Zeno is restored as emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire. With the support of his adviser Illus, he besieges Constantinople, but the Senate opens the gates, allowing him to resume the throne. Basiliscus flees to sanctuary in a church, but surrenders himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus is sent to a fortress in Cappadocia, where he later dies from starvation. * August 23 - Odoacer, age 43, is proclaimed rex Italiae (\\"king of Italy\\") by his troops.

Odoacer spares the boy's life and gives him a pension of 6,000 solidi, but exiles him to the \\"Castellum Lucullanum\\" (Castel dell'Ovo), on the island of Megaride in the Gulf of Naples. This event will later be romanticized in Western literature and history as the Fall of Rome, and is traditionally used by historians to mark the beginning of the European Middle Ages. * Julius Nepos, de jure ruler, becomes legally the last \\"Western Roman Emperor.\\" He governs Dalmatia (Balkans), Morocco, and Northwest Gaul until his death in 480, but has no effective power on the Italian Peninsula. * Odoacer crosses the Maritime Alps with a Gothic army and invades Provence (Southern Gaul). He conquers the cities of Arles and Marseilles, after a victorious battle against the Burgundians. * The Visigoths under King Euric march into Italy, and suffer defeat against the forces of Odoacer. Emperor Zeno concludes a peace treaty between the Goths and Odoacer surrenders the newly conquered territory in Gaul. Euric pledges himself to undertake no further hostilities. * The Roman Senate petitions Zeno to recognize Nepos as deposed and take the sole emperorship himself, abolishing the 91 year-long east/west division of the empire and recognizing Odoacer's authority in Italy. Zeno declines the first request, but names Odoacer Patricius, investing his rule with Imperial legitimacy. * Winter - Zeno recognizes the full extent of the Vandal Kingdom, including all of western Africa, the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia and Sicily. King Gaiseric gives Sicily, with the exception of the city of Lilybaeum, to Odoacer in return for tribute.

Diogenes, the philosopher he met years before just about when he was to set out on his conquests, allegedly dies on the exact same day. * The Partition of Babylon sets out the division of the territories conquered by Alexander the Great between his generals. The partition is a result of a compromise, essentially brokered by Eumenes, following a conflict of opinion between the party of Meleager, who wishes to give full power to Philip III (the illegitimate son of King Philip II of Macedon by Philinna of Larissa), and the party of Perdiccas, who wishes to wait for the birth of the heir of Alexander and his wife, Roxana (the future Alexander IV) to give him the throne under the control of a regent. * Under the agreement, Philip III becomes king, but Perdiccas, as the regent, effectively becomes the ruler of Alexander's empire. Perdiccas manages the partition of the territories between the former generals and satraps of Alexander who support him in his dispute with Meleager.

Although initially reluctant to assist, lest it encourage other mercenary groups to mutiny, Rome is unwilling to see Carthaginian power spread further over Sicily and encroach on Italy.

However, the Carthaginian army is allowed to return home with its arms. Rome is now the dominant power in the Western Mediterranean basin.

On arrival in Carthaginian territory, the mercenaries submit a demand to Hanno the Great for payment of their contracts. Hanno attempts, unsuccessfully, to convince the mercenaries to accept smaller payments due to Carthage's impoverished post-war conditions. Negotiations break down.

Hasdrubal, the second son of Hamilcar Barca, is left in command of Spain when his brother Hannibal begins his campaign. * Hannibal sets out with around 40,000 men and 50 elephants from New Carthage (Cartagena) to northern Spain and then into the Pyrenees where his army meets with stiff resistance from the Pyrenean tribes. This opposition and the desertion of some of his Spanish troops greatly diminishes his numbers, but he reaches the Rh√¥ne River facing little resistance from the tribes of southern Gaul. * After crossing the Rh√¥ne River and meeting with friendly Gallic leaders headed by the northern Italian Boii, whose knowledge of the Alpine passes are of assistance to Hannibal, the Carthaginians cross the Durance River. Hannibal's army approaches the Alps either by the Col de Grimone or the Col de Cabre, then through the basin of the Durance descending into the territory of the hostile Taurini, where Hannibal storms their chief town (modern Turin).

Realizing that Hannibal probably plans to cross the Alps, Scipio returns to northern Italy to await him.

Longus managed to capture Malta from the Carthaginians. * A Roman army under Scipio rushes to the Po River to protect the recently founded Roman colonies of Placentia (modern Piacenza) and Cremona.

The year 1500 was not a leap year in the Proleptic Gregorian calendar. The year was seen as being especially important by many Christians in Europe, who thought it would bring the beginning of the end of the world.

Historically, this class of cartridge was commonly known as .30 caliber, the imperial unit equivalent, and was most commonly used for indicating a class of full-power military main battle rifle (MBR) cartridges. The measurement equals 0.30 inches or three decimal lines, written .3‚Ä≥ and read as three-line.Holt Bodinson: The old Three-Line: still a great value, Guns Magazine, Nov, 2006 The 7.62 mm designation refers to the internal diameter of the barrel at the lands (the raised helical ridges in rifled gun barrels). The actual bullet caliber is often , although Soviet weapons commonly use a bullet, as do older British (.303 British) and Japanese cartridges. Pistol cartridges in 7.62 mm caliber Many pistol cartridges are in this caliber; the most common are: * 7.62√ó25mm Tokarev, also known as 7.62 mm TT, is used in the Tokarev pistol, and many of the World War II Soviet submachine guns * 7.63√ó25mm Mauser, which was the basis for, and has nearly identical dimensions to, the Tokarev, but has different loading specifications. * 7.65√ó25mm Borchardt, from which both the Mauser and Parabellum cartridges were developed * 7.65√ó21mm Parabellum * 7.65√ó17mm Browning, also known as .32 ACP Revolver cartridges in 7.62 mm caliber Some of the revolver cartridges in this caliber are: * 7.62√ó38mmR is used only in the Nagant M1895 revolver. * .32 Long Colt - originally chambered for small-frame Colt revolvers and the Marlin model 1892 rifle, this cartridge uses a heeled bullet with a case the same diameter as the major diameter of the bullet. It shares dimensions with the .32 rimfire cartridge of the same length. It is not to be confused with the .32 Colt's New Police cartridge. * .32 S&W; Long is also known as .32 Colt's New Police when chambered in Colt revolvers. The original loading for this cartridge used a round nose, or flattened round nose (in the case of the .32 Colt's N.P.) and was chambered widely in revolvers made in the US and Europe through World War II. This cartridge is used in several modern target pistols (not revolvers) with flush- seated wadcutters. The short version of this cartridge (.32 S&W;) was chambered in many break-top revolvers at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries in the US and Europe. * .32 H&R; Magnum is the only revolver cartridge in this caliber in wide use today, mostly in small-frame revolvers. This is an extended version of the much earlier .32 S&W; Long, which is an extended version of the .32 S&W.; * .327 Federal Magnum is a new cartridge developed jointly by Ruger and Federal. This cartridge is an extended version of the .32 H&R; Magnum. Rifle cartridges in 7.62 mm caliber The most common and historical rifle cartridges in this caliber are: * .30 Carbine, used in the M1/M2/M3 carbines, is sometimes called the 7.62√ó33mm. * 300 AAC Blackout (7.62√ó35mm), also known as 300 BLK, is designed for the M4 carbine and STANAG magazine. * Soviet 7.62√ó39mm, also known as 7.62 mm Soviet, M43, or occasionally .30 Short Combloc, is designed for the SKS and used in the AK-47 and AKM []s, and RPK and RPD light machine guns. * 7.62√ó40mm Wilson Tactical * 7.62√ó45mm vz. 52, made solely for the Czechoslovakian vz. 52 rifle, was replaced by 7.62√ó39mm. * 7.62√ó51mm NATO and its civilian variant .308 Winchester, sometimes described as .308 NATO by persons mixing English measurements, is used by some civilians, with metric measurements used by NATO. * 7.62√ó54mmR, another Russian cartridge, it was first used in the Mosin‚ÄìNagant rifle in 1891. The modern versions of the cartridges are now in wide use in numerous world armies as sniper rifles (particularly the SVD family) and machine guns (numerous types, many developed from AK family, such as the PKM). * .30-06 Springfield, a US military cartridge used in both world wars and Korea, is known as the 7.62√ó63mm in metric measurement. * .303 British, used in Lee‚ÄìMetford and Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifles, is known as 7.7√ó56mmR in metric measurement. * 7.7√ó58mm Arisaka is used in the Type 99, Type 2 and Type 4 rifles. * 7.65√ó53mm Argentine is used in various Mauser bolt-action rifles, primarily in Belgium, Turkey, and Argentina. * .308 Norma Magnum * .300 Norma Magnum * .300 Winchester Magnum is used by many hunting and sniper rifles, sometimes called the 7.62√ó67mm. * .300 Winchester Short Magnum * .300 Lapua Magnum, 7.62√ó70mm * .30-30 Winchester, a popular deer hunting cartridge, is typically used in lever-action rifles, such as the Winchester Model 1894 and Marlin Model 336, and is adapted to European sporting guns as 7.62√ó51mmR. * .30 R Blaser, used in break-action rifles for hunting medium to large game * .30 Thompson Center (.30 TC) 30TC * .30-378 Weatherby Magnum *30-40 Krag See also * List of rifle cartridges * 7 mm caliber * :7.62 mm firearms * M14 rifle References Ammunition Pistol and rifle cartridges 7.62 mm firearms ","title":"7.62 mm caliber"},{"id":"35024","text":"The 800s decade ran from January 1, 800, to December 31, 809.
