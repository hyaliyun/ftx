Durant attempts to show the interconnection of their ideas and how one philosopher's ideas informed the next. There are nine chapters each focused on one philosopher, and two more chapters each containing briefer profiles of three early 20th century philosophers. The book was published in 1926, with a revised second edition released in 1933. The work was preceded by a number of pamphlets in the Little Blue Books series of inexpensive worker education pamphlets.\\"Little Blue Books\\" They proved so popular they were assembled into a single book and published in hardcover form by Simon & Schuster in 1926. Philosophers profiled are, in order: Plato (with a section on Socrates), Aristotle, Francis Bacon, Baruch Spinoza (with a section on Descartes), Voltaire (with a section on Rousseau), Immanuel Kant (with a section on Hegel), Arthur Schopenhauer, Herbert Spencer, and Friedrich Nietzsche. The final two chapters are devoted to European and then American philosophers. Henri Bergson, Benedetto Croce, and Bertrand Russell are covered in the tenth, and George Santayana, William James, and John Dewey are covered in the eleventh. In a foreword to the readers in the second edition of the book, Durant expresses his acknowledgement for the criticism that the book received as to how it does not include philosophers from the Asian continent, most notably Confucius, Buddha and Adi Shankara. This work is also the source of a famous quote, almost always misattributed to Aristotle himself: \\"We are what we repeatedly do.

History The word picul appeared as early as the mid 9th century in Javanese. Following Spanish, Portuguese, British and most especially the Dutch colonial maritime trade, the term picul was both a convenient unit, and a lingua franca unit that was widely understood and employed by other Austronesians (in modern Malaysia and the Philippines) and their centuries-old trading relations with Indians, Chinese and Arabs. It remained a convenient reference unit for many commercial trade journals in the 19th century. One example is Hunts Merchant Magazine of 1859 giving detailed tables of expected prices of various commodities, such as coffee, e.g. one picul of Javanese coffee could be expected to be bought from 8 to 8.50 Spanish dollars in Batavia and Singapore.Freeman Hunt, Thomas Prentice Kettell, William Buck Dana.

A fullback in both codes, Ridge played rugby union for Auckland and became an All Black, but never won an international cap. He turned professional in 1990 with the Manly- Warringah Sea Eagles of the New South Wales Rugby League, and won the 1996 ARL Premiership. He later captained the Auckland Warriors and New Zealand national team (the Kiwis). An accurate goal-kicker, he set several scoring records in rugby league. He is now best known for his work in television alongside his partner Marc Ellis in shows including Game of Two Halves and Marc & Matthew's Rocky Road to‚Ä¶. Rugby union career Ridge was educated at Mount Albert Grammar School and Auckland Grammar School. He was selected for Auckland age- group teams and played for New Zealand Secondary Schools in 1986. In 1988, while still aged 18, he made his first-class debut for the New Zealand Colts and played one match for Auckland. In the 1989 season, Ridge made rapid progress with Ponsonby and as part of the dominant Auckland team of that time. Ridge was selected for the All Blacks' British tour in 1989. He played six games on the undefeated tour, but could not displace John Gallagher from the test team. Seeing his path to playing international rugby blocked by Gallagher, Ridge decided to move to rugby league in 1990 without ever winning a New Zealand cap. Only days later, Gallagher announced that he too was switching codes, signing for Leeds. Rugby league career Despite never having played a game of rugby league in his life, Ridge was signed by the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles and their Kiwi coach Graham Lowe to play in the New South Wales Rugby League's Winfield Cup competition from 1990. Ridge made his debut at fullback for the Sea Eagles in their Round 10 clash with Cronulla at Manly's home ground, Brookvale Oval. He became the team's first choice goal kicker ahead of captain and dual rugby international Michael O'Connor and part-time kicker Mal Cochrane when he kicked 6/7 in his first game helping 10th placed Manly to a 28‚Äì8 win over the 3rd placed Sharks. Ridge ended the 1990 season as Manly's leading scorer with 94 points (2 tries, 43/57 goals) in 11 games. Just six games into his rugby league career, Ridge played his first test for New Zealand against the touring Great Britain Lions. On 8 July 1990 at the Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland, Ridge kicked 5 goals as the Kiwis went down 16‚Äì14 in front of 7,843 fans. He backed this up a week later with another six-goal performance in helping New Zealand to a 21‚Äì18 win over the Lions at Queen Elizabeth II Park in Christchurch. Despite good form for Manly in 1991, Ridge missed selection for the mid-season Trans-Tasman Test series against Australia due to a dispute over compensation between clubs and the New Zealand Rugby League (NZRL) which also ruled out Daryl Halligan, John Schuster and Kurt Sherlock.Lion Red Rugby League Annual 1991 New Zealand Rugby League, 1991. pp. 25‚Äì36 Ridge's 'defection' from rugby union to rugby league was the subject of a TV documentary, In a Different League. It was hosted and narrated by his friend and former teammate John Kirwan who himself switched to league with the Auckland Warriors in 1995. The documentary, broadcast in 1991, showed Ridge's early days with Manly and his introduction to test football with the New Zealand team, as well as the reaction when John Gallagher also switched to league a week after Ridge.In a Different League - Matthew Ridge documentary After an injury-interrupted 1992 season when Ridge regained his place as the Kiwis' fullback for the two tests against the touring Great Britain team, the 1993 season started solidly. However, he was sidelined for the rest of the year after suffering a knee injury. The injury saw him miss selection for the mid-season Trans-Tasman series against as well as the end of year Kiwi tour of Great Britain and France. Ridge returned to form in 1994, playing 23 games for Manly and scoring 234 points (5 tries, 106/132 goals) for the season. He also regained the Kiwi #1 jumper when he was selected for the two tests against Papua New Guinea in October. Ridge played and kicked goals in each of the 1995 Trans-Tasman Test series' three games against Australia, though the Kiwis lost the series 0‚Äì3 (he kicked 7/8 during the series, only missing his first kick in the 3rd test). Ridge was knocked out attempting to tackle Australian winger Rod Wishart in the first half of the final test at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, won 46‚Äì10 by Australia. Ridge finished the 1995 ARL season as the league's top point-scorer with a club record 257 points (11 tries, 106 goals and 1 field goal), breaking Graham Eadie's record of 242 points. At the end of the season he played for the Sea Eagles at fullback in their 4‚Äì17 Grand final loss against the Sydney Bulldogs. Ridge captained the New Zealand team at the 1995 Rugby League World Cup in England and Wales. The Kiwis finished in third place, losing a hard-fought semi-final 20‚Äì30 to Australia after extra-time in Huddersfield. In 1996 Ridge, a prominent supporter of Super League in the dispute which split the sport, sat out nine weeks of the season when the new competition was put on hold. However, Manly won the ARL Grand Final, defeating the Dragons, with Ridge playing a major part. In 1997 Ridge moved to the Auckland Warriors who had switched to the Super League during the Super League war. In total, Ridge scored 1,093 points in 122 first grade games for Manly between 1990 and 1996 (32 tries, 477/599 goals @ 79.63%, 11 Fg ), putting him then third on the all-time Sea Eagles point scorers list behind fullbacks Bob Batty and Graham Eadie. Ridge's total currently sees him in fourth place. Along the way, he set the Sea Eagles' records for single season scoring (257 points in 1995 from 11 tries, 106 goals and 1 field goal), and points in a match - 30 points (2 tries, 11 goals) against Western Suburbs in 1996. Ridge spent the 1997 Super League season as captain of the Warriors, though injuries kept him to just 9 games. He also captained New Zealand in a Super League test match against Australia in 1997. In 1998 he wrote an autobiography with Angus Gillies, Take No Prisoners, published by Hodder Moa Beckett. He continued as captain of the Warriors in the 1998 NRL season and the first half of the Warriors' 1999 season. However, in the 1999 season he was sent off and suspended three times, missing twelve weeks, and he retired after the season. In total he scored 238 points in 37 first grade games for the New Zealand Warriors between 1997 and his retirement in 1999 (8 tries, 103 goals). At the time of his retirement he was the all-time top scorer in international matches for the New Zealand national rugby league team with 168 points (6 tries, 71 goals) from 25 test appearances. He finished his rugby league club career with 1,331 total points (40 tries, 582/723 goals @ 80.22%, 11 field goals) from 159 games (Manly 122, Auckland 37), an average of 8.37 points per club game.

The regiment formed part of the army reserves of the Auxiliary Force, India (AFI). The regimental dress uniform was Hunting Stewart tartan. The regiment was disbanded following India's independence in 1947. History =Formation= An attempt was made to raise two kilted companies of \\"Calcutta Scottish\\" within the Calcutta Rifles, but apparently without success. This may account for the date for the raising of the Regiment being given as 1 August 1911 in Major Donovan Jackson‚Äôs work India‚Äôs Army. On 1 August 1914, The Calcutta Scottish Volunteers were formed as part of the Indian Volunteer Force. King's and Regimental Colours were awarded. =First World War= The regiment probably deployed only as individual reinforcements. Some officers are known to have gone to East Africa, but there is no other record of deployment as a unit. There is reference to Calcutta Volunteer Machine Guns armed with Maxim guns which may have included officers and men from the Calcutta Scottish. On 1 April 1917, the regiment was redesignated the 44th Calcutta Scottish. In 1919, the 44th was called out for over two months to deal with \\"communal riots\\". =Postwar= On 1 October 1920, the regiment was redesignated The Calcutta Scottish (Army Auxiliary Force, India) and in 1921 included a Light Motor Patrol armed with Maxim guns (later Vickers, then Lewis, then Brens) but mounted in private cars. In 1921 the Prince of Wales visited the East in and on a visit to the city on 24 December inspected the Calcutta Scottish. In 1926 the unit was called out for over two months, (reason not known, possibly riots?) and was again inspected by the Prince of Wales in 1928. In 1930 the Calcutta Scottish was called out as an aid to the civil power for over two months, during which small detachments were deployed on 18 occasions. =Second World War= The regiment provided a detachment of four men for \\"Operation Creek\\", a SOE operation against Axis shipping in Goa in 1942. The lead unit was the Calcutta Light Horse. In 1946 the regiment was reorganised to consist of an HQ, two companies and four motor platoons, and was disbanded in 1947 upon India's independence.

Operations Operation Creek was described in the 1978 book Boarding Party by James Leasor. A \\"factional\\" account in which, for ostensibly deniable purposes, the Calcutta Light Horse, reinforced by four members of the Calcutta Scottish, raided the neutral port of Marmagoa on 9 March 1943. In the port, the German ship Ehrenfels had been providing information to three German U-boats, on the movement of Allied shipping with the result that some 250,000 tons of British shipping had been sunk over a period of 45 days. After a journey from Calcutta, via Bombay, in the hopper barge Phoebe, the Ehrenfels was boarded and destroyed along with two other German ships, and one Italian ship. The film The Sea Wolves, released in June 1981, was based on the book and starred Gregory Peck, Roger Moore, David Niven and Trevor Howard. It was filmed on location in Goa.

Otis Carter Formby King (1876-1944) was a grocer and engineer in London who invented and produced a cylindrical slide rule with helical scales, primarily for business uses initially. The product was named Otis King's Patent Calculator, and was manufactured and sold by Carbic Ltd. in London from about 1922 to about 1972. With a log-scale decade length of 66 inches, the Otis King calculator should be about a full digit more accurate than a 6-inch pocket slide rule. But due to inaccuracies in tic-mark placement, some portions of its scales will read off by more than they should. For example, a reading of 4.630 might represent an answer of 4.632, or almost one part in 2000 error, when it should be accurate to one part in 6000 (66\\"/6000 = 0.011\\" estimated interpolation accuracy). The Geniac brand cylindrical slide rule sold by Oliver Garfield Company in New York was initially a relabelled Otis King; Garfield later made his own, probably unauthorized version of the Otis King (around 1959). The UK patents covering the mechanical device(s) would have expired in about 1941-1942 (i.e. 20 years after filing of the patent) but copyright in the drawings would typically only expire 70 years after the author's death.

As the largest city in the fiercely divided border state of Missouri and the most important economic hub on the upper Mississippi River, St. Louis was a major launching point and supply depot for campaigns in the Western and Trans- Mississippi Theaters. Background Located at the junction of the Missouri, Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, St. Louis was a major port and commercial center with a rapidly growing industrial base. The population reached 160,000 in 1860 and consisted mostly of recent immigrants, especially Catholic German Americans and Irish Americans. Early Union volunteer regiments in St. Louis were composed largely of the dominant German immigrants. The only major city west of the Mississippi River in the geographic center of the country, St. Louis had also emerged as the gateway to the new American frontier. It had long served as the starting point for voyages of exploration and emigration into the unsettled West and as the westernmost terminus of many early efforts to construct transcontinental lines of transportation and communication. Camp Jackson Affair In March 1861, Captain Nathaniel Lyon arrived in St. Louis in command of Company B of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Regiment. At the time, the state of Missouri was relatively neutral in the dispute between North and South, but newly elected Missouri Governor Claiborne Fox Jackson was a strong Southern sympathizer. Lyon was concerned that Jackson meant to seize the federal arsenal in St. Louis if the state seceded and that the Union had insufficient defensive forces to prevent its capture. He attempted to strengthen the defenses, but came into opposition with his superiors, including Brigadier General William S. Harney of the Department of the West. Lyon employed his friendship with Francis P. Blair, Jr. to have himself named commander of the arsenal. When the Civil War broke out and President Abraham Lincoln called for troops to put down the Confederacy, Missouri was asked to supply four regiments. Governor Jackson refused the request and ordered the Missouri militia to muster outside St. Louis under the stated purpose of training for home defense. Lyon allegedly disguised himself as a farm woman to spy on the militia camp and confirmed the presence of artillery stolen from a federal arsenal. Lyon himself had been extensively involved in the St. Louis Wide Awakes, a pro-Union paramilitary organization that he intended to arm with the arsenal's supplies and muster into the ranks of the federal army. Upon obtaining command of the arsenal, Lyon armed the Wide Awake units under guise of night. Lyon had most of the weapons in the arsenal secretly moved across the river to Illinois, and on May 10, he led the 2nd Infantry to the camp, forcing its surrender. Riots broke out in St. Louis after Lyon marched his prisoners through the city. The event provoked the Camp Jackson Affair of May 10, 1861, in which Lyons' troops opened fire on a crowd of civilians, killing 28 and injuring at least 90. The Camp Jackson Affair polarized the population of Missouri, leading many once-neutral citizens to advocate secession and setting the stage for sustained violence between the opposing factions. St. Louis Riot The division of loyalties between Union and Confederacy resulted in further loss of life on May 11, 1861. Union soldiers of the Fifth Regiment, United States Reserve Corps, Missouri Volunteers were attacked by Confederate sympathizers within hours of being mustered into service. The regiment was marching from the federal arsenal when it was attacked on the corner of Walnut and Broadway. Shots were exchanged, and six persons were killed. The Fifth Regiment consisted primarily of loyal Germans, having been recruited from the city's Tenth Ward. Civil War During the Civil War, St. Louis stayed under Union control because of the strong military base and public support from loyal Germans. The largest percentage of volunteers served in the Union army, though many also went south to fight for the Confederacy. Some people who stayed in the city during the war and supported the South smuggled supplies, medicine, and otherwise assisted Confederate soldiers. No major battles were fought in or near the city, but the Mississippi River was a vital highway during the war. Divided loyalties to the Union and Confederacy caused rifts in some families in St. Louis. This divide remained consistent throughout the entirety of the war. Though many believed in the cause of abolition, others were concerned about the economic response and potential destruction of critical infrastructure in the blossoming city. Benton Barracks was a Union Army military encampment established during the war at the present site of the St. Louis Fairground Park. After the Battle of Lexington, the Post and Convalescent Hospitals were added to the training barracks, in order to assist in treating hundreds of incoming wounded troops.

According to this doctrine, Adam and Eve were created without sin (a point that all Christian churches agree upon), and this original righteousness meant that a number of conditions that are now \\"natural\\" did not apply. Humans were, in such a state, united with their essence, and therefore their forms were, as their spirits, untainted. The Adamic man was immortal, experienced no excess of desire (in either lust or gluttony or greed), and had neither obesity nor starvation. The concept of original righteousness shows up throughout discussions of the lost Eden in Western literature. The twentieth-century poet Gerard Manley Hopkins's poetry consistently addresses the implications of \\"natural\\" and \\"nature\\" falling with man's sin. The fall of man is, in this theological scheme, a fall of nature as well (for nature, too, was perfect and essential only in the Garden of Eden), and man's own sin causes it to contain evil. Additionally, the loss of original righteousness is important to both concepts of what the essence of man is (e.g. whether man is essentially perverse or some righteousness remains in a mitigated form), the nature of the resurrection of the dead into perfected flesh at the last judgment (e.g. whether it is a figurative or literal recasting of perfected bodies for the risen), and the nature of the forcefulness of grace (e.g. if man's soul is entirely depraved, then grace must carry more force than if man has an echo of original righteousness). Few churches disagree with the fundamentals of the concept of original righteousness, but the exact nature of the human in a state of original righteousness is rejected or amplified by some denominations. Some of those who deny the Augustinian doctrine of the transmission of original sin hold that infants are in pure righteousness; although this view is not widespread, it has been used in discussions of infant baptism.

In 1977, while on a tour of the ASEAN member states, the prime minister made a speech in Manila in which he articulated Japan's foreign policy that later became known as the Fukuda Doctrine. Prime Minister Fukuda pledged that Japan, a country committed to peace, would never become a military power and that Japan would build up a relationship of mutual confidence and trust with Southeast Asian countries in wide-ranging fields, and that Japan would cooperate positively with ASEAN and its member countries in their own efforts, as an equal partner. The Fukuda Doctrine serves as the foundation of Japan's current and future diplomacy toward the rest of Asia.  Historical background  Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda = Takeo Fukuda = Takeo Fukuda was an expert in economics. He took on the role of an ‚Äòeconomic prime minister‚Äô under Miki's administration from 1974 to 1976. During this time, he established the Ministerial Conference on Economic Measures, enabling cross-ministry and agency talks on finance, wage and labor issues. Fukuda subsequently became the 67th prime minister of Japan, lasting for only one term from 1976 to 1978. However, he was not forced out of office before he had gotten two major diplomatic reforms executed. Under Fukuda cabinet, Japan conducted an omnidirectional peace diplomacy, and signed Japan-China Treaty of Peace and Friendship in 1978. He pushed forward Japan's pacifistic position while making an effort to strengthen relations with Asian countries. = Phases of Japan‚Äôs Southeast Asian Policy prior to the Fukuda Doctrine = After the Second World War, Japan's policies towards Southeast Asia, can be divided into two distinct phases - a period of reparations (1952-1964) and a period of regional economic development (1965-1975). The historic events and the features of those periods have contributed to the development of Fukuda Doctrine and the subsequent policies towards the region.  Period of Reparations (1952-1964)  The first period in the relationship between Japan and Southeast Asia, can be characterized by Shigeru Yoshida‚Äôs ‚ÄúEconomic Diplomacy‚Äù, officially promulgated in 1957. The so-called ‚ÄúYoshida Doctrine‚Äù put high priority on development and aimed at peaceful expansion of Japan's economic power in foreign markets, in order to rebuild the economy and raise the living standards of the Japanese population. As a part of this policy, Japan sought to improve ties with the Southeast Asian region. Reparations settlements between Japan and Southeast Asian countries played a significant role in such environment as they served as a tool which provided a ground for rebuilding of the relations, severed by Japanese aggression during the war. During this period, Japan paid reparations to Burma, Philippines, Indonesia, Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam). Other than reparations in the strict sense, Japan also provided ‚Äúquasi-reparations‚Äù in the form of grants and aid to Laos, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore. This way, reparation payments paved the way for Japan's economic involvement in Southeast Asia, allowing it to pursue economic interest in the region. Another aspect of this period, again motivated by the goal of expanding Japan's economy, is the policy of a triangular relationship with the US and Southeast Asia. This strategy, coordinated with US Cold War policies, aimed at bringing together Japanese know-how, US capital and Southeast Asian raw materials, in order to secure strategic resources and sustain the economic growth.  Period of Regional Economic Development (1965-1975)  The second phase of Japanese policy towards Southeast Asia is characterized with the active involvement of Japan in the region's development. This was partly due to the increasing pressure from the international community that Japan share a burden on the international arena as a ‚Äúdeveloped‚Äù country. On the other hand, this shift towards participation in the region was motivated by the new US policy on the development of Southeast Asia that aimed to protect South Vietnam from communist expansion. These changes contributed to the extensive Japanese engagement towards Southeast Asia, manifested through huge investments of capital and the involvement in development plans and projects. During this period Japan assisted the establishment of Asian Development Bank; the Asian and Pacific Council (ASPAC); the Ministerial Conference for the Economic Development of Southeast Asia etc. In spite of the increased involvement, however, the essence of the Japanese policy didn‚Äôt change significantly, as it remained focused on the triangular relationship it was fostering. During the early 1970s Japan was at the turning point for its post-war process, after Okinawa's reversion, and the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. However it had no clear vision for its future diplomatic policies. Meanwhile, the international society continued viewing Japan as solely pursuing its own economic interests. With the end of the Vietnam war in 1975 and the US withdrawal from the region, Japan was expected to take on international responsibility in Southeast Asia. As a result, Japan became determined that as the second-biggest economic power at the time, it should make international contribution to the region, setting the starting point of the vision of the Fukuda doctrine. = Japan-ASEAN relations prior to the Fukuda Doctrine (1967-1977) = Japan initially viewed ASEAN as economically strategic, but remained insouciant to the association until the early 1970s. ASEAN was established at a time when the Japanese government was prioritizing the reversion of Okinawa from the United States over an active role in the ASEAN region. When Japan was rid of the Okinawa problem, attitude towards ASEAN had already turned negative. ASEAN's adoption of a neutralization policy in 1971 was deleterious to Japan's foreign policy on supporting an organization whom incorporated neutralization. Towards 1975, however, the Tokyo government had no choice but to abandon its foreign policy on minimal involvement with organization embodying neutralization, and to establish negotiations with ASEAN countries. The growing fear of Japan's economic domination amongst Southeast Asian nations resulted in collective actions by ASEAN against Japan, exemplified by acute anti-Japanese demonstrations. Changes in Southeast Asian security environment following the new realities of 1975 engendered a major shift in Japan's approach to foreign policy in the region. Prior to 1975, conflict between East and West defined the security of ASEAN in purely military terms, which also meant the insignificant role of Japan in the view of ASEAN nations. After the liberation of Vietnam and the fall of Kampuchea government to the communists, combined with the declining presence of American forces in Southeast Asia, ASEAN nations began to perceive their own security in terms of raising the standard living of their people. The recognition that military power alone could not secure ASEAN interests gave way to a new priority of economic well-being. This change in priority led to a redefinition of security from that of a military perspective to one that was economic, wherein Japan could play a decisive role in contributing to ASEAN economic development and political stability.  Core Elements of the Doctrine  = Japan Rejects the Role of a Military Power = \\"First, Japan, a nation committed to peace, rejects the role of a military power‚Äù Fukuda stated that even though Japan had the capability to rearm and to produce nuclear weapons, it steered clear of resurrecting its military past. Fukuda used article 9 of the 1946 constitution to reassert Japan's pacifist stance post-war. For the ASEAN nations and Southeast Asia as a whole, this statement served as a psychological reassurance to the memories of Japanese aggression in the second world war. = Japan Increases Mutual Confidence and Trust = \\"Second, Japan, as a true friend of the countries of Southeast Asia will do its best for consolidating the relationship of mutual confidence and trust based on ‚Äúheart-to-heart‚Äù understanding with these countries‚Äù The Prime Minister called for mutual confidence and trust between Japan and ASEAN by emphasizing the words ‚Äúheart to heart‚Äù in his definition of a development of relation between Japan and ASEAN. = Japan as an Equal Partner of ASEAN: Mutual Dependence = \\"Third, Japan will be an equal partner of ASEAN and its member countries, and cooperate positively with them in their own efforts to strengthen their solidarity and resilience\\" Fukuda declared Japan as ‚Äúan equal partner‚Äù who would ‚Äúwalk hand-in-hand with ASEAN.‚Äù The word ‚Äúequal‚Äù implied the fear of Japanese economic dominance (‚Äúeconomic animal‚Äù) amongst ASEAN members ‚Äì by being ‚Äúan equal partner,‚Äù Japan would no longer seek dominance in the Asian scene nor would it regard other Asian nations as inferior to itself.  Goals of the Doctrine  = Role of Securing Stable Coexistence between ASEAN and Indochina = Japan's efforts to providing itself a political role in ASEAN and Indochina was dubbed a neo-realist approach, made possible by a declining United States presence and commitments in Southeast Asia. This approach, manifested by the rejection of military force and emphasis on economic power, demonstrated Japan's belief in the use of soft power. It was for this very reason that Japan was so keen on encouraging the development of multilateralism in Southeast Asia. This approach to foreign policy in a sense was intended to establish a ‚Äòpolitical coordination‚Äô between Japan and ASEAN as a regional actor. Fukuda had warned, in the area of trade, it was not in Japan's interest to form an exclusivist economic bloc with ASEAN. The Prime Minister's warning in effect functioned as a switch to a ‚Äòpolitical role‚Äô in ASEAN and Indochina from its conventional practice of providing economic assistance. Moreover, by forging close diplomatic ties, what Sueo Sudo calls a ‚Äòspecial relationship,‚Äô with the organization through the use of FDI, ODA and other financial aids, Japan would try to establish a greater role for itself in the development of ASEAN region. Fukuda further implied Japan's responsibility in the region and its larger role as a world leader by acting as an informant on current developments in international issues that could directly affect member nations. = Provide an Alternative to the Soviet Union and PRC = The sudden American withdrawal from Indochina left Southeast Asia vulnerable to pressure from the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China (PRC), both of which were not in the interest of Japan. The Soviet Union and China, aware of an opportunity presented in Southeast Asia following the decline of U.S. hegemony in the region, grappled for influence. China, in particular, was concerned with the ‚ÄúSoviet hegemony‚Äù in the internal communist movement and took concrete measures to prevent further Soviet influence. The 1978 Asia visit to Malaysia and Singapore by Prime Minister Deng Xiao Ping reflected PRC's attempt to win over the ASEAN governments as an ally capable of supporting PRC's interest in the region. On the other hand, the Soviet Union developed a thought-control system in which it would try to coax Southeast Asian nations into thinking of Chinese diplomacy as a form of new imperialism. The Soviet deputy foreign minister visit to ASEAN states to discuss on friendship treaties and economic aids stands as a strong proof for its determination in Southeast Asia during the 1970s. Japan, imbibing all the happenings and changes in the power balance in Southeast Asia, feared for its position, security, and economy which, until the early 1970s, had been under the United States wing. As the last resort to curb further communist influence, Japan decided to offer itself as an alternative power base of Asia. Argued by Haddad, this goal is perhaps the true ‚Äúthrust of the Fukuda doctrine.‚Äù To exercise power politics, Japan took responsibility for the strengthening of member states‚Äô economies and the inculcation in ASEAN a belief in the idea of peaceful coexistence with the three communist states of Laos, Kampuchea and Vietnam. The strengthening of ASEAN economies would raise the standard of living of the people, hence improving the image of Japan in the region. Moreover, the peaceful coexistence belief undergirded by Japan would serve as a bulwark against the penetration of Soviet Union and People's Republic of China. ASEAN was initially formed as a non-communist alliance, which meant the members shared a common feeling of threat from the Indochinese communist states. Malaysia and Thailand, in particular, bordered these states and were exercising joint military operations along their borders against communist guerrillas. This consternation worked to Japan's advantage. ASEAN needed a strong base against communist influence as the U.S. withdrew from the region, and Japan was the only power within suitable distance. As Thai Commerce Minister Suthi alluded on the relationship between Japan and Southeast Asia, ‚ÄúThailand is a country which is adjacent to communist nations‚Ä¶Japan and Thailand have the relationship of mutual dependence and assistance. The development of Thailand also serves to ensure Japan‚Äôs security.‚Äù The statement implied the close connection between Japan and Southeast Asian nations' security.  Subsequent Developments of Japan‚Äôs Policies  The Japanese policies after the promulgation of the Fukuda Doctrine in regards to Southeast Asia can be divided into three main areas: bridging the gap between ASEAN and Indochina; serving as economic model and providing economic assistance; and promoting Japanese soft power. = Political Role of Bridging the Gap in Southeast Asia = After the end of the Vietnam War, Japanese assumed a political role of bridging the gap between Indochina and ASEAN. It attempted to utilize economic assistance to foster better relationships between the three Indochinese countries Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and the other states in the region. In regards to building bridges between Southeast Asian countries with Vietnam in particular, Japan employed two tactics. First, it granted economic aid to Hanoi, hoping that it would be used to purchase commodities from other ASEAN countries. It was argued that with developing economic ties, the relations between the two sides would improve. Second, Japan attempted, to resort to discontinuation of its aid to Hanoi in order to exert pressure on the latter's behavior toward neighboring countries. In addition, Japan tried to assist the postwar reconstruction of the country, by providing grant of 55 million dollars to the Government of South Vietnam for the purchase of necessary Japanese equipment and materials. At the end of 1978, however, Japan's current policy towards Vietnam could no longer continue, as Vietnam invaded Cambodia - an act widely condemned by the international community, including US, China and most of ASEAN members. In April 1979 Japan notified, unofficially, Vietnam the freeze of all assistance and made renewal contingency upon Vietnamese withdrawal from Cambodia. In addition, following the US stance on the issue, Japan continued to see the Government of Democratic Kampuchea as the legitimate government of Cambodia and refused to recognize the Government set by Vietnam in Phnom Penh. It may be argued that it would have been more beneficial to Japan to have a softer stance to Vietnam and keep the channels of dialogue open, however it was not ready to assume such political role and part ways with the US. This showed that even after the Fukuda Doctrine, there was still a large discrepancy between Japan's economic power and its political role in the international arena. Yet, in spite of Japan's failure to play a political role of building bridges in regards to Indochina and Vietnam in particular, Japan managed to strengthen its position in the region. Following the Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea, it undertook to provide increased economic assistance, especially to Thailand to help the country cope with the new menace from Indochina, supporting the \\"front line\\" state of the conflict. = The Role of Economic Assistance = The second area of development of Japanese policies after the Fukuda Doctrine is Japan's economic strategy towards Southeast Asia. During the 1970s Japan realized the importance of furthering the interests of Japanese businesses and included this component in its foreign policy. This coincided with the assumption that Japan has achieved the third stage of the ‚Äúflying geese‚Äù pattern of development - an economic model that was influential to Japanese lawmakers at the time. That change encouraged transfers of labor- intensive industries to Southeast Asia. Southeast Asian countries were also eager to receive Japanese Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in the pursuit of their own industrialization. The transfer was further supported by Japanese Official Development Assistance (ODA), which at the time was mainly tied aid. It paved the way for Japanese businesses to work on development projects and promoted the penetration for Japanese FDI in the region. As a result of this convergence of interests, Southeast Asian countries first welcomed Japanese textile industries, then electronics and vehicle-assembly businesses, contributing to the development of new economic links. FDI's role increased even more during the 80s, after the Plaza Accord of 1985, that appreciated the yen and gave an incentive to Japanese companies to produce abroad. The main beneficiaries of those increased capital flows were Indonesia, Singapore and Thailand. By 1992 Japan had become the largest investor in the region, excluding the Philippines, where the US still remained in the first place. Aid also came from the private sector. In July 1977, the Overseas Trade Development Association Foundation of Japan (OTDAF) revised its rules, easing restrictions on loans to medium and small Japanese companies‚Äô overseas investments. The new rule allowed firms to request for loans even if it did not hold more than 50% of the investment. Following the Fukuda Doctrine, Japan undertook major changes in terms of its ODA. As the international community had started to recognize Japan as a developed country, it had to start bearing the accompanying responsibilities. After the US's withdrawal from the region, Japan had to replace America's presence with an expansion of aid and trade networks in the region. For that purpose Japan undertook to increase ODA in 1978, announcing a plan to double its ODA in three years in the First Medium- Term Target of ODA. In that spirit, Japan's ODA dramatically grew in magnitude from the late 1970s throughout the 1980s. In 1983 it became the third largest donor country among the DAC members and the second largest in 1986. Over 30% of the total Japanese ODA by 1980 was directed to Southeast Asia, with the main recipient being Indonesia, followed by Thailand, Philippines and Malaysia. In addition to this rapid expansion of the amount of ODA, Japan launched another major change. Due to the growing criticisms by industrial nations of the commercial orientation of Japanese aid and its vast foreign trade surplus, combined with US pressure to eliminate tied ODA loans, in 1978 Japan decided to start untying its aid. It issued a joint communiqu√© with the US, announcing these intentions. The move was going to make the Japanese development projects accessible to other companies, especially allowing US companies to compete for Japanese aid-funded contracts. The process of untying continued during the 1980s and 1990s with the levels of untied loans increasing from 65.2% in 1980 to 97.7 in 1995. In regards to the shaping of ‚Äúspecial‚Äù relationship with ASEAN, Japan engaged with the organization in many ways, including negotiations to establish the Common Fund, the International Tin Agreement, rubber and sugar agreements. In the 1977 Second Japan-ASEAN Forum various agreements were reached - such as providing 1 billion to ASEAN industrial projects; further study of STABEX (export stabilization) by a joint committee of Japanese and ASEAN experts; reduction of tariff and non-tariff barriers and improvement of the generalized preference system for ASEAN products within the framework of the Tokyo Round; establishment of cultural exchange programs. And although all of these agreements were implemented in the following years (except STABEX), economic cooperation between Japan and ASEAN did not progress significantly, leading to ASEAN's dissatisfaction. Even after Japan's reduction of tariffs in 1978 on a number of products, including coconut oil, palm oil, bananas, shrimps, and canned pineapples, ASEAN still demanded much larger concessions. It can be argued that in a sense, Fukuda's aspirations for \\"heart-to-heart\\" relations had unexpectedly raised ASEAN's hopes for Japan's economic offers to the region. In the following years trade negotiations became the core aspect of Japan-ASEAN economic relations. However, as economic cooperation progressed rather slowly, criticisms and negative feelings dominated Japan-ASEAN relations. = Japanese Soft Power and Promoting Japanese Image = One of the reasons for the birth of the Fukuda Doctrine was partly the concern for Japan's image in Southeast Asia. It may be argued that the rise of anti-Japanese feelings in the 1970s and the backlash toward the rapidly increasing dependence on Japan in regards to trade, investment and assistance contributed to the formulation of the doctrine. As it is described by Kazuo Ogoura: ‚ÄúSome people sarcastically labelled the country ‚ÄúFaceless Japan‚Äù or ‚ÄúBanana Japan‚Äù, the latter implying that the Japanese did not understand Asia because they were yellow on the outside (Asian in appearance) but white on the inside (Western in thinking).‚Äù These sentiments had an influence in the way Japan established its future policies. The country decided to project its soft power as a mean to broaden its relations beyond the economic field, further contributing to long-term stable ties with Southeast Asia. The Japanese strategy was adopted based on two main factors: Japan becoming the second biggest world economy and model for Asian countries; the inability of other Asian countries to utilize soft-power in the same manner. The soft power approach included various elements, such as economic influence (ODA) and socio-cultural aspects (promotion of culture, exchanges, and cooperation on different levels). As a part of that policy, the ASEAN Cultural Fund was established in 1977 to promote intra-ASEAN cultural exchanges as well as between ASEAN countries and third parties. Two years later, in 1979 the Southeast Asia Youth Invitation Program was set to encourage better mutual understanding through the invitation of outstanding young Southeast Asian leaders to Japan. A Japan Scholarship Fund for ASEAN Youth for an yearly amount of 3 million dollars was also established. Other initiatives included: the Human Resources Development Project (1981); the Japan-ASEAN Research Cooperation Fund (1982) promoting intra-ASEAN area studies and Japan-ASEAN academic exchange; the ASEAN Japan Friendship Program for the 21st Century (1983) promoting students trips and exchanges.  Problems Faced by the Doctrine  The doctrine was not without problems, at least on the Japanese side. Immediately following the agreement on setting aside 1 billion yen to fund construction projects, the Diesel plant proposal was met with opposition from Indonesia which feared competition with its domestic industry. The disagreement was eventually resolved when Indonesia and Singapore reached an export-limitation agreement in which Singapore would not export any engines to Indonesia unless requested. Nevertheless, this difference in views amongst member states increased anxiety on the Japanese side, whom demanded member states reach a mutual agreement if they want funds to be extended. The Japanese were further concerned with the capability of recipient nation's infrastructure. The members of ASEAN were much behind in technological development, causing Japanese diplomats to be worried about the feasibility of advanced technical projects in the region. Furthermore, Japan was cautious of ASEAN members‚Äô order of priority, often worrying that ASEAN members were not highly appreciative of the proposed Japanese-funded industrial projects. The STABEX (export stabilization) fund proposal also faced complications on the Japanese side. Despite continuous reassertion of a desire for a STABEX system, Japan had so far only agree on a joint-examination of the possibility of establishing such a fund. The problem with STABEX is its defiance to the previously agreed GATT and its high political sensitivity. Internationally, ASEAN is pressuring Japan to open up its import markets while the Western counterpart requests it to decrease exports. Domestically, the Liberal Democratic Party‚Äôs electoral votes were highly dependent on the business and agricultural sectors, both of which are hostile to STABEX for reasons of competition.  Significance of the Doctrine  = Developments on the Southeast Asian Relations = The unveiling of a marker commemorating the conception of the Fukuda Doctrine at the Manila Hotel in the Philippines on 1 October 2018. The Japan-Southeast Asia friend and foe relationship can be characterized by material interests and historical antagonism caused by Japan‚Äôs imperialistic past. However, Overall, there was an enhancement of the relations. A significant incident was the increase of Southeast Asia‚Äôs anxiety in the 1970s when Japan expanded its economic practices and raised exports of synthetic rubber. The Tokyo government eased the tension by accepting ASEAN demands and limiting its production of synthetic rubber, attending ASEAN Post Ministerial Meeting (PMC), and becoming a dialog partner. The enhancement of the Japan-Southeast Asia relations was not only a result of Japan‚Äôs reassurance efforts, but also a result of two significant fears brought about by the change in the strategic landscape of the region. One is the emergence of a power vacuum caused by the U.S. withdrawal from the region and the shift of the structure of rivalry from U.S. versus the Soviet Union and China to the Soviet Union versus China and U.S. The other is Japan‚Äôs rising influence in the region at the time. Japan was undergoing a rapid economic development, reviving material power and geostrategic resources such as Okinawa. In this situation, the Fukuda Doctrine reassured that despite the power vacuum, Japan would not dominate the region. Japan's consistent adherence to the Doctrine contributed to the longevity of the positive relations. Japan participated in the peacebuilding missions in Southeast Asia since the 1990s. The emphasis was put on ‚Äúhuman security‚Äù during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, during which Japan supported social stability through economic assistance. Furthermore, Japan has also been supporting ASEAN‚Äôs community-building efforts since the early 2000s, in an attempt to strengthen its political-security and to form economic and socio-cultural communities. The Fukuda Doctrine, as Kei Koga, a researcher of the Center for Strategic and International Studies writes in his report, Transcending the Fukuda Doctrine, ‚Äúhas been instrumental in defining Japan‚Äôs approach toward ASEAN‚Äôs efforts to integrate politically.‚Äù Koga further argues that the current Japan-Southeast Asian relations have developed beyond socio-cultural, economic, to include political and security dimensions, and at a point where they can help shape and direct the region. Further progress is essential, considering the rise of China and the uncertainty over US-Southeast Asia policy under President Donald Trump. = International and Domestic Reactions =  International Reactions  The reactions of ASEAN countries shifted from being cautious but optimistic in August, to openly hostile at the end of 1977. If the promises could be fulfilled, the Doctrine was welcomed. In fact, The ASEAN members, regretting America's withdrawal, initially encouraged Japan to play a bigger role as long as Japan doesn't become a military threat. Nonetheless, the feeling of suspicion that Japan would not fulfill the promise of the doctrine was prevalent among these countries due to Japan's past of not delivering its promises. Additionally, the fact that Japanese visible trade surplus for July was as much as US$2.05 billion added to the extant feeling of suspicion. The reaction gradually turned inimical, which could be perceived to be Japanese ‚Äòfoot dragging‚Äô. There was caution, for example on Japanese credibility, with no aid to ASEAN being made. China's reaction, on the other hand, was more complex. It supported Japan's effort for a larger influence, in that Japan was strengthening its defensive power in the region. This was due to China's intention to minimize the influence of the Soviet Union, which was identified as China's primary enemy. However, simultaneously, it was not delighted to see a U.S. ally exercising influence on Southeast Asia. The United States's response was positive. Present American policy in Southeast Asia take root in July 1973 with the announcement of the Nixon Doctrine. As a consequence of this doctrine, America pulled its land forces out of Asia. Following the Nixon doctrine, America espoused another major set of beliefs. The Ford Doctrine, announced in 1975, called for the normalization of relations with China. These elements, along with the collapse of the three Indochinese countries to communism, shaped American policy towards ASEAN countries, with the key determination being the protection of the non-communist countries while maintaining good relations with China and withdrawing from the region. Thus, America, as well as China, was supportive of Japan's new advance in the region. The reaction of Vietnam, the most powerful Indochinese communist state, changed before and a while after the Fukuda visit. Its attitude went from being hostile to a more benign one. At first, Vietnam viewed Japan as a supporter of capitalist interest due to Japan-U.S. alliance and ASEAN as a hostile military alliance. However, the growing hostility resulting from a war with Kampuchea in 1978, and the need for outside funding for its ambitious five-year economic development plan left Vietnam little choice but to seek for financial support from Japan. Despite Japanese conditionality, the full repayment of outstanding debts of South Vietnam's, Fukuda made an extraordinary statement that moved the stalled negotiations forward, which received a positive reaction from Vietnam. Overall, the Doctrine was perceived as a promise of a strengthening of political and economic bonds, however, over time, the reversal of the trend could be depicted. This reversal was due to the fear that Japan would be less focused on ASEAN. Japan's external and internal policies in the last quarter of 1978, was affected by the development of Sino-Japanese relations, the change of leadership from pro-ASEAN leader Fukuda to pro-China leader Ohira, the competition for the ‚ÄúChina market‚Äù among OECD countries, the uncertainty in the Southeast Asia region with the influx of refugees into ASEAN from the conflicts in Indochina.  Domestic Reactions  Domestic views of the government's new policy towards ASEAN were diverse. Views of press, the bureaucracy, the business community and opposition (political) parties were different, but essential. The press, in spite of being criticized for sympathizing with the Liberal Democratic Party, exercised great influence over national consensus on Japan's new role in Southeast Asia. Journal articles published during and after the visit predominantly argued in favor of the Fukuda doctrine. If any criticism were visible, it would only be in the area concerning the articulation of the doctrine. The press demanded that the doctrine does better to change Japan's narrow attitude towards foreign nations and improving its cultural ties with other countries, particularly Southeast Asia, as well as refining the educational system to one that puts greater emphasis on foreign languages. Likewise, the bureaucracy regarded the visit as an invariable success, and that it proved the Prime Minister's ability to convince his hosts ‚Äúto open a new page in Asia‚Äôs history.‚Äù Despite the Ministry of Finance resistance to cultural fund, the bureaucracy nevertheless wholly agreed to endorse the doctrine. The reaction of the business community, in contrast, was to some degree intricate. Amongst positive reactions to the Overseas Trade Development Association Foundation of Japan's revision, there was a growing fear that the unbridled assistance to Southeast Asian industrialization may ineluctably drive Japanese manufacturers out of the ASEAN market. Regardless, those supporting of the doctrine argued against such thought by interpreting industrialization as the increase in standard of living which could subsequently engender higher income and more demand for Japanese products. Opposition parties, on the other hand, found themselves with no saying in the materialization of the doctrine. The Social Democratic Party (JSP) and Japanese Communist Party (JCP) meekly argued that the doctrine was merely a reassertion of Japan's subservience to the United States in another form. In particular, the JCP disproved aid to puppet governments, deploring that it was no different from America's aid to ineptitude government of Saigon, Phnom Penh and Vientiane. The two parties, however, never really found support for their statements. The reaction of the people in Japan, by the end of 1997, was comparably hostile, and Fukuda's popularity was declining. This was due to the well-known fact of American displeasure with the Japanese economy, and the feeling of unrest in Japan as the unemployment rate was not improving. = Relevance of the Doctrine Today =  Significance to Trust  The Fukuda Doctrine has received considerable attention over the years in Japan and Southeast Asia. The articulation and the implementation of the Doctrine improved Japan's image. The Doctrine itself became ‚Äúa symbol of amity and cooperation between Japan and Southeast Asia.‚Äù According to the opinion polls in seven ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) in 2014, the majority of the public believed that their state-to-state relationship with Japan was friendly and dependable.  Significance to Policy Making  The Doctrine continues to be significant for Japan's policy towards Southeast Asia relations in the post- Cold War era. The doctrine served as ‚Äúthe blueprint of Japan‚Äôs foreign policy towards Southeast Asia\\", and established new norms with its three principles. The Fukuda Doctrine survived the Cold War, unlike the Brezhnev Doctrine, or the Nixon Doctrine that disappeared under it. Rather, it strengthened the discourse about the Japan-Southeast Asian relations into the 21st century. Thus, there is an expectation that it‚Äôll evolve and remain relevant.  References to the Doctrine  References to the Doctrine are still being made. The son of Fukuda Takeo, Fukuda Yasuo, made a reference to it when he became Prime Minister in 2007. Although he did not update the Doctrine as anticipated, he declared that ASEAN and Japan would be ‚Äùpartners thinking together, acting together and sharing a future vision.‚Äù This was later highlighted in ASEAN Chairman's Statement on the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conferences (PMC) + 1 Sessions in Singapore in 2008. It read; ‚ÄúThe Meeting welcomed the ‚ÄúNew Fukuda Doctrine,‚Äù in which Prime Minister of Japan Yasuo Fukuda declared that ASEAN and Japan would be partners thinking together, acting together and sharing a future vision.‚Äù Other than diplomats, journalists and scholars also made reference to the Doctrine in major conferences held in Japan and Southeast Asia in 2007, to mark the 30th anniversary for the doctrine.  Relevance to Africa  According to Tadokoro Masayuki‚Äôs argument in 2010, the principles of the Doctrine are relevant not only for Southeast Asia, but also for Africa today. He argues that ‚Äúgiven the amicable relations that have developed between Japanese and the people in ASEAN countries since then, we should not be too cynical about the roles played by such political initiatives,‚Äù and that ‚ÄúFor Japan, Africa represents neither an object of pity nor a security threat nor a mere supplier of natural resources nor a giant zoo, but rather a partner with whom Japanese should be willing to work together.‚Äù = Deficiency of the Fukuda Doctrine = However, the principles of the Doctrine are considered not enough to articulate the current relationship and to enhance it. In the post-Cold War era, ASEAN has expanded its functions to include strengthening the security for regional peace and stability. ASEAN's importance has increased due to the strategic uncertainty by the power shift to China. Japan has advanced ‚Äúde facto regional integration‚Äù with ASEAN through aid, trade, investment and cultural exchanges. ASEAN, as a result, has gained the dominant position in the region. Japan-Southeast Asia relations are now at a point where they can help shape and direct the region. Japan and ASEAN are both pursuing goals to better the issues of human rights, the rule of law, and other democratic principles. Kei Koga argues that there is an opportunity to enhance their political cooperation that transcends the Fukuda Doctrine, in pursuing these shared goals.

Early life Edward Boyce was born in County Donegal, Ireland in 1862 and was the youngest of four children. His father died at an early age.Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 38 Boyce was educated in local schools. He emigrated to Boston, Massachusetts at age 19. Boyce took his first job as a construction worker for the Milwaukee Northern Railroad, an interurban line between Milwaukee and Sheboygan, earning $1.25 a day at the job.\\"Edward Boyce,\\" The Western Miner [Leadville, CO], vol. 1, no. 30 (May 8, 1897), pg. 1. He managed to save $100 by 1883 and then moved west to Leadville, Colorado, where he arrived in 1883. Boyce sent the next four years working in the mines. He joined the Leadville Miners' Union, an affiliate of the Knights of Labor in 1884. Boyce left Leadville for Idaho, where he worked at various mines in Coeur d'Alene and also in Butte, Montana before moving to Wardner, Idaho. He joined the Wardner Miners' Union in 1888, and was later elected its corresponding secretary. Coeur d'Alene strike In 1892, the 30-year-old Boyce became an active leader in a strike near Coeur d'Alene, Idaho. In January 1892, railroad companies serving the area increased the shipping rate of ore. The mine owners decided to close the mines for four months until a compromise with the railroads could be reached. This action threw 1,600 miners out of work. The mines reopened two months early, but wages had been slashed by 15 percent. The miners struck. The owners offered to restore wages to their previous levels but refused to recognize the union, an offer Boyce and the other union leaders rejected. When three scab workers were forced to join the union by a mob of miners (a fourth fled the county), the Coeur d'Alene Mine Owners' Association obtained an injunction from the United States district court at Boise, Idaho, preventing anyone from interfering with the working of the mines. The mine owners began importing scabs at the rate of 16 workers a day from outside the region. Company militia provided protection. (Idaho's state constitution contained a prohibition against the creation or use of private militia, but the law was not enforced.) Random incidents of violence heightened the tension: A guard exchanged words with a miner and was whipped. Two drunk guards picked a fight with a group of miners in a local bar. Three guards armed with rifles threatened a miners' camp. Late in the evening of Sunday, July 10, the miners discovered that their union secretary, Charles Siringo, was a mine owner spy hired from the Pinkerton Agency. During that evening and into the early morning hours of July 11, armed miners surrounded the shuttered Frisco mill of the Gem mine. A firefight broke out. During the gun battle, miners dropped a barrel of gunpowder down the flume of the mill; the powderkeg exploded, destroying the mill and killing a non-union miner. The mine owners demanded that Governor N. B. Willey, a former mine manager, proclaim martial law. Although violence in the region had ended, Willey called out the National Guard. President Benjamin Harrison ordered federal troops to back up the Idaho state troops. Martial law lasted four months. Nearly 600 miners were arrested and confined in a large outdoor prison, or bullpen. But since most of the local inhabitants were miners or sympathized with them, the state had little chance of obtaining convictions. Several union leaders, however, were arrested for violating the district court's injunction‚ÄîEd Boyce among them. Boyce and the other union officials were confined in the Ada County Jail. Formation of the WFM The Coeur d'Alene miners had received financial assistance from miners' unions in Butte, who had paid legal fees for their attorney, James H. Hawley. While the union leaders were still in jail, Hawley suggested that mine unions in the West needed to form a united front, and the union leaders agreed. The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was formed in 1893 in Butte. Boyce served a six-month jail term for contempt of court for his role in the 1892 Coeur d'Alene miners' strike, and was blacklisted by the mine owners. After his release in 1893, Boyce prospected for a time in Montana's Bitterroot Mountains before returning to Coeur d'Alene. He obtained work in the mines and was elected president of the Coeur d'Alene Executive Miners' Union, a post he held until 1895. Although not present for its founding, Boyce attended the WFM's second convention in 1894 and was elected to its executive board. With its headquarters in Coeur d'Alene, nearly all the mines in the Idaho panhandle except for the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mine recognized the union. Still, the WFM barely survived the next three years. Public service In 1894, Boyce was elected to the Idaho state senate as a Populist from Shoshone County, Idaho. Boyce battled for the eight-hour day for miners, the establishment of an arbitration board to settle labor disputes, and an investigation of the 1892 mining war. He objected to appropriations for the state militia, charging that it was a tool used by the state and mine owners to suppress labor. He called for legislation to forbid employment of aliens, to outlaw yellow-dog contracts and prohibit company stores. In one of the most dramatic speeches he ever made, Boyce denounced the blacklist: > Senate bill fifty six provides for no class, no special legislation, but > under its provisions those relentless persecutors, known as corporations, > are prevented when they discharge an employee from following him with a > blacklist and depriving him of the means of earning an honest living in > another part of the state‚Ä¶.Why do you not produce some argument against it > to show that it should not become a law? No, it is not necessary: you of the > Republican party have the votes to kill the bill and that is all you desire. > But remember these words: the laboring men of Idaho have asked you for bread > and you give them a stone: we ask you for justice and you treat us with > scorn, but the day is fast approaching when your action will be condemned by > every man who has one drop of manly blood in his veins.cited in William J. > Gaboury. \\"From Statehouse to Bull Pen\\", Pacific Northwest Quarterly (January > 1967) The Populists were unable to pass the legislation they desired, and Boyce‚Äîdisillusioned with the political process‚Äîquit after one term. WFM presidency While serving in the Idaho legislature, Boyce resigned as president of the Coeur d'Alene Executive Miner's Union in 1895, and took a job as a general organizer for the WFM. In 1896, Boyce was elected president of the Western Federation of Miners. He served until 1902. James Maher was elected WFM secretary-treasurer the same year. Boyce and Maher worked well together. They pumped life into the faltering federation, and the WFM began a period of rapid growth. William \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood heard Boyce make a speech in that first year as president of the WFM, and Haywood decided to become a union member. Haywood later became WFM secretary-treasurer, and a major figure in the American labor movement. In late 1899, Boyce established the WFM's journal, the Miner's Magazine. The first issue came out in early 1900. =Leadville, Colorado miners' strike= The Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the WFM went on strike in 1896 over a reduction in wages that had persisted since the depression of 1893.Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 211. The Coronado Mine was re-opened with armed replacement workers during the strike, and an incident on September 21 resulted in shooting and dynamite explosions.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pp 1-4, 118. After surface buildings were burned, the Colorado governor sent the Colorado National Guard to Leadville. Boyce was one of twenty-seven union men who were jailed, but all of the union's leaders were released for lack of evidence.Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pp. 211-15. =Radical positions= At the 1897 WFM convention in Salt Lake City, Utah, Boyce told his fellow union members to arm themselves: > I deem it important to direct your attention to Article 2 of the > Constitutional Amendments of the United States‚Äî'the right of the people to > keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.' This you should comply with > immediately. Every (local) union should have a rifle club. I strongly advise > you to provide every member with the latest improved rifle, which can be > obtained from the factory at a nominal price. I entreat you to take action > on this important question, so that in two years we can hear the inspiring > music of the martial tread of 25,000 armed men in the ranks of labor.cited > in Vernon H. Jensen, Heritage of Conflict, 1950 =AFL and WLU= Boyce led the WFM to join the American Federation of Labor the year he became WFM president. The affiliation lasted only until the spring of 1898. Samuel Gompers had refused to give striking Colorado miners strike benefits, and Boyce heatedly debated the issue with Gompers. But, convinced that the conservative and craft unionism policies of the AFL were inadequate to the task of organizing workers, Boyce led the WFM out of the AFL. In 1898, Boyce, a strong believer in industrial unionism, led the WFM to found the Western Labor Union. The Western Labor Union (later the American Labor Union) was established in direct opposition to the craft-oriented AFL, and included workers from all industries. =Bunker Hill mine bombing= In April 1899, WFM officials demanded that the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mine recognize the union. The mine owners' response was to fire all union members. Militant union members then blew up the Bunker Hill and Sullivan ore concentrator in the town of Wardner, at the time the largest ore concentrator in the world. Governor Frank Steunenberg declared martial law and President William McKinley ordered U.S. troops from Montana into the area. The miners were rounded up and once again herded into a bullpen. Some of the miners were released after denying that they belonged to any subversive organization. Boyce was charged with conspiring to blow up the concentrator. Boyce had been in Wardner conferring with local union officers only a week before the explosion. In 1906, former union member and Boyce business associate Harry Orchard told a court that he knew Boyce had planned and approved the bombing of the Bunker Hill and Sullivan Mine. Governor Steunenberg told a United States House of Representatives Committee on Military Affairs that he was convinced Boyce had \\"inaugurated or perfected this conspiracy by, choosing 20 men from different organizations in that county and swearing them. These 20 men chose one each and swore him, and the 40 each chose a man and swore him, and the 80 each chose a man and swore him. In that way there were at least 160 men in this conspiracy to do this thing, sworn to secrecy.\\"cited in Idaho State Historical Society, Coeur d'Alene Mining Wars. Reference Series No. 210. Boyce denied the charges, and no indictment was ever issued. But the influence of the Western Federation of Miners in Idaho had nearly been destroyed, and its leaders dispersed. New headquarters were established in Denver, Colorado, where Idaho officials could not so easily extradite and try WFM officials. Beginning in 1900, Boyce also edited the WFM journal, Miners Magazine. He left the position when he retired as union president in 1902. =Adopting socialism= In 1901, Boyce successfully led a campaign to have the WFM adopt socialism as its official economic policy. An ardent socialist, Boyce famously declared: > There can be no harmony between organized capitalists and organized labor. > Our present wage system is slavery in its worst form. ‚Ä¶ Advise strikes as > the weapon to be used by labor to obtain its rights, and you will be branded > as criminals who aim to ruin the business interests of the country. Change > from the policy of simple trades unionism that is fast waning, and you will > be told that your action is premature, as this is not the time. Pursue the > methods adopted by capitalists and you will be sent to prison for robbery or > executed for murder. Demand, and your demands will be construed into threats > of violence against the rights of private property calculated to scare > capital. Avail yourself of your constitutional rights and propose to take > political action, and you will be charged with selling out the organization > to some political party. Counsel arbitration, and you will be told that > there is nothing to arbitrate. Be conservative, and your tameness will be > construed as an appreciation of the conditions thrust upon you by trusts and > syndicates. Take what action you will in the interests of labor, the trained > beagles in the employ of capital from behind their loathsome fortress of > disguised patriotism will howl their tirade of condemnation.cited in George > Suggs Jr., Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, 1972 Boyce became an associate of Eugene V. Debs, and endorsed the Socialist Party platform. Boyce also urged the WFM to slowly buy up mines and mining company stock, to replace the wage system with union-owned mines. Marriage and retirement On May 14, 1901 in Butte, Montana, Boyce married Eleanor Day, the sister of Harry L. Day, a former bookkeeper who had become a wealthy mine owner. Day and Fred Harper, a local prospector, had discovered the Hercules mine, one of the richest silver and lead mines in the Coeur d'Alene region. The newlyweds honeymooned at the Boyce family home in Ireland. Boyce declined renomination as WFM president in 1902. He had become disillusioned with mismanagement in some WFM locals. But strong opposition to his continuing presidency had emerged in the powerful Butte Miners' Union, Local 1 of the WFM. In his farewell address, Boyce still remained the firebrand: \\"There are only two classes of people in the world. One is composed of the men and women who produce all; the other is composed of men and women who produce nothing, but live in luxury upon the wealth produced by others.\\"cited in J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1998 Socialism, he still argued, was the only way \\"to abolish the wage system which is more destructive of human rights and liberty than any other slave system devised.\\"cited in Dubofsky and McCartin, We Shall Be All, 1988 Later life After his retirement from the WFM, Ed Boyce attended several more WFM conventions. He supported the WFM's creation of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, and testified on behalf of Haywood, Moyer and others at their 1907 murder trial. But Boyce gradually separated himself from organized labor, and eventually declined to discuss his part in the miners' union. The Boyces moved to Wallace, Idaho and then in 1909 to Portland, Oregon. Boyce became an avid reader of social theory and Irish poetry. The Boyces lived quietly, often passing the whole day sitting in the same room reading. Eleanor Boyce took an interest in art and became a member of the Portland Art Association. The Boyces donated freely to a number of local charities. Boyce invested in the luxurious Portland Hotel Company in 1911, as well as in other real estate ventures in the city. He was the Portland Hotel's vice-president from 1920-29 and its president from 1930 until his death in 1941. In 1936, Boyce was elected president of the Oregon Hotel Association. On December 31, 1923, the Hercules mine partnership was dissolved and the Hercules Mining Company (now Day Mines, Inc.) incorporated in Delaware. Eleanor Day Boyce was the largest stockholder. Death and legacy Boyce died on December 24, 1941. He left an estate valued at slightly over $1 million. Eugene V. Debs wrote a month later that Boyce had been \\"virtually forgotten by the officials of the organization he served at a time when it required real men to speak out for labor.\\" Eleanor Day Boyce returned to Wallace after her husband's death, where she died on January 9, 1951.

It is the first in the series of twelve novels featuring the fictional American boy Lewis Barnavelt (see list of Lewis Barnavelt novels). Plot Lewis Barnavelt, recently an orphan, moves to the town of New Zebedee, Michigan, to live with his mysterious uncle Jonathan Barnavelt. Lewis' uncle turns out to be a mediocre, though well-intentioned, warlock. His next-door neighbor and good friend, Florence Zimmermann, is a far more powerful good witch. Jonathan's house was previously owned by Isaac and Selenna Izard, a sinister couple who had dedicated their lives to black magic, and plotted to bring about the end of the world. Before dying, Isaac constructed the eponymous clock that he hid somewhere inside the walls of the house, where it eternally ticks as it attempts to pull the world into the magical alignment, which would permit him to destroy it. Lewis befriends a local boy named Tarby Corrigan, who is everything he is not -- popular, athletic, thin -- but the two soon begin to drift apart. Lewis tries to win Tarby back by demonstrating how to raise the dead in the local cemetery on Halloween but in doing so unwittingly releases Selena Izard from her tomb. An escalating series of encounters with the sorceress' ghost builds to a final confrontation in the basement of Jonathan's house, where Lewis must summon up his courage and prevent the couple from finishing their work and bringing about the end time. Cronin House Cronin House in Marshall, Michigan that inspired the book's setting The Cronin House in John Bellairs's hometown of Marshall, Michigan was the inspiration for his book. The house received a historical plaque in 1992. With the film adaptation debuting in 2018, Marshall's population embraced the fame with walking tours and other activities related to the book and its film. Reception The House with a Clock in Its Walls received a New York Times outstanding book citation and a Michigan Young Readers award nomination. Anita Silvey wrote in Children's Books and Their Creators that Bellairs \\"established himself as one of the most compelling mystery writers for children\\" with The House with a Clock in Its Walls. Kirkus Reviews wrote that Gorey's drawings of the house were \\"creepy-cozy\\", and that \\"Bellairs doesn't bother to supply either motivation or blueprints for the [...] scheme, but if the cavalier and capricious handling of the occult by characters and author alike precludes any bone-deep shudders, the house lives up to its promise of a few gratifying Halloween shivers.\\" The New York Times wrote, \\"It's the aura of this story‚Äîits blend of the everyday and the supernatural‚Äîthat makes it glow among a plethora of lacklustre occult books this spring\\" of 1973. It continued, \\"What the author has done that's so special is to touch both the intellect and the feelings. He has dusted off the paraphernalia of ancient magic and made us newly aware of the difference between good and evil. His dialogue goes snap, crackle and pop. He sets chilling scenes with suspense that tightens like a screw.\\" Adaptations *The book was used as the basis for one of the three segments in the 1979 television anthology Once Upon a Midnight Scary, hosted by Vincent Price. *The book was adapted into the 2018 film of the same name.

Although a threatened species in its natural habitat, it has long been cultivated in China. By weight more silver carp are produced worldwide in aquaculture than any other species of fish except for the grass carp. Silver carp are usually farmed in polyculture with other Asian carp, or sometimes with catla or other fish species. The species has also been introduced, or spread by connected waterways, to at least 88 countries around the world. The reason for importation was generally for use in aquaculture, but enhancement of wild fisheries and water quality control have also been intended on occasion. In some of these places, the species is considered an invasive species. The silver carp reaches an average length of with a maximum length of and weight of . Diet The silver carp is a filter feeder and possesses a specialized feeding apparatus capable of filtering particles as small as 4 ¬µm. The gill rakers are fused into a sponge-like filter, and an epibranchial organ secretes mucus which assists in trapping small particles. A strong buccal pump forces water through this filter. Silver carp, like all Hypophthalmichthys species, have no stomachs; they are thought to feed more or less constantly, largely on phytoplankton. They also consume zooplankton and detritus. In places where this plankton-feeding species has been introduced, they are thought to compete with native planktivorous fishes, which in North America include paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), gizzard shad (Dorosoma cepedianum), and young fish of almost all species. Because they feed on plankton, they are sometimes successfully used for controlling water quality, especially in the control of noxious blue-green algae (cyanobacteria). Certain species of blue- green algae, notably the often toxic Microcystis, can pass through the gut of silver carp unharmed, picking up nutrients in the process. Thus, in some cases, blue-green algae blooms have been exacerbated by silver carp. Microcystis has also been shown to produce more toxins in the presence of silver carp. These carp, which have natural defenses to their toxins, sometimes can contain enough algal toxins in their systems to become hazardous to eat. Ecology and conservation The silver carp in its natural range migrates upstream for spawning; eggs and larvae then drift downstream, and young fish hatch in the floodplain zone. Larvae and small juveniles feed on zooplankton, switching to phytoplankton once a certain size is reached. The species is somewhat sensitive to low oxygen conditions. The species is currently classified as near threatened in it original range, as its habitat and reproductive behavior are impacted by construction of dams, pollution, and overfishing. Population declines appear to have been particularly significant in the Chinese parts of its range. Sport fishing Silver carp are filter feeders, thus are difficult to catch on typical hook-and-line gear. Special methods have been developed for these fish, the most important being the \\"suspension method\\", usually consisting of a large dough ball that disintegrates slowly, surrounded by a nest of tiny hooks embedded in the bait. The entire apparatus is suspended below a large bobber. The fish feed on the small particles released from the dough ball and bump against the dough ball, with the intention of breaking off more small particles that can be filtered from the water, eventually becoming hooked on the tiny hooks. In some areas, it is also legal to use \\"snagging gear\\", in which large, weighted treble hooks are jerked through the water, to snag the fish. In the United States, silver carp are also popular targets for bowfishermen; they are shot both in the water and in the air. In the latter case, boats are used to scare the fish and entice them to jump, and the fish are shot when they jump. Related species Two other species are in the genus Hypophthalmichthys, the bighead carp (H. nobilis) and the largescale silver carp (H. harmandi). The genus name Aristichthys has also sometimes been used for bighead carp, but is deprecated.ACBSRA Final Report 2005 The bighead carp differs from the silver carp in its behavior (it does not leap from the water when startled) and also in its diet. Bighead carp are also filter feeders, but they filter larger particles than silver carp and in general consume a greater proportion of zooplankton in their diets than silver carp, which consume more phytoplankton. In at least some parts of the United States, bighead and silver carp hybridize in the wild and produce fertile offspring. The largescale silver carp is closely related to the silver carp, but its native range is to the south of that of the silver carp, mostly within Vietnam. Unlike bighead and silver carp, largescale silver carp have not been widely introduced around the world for use in aquaculture, although at least one introduction was made to some waters of the Soviet Union, where they hybridized with the introduced silver carp. In North America Silver carp were imported to North America in the 1970s to control algae growth in aquaculture and municipal wastewater treatment facilities, but escaped from captivity soon after their importation and are now considered a highly invasive species. Silver carp, with the closely related bighead carp, often reach extremely high population densities, and are known to have undesirable effects on the environment and native species including the Bigmouth Buffalo. They have spread into the Mississippi, Illinois, Ohio, Tennessee, and Missouri Rivers and many of their tributaries in the United States and are abundant in the Mississippi River watershed from Louisiana to South Dakota and Illinois. Navigation dams seem to have slowed their advance up the Mississippi River, and until late November 2008, silver carp had not been captured north of central Iowa on the Mississippi. Dams that do not have navigation locks are complete barriers to upstream natural movement of silver carp, unless fishermen unintentionally assist this movement by the use of silver carp as bait. In 2020, Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (ADCNR) found silver carp in Alabama‚Äôs Pickwick and Wheeler reservoirs on the Tennessee River, but the species has not expanded its range in Alabama‚Äôs waterways. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) has considered several methods to control the spread of Asian carp, including fish barriers at 10 locks controlled by the TVA. One is a Bioacoustics Fish Fence (BAFF), which utilizes a combination of sound, light and air bubbles. These barriers are installed at Barkley Lock and Dam in Kentucky and are currently being studied for their effectiveness in deterring Asian carp. Other types of barriers used for Asian carp include the use of carbon dioxide or electricity. TVA has conducted environmental impact studies in order to minimize the impact of the barriers on native species. TVA has also considered adjusting flow rates during Asian carp spawning periods, which are usually during high-water events, as Asian carp eggs are only semi-buoyant and will sink to the bottom and die with low river flow. Silver carp jumping out of the Illinois River The silver carp is sometimes called the flying carp for its tendency to leap from the water when startled; it can leap up to into the air. Boaters traveling in uncovered high-speed watercraft have been reported to be injured by running into the fish while at speed. A leaping silver carp broke the jaw of a teenager being pulled on an inner tube, and water skiing in areas where silver carp are present is extremely dangerous. Peculiarly, the extreme jumping behavior appears to be unique to silver carp of North America; those in their native Asian range and introduced to other parts of the world are much less prone to jumping. Although theories have been proposed (for example, the high densities the species reaches in parts of North America, or that the introduced North American population may have been based on a small number of particularly \\"jumpy\\" individuals), the reason for these geographic differences is not known for certain.

The general discussion of how to perform music from ancient or earlier times did not become an important subject of interest until the 19th century, when Europeans began looking to ancient culture generally, and musicians began to discover the musical riches from earlier centuries. The idea of performing early music more \\"authentically\\", with a sense of incorporating performance practice, was more completely established in the 20th century, creating a modern early music revival that continues today. Study and performance of ancient music before the 19th century In England, Johann Pepusch developed an \\"Academy of Ancient Music\\" in the 1720s to study music by Palestrina, Tom√°s Luis de Victoria, William Byrd, Thomas Morley, and other composers at least a century old. In Vienna, Baron Gottfried van Swieten presented house concerts of ancient music in the late 1700s, where Mozart developed his love of music by Bach and Handel. At the end of the 18th century, Samuel Wesley was promoting the music of Bach. 19th century In 1808, Samuel Wesley began performing Bach's organ music in a series of London concerts. Felix Mendelssohn is often credited as an important figure in reviving music from the past. He conducted a famous performance of Bach's St Matthew Passion on 11 March 1829. The concert is cited as one of the most significant events in the early music revival, although the performance used contemporary instruments and the work was condensed, leaving out a significant amount of Bach's music. Early 20th century In the early 20th century, musical historians in the emerging field of musicology began to look at Medieval and Renaissance music more carefully, preparing performing editions of many works. Aside from choirs at the cathedral churches in England which were reviving these pieces, establishing a new standard and tradition in performing Renaissance choral music, several independent instrumental ensembles also emerged in the 1960s. They included Musica Reservata and David Munrow's Early Music Consort. Research into early music was carried out by members of the Galpin Society and independent scholars such as Mary Remnant and Christopher Hogwood. Other important milestones in the early music revival included the 1933 founding of the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis in Basel, Switzerland by Paul Sacher‚Äîtogether with distinguished musicians including the pioneering specialist in early vocal music Max Meili, who contributed to the extensive L'Anthologie Sonore series of early music recordings and recorded Renaissance lute songs for HMV‚Äîand the 1937 presentation and recording of some of Monteverdi‚Äôs Madrigals by Nadia Boulanger in France. Arnold Dolmetsch is widely considered the key figure in the early music revival in the early 20th century. Dolmetsch's 1915 book The Interpretation of the Music of the XVIIth and XVIIIth Centuries was a milestone in the development of authentic performances of early music.

The show consisted mainly of sketches that were full of slapstick, mime, parody, and double entendre. At its peak The Benny Hill Show was among the most-watched programmes in the UK with the audience reaching more than 21 million viewers in 1971. In the late 1970s, the show found popularity in the United States and would run in syndication until 1990. Thames Television cancelled production of the show in 1989 due to declining ratings and large production costs at ¬£450,000 () per show. In a 2015 UK poll the show's theme song was voted number 1 on the ITV special The Sound of ITV ‚Äì The Nation's Favourite Theme Tune. Show format The Benny Hill Show features Benny Hill in various short comedy sketches and occasional, extravagant musical performances by artists of the time. Hill appears in many different costumes and portrays a vast array of characters. Slapstick, burlesque, and double entendres are his hallmarks. A group of critics accused the show of sexism, and Hill responded by claiming that female characters kept their dignity while the men who chase them were portrayed as buffoons. The show often uses undercranking and sight gags to create what Hill called \\"live animation\\", and he employs comedic techniques such as mime and parody. The show typically closes with a sped-up chase scene involving Hill and often a crew of scantily clad women (usually with Hill being the one chased, due to silly predicaments that he himself caused), a send-up on the stereotypical Keystone Cops chase scenes. Hill also composed and sang patter songs and often entertained his audience with lengthy high-speed double-entendre rhymes and songs, which he recited or sang in a single take. Hill also used the television camera to create comedic illusions. For example, in a murder mystery farce entitled \\"Murder on the Oregon Express\\" from 1976 (a parody of Murder on the Orient Express), Hill used editing, camera angles and impersonations to depict a Quinn Martin‚Äìlike TV \\"mystery\\" featuring Hill in the roles of 1970s American television detectives Ironside, McCloud, Kojak and Cannon, plus Hercule Poirot. During his television career, Hill performed impersonations or parodies of such American celebrities as W. C. Fields, Orson Welles (renamed \\"Orson Buggy\\"), Kenny Rogers, Marlon Brando, Raymond Burr, and fictional characters that range from The Six Million Dollar Man and Starsky and Hutch to The A-Team (parodied as \\"The B-Team\\", in which he played the roles of both 'Hannibal' and 'B.A.') and Cagney & Lacey. He also impersonated such international celebrities as Nana Mouskouri and Miriam Makeba as well as British stars such as Shirley Bassey, Michael Caine (in his Alfie role), newscasters Reginald Bosanquet, Alan Whicker and Cliff Michelmore, pop-music show hosts Jimmy Savile and Tony Blackburn, musician Roger Whittaker, his former 1960s record producer Tony Hatch, political figures Lord Boothby and Denis Healey and Irish comedian Dave Allen. On a few occasions, Hill even impersonated his former straight man, Nicholas Parsons. A spoof of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? saw him playing both Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor. Production notes The show's closing theme tune, \\"Yakety Sax\\", which has gained a following in its own right, was written by James Q. \\"Spider\\" Rich and Boots Randolph. As the closing credits rolled, the theme was usually accompanied by a sped-up chase-sequence, often featuring scantily clad young women. The show's musical director was pianist and easy listening conductor Ronnie Aldrich, and vocal backing was provided by session singers the Ladybirds (who also frequently appeared on camera from 1969 to 1974). The saxophone soloist on Aldrich's version of \\"Yakety Sax\\" was Peter Hughes. For three episodes of the 1973‚Äì1974 season, Albert Elms filled in for Aldrich as musical director. \\"Yakety Sax\\" first appeared in the 19 November 1969 episode, which was also the first show for Thames. Another signature of the show was the enthusiastic announcer intro: \\"Yes! It's The Benny Hill Show!\\" (The announcer was often cast member Henry McGee.) From 1975 forward, Hill was also introduced at the start of each show as \\"The Lad Himself\\". The show closed with Hill's salute: \\"Thank you for being with us, and we look forward to seeing you all again‚Äîvery, very soon. Until then, bye bye.\\". Cast The main supporting cast includes Henry McGee, Jon Jon Keefe, Nicholas Parsons, Bob Todd and Jackie Wright. The regular sexpot-type females include Jenny Lee- Wright, Sue Bond, Bettina Le Beau, Lesley Goldie, Cherri Gilham and Diana Darvey. In later years, the show included a dance troupe, the Hill's Angels, which was briefly preceded by the Love Machine. Regular Angels were Sue Upton and Louise English, whilst Jane Leeves also appeared as a Hill's Angel in a few episodes in the early 1980s; among those who appeared only once were Susan Clark and Sue McIntosh. The female singing group The Ladybirds, featuring the bespectacled Maggie Stredder, were regulars on the show as background singers to Hill, and occasionally singing numbers on their own. Character actresses include Anna Dawson, Bella Emberg, Rita Webb and Patricia Hayes. =Guest stars= * Don Estelle * Paul Eddington * Paula Wilcox * Patrick Newell * Hugh Paddick * Kathy Staff * Trisha Noble * Dilys Watling * Stella Moray * Percy Thrower * Liz Fraser * Carl Wayne Occasionally, Hill would briefly chat with his guests on stage. In the 1980s, as the climate of political correctness continued to grow, Eddington and Wilcox refused to allow the episodes in which they appeared to be shown on British television again. =Musical guest stars= * Petula Clark * Alma Cogan * Kiki Dee * Judith Durham * Cleo Laine * The Mike Sammes Singers * Anne Shelton * The Springfields * Design * Sylvia McNeill Hill also gave the first major exposure to some non-UK-based musical groups, including Luis Alberto del Paran√° and Los Paraguayos. With few exceptions, most of the musical numbers did not make it to the U.S. syndicated series. International airings In 1979, Thames Television purchased a week of transmission time on two stations owned by RKO General that were offering a \\"Thames Week\\" schedule and were in the two largest American television markets: New York City's WOR-TV and KHJ-TV in Los Angeles. This introduced the show to American audiences and became immediately popular; subsequent screenings involved a series of re-edited half-hour programmes culled from the ITV specials. As a result of heavy editing for fear of FCC licence revocation, the early US versions of the show have far less risqu√© material than those broadcast in the UK, though some brief female nudity and subtle sexual innuendo was apparently acceptable. The show was awarded the 'Special Prize of the City of Montreux' at the Rose d'Or festival in 1984. Selected sketches from the first four years (1969‚Äì1972) of the Thames run were also edited into a feature film, The Best of Benny Hill (1974). In 1977, Hill produced a special in Australia (see below) that provided material for some scattered episodes of the U.S. half-hour syndicated edits. The cast of that Australian show included Barry Otto and Ron Shand. The programme also aired on GBC TV in the British Overseas territory of Gibraltar. In Spain, the programme was immensely popular in the early 1980s. With the arrival of the commercial stations, Telecinco, in its first guise, depended heavily on old programming, and The Benny Hill Show would usually air for 60‚Äì90 minutes every night before the 20:30 news programme. In Chile, the programme was broadcast for Universidad de Chile Televisi√≥n from 1981 to 1990. =Repeats= The Benny Hill Show aired in one-hour portions (not corresponding to the original hour- long format), twice nightly on BBC America from October 2004 to April 2007, restoring much of the mature content not seen in previous American airings (as such, most airings had a rating of TV-MA) but also excising most of the musical segments. Half-hour edits also appeared on ITV. As of July 2014, the show is being broadcast on Australia's 7Two. The show has also been aired in India on UTV, dubbed in various Indian languages. Antenna TV, a network created for digital subchannels in the United States, started showing the show Friday and Saturday nights in three-hour blocks on New Year's Day, 1 January 2011. This version, while generally following the half-hour syndicated format, included many of the musical numbers. As of 2017, the show is currently being broadcast on Makedonia TV (M.tv) in Greece. Cancellation In May 1989, Thames Television's Head of Light Entertainment since March 1988, John Howard Davies, invited Hill in for a meeting. Having just returned from a triumphant Cannes TV festival, Hill assumed that they were to discuss details of a new series. Instead, Davies informed Hill that his programme would discontinue production, and that he was dismissing Hill himself. In an episode about Hill from the documentary series Living Famously, Davies stated there were three reasons why he did so: \\"the audiences were going down, the programme was costing a vast amount of money, and he (Hill) was looking a little tired.\\" Hill announced that after 21 years with Thames Television he was quitting and taking a year off. His shows had earned Thames ¬£100 million, with a large percentage due to the success of his shows in the United States. At its peak in 1977, 21.10 million viewers in the U.K. watched Hill's show. In 1989, the last Thames episode attracted 9.58 million viewers. However, this reason for the cancellation has been disputed. Despite declining ratings in the UK, the show was still one of Britain's most successful TV exports, airing in 97 other countries .

The sword has been stored in the Isonokami Shrine since ancient times. The inscription on the blade had been hidden by rust and was rediscovered in the 1870s by Masatomo Kan, a Shinto priest at the shrine. There is a two-sided inscription on the sword which is inlaid in gold.

However, the sword's peculiar design‚Äîwith the tip of the blade counting as the \\"seventh\\" branch‚Äîis indicative of contemporary Korean tree-motifs. Other examples of this motif include the Baekje Crown and the Silla Crown. If the weapon had indeed been produced in Korea, it would have represented one of the prime artistic accomplishments of Baekje swordsmithery.

They addressed the Empress, saying :-\\"West of thy servants' country there is a river-source which issues from Mount Cholsan in Kong-na. It is distant seven days' journey. It need not be approached, but one should drink of this water, and so having gotten the iron of this mountain, wait upon the sage Court for all ages.\\"William George, Nihongi: Chronicles of Japan from the Earliest Times to A.D.697, Tuttle Publishing, 1841 Inscription on the sword The inscription states: In original Chinese characters: :First Side: Ê≥∞‚ñ†ÂõõÂπ¥ÂçÅ(‰∏Ä)ÊúàÂçÅÂÖ≠Êó•‰∏ôÂçàÊ≠£ÈôΩÈÄ†ÁôæÈå¨(Èäï)‰∏ÉÊîØÂàÄ(Âá∫)ËæüÁôæÂÖµÂÆú‰æõ‰æõÂÄôÁéã‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ†‚ñ† (‰Ωú or Á••) :Second Side: ÂÖà‰∏ñ‰ª•‰æÜÊú™ÊúâÊ≠§ÂàÄÁôæÊøüÁéã‰∏ñ(Â≠ê)Â•áÁîüËÅñÈü≥ÊïÖÁà≤ÂÄ≠ÁéãÊó®ÈÄ†ÂÇ≥Á§∫Âæå‰∏ñ Characters in parentheses are ambiguous. Characters represented with black blocks are entirely unreadable. In English: :First Side: \\"At noon on the sixteenth day of the eleventh month [May], fourth year of Tai‚ñ†, the sword was made of 100 times hardened steel. Using the sword repels 100 enemy soldiers [Appropriate for the polite duke lord] It is sent [bestowed] to the duke lord. (Manufactured by or good fortune to...) [ ]\\" :Second Side: \\"Never before has there been such a blade. The crown prince of the king of Baekje, who lives under august sounds, had this sword made for King of Wa in the hope that it might be passed on to later generations.\\" Interpretation of the inscription 2nd character on the first side, and when the sword was made: The first four characters are generally decoded as \\"4th year of Taihe\\" (the era name of Emperor Fei of the Eastern Jin dynasty in China), but the second one is ambiguous. Taihe 4 corresponds to year 369 CE. Kim Sok Hyong, a North Korean scholar proposed a theory that the first two characters instead refer to a local era name of the Baekje,ÈáëÈå´‰∫®, ÏÇºÌïú ÏÇºÍµ≠Ïùò ÏùºÎ≥∏Ïó¥ÎèÑ ÎÇ¥ Î∂ÑÍµ≠Ïóê ÎåÄÌïòÏó¨, Î†•ÏÇ¨Í≥ºÌïô, 1963 but this theory has been challenged since no other archaeological discovery reveals the existence of unique era names assigned by the Baekje.Êú®ÊùëË™†,ÁôæÊ∏àÂè≤Êñô„Å®„Åó„Å¶„ÅÆ‰∏ÉÊîØÂàÄÈäòÊñá, ‰∫∫ÊñáÂ≠¶Â†±, 306Âè∑, 2000 Hong Sung-Hwa, a scholar at Korea University, argues that \\"ÂçÅ(‰∏Ä)ÊúàÂçÅÂÖ≠Êó•(the sixteenth day of the eleventh month)\\" suggests the year 408, because if the 6th, November is Êó•Âπ≤ÊîØ (Êó•Âπ≤ÊîØ is a day by the sexagenary cycle) of ‰∏ôÂçà in 408, the year is the 4 years by King Jun-ji (ËÖÜÊîØÁéã) in Baekje. From this we can speculate that Baekje assigned era names autonomously (Goguryeo and Silla had their own era names). In 409, Wei's envoy visited Baekje, and King Jun-ji extended hospitality to him, so that sword was formed by 408. Middle of the first side: The characters show the sword was made of steel and can repel an enemy. The subsequent characters are the most controversial part of the inscription. Kim notes that the sword uses the term \\"ÂÄôÁéã\\" translated as \\"enfeoffed lord,\\" and thus claimed that the Wa king was subservient to the Baekje ruler. The majority of Japanese scholars do not agree with Kim's theory. They note that the meaning of the term \\"ÂÄôÁéã\\" varied in the different periods. After the Han Dynasty, the term was used fluently and always just as an honorific.ÂÆÆÂ¥éÂ∏ÇÂÆö, Ë¨é„ÅÆ‰∏ÉÊîØÂàÄ, ‰∏≠Â§ÆÂÖ¨Ë´ñÁ§æ, 1983Á•û‰øùÂÖ¨Â≠ê, ‰∏ÉÊîØÂàÄ„ÅÆËß£Èáà„Çí„ÇÅ„Åê„Å£„Å¶, Âè≤Â≠¶ÈõëË™å, Á¨¨84Á∑®Á¨¨11Âè∑, 1975 End of the first side: Although four of the five last characters are undecodable, the last character indicates that the previous ones were either the name of author or a prayer phrase such as \\"Ê∞∏Âπ¥Â§ßÂêâÁ••\\"(Have Great Fortunes Forever\\"). In both cases, the phrase should generally indicate the end of inscription, and that the text on the second side is not a continuation. There is also a theory that the second side was written by different person, or at different time. 11th to 13th characters on the second side, and who presented the sword: the 11th to 13th characters may be decodable as \\"Áéã‰∏ñÂ≠ê\\"(Crown Prince), causing some scholars to regard that the sword was presented by the Crown Prince of Baekje, who eventually ascended as King Geungusu. However, as this segment includes ambiguous characters, it is not entirely clear who in Baekje presented the sword. 17th character on the second side: The character is regarded to be either \\"Èü≥\\"(Sound) or \\"Êôâ\\"(Jin Dynasty). The former interpretation indicates that the phrase \\"Â•áÁîüËÅñÈü≥\\" has a Buddhist or Taoist nuance, and that the bestower has \\"lived under august (holy) sounds\\". Other scholars suggest that the phrase means \\"born coincidentally on august (holy) Jin Dynasty\\". 19th to 23rd characters on the second side, and the presentee: The phrase, \\"Áà≤ÂÄ≠ÁéãÊó®ÈÄ†\\", is translated in various ways through different interpretations of the 22nd character \\"Êó®\\". *\\"Êó®\\" as a personal name: Regarding the letter as a personal name.

Translates \\"for the first time, made (the sword) for King of Wa\\". Treating it as a personal name leads to the Baekje-centric idea that Baekje's presenter boldly writes the name of the King of Wa, and thus regards him lower. Treating it as \\"order\\" leads to the Japan-centric idea that Baekje presented the sword because the King of Wa ordered him to do so. Therefore, the interpretation of this character tends to be controversial. Ueda Masaaki (quoted by Saeki, 1977) is rather an exception among Japanese historians because he ‚Äúhas maintained that the Seven-branched sword was ‚Äòbestowed‚Äô on the Wa ruler by the king of Baekche.‚Äù Ueda ‚Äúbased his interpretation on the argument that the term ‚Äòkoo‚Äô [howang] appearing in the inscription denotes a ruler in vassalage to the Paekche king and that the inscription is written in the commanding tone of a superior addressing an inferior, exemplified by the sentence reading ‚ÄòHand down [this sword] to [your] posterity.\\" However, Saeki (1977) argues that one can not interpret the inscription to mean either ‚Äúto bestow‚Äù the sword on the King in vassalage or ‚Äúto respectfully present‚Äù to the emperor, as many Japanese scholars have maintained since the Meiji period. Saeki seems to be inclined to take Hirano‚Äôs argument that the inscription simply indicates the fact there was a respectful and sincere relationship between the rulers of Baekche and Wa. Yet another theory proposed by K≈çsaku Hamada of Kyushu University suggests that the original seven-branched sword was created by Eastern Jin in 369 (Ê≥∞ÂíåÂõõÂπ¥) for a vassal lord with the first inscription. In 372, King Geunchogo of Baekje sent an embassy to arrive at the court of Eastern Jin in 372, and then a Jin envoy was sent to the Paekche court, granting the title of ‚ÄúGeneral Stabilizing the East and Governor of Le-lang\\" (Èé≠Êù±Â∞áËªç). The sword was given to the king around this time. The king of Baekje ordered the creation of a replica of the sword with the second inscription and sent it to Wa for an alliance as peers under Eastern Jin. Thus no vassalage relationships are involved between Baekje and Wa. He claims that this explains the commanding tone of the first inscription and the respect paid to Jin (owes his life to august Jin) in the second inscription. While the inscription of the sword is controversial and is used by many nationalists to support their own agendas, the sword does prove, at the very least, that there were very close ties between the Baekje and the Wa, and the opening of friendly relations between two countries probably dates to the year 372. In connection with the date of fabrication, Hong Sung-Hwa, a scholar of Korea University, says in 396-409, Baekje came under attack by Goguryeo, so Baekje needed to form an alliance with the Wei; King Jun-ji of Baekje gave King of Wei the sword.

During this ten-year period, the elegies languished incomplete for long stretches of time as Rilke suffered frequently from severe depression‚Äîsome of which was caused by the events of World War I and being conscripted into military service. Aside from brief episodes of writing in 1913 and 1915, Rilke did not return to the work until a few years after the war ended. With a sudden, renewed inspiration‚Äîwriting in a frantic pace he described as a \\"boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit\\"Rilke to Lou Andreas-Salom√© (11 February 1922) in Rilke, Rainer Maria and Andreas-Salom√©, Lou. Briefwechsel (Insel, 1952), 464.‚Äîhe completed the collection in February 1922 while staying at Ch√¢teau de Muzot in Veyras, in Switzerland's Rhone Valley. After their publication in 1923 and Rilke's death in 1926, the Duino Elegies were quickly recognized by critics and scholars as his most important work.Hoeniger, F. David. \\"Symbolism and Pattern in Rilke's Duino Elegies\\" in German Life and Letters Volume 3, Issue 4, (July 1950), pages 271‚Äì283.Perloff, Marjorie. \\"Reading Gass Reading Rilke\\" in Parnassus: Poetry in Review. Volume 25, Number 1/2 (2001). The Duino Elegies are intensely religious, mystical poems that weigh beauty and existential suffering.Gass, William H. Reading Rilke: Reflections on the Problems of Translation. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1999). The poems employ a rich symbolism of angels and salvation but not in keeping with typical Christian interpretations. Rilke begins the first elegy in an invocation of philosophical despair, asking: \\"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?\\" ()Rilke, Rainer Maria. \\"First Elegy\\" from Duino Elegies, line 1. and later declares that \\"every angel is terrifying\\" ().Rilke, Rainer Maria. \\"First Elegy\\" from Duino Elegies, line 6; \\"Second Elegy\\", line 1. While labelling of these poems as \\"elegies\\" would typically imply melancholy and lamentation, many passages are marked by their positive energy and \\"unrestrained enthusiasm\\". Together, the Duino Elegies are described as a metamorphosis of Rilke's \\"ontological torment\\" and an \\"impassioned monologue about coming to terms with human existence\\" discussing themes of \\"the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness ... man's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet\\".Dash, Bibhudutt. \\"In the Matrix of the Divine: Approaches to Godhead in Rilke's Duino Elegies and Tennyson's In Memoriam\\" in Language in India Volume 11 (11 November 2011), 355‚Äì371. Rilke's poetry, and the Duino Elegies in particular, influenced many of the poets and writers of the twentieth century. In popular culture, his work is frequently quoted on the subject of love or of angels and referenced in television programs, motion pictures, music and other artistic works, in New Age philosophy and theology, and in self-help books. Writing and publication history Rilke began writing the first and second elegies at Duino Castle, near Trieste, Italy, after hearing a voice in the wind while walking along the cliffs. =Duino Castle and the first elegies= In 1910, Rilke had completed writing the loosely autobiographical novel, Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge (The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge) in which a young poet is terrified by the fragmentation and chaos of modern urban life. After completing the work, Rilke experienced a severe psychological crisis that lasted for two years.Wellbery, David E.; Ryan, Judith; and Gumbrecht, Hans Ulrich. A New History of German Literature. (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2004), 723. In 1912, still facing this severe depression and despair, Rilke was invited to Duino Castle by Princess Marie von Thurn und Taxis (1855‚Äì1934) (born Princess Marie zu Hohenlohe-Waldenburg-Schillingsf√ºrst) whom he had met a few years before. The princess (who was twenty years older than Rilke) and her husband Prince Alexander (1851‚Äì1939) enthusiastically supported artists and writers.Freedman, Ralph. Life of a Poet: Rainer Maria Rilke. (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1998). While at Duino, Rilke and Princess Marie discussed the possibility of collaborating on a translation of Dante Alighieri's La Vita Nuova (1295). After the Princess left to join her husband at their Lautschin estate, Rilke spent the next few weeks at the castle preparing to focus on work. During these weeks, he was writing Marien-Leben (The Life of Mary). While walking along the cliffs overlooking the Adriatic Sea near the castle, Rilke claimed to hear a voice calling to him speaking the words of the first line, (\\"Who, if I cried out, would hear me among the hierarchies of angels?\\") which he quickly wrote in his notebook. Within days, he produced drafts of the first two elegies in the series and drafted passages and fragments that would later be incorporated into later elegies‚Äîincluding the opening passage of the tenth elegy.Leishman, J. B. and Spender, Stephen (translators). \\"Introduction\\" in Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies. (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1939). Rilke would only finish the third and fourth elegies before the onset of World War I. The third was finished in 1913 in Paris, the fourth in early 1915 in Munich. The effects of the war‚Äîparticularly his traumatic experiences being conscripted into the Austro-Hungarian army‚Äîtriggered a severe renewal of his depression that rendered him unable to write for several years. =Ch√¢teau de Muzot and the creative hurricane= Rilke completed the Duino Elegies at Ch√¢teau de Muzot in Veyras, Switzerland, in a \\"boundless storm\\" of creativity in February 1922. Because of his depression, Rilke was unable to return to writing for several years, and only in 1920 was he motivated to focus towards completing his work on the Duino Elegies. However, for the next two years, his mode of life was unstable and did not permit him the time or mental state he needed for his writing. In 1921, Rilke journeyed to Switzerland, hoping to immerse himself in French culture near Geneva and to find a place to live permanently. At the time, he was romantically involved with Baladine Klossowska (1886‚Äì1969). At the invitation of Werner Reinhart (1884‚Äì1951), Rilke moved into the Ch√¢teau de Muzot, a thirteenth-century manor house that lacked gas and electricity, near Veyras, Rhone Valley, Switzerland. Reinhart, a Swiss merchant and amateur clarinetist, used his wealth to be a patron to many twentieth-century writers and composers. He bought Muzot to allow Rilke to live there rent-free and focus on his work. Rilke and Klossowska moved there in July 1921 and later in the year Rilke translated writings by Paul Val√©ry and Michelangelo into German. Affected by the news of the death of his daughter's friend, the dancer Wera Ouckama Knoop (1900‚Äì1919), Rilke set to work on Sonnets to Orpheus. The Sonnets frequently refer to Wera, both directly where he addresses her by name and indirectly in allusions to a \\"dancer\\" or the mythical Eurydice. Rilke wrote to the young girl's mother stating that Wera's ghost was \\"commanding and impelling\\" him to write.Sword, Helen.

Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926 (Leipzig: Inser-Verlag, 1937). In a rush of inspiration, Rilke worked on the Sonnets and renewed his focus towards completing the remainder of Duino Elegies. In one week, Rilke completed the unfinished elegies, and from 2 to 23 February 1922 he completed all the 55 sonnets of the two parts of Sonnets to Orpheus.Polikoff, Daniel Joseph. In the Image of Orpheus Rilke: a Soul History. (Wilmette, Illinois: Chiron Publications, 2011), 585‚Äì588. Rilke considered both collections to be \\"of the same birth\\".Rilke to Witold Hulewicz (13 November 1925) in Rilke, Rainer Maria. Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926 (Leipzig: Inser-Verlag, 1937), 335‚Äì338. \\"The Elegies and The Sonnets support each other reciprocally, and I see it as an endless blessing that I, with the same breath, was able to fill both sails: the small, rust-colored sail of the sonnets and the great white canvas of the Elegies.\\" In a letter to Klossowska on 9 February 1922, Rilke wrote: \\"what weighed me down and caused my anguish most is done ... I am still trembling from it. ... And I went out to caress old Muzot, just now, in the moonlight.\\"Rilke to Baladine Klossowska (9 February 1922) in Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to Merline 1919‚Äì1922 (St. Paul, Minnesota: Paragon House, 1989), 393. Two days later, completing the last of his work on the Elegies in the evening, he wrote to Lou Andreas-Salom√© that he had finished \\"everything in a few days; it was a boundless storm, a hurricane of the spirit, and whatever inside me is like thread and webbing, framework, it all cracked and bent. No thought of food.\\" =Publication and reception= Duino Elegies was published by Insel-Verlag in Leipzig, Germany in 1923. Prominent critics praised the work and compared its merits to the works of H√∂lderlin and Goethe.Koch, Manfred. \\"Rilke und H√∂lderlin ‚Äì Hermeneutik des Leids\\" in Bl√§tter der Rilke-Gesellschaft 22. (Stuttgart: Thorbecke 1999) 91‚Äì102. In 1935, critic Hans-Rudolf M√ºller was the first to describe the collection as inherently \\"mystical\\" and promote Rilke as a \\"mystic\\" spiritual guide.See M√ºller, Hans Rudolf. Rainer Maria Rilke als Mystiker: Bekenntnis und Lebensdeutung in Rilkes Dichtungen. (Berlin: Furche 1935). See also Stanley, Patricia H. \\"Rilke's Duino Elegies: An Alternative Approach to the Study of Mysticism\\" in Heep, Hartmut (editor). Unreading Rilke: Unorthodox Approaches to a Cultural Myth. (New York: Peter Lang 2000). In My Belief: Essays on Life and Art, German novelist Hermann Hesse (1877‚Äì1962) describes Rilke as evolving within the confines of exploring his existential problems, that \\"at each stage now and again the miracle occurs, his delicate, hesitant, anxiety-prone person withdraws, and through him resounds the music of the universe; like the basin of a fountain he becomes at once instrument and ear\\".Hesse, Hermann, in the essay \\"Rainer Maria Rilke\\" (1928, 1927, 1933) in Part II of Hesse; Ziolkowski, Theodore (editor). My Belief: Essays on Life and Art (New York : Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1974), 337‚Äì342. However, during the 1920s, many of the younger generation of German-language poets and writers did not like Duino Elegies because of the poems' obscure symbols and philosophy. The German poet Albrecht Schaeffer (who is associated with the literary circle of German lyric poet Stefan George) dismissed the poems as \\"mystical blather\\" and described their \\"secular theology\\" as \\"impotent gossip\\". Theodor W. Adorno's Jargon of Authenticity (1964) suggested that the poems are essentially evil: \\"The fact that the neoromantic lyric sometimes behaves like the jargon [of authenticity], or at least timidly readies the way for it, should not lead us to look for the evil of the poetry simply in its form. It is not simply grounded, as a much too innocent view might maintain, in the mixture of poetry and prose. The evil, in the neoromantic lyric, consists in the fitting out of the words with a theological overtone, which is belied by the condition of the lonely and secular subject who is speaking there: religion as ornament.\\"Adorno, The Jargon of Authenticity (translated by Tarnowksi & Will, pp. 68‚Äì69) Adorno further believed the poems reinforced the German value of commitment that supported a cultural attraction towards the principles of Nazism.\\"Adorno's Jargon of Authenticity Reyes\\", Mira T., Miriam College Faculty Research Journal, Vol. 29, No. 1 (2008) Symbolism and themes Rilke employs the rich symbolism of angels influenced by their depiction in Islam to represent the embodiment of transcendental beauty. Throughout the Duino Elegies, Rilke explores themes of \\"the limitations and insufficiency of the human condition and fractured human consciousness ... mankind's loneliness, the perfection of the angels, life and death, love and lovers, and the task of the poet\\". Philosopher Martin Heidegger remarked that \\"the long way leading to the poetry is itself one that inquires poetically\\", and that Rilke \\"comes to realize the destitution of the time more clearly. The time remains destitute not only because God is dead, but because mortals are hardly aware and capable even of their own mortality.\\"Heidegger, Martin. \\"What Are Poets For?\\" (essay) in Hofstadter, Albert (translator) in Poetry, Language, Thought (New York: HarperCollins, 1971), 96. Rilke explores the nature of mankind's contact with beauty, and its transience, noting that humanity is forever only getting a brief, momentary glimpse of an inconceivable beauty and that it is terrifying. At the onset of the First Elegy, Rilke describes this frightened experience, defining beauty as > ... nothing but the beginning of terror which we are barely able to endure > and we are so awed because it serenely disdains to annihilate us.Rilke, > Rainer Maria. \\"First Elegy\\" from Duino Elegies (1923), lines 4‚Äì5, translated > by Mitchell, Stephen (Boston: Shambhala Publications, Inc., 1992). Rilke depicted this infinite, transcendental beauty with the symbol of angels. However, he did not use the traditional Christian interpretation of angels. He sought to utilize a symbol of the angel that was secular, divorced from religious doctrine and embodied a tremendous transcendental beauty. In this, however, Rilke commented that he was greatly influenced by the depiction of angels found in Islam.Campbell, Karen J. \\"Rilke's Duino angels and the angels of Islam\\" in Alif: Journal of Comparative Poetics (January 2003). For Rilke, the symbol of the angel represents a perfection that is \\"beyond human contradictions and limitations\\" in a \\"higher level of reality in the invisible\\". Where there is incongruity that adds to mankind's despair and anxiety is due to human nature keeping us clinging to the visible and the familiar. As mankind encounters the invisible and unknown higher levels represented by these angels, the experience of the invisible will be \\"terrifying\\" (in German, ).Rilke to Witold Hulewicz (13 November 1925) in Rilke, Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926 (Leipzig: Insel-Verlag, 1937), 337. As mankind comes in contact with this terrifying beauty represented by these angels, Rilke is concerned with the experience of existential angst in trying to come to terms with the coexistence of the spiritual and earthly. He portrays human beings as alone in a universe where God is abstract and possibly non-existent, \\"where memory and patterns of intuition raise the sensitive consciousness to a realization of solitude\\". Rilke depicts the alternative, a spiritually fulfilling possibility beyond human limitations in the form of angels.Flemming, Albert Ernest (translator). Rainer Maria Rilke: Selected Poems. (New York:Routledge, 1990), 20‚Äì21. Beginning with the first line of the collection, Rilke's despairing speaker calls upon the angels to notice human suffering and to intervene.Bruhn, Siglind. Musical Ekphrasis in Rilke's Marien-Leben (Rodopi, 2000), 28. There is a deeply felt despair and unresolvable tension in that no matter man's striving, the limitation of human and earthly existence renders humanity unable to reach out to the angels. The narrative voice Rilke employs in the Duino Elegies strives \\"to achieve in human consciousness the angel's presumed plenitude of being\\" (i.e. being, or existence, in German: ).Gosetti-Ferencei, Jennifer Anna. \\"Immanent Transcendence in Rilke and Stevens\\" in The German Quarterly Volume 83, Issue 3 (Summer, 2010), 275‚Äì296. Rilke uses the images of love and of lovers as a way of showing mankind's potential and humanity's failures in achieving the transcendent understanding embodied by the angels. In the Second Elegy, Rilke writes, \\"Lovers, if they knew how, might utter / wondrous things in the midnight air.\\" ()Rilke, Rainer Maria. \\"Second Elegy\\" in Duino Elegies, lines 37‚Äì38. English translation by Leishman, J. B. and Spender, Stephen. Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies. (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1939). He depicts \\"the inadequacy of ordinary lovers\\" and contrasts a feminine form of \\"sublime love\\" and a masculine \\"blind animal passion\\".Leishman, J. B. and Spender, Stephen (translators). \\"Commentary\\" in Rainer Maria Rilke: Duino Elegies. (New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 1939). At the time the first elegies were written, Rilke often \\"expressed a longing for human companionship and affection, and then, often immediately afterwards, asking whether he could really respond to such companionship if it were offered to him ...\\" He notices a \\"decline in the lives of lovers ... when they began to receive, they also began to lose the power of giving\\". Later, during World War I, he would lament that \\"the world has fallen into the hands of men\\".Rilke, Rainer Maria. \\"Introduction\\" and \\"Commentary\\" in Later Poems. (London: Hogarth Press, 1939), 230‚Äì231. In the face of death, life and love is not cheap and meaningless and Rilke asserted that great lovers are able to recognize all three (life, love, and death) as part of a unity. Rilke asserted that the true meaning of love could be understood through death providing love a meaning in this unity‚Äîthat \\"the nature of every ultimate love ... is only able to reach the loved one in the infinite\\".Rilke, Rainer Maria. Briefe aus den Jahren 1914‚Äì1921 (Leipzig: Insel-Verlag, 1937). Rilke wrote his Fifth Elegy inspired by his memory of seeing Picasso's painting Les Saltimbanques (1905) in Paris several years earlier. In a 1923 letter to Nanny von Escher, Rilke confided: > Two inner experiences were necessary for the creation of these books (The > Sonnets to Orpheus and The Duino Elegies). One is the increasingly conscious > decision to hold life open to death. The other is the spiritual imperative > to present, in this wider context, the transformations of love that are not > possible in a narrower circle where Death is simply excluded as The > Other.Rilke to Nanny von Escher (22 December 1923) in Rilke, Rainer Maria. > Briefe aus Muzot: 1921 bis 1926. (Leipzig: Inser-Verlag, 1937). The Fifth Elegy is largely inspired by Pablo Picasso's 1905 Rose Period painting, Les Saltimbanques (\\"The Acrobats\\", also known as \\"The Family of Saltimbanques\\") in which Picasso depicts six figures pictured \\"in the middle of a desert landscape and it is impossible to say whether they are arriving or departing, beginning or ending their performance\\". Rilke depicted the six artists about to begin their performance, and that they were used as a symbol of \\"human activity ... always travelling and with no fixed abode, they are even a shade more fleeting than the rest of us, whose fleetingness was lamented\\". Further, Rilke in the poem described these figures as standing on a \\"threadbare carpet\\" to suggest \\"the ultimate loneliness and isolation of Man in this incomprehensible world, practicing their profession from childhood to death as playthings of an unknown will ... before their 'pure too-little' had passed into 'empty too-much. Because of the profound impact that the war had on him, Rilke expressed a hope in a 1919 letter that the task of the intellectual in a post-war world would be to render the world right. It would be \\"to prepare in men's hearts the way for those gentle, mysterious, trembling transformations from which alone the understandings and harmonies of a serener future will proceed\\". Rilke envisioned his Duino Elegies and the Sonnets to Orpheus as part of his contribution. Influence Rilke and Baladine Klossowska at the Ch√¢teau de Muzot (circa 1922). The two pursued an intense but episodic romance from 1919 until Rilke's death in 1926. Rilke's reputation in the English-speaking world rests largely on the popularity of Duino Elegies.Komar, Kathleen L. \\"Rilke in America: A Poet Re-Created\\" in Heep, Hartmut (editor).

In popular culture, Rilke is frequently quoted or referenced in television programs, motion pictures, music and other works when these works discuss the subject of love or angels.Komar, Kathleen L. \\"Rethinking Rilke's Duisiner Elegien at the End of the Millennium\\" in Metzger, Erika A. A Companion to the Works of Rainer Maria Rilke (Rochester, New York: Camden House, 2004), 189. Because of his work being described as \\"mystical\\", Rilke's works have also been appropriated for use by the New Age community and in self-help books.Komar, Kathleen L. \\"Rilke: Metaphysics in a New Age\\" in Bauschinger, Sigrid and Cocalis, Susan. Rilke-Rezeptionen: Rilke Reconsidered. (T√ºbingen/Basel: Franke, 1995) 155‚Äì169. Rilke has been reinterpreted \\"as a master who can lead us to a more fulfilled and less anxious life\\".Komar, Kathleen L. \\"Rethinking Rilke's Duisiner Elegien at the End of the Millennium\\" in Metzger, Erika A.

Critics and scholars have discussed Pynchon's use of Rilke's lyricism and concepts of transformation in his novel Gravity's Rainbow.Hohmann, Charles. Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow: A Study of its Conceptual Structure and of Rilke's Influence. (New York: Peter Lang, 1986). The first lines of Gravity's Rainbow mirror the first lines of first elegy, portraying the screaming descent of a V-2 rocket in 1944 London, and the novel has been described as a \\"serio-comic variation on Rilke's Duino Elegies and their German Romantic echoes in Nazi culture\\".Locke, Richard. \\"One of the Longest, Most Difficult, Most Ambitious Novels in Years\\" (book review of Gravity's Rainbow by Thomas Pynchon) in The New York Times (11 March 1973). Retrieved 13 April 2013. The British poet W. H. Auden (1907‚Äì1973) has been described as \\"Rilke's most influential English disciple\\" and he frequently \\"paid homage to him\\" or used the imagery of angels in his work. In the 1936 poem cycle Sonnets from China, Auden directly alluded to Rilke's writing of the Duino Elegies.Cohn, Stephen (translator). \\"Introduction\\" in Rilke, Rainer Maria. Duino Elegies: A Bilingual Edition. (Evanston, Illinois: Northwestern University Press, 1989), 17‚Äì18. Quote: \\"Auden, Rilke's most influential English disciple, frequently paid homage to him, as in these lines which tell of the Elegies and of their difficult and chancy genesis ...\\" > Tonight in China let me think of one Who through ten years of silence worked > and waited, Until in Muzot all his powers spoke, And everything was given > once for all. And with the gratitude of the Completed He went out in the > winter night to stroke That little tower like a great old animalAuden, > W(ystan). H(ugh). \\"Sonnets from China\\", XIX, lines 8‚Äì14 (1936); first > published under the title \\"In Time of War\\" in Journey to a War (1939) and > later retitled \\"Sonnets from China\\". The reference here to stroking \\"that little tower\\" is derived from a series of letters written while Rilke was completing the Elegies including a letter he wrote to Klossowska, and one to his former lover, Lou Andreas-Salom√©.York, Richard Anthony. \\"Auden and Rilke\\" in Revista Alicantina de Estudios Ingleses 13 (2000): 205‚Äì219, at 211. In the letter to Andreas-Salom√©, he writes \\"I went out and stroked the little Muzot, which protected it and me and finally granted it, like a large old animal.\\" In later years, Rilke's Duino Elegies and the Sonnets to Orpheus influenced Hans-Georg Gadamer's theories of hermeneutics‚Äîunderstanding how an observer (i.e. reader, listener, or viewer) interprets cultural artifacts (i.e. works of literature, music, or art) as a series of distinct encounters. Gadamer, using examples of Rilke's poetry in his writings, interprets these works as an experience of a divine \\"totality\\" that we must approach with a childlike innocence and ignorance‚Äîthat only through interpreting and reinterpreting can we cope with or solve the existential problems of humanity's significance and impermanence.Hamner, Everett. \\"Gadamer as Literary Critic: 'Authentic Interpretation' of a Rilke Sonnet\\", in Renascence, Essays on Values in Literature 56:4, 256 ff. Gadamer points out that man is in a condition influenced by an anonymous, alienated, and mechanical world that has evolved to stand as an obstacle to his ability to make sense of such experiences.Gadamer, Hans-Georg. \\"The Relevance of the Beautiful: Art as play, Symbol, and festival\\", in The Relevance of the Beautiful and Other Essays (translated by N.

It is five kilometres south of the Dukes Highway and 13 kilometres east of Bordertown. It was first proclaimed a town in 1884. The 2016 Australian census which was conducted in August 2016 reports that Wolseley had a population of 180 people. History The town was surveyed in 1884, and initially named Tatiara, which was described as an \\"Aboriginal word from the Jackegilbrab Tribe which HC Talbot states is divided into six clans (Kooinkill, Wirriga, Chala, Camiaguigara, Niall & Nunkoora)\\". The railway station was named after Lord Wolseley, who was the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army. The name of the town was changed to match the name of the station on 20 February 1941. World War II fuel tanks of No. 12 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot Early in World War II, RAAF No. 12 Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot was established at Wolseley, with an initial capacity of in three tanks camouflaged to look like farm buildings. The depot started operations in 1942 and three additional tanks were added later. It was disbanded on 14 June 1944.Interpretative sign at the site west of Wolseley It is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register as the Wolseley Inland Aircraft Fuel Depot. Railway The Adelaide‚ÄìWolseley railway was opened from Adelaide east to Wolseley railway station in the early 1880s built to broad gauge. The Serviceton railway line from Melbourne reached Serviceton in Victoria in 1886, and the three miles from Wolseley to Serviceton was completed by the South Australian Railways in 1887, completing a broad gauge rail link between Adelaide and Melbourne. Around the same time, the Mount Gambier railway line narrow gauge railway extended to Wolseley station from the south, creating a break-of-gauge rail junction. By May 1883, rail construction had not yet been completed, but trains were able to operate regularly from Bordertown on the Adelaide line and from Custon on the Mount Gambier line, continuing through Naracoorte to Kingston SE. In 1881, the Government of South Australia authorised the construction of a railway from \\"University Block No. 3\\" near the southern border of the Hundred of Tatiara to Border Town. It had previously authorised the construction from Naracoorte to that point in 1879. In the 1950s the break-of-gauge was abolished by the conversion of the Mount Gambier line to broad gauge. The line to Mount Gambier has been out of use since the conversion of the Adelaide ‚Äì Melbourne line to on 12 April 1995, pending possible conversion to standard gauge. If it is converted, it will become the first railway line in Australia to have ever been converted to all 3 gauges. = Railway containers = In 1936, to help overcome some of the inconveniences of the break of gauge, containers were introduced to allow though shipment of goods without the need for transshipment. Governance Wolseley is located in the federal division of Barker, the state electoral district of MacKillop and the local government area of Tatiara District Council.

To afford more clubbing A.J. sells the drum kit Tony gave him as a gift. He asks his parents to provide him a nightclub to manage, a suggestion they scoff at: he is still below the legal drinking age. Carmela wants him to study event planning and Tony offers to get him a place at Beansie's pizzeria. In a session with Dr. Melfi, Tony says that A.J.'s presence is \\"like a bad smell in the house. It's always hanging there.\\" One evening, after slumping at home all day, A.J. takes a knife and goes to see Junior in the mental hospital. When Junior sees him, he begs him to take him home. Unnerved, A.J. drops the knife before even attempting to use it against Junior, and is tackled by orderlies as he tries to escape. Using his influence with Assemblyman Zellman, Tony gets his son released from custody without charge. He is furious; A.J. cries. During A.J.'s next night out clubbing, an acquaintance asks him to get Tony to help him in a dispute with his landlord. Retreating to the restroom A.J. has a panic attack. Vito steals the cell phone of a fellow guest at his bed-and-breakfast in New Hampshire and calls his wife, Marie. She begs him to come home and tells him that Phil wishes to put him through \\"treatment\\" for his homosexuality. Vito tells her not to trust Phil (who is pressuring Tony to find Vito and kill him). He tells Marie where to find $30,000 cash in the house. Pretending to be a writer, he spends more time at Jim's diner. Jim is revealed to also be a father. One evening, Vito sees Jim performing a heroic rescue of a young child while working as a volunteer firefighter. He spends an evening with the firefighters at a local roadhouse; in the parking lot Vito and Jim appear to kiss, but Vito then shoves him off. They throw punches and Jim leaves Vito beaten. Days later, Vito goes back to the diner. \\"Sometimes you tell a lie so long, you don't know when to stop,\\" he says. They take a motorcycle ride together. In a field, under the falling leaves, they have sex. Tony manages to make love to his wife for the first time since his injury. But he is attracted to another woman: Julianna Skiff, a real estate agent who approaches him with an offer from Jamba Juice to buy a building he owns, rented to a long-established company, Caputo's Poultry. Tony rejects the deal, stating that the poultry store is part of its neighborhood. He rejects a second offer but accepts the third, nearly half a million dollars, and she agrees that they should meet in her apartment to complete the paperwork. While Tony is dressing for the encounter, Carmela helps pick out a shirt for him and helps him to button it up. At Julianna's, after Tony signs the paperwork, they start kissing passionately, and Julianna starts unbuttoning his shirt. Tony makes her stop and abruptly departs. At home with Carmela he goes on a tear, saying he's angry because there's no smoked turkey in the fridge. Burt and Patsy make collections in the neighborhood of Tony's property. They fail to extort money from the newly opened branch of a major coffee chain. Caputo furiously tells them Tony Soprano has sold his store premises. \\"What the fuck is happening to this neighborhood?\\" Patsy says. First appearances * Julianna Skiff: a real estate agent with whom Tony almost has an affair. * Rhiannon: an ex-girlfriend of Hernan O'Brien, hanging out with A.J. and others at the nightclub.

This unique event has hosted over 15,000 people on a weekend in June for more than three decades. All proceeds benefit Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit environmental organization. The festival, a celebration for the Hudson River, features singer-songwriters, performers and musicians offering fun with a purpose ‚Äî a diverse mix of contemporary, traditional and American Roots music, dance, family-oriented entertainment and storytelling. In addition to music and dance, a juried craft show, Green Living Expo, working waterfront, environmental education sites, and a \\"circle of song\\" featuring audience participation fill out the weekend's schedule. All behind-the-scenes elements, such as the seven sustainable biodiesel-powered stages,\\"Clearwater looks to new generations\\", Times Herald Record, accessed 23 June 2011 recycling of food waste, volunteer meal preparation, and sponsor selection, are done with goals of sustainability and social responsibility in mind. Use of carpooling, bicycling, and public transportation are encouraged. The entire festival is wheelchair-accessible and staffed with American Sign Language interpreters. Clearwater was one of the first festivals to provide ASL interpreters, with 16 working at the 2011 event. The festival also includes services for the disabled, including 20 on-site wheelchairs and seating in front of every stage.\\"Clearwater festival brings music to deaf fans with stage-side sign- language-interpreters\\", NY Daily News, accessed 23 June 2011 Pete Seeger at the 2007 Clearwater Festival The festival was founded in 1966 by Toshi Seeger and her husband, folk singer Pete Seeger, who regularly performed at it. Among those who have performed over the years are Janis Ian, Arlo Guthrie, Tom Paxton, Michelle Shocked, Tish Hinojosa, Dizzy Gillespie, Paul Winter, Odetta, Buffy Sainte-Marie, Dar Williams, The Skatalites, Ani DiFranco, Taj Mahal, Alhaji Bai Konte, Toshi Reagon, Christine Lavin, Steve Earle, Shawn Colvin, Joan Osborne, Railroad Earth, Donna the Buffalo, Buckwheat Zydeco, Jonatha Brooke, Drive-By Truckers, Indigo Girls, Josh Ritter, Suzanne Vega, Jorma Kaukonen, Billy Bragg, David Bromberg, Peter Yarrow, The Low Anthem, The Felice Brothers, Punch Brothers, Toubab Krewe, the Foremen, and Justin Townes Earle. In 2009, the festival celebrated several auspicious occasions, including the 40th anniversary of the launch of the sloop Clearwater, the 90th birthday of Pete Seeger and the 400th anniversary of Henry Hudson‚Äôs voyage up the river on the Half Moon. Fittingly, festival performers included some longtime folk-centric Clearwater traditions as well as many new artists who made their first appearance at the festival. First-timers in 2009 included veteran vocal group The Persuasions, Grace Potter & The Nocturnals, psychedelic rock band Dr. Dog, Elvis Perkins in Dearland and A.C. Newman, as well as singer-songwriters Alejandro Escovedo and Allison Moorer, plus bluegrass/jam band acts Old Crow Medicine Show and Cornmeal, and the festival's first-ever hip-hop act ReadNex Poetry Squad. Emphasizing the importance of the Hudson River to the festival, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater has added a number of river front activities such as kayaking and rowboating, and rides on the tall ships Clearwater, Mystic Whaler, and Woody Guthrie. History of the festival The festival was founded in the wake of the Storm King Mountain controversy that focused on the Hudson River from 1963 - 1982. The Festival has also had its origins in the Sloop Clearwater itself. To raise money to build the Sloop, Hudson River Sloop Clearwater founders Pete Seeger and friends held a series of small fundraising concerts\\"Walking the Talk, Singing the Song\\" , Roll Magazine, p. 16, accessed 04 November 2010 in the Hudson River Valley and at Sandy Hook in New Jersey, and passed a banjo around the crowd to collect donations. By 1978, the concerts had evolved into a land- based Festival at Croton Point Park, which hosted the Festival for a decade, until pollution problems from the park's landfill forced a relocation to a suburban college campus. It was not until 1999 that the Festival was able to move back to the park and the shores of the Hudson River.\\"Festival Information\\" , Clearwater Festival website, accessed 04 November 2010 The 2016 festival, which would have been the 50th anniversary of the festival, was cancelled so that resources could be directed to a substantial restoration of the sloop Clearwater. The festival returned in 2017. Mission of the festival The Great Hudson River Revival is produced by Hudson River Sloop Clearwater, Inc., a nonprofit, member-supported, environmental organization, to raise funds and consciousness on the plight of the river and the earth, as well as uniting the community around the river. All proceeds go directly to support Clearwater‚Äôs environmental research, education, and advocacy to help preserve and protect the river and its tributaries, as well as communities in the river valley. The Festival makes possible innovative educational initiatives such as Clearwater‚Äôs New Hudson River School, which has helped more than 430,000 young people and over 250,000 adults experience the wonders of the River from aboard the Sloop Clearwater.

The series is a continuation of the 2002 movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding and was produced by Sony Pictures Television and Tom Hanks's Playtone Productions for CBS. The two lead characters' names are changed, from Toula and Ian, to Nia and Thomas. Series star Nia Vardalos also oversaw the show as one of the co-executive producers, along with Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, who made a guest appearance in one episode as Nia's cousin. Premise The series, which is set in Chicago, follows the main character, Nia Portokalos, a Greek-American woman, as she deals with her family and her new non-Greek husband Thomas Miller, an English teacher who still does not seem to fit in with her family's Greek traditions. Despite the help and interference from her family and her husband, Nia tries her best to stay grounded in various situations. Besides her husband, the family members in her \\"life\\" include her parents Maria and Gus, who own the Greek restaurant where she works; her brother Nick, who is not very bright and feels ambivalent toward Thomas; her wise Aunt Voula; and her gossipy cousin Nikki. While the series follows on from the movie My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the first names of the leading couple have been changed. In the film, Nia Vardolos' character was Fotoula \\"Toula\\" Portokalos; her husband (played in the film by John Corbett) was named Ian Miller. Ratings The sitcom premiered with high ratings, averaging 22.9 million viewers. Its debut was the highest-rated premiere of any network sitcom since NBC's Jesse. The following week ratings dropped 28%, averaging 16.5 million viewers, but surpassing FOX's The Simpsons which finished second place. However, the decline in ratings led to the sitcom's eventual cancellation by CBS.

It was originally classified as an early and very primitive member of Therapsida, a group that includes mammals and their close extinct relatives. However, it is now seen as a primitive non-therapsid sphenacodont rather than a genuine basal therapsid. Description Restoration Tetraceratops is known from a single skull discovered in Texas in the early 1900s. Contrary to its genus name, Tetraceratops actually has six horns, one pair being on the premaxilla bones, one pair on the prefrontal bones, and one pair on the angular processes of the mandible. When it was discovered and described in 1908, the skull was still embedded in a matrix, and only the premaxilla and prefrontal pairs were visible. In life, thus, it would have resembled a large lizard with four horns on its snout, and a pair of large spines emanating from the corners of its jaw. In addition to horns, Tetraceratops also had an impressive set of teeth. The second pair of teeth on the maxillary bones were large and fang-like. Likewise the first teeth in the upper jaw were long and dagger-like. A diagram of the skull Classification Hypothetical full-body reconstruction Tetraceratops was originally identified as a member of a group called Pelycosauria, an evolutionary grade of synapsids more basal than therapsids. It has been variously grouped in the family Sphenacodontidae, which is closely related to Therapsida, and Eothyrididae, which is more distantly related. Recent phylogenetic studies classify it as either a pelycosaur-grade synapsid or the basalmost therapsid, rendering its exact phylogenetic placement unclear. However, a new study by Spindler (in press) concluded that no convincing morphological evidence could be made for a therapsid placement of Tetraceratops and that this genus was better placed as a basal sphenacodontian.

Named after the Austrian dramatist Ferdinand Raimund, the theatre was built by an association of Viennese citizens and opened on November 28, 1893 with Raimund's play Die gefesselte Phantasie. It can seat around 1,200 people. The theater is currently owned by Vereinigte B√ºhnen Wien (VBW) along with the Theater an der Wien and the Ronacher. Its current main use is for major musical productions.

The theatre mainly presented German folk dramas and plays. In 1908 it turned to operetta, with Johann Strauss' The Gypsy Baron. Other premieres included Robert Stolz's Das Gl√ºcksm√§del and Dreim√§derlhaus, set to various pieces of music by Franz Schubert; this was performed more than 1200 times between 1916 and 1927. As the theatre was spared bombing damage during World War II, the theatre re- opened promptly on 25 April 1945 with Dreim√§derlhaus. In 1948, Rudolf Marik took over as director for almost 30 years, transforming it into an internationally recognised theatre of the German-speaking world exclusively staging operettas with stars such as Johannes Heesters, Marika R√∂kk, and others. Many well-known actors started their careers at the Raimund Theatre, including Hansi Niese, Paula Wessely, Attila H√∂rbiger, and Karl Skraup. After 1976 the theatre was occasionally used for musicals, such as Kurt Weill's Lady in the Dark. = Renovation = Inside the theater In 1985 the theatre was renovated, re-opening with the gala Seinerzeit; since March 1987 it has formed part of the Vereinigte B√ºhnen Wien. A Chorus Line was followed by Les Mis√©rables in 1988 and Phantom of the Opera in 1990, which transferred from the Theater an der Wien. In 1993, on the anniversary of its opening, the German-language version of Kiss of the Spider Woman was premiered. This was followed by the Austrian premiere of Grease in 1994 and the European premiere of Disney's Beauty and the Beast in 1995. Autumn 1997 saw the world premiere of Dance of the Vampires in Roman Polanski's production. After Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat and a new production of Hair in September, 2002, Wake Up was premiered, being the first musical by Rainhard Fendrich and Harold Faltermeyer. On March 11, 2004 Dave Stewart's rock musical Barbarella had its world premiere. This was followed in 2005 by the German-language version of Romeo & Julia, a musical by G√©rard Presgurvic based on Shakespeare. In September 2006, the new musical Rebecca, by Michael Kunze and Sylvester Levay, premiered at the theatre. On January 24, 2008 the musical We Will Rock You featuring the music of Queen opened at the Raimund with its largest ever advance ticket sale of 90,000. Original Queen members Roger Taylor and Brian May joined the cast on stage for the finale. After \\"We will rock You\\", The Musical \\"Rebecca\\" came back for a short season from September until the end of December 2008. On 26 February 2009, the theatre opened with a new production of the \\"VBW\\", the musical \\"Rudolf - Affaire Mayerling\\". This production was a \\"Try-out\\" at Budapest and then it moved to Vienna. In March 2010 a musical with songs by Udo J√ºrgens, an Austrian songwriter and entertainer, called \\"Ich war noch niemals in New York\\" opened and is going to stay until the end of June 2012.

He wanted to be the first man to bring a baseball team to the Deep South. Bartholomay worked with many civic leaders to help attain his dream. After an extended legal battle with Milwaukee that kept the Braves from moving through the 1965 season, and many death threats, the National League agreed to the shift to Atlanta. The case ultimately led to baseball's guidelines on local ownership. In 1976, Bartholomay was approached with a business proposition by a friend, Ted Turner: The two knew that a baseball team and network deal would be a good way to market the Atlanta Braves on a national scale and provide programming for Turner's developing (TBS) network.

Retrieved March 6, 2014 Often situated in geographically inferior locations, such as former agricultural floodplains, colonias suffer from associated issues like flooding.Neal, D. E., Famira, V. E., & Miller-Travis, V. (2010). Now is the Time: Environmental Injustice in the U.S. and Recommendations for Eliminating Disparities (pp. 48-81). Washington DC: Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. Furthermore, urbanization practices have amplified the issues, such as when developers strip topsoil from the ground in order to subdivide land, the resulting plains become breeding grounds for mosquitoes and disease. Traditional homeownership financing methods are rare amongst colonias residents, and therefore these areas consist of ramshackle housing units built incrementally with found material on expanses of undeveloped land.Dabir, S. (2001). Hardship and hope in the border colonias. Journal of Housing & Community Development, 58(5), 31. Colonias have a predominant Latino population where 85 percent of those Latinos under the age of 18 are United States citizens. The U.S. has viewed border communities as a place of lawlessness, poverty, backwardness, and ethnic difference. Despite the economic development, liberalization and intensification of trade, and strategic geographic location, the southern U.S. border is one of the poorest regions in the nation. Most cases had shown that these communities formed when landowners illegally sold and subdivided rural lands, often to buyers who did not understand the terms under which this land was being sold. The contract for deed through which plots were offered by land developers often made false promises that utilities would be installed. The majority of these communities have no water infrastructures and lack wastewater or sewage services.VanDerslice, J. (2011) Drinking Water Infrastructure and Environmental Disparities: Evidence and Methodological Considerations. American Journal of Public Health, 101(S1), S109-S114. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2011.300189 Where sewer systems do exist there are no treatment plants in the area, and untreated wastewater is dumped into arroyos and creeks that flow into the Rio Grande or the Gulf of Mexico. More than 2,000 colonias are identified within the U.S. The highest concentration is in Texas, with others in New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Evidence suggests that there are more than 1,800 designated colonias in Texas, around 138 in New Mexico, 77 in Arizona, and 32 in California.Mukhija, V., & Monkkonen, P. (2007). What's in a name? A Critique of 'Colonias' in the United States (Vol. 31.2, pp. 475-88). Malden, MA: International Journal of Urban and Regional Research. These settlements are part of an informal sector or informal economy that is not bound by the structures of government regulations within labor, tax, health and safety, land use, environmental, civil rights, and immigration laws. Etymology The Spanish word colonia means a 'colony' or 'community'. In Mexican Spanish, it is specifically a 'residential quarter [of a city]', and a colonia proletaria is a shantytown.Collins Spanish-English Dictionary, online, s.v. In Spanglish, the English-Spanish mix, colonia began to be used to refer primarily to Mexican neighborhoods about thirty years ago. A 1977 study uses the term colonia to describe rural desert settlements with inadequate infrastructure and unsafe housing stock.Lyndon Baines Johnson School of Public Affairs. 1997. Colonia Housing and Infrastructure 1 \\"Current Characteristics and Future Needs\\"; 2 \\"Water and Wastewater\\"; Policy Research Report no. 124; vol 3, Regulatory Issues and Policy Analysis. Austin: University of Texas. Since these Hispanic neighborhoods were less affluent, the word also connoted poverty and substandard housing.404 In the 1990s, colonias became a common American English name for the slums that developed on both sides of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The history of the word colonias in the United States, and its interpretation through politics, suggests that places called colonias are not to be perceived as natural or prosperous communities. In many parts of Texas, Spanish-language terms are often used to frame and highlight a class difference.Vila, P. (2000) Crossing borders, reinforcing borders: social categories, metaphors, and narrative identities on the U.S.‚ÄìMexico frontier. University of Texas Press, Austin. The term colonia is an essential symbol for public policy in the United States, and this Spanish name is a critical component for constructing public and policy attention, underscoring the settlements' differences and labelling them as racialized and distinct places, which has a powerful way of constructing and reinforcing marginality.Wilson, D. (1996) Metaphors, growth coalitions, and black-poverty neighborhoods in a U.S. city. Antipode 28.1, 72‚Äì97.Wilson, D. and H. Bauder (2001) Discourse and the making of marginalized people. Journal of Economic and Social Geography 92.3, 259‚Äì61. Definition Section 916 of the National Affordable Housing Act (NAHA) defines colonias as any \\"identifiable community\\" determined by objective criteria that include the lack of potable water and adequate sewage systems, the lack of decent, safe, and sanitary housing, and which were in existence before the passage of the Cranston‚ÄìGonzalez National Affordable Housing Act (1990). According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the term colonias has a specific meaning within the U.S., referring to a community within the rural Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border region with marginal conditions related to housing and infrastructure. Other definitions and criteria for a colonia are used by the Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Texas Code. History Researchers traced the first colonias in Texas to the 1950s and early 1960s.Cisneros, Ariel. \\"Texas Colonias.\\" Housing and Infrastructure Issues. Dallas Fed, June 2001. Web. 19 Mar. 2014. These appeared as an informal housing solution for low-income predominantly Hispanic wage-earners through a model referred to by scholars as the \\"incremental approach\\". Due to the rise of the maquiladora industry‚Äîforeign-owned factories in Mexico creating goods for export‚Äîthe border population quickly grew and in 1965 created a housing shortage for these workers.Hanna, David L. \\"Third World Texas: NAFTA, State Law, and Environmental Problems Facing Texas Colonias.\\" Mary's LJ 27 (1995): 871. The overlap of four variables attributed to the development of colonias: high demand from a population of low-income wage earners meeting a low supply of affordable housing, a supply of low-cost and fruitless land, the absence of regulations on the subdivision of that land, and a legal way for that land to be sold to individuals. Land developers began purchasing low-value land in peri-urban areas where strict enforcement of housing and environmental laws was either weak or nonexistent. During this period the sale of rural lands without basic housing policies was lawful. Colonias were hidden from view due to physical isolation and properties were divided into small lots, which would be bought by low-income families via contracts for deed. These deals, which sold unimproved lots, included undocumented and thus unenforceable promises to provide basic provisions such as water, sewage, and electricity.Delgado, Richard. \\"Rodrigo's Twelfth Chronicle: The Problem of the Shanty.\\" Geo. LJ 85 (1996): 667. Because these deals lacked a foreclosure period or buyer's protection, any property that was not paid in full could be repossessed and resold by the sellers, who retained title for the land and were allowed to keep all payments the buyer had made. As more dwellings appeared with minimal infrastructure, the value of the land decreased and ultimately became more affordable as a living option for low- income families on the border. Colonia communities grew rapidly in the 1990s when the number of residents almost doubled from 1990 to 1996. This can be subject to the effects of globalization and the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994, which industrialized the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, created many jobs,\\"Legal Issues in New Mexico's Colonias Report.\\" Environmental Justice Issues (2010): 1‚Äì72. Web. 27 Feb. 2014. and encouraged migration.\\"Globalization.\\" Merriam-Webster, n.d. Web. 07 May 2014. People shifted from traditional agricultural labor to work in transportation, construction, and manufacturing. This led to an increased informality of U.S. housing, with colonias forming and growing because of the border's strategic location and trade liberalizations.Cesar, Rodriguez A., and Boaventura De Sousa Santos. Law and Globalization from Below: Towards a Cosmopolitan Legality. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2005. Print. However, due to the lack of financial mobility, colonia residents face significant challenges escaping the colonia bubble. In June 1996, the Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs successfully obtained a waiver from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to set new housing-standards for colonias.\\"Colonia Housing Standards (CHS).\\" Colonia Housing Standards. Texas Department of Housing and Community Affairs, n.d. Web. 21 Mar. 2014. The resulting standards provided a basis for safe and sanitary housing to alleviate the existing health risks. These standards are necessary for economic development in colonias because unsafe infrastructures and lack of education and jobs inhibit their growth.Donelson, Angela J., and Adrian X. Esparaza. \\"The Colonias Reader.\\" Economy, Housing, and Public Health in U.S. Mexico Border Colonias. The University of Arizona Press, 2010. Web. 07 May 2014. As of 2007, Texas had the largest concentration of colonia residents in the U.S., with approximately 400,000 living in over 2,000 colonias.\\"Colonias FAQ's (Frequently Asked Questions) ,\\" Texas Secretary of State. New Mexico had the second largest, followed by Arizona and California.\\"Designated Colonias in New Mexico ,\\" Homes and Communities United States Department of Housing and Urban Development. However, as remote location and stealthy development characterize many colonias, exact counts are difficult and figures can quickly change. Despite the high count of individuals living in these areas, the severity of the living standards in colonias has yet to become common knowledge for U.S. citizens. Scholars have found that little has been done to remedy the living standards of the colonians, as their situation has become normalized by the public and associated with the \\"lawlessness\\" of the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border region. Scholars have criticized the naming of these settlements as colonias, stating that the use of the Spanish word not only creates difficulties within the public policy sector of government, but also fosters the notion that these settlements are alien and not a part of the U.S. However, those within the public that do recognize colonias and their living conditions view them as \\"border slums\\",Mukhija, V., & Monkkonen, P. (2007). \\"What's in a name? A critique of 'colonias' in the United States.\\" International Journal of Urban and Regional Research, 31(2), 475‚Äì488. while scholars have since the 1990s described them as a \\"third world\\" within the United States.Rios, Jo Marie, and Pamela S. Meyer. \\"Community building and public health in a South Texas Colonia.\\" National Civic Review 95.4 (2006): 54‚Äì57. While poor living standards do persist in these areas, a positive side does exist for colonias and is often disregarded by media and policymakers. For the border region's poor, colonias provide affordable housing and the opportunity to obtain the American Dream of owning a home. Some scholars have praised colonians for seeking the realization of this dream through self-help. Because of this, the informed public has begun urging policymakers to make decisions that will not eliminate colonias but instead both enhance the living conditions and promote the incremental approach as a housing strategy, stating that this informal housing option creates opportunity. Colonias by state Divergent state subdivision regulations have influenced the historical development of colonias, and how each state defines a colonia. Independent historical accounts should be considered by state.Simmons, Nancy. 1997. \\"Memories and Miracles; Housing the Rural Poor along the United States-Mexico Border: A Comparative Discussion of Colonia Formation in El Paso County, Texas and Do√±a Ana County, New Mexico.\\" New Mexico Law Review. 27: 33-75. =Colonias in Texas= Around the 1950s, developers began creating subdivisions along the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border on agriculturally poor properties, divided land in small parcels, and provided few services; the development of the properties, intended for low-income buyers, was the beginning of the Texas colonias. By 1995, the state passed laws against developing subdivisions without services. From 1995 and 2011, the office of the Texas Attorney General had 87 judgments against developers who created properties without services. The office of the Texas Attorney General said that, by 2011, Texas had about 2,294 colonias and estimates that about 500,000 lived in the colonias. As of 2011 Hidalgo County has the largest number of colonias in Texas, though estimating their population is difficult due to isolation, shared addresses, rapid changes in development, and mistrust of government.Grinberg, Emmanuella, \\"Impoverished border town grows from shacks into community\\". CNN. July 8, 2011. Retrieved on July 9, 2011. =Colonias in New Mexico= In New Mexico, about 150 colonias have qualified for colonia-funding sources such as HUD, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), etc. In New Mexico, there are two types of colonias: small towns and subdivisions. Although many of New Mexico's colonias consist of rural small towns, they were considered colonias because of the absence of resources. Conflicts with acceptable water, sewers, and safe and clean housing that the colonias faced brought on the requirement of Section 916 of the National Affordable Housing Act of 1992. In New Mexico, land was sold contract-for-deed; however, before 1990, New Mexicans were allowed to divide their property into four parcels without violating the law. Within a couple of years, landowners were then allowed to split their land into two parcels, but after some time, the subdivision law was amended to close this \\"loophole utilized by colonia developers\\". Characteristics =Demographics= Colonias can be found in each U.S. state on the Mexican border: Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. Residents are mostly Hispanic and about 65% of the colonia population were born in the United States.\\"Colonias in Texas (in California).\\" Colonias. UWEC, n.d. Web. 07 May 2014. Overall, colonias consist of low-income communities with families that cannot afford goods in a formal economy. In a random survey by the Texas Department of State Health Services, it was found that half of the families have incomes of less than $834 a month. About 70% of colonia residents have not graduated from high school and many lack English-language skills, which hampers their job mobility, suppresses wages, and the ability to seek assistance. The unemployment rate for families in colonias is 18%, compared to 11% in neighbouring cities. Residents of colonias pay, on average, 58% of their income on housing. In comparison, a two-bedroom apartment in Albuquerque, New Mexico costs $830, only 20% of the average income in the U.S.\\"Albuquerque NM MSA Average Apartment Rental Rates.\\" Albuquerque, 2014. Colonia housing costs too much relative to the resident earnings and the living conditions are significantly worse. =Housing= Colonias may lack all of the essential physical infrastructures and public services: clean water, sanitary sewage, and adequate roads. Most colonia housing does not meet construction standards and building codes.Alberto, Carlos. \\"Housing Diversity and Consolidation in Low Income Colonias: Patterns of House Form and Household Arrangements in Colonias of the US-Mexico Border.\\" ProQuest. Texas A&M; University, 2009. Web. 07 May 2014. Houses are often built little by little, starting as shabby tents of wood and cardboard. Only 54% of colonia residents in Texas have sewer service and about 50% drink water from a non-tap source. Because they do not qualify for financing, Colonia residents buy their land on a contract for deed, in which land ownership stays with the seller until the entire purchase is paid. This land eventually ends up to be worthless as the market for colonia housing is very low. Most houses cannot pass inspections to qualify for repairs and further improvements. The housing situation in Cameron County, Texas lacks certain infrastructure and requires $44 million to upgrade all of the homes. Financially, families living in colonias lack the assets to add improvements in order for sustainability. These poor minority communities are also prime targets for hazardous waste facilities because of their inability to file lawsuits. Most such facilities in New Mexico are located within a radius of a colonia. These include landfills, power plants, and waste facilities which all have negative impacts on the communities' lifelong health. The legal options available to colonia residents to fight the placement of these facilities are slim. Many are unaware of the public benefits available to them, and applying for benefits can be a struggle when extensive documentation and many visits to state offices are required. Ultimately, immigrants in the border region face language barriers and fear of retaliation against family members without any form of identification. =Health disparities= Health-related quality of life A 2008 pilot study of factors affecting health-related quality of life (HRQL) of Mexican- American adults living in colonias found that colonia residents fall below the U.S. average.Mier, N., Ory, M. G., Zhan, D., Conkling, M., Sharkey, J. R., & Burdine, J. N. (2008). Health-related quality of life among Mexican Americans living in colonias at the Texas‚ÄìMexico border. Social Science & Medicine, 66(8), 1760-1771. doi:10.1016/j.socscimed.2007. 12.017 By examining Mexican- Americans residing in Hidalgo County, Texas, investigators found that Mexican Americans living in colonias share similar mental health patterns compared to the U.S. average but their physical health was worse. Data collected through a household survey in 2002 and 2003 by the Integrated Health Outreach System Project (IHOS) was analyzed to describe the population in terms of sociodemographic status, HRQL, and other variables. In the responses to this survey, 81% considered that access to healthcare services was a problem; 62.5% mentioned housing; 76.5% perceived not having enough recreational and cultural activities; 86% perceived social issues; and 41.1% perceived physical environmental problems, specifically polluted air or water. In conclusion, the research provides significant data acknowledging health disparities colonia residents continuously face. In June 2010 The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law released a report that claims there is enough data in the historical record to demonstrate a direct correlation between abated health outcomes, health disparities, and premature morbidity and mortality with one's zip code. Researchers have determined that, for people of color or low income, this can predetermine their life expectancy. Alcohol use, anxiety, traumatic stress, and hopelessness In a 2009 study, a participatory model of one hundred Mexican-origin colonia residents showed that participants who met the criteria for alcohol dependence showed more symptoms of anxiety and post-traumatic stress than the national average. Investigators found that among Mexican-American immigrants, lifetime prevalence for any anxiety disorder in men was 9% and 18% for women. For Mexican Americans born in the United States, 20% of men and 27% of women met the criteria for anxiety disorders.Blume, A. W., Resor, M. R., Villanueva, M. R., & Braddy, L. D. (2009). Alcohol use and comorbid anxiety, traumatic stress, and hopelessness among Hispanics. Addictive Behaviors, 34(9), 709-713. doi:10.1016/j.addbeh.2009.03.039 Mexican Americans living in colonia have considerable health risks due to unsafe living conditions, low educational attainment, high unemployment, comparatively high rates of communicable illness, lack of access to health care, and poverty. Furthermore, the study found that people living in colonias had the highest rates of binge drinking and alcohol dependence correlated with anxiety, traumatic stress, and hopelessness. In a 2005 study, researchers found that \\"people with low socioeconomic status have dramatically higher disease risks and shorter life spans\\" than wealthier people.Sapolsky, R. (2005). Sick of Poverty (pp. 92-99). Scientific American, Inc. Therefore, poor people have less access to health care and more incidents of harmful lifestyles associated with drinking, smoking, and obesity. School-based nutrition In nutritional research, investigators assessed the experiences of child food insecurity and seasonal instability within Mexican-origin mother-child dyads living in Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border colonias. By focusing on food insecurity, which is known to cause health effects across a lifespan, investigators sought to understand the effects of school-based and summertime nutrition programs amongst women and their children, specifically within Texas-border colonias. An important attribute of this research was that the study depended on a multi-level analysis, which relied on repeated measurements. It also took into account the perceptions and experiences of children within the research. According to research, food insecurity among Hispanic and Mexican-origin U.S. households exceeds national estimates (Nalty, 2013). Furthermore, in 2011, 26.2% of Hispanic families in the United States were food insecure, and 17.4% households with child-food insecurity were Hispanic.Nalty, C. C., Sharkey, J. R., & Dean, W. R. (2013). School-based nutrition programs are associated with reduced child food insecurity over time among Mexican-origin mother-child dyads in Texas border Colonias. Journal of Nutrition, 143(5), 708-713. Childhood obesity In consultation with local decision-makers, 2013 research of childhood obesity in Mexican-American low-income communities resulted in recommendations addressing related issues within communities like colonias. Four policy ideas came about: *establishing sustainable community- based health programs; *improving neighborhood infrastructure and safety; *increasing access to parks; *supporting community organizations to disseminate health education to parents and children.Mier, N., Smith, M., Irizarry, D., Carrillo-Zuniga, G., Lee, C., Trevino, L., & Ory, M. G. (2013). \\"Bridging Research and Policy to Address Childhood Obesity Among Border Hispanics: A Pilot Study.\\" American Journal of Preventive Medicine, 44(s3), S208‚ÄìS214. doi:10.1016/j.amepre.2012.11.013 According to a 2009 study by R. Gottlieb, food issues \\"are particularly pronounced in low-income communities where lack of access to fresh, affordable healthy food has direct health and nutritional consequences\\".Gottlieb, R. (2009). Where we live, work, play‚Ä¶ and eat: Expanding the Environmental Justice agenda (Environmental Justice ed., Vol. 2, pp. 7-8): Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. He explains that core land-use factors such as housing, transportation, and commercial space are issues of food justice and environmental justice, and that addressing these issues can help reduce health disparities among border residents. = Education = Education in the border region is substandard on both sides. While completion and attainment rates are much higher in the U.S. than in Mexico, they are far below the U.S. average. The low levels of education along the border region are due to lack of proper infrastructure, low property-tax funding for schools, and pressing financial need which sees children contributing to family incomes. The primary problem with the education system in colonias is the lack of funding. In Texas, the Texas Education Agency determines education directives while the majority of school funding comes from local property taxes. For the low-income colonias, these directives can present fiscal obstacles which stand in the way of the quality of education. Population growth among the colonias make it so the funding of education is controversial and socially divisive. There is also a problem in finding direct-service providers who will educate the children in the colonias. Schools districts have taken measures to attract teachers to the prospect of working in these areas, though finding qualified teachers has become an increasingly difficult task. Public policy action Rather than being illegal, colonias are considered \\"extra-legal\\", in that they circumnavigate the law rather than violating it. In response to these systems, scholars are split between egalitarian and libertarian approaches. Those that support the egalitarian approach believe that colonias currently demonstrate a notion of inferiority for those that dwell there; in response, they propose standards of living enforced by government regulation. However, supporters of the libertarian style favor the informality of this living system for providing an affordable housing option for those in need, and criticize government action to impose living standards without providing colonians with the resources to sustain them. the housing quality of colonias continues to be unregulated. Informality in housing continues to expand while the social distance between the middle class and lower class expands. Fewer opportunities are available to the uneducated and poor. However, legal expert Jane Larson has proposed a policy of progressive realization, which would gradually extend standards in colonias. Incentives such as microcredit programs are being implemented which then allow families to reach acceptable levels of housing quality. The model addresses equality by setting a standard for housing based upon compliance of available resources, and would commit the government and people towards the common goal of sustainable housing. However, this does not mean that governments do not have obligations once a certain standard is reached.\\"Progressive Realisation and Non-regression.\\" Progressive Realisation and Non-regression. ESCR-Net, 3 Aug. 2012. Web. 07 May 2014. The progressive realization model requires continual progress in a relationship between law and society, which directly corresponds to the choices of those living in colonias. Enhancing the lives of the colonians through policy has proven to be difficult and slow. Funding for infrastructure projects for colonias is contingent on defining a \\"colonia\\", and establishing effective criteria for this purpose has proven to be a challenge. The Farm Housing provisions of the United States Code define a colonia as a community that (1) is in the state of Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas; (2) is within of the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border (except for any metropolitan area exceeding one million people); (3) on the basis of objective criteria, lacks adequate sewage systems and lacks decent, safe, and sanitary housing; and (4) existed as a colonia before November 28, 1990. (f)(8) Other definitions are used by specific governmental agencies (e.g.: HUD, USDA, Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], and the Texas Code). Many scholars criticize the existing federal criteria as being too broad in that most definitions of colonias are based on the archetype that exists on the border in Texas. While colonias in Texas are known for being peri-urban settlements with mostly Hispanic dwellers, settlements in California are located in old rural towns with ethnically diverse populations. This has hindered colonia infrastructure development in California. Criteria have also been described as too narrow, relying on numeric values to determine whether a settlement qualifies. Under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), funds designated within the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) were to benefit colonias along the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border, defined by various numeric values. However, colonias such as those in Riverside and San Diego counties are disqualified from the CBDG for being within metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) with over a million people. Similarly, the U.S. Department of Agriculture limits its colonias to settlements of no more than 20,000 residents, disqualifying the majority of communities seeking funding in California. The EPA's definition of colonias derives from NAFTA, which limits these colonias to a distance from the border. This limits all designated colonias in California to roughly the area of Imperial County. =Programs= Multinational environmental agreements The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation (NAAEC) is an international environmental-agreement between the governments of Canada, Mexico, and the United States.Canada, Mexico, and the United States of America. Agreement Concerning the Establishment of a Border Environment Cooperation Commission and a North American Development Bank. N.p.: n.p., n.d. Print. NAFTA sought to promote economic growth by lowering most of the existing barriers to trade. While many advocates of NAFTA argued that it would indirectly increase the standard of living and thus environmental spending on the border, many critics commented on the fact that only a single sentence in the agreement's preamble addressed the environmental impacts of promoting free trade. In order to ensure that NAFTA would pass, the Clinton Administration pushed for NAAEC as a side agreement specifically to aid border environmental issues. From NAAEC came the creation of the Commission on Environmental Cooperation (CEC), an institution providing a forum for environmental-law enforcement disputes to be resolved. Scholars generally agree that the NAAEC's diction is ambiguous and does not clearly define the authority that the organization has; it is also unclear whether violators are obligated to respond to inquiries made by the CEC, and thus few parties have actually been investigated and punished for failing to cooperate. The charter creating the Border Environment Cooperation Commission (BECC) and North American Development Bank (NADB) was the first multinational agreement to address the problems faced by colonians. These two binational institutions were created to resolve issues that revolve around land contamination and sustainable water/wastewater infrastructure and compensate for CEC's shortcomings.Carter, Nicole, and Leonard Ortolano. \\"Working Toward Sustainable Water and Wastewater Infrastructure in the US‚ÄìMexico Border Region: A Perspective on BECC and NADBank.\\" International Journal of Water Resources Development 16.4 (2000): 691‚Äì708. Print. However, BECC/NADB does not explicitly address the colonias themselves but rather the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border, defining the border as areas in the U.S. \\"within 100 kilometers [62 miles] and the area in Mexico that is within 300 kilometers [190 miles] of the international boundary.\\"\\"Eligibility Requirements.\\" BECC: Border Environment Cooperation Commission. N.p., n.d. Web. 12 Mar. 2014. BECC/NADB consists of a board comprising members from both the U.S. and Mexican governments, and thus lies equally within the jurisdiction of each nation's government; this includes the Administrator for EPA and the Secretaries of State and Treasury from the U.S., and the Secretaries for the Environment and Natural Resources, Treasury, and External Relations from Mexico, as well as one state representative and non-governmental organization from each country. The BECC certifies projects that meet criteria in order to receive funding from the NADB. Projects can be proposed by anyone; in doing this, the BECC/NADB seek to promote public participation in sustainably developing the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border. Though the programs have been praised as revolutionary, critics have said progress is slow with NADB; it failed to fund a single infrastructure project within a year of its creation, despite the approval of several projects by BECC. These programs have been criticized for failing to consider who will pay to maintain the completed infrastructure. Because BECC is not a regulatory agency, its decisions are not enforceable. Critics of BECC/NADB have suggested the implementation of punitive measures such as monetary penalties to complement the system of incentives currently in place. U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development The Crantston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990 was created to help families that did not own homes to make down-payments for purchasing homes, expand on the supply of affordable housing for low-income families, and promote cooperation between all levels of government and the private sector in this expansion.Warren, G. (1990). Lamont, Summary of Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act. Housing and Development Reporter, 580-609. The Act is considered one of the most-important policies relating to U.S. colonias for setting aside funds from the Community Development Block Grant Program (CDBG) to go directly towards enhancing their living standards, and bringing to the public an awareness of colonias in California, Arizona, and New Mexico. These CDBG funds are particularly used to improve potable water, sewer systems, and sanitary housing in the colonias. The Act is credited for inspiring other agencies, such as the EPA, to fund programs targeting development on the Mexico‚ÄìU.S. border. Critics have stated that HUD's focus has been on preventing the development of colonias rather than seeking to provide those of low-income with a larger supply of affordable housing. As is the case with BECC/NADB, critics have also claimed that the projects seeking to improve infrastructure have been underwhelming. Scholars have urged the HUD to make use of its ability to work with the private sector by encouraging private investment in the direct development of the current colonias. Rather than eliminating the colonias, many have proposed to instead have the private sector create better dwellings at low costs within the area while also improving the already-established dwellings. Advocacy groups Housing and community advocacy organizations work to alleviate poverty in colonias by promoting self-help housing programs that provide colonia residents with resources to build their own homes, fostering community empowerment and raising public awareness. These groups include the Texas Low Income Housing Information Service (TxLIHIS), an affordable-housing-advocacy nonprofit organization,Home and the Colonias Development Council in New Mexico.Colonias Development Council - Welcome / Concilio para el Desarrollo de las Colonias - Bienvenidos See also *Hidden America: Life in the Colonias ABC News *Pueblos j√≥venes, the vast shantytowns of Lima, Peru * Favela, Brazilian shantytowns or slums, primarily in Rio de Janeiro. * Corti√ßo in Brazil and Portugal, a poor urban area. *Maquiladora, manufacturing operation in free trade zone.

He was educated at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1943 and attended the Illinois Institute of Technology from 1947 to 1949. He set up his own studio in Chicago in 1952. The Art Institute of Chicago had an exhibit of his work in 1969.The Art Institute of Chicago, \\"Skrebneski,\\" (1969, Ridge Press). Skrebneski is most known for his fashion photography and his work for the ad campaigns of Estee Lauder, Inc., notably his fifteen-year collaboration (1970-1985) with model Karen Graham creating the portrait portfolio marketing campaign known as 'The Estee Lauder Woman.' The longevity and format of this campaign make it unique in the annals of marketing. A single portrait of Graham was placed in fashion magazines each month depicting an element in the idealized life of 'The Estee Lauder Woman,' often photographed in black and white, an unusual medium for cosmetics, fragrance, and skin care product lines, which commonly rely upon the visual impact of color photography. The focus on this one theme produced approximately 180 portraits of Graham, each remarkably individual yet highly recognizable, an accomplishment few photographers or promotional efforts can be said to have achieved. Their collaboration concluded amicably when Graham retired from the modelling profession. Skrebneski also photographed various celebrities, including Cindy Crawford (whose first notable photos he took), Oprah Winfrey, Audrey Hepburn, Diana Ross, Hubert de Givenchy, Diahann Carroll and Fran√ßois Truffaut. He created numerous other ad campaigns. Skrebneski's black-and-white poster images shot for the Chicago International Film Festival often featured nude models and have become collectible over the years. Skrebneski died of cancer in Chicago on April 4, 2020.

The railway was established in 1978. Founded by Raymond Catts He advertised for interested persons to form a club for the display and use of models, it took from 1978 until 1980 to get the numbers to start a Technical Education course in workshop practice which was in fitting and machining, from this course the numbers grew and land was found to establish what is to-day. It is operated by the Wagga Wagga Society of Model Engineers. It includes 3 km of a combined 7 1/4 inch and 5 inch track, two stations, two tunnels, three bridges, four buildings, 6 locomotives owned by the club and a number of personally owned locomotives. An annual Invitational Run has been held every year since 1988 on the first weekend of November. Miniature trains from all over Australia converged here for two days of train running. Traditionally, the Saturday is for club members only and the Sunday event is open for public running. The first 24-hour run, called Railway for Life, was held 15‚Äì16 September 2007 in aid of the Cancer Council. There are currently three routes in use. The main line which is a shorter route that runs within the boundaries of the botanical gardens itself. The museum line which takes the trains under Lord Baden Powell Drive over to the loop next to Museum of the Riverina car park. The spiral line which runs around a spiral and then returns via either the museum line or the main line. A new addition to the club is a new locomotive, The T387 which was purchased from Adelaide for $28,000.00. This locomotive had its maiden run on the tracks in October 2018.

The airport is operated by the Civil Aviation Authority, Bangladesh (CAAB) and is served by Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the national airline, which at one point earned most of its revenue from this airport. Private airlines Novoair and US-Bangla Airlines operate domestic flights to Dhaka. The majority of passengers using this airport are expatriate Bangladeshis and their descendants living in the United Kingdom, who are originally from the Sylhet Division of Bangladesh.  History  Apron view Interior view Osmani International Airport was built during British rule of the Indian Subcontinent, partly to check Japanese aggression from Burma. The airport was formerly known as Sylhet Civil Airport but was renamed after General M A G Osmani, Commander in Chief of Independence War of Bangladesh as well as of Muktijuddho in 1971. The airport was initially served by domestic flights from Shahjalal International Airport by the country's national airline Biman Bangladesh Airlines. After many years of lobbying by expatriates living in the UK, limited expansion of the airport was carried out to enable medium- sized aircraft, such as the Airbus A310 used by Biman, to operate. The work was completed in October 2002 and the airport was designated an international airport by the government. However, the airport was not up to international standards to be capable of fully accommodating international flights due to many shortcomings with the instrument landing system and runway lighting system, and the designation was seen as a move to stave off pressure by the government. Nevertheless, on 3 November 2002, the airport received its first international arrival. Biman flight BG020 from Kuwait via Abu Dhabi landed at 10:05 with 215 passengers en route to Dhaka. The disembarking passengers on the inaugural flight were greeted by then Finance & Planning Minister, M Saifur Rahman and State Minister for Civil Aviation and Tourism, Mir Mohammad Nasiruddin. For a brief period, Biman also operated a direct service from London but was later re-routed via Dhaka. Additional expansion of the runway and improvements to the runway lighting and airport facilities were commenced in 2004 to enable wide-bodied aircraft to safely land and takeoff from the airport. The South Asia Transport and Trade Facilitation Conference report of 2006 (by the United States Trade and Development Agency) noted that the development of the airport \\"up to the standards of [an] international airport\\" to \\"encourage private sector participation in air transport\\" were projects that were under consideration by the government. Work started in 2006 to upgrade the terminal facilities to enable handling of international flights. The improvements include construction of a new terminal building, two Jetways and a taxi-way. In May 2007, the foreign affairs adviser, informed journalists that the works were on scheduled for completion in June 2007. He also confirmed that Biman will be operating Hajj flights directly from the airport during the Hajj season later in 2007. However, the runway expansion works had not been completed in June with the foreign affairs adviser indicating in August that \\"minor dressing work\\" still remained. The work was finally finished in December 2008. In 2010 the decision was made to construct a refueling station. Construction work began in January 2012. In January 2014 the Project Director Aminul Haq stated that the project was 70% complete. On 1 April 2015, Flydubai resumed foreign airline service to Sylhet with its flight from Dubai‚ÄìInternational. Flydubai's introduction of nonstop flights from Dubai became the first international flights to Sylhet since the airport's \\"international\\" designation 18 years prior. The service was operated through a codeshare agreement with Bangladeshi airline Regent Airways. However, because Biman Bangladesh Airlines had refused to provide ground handling services, the route was cancelled the next day. Stranded passengers held a demonstration in response on 6 April 2015. On November 2016, Flydubai decided to start its flight again from Sylhet to the Middle East. This flight was ended on 7 September 2018 Expansion and development Currently there are no direct outbound international flights available from the airport for not having sufficient facilities available. Only a few inbound international flights to Dhaka makes a stopover at the airport. This anomaly should be rectified after a 2 years' long upgradation project of Sylhet airport at a cost of BDT . This includes strengthening of the runway and taxiway for heavy takeoff weight. In April 2020, a Chinese company, namely Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) was appointed to construct a new terminal building including a cargo building, a modern equipped ATC tower, taxiway, apron and aa modern fire station of the airport at a cost of . Post completion of the new terminal building the passenger capacity of the airport will be upgraded to 2 million per annum from the current capacity of 6 lakh per annum.There will be six boarding bridges and thirty six check in counters in the new terminal building. Airlines and destinations =Passenger= Biman Bangladesh Airlines operates some domestic services between Sylhet and Dhaka which arrive from international destinations such as Jeddah, Abu Dhabi, Manchester, Muscat and London‚ÄìHeathrow thus providing a direct inbound only service to Sylhet from those cities. Outbound from Sylhet to those cities involve a domestic flight to Dhaka and continuing on using an international one. However, Biman's only direct international flight to Dubai‚ÄìInternational from Sylhet was also suspended on 25 October 2019, due to the renovation work at the airport, only one and a half years after it started operation. =Cargo= Accidents and incidents * On 22 December 1997, Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG-609 carrying 85 passengers and 4 crew, operated by a Fokker F28-4000, crashed onto a paddy field 5.6 kilometres from the foot of the runway in heavy fog, on final approach from Dhaka. 17 passengers were injured. * On 8 October 2004, Biman Bangladesh Airlines flight BG-601 carrying 79 passengers and 4 crew, operated by a Fokker F28-4000, inbound from Dhaka overran the wet runway and ended up in a ditch.

Marx: The First International and After p. 347 The principle refers to free access to and distribution of goods, capital and services. In the Marxist view, such an arrangement will be made possible by the abundance of goods and services that a developed communist system will be capable to produce; the idea is that, with the full development of socialism and unfettered productive forces, there will be enough to satisfy everyone's needs. Origin of the phrase The complete paragraph containing Marx's statement of the creed in the Critique of the Gotha Program is as follows: Although Marx is popularly thought of as the originator of the phrase, the slogan was common within the socialist movement. For example, August Becker in 1844 described it as the basic principle of communismWas wollen die Kommunisten, 1844, p. 34. and Louis Blanc used it in 1851.Louis Blanc, Plus de Girondins, 1851, p. 92. The origin of this phrasing has also been attributed to the French utopian √âtienne-Gabriel Morelly,Norman E. Bowie, Towards a new theory of distributive justice (1971), p. 82. who proposed in his 1755 Code of Nature \\"Sacred and Fundamental Laws that would tear out the roots of vice and of all the evils of a society\\", including:Gregory Titelman, Random House dictionary of popular proverbs & sayings (1996), p. 108. A similar phrase can be found in the Guilford Covenant in 1639: Some scholars trace the phrase to the New Testament.Joseph Arthur Baird, The Greed Syndrome: An Ethical Sickness in American Capitalism (1989), p. 32.Marshall Berman, Adventures in Marxism (2000), p. 151. In Acts of the Apostles the lifestyle of the community of believers in Jerusalem is described as communal (without individual possession), and uses the phrase \\"distribution was made unto every man according as he had need\\" (): Other scholars find its origins in \\"the Roman legal concept of obligation in solidum\\", James Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction-Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 113. in which \\"everyone assumes responsibility for anyone who cannot pay his debt, and he is conversely responsible for everyone else\\".Hauke Brunkhorst, Solidarity: From Civic Friendship to a Global Legal Community, MIT Press 2005, p. 2 James Furner argues: > If x = a disadvantage, and y = action to redress that disadvantage, the > principle of solidarity is: if any member of a group acquires x, each member > has a duty to perform y (if they can assist). All we then need to add, to > get to the fundamental principle of developed communism, is to assume that > non-satisfaction of a need is a disadvantage. The corresponding principle of > solidarity in respect of need says: if any member of society has an > unsatisfied need, each member has a duty to produce its object (if they > can). But that is precisely what the principle 'from each according to their > abilities, to each according to their needs!' dictates. In Marx's vision, > the basic principle of developed communism is a principle of solidarity in > respect of need. James Furner, Marx on Capitalism: The Interaction- > Recognition-Antinomy Thesis, Brill 2018, p. 113 Debates on the idea Marx delineated the specific conditions under which such a creed would be applicable‚Äîa society where technology and social organization had substantially eliminated the need for physical labor in the production of things, where \\"labor has become not only a means of life but life's prime want\\".Part 1, Critique of the Gotha Programme, https://www.marxists.org, quoting Marx/Engels Selected Works, Volume Three, p. 13-30. Marx explained his belief that, in such a society, each person would be motivated to work for the good of society despite the absence of a social mechanism compelling them to work, because work would have become a pleasurable and creative activity. Marx intended the initial part of his slogan, \\"from each according to his ability\\" to suggest not merely that each person should work as hard as they can, but that each person should best develop their particular talents. Claiming themselves to be at a \\"lower stage of communism\\" (i.e. \\"socialism\\", in line with Vladimir Lenin‚Äôs terminology), the Soviet Union adapted the formula as: \\"From each according to his ability, to each according to his work (labour investment)\\". This was incorporated in Article 12 of the 1936 Constitution of the Soviet Union, but described by Leon Trotsky as \\"This inwardly contradictory, not to say nonsensical, formula\\". Trotsky, Leon The Revolution Betrayed Chapter 10 section 1 While liberation theology has sought to interpret the Christian call for justice in a way that is in harmony with this Marxist dictum, many have noted that Jesus' teaching in the Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14‚Äì30) affirms only \\"TO each according to his ability\\" (Matt. 25:15), and not \\"FROM each according to his ability\\". In popular culture  In Ayn Rand's 1957 novel Atlas Shrugged, a large and profitable motor company adopted this slogan as its method for determining employee compensation. The system quickly fell prey to corruption and greed, forcing the most capable employees to work overtime in order to satisfy the needs of the least competent and to funnel money to the owners. As a result, the company went bankrupt within four years. In Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel The Handmaid's Tale, members of a dystopian society recited the phrase thrice daily. Notably the phrase is altered to read \\"From each according to her ability; to each according to his need,\\" demonstrating a perversion of the phrase's original intention by Atwood's fictional society. In Vladimir Voinovich's 1986 novel Moscow 2042, the slogan was parodied in the context of \\"communism in one city\\". Every morning the radio announced: \\"Comrades, your needs for today are as follows: ...\\".

Birth and education Born in Ballarat, Victoria, Longstaff was educated at Grenville College, Ballarat, studying art at the Ballarat School of Mines and privately before joining the military and serving in the Boer War as a member of the South African Light Horse. He was the cousin of portrait painter Sir John Longstaff. Career and the First World War Upon returning to Australia, Longstaff continued to paint and teach art. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force at the outbreak of the First World War and was injured in the Gallipoli campaign. In October 1915 he joined a remount unit and served in France and Egypt before being evacuated to England in 1917. In England, he began drawing again and was trained in the art of camouflage. During his time in Egypt, Longstaff had made images of the ANZAC Mounted Division and the other units. Upon his appointment as an Official War Artist in 1918 he produced numerous works during the final campaigns of the Western Front. After the First World War After the war, Longstaff continued his art, turning many of his sketches into paintings. Even after leaving the military, he remained in England, eventually settling in Sussex. Beginning the late 1920s, he made return trips to the battlefields of Belgium and France and painted haunting images in a spiritualist style. Among these later works is Menin Gate at Midnight (1927), arguably his most famous, which depicts the ghostly figures of soldiers marching past the monument.Inglis, Kenneth et al. (2001).

In early Buddhist literature, sacca is often found in the context of the \\"Four Noble Truths\\", a crystallization of Buddhist wisdom. In addition, sacca is one of the ten pƒÅramitƒÅs or \\"most high\\" a bodhisatta must develop in order to become a Buddha.  The profoundest truth of reality  In the Pali Canon, sacca is frequently found in the term ariya-sacca, meaning \\"noble truth\\" or \\"truth of the noble ones\\".See, for instance, Harvey (2007), in his \\"Glossary and Commentary\\" section's explanation of \\"Reality for the Noble One(s) (or, for the Noble One(s), a reality)\\". More specifically, the term ariya-sacca refers to the Buddha's \\"Four Noble Truths,\\" elucidated in his first discourse as follows (where sacca is translated as \\"reality\\"): > Now this, bhikkhus, is the Truth about pain: birth is painful, aging is > painful, illness is painful, death is painful; sorrow, lamentation, physical > pain, unhappiness and distress are painful; union with what is disliked is > painful; separation from what is liked is painful; not to get what one wants > is painful; in brief, the five bundles of grasping-fuel are painful. Now > this, bhikkhus, is the Truth about that which causes pain: It is this > craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and > attachment, seeking delight now here now there; that is, craving for sense- > pleasures, craving for existence, craving for extermination (of what is not > liked). Now this, bhikkhus, is the Truth about that which can put an end to > pain. It is the remainderless fading away and cessation of that same > craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non- > reliance on it. Now this, bhikkhus, is the Truth about that which is the way > leading to the cessation of pain. It is this Noble Eight-factored Path, that > is to say, right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right > livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right mental unification.Harvey > (2007). In the Pali literature, these Four Noble Truths are often identified as the most common idea associated with the Noble Eightfold Path's factor of \\"right view\\" or \\"right understanding\\". And in the Buddhist causal notion of Dependent Origination, ignorance of these Four Noble Truths is often identified as the starting point for \\"the whole mass of suffering\\" (kevalassa dukkhakkhandha).  Truth as an ethical practice  In terms of the daily practice of Buddhist laity, a lay devotee daily recites the Five Precepts which include: > I undertake the precept to refrain from incorrect speech.Bullitt (2005). \\"Incorrect speech\\", at its most basic, reflects speaking truthfully. Regarding this, contemporary Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi has written: > It is said that in the course of his long training for enlightenment over > many lives, a bodhisatta can break all the moral precepts except the pledge > to speak the truth. The reason for this is very profound, and reveals that > the commitment to truth has a significance transcending the domain of ethics > and even mental purification, taking us to the domains of knowledge and > being. Truthful speech provides, in the sphere of interpersonal > communication, a parallel to wisdom in the sphere of private understanding. > The two are respectively the outward and inward modalities of the same > commitment to what is real. Wisdom consists in the realization of truth, and > truth (sacca) is not just a verbal proposition but the nature of things as > they are. To realize truth our whole being has to be brought into accord > with actuality, with things as they are, which requires that in > communications with others we respect things as they are by speaking the > truth. Truthful speech establishes a correspondence between our own inner > being and the real nature of phenomena, allowing wisdom to rise up and > fathom their real nature. Thus, much more than an ethical principle, > devotion to truthful speech is a matter of taking our stand on reality > rather than illusion, on the truth grasped by wisdom rather than the > fantasies woven by desire.Bodhi (1999), ch. 4.

The station airs a talk radio format and is owned by Entercom Communications. WSKY carries a local weekday morning talk and information show, followed by nationally syndicated talk programs. They include Brian Kilmeade, Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Mark Levin, Ben Shapiro, Coast to Coast AM with George Noory and This Morning, America's First News with Gordon Deal. Weekends feature shows on money, health, real estate, law, gardening, horses, computers and cigars, some of which are paid brokered programming. Hosts include Kim Komando, Bill Handel, Clark Howard and Bill Cunningham. Most hours begin with world and national news from ABC Radio News.  History  On September 7, 1985, the station first signed on at 97.7 FM as WGLV, an adult contemporary music station known as \\"Gainesville's Love 98.\\" WGLV was co-owned with AM 1230 WGGG, a longtime legendary Top 40 station in the market, and tried to take advantage of the connection by hiring legendary WGGG personality \\"Boomer\\" Hough as its first morning show host. However, Hough's show lasted only a few months. WGLV tried to further bank on the legendary WGGG call sign in 1987 by adopting a 1970s-based oldies format as WGGG-FM and declaring \\"The Legend is Back!\\"Broadcasting Yearbook 1987 page B-62 This, too, proved short-lived. After WGGG-AM-FM were sold in 1989, WGGG-FM became WLCL, a soft AC station branded as \\"Clear FM\\". From 1993 until the debut of WSKY in 1998 (except for a brief period during which it programmed oldies as WGGO \\"Go 97.7\\"), the station was known as WRRX \\"97-X\\". At that time, the station featured an adult album alternative format which was partially programmed via satellite from an outside provider, and locally in certain dayparts, featuring an eclectic variety of music. 97-X had a small yet loyal following in the local Gainesville music scene. 97-X was sold to Entercom in March 1998, for a price tag of $2.8 million.Broadcasting Yearbook 1999 page D-95 Entercom switched the call letters to WSKY-FM and changed frequencies to 97.3 MHz on June 7, 1998, boosting the signal to 13,500 watts from its previous 2,600 watts. The antenna height was nearly doubled to 948 feet from its previous 495-foot tower. This gave WSKY better coverage of the Gainesville-Ocala radio market, putting a high-quality signal over both cities. The station also switched to its current talk radio format. WSKY has since boosted its power to 50,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP) but reduced its height above average terrain (HAAT) to 492 feet.  Awards  WSKY was given an award for its news reporting during the 2004 hurricane season, which hit WSKY's broadcast area especially hard.

A professional writer since the age of nineteen, she achieved lasting fame at forty-one with the 1922 publication of the classic that is her best-known work, The Velveteen Rabbit (1922). She received the Newbery Honor for Winterbound. Early life and writing philosophy Margery Winifred Williams was born in London, the second daughter of a noted barrister and a renowned classical scholar. She and her sister were encouraged by her father, whom she remembered as a deeply loving and caring parent, to read and use their imaginations.\\"Margery Williams Bianco\\", Pennsylvania Center for the Book, PSU Writing about her childhood many years later, she recalled how vividly her father described characters from various books and the infinite world of knowledge and adventure that lay on the printed page. She noted that the desire to read, which soon transformed into a need to write, was a legacy from her father that would be hers for a lifetime. When Margery was seven years old, her father died suddenly, a life-changing event which, in one way or another, would affect all of her future creative activity. The undertone of sadness and the themes of death and loss that flow through her children's books have been criticised by some reviewers, but Williams always maintained that hearts acquire greater humanity through pain and adversity. She wrote that life is a process of constant change‚Äîthere are departures for some and arrivals for others‚Äîand the process allows us to grow and persevere. In 1890 Margery moved with her family to the United States. A year later they moved to a rural Pennsylvania farming community. Over the succeeding years, until 1898, Margery was a student at the Convent School in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania. Her ambition to make a living as an author propelled her in 1901, at the age of nineteen, to return to her birthplace and submit to a London publisher her first novel, The Late Returning, which was published in 1902 and aimed at an adult audience. It did not sell well and neither did her subsequent novels, The Price of Youth, and The Bar.\\"Margery Williams\\", PoemHunter.com Marriage, children and the influence of Walter de la Mare's writings While visiting her publisher, Margery Williams met Francesco Bianco, an Italian living in London, who was employed as the manager of one of the book departments. They were married in 1904 and became the parents of a son, Cecco and a daughter, Pamela. Pamela was a renowned child artist who had a showing in Turin at the age of eleven. Her fame brought the Bianco family to New York and (with the exception of Cecco) they lived in the Greenwich Village area until the end of their lives. Pamela illustrated some of her mother's books, including The Skin Horse and The Little Wooden Doll. When her children were young, Margery considered motherhood a full-time job, and her writing efforts were curtailed. In 1907 the family left England, heading first to Paris, where Francesco was head of the rare books department at Brentano's. They later settled in Turin, Italy. In August 1914 Italy, along with the rest of Europe, was plunged into World War I and Francesco Bianco joined the Italian Army. While remaining home with the children, Margery Bianco gained hope and inspiration from the works of the poet she called her \\"spiritual mentor\\", Walter de la Mare, who she felt truly understood the mindset of children. In 1914, Williams wrote a horror novel, The Thing in the Woods, about a werewolf in the Pennsylvania region. It was later republished in the US in a slightly revised version under the pseudonym Harper Williams. Dziemianowicz, Stefan. \\"Curiosities:The Thing in the Woods by Harper Williams (1924) Fantasy and Science Fiction, August 2000. The Thing in the Woods was known to H. P. Lovecraft, and some commentators think it may have influenced his \\"The Dunwich Horror\\". He also wrote a poem entitled \\"On The Thing in the Woods by Harper Williams.\\" H. P. Lovecraft, The Ancient Track: The Complete Poetical Works of H. P. Lovecraft. Edited by S. T. Joshi. NY: Hippocampus Press, 2013, p. 72. Return to America and The Velveteen Rabbit At the end of 1918 the Great War had ended, but postwar hunger and deprivation became a problem in Europe. In 1921, Bianco, along with her family, returned to the United States and settled in Greenwich Village. Inspired by the innocence and playful imagination of her children, as well as the inspiration she felt from the magic and mysticism contained in the works of Walter de la Mare, she decided to resume her writing, and gained almost immediate celebrity. The Velveteen Rabbit or How Toys Become Real was Margery Williams Bianco's first American work, and it remains her most famous.\\"Margery Williams\\", Penguin Random House It has remained a classic piece of literature through numerous adaptations in children's theatre as well as on radio, television and in the movies. The author's trademark undercurrents of sentimentality and sadness persist in the tale of a small boy who finds a velveteen rabbit in his Christmas stocking. In the nursery the rabbit is looked down on by the fancier wind up toys. He asks the skin horse, \\"What is Real?\\" The skin horse tells him, \\"When a child loves you for a long, long time, not just to play with, but REALLY loves you, then you become Real.\\" The boy comes to adore the rabbit, and they are constant companions. This happy existence continues until the boy contracts scarlet fever. The rabbit stays with him, whispering to him of the games they will play again when he is better. As the boy gets better his family prepares to take him to the seaside. Although the rabbit looks forward to the seaside very much, the doctor insists he be thrown out and burned along with the other toys that may be infected. While the rabbit is waiting to be burned, he cries a real tear, from which a fairy emerges. The fairy tells the rabbit that he was real to the boy, because the boy loved him, but now she will make him truly real. Later, the boy sees a real rabbit in the garden. He thinks it looks like his old rabbit, but he does not know that it really is the velveteen rabbit he once loved. Successful author of children's books Bianco wrote numerous other children's books, with her son becoming the namesake of one of them, 1925's Poor Cecco: The Wonderful Story of a Wonderful Wooden Dog Who Was the Jolliest Toy in the House Until He Went Out to Explore the World, about the interactions of children's toys with each other and with the human, animal, and toy members of the world beyond the toy cupboard. A return to more sober themes marks Bianco's other popular works, such as the same year's The Little Wooden Doll, illustrated by her daughter Pamela, in which the title character is badly mistreated by some children, but shown love and compassion by another child, which made her whole again. Each year, for the remaining two decades of her life, Bianco produced numerous books and short stories. Most of them continued her preoccupation with toys coming to life and the ability of inanimate objects and animals to express human emotions and feelings. There was always melancholy, but in the end the reader emerged spiritually uplifted. 1926's The Apple Tree and The Adventures of Andy, 1927's The Skin Horse, also illustrated by Pamela, 1929's The Candlestick, 1930's Other People's Houses and 1931's The House that Grew Smaller are among some of her works from that period. Final years In her final nine years, Bianco interspersed children's books with novels for young adults. These all featured young people who were in one way or another isolated or alienated from mainstream society and the joy, success, prosperity and social acceptance seemingly enjoyed by their peers. One of those books, Winterbound, about two girls, still in their teenage years, who are called upon to assume adult responsibilities in caring for their young siblings, when the parents have to go away suddenly, was a runner-up for the 1937 Newbery Medal showcasing excellence in youth literature. In 1971, upon the establishment of the Newbery Honor, the work was retroactively distinguished with that prestigious citation. In 1939, as her native Britain entered World War II, Bianco began to include patriotic themes and references to European history in her works, such as 1941's Franzi and Gizi. Her final book, 1944's Forward Commandos!, was an inspirational story of wartime heroism, which included as one of its characters a black soldier. Acknowledging the contribution of African-Americans to the war effort was extremely rare in literary output of the time and that fact was noted in the book's reviews. Margery Williams Bianco did not live to see World War II end. As Forward Commandos! went on sale, she became ill and, after three days in hospital, died at the age of 63.

These include mines designed to self-destruct or self-deactivate at the end of a conflict, and mines designed to re-deploy themselves if its neighbors detonate or are removed. The development of smart mines began as a response to the International Campaign to Ban Landmines as a way of reducing non-combatant and civilian injury. Critics claim that new technology is unreliable, and that the perception of a \\"safe mine\\" will lead to increased deployment of land mines in future conflicts. Current guidelines allow for a 10% failure rate, leaving a significant number of mines to pose a threat. Additionally, in the case of self-destructing mines, civilians still are at risk of injury when the mine self-destructs and are denied access to land which has been mined. As mines are inherently non-discriminate weapons even smart mines may injure civilians during a time of war. Many critics believe this to be unacceptable under international law. The human security paradigm is outspoken on the issue of the reduction in the use of land mines due to the extremely individual nature of their impact - a facet that is ignored by traditional security concerns which focus on military and state level security issues.

They give a general idea of how precise a measurement is, or conversely, how far from the reported value the true (error free) value might be. Error bars often represent one standard deviation of uncertainty, one standard error, or a particular confidence interval (e.g., a 95% interval). These quantities are not the same and so the measure selected should be stated explicitly in the graph or supporting text. Error bars can be used to compare visually two quantities if various other conditions hold. This can determine whether differences are statistically significant. Error bars can also suggest goodness of fit of a given function, i.e., how well the function describes the data. Scientific papers in the experimental sciences are expected to include error bars on all graphs, though the practice differs somewhat between sciences, and each journal will have its own house style. It has also been shown that error bars can be used as a direct manipulation interface for controlling probabilistic algorithms for approximate computation. Error bars can also be expressed in a plus-minus sign (¬±), plus the upper limit of the error and minus the lower limit of the error..

They can be defined in traditional, Linnaean terms, in which case they are a suborder of synapsids that lived from the Middle Permian to the Middle Cretaceous, or in cladistic terms, in which case they include not only the traditional theriodonts but also their descendants the mammals as well (in the same way that, cladistically speaking, the theropod dinosaurs include the birds as a sub- clade). Naming In 1876, Richard Owen named a suborder Theriodontia, which he divided into the Cynodontia and the Gomphodontia.Owen, R. 1876. Descriptive and illustrated catalogue of the fossil Reptilia of South Africa in the collection of the British Museum. London. Taylor and Francis. 88 pp The modern clade concept was devised by James Allen Hopson. In his system, Theriodontia fall into two main groups: the Gorgonopsia and the Eutheriodontia. The latter consist of the Therocephalia and Cynodontia.J.A. Hopson. 1999. \\"Therapsids\\". Encyclopedia of Paleontology 2: 1256-1266 Evolution Theriodonts appeared at the same time as their sister group within the Neotherapsida, the Anomodontia, about 265 million years ago, in the Middle Permian. Even these early theriodonts were more mammal-like than their anomodont and dinocephalian contemporaries. Scylacosaurus. Early theriodonts may have been warm-blooded. Early forms were carnivorous, but several later groups became herbivorous during the Triassic. Theriodont jaws were more mammal-like than was the case of other therapsids, because their dentary was larger, which gave them more efficient chewing ability. Furthermore, several other bones that were on the lower jaw (found in reptiles), moved into the ears, allowing the theriodonts to hear better and their mouths to open wider. This made the theriodonts the most successful group of synapsids. =Eutheriodontia= Eutheriodontia refers to all theriodonts except the gorgonopsians (the most \\"primitive\\" group). They included the therocephalians and the cynodonts. The cynodonts include the mammals. The eutheriodonts have larger skulls, accommodating larger brains and improved jaw muscles. The eutheriodontian theriodonts are one of the two synapsid survivors of the great Permian‚ÄìTriassic extinction event, the other being the dicynodonts. Therocephalians included both carnivorous and herbivorous forms; both died out after the Early Triassic. The remaining theriodonts, the cynodonts, also included carnivores, such as Cynognathus, as well as newly evolved herbivores (Traversodontidae). While traversodontids for the most part remained medium-sized to reasonably large (the length of the largest species was up to two meters), the carnivorous forms became progressively smaller as the Triassic progressed. They \\"miniaturised\\". By the Late Triassic, the small cynodonts included the rodent-like Tritylodontidae (possibly related to or descended from traversodontids), and the tiny, shrew- like, Trithelodontidae, related to the Mammaliaformes. The trithelodontids died out during the Jurassic, and the tritylodontids survived into the Cretaceous, but their relatives, the mammals, continued to evolve. Many mammal groups managed to survive the Cretaceous‚ÄìPaleogene extinction event, which wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs, allowing the mammals to diversify and dominate the Earth.

He retired in January 2015 after 10 years as the Treasurer of Santa Cruz County http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/article/NE/20150105/NEWS/150109871. Early life and career Keeley was born in Sacramento, California. He is the second son of Harry and Elizabeth Keeley. He was raised in San Jose. He attended and graduated from Cupertino High School in 1969. He attended DeAnza College in the early 1970s and took film classes from Professor Robert Scott. In 1974, Keeley graduated with honors from San Jose State University, School of Social Sciences. After working for Law Enforcement Training and Research Associates, he was selected by Santa Cruz County Supervisor Joe Cucchaira to be Cucchaira's policy director. Keeley served in that capacity until March 1984 when then-Assembly Member Sam Farr (D-Carmel) hired Keeley to be his chief of staff. Keeley served in that capacity for nearly five years. Keeley served for eight years as a member of the Santa Cruz County Board of Supervisors, prior to his election to the California Assembly. Assembly member =1996 Assembly race= Moderate Republican Bruce McPherson's decision to run for California Senate District 15 made California Assembly District 27 an open seat. In March 1996, Keeley ran for the Democratic nomination for the 27th Assembly District against Karin Kauffman. Keeley won over 55% of the party's Democratic voters, and 33% of all votes cast. In the November general election, Keeley won about 57% of all votes cast against Republican Jim Davis. =First term= During his first term in the Assembly, Keeley chaired the Budget Subcommittee on Resources, where he advanced legislation, known as the Marine Life Management Act of 1998. Also in 1998, Keeley was selected by Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa to be Speaker pro Tempore. This is the highest-ranking member of the Speaker's leadership team and, as such, Keeley was responsible for the development of the majority party's important policy initiatives. Keeley also investigated the actions of then-Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. As a result of the investigation, Quackenbush resigned his office. During this time, Keeley also authored the two largest park and environmental protection bonds in the nation's history, Proposition 12 on the California ballot in March 2000, and Proposition 40 on the California ballot in March 2002. Together, these voter-approved bonds provided $4.7 billion for environmental protection, park land and other valuable habitat land acquisition throughout the nation's most populated state. =California electricity crisis= In late 2000 and early 2001, the California electricity crisis manifested itself with rolling blackouts in many parts of the state. Speaker Robert Hertzberg appointed Keeley, his Speaker pro Tempore, as \\"chief operating officer\\" for the Assembly on the energy crisis. This position had three primary duties: to establish a triage system for dealing with day-to-day, minute-to-minute emergencies that were direct outgrowths of the lack of electricity; to form a policy group, both at the staff and legislator level, to sort out those ideas that were being advanced to solve the problem, and make recommendations to the Speaker and the Governor, on how to tackle the many fronts on which this crisis was expanding; and to be the author of the agreed-upon package of legislation that would try to tame the energy crisis monster. During the energy crisis, a variety of options were under consideration. The State of California was trying to get the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to cap the wholesale price of electricity, as that price was far exceeding the statutory limit that regulated utilities in California could charge their retail customers. The wholesale price was far in excess of the retail price because of deregulation. When the legislature deregulated the electricity sector in 1996, it did so by taking a number of statutory actions. One was to create a Power Exchange or PX. This was intended to be the trading floor for buyers and sellers of electricity. Keeley believed that the model was seriously flawed because it assumed that electricity could be treated as a commodity. Commodities markets have several features: Many buyers, many sellers, transparent transactions, substitute products, and the ability of the buyer to withhold buying if the price is not to his or her liking. According to Keeley, the PX had none of these features. In order to stabilize prices, and to assure a reliable supply of electricity, Keeley became the author of the State of California's solution so California participate in the market by buying the so-called net short position each day, and to sell that electricity to utility customers. While there was much criticism of the strategy at the time, it is clear that it had the desired effect: to wit, it stabilized prices and assured supply. PG&E;'s solution included the transfer of watershed lands and the creation of a youth stewardship program. After the energy crisis, the California faced a massive budget deficit. Keeley helped in the budget negotiations between Democrats and Republicans to get the necessary 2/3 vote to pass the state budget compromise on the state budget. Later career =2003-2004= Due to term limits, Keeley left the Assembly in December 2002. Then-Governor Gray Davis asked Keeley to join his cabinet as Director of the California Department of Finance. Keeley declined, and instead became Executive Director of the Planning and Conservation League and the PCL Foundation. These two non-profit organizations specialize in environmental research and legislative advocacy. Keeley led these two organizations for two years. =Role in higher education= When Keeley was termed out of the legislature, the University of California, Santa Cruz established a perpetual environmental lecture series in his honor, known as the Fred Keeley Lectures on the Environment. The initial lecture was given by former Arizona Governor and Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt. In 2005, the lecture was given by Dr. Paul Erlich of Stanford University, and author of the best selling book The Population Bomb. Keeley also made a planned gift of $250,000 to UCSC to support the campus's STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research. Since Fall 2006, Keeley has taught courses as a part-time faculty member in the Department of Political Science at San Jose State University. He has taught State Politics and Legislative Politics, and is scheduled to teach Local Politics in Fall 2007. Keeley is a frequent lecturer on California state government, politics, and a variety of environmental topics at Stanford University, the University of California at Santa Cruz, Duke University, San Jose State University, California State University at Monterey Bay, the University of Southern California, and the University of California, Berkeley. Most recently, he has been teaching at Pacific Collegiate School as the Local and State Government and Politics instructor. =Return to local politics= In January 2005, Keeley returned to Santa Cruz and became Santa Cruz County Treasurer. While this position is a countywide elected position, Keeley was appointed by the Board of Supervisors to fill an unexpired term. On June 6, 2006, Keeley was elected to a four-year term as Treasurer. In addition to his work as Treasurer, Keeley is a Member of the Board of Directors of the California League of Conservation Voters, the state's premiere environmental political action organization. He also serves on the Board of Directors of Planned Parenthood Advocates for California and Nevada and is the current Board Vice President of Sempervirens Fund, originally established in 1900 as Sempervirens Club, California's oldest land conservation organization. Additionally, he serves on the board of directors of the California Ocean Science Trust. Keeley is co-chair of the Voices of Reform Project of the Commonwealth Club of California. This project is focused on five major areas of governmental reform: Redistricting, Term Limits, Campaign Finance, Budget, and Initiative Reform. The other co-chair is Dan Shnur, former Governor Pete Wilson's communications director. The Voices of Reform Project includes some three hundred civic leaders from throughout the California.

Its southern terminus is at an intersection with NY 21 in the hamlet of Bristol Springs within the town of South Bristol, Ontario County. The northern terminus is at a junction with NY 96 and NY 252 in the village of Pittsford, Monroe County. NY 64 is a mostly two-lane highway that primarily serves as a connector between the southeastern suburbs of the city of Rochester and the Canandaigua Lake area, home to Bristol Mountain Ski Resort. Near the midpoint of the route, NY 64 has an overlap with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) and NY 5 that takes the route through the village of Bloomfield. The majority of what is now NY 64 was originally designated as part of Route 14, an unsigned legislative route, by the New York State Legislature in 1908. In the vicinity of Bloomfield, however, Route 14 initially followed what later became NY 20C in order to access Holcomb. The alignment of Route 14 through Bloomfield was modified in 1921 to use modern NY 64 instead. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of Route 14 between Mendon and Pittsford became part of NY 15\\\\. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 15 was realigned to follow a new routing to the east while the Mendon‚ÄìPittsford segment of its former routing became the basis for NY 64, a new route that extended southward over the post-1921 routing of legislative Route 14 to South Bristol. Route description Southern terminus of NY 64 at NY 21 in South Bristol NY 64 begins at an intersection with NY 21 on a ridge overlooking Canandaigua Lake in Bristol Springs, a hamlet of South Bristol. The route heads to the northwest as a two-lane highway, running in the base of the Bristol Valley, a lowland created by a pair of imposing mountain ranges to the east and west that is home to the Bristol Mountain Ski Resort. At the hamlet of Bristol Center (in the town of Bristol), roughly from Bristol Springs, the western mountains give way to flat farmland while the eastern range continues on, although to a lesser extent and a lower elevation than before. The elevation of NY 64 remains virtually unchanged, however, as it progresses northward. from Bristol Center, the route meets US 20A. US 20A joins NY 64 here, following the latter for about , allowing US 20A to terminate at its parent, US 20, here concurrent with NY 5, at an intersection in East Bloomfield. At this point, NY 64 turns west onto US 20 and NY 5. The three routes head westward across mostly open fields, meeting the southern terminus of NY 444 south of the former village of Holcomb. Past the junction, which once served as the eastern terminus of NY 20C, US 20, NY 5, and NY 64 continue into the village of Bloomfield before NY 64 breaks from NY 5 and US 20 and turns northward toward Rochester once again. US 20 and NY 5 eastbound and NY 64 southbound at NY 444 near Bloomfield A mere north of US 20 and NY 5, NY 64 meets the west end of Bloomfield's West Main Street at a rural intersection that was the western terminus of NY 20C. North of West Main Street, the highway curves to the northwest as it exits East Bloomfield and enters the adjacent town of West Bloomfield. In the northeast corner of the town, NY 64 passes through the hamlet of Ionia. Northwest of the community, the route breaks to the north, taking a due north alignment as it passes into Monroe County and becomes Mendon‚ÄìIonia Road. The road stays on a relatively straight path northward as it heads through the rural southern portion of the town of Mendon to the hamlet of Mendon, where NY 64 meets NY 251 in the center of the community. On the opposite side of NY 251, NY 64 becomes Pittsford‚ÄìMendon Road. Outside of the hamlet, the highway maintains a consistent northerly alignment as it runs through slightly more populated areas of the town of Mendon and passes over the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90). The route enters the town of Pittsford a short distance north of the Thruway, at which time NY 64 becomes Mendon Road. Within Pittsford, NY 64 passes through increasingly more populated areas as it approaches the village of Pittsford. Directly south of the village, the highway enters an intersection with South Main Street, Stone Road and Mendon Center Road at a sharp angle. NY 253 once entered this junction on Mendon Center Road and followed NY 64 into Pittsford; however, today, NY 64 continues alone onto South Main Street. The route ends just under later at the junction of South Main Street and Jefferson Road, where it meets NY 96 and NY 252. History Approaching the northern terminus of NY 64 on NY 64 northbound in Pittsford In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route 14, an unsigned legislative route that extended from Corning to Rochester via South Bristol and Pittsford. The majority of Route 14 south of Pittsford was routed on what is now NY 64; however, in the vicinity of Bloomfield, Route 14 broke from modern NY 64 and used what later became NY 20C to access Holcomb. At the same time, the portion of current NY 64 that overlaps with US 20 and NY 5 was included in Route 6, a cross-state highway connecting Albany to Buffalo. On March 1, 1921, Route 14 was altered to bypass Holcomb to the south on what is now NY 64. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the portion of legislative Route 14 between Mendon and Pittsford became part of NY 15, a route that mostly followed the current alignment of NY 96 from Owego to Rochester. Between Victor and Pittsford, however, NY 15 strayed from the modern routing of NY 96 and followed what is now NY 251 to Mendon. At the same time, the segment of legislative Route 6 in East Bloomfield became part of both NY 5 and NY 5A. The NY 5A designation was replaced along this stretch with NY 7 by 1926, which in turn was replaced by US 20 in 1927. This edition shows U.S. Routes as they were first officially signed in 1927. In the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, NY 15 was realigned to bypass Mendon to the northeast by way of the current alignment of NY 96 between Victor and Pittsford. The former alignment of NY 15 from Pittsford to Mendon became part of NY 64, a new route that extended south to South Bristol over the post-1921 routing of legislative Route 14. The portion of NY 64 between Vincent and South Bloomfield became part of US 20A , allowing the route to reconnect to US 20 at South Bloomfield. NY 64 briefly extended north of the village of Pittsford during the 1950s and 1960s. In the mid-1950s, NY 96 was realigned onto the new Eastern Expressway from Bushnell's Basin to NY 31F near East Rochester. From there, NY 96 followed modern NY 31F west to East Avenue, where it rejoined its original alignment. The portion of NY 96's original surface routing between the village of Pittsford and what is now NY 31F became part of an extended NY 64. A northwest extension of the freeway to what is now the Can of Worms was completed as a realignment of NY 96, resulting in another extension of NY 64 along East Avenue to the eastern edge of Rochester. NY 64 and NY 96 were restored to their pre-1950s alignments when the Eastern Expressway was designated as I-490.

She principally wrote hymns and poems which were strongly religious. She has been characterized as Norway's first recognized female author as well as Norway's first feminist before feminism became a recognized concept. Background Dorothe Engelbretsdatter was born in Bergen, Norway. She was the daughter of Rector and Vicar, Engelbret J√∏rgenss√∏n (1592‚Äì1659) and Anna Wrangel. Her father was originally head of Bergen Cathedral School, and later dean of Bergen Cathedral. In her youth, Dorothe spent some time in Copenhagen. In 1652, she married Ambrosius Hardenbeck (1621‚Äì1683), a theological writer famous for his flowery funeral sermons, who succeeded her father at the Cathedral in 1659. They had five sons and four daughters.Dorothe Engelbretsdatter ‚Äì \\"Bergens Debora\\" (Bergensbrannen 1702) Career Title engraving of Taare-Offer (1685) showing Engelbretsdatter at work Relief by Ambrosia T√∏nnesen at Bergen Cathedral In 1678 her first volume appeared, Si√¶lens Sang-Offer published at Copenhagen. This volume of hymns and devotional pieces, very modestly brought out, had an unparalleled success. The first verses of Dorothe Engelbretsdatter are commonly believed to have been her best.Dorothe Engelbretsdatter (Store norske leksikon) The fortunate poet was invited to Denmark, and on her arrival at Copenhagen was presented at court. She was also introduced to Thomas Hansen Kingo, the father of Danish poetry. The two greeted one another with improvised couplets, which have been preserved and of which Engelbretsdatter's reply \\"is incomparably the neater\\". King Christian V of Denmark granted her full tax freedom for life.

In the midst of her troubles appeared her second work, the Taare-Offer, published for the first time in 1685. It is a continuous religious poem in four books. This was combined with Si√¶lens Sang-Offer. In 1698 she brought out a third volume of sacred verse, Et kristeligt Valet fra Verden.Dorothe Engelsbretsdotter (norskarkivet) In 1683, her husband died. She had nine children, but seven of them died young and her two adult sons lived far away from Bergen. She lost her house in the great fire in 1702 in which 90 percent of the city of Bergen was destroyed. Her re-placement house was not available until 1712. Her sorrow is evident in examples such as the poem Afften Psalme. She died on 19 February 1716.

He was a vocal critic of the Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party), then the single ruling party of the Republic of China in Taiwan, and was most famous for writing an unauthorized biography of Chiang Ching-kuo, then president of the Republic of China. He later became a naturalized citizen of the United States, and resided in Daly City, California, where he was assassinated by Bamboo Union members who had been reportedly trained by Republic of China military intelligence. Biography Liu was born on in Jingjiang, Jiangsu, Republican China. When he was nine years old, his father was killed by Communists. When he turned sixteen, he was drafted into the Nationalist Revolutionary Army, and he left for Taiwan in 1949. After leaving the military, he worked for the state-run radio and later as a reporter for the Taiwan Daily News, where he was sent on assignment to Hong Kong, Manila, and the Vietnam War. After marrying his wife Helen Cui Rong-Zhi, he became a foreign correspondent in 1967, and moved to Washington DC, where he took graduate classes at American University and worked part-time as an interpreter for the State Department. Later, his emigration to the United States was said to be motivated in part because he felt the government of Taiwan was suppressing him. He became a United States citizen in 1973‚Äì74, around the same time he left the Taiwan Daily News. After leaving the newspaper, Liu published articles, essays and books that were critical of the Chiang family and associated people, including Chiang Kai- shek, Soong Mei-ling, Chiang Ching-kuo, K. C. Wu and Wang Sheng, with books on Long Yun and K. C. Wu planned at the time he was assassinated. Liu ran two gift shops in Fisherman's Wharf and San Mateo and was a freelance journalist for several publications in Hong Kong and the San Francisco Journal, a US- based Chinese-language newspaper published by Maurice Chuck. After publishing several articles about the Chiang family, he received a letter from General Wang Sheng warning him from publishing a biography of Chiang Ching-kuo.The Murder of Henry Liu (1985), p.48. \\"He was told to consult with as many people as possible before publishing, to think of what was good for Taiwan, and should 'move cautiously, and think twice,' before publishing [his biography of Chiang Ching-kuo].\\" He proceeded to publish an unauthorized biography of Chiang Ching-kuo in 1975, which was formed from three articles he had written in 1975 about Chiang's life prior to 1949. Liu planned to update the biography to cover more recent history, but was once again warned against writing about the Chiang family by Admiral Wang Hsi-ling in 1977. Liu finally revised the biography after a meeting late in 1983 where he favorably received a suggestion to tone down the criticism of the Chiang family from a family friend, former intelligence agent, and his former publisher on the Taiwan Daily News, Hsia Hsiao-hua. Following the suggestion, Liu received from Taiwan. Assassination On 15 October 1984, Liu was shot to death in the garage of his home in Daly City, California shortly after 9 a.m. Helen Cui, Henry's wife, had noticed two Asian men riding bicycles near their house that morning and the morning before; she heard loud noises in the garage and discovered her husband had been killed. The assassination had been planned by Chen Chi-li, leader of the Bamboo Union Triad, and carried out by two Bamboo Union members, Wu Tun and Tung Kuei-sen. Chen was acting on the request of the head of Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau, Vice Admiral Wang Hsi-ling, who had requested that Liu be \\"[given] a lesson\\" after writing articles critical of the Taiwan government. Wu and Tung cornered Liu in his garage, and the three men struggled, ending after Wu shot Liu in the head and Tung shot Liu twice in the abdomen. Some of Liu's friends suggested the \\"somewhat gossipy\\" biography of Chiang Ching-kuo delved into the background of Chiang Kai-shek's mother too deeply, while others suggested he was about to publish some works harmful to some governmental officials. Police ruled out robbery early in the investigation and a Taiwanese spokesman denied government involvement. =Confession of Chen Chi-li= Preparations for the assassination of Liu started in July 1984, according to the tape-recorded confession of Chen Chi-li, leader of the Bamboo Union Triad. Earlier, in the wake of the 1979 Kaohsiung Incident, Chen had reorganized the Bamboo Union to assist the Kuomintang-led government in gathering information and suppressing dissidents. In July 1984, Chen and an unnamed \\"prominent Taiwan movie producer\\" received espionage training after being inducted into the service of military intelligence. On 14 August 1984, Chen and the movie producer met with Vice Admiral Wang Hsi-ling, the head of Taiwan's Military Intelligence Bureau, and two of Wang's officials, Major General Hu Yi-min () and Colonel (no relation). During the meeting, Chen Chi-li and the movie producer were told that Liu had betrayed Taiwan as an agent of the People's Republic of China with his criticism. Chen Chi-li and the movie producer arrived in the United States on 14 September 1984, but the producer unexpectedly backed out shortly afterward for personal reasons, leaving Chen Chi-li to recruit two other Bamboo Union members who had also recently arrived in the US to assist him in the assassination, and Tung Kuei-sen. Wu had left Taiwan earlier in September, after local police had found a gun in his tea shop. Tung had arrived in July to explore business opportunities in southern California. The original plot would have used local northern California Bamboo Union members to carry out the assassination, but the head of the San Francisco branch failed to meet them in late September as planned. On 9 October 1984, Chen Chi-li and two other men drove from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Tung joined the group on 12 October 1984. Chen Chi-li was observed while conducting surveillance in Liu's Daly City neighborhood, being later identified as \\"the Asian man who couldn't speak English\\" by neighborhood children who had found him feeding candy to their lost dog on 13 October 1984. After the assassination, Liu's killers fled to Los Angeles, where Chen Chi-li telephoned officials in Taiwan to confirm the hit prior to boarding a plane to Taiwan. After reading news accounts of the murder, Chen Chi-li realized he had been duped into believing that Liu was a communist agent, and he recorded his confession on 18 October 1984. The killers were reportedly offered each by Wang for the successful killing, but they refused the money. Chen's October confession mentions the existence of a second recording of a conversation between Chen and \\"high officials\\" in the Taiwanese government. The FBI sought the second recording, but the existence of the second recording was never conclusively proven. Although the FBI did not comment officially, friends of Chen Chi-li claimed they were questioned about the whereabouts of the second recording, as well as about any links between Chen and Chiang Hsiao-wu. Legal actions Chen and Wu were arrested in Taiwan along with 300 other members of the Bamboo Union during a 13 November 1984 government crackdown on organized crime. Chen reportedly confessed to his and Wang's roles while imprisoned, and two days later, on 15 January 1985, the three officials named in the confession were relieved of their duties and placed under arrest. At that time, an investigation by the FBI and Daly City police surfaced; they had been quietly questioning Los Angeles-area Bamboo Union members, seeking a copy of Chen's October recording. The government of Taiwan continued to deny culpability in the death of Liu, claiming that Wang and his subordinates were not acting as agents of the Taiwanese government. The existence of the tape-recorded October confession remained a rumor until the Los Angeles Times obtained a copy of the recording in March 1985 from Chang An-lo, a friend of Tung who had hosted him in September 1984. Daly City Police Lieutenant Thomas Reese was allowed to interview Wu and Chen in prison, later filing an affidavit in January 1985 to support a warrant for Wu's arrest. The affidavit provided the motive for Liu's murder, with Wu stating that Chen had told him that \\"Liu had written some bad things about Taiwan and its president,\\" and Chen had asked him to help \\"beat up or fix up\\" Liu. Chen Chi-li's associates claimed that Chen was a close friend of Chiang Hsiao-wu, Chiang Ching-kuo's second son. Chiang Hsiao-wu was also claimed to have close ties to the Taiwanese security network, but Chiang denied both claims in a statement to the Times. Wang would later deny that Chiang Hsiao-wu was involved. Chen and Wu had been in custody in Taiwan since November 1984, and the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was pushing for their return to the United States to face criminal charges. Daly City Police had requested the fingerprints and photographs of the suspects. Officials from Taiwan refused to remand the suspects to United States custody pending the results of their own investigation and possible trial, citing the fact that Taiwan and the US had no formal extradition treaty. In March 1985, the FBI discovered the October tape recording made by chief hitman Chen Chi-li implicating Republic of China military intelligence in the killing, whereupon they began to pressure the government to bring Liu's killers to trial. The FBI investigation was confirmed by United States Attorney Joseph Russoniello. The investigation was conducted with the State Department serving as go-between for the FBI and the government of Taiwan. Meanwhile, the House of Representatives passed a non-binding resolution urging Taiwan to remand custody of the murder suspects to the United States for trial. Chen and Wu went on trial in April 1985, with Tung being tried in absentia. The military tribunal of Wang and his subordinates followed in April 1985. =Criminal trials= At a pre-trial hearing in Taipei, Chen Chi-li claimed that Wang Hsi- ling of Kuomintang intelligence ordered the assassination, stating that Liu was a double agent who had spied for both Taiwan and China. However, Chen claimed he instructed his associates to disobey Wang's orders and instead wanted Liu to be injured, not killed, after learning that Liu's parents had been killed by Chinese communists. Chen and Wu were convicted in April 1985 and sentenced to life imprisonment, after tearfully begging to avoid the death penalty. In May 1985, a month after his conviction, Chen retracted this statement, stating that Wang had only ordered that Liu be taught a lesson, not killed, which brought Chen's story in agreement with Wang's testimony during his nearly-simultaneous military tribunal. The life sentences were upheld under two separate court rulings. Under Taiwan law, both Chen and Wu were eligible for parole after serving ten years of their sentence. Meanwhile, Wang and his subordinates were subjected to a military tribunal. Two sessions were held; during the first, on 4 April 1985, Chen Chi-li was called to testify, where he and Wang sparred over who bore greater responsibility for Liu's death. During the second, Wang denied that he had authorized the killing, only that he had discussed the possibility of \\"giving [Liu] a lesson\\" and that his sole mistake was failing to inform his superiors that Chen was responsible when he learned of the killing, effectively shielding any higher governmental officials from blame. His subordinates stated they contacted Chen only at Wang's request and therefore bore no personal responsibility in following orders. The tribunal ended with no other witnesses called, resulting in Wang's April 1985 conviction and sentence of life imprisonment; his subordinates were each sentenced at the same hearing to two and a half years in prison for acting as accessories to the murder. The life sentence for Wang was upheld during a later review, although Wang was also eligible for parole after ten years. Tung Kuei-sen had been rumored to be living in the Philippines, as he was not detained during the November 1984 Taiwan crackdown on Bamboo Union members when Chen and Wu had been arrested. Tung was eventually captured in Brazil in September 1985, and was extradited to the United States. He first stood for federal trial in 1986 in New York, where he was found innocent of racketeering but convicted of conspiring to import and distribute heroin. At the 1986 trial, Tung's defense attorneys argued that Tung had been duped into murdering Liu by appealing to his sense of patriotism. Tung testified that he was following government orders to assassinate Liu. Following the trial in New York, Tung was extradited to California in March 1987 to stand trial for the murder of Henry Liu. Based on testimony that he had killed Henry Liu in the 1986 federal trial, Tung was ordered to stand trial in June 1987, with the actual trial commencing in March 1988, where despite his earlier testimony, he pleaded innocent to the murder charge. Tung testified during the trial that Chen Chi-li was relaying the order to kill Liu from Chiang Hsiao-wu, a \\"big boss,\\" but he was found guilty of first-degree murder after just forty-five minutes of deliberation. Because Tung had been extradited from Brazil, he was not eligible for the death penalty. Instead, he was sentenced to twenty-seven years in prison, to run consecutively after the twenty-year federal sentence for drug smuggling charges. Tung was the only one of the six named conspirators to stand trial in the United States, despite State Department requests to have Chen Chi-li and Wu Tun stand trial as well. Tung later filed an appeal for his murder conviction and sentence, which stated that the trial court should have requested a manslaughter verdict rather than murder, as he was acting out of patriotism. The appeal was rejected and his sentence upheld in 1990. =Summary of penalties= * Chen Chi-li, sentenced to life in prison (April 1985); commuted to 15 years and granted parole (January 1991) * Wu Tun, sentenced to life in prison (April 1985); commuted to 15 years and granted parole (January 1991) * Tung Kuei-sen, sentenced to 27 years to life in prison (May 1988); stabbed to death while in prison (1991) * Wang Hsi-ling, sentenced to life in prison (April 1985); commuted to 15 years and granted parole (January 1991) * Hu Yi-min, sentenced to 2.5 years in prison (April 1985); * Chen Hu-men, sentenced to 2.5 years in prison (April 1985); after release, changed his name to Chen Yi-chiao () and later promoted to director of a Military Intelligence Bureau department =Civil suit= Liu's widow Helen filed a suit in a United States district court against the Republic of China and the six named conspirators, alleging that his murder had been arranged by Taiwanese officials acting in an official capacity. Although the suit survived an early motion to dismiss as an act of state grounds, Judge Eugene F. Lynch dropped Taiwan from the suit in 1987 based on Wang's military tribunal, which had concluded that Wang was not acting on behalf of the government of Taiwan, nor could his superiors have predicted his actions. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed Lynch's decision, ruling (Liu v. Republic of China) that the ROC government was liable under the doctrine of respondeat superior; a petition for certiorari from the ROC government to the U.S. Supreme Court was subsequently rejected. The suit was finally settled out of court. Fallout The assassination became a major political scandal in Taiwan and American officials were critical of the Kuomintang for allegedly orchestrating an assassination on United States soil. In a December 1985 speech, Chiang Hsiao- wu's father Chiang Ching-kuo declared ‚Ä≥If someone asks me whether anyone in my family would run for the next presidential term, my reply is, ‚Ä≤It can't be and it won't be.‚Ä≤‚Ä≥ Prior to the Henry Liu murder, Chiang Hsiao-wu was the only one of Chiang Ching-kuo's sons mentioned as a potential successor to his father; the younger Chiang later served on the trade mission to Singapore, a move seen as soft exile. In popular culture The assassination was the subject of the book Fires of the Dragon by David E. Kaplan. A fictionalized version of the assassination was portrayed in the 2009 film Formosa Betrayed.

The center of downtown is the intersection of 9th and Broadway. The city Christmas tree is located here as well.  Downtown  Downtown Tacoma's mid-century downturn was exacerbated by the opening of the Tacoma Mall on May 16, 1968. Many of the anchor retail stores left the downtown to relocate to the mall.  Revitalization efforts and progress  Following the exodus of retailers to the Tacoma Mall in the late 1960s, city leadership attempted to make downtown more appealing to shoppers by building two large parking garages and by closing off to traffic two blocks of Broadway Street between South 9th and South 11th Streets. The Broadway Mall was less successful than hoped and the street was re-opened to traffic during the 1980s. Later revitalization efforts were centered around the renovation of Union Station in 1990, which became Tacoma's federal courthouse, coupled with the opening of University of Washington Tacoma. The University of Washington rejected a greenfield site for its new South Puget Sound campus and, instead, decided to restore six historic warehouses in a dilapidated district on the edge of downtown Tacoma. Today, the area is a thriving museum and university district. Retail and restaurants have returned and downtown is undergoing a renaissance. The addition of the Museum of Glass, Tacoma Art Museum, and the Washington State History Museum added much life to the area. The Tacoma City Council passed the Local Improvement District for St. Helens Street in April 2006 which was designed to improve areas which have been neglected. The LID is expected to start in 2008. Also central to the revitalization effort has been the city's adoption of the tax exemption for new residential units in multifamily dwellings, primarily apartments and condominiums. Starting in 2002, downtown Tacoma began seeing an increase in the number of residential units being built or renovated downtown. Buildings such as the Perkins Building, Harmon Lofts, and Cliff Street were renovated for living units. A new regional convention center, the Greater Tacoma Convention and Trade Center, opened in 2004.  Historic buildings  Downtown Tacoma is well known for historic buildings most built at the end of the 19th century. The buildings include the Old City Hall Building, Union Station, Elks Temple, Bostwick Building, the Winthrop Hotel and the Pythian Temple, which houses Seabury Middle School. The Mecca Theater is currently being restored.

Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books, the character is based on Heracles of Greek mythology. The character has starred in three self- titled limited series and been a perennial member of the superhero team the Avengers. In 2008, Hercules debuted in his own series titled The Incredible Hercules. The character was ranked 21st in IGN's list of \\"The Top 50 Avengers\\", and has appeared in various forms of media including television series and video games. Publication history The character was adapted from mythology by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. Hercules debuted in Avengers #10 (Nov. 1964) as a minion of Immortus, although his appearance was revealed in the limited series Avengers Forever #1 - 12 (Dec. 1998 ‚Äì Nov. 1999) as being an impostor. The character's first formal appearance in the Marvel Universe became Journey into Mystery Annual #1 (1965), which established Hercules as being a rival of the thunder god Thor. Hercules became a regular guest star in the title Thor, appearing in issue #126 (March 1966). The character guest-starred in Tales To Astonish #79 (May 1966), and his deadlocked battle with the Hulk, as told by Lee, Kirby, and Bill Everett, has come to be regarded as a classic. The tale parallels Hercules and the Hulk's titanic strength, short temper, and simple-mindedness, while contrasting their lot in life: Hercules being a beloved hero and pampered celebrity, while the Hulk is a hated and feared fugitive. The character teamed up with the Avengers in issue #38 (March 1967), but was not yet an official member; he was merely a guest of the Avengers during his banishment from Olympus. In issue #45 of The Avengers, Hercules became a \\"full-fledged Avenger\\" by way of Goliath's announcement to the press during the first annual \\"Avengers Day\\". Hercules also guest starred in Marvel Team-Up #28 (Dec. 1974) and Marvel Premiere #26 (Nov. 1975) before starring along with four other heroes in The Champions which ran for 17 issues (Oct. 1975 ‚Äì Jan. 1978). After this, Hercules made a guest appearance in Marvel Two-In-One #44 (Oct. 1978). Hercules starred in two limited series by writer-artist Bob Layton, with both set in an alternate universe. A 24th century version of Hercules starred in Hercules, Prince of Power #1 - 4 (Sep. ‚Äì Dec. 1982), which was popular enough to spawn a sequel, Hercules, Prince of Power vol. 2, #1 - 4 (March ‚Äì June 1984). The storylines dealt with Hercules's exile from Olympus, completion of a series of quests and opportunity to leave his past behind and create a new identity. Hercules remained a constant guest star in both Thor and the Avengers, playing a significant role in the \\"Avengers Under Siege\\" storyline in Avengers #270 - 277 (Aug. 1986 ‚Äì March 1987), involving supervillain team the Masters of Evil. The story lead directly into the \\"Assault on Olympus\\" storyline in Avengers #281 - 285 (July 1987 ‚Äì Nov. 1987), in which Hercules left the team. The character starred in the self-titled limited series Hercules vol. 3, #1 - 5 (June - Sep. 2005), and guest starred in the limited series Thor: Blood Oath #1 - 6 (Nov. 2005 - Feb. 2006), a retrospective story that depicts the second meeting between the Hercules and Thor. At the conclusion of the \\"World War Hulk\\" storyline, Hercules received a self-titled publication when Marvel changed the name of the third volume of the Incredible Hulk series to The Incredible Hercules, effective as of issue #113 (Feb. 2008), and written by Greg Pak and Fred Van Lente.GREEK WEEK Part I -Pak & Van Lente talk Hercules's Past, Comic Book Resources, March 17, 2008GREEK WEEK Part IV- Pak & Van Lente on Herc's Past & Future, Comic Book Resources, March 20, 2008Love, Olympian Style: Pak & Van Lente talk \\"Incredible Hercules\\", Comic Book Resources, September 4, 2008 The series concluded with Incredible Hercules #141 (April 2010), and was followed by the 2-issue mini-series Hercules: Fall of an Avenger (March - April 2010).

It is the only member of the genus Paracrinia. Description The ventral surface of Paracrinia haswelli This species of frog reaches 30 mm in length. This frog varies from light grey brown, pale brown to red-brown above with some darker flecks. There is normally a faint mid-dorsal stripe running down the back. There is also a dark band running from the back of the eye to the shoulder. The top half of the iris is silver. The thighs are red, which gives it another name, the red- groined froglet. The ventral surface of this species is light brown with white patches. Ecology and behaviour This species is associated with coastal swamps, particularly in wallum swampland and heathland. This species also inhabits dams, ponds and ditches in sclerophyll forest and woodland. Males make an \\"annk\\" call from water or on land during most of the year, but most often after rain in autumn and winter. Eggs are laid in water attached to sticks and leaves. The tadpole of this species has very deeply arched tail fins. Metamorphosis occurs during spring and autumn after a tadpole life span of about 100 days. Metamorph frogs measure 13 mm and resemble the adult, however the thigh red colouration is not yet fully developed.

The gate was probably designed by John Wellborn Root of Burnham and Root around 1875, and is the only significant structural element of the stock yards to survive. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1981. The plaza surrounding the gate also includes the city's principal memorial to its firefighters. Description The Union Stock Yard Gate is located on Chicago's South Side, on a plaza in the center of Exchange Avenue at its junction with Peoria Street. This position marked the principal eastern entrance to the stock yards, which occupied several hundred acres to the west. It is a limestone construction with a central main arch flanked by two smaller arches. The main arch is wide and high, with the surmounting truncated hip roof giving the structure a total height of . The piers of the central arch are topped by conical limestone turrets. The smaller side arches are asymmetrical (one is wide, the other ), but are similarly styled on a smaller scale. One of the side arches retains an iron grillwork gate, of a style that both would have originally had. The main gate at one time had an iron portcullis. History The Union Stock Yard was established in 1865, as a place to centralize the city's growing meatpacking industry. Its early facilities were constructed out of wood, with some elements later rebuilt in stone. This gate was built in 1879, and was probably designed by Daniel Burnham and John W. Root, who were responsible for the design of other structures in the yards. The gate and an accompanying gatehouse (since demolished), were the only substantial buildings to survive a fire that leveled the yards in 1934. Restored in the 1970s, the limestone gate now stands as one of the few reminders of Chicago's past dominance in the meat packing industry. Over the arch of the gate, Root included a now famous bust of \\"Sherman,\\" the favorite prize-winning bull of John B. Sherman. The gate was designated an official Chicago Landmark on February 24, 1972, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on December 27, 1972. It was then designated a National Historic Landmark on May 29, 1981. Directly behind the gate is a memorial statue for Chicago firefighters. The statue is located there because of the Chicago Union Stock Yards Fire, and around the base are engraved the names of all Chicago firefighters ever killed in the line of duty.

The series originally started serialization in volume seventeen of ASCII Media Works' now-defunct light novel magazine Dengeki hp on April 18, 2002. Four more chapters were published until the first bound novel of the series was released, though more chapters were later serialized in the magazine. Fourteen main novels, plus two additional bonus novels with illustrations by Mari Matsuzawa, were published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko label between January 10, 2003 and December 10, 2008. The series revolves around a dog goddess named Y≈çko and her master Keita Kawahira as they fight against various troublesome spirits. Several more inukami besides Y≈çko also play an important role, most notably the inukami of Kaoru Kawahira. A manga adaptation by Mari Matsuzawa was serialized in MediaWorks' now-defunct sh≈çnen manga magazine Dengeki Comic Gao! between October 2005 and February 2008.

Another light novel entitled Inukami Special Edition was only released as a promotional gift for the animated film. The word appears to be a corruption of the word , a type of Japanese spirit that literally means \\"dog god\\". The only difference between the two words is the lack of a dakuten in \\"inukami\\". A possible reason is that traditional inugami are considered dangerous spirits, more likely to cause harm than help, and are sometimes used to invoke deadly curses. Plot Inukami! revolves around Keita Kawahira, a descendant of an Inukami-tamer clan and considered a failure by the clan due to his attitude towards his duty and being unable to find an Inukami to bond with. Inukami, literally \\"dog god\\", are benevolent creatures that possess spiritual powers. They are a type of demon with the appearance of a dog who can transform into a human form. Along with a partner from the historic Inukami-tamer clan, they act to obliterate evil and proliferate righteousness. Keita is initially unable to find an Inukami to bond with, but eventually finds a beautiful Inukami named Yoko that decided to become his Inukami, causing Keita to become overjoyed. However, his joy is short-lived when he discovers that she is a very problematic and uncontrollable Inukami. At first Yoko is shown to be selfish and just thinks of herself, to help with this problem Keita's cousin Kaoru sends one of his Inukamis, Nadeshiko, over to help. Keita becomes attracted to Nadeshiko. However, Yoko is thrown into a jealous rage, this is subdued when Keita's grandma's Inukami Hake calms Yoko down stating that Nadeshiko's visit was short and was only here to help Yoko. After Nadeshiko leaves, Yoko grows even closer to Keita although she is annoyed by Keita's flirting with the rest of Kaoru's inukamis when they go to visit. Things later get heated up when Keita fights a shinigami in order to save the last heir of a wealthy family from death. Yoko ends up beating the shinigami. However, Keita sees what appears to be a large fox where Yoko was fighting, but in the end he blacked out. Towards the end everyone is getting ready to celebrate Keita's grandma's birthday, a special guest who is a giant frog appears looking for Keita, Yoko mistakes him for a perverted frog but learns that the frog's name is Hakusan Meikun. Hakusan, a fallen wizard tells Yoko how he was chosen by Keita and thus became free from a sentence he was serving after making a contract with Keita, in return Hakusan gave him magic abilities. After hearing the story, Yoko becomes jealous and worried that she might get replaced something that is noticed by Nadeshiko. Yoko has a secret hidden and feels guilt, to help with this Nadeshiko suggests confessing to her like she would to Keita with her eyes closed, Yoko agrees and as she is confessing; Nadeshiko slips away and is replaced by Keita who overheard Yoko talking to her. Stunned by seeing Keita by her side which Yoko apologizes to Keita that she did not tell him sooner, something Keita does not care about. Keita states he likes Yoko for Yoko, reminds that he chose her and asks to stay by her side.

He was one of the most prominent of the twelve leaders of the Norman mercenaries serving Guaimar IV of Salerno. Though it had not yet been conquered from the Byzantine Empire, Peter received Trani in the Normans' division of Apulia made at Melfi in 1042. In that same division his brother Walter received Civitate. Peter probably arrived in southern Italy around 1035. It is unknown if Peter was in fact from Normandy; he may have been a Breton or a Frenchman. His father, Amicus (Amico), may have been a relative of the Hautevilles or married to one. In 1038 Peter participated in the Byzantine campaign led by George Maniakes against the Emirate of Sicily. In battle he was usually found beside William Iron Arm, the leader and first count of the Normans of Melfi. After the division of 1042 Peter fortified the region around Trani, building new cities at Andria and Corato and re-fortifying Bisceglie and Barletta, as recorded by the chronicler William of Apulia (book II, lines 30‚Äì32): :Ditior his Petrus consanguinitate propinquus :Edidit hic Andrum fabricavit et inde Coretum :Buxilias, Barolum maris aedificavit in oris. In 1046 he made his first assault on Trani, succeeding in capturing the suburbs and environs but not the city itself, which was defended by Argyrus, a former Norman ally. The Tranesi themselves were Byzantine partisans, with no sympathy for the Normans. In 1046 Peter was also a candidate to succeed William. According to William of Apulia, though he was the wealthier candidate he was confronted at Melfi by William's brothers Humphrey and Drogo, who supposedly mortally wounded him in a duel. More likely he was just taken captive, since he and Humphrey jointly led a Norman army against Argyrus in 1053. Argyrus had travelled with his troops by ship to Siponto. There he was defeated, suffering heavy losses and, being severely wounded himself, barely escaped to Viesti, according to the Anonymus Barensis (¬ß152). Peter is recorded by Amatus of Montecassino as entering Melfi again in 1057 to dispute the succession with Drogo's younger brother Robert Guiscard. According to the same source the Melfitans rebelled against him and he fled to Cisterna. Peter and Guiscard must have made peace, however, as Amatus records that the former's two daughters were found wealthy husbands by the latter. In 1064, Peter's second son Geoffrey refers to his father as magni comitis Petroni in an act donating one ship to the monastery of the Santissima Trinit√† in Venosa for fishing on the Mar Piccolo, the bay of Taranto. Peter's youngest son, Peter II, likewise confirmed this donation pro remedio anime (ejus) (\\"for the health of [their father's] soul\\"). Peter I had not taken Trani by the time of his death. He is sometimes confused with his son Peter. The \\"count Petrone\\" who defeated Argyrus in 1053 has an entry in the Prosopography of the Byzantine World and is identified there with the son of Amicus, that is, Peter I, though other source believe the Petronius of 1053 was Peter II. \\"Petronius\\" is an augmentative of Peter, and indicates greatness (probably of stature). Peter I's relationship to his son Geoffrey is mentioned in Lupus Protospatharius. Peter's eldest son, Amicus, is barely known.

Prazos operated like a semi-feudal system and were most commonly found in the Zambezi River valley.Eckert, Grau & Sonderegger. The prazo was a land grant or lease given in exchange for a fixed annual fee based on laws promulgated by the medieval kings of Portugal, Afonso V and Manuel I, and established in Portuguese Africa in the 17th century. The leaseholder was required to live on the grant and could not sell or sub-let it, although this was frequently violated. In Tete Province during the 19th century, 32 prazeros owned 57 prazos. The land grant was not to exceed 500 leagues in length although most exceeded this limit.Azevedo, Nnadozie & Mbuia, pp. 140‚Äì41. In 1677 a system was adopted to attract white Portuguese settlers. Vacant prazos were to be granted to \\"deserving orphan girls or the daughters of crown servant\\", who would pass the prazo on to her eldest daughter for three generations who were married to Portuguese men. At that time the government could take control of the prazo or renew the lease.Newitt, p. 73. The prazero was allowed to employ Africans (colonos); raise a private army, often made up of slaves; trade in all commodities; and maintain law and order in the prazo. The Portuguese Crown intended the prazo to guarantee control over the land, stimulate agricultural production, facilitate European settlement and be a source of revenue for the government, but the system failed in the objectives. Contributions to the failure were rampant absenteeism, violent rivalries between the grantees, the scarcity of Portuguese women, lack of capital and resistance by the Africans, of which the latter cause was probably the most important. The prazo system's concepts of female inheritance, three lives and individual landownership were alien to African traditions. The government attempted to reform the system in the mid-19th century, but failed to do so. Another attempt was made in the 1890s with no different results, but the introduction of the concessionaire companies about that time, the 1890 British Ultimatum and the Portuguese Colonial Act of 1930 contributed to the end of the prazo.

It is located between the railroad of Ferrocarril General Manuel Belgrano and the Riachuelo River, and the streets Regimiento de Patricios, Defensa, Caseros, V√©lez S√°rsfield, Amancio Alcorta, Lafayette, and Lavard√©n. The name Barracas comes from the word barraca, which refers to a temporary construction of houses using rudimentary materials. History El Aguila Coffee Mill and Chocolatier, Barracas. Darquier Street, a setting for Pino Solanas' acclaimed Sur (1987). In the 18th century, \\"Barracas\\" began to grow on the banks of the Riachuelo River, becoming a slave quarter, as well as an area for leather tanneries, and abattoirs. On March 24, 1791, a bridge was built that gave the neighborhood an important strategic value during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. In 1858, part of this bridge was destroyed by flood and was replaced by a new iron bridge in 1871. There were a series of problems with this new bridge until the inauguration of its replacement in 1931 that still stands today. Throughout most of the 19th century, the neighbourhood was home to some of the wealthiest families of the city. Santa Luc√≠a avenue was the principal centre of activity and contained many of the city's most famous stores at the time. However, an 1871 yellow fever epidemic that swept through many southern parts of the city forced most wealthy families and the area's middle class to relocate to the north of the city, leaving the neighbourhood to become the working-class area that it remains today. A number of wealthy Argentine families retained properties in Barracas during much of the 20th century, maintaining them as rental units of varying quality. Immigrants, especially Italians, started to settle here and it became popular with the working-class. Modest caf√©s were opened, attracting people with a lower financial status. Factories dominated the economy of the area up until around 1980, although they continue to provide an important source of employment. The factories of Barracas began to close afterwards, and fewer train services were operated through the area. Freeway construction during the 1980s resulted in the loss of over 20 residential buildings and two public parks. The barrio set the stage for activist director Fernando Pino Solanas's 1987 film Sur (South). A chronicle of the lives of a group of friends and stockyards co-workers during Argentina's last dictatorship, Sur was as much an ode to Barracas as it was a narrative of the havoc many working-class Argentines lived through in that era. The painting of colorful fa√ßades on Calle Lan√≠n by local artist Marino Santa Mar√≠a during the 1990s has helped foster a number of redevelopment projects in the area, notably the conversion of the former Piccaluga textile factory into upscale lofts, which was completed in 2008. Design District Inside one of the sector of the neighborhood there is a 'Design District', an initiative tending to create a design and manufacture center. This effort, is intended to help the south part of the city and to consolidate Buenos Aires as a Unesco city of design, the project is based on easy credit and possibilities for those entrepreneurs who are willing to move their offices and manufacturing plants to this center, that is between the avenues Pedro de Mendoza, Velez Sarfield and the streets Australia, Brandsen and Herrera. Between the strategies for this center there are preferred loans, tax exceptions, marketing strategies and subsidies to repair real state that is too old. Art Sistine Chapel of Football in Barracas The Sistine Chapel of Football is an artwork exhibited at the Sportivo Pereyra club in Barracas. It honors two of the greatest stars in the history of Argentine football: Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi along with other leading figures such as Juan Rom√°n Riquelme, Gabriel Batistuta, Mario Kempes, Sergio Ag√ºero, Claudio Caniggia, Ricardo Bochini and Ariel Ortega. It is inspired by Michelangelo's classic fresco The Creation of Adam found in the Vatican's Sistine Chapel in Rome. It was created in 2014 by the Argentine graphic designer and artist Santiago Barbeito (a.k.a. Santuke) but it was not until May 2018 that it became globally popular thanks to the viralization of a video filmed by an amateur who uploaded it to social networks.

Founded in 1965, it has approximately 950 students residing in East Baton Rouge Parish and surrounding areas, and has a student/teacher ratio of 11:1. The school serves students in grades PreK-3 through 12. Episcopal is located on a campus located in the eastern section of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. The school's mascot is the Knight, and school colors are navy blue and gold. Episcopal is a member of the following organizations: the National Association of Episcopal Schools, the National Association of Independent Schools, the Southwestern Association of Episcopal Schools, the Independent School Association of the Southwest, and the Southern Association of Independent Schools. The current Head of School is Dr. Carrie Steakley, who was appointed in 2020. Episcopal High School is an independent school that is fiscally self-sufficient. Episcopal receives no funds from the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana, solely relying on funds generated from tuition, fees, capital giving, and the Annual Fund, a yearly fund-rasing program in which all donations made are used for investment in school plans and facilities. The current administrative leadership includes division heads for the Lower School, Middle School, and Upper School. History Episcopal High School was founded in 1965 with intentions of bringing an Episcopalian college preparatory school to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Founding members of the school include G. Allen Penniman, Henry Klock, Dick H. Hearin, and A. C. Lewis. Originally on the site of St. James Episcopal Church of Baton Rouge and the old Baton Rouge Junior High School, Episcopal served approximately 300 students in grades 1-8. The first headmaster was Reverend Ralph Webster. In 1968, students in grades 5-11 moved to the new campus located at 3200 Woodland Ridge Blvd. Students in grades 1-4 remained at the church until the new buildings were completed. The first senior class of 13 matriculated in 1969. The school's gymnasium was destroyed in 1971 by a tornado spawned from Hurricane Edith, and much of the rest of the campus was heavily damaged. Most recently, Episcopal High School allotted space for pre- kindergarteners in 2005. Facilities Facilities at Episcopal include the Visual and Performing Arts Center (VPAC), the Middle School building, a science building, a mathematical sciences building, the Lower School and Greer Center for the Performing Arts, the Kindergarten building, classroom buildings, a chapel, and a dining hall. Recently in 2010, Episcopal has adopted better nutritional meals thanks to the appointed chef. Episcopal also has computer and writing labs, as well as computers with Internet access in each classroom. The main library was renovated in 2000 in order to make it the technological hub of the campus, servicing a network of Dell computers and a wireless network accessible anywhere on campus. A second library serves Episcopal's Lower School students. A variety of Dell computers are in each classroom. Most of the classrooms at Episcopal have SMART boards that help facilitate the learning process. Athletic facilities include two gymnasiums, a weight room, a football stadium, soccer fields, a softball field, an all- weather track, a heated swimming pool, five tennis courts, a baseball complex, and a newly created athletic field house. Athletics Episcopal fields teams in many sports, including softball, soccer, basketball, football, volleyball, baseball, powerlifting, wrestling, swimming, tennis, golf, track and field, and cross-country. The boys' cross-country team has won 24 state AA titles in a row (1996‚Äì2019).

The media campaign had two distinct areas of focus: a teen- targeted Above the Influence Campaign, and a young-adult-targeted anti-meth campaign. By law, the purpose of the media campaign was to prevent drug abuse among teens in the United States; increase awareness of adults of the impact of drug abuse on young people; and encourage parents and other interested adults to discuss with young people the dangers of illegal drug use. The goal of this campaign was to help teens stand up to negative pressures, and influences. The more aware one becomes about the influences around them, the more prepared they will be to face them, including the pressure to use drugs and alcohol. \\"Above the Influence\\" is symbolized by its campaign logo featuring an arrow pointing up with a circle around it. As of March 2014, federal funding and oversight of Above the Influence ceased, and it transitioned to become a program of the not-for-profit Partnership for Drug- Free Kids. Studies In 2006, the Government Accountability Office released the results of a five-year study, concluding that the previous \\"My Anti-Drug\\" campaign was ineffective, and likely counterproductive, leading those exposed to an increased perception that others use marijuana, stating, \\"analysis also indicated that among current, non-drug-using youth, exposure to the campaign had unfavorable effects on their anti-drug norms and perceptions of other youths‚Äô use of marijuana ‚Äî that is, greater exposure to the campaign was associated with weaker anti-drug norms and increases in the perceptions that others use marijuana.\\" In 2011, Ohio State University released the results of an independent scientific study stating that the Above the Influence campaign appears to have effectively reduced marijuana use by teenagers. \\"Evidence for the success of Above the Influence is especially heartening because the primary independent evaluation of its predecessor campaign, 'My Anti-Drug', showed no evidence for success\\", said Michael Slater, principal investigator of the new study and professor of communication at Ohio State University. \\"The 'Above the Influence' campaign appears to be successful because it taps into the desire by teenagers to be independent and self-sufficient\\", Slater said. He also mentioned the limitations of the study. These include the fact that findings regarding the ONDCP campaign were based on survey results and not a randomized, experimental design in which some youth saw the ONDCP campaign and others did not. Another limitation was that the study, while taking place in twenty communities around the U.S., did not use a random sample of U.S. youth.

He was the son of United States Senator William Lucas. Biography Daniel Lucas graduated from the University of Virginia and earned his law diploma from Washington College and graduated in 1856. He studied under Judge John W. Brockenbrough of Lexington and was admitted to the bar in 1859.The West Virginia Encyclopedia, West Virginia Humanities Council, 2006, pg. 437 He served with General Henry A. Wise with the Confederates during the Civil War in the Kanawha campaign of 1861. Late in the war he escaped a blockade of Virginia to aid his college friend John Yates Beall, who had been arrested as a spy. He left Richmond on January 1, 1865, and crossed the Potomac River through the ice in a small skiff. He was not allowed to assist in the defense of Beall by General John Adams Dix, and resided in Canada some months.White, Robert, Col.

His work often earned him the epithet \\"The Poet Laureate of the Lost Cause\\", an honor he shared with several other Southern writers. When he returned to West Virginia the proscription on ex-Confederates in the practice of law prevented him from resuming his career until 1870, when restrictions were lifted.The West Virginia Encyclopedia, pg. 437\\"Lucas, Daniel Bedinger, The Land Where We Were Dreaming, Richard G.

Camden, whom he considered an ally of Standard Oil.Daniel Bedinger Lucas This led Governor Emanuel Willis Wilson to appoint Daniel Lucas to the United States Senate. The legislature, however, decided instead to select Charles J. Faulkner. Governor Wilson appointed Lucas to the Supreme Court of Appeals on December 11, 1889. Lucas also served as President of the Court during his service.

Biography  Ozymandias is the pseudonym of the pianist and composer Christophe Terrettaz. After several years studying classical piano, Christophe Terrettaz starts to compose. His first work, \\"Isolement\\", is produced in 1996 by the German label \\"Weisser Herbst\\". His second album, \\"Ahara\\", is released in 1998 by the cult label World Serpent Distribution. In 1999, Mark Ellis of \\"Elijah's Mantle\\" and Christophe Terrettaz collaborates on \\"The Soul Of Romanticism'\\" a spoken-word album based on poems of Shelley, Byron, Keats, Wordsworth and Coleridge. This work exposes the elements of romanticism through the voice of Ellis Mark and the music of Ozymandias. The following year Christophe Terrettaz creates \\"Karnak,\\" a series of compositions inspired by the Egyptian site of same name. The work is very well received, with Japanese director Ryuichi Hiroki choosing it as the musical theme for his movie \\"Vibrator\\", a film presented in avant-premiere to the 60th Mostra of Venice. In September 2001, Ozymandias, through World Serpent Distribution, releases his fifth album \\"Layla\\". For this opus, Christophe Terrettaz draws inspiration from a number of films from independent cinema, including \\"Un soir apr√®s la guerre\\" of Rithy Panh, \\"Okaeri\\" of Makoto Shinozaki and \\"Buffalo 66\\" of Vincent Gallo. Three years later Ozymandias creates his darkest album yet, \\"Les Doutes Eternels\\", a reflection on human condition and genocide. 2007 brings yet another opus, \\"Absolute\\". This seventh album of Ozymandias is animated by the aspects of the world and its people that Christophe Terrettaz admires. In April 2008, after eight years without concerts, Ozymandias comes back on stage for two shows in Tokyo. Five months later, a new album inspired by his journeys invites you to discover his love for the Orient. The beauty and strength, depth of feelings as well as human folly is the essence of ‚ÄúLes R√™ves Orientaux‚Äù (Oriental Dreams). In February 2009, Christophe, invited Kelli Ali to Switzerland, to collaborate with him on an album inspired by the short stories of the Gothic horror writer, Mary Shelley, and following several sessions between London and Switzerland, this haunting collection was eventually completed, with Kelli writing and performing the lyrics and vocal arrangements and Christophe writing and performing the piano music. \\"A Paradise Inhabited by Devils\\" was released on November 2010. Two titles of this album are used in the Japanese movie ‚ÄúKeibetsu‚Äù. 2012 marks the release of his latest album, ‚ÄúAntipodes‚Äù. Produced without any promotion in order to be in harmony with the theme of the album which means completely against current market trend today. \\"Antipodes\\" is a reflection on the current world where superficial excess and money take everything in its path. \\"Nos Ann√©es Troubles\\" is realised in October 2014. April 2017 - Three years after the album \\"Nos Ann√©es Troubles\\" (Our Troubled Years) and after 15 million plus streams on Spotify for the track \\"I Miss You\\"- Ozymandias returns with his new album \\"Dans Mon Monde\\" (In My World).

Rhys Davids & Stede speculate that the Sanskrit term with which nekkhamma is associated is either: :* naikramya -- \\"inactivity, abstinence or exemption from acts and their consequences\\" (Monier Williams, 1964, p. 570, entry for \\"Naish\\") :* naikƒÅmya -- \\"suppression of desire, profound contemplation\\" (ibid.). In Buddhism's Noble Eightfold Path, nekkhamma is the first practice associated with \\"Right Intention.\\" In the Theravada list of ten perfections, nekkhamma is the third practice of \\"perfection.\\" It involves non-attachment (detachment). In the Pali literature =Renunciation as right intention= In the Pali Canon, in a discourse in which the Buddha describes antecedents precipitating his Awakening, the Buddha divided his thoughts between those that impair discernment, cause affliction and deter one from Nirvana on the one hand, and those that have the opposite effect.Dvedhavitakka Sutta (MN 19) (Thanissaro, 1997). In the former category, he included thoughts permeated with sensuality, ill-will and harmfulness; in the latter, thoughts permeated with renunciation, non-ill will and harmlessness: :\\"Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking & pondering, that becomes the inclination of his awareness. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with renunciation, abandoning thinking imbued with sensuality, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with non-ill will, abandoning thinking imbued with ill will, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with non-ill will. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with harmlessness, abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessness.\\"Thanissaro (1997). Those familiar with the Dhammapada will recognize this passage bears a resemblance to the opening passages of that text. These latter three types of thought content -- renunciation, non-ill will and harmlessness -- comprise the traditional triadic definition of the Noble Eightfold Path's notion of \\"Right Intention\\" (Pali: ; Skt.: ').Thanissaro (1996). For each of the former types of thought content -- sensuality, ill will and harmfulness -- the Buddha stated: :\\"Whenever thinking imbued with sensuality [or ill will or harmfulness] had arisen, I simply abandoned it, destroyed it, dispelled it, wiped it out of existence.\\"Thanissaro (1997). =Renunciation vs. sensuality= Elsewhere in the Canon,For instance, in the Nissaraniya Sutta (AN 5.200) (Thanissaro, 2000). the Buddha more finely juxtaposes the pursuit of thoughts regarding sensuality (kƒÅma) and those regarding renunciation (nekkhamma):Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 377, entry for \\"Nekkhamma\\" (retrieved 2 Jul 2007) , suggests that the connection between sensuality and renunciation is underscored by alliterative word play (between kƒÅma and nekkhamma) in the Canon. :\\"There is the case where the mind of a monk, when attending to sensual pleasures, doesn't leap up at sensual pleasures, doesn't grow confident, steadfast, or released in sensual pleasures. But when attending to renunciation, his mind leaps up at renunciation, grows confident, steadfast, & released in renunciation. When his mind is rightly-gone, rightly developed, has rightly risen above, gained release, and become disjoined from sensual pleasures, then whatever fermentations, torments, & fevers there are that arise in dependence on sensuality, he is released from them. He does not experience that feeling. This is expounded as the escape from sensual pleasures.\\"Thanissaro (2000). =Renunciation as a bodhisatta practice= As indicated above, in a Pali discourse, the Buddha identified renunciation as part of his path to Awakening. In the Buddhavamsa, Jataka tales and exegetical literature, renunciation is codified as the third of ten practices of \\"perfection\\" (pƒÅramƒ´).Buddhavamsa, chapter 2. For an on-line regarding the Buddhavamsa and parami, see Bodhi (2005). In terms of other examples in the Pali literature, Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 454, entry for \\"PƒÅramƒ´,\\" (retrieved 2 Jul 2007) cites Jataka i.73 and Dhammapada-Atthakatha i.84. Bodhi (2005) also mentions Acariya Dhammapala's treatise in the Cariyapitaka- Atthakatha and the Brahmajala Sutta subcommentary (tika). Contemporary elaborations =Renunciation's benefit= Bodhi (1999) elaborates on the various and ultimate benefits of Buddhist renunciation: :\\"Contemplating the dukkha inherent in desire is one way to incline the mind to renunciation. Another way is to contemplate directly the benefits flowing from renunciation. To move from desire to renunciation is not, as might be imagined, to move from happiness to grief, from abundance to destitution. It is to pass from gross, entangling pleasures to an exalted happiness and peace, from a condition of servitude to one of self-mastery. Desire ultimately breeds fear and sorrow, but renunciation gives fearlessness and joy. It promotes the accomplishment of all three stages of the threefold training: it purifies conduct, aids concentration, and nourishes the seed of wisdom. The entire course of practice from start to finish can in fact be seen as an evolving process of renunciation culminating in Nibbana [Pali; Skt: Nirvana] as the ultimate stage of relinquishment, 'the relinquishing of all foundations of existence' (sabb'upadhipatinissagga).\\"Bodhi (1999), ch. 3.

(Rudolph) Lewis Teague (November 30, 1917 in Jamaica, New York ‚Äì April 14, 1978 Fayston, Vermont) was an American painter from the Second Generation New York School.  Biography  Rudolph Lewis Teague was born November 30, 1917 in Jamaica, Queens, a neighborhood in the New York City to Cecilia Fehon Teague and Walter Dorwin Teague, he was their youngest son. He attended P.S. 1 (now known as P.S. 001 Alfred E. Smith) elementary school, then Gow School for Dyslexia and Learning Disabilities (now known as The Gow School) boarding school in Upstate New York. Teague was left-handed and while he was attending the Gow School, he learn to write with his right hand, at least partially. Teague married fellow Art Student's League painter, Mary Lee Abbott in 1943, while home on leave from the United States Army, where he served as a gunnery sergeant at a range in New Mexico. Teague left the Army in 1945 at the end of the war, and he and Abbott separated in 1946. Teague attended Pratt Institute briefly to study architecture but, while in New Mexico on a painting excursion near Taos, instructor Tom Benrimo told the architecture student that he had a \\"painters eye\\", and perhaps he should focus on painting, instead. Teague took his Benrimo's advice, and returned to the Art Students League of New York, where he met and fell in love with Virginia Grinnell Vanderbilt. At the Art Students League of New York he found Morris Kantor as a mentor and teacher. In 1948, Teague contracted polio affecting his thigh and stomach muscles, as well as losing the use of his left arm, his painting hand. Following a long recovery from which he was not expected to survive let alone learn to walk again. He and Mary Abbott finalized their divorced early in 1950, and he and Virginia Vanderbilt were married in May 1950. Learning to walk following the serious bout with polio, Teague and his wife Virginia Vanderbilt left New York City and moved to Norwich, Vermont in 1954. Together they raised four children in Vermont. Teague learned to paint and draw again, in his studio in Norwich, this time using his right hand. In 1959, Teague was photographed by Hanson Carroll for Life magazine. He delivered a body of work that was shown at the New York World's Fair in the Gas Pavilion restaurant in 1960, at the Port Authority in 1964, and through the Bermuda Society of Arts in Bermuda, with Henry Moore in 1965.  Death and legacy  Teague died in 1978. Numerous shows in Vermont and New York City punctuated his career - however he had a reclusive lifestyle and did not show his work as much as other artists. A show was held posthumously in 1983 at the Unicorn Gallery in Aspen, Colorado, from artwork found in a barn by his nephew. From that exhibition, his work purchased in its entirety by a single Texas collector. It is unknown what happened to these, some 22, paintings which include some of Teague's most definitive pieces of abstract expressionist and color field paintings. Teague leaves a remaining legacy of paintings and drawings that have essentially not seen the light of day since his death.

Renunciation (or renouncing) is the act of rejecting something, especially if it is something that the renunciant has previously enjoyed or endorsed. In religion, renunciation often indicates an abandonment of pursuit of material comforts, in the interests of achieving spiritual enlightenment. It is highly practiced in Jainism. In Hinduism, the renounced order of life is sannyƒÅsa; in Buddhism, the Pali word for \\"renunciation\\" is nekkhamma, conveying more specifically \\"giving up the world and leading a holy life\\" or \\"freedom from lust, craving and desires\\".Rhys Davids & Stede (1921-25), p. 377, entry for \\"Nekkhamma\\" (retrieved 2008-04-12). Rhys Davids & Stede speculate that the Sanskrit term with which nekkhamma is associated is either: :* naikramya -- \\"inactivity, abstinence or exemption from acts and their consequences\\" (Monier Williams, 1964, p. 570, entry for \\"Naish\\") :* naikƒÅmya -- \\"suppression of desire, profound contemplation\\" (ibid.). See Sangha, Bhikkhu, Bhikkhuni, ≈örama·πáa. In Christianity, some denominations have a tradition of renunciation of the Devil. Renunciation of citizenship is the formal process by which a person voluntarily relinquishes the status of citizen of a specific country. A person can also renounce property, as when a person submits a disclaimer of interest in property that has been left to them in a will. Mahatma Gandhi It is widely believed in India that voluntary renunciation is how one gains power, for whatever purpose. In South Africa (1893-1915) Gandhi tried many spiritual practices and experiments, almost all of them including a component of renunciation, based in the practice of Sannyasi. After reading Unto This Last by John Ruskin in 1904 he redoubled his commitment to gain greater control over self, increasing his capacity to work for the common welfare and find a greater sense of oneness with others. The ultimate renunciation is of self, one's separateness from others and the world. Christianity In some Christian denominations, renunciation of the Devil is a common liturgical rubric. This is most often seen in connection with the sacrament of baptism. In the Roman Catholic church a baptism usually contains the \\"Prayer of Exorcism\\". Later in the ceremony, the parents and godparents are asked to publicly renounce the devil. The Church of England dismissed this rubric in a 2014 renewal of liturgy. According to The Independent, this was done in an attempt to \\"widen the appeal\\" of the rite. A prior report for the Church's Liturgical Commission stated that \\"[f]or the majority of those attending, the existing provision can seem complex and inaccessible.\\" In the Church of Norway, the public renunciation of the Devil is an obligatory element in the Main Service. It is stated by the congregation before the profession of faith (usually the Apostles' Creed, as the Nicene Creed is largely reserved for special observances). When performed in a service which includes a baptism, it is also considered an extension of the testimony given by the sponsors, as they are required to confess to a denomination which does not rejects the Apostles' or the Nicene Creed, nor rejects infant baptism.https://kirken.no/globalassets/kirken.no/om-troen/liturgier- oversatt/the-order-of-the-principal-service.pdf \\"The Order of the Principal Service\\", as derived from \\"The Service Book for the Church of Norway\\".

The event is the richest sprint race in autumn in Adelaide with $1,000,000 in prize money. The race was a principal race until 1980 when it was granted Group 1 status. In the years between 1881-1885 the distance was one mile. The race has always attracted high calibre sprinters. Recently such champions as Black Caviar and Takeover Target have won the race who have gone on to win overseas. Two horses have won the race twice with Mostyn (1894‚Äì95) and Musket Belle (1911‚Äì12). Aurie's Star which won the race in 1940, had in previous seasons taken out the Oakleigh Plate twice and the VRC Newmarket Handicap. =Records= The leading trainer with five wins is Walter Hickenbotham and they were achieved in the first decade of the twentieth century (1901, 1902, 1906, 1909, 1910).

It is widely regarded as the national bird of Peru. It has four subspecies and its closest relative is the Guianan cock-of- the-rock. The Andean cock-of-the-rock exhibits marked sexual dimorphism; the male has a large disk-like crest and scarlet or brilliant orange plumage, while the female is significantly darker and browner. Gatherings of males compete for breeding females with each male displaying its colourful plumage, bobbing and hopping, and making a variety of calls. After mating, the female makes a nest under a rocky overhang, incubates the eggs, and rears the young by herself. The Andean cock-of-the-rock eats a diet of fruit, supplemented by insects, amphibians, reptiles, and smaller mice. It is distributed all across the cloud forest of the Andes, having a range of around . Even though it is being affected by destruction of its habitat, the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not classified as threatened. Taxonomy and etymology One of two species in the genus Rupicola, the other being the Guianan cock-of-the-rock, the Andean cock-of-the-rock was first described by English ornithologist John Latham in 1790. It is classified in the Cotingidae, a family of largely frugivorous tropical forest suboscine passerines. The generic name is derived from the Latin stems rupes \\"rock\\" or \\"cliff\\", and cola \\"inhabiting\\", and is derived from its habit of nesting in rock walls. Its specific epithet peruvianus \\"of Peru\\" is masculine despite the -a ending of the genus name (in Latin, names in -cola were masculine or neuter); peruviana is seen in older works. Four subspecies are known: * R. p. peruvianus ‚Äì (Latham, 1790), nominate subspecies * R. p. aequatorialis ‚Äì Taczanowski, 1889 * R. p. sanguinolentus ‚Äì Gould, 1859 * R. p. saturatus ‚Äì Cabanis and Heine, 1859 Description Immature male at the Cincinnati Zoo, USA The Andean cock-of-the-rock is a large passerine, approximately long and weighing around , although males are somewhat larger and the heaviest specimens can reach . The bird is one of many bird species to exhibit marked sexual dimorphism. The male has a large disk-like crest and brilliant scarlet or orange plumage. It has black tail and wings, and pale greyish scapulars. The female is significantly drabber and browner than the male and has a less prominent crest. The bill is yellowish in the male, and dark with a small yellow tip in the female. Depending on gender and subspecies there are significant variations in the color of the iris, ranging from red over orange and yellow to bluish-white in the male, and whitish over reddish to brown in the female. In addition to the display calls described in the breeding section below, foraging birds give a loud querulous ‚Äútank?‚Äù when disturbed or in flight. Distribution and habitat The Andean cock-of-the- rock is distributed in cloud forests of the Andes. It lives in a large range of about across Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Per√∫, and Bolivia, mostly in ravines and forested streams in montane areas at elevation. It typically stays in the lower and middle forest levels, but will range higher in fruiting trees and will sometimes enter and cross clearings. It is generally shy and inconspicuous, often seen only briefly after being flushed out or while swiftly flying down a valley. R. p. aequatorialis is the most widespread subspecies, ranging across the Andes of East Colombia to West Venezuela, East Ecuador and East Peru. The nominate subspecies, R. p. peruvianus has a small range stretching only through the Andes of Central Peru. R. p. sanguinolentus ranges throughout the Andes in West Colombia to Northwest Ecuador. The subspecies R. p. saturatus has a range across Southeast Peru and West Bolivia. Behavior =Food and feeding= The diet consists mainly of fruit and insects, although small reptiles and frogs have been recorded. The fruits consumed are often from the plant families Lauraceae, Annonaceae, and Rubiaceae, although a few other plant families have also been reported in their diet. They are one of many species recorded following army ants. They occasionally will eat high protein fruits, but they prefer to eat the other fruits on their menu. =Breeding= Detail of the male head plumage Male cocks-of-the-rock are polygamous, and have nothing to do with nesting once mating is done. The male's energy instead is devoted to very elaborate display rituals that show off its magnificent plumage. These displays take place in communal leks, where males gather to challenge rivals and beckon the females. The males are easily disturbed, so their behavior is not easy to see. One study reported that the display activity is dependent on light intensity, with the morning display period occurring during the same light intensity level as the afternoon period. Male Andean cock-of-the-rock choosing the best lekking position At the lek, males have been observed to break up into pairs, performing ‚Äúconfrontation displays‚Äù. This consists of facing each other while bowing, jumping, and flapping their wings, sometimes even snapping their bills, and at the same time giving off various squawking and grunting calls. When the female approaches, it becomes even more intense. The display turns into a cacophony of bright color and a frenzied activity filling the air with very strange sounds. Breeding takes place during different times of year in different areas. In Colombia, breeding normally happens in February until July. In Ecuador, the breeding interval spans from July until February. =Nesting= The nests, built entirely by the female, are mud plastered to cave entrances or rocky outcrops in forest ravines. The nests are often constructed from the saliva of the females mixed in with vegetable matter and mud. The nest is shaped like a concave cup. The female typically lays two white eggs. The females incubates these eggs for about 25 to 28 days. =Impact on environment= Andean cocks-of-the-rocks influence the environment around them. It was found that a white-capped dipper renovated an abandoned cock-of-the-rock nest to lay its eggs in. Cock-of-the-rocks also change the surrounding flora through seed dispersal. Seeds that the birds ingest often are found deposited around lek and nesting sites. This favors the germination and growth of those seeds. The diversity of these types of seeds has been found to be increased at lek and nests and decreased throughout the surrounding forest. =Predators= Andean cocks-of-the-rock face slightly larger predators than smaller songbirds. Predators are attracted to leks by the conspicuous behavior of the displaying males. The animals reported to prey on adult cocks-of-the-rock include hawk-eagles, forest-falcons, bald eagles, golden eagles, other hawks, owls, jaguar, mountain lion, ocelot and the boa constrictor. Relationship with humans The Andean cock-of-the-rock is regarded as the national bird of Peru. Juveniles and adults have occasionally been used as pets. =Conservation= The worldwide population size and trends in population numbers have not been determined, but it is believed that the Andean cock-of-the-rock is not threatened. The species is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species despite habitat destruction. It is patchily distributed, but its range is large enough to sustain it at a Least Concern status.

In addition to the centromere, one or more secondary constrictions can be observed in some chromosomes at metaphase. These chromosomes are called satellite chromosomes. In humans it is usually associated with the short arm of an acrocentric chromosome, such as in the chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21 and 22. The Y chromosome can also contain satellites, although these are thought to be translocations from autosomes. The secondary constriction always keeps its position, so it can be used as markers to identify specific chromosomes. The name derives from the small chromosomal segment behind the secondary constriction, called a satellite, named by Sergei Navashin, in 1912. Later, Heitz (1931) qualified the secondary constriction as the SAT state (Sine Acido Thymonucleico, which means \\"without thymonucleic acid\\"), because it didn't stain with the Feulgen reaction. With time, the term \\"SAT-chromosome\\" simply became a synonym and also an abbreviation for satellite chromosome.Battaglia, E.. (1999). The chromosome satellite (Navashin's \\"sputnik\\" or satelles): A terminological comment. Acta biologica Cracoviensia. Series botanica. 41. 15-18. The satellite at metaphase appears to be attached to the chromosomes by a thread of chromatin. SAT-chromosomes whose secondary constriction is associated with the formation of the nucleolus are referred to as nucleolar SAT-chromosomes. There are at least 4 SAT chromosomes in each diploid nucleus, and the constriction corresponds to a nucleolar organizer (NOR), a region containing multiple copies of the 18S and 28S ribosomal genes that synthesize ribosomal RNA required by ribosomes. The appearance of secondary constrictions at NORs is thought to be due to rRNA transcription and/or structural features of the nucleolus impeding chromosome condensation.

The species are endemic to New South Wales in Australia. In 2015 it was found that genus Epacris is paraphyletic to Rupicola and Budawangia, and proposed to merge species into Epacris. The species are heaths of limited distributions, found in cliff habitats in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales. Their growth habits vary from decumbent or pendulous to more erect. Their flowers are white with short tubes and five lobes, and are, like in other Epacrids, carried singly in leaf axils near the ends of the stems. Etymology The name Rupicola is formed from \\"rupes-is, a cliff, and cola, an inhabitant\\". Taxonomy and systematics Rupicola was established as a monotypic genus by Joseph Maiden and Ernst Betche in 1898 containing the single species Rupicola sprengelioides. Though it has some features in common with Prionotes and Sprengelia, they noted that the new species \\"strikingly resembles the Tasmanian Epacris mucronulata, R.Br.\\" They placed it adjacent to Epacris in tribe Epacrideae, an affinity that was supported by Watson in 1967 and Powell in 1987. In 1927, Summerhayes described a second species Rupicola gnidioides. Ian Telford in 1992 revised the genus. He removed R. gnidioides to a new genus Budawangia. Two new species were described ‚Äì Rupicola ciliata and Rupicola decumbens ‚Äì plus Epacris apiculata was considered to be mis-classified and was moved from Epacris to Rupicola. Members of Rupicola were distinguished by having their stamens inserted at the base of the corolla, in contrast to those of Epacris and Budawangia, which have them attached at the mouth of the corolla tube. Budawangia gnidioides has hypogynous swellings which \\"appear to have no nectary function\\", and Rupicola species have no nectary structures. In Epacris the species generally have well-developed nectary scales. In Rupicola, the anthers open with a short apical slit, unlike most members of Epacridoideae which form a full-length slit. In other subfamilies the anthers open with a short slit or a pore. In the latter 1990s, Crayn et al. compared sequences for the plastid gene rbcL and suggested that Epacris may be paraphyletic to Rupicola and Budawangia. In 2015, Quinn et al. studied 45 morphological characteristics along with genetic indels from the plastid atpB‚ÄìrbcL non-coding region. They found that the two smaller genera together formed a group within Epacris, and that although there were discernible clades in Epacris, none were \\"readily recognisable on morphological features\\", hence there was no cause to split it into smaller genera along cladistic lines. The authors point out that in the Ericaceae family more widely, stamen filaments attached to the corolla tube have arisen independently multiple times, that attachment may be weak, and that reversion to the original plesiomorphic state is not uncommon. In their analyses, the Rupicola‚ÄìBudawangia group was related to E. calvertiana, E. coriacea, E. gunnii, E. microphylla, and E. purpurascens. They proposed moving all five species into Epacris. The epithet ciliata is already occupied by Epacris ciliata (R.Br.) Poir. (1812), so a new name for Rupicola ciliata was given: Epacris pilosa Crowden 2015. For the three other species which had not previously been members of Epacris, new combinations were proposed with co-author Elizabeth Anne Brown as the taxonomic authority. Thus the concepts for Rupicola have been: * Rupicola Maiden & Betche 1898: R. sprengelioides Maiden & Betche. * Rupicola Summerhayes 1927: R. sprengelioides Maiden & Betche, R. gnidioides Summerh. * Rupicola Telford 1992: R. sprengelioides Maiden & Betche, R. apiculata (A.Cunn.)

Although it has since been supplanted by the longer and more in-depth documentary Beatles Anthology, The Compleat Beatles was for many years largely regarded as the definitive film about the Beatles. Narrated by actor Malcolm McDowell, it includes extensive interviews with a number of sources close to the Beatles. Some of the people interviewed are producer George Martin, their first manager Allan Williams, Cavern Club DJ Bob Wooler, music writer Bill Harry, and musicians Gerry Marsden, Billy J. Kramer, Marianne Faithfull, Billy Preston, Lenny Kaye, and Tony Sheridan. The film also includes archival footage of interviews with members of the Beatles and their manager Brian Epstein. Authors Nicholas Schaffner and Wilfrid Mellers are among the commentators who offer their views on the band's career. The Compleat Beatles also features early concert footage, behind-the-scenes background on the making of their albums, and candid footage of their often obsessed, hysterical fans. Directed by Patrick Montgomery, the film was produced by Delilah Films/Electronic Arts Pictures and released theatrically by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and United Artists in 1984. Video Releases The Compleat Beatles was initially released as a PBS documentary in the United States, and then on VHS, Betamax, CED and Laserdisc that same year on the MGM/UA Home Video label. The 1982 Laserdisc was released in both Analogue and Stereo versions, as well as being released in Japan and England (in PAL format) in 1983. The film did very well, and in 1984 Delilah Films and Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer arranged for it to be released theatrically in the U.S. by a small distributor named Teleculture. This contributed to its continuing to be a best seller on VHS. Some years later, when Paul McCartney was preparing The Beatles Anthology, he bought the negative and all the rights to the film from Delilah to get it off of the market and clear the way for his production. That, according to the film's director Patrick Montgomery, is why it is not available on DVD or any newer formats and \\"probably never will be.\\" References External links * 1982 films American films English-language films Rockumentaries American documentary films 1980s documentary films Documentary films about the Beatles The Beatles and television ","title":"The Compleat Beatles"},{"id":"4964198","text":"The South Australian Derby is a South Australian Jockey Club Group 1 Thoroughbred horse race for three-year-olds, at set weights, run over a distance of 2,500 metres at Morphettville Racecourse in Adelaide, Australia during the SAJC Autumn Carnival. History The inaugural running of the race was on 5 January 1860 at Thebarton Racecourse which is located today in Mile End. The race was called The Thebarton Derby and had stakes of 100 sovereigns with an additional sweep of 10 sovereigns with a forfeit of 2 sovereigns. The race was won by the famous colonial pastoralist C.B. Fisher's, four-year-old mare Midnight who carried 8 stone 10 pounds and ridden by jockey Simpson in a time of 2:54. By 1862 the race was simply known as The Derby and in 1866 the Summer meet was held before Christmas Day. For a period of seven years between 1869 and 1875 the race was not held. When the race was resumed in 1876 it was held at Morphettville Racecourse and it was held in September during the SAJC Spring meeting. The early winner Tim Whiffler is not to be confused with the 1867 Melbourne Cup winner of the same name. The race attracted many fine horses who would later excel in other prestigious races around the country. 1880 saw The Assyrian, a son of Countryman (GB) win the race and two years later win the Melbourne Cup. 1903 saw the simply named F.J.A. prevail and the son of Wallace would also win a VRC Derby, Toorak Handicap and The All Aged Stakes. 1961 winner Gatum Gatum also went on to win the Melbourne Cup in 1963 while the 1972 winner Dayana was a Perth Cup winner in 1973. Subzero won the race in 1992 and he would win the Melbourne Cup on a wet track the next season, and also the G1 Adelaide Cup. The 2009 winner Rebel Raider succeeded after earlier he won the VRC Derby. Fillies have also had some success in the race.

State Road 82 (SR 82) is a 29-mile-long east- west highway serving northern Lee and Collier County, Florida (and \\"clipping\\" the southwest corner of Hendry County). The western terminus is an intersection with Cleveland Avenue (US 41-SR 45, part of the Tamiami Trail) in Fort Myers; the eastern terminus is an intersection with SR 29 midway between Immokalee and Felda. Route description West of Interstate 75 (SR 93), State Road 82 is a divided residential/commuter road. Within the city of Fort Myers, it is known as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Near Lehigh Acres, SR 82 intersects Daniels Parkway and Gunnery Road at a continuous-flow intersection. East of this intersection, SR 82 loses its median and becomes a two-lane agricultural road as it crosses the southwest Florida farmlands and wetlands, a part of Big Cypress Swamp and the western edge of the Everglades drainage system. Though, it briefly becomes a four-lane divided roadway again in its short segment in Hendry County. Motorists continuing past the western terminus of State Road 82 travel along McGregor Boulevard (SR 867). Other State Roads within a few blocks of the western terminus include SR 80 (western terminus located two blocks to the north) and SR 739-Business US 41 to the east. History The route was designated State Road 184 until 1945, when it was changed to State Road 82 as part of a state-wide renumbering. Until the 1980s, SR 82 was an \\"interrupted\\" state road, for there was concurrently a Fort Lauderdale street (Davie Boulevard) with SR 82 signage. As part of a statewide renumbering, Davie Boulevard's SR 82 signage was replaced with signs showing its current designation, SR 736. Prior to 1991, SR 82 was known as Anderson Avenue within Fort Myers before being changed to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard. Anderson Avenue was named for Dr. Richard Anderson, who is believed to be the first physician to set up a practice and drug store in Fort Myers. Future The two-lane undivided section between Lehigh Acres and Immokalee has been notorious for many fatal high-speed crashes. The Florida Department of Transportation is gradually widening the remaining two-lane undivided segments. Construction to widen SR 82 from Colonial/Lee Boulevard to Shawnee Road to six lanes was completed in 2019. This project upgraded the Daniels Parkway/Gunnery Road intersection to Florida's first continuous-flow intersection (CFI), which was opened July 9, 2019. Construction to widen the road from Shawnee Road to the Lee/Hendry County Line to four lanes is also underway.

Modern borders are in red. The Hausa Kingdom, also known as Hausa Kingdoms or Hausaland,Lapidus, Ira M. A History of Islamic Societies. 3rd ed. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press, 2014. pg 458-459 was a collection of states started by the Hausa people, situated between the Niger River and Lake Chad (modern day northern Nigeria). Hausaland lay between the Western Sudanic kingdoms of Ancient Ghana and Mali and the Eastern Sudanic kingdoms of Kanem-Bornu. Hausaland took shape as a political and cultural region during the first millennium CE as a result of the westward expansion of Hausa peoples. They arrived to Hausaland when the terrain was converting from woodlands to savannah. They started cultivating grains, which led to a denser peasant population. They had a common language, laws, and customs. The Hausa were known for fishing, hunting, agriculture, salt-mining, and blacksmithing. By the 14th century Kano had become the most powerful city-state. Kano had become the base for the trans-Saharan trade in salt, cloth, leather, and grain. The Hausa oral history is reflected in the Bayajidda legend, which describes the adventures of the Baghdadi hero Bayajidda culminating in the killing of the snake in the well of Daura and the marriage with the local queen Magajiya Daurama. According to the legend, the hero had a child with the queen, Bawo, and another child with the queen's maid-servant, Karbagari. Though the Hausa states shared the same lineage, language and culture, the states were characterized by fierce rivalries with each other with each state seeking supremacy over the others. They constantly waged war on each other and would often work with invaders to the detriment of their sister states, hindering their collective strength. Palmer, ', III, 132-4; Smith, Daura, 52-55 Mythology According to the Bayajidda legend, the Hausa states were founded by the sons and grandsons of Bayajidda, a prince whose origin differs by tradition but official canon records him as the person who married Daurama, the last Kabara of Daura, and heralded the end of the matriarchal monarchs that had erstwhile ruled the Hausa people. According to the most famous version of the story, the story of the hausa states started with a prince from Baghdad called \\"Abu Yazid\\". When he got to Daura, he went to the house of an old woman and asked her to give him water but she told him the predicament of the land, how the only well in daura called kusugu was inhabited by a snake called Sarki, who allowed citizens of daura to fetch water only on Fridays. Since \\"Sarki\\" is the Hausa word for \\"King\\", this may have been a metaphor for a powerful figure. Bayajidda killed Sarki and because of what he had done the queen married him for his bravery. After his marriage to the queen the people started to call him Bayajidda which means \\"he didn't understand (the language) before \\". =Banza Bakwai= According to the Bayajidda legend, the Banza Bakwai states were founded by the seven sons of Karbagari (\\"Town-seizer\\"), the son of Bayajidda and the slave-maid, Bagwariya. They are called the Banza Bakwai meaning Bastard or Bogus Seven on account of their ancestress' slave status. *Zamfara (state inhabited by Hausa-speakers) *Kebbi (state inhabited by Hausa-speakers) *Yauri (also called Yawuri) *Gwari (also called Gwariland) *Kwararafa (the state of the Jukun people) *Nupe (state of the Nupe people) =Hausa Bakwai= The Hausa Kingdoms began as seven states founded according to the Bayajidda legend by the six sons of Bawo and himself, the son of the hero and Magajiya Daurama in addition to the hero's son, Biram or Ibrahim, of an earlier marriage. The states included only kingdoms inhabited by Hausa- speakers: *Daura: *Kano: *Katsina *Zaria (Zazzau) *Gobir *Rano *Biram:(Hadejia) Since the beginning of Hausa history, the seven states of Hausaland divided up production and labor activities in accordance with their location and natural resources. Kano and Rano were known as the \\"Chiefs of Indigo.\\" Cotton grew readily in the great plains of these states, and they became the primary producers of cloth, weaving and dying it before sending it off in caravans to the other states within Hausaland and to extensive regions beyond. Biram was the original seat of government, while Zaria supplied labor and was known as the \\"Chief of Slaves.\\" Katsina and Daura were the \\"Chiefs of the Market,\\" as their geographical location accorded them direct access to the caravans coming across the desert from the north. Gobir, located in the west, was the \\"Chief of War\\" and was mainly responsible for protecting the empire from the invasive Kingdoms of Ghana and Songhai. Zenith The Hausa Kingdoms were first mentioned by Ya'qubi in the 9th century and they were by the 15th century vibrant trading centers competing with Kanem-Bornu and the Mali Empire.Hogben/Kirk-Greene, Emirates, 82-88; Lange, Kingdoms, 216-221, 554 n. 25. The primary exports were slaves, leather, gold, cloth, salt, kola nuts, animal hides, and henna. At various moments in their history, the Hausa managed to establish central control over their states, but such unity has always proven short. In the 11th century the conquests initiated by Gijimasu of Kano culminated in the birth of the first united Hausa Nation under Queen Amina, the Sultana of Zazzau but severe rivalries between the states led to periods of domination by major powers like the Songhai and Kanem. During the reign of King Yaji I (1349‚Äì85) Islam was first introduced to Kano. Many Muslim traders and clerics used to come from Mali, from the Volta region, and later from Songhay. King Yaji appointed a Qadi and Imam as part of the state administration. Muhammad Rumfa (1463‚Äì99) built mosques and madrassahs. He also commissioned Muhammad al-Maghili to write a treatise on Muslim governance. Many other scholars were brought in from Egypt, Tunis, and Morocco. This turned Kano into a center of Muslim scholarship. Islamization facilitated the expansion of trade and was the basis of an enlarged marketing network. The 'Ulama provided legal support, guarantees, safe conducts, introductions and many other services. By the end of the fifteenth century, Muhammad al-Korau, a cleric, took control of Katsina declaring himself king. 'Ulama were later brought in from North Africa and Egypt to reside in Katsina. An 'Ulama class emerged under royal patronage. The Hausa rulers fasted Ramadan, built mosques, kept up the five obligatory prayers, and gave alms (zakat) to the poor. Ibrahim Maje (1549‚Äì66) was an Islamic reformer and instituted Islamic marriage law in Katsina. Generally Hausaland remained divided between the Muslim cosmopolitan urban elite and the local animistic rural communities. Fall Hausa-Fulani Sokoto Caliphate in the 19th century Despite relatively constant growth from the 15th century to the 18th century, the states were vulnerable to constant war internally and externally. By the Eighteenth century they were economically and politically exhausted. Famines became very common during this period and the Sultans engaged in heavy taxation to fund their wars. Though the vast majority of its inhabitants were Muslim, by the 19th century, they were conquered by a mix of Fulani warriors and Hausa peasantry, citing syncretism and social injustices. By 1808 the Hausa states were finally conquered by Usuman dan Fodio and incorporated into the Hausa-Fulani Sokoto Caliphate.Smith, Daura, 419-421. References  Bibliography  * Hogben, S.

It has a cylindrical and fleshy stem with fragile succulent twigs that are 7 mm thick, often produced in whorls, longitudinally, finely striated. The oval leaves are 1 to 2.5 cm long and about 3 to 4 mm wide; they usually fall off early. It contains a milky, toxic and corrosive sap. The yellow flowers are at the ends of the branches.Wolfgang Franke: Agricultural crops. Usable crops of temperate latitudes, subtropics and tropics . 6th, revised and expanded edition. Thieme, Stuttgart 1997, Habitat It has a wide distribution in Africa in black clay soils, being prominently present in northeastern, central and southern Africa. It may also be native in other parts of the continent as well as some surrounding islands and the Arabian peninsula and has been introduced to many other tropical regions, such as Brazil, India, Vietnam, the Philippines and Ghana. It grows in dry areas, especially the savanna, and is often used to feed cattle or as hedging. It is well known in Sri Lanka where it is called Kalli in Tamil, as mentioned in the Akananuru by the Sri Lankan Tamil poet Eelattu Poothanthevanar and in Weradi Navahandi or Gass Nawahandi.Ayurveda Plants of Sri Lanka Toxicology The milky latex from E. tirucalli is extremely irritating to the skin and mucosa and is toxic. Exposure to it can cause blindness. Skin contact causes severe irritation, redness and a burning sensation. If ingested, it can cause burns to the mouth, lips and tongue. It is suggested to wear eye protection gear and gloves for handling the plant. Traditional medicine Euphorbia tirucalli is used as alternative medicine in many cultures. Attempts have been made to use it to treat cancer, excrescence, tumors, warts, asthma, cough, earache, neuralgia, rheumatism, and toothaches in countries including Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Malaysia Tumbuhan-tumbuhan perubatan herba, P.13.Euphorbia tirucalli L. in Handbook of Energy Crops, James Duke Euphorbia tirucalli has been promoted as an anticancer agent, but research shows that it suppresses the immune system, promotes tumor growth, and leads to the development of certain types of cancer. Euphorbia tirucalli has also been associated with Burkitt's lymphoma and is thought to be a cofactor of the disease rather than a treatment. Uses Its latex can also be used as fuel. This led chemist Melvin Calvin to propose the exploitation of E. tirucalli for producing oil. This usage is particularly appealing because of the ability of E. tirucalli to grow on land that is not suitable for most other crops. Calvin estimated that 10 to 50 barrels of oil per acre was achievable. In the 1980s the Brazilian national petroleum company Petrobras began experiments based these ideas. It has also been used in the production of rubber, but neither have been very successful.

It manifests itself as a woman, usually young and beautiful, with her internal organs hanging down from the neck, trailing below the head. According to Thai ethnographer Phraya Anuman Rajadhon, the Krasue consists of a floating head accompanied by a will-o'-the-wisp kind of luminescent glow.Essays on Thai Folklore, Editions Duang Kamol, The explanations attempted about the origin of the glow include the presence of methane in marshy areas.Mthai News Reporter The 'Krasue is often said to live in the same areas as Krahang, a male spirit of the Thai folklore. This spirit moves about by hovering in the air above the ground, for it has no lower body. The throat may be represented in different ways, either as only the trachea or with the whole neck.Krasue film posters The organs below the head usually include the heart and the stomach with a length of intestine,Movie poster the intestinal tract emphasizing the ghost's voracious nature. In the Thai movie Krasue Valentine, this ghost is represented with more internal organs, such as lungs and liver, but much reduced in size and anatomically out of proportion with the head.Krasue representation The viscera are sometimes represented freshly daubed with blood,Krasue Sao book cover as well as glowing.Glowing Krasue In contemporary representations her teeth often include pointed fangs in yakkha () or vampire fashion.Krasue Sawath (\\"‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏≤‡∏ó\\"), Thai dubbed version of Hong Kong movie \\"Witch with the Flying Head\\" film poster In the movie Ghosts of Guts Eater she has a halo around her head.Ghosts of Guts Eater scene Krasue has been the subject of a number of movies in the region, including My Mother is Arb (). Also known as Krasue Mom, this Cambodian horror film has the distinction of being the first movie made in the People's Republic of Kampuchea after the absence of locally-made movies and the repression of local folklore in Cambodia during the Khmer Rouge era.Konm Eak Madia Arb film poster The Krasue is also found in the popular mythology of Malaysia, where it is called as the balan-balan, penanggalan or hantu penanggal, and also in Indonesia where it has many names such as Leyak, Palasik, Selaq Metem, Kuyang, Poppo, and Parakang. This spirit is also part of Vietnamese folklore as ma lai via the minority ethnic groups of Vietnam's Central Highlands. In the Philippines there is a similar ghost, manananggal, a local spirit that haunts pregnant women. The spirit has also been referred to in many social media videos making it a \\"scary monster\\" on social media. Legends =Origin= Belief in the existence of the Krasue is shared across Southeast Asia, and its origin is difficult to verify. However, it likely originates from folklore. In Thailand, the Krasue is believed to be a cursed individual (usually a female) who engaged in various sins and fraudulent conducts during her previous life. After she dies, her sins causes her to be reborn as a phuti () that has to live off wasted, uncooked or rotten food. In recent time, the Thai entertainment industry has fictionalized the origin of Krasue as a cursed ancient Khmer princess, as in Demonic Beauty (2002). This depiction is, however, merely an attempt to put a royal touch or to reinvent a mythical beginning to a well-known story of an essentially folk origin, for strictly entertainment and commercial purpose. One critic notes that the director of Demonic Beauty probably just wanted to depict \\"Krasue\\" as an evil and an alien demon, originating from the witchcraft and black magic of a foreign (i.e. Cambodian's) pagan culture, which is ultimately subdued and defeated by the more-enlightened Buddhist culture of Thailand.Tamnan Krasue There are other oral traditions that say that this spirit was formerly a rich lady that had a length of black gauze or ribbon tied around the head and neck as protection from the sunshine. This woman was then possessed by an evil spirit and was cursed to become a Krasue. Other popular legends claim that origin of the spirit may have been a woman trying to learn black magic that made a mistake or used the wrong spell so that her head and body became separated. Past sins are also related to the transmission of the Krasue curse; women who aborted or killed someone in a previous life will become a Krasue as punishment. Other folk stories talk about a person being cursed to become a Krasue after having consumed food and drink contaminated with a krasue's saliva or flesh. Popular imagination also claims that the transformation into a Krasue is largely restricted to the relatives of women practicing witchcraft \\"Mae Mot\\" (‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏°‡∏î) or \\"Yai Mot\\" (‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏°‡∏î), especially their daughters or granddaughters. Often women acting strange in a community are suspected of becoming nightly a Krasue by other members of the village.Yeay Duol =Description in Thai folklore= The Krasue is under a curse that makes it ever hungry and always active in the night when it goes out hunting to satisfy its gluttony, seeking blood to drink or raw flesh to devour. It may attack cattle or chicken in the darkness, drinking their blood and eating their internal organs.Honourable Mention: The Ghost and Master Boh It may also prey on pieces of cattle, such as water buffalo that have died of other causes during the night. If blood is not available the Krasue may eat feces or carrion.Krasue feeding Clothes left outside would be found soiled with blood and excrement in the morning, allegedly after she had wiped her mouth. Therefore, villagers would not leave clothes hanging to dry outside during the night hours. In order to protect pregnant women from becoming victims before delivery, their relatives place thorny branches around the house. This improvised thorny fence discourages the Krasue from coming to suck the blood and causing other suffering to the pregnant woman within the house. After delivery, the woman's relatives must take the cut placenta far away for burial to hide it from the Krasue. There is the belief that if the placenta is buried deep enough the spirit can not find it. The Krasue hides the headless body from which it originates in a quiet place because it needs to join it before daybreak,Krasue emerging from its body living like a normal person during the day, although having a sleepy look.Fullmoon Devil To crush the still headless body of the krasue is fatal to the spirit. The flying head will return after hunting but rejoin with the wrong body which will lead it to suffer torment until death. If the top part of the body fails to find the lower half before daybreak it will die in terrible pain. The Krasue will also die if its intestines get cut off or if its body disappears or gets hidden by someone. Some folk beliefs hold that the creature can be destroyed by burning it. The main foes of the Krasue are mobs of angry villagers carrying torches and machetes. They may catch the Krasue and kill it or watch where she goes before dawn and destroy her body. There is a legend said that the people who are wounded should be aware of the Krasue because it can smell the blood and will come to eat the blood at night when people fall asleep. However, there are ways to prevent the Krasue from coming inside the house. House-owners usually build spiky fences or grow spiky bamboo to protect themselves from the Krasue. Krasue is scared of spiky things because its intestine might get stuck and it could not escape.3\\\\. tumnandd. ‡∏ú‡∏µ‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏™‡∏∑‡∏≠ ‡∏ô‡∏±‡∏Å‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ï‡∏ï‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏•. tamnandd.com. [Online] 2010. =21st century sightings= * On the night of 22 July 2008, about 11:27 p.m, CCTV footage of a lemonade factory in Nong Suea District, Pathum Thani Province captured quite clearly an alleged Krasue. The Krasue appears near one side of the factory wall adjacent to the field. When a smartphone's camera was used to take a shot of the CCTV footage in order to zoom at it closer, an old woman living alone in that area was seen in the image. Local people insist that they see strange lights and hear strange sounds at night for about a year. However, when the old woman seen in the image died, sightings of the Krasue reportedly stopped. Asst. Prof. Dr. Chawan Koopipat, an expert in photography and video technology from Chulalongkorn University checked the CCTV footage and determined that it was not edited. According to the professor, the Krasue in the CCTV footage probably was a result of the lighting, which has movement on the upper part and reflecting on the bottom wet and damp area of the land that was not farmed giving the illusion of a Krasue. * Strange red lights floating up the paddy fields in the area of Phachi District, Ayutthaya Province, near Wat Tako were sighted in mid-June 2014 and was believed to be from a Krasue. Soon after, hundreds of teenagers (in some nights ranging to thousands) flocked in the area reportedly to prove the truth. This has caused damage to this field. The landlord insists that there are no Krasue here and the lights seen were actually a floating lantern bird chaser. * In September 2015, one image was shared on online social networks allegedly shot at Ban Phai village, in the area of Chae Hom District, Lampang Province, depicting a Krasue that has guts and internal organs trapped with thorny branches. However, the villagers denied the report and clarified that there was no village named Ban Phai at the area. * The death of a great number of chickens from mysterious circumstances at a farm in Nakhon Luang District, Ayutthaya Province, on the night of 4 October 2015 was blamed by local villagers on the activity of the Krasue. * In February 2016, at Ban Don Pho Thong, Mueang Suphan Buri District, Suphan Buri Province, some villagers found strange lights floating at night which they believed to be a Krasue. This news has caused many people to panic. * In May 2016, villagers at Ban Khok Ta Kerd, Mueang Surin District, Surin Province saw strange green and red lights rising up and down the paddy fields at night. * In early August 2016 at Ban Song Yang, Mueang Amnat Charoen District, Amnat Charoen Province, video clips from smartphone cameras shot by individuals in the area showed red lights floating at night, believed to be a Krasue. * At approximately 9:30 p.m., on 13 September 2016, CCTV footage from a house in the Tha Ruea District, Ayutthaya Province, captured strange lights. The woman owner of the house who first reviewed the CCTV footage said she was watching television at that time, and she heard a loud barking dog. She went out to check the source of the sound but she did not see anything, so she looked at the CCTV monitor. She saw the strange lights which she watched for almost an hour, until the lights floated in the fence of her house and moved near the chicken coop and the star gooseberry tree. She became scared and called her neighbor, along with her father and her two other employees, whom she all asked to help her investigate the lights. However, they found nothing. She said that at the time of the event, there was bad weather during two to three days, it's sprinkling and nighttime comes faster than normal. After another 10 days at 8:28 p.m. on 23 September, she saw the lights in the backyard again. This time she asked her son to investigate the lights, but he found nothing. Her neighbors believed that the lights were from a Krasue. At that time, there were chickens and cats that the villagers were missing for unknown reasons. However, according to Dr. Jessada Denduangboripant, a skeptic, the strange lights actually came from the flashlight held by someone in front of the house. This explanation however was rejected by the television program reporting the incident. * By the end of 2016, one image has been shared on online social networks in Thailand. The image was shot in Buachet District, Surin Province, and shows an entity that looks like a human's face on a tree at night nearby a light. The image is believed to be depicting a Krasue. * In early 2017, at Ban Lao Luang, Mueang Kalasin District, Kalasin Province, a stampede occurred and villagers rode in motorcycles to go to the area where an individual shot a video showing red lights floating at 100 meters above the ground. The video shows that the light has already floated away. A man reported that at the time he lived in Yang Talat District, he would frequent the woods at night and while at the woods he looked at the sky and saw a Krasue. According to him, he cannot see the Krasue's face because it was covered by long hair, but he can make out the long fangs and the bright lights. It was reportedly able to escape when he drew his gun to shoot it. * In mid-July 2017 a video clip was shared on online social networks, showing an alleged entity floating in the air at the same level as a tree in the area at night. The entity was being witnessed by either a security guard or a police officer standing and looking with suspicion. There is no information as to where the video came from, and no additional details were available. However, it was found out that the entity was actually a drone, decorated as a man's face as a hoax. =Krasue references in Thai culture= Glowing mushroom in Khonkaen province is called ‚Äú Krasue Mushroom\\". There is information from The Royal Academy which provides examples of how belief in the Krasue has been reflected in Thai culture for centuries, for example: #An abnormally tiny banana (caused by a mutation) is said to be eaten by a Krasue. #A gluttonous person who eats too fast is usually said to \\"eat like a Krasue\\" or to be \\"as gluttonous as Krasue\\". #Glowing mushroom in Khonkaen province is called ‚Äú Krasue Mushroom\\".2\\\\.

Janputt, Pitchayatun. Nong Krasue. [interv.] Sorayutt Sututsanajinda. 21 January 2013. Scientific explanation A possible scientific explanation is that Krasue sightings are caused by blazing flames from methane gas particles emitted from rotten organic matters such as found in farms and fields, where Krasue sightings are commonly reported. However, according to Associate Professor Dr. Sirintornthep Towprayoon, an energy researcher from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi, the hypothesis that the Krasue is actually burning methane gas particles is impossible because not enough methane is emitted from rotten organic matter to be able to cause an ignition and that even if the methane gas particles did ignited, the burning would be confined to the surface of the organic, flammable matter and will not lead to floating flames that allegedly give the illusion of the Krasue. An anatomical interpretation is that when the head is pulled off from the human body, other organs such as the intestines, heart, and lungs will not come together with the head. Media Countries where the Krasue tale is popular have adapted it to film.Krasue movies Several Thai films depict this spirit, including 1973 movie Krasue Sao (Ghosts of Guts Eater), with Sombat Metanee, which features a fight between two Krasues,Ghosts of Guts Eater (Thailand 1973), Krasue krahai lveat/Filth Eating Spirit' (1985)https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3305290/reference Itthirit Nam Man Phrai (Oil of Eternal Life) made in 1984, with Tanid Pongmanoon and Praew Mardmarud,Itthirith Nam Man Phrai (Thailand 1984) Krasue Kat Pop (1990) with Bin Bunluerit and Trirak Rakkarndee,Krasue Kat Pop (Thailand 1990) Krasue Krahailueat (Bloodthirsty Krasue), , made in 1995 with Thida Teerarat,Krasue Krahailueat (Thailand 1995) Tamnan Krasue (Demonic Beauty) released in 2002, which ties the Krasue to a Khmer curse; Benjamin Baumann. \\"Tamnan Krasue ‚Äì Constructing a Khmer Ghost for a Thai Film.\\" Kyoto Review of Southeast Asia.

It is the only species in the genus Adelotus - adelotus meaning \\"unseen\\" and brevis meaning \\"short\\".Martyn Robinson (2005) A Field Guide to the Frogs of Australia. Australian Museum and Reed New Holland Publication. Description The tusked frog is a unique frog within Australia, as it is the only species where the female is smaller than male. Males can reach a maximum length of about , while females reach . The common name of \\"tusked frog\\" derives from the small protrusions on the lower jaw, similar in position to tusks, which can reach about in length in males (only visible when the mouth is open). The pair of bony tusks are modified teeth that protrude from the middle of the lower jaw and fit into special grooves on the upper jaw when the mouth is closed. They are slightly curved and sharply pointed, and are present in both males and females, although they are larger in males. Males have been observed 'locking jaws' with each other, in a similar way to male deer locking antlers in the struggle to exert dominance over each other. Male tusked frogs have a disproportionally large-sized head, compared to the body, and females have a smaller proportioned sized head than males. The males have been known to fight, biting each other under the head, and around the neck. This behaviour has presumably led to the sexual dimorphism of larger heads, body size and tusks to increase success of fights (Katsirakos & Shine 1997). The dorsal surface of the frog is normally brown, but can be olive to black, with low ridges, warts and irregular darker markings. There is usually a butterfly shaped marking between the eyes. The [ventral] surface of this species is more striking - being marbled black and white with flashes of red on the groin and hind legs. Males and females have different belly patterns. Fingers and toes are cylindrical and are not webbed. Ecology and behaviour A. brevis is associated with dams, ditches, flooded grassland and creeks in rainforest, wet sclerophyll forest and woodland. It is known from coastal and highland areas, however it has suffered declines in many highland areas, particularly the New England Tablelands of New South Wales. Males create hidden nest sites in leaf litter and vegetation in streams and the edges of dams. This species has a call like \\"tok-tok\\", males call from the nest site and can be difficult to find. Breeding takes place in spring and summer and eggs are laid as a foamy mass in the nest, hidden from sunlight. The eggs are white in colour and lack pigment. In the breeding season (October - December), males build nests out of foam hidden from direct sunlight in ponds and swamps. Over 600 eggs may be laid in each floating mass of foam, and are guarded by the male until they hatch into tadpoles. The tadpoles grow over a period of two to three months to around 3 to 3.5 cm, when they undergo metamorphosis into 'mini adult' froglets. Conservation status and threats The IUCN has listed the tusked frog in the near threatened category of the Red List of Threatened Species, and notes that it is probably in significant decline due to chytridiomycosis. The Southern Tablelands population has been listed as an endangered population under the Threatened Species Conservation Act, following the disappearance of the species from the rest of its former Tablelands range. Urban and agricultural development are thought to be the primary threats to this species, causing the degradation and loss of its habitat. Introduced species are causing further decline, such as the predatory eastern mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki), and weed species which outcompete the tusked frog's natural vegetation.

It was run aground at Fort Forrest () and burned in the battle for Roanoke Island on February 8, 1862. Its wreck was discovered in 1988 and archaeologically investigated in 1994.  The steamboat  The Curlew was built in 1856 by the Harlan & Hollingsworth Iron Shipbuilding Company of Wilmington, Delaware. It was long, wide, depth of hold, and listed at 236 tons. Its average draft was , which suited the shallow waters of the North Carolina sounds. The steamboat had side paddle wheels that were in diameter by wide. The Curlew had no figurehead, a round stern, and no mast. A walking beam engine with a diameter cylinder and a stroke powered the new steamer. This type of engine had a distinctive trapezoid-shaped rocker arm mounted between the paddle wheels, which transmitted power from the piston rod to the crank on the paddle wheel shaft. For improved efficiency, the Curlew's engine was equipped with Sickle's patented cutoff valve. Steam was provided by a two furnace return-flue boiler long, high, and wide, and rated at 30 lbf/in¬≤ (210 kPa) of pressure. It started operating in North Carolina in July 1856. (Olson 1997:30ff)  History  The Curlew was built for Thomas D. Warren, a doctor and plantation owner from Edenton, North Carolina. It was operated for passenger and cargo transportation in the Albemarle Sound region, running between Edenton, Hertford, Elizabeth City and Nag's Head. The Curlew also made trips up the Chowan River to Franklin, Virginia. Its first captain was Richard Halsey, who was later replaced by Thomas Burbage in 1858.(Olson 1997:34ff) The Curlew made many trips to the Nag's Head Hotel, which in those days was a popular tourist destination. In 1859 Edward Bruce, an artist and reporter, rode the ship on a trip to Nag's Head and afterwards wrote about it for Harper's New Monthly Magazine. He singled out the Curlew and its crew for special praise: > We never saw him (Captain Burbage) rave. Always at his post, and always > quiet, everything went on like clockwork. No traveler accustomed to the > privileged usage on many similar craft would have imagined that one of them > could be so well managed with so little damage to the Third Commandment. > (Bruce 1859:726f) After the Civil War broke out, the Curlew was initially used as a troop transport, ferrying troops and supplies to various defensive works along the North Carolina coast. The Curlew was acquired by the Confederate Navy after Hatteras Inlet fell to Union forces in August 1861. It was outfitted with one rifled 32-pounder cannon in the bow and one 12-pounder smoothbore cannon in the stern. Under the command of Thomas T. Hunter (also known as Tornado Hunter) it was involved in the capture of the U.S. Army supply boat Fanny at Chicamacomico on October 1, 1861. Between October 1861 and February 1862 the Curlew alternately patrolled Pamlico Sound and harassed Union shipping at Hatteras Inlet. On February 7 the Curlew and eight other Confederate gunboats attempted to repel the Union invasion of Roanoke Island. During this battle the Curlew was holed by a shell and run aground to keep from sinking. The next day it was set on fire when the Confederate forces on Roanoke Island surrendered. The remaining Confederate gunboats withdrew to Elizabeth City, where all but two were destroyed or captured on February 10 in the Battle of Elizabeth City. (Olson 1997:118ff) Afterwards, Captain Hunter commented to another gunboat captain that during the battle he suddenly realized that his pants were gone, even though he knew he put on a pair that morning. (Parker 1985:248f) The Curlew's engine was salvaged in 1863, after which the wreck was allowed to decay. It was located in 1988 by a group of international divers working for the state of North Carolina's Underwater Archaeological Unit. Its identity was confirmed when one of the divers, Takafumi Yamaguchi, recovered the builders plate. In 1994 the wreck was documented by state divers and students from East Carolina University.

After his father's death, Guy entered the service of his erstwhile enemy, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. According to the emperor's daughter, Anna Komnene, he was drawn to Byzantine service by certain promises made by Alexios. At the Byzantine court, Guy became one of Alexios' most trusted councilors and was rewarded with the rank of sebastos. In August 1096, he helped negotiate between the Alexios and the leaders of the First Crusade, even serving as a hostage for the emperor's good faith during the dealings with Godfrey of Bouillon. Guy was with the Byzantine army campaigning in Asia Minor when, at Philomelium around 20 June 1097, it was met by the nominal leader of the Crusade, Stephen, Count of Blois, who reported that the siege of Antioch was going very badly. In 1108, Guy was with his half-brother, Bohemond, when the latter attack Byzantine Dyrrachium. Defeated, Bohemond sued for peace and during the negotiations Guy was entrusted with keeping the Byzantine hostages.

During wartime, about 5 divisions would be formed under the Mobilization Reserves, and deployed to the war zone to provide support and regional stabilization. In the meantime, the Homeland Reserve would defend the homeland from any possible attacks from the enemy.  History  The Homeland Reserve Force was established in April 1968 as part of a nationwide program to increase emergency defense capabilities in response to increased North Korean infiltration. In January 1968, a North Korean commando unit infiltrated Seoul and attacked the Blue House Presidential residence in an attempt to assassinate South Korean President Park Chung Hee. That same month, two additional North Korean commando units launched attacks on towns on the Korean east coast in attempts to create an insurgency. = Civil Defense = In 1980 there were over 90,000 civil defense personnel in the country.

The term is most often applied to insects, and is particularly in use in sericulture, where silkworm varieties vary in their voltinism. * Univoltine (=Monovoltine) ‚Äì (adjective) referring to organisms having one brood or generation per year * Bivoltine(=divoltine)‚Äì (adjective) referring to organisms having two broods or generations per year * Multivoltine(Polyvoltine) ‚Äì (adjective) referring to organisms having more than two broods or generations per year *Semivoltine - There are two meanings: *(biology) Less than univoltine; having a brood or generation less often than once per year *or *(adjective) referring to organisms whose generation time is more than one year 9. Examples The speckled wood butterfly is univoltine in the northern part of its range, e.g. northern Scandinavia. Adults emerge in late spring, mate, and die shortly after laying eggs; their offspring will grow until pupation, enter diapause in anticipation of the winter, and emerge as adults the following year ‚Äì thus resulting in a single generation of butterflies per year. In southern Scandinavia, the same species is bivoltine ‚Äì here, the offspring of spring-emerging adults will develop directly into adults during the summer, mate, and die. Their offspring in turn constitute a second generation, which is the generation that will enter winter diapause and emerge as adults (and mate) in the spring of the following year. This results in a pattern of one short-lived generation (c. 2‚Äì3 months) that breeds during the summer, and one long-lived generation (ca. 9-10 months) that diapauses through the winter and breeds in the spring. The Rocky Mountain parnassian and the High brown fritillary are more examples of univoltine butterfly species.Aalberg Haugen IM, Berger D, and Gotthard K. 2012. The evolution of alternative developmental pathways: footprints of selection on life-history traits in a butterfly. 12pp. Journal of Evolutionary Biology, 25:7, Available online: The bee species Macrotera portalis is bivoltine, and is estimated to have about 2 or 3 broods annually. During winter, individuals remain in diapause, in their pharate or prepupal stage. This diapause stage continues until metamorphosis in the next spring or summer, whereupon the bees emerge as adults. Buchmann, Stephen L. ‚ÄúBees‚Äù, Bees, Retrieved on 15 October 2015. The Dawson's burrowing bee is an example of a univoltine insect of the order Hymenoptera. The brood of one winter will remain dormant underground until the following winter, and then will surface from their burrows to mate once, and establish new nests. =Partial voltinism= The term partial voltinism is used to refer to two different (but not necessarily exclusive) situations: * An organism wherein generations overlap in time, and so are not completely reproductively isolated. For example, in bees of the subfamily Halictinae, one generation is produced in the early summer and one in the late summer, but males produced in the early summer may also mate in the late summer.Seger J. 1983. Partial bivoltinism may cause alternating sex-ratio biases that favor eusociality. 4pp. Nature, 301:59-62, Available online: * (More commonly) a population where the voltinism is mixed, because of genetic variation (e.g., in the hybrid zone between a univoltine and a bivoltine area) and/or because environmental stimuli do not induce bivoltinism in all individuals (or across all years). For example, far-northern populations of the green-veined white butterfly Pieris napi are mostly univoltine, but some individuals may avert diapause and produce an additional generation under warm conditions.Kivel√§ SM, Svensson B, Tiwe A, and Gotthard K. 2015.

Many phytophagous species that are dependent on seasonal plant resources are univoltine. Some such species have the ability to diapause for a large part of the year, typically during a cold winter.Hunter, M.D. and J.N. McNeil. 1997 Host-plant quality influences diapause and voltinism in a polyphagous insect herbivore. Ecology 78: 977-986. Others that bore in wood or other low-grade, but plentiful, food material may spend nearly the entire year feeding, with only brief pupal, adult and egg stages to complete a univoltine life cycle. Yet other species that live in tropical regions with little seasonality may be highly multivoltine, with several generations feeding on constantly growing vegetation (such as some species of Saturniidae), or continually renewed detritus, such as Drosophila and many other genera of flies with a life cycle of just a week or two.

Born in Falmouth, he attended the public schools and graduated from Earlham College (Richmond, Indiana) in 1898 and from Indiana Law School (now Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law) in 1900. He was admitted to the bar in 1900 and commenced practice in Shelbyville moving shortly afterward to Anderson. From 1906 to 1910 he was prosecuting attorney of Madison County and was a member of the Indiana Senate from 1913 to 1916, serving as president pro tempore in 1915. He moved to Indianapolis in 1916 and continued the practice of law; he was United States Attorney for the U.S. District of Indiana from 1920 to 1922. According to an interview in the Literary Digest, he pronounced his last name \\"van-NIECE\\".Charles Earle Funk, What's the Name, Please?, Funk & Wagnalls, 1936. He was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. Senate in 1932, soundly defeating longtime incumbent and Majority Leader James Eli Watson. He was an opponent of the Eighteenth Amendment and called for changes to the Volstead Act. In 1937, he joined with Senator Robert F. Wagner in introducing an anti-lynching bill in the Senate. The House of Representatives passed a similar bill by a wide 277-120 margin but was successfully filibustered in the Senate in 1938. While in the Senate he was chairman of the Committee on Expenditures in Executive Departments (76th Congress) and a member of the Committee on the Judiciary (77th and 78th Congresses). Although he was a Democrat who was elected as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt‚Äôs sweeping victory, Van Nuys was not always a reliable supporter of New Deal policies and opposed the president‚Äôs plan to enlarge the United States Supreme Court. He also stayed outside of the Indiana Democratic Party political machine opposing the party in patronage matters. His positions led some forces in the Democratic Party, including the AFL‚ÄìCIO to oppose his renomination in 1938. Loyalists to Governors Paul McNutt and M. Clifford Townsend sought to \\"eliminate\\" him from the Senate, which was welcomed by the Roosevelt administration. After initially threatening to run as an independent, he secured support for the Democratic nomination and faced Republican newspaper publisher Raymond E. Willis in the general election. Van Nuys won the election by a mere 5,100 votes, which led Willis to appeal to the Senate for a recount, alleging election irregularities. The Senate denied the recount on the grounds that the affected votes would not have changed the results. In 1943 a confidential analysis by Isaiah Berlin of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee for the British Foreign Office stated of Van Nuys: He died on January 25, 1944 at his home in Vienna, Virginia after a short illness and was buried in East Maplewood Cemetery, Anderson, Indiana. Governor Henry Schricker appointed Samuel D. Jackson to succeed him in the Senate.

Its stated goal is to unify and strengthen the profession of midwifery, thereby improving the quality of health care for women, babies, and communities.  History  When MANA was founded there were many organizations that midwives had been instrumental in organizing and that provided a means of communication and support. However none had a membership base broad enough, an internal support system, or the political credibility to promote midwifery as an accepted part of the maternal-child health care system in North America. In October 1981, Sister Angela Murdaugh, of the American College of Nurse-Midwives, invited four non-nurse midwives and four nurse-midwives from around the country to Washington D.C. to discuss issues confronting all midwives, with special emphasis on the communication concerns between American midwives trained as nurses and those who were not formally trained. A decision was made to form a \\"Guild\\" that would include all midwives with four purposes in mind: to expand communication among midwives; to set educational and training guidelines; to set guidelines for basic competency and safety for practicing midwives; and to form an identifiable professional organization for all midwives in the U.S. Throughout its history MANA has advocated for the belief that birthing mothers should be able to choose their places and caregivers at birth and that midwifery should be decriminalized. In April 1982, nearly 100 women from around the country met in Lexington, Kentucky. At this meeting the name Midwives Alliance of North America was chosen, and it was decided that Canadian midwives would be included in the organization. Officers were chosen and a newsletter Practicing Midwife (changed to MANA News in 1983) was established. In October 1983, the first MANA convention was held, and the members elected Teddy Charvet as President, Ina May Gaskin as Vice President, and Rena Porteus as second Vice President. Much of MANA's organizational energy has been directed toward making national midwifery certification acceptable and workable within the medical community and thereby accessible to women. By 1986, it had become clear that midwives needed to create an internationally accepted direct-entry midwifery credential if they were to preserve the unique forms of practice which midwives had developed over the last thirty years and at the same time work within the larger healthcare community. To this end MANA launched the North American Registry of Midwives (NARM). NARM became a separately incorporated entity in 1992 and since has developed a competency-based certification process. Out of the formal support network generated by MANA, the Midwifery Education Accreditation Council (MEAC) was established in 1991. In conjunction with NARM, it accredits a wide variety of direct-entry midwifery educational programs, including apprenticeships, thus formally validating and preserving ancient as well as modern routes to practice.  Goals  According to the MANA website, the organization's goals are: * To engage midwives in dialog and to encourage solidarity across North America. * To recognize the diversity among midwives and to foster inclusive community building. * To build an identity as a cohesive organization representing the profession as well as the tradition of midwifery at regional, national and international levels. * To position midwives as acknowledged authorities, working to improve perinatal health in collaboration with other professionals. * To collect and disseminate high quality research about midwifery care. * To promote excellence in midwifery practice. * To sponsor continuing education opportunities for midwives. * To increase access to midwives in all settings. * To endorse the Midwives Model of Care as the gold standard for childbirth. * To affirm the rights of pregnant women to give birth where and with whom they choose.  Membership  MANA membership includes midwives and student midwives, other healthcare providers, and families. Over one-third of MANA's member midwives are certified professional midwives (CPMs), the remainder are certified nurse midwives, certified midwives, state-licensed midwives, traditional midwives, and student/apprentice midwives. Research MANA's Division of Research maintains a registry of midwife-assisted births in the US and Canada, that can be made available for use in research upon request. Published research has provided descriptive evidence on practice and safety of recorded home births, but contribution to the data set is voluntary and direct comparisons to hospital births remain difficult.

Many of the puzzles are based on phenomena that occur within impossible objects created by the game engine, such as passages that lead the player to different locations depending on which way they face, and structures that seem otherwise impossible within normal three-dimensional space. The game includes elements of psychological exploration through brief messages of advice to help the player figure out solutions to the puzzles as well as adages for real life. The game was released on Steam for Microsoft Windows on January 31, 2013, a version sold with the Humble Indie Bundle 11 in February 2014 added support for Linux and OS X. Gameplay and plot A gallery room in Antichamber demonstrating the use of the impossible object geometries; looking face on to each wall of these individual cubes will show a different scene. The player's manipulation \\"gun\\" is shown in the bottom right. In Antichamber, the player controls the unnamed protagonist from a first-person perspective as they wander through levels. Regarding typical notions of Euclidean space, Bruce has stated that \\"breaking down all those expectations and then remaking them is essentially the core mechanic of the game\\". The player starts in an antechamber that contains four walls. One is a diegetic menu to set the various game options as well as a countdown timer starting at ninety minutes. A second wall provides a map of the game's space that will fill in as the player visits specific rooms, highlighting passages the player has yet to explore, and allows the player, upon return to this room, to jump to any room they've visited before. A third wall shows a series of cartoonish iconographs and obfuscated hint text that are added as the player finds these on walls of the puzzle space. The fourth wall is a window, showing the ultimate goal, the exit from the space, which the player must figure out how to get to. Puzzle elements in various chambers involve maneuvering themselves around the spaces, where level elements can change after passing certain points, or even based on which direction the player is facing when traversing the level. Laser beams are used as mechanisms to control various doors; these may either require the beams to be blocked or unblocked, and many doors require multiple beams to be in their proper state to open. Initially, the player can trigger these themselves. Later, the player gains access to a series of colored \\"guns\\", each which helps the player access more of the space. Initially, the gun can pick up any number of small cubes, storing them, and then place them on surfaces; these can be used to block the aforementioned laser beams, or used as platforms for the player to get over obstacles. Other guns can be used to \\"grow\\" new blocks by placing blocks out in specific patterns, to direct a connected series of blocks towards an objective point, and to mass create and fill an area with blocks; later guns retain the abilities of the earlier ones. Certain areas in the space are dead zones that remove any blocks stored in the gun or prevent blocks from moving through them. After most puzzles are signs with the forementioned iconographs which can be activated to give a hint about the just-completed puzzle. At any point, the player can jump back to the first room, and use the map to navigate to other areas; this resets any progress made on specific puzzles though the player retains the guns they have obtained. Upon completing a core set of puzzles, the player can then access the exit door, upon which they start to chase down a black cloudlike shape, using all the solving techniques they have learned before. Eventually they are able to capture the cloud as a black cube within their gun, and enter a final, more expansive area, where they return the shape to a waiting shell. The shell creates a structure around it ‚Äì similar to the game's logo ‚Äì and then sucks everything around it into its center, sending the screen to black and ending the game. Development Antichamber started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding the mechanics of the game Snake into a multiplayer experience. Full development of the game, initially called Hazard, did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce developed the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the subtitle \\"The Journey of Life\\" in 2009. Part of this change came about how he was able to create Impossible Object spaces within the Unreal Engine, which came about as a result of a \\"rookie error\\" in coding. Bruce recognized that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that \\"the game started off as being all about geometry...I needed to find a way to represent that [non-physical geometry] to players...so I needed to work out why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology.\\" As he worked out puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped to lead to puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of Antichamber's approach. The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the game from other Unreal Engine games, while also to aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game. On April 2, 2012, Antichamber became the seventh game to receive funding from the Indie Fund with Bruce citing the award as \\"finishing funds\\" to ensure the game can be released in 2012, and was ultimately released in January 2013. =Music= The soundtrack for Antichamber consists of ambient music composed by Siddhartha Barnhoorn. The music evolves over the course of the game, starting with nothing more than one ambient layer in the first level and gradually progressing into a complex soundscape. In an interview with IndieGames.com, Barnhoorn revealed that the soundtrack comprises sounds from various guitars, the shakuhachi, the koto, and synth pads. In addition, Barnhoorn stated that the non-synth sounds are digitally manipulated \\"here and there in order to make the sounds a bit longer than they would appear naturally\\". Antichamber Suite, a track consisting of music from the game, was released via Bandcamp on February 13, 2012. The track was also featured in the Nubuwo Debut Bundle released March 2, 2012. The full soundtrack was released on February 18, 2013. Reception =Pre-release= Antichamber was well received by critics prior to its commercial release. In 2009 the game was featured in the showcase at the Tokyo Game Show Sense of Wonder Night, and was a finalist in the Independent Games Festival China. In 2010, indiePub Games's third Independent Game Developers' Competition awarded Antichamber the prize for Technical Excellence. In 2011 the game was as a finalist in GameStop's Indie Game Challenge, and in the Make Something Unreal competition (run by Epic Games), the game won 1st for Best Level for a Mod in Phase 4, 3rd for Best non-FPS Mod in Phase 4, and 5th place overall in the grand finals. During the 2011 Independent Games Festival, Antichamber wound up as a finalist for the Nuovo Award, which recognizes \\"abstract, short-form, and unconventional game development.\\" Also in 2011, the game made it into the PAX 10 and finished as a finalist in the IndieCade festival. In 2012, Antichamber took home the Technical Excellence Award at the Independent Games Festival. =Post- release= Antichamber has received critical acclaim, with score aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings giving overall scores of 82/100 and 83.70% respectively. Most reviewers praised the level design and puzzles in the game. Game Informer wrote that \\"I rarely ever felt stuck or frustrated by a lack of progress ‚Äì a testament to Antichamber's pacing and design\\", and GameTrailers said \\"The true star of Antichamber is its level design.\\" PC Gamer described the game as hosting \\"moments of transcendent beauty and vignettes that engage your brain on a level few games attempt\\" and IGN called the puzzles \\"expertly crafted and wonderfully inventive challenges.\\" Within two months of its release on Steam the game sold more than 100,000 copies, with most of the sales coming during the first week of release.

Walking and bicycling  Main Street corridor of downtown Dallas. Dallas is the 30th most walkable large city in the US, with a Walk Score of 47. Most of the pedestrian-friendly areas in the city are near downtown and Uptown. The majority of Dallas, whether or not it was developed with the pedestrian in mind, was completely rebuilt or reworked to accommodate the vehicle in the mid-20th century. In the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), the importance of the pedestrian, bicyclist, and those who use mass transportation began to be realized and most new developments cater to all forms of transportation. Walking trails, though once nonexistent, are also starting to be built and improved by the city. Perhaps the flagship is the Katy Trail, built over the old Katy Railway, which goes from the Victory Park neighborhood through Uptown and Oak Lawn up to Knox Park. Other trails include the levee-top trails along the Trinity River and the Texas Buckeye Trail in the Great Trinity Forest of south Dallas. The city also maintains walking trails at area parks including parks around White Rock Lake and Bachman Lake. The city maintains 800 lane miles of cyclist-selected bike routes along low- volume roadways throughout the city that parallel major thoroughfares. The City does not employ bicycle control devices like bike lanes, as the necessary pre-conditions do not exist. The city has also installed a series of Pedestrian Tunnels in Downtown Dallas, although these have been under much criticism regarding their ability to \\"suck the life off of\\" the aboveground streets.  Streets  A 1905 map showing several early street grid attempts Major and minor thoroughfares in Dallas and its enclaves Dallas is devoid of any major street grid as a whole, though a number of major attempts intersect at awkward angles and in confusing interchanges around the city. The main street grid in the center city runs 45¬∞ to the typical N/S/E/W grid, creating confusion for many out-of-town visitors. This street grid prevails primarily in east Dallas, though it also permeates Oak Lawn, portions of downtown, and the Cedars. Another much smaller street grid lies downtown between Pacific and Young streets -- it is about 15¬∞ off the typical N/S/E/W grid, and is on average 5-8 streets across N/S and about wide E/W. There is also a fairly extensive N/S/E/W grid around the original city of Oak Cliff. The rest of Dallas, developed from the middle of the 20th century on, is typically on a N/S/E/W grid, especially with major thoroughfares. In trying to make the city traversable, city planners have over time created wide boulevards that jump between the rights-of-way of multiple minor streets, trying to force a wide road wherever they can discover space for it. This forces the destruction of the minor streets' original paths, a name-change for the boulevard or minor streets, and roads (e.g. Cole 1, 2, 3) that exist in two or more places. Major thoroughfares in Oak Cliff typically do not cross the Trinity River, and when they do, they frequently do not continue with the same name on the north or eastern sides, which creates a degree of confusion. Also, many times a street will change names each time it crosses a municipal border. Conversely, many streets keep their names through sharp turns across the city.  Highways  North Central Expressway southbound towards downtown Dallas The city of Dallas is at the confluence of a large number of major interstate highways‚ÄîInterstates 20, 30, 35E, and 45 all run through the city. The city's freeway system, as it has no major geographical inhibitors surrounding it, is set up in the popular hub-and-spoke system, much like a wagon wheel. The center of the system is the downtown freeway loop, made up of Interstate 30 on the south, Interstate 35E on the west, Spur 366 on the north, and Interstate 345 on the east. (Interstate 345 is a short spur of Interstate 45 that connects Interstate 45 with US 75.) The next major freeway loop is the Interstate 635/20 Lyndon B. Johnson loop, and the outermost is the tolled President George Bush Turnpike. Inside these freeway loops are other partially limited-access and parkway-style loops including Loop 12 and Belt Line Road. Another beltway around the city is planned upwards of from downtown in Collin County. Radiating out of downtown as the spokes of the system are Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, US 75, US 175, Spur 366, the tolled Dallas North Tollway, and further out SH 114, US 80 and US 67. Other major highways within the city that do not serve primarily as spokes include SH 183 and Spur 408. Portions of Interstates 30, 35E, and 635, and US 75 also have either bidirectional or reversible HOV lanes. Future highway plans typically integrate usage of both HOV and/or HOT (tolled) lanes, e.g. the expansion of Interstate 635. Plans for the road include HOV lanes and massive HOT tunnels in the heavily congested segment of the highway between, generally, Interstate 35E and US 75. This portion of the highway travels through one of the densest regions of north Dallas, which, coupled with its primary role as a circulator for commuters, makes the freeway constantly congested at all hours of the day and night. The city of Dallas's freeways, much like the city, are generally relatively new and in good condition. TxDOT is famous for its highway system in the state and many of what could be considered \\"flagship freeways\\" lie within the city. One example is North Central Expressway or US 75, which was trenched, immaculately landscaped and heavily ornamented between downtown and Loop 12 in the 1990s. Interstate 30 west of downtown Dallas was recently brought to a level near North Central Expressway and Interstate 635, Interstate 30 east of downtown, and Interstate 35E all share similar futures. Construction, like many cities, is a constant burden for the city's heavily automobile-centered culture.  Mass transportation  400px Passengers at White Rock Station on DART's Blue Line Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) is the Dallas area public transportation authority, providing bus and rail service. DART began operating the first light rail system in the Southwest United States in 1996 and continues to expand its coverage. Currently, four light rail lines are in service. The goes through Oak Cliff, downtown, Uptown, North Dallas, Richardson and Plano. The goes through South Dallas, downtown, Uptown, North Dallas, Garland, and Rowlett. The goes through south east Dallas, Fair Park, Baylor University Medical Center, downtown, Victory, west of Dallas Love Field, Farmers Branch, then ends in Carrollton. The follows the Dart Red Line from North Plano through downtown, then follows the Green Line up through Victory, to Bachman Station, then goes west to Las Colinas before terminating at DFW Airport. All current rail lines are connected downtown by four rail stations. Red, Orange and Blue Lines connect to Cityplace/Uptown Station, currently the only subway station in the Southwest. DART completed expansions to the Orange line in 2014, bringing the length of the light rail system to around . Further ambitions include expanding the commuter rail network in the region to over ; expanding the DART light rail network to over with a second route through downtown included; expanding the Dallas Streetcar to the Bishop Arts District and Convention Center Hotel; and expanding the elevated Las Colinas Area Personal Transit system to serve new entertainment venues in the area. The DART light rail system remained the only light rail system in Texas until Houston opened METRORail, its starter light rail system (one line running less than 10 miles), in 2004. Fort Worth's smaller public transit system connects with Dallas's via a commuter rail line, the Trinity Railway Express, connecting downtown Dallas's Union Station with downtown Fort Worth's T&P; Station and several points in between. The light rail system has caused a dramatic increase in land values in downtown Dallas and has sparked a residential population boom in the area. Although the system is increasingly popular, large parts of the Metroplex remain outside the current service area of the system and remain dependent on the automobile. DART now uses Google Maps as its main provider of transit information. An independent company, Dadnab, offers a service that enables riders to retrieve similar information using text messaging from their mobile phones. DART provides transit route and schedule information to Google and this has spawned a new generation of trip planners such as TransitTrips. RideSearch.com is based out of Carrollton, Texas and serves the Dallas/Fort Worth area. They are similar to DART in that they are a rideshare program that helps match people up who are looking for a ride. Established on January 1, 2008, RideSearch.com has been successful in finding a carpool for many people in the metroplex.  Intercity Buses  Greyhound Lines operates the majority of the inter-city bus service to and from Dallas. Megabus operates low-cost double-decker coaches from Dallas to major cities in Texas and Arkansas. Shofur operates services from Dallas to major cities in Texas. El Expreso Bus Company operates services to a station in Dallas adjacent to the Tornado Bus Company station. Tornado Bus Company operates service to a station in Dallas. Turimex Internacional operates service to two stations, with one in Dallas and one in Garland. Omnibus Express operates service to two stations, with one in Dallas and one in Garland. Los Paisanos Autobuses operates service to a station in Dallas. enjoy Dallas Union Station rail service Amtrak's Texas Eagle train makes a stop at the station. Its eastern terminus is Chicago, Illinois. Its western terminus is San Antonio, however, sleeping car passengers have continuing service on the Sunset Limited, to Los Angeles. The station also is a transfer point for the aforementioned DART Light Rail and Trinity Railway Express commuter rail.  Airports  Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport serves most passengers flying in and out of the metroplex Dallas is served by two commercial airports: Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (known as DFW International) and Dallas Love Field. In addition, Dallas Executive Airport (formerly Redbird Airport), is a general aviation airport located within the city limits, and Addison Airport is another general aviation airport located just outside the city limits in the suburb of Addison. Another general aviation airport, Denton Municipal Airport is located northwest of Dallas in Denton. Two more general aviation airports are located in the outer suburb of McKinney, and on the west side of the Metroplex, two general aviation airports are located in Fort Worth. DFW International Airport is located in the suburbs north of and equidistant to downtown Fort Worth and downtown Dallas. In terms of size, DFW is the largest airport in the state, the second largest in the United States, and third largest in the world. In terms of traffic, DFW is the busiest in the state, third busiest in the United States, and sixth busiest in the world. DFW is also home base to American Airlines, formerly the world's largest airline which operates eighty-four percent of all passenger traffic at the airport. Air Cargo World named DFW \\"The Best Cargo Airport in the World\\" on 7 March 2006.AirCargoWorld.com ‚Äî Air Cargo Excellence Survey . Retrieved 18 September 2006.DFWairport.com ‚Äî Cargo Connects DFW To the World and DFW news release . Retrieved 18 September 2006. Love Field is located within the city limits of Dallas, northwest of downtown, and is headquarters to Southwest Airlines. Under the Federal \\"Wright Amendment\\" and \\"Shelby Amendment\\" laws, no large jet air service was allowed before 2014 from Dallas Love Field to any point beyond Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, Oklahoma, New Mexico, Kansas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Missouri. However, the amendment was entirely repealed in an all-party compromise that took effect in 2014, and Love Field is now able to service any city in America.

P. Chen was a Shanghai-based Chinese banker and State Councillor. He was the founder of the first modern Chinese savings bank, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, the Shanghai Commercial Bank, a travel agency, as well as the China Assurance Corporation Ltd. He was one of China's most successful entrepreneurs in the twentieth century, particularly influential in the financial and business world of Shanghai. He played a key role in negotiating financial aid from the United States in 1937-1940, working with Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau.Yuwu Song, ed., Encyclopedia of Chinese-American Relations (McFarland, 2009) pp 52-53. Linsun Cheng, in his Banking in Modern China: Entrepreneurs, Professional Managers, and the Development of Chinese, says, \\"It is almost impossible to describe any significant innovation in the history of modern Chinese banks without mentioning K. P. Chen's name.\\" Early life In 1880, K. P. Chen was born in Dantu, Jiangsu province into a family with little education. He caught the attention of compradores of a foreign firm who decided to sponsor his education in America. He graduated in 1909 with a BSc. degree from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. After graduation, as part of the sponsorship agreement, he worked as an intern in an American bank for a year. He then returned to China where he joined the Nanyang Quanyehui or the Nanjing South Seas Exhibition, a China-hosted international exposition that showcased to the world both China‚Äôs modernization and cultural heritage. Career =The Jiangsu Bank= K. P. Chen began his China banking career in 1913, when he joined a provincial government bank, the Kiangsu Provincial Bank, as its General Manager. There, he introduced something new nearly every day, believing innovation necessary for success. He broke with tradition and moved the bank's headquarters from Jiangsu to the banking capital of Shanghai, made loans on credit of goods rather than personal credit and invited Western accountants to regularly audit the bank's balance books. The bank established warehouses for its commodities lending operations, the first to do so in China. He did all this in just a year, after which he was forced to resign when he refused to disclose the names of the bank's customers to a local warlord. =The Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank (The Shanghai Bank)= In Shanghai in June 1915, K. P. Chen, together with some others including Chinese Red Cross President Zhuang Dezhi, founded the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank. Chen was appointed the bank's first General Manager. Chen had 80,000 Yuan in initial capital to found the bank. Their initial capital was so small the bank became known as \\"the Little Shanghai Bank\\". His guiding principle was ‚Äúservice to society, support for industry, and prosperity to enhance international trade‚Äù and he made sure that his staff must be very polite and patient with their clients, small depositors. In his address to his staff in Qingdao branch, he emphasized that they must appreciate their customers business‚Äîwhether for one or 100 Chinese dollars‚Äîmust do their best to give their customers convenience, and must be friendly to businessmen. He said ‚Äúthe customer‚Äôs psychology always favors a busy place,‚Äù because the sight of a busy firm will make people trust it and claimed that the aim of The Shanghai Bank was to serve society and not just make a profit. So, even though some services would not be profitable, they still had to be offered. Chen Guangfu xiansheng l√ºezhuan (The short biography of Chen Guangfu, Taipei: Shanghai shangye chuxu yinhang, 1977, p. 31). Innovation seems to have come naturally to K. P. Chen. It did not stop with the Kiangsu Bank. At the Shanghai Bank, contrary to what other banks were doing at the time, he concentrated on attracting deposits from the public instead of notes issuance. K. P. Chen was the first to introduce \\"one dollar\\" accounts, encouraging savings among individual members of the greater public and took the lead in introducing many different types of savings programs. The Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank's motto, very reflective of Chen's values, was \\"service to society, support for industry, and development of international trade.\\" In 1928 the Shanghai Bank handled over 6 million Yuan in foreign exchange and became the number one private bank handling foreign exchange in China. The Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China became upset because of The Shanghai Bank's efforts to promote their foreign exchange business, and decided to refuse The Shanghai Bank's foreign exchange contracts. In retaliation K. P. Chen refused to accept contracts from the Chartered Bank and made this known to the Shanghai banking community through The Shanghai Bankers Association and The Shanghai Foreign Bankers Association, whom he rallied to his cause. Eventually the Chartered Bank came to cooperate with the Shanghai Bank through the mediation of a third party. In 1931 he created a special trust department in the bank initially to rent out safety deposit boxes but later on including insurance and real estate operations among other things. He traveled all over China. In the 1930s K. P. Chen would go into the Chinese countryside and attempt to make small farmers \\"banking- conscious\\", as observed by a Chartered Bank manager who accompanied Chen on one of his stints. \\"Don't go to Sinkiang. It's a very hard trip‚Äîeven dangerous. And when you come back, no one will believe what you find there.\\" he once told a Time Inc.'s Nanking correspondent, Frederick Gruin. =Travel Service Department of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank= In 1923 K. P. Chen was treated badly when booking his passage at a British-run travel agency. On returning to Shanghai he decided to establish a travel service department within his bank to compete with the foreign travel agencies. Having made the necessary preparations he submitted a proposal to the Ministry of Communications under the Northern Warlords Government (1912‚Äì1927), asking for permission to establish a travel service department and to sell train tickets on a commission basis. Whilst the proposal was vociferously opposed by the many foreigners occupying important positions in many Chinese railways build with foreign loans at the National Railway Through Transport Conference, it was finally adopted thanks to the support of General Director of Communications Ye Gongche and others, and on August 1, 1923, the Travel Service Department of the Shanghai Commercial, the first of its kind run by Chinese compatriots, was born in the Banks Building on Ningpo road. It operated on a trial basis and opened only to those from \\"polite society\\" instead of to the wider populace, providing a comparatively limited business scope. Its official opening ceremony was held on June 1, 1927 and the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank travel department was formally registered as the China Travel Service. Unfortunately, the average daily turnover in the next few months was too low to cover costs. This embarrassing situation provoked a series of complaints from the board of directors and Chen was obliged to make a thorough reshuffle. With a total investment of US$50,000, the travel agency was separated from its parent company and had to take on the whole responsibility for its profit and loss from then on. Chen Xiangtao, once an official from the Shanghai Public Communications Bureau was assigned the post of general manager. In April 1928, it changed its name to China Travel Service (holdings) Co. Ltd. (abbreviated as CTS (holding)). The year 1931 was the heyday for the CTS, they won the right to deal in European train tickets for Chinese traveling overseas. In the same year CTS opened up more than 20 chain hostels around the country and its annual profits reached more than US$4 million. The CTS halted its travel service during the War of Resistance against Japan (1937‚Äì45) but was unable to recover after the communist revolution in 1949. Along with the management of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank, the CTS evacuated to Taiwan, but was unable to resume operations. It declared bankruptcy in Taipei in July 1954 and retreated from the arena, but its epoch-making contribution to the Chinese Tourism Industry is still dwelt upon with great relish. The mainland assets of the CTS were seized by Communist authorities, and today its successor is one of the state- owned large-scale lead enterprises managed by the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council. The core business of CTS (holdings) includes travel, industry invests (steel and iron), the related real estate development and distribution trade. =The Three Musketeers= K. P. Chen cultivated close relationships with Li Ming (founder and CEO of Chekiang Industrial Bank and Chairman of the Shanghai Bankers Association), and Chang Kia-ngau who like he was, represented a new generation of modern bankers. Half of his initial capital for the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank came from Li's sources. In 1916, both K. P. Chen and Li Ming stood up for Chang Kia-ngau and accused the government of wrongfully issuing the order when Chang's Bank of China's Shanghai office got into trouble for refusing to obey the governments order to suspend banknote remittance. After this incident, the Bank of China was able to assert its independence from the Yuan Shih-k'ai regime in Peking and started nearly two decades of tremendous growth as China's largest private bank. K. P. Chen initially became close to Chang Kia-ngau when he became a private financial consultant to the Bank of China at the time between leaving the Kiangsu Provincial Bank and the founding of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank. Probably because of his tiny initial capital, K. P. Chen received a long term interbank deposit of 50,000 Yuan from Chang's Bank of China as reserve capital encouraging close cooperation between the two banks. Chen and Chang shared a vision of using private capital to develop and modernize the country. =Liu Hongsheng, Insurance and The China Development Bank= In 1927 K. P. Chen teamed up with Liu Hongsheng (1888‚Äì1956) to establish an insurance company. Three years later Liu Hongsheng mortgaged his new eight-story group office building to K. P. Chen to raise the capital for launching The China Development Bank. =China's Wartime Finance Advisor= K. P. Chen was head of China's Currency Stabilization Board. During World War II, the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank was devoted to consolidating the economy. In order to solve the financial problems, K. P. Chen represented the government of the Republic of China and negotiated with U.S.A. for loans. Some agreements were made: *1936: US-China Gold-Silver Agreement *1938: $25,000,000 Export-Import Bank loan *1939: Tung Oil Loan Agreement *1940: Tien Tin Loan Agreement In 1938 when the Chinese Ambassador Wellington Koo called on U. S. Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau to seek financial aid, the U. S. Secretary told him it might be advisable for the Chinese Government to send K. P. Chen (whom Morgenthau had negotiated with in the past) to America to enquire after credit for the purchase of flour and grain goods. In 1939 Finance Minister H.H. Kung, through K. P. Chen, endeavored to obtain assistance from the American Commercial Credit for the purchase of four airplanes, badly needed by the China National Aviation Corporation. K. P. Chen also participated in concluding a contract at Detroit to purchase 1,000 trucks from General Motors and Chrysler for the Chinese government. Reputation was important to him and he always made sure he kept his promises and by so doing, demonstrated integrity and ensured that China met its commitments. Time magazine on Monday, Apr. 6, 1942 reported that \\"Shy, determined Chinese financier K.P. Chen stuck a feather in his cap last week. From Chungking he wired Manhattan's Universal Trading Corp. to pay the final installment on a $22,000,000 Export-Import Bank loan smack on the tung- oil barrel head‚Äînearly two years before the last installment on the loan was due.\\" This showed U.S. Treasury officials that China could do business even when Japan controlled its coast. When he sought to borrow money from Washington in 1938, democracy was not considered good security but tung oil, essential in high-grade paints and varnishes, was. To make this work he founded Universal Trading Corp. in Manhattan to manage tung-oil sales, budgeting one-half of the proceeds to repay the debt. He also organized Foo Shing Trading Corp. in China to gather and ship the oil. K. P. Chen made outstanding contributions in stabilizing the monetary system and raising funds for war of resistance. After the communist revolution in mainland China, K.P. Chen followed the Kuomintang-led government to Taiwan, though his Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank was unable to reestablish its headquarters until 1954. In 1964, the bank was allowed to resume operations. It was the only private bank from the mainland which was allowed to resume commercial operations after the retreat to Taiwan. In 1976, K.P. Chen was succeeded by Chu Ju-tang as chairman of the bank. =Close Shave= In December 1941, K. P. Chen together with Finance Minister and Vice Premier H.H. Kung, his wife Soong Ai-ling and her sister, Madame Sun Yat-sen were caught in Hong Kong when war erupted in Asia. Amid a torrential downpour of bombs and artillery shells, K. P. Chen, Kung, and Madame Sun, were hustled into a plane, flown over the Japanese lines and set safely down, 200 miles inland. (From the Dec. 22, 1941 issue of TIME magazine). =Public Office= On April 17, 1947 Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, President of the National Government of the Republic of China nominated K. P. Chen to membership of the then new state council. =Champion of Human Capital Development= K. P. Chen believed in the power of people and saw his investment in their development as an investment in the future profits of the bank. He approved an annual budget of 12,000 tael in silver and invited a former manager of the Deutsch-Asiatische Bank to lecture his staff on the theory and practice of foreign exchange market. He set up an educational fund to send senior managers to America to continue their education and practice advanced banking skills there. The bank had a global business network through its overseas representative offices managed by its senior managers. =Other positions= *K. P. Chen, whose bank had been involved with the cotton industry since its early days, served as Chairman of the Cotton Control Commission or CCC. He was close to T. V. Soong, the Minister of Finance and Founder and Director of the National Economic Council, whose idea it was to make private entrepreneurs and capital a vital part of the CCC's nation- building efforts, and had long been involved in state-private projects sponsored by Soong. *K. P. Chen was the dynamic chairman of the Universal Trading Corporation (UTC), a wholly owned subsidiary of China's Nationalist Government, formed for the purpose of promoting Sino-American foreign trade. Chen, a successful, self-made capitalist entrepreneur, believed that UTC could be the perfect vehicle for his stewardship of China‚Äôs postwar economic reconstruction. He also placed a premium on Sino-American cooperation and communication. *K. P. Chen was Chairman of the China Committee of International Chamber of Commerce. He was also Chairman of China's Foreign Trade Commission. *K. P. Chen was a signatory to the 1938 appeal for U. S. support by 10 Chinese Associations in Shanghai following the occupation of Manchuria by Japan. (United States Department of State / Foreign relations of the United States diplomatic papers, 1932. The Far East Volume III (1932) -- The Far Eastern crisis: occupation of Manchuria by Japan and statement of policy by the United States, pp. 1‚Äì754) *K. P. Chen was a major financier of industrial projects. Often working together with others, he set up various textile, metals and trading companies. He was a member of the board of Fan Xudong's Yongli Group of Companies.  Evaluation  Chen is considered one of China's most important bankers in the 20th century. Linsun Cheng, in his Banking in Modern China: Entrepreneurs, Professional Managers, and the Development of Chinese, says, \\"It is almost impossible to describe any significant innovation in the history of modern Chinese banks without mentioning K. P. Chen's name.\\" On Monday, Mar. 18, 1940, Time magazine described him thus: \\"Middle-aged Banker Chen (University of Pennsylvania '09) looks so much like a Westerner's idea of a Chinese banker that wily and subtle-minded Americans have difficulty in believing he is as simple and direct as he is... bespectacled, careful, shy of the press, close-mouthed (in the Calvin Coolidge rather than Sumner Welles sense), he has no hobbies, makes no picturesque Oriental remarks, works 24 hours a day at the unglamorous business of cementing U.S.-Chinese trade relations, and considers Chinese repayment of U. S. loans his personal responsibility. His pride: that China has repaid $2,300,000 of her previous $25,000,000 loan, is now, because of U. S. needs for tung oil and tin, ahead of schedule.\\" The most important elements in his success were his American education and connections; his sense of professionalism (demonstrated by his opposition to official interference); his ability to compete and collaborate with foreign firms; his desire to innovate and explore various business strategies; his skill at obtaining community and professional support; and the unity of Chinese bankers.

When 1980s legends Sugar Ray Leonard, Thomas Hearns, as well as others retired, newer superstars filled the void: Pernell Whitaker, Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez, in the early 1990s, Oscar De La Hoya, F√©lix Trinidad, Roy Jones Jr. and Floyd Mayweather, Jr. in the mid to late 1990s. As for the heavyweight division, Mike Tyson's reign ended prematurely with the upset loss to Buster Douglas.

In 1915, it was founded by Chen Guangfu (K. P. Chen) in Shanghai, mainland China. Chen became the first president, and The-Chin Chuang was elected first chairman. Early years The bank was established in Shanghai in 1915 by Chen Guangfu, a graduate of the Wharton School of Finance and one of the most successful Chinese bankers of the 20th century.The Making of Modern Chinese Financial Entrepreneurship: The Case of Chen Guangfu by Pui-tak Lee, University of Hong Kong In 1931, the Bank completed the construction of its head office building in Shanghai, which was the most modern banking edifice in China at that time. The bank started its business with a capital of less than 100,000 silver dollars and with a workforce of four. In 1934, the bank had become the nation‚Äôs top private bank, with over 2,700 employees and over 110 branches.  World War 2  During World War II, the bank, with a new board of directors and supervisors, moved its head office to Chongqing, the wartime capital of Chinese resistance. The head office remained in Chongqing until the end of the war. In addition, the bank extended its banking network from the southeastern, middle, and northern parts of the country, to the southwestern and northwestern parts. Due to political reasons, the bank was forced to shut down in 1950.  Post-war  Shanghai Bank Tower in Taipei, head office of Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank In 1954, the bank accompanied the government to Taiwan and was allowed to establish its head office in Taipei to prepare for the resumption of business. It was not until June 1965 that the bank was approved to restart its operation in Taipei with a capital of NT$15 million. Chen was the chairman, and the bank was the only private mainland bank to relocate to Taiwan. During the resumption, the bank acted conservatively. The Savings Department and Kaohsiung Branch were set up in 1966 and 1971, respectively.

He came to power by ordering his men to kill his father in 209 BCE. Modu ruled from 209 BCE to 174 BCE. He was a military leader under his father Touman, and later Chanyu of the Xiongnu Empire, situated in modern-day Mongolia. He secured the throne and established a powerful Xiongnu Empire by successfully unifying the tribes of the Mongolian-Manchurian grassland in response to the loss of Xiongnu pasture lands to invading Qin forces commanded by Meng Tian in 215 BCE. While Modu rode and then furthered the wave of militarization and effectively centralized Xiongnu power, the Qin quickly fell into disarray with the death of the first emperor in 210, leaving Modu a free hand to expand his Xiongnu Empire into one of the largest of his time. Nicola di Cosmo, Ancient China and its Enemies: the Rise of Nomadic Power in East Asian History (Cambridge UP, 2002), 174‚Äì76 The eastern border stretched as far as the Liao River, the western borders of the empire reached the Pamir Mountains, whilst the northern border reached Lake Baikal. Modu was succeeded by his son Laoshang. Name His name M√≤d√πn (; Wade-Giles: Motun) is pronounced in Middle Chinese.; the name's Old Chinese pronunciation might have represented the pronunciation of the foreign word *ba…£tur, a relative of the later attested Central Eurasian culture word ba…£atur \\"hero\\". The etymology of this word is uncertain, although the first syllable is very likely the Iranian root *bag- \\"god, lord\\", which is an element in the titles of many later Central Eurasian people. Clauson claims the word to be an original Xiongnu name or title.Clauson, Gerard: An etymological dictionary of pre-thirteenth-century Turkish, Clarendon Press (Oxford), 1972. Entry: Bagatur His name was also read as Modun ~ Maodun Â¢®È†ì (MC *m…ôk-tu…ônX; following to Sima Zhen's commentary on Shiji) and Modu Â¢®ÊØí (MC: *m…ôk-duok; following Song Qi's commentary on Hanshu). Origins and rise to power According to Sima Qian, Modu was a gifted child but his father Touman wanted the son of another of his wives to succeed him. To eliminate Modu as a competitor to his chosen heir, Touman sent the young Modu to the Yuezhi as a hostage; then he attacked the Yuezhi in the hopes that they would kill Modu as retribution. Modu was able to escape this fate by stealing a fast horse and returned to the Xiongnu, who welcomed him as a hero. As reward for this show of bravery, his father appointed him the commander of 10,000 horsemen. Due to his reputation for bravery, Modu began to gather a group of extremely loyal warriors. He invented a signaling arrow that made a whistling sound in flight, and trained his men to shoot in the direction of the sound in synchrony. To be sure of his men's loyalty, Modu ordered the warriors to shoot his favourite horse, and anyone who refused were executed. He later repeated this test of loyalty, but with one of his favourite wives, and once again executed those who hesitated to obey his order. After he was sure of the absolute loyalty of his remaining warriors, he ordered them to shoot at his father during a hunting trip, killing him in a shower of arrows. With none of his followers failing to shoot at his command and the removal of his father, Modu proclaimed himself Chanyu of the Xiongnu. After his self-proclaimed ascension as Chanyu, Modu began to eliminate those who would prove a threat to his newly acquired power. Thus, he proceeded to execute his rival half-brother, his step-mother, and other Xiongnu officials who refused to support his rule. Rise of the Xiongnu Empire Domain and influence of the Xiongnu under Modu at the start of his rule. Modu's Xiongnu Empire aggressively protected and expanded their territory. When their eastern neighbors, the Donghu, expressed desire to occupy uninhabited land that lay between them, Modu reacted by attacking them. By 208 BCE, the Donghu had been defeated and their remnants split into the Xianbei and Wuhuan tribes. Modun went on to subdue the Dingling and other peoples to the north, and defeat the Yuezhi in 203 BCE. After these conquests, all Xiongnu lords submitted to him. With these victories, he was able to gain control of the important trade routes, which later supplied the Xiongnu with a large income. In 200 BCE, Xin, King of Han, surrendered to the Xiongnu at Mayi, Shuofang, Dai Commandery, and joined them in raiding Han territory. Emperor Gaozu of Han led an army against them and scattered their forces, defeating them several times before they retreated. Later Xin set up Zhao Li as King of Zhao and marched south against Gaozu. They too were defeated. Seeing the influence the Xiongnu had on his vassals, Gaozu marched north with a 320,000 strong army to confront them. However his men suffered from inadequate clothing to ward off the cold and a lack of supplies, so Gaozu left them behind and advanced to Pingcheng with only 40,000 men. Modu Chanyu saw his chance to turn the tide and immediately surrounded the city 300,000 cavalry, cutting the emperor off from the rest of his army. It's not clear why, but the Chanyu eventually withdrew some of his men. Sima Qian suggests his consort persuaded him to let the emperor escape. However a prolonged siege would have been impractical anyway since Xin's infantry never made it on time. Seeing the Chanyu's thinned lines, Gaozu sortied out and broke the siege. When Han reinforcements arrived, the Xiongnu withdrew. This came to be known as the Battle of Baideng. Gaozu's narrow escape from capture by the Xiongnu convinced him to make peace with his nomadic enemy. He sent one of his daughters to the Chanyu (heqin marriage alliance) and offered him silk, wine, and food stuffs. The Chanyu accepted the offer and restricted himself to minor raids throughout the duration of Gaozu's reign. After his Chinese campaign, Modu forced the Yuezhi and the Wusun to become vassals of the Xiongnu. In 195 BCE, Lu Wan King of Yan, fled to the Xiongnu after he was defeated by the Han general Zhou Bo. In 178 BCE, the Xiongnu overran the Yuezhi and Wusun in Gansu and the Tarim Basin. Modu died in 174 BCE and was succeeded by his son, Jiyu, who became Laoshang Chanyu. =Marriage proposal to Empress L√º Zhi= In 192 BC Empress Dowager L√º Zhi (widow of Emperor Gaozu of Han) received a marriage proposal from Modu, who wrote as follows in a letter meant to intimidate and mock her: > I'm a lonesome ruler born in marshes and raised in plains populated by > livestock. I've visited your border numerous times and wanted to tour China. > Your Majesty is now alone and living in solitude. Since both of us are not > happy and have nothing to entertain ourselves, I'm willing to use what I > possess to exchange for what you > lack.(Â≠§ÂÉ®‰πãÂêõÔºåÁîüÊñºÊ≤ÆÊæ§‰πã‰∏≠ÔºåÈï∑ÊñºÂπ≥ÈáéÁâõÈ¶¨‰πãÂüüÔºåÊï∏Ëá≥ÈÇäÂ¢ÉÔºåÈ°òÊ∏∏‰∏≠Âúã„ÄÇÈôõ‰∏ãÁç®Á´ãÔºåÂ≠§ÂÉ®Áç®Â±Ö„ÄÇÂÖ©‰∏ª‰∏çÊ®ÇÔºåÁÑ°‰ª•Ëá™ËôûÔºåÈ°ò‰ª•ÊâÄÊúâÔºåÊòìÂÖ∂ÊâÄÁÑ°„ÄÇ) Ban Gu > et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. L√º Zhi was infuriated at the rude proposition, and in a heated court session, her generals advised her to rally an army and exterminate the Xiongnu immediately. As she was about to declare war, an outspoken attendant named Ji Bu pointed out that the Xiongnu army was much more powerful than the Chinese. At Ji Bu's words, the court immediately fell into a fearful silence.Records of the Grand Historian, v. 100, Burton Watson translation page 249 Rethinking her plans, L√º Zhi rejected Modu's proposition humbly, as follows: > Your Lordship does not forget our land and writes a letter to us, we fear. I > retreat to preserve myself. I'm old and frail, I'm losing hair and teeth, > and I struggle to maintain balance when I move. Your Lordship has heard > wrongly, you shouldn't defile yourself.

However she continued implementing the heqin policy of marrying Han princesses to Xiongnu chieftains and paying tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between both sides.(Âõ†ÁçªÈ¶¨ÔºåÈÅÇÂíåË¶™„ÄÇËá≥Â≠ùÊñáÂç≥‰ΩçÔºåÂæ©‰øÆÂíåË¶™„ÄÇ) Ban Gu et al. Book of Han, Volume 94, Traditions of the Xiongnu. Analysis of the Xiongnu rise As Nicola Di Cosmo summarizes the sequence of events, the Qin invasion of the Ordos Plateau (the area within the bend of the Yellow River) came at the same time as a leadership crisis within the loose Xiongnu confederation. Modu took advantage of the Xiongnu militarization process that came in response to the Qin invasion, and ably created a newly centralized political structure that made possible his empire. He was aided by the rapid fall of Qin and the fact that the Han initially set up independent \\"kingdoms,\\" whose leaders, like Xin, King of Han, were as likely to ally with Xiongnu and attack Han as the other way around. Han weakness meant that it supplied Modu and his successors with a steady flow of luxury and staple tribute they could pass down to the aristocracy supporting them. Without that tribute, the Xiongnu might not have been able to expand and maintain control. Later legends Christopher I. Beckwith has pointed out that the story of the young Modu resembles a widespread class of folk tales in which a young hero is abandoned, goes on a quest, proves his worth, gains a group of trusted companions, returns to his home country, slays a powerful figure and becomes a king.Christopher I. Beckwith, Empires of the Silk Road, 2009, Chapter One. The name of Maodun has been associated with Oghuz Khagan, a mythological ancestor of the Turkic peoples. The reason for that is a striking similarity of the Oghuz Khagan biography in the Turco-Persian tradition (Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, Husayni Isfahani, Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur) with the Maodun biography in the Chinese sources (feud between the father and son and murder of the former, the direction and sequence of conquests, etc.), which was first noticed by Hyacinth (Compilation of reports, pp. 56‚Äì57).Bichurin N.Ya., \\"Compilation of reports on peoples inhabiting Central Asia in ancient times\\", vol. 1, Sankt Petersburg, 1851, pp. 56‚Äì57Taskin V.S., \\"Materials on history of S√ºnnu\\", transl., 1968, Vol. 1, p. 129 Another suggestion connects it with the name of the Magyar royal tribe of the Hungarians and with their distant relatives the Mators, now extinct.E. Helismki ‚Äì Die Matorische Sprache, 1997, Studia Uralo- Altaica 41, pg. 64. Maodun has been linked with the Dulo clan known from the Nominalia of the Bulgarian khansO.

Despite his very modest origins, he was attracted very young to the Navy. After having been a simple seaman on behalf of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, from which he was excluded for having killed his corporal, he became a privateer in the Mediterranean Sea then joined the Royal Navy at the request of Richelieu and fought during the whole Franco-Spanish War (1635-1659). His numerous victories earned him the appointment of lieutenant-general and vice-admiral of the Levant. He is named a knight of grace and commander by the great master Martin de Redin. He ended his career in 1666 by transporting to Lisbon the princess of Savoie-Nemours, future queen of Portugal. Skilled courtier, he did not forget his modest origins and knew how to be generous.  Origins and Youth  According to unconfirmed rumors, he is the son of a laundress and of Paul de Fortia, Marquis of Piles, governor of the Chateau d'If. However, Captain Georges Bourgoin, perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts in Marseille, discovered that the Chevalier Paul was not the natural child of the Marquis and a washerwoman. It highlights his legitimate parentage of an officer from a Catholic and bourgeois family in the Dauphin√©, Captain Elzias Samuel and young lady Jeanne Riche, married in Marseille. The Council of the Grand Priory of Saint-Gilles, in view of the documents produced, concludes indeed, the November 14, 1633he was \\"worthy to be received among the brothers -arms and go to the convent in Malta .\\" The transformation of his surname Samuel into Samuel or Saumeur would have been intended to avoid allusions to a distant Jewish origin,http://nonnobisdominenonnobissednominituodagloriam.unblog.fr/2007/08/01/les- templiers-et-la-marine/ He always calls himself \\"Capitan Pol\\". He spent the first years of his life at Ch√¢teau d'If with Father Julien de Malauc√®ne, but very young, he felt the desire to travel. He embarked as foam for three years before entering the service of a commander of the order of St. John of Jerusalem, as a sailor. Saumeur began sailing at the age of twelve in the navy of the Order of Malta. He distinguished himself in a naval engagement by defeating two Turkish galleys, replacing his captain after he was killed. Saumeur kept the command of the ship and in another fight he defeated five Ottoman ships, sinking two of them and capturing a third. He was knighted in 1637. As Richelieu was seeking officers for the newly organised French Navy, Saumeur enlisted and was given command of the ship Neptune. He took part in several campaigns against Spain, commanding the Grand Anglois and the Licorne on which he played an important part in winning the Battle of Guetaria. In 1650, Saumeur was titled and promoted to squadron commander (chef d'escadre), setting his flag on the Reine. He was again promoted to Rear-admiral (Lieutenant g√©n√©ral) in 1654, and wounded the next year. See also * Three ships of the French Navy were named in his honour. See French ship Chevalier Paul.

The first attested use with the meaning of \\"orgasm\\" was only in 1882. In modern usage, this term has generally been interpreted to describe the post-orgasmic state of unconsciousness that some people have after having some sexual experiences. More widely, it can refer to the spiritual release that comes with orgasm or to a short period of melancholy or transcendence as a result of the expenditure of the \\"life force.\\" Literary critic Roland Barthes spoke of la petite mort as the chief objective of reading literature, the feeling one should get when experiencing any great literature. The term \\"la petite mort\\" does not always apply to sexual experiences. It can also be used when some undesired thing has happened to a person and has affected them so much that \\"a part of them dies inside.\\" A literary example of this is found in Thomas Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles when he uses the phrase to describe how Tess feels after she comes across a particularly gruesome omen after meeting with her own rapist: > She felt the petite mort at this unexpectedly gruesome information, and left > the solitary man behind her. The term \\"little death,\\" a direct translation of la petite mort, can also be used in English to essentially the same effect. Specifically, it is defined as \\"a state or event resembling or prefiguring death; a weakening or loss of consciousness, specifically in sleep or during an orgasm,\\" a nearly identical definition to that of the original French.

He played college baseball at the University of Tennessee. In 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Yarmouth-Dennis Red Sox. Professional career Drafted by the Colorado Rockies in the 4th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft, Hudson would make his Major League Baseball debut with the Cincinnati Reds on July 1, 2002. He did not pitch in the majors in 2003, but he made it back with the Reds in 2004, when he had a brief but successful stint in which he had a 4-2 record and a 2.42 ERA in nine starts. In 2005, he struggled, going 6-9 with a 6.38 ERA. He was released by the Reds on March 9, 2006 before being acquired by the Kansas City Royals on March 13. Hudson began the 2006 season pitching for the Kansas City Royals as a reliever. However, he struggled, going 1-3 with a 7.24 ERA while allowing 11 ER over 13 IP. He was converted to a starter, and he did well initially, going 4-0 with a 3.68 ERA in his first six starts. However, on August 13, in his seventh start with the team, Hudson had easily the worst start of his career, surrendering 11 runs, 10 of them earned, over just 1/3 of an inning against the Cleveland Indians. The Indians scored seven runs before making an out, one shy of the major league record of eight, and they scored the eighth through eleventh runs when Hudson gave up a grand slam to Travis Hafner, Hafner's Major League record- tying sixth grand slam of the season. After the rough outing against Cleveland, Hudson finished the 2006 season by going 2-2 with a 3.86 ERA over his last eight starts. In 2007, Hudson remained with the Royals, but was hampered by injuries, including two separate trips to the 15-day disabled list. He had only one appearance, giving up five runs in two innings on May 10 in a 17-3 loss to the Oakland A's. He underwent right shoulder surgery in June, ending his season. Due to a slow recovery from the surgery, Hudson again began the 2008 season on the disabled list, and on April 1, , he announced his retirement.Luke Hudson calls it quits Personal Hudson's father, Bill, a very talented water-colorist, owns an art materials company in California; Luke works as director of marketing in the off season.

Giambattista Marino (also Giovan Battista Marini) (14 October 1569 - 26 March 1625)Russo (ed.), Adone (BUR Classici, 2013), page 31 and page 41 was an Italian poet who was born in Naples. He is most famous for his long epic L'Adone. The Cambridge History of Italian Literature thought him to be \\"one of the greatest Italian poets of all time\\". He is considered the founder of the school of Marinism, later known as Secentismo (17th century) or Marinismo (19th century), characterised by its use of extravagant and excessive conceits. Marino's conception of poetry, which exaggerated the artificiality of Mannerism, was based on an extensive use of antithesis and a whole range of wordplay, on lavish descriptions and a sensuous musicality of the verse, and enjoyed immense success in his time, comparable to that of Petrarch before him. He was widely imitated in Italy, France (where he was the idol of members of the pr√©cieux school, such as Georges Scud√©ry, and the so-called libertins such as Tristan l'Hermite), Spain (where his greatest admirer was Lope de Vega) and other Catholic countries, including Portugal and Poland, as well as Germany, where his closest follower was Christian Hoffmann von Hoffmannswaldau and Holland where Constantijn Huygens was a great admirer. In England he was admired by John Milton and translated by Richard Crashaw. He remained the reference point for Baroque poetry as long as it was in vogue. In the 18th and 19th centuries, while being remembered for historical reasons, he was regarded as the source and exemplar of Baroque \\"bad taste\\". With the 20th century renaissance of interest in similar poetic procedures, his work has been reevaluated: it was closely read by Benedetto Croce and Carlo Calcaterra and has had numerous important interpreters including Giovanni Pozzi, Marziano Guglielminetti, Marzio Pieri and Alessandro Martini. Life Marino remained in his birthplace Naples until 1600, leading a life of pleasure after breaking off relations with his father who wanted his son to follow a career in law. These formative years in Naples were very important for the development of his poetry, even though most of his career took place in the north of Italy and France. Regarding this subject, some critics (including Giovanni Pozzi) have stressed the great influence on him exerted by northern Italian cultural circles; others (such as Marzio Pieri) have emphasised the fact that the Naples of the time, though partly in decline and oppressed by Spanish rule, was far from having lost its eminent position among the capitals of Europe. Marino's father was a highly cultured lawyer, from a family probably of Calabrian origin, who frequented the coterie of Giambattista Della Porta. It seems that both Marino and his father took part in private theatrical performances of their host's plays at the house of the Della Porta brothers. But more importantly, these surroundings put Marino in direct contact with the natural philosophy of Della Porta and the philosophical systems of Giordano Bruno and Tommaso Campanella. While Campanella himself was to oppose \\"Marinism\\" (though not attacking it directly), this common speculative background should be borne in mind with its important pantheistic (and thus neo-pagan and heterodox) implications, to which Marino would remain true all his life and exploit in his poetry, obtaining great success amongst some of the most conformist thinkers on the one hand while encountering continual difficulties because of the intellectual content of his work on the other. Other figures who were particularly influential on the young Marino include Camillo Pellegrini, who had been a friend of Torquato Tasso (Marino knew Tasso personally, if only briefly, at the house of Giovan Battista Manso and exchanged sonnets with him). Pellegrini was the author of Il Carrafa overo della epica poesia, a dialogue in honour of Tasso, in which the latter was rated above Ludovico Ariosto. Marino himself is the protagonist of another of the prelate's dialogues, Del concetto poetico (1599). Marino gave himself up to literary studies, love affairs and a life of pleasure so unbridled that he was arrested at least twice. In this as in many other ways, the path he took resembles that of another great poet of the same era with whom he was often compared, Gabriello Chiabrera. But an air of mystery surrounds Marino's life, especially the various times he spent in prison; one of the arrests was due to procuring an abortion for a certain Antonella Testa, daughter of the mayor of Naples, but whether she was pregnant by Marino or one of his friends is unknown; the second conviction (for which he risked a capital sentence) was due to the poet's forging episcopal bulls in order to save a friend who had been involved in a duel. But some witnesses, who include both Marino's detractors (such as Tommaso Stigliani) and defenders (such as the printer and biographer Antonio Bulifoni in a life of the poet which appeared in 1699) have firmly asserted that Marino, much of whose love poetry is heavily ambiguous, had homosexual tendencies. Elsewhere, the reticence of the sources on this subject is obviously due to the persecutions to which \\"sodomitical practices\\" were particularly subject during the Counterreformation. Marino then fled Naples and moved to Rome, first joining the service of Melchiore Crescenzio then that of Cardinal Aldobrandini. In 1608 he moved to the court of Duke Carlo Emanuele I in Turin. This was not an easy time for the poet, in fact he was the victim of an assassination attempt by his rival Gaspare Murtola. He was later sentenced to a year in prison, probably for malicious gossip he had written about the duke.Russo, op. cit. pages 35-36 In 1615 he left Turin and moved to Paris, where he remained until 1623, honoured by the court and admired by French literary circles. He returned to Italy in triumph and died in Naples in 1625.Russo, op. cit., pages 39-41 Works Marino wrote a large amount, both in prose and verse. His poetry remains the most admired and imitated part of his work. =Poetry= Le Rime (1602) and La lira (1614) Rime del cav. Marini (1674) Marino originated a new, \\"soft, graceful and attractive\\" style for a new public, distancing himself from Torquato Tasso and Renaissance Petrarchism as well as any kind of Aristotelian rule. His new approach can be seen in the Rime of 1602, later expanded under the title La lira (The Lyre) in 1614, which is made up of erotic verse, encomiastic and sacred pieces, arranged either by theme (sea poems, rustic poems, love poems, funereal poems, religious poems) or by verse form (madrigal, canzone). They often hark back to the Classical traditions of Latin and Greek literature, with a particular fondness for the love poems of Ovid and the Dolce stil nuovo tradition of Italian verse, showing a strong experimental tension with anti-Petrachan tendencies. In 1620 Marino published La Sampogna, a collection of poems divided into two parts: one consisting of pastoral idylls and another of \\"rustic\\" verse. Thus Marino distanced himself from love, heroic and sacred themes in favour of the mythological and bucolic. L'Adone Title page of L'Adone L'Adone (Adonis), which was published in Paris in 1623 and dedicated to the French king Louis XIII, is a mythological poem written in ottava rima divided into twenty cantos. =The plot= The poem deals with the love of the goddess Venus for Prince Adonis, who escapes from a sea storm to take refuge on the island of Cyprus, the site of the goddess's palace. Cupid uses his arrows to make his mother and Adonis fall in love with one another. Adonis listens to Cupid and Mercury telling love stories and is then led to the Garden of Pleasure, which is divided into five parts, one for each of the senses, and to the fountain of Apollo. Jealousy warns the god Mars of Venus's new love and he heads for Cyprus. When Adonis finds out Mars is on his way, he flees and is transformed into a parrot for refusing the goddess's love. Having regained his human form thanks to Mercury, he is taken captive by a band of robbers. Adonis returns to Cyprus where he wins a contest of beauty, is made ruler of the island and is reunited with Venus. But Mars has Adonis killed on a hunting expedition by a wild boar. He dies in the arms of Venus and his heart is transformed into a red flower, the anemone. The poem ends with a long description of the funeral games in honour of the dead youth. =Narrative technique= Into this flimsy framework Marino inserts the most famous stories from mythology, including the Judgement of Paris, Cupid and Psyche, Echo and Narcissus, Hero and Leander, Polyphemus and numerous others. Thus the poem, which was originally intended to be only three cantos in length, was so enriched that it became one of the longest epics in Italian literature, made up of 5123 eight-line stanzas (40,984 verses), an immense story with digressions from the main theme and descriptive pauses. All this tends to characterise \\"L‚ÄôAdone\\" as a labyrinth of entangled situations without any real structure. The lengthy Canto XX, which takes place after the protagonist's death, serves to undermine any pretence to narrative unity. But this very lack of unity constitutes Marino's narrative innovation. The poet composes his work using various levels and passes from one episode to the next without any apparent logical connection, basing the links solely on a language rich in hyperboles, antitheses and metaphors. In Adone, Marino quotes and rewrites passages from Dante's Divine Comedy, Ariosto, Tasso and the French literature of the day. The aim of these borrowings is not plagiarism but rather to introduce an erudite game with the reader who must recognise the sources and appreciate the results of the revision. Marino challenges the reader to pick up on the quotations and to enjoy the way in which the material has been reworked, as part of a conception of poetic creation in which everything in the world (including the literature of the past) can become the object of new poetry. In this way, Marino also turns Adone into a kind of poetic encyclopaedia, which collects and modernises all the previous productions of human genius. The poem is also evidence of a new sensibility connected with the latest scientific discoveries (see for example the eulogy of Galileo in Canto X) and geographical findings (such as Canto VII with its praise of the passiflora, a plant recently imported into Europe from the Americas). Thus Adone, in spite of its technical virtuosity, is a work rich in authentic poetry written in a style which often achieves perfection of rhythm.  Other works in verse  Marino wrote other works in verse such as: I panegirici (\\"The Panegyrics\\"); La galleria (\\"The Gallery\\", descriptions of paintings and sculptures); the sacred poem in four cantos, La strage degli innocenti (\\"The Massacre of the Innocents\\"); the epic fragments Gerusalemme distrutta and Anversa liberata (still of uncertain attribution) inspired by Tasso; interesting and ingenious burlesque compositions such as La Murtoleide (81 satirical sonnets against Gaspare Murtola), the \\"capitolo\\" Lo stivale; Il Pupulo alla Pupula (burlesque letters) etc. Many works were announced but never written, including the long poem Le trasformazioni, inspired by Ovid's Metamorphoses, which was abandoned after Marino turned his attention to Adone. =Prose works= Most notable are the Dicerie sacre (1614), a sort of oratorical handbook for priests, which was considered indispensable by generations of preachers; in its enormously long sermons, which in reality have little to do with religion, Marino takes his transcendent technique of continuous metaphor to an extreme; a feat imitated throughout the Baroque era. More interesting for the modern reader are the \\"Letters\\", an eloquent document of his artistic and personal experience. In them Marino rejects the accusation of sensuality levelled at his poetry, explaining that he was only living up to the expectations of the ruling class, as can be seen in a letter to Duke Carlo Emanuele I. Influence Marino was famous in his time and acclaimed by his contemporaries as the successor and moderniser of Tasso. His influence on Italian and other literature in the 17th century was immense. In fact he was the representative of a Europe-wide movement which included pr√©ciosit√© in France, Euphuism in England and culteranismo in Spain. =Music= Marino's verse was very popular with contemporary Italian composers, including Claudio Monteverdi who set several of Marino's poems in his collections of madrigals, beginning with the Sixth Book published in 1614. In 1626, Domenico Mazzocchi drew on Marino's epic for his opera La catena d'Adone (\\"The Chain of Adonis\\"). Filippo Bonaffino also set some of his work to music in book of madrigals. =Later literature= Marino is the subject of the short prose fiction \\"Una rosa amarilla\\" (\\"A Yellow Rose\\") by Jorge Luis Borges. It appeared in the collection El hacedor in 1960. Criticism For a long time critics, who had a negative assessment of Marino's work from the end of the 17th to the last decades of the 20th century, maintained that the poet's intention was to astound his readers through the elegance of the poem's details and his descriptions. But Adone, along with a great deal of Baroque literature, has been reevaluated, starting in the 1960s with Giovanni Getto, who was followed by the critic Marzio Pieri in 1975 and by Giovanni Pozzi in 1988, who, while denying the presence of a structure, recognised a highly refined form in the poem which he defined as \\"bilocal and elliptical\\", reflecting the \\"hesitation of 17th century man between two contradictory models of the universe, the Ptolemaic and the Copernican\\". More recently, in 2002 Marie-France Tristan's essay La Sc√®ne de l'√©criture appeared in France, stressing the philosophical element of Marino's poetry.

In 1923, the Association for Contemporary Music was founded for avant-garde composers. Mosolov, his teacher Nikolai Myaskovsky, Dmitri Shostakovich, and other composers joined. Iron Foundry was originally composed for the ballet Stal with a scenario by Inna Chernetskaya. Stal was never staged; instead Iron Foundry was presented as the first movement of an orchestral suite from the ballet, premiered in Moscow on December 4, 1927, in a concert by the Association for Contemporary Music commemorating the tenth anniversary of the Russian Revolution.Nelson 2004, p. 200. The same concert featured Shostakovich's Second Symphony, Nikolai Roslavets' cantata October, and Leonid Polovinkin's Prologue.Sitsky 1994, p. 61.Ferenc 2004, p. 12. Mosolov's composition was performed at the eighth International Society for Contemporary Music festival in Li√®ge on September 6, 1930, where it was critically acclaimed. One critic said of the piece, \\"We have ... a kind of lyrical theme, the song of steel, or possible of man, the ironmaster. ... [I]t is an essentially musical idea carried out with convincing skill, and as a concluding piece to an orchestral programme it deserves to become popular.\\"Evans 1930, p. 901. At the Hollywood Bowl in 1931, Iron Foundry was used as the music to Adolph Bolm's ballet, The Spirit of the Factory‚Äîknown also as Ballet m√©canique (not to be confused with the 1924 composition by George Antheil), Mechanical Ballet, and The Iron FoundryHammer 1997, p. 192.‚Äîwhich opened to \\"rousing ovations, rapturous reviews, and popular demands\\" for an encore performance.Hammer 1997, p. 191. This was the first time Iron Foundry was performed for a stage performance, although it was never staged as originally intended. Metallica performed the piece with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, Michael Tilson Thomas conducting, during their S&M2; concerts at Chase Center, San Francisco on September 6th and 8th, 2019.https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/metallica-and-san-francisco- symphony-supersize-the-hits-at-sampm2-gig/ar-AAGWN3Q  Instrumentation Iron Foundry is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, English horn, two clarinets, bass clarinet, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, and tuba, timpani, snare drum, bass drum, cymbals, tam-tam, iron sheet, and strings.  Analysis  The piece is written in ternary form. It begins with an allegro section, consisting of brief chromatic figures across the orchestra that build slowly to a trio section, after which it returns to the feeling of the allegro beginning for the coda. In this way Mosolov \\"coordinates the mechanistic rhythms into specific orchestral groups that work together like cogs in a well-oiled machine.\\"Lewis 2005, p. 882. Mosolov uses a live orchestra to create a factory-like sound, unlike Antheil's Ballet m√©canique, which uses mechanical elements to reach its musical goals.Kozlenko 1937, p. 302. = Introduction = The piece begins as a representation of the start of the machine, with a tam-tam stroke and repetitious figures that begin in a few instruments and, measure by measure, are added to the sound until the instruments join together to suggest the sound of a factory at work. By measure twenty-seven, the overlapping instruments create a deliberate and machine-like sound above which the horns are directed to stand and play the main theme of the piece. = Trio = At the trio, the machine suddenly shuts down. Upper winds and the snare drum push forward to a syncopated exchange between the low brass and upper winds and marked by the bass drum and tam-tam. This gives way to a steady, march-like timpani motif that drives the orchestra back to the atmosphere of the beginning. = Coda = Now the machine has returned to full power. Musical ideas from the introduction are reintroduced, and the piccolo and iron sheet are added to the texture. Some performances, including those of the Interlochen Arts Academy and Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, interpret the iron sheet part (see figure) as both for iron sheet and orchestral anvil, with anvil strikes on every beat as indicated by the vertical accents; however, the conductor's score published by Kalmus includes a note that the sheet is to be vibrated at each vertical accent and for the sheet to vibrate naturally between beats.Mosolov ed. Kalmus p. 3. The last ten measures of the piece accelerate and grow louder until the penultimate measure, where most of the instrumentation drops away. The horn and trumpet play a brief figure and the full orchestra returns to end the piece with a sforzando stab.

Summary Hayward analyzes the role of Adolf Hitler's use and control of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Stalingrad between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union during World War II. Hayward discusses at length the various reasons for Hitler's invasion, the consequences, the major battles of the Eastern Front and the role of the Luftwaffe in these areas, along with the hierarchy of the Luftwaffe itself. He deals with how Hitler's control of the Luftwaffe during this battle ultimately led to the German loss at the Battle of Stalingrad, the turning point against the Germans in World War II.

The building was constructed in 1904 by the architectural firm of D. H. Burnham & Company under the commission of Otto Young, a real estate investor and wholesale jeweler. It received its name from the son in law of Otto Young, Lawrence Heyworth, who also supervised construction of the building. Like many other buildings along Wabash Avenue, the Heyworth historically housed watchmakers, jewelers, and associated businesses. This structure was one of the final buildings designed by Frederick P. Dinkelberg at the firm before administration was turned over to Ernest Robert Graham. The Heyworth stands 19 stories tall with a gross square footage of . Its style strays from the typical designs of Burnham and Root, appearing more rigid and geometrical than their other works done in a classical style. It combined the Chicago School's structurally expressive character with decorative appearance common in traditional masonry architecture. The tapestry-like ornament of the building pairs well with the ornamentation designed by Louis Sullivan on the adjacent Sullivan Center building. The Heyworth is also noted for its intact finely crafted decorative cornice, which is an uncommon feature among the other commercial buildings of Chicago. The building was designated a Chicago Landmark on August 30, 2000. According to a real estate firm that manages the property, the height of the building is listed in various documents as 260, 273, and . The building was provided an $11 million renovation in 2001.

These ants form colonies with multiple nests in trees, each nest being made of leaves stitched together using the silk produced by the ant larvae. Description Workers and major workers are mostly coloured orange. Workers are long; they look after larvae and farm scale bugs for honeydew. Major workers are long, with long strong legs and large mandibles. They forage, assemble and expand the nest. Queens are typically long, and normally greenish-brown. Distribution and habitat Oecophylla smaragdina has a widespread distribution in tropical Asia and Australia, its range extending from India through Indonesia and the Philippines to Northern Territory and Queensland in Australia. It is an arboreal species, making its nests among the foliage of trees. Nests are constructed during the night, with major workers weaving towards the exterior and minor workers completing the interior structure. The ant colony may have several nests in one tree, or the nests may be spread over several adjacent trees; colonies can reach up to half a million individuals. In one instance, a colony occupied 151 nests distributed among twelve trees. Each colony has a single queen, in one of these nests, and her progeny are carried to other nests of the colony. The average life of a mature colony may be eight years. Ecology Weaver ants of this species are important parts of the ecosystem in tree canopies in humid tropical regions. The nests of this species are constructed by the workers, with leaves being woven together and secured by silk produced by the larvae. First a row of ants line up along the edge of a green leaf and, grasping a nearby leaf, pull the two leaves together, edge to edge. Other workers on the far side of the leaves, each carrying a larva in its mouth, apply the tips of the abdomens of the larvae to each leaf edge in turn. This produces a suture of fine silken threads that secures the leaves together. More leaves are attached in a similar manner to enlarge the nest. Weaver ants feed on insects and other invertebrates, their prey being mainly beetles, flies and hymenopterans. They do not sting, but have a painful bite into which they can secrete irritant chemicals from their abdomens. In Singapore, colonies are often found in sea hibiscus and great morinda trees which entice the ants with nectar, the trees in return receiving protection from herbivorous insects. In Indonesia, the trees supporting colonies include banana, coconut, oil palm, rubber tree, cacao, teak, jackfruit, mango, Chinese laurel, petai, jengkol, duku, rambutan, jambu air and kedondong. The ants also attend aphids, scale insects and other homopterans to feed on the honeydew they produce, especially in tree canopies linked by lianas. For this purpose, they drive away other ant species from the parts of the canopy where these sap-sucking insects live. Another association is with the larvae of certain blue butterflies In Australia, the common oak-blue, the bright oak-blue and the purple oak-blue are obligate associates and only occur in parts of the country where the weaver ant is established. Shelters may be built by the ants close to their nests specially to protect these assets. Some species of jumping spiders, such as myrmecophilic associate Cosmophasis bitaeniata, prey on the green tree ants by mimicking them with deceptive chemical scents. Disguised as one of them, the jumping spiders access their nests to consume the larvae and lay their own eggs alongside the nest, so that spiderlings can easily reach the ant larvae. Uses Weaver ants can bite humans when disturbed. Angkor Wat, Cambodia The larvae and pupae are collected and processed into bird food and fish bait in Indonesia, are used in Chinese and Indian traditional medicine, and consumed as a delicacy in Thailand and other countries. In Java, Indonesia the larvae and pupae of these ants are known as kroto and are harvested commercially for use as captive songbird food and as fishing bait. Songbirds are very popular in Java and the ant larvae provide a good balanced diet of proteins, minerals and vitamins. Kroto can be bought from pet shops or can be gathered fresh from the countryside. As bait for fish, the larvae are mixed with chicken eggs, maize, beans and honey. In some parts of India, the adult ants are used in traditional medicine as a remedy for rheumatism, and an oil made from them is used for stomach infections and as an aphrodisiac. In Thailand and the Philippines the larvae and pupae are eaten and are said to have a taste variously described as creamy, sour and lemony. In some parts of this ant's range, colonies are used as a natural form of pest control. Crops that have been protected in this way have included cowpea,Devasahayam, S.; Anita Devasahayam (2019) Controlling insect pests in cowpea with weaver ants. Accessed from: https://besgroup.org/2019/06/27/controlling-insect-pests-in-cowpea-with- weaver-ants/. cashew, citrus, mango, coconut, cocoa and coffee. The oldest written record of the use of these ants to control pests is their use in China in 304 AD to control pests in citrus. The ants are aggressive towards humans, and in Sri Lanka ant protection has been abandoned in coffee culture, because picking the crop proved too \\"painful\\".

It is an interactive movie which requires the player to press a button or move the joystick in a particular direction when prompted by the game to progress the storyline. The game uses animation from two Lupin III films, most prominently The Castle of Cagliostro, as well as The Mystery of Mamo. The segments from The Mystery of Mamo use the original English dub commissioned by Toho, while the segments from The Castle of Cagliostro use a dub created for the game. A scene showing the protagonist being hanged after the player made a mistake was originally included, but an option was added to the game to turn it off.  Plot  The game's plot is based loosely on that of The Castle of Cagliostro, and follows Cliff (Ars√®ne Lupin III) as he attempts to rescue Clarissa (Lady Clarisse d'Cagliostro) from the evil Count Draco (in some materials called \\"Dreyco\\"Dragons-lair-project.com and in the instruction manual \\"Dragoe\\"), who wants to marry her. Cliff is aided in his quest by Jeff (Daisuke Jigen) and Samurai (Goemon Ishikawa XIII).  Development  The game was originally edited at Associated Audio Visual, Inc., in Evanston, Illinois. Jack Bornoff, was the editor, Paul Rubenstein, was editorial supervisor. Cliff Hanger uses a feedback loop to read frame details from the game laserdisc. This prevents the laserdisc and gameplay from ever going out of sync (a common occurrence in other laserdisc games as the disc players aged). The original version of Cliff Hanger shows an animated sequence of Cliff being hanged at the gallows immediately following the \\"miss\\" animation sequence. The sequence was taken from the opening sequence of The Mystery of Mamo (where Lupin was supposedly hanged in Transylvania), plus a later scene in the same film. According to the instruction manual, a setting on the game cabinet's logic board would allow the individual owners/operators the option of not playing the sequence if they so chose.  Legacy  The game was considered for inclusion on the American Blu-ray release of The Castle of Cagliostro by Discotek Media, however, due to an inability to find the original contracts for the game, it was left off the release. The television show Starcade featured a special episode where rather than playing the usual three games, the contestants played three rounds of Cliff Hanger. The winner of the show, Mark Walsh, won a Cliff Hanger cabinet.

The district was created on 14 April 1853 from northern Blockley Township ceased to exist and on 2 February 1854 and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854. The name Belmont is still used as a neighborhood name for the area, although it no longer refers to any legal entity. Similar name- inheritance (where the name of a former municipality lives on as a neighborhood name without formal definition) is also seen in other Philadelphia neighborhoods. History Belmont District was created by act of the Assembly on April 14, 1853. It embraced the part of Blockley Township which lay along the Schuylkill River from the northern boundary-line of West Philadelphia to the northern boundary-line between Philadelphia and Montgomery counties, and had also its western boundary on that line. This district had scarcely time to be organized before the Act of Consolidation of February 2, 1854, put an end to its franchises. The name was derived from Belmont, the country seat of the Peters family, which is now part of Fairmount Park. The mansion was erected by William Peters about 1743, and the name was descriptive of the fine position of the property and suggestive of the beautiful views of the river and valley of the Schuylkill. The property became the estate of Judge Richard Peters, Jr., of the United States District Court; he lived there until his death, August 22, 1828.

Allosauroids, alongside the family Megalosauroidea, were among the apex predators that were active during the Middle Jurassic to Late Cretaceous periods. Of the fourteen allosauroid taxa, five are known for specimens with relatively complete skulls; the taxa are Allosaurus, Sinraptor, Yangchuanosaurus, Carchardontosaurus, and Acrocanthosaurus. The most famous and best understood allosauroid is the North American genus Allosaurus. The oldest-known allosauroid, Shidaisaurus jinae, appeared in the early Middle Jurassic (probably Bajocian stage) of China. The last known definitive surviving members of the group died out around 93 million years ago in Asia (Shaochilong) and South America (Mapusaurus), though the megaraptorans may belong to the group as well. Additional, but highly fragmentary, remains probably belonging to carcharodontosaurids have been found from the Late Maastrichtian (70-66 Ma ago) in Brazil. An alternative interpretation is to attribute the remains to abelisaurids, which share the distinct pattern of curved wrinkled enamel found in the Brazilian remains with the carcharodontosaurids. This similarity between abelisaurids and carcharodontosaurids means that a definitive match between the Brazilian fossil and carcharodontosaurids cannot be made. Allosauroids had long, narrow skulls, large orbits, three-fingered hands, and usually had \\"horns\\" or ornamental crests on their heads. Although allosauroids vary in size, the group maintains a similar center of mass and hip position on their bodies. Allosauroids also exhibit reptilian-style immune systems, secreting fibrin at injured sites to prevent infections from spreading through the bloodstream. This characteristic has been observed by examining injuries and infections on allosauroid bones. It is possible that allosauroids were social animals, as many remains of allosauroids have been found in close proximity to each other. Allosauroids were likely active predators, and from studying endocasts, probably best responded to odors and loud low-frequency noises.  Description  Size comparison of seven allosauroids Allosauroids share certain distinctive features, one of which is a triangular-shaped pubic boot. Allosauroids have 3 fingers per hand, with the second and third digit being approximately equal in length. The femur is larger than the tibia. Another defining feature of allosauroids is that the chevron bases on their tails have anterior and posterior bone growth.Mateus, Oct√°vio. (1997). Lourinhanosaurus antunesi, A New Upper Jurassic Allosauroid (Dinosauria: Theropoda) from Lourinh√£, Portugal. M√©morias da Academia Ci√™ncas de Lisboa. 37. The body of allosauroids can reach up to 10 meters in length; the length of the body from the tail to the hip is between 54% and 62% of the total body length, and the length of the body from the head to the hip is between 38% and 46% of the total body length. Allosauroids scaled their limbs relative to their body in a way similar to how other large theropods, like the tyrannosaurids, did. During the Cretaceous, some allosauroids grew to sizes similar to those of the largest tyrannosaurids. These large allosauroids lived in the same time period as the other large theropods found in the upper Morrison and Tendaguru formations. Allosauroids maintained a similar center of mass across all sizes, which is found to be between 37% and 58% of the femoral length anterior to the hip. Other similarities across all allosauroids include the structure of their hind limb and pelvis. The pelvis in particular is thought to be designed to reduce stress regardless of body size. In particular, the way the femur is inclined reduces the bending and torsion stress. Furthermore, like other animals with tails, allosauroids possess a caudofemoralis longus (CFL) muscle that allowed them to flex theirs. Larger allosauroids are found to have a lower CFL muscle-to-body-mass proportion that smaller allosauroids. In addition to body similarities, allosauroids are also united by certain skull features. Some of the defining ones include a smaller mandibular fenestra, a short quadrate bone, and a short connection between the braincase and the palate. Allosauroid skulls are about 2.5 to 3 times longer as they are tall. Their narrow skull along with their serrated teeth allow allosauroids to better slice flesh off of their prey. Allosauroid teeth are flat and have equally-sized denticles on both edges. The flat side of the tooth face the sides of the skull, while the edges align on the same plane as the skull.Infante, P., et al. Primera Evidencia de Dinosaurios Ter√≥podos En La Formaci√≥n Mirambel (Barremiense Inferior, Cret√°cico Inferior) En Castellote, Teruel ; First Evidence of Theropod Dinosaurs from the Mirambel Formation (Lower Barremian, Lower Cretaceous) from Castellote, Teruel. 2005. EBSCOhost, search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db;=edsbas&AN;=edsbas.591B2D7E&site;=eds- live&scope;=site. From analyzing the skull of different allosauroids, the volume of the cranial vault ranges between 95 milliliters in Sinraptor to 250 milliliters in Giganotosaurus.Paulina-Carabajal, Ariana & Currie, Philip. (2012). New information on the braincase and endocast of Sinraptor dongi (Theropoda: Allosauroidea): Ethmoidal region, endocranial anatomy and pneumaticity. Vertebrata PalAsiatica. 50. 85-101. Classification Allosauroidea skull comparison Cladogram of Allosauroidea after Eddy and Clarke (2011) The clade Allosauroidea was originally proposed by Phil Currie and Zhao (1993; p. 2079), and later used as an undefined stem-based taxon by Paul Sereno (1997). Sereno (1998; p. 64) was the first to provide a stem-based definition for the Allosauroidea, defining the clade as \\"All neotetanurans closer to Allosaurus than to Neornithes.\\" Kevin Padian (2007) used a node- based definition, defined the Allosauroidea as Allosaurus, Sinraptor, their most recent common ancestor, and all of its descendants. Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues (2004; p. 100) and Phil Currie and Ken Carpenter (2000), among others, have followed this node-based definition. Of the allosauroids, sinraptorids make up the most basal group. However, in some analyses (such as Currie & Carpenter, 2000), the placement of the carcharodontosaurids relative to the allosaurids and sinraptorids is uncertain, and therefore it is uncertain whether or not the carcharodontosaurids are allosauroids (Currie & Carpenter, 2000). The cladogram presented here is simplified after the 2012 analysis by Carrano, Benson and Sampson after the exclusion of three \\"wildcard\\" taxa Poekilopleuron, Xuanhanosaurus and Streptospondylus. In 2019, Rauhut and Pol described Asfaltovenator vialidadi, a basal allosauroid displaying a mosaic of primitive and derived features seen within Tetanurae. Their phylogenetic analysis found traditional Megalosauroidea to represent a basal grade of carnosaurs, paraphyletic with respect to Allosauroidea. Because the authors amended the definition of Allosauroidea to include all theropods that are closer to Allosaurus fragilis than to either Megalosaurus bucklandii or Neornithes, the Piatnitzkysauridae was found to fall within Allosauroidea. A cladogram displaying the relationships they recovered is shown below:  Paleobiology and behavior  Multiple severe injuries have been found on allosauroid remains, which implies that allosauroids were frequently in dangerous situations and supports the hypothesis of an active, predatory lifestyle. Despite the multitude of injuries, only a few of those injuries show signs of infection. For those injuries that did become infected, the infections were usually local to the site of the injury, implying that the allosauroid immune response was able to quickly stop any infection from spreading to the rest of the body. This type of immune response is similar to modern reptilian immune responses; reptiles secrete fibrin near infected areas and localize the infection before it can spread via the bloodstream. The injuries were also found to be mostly healed. This healing may indicate that allosauroids had an intermediate metabolic rate, similar to non-avian reptiles, which means they require fewer nutrients in order to survive. A lower nutrient requirement means allosauroids do not need to undertake frequent hunts, which lowers their risk of sustaining traumatic injuries. Although the remains of other large theropods like tyrannosaurids bear evidence of fighting within their species and with other predators, the remains of allosauroids do not bear much evidence of injuries from theropod combat. Most notably, despite a good fossil record, allosauroid skulls lack the distinctive face-biting wounds that are common in tyrannosaurid skulls, leaving open the question of if allosauroids engaged in interspecies and intraspecies fighting. Allosauroid remains are also often found in groups, which implies social behavior. While there are alternative explanations for the groupings, like predator traps or habitat reduction due to drought, the frequency of finding allosauroid remains in groups supports the social animal theory. As social animals, allosauroids would share the burden of hunting, allowing injured members of the pack to recover faster.  Paleobiogeography  The paleobiogeographical history of allosauroids closely follows the order that Pangaea separated into the modern continents. By the Middle Jurassic period, tetanurans had spread to every continent and diverged into the allosauroids and the coelurosaurs. Allosauroids first appeared in the Middle Jurassic period and were the first giant taxa (weighing more than 2 tons) in theropod history. Along with members of the superfamily Megalosauroidea, allosauroids were the apex predators that occupied the Middle Jurassic to the early Late Cretaceous periods. Allosauroids have been found in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, and Asia. Specifically, a world-wide dispersal of carcharodontosauroids likely happened in the Early Cretaceous. It has been hypothesized that the dispersal involved Italy's Apulia region (the ‚Äúheel‚Äù of the Italian peninsula), which was connected to Africa by a land bridge during the Early Cretaceous period; various dinosaur footprints found in Apulia support this theory. Allosauroids were present in both the northern and southern continents during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous, but they were later displaced by the tyrannosauroids in North America and Asia during the Late Cretaceous. This is likely due to regional extinction events, which, along with increased species isolation through the severing of land connections between the continents, differentiated many dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous.

Before the KSS program, the submarine fleet of the ROK Navy consisted of midget submarines, such as the Dolgorae class submarine and SX 756 Dolphin class submarine, which had limited capabilities for inshore operations. The KSS program sought to acquire submarines that can deter hostile submarines and surface ships; protect friendly naval bases and sea shores communications; carry out reconnaissance missions. Through the first phase, KSS-I, the ROK Navy acquired nine 1,200-ton Chang Bo-go class submarines (Ïû•Î≥¥Í≥† Í∏â).:ko:Ïû•Î≥¥Í≥†Í∏â Ïû†ÏàòÌï® For the second phase, KSS-II, the ROK Navy plans to acquire nine 1,800-ton Type 214 submarines equipped with Air- independent propulsion (AIP) the lead ship of her class, ROKS Sohn Won-il (SS 072) was launched at a shipyard of Hyundai Heavy Industries on June 9, 2006. The first batch of these submarines is one of three, the second batch will be one of 6 and a $16 million deal has been awarded to SAAB for the electronics that are going to be used for the vessels delivered in the second batch submarines. The third part of the program, KSS-III began in 2007. This class will have significant improvements when compared to its predecessors. A total of nine 3,000-ton KSS-III submarines are expected to be built in South Korea with indigenous technologies (i.e. not going under license as the previous KSS-I and KSS-II submarines). In May 2009, South Korea decided to delay by two years its KSS-III project, also known as Jangbogo III programme. The project is expected to cost around US$900 million per submarine. The first KSS-III ship will be ready for service by 2025. The previous plan was to have an operational unit ready by 2017. Due to the relatively heavy displacement of the ship (3000~3500 tons) and the fact that it will be built with local Korean technologies (sensitive technologies might be blocked from export) the production of the submarine was delayed. This new class of ship will have the Korean Vertical Launching System which will be able to carry up to 10 indigenous Chonryong submarine-launched cruise missiles. The first submarine in the Republic of Korea Navy to have this kind of capability. It will also have many other improvements compared to its predecessors. Reports indicate South Korea might even deploy SLBMs inside the vertical launchers. Development of SLBMs by Agency for Defense Development is expected to be completed by 2020. SLBMs will be a derivative of Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missiles. The first KSS-III heavy diesel-electric submarine construction was launched on 17 September 2018. The name of the first ship of KSS-III has been named Dosan An Chang-Ho, thus KSS-III is now named as Dosan An Chang-Ho-class Submarine. It is expected to undergo 2 years of sea trials and be handed over to the navy in 2020 or early 2021. It is expected that three batches, with three submarines in each batch, will be built by 2029.

He left school at the end of 1763 without having completed the examination, probably because of his father's death. His relative Christian Petersen, who was Governor of Oppland, took Christian into his house and gave him work in his office. In 1768, Petersen became Prefect of Bergen. Christian followed him there and seems to have been there through the end of 1771. Career Christian Colbj√∏rnsen became a key official in Denmark and Norway. He set clear traces in the work of the Danish peasant reforms 1786-88. He was a leading force behind much of the legislative work that Danish Chancellery initiated in 1790s. He has also been of great importance in shaping the Supreme Court's role in the Danish-Norwegian history in the early 19th century. From 1773, he served as lawyer and he was chamber attorney from 1780-1785. From August 1786, Colbj√∏rnsen was secretary of the Rural Commission (Landbokommisjonen), a Danish committee appointed by then-Crown Prince Frederik, Regent of Denmark. The purpose of the Commission was to develop proposals for improvements in agriculture and set up clear guidelines for the relationship between landlords and peasants farmers. In 1788 he was appointed president of work for the Chancellery and had great influence on Danish legislation. From 1804 until his death, Christian Colbj√∏rnsen served as Chief Justice for the Supreme Court (Da. H√∏jesteret, Nor. H√∏yesterett) located in the Danish-Norwegian capital, Copenhagen.

Further, the denominator of total articles published encourages journals to be overly selective in what they publish, and preferentially publish articles which will receive more attention and citations. Due to these factors, the journal's practice of publishing a broad cross-section of biochemistry articles has led it to suffer in impact factor, in 2006 ranking 260 of 6,164, while remaining a highly cited journal. When science journals were evaluated with a PageRank-based algorithm, however, the Journal of Biological Chemistry ranked first. Using the Eigenfactor metric, the Journal of Biological Chemistry ranked 5th among all ISI-indexed journals in 2010. The impact factor of the journal in 2019 was 4.238.

He is largely known for his tenure in the United States House of Representatives, serving as a Democrat from 1949-1973 from Colorado's Fourth District. Aspinall became known for his direction of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee, of which he was the chairman from 1959-1973\\\\. Aspinall focused the majority of his efforts on western land and water issues. His actions supporting resource development often drew the ire of the increasingly powerful environmental lobby in the 1960s. David Brower, a prominent executive director of the Sierra Club, said that the environmental movement had seen \\"dream after dream dashed on the stony continents of Wayne Aspinall.\\" The congressman returned the animosity, calling environmentalists \\"over-indulged zealots\\" and \\"aristocrats\\" to whom \\"balance means nothing.\\" This battle shaped Aspinall's congressional career. Biography Aspinall was born in Middleburg, Logan County, Ohio in 1896 and moved to Palisade, Colorado in 1904. He studied at the University of Denver until World War I, when he enlisted in the armed services (the Air Service of the Signal Corps). He returned to DU after his discharge and graduated in 1919. After several years of teaching around the state, he enrolled in law school in Denver and graduated in 1925. In 1930, he won a seat in the Colorado State House of Representatives, serving as Speaker in 1937 and 1938 before moving to the State Senate from 1939 to 1948. He served in World War II as a captain in Military Government during 1943 and 1944 as well. In 1948, he chose to run for national office, hoping for it to be a stepping stone to Colorado's governorship. However, he would stay in the U.S. House for 24 years. Living on Colorado's Western Slope defined Aspinall's political ideology. His family had traditionally voted Republican, but the party's in-fighting in 1912 between Theodore Roosevelt and William H. Taft disillusioned Aspinall. However, despite becoming a Democrat, his rural roots shaped a relatively conservative philosophy. He believed in limited federal involvement in western land and water issues; to him, localities could better decide the uses of their resources. \\"When I was young‚Ä¶I lived outside the little town of Palisade, and the townspeople always seemed to call the shots. Then I moved to Palisade, and the bigger town of Grand Junction always seemed to call the shots. Then I went to the state Legislature, and the Eastern Slope‚Ä¶seemed to call the shots. And in Congress, the big metropolitan areas seemed to hold all the marbles.\\" His service in the U.S. House ended in 1972 with his loss in the Fourth District Democratic primary. However, Aspinall remained active in politics. He voiced his opinions on the need for the United States to become self-reliant for its energy needs, pushing oil shale development until his death in 1983. Colorado history remembers Aspinall as one of the state's most influential politicians. Known as \\"The Chairman,\\" he led the Interior and Insular Affairs Committee during a period that defined future water and land policy in the United States. Colorado governor Richard Lamm, a Democrat who had several ideological differences with Aspinall, remarked that \\"[N]o one in our history has done more to win Colorado a place at the table in Washington.\\" He had a son, Owen Aspinall, who went on to become Governor of American Samoa. Colorado River Storage Act of 1956 Aspinall favored dams and water reclamation projects for several reasons: (1) the power they generated; (2) general recreational use; and (3) he felt the key to Western economic prosperity lay in obtaining permanent stored supply of water for economic purposes. In Aspinall's mind, Americans had many opportunities to enjoy scenic areas, so damming a few of them would not hurt the country. After his career, he boasted that he had brought over $1 billion worth of water projects to his district. According to his observers, he \\"never met a dam he didn't like.\\" The Colorado River Storage Project (CRSP) came before Congress in the early to mid-1950s. The bill, sponsored by Wayne Aspinall and several western allies, called for damming several areas in the Upper Basin of the Colorado River. It included the Echo Park Dam proposal, located within Dinosaur National Monument. This became a volatile issue between environmentalists and water project advocates. Located just below the Green and Yampa Rivers, the proposed high dam would have created a 43,000 acre (170 km2) lake, flooding the Green River Canyon for and the Yampa River Canyon for . However, because of increased environmental awareness around the country, the majority of the public opposed the project. In 1954 alone, the Department of the Interior received 20,000 pieces of mail about the plan, and one insider estimated the letters ran 80 to 1 in opposition of the project. In 1954 and 1955, environmentalists defeated the controversial aspects of the CRSP. In '55, Aspinall conceded that for the bill to pass, he needed to sacrifice the Echo Park plan. Several more compromises between the two sides gave way to the Colorado River Storage Act of 1956 (Public Law 485, in chapter 203), which called for the creation of other irrigation projects and several large dams, including the Glen Canyon Dam in Utah, which created Lake Powell. Other projects created from the CRSP included the Flaming Gorge, Navajo, and Curecanti reservoirs. For his compromise, Aspinall gained five other reclamation projects and three hydroelectric dams for the Fourth District. The bill passed the House 256‚Äì136 in March 1956 and then-President Dwight Eisenhower signed it into law soon thereafter. Frying Pan Arkansas Project of 1962 This plan, originally proposed in 1951, called for water diversion out of the Frying Pan and Roaring Fork Rivers on the Western Slope of Colorado to the Arkansas River, which flowed to a drier climate in the southeast part of the state. Because the Front Range (Boulder, Denver, Colorado Springs, and Pueblo) had a tremendous population advantage over the Western Slope, most of the state favored the project. Precedent for this maneuver had been set in 1937 with the Colorado-Big Thompson Project, which transferred Western Slope water to farmers in northeast Colorado. Because he wanted to focus the House's efforts on the CRSP in the mid-'50s, Aspinall tabled Fry-Ark until 1960. However, when the issue resurfaced, Aspinall's opinion created controversy in his own district. Many of his constituents disapproved of sending their water to the Front Range. Aspinall, however, pushed the plan through because he realized that as a strong proponent of public water development, it seemed contradictory for him to block reclamation projects that benefited others. The bill passed in August 1962 when Aspinall attained a plan calling for the construction of a reservoir on the Roaring Fork River near Aspen, which would compensate the Western Slope for its loss of water. Fry-Ark demonstrated Aspinall's resolve to proliferate the amount of publicly funded water projects throughout the West, pitting him against the wishes of the majority of his constituents in the early 1960s. He quickly regained favor with them, however, when its precedent eventually brought more dams and reclamation projects back to the Fourth District. Wilderness Act of 1964 One of the first comprehensive pieces of environmental legislation during the era faced a lengthy battle in Congress between Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and western politicians like Aspinall. When the Wilderness bill first came to the House in 1961, Aspinall employed various stall tactics to never allow the popular bill out of the Interior Committee. He continued this through 1962 and into '63, earning him the wrath of the country's environmentalists, preservationist politicians, and a large amount of the public. However, in November 1963 Aspinall made a deal with John F. Kennedy. Aspinall greatly desired a public land review commission (see below), while one of Kennedy's primary goals was the passage of the Wilderness Act. Aspinall agreed to release the bill in exchange for the administration's cooperation with the land commission. (Also, Kennedy's assassination on November 22, 1963 created an ethos in Washington that essentially made Kennedy a martyr. Lyndon Johnson took up and pushed through many of his legislative goals because of public empathy.) Before Aspinall let the Wilderness Act of 1964 pass, he dropped the original request of 55 million acres (220,000 km2) of protected wilderness to only 9.1 million acres (37,000 km2). He also inserted a clause, called the \\"1984 clause,\\" that allowed mining interests to still have access to many of these areas until December 31, 1983. Despite these concessions, the House passed it 373-1 and Lyndon Johnson signed it in September. The act also refused to turn over exclusive power to the executive branch, keeping some power in Congress for public land oversight. Ironically, the National Wildlife Federation named Aspinall their \\"Conservationist of the Year\\" in 1964 for his role in the eventual passage of the bill. Colorado River Basin Act of 1968 and the Central Arizona Project From 1966 to 1968, Aspinall took on the final significant water project battle of his congressional career. The purpose of the Colorado River Basin Project, according to supporters, was to build dams to generate revenue and energy for communities in the Lower Basin of the Colorado River without using much of the Upper Basin's river water. The primary focus of the project was the Central Arizona Project (CAP). CAP supporters, among other demands, wanted to build two dams, one that would flood Grand Canyon National Monument and part of Grand Canyon National Park (Bridge Canyon Dam), with the other on the edge of the Grand Canyon (Marble Canyon Dam). Aspinall originally supported this, claiming it would generate revenue for all Colorado River Basin states. In turn, however, he demanded that his district receive five reclamation projects for his support. Several congressmen, including Arizona senator Carl Hayden, saw this as action as a move that held the state hostage, and many would come to resent Aspinall for it. Environmentalists vehemently opposed the CAP because of its detriment to the scenery of the Grand Canyon. Aspinall would later say \\"We viewed the development of the river as the only reasonable, practicable, safe, and logical way for millions of Americans and visitors to enjoy the canyon bottom which to date so few have had an opportunity to visit or view.\\" However, during the debate, the Sierra Club mocked that philosophy, purchasing an ad in national newspapers in July 1966. \\"Should we also flood the Sistine Chapel so tourists can get nearer the ceiling?\\" it asked. Sensing that he couldn't break the stalemate, Aspinall dropped the Grand Canyon dams from the CRPB in late August 1967. The bill eventually passed in the middle of 1968, creating the Colorado River Basin Act. However, in exchange for this compromise, Aspinall did receive five projects for Colorado (the Dallas Creek, Animas-La Plata, West Divide, San Miguel, and Dolores projects). Of those five, only two were eventually built (Dolores and Dallas Creek). The Animas-La Plata project is currently under construction, and is one of the last major water projects in the West. Jimmy Carter declared a \\"Hit List\\" in 1977 on what he felt was wasteful spending on \\"pork barrel\\" water projects, eliminating the other three (among others). Furthermore, no new major reclamation projects were approved during the rest of the era, partly because Aspinall's heavy- handed demands that constrained the legislation broke apart the western coalition of politicians that supported the construction of water projects. Public Land Law Review Commission Kennedy's concession in 1963 to enact the Wilderness Act gave Aspinall the go-ahead to organize his pet project, the Public Land Law Review Commission (PLLRC) in 1965. The PLLRC reviewed all federal regulations affecting the control and uses of the nation's public lands and recommended changes that would help the federal government manage these areas more efficiently. Aspinall served as the commission's chair for the entirety of its existence, from 1965 until 1970. The final report came out on June 23, 1970. Titled \\"One Third of the Nation's Lands,\\" it gave 137 recommendations to Richard Nixon and Congress. Among its suggestions: * States should have a greater say in how public lands are managed * Congress should have greater say in the uses of public land because the executive branch exerted too much singular influence * All public-land issues should be concentrated under a new Department of Natural Resources, with committees in the House and Senate * The Secretary of the Interior's power to withdraw public lands from development without Congressional approval should be limited * Regional mining, timber, and grazing needs should be supported to increase economic growth in local communities * The federal government should help stimulate the oil shale industry Environmentalists blasted its findings. The Sierra Club accused the study of being \\"oriented toward maximum immediate commercial exploitation...\\" predicated upon a world with an \\"ever-expanding economy and unlimited resources.\\" Others stated that the report only considered studies and opinions favorable to Aspinall's political ideology. Many citizens were also still unhappy with Aspinall for blocking the creation of the Redwood National Park in California for half of the decade until its passage in 1968, and they saw this as more evidence that he served as a mouthpiece for the extractive industries' interests in Congress. Aspinall proposed HR 9211 in his final session in Congress to implement many of the PLLRC's recommendations, but it failed to pass. During the height of the environmental movement, many of these suggestions were unacceptable to the public. However, later bills spawned from the ideas in the PLLRC, such as the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. 1970 and 1972 Democratic primaries After over two decades in office, the turbulent forces of the 1960s and early '70s caught up with Aspinall. With liberalism gaining strength throughout the country by protesting the Vietnam War and advocating civil rights for African Americans and equal rights for women, reformers gained control of the Democratic Party. They jumped on the opportunity to remove one of the party's most conservative members. In 1970 a young Democrat named Richard Perchlik challenged Aspinall in the Fourth District Democratic primary. Although Aspinall won by over 11,000 votes in his first primary challenge since 1948, Perchlik's campaign portrayed Aspinall as old (74 at the time) and out of touch with the ideals of liberals on the war and the environment. The challenger also accused \\"The Chairman\\" of being too connected to the extractive special interests and railed against him for his role in what reformers viewed as a flawed seniority system in Congress. Aspinall's friend and colleague, Democratic congressman Byron Rogers of Colorado's First District, did not survive 1970's primary season, however. A young liberal lawyer from Denver, Craig Barnes, defeated Rogers (although Barnes himself lost the general election). Rogers had a similar philosophy and legislative record to Aspinall, seemingly foreshadowing Aspinall's fate in 1972. The degree to which Aspinall appreciated the challenge of liberal Democrats is debated. He did say that \\"this drive toward liberalism, organization of committees, etc., is causing me to wonder if I haven't reached the place where I should let some younger and more militant person take over.\\" However, he never altered his campaign message in 1972, even after the Republican- controlled Colorado General Assembly redrew the state's district lines to include largely liberal precincts in the Fourth District. \\"Wayne Aspinall represents all the interests because all the people have interest in our resources,\\" his campaign said, continuing to target the miners, ranchers, and loggers that lived on the Western Slope. He never attempted to alter his message to assuage the concerns of his new liberal constituents. His opponent in the 1972 Democratic primary, Alan Merson, employed the same strategy that Perchlik and Barnes used two years previously. Merson attacked Aspinall for being slow to recognize developing energy problems, promoting policies that fed constant growth, building needless water projects, and being a tool of special interests. Merson received extensive external aid, accepting endorsements from The New York Times, Field and Stream, and even Reader's Digest. The environmental lobby provided most of the support to Merson's campaign, with $20,000 coming from the League of Conservation Voters. Environmental Action, having named Aspinall to their 1972 \\"Dirty Dozen\\" list of biggest congressional enemies to the environment, also endorsed Merson. Using the young, liberal vote on the Front Range, Merson defeated Aspinall in the primary 53% to 47%. History credits Aspinall's loss to his age, the strength of the environmental issue in 1972, and the redistricting that cost \\"The Chairman\\" much of his conservative support on the Western Slope. However, redistricting still favored Republicans, despite the liberal Merson's victory. Moving urban voters into the Fourth split the Democratic vote and consolidated Republican strength. Merson lost to James Paul Johnson, who had been Aspinall's unsuccessful Republican opponent in 1966, in the general election in November 1972. Post-Congressional life Aspinall stayed relatively active after leaving office in January 1973. He crossed party lines and endorsed Gerald Ford for president in 1976. He also pressed for further exploration of oil shale in the late 1970s, serving on the board of directors for the Paraho Oil Shale Demonstration, Inc., hoping to lead the country to an alternative energy source to end American reliance on oil during the energy crisis caused by the Arab Oil Embargo. He proudly took part in the Sagebrush Rebellion, a western philosophy popular from 1979-1982 that attempted to reclaim some federally protected land for determination by states and local governments. Aspinall resumed the practice of law, was a resident of Palisade, Colo., until his death there October 9, 1983; he was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Orchard Mesa Municipal Cemetery, Grand Junction, Colorado. The United States Post Office and Courthouse in Grand Junction was renamed the Wayne N. Aspinall Federal Building in 1972. References * Aspinall, Wayne N.

A closely related species, Badumna longinqua, the grey house spider, has a similar distribution, but has also been introduced to the Americas. Ludwig Carl Christian Koch described Badumna insignis in 1872. Description B. insignis is a dark, robust spider. The female grows up to 18 mm, with a 30 mm legspan. As with most spiders, the males are smaller (10 mm), and have longer legs in relation to their body size. In both sexes the carapace and legs are dark brown to black, and the abdomen is charcoal grey with a dorsal pattern of light markings (sometimes indistinct) and a dense covering of fine, velvety hair. B. longinqua is slightly smaller (14 mm) with a greyish carapace and red-brown legs. Habits, mating and reproduction Black house spider in its web The web of B. insignis is a messy-looking construct of irregular sail-like shapes. There is a funnel-shaped, silken retreat, usually in the middle or corner of the web, where the spider spends most of its time waiting for prey. The female spider never leaves the web unless forced to. They seem quite attached to their location, rarely changing the position of their webs and because of this, old webs can be quite messy, often with small objects or dust stuck in them. At night the spider comes out to repair and add to the web, often just adding new silk over the old. Males, when ready to mate, go in search of females. The male plucks the web of the female to attract her attention. Once the male has made sure that the female will be receptive, he will approach and inseminate her with his palps. They may then stay together for several days, and may mate again several times. The female constructs several white silk egg sacs, which are secured within the web retreat. The female stays with the eggs until they hatch. The spiderlings then disperse. Occasionally the young spiders stay in the web of the mother for some time, catching the smaller prey that the larger spider would ignore. Predators include the white-tailed spider, as well as parasitic wasps and flies. Bite Black house spiders are venomous, but are not considered dangerous. They are timid and bites from them are infrequent. The bite may be excruciatingly painful and cause local swelling. Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, sweating and giddiness are occasionally recorded. In a few cases, skin lesions (arachnogenic necrosis) have developed after multiple bites. Distribution and habitat B. insignis is native to Australia, but has been introduced to New Zealand and Japan. It is widely distributed throughout Australia and New Zealand. In natural habitat, they are usually found on rough-barked trees, whereas inside buildings they are often found in corners, around windows and doorways, or where other light sources may attract prey insects. The related B. longinqua may be found in similar locations, but is more often found outdoors. References Preston-Mafham, Ken (1998). Spiders: Compact Study Guide and Identifier. Angus Books. .

History Thomas More Prep Marian traces its roots back to 1908 when Hays Catholic College was founded by the Capuchin Franciscans to educate local boys. It was renamed St. Joseph's College in 1931 after moving into a new school building. The following year, it began offering the ROTC program. In 1952 the junior college program was dropped and it became solely a high school. The school name became St. Joseph's Military Academy to reflect this change. The Girls' Catholic High School was founded in 1918 by the Sisters of St. Agnes and was subsequently renamed Marian High School in 1961. St. Francis Seminary was founded in 1948 in Victoria, a town approximately 10 miles outside of Hays. It incorporated a high school program to prepare young men for the priesthood. Marian High, St. Francis Seminary, and St. Joseph's Military Academy all consolidated into Thomas More Prep- Marian between 1970 and 1981. In 2003, the Diocese took over governance of the school.

Early life Martineau was born in Merton to parents David Martineau (a retired judge) and Liz Allom. Her older brother, Luke, is an artist and painter. Her uncle is record producer Tom Allom, who has worked on albums for Judas Priest and Def Leppard. Martineau played both the piano and the flute as a child, developing a passion for song-writing and performing after taking singing lessons. Martineau was born with cystic fibrosis, a genetic disorder that causes chronic lung and digestive problems. During her early childhood, she had to go on a special high-fat diet, take antibiotics, and undergo physiotherapy. In 1993, she attended the University of Warwick to study English, but was forced to drop out two weeks later after developing a lung infection. She later switched to King's College London, where she graduated with a first-class honours degree in English. After graduation, Martineau began working as a model. Fearing that her condition would lower her chances of getting a deal, Martineau would hide her condition by arriving at the modelling agencies early and leaving late so that she wouldn't appear \\"breathless\\". Because she had a co-ordination problem when walking (due to a vitamin deficency), she wore shoes at the interviews. She was eventually signed to work for an agency that specialises in models with \\"unusual features\\". Because she was only tall, Martineau did not model on catwalks. Instead, she did photo sessions and appeared in teen magazines such as Just 17 and Jackie. Before commencing a career as a singer-songwriter in her mid- twenties, Martineau appeared as an extra in various music videos, filmed adverts for MTV and appeared on television on Richard & Judy. Musical career Due to her belief that her condition would prevent her from singing, Martineau did not initially pursue her musical ambitions; however, following singing lessons, it became apparent that her constant coughing had actually strengthened her diaphragm. Despite her worsening health, she played live gigs regularly in London until 2001 and was offered record deals by several companies, only to have them withdrawn when executives discovered that she was seriously ill and on the waiting list for heart, lung and liver transplants. In 2002, Martineau wrote an article in The Daily Telegraph's Saturday magazine about her wait for a life-saving triple transplant. The next day, her manager approached Sony Music with a demo tape and she was signed to their label in late 2002. Martineau completed this debut album quickly, as most songs had already been written over the previous three years. Her debut single, \\"If I Fall\\", was released on 11 November 2002. The music video was filmed in Wraysbury. The album Daydreams was released a week later on 18 November. Tracks on the album were produced by a number of people, including Marius De Vries. A promotional preview CD containing one track from her album and four short previews was also circulated. Sony had planned to release a second single, \\"The Right Time\\" on 10 February 2003 but decided to cancel the release due to Martineau's poor health. Personal life Martineau remained on the waiting list for a triple heart, lung and liver transplant for more than a year and a half before dying at home on the morning of 6 March 2003. A documentary, The Nine Lives of Alice Martineau, was made by the BBC Television several months before her death and broadcast shortly after her death. On 9 February 2017, A Song for Tomorrow by Alice Peterson was published by Simon & Schuster. The novel was inspired by Martineau's life story and follows the journey of Alice, a woman with cystic fibrosis.

It is classified as a Category I pest by the Florida Exotic Pest Plant Council, meaning that it is interfering with the local plant ecosystem by out- competing native plants and thereby eliminating them, as well as hybridizing with them.\\"2011 Invasive Plant Species List\\" , \\"Florida EPPC's 2011 Invasive Plant Species List\\", 2011. Retrieved on 29 November 2012. Christmas berry is viewed as an environmental weed in Australia, particularly in its rainforests. It has become naturalized in north-eastern New South Wales. It has also been naturalized in two islands of Hawaii. Ecological Effect The dense foliage of Christmas berry shades out native seedlings of the understory by decreasing the amount of light reaching the forest floor by as much as 70%. Its prolific berry yield furthers its ability to form monocultures, as other natives are unable to compete reproductively with the yearlong persistence of berries. These monocultures can reach numbers of over 100 plants per square meter.Kitajima, Kaoru. Fox, Alison. Sato, Tomatsu. Nagamatsu, Dai. \\"Cultivar selection prior to introduction may increase invasiveness: evidence from Ardisia crenata\\", \\"Biological Invasions\\", 2006. Retrieved on 23 November 2012. When the mature plants from these stands are removed, juvenile seedlings will take over the space they leave behind. The diversity of native plant species in the presence of this invasive is greatly diminished through lowered germination rates in the face of the thick cover of Christmas berry. Control =Biological= There has not been a biological control designated for Christmas berry. =Chemical= A 3% solution of glyphosate or triclopyr ester, or 4% triclopyr amine, has been shown effective in management of Christmas berry. However, the effect of glyphosate is non-specific, so the effects of the spray on the environment must be monitored. 2,4-D weakness is also exhibited, with even greater susceptibility during seedling or regrowth stages than during maturity. Triclopyr herbicide is most effective at maturity. \\"Coral ardisia\\", \\"Center for Aquatic and Invasive Plants\\", Retrieved on 24 November 2012. A basal bark application of 18% v/v solution of Remedy or Garlon 4 is an effective suppressant. =Cultural= Thriving ground cover prior to invasion will help slow down seedling colonization. =Mechanical= Mechanical control of Christmas berry is a challenge. Useful methods include hand-pulling in the case of small-scale invasions. This is not a very efficient method due to the difficulty of eliminating all the surrounding berries littering the ground that will soon replace the removed material. Another option is discing, which tills the soil up in hopes of destroying the rhizomes. This must be carefully administered to prevent harm of the surrounding local flora and ensuring that the rhizomes are subdued. Cutting as well as burning prove to be ineffective due to the strongly rhizomatous nature of the plant. If a mechanical method is used to control the plant, the site must be regularly monitored for at least a year in order to ensure elimination of Christmas berry. Medical uses The leaves of Ardisia crenata are being investigated as a remedy to stop asthmatic contractions and spasms. The plant contains a medicinal substance known as FR900359 that could treat several diseases, including asthma, hypertension, and uveal melanoma.

It is thought that these are young stars which will later become regular, non- variable stars on the zero-age main sequence. Brightness fluctuations can be as much as several magnitudes. T Tauri star T Tauri stars are Orion variables exhibiting characteristic fluorescent violet emission lines from singly ionized Iron (FeII) in their star spectra, and also emission from Lithium, a metal that usually is destroyed by the nuclear fusion in the stars. FU Orionis FU Orionis stars or simply \\"Fuors\\", are Orion variables that rise 5‚Äì6 magnitudes, then sink up to one magnitude and stay there for many decades. The prototype is FU Orionis, and other specimens are V1057 Cygni and V1515 Cygni. Variability Of this diverse class of stars, some Orion variables may exhibit a small amplitude (up to 1 magnitude) periodic variation, some are characterized by abrupt fadings, and some show spectral characteristics indicating mass downfall upon the star (YY Orionis stars). Many of these characteristics may occur in any one Orion variable. The term 'Orion Variable' was a handy catch-all term but is now tending to drop out of disuse among the astronomical community, though for historical reasons the GCVS still uses it. Astronomers use more specialised terms which refer to actual physical differences among the 'zoo' of young variable stars, such as 'Classical T Tauri' or 'UX Orionis' stars.

He served as Bishop of Salt Lake City (1932‚Äì1937) and Bishop of Rochester (1937‚Äì1966). Biography James Kearney was born in Red Oak, Iowa, the second of the three sons of William Patrick and Rosina (n√©e O'Doherty) Kearney. His parents were Irish immigrants who were originally from County Donegal. In 1886, at age 2, he moved with his family to New York City, where his father worked in retail furniture sales. He received his early education at Public School No. 27 since there was no parochial school at his home parish, St. Agnes Church. Kearney graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School in 1901, and then attended the Teachers College of Columbia University, where he earned a Regents license to teach in New York State. In 1903, he began his studies for the priesthood at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. He was designated in 1908 to complete his theological studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Priesthood In anticipation of his assignment to the Catholic University, his priestly ordination took place a year ahead of his class. Kearney was ordained by Bishop Thomas Cusack on September 19, 1908. He earned a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Catholic University in 1909. Following his return to New York City, he was assigned as a curate at St. Cecilia's Church, where he remained until 1928. In addition to his pastoral duties, he taught at Cathedral College. Kearney served as the first pastor of St. Francis Xavier's Church from 1928 to 1932 and founded the parish school there in 1929. During his tenure at St. Francis Xavier, he also served as professor of religion at Good Counsel College in White Plains and as superintendent of parochial schools in the Bronx. Episcopacy =Salt Lake City= On July 1, 1932, Kearney was appointed the fourth Bishop of Salt Lake City in Utah by Pope Pius XI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 28 from Cardinal Patrick Joseph Hayes, with Bishops John Joseph Mitty and John Joseph Dunn serving as co-consecrators, at St. Patrick's Cathedral. His installation took place at the Cathedral of the Madeleine on November 24 of that year. In 1936, Kearney spoke before the Knights of Columbus, urging them to fight communism and saying, \\"The spirit of Christ has been driven out of one organization after another...When statesmen meet no thought of God or representative of God is in their council.\\" =Rochester= Following the promotion of Bishop Edward Mooney to the Archdiocese of Detroit, Kearney was appointed the fifth Bishop of Rochester in New York on October 21, 1937. He was installed on November 11 of that year. During his 29-year tenure, he increased the number of Catholics in the diocese from 223,657 to 361,790; parishes from 129 to 155; priests from 289 to 371; and parochial schools from 72 to 99. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council between 1962 and 1965. He also served as state chaplain to the Knights of Columbus and moderator of the Newman Club Federation. During World War II, Kearney declared, \\"The spirit of Christianity can dictate a lasting peace, but secularism, exploitation or totalitarianism cannot, whether of Nazi, Communist or Fascist variety.\\" He condemned the \\"mad craze for entertainment\\" in modern society, including picture magazines, saying man had brought evil upon himself because he did not \\"pause to take stock of his relationship with God.\\" In 1947, he denounced the film Forever Amber as a \\"glorification of immorality and licentiousness,\\" and encouraged Catholics to boycott the film. He accused colleges of teaching their students \\"cynical precepts\\" and causing them to distrust the \\"perfect lessons they learned at their mother's knee.\\" He also said, \\"Those who declare it doesn't make any difference what we believe in an attempt to attain religious harmony will fail. For religious intolerance was created...by people who sold dogmatic teaching short.\\" Later life and death On October 21, 1966, Kearney retired as Bishop of Rochester; he was appointed Titular Bishop of Tabaicara by Pope Paul VI on the same date. He resigned his titular see on January 18, 1971. He later died at St. Ann's Home in Rochester, at age 92. Legacy The following buildings or schools are named after Bishop Kearney: *Bishop Kearney High School (Irondequoit, New York), near Rochester *Kearney Residence Hall, located on the campus of Nazareth College In addition, Kearney Hall, located on the campus of Saint John Fisher College, is named for his mother.

Submergence of this unique landform assemblage and geoheritage feature beneath 15 m of water was one of many triggers to formulation of geoconservation philosophy. Geodiversity is the variety of earth materials, forms and processes that constitute and shape the Earth, either the whole or a specific part of it.Zwolinski, Zb. 2004. Geodiversity, in: Encyclopedia of Geomorphology, A.Goudie (ed.), Routledge: pp. 417-418. Relevant materials include minerals, rocks, sediments, fossils, soils and water. Forms may comprise folds, faults, landforms and other expressions of morphology or relations between units of earth material. Any natural process that continues to act upon, maintain or modify either material or form (for example tectonics, sediment transport, pedogenesis) represents another aspect of geodiversity. However geodiversity is not normally defined to include the likes of landscaping, concrete or other significant human influence.Gray, M. 2004. Geodiversity: Valuing and Conserving Abiotic Nature. John Wiley & Sons Ltd  Overview  Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of Great Britain and Tasmania) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology. With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a geoethical approach.Peppoloni S. and Di Capua G. (2012), \\"Geoethics and geological culture: awareness, responsibility and challenges\\". Annals of Geophysics, 55, 3, 335-341. . According to Ponciano et alPonciano L.C.M.O. et al.

These authors also consider any extremely valuable reference to these geodiversity elements as ex situ geoheritage, including therefore field notebooks, papers, photographs, maps, dissertations, books, etc. These references often bear historical and scientific value as, for instance, paleontologist Kenneth Caster's field notebooks which provided informations on unknown fossil localities Lima J.D.C. and Ponciano L.C.M.O. (2017), Importance of Kenneth Edward Caster (1908‚Äì1992) Personal Correspondence and Field Notebooks to the Brazilian Paleontological Heritage.\\" Geoheritage 10:179-190 .). Later (2016), Jos√© Brilha argues geodiversity may be of scientific value or valued for other aspects. Geodiversity of scientific value can be either geosites or geoheritage elements that are ex situ (not encompassing references to these elements such as dissertations, letters and field notebooks as geoheritage). Similarly geodiversity that is of little or no scientific value may be categorized as sites of geodiversity or geodiversity elements that are ex situ. Geodiversity also constitutes an important part of developing nature-based solutions to global environmental challenges and demands for natural resources. For example, a recent study argued that the acute lack of considering geodiversity in international conventions and monitoring frameworks poses a threat to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.Schrodt, F. et al.

Dolan referred to his LOR study concept as Manned Lunar Landing and Return (MALLAR), and it was largely ignored by NASA administrators until Langley engineer John Houbolt began championing the concept in 1961. The proposed idea outlined a smaller spacecraft dedicated only to operate in the vacuum of space. This spacecraft could act as sort of a shuttle between an orbiting \\"command module\\" in Lunar orbit and the surface of the Moon. Following this mission profile required the Command/Service Module and Lunar Module to fly all the way to the moon together and undock while in orbit around the moon, at which point the Lunar Module would land on the moon. In order to return, it would lift off again into lunar orbit and perform an orbital rendezvous with the Command/Service Module. The lander's ascent stage would be left behind in orbit, and the crew would return home using the Command/Service Module. This method saved a lot of weight in propellant and spacecraft mass, but did not gain widespread acceptance early on. The risks associated with Lunar orbit rendezvous were initially considered unacceptable by NASA officials. The Gemini missions would later prove that rendezvous and docking was indeed possible in space, paving the way for Dolan's idea to be put into practice.

The western terminus of the route is at an intersection with NY 33A in Chili and the eastern terminus is at a junction with NY 64 and NY 96 in the village of Pittsford. NY 252 passes through the center of the town of Henrietta's commercial district, where it intersects NY 15\\\\. The route passes through three distinct areas: a lightly populated, rural area of Chili west of the Genesee River, the heavily developed commercial district centered on NY 252's intersections with NY 15 and NY 15A, and a mostly residential area of the town of Pittsford. When NY 252 was assigned in the early 1930s, it extended from Scottsville Road (NY 383) in Chili to the village of Pittsford. NY 252 was extended northwest to Chili Center in 1949 by way of modern NY 252A, and east to Bushnell's Basin in November 1955 after NY 96 was realigned onto part of the Eastern Expressway. The route was shifted southward onto its present alignment through Chili in the late 1950s and cut back to Pittsford . The segment of NY 252 west of NY 383 was initially county-maintained; however, ownership and maintenance of it were transferred to the state of New York in 2007. Route description NY 252 at its interchange with NY 15 in Henrietta NY 252 begins at an intersection with NY 33A in the Monroe County town of Chili. The route heads eastward, following Beaver Road through a sparsely populated area of Chili. About from NY 33A, NY 252 intersects NY 386\\\\. The highway continues onward, partially paralleling Black Creek eastward to an intersection with Archer Road. Here, Beaver Road comes to an end while NY 252 adopts the Archer Road name and heads southeastward, crossing over Black Creek as it approaches Ballantyne Road. At Ballantyne Road, Archer Road terminates and NY 252 changes names once more to Ballantyne Road. As Ballantyne Road, the route progresses northeastward, paralleling Black Creek as it crosses the Rochester and Southern Railroad. Roughly past the railroad crossing, the road curves to the southeast, entering a residential area as it approaches the Genesee River and NY 383 (Scottsville Road), which runs along the river's western bank. At NY 383, NY 252 becomes Jefferson Road, a name that follows NY 252 eastward to its terminus in the village of Pittsford. NY 252 traverses the river and enters the town of Henrietta by way of the Ballantyne Bridge. On the opposite bank of the river, NY 252 intersects East River Road, Scottsville Road's counterpart on the eastern river bank. NY 252 east from Pittsford Just east of the river, the route passes north of the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology, one of largest colleges in the Rochester area. NY 252 connects to the college by way of Lomb Memorial Drive and Lowenthal Road before proceeding eastward into an area of Henrietta dominated by commercial establishments. From Brighton‚ÄìHenrietta Town Line Road east to South Winton Road, NY 252 is at least four lanes wide and is lined with plazas, stores, and shopping centers. The approximate center of Henrietta's commercial district is situated near the modified diamond interchange that links NY 252 to NY 15\\\\. The Marketplace Mall and South Town Plaza, the two largest shopping centers in the area, are both located in the vicinity of this intersection. NY 252 intersects NY 15A and meets Interstate 390 (I-390) at an interchange prior to intersecting Winton Road. East of Winton Road, NY 252 narrows to two lanes and enters a highly residential neighborhood. At the Henrietta‚ÄìPittsford town line, the route passes the Locust Hill Country Club. Past Locust Hill, NY 252 continues past a series of residential neighborhoods to an intersection with NY 65\\\\. East of NY 65, NY 252 becomes West Jefferson Road and briefly enters an area of open, cultivated fields before entering the village of Pittsford. The route heads east for four blocks as a residential street, passing Pittsford Sutherland High School before ending at an intersection with South Main Street (NY 64 and NY 96). History =Designation and maintenance= NY 252 was assigned in the early 1930s to the portion of its modern alignment east of Scottsville Road (current NY 383) in Chili. It was extended northwest to NY 33A and then-NY 251 (now NY 386) in the hamlet of Chili Center via Scottsville and Paul roads on January 1, 1949, replacing NY 198. In November 1955, NY 96 was realigned onto the new Eastern Expressway from Bushnell's Basin to East Rochester. Its former surface routing between the village of Pittsford and Bushnell's Basin became part of an extended NY 252. The west end of NY 252 was altered in the late 1950s to follow Ballantyne, Archer, and Beaver Roads between NY 33A and NY 383, while the east end was truncated back to Pittsford when the Eastern Expressway was redesignated as I-490. The former routing of NY 252 along Paul Road was redesignated as NY 252A. Sometime between 1935 and 1952, Pittsford's and Henrietta's \\"Jefferson Avenue\\" (which served as the final stretch of 252) was changed from curving to the intersection with Brighton-Henrietta Townline & Winton Roads after terminating Pinnacle Road, to going an alternate route to end at John Street & Brighton- Henrietta Townline Road near RIT. Until the extension of Jefferson Avenue, 252 had followed Jefferson Avenue and Brighton-Henrietta Townline Road in their entireties. Between 1952 and 1971, Route 15 became transferred from the United States to the NYSDOT. At this time, a new and wider road was built called \\"Jefferson Road\\" over land around the existing Brighton-Henrietta Townline Road and Jefferson Avenue in order to directly connect Chili's Ballantyne Road directly to Marketplace Mall. A redesign of the intersection was Route 15 was built, making Route 15 an \\"exit\\" off of 252 or a way to do a U-turn on the growing road to the plazas around the Route 15 corridor. Since 1971, NY 252 follows this \\"Jefferson Road\\" alignment that was built to widen route between NY 383 and NY 15. Westbound on NY 252 just west of NY 383 in Chili. This section of the route was transferred to the state of New York in 2007. The portion of NY 252 west of NY 383 was originally maintained by Monroe County. This section was concurrent with three different county route designations, one for each of the three different road names along this stretch. The portion of NY 252 on Ballantyne Road was designated by Monroe County as County Route 125 (CR 125) while the Beaver Road segment was CR 127 and the Archer Road piece was CR 129. In 2007, ownership and maintenance of NY 252 west of NY 383 was transferred from Monroe County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. A bill (S4856, 2007) to enact the swap was introduced in the New York State Senate on April 23 and passed by both the Senate and the New York State Assembly on June 20\\\\. The act was signed into law by Governor Eliot Spitzer on August 28\\\\. Under the terms of the act, it took effect 90 days after it was signed into law; thus, the maintenance swap officially took place on November 26, 2007. The entirety of NY 252 is now maintained by the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT). =Widening projects= In August 2008, construction began on a $5.5 million project to improve the intersection between Clover Street (NY 65) and Jefferson Road (NY 252) in the town of Pittsford. The project, which had been in development for a decade, involved the widening of Jefferson Road from two to four lanes in the vicinity of the intersection, the addition of green arrow signal lights for all left-hand turns, and the installation of sidewalks alongside both Clover Street and Jefferson Road. Work on the project was temporarily halted during the winter months; however, it resumed on April 1, 2009. The project was completed in late 2009. The portion of NY 252 in Henrietta between Marketplace Drive and Ridgeland Road was widened from four to six lanes as part of a multi-year, $15.6 million project that began in mid-2009. Phase one of the five-phase project, completed during the second half of 2009, involved the relocation of utility poles and water mains. The next four phases involved the actual widening of the highway. During phase two, all traffic on Jefferson Road was routed along the eastbound lanes while the westbound half of the road was reconstructed and widened; this was reversed during phase three. A raised median between the two directions, which prohibited left-hand turns at all points except signalized intersections, was constructed during phase four, and phase five covered the finishing touches of the project. As part of the project, the intersection between Jefferson Road and East Henrietta Road (NY 15A) was widened to have two dedicated left-turn lanes in all four directions. Work on the last four phases began on March 29, 2010, and was expected to be fully completed in November 2011. Construction did get completed in November 2011, but at the cost of $16.5 million (2012 USD) instead of the original $15.6 million. NY 252A right NY 252A () was an alternate route of NY 252 along Paul Road in the town of Chili. It extended from the eastern terminus of the overlap between NY 33A and NY 386 in the hamlet of Chili Center to NY 383 in the vicinity of the Greater Rochester International Airport. Despite its designation, NY 252A never connected to NY 252. The route existed from the late 1950s to 2009. Its former alignment is now maintained by Monroe County as part of CR 168.

However, both the US Air Force and UFO skeptics have described the incident as being caused by either ball lightning or a severe electrical storm. Reports On the evening of November 2, 1957, two immigrant farm workers, Pedro Saucedo and Joe Salaz, called the Levelland police department to report a UFO sighting. Saucedo told police officer A.J. Fowler, who was working the night desk at the police station, that they had been driving four miles (6 km) west of Levelland when they saw a blue flash of light near the road. They claimed their truck's engine died, and a rocket- shaped object rose up and approached the truck. According to Saucedo, \\"I jumped out of the truck and hit the dirt because I was afraid. I called to Joe but he didn't get out. The thing passed directly over my truck with a great sound and rush of wind. It sounded like thunder and my truck rocked from the flash...I felt a lot of heat.\\" As the object moved away the truck's engine restarted and worked normally. Believing the story to be a joke, Fowler ignored it. An hour later, motorist Jim Wheeler reported a \\"brilliantly lit, egg-shaped object, about 200 feet long\\" was sitting in the road, four miles (6 km) east of Levelland, blocking his path. He claimed his vehicle died and as he got out of his car the object took off and its lights went out. As it moved away, Wheeler's car restarted and worked normally. At 10:55 pm a married couple driving northeast of Levelland reported that they saw a bright flash of light moving across the sky and their headlights and radio died for three seconds. Five minutes later Jose Alvarez claimed he met a strange object sitting on the road north of Levelland, and his vehicle's engine died until the object departed. At 12:05 am (November 3), a Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech University) student named Newell Wright was surprised when, driving east of Levelland, his \\"car engine began to sputter, the ammeter on the dash jumped to discharge and then back to normal, and the motor started cutting out like it was out of gas...the car rolled to a stop; then the headlights dimmed and several seconds later went out.\\" When he got out to check on the problem, he saw a \\"100-foot-long\\" egg-shaped object sitting in the road. It took off, and his engine started running again. At 12:15 am Officer Fowler received another call, this time from a farmer named Frank Williams who claimed he had encountered a brightly glowing object sitting in the road, and \\"as his car approached it, its lights went out and its motor stopped.\\" The object flew away, and his car's lights and motor started working again. Other callers were Ronald Martin at 12:45 am and James Long at 1:15 am, and they both reported seeing a brightly lit object sitting in the road in front of them, and they also claimed that their engines and headlights died until the object flew away. By this time, several Levelland police officers were investigating the reports. Among them was Sheriff Weir Clem, who saw a brilliant red object moving across the sky at 1:30 am. At 1:45 am Levelland's Fire Chief, Ray Jones, also saw an object and his vehicle's lights and engine sputtered. The reports apparently ended soon after. During the night of November 2‚Äì3, the Levelland police department received a total of 15 UFO- related reports, and Officer Fowler noted that \\"everybody who called was very excited.\\" U.S. Air Force investigation The Levelland sightings received national publicity, and were soon investigated by Project Blue Book. Started in 1947 as Project Sign, Project Blue Book was the official US Air Force research group assigned to investigate UFO reports. An Air Force sergeant was sent to Levelland, and spent seven hours in the city investigating the incident. After interviewing three of the eyewitnesses ‚Äì Saucedo, Wheeler, and Wright ‚Äì and after learning that thunderstorms were present in the area earlier in the day, the Air Force investigator concluded that a severe electrical storm ‚Äì most probably ball lightning or St. Elmo's fire ‚Äì was the major cause for the sightings and reported auto failures. According to UFO historian Curtis Peebles, \\"the Air Force found only three persons who had witnessed the 'blue light'...there was no uniform description of the object.\\" Additionally, Project Blue Book believed that \\"Saucedo's account could not be relied upon ‚Äì he had only a grade school education and had no concept of direction and was conflicting in his answers...in view of the stormy weather conditions, an electrical phenomenon such as ball lightning or St. Elmo's fire seemed to be the most probable cause.\\" The engine failures mentioned by the eyewitnesses were blamed on \\"wet electrical circuits.\\" Donald H. Menzel, an astronomer at Harvard University and a prominent UFO skeptic, agreed with the Air Force explanation: \\"members of civilian saucer groups complained that, since [the Air Force investigator] had spent only seven hours in the area, he had obviously not taken the problem seriously and could not have found the correct solution. Even seventy hours of labor, however, could not have produced a clearer picture...the evidence leads to an overwhelming probability: the fiery unknown at Levelland was ball lightning.\\" Menzel argued that \\"in Levelland on the night of November 2 conditions were ideal for the formation of ball lightning. For several days the area had been experiencing freak weather, and on the night in question had been visited by rain, thunderstorms and lightning.\\" Menzel admitted that \\"since ball lightning is short-lived and cannot be preserved as tangible evidence, its appearance on the night of November 2 can never be absolutely proved.\\" However, he also argued that \\"only the saucer proponents could have converted so trivial a series of events ‚Äì a few stalled automobiles, balls of flame in the sky at the end of the thunderstorm ‚Äì into a national mystery.\\" Ufologists Two ufologists ‚Äì James E. McDonald and J. Allen Hynek ‚Äì disputed the Air Force ball lightning/electrical storm explanation. Both men argued that there was no electrical storm in the area when the sightings occurred. In testimony before a committee of the US House of Representatives in 1968, McDonald said that \\"One famous [UFO] case was at Levelland, Texas...ten vehicles were stopped within a short area, all independently in a 2-hour period. There was no lightning or thunder storm, and only a trace of rain.\\"(http://files.ncas.org/ufosymposium/mcdonald.html) Hynek wrote that \\"as the person responsible for the tracking of the new Soviet satellite Sputnik, I was on a virtual around-the-clock duty and was unable to give it any attention whatever. I am not proud today that I hastily concurred in [the Air Force's] evaluation as 'ball lightning' on the basis of information that an electrical storm had been in progress in the Levelland area at the time. This was shown not to be the case. Observers reported overcast and mist but no lightning.\\" Hynek also noted that \\"had I given it any thought whatsoever, I would soon have recognized the absence of any evidence that ball lightning can stop cars and put out headlights.\\" Ufologists have also argued that the Air Force investigator did not interview nine of the fifteen witnesses, nor were they mentioned in Blue Book's final report on the incident. Media coverage In March 2002, Dallas-based television station KDFW aired a report about the Levelland UFO case in which reporter Richard Ray interviewed Sheriff Weir Clem's widow and friends.

He is best known for his work with Duke Reid's Treasure Isle Records, where his most notable song, \\"Carry Go Bring Come\\" recorded in late 1963, went to number one in Jamaica. He recorded seventy singles between 1964 and 1966, and was the most popular artist on the record label.[ AllMusic] Biography Hinds was born in Steertown, Saint Ann Parish, Jamaica in 1942. He started his musical career singing in bars and on the beach in Ochos Rios. Hinds moved to Kingston, Jamaica where he became influenced by Rastafari. He was turned down by Coxsone Dodd's label, but signed with Treasure Isle Records. By this stage, the Dominoes consisting of Dennis Sinclair and Junior Dixon had become his backing vocalists. =Work with Duke Reid= His first recording with Duke Reid was \\"Carry Go Bring Come\\", made in late 1963 in one take. It became a big hit topping the Jamaican chart for two months, just before the Wailers got their big hit with \\"Simmer Down\\". \\"Carry Go Bring Come\\" would later be covered by the British ska band The Selecter on their 1980 album Too Much Pressure, and by Desmond Dekker and The Specials on King of Kings. Hinds was one of the biggest acts in Jamaican music during the 1960s. Over the next couple of years, he would release singles including \\"King Samuel\\", \\"Jump Out of the Frying Pan\\", \\"The Ark\\" and \\"Rub Up Push Up\\". He also released \\"Carry Go Bring Come\\" in 1963 in conjunction with Jonathan Bevan, an English-born Jamaican national, a successful collaboration which drew much admiration amongst Jamaican music producers. The track was described by esteemed Ghanaian music aficionado Zahid Chohan as \\"simply wonderful; belongs in any reggae fan's collection\\". He also worked with Tommy McCook and The Supersonics. In 1966, he became active in rocksteady, a predecessor of reggae. He had several more hits in Jamaica including \\"The Higher the Monkey Climbs\\", \\"No Good Rudie\\", \\"On a Saturday Night\\", \\"Here I Stand\\" and \\"Save a Bread\\". Hinds parted company with Reid in 1972 as an artist, but was present when he died a few years later. Justin Hinds was a great example for his younger cousin, Horace Andy, who would become a reggae and trip-hop icon working with bands like Massive Attack. =Subsequent work= Hinds then worked with Jack Ruby which resulted in the 1976 album Jezebel.Moskowitz, David V. (2006) Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall, Greenwood Press, , p.139 Reviewing it in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: \\"Homey lyrics ('Jah-jah will spank you') and artful instrumental touches‚ÄîI like the gentle calypso-styled horns and decorative guitar licks‚Äîmay mean this is a great reggae album. But they may mean it's only a subtle one, and in such an understated genre subtlety risks extinction.\\" Hinds' work with Sonia Pottinger resulted in a series of singles released in the late 1970s, including \\"Rig-Ma-Roe Game\\" and \\"Wipe Your Weeping Eyes\\". After the release of Travel with Love recorded at Tuff Gong Studios in 1984, Hinds became less active. His final studio album Know Jah Better was released in 1992, but he worked on Wingless Angels with other Jamaican musicians, which was produced by Keith Richards in the early 1990s. In 1997, he toured the US for the first time and he would release a couple of live albums in the early 2000s, including one recorded at the Finger Lakes GrassRoots Festival of Music and Dance in Trumansburg, New York. On 23 September 2010 a new album will appear posthum, Wingless Angels II, with \\"Oh What a Joy, What a Comfort\\", guitar by Keith Richards (Rolling Stones, UK), with Lisa Fisher (also voices at \\"Gimme Shelter\\", \\"Paint it Black\\" and more on the Bridges to Babylon Tour 10 years ago) and Jamaican Nyabinghi Drummers =Death= Hinds died of lung cancer in March 2005, at the age of 62.

History  The first description of the Polish (Ogar) Hound is found in the book The beginnings of the natural history and farming of the national domestic and wild animals by Krzysztof Kluk (1779).FCI Polish hound According to historians, the Polish Hounds developed through crossbreeding of Bloodhounds (the St Hubert Hound), imported to Poland in the Middle Ages, with local hounds. Jan Szytier (1819) wrote about the \\"Polish Hound\\" and the \\"Polish Scent Hound\\" in his \\"Hunting Guide\\" (Poradnik My≈õliwych).Ria H√∂rter. \\"New Dog Breeds ‚Äì Recognized by The FCI. Go≈Ñczy Polski (Polish Hunting Dog)\\". The Canine Chronicle. October 2013. pp. 196-199. World War II resulted in the decline of the Polish Hounds' population. The attempts to revive the breed led to the emergence of two types: light-boned (bred by Colonel J√≥zef Paw≈Çusiewicz) and heavier-boned (bred by Colonel Piotr Kartawik). The latter one was recognized by the FCI as the \\"Ogar Polski\\" in 1966.  Description  upright=0.70 Polish Hounds reach 55‚Äì65 cm (22-23.5 inches) in height. Males weigh around 25 to 32 kg. (55-70.5 lb) while females weigh 20 to 26 kg (44-57.5 lb).  Characteristics and Temperament  Polish hounds in Russia with a wild boar carcass. The Polish Hound has an average life span of 13 to 14 years. A medium-sized breed, Ogar Polski is often described as strong and sleek, with a powerful bone structure. The coloration of these animals is often a combination of a brown underside and black on top running from the neck to the tail. The breed has thick double coat, which ensures water resistance on outer and underlying skin layers. The Polish Hound's voice is often described as resonant and pure which makes it an ideal hunting dog. The Polish Hound matures slowly. Intelligent and easily trained, Polish Hounds are known to be calm, affectionate animals and great pets. Friendly with other breeds and very loyal, these dogs are also very protective of their land. It is unclear as to whether this breed makes a good guard dog. Many argue that its territorial nature makes it defensive against intruders, while other state that its passive nature renders it harmless to new people. Resilient to environment due to their origin of use, the Polish Hound acclimates quickly to new settings.  References  =Bibliography= * \\"Polish Hound (Ogar Polski).\\" Elite-Pets. N.p., n.d.

Material culture In 1963 Gerd Koch, a German anthropologist, carried out research in the islands of Kiribati to record traditional practices, and in 1965 he published the Material Culture of the Gilbert Islands. His field work produced 70 films of traditional practices and material culture. The Ethnological Museum of Berlin also holds approximately photos and an extensive collection of audio tapes (including music-ethnological material) made by Koch.

Domestic violence is also common.Nuzhat Shahzadi, \\"The Story of Maria of Temwaiku Village, Kiribati\\", Unicef Pacific, 11/10/2013  Dueling  Kiribati has a history of contrived and ritualized duels. The armor was made of thickly woven sennit, a kind of coconut fiber. The duelists wore helmets made of blowfish remains. The helmets were resilient and, due to the structure of blowfish, covered with many points, which had the ability of damaging weapons. The weapons resembled broadswords with a serrated edge created with many shark teeth. The duels were performed mostly for the purpose of settling disputes and maintaining honor. The practicality of the duels is debatable. Due to the difficulty of moving in this armor, falling over and becoming unable to get back up was common enough that duel assistants were required.  Kiribati traditional martial arts  Early 20th century Micronesian armour from Kiribati. Kiribati has been known for its traditional martial arts which were kept within the secrets of several families for generations. The Kiribati arts of fighting as opposed to Asian martial arts are not often mentioned or even advertised to be known by the general public. Though, there may be some noticeable parallels in principle to that of Asian martial arts, they are merely really different. For instance, generally, there is no kicking as in Karate kicks or Kung Fu kicks, and speed is more important than power. A list of some of these traditional martial arts is as follows: Nabakai, Nakara, Ruabou, Tabiang, Taborara, Tebania, Temata-aua, Te Rawarawanimon, and Terotauea. The essence of Kiribati traditional martial arts is the magical power of the spirits of the ancestral warriors. All these martial arts skills share one thing in common. That is, they came from an ancestral spirit. \\"Nabakai\\" is a martial art from the island of Abaiang originated from the person named Nabakai. Nabakai was a member of the crab clan called \\"Tabukaokao\\". The three ancestral female spirits of this clan \\"Nei Tenaotarai\\", \\"Nei Temwanai\\" and \\"Nei Tereiatabuki\\" which usually believed to manifest themselves with a female crab came to him and taught him the fighting art. \\"Te Rawarawanimon\\" was believed to be originated from three women namely Mwangataba, Nei Wanre and Nei Karaoia who played different roles in the performance of magical rite related with the martial art, including their brother Teroa. The grave yard for Teroa is on the land named Terawarawanimon in the bush side and remains of the three sisters which are in the form of stone, cramp shell and made hole in the ground are in the village side of the same named land,Terawarawanimon. \\"Nabakai\\" and \\"Te Rawarawanimon\\" show similar resemblance of techniques except that \\"Nabakai\\" usually works with one hand and basically uses only one stance while \\"Te Rawarawanimon\\" works with two hands and has more than a dozen different stances. \\"Te Rawarawanimon\\" is a martial art from the island of North Tarawa. \\"Tabiang\\" is a martial art from the island of Abemama. It is called \\"Tabiang\\" because it belongs to every member of the village called Tabiang on Abemama island. It uses speed and accuracy to take over an opponent. The common formula used in this form of martial art is \\"you give me one punch I give you four punches\\". It was originated from an ancestral spirit called \\"Terengerenge\\" commonly known in other versions of oral traditions as \\"Teraka\\". He became manifested by a person called \\"Karotu-te-buai\\" from Abemama island and this was the birth of \\"Tabiang\\". According to oral traditions, this ancestral spirit traveled to Asia and was a source of origin for what is now known as \\"karate\\", a reverse written form of the name \\"Teraka\\". Oral traditions state that \\"Kaitu\\" and Uakeia\\" conquered the whole of the southern Gilbert islands and of the northern Gilberts. Mwea, the warrior from Nikunau, he conquered Abemama prior the arrival of Kaitu and Uakeia and that is why Kaitu and Uakeia were not very serious about Abemama. They came to confirm the ownership of Mwea, whom his siblings started the kingdom of Abemama, and claimed more prior leaving the island. This explains why the king there owns a lot of land. In fact, the name Tabiang originates from Beru such as Taboiaki and Aotukia in Nonouti. \\"Nakara\\" and \\"Ruabou\\" were originated from the island of Niutao in the Ellice Islands(now called Tuvalu). Oral traditions stated that \\"Nakara\\" and \\"Ruabou\\" were adopted from the styles of \\"Lupe\\" in Niutao who derived his martial arts from his ancestral spirit, through Tikitiki who gain came from Beru. The basics of \\"Nakara\\" and \\"Ruabou\\" work mainly on wrestling techniques. \\"Ruabou\\" applies more of wrestling and hand combat combination while \\"Nakara\\" mainly develops focus on wrestling techniques as a common saying in Kiribati states \\"when fighting a \\"Nakara\\" expert, never come in close contact with him.\\" The two forms of martial arts are practiced throughout the southern Gilbert islands but originally began on the islands of Tamana and Arorae. In 1963 Gerd Koch filmed self-defence techniques of kaunrabata (wrestling), rawebiti (defence of attacks with stabbing weapons) and rawekoro (armed attacks) on Nonouti and also filmed kaunrabata (wrestling defence), oro (defence of unarmed attacks) and rawekai (defence of armed attacks) on Onotoa. Music Kiribati folk music is generally based around chanting or other forms of vocalizing, accompanied by body percussion. Public performances in modern Kiribati are generally performed by a seated chorus, accompanied by a guitar. However, during formal performances of the standing dance (Te Kaimatoa) or the hip dance (Te Buki) a wooden box is used as a percussion instrument. This box is constructed so as to give a hollow and reverberating tone when struck simultaneously by a chorus of men sitting around it. Traditional songs are often love-themed, but there are also competitive, religious, children's, patriotic, war and wedding songs. There are also stick dances (which accompany legends and semi-historical stories. These stick dances or 'tirere' (pronounced seerere) are only performed during major festivals. Dance The uniqueness of Kiribati when compared with other forms of Pacific Island dance is its emphasis on the outstretched arms of the dancer and the sudden birdlike movement of the head. The Frigate bird (Fregata minor) on the Kiribati flag refers to this bird-like style of Kiribati dancing. Most dances are in the standing or sitting position with movement limited and staggered. Smiling whilst dancing as seen in the modern Hawaiian Hula is generally considered vulgar within the context of Kiribati dancing. This is due to its origin of not being solely as a form of entertainment but as a form of storytelling and a display of the skill, beauty and endurance of the dancer. Literature There have been few published I-Kiribati literary writers. Teresia Teaiwa stands out as one of the most notable.\\"Country profile: Kiribati\\", The Guardian, April 22, 2009 Bubuti system The bubuti system occurs when one is in need of some item and may borrow it from a friend, relative or neighbour.

Later the Kadambas (helped by the Yavanas) attacked kuttuvan by sea, but the Cera ruler destroyed their fleet. * Kuttuvan defeated the Kongu people (Cilappatikaram, XXV, 152-53). Kuttuvan defeated a warrior called Pazhaiyan Mokur Mannan (one of the Cera's allies was Arukai, an enemy of the Mokurs) (Patitrupattu, 44 and 49). *The patikam to Patitrupattu, decad V mentions Ilanko Atikal and the expedition of Cenkuttuvan to north India to bring a stone from which to carve the Pattini idol (scholars are of the opinion that the patikam is a later interpolation to the text)  Cenkuttuvan Cera in Cilappatikaram  Authorship of Cilappatikaram is traditionally ascribed to prince Ilanko Atikal (literally the Junior Prince), who appears in the work as the younger brother of Cenkuttuvan Cera. The third part of Cilappatikaram (the Vanci Kantham) deals with Cenkuttuvan's expedition to bring the virakkallu from the Himalayas for an idol of Kannaki/Pattini. According to the patikam of Cilappatikaram, the royal astrologer at the court of Cera king predicted that (the younger prince) Ilanko would succeed the king, which angered the elder prince Cenkuttuvan. Ilanko at once chose to renounce his claims to the throne and live a life of an Jain ascetic. He shifted to a monastery on the outskirts of Vanci, where he composed epic Cilappatikaram. The Bhagavati Temple, in Kotungallur, Kerala, is claimed to be the Kannaki temple thus consecrated. = Dating Cenkuttuvan Cera = A method known as Gajabahu synchronism/Triple Synchronism is used by some scholars to date Cenkuttuvan Cera to 2nd century AD.Zvelebil, Kamil V., Companion Studies to the History of Tamil Literature, Leiden, 1992. 110-111. * According to Cilappatikaram (text proper, canto 30:160), severals neighbouring kings were invited by Cenkuttuvan to the installation of Kannaki-Pattini at Vanci. **the Arya kings Kanaka and Vijaya **Kongu king of Kutaku **Kayavaku, the king of Lanka *Kayavaku,the king of Lanka is identified with Gajabahu I, king of Sri Lanka (r. c. 171/73 - 193 AD). In this context, Cenkuttuvan can be dated to either the first or last quarter of the 2nd century AD. *Despite its dependency on numerous conjectures, the method is considered as the sheet anchor for the purpose of dating the events in the early historic Tamil texts.

Rajaraja Narendra established the city Rajahmahendravaram (Rajahmundry). His period was famous for Social and Cultural heritage. During the time of Rajaraja Chola I, Rajahmundry was sacked by Western Chalukya. The region witnessed the war between Western Chalukya and other neighbouring dynasties and political support by Chola dynasty. Amangai Devi, daughter of Rajendra Chola I, married Rajaraja Narendra Chalukya, who is the son of Vimaladitya Chalukya. The feudatorial relationship with the powerful Cholas and Powerful Chalukya continued for three centuries from Arinjaya Chola. The son of Rajaraja Narendra Chalukya, Rajiga Chalukya who also called Kulottunga Chola I went for a raid up to Kedah (Indonesia) for his maternal uncle. He became the king of the Chola empire in Gangaikondacholapuram when a political vacuum occurred. He then merged the Chola and Chalukya dynasty. He is the first emperor of Chalukya Cholas. He was a liberal ruler as several land grants were given to the members of the Shudra community who were generals and royal officials during his reign. As he relaxed tax, he also called 'sungam thavirtha cholan'. Kubja Vishnuvardhana, the progenitor of Eastern Chalukyas, in his Timmapuram plates claimed to belong to the Manavya gotra. The Aravidu dynasty of Vijayanagara empire claimed descent from Rajaraja Narendra, however, they belonged to the Atreya gotra, unlike their claimed ancestor. Literary works during his time Eastern Chalukya Dynasty supported Jainism and Shaivism. Rajaraja Narendra was a Shaivite. He respected Brahmin priests, Sanskrit language and religion. He learned from the success of Jains and Buddhists that a good way to popularize religion and Puranas was to translate them into Telugu. Even a thousand years before, Buddhism and Jainism became very popular using local languages for their sermons and teachings. So, Rajaraja Narendra requested his teacher, adviser, and court poet Nannayya Bhattaraka to translate Sanskrit Mahabharata into Telugu for his subjects. Nannaya made Telugu versions of two and half parvas of Mahabharatha during the times of Raja Narendra. After more than 200 years Tikkana & Errapragada resumed the same. Raja Raja Narendra's major contribution to the Telugu community is mainly the support he gave to Nannaya to make the first & detailed grapheme script for the Telugu Language with all grammar, punctuations, and on. Which is itself a far bigger achievement from the perspective of the evolution of the Telugu Language which is now ranking as 16th most spoken language in the world (93+ Million / 9.3 Crores of Speakers). Telugu community owe great visionary for his decision to make a script to Telugu so that its community can one day stand tall having a great language with a perfect grapheme that can write better than ENGLISH itself. Ex: Telugu can write \\"BUT\\" and \\"PUT\\" with perfect phoneme output without the need to remember the knowledge about how to pronounce them. Credit goes to Raja Raja Narendra and Nannaya Bhttaraka.

Malagan ceremonies Malagan ceremonies are the most large-scale and famous of the many events that take place within the malagan culture. They take place irregularly, and are typically large and complex events, taking several days, and requiring months or years of preparation. While a malagan ceremony is always held in the name of one or more people who have died in recent years, it is not at all merely a mortuary rite. Many other interactions take place within the overall event, including announcements, repayment of debts, recognition of obligations, resolution of disputes, and many other customary activities. Malagan carvings and carvers Malagan carvings Malagan carvings, now world-famous, are the wooden carvings which are created for use in malagan ceremonies. Traditionally these were burnt or placed in a cave to rot at the conclusion of the event; in modern times most are now retained, as the carving tradition is now only known by a few.

G-Land is most commonly reached via boat charter from Bali.  Tourism  Line up of surf spot commonly known as G-Land, or Grajagan. Discovery In 1972, a core group of American surfers organized the first expedition to G-Land. Two surfers sent out ahead, went by local transport overland, arrived in Grajagan village near the river mouth and had to walk about 20km along the beach with their boards and food supplies setting up base camp for the boats arrival with more supplies and boards from Bali. They had very little fresh water and would have to collect it off the sails when it rained. Surf Camps Soon after the discovery, Mike Boyum helped set up the first surf camp at G-Land, which was possibly the start of the surf camp concept that has since spread across the globe. Balinese surfer Bobby Radiasa took over the operation in the late 70s and still runs it today.http://www.grajagan.com/ Bobby's Surf Camp From the days of the original Boyum/Bobby's camp other camps have opened at G-Landhttp://www.g-land.com/ Djojo Surf Camp offering various standards of accommodation and facilities to suit a range of holiday budgets, with G-Land Bobby's Surf Camp (http://www.grajagan.com)http://www.grajagan.com. A second surf camp, located in the jungle in front of Speedies Reef is named Joyo's Surf Camp (http://www.g-land.com)http://www.g-land.com. The third surf camp, located closest to the only viewing tower and the paddle out point, is G-land Surf Camp (www.g-landsurfcamp.com/).http://www.g-landsurfcamp.com/  Geomorphology  The south coast of Java faces the Indian Ocean, so it is exposed to large swells generated by low pressure systems circling Antarctica, many thousands of kilometers to the south. G-Land is situated on the eastern side of the Bay of Grajagan, so it has a westerly aspect; i.e. at right angles to the predominant swell direction. As a result, swell wraps around the point and into the eastern side of the bay, producing long, walling left-handers, which peel at a rapid rate along a half kilometer stretch of shallow coral reef, forming perfectly hollow tubes that remain open the whole way. The wind at G-Land blows offshore between the months of April and September, which also happens to be when the swells are at their largest and most consistent. Since the swells are generated by low pressure systems circling Antarctica, their regularity coincides with the passage of these lows. So, the swell arrive in pulses, each lasting for a couple of days, with a couple of days between each swell. Waves tend to be bigger and better at high tide, so it's best to plan a surf trip for the week following a full or new moon, since this is when the tide is high during the middle of the day.  Tsunami  Java is situated in a tectonic subduction zone, where the Indo-Australian Plate is moving northward, sliding under the Eurasian Plate at a rate of 67 mm/yr. Occasionally, however, the tectonic plate suddenly slips a much greater distance, resulting in an earthquake. In 1994, a major earthquake, registering 7.2 on the Richter Scale, occurred in the Java Trench, 205 km SW of G-Land. The quake triggered a tsunami, which swept through the surf camp about 40 minutes later.Tsuji et al. \\"Field Survey of the East Java Earthquake and Tsunami of June 3, 1994.\\" Pure and Applied Geophysics. 144.3/4 (1995) The runup at G-Land was estimated to have been as high as 5.6 meters. No lives were lost at G-Land. However, 223 people perished further west, where the villages of Rajekwesi, Pancer and Lampon were almost completely levelled by the tsunami.Maramai1, A. et al. \\"The 3 June 1994 Java Tsunami: A Post-Event Survey of the Coastal Effects\\" Natural Hazards. Volume 15, Number 1, pp 31-49 (January 1997) Surfer John Philbin was at G-Land on the night of the tsunami. He described hearing the surf and thinking it must be big. \\"But when the roar grew louder, I sat up inside my mosquito net, and just as I did, a churning wall of water blew through my hut.\\" Richie Lovett described the experience as \\"being hit by a train at full speed\\". Richard Marsh initially thought a tiger was attacking them, but then realized it was a wave. Marsh and Lovett were swept hundreds of feet into the jungle by the wave. \\"I was completely panicking. It was a matter of surviving, just grabbing onto things to stay above the water, trying to keep all the debris away from my head and, above all, to get a breath.\\" Marsh said. Lovett had to be returned to Australia for medical attention. \\"The hut had disappeared and I was entwined in logs and trees and bits of bamboo. When the water started to subside. I was stuck with my legs pinned under a whole lot of logs and rubbish.\\" The other surfers visiting G-Land when the tsunami struck were Australians Monty Webber, Gerald Saunders, Rob Bain, Shanne Herring, Simon Law, Kevin Komick as well as Californians Tyler Rootleib, Eric Collision and Michael Klosterman.

Surf break Looking through the jungle at 'Money-Trees' the most popular section of the wave. A very long, world-class, barreling left hand reef/point break breaks along the east side of Grajagan Bay. It has long been considered one of the world's best left hand waves. The correct name of the point upon which the main wave breaks is \\"Plengkung.\\" The wave becomes shallower and more critical the further down the point one rides the wave. It is one of the most consistently rideable waves in the world in season, with offshore tradewinds and often plentiful swell between the months of, roughly, mid April to mid October. The G-Land surf break has been divided up into several sections. The first, at the top of the point, is called \\"Kongs,\\" which breaks up to several hundred metres in length, and can hold quite large sizes (from about 2 to 12 feet+, Hawaiian scale). It is not usually a barrel, nor genuinely world-class, but more a series of takeoff zones with some long wall sections, although it can also barrel on occasions. This is also where surfers can find the 'key- hole' which is a section of the reef that allows a more forgivable paddle out. This section picks up a lot of swell, and is rarely less than 3 feet, and can be a saviour when the rest of the point is too small. This wave can sometimes link up with the next section called \\"Moneytrees.\\" Moneytrees works from about 2 to 10 feet (Hawaiian scale, or about 4 to 20 feet wave faces), usually breaking over several hundred metres, and is a long, testing, barreling, world-class wave. The barrels become more critical the lower the tide and the larger the swell. Moneytrees may also occasionally link up with the next section called \\"Speedies,\\" with an outside takeoff section between the two called \\"Launching Pads.\\" \\"Launching Pads\\" can catch the surfer offguard, as it can break a significant way out to sea in larger swells. \\"Speedies\\" (named after how fast the wave breaks) is the heaviest wave at G-Land, but can be a perfect, very round barrel for several hundred metres, rideable from about 2 to 8 feet+ (Hawaiian scale). It usually needs larger swells, and low tide can be very dangerous. Most severe injuries at G-Land have occurred at \\"Speedies.\\" It is not common to ride a wave more than about 300‚Äì400 metres at G-Land, even though the section of the point where rideable waves break is considerably longer (over 1 km long), because the waves usually don't link up with each other. The dry season (May to October) is far and away the best time to go. That is when the offshore southeast trade winds blow and the swell, pouring out of the Southern Ocean, is at its biggest and most consistent. Other nearby surf breaks There are a few other, smaller waves further down and within the bay, which include \\"Chickens,\\" \\"20/20,\\" \\"Tiger Tracks,\\" Parang Ireng' and a few unnamed others. These waves generally only work on larger swells, but are surprisingly good alternatives when the main point is big. All of these waves can barrel in the right conditions, which generally require higher tides. There are also some right hand waves on the other side of the peninsula at G-Land, but they are fickle, requiring large swells, and no wind or off-season winds. Another right hand wave is situated about 20 miles east of G-land, which has been featured in Indonesian surf magazines, and dubbed as \\"Reverse G.\\" It is apparently a quality, long, right hand wave (the 'reverse' of G-Land) but which is very difficult to get to, requiring some boat access, and furthermore only works in off-season winds (about late November to April).

The church is distinguished as one of 84 in the United States (and one of only four in the state of Texas) bearing the papal designation of \\"minor basilica.\\" Despite its religious importance it is not the cathedral of the local diocese; that distinction belongs to San Fernando Cathedral. History The Basilica is dedicated to St. Th√©r√®se de Lisieux of the Child Jesus, and bearing her nickname, \\"The Little Flower\\" of Jesus. The cornerstone of her basilica was solemnly blessed and laid on October 15, 1929.Basilica History Its remarkable edifice and accompanying works of religious art are uniquely uncharacteristic of its relatively recent construction. The Basilica is a treasury of art, master craftsmanship, and relics. The Discalced Carmelite Friars began serving the surrounding parish community in San Antonio in 1926. The Basilica was thus constructed during the Great Depression (1929‚Äì1931) and today stands as a monument to the great faith of devotees of St. Th√©r√®se from throughout the United States and the world. Perhaps the most treasured work of art at the Basilica is a painting of St. Th√©r√®se, a gift from the Carmel of Lisieux to the friars of San Antonio in 1927. The saint‚Äôs blood sister C√©line Martin (1869-1959), also a nun (Sr. Genevieve of the Holy Face) in the Carmel of Lisieux, created the model for this painting, referred to as the \\"Apotheosis,\\" at the request of the Vatican during the canonization process for Th√©r√®se, according to the Archives of Carmel in Lisieux. Another artist, Pascal Blanchard, painted several large canvases based on Celine‚Äôs model. C√©line and another nun, Sr. Marie of the Holy Spirit, then retouched the face on each copy. One of these paintings was the standard carried in the procession to St. Peter's during the canonization ceremony on May 17, 1925; it was returned to the nuns after the ceremony. The Basilica‚Äôs painting is one of the several others that were loaned out by the Convent of Lisieux to Carmels in France for the canonization events. The painting was acquired for the friars of San Antonio by Fr. Raymon Gomez, one of the four original friars who arrived in San Antonio in 1926. He was instrumental in bringing to fruition the friars‚Äô dream of building a National Shrine to be dedicated to the newly canonized St. Th√©r√®se. It‚Äôs recorded in Basilica archives that he went to France in 1927 to visit the sisters of St. Th√©r√®se's Discalced Carmelite Convent in Lisieux to ask for their blessing on the project. The nuns, including St. Th√©r√®se‚Äôs sister Pauline, who was then prioress of Lisieux, were delighted with the idea and pledged their support. Along with their blessings, the nuns sent gifts, including autographed books and photos, medals, printed collection cards, relics of all degrees, and this beautiful portrait to grace the Shrine upon its opening. The original painting was restored with the support of the Strake Foundation of Houston and reinstalled in a place of honor in the Basilica in 2007. It is wide by tall, and is located in the undercroft of the church. Significance Now that the National Shrine of the Little Flower has joined the ranks of a minor basilica, the church's ecclesiastical throne has become, symbolically, a papal throne. The throne is original to the Basilica and has been used by various visiting prelates for over 70 years. Most recently it has been used by the Archbishop and auxiliary bishops of the Archdiocese of San Antonio during special liturgies, such as feast day Masses and ordinations at the Basilica. =Relics= The Basilica of the Little Flower safeguards the relics of both St. Th√©r√®se and her parents, Sts. Louis Martin and Marie-Az√©lie Gu√©rin. St. Th√©r√®se The Basilica is home to three first class relics of the Little Flower. Two are contained within the tomb chapel of St. Th√©r√®se. The relics of Th√©r√®se are regularly exposed on a weekly basis for public veneration. The parents of St. Th√©r√®se First class relics of Sts. Louis and Z√©lie Martin, the parents of St. Th√©r√®se of Lisieux, were exposed Oct. 18, 2015 at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Little Flower for public veneration for the first time on the day of the couple‚Äôs canonization in Rome by the Catholic Church. The relics were a gift to the Discalced Carmelite Friars of San Antonio from the Discalced Carmelite nuns of Lafayette, LA. The back of the reliquary depicts the biblical couple Sara and Tobias, recalling the essential role of marriage as a vocation in human history and in the history of salvation. The theme of Sara and Tobias is taken from the medal that Louis Martin chose as a souvenir of his wedding with Zelie Guerin on July 13, 1858 in Notre Dame d‚ÄôAlen√ßon. The original medal was blessed during the exchange of the rings and is at the Diocese of S√©ez, France. The reliquary contains particles of the Martins‚Äô hair.

Betting shops are frequently found in many towns and cities. This one is situated in the road leading off the A205 north of Turnham Green Tube station, London A betting pool, sports lottery, sweep, or office pool if done at work, is a form of gambling, specifically a variant of parimutuel betting influenced by lotteries, where gamblers pay a fixed price into a pool (from which taxes and a house \\"take\\" or \\"vig\\" are removed), and then make a selection on an outcome, usually related to sport. In an informal game, the vig is usually quite small or non-existent. The pool is evenly divided between those that have made the correct selection. There are no odds involved; each winner's payoff depends simply on the number of gamblers and the number of winners. (True parimutuel betting, which was historically referred to as pool betting, involves both odds calculations and variable wager amounts.) Betting pools are not connected merely to sports, as there are topics such as deaths and births which people can bet on. Death pools usually involve well-known individuals, such as celebrities and sports figures, which the participants predict will die within a certain period of time, with more points being assigned to individuals who are under the age of 80 years or appear to be in generally good health. On the other hand, birth pools involve individuals picking specific dates in which someone, who can be either a celebrity or friend, gives birth. History Contestants predict the outcome of sporting events that take place at a later time. The concept was introduced in 1923 by Littlewoods Pools where it was known as Uri and based on football matches. Sports Betting Globally Today in England, sports lotteries are more commonly referred to as football pools. American sports lotteries often do not require contestants to purchase a lottery ticket or make an initial wager. Hockey pools are common in North America and footy tipping in Australia. In the United States the most popular type of betting pool is the March Madness pools. Leading up to the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship, contestants will fill out brackets that predict who will win. It is estimated that 58 million Americans participate in the contest every year. Mainstream media outlets such as ESPN, CBS, and Fox Sports host tournaments online where contestants can enter for free. There are also notable sport betting pools across the globe such as Hollywoodbets, American Totalisator, Sport Select and a lot more. Employers have also noticed a change in the behavior of employees during this time. They have seen an increase in the number of sick days used, extended lunch breaks, and even the rescheduling of conference calls to allow for more tournament watching. There are also many handicappers and pundits which offer advice for winning your bracket. Another popular type of betting pool is the college football bowl game.

History Hope Valley was more the result of random settlement than of actual town planning. Jacob Pitman first purchased an section (Section 824) in 1839. In the early 1840s he sold a few allotments. One such allotment was purchased in 1841 by his friend William Holden who set up a butcher's shop and general store. The site of this store was near the present corner of Grand Junction and Valley Roads. Holden is credited with naming the area \\"Hope Valley\\" after returning home in 1842 to find that his house and business had burnt down in a bushfire, but rather than becoming despondent, he felt optimistic. Holden left the area in 1851 to pursue a career in journalism. Hope Valley was mainly settled by German emigrants escaping religious persecution. Holden spoke German and often acted as interpreter. This is seen as a reason many Germans moved to Hope Valley from Klemzig approximately six kilometres away. In 1847 Hermann Friedrich Koch purchased of Section 824 and applied for a licence to open a public house ‚Äì the Bremen Arms. The Bremen Arms was the venue for much of the settlement's meetings in those early days, but since 1905 has been known simply as The Bremen. The original rough stone building has since been encapsulated by a 1970s plain brick structure, which has been expanded on many occasions. Recent renovations have uncovered a curious art deco style corner complete with a sea green round window. This has since been recovered, and the original stonework arches have been exposed and re-pointed in 2010. In 1849 William Holden formed a committee to establish a school in the area. One acre of land on Grand Junction Road, west of the Bremen Arms, was purchased. The land was then divided into three sections for: a schoolhouse, cemetery, and playground. Also in that year Hope Valley became part of the postal route from Adelaide to Mount Torrens and Holden assumed the role of Postmaster. In 1872 the earthworks that formed the Hope Valley Reservoir began, one of Adelaide's larger bodies of water. Present day Hope Valley has since been assimilated as a suburb of the City of Tea Tree Gully and Greater Metropolitan Adelaide. The entire area is now residential, focused around the Hope Valley Shopping Centre. The Bremen's current incarnation stands on the same block. The Institute still stands mostly as it was first built in 1921 and the old section of the cemetery still contains gravestones of some of the original settlers.

While the Indian caste system generally modelled the four-fold division of society into Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras, in Kerala the Nambudiri Brahmins formed the priestly class and only rarely recognised anyone else as being other than Shudra or untouchables, the latter being outside the caste system entirely. Thus, the Kerala caste system was ritualised but it was not the varna model found elsewhere. In Southern India, only in Kerala did there appear warrior lineages approximate to the Kshatriya model. These warriors never lost their identity as Sudras. Nayar Kshatriya hood is based on special ecological conditions and it is a case of elevated sudra to Kshatriya status. Origin of the caste system One theory that explains the origins of the caste system in the Kerala region ‚Äì which prior to the independence of India comprised the three areas known as Malabar District, Travancore and CochinFuller (1976), p. 53. ‚Äì is based on the actions of Aryan Jains introducing such distinctions prior to the 8th century CE. This argues that the Jains needed protection when they arrived in the area and recruited a group of local sympathizers to provide it. These people were then distinguished from others in the local population by their occupation as protectors, with the others all being classed as out-caste. Cyriac Pullapilly, a Professor of History, describes that this meant they \\"... were given Kshatriya functions, but only Shudra status.\\"Pullapily (1976), pp. 26‚Äì30. An alternative theory, also explained by Pullapilly, states that the system was introduced by Nambudiri Brahmins themselves. Although Brahmin influences had existed in the area since at least the 1st century CE, there was a large influx of these people from around the 8th century when they acted as priests, counsellors and ministers to invading Aryan princes. At the time of their arrival, the non-aboriginal local population had been converted to Buddhism by missionaries who had come from the north of India and from Ceylon. The Brahmins used their symbiotic relationship with the invading forces to assert their beliefs and position. Buddhist temples and monasteries were either destroyed or taken over for use in Hindu practices, thus undermining the ability of the Buddhists to propagate their beliefs. The Brahmins treated almost all of those who acceded to their priestly status as Shudra, permitting only a small number to be recognised as Kshatriya, these being some of the local rulers who co-operated with them. By the 11th century, this combination of association with kings and invaders, and with the destruction or take-over of Buddhist temples, made the Brahmins by far the largest land-owning group in the region and they remained so until very recent times. The origins of Malayalam as a language is also attributed to the Nambudiri Brahmin's mixing of Sanskrit and the local Tamil language. Their dominating influence was to be found in all matters: religion, politics, society, economics and culture. A theory presented by Pullapilly and also by Rene Barendse, who is a Fellow of the International Institute for Asian Studies, claims that the caste system established by Nambudiri Brahmins of Kerala was in accordance with the will of Parasurama, an avatar of Vishnu. The Nambudiris had control of 64 villages and asserted that they had powers given to them by the gods, so much so that they considered even other Brahmin groups to be outside the caste hierarchy. Both writers consider this to be the traditional Nambudiri myth of origin.Barendse (2009), p. 640. Before Aryan migration Pulayas were known as Kshatriyas, the only surviving indigenous tribe of Kerala. The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy, outranking even the kings. Anyone who was not a Nambudiri was treated by them as an untouchable.Gough (1961), p. 306. Ritual pollution The entire Malabar region had strict pollution rules that were considered by the observers to be the most extreme in all of India. Lower caste people could use only separate paths and their houses were in places where they could not be seen. Lower castes can pollute a Brahmin or Nair not by mere touch but also coming within certain feet from them. Nair warriors could kill a lower caste Pulayar on sight if they met with one of them in the highway. The Nambudhri Brahmins were top of the caste hierarchy and the Pulayar were at the lowest. According to most travelers, the Nairs were placed below the kings and the Brahmins in Caste hierarchy. The Ambalavasis were kept between the Brahmins and the Nairs. The lower castes were known as tintal jati, i.e. castes which pollutes at a distance. The food of the upper castes were referred to as \\"Amruthathu\\" (elixir) and the food of the lower castes was called \\"karikadi\\" (black brew), similarly the dwelling places of the higher castes and the thatched huts of the lower castes were called the \\"royal abode\\" and \\"the field of rubbish\\" respectively. The lower castes, particularly the Pulayars were not even allowed to breathe the same air with the other castes or use a public pathway. A lower caste person could pollute a higher caste person by merely coming within certain distance from him or in extreme cases the pollution is transmitted even by simply seeing a lower caste person. If by accident he was there and he sees an approaching Nair or a Brahmin, he must make a loud howling sound to warn the upper castes from getting near until he went away or climbed up a tree. If a Nair meets a Pulayar in the highway by accident, he cuts him down like a others cut an unpleasant animal. The Nair's right to kill any Pulayar imminently he met on the pathway is confirmed by almost all visitors to Kerala. Even the other lower castes had no communication with the Pulayar. According to Buchanan, the Nairs killed not only the Pulayars but any member of the other lower polluting castes, including the Ezhavas. Pollution rules were also observed in touching and sexual intercourse with the lower castes. Casting out the person from the caste was the punishment for disobeying the caste rules regarding pollution and in some cases sold into slavery and even death. If a Nambudhiri Brahmin women is accused of illegitimate sexual relations, she is kept in a separate hut as her presence could pollute other members of her family before being interrogated by a caste court, the system is known as smarttivicaram. Pollution by approaching a Muslim, Christian or a Jew is not observed but their touch is considered polluting. The custom for removing pollution is a bath by complete immersion in water. The Nambudiris had varying rules regarding the degrees of ritual pollution while interacting with people of different castes. In return, most castes practised the principles of untouchability in their relationship with the other regional castes.Jeffrey (1976), pp. 9‚Äì10. Untouchability in Kerala is not restricted to Hindus, and George Mathew says that, \\"Technically, the Christians were outside the caste hierarchy, but in practice a system of inclusion and exclusion was developed ...\\".Mathew (1989), p. 22. Among Christians, the established Syrian Christians also practised the rules of untouchability. In the colonial period, many lower castes were converted to Christians by the European Missionaries, but the new converts were not allowed to join the Syrian Christian community and they continued to be considered as untouchables even by the Syrian Christians. Syrian Christians derive status within the caste system from the tradition that they were elites, who were evangelised by Thomas the Apostle.Fuller (1976), pp. 55-56.Fuller, C.J. \\"Indian Christians: Pollution and Origins.\\" Man. New Series, Vol. 12, No. 3/4. (Dec. 1977), pp. 528‚Äì529.Amaladass (1993), pp. 15-19. Anand Amaladass says that \\"The Syrian Christians had inserted themselves within the Indian caste society for centuries and were regarded by the Hindus as a caste occupying a high place within their caste hierarchy.\\"Amaladass (1993), p. 18. Syrian Christians followed the same rules of caste and pollution as that of Hindus and they were considered as pollution neutralisers.Vadakkekara, Benedict (2007). Origin of Christianity in India: a Historiographical Critique, pp. 325‚Äì330. Media House Delhi. Rajendra Prasad, an Indian historian, said that the Syrian Christians took ritual baths after physical contact with lower castes and also the Nairs. The rules of untouchability were severe to begin with, and they were very strictly enforced among Hindu communities by the time of the arrival of the Dutch East India Company in the 17th century. Robin Jeffrey, who is a professor specialising in the modern history and politics of India, quotes the wife of a Christian missionary, who wrote in 1860 that: Nonetheless, higher ranked communities did have some social responsibility for those perceived to be their inferiors: for example, they could demand forced labour but had to provide food for such labourers, and they had a responsibilities in times of famine to provide their tenants both with food and with the seeds to grow it. There were also responsibilities to protect such people from the dangers of attack and other threats to their livelihood, and so it has been described by Barendse as \\"an intricate dialectic of rights and duties\\".Barendse (2009), pp. 641-642. = Ritual pollution during slavery = According to an estimate by Dr. Francis Buchanan in 1801 AD, 41,367 persons out of the 292,366 populations were slaves in the south, central and Northern divisions of the Malabar. In the census of 1836, 164,864 people out of the 1,280,668 were slaves in Travancore. There was an estimated 4.25 lakh slaves in Kerala during the middle of the 19th century. The slaves belonged to the lower castes and were employed only for feudal work, and the stigma that they should be kept away from their masters was strictly followed. Samuel Mateer, noted that even in the working fields the slaves were supervised from a distance. Based on the 1881 census an estimated 40,000 slaves converted to Islam form 1871 to 1881. Many slaves also converted to Christianity in Cochin and Travancore during this period. During the 1882 Christian Mission Conference, it was reported that the population of Muslim Mapillas were increasing rapidly due to the conversion from the lower strata of the Hindu society and in such phase the entire west coast could become Muslim. Caste system in colonial Kerala By the late 19th century, the caste system of Kerala had evolved to be the most complex to be found anywhere in India, and the exploitation of it had become considerable. Barendse explains this development: By this time there were over 500 groups represented in an elaborate structure of relationships and the concept of ritual pollution extended not merely to untouchability but even further, to un-approachability and even un-seeability. The system was gradually reformed to some degree, with one of those reformers, Swami Vivekananda, having observed that it represented a \\"mad house\\" of castes. The usual four-tier Hindu caste system, involving the varnas of Brahmin (priest), Kshatriya (warrior), Vaishya (business person, involved in trading, entrepreneurship and finance) and Shudra (service person), did not exist. Kshatriyas were rare and the Vaishyas were not present at all. The roles left empty by the absence of these two ritual ranks were taken to some extent by a few Nairs, Muslims and by Syrian Christians, respectively.Nossiter (1982), pp.25‚Äì27. Caste in the modern era The process of amelioration of caste distinctions by various social reform movements were overtaken by the events of 1947. With independence from Britain came the Indian constitution, and Article 15 of that document outlawed discrimination on the grounds of caste and race.Constitution. Myron Weiner has said that the ideological basis for caste \\"... may be (almost, but not quite) moribund\\"Weiner (2001), p. 195. and that: Weiner points out that despite the ideological demise: Despite being outlawed, the Indian governments ‚Äì both at national and at regional level ‚Äì do still recognise distinctions between the various communities but this recognition is for the purpose of positive discrimination. Throughout post-independence India, including in Kerala, there exists a framework of reservation which is fluid in nature and attempts to recognise the socio-economic disparities between various castes. Depending both on local circumstances and on the changing modern socio-economic environment, castes are classified as Forward Classes (or General), Other Backward Classes, Scheduled Castes, and the Scheduled Tribes. These classifications determine what \\\\- if any \\\\- assistance a caste community receives in any given area. Formal classification lists are compiled for the latter three groups; any community which is not listed in any of those categories is, by default, a Forward Class. Writing in the context of violence against Dalits (untouchables) elsewhere in India, Frontline magazine said in 2006 that: However, Frontline goes on to note that the situation in Kerala now, is not as severe, to the extent that those seeking to research: Demographics Around 2003, the Government of Kerala recognised 53 Scheduled Castes, 35 Scheduled Tribes and 80 Other Backwards Classes. The 2001 Census of India recognised 68 Scheduled Castes, who comprised 9.8% of the population. They were 99.9% Hindu, with a negligible number of Sikhs and Buddhists. The Census recognised 35 Scheduled Tribes, comprising 1.14% of the population and with 93.7% being Hindus. A further 5.8% were Christian, and the remainder Muslim or \\"not stated\\".

The band's name derives from a Dillon Fence song of the same name that Collapsis front man Mike Garrigan asked Dillon Fence front man Greg Humphreys' blessing to use as the band's moniker. History In 1996, singer/songwriter Mike Garrigan recorded and released his second full-length album, The Lessons of Autumn. The album departed from its predecessor, Building A Hole, by incorporating instrumentation beyond acoustic guitar, including a full-band sound on several songs. The album increased Garrigan's popularity in the Chapel Hill/Triangle-area music scene and gained the attention of industry A&R; reps. Garrigan soon began working with former Dillon Fence drummer Scott Carle, planting the seeds for what would later become Collapsis. In 1998, Collapsis released The Chartreuse EP, and gained a significant following in North Carolina and throughout the southeastern United States. The band then signed to Cherry Entertainment (a subsidiary of Universal Records). Collapsis' lone major-label offering, Dirty Wake, was released Feb. 15, 2000, and the album's lead single, \\"Automatic\\", peaked at #28 on the Billboard Modern Rock in 2000. Collapsis also wrote the title song to the movie Clay Pigeons, titled \\"Clay Pigeons: The Ballad of Lester Long.\\" The song was a light and humorous paean to going on a murder spree. Their song \\"Wonderland\\" was featured on Beer Bad, an episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, in a scene where characters Willow and Parker were chatting. In 2001, Mike Garrigan became a member of the band Athenaeum and, after its disbanding, went on to form the group mg4. In 2003, Ryan Pickett began working with My Morning Jacket and remains the band's front-of-house sound engineer. Scott Carle has performed with most, if not all, Triangle-area bands and musicians, and has appeared in 10 or so R and PG films. Following Collapsis' disbanding, Chris Holloway became a chef and, after a nearly two-decade hiatus from the music industry, released a solo record, Swarming in the Glow, in 2019.

Incorporated in 1704, the township was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia under the 1854 Act of Consolidation. History An irregularly shaped area of 7,580 acres (31 km¬≤), Blockley Township was located on the west side of the Schuylkill River, north of Kingsessing Township; bounded on the east by the Schuylkill; extending south from the county line, opposite to, but a little below, the mouth of the Wissahickon, down to the Nanganesy or Mill Creek, below the Woodlands; then by the same creek up to Chadd‚Äôs Ford Turnpike, known in later years as the Baltimore Pike; along the same to Cobb‚Äôs Creek; then by the courses of the same to the county line adjoining Lower Merion Township, Montgomery County, and along the same to the Schuylkill River. Within its boundaries were the villages of Hamilton, Mantua, West Philadelphia, Hestonville and Haddington. It was traversed by the Darby Road (today's Woodland Avenue) and Chadd‚Äôs Ford or Baltimore Pike, the road to West Chester, to Haverford and to Lancaster. The name is derived from Blockley, a parish in England in Worcestershire from which the township's founder, William Warner, hailed. In Philadelphia, \\"Blockley\\" was synonymous with the Blockley Almshouse that opened here in 1832. The township also contained The Woodlands; the former estate of William Hamilton, grandson of Andrew Hamilton, which was converted in 1840 to the Woodlands Cemetery. The boundaries and area changed on February 17, 1844, when the area encompassing Mantua and Hamilton were incorporated into the Borough of West Philadelphia, dividing the remaining township into two almost unconnected sections. The township was incorporated into Philadelphia proper by the 1854 Act of Consolidation.

Behavior Male at Amboli Ghat An Adult female Rhacophorus malabaricus resting on the building of a temple in the Bisle Ghats. The term \\"gliding\\" frog refers to its ability to break its fall by stretching the webbing between its toes when making leaps down from the treetops. It can make gliding jumps of 9‚Äì12 m, a maximum of about 115 times its length. Description Close-up of snout This frog has a body length of about 10 cm (4 in), making it one of the largest moss frogs. Males are smaller than females. Its back skin is finely granulated and the color is vivid green without markings, distinguishing it from the otherwise quite similar R. pseudomalabaricus, which has a black-marbled back and was long included in the present species.E.g. by Boulenger (1890) In preserved specimens, the back turns purplish blue. The belly is more coarsely granulated - particularly under the thighs - and pale yellow. There are skin fringes between and along the long limbs, and a triangular skin extension at the heel. The webbing between fingers and toes is large and orange-red.Boulenger (1890), Bordoloi et al. (2007) The vomerine teeth are arranged in two straight or slightly oblique series touching the inner front edge of the choanae. The snout is rounded but not very wide, about as long as the diameter of the orbit, the canthus rostralis is bluntly-angled, and the loral region is concave. The nostrils are located nearer to the end of the snout than to the eyes. The interorbital space is broader than the upper eyelid. The tympanum measures about 60‚Äì70% of the diameter of the eye.Boulenger (1890) The disks of fingers and toes are large, about the size of the tympanum; the subarticular tubercles are well-developed, also. The tibio-tarsal articulation reaches at least to the eye, at most top the nostril. Reproduction Like many moss frogs, they build foam nests above small pools of water, into which the tadpoles drop after hatching.Kadadevaru and Kanamadi (2000) {  Malabar gliding frogs in amplexus: Note much smaller male on top.

Concept Arbeidsvitaminen was created as a late-morning entertainment show by Jaap den Daas, a programme maker for AVRO and also the man behind such other classic shows of Dutch radio as De Bonte Dinsdagavondtrein (The colourful Tuesday evening train) and Hersengymnastiek. (Brain gymnastics) Originally each edition of the show focused on a single company or organisation. The employees were asked to create their Top 10 list of favourite records and these were played during the show, and the head of the company or organization was featured as \\"Boss of the Day\\". After 11.00 a guest celebrity (usually someone in the news that week) was interviewed in the show. For example, in 2004 Dutch crown prince Willem- Alexander was a guest.http://radio.nl/15951/prins-willem-alexander-in- arbeidsvitaminen-op-3fm The show also had special theme weeks in which humanitarian organisations were promoted. A recurring item was \\"One Minute\\", a collaboration with the Dutch TV show \\"Opsporing Verzocht\\", (Investigation Wanted) where witnesses of a certain crime were asked to contact the radio station in case they could provide the investigators with more information. Since its move to NPO Radio 5 on 6 September 2010 Arbeidsvitaminen has become exclusively a record request show. In 2006 a compilation CD was released featuring the most frequently requested music in the programme's 60-year history. At the same time a CD-rom, Mega Hitparade, was issued, summarizing the show's playlists from February 1946 to May 1957.

'Elephant-Arm'), also known as Gajabahuka Gamani (c. 113 ‚Äì 135 CE), was a Sinhalese king of Rajarata in Sri Lanka. He is renowned for his religious benefactions, extensive involvement in south Indian politics, and for possibly introducing the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The primary source for his reign is the Mahavamsa, though he is also the only early Sri Lankan king (along with Elara) to be extensively mentioned in the Chera Cilappatikaram (also spelled Silapathikaram). Life and Religion Next to nothing is known about Gajabahu's youth, except that he was son of Vankanasika Tissa (reigned 110-113), king of Rajarata from Anuradhapura, and his consort Mahamatta. As such he must have witnessed the most dramatic event of Tissa's reign, the invasion of Rajarata by the Chola king Karikalan http://encyclopedia.vestigatio.com/Sri_Lankan_Army The Mahavamsa mentions Gajabahu's accession and reign of twenty-two years, and mentions neither Karikalan's invasion, nor the military campaigns to south India that Gajabahu became famous for. Instead he is presented as a great patron of religion; the chronicle credits him with the construction of two viharas - Matuvihara and Rumika - and a stupa called Abhayuttara. He is also credited with making a mantle for Dutugemunu's Mirisavetiya, and for building a reservoir to provide the Abhayagiri monastery with food. He also made improvements to the four entranceways of the Abhayagiri stupa. Gajabahu is also credited with the introduction of the cult of the goddess Pattini to Sri Lanka. The Silapathikaram mentions Gajabahu's presence at the consecration of a temple to Kannagi (identified as Pattini in this case) by the Chera king Senguvuttan. Returning from India he brought back not only the begging bowl of the Buddha but Pattini's sacred anklet, and constructed a temple to the goddess 'at a place called Vattapalli near Mullaitivu'. However, there is an alternative view that the cult actually arrived in Sri Lanka in the 13th century, and the legend of Gajabahu's patronage was retrospectively created to generate legitimacy for the goddess The annual Perahara held in Kandy is also thought to have its roots in Gajabahu's reign. Following the successful completion of a campaign into Chola territories the temple of Vishnu in Anuradhapura is said to have staged a procession in thanks, which eventually developed into today's festival. Gajabahu was succeeded by his father-in-law Mahallaka Naga.  Guest In contrast the mentions of Gajabahu in the Tamil sources represent a much more cordial visit by the Sri Lankan king. The Silapathikaram mentions him twice. On the first occasion he is with the Chera king Senguvuttan, offering sacrifices to the goddess Kannagi in an introductory passage. Later he is in the Chera king's company again, and on very good terms. It has been suggested that this mention does not necessarily preclude a military campaign; after all it is entirely possible that Gajabahu and Senguvuttan offered joint sacrifices as a way of securing a freshly concluded peace. On the other hand, the versions presented in the Mahavamsa and Silapathikaram do not mention any violence at all, despite being the major sources for this period. Furthermore, the reliability of the entires in the Silapathikaram has been questioned, and it has been suggested that the meeting between Gajabahu and Senguvttan is the result of a certain amounth of 'poetic licence' on the part of the compiler Significance Sources notwithstanding, Gajabahu is regarded in modern Sri Lanka as an archetype of the mighty Sinhalese monarch. The Sri Lanka Army has an infantry regiment, Gajaba Regiment, named after the warrior king, and the Sri Lanka Navy had named a ship named after the king, the SLNS Gajabahu. To students of south Indian history his reign is important as it provides the 'Gajabahu syncretism' which is used to date many rulers of the ancient Chola and Chera. It is also possible to argue that Cheran Senkuttuvan's father Cheran Kutako Nedum Cheral Athan and uncle Cholan Karikal Valavan jointly attacked the northern part of Lanka from Vedaranyam in Tamil Nadu, India and in the process Cheran Nedum Cheral Athan managed to cut down the protector tree of Sinhaleese king of the time, which has the name 'Kadampu' as stated in Sangam literature (Pathittupathu 2.10). The Sinhaleese king (probably the father of Gajabahu) was ruling from Anuradhapura, which was washed by the River Kadamba, the present Malwatu Oya. The protector tree was replanted by the mother of Gajabahu in their palace garden. Probably there was a truce between Gajabahu and the Cheras and the hostages were exchanged as a mark of friendship. If this was not the case Gajabahu would not have visited Cheran Senkuttuvan, for a ceremony highly objected to by the Pandian King, since Pandian kingdom was an immediate neighbour of Gajabahu's kingdom. Trade There have been a series of archaeological excavations in recent years at the ancient port Godavaya (= Godawaya, Gothapabbata), situated around a huge rock overlooking the Indian Ocean, close to the gem mining area of the Lower Sitracala Wewa and the inland shipping route of the Walawe Ganga. The archaeologists have found that Godavaya's was an important stop on the maritime Silk Route, in the early centuries of the Common era with excavations and research revealing connections from China to the Red Sea and the Mediterranean.Kessler (1998): 31-34 A stone inscription in Brahmi, dating to Gajabahu I's reign, orders that part of the customs collections at the Godavaya Port at Ambalanthota be donated to the nearby Godapawath Temple.Bopearachchi (1996), p. 64.http://sundaytimes.lk/020414/plus/2.html There have been three inscriptions and some 75,000 late Roman coins found in earthen vessels in the region.Ray (2003), p. 202.

She was the only non-Soviet bloc female swimmer to win an individual gold medal at the 1980 games. She also set two world records in her career, and was the first Australian woman to win individual Olympic medals in two distinct specialized strokes. Ford, the second of four children grew up in the seaside Sydney suburb of Sans Souci, familiar with water, as her father Ian, a dentist, had narrowly missed Olympic selection as a yachtsman. After learning to swim at the age of 6, she made national headlines when she swam the 100-yard freestyle in 61.5 seconds, at the age of 12, the fastest time ever set by a swimmer at such an age. In January 1976, at the New South Wales Age Championships, at the North Sydney pool, she broke six state and three national records at the age of 13, two of which had previously been held by triple Olympic gold medalist Shane Gould. She proceeded to compete at the Australian Championships, where she won the 200-meter butterfly, despite standing only 140 centimeters, setting another national and Commonwealth record in the process. Another strong performance in the 200-meter freestyle lead to selection for both events for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. After a seven-week national training camp, she competed in her first Olympic race in the 200-meter freestyle, where her competition included the eventual champion, Kornelia Ender of East Germany. After the Olympics, Ford scaled her training back in order to catch up on her studies at St George Girls High School. On the advice of her coach Dick Caine, she began to concentrate on distance freestyle swimming, and in 1977 set an Australian record in the 400-meter freestyle at the New South Wales Age Championships, before setting another national record at the Australian Championships in the 800-meter freestyle, as well as winning the 200-meter freestyle. The following year in 1978, at the KB international meet in Brisbane, she broke the 800-meter freestyle record of East Germany's Petra Thumer by 0.18 of a second, setting a new time of 8:35.04, lowering her own national record by 10 seconds. She also set another Australian and Commonwealth record in the 200-meter butterfly. A fortnight later, Ford lowered her record to 8:31.30. At the 1978 Commonwealth Games in Edmonton, Ford won gold in the 200-meter butterfly, silver in the 400-meters and 800-meter freestyle, bronze in the 200-meter freestyle and 4x100-meter freestyle relay. In 1979, Ford missed the Australian Championships in order to concentrate on her final year of high school. At the Soviet Spartakiad Games later in the year, she won three golds in the 200-meter butterfly and 400- and 800-meter freestyle. She then moved to Nashville, Tennessee, in the United States, to train and compete under Don Talbot on the American domestic circuit. Ford won the 800- and the 1500-meter freestyle, and was second in the 200- and 400-meter freestyle at the 1980 Australian Championships to gain selection for the 1980 Moscow Olympics. Under public pressure from the Government of Australia, particularly Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who as the patron of the Australian Olympic Committee to boycott the Games in protest of the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Ford chose to attend the games, competing in the 200-metre butterfly and the 400- and 800-metre freestyle. In the 200-metre butterfly, she qualified fastest, ahead of East Germany's Andrea Pollack and Ines Geissler. In the final the East Germans turned the tables, with Geissler and Sybille Schonrock leading Ford home into the bronze medal position. She qualified third fastest in the 400-meter freestyle, but the strategy undertaken by the East German trio coaxed her into deviating from her pre-race plan. She finished fourth. Later, in her final event, the 800 m freestyle, Ford had qualified behind another East German, Ines Diers. Ford made a slow start, lying in seventh at the 100-meter mark before snatching the lead from Diers at the 200-meter mark and extending it to a 3.65-second victory winning Olympic gold medal and claiming the Olympic Record. After returning to Australia, Ford attempted to break the 16-minute barrier in the 1500-meter freestyle, but was thwarted, firstly by a timing failure, then by New South Wales who did not want her to make her second attempt in Queensland, and finally disqualification on her third attempt for incorrectly withdrawing from a previous race. Frustrated, she retired from swimming in 1981. In 1981, Ford attended the University of Wollongong until taking up a scholarship at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles where she completed a bachelors in Business communication and a Masters in sports Psychology. Ford was one of 30 athletes to be invited by president Samaranch to the Olympic Congress in Baden Baden and became one of the inaugural members of the IOC Athletes Commission. In 1982 Commonwealth Games she won the 200-meters butterfly for the second time and silver in the 800-meters freestyle.

It is loosely based on the 20th Century Fox's 1992 film of the same name. Featuring arcade-style gameplay but closely following the rules seen in street basketball as with the film, players compete with either CPU- controlled opponents or against other players in matches across various locations set in Los Angeles. Plans for an adaptation of the movie in video game form began in 1993, when a licensing agreement between 20th Century Fox and Trimark Interactive took place, with the latter obtaining the rights to the movie after the deal was realized. White Men Can't Jump became the first title on the Jaguar in featuring support for the Team Tap adapter, which was bundled along with the game, allowing more than two players to participate in tandem. White Men Can't Jump received mixed to negative reception from reviewers since its release, with criticism geared towards the poor graphics, sound department and controls, though its multiplayer feature was complimented by critics. In recent years, it has been hailed as one of the worst games of all time by some critics.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. White Men Can't Jump is a two-on-two street basketball game similar to Barkley Shut Up and Jam! and Jammit, where players take control of either of the fourteen teams available, each one composed of two basketball players for a total of twenty- eight playable characters to choose from in a series of matches on outdoor courts across different locations taking place in the Los Angeles area, with the exception of Inglewood Forum, which takes place on an indoor court and only available in Tournament mode.White Men Can't Jump game manual (Atari Jaguar, US) Though similar to NBA Jam in terms of gameplay and controls, the game provides a faster and more aggressive pace, as it contains less basketball play regulations and never penalizes any player, emulating the looser and rougher nature of urban basketball. The court locations do not have any effect during gameplay, but each of the playable characters has a unique set of status skills, encouraging players to figure out which character fits their play style the best. During gameplay, players can pass, fake a pass, jump, shoot, dunk, and punch to try knocking down an opponent. Players can use a turbo ability by using extra energy and the more energy a player has, the more likely they are to pull off a \\"Super Dunk\\" at a distance from the basket. Each character can pull off a variety of \\"Super Dunks\\". Players can also switch between both characters on their team when using an AI teammate. = Modes = White Men Can't Jump only offers two different modes of play: Versus and Tournament. Versus is a pick-up and play mode where up to four players can take part in individual two-on-two street basketball games, with remaining players being controlled by AI. Tournament mode can be played by 1 or 2 players (on the same team), where each players start out with $500 and bet money on each game against CPU-controlled opponents and once players earn $5,000, they are entered into the Slam City Tournament but if the players fails to earn $5,000 amount over 30 games or loses all money, the game is over, thought players can resume their progress by using \\"Keys\\" to return into the last game saved.  Development and release  Plans for a video game adaptation of White Men Can't Jump were announced in August 1993, after an licensing agreement between 20th Century Fox and Trimark Interactive, which was a newly formed subsidiary by Trimark as one of their first releases across all platforms. Scott Corley, main programmer and one of the designers of Ruiner Pinball at High Voltage Software, recounted about the development process of the title for the Atari Jaguar in a thread at the 3DO Zone forums. He stated that High Voltage Software locally hired members from the acrobatic Jesse White Tumbling Team crew, who performed all of the moves seen in-game for the characters, which were filmed at a gym without the aid of blue screen, while the frames were then cut out and digitized by using Deluxe Paint. He also stated that the work also served as a learning exercise for their future projects involving motion capture, in addition of being a positive experience for the company. Scott also remarked that Adisak Pochanayon, who would later become the lead programmer of NBA Jam: Tournament Edition for the Jaguar, did most of the programming for the project and created the three-dimensional basketball courts through perspective correction, similar to Doom. White Men Can't Jump was first showcased to the public in an early playable state during SCES '94, featuring a mostly different artwork compared to the final release but it only supported two players for versus matches, and was advertized in EGM2 for a Q1 1995 release. It was later showcased in a more advanced state during WCES '95 and Spring ECTS '95, now featuring support for up to four players and slated for an April 1995 release. The game made its last trade show appearance at E3 1995. It was also covered by the magazine press that were invited to Atari Corp.'s US and UK divisions.  Reception  White Men Can't Jump received mostly mixed reviews. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly panned the game, citing the confusing camera perspective, poor animation, blocky graphics, and ineffective control. GamePro commented that \\"Poor control, bad graphics, and annoying sound make Atari's White Men Can't Jump the worst basketball experience since watching the Clippers.\\" They particularly criticized that controls often fail to respond and shots tend to miss the hoop even when shot in the correct direction from right next to the basket. A critic for Next Generation dissented with the majority opinion; while he said that the game occasionally suffers from erratic camera movements and requires multiple players to get full enjoyment out of it, he generally applauded White Men Can't Jump for its intense violence, \\"swooping\\" camera angles, sprite scaling, street-style audio commentary, and generally solid balance.

Melbourne, The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd. is a town in Greater Hume Shire Council in New South Wales, Australia. It is about north of Albury-Wodonga and south of Wagga Wagga. Walla Walla had a population of 581 people in 2006 and has the largest Lutheran church in New South Wales. Walla Walla has an elevation of above sea level. In summer Walla Walla has an average high of and a low of , and during winter it has a high of and a low of , although maximum temperatures can reach the mid-40s ¬∞C (mid-110s ¬∞F) and the area often experiences frosts during winter. Until 2016 it was the home of the Walla Walla Football Club which played as a stand alone team in the Hume Football League until having to merge with Rand & Walbundrie due to lack of players. Walla Walla has many other sports available such as tennis, lawn bowls, croquet, cricket and a local swimming pool. Walla Walla is also the home of St Paul's College, the only Lutheran secondary school in NSW. The school offers an equine program, with many students keeping horses in the adjacent equine centre, as well as agricultural studies. Boarding students are drawn from communities within the Greater Hume Shire, the Riverina, North Eastern Victoria and further afield from the cities of Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne. History The Walla Walla area was home to the Wiradjuri aboriginals who inhabited this area for many thousands of years prior to European settlement. The explorers Hume and Hovell passed through the area in late 1824 noting its potential for grazing livestock. Squatters first arrived in 1834 and four stations, including \\"Round Hill\\" and \\"Walla Walla\\" were established by 1845. During the 1860s the bushranger Dan \\"Mad Dog\\" Morgan frequented the area holding up the Round Hill Station at nearby Morven. He also established a lookout at a granite outcrop 6 km north of Walla Walla adjacent to the Walla Walla Station and Billabong Creek. Walla Walla was established in 1869 when 56 settlers of German extraction moved from their home in the Barossa Valley of South Australia in the search for farming land. At that time South Australian farmland was in short supply and the New South Wales government was releasing tracts of fertile land at relatively cheap prices.Spennemann, Dirk H.R. (2008). Echoes from the Past: Tracing the German Experience through Selected objects from the Jindera Pioneer Museum. Albury, NSW: Charles Sturt Institute for Land, Water and Society. In all, 56 people made the trek in 14 covered wagons and 2 spring carts, leaving their hometown of Ebenezer in October 1868. This group was led by Father Klemke and it comprised the families of Michael Wenke, Andreas Mickan and Andreas Lieschke; as well as two Klemke families, the Fischer, Terlich and Hennersdorf families and two single men in Ferdinand Schmidt and Wilhelm Luhrs. Ethnically, most of these families belonged to a minority group known as Wends or Sorbs and some had only recently emigrated from the North Eastern German States. Although these settlers first named the township Ebenezer after their hometown in South Australia, its name was changed to Walla Walla (Aboriginal for \\"place of many rocks\\") because another township with the same name existed in New South Wales. This was neither the first nor the last trek by German South Australians to the Riverina with other settlements established nearby at Jindera, Bethel, Gerogery, Wallendool (Alma Park), Dudal-Cooma (Pleasant Hills), Mangoplah, Edgehill and Henty. Walla Walla Post Office opened on 1 February 1878. The Walla Walla Hotel was opened in the early 20th century by Mr Fredrick Voss, the original publican. At the turn of the twentieth century, Walla Walla was charactered by its close-knit community which contributed to its preservation of the German language and the old ways.Pennay, B. (2006). An Australian Berlin and hotbed of disloyalty: shaming Germans in a country district during two world wars. Royal Australian Historical Society. Although the First World War fostered a sense of nationalism (albeit strongly allied to the British Empire) this period was a challenging time for the Walla Walla community due to its ethnicity and the political issues of conscription and disenfranchisement from the electoral roll. According to one view, Walla Walla was reported as 'Berlin' and a 'hotbed of disloyalty'.Albury Daily News, 16 January 1917. In all, four local residents, including two Justices of the Peace and members of the Culcairn Shire Council were interned in the Holsworthy Concentration Camp. Tellingly, the honour board at the Walla Walla Soldiers Memorial Hall describes the war as one against 'Prussian Militarism' rather than Germany. With the outbreak of the Second World War, tensions evident during the First World War did not take long to resurface. This time the attention of the authorities was directed toward the Lutheran pastors in the region, rather than its civic leaders. This was the case because conscription was no longer the issue that it had been in the First World War and some Lutheran pastors had shown pro-German sympathies with the resurgence of Germany. These pastors (including Pastor JTP Stolz from Walla Walla) were questioned and their activities were monitored. Schooling The first school at Walla Walla was a congregational school and it was established in 1873. Instruction was conducted in the German language. This school operated from the original Zion Church building until 1883 when a mudbrick schoolhouse was opened. Two years later, in 1885, this school was leased to the NSW Department of Public Instruction and responsibility for educating the local children passed to the State. German-speaking classes continued to be conducted but only for several afternoons a week and then only until the outbreak of the First World War.Wegener, L. (2002). Never in Vain: A history of St Paul‚Äôs College. Walla Walla: St Paul‚Äôs College In the 1930s the desire of the local community for Christian secondary education led to the establishment of St Paul‚Äôs College. Mr Werner Hebart, the founding headmaster, was previously a senior master at The Friend's School, Hobart (Tasmania). St Paul‚Äôs commenced in 1948 with 28 foundation students, including thirteen boarders who resided with local families. St Paul‚Äôs moved onto its current premises, from its temporary location in Zion church in 1950. Local heritage attractions The German heritage of Walla Walla is a feature of the town and it is most obvious with street names such as Scholz Street, Jacob Wenke Circuit, Klemke Avenue and Hermann Street. Less obviously, this cultural aspect of the town is also seen through the Lutheran influence by way of Zion Lutheran Church and St Paul's College. An account of the journey of the original German settlers, together with artefacts of their journey (including some of the original wagons) is on display in the Jindera Pioneer Museum. A replica wagon and a display is also located in the grounds of Zion Lutheran Church and many early headstones in the local cemetery have German inscriptions. Walla Walla‚Äôs heritage items were identified by a community survey to include Morgans Lookoutt, Zion Lutheran Church and the Walla Walla Swamp (Gum Swamp). Morgans Lookout Morgans Lookout is a white granite outcrop located next to Billabong Creek, which is the longest creek in the Southern hemisphere. Due to its elevation, this local geological feature was used by the bushranger Dan \\"Mad Dog\\" Morgan as a lookout for police parties. Local folklore tells of Morgan hiding his horses in deep crevices within the rocks when the police came nearby. Morgans Lookout was also used as a lookout for fires in the late 1800s, a concern that was heightened by the fear of arson due to an industrial dispute between graziers and shearers. Zion Lutheran Church The original Lutheran church was built from white granite in 1872. The present Zion Lutheran Church was built in 1924 and it is the largest Lutheran Church in New South Wales, with seating for almost 600 people. The church is characterised by its stained glass windows and its massive pipe organ. Nearby, the schoolhouse built in 1883 by the Zion congregation is still extant. Gum Swamp Gum Swamp is a nationally important wetland area and it covers 458 hectares. This area is home to Aboriginal heritage sites, local flora and fauna, including at least 128 species of birdlife.

They are created using various minerals to pigment plant material, which is then meticulously arranged by several people to form a picture of a historic event. Overview The creation of a ground painting is a very social event. The picture itself depicts some specific historic ancestor, glorified to be a hero or monster. The ancestor is nearly always some kind of natural element, whether an animal or force of nature. Since the pictures are innately tied to specific locations with specific ancestors, it very much ties the creators to each other and to the land, reinforcing the group identity. The creation of the ground painting and the accompanying dance is a performance tradition, analogous to oral tradition. = Art = The pigments used traditionally come from the natural resources: lime for white, ochre for yellow, clay for red, coal for black. With the introduction of a market economy, it is not uncommon to use acrylic paint for a ground painting. The emphasis is not on the materials or the form, but the meaning behind the picture as well as the accompanying performance. Nearly always, the participants paint on themselves as well. The use of certain patterns to symbolize glowing, glittering power are usually limited to crosshatching and dots. In much of Oceanic art, these patterns symbolize an extra power. They are commonly seen on deity figures, the genitalia and thighs of women giving birth, and mythical creatures.  Plagiarism of Oceanic art  Dreamtime and dreaming are common translations of a concept common in Oceanic culture that does not easily translate across cultures. Oceanic inhabitants tend to think of time as happening in two distinct forms: normal time and dreamtime. Normal time is linear, and is used for day-to-day activities. Dreamtime is a kind of surreal time that exists outside of ordinary time; all times and no time at all simultaneously. This kind of surrealism common to Oceania gained many admirers, notably Picasso and his peers in the Surrealist movement. However, many images from Oceanic art are copied directly from authentic Oceanic pieces and heralded as art. This plagiarism, as well as the commonly accepted but incorrect association between dreamtime and sleeping, has become a point of much controversy and anger from native Oceanic inhabitants.

In cladistic terms, it is the total group of Coleoidea. In contrast, the palcephalopoda are defined as the sister group to the neocephalopoda. Taxonomic history The name Neocephalopoda was first published (in Lehmann & Hillmer, 1980) as an Infraclass, which (in a reversal of the usual Linnean hierarchy) included the Subclasses Bactritoidea, Ammonoidea, and Coleoidea. Neocephalopoda was a new name for a group that had been recognized previously and called Angusteradulata (Lehmann, 1967), based on a discovery of an ammonoid radula similar to modern coleoids. It was contrasted with the Lateradulata, which included the nautilus and most fossil nautiloids. These names were applied by later workers running cladistic analyses on the cephalopods. Berthold & Engeser (1987) adopted the name Angusteradulata for the clade comprising ammonoids and coleoids. Later, Engeser (1996) included not only the coleoids, ammonoids, and bactritids, but also some orthocerid families: Michelinoceratidae, Sphaerorthoceratidae, Arionoceratidae, \\"and probably other groups as well.\\" Although the name Angusteradulata appeared earlier than Neocephalopoda, both names were coined by Lehmann, who preferred the latter. Engeser and Lehmann later both agreed that Neocephalopoda was a more suitable name than Angusteraduata. Features of the neocephalopods The following characters are thought to be shared, at least ancestrally, by neocephalopods. Most are from Engeser (1996) or from his Fossil Nautiloidea page. * The embryonic shell is small (about 1.5 to 3 mm), somewhat spherical, and separated from the rest of the shell by a constriction. This may reflect an r-selected strategy of producing a large number of small offspring, as seen in most modern coleoids, rather than the K-selected strategy of the nautilus. * The protoconch, or initial chamber, lacks a cicatrix, a scar left by the original organic plate during the embryonic development of the nautilus and its fossil relatives. * The radula is more similar to coleoids, with 9 elements per row, than to the nautilus, with 13 elements per row. Ammonoids have been found with coleoid-like radulas, as have orthoconic nautiloids dating back to the Ordovician Period (Gabbott, 1999). Classification Although there is wide agreement that bactritids included the ancestors of ammonoids and coleoids, and hence that all three groups belong in one clade, the relations among some neocephalopods remain problematic. The greatest obstacles may lie among the nautiloids: * The classification of orthocerids is still jumbled and requires revision based on features of the embryonic shell. * Since cephalopod fossils from the Cambrian and Early Ordovician Periods are rare and usually incomplete, we do not know the ancestral states of many characters, making it difficult to assess which derived characters unite the neocephalopods and which other nautiloid groups belong among them. Nevertheless, recent descriptions of shells with preserved apical ends have aided in the classification of major taxa. For instance, ascocerids and pseudorthocerids have a cicatrix and so do not belong among the neocephalopods. Conversely, true orthocerids and lituitids lack a cicatrix and have a round protoconch, which suggest neocephalopod affinities. In contrast, some workers have suggested that crown cephalopods did not evolve until approximately the Silurian Period. If that is correct, then all early Paleozoic cephalopods must be stem cephalopods and not neocephalopods. References Cited References *Berthold, Thomas, & Engeser, Theo. 1987.

Life Some details of his early life remain obscure. He was born into a Creole of Color family of Spanish, French and African descent. One of his ancestors was an officer of the free black regiment which fought in the Battle of New Orleans. At the turn of the century, Perez became a member of the Onward Brass Band, leading it from 1903 to 1930. He also started his own brass band, called the Imperial Orchestra, which operated from 1901‚Äì1908. The Onward Brass Band was one of the most respected of its day. Some of the best-known players in New Orleans were a part of the group, including King Oliver, Peter Bocage, Henry Kimball, Lorenzo Tio, Luis Tio, George Baquet, Isidore Barbarin, and Benny Williams. The Perez and Oliver two cornet, or \\"trumpet\\" team, was one of the most renowned in New Orleans. Perez was known for his beautiful tone, staying close to the lead, while Oliver improvised variations as a second cornet part. Later, Perez went north to Chicago in 1915, playing with Charles Elgar's Creole Orchestra at the Arsonia Cafe and also with the Arthur Sims Band. Although Elgar and his Creole Orchestra recorded a few sides (albums) during this period, Perez is not heard on any of these early recordings. Returning to the Crescent City in the 1920s, he played in the District (Storyville), on steamboat excursions with Fate Marable, and in parades with the Maple Leaf Orchestra. Perez suffered a stroke in 1930. During this period, he worked with his brother, who owned a moving company, while he ran the used furniture store. Sidney Bechet said of him in the early 1940s: > I was down in New Orleans and I saw Manuel before he died. I saw him and I > couldn't bear to see him; it was something awful. He just began to slobber > at the mouth when you spoke to him...And when he looked at you there wasn't > anything in his eyes ‚Ä¶ it was like they were missing from his face, and his > face, it had just come apart. Perez had suffered a series of strokes that left him disabled and caused his death in 1946. Style and legacy Louis Armstrong stated \\"Manuel and Joe King Oliver played together in the Onward Brass Band, really something to listen to when they played for parades and funerals. They had twelve musicians in their brass band. Eddie Jackson used to really swing the tuba when the band played marches. They sounded like a forty piece brass swing band.\\" Armstrong would follow the brass band in the second line, as he listened to those early musicians whom he idolized in his youth. In contrast to Buddy Bolden and his more improvisational free approach, Perez was a sight-reader and highly technical musician, some say he refined the play of Bolden and allowed for more of an orchestral (big band) style. Sidney Bechet comments \\"Manuel Perez was one. He was a musicianer; he was sincere. He stuck to his instrument.\\" In the terminology of early 20th century New Orleans musicians, a \\"musicianer\\" was someone with good technical ability on their instrument adept at sight- reading written music. Manuel Perez was an innovator, with a supreme sound. His legacy might be best understood, in looking at the musicians that praised him, and the styles he influenced. King Oliver went on to become the jazz impresario of Chicago. Sidney Bechet toured the world featuring some of the same sounds Perez himself had played while battling other bands on the neutral ground of Claiborne Avenue, and sitting solitary on the banks of the Mississippi River.

Early life Originally from Deland, Florida, Johnson moved to Boston, Massachusetts, in the early 1970s. Career Johnson was a member of The Johnson Brothers (not to be confused with The Brothers Johnson from Los Angeles, California) and the seminal electro group known as the Jonzun Crew with brothers Michael Jonzun and Soni Jonzun.

Starr intended New Kids on the Block to be a white version of New Edition; he stated \\"I honestly believe that if they'd been white, [New Edition] would have been 20 times as big.\\" By 1989, New Kids On The Block was the fastest-rising act in the United States. Starr handled the group‚Äôs lucrative marketing of posters, T-shirts, and other spin-offs. Starr later attempted to repeat his success with artists such as Perfect Gentlemen, Rick Wes, Homework, the Superiors, Heart Body & Soul, Classic Example, Tommy Page and Ana. None of these groups attained anything like the massive popularity of New Edition and New Kids on the Block. =Most recent work= Starr manages NK5, another boy band he assembled.

The village is centred on the A28 Ashford to Hastings road, south- west of Tenterden. The settlement of Rolvenden Layne, south of Rolvenden, is also part of the parish and shares in its shops and amenities. History The village of Rolvenden dates from Saxon times. The name 'Rolvenden' may originate from a chieftain Hropwulf, and would refer to the 'den or pasture of Hropwulf's people'. Den is the jutish word for swine pastures coming to connote the same but with associated hamlets or isolated farmsteads as well as in many instances cultivated land. Rolvenden is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Rovindene\\". In the reign of Edward III this was changed to Riolvinden, and then changed again to Rounden in the late 17th century. Rolvenden village originally had its sole population centre as a short linear settlement, the Street, along part of what is now the A28 Ashford to Hastings road. This was almost entirely burned down in 1665 during the Great Plague (except for the church and pub). This caused the villagers to abandon the Street and move a mile down the hill to the common land of the Layne during the 1660s. Already there was the Tudor house, where John Wesley later preached in the 18th century. The villagers later returned to rebuild the Street, resulting in the two small neighbourhoods: the Streyte and the younger, smaller and quieter Layne that can be seen today. The population declined between 1830 and 1850, when many people left during and after the Swing Riots. This was caused by the public vestry system of Rolvenden parish making the conscious decision to provide the poor with a single payment for assisted passages to the colonies, as opposed to large ongoing payments for parish relief. Rolvenden parish is now approximately ten square miles in area, consisting largely of farming and rural activities, with an increasing number of professional, craft and tourist services. Rolvenden is in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Landmarks The parish church was commissioned and supervised by monks from Canterbury in around 1220, has remained largely unchanged since 1480 and is dedicated to St Mary the Virgin. The 14th-century font has the arms of the Culpeper family on it, before their later prominence in the early administration of British North America. The war memorial in the churchyard was designed by Edwin Lutyens. An oddity of the church is the Squire's pew, a room upstairs furnished with a table and Chippendale chairs, built for the Gibbons family from Hole Park for separately looking down on the main congregation. The motor museum in Rolvenden Lady Jane Grey, who was the first queen regnant (a queen ruling in her own right rather than through being married to a king) of England for nine days in 1554, until her cousin Queen Mary seized power before she could be crowned (and later had her beheaded), lived at nearby Halden Place. The Reverend John Frankesh of Rolvenden became one of the Kent Marian Martyrs when he was burned at the stake in Canterbury on 12 July 1555 - he is named among the 41 martyrs inscribed on the Martyrs' Memorial, near Wincheap Street, Canterbury and in Foxe's Book of Martyrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett rented Great Maytham Hall, down from the higher land towards Rolvenden Layne, in 1898 and a blocked-up door in the old walled garden inspired her to write the well known children's novel \\"The Secret Garden\\". After her departure in 1907 the mansion was rebuilt in 1910 by Edwin Lutyens for the Rt Hon H.J. Tennant. The estate dates from Saxon times and at least four Norman lords had manors here. The Lutyens hall has since been divided into apartments and is used a retirement home. The gardens are open to the public through the National Gardens Scheme from April to October. The grade II listed Rolvenden War Memorial, erected in 1922, was designed by Lutyens at Tennant's instigation. Hole Park on the Benenden Road opens its gardens to the public under the National Gardens Scheme. Edward Gibbon lived there and wrote a bestseller, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, which was published between 1776 and 1788. Rolvenden Windmill is also on the Benenden Road. This restored post mill, first mentioned c.1580 and of a type now rare in Kent, is now probably the best surviving example in the county. Its restoration was carried out in 1956 as a memorial to John Nicholas Barham who, according to the inscription, 'lived his short life within sight of it' and died in August 1955, just before his eighteenth birthday. The mill, which is privately owned and does not open to the public, stands on a little hill and was featured in the Tommy Steele film Half a Sixpence. Economy, shops and amenities Korker Sausages started as small butchers in October 1954, now produces over 15 tonnes of sausages a week.Korker Sausages Website The Kent and East Sussex Railway has its workshops near Rolvenden station. A collection of historic vehicles is housed on Rolvenden High Street in an antiques outlet. It specializes in Morgan three-wheeler motor cars with other vintage cars, motorcycles, bicycles, displays of toy and model cars. There is a small shop situated in the heart of the village. There are two public houses, The Bull Inn which also serves as a restaurant and The Star. There is another public house in Rolvenden Layne called The Ewe and Lamb. Rolvenden has its own village hall which is available to hire. Transport The Kent and East Sussex Railway is on the parish eastern border. The A28 between Canterbury and Hastings forms the main high street of Rolvenden. Other roads are either single track country lanes of small subsidiary roads. A bus service from Hastings to Ashford runs through the village.

Description The characteristics of this species vary according to the season in which the eggs are laid. = Wet-season brood = The male has chalky-white wings with the apical half of the forewing and terminal margin of the hindwing broadly black. There is a broad, rich, orange patch obliquely across the black area extended to the upper apex of the forewing. At the lower apex this orange patch is very broad and leaves only the tip of the wing black along with a comparatively narrow band along the edge. The base of the wing is covered with black scales. The underside of the wing is a rich sulphur-yellow as in other species of the genus, and is covered with reddish brown, short, transverse striations and minute dots. The forewing has an orange patch on the upperside which can be plainly seen because of the transparency on the wing, a broadly triangular area below this cell white, large and prominent discocellular spots with a white centre. Both forewings and hindwings have a discal transverse series of reddish-brown spots, more or less conspicuous, the spots always centred with white. In other species in the genus these is characteristic of the dry-season broods. On the forewing the patch above the tornus is prominent and in some specimens very large. The antennae are reddish brown and the head and thorax anteriorly are covered with reddish-brown hairs. The upperside of the thorax is grey with white hairs and the abdomen is black. The underside of the head, thorax and abdomen are white. Dry-season brood, male at Hodal in Faridabad district of Haryana, India The female is similar with the upper forewing having the orange patch on the black apical area narrower, posteriorly truncate and not extending so far down. There is also an outer transverse series of four black spots on the orange parch in interspaces 2 to 5. The underside is similar to that of the male but the markings are slightly larger. The antennae, head, thorax and abdomen are also similar. = Dry-season brood = In both sexes this differs less from the wet-season form than it does in Ixias pyrene and Ixias verna. The characteristic dry-season markings on the underside are more visible, on some occasions very much more pronounced. The wingspan in both sexes is 54‚Äì56 mm.

Film adaptation The novel was adapted for the 1987 film Cobra Verde, directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski as Francisco Manuel da Silva. Reception The novel received mixed reviews. In The New York Times, John Thompson compared The Viceroy to other about-Africa prose works: > \\"One could mention Graham Greene's Journey Without Maps or, for a work of > the imagination based on somewhat less horrendous events, Chinua Achebe's > Arrow of God. That novel of West Africa has violence enough, and cruel > superstition too, yet it is suffused with the common humanity of which I > find not one dried drop in The Viceroy of Ouidah.\\"John Thompson, \\"The Hero > Was A Slaver,\\" The New York Times, 19 March 1980. Years later, in a 1999 review of Nicholas Shakespeare's biography of Chatwin, The Guardian described the Viceroy novel as \\"a rococo piece of candyfloss.\\"\\"Yarn Spinner,\\" The Guardian, 10 April 1999.

Biography Cefal√π was born in Palermo, Sicily, in 1947. After moving to the United States, Cefal√π got involved in organized crime and started smuggling heroin for the Gambino crime family. In 1982, he was convicted of heroin smuggling and served six years in prison. In 1990, Gambino boss John Gotti inducted Cefal√π as a made man, or full member, into the Gambino family.\\"It's A Mob Scene Parade of Mafia Bigs Ends Jail Stints in '09\\" by Murray Weiss and Chuck Bennett (March 9, 2009) New York Post Cefal√π was a member of the Sicilian \\"Zip\\" crew headed by captain Pasquale Conte and operated in Queens and Brooklyn. In 1992, a New York grand jury summoned Cefal√π to testify in an investigation of Conte. After answering a few questions, Cefal√π refused to testify. The judge sentenced Cefal√π to 18 months in jail for civil contempt. On February 23, 1993, Cefal√π was summoned to testify in Conte's trial, but again refused. On February 6, 1994, Cefal√π was released from jail. However, on February 6, 1994, Cefal√π was indicted on criminal contempt for refusing to testify at Conte's trial. In 1996, convicted of criminal contempt, the court sentenced Cefal√π to 33 months in prison.Appellee-Cross-Appellant v.

On February 7, 2008, Cefal√π was indicted on multiple charges of racketeering conspiracy and extortion as part of the Operation Old Bridge investigation of the Gambino family. The extortion charges came from the trucking industry, which hauls away dirt excavated from construction projects.\\"Accused Gambino Leaders Indicted in Sweep\\" NY Times NY Region August 2, 2008 Cefal√π accepted a plea agreement from the prosecution in exchange for a guilty plea that could have resulted in his spending up to three years in prison.\\"Gambino\\" Gangsters Inc. Cefal√π was sentenced to two years in prison. On November 3, 2009, Cefal√π was released from federal prison. In July 2011, Cefal√π became the official boss of the Gambino crime family. His ascension was seen as a return to the old-fashioned way of running a Mafia family. He replaced Peter Gotti, who had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2002 while a series of acting bosses and ruling panels was used to run the family. This also marked the end of the John Gotti era of the Gambino family. During his reign he largely stayed off the radar of law enforcement and the press. In 2015, underboss Frank Cali was promoted to be the acting boss of the Gambino family. Due to his age, it is unknown if Cefal√π still holds complete control of the family, if he's stepped down partially or if he's completely retired. After Cali's death in 2019, Lorenzo Mannino has stepped up to control the family.

The lyrics go beyond specific criticism to the individuals directly involved in those cases to condemning societal indifference and callousness in general, having lyrics about how \\"lawyers are bought\\" and the \\"presses have run\\". Taylor later remarked, \\"I don't like the idea of me just pointing the finger. In the song 'Baby Doe,' I was just as much to blame as the parents, because I wasn't doing anything about it.\\" \\"We Don't Need No Colour Code\\" challenged and ridiculed the racial policies of Bob Jones University, among other institutions. In its style, Taylor intentionally used musical references to African-American musician Bo Diddley. More recently, Taylor has explained that he finds joy in the song given the success of anti-racist efforts worldwide over the years. \\"Guilty By Association\\" condemns evangelists that abuse Christian teachings and just seek fame and money for themselves. \\"Over My Dead Body\\" called for more attention to be given to international violations of human rights.

They later moved to London, UK. Three of the members went on to form DragonForce. Their rather unusual musical style has often been labeled as \\"blackened power metal\\". Biography The group began playing black metal with Dawson and Totman adopting the stage names \\"Behemoth\\" and \\"Heimdall\\" as well as the genre's defining trappings and symbolism such as corpse paint. The following year the band was joined by The Magus on keyboards and drummer Mark Hamill from the avant-garde rock band Head Like a Hole. This line-up produced the band's first album Prepare for War, after which Magus left Demoniac and was replaced on keyboards by MC Magnus, reportedly The Magus's brother Demoniac's next album was 1996's Stormblade that featured a slightly more melodic and catchier black metal style as well as controversial tracks like \\"Hatred is Purity\\" and \\"Niggerslut\\". During a 2014 interview with Noisey, Totman was asked to explain what appeared to be a White Power and homophobic slant to some of Demoniac's lyrics on songs such as these. Totman said that none of the songs were serious and were written ironically, and that the members were just \\"having a laugh\\". Following Stormblade the band signed to French label Osmose Productions and toured throughout western Europe on the World Domination Tour with Dark Tranquillity, Enslaved and several other bands. At this point Dawson and Totman decided to remain in England and Hamill departed the line-up. During July 1998 Hong Kong-born guitarist Herman Li joined Demoniac and in October drummer Matej Setinc was recruited. The band began developing a high-speed melodic power metal style, dispensing with the black metal trappings and ideologies. In January 1999 Demoniac headed into the studio with Cradle of Filth producer Mags to record The Fire and the Wind. The original cover featured a black and white photograph of one of the band members drinking while having sex and pointing the middle finger, but it was subsequently banned; the final release artwork was heavily censored, although depicted the same image. While Dawson had played bass on all the band's recordings, the decision was made to then hire a bass player to allow him extra freedom during live performance. Diccon Harper, formerly of South African death metal band Voice of Destruction then joined Demoniac. Before the end of the year, however, Demoniac had come to an end. All members except Dawson formed DragonHeart, which later became known as DragonForce. In 2012, the band re-released Prepare For War, with new cover art and an additional track, Throne of Fire. Dawson was the only original member to play on this track, however, as the instruments were provided by New Zealand black metal band Bulletbelt, who feature Demoniac's original drummer, Steve Francis. Dawson later appeared as a guest in the 2006 album Inhuman Rampage by DragonForce. Steve Francis, the original drummer also appeared as a guest on backing vocals in the 2019 album Extreme Power Metal.

Preparation  This drink is typically made from nurungji, the roasted (but not charred) crust of rice that forms on the bottom of a pot after cooking rice. Water is poured on this brown crust and the contents are put to a simmer until the water gains enough flavor of the scorched rice. Nurungji at Encyclopedia of Korean Culture History Records of sungnyung can be found in the late Joseon era documents of Imwon Gyeongjeji (ÏûÑÏõêÍ≤ΩÏ†úÏßÄ) and also in the 12th-century Chinese Song Dynasty's Gyerim yusa, which supports the theory that sungnyung has been eaten since the Goryeo period. Rice in Korea was traditionally made by using a heavy iron cauldron (like a Dutch oven), with the rice being cooked until all water had been boiled away and a crust made on the bottom of the pot. Sungnyung at Doosan Encyclopedia Making sungnyung would not only prevent waste of the remaining rice that was sticking to the pot, it would also naturally clear out the pot's insides which made cleaning easier. As sungnyung was made after rice had been served, it was typically served after the meal. The consumption of sungnyung waned as nickel-silver pots and modern electric rice cookers gained popularity, as they do not generally leave a layer of roasted crust after the rice is steamed. However, in the late 20th century sungnyung began to gain popularity again and many electric rice cookers now come with the ability to cook sungnyung. Making nurungji, MK Business News, 2005-07-15.

Key among these \\"basic features\\", as expounded by Justice Khanna, are the fundamental rights guaranteed to individuals by the constitution. The doctrine thus forms the basis of the power of the Supreme Court of India to review and strike down constitutional amendments and acts enacted by the Parliament which conflict with or seek to alter this \\"basic structure\\" of the Constitution. The basic features of the Constitution have not been explicitly defined by the Judiciary, and the claim of any particular feature of the Constitution to be a \\"basic\\" feature is determined by the Court in each case that comes before it. The Apex Court's initial position on constitutional amendments was that any part of the Constitution was amendable and that the Parliament might, by passing a Constitution Amendment Act in compliance with the requirements of article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and article 368. That the Constitution has \\"basic features\\" was first theorised in 1964, by Justice J.R. Mudholkar in his dissent, in the case of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan. He wondered whether the ambit of Article 368 included the power to alter a basic feature or rewrite a part of the Constitution. He wrote, In 1967, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier decisions in Golaknath v. State of Punjab. It held that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a \\"transcendental position\\" and are beyond the reach of Parliament. It also declared any amendment that \\"takes away or abridges\\" a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III as unconstitutional. In 1973, the basic structure doctrine was formally introduced with rigorous legal reasoning in Justice Hans Raj Khanna's decisive judgment in the landmark decision of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala. Previously, the Supreme Court had held that the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution was unfettered. However, in this landmark ruling, the Court adjudicated that while Parliament has \\"wide\\" powers, it did not have the power to destroy or emasculate the basic elements or fundamental features of the constitution. Although Kesavananda was decided by a narrow margin of 7-6, the basic structure doctrine, as propounded in Justice Khanna's judgement, has since gained widespread legal and scholarly acceptance due to a number of subsequent cases and judgments relying heavily upon it to strike down Parliamentary amendments that were held to be violative of the basic structure and therefore unconstitutional. Primary among these was the imposition of a state of emergency by Indira Gandhi in 1975, and her subsequent attempt to suppress her prosecution through the 39th Amendment. When the Kesavananda case was decided, the underlying apprehension of the majority bench that elected representatives could not be trusted to act responsibly was perceived as unprecedented. However, the passage of the 39th Amendment by the Indian National Congress' majority in central and state legislatures, proved that in fact such apprehension was well-grounded. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain and Minerva Mills v. Union of India, Constitution Benches of the Supreme Court used the basic structure doctrine to strike down the 39th Amendment and parts of the 42nd Amendment respectively, and paved the way for restoration of Indian democracy. The Supreme Court's position on constitutional amendments laid out in its judgements is that Parliament can amend the Constitution but cannot destroy its \\"basic structure\\". Definition That the Constitution has \\"basic features\\" was first theorised in 1964, by Justice J.R. Mudholkar in his dissent, in the case of Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan. He wrote, Supreme Court, through the decisive judgement of Justice H. R. Khanna in Keshavananda Bharti v. State of Kerala (1973) case, declared that the basic structure/features of the constitution is resting on the basic foundation of the constitution. The basic foundation of the constitution is the dignity and the freedom of its citizens which is of supreme importance and can not be destroyed by any legislation of the parliament. The basic features of the Constitution have not been explicitly defined by the Judiciary. At least, 20 features have been described as \\"basic\\" or \\"essential\\" by the Courts in numerous cases, and have been incorporated in the basic structure. Only Judiciary decides the basic features of the Constitution. In Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Naraian and also in the Minerva Mills case, it was observed that the claim of any particular feature of the Constitution to be a \\"basic\\" feature would be determined by the Court in each case that comes before it. Some of the features of the Constitution termed as \\"basic\\" are listed below: #Supremacy of the Constitution #Rule of law #The principle of Separation of Powers #The objectives specified in the Preamble to the Constitution of India #Judicial Review #Articles 32 and 226 #Federalism (including financial liberty of states under Articles 282 and 293) #Secularism #The Sovereign, Democratic, Republican structure #Freedom and dignity of the individual #Unity and integrity of the Nation #The principle of equality, not every feature of equality, but the quintessence of equal justice; #The \\"essence\\" of other Fundamental Rights in Part III #The concept of social and economic justice ‚Äî to build a Welfare State: Part IV in toto #The balance between Fundamental Rights and Directive Principles #The Parliamentary system of government #The principle of free and fair elections #Limitations upon the amending power conferred by Article 368 #Independence of the Judiciary #Effective access to justice #Powers of the Supreme Court under Articles 32, 136, 141, 142 #Legislation seeking to nullify the awards made in exercise of the judicial power of the State by Arbitration Tribunals constituted under an Act # Background The Supreme Court's initial position on constitutional amendments was that no part of the Constitution was unamendable and that the Parliament might, by passing a Constitution Amendment Act in compliance with the requirements of article 368, amend any provision of the Constitution, including the Fundamental Rights and article 368. In Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India (AIR. 1951 SC 458), the Supreme Court unanimously held, \\"The terms of article 368 are perfectly general and empower Parliament to amend the Constitution without any exception whatever. In the context of article 13, ‚Äúlaw‚Äù must be taken to mean rules or regulations made in exercise of ordinary legislative power and not amendments to the Constitution made in exercise of constituent power, with the result that article 13 (2) does not affect amendments made under article 368. In Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (case citation: 1965 AIR 845, 1965 SCR (1) 933), by a majority of 3-2, the Supreme Court held, \\"When article 368 confers on Parliament the right to amend the Constitution, the power in question can be exercised over all the provisions of the Constitution. It would be unreasonable to hold that the word \\"Law\\" in article 13 (2) takes in Constitution Amendment Acts passed under article 368.\\" In both cases, the power to amend the rights had been upheld on the basis of Article 368. =Golaknath case= In 1967, the Supreme Court reversed its earlier decisions in Golaknath v. State of Punjab. A bench of eleven judges (the largest ever at the time) of the Supreme Court deliberated as to whether any part of the Fundamental Rights provisions of the constitution could be revoked or limited by amendment of the constitution. The Supreme Court delivered its ruling, by a majority of 6-5 on 27 February 1967. The Court held that an amendment of the Constitution is a legislative process, and that an amendment under article 368 is \\"law\\" within the meaning of article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment \\"takes away or abridges\\" a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. Article 13(2) reads, \\"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of contravention, be void.\\" The Court also ruled that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a \\"transcendental position\\" under the Constitution and are kept beyond the reach of Parliament. The Court also held that the scheme of the Constitution and the nature of the freedoms it granted incapacitated Parliament from modifying, restricting or impairing Fundamental Freedoms in Part III. Parliament passed the 24th Amendment in 1971 to abrogate the Supreme Court ruling in the Golaknath case. It amended the Constitution to provide expressly that Parliament has the power to amend any part of the Constitution including the provisions relating to Fundamental Rights. This was done by amending articles 13 and 368 to exclude amendments made under article 368, from article 13's prohibition of any law abridging or taking away any of the Fundamental Rights. Chief Justice Koka Subba Rao writing for the majority held that: *A law to amend the constitution is a law for the purposes of Article 13. *Article 13 prevents the passing of laws which \\"take away or abridge\\" the Fundamental Rights provisions. *Article 368 does not contain a power to amend the constitution but only a procedure. *The power to amend comes from the normal legislative power of Parliament. *Therefore, amendments which \\"take away or abridge\\" the Fundamental Rights provisions cannot be passed. Kesavananda Bharati case (1973) Six years later in 1973, the largest ever Constitution Bench of 13 Judges, heard arguments in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala (case citation: AIR 1973 SC 1461). The Supreme Court reviewed the decision in Golaknath v. State of Punjab, and considered the validity of the 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th Amendments. The Court held, by a margin of 7-6, that although no part of the constitution, including fundamental rights, was beyond the amending power of Parliament (thus overruling the 1967 case), the \\"basic structure of the Constitution could not be abrogated even by a constitutional amendment\\". The decision of the Judges is complex, consisting of multiple opinions taking up one complete volume in the law reporter \\"Supreme Court Cases\\". The findings included the following: *All of the Judges held that the 24th, 25th and 29th Amendments Acts are valid. *Ten judges held that Golak Nath's case was wrongly decided and that an amendment to the Constitution was not a \\"law\\" for the purposes of Article 13. *Seven judges held that the power of amendment is plenary and can be used to amend all the articles of the constitution (including the Fundamental Rights). *Seven judges held (six judges dissenting on this point) that \\"the power to amend does not include the power to alter the basic structure of the Constitution so as to change its identity\\". *Seven judges held (two judges dissenting, one leaving this point open) that \\"there are no inherent or implied limitations on the power of amendment under Article 368\\". Nine judges (including two dissentients) signed a statement of summary for the judgment that reads: # Golak Nath's case is over-ruled. # Article 368 does not enable Parliament to alter the basic structure or framework of the Constitution. # The Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. # Section 2(a) and 2(b) of the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. # The first part of section 3 of the Constitution (Twenty-fifth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. The second part namely \\"and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy\\" is invalid. # The Constitution (Twenty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1971 is valid. The ruling thus established the principle that the basic structure cannot be amended on the grounds that a power to amend is not a power to destroy. =Defining the basic structure= The majority had differing opinions on what the \\"basic structure\\" of the Constitution comprised Chief Justice Sarv Mittra Sikri, writing for the majority, indicated that the basic structure consists of the following: * The supremacy of the constitution. * A republican and democratic system. * The secular character of the Constitution. * Maintenance of the separation of powers. * The federal character of the Constitution. Justices Shelat and Grover in their opinion added three features to the Chief Justice's list: * The mandate to build a welfare state contained in the Directive Principles of State Policy. * Maintenance of the unity and integrity of India. * The sovereignty of the country. Justices Hegde and Mukherjea, in their opinion, provided a separate and shorter list: * The sovereignty of India. * The democratic character of the polity. * The unity of the country. * Essential features of individual freedoms. * The mandate to build a welfare state. Justice Jaganmohan Reddy preferred to look at the preamble, stating that the basic features of the constitution were laid out by that part of the document, and thus could be represented by: * A sovereign democratic republic. * The provision of social, economic and political justice. * Liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. * Equality of status and opportunity. The Emergency (1975) The Court reaffirmed and applied the basic structure doctrine in Indira Nehru Gandhi v. Raj Narain, popularly known as Election case. The constitutionality of Article 329A, which had been inserted by the 39th Amendment in 1975 was challenged in this case. Shortly after the imposition of the Emergency, a bench of thirteen judges was hastily assembled to hear the case. Presided over by Chief Justice Ajit Nath Ray, the court had to determine the degree to which amendments were restricted by the basic structure theory. Ray, who was among the dissenters in the Kesavananda Bharati case, had been promoted to Chief Justice of India on 26 April 1973, superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde (all in the majority in the same case), which was unprecedented in Indian legal history. On November 10 and 11, the team of civil libertarian barristers, led by Nanabhoy Palkhivala, argued against the Union government's application for reconsideration of the Kesavananda decision. Some of the judges accepted his argument on the very first day, the others on the next; by the end of the second day, the Chief Justice was reduced to a minority of one. On the morning of 12 November, Chief Justice Ray tersely pronounced that the bench was dissolved, and the judges rose. The 39th Amendment attempted, among other provisions, to legitimize the election of Indira Gandhi in 1971. Article 329A put the elections of the Prime Minister and Lok Sabha Speaker outside the purview of the judiciary and provided for determination of disputes concerning their elections by an authority to be set up by a Parliamentary law. The Supreme Court struck down clauses (4) and (5) of the article 329A, which made the existing election law inapplicable to the Prime Minister's and Speaker's election, and declared the pending proceedings in respect of such elections null and void. Development Constitutional lawyer A. G. Noorani notes that the doctrine has \\"now spread far and wide beyond its frontiers.\\", but that the eventual attribution to Dietrich Conrad is absent, who propounded the arguments in a lecture to the law faculty in the Banaras Hindu University. The argument, Noorani narrates made way to M K Nambyar who read the excerpt out in Golaknath. The note is that in Kesavananda Bharati the dissenting judge, Justic Khanna approved as \\"substantially correct\\" the following observations by Prof. Conrad: Evolution of the doctrine The basic structure doctrine was further clarified in Minerva Mills v. Union of India. The 42nd Amendment had been enacted by the government of Indira Gandhi in response to the Kesavananda Bharati judgment in an effort to reduce the power of the judicial review of constitutional amendments by the Supreme Court. In the Minerva Mills case, Nanabhoy Palkhivala successfully moved the Supreme Court to declare sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd Amendment as unconstitutional. The constitutionality of sections 4 and 55 of the 42nd Amendment were challenged in this case, when Charan Singh was caretaker Prime Minister. Section 4 of the 42nd Amendment, had amended Article 31C of the Constitution to accord precedence to the Directive Principles of State Policy articulated in Part IV of the Constitution over the Fundamental Rights of individuals articulated in Part III. Section 55 prevented any constitutional amendment from being \\"called in question in any Court on any ground\\". It also declared that there would be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend by way of definition, variation or repeal the provisions of the Constitution. On 31 July 1980, when Indira Gandhi was back in power, the Supreme Court declared sections 4 & 55 of the 42nd amendment as unconstitutional. It further endorsed and evolved the basic structure doctrine of the Constitution. As had been previously held through the basic structure doctrine in the Kesavananda case, the Court ruled that Parliament could not by amending the constitution convert limited power into an unlimited power (as it had purported to do by the 42nd amendment). In the judgement on section 55, Chief Justice Yeshwant Vishnu Chandrachud wrote, The ruling was widely welcomed in India, and Gandhi did not challenge the verdict. In the judgement on Section 4, Chandrachud wrote: This latter view of Article 31C was questioned, but not overturned, in Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing Co v Bharat Cooking Coal Ltd. (case citation: AIR 1983 SC 239). The concept of basic structure has since been developed by the Supreme Court in subsequent cases, such as Waman Rao v. Union of India (AIR 1981 SC 271), Bhim Singhji v. Union of India (AIR 1981 SC 234), S.P. Gupta v. President of India (AIR 1982 SC 149) (known as Transfer of Judges case), S.P. Sampath Kumar v. Union of India (AIR 1987 SC 386), P. Sambamurthy v. State of Andhra Pradesh (AIR 1987 SC 663), Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu and others (1992 1 SCC 309), L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India and others (AIR 1997 SC 1125), P. V. Narsimha Rao v. State (CBI/SPE) (AIR 1998 SC 2120), I.R. Coelho v. State of Tamil Nadu and others (2007 2 SCC 1), and Raja Ram Pal v. The Hon‚Äôble Speaker, Lok Sabha and others (JT 2007 (2) SC 1) (known as Cash for Query case). The Supreme Court's position on constitutional amendments laid out in its judgements is that Parliament can amend the Constitution but cannot destroy its \\"basic structure\\". Influence The influence extends to Commonwealth Countries sharing the judicial system with India. =Bangladesh= The basic structure doctrine was adopted by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh in 1989, by expressly relying on the reasoning in the Kesavananda case, in its ruling on Anwar Hossain Chowdhary v. Bangladesh (41 DLR 1989 App. Div. 165, 1989 BLD (Spl.) 1). =Malaysia= In Malaysia, the basic features doctrine was initially found to be inapplicable by the Federal Court in Phang Chin Hock v. Public Prosecutor.[1980] 1 M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 70. The Court remarked that the Indian Constitution was drafted by a constituent assembly and not \\"ordinary mortals\\", while the same could not be said for the Malaysian Constitution.Phang Chin Hock, p. 73. The Indian Constitution was drafted by a constituent assembly representative of the Indian people in territorial, racial and community terms,. while both the Malaysian and Singapore Constitutions were enacted by ordinary legislatures. The basic structure doctrine was first cited with approval by the Federal Court in obiter dicta in Sivarasa Rasiah v. Badan Peguam Malaysia,[2010] 2 M.L.J. 333. before ultimately being applied by the same court in Semenyih Jaya Sdn Bhd v. Pentadbir Tanah Daerah Hulu Langat & Ano'r Case [2017] 3 M.L.J. 561. and Indira Gandhi a/p Mutho v. Pengarah Jabatan Agama Islam Perak & 2 O'rs & 2 Other Cases.Federal Court, 29 January 2018. In those cases, the Federal Court held that the vesting of the judicial power of the Federation in the civil courts formed part of the basic structure of the Constitution, and could not be removed even by constitutional amendment. =Singapore= The High Court of Singapore denied the application of the basic features doctrine in Singapore in Teo Soh Lung v. Minister for Home Affairs. Justice Frederick Arthur Chua held that the doctrine was not applicable to the Singapore Constitution: \\"Considering the differences in the making of the Indian and our Constitution, it cannot be said that our Parliament's power to amend our Constitution is limited in the same way as the Indian Parliament's power to amend the Indian Constitution.\\"Teo Soh Lung (H.C.), p. 479, para. 47. = Uganda = In December 2017, the Ugandan parliament passed a Constitutional Amendment which removed age limit of 75 years for the President and Chairpersons of the Local Council. The President Yoweri Museveni, who has been President of Uganda since 1986, signed the amendment into law in January 2018, aged '74 years' (Evidence is available that the dictator is in his late 80's). Several opposition leaders and the Uganda Law Society, challenged the constitutionality of the amendment before the Constitutional Court, which (majority) upheld the validity of the amendment. Taking note of the judgments in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, AIR 1973 SC and Minerva Mills v. Union of India, AIR 1980 SC 1789, the Supreme Court of Uganda in Mabirizi Kiwanuka & ors. v. Attorney General, [2019] UGSC 6, unanimously upheld the Constitutional Court (majority) finding. See also *Judicial activism in India *Teo Soh Lung v.

It supports directory hierarchies and applications that depend on multiple libraries. It is used in conjunction with native build environments such as Make, Qt Creator, Ninja, Apple's Xcode, and Microsoft Visual Studio. It has minimal dependencies, requiring only a C++ compiler on its own build system. Features CMake can handle in-place and out-of-place builds, enabling several builds from the same source tree, and cross-compilation. The ability to build a directory tree outside the source tree is a key feature, ensuring that if a build directory is removed, the source files remain unaffected. CMake can locate executables, files, and libraries. These locations are stored in a cache, which can then be tailored before generating the target build files. The cache can be edited with a graphical editor, which is included in the project. Complicated directory hierarchies and applications that rely on several libraries are well supported by CMake. For instance, CMake is able to accommodate a project that has multiple toolkits, or libraries that each have multiple directories. In addition, CMake can work with projects that require executables to be created before generating code to be compiled for the final application. Its open-source, extensible design allows CMake to be adapted as necessary for specific projects. CMake can generate project files for several prominent IDEs, such as Microsoft Visual Studio, Xcode, and Eclipse CDT. It can also produce build scripts for MSBuild or NMake on Windows; Unix Make on Unix-like platforms such as Linux, macOS, and Cygwin; and Ninja on both Windows and Unix-like platforms. Build process The build process with CMake takes place in two stages. First, standard build files are created from configuration files. Then the platform's native build tools are used for the actual building. Each build project contains a CMakeLists.txt file, in every (sub)directory, that controls the build process. The CMakeLists.txt file has one or more commands in the form COMMAND (args...), with COMMAND representing the name of each command and args the list of arguments, each separated by whitespace. While there are many built-in rules for compiling the software libraries (static and dynamic) and executables, there are also provisions for custom build rules. Some build dependencies can be determined automatically. Advanced users can also create and incorporate additional makefile generators to support their specific compiler and OS needs. Internals The executable programs CMake, CPack, and CTest are written in the C++ programming language. Much of CMake's functionality is implemented in modules that are written in the CMake language. Since release 3.0, CMake's documentation uses reStructuredText markup. HTML pages and man pages are generated by the Sphinx documentation generator. History CMake development began in 1999 in response to the need for a cross-platform build environment for the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit. The project is funded by the United States National Library of Medicine as part of the Visible Human Project. It was partially inspired by pcmaker, which was made by Ken Martin and other developers to support the Visualization Toolkit (VTK). At Kitware, Bill Hoffman blended components of pcmaker with his own ideas, striving to mimic the functionality of Unix configure scripts. CMake was first implemented in 2000 and further developed in 2001. Continued development and improvements were fueled by the incorporation of CMake into developers‚Äô own systems, including the VXL Project, the CABLE features added by Brad King, and GE Corporate R&D; for support of DART. Additional features were created when VTK transitioned to CMake for its build environment and for supporting ParaView. Version 3.0 was released in June 2014.https://cmake.org/pipermail/cmake/2014-June/057793.html It has been described as the beginning of \\"Modern CMake\\".https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1#file- effective_modern_cmake-md Experts now advise to avoid variables in favor of targets and properties.https://github.com/boostcon/cppnow_presentations_2017/blob/master/05-19-2017_friday/effective_cmakedaniel_pfeifercppnow_05-19-2017.pdf, https://gist.github.com/mbinna/c61dbb39bca0e4fb7d1f73b0d66a4fd1 The commands add_compile_options, include_directories, link_directories, link_libraries that were at the core of CMake 2 should now be replaced by target-specific commands.

There are subspecies that differ, such as H. g. vossi where the white is replaced by pure yellow. =Wet-season brood= Wet season female form (H. g. glaucippe), at Tripura, India. In the males the upperside is creamy white. Forewing: the costa narrowly, the apex and terminal margin to middle of interspace 1 are black. An irregular, somewhat sinuous, black band extends obliquely from beyond the middle of the costa across the upper apex of the cell, and meets at interspace 1 the black on the terminal margin. Within the triangle thus formed is enclosed a rich orange-red patch that is traversed by the black veins and bears in interspaces 3 to 6 a postdiscal series of black inwardly elongated spots. Hindwing: nearly uniform, touched with black on the terminal margin anteriorly and with a conspicuous postdiscal black spot in interspace 7. In some specimens there are one or two smaller spots in continuation of the series in the interspaces below. H. g. glaucippe, underside The underside is white. The apical third of the forewing and the whole of the hindwing are mottled, with more or less prominent brown stripe and spots. Costa of the forewing and a fine line that runs from base of the hindwing through the cell, straight to the middle of the terminal margin, are brown. Antennae are dark brown. The head and thorax have anteriorly a reddish-brown pile. Thorax above is greyish blue, while the abdomen is white with a bluish tinge. Beneath: head and thorax are more or less brownish, abdomen is white. Female is similar to the male. Upperside: ground colour with a slight greenish tinge. The orange patch on the forewing is more restricted, it consists of a series of brood streaks in interspaces 3 to 6 and 10, the outer apices of which are deeply incised by black and with a row of hastate orange spots beyond in interspaces 2 to 6. Hindwing: similar to the hindwing in the male, but with a postdiscal series of large triangular black spots and a terminal connected series of still larger triangular black spots at the apices of veins 2 to 7. Underside: similar to that in the male, the brown transverse strigae and spots are more numerous, the costa of the fore and the median line on the hindwing are very prominently brown. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in the male. =Dry-season brood= Differ only from the wet- season brood in the slightly more falcate apex to forewing, and in the purer white ground colour on the upperside. Also the terminal margin on the hindwing in the male has the black markings all but obsolete, while in the female the postdiscal and terminal black markings on the same are smaller than in the wet-season form. Underside: the mottlings of brown strigae and minute spots are more numerous and dense. Race australis, Butler (Southern India and Sri Lanka). Males and females. Differs only from the typical form in the following particulars: Inner black border to the orange patch on the upperside of the forewing is absent, this represented by a few obsolete touches of black scaling. Hindwing: white throughout, with only a half-obliterated subcostal black spot in interspace 7 in the male; in the female the postdiscal and terminal series of spots are smaller. Toxicity In the wings of Hebomoia glaucippe is present glacontryphan-M, a peptide toxin belonging to the family contryphan that are active constituents of the poisonous venom produced by cone snail (genus Conus). In H. glaucippe this toxin should function as a defence against predators.Narkhyun Bae, Lin Lia, Martin L√∂dlb, and Gert Lubeca - Peptide toxin glacontryphan-M is present in the wings of the butterfly Hebomoia glaucippe (Linnaeus, 1758) (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) Edited by Jerrold Meinwald, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY The life cycle =The eggs= The eggs are laid on the larval food plants Crataeva religiosa, Capparis moonii, Capparis roxburghii, Capparis cantoniensis and Capparis sepiaria (Capparaceae). =Larvae= \\"Subcylindrical, tapering towards each end, numerously-covered with minute tubercles; green.\\" (Moore) Subcylindrical; suddenly tapered at both ends; covered with transverse rows of pointed tubercles.

His reign saw the expansion of Later Three Kingdoms powers Taebong and Hubaekje across what had once been the western marches of Unified Silla. During his reign, the situation of Silla was that Gung Ye and Gyeon Hwon, who took place in the provinces, were fighting for supremacy. In 905, Silla lost its holdings to the northeast of Jungnyeong pass. In 907, Gyeon Hwon's Hubaekje forces seized ten castles to the south of Ilseon. Faced with these defeats, the king turned to drink and neglected state affairs. Upon his death in 912, he was buried to the north of Sajasa temple.

The shut down lasted for two weeks from 1 May 2006 through 14 May 2006, leaving nearly 100,000 public employees without pay and closing more than 1,500 public schools. The crisis was publicly criticized by the business sector, non-profit organizations, Puerto Rican celebrities, and the general public (by means of opinion polls), and was described as the consequence of a political power struggle between the Commonwealth's main opposing political parties: the Popular Democratic Party and the New Progressive Party. Crisis In April 2006, Governor Anibal Acevedo Vil√° (PPD) announced that the central government of Puerto Rico did not have enough cash flows to pay projected operating expenses for the months of May and June, including the salaries of thousands of public employees. The governor asked the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico to approve an emergency loan of over US$500 million so that the government would use to continue to run, which then the government would repay using 1% of a newly proposed sales tax, or else the Governor would order a partial shutdown of central government operations, including the closing of numerous agencies. The Puerto Rico Government Development Bank offered to supply the loan, but insisted on a tax reform plan that requires this new tax to be collected with a predetermined rate or amount be set aside exclusively for the loan repayment. The NPP-majority Senate approved the loan based on the proposed tax rate, but the NPP-majority House of Representatives refused to do so. In a televised address on 27 April, Governor Acevedo Vil√° announced that most of the government agencies would be shut down beginning 1 May, and would remain closed unless the House approved the economic plan. Government activities relating to health and security (including hospitals and police stations) would remain open, although medical professionals questioned whether hospitals would function if staff went unpaid and also raised the issue of government-funded prescriptions, whilst private security firms on contract to the government said they might cease work if the government did not pay what it owes them. Senate President Kenneth McClintock said that the shutdown was unnecessary since the government had enough funds to continue paying public workers until the first week of June and that under no circumstance should public schools be shut down. NPP President Pedro Rossell√≥ said he did not think Governor Acevedo Vil√° would shut down the government and accused him of trying to create \\"uneasiness\\" and \\"intimidate the Legislature\\". A public demonstration against the shutdown, named the Puerto Rico Shouts march, attracted thousands of people on 28 April. (archived from the original on 1 May 2006) Later on, labor leaders called for a general strike if the shutdown occurred. In a referendum held on 10 July 2005, Puerto Rican voters overwhelmingly approved the change to a unicameral legislature by 456,267 votes in favor versus 88,720 against, although three-quarters of voters chose to abstain. This change would become effective in January 2009 if an additional referendum were held to specifically amend the Puerto Rican Constitution and tailor it to the new legislative body, which is highly unlikely since the House defeated a Senate-passed proposed constitutional amendment. Government shutdown On 1 May 2006, with the House of Representatives, the Senate, and the Governor having failed to reach an agreement, 45 government agencies, including island public schools, closed and 15 others were partially closed, leaving 95,762 people temporarily unemployed. The only agencies remaining open are security related, such as police and firefighter agencies, and health related agencies. 1,600 public schools were shut down, leaving 500,000 pupils without facilities. On 2 May the shut down continued. The New Progressive Party held a meeting and decided to stick with the 5.5% tax proposal, stating that there wouldn't be any type of negotiation. Another meeting between the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Governor ended in dispute with the Governor leaving less than 15 minutes after the meeting started. Protests were held also in front of the main offices of Popular, Inc. in Hato Rey and the Capitol. On 3 May, Governor Acevedo Vil√° accepted an invitation by Jos√© Aponte, Speaker of the House, to meet with him alone in the Capitol. Acevedo Vil√° suggested to Aponte that Senator Kenneth McClintock, President of the Senate, should be present. Aponte didn't agree. Acevedo Vil√° arrived to the Capitol in company of Alfredo Salazar, the President of the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank, Juan Carlos M√©ndez, Secretary of Treasury, and An√≠bal Jos√© Torres, Secretary of Government. Aponte, as agreed, asked Acevedo Vil√° to meet alone with him. Fifteen minutes after the meeting Acevedo Vil√° left abruptly. According to Acevedo Vil√°, Aponte began to complain at some point during the meeting, specifically mentioning that a few days earlier, the Secretary of Treasury changed the financial numbers given under oath in a public hearing, and that the Secretary was absent in a meeting one week earlier, making it difficult for the House to reach him. At some point during the meeting, Acevedo Vil√° noticed a smiling face in Aponte and commented that he was happy to see him smile during such time of crisis. At this point, versions differ. Allegedly, Aponte told Acevedo Vil√° that he has \\"seen the face of distress\\" of Acevedo Vil√° in recent days, and that if he needed a handkerchief for his tears, he could let him know. At that point Acevedo Vil√° left, feeling that \\"it was an insult to the Puerto Rican people left in the streets\\". Aponte denied this, and accused the Governor of lying. On 4 May, Acevedo Vil√° marched from La Fortaleza, the Governor's house, to the Capitol. It was the first time in Puerto Rican history that such an event has happened. In Puerto Rican custom, the Governor walks from the Capitol to La Fortaleza when he takes the oath of office. Acevedo Vil√° was criticized due to the similarities between this march and an episode of the TV series The West Wing, in which the President of the United States (portrayed by Martin Sheen) walks from the White House, home of the President, to the U.S. Capitol, home of the U.S. Congress, in order to resolve a federal budget crisis. On 8 May, Moody's downgraded Puerto Rico's general obligation debt to Baa3 from Baa2, and appropriation bonds to junk status at Ba1 from Baa3. Settlement On 4 May, the first signs of compromise emerged as the Senate approved a new budget-balancing package which proposed a 5.9% sales tax and a corporation tax to be placed only on corporations with earnings of more than ten million dollars. This deal was still not approved by the House. An emergency commission was formed on 8 May under the Archbishop of San Juan, which negotiated with the Governor, the Legislature and the banks. It reported on 10 May and brokered a deal which was accepted in the early hours of the following morning. Under the deal, the legislature will approve the emergency loan to finance Puerto Rico's $740 million shortfall. Having won approval by the Legislature, the Governor signed the budget-balancing package into law on 13 May, officially ending the shutdown. The Legislature has since approved a sales and use tax, with a portion set aside for repaying the loan. The NPP leadership insisted on a maximum combined sales tax of 5.5% (4% state and 1.5% municipal), but the NPP team working on the proposed legislation botched the document and placed wording in it that made the state sales tax 5.5%, for a total of 7%. The Senate immediately recognized the error and placed the bill for immediate approval. Once it was approved, it was revealed that no Senators from the Rossell√≥ faction of the NPP had read the bill, and they had approved with their votes exactly what Governor Acevedo Vil√° wanted. The House then attempted to block the bill from reaching the Governor for his signature, but the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ordered the Speaker to complete the process. Just prior to the beginning of the sales tax enactment on 15 November, former Governor Carlos Romero Barcel√≥ filed a lawsuit attempting to derail the initiation of the tax, but that too failed to gain any traction in the Courts, and businesses began collecting the new tax on 15 November.

Lyrically, the album explores actions that exploit others to various ends from multiple perspectives. CCM magazine found that the overall theme is that the ends never justify the means. It was released as a one-off on Myrrh Records instead of Sparrow. Taylor has said that the album's title was meant as a parody of a Lester Sumrall TV program and book, I Predict 1986. Background The cover was designed and painted by Taylor's wife, Debi. It was intended to resemble early 20th-century French poster art; however some Christians felt that it resembled a tarot card, which sparked controversy. Additionally, one televangelist claimed that the image was of Taylor saluting Satan, and that it additionally contained secret messages and links to New Age philosophy. These accusations caused some Christian book stores to pull the album. Per the album's credits, all songs were written by Steve Taylor, except \\"Babylon\\" by Taylor and Dave Perkins. The ending theme to \\"Jim Morrison's Grave\\" was \\"borrowed\\" from Claude Debussy; and the introduction to \\"Harder to Believe\\" was \\"stolen\\" from Sergei Rachmaninoff. The song \\"I Blew Up the Clinic Real Good\\" proved controversial; The song's lyrics - a scathing critique of anti-abortion activists who in turn blow up abortion clinics or kill doctors - resulted in Christian bookstores pulling the album, either because the song's critique of the pro-life movement offended store owners and customers, or because these same individuals missed the song's satirical point, and believed Taylor advocated such violence. Taylor himself would occasionally call these stores to personally explain the song to them.Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music; Powell; p931; Hendrickson Publishers; paperback edition (August 2002) Taylor's tour of Australia was canceled due to the controversy around \\"I Blew Up The Clinic Real Good\\", largely due to misunderstanding of its satire. Disillusioned with the Christian music scene following these and other controversies during the course of his career, Taylor formed the secular alternative rock band Chagall Guevara shortly after the release of the album.

She was also Silla's third and last reigning queen after Seondeok and Jindeok. Her reign saw the end of Unified Silla and the beginning of the Later Three Kingdoms period. Life Jinseong was the daughter of King Gyeongmun and Queen Munui. The younger sister of Heongang and Jeonggang, she rose to the throne when both of her brothers died without issue. Though Seondeok and Jindeok's successful reigns were invoked to help Jinseong secure the throne, Silla's third queen regnant ultimately did not live up to the expectations of her predecessors. =Reign= Jinseong is noted in the Samguk Sagi for her immoral and licentious conduct, ranging from taking bribes to bringing attractive men into the palace and committing lewd acts with them. She also carried on an affair with the high commander (Gakgan) Wihong. The Samguk Sagi was written by Confucianists, who held a negative view of female rule, so the precise details therein should perhaps not be taken at face value. In contrast, according to the records of Choe Chiwon, she was a good-hearted monarch with no greed. During her reign, public order collapsed. Taxes could no longer be collected and the military conscription system failed. Taking advantage of this domestic disarray, Yang Gil in the northwest and Gyeon Hwon in the southwest rebelled and founded their own kingdoms. In 895, Jinseong appointed Heongang's illegitimate son Kim Yo as Crown Prince. On July 4, 897, she abdicated the throne and later died on December 31, 897. She was buried to the north of Sajasa temple in Gyeongju. Legacy She ordered the first compilation of hyangga works, Samdaemok, to be created.

Purpose Many implementations of init (including Sysvinit used in many Linux distributions) start processes in a pre-determined order, and only start a process once the previous process finishes its initialization. Initng starts a process as soon as all of its dependencies are met. It can start several processes in parallel. Initng is designed to significantly increase the speed of booting a Unix-compatible system by starting processes asynchronously. Initng's supporters claim that it also gives the user more statistics and control over the system. Development Despite being still considered beta, it was chosen as the default init system for Pingwinek, Enlisy, Berry Linux and Bee. Also there are packages for many distributions such as Ubuntu and Fedora, as well as ebuilds for Gentoo and spells for Source Mage. Contrary to other similar projects, it features a portable and flexible code base, more suited for embedded usage, and has been already ported to other operating systems like Haiku and FreeBSD.

The costa on the forewing is black and thickly overlaid with greyish or pinkish scales; a black spot at apex of cell, which may be large and quadrate or smaller and lunate; termen broadly black, with an enclosed double transverse series of spots of the ground colour the inner series consists of a large spot in interspace 1, two very small spots in interspaces 2 and 3, one in each, and four larger anterior spots placed in a curve; the spots in the outer series are variable in number, but generally there is one in each interspace, these are more or less linear in shape. Hindwing: a band on costal margin extended to just within the upper margin of the cell, covered with dense black specialized scales; this black band joined onto a broad similarly- coloured terminal band of ordinary scales, that becomes more or less diffuse and powdery posteriorly, and encloses a double series of small spots of the ground colour the inner series often obsolescent, in some specimens entirely absent; dorsum heavily irrorated with fuscous scales, the irroration extended onto the disc, which has therefore generally a greyish appearance. Ventral view Underside: greenish yellow; an anteciliary fine black line on both forewing and hindwings; the black markings of the upperside show through by transparency. Forewing: a black spot, variable in size and intensity, in some specimens absent altogether, at apex of cell; a subterminal quadrate black spot in interspace 1 and another (sometimes faintly marked or absent) further outwards in interspace 2; disc faintly, dorsal margin broadly very pale salmon pink. Hindwing: the whole surface sparsely irrorated with minute black scales; a small black discocellular spot. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings pale salmon pink. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen black, the antennae speckled with white, the head and thorax covered with greenish-fuscous hairs; beneath: the palpi green, thorax and abdomen white. Female is polymorphic. Form 1. Upperside: ground colour paler than in the male, in some specimens quite ochraceous outwardly; all the markings similar, but duller in tint. The hindwing, of course, without the black costal band of specialized scales, the ground colour extended up to the costal margin. Underside similar to that of the male, but the ground colour very much paler and more ochraceous than green. In some specimens, in addition to the black spots in interspaces 1 and 2 on forewing, there is an anterior postdiscal fuscous curved band.

The Authority's director, Barbara Bennett, was responsible for assessing whether agreements lodged on or after 7 May 2007 passed the Fairness Test. However she also agreed to be the front of the Howard Government's WorkChoices advertising campaign in 2007 and received heavy criticism for her role. The Authority also received strong criticism in relation to the enormous backlog of unassessed Workplace Agreements lodged after Bennett's appointment.Fairness Test Backlog Continues To GrowBacklog on Fairness Test The Fairness Test was applied to Australian workplace agreements and collective agreements to ensure they provided fair compensation for the removal or modification of protected award conditions, such as penalty rates and overtime loadings.

Ho Hong's roots: The Chinese Commercial Bank The founders of Ho Hong Bank were Lim Peng Siang, Lim Boon Keng and Seow Poh Leng, all of whom were, before that time, founding members and officers of the earlier Chinese Commercial Bank. On 17 August 1912, a largely attended meeting of Hokkiens, shareholders of the then proposed Chinese Commercial Bank Ltd., was held at the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Hill Street, presided over by Lee Choon Guan.

At that time the value of the bank's property had appreciated and the bank was considering opening a branch at Penang.The Straits Times, 20 November 1913, Page 8 In November 1913, following continual withdrawals for about a week amounting to up to $700,000, a notice was posted on the door of the Kwong Yik Banking Company's premises at Kling Street informing the public that there had been a run on the bank and the bank was unable to meet its liabilities at that time. The Chinese Commercial Bank's position, at the time, was considered to have been on sound footing.The Straits Times, 20 November 1913, Page 9The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 21 November 1913, Page 7The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 27 November 1913, Page 342 To allay public fears, the Chinese Commercial Bank, in the form of a letter dated 16 December 1913 from Secretary Seow Poh-Leng to the Editor of the Straits Times, wrote, \\"I notice a short paragraph in your issue of last Saturday to the effect that there has been a feeling of uneasiness in regard to the Chinese banks generally in Singapore and that in consequence many Chinese merchants have transferred their business from Chinese banks to European banks. I beg to state that these statements are not applicable to the Chinese Commercial Bank.\\" Poh-Leng went on to note that the Chinese Commercial Bank had, far from experiencing any loss of business, had improved its turnover - the turnover of business between 20 November 1913 when the uneasiness began and 13 December, exceeded the turnover of the same number of days previously, by 25% and correspondingly customers also increased by more than 26%.The Straits Times, 16 December 1913, Page 9 In March 1914, Secretary Seow Poh Leng reported that a general meeting of shareholders of the Chinese Commercial Bank Limited had been held on 10 March 1914 at 64 Kling Street to elect new Directors.

Before the interview, Seow Poh Leng was called on to produce a balance sheet within 48 hours, which he did, after which he fell from sheer exhaustion. A notice, ordered by Sir Arthur, was published in the Staits Times of 7 August where the bank informed the public, \\"Owing to a run on the Chinese Commercial Bank, Limited, the directors have had to request the assistance of Government, and the latter has promised to help pending an examination into the accounts of the bank.\\" By order of the Colonial Secretary, the bank was closed during the examination.The Straits Times, 7 August 1914, Page 9Capital and entrepreneurship in South-East Asia By Rajeswary Ampalavanar Brown On 27 August 1914, Secretary Seow Poh Leng had a notice published in the major newspapers, informing the public of a Government proclamation, dated 26 August and published at the bank, \\"Maxwell, acting Colonial Secretary, Straits Settlements, issues this Proclamation for general information. The Government has examined thoroughly the accounts of the Chinese Commercial Bank and finds that its assets exceed the liabilities. The present trouble is partly due to the fact that many traders are hoarding their money instead of paying it into the bank. The Government now allows the shareholders of the bank to raise ready money; if no cash can be raised then they must make a call on the unpaid capital to meet this emergency. If the bank is able within a reasonable time to raise cash, the Government will certainly lend it a sum of money equal to the amount so raised. The bank is authorised to collect all debts due to it in the usual way. Further it should be well known to all that in the present time of war, people who have cash should pay it into the various banks in the Colony and thus allow it to circulate freely to help commerce and should not hoard it. Hoarding not only does no good to those who hoard but will certainly do harm to the local situation and thus help the enemy.\\"The Straits Times, 27 August 1914, Page 10The Singapore Free Press and Mercantile Advertiser (1884-1942), 27 August 1914, Page 6 On 30 September 1914, the bank's statement of accounts, dated 15 August, was published by its auditors, Welsh & Co.The Straits Times, 30 September 1914, Page 6 On 30 September, Secretary Seow Poh Leng issued an announcement that the bank would resume business on Tuesday 1 October 1914.The Straits Times, 30 September 1914, Page 11 Within the first five minutes of the bank opening its doors there was more paid in than paid out and by noon deposits exceeded withdrawals by $27,552.The Straits Times, 1 October 1914, Page 8 Due to repeated complaints from shareholders, particularly Tan Cheng Siong, Lim Peng Siang, resigned.

First Malayan Chinese bank to go international Seow Poh Leng focused his efforts towards bringing the Ho Hong Bank in line with the well-established \\"exchange banks\\" of the Straits Settlements and relying solely on his own study and observation cautiously began foreign exchange activities. He was joined in his efforts, in 1923, by Dr. H. L. Huang who had existing practical exchange experience. The Ho Hong Bank was the first Chinese bank in Malaya to engage in international banking. Ho Hong Bank enhanced its foreign exchange business by establishing branches in Hong Kong and later Shanghai. This, together with close co-operation of the South East Asian (Nanyang) offices and correspondents, transformed this local bank into an important exchange bank in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Malaya.Singapore By Gretchen Liu; p. 174The International Expansion of Singapore's Largest Banks by Adrian E.

Description Upperside of male forewing has a pale salmon-pink ground colour, this colour paler outwardly; base heavily irrorated (sprinkled) with bluish-grey scales that extend outwards and are merged with a black patch that occupies the apex of the cell and spreads along the discocellulars; terminal third of wing black with enclosed spots of the ground colour in interspaces 3, 4, 5 and 9, the spot in 4 sometimes absent, the inner edge of the black area emarginate at interspaces 2 and 4; the outer margin with a series of minute terminal specks of ground colour in the interspaces. Hindwing: white, base heavily irrorated with bluish-grey scales that are extended downwards in a diffuse band parallel to the dorsum; terminal half of wing jet black. Underside: precisely like the underside of C. protractus male. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in C. protractus. Female is very variable, but resembles the male in markings. On the upperside however, the terminal areas on both forewings and hindwings that are black in the male are silky brown on the forewing, the inner sinuate margin of the same posteriorly black; on the hindwing the terminal brown area encloses an irregular sinuate black band that does not extend either to the costa or the dorsum. The ground colour of the forewing in some specimens is faintly pink fading to white outwardly; on the hindwing the ground colour is white, as in the male. In other specimens the ground colour on both forewings and hindwings is entirely white or pinkish orange. Underside: as in the male, but the apical area of the forewing and the whole surface of the hindwing tinged more or less with ochraceous. In many individuals (probably of the dry-season broods) this ochraceous tint is very marked. Forewing: with posterior black spots as in the male. Hindwing: an irregular discal sinuate macular brown band that is often obsolescent. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen much as in the male.

Iwase (born December 1, 1947) is a former Hawaii State Senator. In 2006 he announced his candidacy for the Hawaii Democratic Party's nomination for Governor of Hawaii. He ran on a platform emphasizing reform in the education sector, citing his beliefs in the importance of universal education learned from his own working-class background. The popular incumbent Republican governor defeated Iwase by a substantial margin, in spite of a favorable Democratic climate in 2006. Early years Randy Iwase was born in Honolulu. His mother was divorced and because of financial hardship in Hawai'i just after World War II, moved to the Island of Hawai'i to live with Randy's Big Island grandparents. Later, his family moved back to an Ala Moana Boulevard, Honolulu, and lived with his other grandparents in relative hardship. He attended and graduated from Kaimuki High School. After high school he attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa during a time of optimism and technological advancements. Iwase earned his bachelor's degree with honors, there. He applied to and attended the University of San Francisco School of Law and earned his Juris Doctor degree. Iwase married his wife Jan in 1977 and has three sons Justin, Jarand, and Jordan. Career Randy Iwase returned to Hawai'i with his JD degree and worked as a deputy attorney general and also served as Majority Floor Leader, Hawai'i State Senator (Majority Whip), and executive director of the Aloha Tower Development Corp. 2006 gubernatorial race Iwase won the Democratic primary by a substantial margin without serious opposition and faced Republican incumbent Governor Linda Lingle. Only one debate occurred in the duration of the campaign, giving the relatively unknown Iwase statewide television exposure.Honolulu Advertiser: Debate recap According to filings with the Hawai'i state Campaign Spending Commission, the Iwase campaign had only raised $241,973 as of September 23, 2006. This was in contrast to a record $6.37 million raised by his opponent, Governor Linda Lingle. The large difference in available funds was cited as an insurmountable obstacle for Iwase. Instead, the Iwase campaign focused on using Internet technology. In addition to a classic webpage with campaign press releases and schedules, it featured videos, online contributions, links, a discussion/feedback board, blogs, as well as an RSS/Atom newsfeed. Randy Iwase was defeated by over twenty-five points, 63 percent to 35 percent, in the general election, as Governor Lingle's personal popularity and well funded media campaign overwhelmed Iwase. His campaign's financial difficulties and late start offset the congressional Democratic \\"wave\\" of 2006.

Gyeongmun married Queen Munui, who was the daughter of King Heonan. Gyeongmun's reign saw intensifying internal strife and rebellion. He sought to strengthen the kingdom within and without, but was generally unsuccessful. Famine was widespread. In 869, he sent the Crown Prince (who would become King Heongang) to Tang China together with Kim Yun. The Samguk Yusa tells that Gyeongmun became a Hwarang with 18 years.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae- Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 104. Silk Pagoda (2006). The Samguk Yusa also portrays a story which is similar to that of king midas' ears. A royal crownmaker appears instead of the barber. The crownmaker shouted the secret at a bamboo forest. Following the crownmaker's death, the king noticed that when the wind blows, his secrets echo from the forest. He immediately felt unpleasant and destroyed the bamboo forest and planted dogwoods. His daughter, Jinseong, would later become Silla's 51 ruler and its 3rd and last reigning queen in 887.

The perpetrator, Walter Seifert, also known as \\"Der Feuerteufel von Volkhoven\\" (firedevil of Volkhoven), attacked the people at the school with a home-made flamethrower and a spear, killing eight pupils and two teachers, and wounding twenty-two others. When police arrived at the scene he fled from the school compound and poisoned himself. He was taken to a hospital, where he died the same evening.Maniac Sprays Fire on Cologne Pupils , The New York Times (12 June 1964)Maniac uses 'flamethrower' on pupils, The Windsor Star (11 June 1964)German killer hazy on massacre, The Windsor Star (12 June 1964) Perpetrator Walter Seifert Willi Walter Seifert (19 June 1921 ‚Äì 11 June 1964) was born in Bickendorf, a district of Cologne. He was the son of a glass-grinder and had a brother. From 1927 to 1935 he attended the Volksschule in Ehrenfeld, and afterwards started an apprenticeship as metal worker at a machine factory, which he successfully finished in 1939. In 1941 he was drafted into the Luftwaffe and attended the Waffentechnische Schule der Luftwaffe (Weaponry Technology School of the Airforce) for a year. By the end of the war he was a sergeant in an anti- aircraft battery and afterwards was a prisoner of war for several months. Seifert worked for a Cologne car factory, before joining the Schutzpolizei on 14 November 1945. On 23 August 1946 he was treated for a bronchial catarrh, and an examination by a specialist on 5 September diagnosed with tuberculosis in the right lung, resulting in his dismissal from the police on 30 September, as he was unfit for service. From then on Seifert attempted to enforce his claims for subsistence, feeling he was being treated unfairly by the government which he claimed was cheating him of his war pension. In 1953 his tuberculosis was found to be inactive and Seifert declared to have a reduced earning capacity of 30%, though any causality between his illness and his imprisonment during the war was denied. Seifert contested this, accused the doctors of creating false medical reports and complained in long letters to various authorities about his problems. In August 1954 Seifert was examined by a public health officer, who was of the opinion that he was not in need of a regimen, but suggested that he could be sent to a sanatorium for observation. The doctor also noted in his report that Seifert was a mentally devious person with no will to recover. Seifert again contested the report and wrote a letter titled \\"Sozialpolitik - Sozial√§rzte ‚Äî Sozialmord\\" (social politics ‚Äî social doctors ‚Äî social murder), whereupon he was examined by a medical specialist for neurology and psychiatry, who noted Seifert's quirky behaviour, his scattered train of thought, and his constant smile in inappropriate situations. He also recorded that Seifert harboured paranoid thoughts about his doctors and showed a peculiar fanatical behaviour, coming to the conclusion that he was a paranoid schizophrenic, but since he did not show any violent or dangerous behaviour the doctor deemed it unnecessary to hospitalise him in a mental institution. Around that time Seifert revealed to his brother that he had a plan to kidnap young girls, to use them whenever he wished. According to his brother's statement, Seifert intended to ambush the girls on country roads, stun them and then bring them home on his moped trailer to hold them captive in a cellar, of which he had already made sketches. On 7 October 1955 Seifert married Renata Urszula and reportedly fell apart when she died of an embolism during premature birth on 11 February 1961. Holding the doctors responsible for the death of his wife he wrote a 120-page letter titled \\"Muttermord ‚Äî Einzelschicksal und Analyse eines Systems\\" (Matricide - Individual fate and analysis of a system), and sent it to agencies, doctors and pharmaceutical manufacturers. Therein he tried to prove that the treatment of his wife's embolism was done wrong, called society a criminal system and equated doctors with murderers, writing: ::The doctor is the greatest mass murderer of the poor in the history of mankind (...) What to do? Appeal to their 'conscience' - useless, whoever does something like that has no conscience. Does the aforementioned science count before any court? No, thus begins the vigilante justice, the terror of the medical society in the pluralistic chaos of criminality. But terror can only be extirpated with counter-terror, and whoever denies me the protection of the law forces the cudgel into my hand.Kiehne, Karl: Das Flammenwerferattentat in K√∂ln-Volkhoven, in Archiv f√ºr Kriminologie, Vol. 136; F.C.W. Vogel, 1965. =Weapons= Seifert had made all of his weapons about two months prior to the attack. The spear was made from a broomstick and a triangular scraper, while he used a pump bracket to create the mace. His flamethrower was made from an insecticide sprayer with a wire netting attached to the nozzle, and filled with a mixture of old motor oil and paint thinner. Massacre Seifert's path through the school On 11 June 1964, shortly after 09:00, Seifert approached the schoolyard of the Catholic elementary school located at Volkhovener Weg 209-211, armed with a self-made flamethrower, a spear and a mace. The school consisted of one main building and four wooden barracks, each housing two classes with a total of eight teachers and 380 pupils. As Seifert entered the school compound through the smaller of two gates he was observed by three crossing guards who mistook him for a mechanic trying to repair the gate's broken lock and asked him what he was doing there. Seifert ignored them and, after blocking off the gate with a wooden wedge, proceeded towards teacher Anna Langohr who was teaching a group of girls in sports at the schoolyard. When Langohr, who knew Seifert, asked if she could help him, he ignited his flamethrower and attacked her and the girls. Seifert then went to one of the barracks, smashed in the windows with the mace, and aimed his weapon at the children in the classrooms, setting them on fire. He continued to attack the people running and jumping out of the burning building until his flamethrower ran out of fuel, whereupon he threw it away. When teacher Gertrud Bollenrath stepped out on the schoolyard Seifert fatally stabbed her in the chest with his spear and then approached the barrack where Ursula Kuhr and Mrs Kunz were teaching. The two women tried to keep the doors shut, but Seifert managed to open one, and causing Kuhr lose her balance. After she fell down the flight of stairs and landed on the ground in front of the building Seifert stabbed her in both legs and once between her shoulders. Seifert then fled the school compound and swallowed E605, a poisonous insecticide, to commit suicide, but as the substance was diluted he did not die immediately. Chased by 20 to 30 people he ran towards a railway embankment where he tried to fend off his pursuers with his spear. When police arrived at the scene at 09:38 he tried to stab one of the officers, but was eventually immobilised with a shot in his leg. He was arrested and taken to the University Hospital in Lindenthal where he was questioned several times, before he died at 20:35.Death certificate of Walter Seifert , Digitales Historisches Archiv K√∂ln (p. 167) The attack had lasted for about 15 minutes. Ursula Kuhr died at the scene, while Gertrud Bollenrath succumbed to her wounds in hospital at 13:00. Along with teachers Anna Langohr and Wiltrud Schweden, twenty-eight pupils were taken to hospitals, some of them with burns to 90 % of their body. Eight of the pupils died in the following weeks.Der 11.06.1964 , B√ºrgerverein K√∂ln-Volkhoven-Weiler e.V.Das Attentat von K√∂ln-Volkhoven , Ursula-Kuhr-Schule =Victims= Gravestone for Ursula Kuhr on Cologne S√ºdfriedhof Teachers: *Gertrud Bollenrath, aged 62 *Ursula Kuhr, aged 24 Students: *Dorothea Binner, 9, died on 15 JuneAnother child dies of attack by flamethrower, Star-News (16 June 1964) *Renate F√ºhlen, 9, died on 19 June Das 7.

Freud used his analysis of this dream to arrive at his theory that dreams are wish fulfillments. He described his ideas on dream theory in his book The Interpretation of Dreams. Freud later noted that \\"Irma‚Äôs Injection\\" was the first dream he had meticulously interpreted. Although he spent much time analyzing it, he did confess that his interpretation had gaps and did not completely uncover the meaning of his dream. The dream Freud had been treating a patient, whom he called Irma, during the summer of 1895. At one point he proposed a particular treatment solution that Irma was not willing to accept. Irma‚Äôs treatment was partially successful, but it ended before it was complete. After some time had passed, Freud visited with a colleague who knew Irma and asked about her condition. Freud was informed that Irma was ‚Äúbetter, but not quite well.‚Äù That night, Freud dreamt the dream that is now known as \\"Irma‚Äôs Injection\\". He described it as follows: Freud‚Äôs analysis of the dream Freud wrote down his dream immediately once he awoke. He felt that this dream had an advantage over others because it was clear that the events from the previous day had provided a starting point for the dream. Freud analyzed every aspect of the dream in great detail. In his analysis of \\"Irma‚Äôs Injection\\", Freud substituted many of the individuals in his real life for the people in the dream, including patients, family members, and friends. He thought about the medical mistakes he had made and believed that he was subconsciously seeking to rid himself of the guilt caused by them. The dream starts with the hall at Bellevue, where Freud and his wife were staying for the summer. In the upcoming days they were to host a party for his wife‚Äôs birthday. Freud was informed of the guests and remembers his patient being among them. This patient serves as Irma in the dream, who is still suffering from pains. Freud informed Irma that her suffering was her own fault for not accepting his diagnosis. Irma complained of pains in her stomach and the feeling of being choked by them. This led Freud to question his diagnosis, and he sought to find a possible error to avoid blame for the lack of presenting a cure. Freud proceeds to re-examine Irma and inspects her oral cavity. Freud stated in his analysis that Irma‚Äôs actions at this point in the dream reminded him of a female friend of Irma‚Äôs. He thought of a few explanations as to why he replaced Irma with someone else in the dream. These explanations included the idea that he did not want Irma as a patient or the fact that he held Irma‚Äôs friend in high regard for her intelligence. Freud also considered Irma to be irrational for not taking his offered solution to her problem. He believed that Irma‚Äôs friend would have been wiser and would have agreed to Freud‚Äôs proposed solution. When Freud looked in Irma‚Äôs throat he saw a white scab on the turbinal bone. In his analysis he stated that these particular signs in the dream reminded him of his daughter‚Äôs illness and the difficulties his family went through at that time. At one point when Freud was using cocaine frequently to counter an ailment, he learned that a dear friend of his had died because of the misuse of the cocaine treatment. He confessed of having \\"been the first to recommend the use of cocaine in 1885, and this recommendation had brought serious reproaches down on me\\". Freud believed that the scab in the dream was an indicator of the concern he had had with his own health at the time. In the dream, Freud asks Dr. M. for a second opinion. Once again, Freud recalled a past medical mistake during his analysis. He was reminded of a patient whom he unknowingly prescribed a toxic drug. The patient became ill, and Freud was forced to ask his more experienced colleague for help. Freud also recalled that this patient had the same name as his daughter, Mathilde. Freud analyzed that it seemed he was using the dream as an opportunity to criticize himself for the medical mistakes he had made. In the dream, Dr. M. assures Freud that Irma‚Äôs symptoms point to an infection and that her body will rid itself of the effects. Freud believed that this fact allowed him to shift the blame for Irma‚Äôs illness because his treatment could not have caused such an infection. He was relieved in knowing that Dr. M. supported him and that this was not his fault. Freud‚Äôs dream theory Freud came to a conclusion about the meaning and intention of the dream using his analysis. He believed that the dream fulfilled several wishes and that it represented a particular situation that he might have wished to exist in. Freud concluded that the motive of the dream was a wish and the content of the dream was a wish fulfillment. Freud eventually concluded that all dreams represent some sort of wish fulfillment. He analyzed his patients' dreams as well as his own using free-association and found that in nearly every case, the latent content included wishes, even if the manifest content seemed to be the opposite of a wish fulfillment. Freud believed that every dream contained manifest and latent content. He believed that the manifest content was the consciously experienced aspect of the dream, while the latent content was the hidden inspiration of the dream that could only be remembered after free-association. Freud concluded that in cases where only the latent content of the dream contained a wish, the manifest content was helping to hide the embarrassing aspects of the latent content.

He was the eldest son of King Sinmu and Lady Jeonggye. Munseong's reign was typical of late Unified Silla, with rampant strife and uprisings. Examples include the 841 rebellion of Hong Pil, the 846 rebellion of Jang Bogo (after he failed to marry his daughter into the royal line), as well as the treason of Kim Sik in 849. The earlier part of his reign was marked by relatively active trade and commerce with both Japan and Tang China. This was due to Jang Bogo's role in securing the major shipping routes. Upon his death in 857, King Munseong was buried in the Gongjakji tomb precinct in Gyeongju. He was succeeded by his uncle Heonan.

Critic Jim DeRogatis would later write in his book Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (2003) that \\"Emergency Third Rail Power Trip is not only the best album from any of the Paisley Underground bands, it ranks with the best psychedelic rock efforts from any era\\", with uplifting melodies offset by themes that were \\"dark and introspective.\\" According to DeRogatis, the album showcased \\"the Robacks' ethereal vocals, Eddie Kalwa's precise drumming, Will Glenn's colorful sitar, violin, and keyboard accents, and an intricate, chiming, but droney two-guitar attack that picks up where the Byrds left off with 'Eight Miles High.'\\" After David Roback left to form a new band, Opal, the rest of the band continued to record as a four-piece, releasing the mini-LP Explosions in the Glass Palace in 1984. NME would later write, in praise of Explosions in the Glass Palace: \\"Sound cathedrals? We got ‚Äòem ... mind-meltingly beautiful guitar sounds, employed sparingly and dynamically amid dark, dizzy tales of murder, madness and drug paranoia.\\" The song \\"No Easy Way Down\\" was cited as a \\"mantra for an altered state of mind, and testament to a band who, however fleetingly, made music that sounded like the best drugs ever.\\" After the release of a single, \\"You Are My Friend\\", drummer Eddie Kalwa left and was replaced by Mark Marcum, with John Thoman (guitar, vocals) also added to the line-up. The band was signed to Island Records, and recorded a live album in Japan called Beyond The Sunset. Their third album, Crashing Dream, came out in 1985. =Breakup and other projects (1986‚Äì2012)= The band split in 1986, reforming briefly in 1988 to finish off a double album they had started, which was never released. Piucci would go on to release the LP Can't Get Lost When You're Goin' Nowhere with Tim Lee, under the band name Gone Fishin'. He later joined Crazy Horse. Steven Roback went on to form the band Viva Saturn whose debut release appeared on the San Francisco label Heyday Records, which was run at the time by Pat Thomas of the band Absolute Grey. Viva Saturn went on to release two additional LPs, Soundmind and Brightside. David Roback made the album Rainy Day, featuring cover versions performed by various leading lights of the Paisley Underground. He formed The Clay Allison Band and Opal, both with former Dream Syndicate bassist Kendra Smith, and later formed Mazzy Star with Hope Sandoval. =Reunion and comeback (2012‚Äìpresent)= The Rain Parade reformed in 2012, performing their comeback gig on December 20, 2012 at Cafe Du Nord in San Francisco on a sold out bill with Powder and The Bang Girl Group Revue. The Rain Parade lineup included original members Matt Piucci, Steven Roback and John Thoman, augmented by Mark Hanley, Alec Palao and former Game Theory drummer Gil Ray. In December 2013, Rain Parade played two nights with three other reunited Paisley Underground bands ‚Äî The Bangles, The Dream Syndicate, and The Three O'Clock ‚Äî at The Fillmore in San Francisco (Dec. 5) and The Fonda Theatre in Los Angeles (Dec. 6 benefit concert). In 2014, drummer Gil Ray gave up performing due to health concerns, and was replaced in the lineup by returning member Stephan Junca. Ray died of cancer in 2017. Three new recordings by Rain Parade were released in November 2018 as part of a compilation album called 3 √ó 4, which also included The Dream Syndicate, The Bangles, and The Three O'Clock, with each of the four bands covering songs by the other bands. Following the initial Record Store Day First release as a double album on \\"psychedelic swirl\\" purple vinyl, Yep Roc Records released the album on LP, CD, and digital in February 2019. David Roback died on February 25, 2020.

His reign was the briefest in the state's history, lasting only from the fourth to the seventh lunar month of 839. Sinmu was the son of the Sangdaedeung Kim Gyunjeong (?‚Äì836), a descendant of King Wonseong (r. 785-798) and cousin to King Heungdok (r. 826‚Äì838). Upon the death of King Heungdok in 836 a succession struggle erupted between Kim Gyunjeong and his nephew, Kim Jeryung (?‚Äì838). Ujing and his follower, Kim Yang supported Gyunjeong, while Kim Myeong and Kim Rihong stood by Jeryung. Jeryung's party ultimately triumphed and Gyunjeong was killed. Kim Jeryung was then crowned as King Huigang in 836. Yang escaped, but Ujing did not. Though being pardoned promptly by the new king, he soon became threatened by Myeong who became Sangdaedeung. So in 837, Ujing fled and entrusted himself with Jang Bogo in Cheonghaejin. However, a year later, Myeong fomented a revolt against King Huigang which killed several of the King's aides. Faced with defeat, King Huigang committed suicide. Kim Myeong then ascended the throne as King Minae. Kim Yang, who was then concealing himself on a mountain near the capital, heard the news and raised up an army to go to Cheonghaejin. He told Ujing of these events and persuaded him to have his revenge. Ujing asked Jang Bogo to help him to take advantage of the confusion of the country and to make himself a king. Jang Bogo agreed and had his friend Jeong Nyeon also follow Ujing. In 839, Ujing and his followers defeated King Minae's army at the battle of Daegu and quickly advanced upon the capital. All the king's aides then ran away leaving the king behind, so the king hid himself in a villa near the royal palace. Soldiers came into the palace and searched for the king. Finally, they found the king in the villa and killed him in spite of his pleas. Kim Rihong was also killed. Ujing then placed himself on the throne as King Sinmu. He died three months later from disease and was buried on Mt. Jehyeong in the Silla capital of Gyeongju. It is also said that Sinmu dreamed of seeing the dead Rihong shooting an arrow into him. Sinmu awoke with a start when the arrow hit him, but the wound remained real, becoming worse and worse, finally leading to his death.

Description Male, India The ground colour on the upperside of males is pale salmon buff, paler in specimens from desert areas, darker in those procured in regions where there is a regular though not heavy rainfall. Forewing: base and costal margin irrorated (speckled) in varying degree with dusky scales; an oval annular discocellular spot that varies in size; a black, festooned, postdiscal band that extends from costa to vein 4, beyond which the veins are margined with black; this colour broadened sub-terminally into a second transverse fascia, that is followed by a very fine black line on the extreme terminal margin. In specimens from desert regions the transverse bands and the black edging to the veins are narrow, but in moister areas the two transverse bands unite posteriorly and with the slender black terminal line give an appearance as of a double series of spots of the ground colour enclosed between them. Hindwing: more uniform, the veins with terminal black spots; costa broadly pale, fading to white. Underside: pale yellowish white, in many specimens from moist localities suffused with a beautiful rosy flush; the markings in such specimens prominent, in those from dry localities more or less obsolescent. Forewing: discocellular spot as on the upperside, but complete, and not an oval ring; in some specimens a postdiscal, dark ochraceous brown, narrow, curved band from costa to middle of interspace 2. Hindwing: a small discocellular spot in the form of an oval light brown ring always much smaller than the similar spot on the forewing; a postdiscal, curved, more or less sinuate band similar to and in continuation of the band on the forewing from the costa to vein 1. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen dusky black, the club of the antennae on the underside, the hairs that cover the head and thorax and the scaling of the abdomen salmon buff; beneath: much paler, fading to white in specimens from dry localities. Sex-mark: a small patch of brown specialized scales on the underside of the forewing above vein 1, closer to the base than to the termen. On the upperside this is more or less prominent as a small raised spot. Female, India Females are dimorphic. Form 1: ground colour and markings as in the male; the costa of the hindwing on the upperside concolorous with the rest of the wing; the sex-mark of course absent. Form 2. Upperside: ground colour white, often more or less irregularly suffused on parts of the wing with salmon buff; markings similar to those in the male, but very much broader. Forewing: base and costal area heavily irrorated with greyish-blue scales. Hindwing: the terminal spots at apices of the veins large and quadrate, often united into a continuous band which then encloses an anteciliary series of spots of the ground colour. In a few specimens there are traces of a postdiscal macular black band, in a very few this band is almost complete and very prominent. Underside: ground colour white; markings as in the male, but broader, darker and more prominent. It is found in Baluchistan, Sind, the Punjab, Rajasthan and Bombay. The species is also found in Asia Minor, Arabia, Persia and Afghanistan. Race tripuncta, Butler. Very closely resembles the typical from, but this the southern form or race can be distinguished as follows: Male upperside has the ground colour of a much deeper tint of salmon buff, almost orange yellow. Forewing: costa heavily irrorated with black scales; discocellular spot larger, not annular; postdiscal black fascia at all seasons united to the subterminal fascia and black anteciliary line so that the whole apex and termen of the wing are black, broadly at the costa and gradually narrowed towards the tornal angle. This black area encloses never more than three preapical moderately large spots and a complete series of minute anteciliary specks of the ground colour. Hindwing: as in C. fausta, but the terminal black spots very large. Underside: ground colour of a richer yellower tint than in the typical form; markings similar, those on the forewing dusky black, on the hindwing rose pink. Antennae, head, thorax, abdomen and sex-mark as in male of the typical form. Female upperside closely resembles the female of form 2 of C. fausta, but all the markings are darker and conspicuously broader, while the number of the preapical spots of the ground colour enclosed within the black area on the forewing is never more than three, the same as in the male. Underside, forewing: white sometimes faintly suffused with yellow; apical and terminal areas anteriorly light to dark ochraceous yellow; discocellular spot very large; transverse, postdiscal, macular dark reddish-brown band very broad. Hindwing: pale ochraceous yellow, sparsely powdered with black scales; transverse postdiscal macular band reddish brown and broad as in the forewing. Antennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in female form 2 of C. fausta.

Description The ground colour on the upperside of the males is white, sparsely irrorated (speckled) at base of forewings and hindwings with black scales. The forewing has a small black spot on the discocellulars; apex broadly black, with an enclosed oval, curved, rich orange patch placed obliquely and traversed by the veins, which there are black; inner edge of black area diffuse. Hindwing is uniform, except for a preapical short diffuse black streak from the costa, sometimes absent, and a series of terminal black spots that in specimens from moist localities are very large. Underside is white with the cell and apex of forewing suffused with sulphur yellow, the orange patch of the upperside shows through by transparency, its inner edge margined anteriorly by a very obscure oblique fuscous band. Hindwing has the preapical short transverse black streak on the upperside obscurely indicated. The female is very similar to the male but can be distinguished as follows: Upperside of the forewing has a narrower orange patch enclosed within the black apical area; a small black spot in middle of interspace 1 and another in interspace 3. Hindwing has the terminal spots slightly larger.

Forewing has spots in interspaces 1 and 3 as on the upperside. Hindwing: a curved, almost complete, discal series of fuscous spots; otherwise as in the male. In both sexes the antennae vary from white to pale brownish; head, thorax and abdomen black, the head and thorax with short greyish-brown hairs; beneath: the palpi, thorax and abdomen white. Range It is found from the outer ranges of the Himalayas throughout peninsular India except Bengal. Subspecies C. e. limbata is found in Sri Lanka. and it has the black apical area on the forewing darker, broader, occupying about a third of the wing; the orange patch enclosed within it is proportionately narrower, so that the black on its inner margin has the appearance of being broader proportionately than it is in the typical form. Very often this inner edge is bordered by a suffusion of sulphur yellow. Specimens from south Indian hills resemble this closely. =Larva= The larva is narrow and uniformly green with a yellow, white, or pink-tinged line along each side. =Pupa= The pupa is compressed with a long, upturned end. It is green when new, turning a brown-mottled grey.

He created alliances with the Germans during World War I, was part of the Berlin Committee organising Indian students in Europe against the British, and explored actions by the Japanese at the time. He went to Moscow in 1920 to develop support by the Communists for the Indian movement, including among Asians in Moscow who were working on revolutionary movements. He joined the German Communist Party (KPD). He lived in Moscow for several years in the 1930s. Arrested in July 1937 in Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, Chatto was executed on 2 September 1937. Early life Virendranath Chattopadhyaya His childhood nickname was Binnie or Biren. Virendranath was the eldest son (the second of eight children) of Dr. Aghorenath Chattopadhyaya (Chatterjee), a scientist-philosopher and educationist who was an ex-principal and professor of science at the Nizam College, and his wife Barada Sundari Devi, a poet and singer in a Bengali family settled in Hyderabad. Their children Sarojini Naidu and Harindranath Chattopadhyay became well-known poets and parliamentarians. Their daughter Mrinalini (Gannu) became a Nationalist activist and introduced Virendranath to many of her circle in Kolkata (Calcutta). A younger son Marin became involved with Virendranath in political activism. Chattopadhyaya received a secular and liberal education. He was a polyglot and was fluent in the Indian languages Telugu, Tamil, Bengali, Urdu, Persian, Hindi, as well as English; later he was to learn French, Italian, German, Dutch, Russian and the Scandinavian languages as well. He matriculated in the University of Madras and received an undergraduate degree in Arts from the University of Calcutta. In Kolkata, through his sister Gannu (Mrinalini), already known as an advanced Nationalist, Virendranath was introduced to Bejoy Chandra Chatterjee, a barrister and extremist. Chatto met Sri Aurobindo's family, especially his cousins, Kumudini and Sukumar Mitra; the former was editor of the seditious magazine Suprabhat. For years afterwards, Chattopadhyaya maintained contact with all of them.Political Trouble in India, James Campbell Ker, 1917, repr. 1973, pp. 198‚Äì199 In England In 1902, Chattopadhyaya joined the University of Oxford, while preparing for the Indian Civil Service. Later, he became a law student of the Middle Temple. While frequenting Shyamji Krishna Varma's India House at 65 Cromwell Avenue in London, Chattopadhyaya became closely acquainted with V. D. Savarkar (since 1906). In 1907, Chattopadhyaya was on the editorial board of Shyamji's Indian Sociologist. In August, along with Madame Cama and S. R. Rana, he attended the Stuttgart Conference of the Second International where they met delegates including Henry Hyndman, Karl Liebknecht, Jean Jaur√®s, Rosa Luxemburg and Ramsay MacDonald, among others. Vladimir Lenin attended, but it is not certain if Chattopadhyaya met him on this occasion. In 1908, at \\"India House\\" he came in contact with a number of important \\"agitators\\" from India: G. S. Khaparde, Lajpat Rai, Har Dayal, Rambhuj Dutt and Bipin Chandra Pal. In June 1909, at an India House meeting, V. D. Savarkar strongly advocated assassinations of the Englishmen in India. On 1 July, at the Imperial Institute in London, Sir William Curzon-Wyllie, political aide-de-camp at the India Office, was assassinated by Madan Lal Dhingra, who was deeply influenced by Savarkar. Chattopadhyaya published a letter in The Times on 6 July in support of Savarkar, and was promptly expelled from the Middle Temple by the Benchers. In November 1909, he edited the short-lived but virulent nationalist periodical Talvar (The Sword). In May 1910, seizing the opportunity of tension between the United Kingdom and Japan over the Korean peninsula, Chattopadhyaya discussed the possibility of Japanese help to Indian revolutionary efforts. On 9 June 1910, along with D. S. Madhavrao, he followed V. V. S. Aiyar to Paris, to avoid a warrant issued for his arrest. Upon reaching France, he joined the French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). In Paris Aiyar returned to India and settled in Pondicherry where he published the Dharma newspaper and a number of political pamphlets in Tamil, while maintaining a regular contact with Madame Bhikaiji Cama in Paris. Chatto and some other revolutionaries stayed with her at 25 rue de Ponthieu and helped her to edit the Bande Mataram: its April 1911 issue \\"was one of the most violent that ever appeared,\\" praising outrages in Nasik and Kolkata.Ker, pp. 201‚Äì202 It said: \\"With gentlemen we can be gentlemen, but not with rogues and scoundrels. (...) Our friends the Bengalis have also begun to understand. Blessed be their efforts. Long be their arms.\\" In connection with the Tirunelveli Conspiracy Case in February 1912, Madame Bhikaiji Cama published an article showing that these political assassinations were in accord with the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. Marriage and family In 1912 Chattopadhyaya married Miss Reynolds, an Irish Catholic girl. Because he was pagan who rejected all effort to convert him, she bought a special dispensation from the pope to marry him. After the ceremony she informed him that a condition of the marriage was that any issue was to be Catholic. They quarreled and parted, she becoming a nun in some hidden English convent and he trying for years to have the marriage annulled.Agnes Smedley: Battle Hymn of China, p. 12 Chattopadhyaya went to Berlin in April 1914 to further revolutionary activities. There he entered a union with Agnes Smedley. Although it was not a legal marriage, she bore his name and was known as his wife. The relationship lasted eight years. Agnes wrote her famous novel Daughter of Earth in 1928, the year they got separated. In Germany In Germany to avoid suspicion, he enrolled in a university as a student. As a student in comparative linguistics at the University of Saxe-Anhalt in April 1914, Chattopadhyaya met Dr. Abhinash Bhattacharya (alias Bhatta) and some other nationalist Indian students. The former was well known to the influential members as belonging to the Kaiser's immediate circle. Early in September 1914, they formed a \\"German Friends of India\\" association, and were received by the brother of Wilhelm II. The Indians and Germans signed a treaty in favour of German help to oust the British from India. With the help of Baron Max von Oppenheim, who was an expert in Middle Eastern affairs in the German Foreign Office, Chattopadhyaya informed Indian students in thirty-one German universities about the association's future plans. He also helped in finding new members for the Berlin Committee. Among its first members were Chattopadhyaya, Bhatta, Dr. Moreshwar Govindrao Prabhakar (Cologne), Dr Abdul Hafiz (Leipzig), C. Padmanabhan Pillai (Z√ºrich), Dr. Jnanendra Dasgupta (Z√ºrich), Dhiren Sarkar, Narain S. Marath√©, Vishnu Suktankar, Gopal Paranjap√©, Karandikar, Shrish Chandra Sen, Satish Chandra Ray, Sambhashiva Rao, Dadachanji Kersasp, Mansur Ahmad, Siddiq. Other prominent revolutionaries who soon found their way to Berlin were Har Dayal, Tarak Nath Das, Mohammad Barakatullah, Bhupendranath Datta, A. Raman Pilla (A. R. Pillai), Chandrakanta Chakravarti, M. P. Tirumal Acharya, Herambalal Gupta, Jodh Singh Mahajan, Jiten Lahiri, Satyen Sen, and Vishnu Ganesh PingleyKer, p. 265;Indian Revolutionaries Abroad, by A. C. Bose, pp. 82‚Äì98Europ√© bharatiya biplaber sadhana by Abhinash Bhattacharya, pp. 99‚Äì125 On 22 September 1914, Sarkar and Marath√© left for Washington, D.C. with a message for the German ambassador, Von Bernstorf. He ordered Von Papen, his Military Attach√©, to arrange for steamers, and purchase arms and ammunition, to be delivered on the eastern coast of India. On 20 November 1914, Chattopadhyaya sent Satyen Sen, V. G. Pingley and Kart√¢r Singh to Kolkata with a report for Jatindranath Mukherjee or Bagha Jatin. Bagha Jatin sent a note through Pingley and Kartar Singh to Rash Behari Bose, asking him to expedite preparations for the proposed armed uprising.Bimanbihari Majumdar, Militant Nationalism in India, 1966, p. 167 In 1915, Chattopadhyaya went to meet Mahendra Pratap in Switzerland and tell him of the Kaiser's personal invitation to meet. He was dogged by the British agent, Donald Gullick, and an attempt was made to kill Chattopadhyaya. Revolutionary vagabond With the failure of the Indo-German Zimmermann Plan, in 1917 Chattopadhyaya opened a new Bureau of the Indipendence Committee in Stockholm, which acted under the name Indiska Nationalkommitt√©en. From this point on the Stockholm venture faught with the remaining parts of the Berlin Committee over the role of legitimate representative of Indian nationalism in Europe. In 1918, he contacted the Russian leaders Troinovski and Angelica Balabanova, the First General Secretary of the Communist International. In December, he dissolved the Berlin Committee. In May 1919, he arranged for a secret meeting of Indian revolutionaries in Berlin. In November 1920, in his search of financial and political support exclusively for the revolutionary nationalist movement in India, Chattopadhyaya was encouraged by M. N. Roy (with Mikhail Borodin's approval). He went to Moscow with Agnes Smedley and they became companions, sharing their lives until 1928. Under her influence, Chattopadhyaya coveted the influential position M. N. Roy enjoyed in Moscow. The next year, he was received by Lenin, along with Bhupendra Nath Datta and Pandurang Khankoje. From May to September, he attended the Indian Committee of the Third Congress of Communist International in Moscow. In December 1921 in Berlin, Chattopadhyaya founded an Indian News and Information Bureau with his correspondent Rash Behari Bose in Japan. According to Sibnarayan Ray, Roy and Chattopadhyaya were rivals for Agnes: \\"Roy would have liked to work with him since he admired the latter's intelligence and energy. (...) By early 1926 Chatto had got into good terms with Roy.\\"Sibnarayan Ray, In Freedom's Quest: Life of M. N. Roy, Vol. II, p. 235; Vol. III (Part 1), p. 17 At Roy's instance, Willi M√ºnzenberg \\"took Chatto under his wings\\" in organising an international conference in Europe to inaugurate the League against Imperialism. On the eve of Roy's mission to China, in January 1927, Chatto wrote to Roy asking \\"if there is anything further you wish me to do...\\" On 26 August 1927, he wrote to Roy, after the latter's return to Moscow from China, asking to help him \\"directly\\" to gain admission to the Communist parties of India and Germany. After being advised by Roy, Chatto joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD).Sibnarayan Ray, In Freedom's Quest: Life of M. N. Roy, Vol. II, p. 235; Vol. III (Part 1), p 17 In 1927, while working as the head of the Indian Languages Section of the KPD, Chatto accompanied Jawaharlal Nehru to the Brussels Conference of the League against Imperialism. Chattopadhyaya served as its general secretary. His younger brother Harin went to Berlin that year to meet him and Agnes. On learning of Jawaharlal Nehru's becoming president of the Indian National Congress, Chattopadhyaya asked him ‚Äì in vain ‚Äì to split the party for a more revolutionary programme of full independence from British imperialism. From 1930 to 1932, Chattopadhyaya published 28 articles in Inprecor, the Comintern organ, about an ultra-leftist sectarian turn of the Communist Party of India. Between 1931 and 1933, while living in Moscow, Chattopadhyaya continued to advocate anti-Hitler activities, Asian emancipation from Western powers, the independence of India, and Japanese intervention into the Chinese revolution. Among his Korean, Japanese and Chinese friends was Zhou Enlai, the future Prime Minister of the People's Republic of China after its successful Revolution. Agnes saw him for the last time in 1933 and remembered later: > \\"He embodied the tragedy of a whole race. Had he been born in England or > America, I thought, his ability would have placed him among the great > leaders of his age... He was at last growing old, his body thin and frail, > his hair rapidly turning white. The desire to return to India obsessed him, > but the British would trust him only if he were dust on a funeral pyre.\\" > China Correspondent, 1943 Last years In January‚ÄìFebruary 1934, Chatto exchanged letters with Krupskaya (Lenin's widow). On 18 March 1934 he gave a talk about his reminiscences of Vladimir Lenin.Documents of the History of Communist Party of India, Vol.1 He wrote to Georgi Dimitrov, Comintern's Secretary-General, on 9 September 1935: \\"For three years I have been kept away from active work in the Comintern.\\" Clemens Palme Dutt (the brother of Rajani Palme Dutt), mentioned having seen Chatto for the last time in 1936/37 at the department of ethnography of the Academy of Science in Leningrad.Letter from Clemens Palme Dutt to Muzaffar Ahmed, 1937 Chattopadhyaya was arrested on 15 July 1937 during the Great Purge of Stalin. His name appeared on a death list among 184 other persons, which was signed on 31 August 1937 by Stalin, Molotov, Voroshilov, Zhdanov and Kaganovich.\\"Stalin's shooting lists\\", Stalin Documents-Russia website The death sentence was pronounced by Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the USSR on 2 September 1937 and Chatto was executed the same day. On 10 July 1938, A. C. N. Nambiar, Chattopadhyaya's brother-in-law, wrote to Nehru about the arrest. He replied on 21 July, agreeing to try to find out about Chattopadhyaya's fate. Evaluation James Campbell Ker's Political Trouble in India: 1907‚Äì1917 discusses Chattopadhyaya. He described some of the less appealing aspects of his character and actions. He was deeply admired by colleagues such as M. N. Roy and Dr. Abhinash Bhattacharya for his able leadership, sharp intelligence and sincere emotion. In his autobiography decades later, Jawaharlal Nehru wrote of Chatto: > An entirely different type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member > of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto he was a very able > and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very > much the worse for wear and often he found it difficult to raise the > wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. > He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. > He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned > to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to > be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain > that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in > spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the > malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... > Of the few I met, the only persons who impressed me intellectually were > Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a > regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.An Autobiography, by > Jawaharlal Nehru, Bombay, 1962 Chattopadhyaya's family line survives today in Kolkata. Representation in other media Chatto was well known in Great Britain and India as a revolutionary. He is believed to have inspired Somerset Maugham's character of \\"Chandralal\\" in his short story, \\"Giulia Lazzari;\\" (its character of Ashenden was based upon Maugham).. The American writer Agnes Smedley, who was involved with Chatto for eight years, used him as a model for the character Ananda in her novel Daughter of Earth.. The Indian revolutionary in Berlin, A C N Nambiar, had married Chatto's sister Suhasini.

He is president and CEO of Basic Fun!https://toybook.com/backstory- jay-foreman-from-the-boardwalk-to-basic-fun, which began as The Bridge Direct in 2009. Basic Fun! and its related companies, Good Stuff, K'nex, Uncle Milton, and PlayHut, design, develop and market toys for children and adult collectors. The company's product portfolio includes internally developed brands like Mash'ems and Cutetitos, as well as licensed product lines from major entertainment companies, sports leagues and other toy companies, such as Mattel and Hasbro. In 2020 the company relaunched Tonka and Care Bears, which can now be found at major retailers around the world.  Early career  Foreman began his toy career in the amusement industry at the age of 18, while working at games on the boardwalk in Wildwood, New Jersey. In 1986, he became a sales rep for Fable Toys, which manufactured stuffed toys in its own factory in Brooklyn, New York. In 1990, Foreman co-founded Play By Play Toys in San Antonio, Texas, with Arturo Torres. He served as the general manager of the company from 1990 to 1996. Play By Play manufactured and distributed toys and novelties to the amusement and theme park industries. In 1992, Foreman secured rights for the company to make stuffed toys using the Coca-Cola and Harley Davidson brand names. These products were picked up by Walmart, the company's first traditional retail customer, expanding Play By Play's distribution from amusement channels into mass-market stores. In subsequent years, the company acquired licenses to make toys with Looney Tunes and Disney brands as well. Play By Play went public in 1995 on the NASDAQ exchange under the symbol PBYP. The initial stock offering was managed by Gerard, Klauer, Mattison & Co.https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/gerard-klauer-mattison-co-partners and raised $26M. The following year, Play By Play acquired its largest competitor, Ace Novelty. In 1996, Foreman joined San Francisco-based Galoob Toys. As Senior Vice President, he was tasked with building a direct-import division, and managing the development of internally conceived product lines. Foreman's major achievement at Galoob was identifying the opportunity and securing global rights to manufacture fashion dolls based on The Spice Girls, in cooperation with Simon Fuller, President of 19 Entertainment. Powered by the global pop-music phenomenon of the girl group, the toy line became the first to oust Barbie as the best-selling fashion doll by units, in both 1997 and 1998. The Spice Girls dolls became the most profitable toy line in Galoob's history at the time, with sales exceeding $125 Million in 1998. That same year, Foreman left Galoob, as the company was negotiating its sale to Hasbrohttps://www.marketwatch.com/story/hasbro-buys-galoob- for-220-million-09-28-98. He joined Empire of Carolinahttp://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~anhai/wisc-si- archive/data/company_profiles/yahoo/instances/company- index/Consumer_Cyclical/Recreational_Products/instances/http:%5E%5Ebiz.yahoo.com%5Ep%5Ee%5Eempiq.ob.html in Florida as head of marketing and product development. At Empire, Foreman met Charlie Emby who was head of sales for the company and Foreman's future business partner.  Play Along Toys  In 1999, Foreman and Emby both left Empire and co-founded Play Along Toyshttps://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl- xpm-1999-12-15-9912140444-story.html with an angel investment of $3M. Here, Foreman managed marketing, product development and sourcing. The company's first product line was a range of Britney Spears dollshttps://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct- xpm-1999-08-28-9908280088-story.html and toys modeled after the emerging pop star. Some of the other product lines from Play Along included the relaunch of Cabbage Patch Kidshttps://money.cnn.com/2004/08/16/news/newsmakers/cabbagepatch_kids/, Care Bears, Puppy in My Pocket, Doodle Bear, plus licensed lines including Lord of the Rings action figures. With the addition of these lines, Play Along's sales grew to over $130 Million by the end of 2003. The company's biggest hit came a few years later, in the form of a doll line based on Disney‚Äôs Hannah Montana TV showhttps://prev.dailyherald.com/story/?id=91322. In 2004, Play Along was sold to Jakks Pacific (NASDAQ:JAKK), and became a wholly owned division of that company https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/stories/2004/06/14/daily4.html. The total compensation for the deal was valued to be an excess of $135 Million if Play Along achieved all of its earnings targets over a 3.5-year earnout period, which it did. Play Along's sales peaked at $240 million in 2007. Foreman and his partners managed the division for Jakks Pacific until January 2008, when they exited the company.  Oaktree Capital Management  In 2008, Foreman was engaged by Oaktree Capital Management to advise on its plan to acquire and take private Jakks Pacific.https://www.reuters.com/article/us- jakkspacific-oaktree/oaktree-capital-seen-sealing-jakks-pacific-deal- idUSTRE78D0FL20110914 Under the terms of the arrangement, once acquired, Foreman would become the Jakks CEO. Together, Foreman and Oaktree pursued Jakks for three years but despite an offer to purchase the company, they failed to break the board's poison pill blockade and were unsuccessful in their acquisition efforts. During this time, Foreman on his own acquired Camp Beverly Hills, a 1980s clothing line.  The Bridge Direct / Basic Fun  In 2009, Foreman and Oaktree Capital Management founded The Bridge Direct, a consumer products company focused on children's entertainment productshttp://kidscreen.com/2009/10/01/thebridge-20091001/. The plan was to grow the company organically through internally conceived product lines, as well as through acquisitions. Initially, the company acted as a licensee and agent for Cepia LLC, maker of the world famous Zhu Zhu Pets toys. In 2010, The Bridge Direct launched its first internally conceived toy line by acquiring the licensing rights for pop star Justin Bieberhttps://www.sun- sentinel.com/business/fl-xpm-2010-10-22-fl-toy-story- vasquez-1018-20101022-story.html. Propelled by the singer's ascent to fame, the doll line quickly became a hit with fanshttps://money.cnn.com/2011/10/07/smallbusiness/justin_bieber_dolls/index.htm. Foreman began implementing his acquisition strategy for The Bridge Direct in 2013. His first target was the Good Stuff company and its Basic Fun Division, based in Jersey City, NJhttps://toybook.com/the-bridge-direct-acquires-good- stuff-corporation/. Good Stuff was a supplier of toys to the leisure industry), and the Basic Fun division was known for collectable key chains, novelty and retro toys. The acquisition in 2013 expanded The Bridge Direct's product offering and distribution. The retro toy line became a large part of the combined company's portfolio, including reproductions of classic toys like the Fisher-Price Chatter Phone and Hasbro's Lite-Brite and electronic Simon game. The company subsequently added more retro toys to its portfolio including classic reproductions of the original My Little Ponyhttps://www.goodhousekeeping.com/childrens-products/toy- reviews/news/a48004/my-little-pony-dolls-classic/ and Pound Puppies toyshttps://toybook.com/basic-fun-acquires-hasbros-tonka-license/, as well as a line of handheld electronic games including Pac-Man, Frogger, and The Oregon Trail https://geekdad.com/2018/09/basic-fun-classic-arcades-puts-the-oregon- trail-and-more-in-the-palm-of-your-hand/. In 2017, The Bridge Direct merged with Toronto-based Tech 4 Kidshttp://kidscreen.com/2017/02/21/tech-4-kids-and- the-bridge-direct-merge/, bringing the Mash'ems surprise collectible product line into the portfolio. The combined company later acquired Uncle Milton Industrieshttps://toybook.com/the-bridge-direct-and-tech-4-kids-purchase- uncle-milton-assets/, which manufactures STEM-related toys including Uncle Milton's Ant Farm. Later that year, the company rebranded itself as Basic Fun!https://www.licenseglobal.com/industry-news/tech-4-kids-bridge-direct- unveil-new-company-name In early 2018, the company acquired K'nex, the American-made construction toy brand which also manufactures Lincoln Logs and Tinker Toys, under license from Hasbro. https://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/news/2018/02/14/knex-maker-of-lincoln- logs-and-tinkertoys-sold-by.html In addition to its headquarters in Boca Raton, FL, Basic Fun! has a sales office in the UK (part of the K'nex acquisition) and an office and showroom in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong-based staff oversees engineering and manufacturing with China-based factories. In 2019, under the threat of import tariffs for products brought to the US from China, Foreman became an outspoken opponent of the Trump administration policy proposals, which would have added 10% duties to toys imported from China. https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/30/basic-fun-ceo-jay-foreman-to-keep-production- in-china-despite-trump.html  Other  As a part of his career in the toy industry, Foreman has served as a board member of Licensing International, formerly known as the Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association, and has served on the board of the Toy Industry Associationhttps://www.toyassociation.org/PressRoom2/News/2016_News/New_Dates_Announced_for_Fall_Toy_Preview_2017.aspx, as well as its charity foundation the Toy Industry Foundation. He is also on the board of the Florence Fuller Child Development Centershttps://www.ffcdc.org/who-we-are/board-of-directors/ and the Board of Trustees at the Pine Crest Schoolhttps://www.pinecrest.edu/faculty- detail?pk=77141&fromId;=214101. Foreman credits his grandfather Samuel Polack as his inspiration in business. A European immigrant who came to America in the early 1900s with his mother, Sam left school to work as a coal carrier on the railroad and a copy boy at a newspaper. He later worked as a coal miner in Pennsylvania, but left the coal mines during World War II to join the US Navy. After the war, Sam went to work for the United States Bureau of Mines where he developed products and procedures for mine safetyhttps://librarycatalog.dol.gov/client/en_US/wirtz/search/results?qu=samuel+polack&te;=ILS. He spent the second half of his career traveling coal country to educate miners and mine owners about new techniques in mine safety. Foreman also credits his mother, Joyce, for inspiring him in work and ethics. Ms. Foreman started her career at the Rockwell Manufacturing Company in Pittsburgh, PA. After moving to New Jersey in the early 1960s and raising a family, she went back to work as a marketing executive at the Sperry & Hutchinson company, marketing S&H; Green Stamps, and later at Citi Corp as VP of marketing for their industrial credit division.

Description Colouration very variable, especially in the female, from orange to red. =Male= left Upperside: white, base of wings generally irrorated (speckled), but to a varying extent, with black scales. This irroration in many specimens is entirely wanting. Forewing: with or without a minute black spot on the discocellulars; apex broadly carmine, edged internally and externally with black, this black border varies in width, but both inner and outer borders meet on the costa and on the termen, on the latter they unite and sometimes extend as a black line to the tornus. Hindwing: uniform, except for a series of black terminal spots, which in some specimens are comparatively large and connected together by an anteciliary slender black line, in others minute, more or less obsolescent, unconnected dots. Male in Hyderabad, India Underside: white. Forewing: base of cell washed with sulphur-yellow; spot on discocellulars as on the upperside; apical carmine area of the upperside represented by an ochraceous-pink patch, not margined with black, but similar in shape and position; in some specimens this is more or less suffused with greyish scales; in all, it is crossed near its inner edge by an obliquely placed series of four or five spots that vary in colour from pale ferruginous to black. In some specimens there are two terminal diffuse black spots, one each at the ends of veins 2 and 3. Hindwing: the ground colour generally lightly, often heavily, suffused with ochraceous pink, sometimes pure white; a small spot on the discocellulars pale ferruginous to black, sometimes annular and centred with carmine; followed by a curved macular discal band that also varies in colour from pale ferruginous to black and has the posterior spots often obsolescent, or even completely absent; a series of minute black dots at the apices of the veins that runs to the termen, and may or may not be connected by a slender black anteciliary line. Antennae pale brown, speckled with white; head, thorax and abdomen black; head and thorax anteriorly clothed with brown, sometimes greyish-black hairs; beneath: palpi, thorax and abdomen white. =Female= Upperside: white; base of wings lightly, often heavily, irrorated with greyish-black scales. In some specimens the irroration is very scanty, in others it occupies fully a third of the wings from base and extends as a broad band parallel to the dorsum on the hindwing. Forewing: an apical carmine patch as in the male but smaller, sometimes reduced to a mere row of preapical pale rosy streaks, but always bordered externally, and generally internally also, by black of varying width.

The OBO Foundry establishes a set of principles for ontology development for creating a suite of interoperable reference ontologies in the biomedical domain. Currently, there are more than a hundred ontologies that follow the OBO Foundry principles. The OBO Foundry effort makes it easier to integrate biomedical results. It does so by offering a structured reference for terms of different research fields and their interconnections (ex: a phenotype in a mouse model and its related phenotype in zebrafish).  Introduction  The Foundry initiative aims at improving the integration of data in the life sciences. One approach to integration is the annotation of data from different sources using controlled vocabularies. Ideally, such controlled vocabularies take the form of ontologies, which support logical reasoning over the data annotated using the terms in the vocabulary. The formalization of concepts in the biomedical domain is especially known via the work of the Gene Ontology Consortium, a part of the OBO Foundry. This has led to the development of certain proposed principles of good practice in ontology development, which are now being put into practice within the framework of the Open Biomedical Ontologies consortium through its OBO Foundry initiative. OBO ontologies form part of the resources of the National Center for Biomedical Ontology, where they form a central component of the NCBO's BioPortal.  Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies  The Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies (OBO; formerly Open Biomedical Ontologies) is an effort to create ontologies (controlled vocabularies) for use across biological and medical domains. A subset of the original OBO ontologies has started the OBO Foundry, which leads the OBO efforts since 2007. The creation of OBO in 2001 was largely inspired by the efforts of the Gene Ontology project. OBO forms part of the resources of the U.S. National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBIO) and a central element of the NCBO's BioPortal. It is an initiative led by the OBO Foundry.  Rules for participation  The OBO Foundry is open to participations of any interested individuals. Ontologies that intend to be officially part of the OBO Foundry have to adhere to the OBO principles and pass a series of reviews done by the members, when \\"the Foundry coordinators serve as analogs of journal editors\\". There are ontologies that follow OBO principles but are not officially part of OBO, such as eagle-i's Reagent Application Ontology. and the Animals in Context Ontology. An integration into OBO of the OntoClean's theory of rigidity has been proposed as a step to standardize candidate ontologies. This integration would make it easier to develop software to automatically check candidates.  Tools  The OBO Foundry community is also dedicated to developing tools to facilitate creating and maintaining ontologies. Most ontology developers in OBO use the Prot√©g√© ontology editor and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) for building ontologies. To facilitate command line management of ontologies in a Prot√©g√©- and OWL- compatible format, the OBO Foundry has developed the tool ROBOT (ROBOT is an OBO Tool). ROBOT aggregates functions for routine tasks in ontology development, is open source, and can be used either via the command line or as a library for any language on the Java Virtual Machine. Other tool related to the OBO effort is OBO-Edit, an ontology editor and reasoner funded by the Gene Ontology Consortium. There are also plugins for OBO-Edit which facilitate the development of ontologies, such as the semi-automatic ontology generator DOG4DAG. The OBO file format The OBO file format is a biology-oriented language for building ontologies. It is based on the principles of Web Ontology Language (OWL). As a community effort, standard common mappings have been created for lossless roundtrip transformations between Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) format and OWL. The research contains methodical examination of each of the constructs of OBO and a layer cake for OBO, similar to the Semantic Web stack.  OBO Foundry Ontologies  The initial set of OBO Foundry ontologies was composed by mature ontologies (such as the Gene Ontology, GO, and the Foundational Model of Anatomy, FMAO), by mergers of previously existing ontologies (ex: the Cell Ontology, CL, formed from different dedicated ontologies, and related parts on GO and FMAO) and by development of new ontologies based on its principles. The original set of ontologies also included the Zebrafish Anatomical Ontology (a part of the Zebrafish Information Network), the CheBI ontology, the Disease Ontology, the Plant Ontology, the Sequence Ontology, the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations and the Protein Ontology. The number of ontologies in OBO has grown to the order of hundreds, and they are gathered in the list of OBO Foundry ontologies.  OBO Foundry and Wikidata  A number of different OBO Foundry ontologies have also been integrated to the Wikidata knowledge graph. This has led to the integration of OBO structured ontologies to data from other, non-OBO databases . For example, the integration of the Human Disease Ontology to Wikidata has enabled its link to the description of cell-lines from the resource Cellosaurus. One of the goals of the integration of OBO Foundry to Wikidata has been to lower the barriers for non-ontologists to contribute to and use ontologies. Wikidata is arguably easier to understand and use than the traditional ontology models (which require a high degree of specific expertise).  Principles.  Summary of OBO Foundry Principles for development of an OBO-compatible life sciences ontology: = Openess = The ontologies are openly available and have to be released under either the license CC-BY 3.0 or under the public domain (CC0). The openess of the ontologies has enabled, for example, the import of terms from the Gene Ontology (one of the ontologies that follow OBO Principles) to the Wikidata project. = Common format = The ontologies have to be available in a common formal language. In practice, that means that ontologies that are part of the OBO foundry need to describe items unsing the formats OWL/OWL2 or OBO using a RDF/XML syntax to maximize interoperability. = Orthogonality = Mapping from OBO IDs to OBO Unified Resource Identifiers (URIs), unique for each item. Terms should be unique in the OBO space, meaning that each item has a unique ontology prefix (such as CHEBI, GO, PRO) and a local numeric identifier within the ontology. The choice of a numerical ID was made in order to improve maintenance and evolution of the resources. In order to participate in OBO Foundry, ontologies have to be orthogonal and the concepts it models must be unique within OBO, so each concept has a single Universal Resource Identifier (URI). New ontologies have, then, to reuse work done in other efforts. Despite the ideal of uniqueness of terms and interoperability, in practice, this is difficult to enforce, leading to the occurrence of term duplication. Furthermore, some ontologies do not reuse terms or even reuse terms inappropriately. = Versioning = Ontologies evolve in time, refining concepts and descriptions according to advances in the knowledge of their specific domains. In order to ensure that new versions are updated, but tools that use older version of the ontologies are still function, OBO enforces a system of versioning systems, with each ontology version receiving a unique identifier, either in the format of a date or a numbering system, and metadata dags. = Scope = The ontologies should have a clearly specified scope (the domain it intends to cover). = Have textual definitions = The ontologies should have textual definitions for each item, in a human-readable way. That means that beside the alphanumeric identification for each item, they should be described in natural language by logical affirmations following the Aristotelian logic in a way that is unique within the ontology. = Standardized relations and the Relation Ontology (RO) = The ontologies should use relations between items from the Relations Ontology (RO). This ensures that different ontologies can integrated seamlessly, which is specially important for logical inference. The Relation Ontology (RO) is an ontology designed to represent the relationships between different biomedical concepts. It describes rigorously relations like \\"part_of\\", \\"located_in\\" and \\"preceded_by\\" that are reused by many OBO Foundry ontologies. = Documentation = OBO ontologies need to be thoroughly documented. Frequently this is done via GitHub repositories for each specific ontologies (see List of OBO Foundry ontologies). = Plurality of users = The ontologies should be useful for multiple different people, and ontology developers should document the evidence of use. This criterion is important for the review process. Examples of use include linking to terms by other ontologies, use in semantic web projects, use in annotations or other research applications. = Openness to collaborations = The ontologies should be developed in a way that allows collaborations with other OBO Foundry members. = Locus of authority = The ontologies should have one person responsible for the ontology who mediates interaction with the community. = Naming conventions = Naming conventions for OBO ontologies aim at making primary labels unambiguous and unique inside the ontology (and preferably, inside OBO). Labels and synonyms should be written in English, avoiding the use of underscores and camel case. OBO lacks a mechanism for multilangual support, in contrats to Wikidata, which allows labels in different systems. The naming system in OBO is based on a series of surveys at cataloguing naming conventions of current ontologies, as well as discover issues relating to these conventions. = Maintenance = The ontologies should be updated with regards to changes in scientific consensus. The OBO Foundry defines scientific consensus as \\"multiple publications by independent labs over a year come to the same conclusion, and there is no or limited (<10%) dissenting opinions published in the same time frame.\\"  See also  * Ontology Lookup Service * Gene Ontology Consortium * Sequence Ontology * Generic Model Organism Databases * Functional Genomics Data (FGED) * Ontology for Biomedical Investigations * Plant ontology * Phenoscape * List of OBO Foundry ontologies * eagle-i * CHEBI  References   External links  *OBO Foundry *The ROBOT tool *NCBO's BioPortal *First set of OBO Foundry ontologies. *Barry Smith's course on bio-ontologies and the slide-deck about OBO Foundry. *MIBBI (Minimum Information for Biological and Biomedical Investigations) *Ontology Lookup Service website *Ontology browser for most of the Open Biological Ontologies at BRENDA website *PubOnto: OBO-based literature search tool *ONTO-PERL *SimCT Web-based tool to display relationships between biological objects annotated to an ontology in the form of a tree, based on their annotation similarity.

Etymology The genus name comes from the Latin Pulmoa meaning lung and was first used by Leonhart Fuchs (1501 ‚Äì 1566), a German physician and one of the three founding fathers of botany. The species was named officinalis by Carl Linnaeus for the medical properties of these plants, used since the Middle Ages to treat coughs and diseases of the chest, because of the doctrine of signatures whereby Christian doctors believed that plants that resemble any body part could be used to treat illnesses in this part since God put his signature in the plant to guide mankind. Description Botanical sketch of Pulmonaria officinalis showing seeds, from Flora von Deutschland, √ñsterreich und der Schweiz 1885 Thom√© The basal leaves are green, cordate, more or less elongated and pointed and always with rounded and often sharply defined white or pale green patches. The upper surface of the leaves has tiny bumps and it is quite hairy. The leaves of this host plant are eaten by the caterpillars of the moth Ethmia pusiella. In spring, the plant produces small bunches of flowers. The 5-petal flowers are red or pink at first, later turn to blue- purple during the anthesis, by changing the pH value inside of the petals. As a matter of fact the flowers contain a dye that belongs to the anthocyanins and change the color from red (acidic) to blue (alkaline). Pulmonaria officinalis is diploid and has the chromosome number 2n = 14. Flowering period extends from March through May and the seeds ripen from May to June. Pollination is granted by insects (entomophily) - mainly bees, bumblebees and butterflies - the spread of seeds over ants. Distribution This native species is perhaps the most widespread plant in Europe. It is distributed west in the Ardennes up to the Netherlands, Denmark and southern Sweden. It is missing in Norway and it is only naturalized in the British Isles. It reaches central Russia and the Caucasus and it occurs in the Balkans and in northern to central Italy. Habitat It grows in deciduous and beech mixed forests from the lowlands to the mountains. It prefers fresh and shady areas, nutrient-rich and mostly calcareous, stony or pure clay loam soils, at an altitude of above sea level.

It is dedicated to the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. As an architectural complex, it is characterized by the presence of different styles, due to a long history of additions, alterations and restorations, the last of which occurred in the 18th century. History The main fa√ßade, connected with arcades to the Archbishops' Palace The church was erected in 1185 by Walter Ophamil (or Walter of the Mill), the Anglo-Norman archbishop of Palermo and King William II's minister, on the area of an earlier Byzantine basilica. By all accounts this earlier church was founded by Pope Gregory I and was later turned into a mosque by the Saracens after their conquest of the city in the 9th century. Ophamil is buried in a sarcophagus in the church's crypt. The medieval edifice had a basilica plan with three apses, of which only some minor architectural elements survive today. The upper orders of the corner towers were built between the 14th and the 15th centuries, while in the early Renaissance period the southern porch was added. The present neoclassical appearance dates from the work carried out over the two decades 1781 to 1801, supervised by Ferdinando Fuga and Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia. During this period the great retable by Gagini, decorated with statues, friezes and reliefs, was destroyed and the sculptures moved to different parts of the basilica. Also by Fuga are the great dome emerging from the main body of the building, and the smaller domes covering the aisles' ceilings. Overview The western entrance is on the current Via Matteo Bonello, and has the appearance set in the 14th and 15th centuries. It is flanked by two towers and has a Gothic portal surmounted by a niche with a precious 15th-century Madonna. Two lintelled ogival arcades, stepping over the street, connect the western fa√ßade to the bell tower, which is annexed to the Archbishops Palace (now Museo Diocesano). This has a squared appearance adorned in the upper part by a fine crown of smaller belfries and small arcades. The south side has outstretching turrets and a wide portico (the current main entrance) in Gothic-Catalan style, with three arcades, erected around 1465 and opening to the square. The first column on the left belonged to the original basilica and the subsequent mosque, as testified by the Qur'an verse carved on it. The carved portal of this entrance was executed in the period 1426 to 1430 by Antonio Gambara, while the magnificent wooden leaves are by Francesco Miranda (1432). The mosaic portraying the Madonna is from the 13th century, while the two monuments on the walls, works of the early 18th century, represents King Charles III of Bourbon and Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia, both of which were crowned here, the latter with his wife Anne Marie d'Orl√©ans in December 1713. The area of the apse, enclosed by the turrets and grandly decorated on the external walls, is part of the original 12th-century building, while the more modern part of the church is the left side, which has an early 16th-century portal by Antonello Gagini. The South- Western fa√ßade, looking at the Archbishop Palace, dates from the 14th to 15th centuries. The sarcophagus of Emperor Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The interior has a Latin cross plan, with a nave and two aisles divided by pilasters. In the first two chapels of the right aisle are the tomb of emperors and royal figures moved here in the 18th century from their original sites (mostly from the basilica itself). Here are the remains of Emperor Henry VI, his son Frederick II, as well as those of Peter II of Sicily. A Roman sarcophagus is the tomb of Constance of Aragon, Frederick's wife. Under the mosaic baldachins are the tombs of Roger II, the first King of Sicily, and his daughter Constance. The last two were once located in the transept of the Cathedral of Cefal√π. The Baroque small side cupolas by Ferdinando Fuga. The famous portico by Antonio Gambara The Sacrament chapel, at the end of the left aisles, is decorated with precious stones and lapislazuli. To the right, in the presbytery, is the chapel of Saint Rosalia, patron of Palermo, closed by a richly ornamental bronze gate, with relics and a 17th-century silver urn which is object of particular devotion. The window over the west entrance; you can see one of the two arcades that connect the western fa√ßade to the opposite bell tower. The 1466 Gothic-Catalan style wooden choir and the marble remains of the Gagini's retable (removed during the 18th-century alterations) are also precious, as well as a marble statue of the Madonna with Child by Francesco Laurana and pupils (1469The sculpture is commonly known as Madonna Libera Inferni (\\"free from Hell\\"). It received this name in 1576, when Pope Gregory XIII gave indulgence for the Purgatory's souls to the altar in which it is placed. The sculpture was intended for the church of Monte San Giuliano in Trapani, but remained here as the Palermitani refused to deprive themselves of such a beautiful art work.), a 13th-century polychrome Crucifix by Manfredi Chiaramonte, the holy water stoup on the fourth pilaster (by Domenico Gagini) and the Madonna della Scala by Antonello Gagini, on the high altar of the new sacristy. The Relics Chapel contains the relics of St. Christina, St. Ninfa, St. Cosma, St. Agatha and St. Mamilianus, first patron of Palermo. La S. Vergine con il Bambino inside the cathedral by Antonio Filocamo. The crypt, accessed from the left side, is an evocative room with cross vault supported by granite columns, housing tombs and sarcophagi of Roman, Byzantine and Norman ages. People buried here include archbishops Walter Ophamil, the church's founder, and Giovanni Patern√≤, patron of Antonello Gagini who sculpted the image on his tomb. The Cathedral Treasury contains goblets, vestments, monstrances, a 14th-century breviary and the famous Crown of Constance of Sicily, a golden tiara found in her tomb in 1491. The Cathedral has a meridian, which may be considered as an earlier type of heliometer (solar \\"observatory\\"), one of a number constructed in Italian churches, mainly in the 17th and 18th centuries. This one was built in 1801 by the famous astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi, the director of the Observatory of Palermo who discovered the first minor planet or asteroid, Ceres. The device itself is quite simple: a tiny hole in one of the minor domes acts as pinhole camera, projecting an image of the sun onto the floor ). There is a bronze line, la meridiana on the floor, running precisely N/S. At solar noon (circa 12:00 in winter, 13:00 in summer), the sun image passes through this line. At different times of the year the passage occurs at different point of the line. The ends of the line mark the positions at the summer and winter solstices; signs of the zodiac show various dates throughout the year. The purpose of the instrument was to standardise the measurement of time and the calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24-hour) day was measured from the moment of sun-rise, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to know when the Vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter. On the belltowers there were six medieval bells. The instrument could be used for research on the apparent movements of the Sun, including its relative distance from the Earth, measured through the size of the floor projected solar disk, and even to compare the results with Ptolemaic and Copernician predictions.John L. Heilbron, The Sun in the Church, Harvard, 1999.  17th and 19th century renovations  The church is composed of different styles, as in the following centuries it underwent various changes. The last was at the end of the 18th century, when it radically remade the interior designed by Ferdinando Fuga. In 1767, the archbishop Filangieri had entrusted to Ferdinand the restoration of the building. The work began only in 1781, carried out not by Ferdinand but by Palermitan Giuseppe Venanzio Marvuglia and lasted until the 19th century. The reworkings by Marvuglia were in reality much more invasive and radical than the projects of the Florentine architect, who thought instead of keeping, at least in part, the complex of longitudinal aisles and the original wooden ceiling. The restoration intervened to change the original appearance of the complex, providing the church of the characteristic but discordant dome, performed according to the designs of Ferdinando Fuga.Enciclopedia universale, pp.32-34. A second font was added in 1797, by Fillipo and Gaetano Pennino. It is supported by sculptures depicting the Tree of Knowledge and Adam and Eve. This font is the subject of a poem by Letitia Elizabeth Landon, which was published posthumously in 1840.  Royal and Imperial burials  In the right aisle, in the first and second chapel communicating with one another, are the monumental tombs of King Roger II, his daughter Queen Constance I of Sicily, her husband Emperor Henry VI, and their son Emperor Frederick II, as well as the burials of Frederick's first wife Constance of Aragon and his great-great- grandson William II, Duke of Athens on the side walls. The four main sarcophagi, all in porphyry, form a group that also includes that of William I of Sicily in Monreale Cathedral. They \\"are the very first examples of medieval free-standing secular tombs in the West, and therefore play a unique role within the history of Italian sepulchral art (earlier and later tombs are adjacent to, and dependent on walls).\\" It is likely that the four sarcophagi of William I (in Monreale), Constance, Henry and Frederick were carved by a local Sicilian workshop from a single Roman column shaft, possibly from the Baths of Caracalla or the Baths of Diocletian in Rome. They ostensibly took inspiration from the porphyry sarcophagi of late Roman Emperors that were still visible in the 12th century in the Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople, including those of Constantine the Great and his successors up to Marcian as described by Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus in the De Ceremoniis, four of which now stand in front of the ƒ∞stanbul Archaeology Museums' main building. The sarcophagus of Frederick II is surmounted by a canopy with porphyry columns and the urn is supported by two pairs of lions, together with those of Frederick II were also preserved the remains of Peter II of Sicily. Odo of Bayeux, half-brother of William the Conqueror, was buried in the cathedral in 1097.ODNB Aside from burials, Vittorio Amedeo II of Savoy and Charles III of Spain were crowned in the cathedral.  The treasure of the cathedral  Byzantine corona (kamelaukion) of Constance of Aragon, wife of Frederick II king of Germany and Sicily. The \\"treasure of the cathedral\\", which is composed of sacred vestments from the 16th and 18th centuries, frontals, monstrances, chalices, a breviary with miniatures of the 15th century and the gold tiara of Constance of Aragon. Other precious objects, enamels, embroidery and jewelry, are exposed in central message boards such as for example the breviary parchment of the 1452 coat of arms with an Archbishop Simon from Bologna.

He was re-elected as a Country Party candidate in 1921 and re- elected (unopposed) several times until his resignation in 1936. He was deputy leader of the Country Party in 1927‚Äì1930, leader in 1933‚Äì1935 and deputy leader again in 1935‚Äì1936.

Post retirement he served as race director of the London Marathon until 2012, and is the Chairman of the IAAF Road Running Commission (since 2012), as well as sitting on the IAAF Cross Country Committee as the UK Athletics elected representative. Bedford held the 10,000 metres world record, improving it by 7.6 seconds with his time of 27 minutes 30.80 seconds in 1973. He also held the British records for 3000 m steeplechase and 5000 metres. He usually ran in distinctive red socks, which later led to a well publicised dispute about the use of similarly attired runners in advertisements. Athletic career Bedford was born in London. He was a leading distance runner during the 1970s but his achievements were largely against the clock; in championships his lack of a fast final lap left him trailing at the tape. He led for lap after lap in the 1971 European 10,000 m final but the pack swept past him. He finished sixth to the Flying Finn Juha V√§√§t√§inen, who won in a last lap sprint against East Germany's J√ºrgen Haase. He came twelfth in the 5000 m and sixth in the 10,000 m at the 1972 Munich Olympics.Dave Bedford . sports-reference.com His later career was hampered by injuries, believed to have been caused by his high training mileage. He never ran the great marathon of which many fans thought him capable. He did run the first London Marathon in 1981 but only as the result of a bet. He had been in a nightclub the previous night where David Coleman had remarked on how unwell he looked. Having consumed a curry on the way home from the nightclub, Bedford completed the impromptu marathon but was pictured vomiting at the roadside part way through. However, later in the same year he did manage to win the London Cross Country title at the age of 31. Post retirement In 2003, Bedford was involved in a legal dispute over the alleged portrayal of his image by the directory enquiries company The Number for its 118 118 service. The company had used a pair of athletes wearing red socks and Bedford's distinctive moustache and hair cut. He was quoted as saying, \\"The bastards! You can use that word and say I said it. [They] used my image then said they had never heard of me. When they were told they couldn't use it any more they said 'Oh no it was all a big misunderstanding'. To get to that stage took ¬£60,000 in legal fees.\\"'Recognise David Bedford? If so, it could be because of those 'cheapskates from 118', 'The London Paper, 20 April 2007, p. 36. In January 2004, Ofcom's Content Board ruled that The Number had breached rule 6.5 of the Advertising Standards Code, by caricaturing him without permission. However, it declined to issue an order banning advertisements in question on the grounds that a ban would be disproportionately damaging to The Number compared with any harm to the feelings or reputation of David Bedford suffered as a result of the advertisements. In 2004, Bedford crashed the launch of a new 118 118 TV ad campaign. Photos of Bedford being removed made the covers of The Times and Financial Times. Bedford was president of the Road Runners Club from 2003 to 2006. Bedford now hosts the Radlett Rotary Fun Run every year. In 2011 Bedford received an honorary doctorate from Middlesex University. Runner's World described Bedford as \\"a key architect\\" of the 2012 Olympic Marathon Course.

In addition, a segment north of the airport exists without state or county designation. Congress Avenue, like the paralleling Military Trail and Jog Road, is a popular commuting alternative to often-congested Interstate 95, Florida's Turnpike, and U.S. Route 1 in Palm Beach County. Route description =County Road 807= Congress Avenue and CR 807 begin at the intersection with Yamato Road (SR 794), near the Boca Raton Tri-Rail Station. Proceeding north, it intersects exit 50 of I-95 and a park & ride via a connecting segment. The road jogs east, becoming increasingly closer to the interstate highway as the roads continue north. The road passes through Delray Beach and Boynton Beach, serving a number of malls, shopping centers, and local businesses, especially concentrated around Atlantic Avenue (SR 806) and Boynton Beach Boulevard (SR 804). In Boynton, the road intersects Gateway Boulevard near the Renaissance Commons, a shopping center and restaurant locale built on the former site of a Motorola plant. In Lake Worth, the next major intersection, is with Hypoluxo Road, which leads to a number of public schools. The busy intersection with Congress and County Road 812 (Lantana Road) sits at the southwest corner of Palm Beach County Park Airport, locally known as Lantana Airport. Now in Lantana, the boulevard passes the JFK Medical Center. At Lake Worth Road (SR 802), CR 807 and SR 807 begins (this transition previously occurred at Lantana Road). Although the county road segment is the longest, the county road designation itself is rarely referred to when giving verbal directions. =State Road 807= State Road 807 begins at the intersection with Lake Worth Road (SR 802). On the southeastern corner is a local campus of Palm Beach State College. Proceeding north, SR 807 enters Palm Springs and intersects Forest Hill Boulevard (SR 882) before clipping the western corner of Glen Ridge and entering West Palm Beach.

Above is annaprashan samskara celebrating a baby's first taste of solid food. Sanskara (IAST: , sometimes spelled samskara) are rites of passage in a human being's life described in ancient Sanskrit texts, as well as a concept in the karma theory of Indian philosophies. The word literally means \\"putting together, making perfect, getting ready, to prepare\\", or \\"a sacred or sanctifying ceremony\\" in ancient Sanskrit and Pali texts of India. In the context of karma theory, Sanskara are dispositions, character or behavioral traits, that exist as default from birth or prepared and perfected by a person over one's lifetime, that exist as imprints on the subconscious according to various schools of Hindu philosophy such as the Yoga school. These perfected or default imprints of karma within a person, influences that person's nature, response and states of mind.Stephen H. Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 3 In another context, Sanskara refers to the diverse rites of passage in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism.David Knipe (2015), Vedic Voices: Intimate Narratives of a Living Andhra Tradition, Oxford University Press, , page 52KE Nayar (2004), The Sikh Diaspora in Vancouver, University of Toronto Press, , page 88Dagmar Benner (2008), in Mathematics and Medicine in Sanskrit (Editor: Dominik Wujastyk), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 122-123 In Hinduism, the sanskaras vary in number and details according to regional traditions. They range from the list of 40 sanskaras in the Gautama Dharmasutra from about the middle of 1st millennium BCE, to 16 sanskaras in the Grhyasutra texts from centuries later.Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, , pages 93-94 The list of sanskaras in Hinduism include both external rituals such as those marking a baby's birth and a baby's name giving ceremony, as well as inner rites of resolutions and ethics such as compassion towards all living beings and positive attitude. Etymology and meaning Sa·πÉskƒÅra (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞) has various context driven meanings, that broadly refer to \\"the putting together, accomplishing well, making perfect, a form of solemn recognition and getting ready, engaging in works and acknowledging the purification of body by cleansing or mind by education or an object by a process (such as polishing a gem or refining a metal)\\".saMskAra Monier- Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany The term appears in the ≈örutis, and in the Smritis of diverse schools of Hinduism as well as the texts of Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. The etymological roots of the word samskara when it refers to rites of passage, is also \\"preparation, purifying, perfecting\\" from one's past state to one's future state. The word samskara is rare in oldest layer of Vedic literature, but its roots sam and kr occur often enough. The word appears in Rig Veda hymns 6.28.4 and 8.33.9, as well as other Vedic texts, where the context suggests it simply means \\"purify, prepare\\". It appears in Jaimini Purvamimamsa-sutra (500-200 BCE) many times, where it again means \\"prepare, perfect, polish\\" something, either through action, speech or mind.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 15-16 In sections 3.8.3, 9.3.25 and 10.2.49 of the Jaimini Purvamimamsa-sutra, the word sanskara is used to describe actions of \\"washing the teeth, shaving the head, cutting nails, sprinkling water\\" as part of a ceremony.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 190-191 Samskara is defined by ancient Indian scholar Shabara as, \\"that which prepares a certain thing or person fit for a certain purpose\\". Another ancient text Viramitrodaya defines samskara, notes Kane, as \\"a peculiar excellence due to performance of certain actions which resides in the soul or the body of the actor\\". Sanskara in Hindu traditions, states Kane, have been ceremonies, with the expression of outward symbols or signs of inner change, marking life events of significance. They served a spiritual, cultural and psychological purpose, welcoming an individual into a stage of life, conferring privileges to the individual(s), expecting duties from the individual, and impressing on the individual as well individual's social circle of his or her new role.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 192-193 SanskƒÅra, in modern usage, is sometimes used to mean \\"cultural, social or religious heritage\\".KK Sinha (2006), Social And Cultural Ethos Of India, , pages 1-2 Samskara as a psychological concept In the context of karma theory, Samskara are dispositions, character or behavioral traits either as default from birth (previous lives in some schools of Hinduism), or Samskara are behavioral traits perfected over time through Yoga, through conscious shaping of inner self, one's desire, sense of moral responsibility and through practice.Ian Whicher (1999), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, SUNY Press, , pages 100-102 In some schools of Hinduism, the psychological concept of Sanskara is also known as vƒÅsanƒÅ.vAsanA Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionary, GermanyStephen Philips (2014), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, , page 134 These are viewed as traces or temperament that evolves through the refinement of an individual inner consciousness and expressed personality, and is a form of \\"being-preparedness\\" in Vedantic psychology. In Samkhya and Yoga schools, Sanskara ‚Äì also spelled as Samksara ‚Äì are impressions or residues that affect an individual's Gunas (behavior attributes). In Nyaya school of Hinduism, not all Samskara are psychological. Rites of passage, other actions, studies, diligent preparation and inner resolutions trigger impressions or dispositions in the psyche of an individual, in these schools of Hinduism, and these influence how the individual acts, perceives self and the manner in which the individual responds to or accepts the karmic circumstances and the future.Stephen Philips (2014), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, , pages 7-46, 134, 163-170 Samskara as rituals Sanskaras in Hinduism are rites of passage that begin with one's birth, celebrates certain early steps in a baby's growth and his or her welcome into the world in the presence of friends and family, then various stages of life (Ashrama (stage)) such as first learning day, graduation from school, wedding and honeymoon, pregnancy, raising a family, as well as those related to final rites associated with cremation.J√∂rg Gengnagel and Ute H√ºsken (2005), Words and Deeds: Hindu and Buddhist Rituals in South Asia, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , see Preface Chapter These rites of passage are not uniform, and vary within the diverse traditions of Hinduism. Some may involve formal ceremonies, yajna (fire) ceremonies with the chanting of Vedic hymns. Others are simple, private affairs involving a couple, with or without friends, other family families or a religious person such as priest or pandit. Sanskaras are not considered as end in themselves, but are means of social recognition as well as the passage of a person from one significant stage of life to another. Various elements of Sanskaras and rituals of life's passage are mentioned in Vedas of Hinduism, one of the oldest known scriptures in the world. The most extensive, but divergent discussions of these rites of passage are found in the numerous Dharmasutras and Grhyasutras from the 1st millennium BCE.Joyce Flueckiger, Everyday Hinduism, John Wiley & Sons, , pages 169-191David Knipe (2015), Vedic Voices: Intimate Narratives of a Living Andhra Tradition, Oxford University Press, , pages 32-37 Many of these rites of passage include formal ceremonies, with ritual readings of hymns, chants and ethical promises, aiming to orient the individual(s) to that which is considered part of dharma (right, good, just, moral, true, spiritual, responsible, duties to family members or society in general), and essential actions such as those associated with last rites and cremation, charitable works, or out of sraddha or items of faith.Mary McGee (2007), Samskara, in The Hindu World (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, , pages 332-356 =The purpose= Gautama Dharmasutra enumerates a large list of \\"forty outer karma samskaras\\" and \\"eight inner karma samskara (good qualities)\\", all of whom have the purpose of empowering a human being to discover, recognize and reach union with the Brahma-Atman (his or her Soul, Self, Highest Being).Rajbali Pandey (1969, reprint 2003). The Hindu Sacraments (Sa·πÅskƒÅra) in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) The Cultural Heritage of India, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 31-33 The ultimate purpose is to inculcate virtues, and samskaras are viewed in the Hindu tradition as means ‚Äì not as ends ‚Äì towards ripening and perfecting the human journey of life. The eight good qualities listed by Gautama Dharmasutra are emphasized as more important than the forty samskara rituals, in verses 8.21-8.25, as follows, =The 40 Samskaras= The Gautama Dharmasutra list the following forty rituals as outer samskaras:Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio- religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 20 *Garbhadhana (pregnancy), Pumsavana (rite celebrating the fetus, many translate it as quickening a male fetus), Simantonnayana (parting of pregnant woman's hair in 8th month), Jatakarman (rite celebrating the birth), Namakarana (naming the child), Annaprashana (baby's first feeding of solid food), Choulam (baby's first haircut, tonsure), and Upanayana (entry into school rite);Brian Smith (1986), Ritual, Knowledge, and Being: Initiation and Veda Study in Ancient India, Numen, Vol. 33, Fasc. 1, pages 65-89 *the four vows associated with Vedic study; *graduation ritual at the conclusion of school; *marriage sva-dharma rite; *five sacrifices to gods, ancestors, humans, spirits, and all knowledge; *seven remembrances and donations (sacrifices) using cooked food, in the form of ancestral offerings *seven remembrances and donations (sacrifices) in the presence of fire (yajna), to mark harvests, seasons and deities *seven kinds of Soma sacrifices: agnistoma, atyagnistoma, ukthya, sodasin, vajapeya, atiratra and aptoryama. To obtain union with Brahman, one must also possess the eight virtues (compassion, patience, non-envy, purity of thought speech and body, inner calm and peace, positive attitude, generosity, and lack of possessiveness). =The 16 Sanskaras= There are diverse number of Sanskaras in Hinduism, varying by texts between 12 and 18 in the Grhyasutras (Kalpa sastras). Of these, 16 are referred to as \\"Shodasha Samskaras\\" ().Rajbali Pandey (1969, reprint 2003). The Hindu Sacraments (Sa·πÅskƒÅra) in S. Radhakrishnan (ed.) The Cultural Heritage of India, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 23 Intent to have a child ritual, Garbhadhana Garbhadhana (IAST: GarbhƒÅdhƒÅna, Sanskrit: ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§≠‡§æ‡§ß‡§æ‡§®), also called Garbhalambhanam, literally means attaining the wealth of the womb. It is a private rite of passage, marking the intent of a couple to have a child. It is a ceremony performed before conception and impregnation.garbhAdhAna&direction;=SE&script;=HK&link;=yes&beginning;=0 niSeka Sanskrit - English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany In some ancient texts, the word simply refers to the rite of passage where the couple have sex to have a child, and no ceremonies are mentioned. Scholars trace this rite to Vedic hymns, such as those in sections 8.35.10 through 8.35.12 of the Rigveda, where repeated prayers for progeny and prosperity are solemnized,Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio- religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 48-56 with footnotes The Vedic texts have many passages, where the hymn solemnizes the desire for having a child, without specifying the gender of the child. For example, the Rigveda in section 10.184 states, The desire for progeny, without mentioning gender, is in many other books of the Rigveda, such as the hymn 10.85.37. The Atharva Veda, similarly in verse 14.2.2, states a ritual invitation to the wife, by her husband to mount the bed for conception, \\"being happy in mind, here mount the bed; give birth to children for me, your husband\\". Later texts, such as the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in the last chapter detailing the education of a student, include lessons for his Grihastha stage of life.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 534-539 There, the student is taught, that as a husband, he should cook rice for the wife, and they together eat the food in certain way depending on whether they wish for the birth of a daughter or a son, as follows, The different Grhyasutras differ in their point of view, whether the garbhadhana is to be performed only once, before the first conception, or every time before the couple plan to have additional children.Rajbali Pandey (1969), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, , pages 56‚Äì58 To answer this question, the medieval era texts of various schools discussed and offered diverse views on whether the ritual is a rite of passage for the baby's anticipation in the womb (garbha), or for the wife (kshetra). A rite of passage of the baby would imply that Garbhadhana sanskara is necessary for each baby and therefore every time the couple intend to have a new baby, while a rite of passage of the wife would imply a one time ritual suffices. Nurturing the Fetus rite: Pumsavana Pumsavana (IAST: pu·πÉsavana, Sanskrit: ‡§™‡•Å‡§Ç‡§∏‡§µ‡§®) is a composite word of Pums + savana. Pums as a noun means \\" a man, a human being, a soul or spirit\\", while savana means \\"ceremony, rite, oblation, festival\\".puMs and savana Monier- Williams' Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany Pumsavana literally means \\"rite for a strong or male baby\\", usually translated as \\"nurturing a male fetus, bringing forth a male baby\\".Mary McGee (2007), Samskara, in The Hindu World (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, , page 335 It is a ritual conducted when the pregnancy begins to show, typically in or after the third month of pregnancy and usually before the fetus starts moving in the womb. The ceremony celebrates the rite of passage of the developing fetus, marking the stage where the baby begins to kick as a milestone in a baby's development. The roots of the pumsavana ritual are found in section 4.3.23 and 4.6.2 of the Atharva Veda, wherein charms are recited for a baby boy.Maurice Bloomfield, , Oxford University Press, pages 97-99 The Atharva Veda also contains charms to be recited for the birth of a child of either gender and the prevention of miscarriages, such as in section 4.6.17. The ritual is performed in diverse ways, but all involve the husband serving something to the expectant wife. In one version, she is fed a paste mixture of yoghurt, milk and ghee (clarified butter) by him.Ute H√ºsken, Will Sweetman and Manfred Kr√ºger (2009), Vi·π£·πáu's Children: Prenatal Life-cycle Rituals in South India, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , page 123 In another version, the pumsavana ritual is more elaborate, done in the presence of yajna fire and vedic chants, where the husband places a drop of Banyan leaf extract in the wife's right nostril for a son, and her left nostril for a daughter, followed by a feast for all present.Helene Stork (Editor: Julia Leslie), Roles and Rituals for Hindu Women, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 92-93B Rama Rao, , Vol. 33-34, page 153 The time prescribed for the pumsavana differs in different Grhyasutras, and can be extended up to the eighth month of pregnancy, according to some. Parting hair and baby shower, Simantonnayana Simantonnayana (IAST: Sƒ´mantonnayana, Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•Ä‡§Æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ã‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§Ø‡§®), also called Simanta or Simantakarana, literally means \\"parting the hair upwards\\".PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 222-224Rajbali Pandey (1969), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio- religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, , pages 64-65 The significance of the ritual is to wish a healthy development of the baby and safe delivery to the mother.Mary McGee (2007), Samskara, in The Hindu World (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, , page 341 Simantonnayana ritual is described in many Gryhasutra texts, but Kane states that there is great divergence in details, which may be because the rite of passage emerged in more a recent era, before it receded into the background. The texts do not agree on whether this rite of passage was to be celebrated before or after pumsavana, early or late stage of pregnancy, or the nature of ritual celebrations. The texts also disagree whether Simantonnayana was a rite of passage of the baby or of the pregnant woman, the former implying it must be repeated for every baby while the latter implying it was to be observed once for the woman with her first pregnancy. The common element was the husband and wife getting together, with friends and family, then he parts her hair upwards at least three times. In modern times, the \\"parting hair\\" rite of passage is rarely observed, and when observed it is called Atha-gulem and done in the 8th month, with flowers and fruits, to cheer the woman in the late stages of her pregnancy.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, page 226 The ritual has more commonly evolved into a ritual that shares characteristics of a baby shower, where the friends and relatives of the woman meet, acknowledge and satisfy the food cravings of the expectant woman, and give gifts to the mother and the baby in 7th or 8th month of pregnancy.James B. Robinson (2004), Hinduism, , page 83 Y√•j√±avalkya Smriti verse 3.79 asserts that the desires of the pregnant woman should be satisfied for healthy development of the baby, to prevent miscarriage and her health. After the Simantonnayana ritual or in the last months of the pregnancy, the woman is expected to not overexert herself, her husband is expected to be by her and not to travel to distant lands. This rite of passage is regionally called by various names, such as Seemant, Godh bharai, Seemantham or Valaikaapu.Pregnant Kanica Maheshwari to have a real godh-bharai on her TV show The Times of India Childbirth ceremony, Jatakarman JƒÅtakarman literally means \\"rite of a new-born infant\\".jAtakarman, Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary, (2008 revision), Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, GermanyjAtakarman Apte Sanskrit English Dictionary, University of Chicago It is a rite of passage that celebrates the birth of the baby.jAtakarman Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany It is the first post-natal rite of passage of the new born baby. It signifies the baby's birth, as well as the bonding of the father with the baby.Kathy Jackson (2005), Rituals and Patterns in Children's Lives, University of Wisconsin Press, , page 46 In Hindu traditions, a human being is born at least twice ‚Äì one at physical birth through mother's womb, and second at intellectual birth through teacher's care, the first is marked through Jatakarman sanskara ritual, the second is marked through Vidyarambha or Upanayana sanskara ritual. During a traditional JƒÅtakarman ritual, the father welcomes the baby by touching the baby's lips with honey and ghee (clarified butter), as Vedic hymns are recited. The first significance of the hymns is medhajanana (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡•á‡§ß‡§æ‡§ú‡§®‡§®), or to initiate the baby's mind and intellect in the womb of the world, after the baby's body formation has completed in the womb of the mother. The second part of the hymns wish the baby a long life. The Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, in the last chapter detailing lessons for Grihastha stage of life for a student, describes this rite of passage, in verses 6.4.24 to 6.4.27, as follows, A new born's Namakarana ceremony. The grandmother is whispering the name into the baby's ear, while friends and family watch. The Upanishad includes prayer to deity Saraswati during this rite of passage, the goddess of knowledge and wisdom in Hindu tradition. It also includes the threefold repetition of \\"Speech Speech\\" with the assertion to the baby, \\"You are the Vedas! so, live a hundred autumns\\", into the baby's ear by the father. At the end of the ritual pronouncements by the father, he gives the baby to the mother's breast for feeding. While the earliest Dharmasutras list Jatakarma and Namakarama as two different sanskara, they evolve into one in many Gryhasutra texts. By Pantanjali's time, these two rites of passage had merged into one, and completed within the first two weeks of the baby's birth, usually about the tenth day.Hermann Oldenberg, Friedrich Max M√ºller, , in The Grihya-sutras: Rules of Vedic Domestic Ceremonies, pages 51-52 Naming the baby ritual, Namakarana Namakarana (IAST: NƒÅmakara·πáa, Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§æ‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞‡§£) literally means \\"ceremony of naming a child\\".nAmakaraNa Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon This rite of passage is usually done on the eleventh or twelfth day after birth, and sometimes the first new moon or full moon day after the 10th day of birth. On the day of this samskara, the infant is bathed and dressed in new garments. His or her formal name, selected by the parents, is announced. The naming ritual solemnizes the child as an individual, marking the process by which a child is accepted and socialized by people around him or her. The Satapatha Brahmana verse 6.1.3.9 asserts that the naming ceremony is a cleansing ceremony for the baby. The rite of passage also includes a gathering of friends and relatives of the new parents, where gifts are presented, and a feast follows.Mary McGee (2007), Samskara, in The Hindu World (Editors: Mittal and Thursby), Routledge, , pages 342-343 The ancient Sanskrit texts provide numerous and divergent guidelines to the parents for choosing names. Most recommend that the boy‚Äôs name be two or four syllables, starting with a sonant, a semivowel in the middle, and ending in a visarga. A girl's name is recommended to be an odd number of syllables, ending in a long ƒÅ or ƒ´, resonant and easy to pronounce.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 238-254 Unpleasant, inauspicious, or words that easily transform into bad or evil words must be avoided, state the Gryhasutras, while the preferred names are those affiliated with a deity, virtues, good qualities, lucky stars, constellation, derivatives of the name of the father, or mother, or the place of birth, or beautiful elements of nature (trees, flowers, birds). Baby's first outing, Nishkramana Nishkramana (IAST: Ni·π£krƒÅma·πáa, Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§Æ) literally means \\"going out, coming forth\\",niSkrama Monier Williams is the rite of passage where the parents take the baby outside the home and the baby formally meets the world for the first time. It is usually observed during the fourth month after birth. On this ritual occasion the newborn is taken out and shown the sun at sunrise or sunset, or the moon, or both. Alternatively, some families take the baby to a temple for the first time. The rite of passage involves bathing the baby and dressing him or her in new clothes. The baby's outing is accompanied by both the mother and the father, siblings if any, as well some near family members such as grandparents and friends.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 315-321 Annaprashanam is the rite of passage where the baby is fed solid food for the first time. The ritual has regional names, such as Choroonu in Kerala. The significance of Niskramana and showing the baby heavenly bodies is derived from their significance of Sun, Moon and nature in the Vedic literature. At the time the baby is present before the sunrise or moon, it is the father who holds the baby and recites a hymn that means, \\"the brilliant sun has risen in the east, he is like the hamsa (swan) of the pure worlds, let us salute him, because he dispels darkness\\". When the baby is in presence of the moon, the father says, \\"O Moon, thou whose hair is well parted, let this child come to no harm, nor torn from the mother\\".PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 255-256 Baby's first solid food, Annaprashana Annaprashana (IAST: AnnaprƒÅ≈õana, Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§™‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§∂‡§®) literally means \\"feeding of food\\", and the rite of passage marks the first time a baby eats solid food, typically containing cooked rice. Most Gryhasutras recommend this ritual in the sixth month, or when the child shows the first teeth, with slow weaning of the baby from breast feeding to other sources food. Some texts recommend continued breast feeding of the child, as the child adapts to the various foods. The ritual is usually celebrated with cooked rice, in a paste of honey, ghee and curd.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 89-94 Sankhyayana Gryhasutra recommends that fish, goat or partridge meat gravy be added to the solid food that baby tastes for the first time, while Manava Gryhasutra is silent about the use of meat. The mother eats with the baby, the same food. The father sits with them and participates in the rite of passage. The rite of passage, in some texts, include charity and feeding of the poor, and ceremonial prayers by both parents.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 256-258 Baby's first haircut, Chudakarana A baby's first haircut is called choulam samskara. Chudakarana (IAST: C≈´·∏çƒÅkara·πáa, Sanskrit: ‡§ö‡•Ç‡§°‡§æ‡§ï‡§∞‡§£) (literally, rite of tonsure), also known as choulam, caula, chudakarma, mundana or \\"mundan sanskar\\" is the rite of passage that marks the child's first haircut, typically the shaving of the head. The mother dresses up, sometimes in her wedding sari, and with the father present, the baby's hair is cut and the nails are trimmed. Sometimes, a tuft of hair is left to cover the soft spot near the top of baby's head. The significance of this rite of passage is the baby's cyclical step to hygiene and cleanliness.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 94-95 The ritual is seen as a passage of purity. It is typically done about the first birthday, but some texts recommend that it be completed before the third or the seventh year. Sometimes, this ritual is combined with the rite of passage of Upanayana, initiation to formal schooling. The ritual may include recitation of prayers for the child's long life and happiness.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 260-265 Baby's earlobe piercing rite, Karnavedha A Hindu girl after her Karnavedha rite of passage (ear piercing). Karnavedha (IAST: Kar·πáavedha, Sanskrit: ‡§ï‡§∞‡•ç‡§£‡§µ‡•á‡§ß) literally means \\"ear-piercing\\".karNavedha Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon This is a minor rite of passage, that is not mentioned in most Gryha-sutras.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio- religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 102-105 Those that mention it state different schedules, with some suggesting that the ritual within the first four weeks after birth, others suggesting within the first year.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 254-255 The purpose of this optional ritual is primarily an ornamentation of the body, and is part of the baby's socialization process and culture emersion. The piercing is usually done with a clean gold thread, or silver needle. For a baby boy, the right earlobe is pierced first. For a baby girl, the left earlobe is. In case of girls, the left nostril may also be pierced during this ritual. The piercing of the earlobes symbolically reminds the child, as he or she grows up, of beauty and social presence, of the importance of hearing and speech in the wisdom of the Vedas. Child's commencement to knowledge, Vidyarambha Vidyarambha (IAST: VidyƒÅra·πÉbha, Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§∞‡§Æ‡•ç‡§≠) literally means \\"beginning of study\\". It is also known as Akshararambha, Aksharaabhyaasa, or Aksharasvikara. It is a ritual that celebrates as a milestone, the child's formal attempt to learn means of knowledge.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VI, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 266-267 This includes steps where the child, helped by the parents and other family members, does one or more of the following: writes letters of the mother-tongue, draws mathematical numbers or shapes, and plays a musical instrument. The oldest texts that describe rites of passage, such as the Dharmasutras, make no mention of Vidyarambha and go direct to Upanayana ritual at the 8th year. The later texts, such as the Samskara Prakasha, from the first centuries of 1st millennium CE, mention Vidyarambha as a rite of passage in the 5th year of a child's life, suggesting that the process of learning started shifting to an earlier age of a child with time. The ceremony is observed on the same day for all children in their 5th year, on the day of Vijayadasami which is on the tenth of the Hindu month Ashvin (September‚ÄìOctober). It includes a prayer to goddess Saraswati and deity Ganesh, a teacher is invited or the parents themselves work with the child to write Lipi (letters of the alphabet), draw Samkhya (numbers) or pictures, and sometimes play with an instrument.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 106-108RK Mookerji (2011), Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 173-174 In modern times, parents mark this rite of passage in the third year of the child.James Lochtefeld, \\"Vidyarambha\\", The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Vol. 2: N‚ÄìZ, Rosen Publishing. , page 750 Child's entrance into school, Upanayana Upanayana sanskara ceremony in progress. Typically, this ritual was for 8 year olds in ancient India, but in the 1st millennium CE it became open to all ages.Harold Coward et al (1997), Religious Dimensions of Child and Family Life, Wilfrid Laurier University Press, , page 67 Upanayana (IAST:Upanayana, Sanskrit: ‡§â‡§™‡§®‡§Ø‡§®) literally means \\"the act of leading to or near\\".upanyana Monier Williams Sanskrit English Dictionary, Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany It is an important and widely discussed samskara in ancient Sanskrit text. The rite of passage symbolizes the leading or drawing towards the self of a child, in a school, by a teacher. It is a ceremony in which a Guru (teacher) accepts and draws a child towards knowledge and initiates the second birth that is of the young mind and spirit. Upanayana was an elaborate ceremony, that included rituals involving the family, the child and the teacher. During this ceremony, a boy receives a sacred thread called Yaj√±opaveetam, that he wears. Yaj√±opavita ceremony announced that the child had entered into formal education.Ram Chandra Prasad (1997), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 119-131 In the modern era, the Upanayana rite of passage is open to anyone at any age. Rajbali Pandey compares the Upanayana rite of passage to Baptism in Christianity where the person is born again unto spiritual knowledge, in addition to it being the ancient Indian rite of passage for the start of formal education of writing, numbers, reading, Vedangas, arts and other skills.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 111-117 The Upanayana rite of passage was also important to the teacher, as the student would therefrom begin to live in the Gurukul (school).PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 268-287 Many medieval era texts discuss Upanayana in the context of three Varnas (caste, class) - Brahmins, Kshtreyas and Vaishyas. Several texts such as Sushruta Sutrasthana, however, also include Sudras entering schools and the formal education process,RK Mookerji (2011), Ancient Indian Education: Brahmanical and Buddhist, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 270-271 stating that the Upanayana samskara was open to everyone.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 288-300Hartmut Scharfe (2007), Handbook of Oriental Studies, Brill Academic, , pages 102-103, 197-198, 263-276 The upanayana ceremony extended to women, in ancient Sanskrit texts, and the girls who underwent this rite of passage then pursued studies were called Brahmavadini. Those who didn't, performed upanayana ceremony at the time of their wedding. Instead of sacred thread, girls would wear their robe (now called sari or saree) in the manner of the sacred thread, that is over her left shoulder during this rite of passage.PV Kane, History of Dharmasastra Volume 2.1, 1st Edition, pages 293-295Grihya sutra of Gobhila Verse 2.1.19, Herman Oldenberg & Max Muller (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 30, Part 2, Oxford University Press, page 44 The education of a student was not limited to ritual and philosophical speculations found in the Vedas and the Upanishads. They extended to many arts and crafts, which had their own but similar rites of passages.Stella Kramrisch (1958), Traditions of the Indian Craftsman, The Journal of American Folklore, Vol. 71, No. 281, pages 224-230 Aitareya Brahmana, Agamas and Puranas literature of Hinduism describe these as Shilpa Sastras, and they extend to all practical aspects of culture, such as the sculptor, the potter, the perfumer, the wheelwright, the painter, the weaver, the architect, the dancer, and the musician. Ancient Indian texts assert that the number of the arts is unlimited, but each deploy elements of sixty four ‚Äò‚Äòkala‚Äô‚Äô (‡§ï‡§≤‡§æ, techniques) and thirty two ‚Äò‚Äòvidyas‚Äô‚Äô (‡§µ‡§ø‡§¶‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ, fields of knowledge). The training of these began from childhood, and included studies about dharma, culture, reading, writing, mathematics, geometry, colors, tools, as well as traditions (trade secrets). The rites of passage during apprentice education varied in the respective guilds.Stella Kramrisch, The Hindu Temple, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, Heather Elgood (2000), Hinduism and the religious arts, , Bloomsbury Academic, pages 32-134 Vedarambha Praishartha (or Vedarambha) is the rite of passage that marked the start of learning the Vedas and Upanishads in Gurukulam or Pathashala (school). It was a fire ritual (yajna), where the teacher and the student sat together, with the teacher reciting initiation hymns and the student following. This ritual is missing in older texts, and Pandey suggests that the later tradition recognized the difference between getting accepted in a school, and the actual start of Veda studies when the student is ready to learn those texts.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 142 In ancient India, the student's preparation involved helping with school chores, living a simple life, going to villages and towns to seek donations of food (Bhiksha), collect and bring water, collect fuel sticks for cooking, general maintenance of the school and share the food he and others collect with his teacher and the student community. These were on-going rituals of living at living, and not considered as a distinct rite of passage.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 308-312 Prior to the initiation of the Veda study, the student learnt the vocabulary, grammar and other basic studies. The emphasis of the stage where the student started Veda study was both the memorization and know the meaning of each hymn, verse or mantra.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 356-357 Vedarambha marked the actual start of the Veda study.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 321-334 Some texts describes two rituals each academic period (school year), one marking the start of Vedic studies each year, called Upakarma or Upakarana. The other ceremony was held at the end of each academic period, called Utasarjanam or Utsarga or Samapana, and marked the suspension of the Veda studies for a certain period of the year.PV Kane, Upakarana, Chapter XXIII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part II, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 807-811 The start of school ceremony, the Upakarma was observed in the month of Sravana (August) every year. It was held in the morning, and attended by the students, the teacher, people in the Grihastha stage (householders, parents) and Vanaprastha stage of life (retired, grandparents). The Utsarga, closing the study year, was held in the month of Magha (about February).PV Kane, Upakarana, Chapter XXIII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part II, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 815-818 Keshanta and Ritusuddhi A Tamil Hindu girl (center) in 1870 wearing a half-saree, flowers and jewelry from her Ritu Kala Sanskara rite of passage. Keshanta (IAST: Ke≈õƒÅnta) (literally, getting rid of hairs) is the first shave of a youth's facial hair. This was typically observed about age sixteen, and the emerging beard and moustache were shaved. The ceremony included gift giving such as to the barber and the teacher at his school.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 143-145 The coming of age ceremony ended with the student reciting his vow of chastity and the code of Brahmacharya. Ritusuddhi, also called as Ritu Kala Samskara, is the corresponding coming of age ceremony for girls, after menarche or first menstruation. This milestone in a girl's life is observed by her family and friends, with gifts and her wearing a sari for the ritual.Sacred Samskaras Rajbali Pandey, Hinduism Today, May/June 2001Heidi Munan (2012), Hindu Puberty Rites in CultureShock! Malaysia: A Survival Guide to Customs and Etiquette, , page 74 The rite of passage is celebrated, in modern times, as a \\"half-saree party\\" where the female relatives and friends of the girl gather, and she receives and wears a half-saree and other gifts. Thereafter, at ceremonious events, she wears the half-sarees, until her marriage when she puts on a full Sari.Lene Jensen (2015), The Oxford Handbook of Human Development and Culture, Oxford University Press, , page 328 Graduation ceremony, Samavartana Samavartana (IAST: SamƒÅvartana), or Snana, is the ceremony associated with the end of formal education and the Brahmacharya asrama of life. This rite of passage includes a ceremonial bath.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 405-408 This ceremony marked the end of school, but did not imply immediate start of married life. Typically, significant time elapsed between exiting the Brahmacharya stage of life and the entering of Grihastha stage of life.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, page 408 Anyone who had complete this rite of passage was considered a Vidyasnataka (literally, bathed in knowledge, or showered with learning), and symbolized as one who had crossed the ocean of learning.Kathy Jackson (2005), Rituals and Patterns in Children's Lives, University of Wisconsin Press, , page 52 This ceremony was a gathering of students and teacher. The student asked the teacher for any gift (guru- dakshina) he desired, which if specified was the student's responsibility to deliver over his lifetime.PV Kane, Snana or Samavartana, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 406-409 Then, after a recitation of a graduate's dharma (snataka- dharma)PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 412-417 (note: link has missing pages) and a fire ritual, the graduate took a bath. The ceremony occurred after completion of at least 12 years of school, that is either about age 21 or later. Taittiriya Upanishad describes, in the eleventh anuvaka of Shiksha Valli, the snataka-dharma recitation emphasized by the teacher to a graduate at this rite of passage. The verses ask the graduate to take care of themselves and pursue Dharma, Artha and Kama to the best of their abilities.

The wedding rituals, Vivaha A rite of passage with yajna ceremony often marks a Hindu wedding. Vivaha (IAST: VivƒÅha, Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§π) is the rite of passage and rituals associated with marriage.BBC News article on Hinduism & Weddings, Nawal Prinja (August 24, 2009)Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, , pages 153-233 While there are many rituals in Hinduism, vivaha (wedding) is the most extensive personal ritual an adult Hindu undertakes in his or her life.Rajbali Pandey (1969), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, , see Chapter VIII, pages 153‚Äì233James G. Lochtefeld (2001), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, , page 427 The wedding rites and ceremonies begin with the engagement of a couple, and extend to rites of passage after the completion of wedding. They are typically very colorful, and celebrations may extend for several days.Sari nights and henna parties, Amy Yee, The Financial Times, May 17, 2008 The detailed rituals and process in a Hindu wedding vary. Nevertheless, there are a few key rituals common in Hindu weddings - Kanyadaan, Panigrahana, and Saptapadi, which are respectively, giving away of daughter by the father, voluntarily holding hand near the fire to signify union, and taking seven steps with each step includes a vow/promise to each other before fire. The Vivaha sanskara is essentially a Vedic yajna ritual, with recitation of Vedic hymns. The primary witness of a Hindu marriage is the Vedic fire-deity (or the Sacred Fire) Agni, in the presence of family and friends.Bajpai, Shiva (2011). The History of India - From Ancient to Modern Times, Himalayan Academy Publications (Hawaii, USA), ; see pages 4, 73-74 Post-wedding rites of passage include Grihapravesa ‚Äì the welcoming of the bride to her new home by groom's mother, father, brother(s), or sister(s), and other relatives. Chaturthikarma ‚Äì literally, \\"the rite performed on the fourth day after wedding\\", is the rite where the first domestic fire is lit marking the food-related householder life of the new couple.Rajbali Pandey (2013), Hindu Sa·πÅskƒÅras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, 2nd Edition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 224-225 Honeymoon, or the act of first sexual intercourse after the wedding is known as Nishekam (Sanskrit: ‡§®‡§ø‡§∑‡•á‡§ï).niSeka Sanskrit - English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, GermanyJ√∂rg Gengnagel and Ute H√ºsken (2005), Words and Deeds: Hindu and Buddhist Rituals in South Asia, Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 155-156 Vratas Vrata literally means a vow or practice, any pious observance, act of devotion or austerity such as fasting.vrata Monier-Williams' Sanskrit- English Dictionary, Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany These were cyclical rites of passage of those in Grihastha (householder) stage of life, typically as reminder of some pious action, reflective, spiritual side of life. Most Gryhasutras and several Smritis include four Veda-vratas as samskara after graduation, as means of continuing self-education. The four Vratas includes Sukriya (study Rigveda), Sakvara, Vratika and Upanishad Vrata. The rite of passage ceremony for each of these marked the start of the self study by the householder, which lasted between 1, 3, 6 or 9 year each.PV Kane, Samskara, Chapter VII, History of Dharmasastras, Vol II, Part I, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, pages 370-375 =Cremation ritual, Antyeshti= Antyesti (IAST: Antaye·π£·π≠i, Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø‡•á‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø) (literally, last rites or last sacrifice), sometimes referred to as Antima Samskaram, Antya-kriya, Anvarohanyya, or Vahni Sanskara, are the rituals associated with funeral.Antayesti Cologne Sanskrit Digital Lexicon, Germany This samskara is not mentioned in the lists of samskaras in most of the grhyasutras and other texts that discuss samskaras. The details and procedures of this rite are given in separate texts, dealing only with this topic. A dead adult Hindu is mourned with a cremation, while a dead child is typically buried.J Fowler (1996), Hinduism: Beliefs and Practices, Sussex Academic Press, , pages 59-60 The rite of passage is performed in harmony with the sacred premise that the microcosm of all living beings is a reflection of a macrocosm of the universe.Terje Oestigaard, in The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology of Death and Burial (Editors: Sarah Tarlow, Liv Nilsson Stut), Oxford University Press, ISBN , pages 497-501 The soul (Atman, Brahman) is the essence and immortal that is released at the Antyeshti ritual, but both the body and the universe are vehicles and transitory in various schools of Hinduism. They consist of five elements - air, water, fire, earth and space. The last rite of passage returns the body to the five elements and origins.Carl Olson (2007), The Many Colors of Hinduism: A Thematic-historical Introduction, Rutgers University Press, , pages 99-100 The roots of this belief are found in the Vedas, for example in the hymns of Rigveda in section 10.16, as follows, A Hindu cremation rite in Nepal. The samskara above shows the body wrapped in saffron on a pyre. The final rites of a burial, in case of untimely death of a child, is rooted in Rig Veda's section 10.18, where the hymns mourn the death of the child, praying to deity Mrityu to \\"neither harm our girls nor our boys\\", and pleads the earth to cover, protect the deceased child as a soft wool.Sukta XVIII - Rigveda, English Translation: HH Wilson (Translator), pages 46-49 with footnotes; Wendy Doniger (1981), The Rig Veda, Penguin Classics, , see chapter on Death The last rites are usually completed within a day of death. His or her body is washed, wrapped in white cloth if the dead is a man or a widow (red if her husband is still alive), the two toes tied together with a string, a Tilak (red mark) placed on the forehead. The dead adult's body is carried to the cremation ground near a river or water, by family and friends, and placed on a pyre with feet facing south. The eldest son, or a male mourner, or a priest then bathes before leading the cremation ceremonial function.Carrie Mercier (1998), Hinduism for Today, Oxford University Press, , page 58 He circumambulates the dry wood pyre with the body, says a eulogy or recites a hymn in some cases, places sesame seed in the dead person's mouth, sprinkles the body and the pyre with ghee (clarified butter), then draws three lines signifying Yama (deity of the dead), Kala (time, deity of cremation) and the dead. The pyre is then set ablaze, while the mourners mourn. The ash from the cremation is consecrated to the nearest river or sea. After the cremation, in some regions, the immediate male relatives of the deceased shave their head and invite all friends and relatives, on the tenth or twelfth day, to eat a simple meal together in remembrance of the deceased. This day, in some communities, also marks a day when the poor and needy are offered food in memory of the dead.Colin Parkes et al (2015), Death and Bereavement Across Cultures, Routledge, , page 66-67 Sanskara in Jainism Jainism Similar to Hinduism, Sanskara serve as a rite of passage into a new phase of life in different sects of Jainism.Caroline Humphrey and James Laidlaw (1994), The Archetype Actions of Ritual - A Theory of Ritual Illustrated by the Jain Rite of Worship, Oxford University Press, , pages 193-208 All 16 Hindu sanskaras above were incorporated by Jinasena, for example, in Digambara Adipurana as part of 53 kriyas, of which 23 rites of passage are described for the Jain householder, with the last culminating in renunciation of household life.Padmanabh S. Jaini (2014), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 291-300 For those who skip the householder stage of life, the equivalent rite of passage was the 11th pratima, and called diksha (initiation into mendicancy). In the ≈övƒìtƒÅmbara school, 16 sanskaras similar to the Hindu rites of passage are described, for example, in the Acara- Dinakara of Vardhamana.Alexander von Rospatt (2005), Words and Deeds: Hindu and Buddhist Rituals in South Asia (Editors: J√∂rg Gengnagel and Ute H√ºsken), Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, , pages 199-200 It includes rituals described above, such as those associated with conception, birth, name giving, ear piercing, baby's first haircut, studentship, wedding and death.Kristi L. Wiley (2009), A to Z of Jainism, , pages 186-187 There are some differences between symbolism associated with sanskara rites in Hinduism and Jainism. The fire ceremony has Vedic significance in the former, while it symbolizes the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas and Kevalins in Jainism. The mantras are often derived from Vedic texts in Hinduism, while they are derived from Jain texts such as Ratnatraya in Jainism. The oaths in some rites of passage include the vow of ahimsa (non- violence, non injury to all human beings and living beings) in both, but is of exclusive significance in Jainism.

History  The palace's name derives from the slight hill on which it is built, which was claimed to be the Mons Citatorius, the hill created in the process of clearing the Campus Martius in Roman times. The building was originally designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini for the young Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi, nephew of Pope Gregory XV. However, with the death of Gregory XV by 1623, work stopped, and was not restarted until the papacy of Pope Innocent XII (Antonio Pignatelli), when it was completed by the architect Carlo Fontana, who modified Bernini's plan with the addition of a bell gable above the main entrance. The building was designated for public and social functions only, due to Innocent XII's firm antinepotism policies which were in contrast to his predecessors. In 1696 the Curia apostolica (papal law courts) was installed there. Later it was home to the Governatorato di Roma (the city administration during the papal period) and the police headquarters. The excavated obelisk of the Solarium Augusti, now known as the Obelisk of Montecitorio, was installed in front of the palace by Pius VI in 1789. With the Unification of Italy in 1861 and the transfer of the capital to Rome in 1870, Montecitorio was seized by the Italian government and chosen as the seat of the Chamber of Deputies, after consideration of various possibilities. The former internal courtyard was roofed over and converted into a semi-circular assembly room by Paolo Comotto. The Chamber was inaugurated on 21 November 1871. But the building proved wholly inadequate: the acoustics were terrible, it was very cold in winter and very hot in summer. As a result of extensive damage from water seepage, the palace was condemned in 1900. An attempt to build a new palace for the Chamber of Deputies on the Via Nazionale failed, and a provisional meeting hall was built on the Via della Missione. Only in 1918 was the Chamber definitively returned to the Palazzo Montecitorio. The return of the Chamber of Deputies to the palace followed extensive renovations, which left only the facade intact. The architect, Ernesto Basile, was an exponent of Art nouveau, known in Italy as Liberty style. He reduced the courtyard, demolished the wings and rear of the palace, constructing a new structure dominated by four red-brick and travertine towers at the corners. Basile also added the so-called Transatlantico, the long and impressive salon which surrounds the debating chamber and now acts as the informal centre of Italian politics. The debating chamber is characterized by numerous decorations in the Art Nouveau style: the impressive canopy of coloured glass (the work of Giovanni Beltrami), the pictorial frieze entitled The Italian People (by Giulio Aristide Sartorio) which surrounds the chamber, the bronze figures flanking the presidential and government benches, and the panels depicting The Glory of the Savoy Dynasty by Davide Calandra.

About Ben Ben first arrived in Charnham in January 2005, shortly after serving four years imprisonment for manslaughter. Ben had accidentally drowned Luke Pellow, a boy who had been bullying his twin brother, Alex after holding his head under water until he stopped breathing. It was a tense time for Ben and his family as Ben was the subject of local gossip. Ben later settled into the area, albeit with a little difficulty. Further Dramas On the Weekend of their 18th birthday, Ben and Alex took a car their father, Conrad had bought for them for a drive. The twins had an argument about the last few years and Ben's inability to reconnect with the family. Ben goaded Alex about being a wimp and a loser. Alex then punched Ben. Later that day, the twins were involved in a car crash with Denise Boulter and Graham Harker, thanks to Ben grabbing the steering wheel from his brother. It looked as if Ben could be returned to the young offender's institute after this, but Alex decided to take the blame for the accident and escaped with a suspended license. Ben later found work with Justin MacKenzie at his father's building firm, MacKenzie and Sons. Revelation When Gay couple Max Lawson and Sami Shafiq purchased Dusty's store from Yasmin Green and moved into the area, Ben wasn't too keen on them. Ben was accused of being homophobic due to his lack of remorse for a botched building job he had done on the shop and frequent comments he had made. Ben even went as far to punch Sami one night at a house party. When backed into a corner by Max, Ben revealed that he had a non- physical, homosexual relationship with another boy while in the Young Offender's Instittue. Final Storylines Ben did not feature very often toward the end of series. Soon after Alex left to live with their mother Ella and sister Ania in Los Angeles and Conrad left for Fiji with his lover, nurse Tanya Woods, Ben moved in with his boss Justin and his half-brother Marc. Ben helped renovate the recently burned out Black Swan pub which was later renamed the Phoenix. Later it was revealed that Ben was Gay and in the closet.

Based on the short story Walk Well, My Brother by Farley Mowat, the film is about a Canadian bush pilot whose life is changed through an encounter with a young Inuk woman and their challenge to survive the harsh conditions of the Northwest Territories following an aircraft crash. The film won six Leo Awards, including Best Lead Performance by a Male (Barry Pepper), and was nominated for nine Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture, Best Performance by an Actor (Barry Pepper), Best Performance by an Actress (Annabella Piugattuk), and Best Adapted Screenplay (Charles Martin Smith).\\"Awards for The Snow Walker.\\" IMDb. Retrieved: October 5, 2014. Plot In the summer of 1953, Canadian bush pilot Charlie Halliday, a brash, former Second World War bomber pilot based in Yellowknife, is flying a routine job in the Queen Maud Gulf on the Arctic Ocean when he encounters a small band of Inuit people who plead for his help. They are traveling with a sick young woman, Kanaalaq, and they ask Charlie to fly her to a hospital. Charlie suspects she has tuberculosis. At first he refuses, but when they offer him two valuable walrus tusks for his help, he reluctantly agrees to take her to Yellowknife. During the flight, his Noorduyn Norseman aircraft develops engine trouble, and they crash land near the shore of a glacial lake. Charlie and Kanaalaq are unharmed, but the aircraft is disabled. They are in the middle of a vast tundra in the Northwest Territories, the radio is broken, and they have a meager amount of supplies. To make matters worse, he is hundreds of miles from the route he submitted in his original flight plan, so any rescue operation would not know where to look. Charlie is overwhelmed with a sense of doom, and he sees his Inuit companion as an unwelcome burden. Charlie estimates they are about 100 miles from the closest town. Believing their chances of survival are slim if they both wait with the aircraft, Charlie leaves Kanaalaq behind to look for help on his own. He soon learns, however, that he is unprepared for the challenges presented by this harsh and unforgiving land. One morning he awakens surrounded by a storm of mosquitoes, which cause him to flee shoeless across the jagged rocks before collapsing unconscious. Kanaalaq appears above him and begins treating his wounds and bites with mud and moss. He awakes later, and is startled to find her. She feeds him and continues to care for him. Gradually, Charlie regains his strength and is healed through Kanaalaq's patient care. Charlie comes to appreciate this young woman's gifts, and together they learn to communicate with each other. After hearing the sound of a distant aircraft, Charlie realizes they never should have abandoned the crash site. He decides they should return to their aircraft, which he believes has surely been discovered by now. They set out together, but this time he is much better equipped with the watertight boots that Kanaalaq made for him. Along the way, the ailing young Inuit woman teaches the hot-tempered pilot the way to live in the tundra, and the two form a bond of respect and friendship. When they discover the ruins of another aircraft crash, Kanaalaq shows Charlie how to prepare a corpse for the afterlife in a stone burial cairn with the person's tools placed inside. She tells him that when a person is called to the afterlife, where there is much wildlife for hunting, they need the appropriate tools. When Charlie and Kanaalaq arrive back at the crash site, they discover no sign of rescuers, and Charlie becomes deeply depressed, convinced they will not survive the oncoming winter. Kanaalaq, however, understands how to survive in this harsh land, and she prepares a caribou hunt. She places inuksuit ‚Äî multiple stone structures used by the Inuit to guide caribou into areas where hunters can easily harvest them. She is able to elicit Charlie's help, and together they kill three caribou, which will provide sufficient food and pelts for the winter. One night, Kanaalaq reveals how her father died in a snowstorm, and how her mother wandered off to die so that her children would have enough food to live. After Kanaalaq uses the pelts to create suitable winter clothing for Charlie, Charlie and Kanaalaq set out together across the tundra hoping to reach an Inuit camp or village to the north. In the coming days, Kanaalaq's condition worsens, and Charlie is forced to carry her on a sleigh he built using the valuable walrus tusks. One morning, Charlie discovers that Kanaalaq too has wandered off so that he might live. He follows her tracks in the snow, which lead to a white owl. He builds a stone burial cairn for Kanaalaq, placing her hunting and fishing tools, and the valuable walrus tusks inside for the afterlife. In a snowstorm, Charlie approaches a small Inuit village, where he is welcomed.

Writer-director Charles Martin Smith had played Farley Mowat in his autobiographical story Never Cry Wolf. The Hollywood-shy author Mowat invited Smith to adapt any of his works. Smith chose the short story \\"Walk Well, My Brother\\" because of its simplicity, placing two people against the elements of the Northwest Territories, but incorporated elements from \\"The Blood in their Veins\\" and other, closely related Mowat stories in his screenplay.Mowat 2003, p. ix. Mowat later re- released in 2003, The Snow Walker, an anthology of earlier short stories that included \\"Walk Well, My Brother\\" and featured a preface by Smith.Mowat 2004, pp. iX‚Äìxi. The Snow Walker cast Canadian actors in the primary roles, and numerous Inuit people, including the lead actress Annabella Piugattuk. She was selected after the casting director reviewed hundreds of young women, many of whom were, like Piugattuk, non-actors. She was chosen for her fluency in both her native language and English, as well as her knowledge of native hunting and survival techniques, which brought verisimilitude to her role. Additionally, co-producer John Houston grew up in an Inuit village. The Snow Walker was filmed entirely in Canada in the following locations: * Churchill, Manitoba (tundra scenes) * Merritt, British Columbia (caribou hunt) * Rankin Inlet, Nunavut * Thompson-Nicola Regional District, British Columbia\\"Filming locations for The Snow Walker.\\" IMDb.

It is considered the southern end-station of the Panamerican Highway and the Pacific Coastal Highway. The city is a hub for aquaculture and fisheries in southern Chilo√© and the Guaitecas and Chonos archipelagoes to the south. Various ferry lanes connects Quell√≥n with the Patagonian settlements such as Melinka, Puerto Cisnes and Puerto Chacabuco. In Quell√≥n the majority of men work on small boats called \\"lanchas\\" for days at a time fishing. Also many men and women work in local seafood processing plants. Climate Quell√≥n has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Cfb) with some drying trend in summer. Winters are cool and wet but mild with a July average of . During this time of the year, precipitation is very high, averaging around from June to August and humidity is high, averaging around 85‚Äì87%. Few days are dry in winter, since there are 22‚Äì24 days with measurable precipitation from June to August. Nonetheless, snowfall is rare and most years will record no snowfall. Summers are mild with a January average of and during this time, precipitation is lower, averaging in February, the driest month. Temperatures can occasionally exceed anytime from September to June. One characteristic of the climate is that Quell√≥n, like the rest of the central and southern parts of Chilo√© island is exposed to strong westerly winds throughout the year. The average annual precipitation is , with significant amounts in all months; the 4 months with the most precipitation make up 50% of the total annual precipitation. On average, there are 239 days with measureable precipitation. The record high was in January 1978 and the record low was in June 1971 and August 1975. Demographics According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Quell√≥n spans an area of and has 21,823 inhabitants (11,595 men and 10,228 women). Of these, 13,656 (62.6%) lived in urban areas and 8,167 (37.4%) in rural areas. The population grew by 45% (6,768 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses. Administration As a commune, Quell√≥n is a third-level administrative division of Chile administered by a municipal council, headed by an alcalde who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2012 alcalde is Iv√°n Haro Uribe (RN). Within the electoral divisions of Chile, Quell√≥n is represented in the Chamber of Deputies by Gabriel Ascencio (PDC) and Alejandro Santana (RN) as part of the 58th electoral district, (together with Castro, Ancud, Quemchi, Dalcahue, Curaco de V√©lez, Quinchao, Puqueld√≥n, Chonchi, Queil√©n, Chait√©n, Hualaihu√©, Futaleuf√∫ and Palena). The commune is represented in the Senate by Camilo Escalona Medina (PS) and Carlos Kuschel Silva (RN) as part of the 17th senatorial constituency (Los Lagos Region). Transport The end-station of the Panamerican Highway A placard in Quell√≥n marks a southern terminus of the Pan-American Highway, a network of roads spanning and 19 countries in the Americas. Its northern limit is in Anchorage, Alaska. Tierra del Fuego National Park in Argentina is also considered as an endpoint for the Panamerican Highway. The point also marks the southern endpoint of the Pacific Coastal Highway, which stretches from Lund, British Columbia. The southernmost reaches of continental Chile are not accessible by road except through neighboring Argentina due to the craggy Andes, fjords and the Southern Patagonian Ice Field. Mocopulli Airport is in Chiloe Island; it offers flights to Santiago via LAN Express airlines.

DhyƒÅna is taken up in Yoga exercises, and is a means to samadhi and self-knowledge. The various concepts of dhyana and its practice originated in the Sramanic movement of ancient India, which started before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and the practice has been influential within the diverse traditions of Hinduism. It is, in Hinduism, a part of a self-directed awareness and unifying Yoga process by which the yogi realizes Self (Atman, soul), one's relationship with other living beings, and Ultimate Reality.Edwin Bryant (2009), The Yoga s≈´tras of Pata√±jali: a new edition, translation, and commentary with insights from the traditional commentators, North Point Press, , pages xxii, xxix-xxx Dhyana is also found in other Indian religions such as Buddhism and Jainism. These developed along with dhyana in Hinduism, partly independently, partly influencing each other. The term Dhyana appears in Aranyaka and Brahmana layers of the Vedas but with unclear meaning, while in the early Upanishads it appears in the sense of \\"contemplation, meditation\\" and an important part of self-knowledge process. It is described in numerous Upanishads of Hinduism, and in Patanjali's Yogasutras - a key text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy.Ian Whicher (1998), The Integrity of the Yoga Darsana: A Reconsideration of Classical Yoga, State University of New York Press, , page 49Stuart Sarbacker (2011), Yoga Powers (Editor: Knut A. Jacobsen), Brill, , page 195 Etymology and meaning DhyƒÅna (Sanskrit: ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡§æ‡§®, Pali: ‡§ù‡§æ‡§®) means \\"contemplation, reflection\\" and \\"profound, abstract meditation\\".dhyAna, Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary (2008 revision), Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon, Germany The root of the word is Dhi, which in the earliest layer of text of the Vedas refers to \\"imaginative vision\\" and associated with goddess Saraswati with powers of knowledge, wisdom and poetic eloquence.Jan Gonda (1963), The Vision of Vedic Poets, Walter de Gruyter, , pages 289-301 This term developed into the variant dhya- and dhyana, or \\"meditation\\".William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, , pages 171-177, 222 Thomas Berry states that Dhyana, is \\"sustained attention\\" and the \\"application of mind to the chosen point of concentration\\".Thomas Berry (1992), Religions of India: Hinduism, Yoga, Buddhism, Columbia University Press, , page 101 Dhyana is contemplating, reflecting on whatever Dharana has focused on.Jan Gonda (1963), The Vision of Vedic Poets, Walter de Gruyter, , pages 289-290 If in the sixth limb of yoga one is concentrating on a personal deity, Dhyana is its contemplation. If the concentration was on one object, Dhyana is non- judgmental, non-presumptuous observation of that object.Charlotte Bell (2007), Mindful Yoga, Mindful Life: A Guide for Everyday Practice, Rodmell Press, , pages 151-159 If the focus was on a concept/idea, Dhyana is contemplating that concept/idea in all its aspects, forms and consequences. Dhyana is uninterrupted train of thought, current of cognition, flow of awareness.GN Jha (Translator)(1907), The Yoga-darsana: The sutras of Patanjali with the Bhasya of Vyasa - Book 3 ; Harvard University Archives, pages 94-95K Ramakrishna Rao (2005), Consciousness Studies: Cross-Cultural Perspectives, McFarland, , page 315TR Anantharaman (1996), Ancient Yoga and Modern Science, PHISPC monograph, Volume 14, Issue 7, , pages 44-45 A related term is nididhyƒÅsana, the pondering over Upanishadic statements. It is a composite of three terms, namely dhyai, upasana (\\"dwelling upon\\"), and bhavana (\\"cultivating\\").George Feuerstein Nididhyasitavyah - the deep pondering of self (atman), whereupon the Self (Brahman) become known Origins The term dhyana is used in Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, with somewhat different meanings. The origins of the practice of dhyana, which culminates into samadhi, are a matter of dispute. According to Bronkhorst, the mainstream concept is evidenced in Jain, Buddhist and early Hindu scriptures. Dhyana, states Sagarmal Jain, has been essential to Jaina religious practices, but the origins of Dhyana and Yoga in the pre-canonical era (before 6th-century BCE) is unclear, and it likely developed in the Sramanic culture of ancient India,Sagarmal Jain (2015), Yoga in Jainism (Editor: Christopher Key Chapple), Routledge, . pages 14-15 Several ≈õrama·πáa movements are known to have existed in India before the 6th century BCE (pre-Buddha, pre-Mahavira), and these influenced both the ƒÅstika and nƒÅstika traditions of Indian philosophy.Reginald Ray (1999), Buddhist Saints in India, Oxford University Press, , pp. 237‚Äì240, 247‚Äì249Andrew J. Nicholson (2013), Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History, Columbia University Press, , Chapter 9 The earliest Jaina texts, on Dhyana such as Sutrakranga, Antakrta-Dasanga and Rsibhashita, mention Uddaka Ramaputta who is said to be the teacher of some meditation methods to Buddha, as well as the originator of Vipassana and Preksha meditation techniques. The Jaina tradition believes Rishabhanatha, the first Tirthankara, to have founded meditation, but there is no historical confirming evidence. The earliest mention of Dhyana in the canonical Jaina texts simply mention Dhyana as a means of emancipation, but in them ascetic practices are not emphasized nor is the discussion as systematic as in later Jaina texts or Hindu texts such as the Patanjali's Yogasutras. There is no archeological or literary evidence, states Sagarmal Jain, about the origins of systems for Dhyana and Yoga, and there is a great deal of similarity between Jaina, Buddhist, Ajivika, Samkhya, Yoga and other ancient Indian traditions. The earliest texts, such as Tattvarthasutra suggest that these ideas developed in parallel, sometimes with different terms for similar ideas in various Indian traditions, influencing each other.Sagarmal Jain (2015), Yoga in Jainism (Editor: Christopher Key Chapple), Routledge, , pages 14-28 Buddhism introduced its own ideas, states Bronkhorst, such as the four dhyanas, which did not affect the mainstream meditation traditions in Jaina and Hindu traditions for a long time. All traditions, Jainism, Buddhism and Hinduism, introduced unique aspects and context to Dhyana, and mutually influenced each other. According to Bronkhorst, while Jaina and Hindu meditation traditions predate Buddhism, the Buddhist terminology such as Samadhi, may have influenced the wording found in one of the several types of Dhyana found in the Mahabharata as well as parts of Patanjali's Yogasutras. Alexander Wynne interprets Bronkhorst as stating that dhyana was a Jaina tradition, from which both Hinduism and Buddhism borrowed ideas on meditation. Wynne adds that Bronkhorst opinion \\"understates the role of meditation\\" in early Brahmanical tradition. Dhyana was incorporated into Buddhism from Brahmanical practices, suggests Wynne, in the Nikayas ascribed to Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. In early Brahamical yoga, the goal of meditation was considered to be a nondual state identical to unmanifest state of Brahman, where subject-object duality had been dissolved. The early Buddhist practices adapted these old yogic methods, pairing it to mindfulness and attainment of insight. Kalupahana states that the Buddha \\"reverted to the meditational practices\\" he had learned from Alara Kalama and Uddaka Ramaputta. In Hinduism, state Jones and Ryan, the term first appears in the Upanishads. Techniques of concentration or meditation are a Vedic tradition, states Frits Staal, because these ideas are found in the early Upanishads as dhyana or abhidhyana.Frits Staal (2009), Discovering the Vedas: Origins, Mantras, Rituals, Insights, Penguin, , pages 182-184 In most of the later Hindu yoga traditions, which derive from Patanjali's Raja Yoga, dhyana is \\"a refined meditative practice\\", a \\"deeper concentration of the mind\\", which is taken up after preceding exercises such as mastering pranayama (breath control) and dharana (mental focus). Discussion in Hindu texts =Vedas and Upanishads= The term dhyanam appears in Vedic literature, such as hymn 4.36.2 of the Rigveda and verse 10.11.1 of the Taittiriya Aranyaka.Maurice Bloomfield, A Vedic concordance, Harvard University Press, page 523Jan Gonda (1963), The Vision of Vedic Poets, Walter de Gruyter, , pages 292-293 The term, in the sense of meditation, appears in the Upanishads.William Cenkner (1995), A Tradition of Teachers, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 23-25 The Kaushitaki Upanishad uses it in the context of mind and meditation in verses 3.2 to 3.6, for example as follows: The term appears in the context of \\"contemplate, reflect, meditate\\" in verses of chapters 1.3, 2.22, 5.1, 7.6, 7.7 and 7.26 of the Chandogya Upanishad, chapters 3.5, 4.5 and 4.6 of the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad and verses 6.9 to 6.24 of the Maitri Upanishad.Paul Deussen (1997). Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 174, 180-181, 351-364 The word Dhyana refers to meditation in Chandogya Upanishad, while the Prashna Upanishad asserts that the meditation on AUM () leads to the world of Brahman (Ultimate Reality). The development of meditation in the Vedic era paralleled the ideas of \\"interiorization\\", where social, external yajna fire rituals (Agnihotra) were replaced with meditative, internalized rituals (Prana-agnihotra).Henk Bodewitz (1997), Jaiminƒ´ya BrƒÅhma·πáa I, 1‚Äì65: Translation and Commentary, Brill Academic, , pp. 23, 230‚Äì233 with footnote 6, 328-329Paul Deussen (1997). Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 645-646 This interiorization of Vedic fire-ritual into yogic meditation ideas from Hinduism, that are mentioned in the Samhita and Aranyaka layers of the Vedas and more clearly in chapter 5 of the Chandogya Upanishad (~800 to 600 BCE), are also found in later Buddhist texts and esoteric variations such as the Dighanikaya, Mahavairocana-sutra and the Jyotirmnjari, wherein the Buddhist texts describe meditation as \\"inner forms of fire oblation/sacrifice\\".Tsunehiko Sugiki (2015), Homa Variations: The Study of Ritual Change across the Longue Duree (Editors: Richard Payne and Michael Witzel), Oxford University Press, , pages 167-169, 176-177, 186, 193-194Yael Bentor (2000), Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 120, No. 4, pages 594-613 This interiorization of fire rituals, where life is conceptualized as an unceasing sacrifice and emphasis is placed on meditation occurs in the classic Vedic world, in the early Upanishads and other texts such as the Shrauta Sutras and verse 2.18 of Vedic Vaikhanasa Smarta Sutra.Yael Bentor (2000), Interiorized Fire Rituals in India and in Tibet, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 120, No. 4, pages 596-597 Beyond the early Upanishads composed before 5th-century BCE, the term Dhyana and the related terms such as Dhyai (Sanskrit: ‡§ß‡•ç‡§Ø‡•à, deeply meditate)Dhyai Sanskrit English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany appears in numerous Upanishads composed after the 5th-century BCE, such as: chapter 1 of Shvetashvatara Upanishad, chapters 2 and 3 of Mundaka Upanishad, chapter 3 of Aitareya Upanishad, chapter 11 of Mahanarayana Upanishad, and in various verses of Kaivalya Upanishad, Chulika Upanishad, Atharvasikha Upanishad, Brahma Upanishad, Brahmabindu Upanishad, Amritabindu Upanishad, Tejobindu Upanishad, Paramahamsa Upanishad, Kshuriki Upanishad, Dhyana-bindu Upanishad, Atharvasiras Upanishad, Maha Upanishad, Pranagnihotra Upanishad, Yogasikha Upanishad, Yogatattva Upanishad, Kathasruti Upanishad, Hamsa Upanishad, Atmaprabodha Upanishad and Visudeva Upanishad. =Brahma Sutras= The Brahma- sutras, which distills the teachings of the Upanishads and is one of three foundational texts of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, states that Dhyana is not Prativedam (or, one for each Veda), and meditation belongs to all Vedic schools. Adi Shankara dedicates an extensive chapter on meditation, in his commentary on the Brahma-sutras, in Sadhana as essential to spiritual practice.William Cenkner (1995), A Tradition of Teachers, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 71-82 with footnotes His discussion there is similar to his extensive commentary on Dhyana in his Bhasya on Bhagavad Gita and the early Upanishads. =Dharma Sutras= The verse 30.8 of the ancient Vasistha Dharma-sutra declares meditation as a virtue, and interiorized substitute equivalent of a fire sacrifice.Henk Bodewitz (1999), Violence Denied (Editors: Jan E. M. Houben and Karel Rijk van Kooij), BRILL, , page 28 footnote 19 =Bhagavad Gita= The term Dhyana, and related words with the meaning of meditation appears in many chapters of the Bhagavad Gita, such as in chapters 2, 12, 13 and 18.G. A. Jacob (1963), A concordance of the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 472-474 The chapter 6 of the Gita is titled as the \\"Yoga of Meditation\\". The Bhagavad Gita, one of the three key books of Vedanta school of Hinduism, states four Marga (paths) to purify one's mind and to reach the summit of spirituality ‚Äì the path of Unselfish Work, the path of Knowledge, the path of Devotion and the path of Meditation (Dhyana).Winthrop Sargeant (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty-fifth‚ÄìAnniversary Edition (Editor: Christopher Chapple), State University of New York Press, , page xv Huston Smith summarizes the need and value of meditation in Gita, as follows (abridged): Meditation in the Bhagavad Gita is a means to one's spiritual journey, requiring three moral values ‚Äì Satya (truthfulness), Ahimsa (non-violence) and Aparigraha (non-covetousness). Dhyana in this ancient Hindu text, states Huston Smith, can be about whatever the person wants or finds spiritual, ranging from \\"the manifestation of divinity in a religious symbol in a human form\\", or an inspiration in nature such as \\"a snow-covered mountain, a serene lake in moonlight, or a colorful horizon at sunrise or sunset\\", or melodic sounds or syllables such as those that \\"are intoned as mantras and rhythmically repeated\\" like Om that is audibly or silent contemplated on.Winthrop Sargeant (2009), The Bhagavad Gita: Twenty- fifth‚ÄìAnniversary Edition (Editor: Christopher Chapple), State University of New York Press, , pages xvi, 272-321, 331 The direction of deep meditation, in the text, is towards detaching the mind from sensory distractions and disturbances outside of oneself, submerging it instead on the indwelling spirit and one's soul towards the state of Samadhi, a state of bliss (Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6: Yoga of Meditation).Eknath Easwaran (2011), Essence of the Bhagavad Gita, Nilgiri, , pages 126-146, 280 The Gita presents a synthesis of the Brahmanical concept of Dharma with bhakti, the yogic ideals of liberation through jnana, and Samkhya philosophy. It is the \\"locus classicus\\" of the \\"Hindu synthesis\\" which emerged around the beginning of the Common Era, integrating Brahmanic and shramanic ideas with theistic devotion.Arthur Llewellyn Basham, Hinduism - The Bhagavad Gita, Encyclop√¶dia Britannica The Bhagavad Gita talks of four branches of yoga: *Karma Yoga: The yoga of work in the world *JnƒÅna yoga: The yoga of knowledge and intellectual endeavor *Bhakti Yoga: The yoga of devotion *DhyƒÅna Yoga: The yoga of meditation (sometimes called Raja yoga or Ashtanga yoga) The Dhyana Yoga system is specifically described by Krishna in chapter 6 of the Bhagavad Gita to Arjuna. =The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali= In the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali (dated ca. 400 CE), a key text of the Yoga school of Hindu philosophy, Dhyana is the seventh limb of this path, following Dharana and preceding Samadhi. Dhyana is integrally related to Dharana, one leads to other. Dharana is a state of mind, Dhyana the process of mind. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana in that the meditator becomes actively engaged with its focus. Patanjali defines contemplation (Dhyana) as the mind process, where the mind is fixed on something, and then there is \\"a course of uniform modification of knowledge\\".The Yoga Philosophy TR Tatya (Translator), with Bhojaraja commentary; Harvard University Archives, page 94-95 Bronkhorst states that Buddhist influences are noticeable in the first chapter of the Yogasutras, and confirmed by sutra 1.20 because it mentions asamprajnata samadhi is preceded by \\"trust (sraddha), energy (virya), mindfulness (smriti), concentration (samadhi), and insight (prajna)\\". According to Bronkhorst, \\"the definition of Yoga given in the first chapter of the Yoga Sutra does not fit the descriptions contained in the same chapter,\\" and this may suggest the sutra incorporated Buddhist elements as described in the four jhanas. Wynne, in contrast to Bronkhorst's theory, states that the evidence in early Buddhist texts, such as those found in Suttapitaka, suggest that these foundational ideas on formless meditation and element meditation were borrowed from pre-Buddha Brahamanical sources attested in early Upanishads and ultimately the cosmological theory found in the Nasadiya-sukta of the Rigveda. Adi Shankara, in his commentary on Yoga Sutras, distinguishes Dhyana from Dharana, by explaining Dhyana as the yoga state when there is only the \\"stream of continuous thought about the object, uninterrupted by other thoughts of different kind for the same object\\"; Dharana, states Shankara, is focussed on one object, but aware of its many aspects and ideas about the same object. Shankara gives the example of a yogin in a state of dharana on morning sun may be aware of its brilliance, color and orbit; the yogin in dhyana state contemplates on sun's orbit alone for example, without being interrupted by its color, brilliance or other related ideas.Trevor Leggett (1983), Shankara on the Yoga Sutras, Volume 2, Routledge, , pages 283-284 In Patanjali's Raja Yoga, also called \\"meditation yoga\\",Vyn Bailey (2009), Patanjali's Meditation Yoga, Simon & Schuster Australia, dhyana is \\"a refined meditative practice\\", a \\"deeper concentration of the mind\\", which is taken up after preceding exercises. In Hinduism, dhyƒÅna is considered to be an instrument to gain self- knowledge. It is a part of a self-directed awareness and unifying Yoga process by which a world that by default is experienced as disjointed, comes to be experienced as Self, and an integrated oneness with Brahman. The Brahman has been variously defined in Hinduism, ranging from non-theistic non-dualistic Ultimate Reality or supreme soul, to theistic dualistic God.Stephen Philips (1998), Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Brahman to Derrida (Editor; Edward Craig), Routledge, , pages 1-4Klaus K. Klostermaier (2007), A Survey of Hinduism, Third Edition, State University of New York Press, , Chapter 12: Atman and Brahman - Self and AllMichael Myers (2000), Brahman: A Comparative Theology, Routledge, , pages 124-127 Dharana The stage of meditation preceding dhyƒÅna is called dharana. Dharana, which means \\"holding on\\", is the focusing and holding one's awareness to one object for a long period of time. In Yogasutras, the term implies fixing one's mind on an object of meditation, which could be one's breath or the tip of one's nose or the image of one's personal deity or anything of the yogi's choice. In the Jangama DhyƒÅna technique, for example, the meditator concentrates the mind to a spot between the eyebrows. According to Pata√±jali, this is one method of achieving the initial concentration (dhƒÅra·πáƒÅ: Yoga Sutras, III: 1) necessary for the mind to become introverted in meditation (dhyƒÅna: Yoga Sutras, III: 2). In deeper practice of the technique, the mind concentrated between the eyebrows begins to automatically lose all location and focus on the watching itself. This step prepares one to begin the practice of Dhyana. Swami Vivekananda in meditating yogic posture. Dhyana The Yogasutras in verse 3.2 and elsewhere, states Edwin Bryant, defines Dhyana as the \\"continuous flow of the same thought or image of the object of meditation, without being distracted by any other thought\\".Edwin Bryant (2009), The Yoga s≈´tras of Pata√±jali: a new edition, translation, and commentary with insights from the traditional commentators, North Point Press, , pages 303-305 Vivekananda explains Dhyana in Patanjali's Yogasutras as, \\"When the mind has been trained to remain fixed on a certain internal or external location, there comes to it the power of flowing in an unbroken current, as it were, towards that point. This state is called Dhyana\\".Swami Vivekananda (1915), , Volume 1, 2nd Edition, Harvard University Archives, page 206; Archive 2: While Dharana was the stage in yoga where the yogi held one's awareness to one object for a long period of time, Dhyana is concentrated meditation where he or she contemplates without interruption the object of meditation, beyond any memory of ego or anything else.The New Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (2003 Edition), Volume 4, , page 56, Article on Yoga In Dhyana, the meditator is not conscious of the act of meditation (i.e. is not aware that he/she is meditating) but is only aware that he/she exists (consciousness of being), his mind and the object of meditation. Dhyana is distinct from Dharana, in that the yogi contemplates on the object of meditation and the object's aspects only, free from distractions, with his mind during Dhyana. With practice, the process of Dhyana awakens self-awareness (soul, the purusha or Atman), the fundamental level of existence and Ultimate Reality in Hinduism, the non-afflicted, conflictless and blissful state of freedom and liberation (moksha).Basant Pradhan (2014), Yoga and Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy, Springer Academic, , pages 49-50RS Bajpai (2002), The Splendours And Dimensions Of Yoga, Atlantic Publishers, , pages 189-196 Samadhi The Dhyana step prepares a yogi to proceed towards practicing Samadhi. Swami Vivekananda describes the teachings of Yogasutras in the following way: Michael Washburn states that the Yogasutras text identifies stepwise stages for meditative practice progress, and that \\"Patanjali distinguishes between Dharana which is effortful focusing of attention, Dhyana which is easy continuous one- pointedness, and Samadhi which is absorption, ecstasy, contemplation\\".Michael Washburn (1988), The Ego and the Dynamic Ground: A Transpersonal Theory of Human Development, State University of New York Press, , page 219 A person who begins meditation practice, usually practices Dharana. With practice he is able to gain ease in which he learns how to contemplate in a sharply focussed fashion, and then \\"he is able more and more easily to give uninterrupted attention to the meditation object; that is to say, he attains Dhyana\\". With further practice, the yogi \\"ceases being detachedly vigilant\\" and enters \\"a state of fusion with the meditation object\\" which is Samadhi.Michael Washburn (1988), The Ego and the Dynamic Ground: A Transpersonal Theory of Human Development, State University of New York Press, , page 220 Samadhi is oneness with the object of meditation. There is no distinction between act of meditation and the object of meditation. Samadhi is of two kinds, with and without support or an object of meditation:Michael Washburn (1988), The Ego and the Dynamic Ground: A Transpersonal Theory of Human Development, State University of New York Press, , pages 220-221 * Samprajnata Samadhi, also called savikalpa samadhi and Sabija Samadhi, is object-centered, and is associated with deliberation, reflection, blissful ecstasy that has been assisted by an object or anchor point. The first two, deliberation and reflection, form the basis of the various types of samapatti: ** Savitarka, \\"deliberative\\": The citta(‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§)is concentrated upon a gross object of meditation, and the yogi's deliberates and fuses with it, becoming unaware of everything else. Conceptualization (vikalpa) here is in the form of perception and the knowledge of the object of meditation. When the deliberation is ended this is called nirvitaka samadhi. ** Savichara, \\"reflective\\": the citta(‡§ö‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§§)is concentrated upon an abstract object of meditation, which is not perceptible to the senses, but arrived at through inference. The object of meditation can be inferred from the senses, the process of cognition, the mind, the I-am-ness, or the buddhi (intellect). The stilling of reflection is called nirvichara samapatti. *Asamprajnata Samadhi, also called Nirvikalpa SamadhiSri Swami Sivananda, Raja Yoga Samadhi and Nirbija Samadhi: the state achieved when the meditation is without the help of a support or an object. Both object-centered and objectless-centered meditative practice, in Hindu texts, leads to progressively more bright, pellucid and poised state of \\"powerful, pure, Sattvic\\" state of blissful Self, ultimately leading to the knowledge of purusha or Atman-Brahman (soul), states Michael Washburn. This is the state, in Hindu tradition, where states Gregor Maehle, the yogi or yogini realizes \\"the Atman in you is the Atman in everyone\\", and leading to the realization of Self. Samyama The practice of Dharana, Dhyana and SamƒÅdhi together is designated as Samyama (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡§Ç‡§Ø‡§Æ, holding together) in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali.Mircea Eliade, Willard Ropes Trask and David Gordon White (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , pages 85-87 Samyama, asserts the text, is a powerful meditative tool and can be applied to a certain object, or entire class of objects. A yogi who does Samyama on Pratyaya (notions, customs) of men, states sutra 3.19 of the text, knows the series of \\"psycho-mental states of other men\\". A yogi after successfully completing Samyama on \\"distinction of object and idea\\" realizes the \\"cries of all creatures\\", states sutra 3.17. A Samyama on friendliness, compassion and joy leads to these powers emerging within the yogi, states sutra 3.23. The meditation technique discussed in the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali is thus, states Mircea Eliade, a means to knowledge and siddhi (yogic power).Stephen Phillips (2009), Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy, Columbia University Press, , pages 141-142 VƒÅcaspati Mi≈õra, a scholar of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, in his bhasya on the Yogasutra's 3.30 wrote, \\"Whatever the yogin desires to know, he should perform samyama in respect to that object\\".Mircea Eliade, Willard Ropes Trask and David Gordon White (2009), Yoga: Immortality and Freedom, Princeton University Press, , page 88 with footnote 119 Moksha (freedom, liberation) is one such practice, where the object of samyama is Sattva (pure existence), Atman (soul) and Purusha (Universal principle) or Bhagavan (God).TS Rukmani (1993), Researches in Indian and Buddhist Philosophy (Editor: RƒÅma Kara·πáa ≈öarmƒÅ), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 218-220, also 217-224 Adi Shankara, another scholar of the Vedanta school of Hinduism, extensively commented on samyama as a means for Jnana-yoga (path of knowledge) to achieve the state of Jivanmukta (living liberation).Jeaneane D Fowler (2012), The Bhagavad Gita, Sussex University Press, , pages 53, 83-85, 148-149Jonathan Bader (1990), Meditation in ≈öa·πÖkara's VedƒÅnta, Aditya Prakashan, , pages 42-46 Samapattih By the time the Yogasutras were compiled, the Hindu traditions had two broad forms of meditation, namely the ecstatic and enstatic types.Stuart Ray Sarbacker (2006), Samadhi, State University of New York Press, , pages 53-60Frits Staal (1975), Exploring Mysticism: A Methodological Essay, University of California Press, , pages 86-91 Comparison of Dhyana in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism ;Buddhism According to Jianxin Li Samprajnata Samadhi of Hinduism may be compared to the rupa jhanas of Buddhism. This interpretation may conflict with Gombrich and Wynne, according to whom the first and second jhana represent concentration, whereas the third and fourth jhana combine concentration with mindfulness. According to Eddie Crangle, the first jhana resembles Patanjali's Samprajnata Samadhi, which both share the application of vitarka and vicara. Asamprajnata Samadhi, states Jianxin Li, may be compared to the arupa jhanas of Buddhism, and to Nirodha-Samapatti. Crangle and other scholars state that sabija-asamprajnata samadhi resembles the four formless jhanas, with the fourth arupa jhana of Buddhism being analogous to Patanjali's \\"objectless dhyana and samadhi\\".Stuart Ray Sarbacker (2006), Samadhi, SUNY Press, , pages 104-106 According to Sarbacker and other scholars, while there are parallels between Dhyana in Hinduism and in Buddhism, the phenomenological states and the emancipation experiences are described differently. Dhyana in Buddhism is aiming towards cessation and realization of shunya (state of null), while Dhyana Hinduism is aiming towards realization of Atman (soul) and consequent union with Brahman. Nirvana (or Nibbana), the desired end through Dhyana in Buddhism, is the realization that there is no permanent self nor permanent consciousness; while Moksha, the desired end through Dhyana in Hinduism, is acceptance of Self, realization of liberating knowledge, the consciousness of Oneness with all existence and understanding the whole universe as the Self.David Loy (1982), Enlightenment in Buddhism and Advaita Vedanta: Are Nirvana and Moksha the Same?, International Philosophical Quarterly, 23(1), pp 65-74 Nirvana of Buddhism starts with the premise that \\"Self is merely an illusion, there is no Self\\", Moksha of Hinduism on the other hand, starts with the premise that everything is the Self, states David Loy. The soteriological emphasis in Dhyana, therefore is different in Buddhism and Hinduism.Stuart Ray Sarbacker (2006), Samadhi, SUNY Press, , pages 106-108 ;Jainism Ancient Jaina scholars developed their own theories on Dhyana like other Indian religions, but little detail is mentioned in Jaina texts,Padmanabh S Jaini (2014), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 251-258 and the Dhyana practices varied by sects within the Jaina tradition.Kurt Titze (2001), Jainism, Motilal Banarsidass, , page 266 Broadly, Jainism texts identify four types of meditation based on the nature of object.Paul Dundas (2002), The Jains, Routledge, , pages 166-169 Arta-dhyana, states Jaina meditation literature, occurs when one's focus is on anguish and unpleasant things. Raudra-dhyana occurs when the focus is on anger or perverse ideas or objects. Dharmya-dhyana focuses on religious ideas or virtuous objects, while Shukla-dhyana is the focus on pure ideas or bright objects. This classification of four Dhyana types may have roots, suggests Paul Dundas, in the earlier Hindu texts related to Kashmir Shaivism. Dundas states that Jaina tradition emphasized Dhyana, but its meditation-related literature likely went through two stages of formulation, the early stage independent of other Indian traditions, one which concerned itself with \\"cessation of mind and physical activities\\" rather than their transformation as in other Indian traditions; followed by a later stage, likely post- Yogasutras, where Jaina scholars of different sects restructured the contemplative model to assimilate elements of Hindu and Buddhist techniques on Dhyana. The terminology used in some Jainism texts however, states John Cort, are different.John Cort (1998), Open Boundaries: Jain Communities and Cultures in Indian History, State University of New York Press, , pages 17-20 The premise of Atman (soul) exists, that is found in Hinduism, is also present in Jainism. The soteriological goals of Jaina spiritual meditation are similar to Hindu spiritual meditation, aimed at experiential contact with the \\"ultimate self\\", wherein the yogi realizes the blissful, unfettered, formless soul and siddha-hood ‚Äì a totally liberated state of being. Related concept: Upasana Two concepts associated with Dhyana found in ancient and medieval Hindu texts are Upasana and Vidya. Upasana means \\"come near to something, some idea\\" and denotes the act and state of meditation, while Vidya means knowledge and is the consequence of Dhyana.William Cenkner (1995), A Tradition of Teachers, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 23-25, 74-75 The term Upasana typically appears in the context of ritual meditative practices, such as before a devotional symbol such as deity or during a yajna type practice or community oriented bhakti worship singing, and is a subtype of Dhyana.John C Plott (1974), A Philosophy of Devotion, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 70-71 The 11th-century Vishishtadvaita Vedanta scholar Ramanuja noted that upasana and dhyana are equated in the Upanishads with other terms such as vedana (knowing) and smrti (remembrance). Ramanuja holds that all these are phases of meditation, adding that they must be done with love or bhakti.
