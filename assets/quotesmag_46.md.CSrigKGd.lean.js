Experimental systems for plant morphogenesis Coleochaete has a sterile jacket of cells that surround the gametangia and zygotes that are protected by a layer of sterile cells after fertilization. However, unlike land plants, Coleochaete has zygotic meiosis, meiosis taking place directly in the zygote and not in diploid cells resulting from mitotic division of the zygote.

Miller, Wendell Scott, and Ronald Hines (l-r) of the Black American Racers Association The Black American Racers Association (BARA) was founded in August 1972 in Trenton, New Jersey by Leonard W. Miller, Ron Hines, Eugene Gadson, and Charles Singleton. BARA was formed to give recognition to black racing drivers, crews, mechanics, car owners, and other members of the auto racing community and corporations that help promote black racing development. BARA ceased operations in 1978.  Objectives  BARA's short-term goals were to publicize to the American public the all but forgotten achievements of blacks in racing, to interest minority youth in racing-oriented careers, and to increase black spectator interest in motor sports. Long-term goals included educating BARA's membership in building successful racing teams, reducing sponsorship inequities facing black racers and teams, and supporting the continuation and growth of racing in general.  Membership and programs  In 1974, BARA's regular membership cost $10, and a lifetime membership was $100. Both levels received decals, patches, and newsletters. The most distinctive benefit of BARA membership was a membership card honored for discounts by speed shops and auto stores throughout the United States. Those noted in the association's yearbook included Hollywood Sam's in Detroit and Trio Auto Supply in Trenton, New Jersey.  Conventions, award recipients and sponsors  In BARA's five years in existence, its membership grew to nearly 5000 persons, including several car clubs. Each year BARA sponsored a dinner dance honoring black racing's most accomplished individuals. Sumner \\"Red\\" Oliver, a black racing pioneer from Indianapolis, was honored at BARA's first convention in Trenton, New Jersey in 1974, for his success as a driver from the 1920s through the 1950s and as a mechanic on the United States Auto Club (USAC) championship circuit. In the 1970s, Oliver was a crew member on the Patrick Petroleum-Wally Dallenbach Indy car team. Corporate recognition at the 1974 convention included the BARA-Schaefer Brewing Company Award to Stock Car Racing magazine for its coverage of blacks in racing in 1973, and to Champion Spark Plug Company for its support of black racing development. BARA's 1975 convention in Arlington, Virginia honored Wendell Scott, the well-known, longtime NASCAR competitor from Danville, Virginia and BARA's first vice-president. Scott was the only black to win a NASCAR race, in Jacksonville, Florida, in 1961. The 1975 BARA‚ÄìSchaefer Brewing Company awards were presented to the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company for its historic pioneering sponsorship of Black American Racers Inc., a Formula Super Vee Gold Cup and Formula 5000 road racing team with driver Benny Scott, and to Wendell Scott for his pioneering efforts in NASCAR. (The Ford Motor Company refused to recognize Scott's accomplishments at the awards banquet.) At BARA's 1976 convention BARA's first president, Malcolm Durham, was honored for his historic accomplishments in drag racing. Durham won many times on the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) circuit and was well known on the associated match racing circuit with his \\"Strip Blazer\\" Pro Stock drag cars. He was the successful owner-operator of Supercar Engineering, a racing car shop in Hyattsville, Maryland, until his death in 2006. His sponsors included Pennzoil, Cragar Industries, A&A; Fiberglass, Inc., Accel Ignitions, Edelbrock Corporation, Champion Spark Plug Company, Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, Hurst Performance, the motor oil company STP, and Fram filters. At the 1977 convention, BARA honored Tommy Thompson of Somerset, New Jersey, for his accomplishments as the driver and chief mechanic for the Black American Racers, Inc. (BAR) Formula Super Vee road racer. Thompson won the Northeast Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) Formula Super Vee Championship in 1977 - the first black to accomplish such a feat. At this convention - prior to his first professional fight - BARA awarded Sugar Ray Leonard a lifetime membership for inspiring youth in the Baltimore area and around the country to achieve in sports. Tommy Thompson, who later died in a crash at a 1978 race in Trenton, was recognized with awards from STP, Trio Auto Supply of Trenton, and Detroit- based General Kinetics Cams.  Publications  BARA published a Black Racers Yearbook in 1974. It was an official annual publication of BARA and sold for one dollar. The publication had 32 pages and consisted of articles covering topics such as how to obtain sponsorship and challenges for black racers. It was the only yearbook the association published. This now rare publication covered black racing history from the 1930s to the early 1970s. Seven major corporations placed ads in the yearbook, and it sold thousands of copies in the United States. BARA also published a monthly newsletter, which highlighted accomplishments by blacks in all phases of auto racing around the United States.  Association race event  On March 10, 1974, at Madison Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey, BARA sponsored Englishtown's 1974 opening program, a Pro Stock Race featuring the United Soul Racing Team. This race included many of drag racing's African American stars of the time, including Rufus \\"Brooklyn Heavy\\" Boyd, \\"Strip Blazer\\" Malcolm Durham, Bill \\"Tuff Rabbit\\" White, \\"Wicked\\" Will Smallwood, Sam Carroll, and Joe Fisher, driving Ronald Lyle's Hemi Colt. Herb McCandless drove Brooklyn Heavy's second car. More than 25,000 spectators were in attendance for this event.  Legacy  BARA's first chairman, Leonard W. Miller, remains one of America's most knowledgeable authorities on the history of blacks in motor racing. He has been owner and president of various winning teams in drag racing, road racing, dirt track racing, and oval track racing. He is the author of Silent Thunder: Breaking Through Cultural, Racial, and Class Barriers in Motorsports (2004), a chronicle of his life in auto racing. Miller and Ron Hines, who was BARA's first secretary, enter their classic cars and street rods at auto shows in the Northeast. They are both in contact with Eugene Gadson, who is a retired psychologist. Charles Singleton, a car collector, is assistant manager of a funeral home in New Jersey. Both Gadson and Singleton are dedicated NASCAR fans. They have attended NASCAR races since 1968, including the Daytona 500.  References  * Amsterdam News (New York, NY), August 11, 1973, p.

At age 12, in the 5th grade, Becerra quit school to work in a carriage repair shop. Professional career Becerra received his first public notice in the Mexican sports world by scoring an upset over the vastly more experienced Manuel Armenteros. After some ups and downs, Becerra earned a top 10 ranking by knocking out former world champion Mario D'Agata. A short time later, Becerra won the Lineal bantamweight championship with a knockout over Alphonse Halimi. After two successful title defenses, Becerra lost a stunning upset, being knocked out by club-fighter Eloy Sanchez in a non-title fight. Becerra was so dejected by the defeat that he announced his retirement at age 24. In 1962, Mexican club fighter, Rudy Coronado was seriously injured in a fight. On a special benefit show for Coronado and his family, Becerra returned to the ring and won a 6-round decision over Alberto Martinez. Becerra donated his fight-purse to the injured boxer's family.

With a surface area of approximately 105 km2, the microplate is located between 32¬∞ and 35¬∞S and 109¬∞ and 112¬∞W.Francheteau, J., A. Yelles-Chaouche, and H. Craig, \\"The Juan Fernandez microplate north of the Nazca-Pacific-Antarctic plate junction at 35¬∞S\\" Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 86, 253‚Äì268, 1987. The plate is located at a triple junction between the Pacific Plate, Antarctic Plate, and Nazca Plate. Approximately 2000 km to the west of South America, it is, on average, 3000 meters deep with its shallowest point coming to approximately 1600 meters, and its deepest point reaching 4400 meters.Anderson-Fontana, S., J. F. Engeln, P. Lundgren, R. L. Larson, and S. Stein, Tectonics and evolution of the Juan Fernandez microplate at the Pacific-Nazca-Antarctic triple junction, J. Geophys. Res., 91, 2005‚Äì2018, 1986. Discovery The Juan Fernandez Microplate was first discovered in 1972 via seismicity charts, which showed semi-circular patterns at the Pacific-Nazca-Antarctica triple junction.Ellen M. Herron.‚ÄúTwo Small Crustal Plates in the South Pacific near Easter Island.‚Äù Nature Physical Science, vol. 240, no. 98, 1972, pp. 35‚Äì37.Forsyth, Donald W.‚ÄúMechanisms of Earthquakes and Plate Motions in the East Pacific.‚Äù Earth and Planetary Science Letters, vol. 17, no. 1, 1972, pp. 189‚Äì193. This implied that Shear zone were present that were inconsistent with existing plate theories in the area. The microplate, as it is known today, was first mapped and named in 1983, during a Sea Beam survey that specifically mapped the East Pacific Rise (EPR) between the Easter and Juan Fernandez microplates. The first sonar mapping of the JF Microplate was performed in 1983. Shortly after, the RV Endeavor performed another geological survey with the goal of defining the boundaries of the plate and clearly identifying the key features of the triple junction of which the Juan Fernandez Microplate is the center. Since then, the growth of the plate has been theorized to be influenced by spreading ridges between the Pacific and JF Plates, accretion onto the plate by the Nazca and JF shear zones, and compression of both the northernmost and south eastern points of the JF Microplate.Yelles-Chaouche, A., J. Francheteau, and P. Patriat, \\"Evolution of the Juan Fernandez microplate during the last three million years\\", Earth Planet. Sci. Lett., 86, 269‚Äì286, 1987.Larson, R. L., R. C. Searle, M. C. Kleinrock, H. Schouten, R. T. Bird, D. F. Naar, R. I. Rusby, E. E. Hooft, and H. Lasthiotakis,Roller-bearing tectonic evolution of the Juan Fernandez microplate, Nature, 356, 571‚Äì576, 1992. Morphology and geological history This microplate is estimated to have formed approximately 3‚Äì4 Ma ago. Once one single spreading center, the East Pacific Rise at this location split in two, and resulted in two separate spreading ridges between the Nazca Plate and the Pacific Plate. The two spreading ridges, along with the Chile Rise, bounded the JF microplate. These two spreading centers then accreted material onto the JF microplate until it grew into the recognizable shape it is today. As it grew, the northern boundary of the microplate most likely experienced compression due to extreme clockwise rotational force provided by the eastern shear of the Nazca Plate and the western shear of the Pacific Plate. As the Nazca plate has a close coupling to the northern boundary of the plate, rotation of the JF Microplate was at its peak during its beginning stages of formation nearing rotational speeds of 32¬∞ per Ma. However, approximately 2.5 Ma ago, the south-eastern tip of the microplate collided against a fracture zone within the Antarctic Plate thus causing compression of the microplate against the Antarctic Plate and therefore stagnating its rotational motion down to approximately 9¬∞ per Ma at approximately 1 Ma ago. The original couplings causing shear then changed from the Pacific-JF and Nazca-JF boundaries to the Atlantic-JF boundary and Nazca-JF boundaries.Engeln, J. F., S. Stein, J. Werner, and R. G. Gordon, \\"Microplate and shear zone models for oceanic spreading center reorganizations\\" J. Geophys. Res., 93, 2839‚Äì2856, 1988. The past 1 Ma has not seen any significant change in plate rotation and growth rate since. Rotation Since the earliest surveys of the area, theories about the movement of the JF Microplate have evolved to include compression of the plate through rotational movement and also shear zones between two major plates and the JF Microplate driving this clockwise rotational movement. The Pacific Plate is estimated to have a spreading rate anywhere between 13 and 16 cm/yr in relation to the Juan Fernandez MicroPlate. This spreading ridge supplies magma to the west of the plate, acting as a lubricant. In the development stages of the microplate, the Pacific Plate also shared a coupled shear section to the south of the microplate and, together with the Nazca Plate, drove fast rotation of the microplate.Kleinrock, M. C., and R. T. Bird, \\"Southeastern boundary of the Juan Fernandez microplate: Braking microplate rotation and deforming the Antarctic plate\\" J. Geophys. Res., 99, 9237‚Äì9261, 1994. Approximately 2.5 Ma ago the JF Microplate began decoupling from the Pacific Plate and coupling with the Antarctic Plate. The latter severely braked the rotational movement of the microplate. Now, the Nazca and Antarctica Plates, are the plates that share the current shear zones with transform faulting between them and the JF Plate. The Nazca Plate shears to the east while the Antarctica Plate shears relatively to the west, and this continues to drive the rotation of the microplate clockwise as well as consequential compression however at a much slower rate. Compression has been observed on the Juan Fernandez Microplate at the Pacific-Nazca-JF triple junction and the Nazca-Antarctic-JF triple junction, due to the slightly irregular shape of the plate which does not rotate perfectly about its center. Possible future fates Some researchers claim that as the triple Junction that the JF Microplate shares with the Pacific Plate and the Antarctic Plate shifts southwest, the plate will continue to have unimpeded clockwise rotational movement for the foreseeable future.Searle, R. C., R. T. Bird, R. I. Rusby, and D. F. Naar, \\"The development of two oceanic microplates: Easter and Juan Fernandez microplates\\" East Pacific Rise, J. Geol. Soc. London, 150, 965‚Äì976, 1993. Other researchers propose that due to the extent of compression between the JF Microplate and the Antarctic Plate, the microplate will accrete onto the Antarctic plate within the next million years and simply extend the triple junction between the Pacific, Antarctic, and Nazca plate to the current location of the Pacific-Nazca-Juan Fernandez triple junction.Bird, R.

It premiered on 31 October 1903 in Berlin. Characters Plot Rose Bernd speaks to a friend, Flamm, with whom she is now uncomfortable. He flirts with her: \\"Rosie, give me your dear, good, faithful little paw. By heaven, Rosie! Look here, I'm a deucedly queer fellow! I'm damned fond of my dear old woman; that's as true as ...\\" Rose hides her face in her arm and says: \\"You make me want to die o' shame.\\" Flamm complains of his wife: \\"Nine solid years she's been bedridden; at most she creeps around in a wheel chair.- Confound it all, what good is that sort o' thing to me?\\" Later, Streckman greets her, and insinuates he knows of her doings under a field-crucifix with Squire Flamm from Diessdorf. Father Bernd, a deacon, wishes Rose to marry August Keil, a bookbinder, whose health is weak. Rose intimates it would be better to delay the wedding, already the case for 3 years! Keil takes the matter in good stride: \\"I'm made for misfortune! An' that's what I've always told you, Father Bernd, in spite of it all I've taken thought an' I've worked an' God has given his blessin' so that I've not fallen by the wayside. But I can weep; these things aren't for me!\\" Father Bernd and Keil leave, disappointed. Mrs Flamm seeks to find out the reason behind Rose's delays, and guesses that she is pregnant. Having lost a son, Mrs Flamm, alone, exclaims: \\"Ah, lass, 'tis a good fortune that you have, not an evil! There's none that's greater for a woman! Hold it fast!\\" Finally, Rose decides to marry Keil, with Flamm's baby inside her belly. Rose admits loving Flamm, and he loves her, but, he being married, the situation is hopeless. Streckmann returns, and Rose accuses him: \\"I ran to you in the awful terror o' my heart! An' I begged you for the love o' God not to put nothin' between me an' August. I crept on my knees before you- an' you say, you, I ran after you! What was it truly? You committed a crime- a crime against me! An' that's worse'n a scoundrel's trick! 'Twas a crime- doubly and trebly! An' the Lord'll bring it home to you!\\" Streckmann jealously says: \\"I'm as good as Flamm. An' I don't want no more goin's on between you an' him!\\" Rose answers: \\"I'll jump into his bed, scoundrel! An' it wouldn't concern you that much!\\" She continues her accusations: \\"You pounced on me like a wild beast! I know! I tried to get out by the door! An' you took hold an' you rent my bodice an' my skirt! I bled! I might ha' gotten out by the door!\\" Bernd and Keil hear part of Rose's accusations. Baited, Streckmann strikes back, hitting Keil and calling Rose \\"a wench that's common to anybody as wants her....\\" Keil loses an eye. In their home, Mr and Mrs Flamm discuss his adultery. Later, Mrs Flamm attempts to hear Rose about the court proceedings, Father Bernd taking Streckmann to court for slandering his daughter. Rose failed to contradict Strackmann, for which Mrs. Flamm accuses her: \\"An' didn't you tell the truth, girl? You lied when you were under oath, maybe?- Haven't you any idea what that means an' what you've done? How did you happen to do that? How could you think o' such a thing?, whereupon Rose cries out brokenly: \\"I was so ashamed!\\" In Bernd's cottage, Keil tells him: \\"Father, you'll have to withdraw your suit.\\" He refuses. Keil retorts: \\"Our Rose habeen but a weak human bein' like others.\\" Bernd is stunned and answers confusedly : \\"No. I don't understand you rightly!\\" Rose arrives. Bernd is bitter against her, but Keil will stand by her, though worried about her perjury. Rose cries out: \\"O Jesus, Jesus, what did I do? Why did I go an' creep home? Why didn't I stay with my little baby?\\" Stunned that she had given birth, Keil asks: \\"With whom?\\" When a constable arrives to sign papers related to the court proceedings, Rose confesses to the murder of her baby. TV adaptations It has been adapted for TV four times, in 1919, 1957, 1962 and 1998. The 1998 version, directed by Valentin Jeker, featured Johanna Wokalek as Rose Bernd. Wokalek received three newcomer awards and wide critical recognition for her performance in the play.

It may be a physical trading room where the traders gather, or a formalised communications network. Creation of a stock exchange is a strategy of economic development: it provides a means of raising capital for investment. Stock markets may enhance economic activity through the creation of liquidity: a liquid equity market makes investment more attractive because it allows individuals to acquire equity and when required to sell it quickly and cheaply. At the same time, companies enjoy permanent access to capital raised through equity issues. It has been found that countries that open stock markets grow faster, on average, than the control groups.Opening a Stock Exchange. Jenny A. Minier. University of Miami. January 2001. An alternative view is that market liquidity may also hurt economic growth, because it encourages short-termism. A downside of raising capital on a stock exchange is that it may result in loss of company control, typically to powerful large investors. Foreign ownership of securities and assets is often unappealing. Extremely low income levels keep share ownership beyond the reach of most people in developing countries. Countries without a stock exchange include Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Mongolian Stock Exchange was the world's smallest stock exchange by market capitalisation.

It operates under the oversight of the Iraq Securities Commission, an independent commission modeled after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, it was called the Baghdad Stock Exchange and was operated by the Iraqi Ministry of Finance. Now it is a self-regulated organization like the New York Stock Exchange, owned by the 50 or so member brokerage firms. The trading floor is now open six hours a week.

But it was not sufficiently organised to affiliate to the Leinster branch of the I.R.F.U. However, it is well known that rugby was played in the area, because it was popular at two local boarding schools, one in Portarlington and one in Rahan. The fact that a Birr club affiliated to the Leinster branch in 1887 does not seem to have galvanised Tullamore into action and it was only in 1927 that a Tullamore club was formed and ten years later before a Tullamore Club would affiliate to the I.R.F.U. On Sunday 16 January 1927 a scrap team was sent to Edenderry only to be beaten. Tullamore R.F.C. was formed at a meeting on Saturday 5 February 1927. Mr. Danny Williams was elected president. The club appears to have held \\"Practices\\" each Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday at grounds on Arden Road. The first annual Dinner Dance was held at the end of the 1927-1928 season. Although the club was attracting a good following, this was its last season. For whatever reason, lack of talent or failure to practice ( not much changes) the club could not muster enthusiasm. With a club in Kilbeggan proving more successful the Tullamore players joined up with their friends in Kilbeggan. Tullamore were without a club until 1937 when new blood saw to it that the lacuna was filled. Founding a Club The present club was founded after a match at Derrinturn between Carberry and Tullamore. It was decided to hold a general meeting, which was held in Colton's hotel on Monday 19 April 1937. The honour of being the first president of the new club was bestowed on Dr. J. M. Prior Kennedy. Tullamore opened their first season in October with a game away to Birr at half-time Tullamore were leading 6-0 but in the end had to give way and were beaten 8-6. Of the 20 games played that season Tullamore won 6, Lost 11 and drew 3. Town's Cup Success From the 1937-38 season to 1946 Tullamore were five times in the Semi-final of the Provincial Towns Cup and victory coming eventually in 1946. Skerries provided the opposition in the final and wing forwards Dermot Kilroy and Oliver McGlinchey \\" kept the Skerries opposition under control.\\" You can see how times have changed as Tullamore stopped off in Kilcock for a bottle of stout on their way to the game. Town's Cup for a Second Time Fourteen years passed before Tullamore repeated its 1946 performance and won the cup again. On 10 April 1960 Tullamore defeated Wexford 17-8 in Kilkenny in the final. At the victory Dinner, held in Spollanstown a perpetual trophy was presented by Dermot Kilroy and Oliver McGlinchey that was to be known as the Midland Shield for use in the Midland League Competition. New Home for TRFC The 1960s was memorable for what happened off the pitch and not on it. After several years of negotiations, offers acceptances and fresh proposals the Tullamore rugby club took over Spollanstown. A final settlement was reached with the Tullamore soccer club in 1970. Youths During the early 70s the club started to take positive steps to promote Juvenile rugby. In October 1974, Oliver McGlinchey with the help of big John Cahill and Denis Magner, two teachers in the town decided that Tullamore RFC needed to produce its own replacement stock for the adult teams. They set about training and coaching the youths of the area, and to date this has been a huge success and the fruits of their labour, as well as other dedicated members, can be admired in the trophy cabinet. The club now fields U8, U10, U12, U14, U16 and U18 teams and the club are indeed proud to have fielded a number of international players namely, Ronan Kelly, Peter Bracken, Ivan Dunne, Colin Finnerty and Ray Farrell. These players also represented Leinster, as did Paul Marsden, Alan Kerin and Kevin Wynne. The club can boast of winning trophies at all levels. In the past few seasons the club have commenced coaching in the local schools (both at Primary and Second Level) and this is proving a great success. Today, Tullamore underage as well as senior teams are respected and indeed envied in Leinster rugby. Club members have given their time unselfishly to coaching and thus given Tullamore the status it now enjoys at underage level. Town's Cup for the third time The Provincial Towns Cup was won again in 1976 and they qualified for the play-off in the Senior Cup. The main man in the cup final win over Drogheda was Matt Geraghty the team manager of the 1st team for the 1998-99 season. Tullamore won 9-3. In September 78 the club visited the U.S. Taking in Boston, New York, Buffalo and other centres. The years up to 1986 do not differ remarkably to the previous years. There were cup victories each year, but none for the 1st XV since the cup of 1976. The success of juvenile teams leads one to the inescapable conclusion that the Provincial Towns Cup must surely return to Tullamore in the near future. The current Leinster League has the focus of many players with the club consistently playing in Division 1 against some of the best players in the country. There is always room for quality players from home and abroad and the club is always aiming to have their teams playing at the highest possible level.

Fisher's book was based on her one-woman stage show, which she developed with writer/director Joshua Ravetch. The show debuted at The Geffen Playhouse. Fisher performed with Ravetch co-creating and directing. It enjoyed a successful Broadway run and then toured in other cities. In 2010, HBO filmed a feature-length documentary of the stage play. Book reception Wishful Drinking received generally positive reviews from critics. The January 2009 New York Times review described it as a \\"funny, sardonic little memoir\\", but \\"pretty slight, padded out with big type, extra space between the lines and some family photographs, and it displays at times an almost antic need to entertain. The paragraphs are short, and the jokes ‚Äì the puns, the wisecracks, the deadpan one-liners ‚Äì come rattling along at the rate of one every other sentence or so.\\" Salon reviewer Rebecca Traister found the book quite funny in large part, but was disappointed that \\"instead of pushing aside the twinkling craziness of her outside life to meaningfully reveal the crazy on the inside, as she has always done so well, Fisher is now gathering all the starry stuff around her for comfort and reassurance about who she is and what she means.\\" The author, who died on December 27, 2016, had written the following comment in the book, and it was widely published by the news media after her death: Stage adaptation Carrie Fisher's play on Broadway at Studio 54 The book followed Fisher's one-woman play in which Fisher had been performing. Developed originally at The Geffen Playhouse with Josh Ravetch co-creating and directing the world premiere, it moved to Berkeley Repertory Theatre near San Francisco at the beginning of 2008, the production opened in a limited run on Broadway at Studio 54 on September 22, 2009 (previews) and October 4, 2009, and closed on January 17, 2010. After its successful San Francisco Bay Area run and before moving to Broadway, Wishful Drinking played at, among other venues, the Arena Stage in Washington, D.C. in September 2008, and Seattle Repertory Theatre April ‚Äì May 2009. Production rights dispute While the show met with critical and popular success on Broadway in New York, Fisher was soon embroiled in a battle with producer Jonathan Reinis over its production rights. Each claimed lost revenue at the hands of the other. Film documentary HBO cable television released a filmed documentary of the stage show, directed by Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato, and first broadcast in December 2010. The 76-minute film was released on DVD on September 13, 2011. The film production and DVD received a mixture of reviews. In the Los Angeles Times, Robert Lloyd described the performance captured: \\"Fisher can be broad, but that is also the person she plays everywhere now: a little larger than life, worn but not worn out. She's funny as an actress, and as a writer makes memorable phrases\\". Boston Globe reviewer Matthew Gilbert wrote, \\"Fisher‚Äôs obsession with her parents and stepparents can be a little tiresome, to be honest, even while her tales of Hollywood absurdity remain outrageous ... Fisher even starts to seem boastful about her dysfunction ...\\" Continuing, \\"Fortunately Fisher does have some self-awareness about the potential for her show to seem like a narcissistic screed. That helps.\\" DVDTalk reviewer Jason Bailey wrote of the released DVD, \\"To put across the brilliance of Wishful Drinking, all Bailey and Barbato really needed to do was put Fisher on stage, and turn on the cameras. They do that skillfully and unobtrusively\\". The DVD's content received 4/5 stars, video quality 3/5, audio quality 3.5/5, extras 2.5/5, replay 4/5, with final advice of \\"Highly Recommended\\".

In addition to his million dollar prize, Crowley also won $100,000 from the \\"player of the season\\" poll. At 57, he is the oldest winner in the history of US Survivor to date.  Personal life  At the time of Survivor's airing, Crowley taught Science at Gorham High School in Gorham, Maine. Crowley was the teacher of Survivor: Vanuatu contestant Julie Berry. He retired from teaching in 2009. In 2009, Crowley published his autobiography, Making Waves: The Stories of Maine's Bob Crowley. The producers of Survivor, however, forbade Crowley from mentioning the show in his book. Survivor On Survivor: Gabon, Crowley was originally placed into the Kota Tribe. Crowley had originally been in an alliance with fellow tribemates Jacquie Berg, Marcus Lehman, Charlie Herschel, and Corinne Kaplan. This alliance is known to many Survivor fans as the \\"Onion Alliance.\\" The Kota Tribe proved to be strong by winning the first three challenges. In Episode 3, Kota lost the immunity challenge and were forced to face Tribal Council, where Paloma Solo-Castillo was voted out. In the following episode, there was a tribal swap which ended up taking fellow alliance member Berg to the opposing Fang tribe. When Berg was voted off, Randy Bailey was welcomed into their newly made alliance. The Kota tribe would still stand strong, and the tribe won the next two immunity challenges. In Episode 7, both tribes faced a twist where each tribe would have to enter Tribal Council. The \\"Onion Alliance\\" voted out Dan Kay over the weaker Susie Smith in fear that Kay had the Hidden Immunity Idol. This ended up being the vital mistake to Crowley's alliance as Smith would end up switching sides. In Episode Eight, both tribes assumed that a merge would be coming up but instead they were welcomed with another tribal swap. Crowley and Lehman remained on Kota while Herschel, Bailey, and Kaplan moved to Fang. When Fang won the immunity challenge, Crowley and Lehman went to face Tribal Council where tribemates Smith, Ken Hoang, and Crystal Cox voted out Lehman. After Lehman was voted out, both tribes merged into the new Nobag Tribe (\\"Nobag\\" is Gabon spelled backwards). Herschel ended up getting voted out at the next Tribal Council and it soon appeared that Crowley's alliance would crumble. In the following episode, Crowley was targeted next, but when he got sent to Exile Island, he created a fake Hidden Immunity Idol. He used the fake idol to secure his spot in the game and Bailey, his own alliance member, was blindsided. After Bailey's elimination, Crowley created another Hidden Immunity Idol in an attempt to save himself and Kaplan, his last alliance member. Although it was futile and Kaplan was eliminated, it caused Hoang to betray his own alliance and vote against Matty Whitmore. Crowley's winning streak continued by winning his fifth challenge in a row. This was something his other tribemates did not expect. In Episode 12, Hoang tried to propose a deal with Crowley and said that if he had won immunity he would give it up to Hoang since he had tricked him at the last Tribal Council. However Jessica \\"Sugar\\" Kiper had informed Crowley that it was just a trick to blindside him and Crowley went against the idea. In the following Tribal Councils, Cox and Hoang were both voted out. In the final immunity challenge, Crowley lost to Smith in a card building challenge. Crowley seemed doomed again but he was able to convince Kiper to go on his side and vote against Whitmore. Knowing that a tie breaker challenge might occur, Crowley also started practising how to build a fire. At Tribal Council, a tie did occur, and as Crowley had expected, a challenge would take place. Whitmore and Crowley were forced to compete in a fire building challenge and once again, Crowley won. At the Final Tribal Council, Crowley was confronted by Hoang for not giving up his immunity. Crowley was also confronted by Bailey for using the fake Hidden Immunity Idol against him. In the end, the jury voted Crowley as the Sole Survivor in a vote of 4-3-0. Crowley earned the votes of Lehman, Herschel, Bailey, and Kaplan. In addition, Crowley also won the 'Sprint Player of the Season' award, earning the fan's vote over Kiper and Whitmore.

It is one of four species in the genus Ariopsis. The common name, hardhead catfish, is derived from the presence of a hard, bony plate extending rearward toward the dorsal fin from a line between the catfish's eyes.Webster, Pearse. Hardhead Catfish. South Carolina Department of Natural Resources. http://www.dnr.sc.gov/cwcs/pdf/Hardheadcatfish.pdf It is an elongated marine catfish that reaches up to in length and in weight. Their typical weight is less than , but they commonly reach up to . They are often a dirty gray color on top, with white undersides. Habits, distribution, and characteristics Two hardhead catfish Hardhead catfish are found mostly in the near-shore waters of the Western Atlantic Ocean, around the southeast coast of the United States, around the Florida Keys and the coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Hardhead catfish are also found in brackish estuaries and river mouths where the bottom is sandy or muddy, but only occasionally enter freshwater. It tends to move from shallower to deeper waters in the winter months. The species is generally common to abundant within its range. The hardhead catfish has four barbels under the chin, with two more at the corners of the mouth. These barbels help the catfish find crabs, fish, and shrimp in the muddy bays where they live. The dorsal and pectoral fins each are supported by a sharp, slime-covered, barbed spine. The dorsal spine is normally erect when the fish is excited and a tennis shoe or even a leather- soled shoe offers little protection. The gafftopsail catfish looks similar to the hardhead catfish, but its dorsal and pectoral spines have a distinctive fleshy extension (like the fore-and-aft topsail of a ship). Feeding behavior A. felis consumes a wide range of food. It is an opportunistic consumer that uses mud and sand flats as hunting grounds. It is also mainly a secondary consumer, ingesting primarily detritus, meio-, and macrobenthic fauna, and fish. Its diet primarily consists of algae, seagrasses, cnidarians, sea cucumbers, gastropods, polychaetes, shrimp, and crabs. It can occasionally be a tertiary consumer. Its diet depends on its size and location. Younger hardhead catfish tend to eat small crustaceans, like amphipods, shrimp, blue crabs, mollusks, and annelids. Juveniles that are still under the protection of the male mouthbrooder feed predominately on planktonic crustaceans close by to the mouth of the parent. The adults primarily consume larger fish. Locomotion Significant evidence suggests correlation between the fish's activity patterns and seasonal changes. Under controlled conditions of photoperiod, temperature, and water quality, hardhead catfish display nonrandom oscillations in angular orientation of locomotive activity. There appears to be annual, bimodal cycles for all three of these variables. The cycles match with the seasonal inshore-offshore migrations of hardhead catfish. Photoperiod appears to be the exogenous cue that triggers the cyclic changes in behavior. The presence of this seasonal behavior indicates that a circadian neural mechanism may exist in hardhead catfish. Communication =Chemical= Hardhead catfish respond to chemicals released by injured individuals with increased activity, illustrating communication among catfish. Their activity level was highest right after the onset of the chemical stimulus. They also respond to chemical cues from injured sailfin mollies, but this response was weaker than that of the response from their own species. After examining the epidermis of the hardhead catfish, the alarm substance cells apparently were similar to those of freshwater catfish. These chemical responses had only been seen in freshwater ostariophysans. Hardhead catfish are the first marine ostariophysans found to elicit this type of alarm reaction. =Echolocation= Furthermore, hardhead catfish are the first indicator that Osteichthyes possibly could use directional hearing to detect obstacles. Emissions of low-frequency sounds were related to the detection and avoidance of close obstacles. Individuals within the group that produced sound avoided obstacles, whereas silent individuals crashed into obstacles frequently. Many fish have been associated with sound production for alarm, territorial, and courtship purposes, but sound probing of surroundings seems to be only be seen in hardhead catfish. So far, no evidence exists for far- field echolocation, such as seen in bats or toothed whales. The signal parameters have low frequency and amplitude, so far-field reverberations are unlikely to be useful. If echolocation exists, it is likely only useful in the near field by the catfish. =Sound production= Some evidence indicates sound production in hardhead catfish is differentiated both mechanistically and contextually. Mechanistically, sound can be produced in different ways. Thin bones by the swim bladder can be vibrated by specialized sonic muscles. Also, grinding of the pharyngeal teeth and rubbing of the pectoral spines against the pectoral girdle can produce sound. These two mechanisms appear to be evolved fright responses by the hardhead catfish. Some argue that hardhead catfish use an unrefined form of sonar as a means of echolocation, which also implies some directional hearing ability. It is possible, but is so far unproven, that sound is used in courtship and spawning. Lifecycle and reproduction The hardhead catfish has a reproductive season from around May to September. Males and females reach sexual maturity before age 2. Females at maturity are around , and males typically are slightly larger, around . At maturity, females develop flap-like fatty tissue by their pelvic fins, which results in them having larger pelvic fins than males. These enhanced pelvic fins may be the site of fertilization and play a part in moving the fertilized eggs to the male mouthbrooder for incubation. Another possibility is that males pick up eggs from depressions in the sand, as eggs tend to be demersal. They also die after 4 years. Parental care =Mouthbrooding= Like other members of the Ariidae, hardhead catfish are paternal mouthbrooders. After spawning, the male carries the eggs in his mouth until they hatch. Several nonfunctioning eggs within the brood attach to the larger, viable eggs. These nonfunctioning eggs may be used as food for the male mouthbrooder, since mouthbrooders do not feed while they are taking care of the brood. Oral incubations continue through the yolk-sac larval state, for a total length around 8‚Äì11 weeks. Under laboratory conditions, offspring can hatch in roughly 30 days. The offspring are roughly 6‚Äì8 cm long and slowly adapt to adult behavior, such as opportunistic bottom-feeding and scavenging. At absorption of the yolk sac, juveniles begin to show adult characteristics. The parental male can choose to carry the young after they have hatched until they are larger and capable of surviving on their own. =Advantages= Many advantages to mouthbrooding exist as opposed to other forms of parental care, such as bubble nesting. Mouthbrooders are able to freely move with the eggs in their mouths, thus can move as necessary to protect both themselves and the broods. Though mouthbrooding requires more energy by the male, the chance of his young surviving to adulthood is greater, thus reproducing and continuing his genes; the eggs are not defenseless while in their father's mouth. Mouthbrooding by males counters the relatively low fecundity of females, which only have 20-65 eggs per spawning episode. Finally, through breathing, the male is able to keep the brood well oxygenated, which also increases brood survival. Fishing Hardhead catfish are voracious feeders and will bite on almost any natural bait. Hardhead catfish are also known to steal bait. Shrimp is a particularly effective bait to use. When fishing for this species in fresh water, assorted meats tend to work best as bait. For example: bacon, chicken, cuts of steak, and smaller fish. Hardhead catfish are generally regarded as an undesirable catch by most anglers, largely due to the risk associated with handling the venomous fish, as well as its 'fishy' taste as opposed to desirable game fish. Hardhead catfish are edible, but like all catfish, require some effort to clean. It is one of the 30 most recreationally harvested species in the five-county area (Volusia, Brevard, Indian River, St. Lucie, Martin) encompassing the Indian River Lagoon in central Florida. From 1997-2001, 361,022 hardhead catfish were harvested within 200 miles of the shore in the IRL region. Hardheads are also harvested for industrial purposes in commercial bottom-trawling operations. Annual harvests vary greatly, but from 1987‚Äì2001, 1.04 million pounds of marine catfishes (including both the hardhead catfish and the gafftopsail catfish) were harvested in the IRL region. The harvest was valued at $777,497. Weight and length thumb Hardhead catfish weigh around and measure long. As hardhead catfish grow longer, they increase in weight. The relationship between length and weight is not linear. The relationship between total length (L, in inches) and total weight (W, in pounds) for nearly all species of fish can be expressed by an equation of the form: :W = cL^b\\\\\\\\!\\\\, Invariably, b is close to 3.0 for all species, and c is a constant that varies among species. The relationship described in this section suggests that a hardhead catfish will weigh about , while a hardhead catfish will likely weigh at least .

Later, he was enslaved by Countess du Barry and became her servant until informing on her to the Committee of Public Safety. He participated in the French Revolution and was imprisoned by the Girondins.  Early life and upbringing  Zamor was born in 1762' at the town of Chittagong in the state of Bengal (now Bangladesh). In 1773, when he was eleven years old, he was captured by British slave traders, who trafficked him into France via Madagascar and sold him to Louis XV of France. The king gave the young boy to his mistress Countess du Barry, and he was christened Louis- Benoit. The countess developed a liking for the boy and educated him. Zamor developed a taste for literature and was inspired by the works of Rousseau. Until her death, the countess was under the incorrect impression that Zamor was African (although Zamor may have belonged to the Siddi ethnic group, which descend from the Bantu peoples of East Africa). Records of the period suggest that Zamor was extremely mischievous as a child. She noted in her memoirs:  Role in the French Revolution  When the French Revolution broke out, Zamor took the side of the revolutionaries and joined the Jacobins. He began to detest Countess du Barry and deplored her lavish lifestyle. He also protested her repeated visits to England with the intention of retrieving her lost jewelry and warned her against protecting aristocrats. As an informant to the Committee of Public Safety, Zamor got the police to arrest the countess in 1792 on her return from one of her many visits to England. The countess, however, secured her release from jail and found out that the arrest was the handiwork of her page. She promptly dismissed Zamor from her service. Infuriated, Zamor became more vocal and open in his support for the revolution. He brought further charges against the countess, which eventually led to her arrest, trial and execution by guillotine. At the trial, Zamor gave Chittagong as his birthplace.  Imprisonment  Soon after the execution of the countess, Zamor was arrested by the Girondins on suspicion of being an accomplice of the countess and a Jacobin. He was tried and imprisoned, but was able to secure his release. He then fled from France, reappearing only in 1815 after the fall of Napoleon. Zamor bought a house in Rue Ma√Ætre-Albert, near the Latin Quarter of Paris, and spent a few years as a schoolteacher.  Death  Zamor died in poverty on 7 February 1820 and was buried in Paris. His funeral reportedly had a very small attendance. In popular culture A two- page comic strip La Rue perdue (The Lost Street) was published in 1978, featuring Gil Jourdan, a detective created by Maurice Tillieux. Set in 1953, it has Jourdan trying to find out why a fake guillotine blade is hanging outside the door of a black, African friend. The person responsible turns out to be a man obsessed with Madame du Barry and is taking his anger at her death out on Jourdan's friend, who looks like Zamor. The action is set in Rue Ma√Ætre Albert, where Zamor lived before his death. In Marie Antoinette, a 2006 film, Madame du Barry (portrayed by Asia Argento) was shown in company of a nameless black servant boy, who most likely is Zamor.

It is managed by a board made up of three elected councillors from each of these four boroughs. Citing it as \\"a rare example\\" of Art Deco design in the borough, Richmond upon Thames Council has described it as \\"a building of exceptional quality and character\\". Environmentalist Colin Hines describes it as \\"probably the most undiscovered deco treasure in London\\". Hilary Grainger, writing in Encyclopedia of Cremation, describes the architectural style as Italianate and the building as having \\"beautiful cloisters with discrete brick detailing\\". It has been a Grade II listed building since 2011, being assessed by Historic England as having \\"a distinctive Art Deco design that survives little altered in a compact and practical composition\\". Location The crematorium is on Kew Meadow Path, Townsmead Road, Kew. It is situated on the south bank of the River Thames by Chiswick Bridge and in Clifford Avenue, adjoining Mortlake Cemetery (Hammersmith New Cemetery) in the angle of Mortlake Road (which forms part of the A205, the South Circular Road) and the A316 road. The nearest train stations are Kew Gardens (for London Underground and London Overground trains) and Mortlake (for South Western Railway services). History Mortlake Crematorium was built on the site of Pink's Farm, which had belonged to Richard Atwood, whose family were prominent market gardeners in the area. It was licensed in 1936 under the Mortlake Crematorium Act 1936, thereby becoming the first to be established under its own Act of Parliament. Designed by Douglas Barton, borough surveyor to Hammersmith Metropolitan Borough Council, the building was constructed in three years at a cost of ¬£27,000. It was also equipped with a Garden of Remembrance for the burial or scattering of ashes, and also offered panels and niches in which ashes could be deposited. When the facility was finally opened in January 1939 by Lord Horder, the then Physician to the King, he said: \\"You seem to have eliminated the sombreness of atmosphere which sometimes shrouds buildings such as these\\". After that, there was very little change in Mortlake Crematorium's outward appearance until 1982, when Colin Gilbert, an architect from Ealing, designed additional gardens between the crematorium and the River Thames. Since 2015 the crematorium has had a memorial garden dedicated to the memory of babies and children, based on Doris Stickley's story \\"Water Bugs and Dragonflies\\".

The protests were sparked by the monarchy's plans to renew the 1930 Anglo-Iraqi Treaty that effectively made Iraq a British protectorate. Nuri al-Said, the Prime Minister of Iraq, was planning on renewing, albeit in a revised form, this 1930 treaty that tied Iraq to British interests, allowed for the unrestricted movement of British troops on Iraqi soil, and provided significant protection to the British-installed Iraqi monarchy.  History  In 1947, the Iraqi monarchy entered into secret negotiations with the British government. The various political parties in Iraq were not informed of the negotiations and instead, heard about them on the radio or read about them in the newspapers the following day.Batatu 547 Although the news on the treaty sparked the al-Wathbah protests, it soon became clear that there were elements of unrest that went beyond the opposition to the treaty.

Students from the School of Law left their classrooms to join the protest (548). The police used clubs and fired shots to disperse the protest. Many students were wounded and thirty-nine were arrested (six of whom were members of the Iraqi Communist Party or the related party The National Liberation Party), and the School of Law was closed down.Batatu, 548 On January 6, students from all colleges went on strike. On January 8, the authorities released the arrested students. The strike ceased. On January 16, it was announced that the Iraqi government had signed a treaty in Portsmouth, effectively renewing its alliance with Britain. At the announcement of the treaty a three-day strike of college students began during which they protested in the streets. On January 16, there were large-scale student protests. Although the protests were somewhat spontaneous in nature, they coalesced through the organizing of several political organizations: The communist ‚ÄúStudent Cooperation Committee,‚Äù the Progressive Democrats, the Populists, the Kurdish Democrats, and the student wings of the National Democratic Party and the Independence Party.Batatu, 551 On January 20 there was a large-scale student march. For the first time since the beginning of the unrest, other social groups joined the students: The Schalchiyyah workers and the poor shantytown dwelling migrants from South-Eastern Iraq known as the ShargƒÅwiyyƒ´n. The police responded by firing directly at the demonstrators. The demonstrators, however, did not disperse. On January 21, the demonstrations escalated. The police fired on students who were transporting those who had been killed the day before. Members of the faculty at the School of pharmacy and medicine resigned from their posts. Protests spread in the streets including non-students and many Communists. ‚ÄúAn atmosphere redolent of social revolution enveloped Baghdad.Batatu, 551‚Äù That night, the king of Iraq annulled the treaty. The king's disavowal of the treaty split the opposition in two camps: those, like the Independence Party and the National Democrats called on a cease of protests. The Communists called on protesters to continue, seeing that they were close to overthrowing the government. On January 23, new demonstrations convened, combining students, members of the Independence Party, workers, and Scuffles broke out between members of the Independence party and Communists. On January 26, Jabr and N≈´ri returned to Baghdad from London. In a radio address that very night, Jabr asked that the people remain calm and stated that details of the treaty would soon be provided. Immediately, a great number of people went out on the streets. Many reported hearing machine-gun fire in the night.Batatu, 554 On January 27, the Central Committee of the Communist Party released and distributed a manifesto that called for continued protests. It claimed that imperialists had infiltrated the demonstrations and acted in such a way as to justify the government's violent intervention. The manifesto called on the protesters to continue their struggle until the government was toppled and a democratic government established in its wake. Students and workers, coming from the popular areas of Baghdad, gathered to protest. A large group attempted to cross the bridge into West Baghdad where they would meet with students and the Schalchiyyah rail workers. In Al-Rasafa, the police opened fire on a group of Communists, killing four. Despite their losses, they kept marching forward and arriving in Amƒ´n square, they were stopped by new police reinforcement. On the other side of the river, new clashes broke out between protesters. They moved onto the Ma‚Äôm≈´n Bridge and the police fired directly onto the crowd with machine-guns, killing scores. Many fell into the river. Meanwhile, demonstrations in Amƒ´n square escalated and again, police fired directly onto the crowds. While the demonstrators regrouped in various locations, the police withdrew. It is estimated that 300 ‚Äì 400 demonstrators were killed.  Aftermath  On the evening of January 26, Salih Jabr fled to England. The king entrusted a Shi‚Äôƒ´ religious scholar who had been involved in the 1920 uprisings with forming a new government. The Iraqi government blamed foreign agitators for the January uprisings. They pointed to the Saudi support for the Independence Party and the Soviet links to the Communist party. They claimed that the Communist party received major donations from Jewish communists. However, records indicate that the Communist party spent very little money in January 1948, which supports the idea that the demonstrations were spontaneous and enjoyed widespread popular support. The al-Wathbah uprising strengthened the Communist party. However, the new recruits were not trained and Fahd and 125 other senior communists were in the prison of Kut.Batatu, 559 The Communist Party more or less merged ideologically with the National Liberation Party and literally with the National Revolutionary Committee. After the al- Wathbah the Communist party's ideology was radicalized. One of the major issues that came to the fore was whether the party should cooperate strategically with the national bourgeoisie against the monarchy. However, in the spring of 1948 a number of protests and strikes took place. * Railway strikes on March 18, April 14 and May 12. * Strikes at the Port: April 4, April 6, May 2 and May 18 * The K3 oil pump was immobilized by workers from April 23 to May 15 * In April, the Communist Party organized the first national student congress, at which the General Union of Iraqi Students was founded. * In April, peasants led an uprising in the village of Arbat. ‚ÄúThe workers demanded wage increases, ‚Äòbread and shoes,‚Äô democratic rights, the release of political prisoners, and national independence\\"Salucci, 28 In May, the demonstrations were ended by the government's declaration of martial law, following the outbreak of war in Palestine. Although many different factions came together for the protests, and the Liberal and National Democrats cooperated with the Communist party, there was no further collaboration on their respective opposition to the monarchy. By the end of 1948, the Communist party was in shambles, many of its leaders in prison. It was ideologically discredited after it had followed the Soviet line of accepting the partition of Palestine and the establishment of Israel in the summer. However, another effect of the al-Wathbah was that \\"the opposition parties responsible for organizing the demonstrations were discovering new, immediate forms of power, denied to them both by their small numbers and by the rigging of the parliamentary system.Tripp, 118 The al-Wathbah uprising helped pave the way for the 1952 Intifada, the overthrow of the monarchy in the 14 July Revolution, and the creation of a republic.

The Chartreuse de Champmol, formally the Chartreuse de la Sainte-Trinit√© de Champmol, was a Carthusian monastery on the outskirts of Dijon, which is now in France, but in the 15th century was the capital of the Duchy of Burgundy. The monastery was founded in 1383 by Duke Philip the Bold to provide a dynastic burial place for the Valois Dukes of Burgundy,Vaughan, 202 and operated until it was dissolved in 1791, during the French Revolution. Called \\"the grandest project in a reign renowned for extravagance\\",Sherry C. M. Lindquist, \\"Accounting for the Status of Artists at the Chartreuse de Champmol\\" Gesta 41.1, \\"Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages\\" (2002:15-28 p. 15) it was lavishly enriched with works of art, and the dispersed remnants of its collection remain key to the understanding of the art of the period.Some works formerly at Champmol and documentation, were assembled for the exhibition \\"Chartreuse de Champmol\\", Dijon, 1960, with a catalogue containing essays by scholars of the calibre of Millard Meiss and Colin Eisler. Founding Purchase of the land and quarrying of materials began in 1377, but construction did not begin until 1383,Vaughan, 202. The complex and unwieldy bureaucratic structure, providing \\"a rare view into artistic production at a major centre\\" (p 15), was analyzed from copious surviving accounts by Sherry C. M. Lindquist, \\"Accounting for the Status of Artists at the Chartreuse de Champmol\\" Gesta 41.1, \\"Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages\\" (2002), pp. 15-28. under the architect Druet de Dammartin from Paris, who had previously designed the Duke's chateau at Sluis, and been an assistant in work at the Louvre. According to James Snyder his work at Champmol was \\"a somewhat conservative modification of the Late Gothic buildings of Paris\\".Snyder, 65 A committee of councillors from Dijon supervised the construction for the Duke, who was often elsewhere. By 1388 the church was consecrated, and most construction probably completed. The monastery was built for twenty-four choir monks, instead of the usual twelve in a Carthusian house, and two more were endowed to celebrate the birth in 1433 of Charles the Bold.Dossier, p. 10 These lived semi-hermitic lives in their individual small houses when not in the chapel. There would also have been non-ordained monks, servants, novices, and other workers. When founded, Champmol was \\"two arrow shots\\" outside the city gates,Quoted by Lindquist (2002), p. 177 but is now inside the modern city boundaries. At this time the city had about 10,000 inhabitants and was the largest in Burgundy proper, though smaller than the cities of the territories in the Netherlands recently inherited by the Duke through his wife. But Burgundy was held more securely than the often turbulent cities in the north, and represented the senior title of the dynasty.Gelfand (2005), 571 Over sixty members of the Capetian House of Burgundy, whom the Valois had succeeded in 1361, only two decades earlier, had been buried at C√Æteaux Abbey to the south of Dijon. Champmol was intended to rival C√Æteaux, Saint-Denis, where the Kings of France were buried, and other dynastic burial places. Somewhat in contradiction to the Carthusian mission of tranquil contemplation, visitors and pilgrims were encouraged, the expenses of hospitality recompensed by the Dukes. In 1418 Papal indulgences were granted to those visiting the Well of Moses, further encouraging pilgrims. The ducal family had a private oratory overlooking the church (now destroyed), though their visits were in fact rare.Lindquist, 2002 The ducal accounts, which have fortunately survived, show major commissions for paintings and other works to complete the monastery continuing until about 1415, and further works were added after that at a slower rate by the Dukes and other donors. The accounts for Champmol have survived in sufficient detail that Martin WarnkeWarnke, The Court Artist: On the Ancestry of the Modern Artist (Cambridge University Press), 1993. synthesized from them a view of the emerging status of court artists, and \\"the autonomous consciousness of art and artists\\"Warnke 1993:xiii. that would distinguish the world of art in the Early modern period. Tombs of the Dukes The Valois dynasty of Burgundy had less than a century to run when the monastery was founded, and the number of tombs never approached that of their Capetian predecessors at C√Æteaux ‚Äì indeed there would hardly have been room in the choir of the church, where the monuments were.Dossier, p. 13 has an 18th-century print of them in their original setting Only two monuments were ever erected,Dossier, 17 both in the same style with painted alabaster effigies with lions at their feet and angels with spread wings at their heads. Underneath the slab the effigies rested on, unpainted small (about 40 cm high) \\"pleurants\\" or mourners (\\"weepers\\" is the traditional English term) were set among Gothic tracery. These were described by Johan Huizinga in The Waning of the Middle Ages as \\"the most profound expression of mourning known in art, a funeral march in stone\\".Page 235 in this online edition. Snyder 67-69 has a full description. The tombs of the Dukes, now moved to the \\"Salle de Garde\\" of their palace in Dijon. Philip the Bold died in 1404, and his wife Margaret III, Countess of Flanders the following year. She had decided to rest her remains with those of her parents in Lille, and Philip had been planning a single monument for himself for over twenty years, having commissioned Jean de Marville in 1381. Work did not begin until 1384, and proceeded slowly, with Claus Sluter being put in charge in 1389. At the Duke's death in 1404, only two mourners and the framework were complete; John the Fearless gave Sluter four years to finish the job, but he died after two. His nephew and assistant, Claus de Werve took over and finished the sculptures in 1410. The effigies were painted by Malouel.Dossier, p. 13-14 John expressed a wish for his own tomb, this time a double one with his Duchess Margaret of Bavaria, to resemble that of his father, but nothing was done, even after his death in 1419, until 1435, and in 1439 de Werve died without having managed to find suitable alabaster. In 1443 a Spaniard, Jean de La Huerta, was contracted, and sent drawings for the effigies. He completed most elements, but not the effigies, before leaving Dijon in 1456. Yet another master was brought in, and the monument finally installed in 1470, by which time Philip the Good was himself dead. He seems to have made no provision for a monument for himself, and had initially been buried in Bruges, where he died. His son Charles the Bold had the remains brought back to Champmol after some years, but no monument was ever planned. Charles himself was relocated from Nancy to Bruges by his great-grandson Charles V in 1558.Dossier, p. 15-16 The second tomb repeats the design of the first, but with their execution spanning almost a century, stylistic differences can be seen, although some of the \\"pleurants\\" of the second tomb copy those of the first exactly.Dossier, p. 17 It is recorded that Philip the Good had a portrait of himself placed in the choir, where there were already those of the previous two Dukes. None of these are believed to have survived in the original, but surviving portraits may be copies of them. After the Revolution, and the sale of the monastery, the tombs were carefully moved to Dijon Cathedral in 1792, as their historic importance was recognised. But in the following year the cathedral was converted into a Temple of Reason and the effigies were vandalised, so that what are now seen are reconstructions. Many elements, including ten \\"pleurants\\", were removed by genteel looters. =Gallery of the tombs= File:Philippe le Hardi.jpgTomb of Philip the Bold, with the \\"Retable of the crucifixion\\" behind File:Dijon- Palais-Gisant-Detail.jpg\\"Pleurants\\" or mourners File:Dijon Mus√©e Tombeau Jean3.jpgTwo of the \\"pleurants\\" from the later tomb File:Dijon - Tombeau des ducs de Bourgogne 1.jpgJohn the Fearless and Margaret of Bavaria Works of art from Champmol Melchior Broederlam, Annunciation and Visitation (1393‚Äì1399), left panel of a pair; (Dijon, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts) The Last Communion and Martyrdom of Saint Denis, by Henri Bellechose, 1416. Louvre Champmol was designed as a showpiece, and the artistic contents, now dispersed, represent much of the finest monumental work, as opposed to illuminated manuscripts, of French and Burgundian art of the period. Without the works that remained at Champmol until the 18th century, Claus Sluter, Jacques de Baerze, Melchior Broederlam, Henri Bellechose, Jean Malouel, and Jean de Beaumetz would remain only names known from documentary records. =Still at Champmol= There are very important sculptures by Claus Sluter and his workshop on the church portal, including kneeling figures of Philip and his Duchess.Snyder, 65-66 has a full description The lower parts of the Well of Moses (Puits de Moise) survive, including six life-size figures of the Old Testament prophets who foretold the Messiah, most of the rest having been destroyed, apparently more by weathering than the Revolution.Snyder, 67 =In Dijon museums= Most items are in the Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, including its site in the former palace of the Dukes. The fragments from the Well of Moses and other similar pieces are in the Archaeological Museum.

Broederlam also painted and gilded the carvings by de Baerze.Snyder, pp. 72-3 and 292-3 *The tombs (in fact always cenotaphs) of the Dukes of Burgundy; the museum has the tombs of Philip the Bold and his son John the Fearless with his wife Margaret of Bavaria.

After the death in 1477 of Charles the Bold, Burgundy proper was recovered by force by France; the Kings, still descended from the Dukes via the Habsburgs and other routes, continued to support and occasionally visit the monastery. There was slight damage in the siege of Dijon in 1513 and in the French Wars of Religion, but essentially the monastery remained in its 15th-century state until it was decided to update it in the 1770s. The altarpieces of Saints Denis and George had been replaced by new paintings by Charles-Andr√© van Loo in 1741; both the new paintings are now in the Dijon museum.Dossier, pp. 19-20 and 22, with pictures. Remodelling in the 1770s involved the destruction of some medieval parts, but greater destruction followed the French Revolution. The monastery was suppressed in 1791, and on May 4, five days after the monks departed, the buildings and land were bought by Emmanuel Cr√©tet (1747‚Äì1808), later to be Minister of the Interior under Napoleon with the title Comte de Champmol. He destroyed large parts of the buildings and the church.Dossier, p. 11 In 1833 the estate was bought by the local d√©partement as a mental asylum, and many new buildings erected.Dossier, p. 12 Today the buildings house a psychiatric hospital, and \\"aller √† la chartreuse\\" is a local phrase for developing a mental disorder. The Sluter sculptures can be seen by visitors, and many of the contents are in the Dijon museum, with the tombs and carved retables housed in the former Palace of the Dukes.

The program also emphasizes subjects that shed light on the operation of public authorities and the specific action of public legal careers, such as public legal institutions, and state and federal judiciary structure.  Internship opportunities  FGV Direito Rio has standing internship agreements with law firms in Rio de Janeiro, corporations, and public authorities -- the Court of Justice and the State Prosecution, among others. Students will also have internship opportunities with projects developed by the school, such as the Technology and Society Center, a center of study of legal relationships involving intellectual property and technology, and the Justice and Society Center, whose activities involve collaboration to modernize and appreciate the Judiciary and Public Defense professions.  FGV Law Online  FGV Law Online programs are 30-hour courses spread over two months. Their method is based on practical case studies supported by substantial references, including doctrine, law and case law. Every program is acknowledge by the Brazilian Bar/Rio de Janeiro and, for Rio de Janeiro students, are equivalent to 25 hours' internship.  Technology and Society Center  The Technology and Society Center (Centro de Tecnologia e Sociedade, CTS) develops studies and projects in the areas of intellectual property, free software, Internet governance, and privacy on the Internet, and provides research and consultancy services to public and private entities, as well as to the third sector. CTS has been accepted as a permanent observer of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO).  Justice and Society Center  The Justice and Society Center (Centro de Justi√ßa e Sociedade, CJUS) has activities that are intended to collaborate with the modernization and appreciation of the judiciary and of public legal professions, to foster research and development of public legal careers and to contribute to the School's graduate programs. In this sense, CJUS relies on support from several courts, from Brazilian Magistrates Association (AMB), the National Prosecutors Association (CONAMP), the National Public Defense Association (ANADEP) and private companies.

The annunciation to the shepherds is an episode in the Nativity of Jesus described in the Bible in Luke 2, in which angels tell a group of shepherds about the birth of Jesus. It is a common subject of Christian art and of Christmas carols. Biblical narrative Rembrandt The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, 1634 As described in verses 8‚Äì20 of the second chapter of the Gospel of Luke, shepherds were tending their flocks out in the countryside near Bethlehem, when they were terrified by the appearance of an angel. The angel explains that he has a message of good news for all people, namely that \\"Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.\\"Luke 2:11‚Äì12, NIV (BibleGateway). After this, a great many more angels appear, praising God with the words \\"Glory to God in the highest heaven, and on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\\"Luke 2:14, NIV (BibleGateway). Deciding to do as the angel had said, the shepherds travel to Bethlehem, and find Mary and Joseph and the infant Jesus lying in the manger, just as they had been told. The adoration of the shepherds follows. Translational issues Abraham Bloemaert (Manner of) - Announcement to the shepherds c.1600 The King James Version of the Bible translates the words of the angels differently from modern versions, using the words \\"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men\\".Luke 2:14, KJV (BibleGateway). Most Christmas carols reflect this older translation, with \\"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\\", for example, using the words \\"Peace on the earth, good will to men, / From Heaven's all gracious King.\\" The disparity reflects a dispute about the Greek text of the New Testament involving a single letter. The Greek text accepted by most modern scholars todayMarshall, I. Howard, The Gospel of Luke: A commentary on the Greek text, Eerdmans, 1978, , p. 111.Green, Joel B., The Gospel of Luke, Eerdmans, 1997, , p. 129. uses the words epi gƒìs eirƒìnƒì en anthr≈çpois eudokias (·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ Œ≥·øÜœÇ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒØŒ±œÇ), literally \\"on earth peace to men of good will,\\" with the last word being in the genitive case (apparently reflecting a Semitic idiom that reads strangely in Greek). Most ancient manuscripts of the Greek New Testament have this reading. The original version of the ancient Codex Sinaiticus (denoted ‚Ñµ* by scholarsAland and Aland, p. 233.) has this reading, but it has been altered by erasure of the last letterThe erasure is visible in the online Codex Sinaiticus at the top left of the relevant page, at the end of the sixth line of the first column . See also here for a manuscript comparison tool. to epi gƒìs eirƒìnƒì en anthr≈çpois eudokia (·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ Œ≥·øÜœÇ Œµ·º∞œÅŒÆŒΩŒ∑ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅœéœÄŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒØŒ±), literally \\"on earth (first subject: peace) to men (second subject: good will),\\" with two subjects in the nominative case. Expressed in correct English, this gives the familiar \\"Peace on earth, good will to men\\" of many ancient Christmas carols. This 1663 painting by Abraham Hondius has a matching painting of the Adoration of the shepherds. Even though some other ancient Greek manuscripts (and many medieval ones) agree with the edited Codex Sinaiticus, most modern scholars and Bible translators accept the reading of the majority of ancient manuscripts, translating as \\"on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests\\" (NIV) or \\"on earth peace among those with whom he is pleased\\"Luke 2:14, ESV (BibleGateway). (ESV). The Douay-Rheims Bible, translated from the Latin Vulgate, derives from the same Greek text as the original Codex Sinaiticus, but renders it \\"on earth peace to men of good will.\\"Douay-Rheims Bible online (Luke 2), from the Latin \\"in terra pax in hominibus bonae voluntatis.\\" In the New American Bible, this is updated to \\"on earth peace to those on whom his favor rests.\\"New American Bible online (Luke 2).See also here for a comparison of many other translations. Theological interpretation It is generally considered significant that this message was given to shepherds, who were located on the lower rungs of the social ladder in first-century Palestine.Green, p. 130. Contrasting with the more powerful characters mentioned in the Nativity, such as the Emperor Augustus, they seem to reflect Mary's words in the Magnificat: \\"He has brought down rulers from their thrones but has lifted up the humble.\\"Luke 1:52, NIV (BibleGateway). The shepherds, taken as Jewish, also combine with the gentile Three Magi, in later tradition thought to be one each from the three continents then known, to represent the first declaration of the Christian message to all the peoples of the world. The phrase \\"peace to men on whom his favor rests\\" has been interpreted both as expressing a restriction to a particular group of people that God has chosenMarshall, p. 112. and inclusively, as God displaying favor to the world.Green, p. 137. Depiction in art This fresco by Taddeo Gaddi in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence was painted between 1332 and 1338.Paoletti, John T. and Gary M. Radke, Art in Renaissance Italy, 3rd edition, Laurence King Publishing, 2005, , p. 91. Initially depicted only as part of a broader Nativity scene, the annunciation to the shepherds became an independent subject for art in the 9th century,Ross, Leslie, Medieval Art: A topical dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1996, , pp. 16‚Äì17. but has remained relatively uncommon as such, except in extended cycles with many scenes. The standard Byzantine depiction, still used in Eastern Orthodox icons to the present, is to show the scene in the background of a Nativity, typically on the right, while the Three Magi approach on the left. This is also very common in the West, though the Magi are very often omitted. For example, the 1485 Adoration of the shepherds scene by Domenico Ghirlandaio includes the annunciation to the shepherds peripherally, in the upper left corner, even though it represents an episode occurring prior to the main scene. Similarly, in the Nativity at Night of Geertgen tot Sint Jans, the annunciation to the shepherds is seen on a hillside through an opening in the stable wall. The Angel Appearing to the Shepherds, Govert Flinck, 1639 The Angel appearing to the Shepherds, fresco of the 12th century, Basilica of San Isidoro, Le√≥n Scenes showing the shepherds at the side of the crib are a different subject, formally known as the Adoration of the shepherds. This is very commonly combined with the Adoration of the Magi, which makes for a balanced composition, as the two groups often occupy opposite sides of the image space around the central figures, and fitted with the theological interpretation of the episode, where the two groups represented the peoples of the world between them. This combination is first found in the 6th-century Monza ampullae made in Palestine. The landscape varies, though scenes in the background of a Nativity very often show the shepherds on a steep hill, making visual sense of their placement above the main Nativity scene. The number of shepherds shown varies also, though three is typical in the West; one or more dogs may be included, as in the Taddeo Gaddi (right, with red collar). The annunciation to the shepherds became less common as an independent subject in the late Middle Ages, but depictions continued in later centuries. Famous depictions by Abraham Hondius and Rembrandt exist. Along with the Agony in the Garden and the Arrest of Christ the scene was one of those used most often in the development of the depiction of night scenes, especially in 15th century Early Netherlandish painting and manuscript illustration (see illustrations here and the Geertgen tot Sint Jans linked above). In Renaissance art, drawing on classical stories of Orpheus, the shepherds are sometimes depicted with musical instruments.Earls, Irene, Renaissance Art: A topical dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, , p. 18. A charming but atypical miniature in the La Flora Hours in Naples shows the shepherds playing to the Infant Jesus, as a delighted Virgin Mary stands to one side.  Music  Christmas cantatas often deal with the Annunciation. It features prominently in both Bach's Und es waren Hirten in derselben Gegend, Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, and in Part I of Handel's Messiah. =Christmas carols= Many Christmas carols mention the annunciation to the shepherds, with the Gloria in Excelsis Deo being the most ancient. Phillips Brooks' \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem\\" (1867) has the lines \\"O morning stars together, proclaim the holy birth, / And praises sing to God the King, and peace to men on earth!\\" The originally German carol \\"Silent Night\\" has \\"Shepherds quake at the sight; / Glories stream from heaven afar, / Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!\\" The episode plays a much greater role in Charles Wesley's \\"Hark! The Herald Angels Sing\\" (1739), which begins: > Hark! The herald angels sing, > \\"Glory to the newborn King; > Peace on earth, and mercy mild, > God and sinners reconciled!\\" > Joyful, all ye nations rise, > Join the triumph of the skies; > With th'angelic host proclaim, > \\"Christ is born in Bethlehem!\\" > Nahum Tate's well-known carol \\"While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks\\" (1700) is entirely devoted to describing the annunciation to the shepherds, and the episode is also significant in \\"The First Nowell\\", Angels from the Realms of Glory, the originally French carol \\"Angels We Have Heard on High\\", and several others. The carol \\"I Heard the Bells on Christmas Day\\", written by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow during the American Civil War, reflects on the phrase \\"Peace on earth, good will to men\\" in a pacifist sense, as does \\"It Came Upon the Midnight Clear\\".Browne, Ray B. and Browne, Pat, The Guide to United States Popular Culture, Popular Press, 2001, , p. 171. The German carol \\"Kommet, ihr Hirten\\" (Come, you Shepherds) reflects the Annunciation and the Adoration of the shepherds. In popular culture The phrase \\"Peace on earth, good will to men\\" has been widely used in a variety of contexts. For example, Samuel Morse's farewell message in 1871 read \\"Greetings and thanks to the telegraph fraternity throughout the world. Glory to God in the highest, on earth peace, good will to men. ‚Äì S. F. B. Morse.\\"Lewis Coe, The Telegraph: A history of Morse's invention and its predecessors in the United States, McFarland, 2003, , p. 36. Linus van Pelt recites the scene verbatim at the climax of A Charlie Brown Christmas, explaining that \\"that's what Christmas is all about\\". The novelty song \\"I Yust Go Nuts at Christmas\\" uses the line to juxtapose the meaning of the holiday with the often chaotic nature of the celebrations; as Gabriel Heatter preaches the annunciation of peace and good will, ‚Äú(just) at that moment, someone slugs Uncle Ben.‚Äù Image gallery Joachim Wtewael - Annunciation to the Shepherds - Google Art Project.jpg Joachim Wtewael, Annunciation to the Shepherds, 1606 Jules Bastien-Lepage - The Annunciation to the Shepherds - Google Art Project.jpgJules Bastien-Lepage, The Annunciation to the Shepherds, 1875 The Shepherds and the Angel.jpg Carl Bloch, The Sheperds and the angel, 1879 Heinrich Vogeler Verk√ºndigung an die Hirten 1902.jpgHeinrich Vogeler The Annunciation to the Shepherds, 1902 Henry Ossawa Tanner - Angels Appearing before the Shepherds.jpgHenry Ossawa Tanner, Angels Appearing before the Shepherds, 1910 Angel of the Lord window.jpgWindow at St. Matthew's, 1912 References Angelic apparitions in the Bible Gospel of Luke Nativity of Jesus in the New Testament Shepherds ","title":"Annunciation to the shepherds"},{"id":"20704068","text":"Guillermo Franco may refer to: *Guillermo Franco (born 1976), Argentine- Mexican football striker *Guillermo Franco (football defender) (born 1983), Argentine football defender *Guillermo Franco (Ecuadorian general) (born 1811), Ecuadorian historical figure See also *Guilherme Franco (born 1946), Brazilian jazz percussionist ","title":"Guillermo Franco (disambiguation)"},{"id":"20704078","text":"Slow Water is a 2003 novel by New Zealand author Annamarie Jagose.

It is unaffiliated with LEGO, instead privately owned and operated by designer Will Chapman from his home in Redmond, Washington. The company was briefly the subject of controversy when one of its products was accused of being based on a member of al-Qaeda (see Bandit Controversy)  Products  BrickArms produces a variety of minifigure- compatible accessories including an M4 carbine, M21 Sniper Rifle, M1 Garand, M84 grenades, M1 Helmet, Stahlhelm, Minigun, AK-47, M3 Grease Gun, M16, and a Combat Shotgun, along with many other items related to warfare. The accessories are designed by Chapman using a CAD program and are prototyped using a small mold cut by Chapman using a CNC to test the proportions, aesthetics, and playability of the resulting prototype. Once the design of an accessory is finalized, it is mass-produced via injection molding of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) plastic into professionally tooled production molds. In 2013 World War Brick, a lego fan event, Brickarms brought a new series of weapons called Over Molded. These weapons were more detail and colored. Using a special \\"overmolded\\" technique, Will Chapman was able to hand-inject these special two-color BrickArms weapons. These are not painted, but two colors of solid ABS plastic molded into one piece. Each one comes in a special \\"BrickArms Reloaded\\" blister pack and are rare. Brickarms is also known for its minifigs such as a colonial marine based on the game Aliens: Colonial Marines, Shaun based on the movie Shaun of the dead, and Private Ryan from Saving Private Ryan. History BrickArms began in 2006 when Ian Chapman, Will Chapman's youngest son (9 at the time), approached him with the need for World War II weaponry for his LEGO builds. Ian was disappointed with what historical weaponry LEGO offered. Will ultimately choose to begin to design and produce his own, more accurate minifigure accessories, running the company from the Chapmans' garage in Redmond, Washington and packing orders in the family's bonus room. In 2011 Will and Jennifer Chapman decided to focus solely on the creation and production of the BrickArms product line. On May 1, they ceased direct sales on the BrickArms website. However, on the same date, the Chapmans' nephew Keith Nelson and his wife, Julie, launched the new GI Brick website, becoming the third authorized reseller of the BrickArms line in the United States.  Bandit controversy  On December 4, 2008, a BrickArms custom minifig called the \\"White Bandit\\" sparked controversy when The Sun (United Kingdom) published an article claiming the figure was based on a follower of Osama Bin Laden. Chapman has denied this, saying it \\"is merely a bad guy for the good guys to battle.\\"> A spokesman for BrickArms also commented extensively on the article and the nature of the \\"White Bandit\\" custom figure, restating Chapman's assertion that the figure was a generic villain not based on any one person or group  References  Further reading  External links  * Lego Companies based in Redmond, Washington ","title":"BrickArms"},{"id":"20704115","text":"A transitional phrase, in United States patent law, is a phrase that links the preamble of a patent claim to the specific elements set forth in the claim which define what the invention itself actually is. The transitional phrase acts as a limitation on the claim, indicating whether a similar device, method, or composition infringes the patent if it contains more or fewer elements than the claim in the patent. There are three kinds of transitional phrases: open, closed, and hybrid. Closed transition A closed transition usually uses the words \\"consisting of.‚Äù Use of this phrase limits the preamble to exactly what follows and nothing more. An example would be a patent claim for a pencil, which might say in the preamble \\"a writing device\\", followed by the closed transition \\"consisting of\\", and concluding with a description such as \\"a cylindrical piece of lead, graphite, or another material similarly capable of leaving a mark when drawn against a surface, and a second surrounding material encasing the first\\". A third party who sold pencils including both a cylinder of writing material and a casing material, but added to his pencils an eraser fixed to one end, would therefore not be in violation of the patent. Use of such a transition makes it easy for a competitor to compete with the patented product without infringing it, because it allows the competitor to sell a similar device so long as the competitor makes an addition to what is claimed. However, it also may assist the patent owner in avoiding prior art, which might otherwise block the patent from issuing. Open transition An open transition usually uses the word \\"comprises\\" or \\"comprising\\". This is the broadest form of transition, as it does not limit the preamble to whatever elements are identified in the claim. If the above patent used the word \\"comprising\\" instead of \\"consisting of\\", then the third party's pencil-plus-eraser would be infringing (assuming that the patent is otherwise valid). Hybrid transition A third kind of transition, the hybrid transition, uses the phrase \\"consisting essentially of\\". The effect of this transitional phrase is to leave the claim \\"open\\" to include additional elements, but only if those additional elements do not materially affect the basic and novel characteristics of the claimed combination. In this instance, the pencil with the eraser added might still not be infringing, but a pencil with a fin or a non-functional button would still infringe, because the thing that was added would serve no purpose material to the claimed functions of the pencil. This language assists in avoiding prior art, but is broad enough to capture imperfect attempts to copy the patented device. See also * Point of novelty Sources * Randall R. Rader, John R.

The cover art is by Umberto Boccioni. The Manifesto of Futurist Musicians is a manifesto written by Francesco Balilla Pratella on October 11, 1910.Tisdall, Caroline, Futurist Music 1910-1920: Luigi Russolo and Francesco Balila Pratella, It was one of the earliest signs of Futurism's influence in fields outside of the visual arts. In the manifesto, Pratella appeals to the youth for only they can understand what he says and they are thirsty for 'the new, the actual, the lively.' He goes on to talk about the degeneration of Italian music to that of a vulgar melodrama which he realized through winning a prize for one of his musical Futurist works, La Sina d'Vargoun based on one of Pratella's free verse poems. As part of his monetary prize, he was able to put on a performance of that work, which received mixed reviews. Through his entry into Italian musical society, he was able to experience firsthand the 'intellectual mediocrity' and 'commercial baseness' that makes Italian music inferior to the Futurist evolution of music in other countries. He then goes on to list composers in other European countries who are making strides in the futurist evolution of music even when battling tradition. For example Pratella discusses the geniuses of Richard Wagner and Richard Strauss and how they struggled to combat and overcome the past with innovatory talent. He expresses his admiration for Edward Elgar in England because he is destroying the past by resisting the will to amplify symphonic forms, and is finding new ways to combine instruments for different effects, which keeps in line with the Futurist aesthetic. Pratella also mentions Finland and Sweden, countries in which innovations are being made by means of nationalism and poeticism, citing the works of Sibelius. After this list, he raises the question of musical innovation of Italian composers. He states that 'vegetating' schools, conservatories, and academies are likes snares on youths and that the impotency of professors and masters underline traditionalism while stifling efforts to be innovative. Pratella says that this results in the repression of free and daring tendencies, the prostitution of the glories of music's past, and the limitation of a study of forms of a dead culture, among other things. Pratella then laments the young musical talents who fixate themselves on writing operas under the protection of publishing houses, only to see them fail to have their work realized because the operas are badly written (for lack of a strong ideological and technical foundation) and rarely staged. And the few who do get their works staged only experience ephemeral successes. Next, Pratella talks about the pure symphony and how it is a refuge for the failed opera composers he previously mentioned, who justify their failures by preaching the death of the music drama. Evoking the double-edged sword, Pratella points out that they confirm the traditional claim that Italian composers are inept at the symphonic form, the most noble and vital form of composition. And it is only the writer's own impotence to blame for this double failure. He then scolds them for writing \\"well-made music,\\" or music that appeals to the population, and scolds the public for letting itself be cheated by its own free will. The author moves on to the topic of commercialism and the power of publisher-merchants, claiming that they impose limitations on operatic forms and proclaim the models that cannot be surpassed (the 'vulgar' operas of Giacomo Puccini and Umberto Giordano). He also points out how publishers have the power of controlling public tastes, harboring a sense of the Italian monopoly on melody and bel canto. Pratella then praises one Italian composer and a publisher's favorite, Pietro Mascagni, for his will to rebel against the traditions of art, the publishers, and the public. To the author, Mascagni has shown great talent in his attempts at innovation in the harmonic and lyrical aspects of opera. The Futurist Manifesto is evoked towards the end of Pratella's manifesto, as he reiterates Futurism's pursuit of the rebellion of the life of intuition and feeling and the exaltation of the past at the expense of the future. He calls for the young composers to have the 'hearts to live and fight, minds to conceive, and brows free of cowardice.' Pratella then frees himself from the 'chains of tradition, doubt, opportunism, and vanity.' Pratella offers his conclusions to the 'young, bold and the restless' while repudiating the title of Maestro as a stigma of mediocrity and ignorance: #To convince young composers to desert schools, conservatories and musical academies, and to consider free study as the only means of regeneration. #To combat the venal and ignorant critics with assiduous contempt, liberating the public from the pernicious effects of their writings. #To found with this aim in view a musical review that will be independent and resolutely opposed to the criteria of conservatory professors and to those of the debased public. #To abstain from participating in any competition with the customary closed envelopes and related admission charges, denouncing all mystifications publicly, and unmasking the incompetence of juries, which are generally composed of fools and impotents. #To keep at a distance from commercial or academic circles, despising them, and preferring a modest life to bountiful earnings acquired by selling art. #The liberation of individual musical sensibility from all imitation or influence of the past, feeling and singing with the spirit open to the future, drawing inspiration and aesthetics from nature, through all the human and extra-human phenomena present in it. Exalting the man-symbol everlastingly renewed by the varied aspects of modern life and its infinity of intimate relationships with nature. #To destroy the prejudice for ‚Äúwell-made‚Äù music‚Äîrhetoric and impotence‚Äîto proclaim the unique concept of Futurist music, as absolutely different from music to date, and so to shape in Italy a Futurist musical taste, destroying doctrinaire, academic and soporific values, declaring the phrase ‚Äúlet us return to the old masters‚Äù to be hateful, stupid and vile. #To proclaim that the reign of the singer must end, and that the importance of the singer in relation to a work of art is the equivalent of the importance of an instrument in the orchestra. #To transform the title and value of the ‚Äúoperatic libretto‚Äù into the title and value of ‚Äúdramatic or tragic poem for music‚Äù, substituting free verse for metric structure. Every opera writer must absolutely and necessarily be the author of his own poem. #To combat categorically all historical reconstructions and traditional stage sets and to declare the stupidity of the contempt felt for contemporary dress. #To combat the type of ballad written by Tosti and Costa, nauseating Neapolitan songs and sacred music which, having no longer any reason to exist, given the breakdown of faith, has become the exclusive monopoly of impotent conservatory directors and a few incomplete priests. #To provoke in the public an ever-growing hostility towards the exhumation of old works which prevents the appearance of innovators, to encourage the support and exaltation of everything in music that appears original and revolutionary, and to consider as an honor the insults and ironies of moribunds and opportunists.  Other writings  Pratella authored two more manifestos, the \\"Technical Manifesto of Futurist Music\\" and \\"The Destruction of Quadrature.\\" These manifestos along with \\"Manifesto for Futurist Musicians\\" were published together in 1912.

Captain John A. Henriques accepted her for service on 6 June 1874, and she was commissioned into the Revenue Cutter Service on 18 June 1874. Her role in the rescue of passengers from a sinking passenger ship under winter gale winds brought her nationwide popular acclaim. Early service Dexter was stationed at Newport, Rhode Island. She patrolled the Long Island Sound and east to Nantucket, Massachusetts, enforcing customs laws, patrolling regattas, and assisting mariners in distress, among other duties. She also made annual winter cruises as directed, usually off Edgartown, Massachusetts to Nantucket Shoals, and from Gay Head, Massachusetts, to Sandy Hook, New Jersey. Rescue of SS City of Columbus City of Columbus and Revenue Cutter Dexter Schell and Hogan, 1884 In the early morning hours of 18 January 1884, out of Boston, Massachusetts bound for Savannah, Georgia ran aground on rocks near Martha's Vineyard. Due to high winds and cold weather, only a few lifeboats were able to be launched and most of them contained members of the crew rather than passengers.King, pp 63‚Äì69 No help arrived on scene for more than five hours, with the first help coming from lifeboats manned by Massachusetts Humane Society volunteers of Wampanoag American Indians from Gay Head. They managed to rescue 19 persons from the cold water with only one person dying afterward. Dexter arrived on scene at 1230 and spotted men clinging to the masts and rigging of City of Columbus. Captain Eric Gabrielson ordered the cutter's gig launched for a rescue attempt. Lieutenant Charles D. Kennedy and four volunteers rescued the captain of the sunken steamer and four of his men that had been clinging to the rigging for twelve hours. Second Lieutenant John U. Rhodes managed to save two men and recovered the bodies of others that were frozen to the rigging after several attempts. City of Columbus had left Boston with 45 officers and crew and 87 passengers, only 17 crew members and 12 passengers survived the ordeal. Rhodes was awarded a gold medal from the Humane Society for his efforts as well as a gold medal from the German- American Society of Wilmington, North Carolina. Silver medals were awarded by the Humane Society for Captain Gabrielson and Lieutenant Kennedy. The Wampanoag volunteers and the crew of Dexter were thanked in a joint resolution by Congress for their \\"brave and humane conduct\\". The Connecticut legislature passed a resolution praising the crew of Dexter. Public subscriptions rewarded Rhodes with $2053 and the Wampanoag lifesavers $3,500. Rhodes split his reward with the officers and crew of Dexter, giving each officer $150 and each crewman a new uniform, mattress and bedding. Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and later service At the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in April 1898 the Revenue Cutter Service was transferred to the control of the U.S. Navy by executive order and the U.S. Army asked the Navy to provide protection to Army shore installations on the East Coast and the Gulf of Mexico. In addition, many cities along both coastlines were concerned about security. The Navy did not have any ships to spare for the task of security of the coast and directed the Revenue Cutter Service to perform the task. The cutters assigned to this task were a part of the \\"Flying Squadron\\" under the command of Navy Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. Dexter was assigned the area around Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island to patrol.King, pp 120‚Äì122 In 1904 Dexter was ordered to Puerto Rico. She returned to Newport in 1905.

Originally released on his 1965 album of the same name, \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\" is one of Ochs' best-known songs. Ochs wrote \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\" as American involvement in the Vietnam War was beginning to grow. The song criticizes all of American military history from the perspective of a weary soldier who has been present at every single war since the War of 1812. The chorus notes that \\"it's always the old who lead us to the war, always the young to fall\\" and asks whether the price of military victory has been too high. Ochs said of the song that it \\"borders between pacifism and treason, combining the best qualities of both.\\" He also wrote \\"the fact that you won't be hearing this song on the radio is more than enough justification for the writing of it.\\" According to one biographer, \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\" \\"instantly became [Ochs'] signature song\\". Ochs performed it at concerts and rallies for the remainder of his career, almost always drawing cheers from the audience. Ochs performed the song in 1967 on the ABC television special Dissent or Treason, one of the rare instances in which he appeared on a national American television broadcast. In August 1968, Ochs performed \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\" during the protests outside the Democratic National Convention, inspiring hundreds of young men to burn their draft cards. Ochs described it as the highlight of his career. Ochs was subsequently called as a witness in the trial of the Chicago Seven, who were charged with conspiracy and other crimes related to the protests. The defense attorneys asked Ochs to sing \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\", but the judge wouldn't allow it. Instead, Ochs recited the lyrics. Folk-rock version In 1966, Ochs recorded a folk-rock version of \\"I Ain't Marching Any More\\". He was accompanied by The Blues Project and a bagpipe player. The new version of the song was released as a single in the U.K. and as a flexi disc in Sing Out! magazine. Critic Richie Unterberger wrote of the folk-rock version, \\"If ever there was a successful reworking of a plaintive acoustic song into a dynamic electric one, this ... was it\\". The single failed to chart.

The explosion caused the three-story building to collapse, crashing down on about 200 diners and employees, killing 18 people, all Spanish citizens, and injuring 82 others, including eleven Americans working at the nearby Torrej√≥n Air Base who frequented the restaurant. At the time it was the worst attack in Spain since the Spanish Civil War. Bombing At about 22:30, a bomb exploded in the El Descanso-La Casa de las Costillas restaurant, causing the three-story building housing the restaurant to collapse. The building crashed down on about 200 diners and employees present in the restaurant, killing 18 people and injuring 82. Fifteen American servicemen of the nearby American Torrej√≥n Air Base were among the injured, but while being frequented by air base staff the timing of the bomb occurred at an hour few Americans typically were present. The police investigation concluded that the explosion was caused by a 13-pound chloratite bomb planted near the bathroom of the restaurant, consisting of a chemical compound made up of potassium, sulfur and chlorate, a type of explosive said to be rarely used by domestic Spanish terrorist groups. Investigation Groups claiming responsibility for the attack included Basque separatist group ETA, the First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups (GRAPO), Unity of the Abu Zeinab Martyrs, Wa'd (a front of the PFLP-SC) and the Islamic Jihad Organization. The callers from ETA claimed the bomb had gone off earlier than planned and that the bombing was meant to target American soldiers who would have been in the restaurant later, and apologised to the victims of the bombing. After first blaming ETA, Spanish Interior Minister Jos√© Barrionuevo concluded the Islamic Jihad Organization and Wa'd had the most credible claim of responsibility following investigations by the National Police. The claim by Wa'd, distributed by the Kuwait News Agency was noted as it included the anagram of the sugar envelopes from the El Descanso restaurant. ETA was also known to have had ties to extremists in Lebanon and Syria where they had access to training camps, and investigators suspected links between Islamic Jihad, ETA and GRAPO. Islamic Jihad had itself been implicated in several attacks in Spain the previous year, including a machine gun attack on a Kuwaiti newspaper publisher and the killing and wounding of two Saudi Arabians, both attacks in Marbella, and the shooting of a Lebanese embassy employee in Madrid. According to the El Pa√≠s newspaper and the Group of Strategic Studies, which cite the attack as \\"the first attack of Islamist terrorism in Spain,\\" the credibility of Islamic Jihad eventually gained weight, also as a letter circulated two weeks after the bombing stated: \\"Islam is ready. Spain and Italy are the first targets. The attack in Madrid has been the beginning of the Islamic holy war. Death to the United States.

She was the third ship of the United States Revenue Cutter Service and United States Coast Guard to bear the name. Dexter was built by the Defoe Boat and Motor Works at Bay City, Michigan. She was commissioned into the Coast Guard in 1925. Dexter was stationed at Boston, Massachusetts, from 1925 until 1927. She was then transferred to Pascagoula, Mississippi late in 1927. By 1935 she had been transferred to Buffalo, New York. Dexter was decommissioned in 1936. She was then transferred to the United States Navy. On June 19, 2010 Dexter (known as Buccaneer) was sunk in Lake Michigan as an artificial reef. Dexter is also a ship of some historical significance. During her tenure as a revenue cutter she sank the Canadian rum running sloop I'm Alone in the Gulf of Mexico, in 1929. While I'm Alone had allegedly been sighted within U.S. territorial waters, the actual sinking occurred in international waters, 200 miles out in the Gulf of Mexico. One crew member from the sloop was killed during the sinking, he was a French national. This created quite an international incident involving Canada, Britain and France. The resulting lawsuit was settled in 1936. After being stricken from the U.S. Coast Guard rolls in 1936, the Dexter was turned over to the U.S. Navy, in Buffalo New York, and renamed YP-63. She saw action during World War II patrolling in the Caribbean, based out of Trinidad, on the Atlantic Sea Frontier. She is officially cited in the \\"Chronology of the U.S. Navy in World War II\\". On June 16, 1942, YP-63 (ex-USCGC Dexter) and the coastal yacht Opal rescued 91 survivors from three successive merchant ships sunk by the German U boats: U-126, U-161 and U-502. After the war she was acquired by various private interests. She saw service as a recreational fishing vessel off Boston, an oil drilling services vessel off Louisiana and finally ended up in Chicago, as a pirate themed party boat. It is ironic that this vessel, originally created to enforce prohibition, became the MV Buccaneer, dedicated to providing quantities of booze to her willing customers. For three years Buccaneer was at a marina on the Little Calumet River being prepared for sinking in Lake Michigan as a dive attraction. She was finally sunk in Lake Michigan on June 18, 2010. She now resides in 74 ft. of water about seven miles off Chicago. The vessel is now a scuba diving destination and an artificial reef. She rests upright in 70' in Lake Michigan about 10 miles off Chicago's coast.

They were formulated by the linguist Otto Behaghel in the last volume of his four volume work Deutsche Syntax: Eine geschichtliche Darstellung (published 1923-1932). They include the following cross-language principles: # Elements that belong close together intellectually will also be placed close together (Behaghel‚Äôs First Law) # That which is less important (or already known to the listener) is placed before that which is important. (Behaghel‚Äôs Second Law) # The distinguishing phrase precedes that which is distinguished. # Given two phrases, when possible, the shorter precedes the longer. (Law of Increasing Terms (or Constituents)) It is thus ensured that the utterances that the speaker finds important will remain in the thoughts of the listener, in that they are at the end of the sentence. From Behaghel‚Äôs Laws evolved the later Theme-rheme. They serve together with other of his topics as suggestions for research in Quantitative Linguistics. Behaghel's law of increasing terms is also known as \\"Panini's Law\\" after the Sanskrit grammarian.

He participated in the Second Crusade fought by Christians between 1146 and 1149 to defend the Holy Land following the Turkish atabeg Zengi's capture of the strategically important city of Edessa in 1144.  Life  Ernest is a Germanic name meaning severe. Not much is known about Saint Ernest's life. He was born of a noble family in Steisslingen, Germany, and along with his two brothers became important patrons of reformed monasteries in Swabia.Herman Josef Pretsch, \\"Abt Ernest von Zwiefalten. Eine quellenkritische Untersuchung,\\" Rottenburger Jahrbuch f≈´r Kirchengeschichte 5 (1986): 331-338 How and when Ernst entered the religious life is not clear. A donation to Zwiefalten by the three brothers from 1131 suggests they might have taken monastic vows as early as that time, while the later Vita Ernusti claims he was a child oblate.Pretsch, 333 Because the Hirsau rule, which Zwiefalten followed, did not permit child oblates, this later tradition is likely invented.  The Crusade  When St. Bernard called for participation in the Second Crusade to defend the Latin Kingdom and roll back Zengi's advances in Syria, the German king Conrad III, along with many other nobles and churchmen, including Ernest, responded. Ernest attached himself to a contingent of pilgrims and fighters led by the king's brother, bishop Otto of Freising. The crusade was not successful. The German armies suffered massive attrition on their march through Asia Minor and those few who did make it to join the other Crusader forces led by the French king Louis VII in the Holy Land eventually retreated from an ill-considered siege of Damascus in July 1148 and returned home in ignominy.Jonathan Phillips, The Second Crusade, Ch. 9 Otto of Freising's group progressed along the southwestern coastal route across Anatolia from Ephesus to Laodicia before making for the coast and securing naval passage to Antioch.Phillips, 184 They suffered nearly the whole way from severe hunger and other deprivations, including ambushes by Turkish forces in which numerous Christians were taken prisoner or killed.  Martyrdom  St. Ernest himself did not reach Jerusalem. There are no eyewitness or near-contemporary accounts of what happened to him, but a later twelfth-century hagiography, the Vita S. Ernusti abbatis, written at Zwiefalten, describes how he was taken captive by Saracens in an ambush, and then, along with 40 other Christian prisoners selected for their youth and comeliness, brought to Mecca and presented to the \\"king of Persia.\\" In the vita's account, the king orders Ernest and the other Christians to venerate his pagan gods, but Ernest steadfastly refuses. Brutally tortured, he is brought once again before the idols and told to worship them. Instead, he stones the idols with rocks, smashing them to pieces. Ernest is then killed by having his viscera drawn out of his navel and wound around a rod.A fragment of the original vita survives on the first several folia of Stuttgart, WLB, Cod. hist. fol. 419, but more complete versions were copied in the early modern period. See the critical edition of the vita in K. Brehm, \\"Abt Ernst von Zwiefalten,\\" Schw√§bisches Archiv 29 (1911), 97-100. The story contains a number of fanciful elements, but reproduces in particular the popular medieval image of Muslims as idolaters, a myth that Otto of Freising himself went to some lengths to dispel in his chronicle On the History of the Two Cities.John V.

The band's arrangements vary from solo acoustic song settings to full band (adding electric guitar, bass, and drums) with strings, a horn section, and keyboard instruments. Their music does not fit into one genre, which is a quality they share with many jam bands, but Goodbye Picasso's live performances do not generally feature long improvised sections. The group is influenced by the experimental tendencies of Radiohead and Wilco, but have an accessible quality similar to the music of Damien Rice, Pete Yorn, My Morning Jacket, and Iron and Wine.

It is sometimes considered a be a predecessor state to the Mongol Empire.History of the Mongolian People's Republic By AkademiiÔ∏†aÔ∏° nauk SSSR, p.99 The existence of a somewhat mysterious tribal power known in Mongol tradition as Khamag Mongol Uls is recorded in sources of Khitan Liao dynasty (907‚Äì1125) in North China and eastern Mongolia.Khamag Mongol Uls After the fall of Liao dynasty in 1125, the Khamag Mongols began to play an important role on the Mongolian plains.Histoire de la Mongolie By L√°szl√≥ L≈ërincz, p.43 They occupied one of the most fertile lands of the country, the basins of the river Onon, Kherlen and Tuul Rivers in the Khentii Mountains. The Taichiud (Cyrillic: –¢–∞–π—á—É—É–¥) was one of the three core tribes in the Khamag Mongol Khanate of Mongolia during the 12th century and whose people lived in the southern part of Siberia's Zabaykalsky Krai. Zabaykalsky Krai and the Mongolian Khentii Province were core regions of the Khamag Mongol Khanate.History of Mongolia, Volume II, 2003 The Khamags consisted of the three core clans Khiyad, Taichuud, Jalairs. The first khan of Khamag Mongol recorded in history is Khabul Khan from the Borjigin clan. Khabul Khan successfully repelled the invasions of the Jurchen Jin armies. Khabul Khan was succeeded by Ambaghai Khagann of the Taichiud. Ambagai was captured by the Tatar confederation while delivering his daughter for marriage to their leadership. He was handed over to the Jin, who cruelly executed him. Ambaghai was succeeded by Hotula Khan, a son of Khabul Khan. Hotula Khan engaged the Tatars in 13 battles in an effort to obtain vengeance for the death of Ambagai Khan. Khamag Mongol was unable to elect a khan after Hotula died. However, Khabul's grandson Yesugei, who was a chief of the Khiyad tribe, was an effective and preeminent leader of Khamag Mongol. Temujin, the future Genghis Khan, was born into Yesugei's family as the first son in Del√º√ºn Boldog on the upper reaches of the Onon river in 1162. When young Tooril Khan asked for help from Yesugei, the ruler of the Khamag Mongol,He never assumed the title the Khan of the Khamag Mongol but baghatur (hero) to dethrone his brothers among the Keraites, the Mongols helped him defeat the Keraite leaders and put him on the throne in the early 12th century. Yesugei was poisoned by the Tatars in 1170 and shortly after Yesugei died. The Khamag Mongol began to disintegrate after Yesugei's death in 1171. Political anarchy and a power vacuum lasted until 1189 when Temujin became the Khan of the Khamag Mongol. War broke soon out between other Mongol tribes. Temujin's friend Jamukha was recognized by the rival tribes as Gur-Khan (the universal ruler) in 1201 but he was defeated by the alliance of Khamag Mongol and Keraites. When Tooril Khan refused to cement the alliance with the Khamag, Temujin's wars with the clans nearly destroyed him. Temujin united all clans on the Mongolian plateau at last in 1206, when he was given the title Genghis Khan.

Brandler is best remembered as the head of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) during the party's ill-fated \\"March Action\\" of 1921 and aborted uprising of 1923, for which he was held responsible by the Communist International. Expelled from the Communist Party in December 1928, Brandler went on to become co-founder of the Communist Party of Germany Opposition, the first national section of the so-called International Right Opposition. Biography =Early years= Heinrich Brandler was born July 3, 1881 to an ethnic German working-class family in Varnsdorf, Bohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire.This region was known in Germany as Sudetenland. Heinrich's father, Joseph Brandler, was a bricklayer by trade, and he taught his son the craft from an early age.Klaus Sch√∂enhoven, \\"Heinrich Brandler,\\" in A. Thomas Lane (ed.), Biographical Dictionary of European Labor Leaders: A-L. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1995; pp. 130-131. After completing his elementary education, Heinrich traveled Europe for several years as a journeyman tiler and bricklayer. Brandler was active in the German trade union movement from 1897.Pierre Brou√©, The German Revolution, 1917-1923. (1971) John Archer, trans. Chicago: Haymarket Books, 2006; pp. 960-961. Early in his working career, Brandler was injured in a job-related accident which caused him to walk with a limp for the rest of his life. =Rise to political power= Brandler joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1901, while living in the city of Hamburg and taking an active part in the leadership of the construction workers' union there. In 1904 he moved to Bremen, where he remained through 1908 as an activist both in union and political affairs. Brandler associated with the left wing of the SPD and was sympathetic to the views of Karl Liebknecht, which often brought him into conflict with more cautious and temperate members of the party and union organizations.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pp. 42-43. From there, Brandler moved to Zurich, Switzerland, remaining there from 1908 to 1914. While in Switzerland, Brandler worked during the summer building season as a stonemason and further supplemented his income as a socialist lecturer and teacher. Brandler returned to Germany in 1914, just prior to the outbreak of World War I, settling in Chemnitz as secretary of the building workers' union. Brandler was militant in his opposition to the war, joining the International Group of Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht ‚Äî factional activity which ran him afoul of the SPD leadership and ultimately led to his expulsion from the SPD in 1915, along with Fritz Heckert. Brandler was named the delegate of the International Group to the first Zimmerwald Conference but was stopped by the police at the Swiss border and was unable to attend. On January 1, 1916, Brandler was a founding member of the Spartacist League, the formal organization springing from the already-existing International Group. In October 1918, Brandler was arrested for illegal political activities and was temporarily deported from Germany, owing to his Austrian citizenship. He subsequently obtained German nationality status through Gerhard Eisner's government in Bavaria, which allowed his return. Brandler was a founding member of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in December of that same year. He was elected to the party's National Committee at the organization's 2nd Congress, held in 1919. Brandler thus became one of the few members of the working class itself in the active leadership of the German Communist Party.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923, Volume 3. London: Macmillan, 1953; pg. 170. Home in Chemnitz, Brandler established a communist newspaper called Der K√§mpfer (The Fighter) and helped build a powerful local unit of the KPD. He organized workers' councils in Chemnitz immediately after the failure of the ultra- nationalist Kapp Putsch of 1920. On March 15, 1920, Brandler and other Chemnitz communists joined the local social democrats in proclaiming a Soviet government for common defense against the nationalists. This proved to be an ephemeral institution which faded away after a few days when the generals and their government were ousted from Berlin.Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, vol. 3, pg. 173. He was elected to the governing executive body of the KPD in 1920 and reported to the party's Unification Congress on organizational matters later that year. Aided by Comintern pressure, Brandler's faction took over leadership of the KPD in 1921, with Brandler replacing Paul Levi as KPD Chairman in February. Brandler was leader of the party during the KPD's ill- fated \\"March Action\\" of 1921, a role which placed him on a collision course with civil authorities following the failure of the uprising. In June 1921, Brandler was convicted in a treason trial and sentenced to five years' imprisonment in a fortress. The term was ended abruptly in November of that same year, after which Brandler left for Moscow, where he sat on the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI) on behalf of the German party. Brandler was elected to the ECCI Presidium at its First Enlarged Plenum in February 1922. Brandler was also active in the affairs of the Red International of Labor Unions (Profintern) during this interval. =Role in the failed 1923 revolution= Brandler returned to Germany in the August 1922, assuming once again the role of top leader of the German Communist Party, a position temporarily held by factional ally Ernst Meyer. Brandler, August Thalheimer, and the KPD \\"Right\\" were soon at odds with the party's left wing, chiefly over the issues of the united front and the role of the communists in coalition governments. With respect to the united front, Brandler sought common cause not only with the rank and file but also with the leadership of other workers' parties, while the Left sought to implement a so-called \\"united front from below\\" by seeking to work with rank and file members in an attempt to turn them against their leaders. With respect to coalition government, Brandler and the Right deemed it permissible for the Communist Party to enter regional coalition governments with the Social Democrats, while the Left declared that any government not dominated by the Communist Party was unworthy of KPD participation.E.H. Carr, A History of Soviet Russia: The Interregnum, 1923-1924. London: Macmillan, 1954; pp. 157-158. At the 8th Congress of the KPD, held in Leipzig on January 28, 1923, Brandler and Thalheimer's faction prevailed over the KPD Left, a group led by Ernst Thaelmann, Arkadi Maslow, and Ruth Fischer. Brandler's faction was the beneficiary of key support from Karl Radek, a top leader of the Communist International.Carr, The Interregnum, pg. 157. Brandler's position as head of the KPD was solidified and his tactical interpretation of the united front and coalition \\"workers' government\\" was affirmed. The left wing of the KPD believed that a revolutionary situation existed in Germany in 1923 and anxiously pushed for the setting of a date for a general uprising on the Russian Bolshevik model. While giving support to this general idea in the party's councils, in private Brandler seems to have felt that Germany was no yet ripe for a revolution and he sought additional time to win a greater percentage of the German working class to the idea. In September 1923, Brandler returned to Moscow for consultations. At a secret meeting of the Politburo of the Russian Communist Party it was decided, at the insistence of Leon Trotsky, to set November 7, 1923 ‚Äî the sixth anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution ‚Äî as the date for the German uprising.Carr, The Interregnum, pp. 204-205. Brandler refused to accept the setting of this artificial future date, however, winning agreement that the final date of the uprising should be left to the German Communists themselves.Carr, The Interregnum, pg. 206. Brandler returned to Germany with plans for revolution in the offing. In Saxony the Social Democrats governed thanks to supporting votes by Communist delegates in the Landtag. It was understood that the Communists could claim a share of the ministerial portfolios if they so desired. Following Brandler's return, the Communist Party decided to exercise this option, doing the same in Thuringia, where a similar situation existed. It was hoped that the Communists' place in the government would prove useful in course the forthcoming armed uprising. Negotiations began for entry of the Communists into the government. Brandler remained reluctant to set the final date for the revolution, however, arguing that the time was still not ripe and that the masses remained to be mobilized.Carr, The Interregnum, pg. 207. On October 1, 1923, a telegram signed by Comintern President Grigory Zinoviev on behalf of the Executive Committee of the Comintern was dispatched to the national committee of the German Communist Party declaring that by its estimate \\"the decisive moment will come in four, five, six weeks.\\" The Communists were directed to \\"carry out at once the arming of 50,000 to 60,000 men.\\"Cited in Carr, The Intrregnum, pp. 207-208. This proved to be a fanciful estimate, however, as the party possessed no more than 11,000 rifles and the bulk of its armed forces were far away from Saxony, where the proposed uprising was to be centered.Carr, The Interregnum, pg. 211. Exacerbating their weak numbers in terms of men and material, the Communists faced a substantial contingent of Reichswehr, with superior training and armaments, as well as illegal right wing militias.Carr, The Interregnum, pg. 212. The number of purported sympathizers among the regular officers corps was greatly exaggerated, as was the degree of support for the Communist project among the working class itself.Carr, The Interregnum, pp. 212-213. In 1923, Brandler was responsible for calling off a planned revolutionary uprising following the defection of left-wing Social Democrats from the revolutionary group. An ill-fated uprising continued in Hamburg, conducted when workers were not properly informed of the cancellation of the revolt. Brandler and his close associate August Thalheimer were largely blamed for this debacle by the Comintern and his career as leader of the German Communist movement was effectively ended. He was recalled to the Soviet Union by the Comintern in January 1924, and he remained that country for the best part of the next four years. The disgraced Brandler was sent on a party task to Kazakhstan in Soviet Central Asia, where he remained until being partially restored to the Comintern's good graces sometime in 1926. This respite proved to be short-lived. Brandler and his associates were harsh critics of new German Communist Party leader Ernst Thaelmann, an individual stoutly supported by the ever more powerful Russian Communist Party leadership.Robert J. Alexander, The Right Opposition: The Lovestoneites and the International Communist Opposition of the 1930s. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1981; pg. 135. Brandler again became the object of harsh criticism for factional activity at the 7th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI in the winter of 1926, ending with a specific prohibition of his continuing further work in the German Communist Party. Cover of Gegen den Strom, official publication of the \\"Brandlerite\\" Communist Party of Germany (Opposition). =Expulsion and communist oppositional activities= In the fall of 1928 an event (Wittorf affair) took place in the Communist Party of Germany which ultimately led to the final break of Brandler and Thalheimer and their supporters. The secretary of the Hamburg organization of the KPD was found to have embezzled 2,000 marks from the party treasury for his own use. When accountants from national party headquarters discovered the crime, they had been threatened with expulsion from the party by party leader Thaelmann if they exposed the theft. The Comintern got wind of the scandal which led to a crisis in the German party with the Central Committee acting to remove Thaelmann, with Thaelmann joining in the unanimous vote.Alexander, The Right Opposition, pg. 136. This presented a threat to the faction of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union headed by Joseph Stalin, who saw in Thaelmann a reliable ally during a time of bitter factional warfare. As a result, the Presidium of the Comintern countermanded the German Central Committee's action, restoring Thaelmann as secretary. In October 1928 Brandler returned to Germany against the KPD's wishes. The corruption of Thaelmann's Hamburg organization and its protection by the Stalin faction in Moscow was used as a pretext for Brandler and Thalheimer to issue a call for a meeting of their followers on November 11, 1928.The gathering was to be held on December 30, 1928. The Comintern, predictably, reacted with fury. Brandler, Thalheimer, and their associates were bitterly criticized in an open letter from the Comintern on December 19, 1928. Expulsion soon followed, with both Brandler and Thalheimer removed from the Communist Parties of Germany in December 1928 and from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Communist International in January 1929. Brandler and Thalheimer gathered their supporters into a new organization called the Communist Party of Germany (Opposition) (KPO), a group which was founded at the December 30, 1928 meeting which had originally prompted the wave of expulsions. The group also launched a new communist opposition journal, Gegen den Strom (Against the Current). Throughout 1929 the KPD expelled followers of Brandler and Thalheimer, as well as so-called \\"conciliators\\" who sought a factional truce between the party's feuding Left and Right. Perhaps 1,000 members of the Communist Party of Germany were affected.Alexander, The Right Opposition, pg. 140. These expulsions paralleled similar efforts to purge the Russian Communist Party of followers of Nikolai Bukharin, Alexei Rykov, and Mikhail Tomsky. The KPO initially conceived of itself as a factional influence group, attempting to change the political line of the Communist Party of Germany rather than a new party in competition with it. The organization held a second conference in November 1929 at which it, in the words of M.N. Roy, \\"declared unequivocally that between Social Democracy and Communism there is no half-way house.\\"M.N. Roy in The Revolutionary Age [New York], December 1, 1929, pg. 16; cited in Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 140. Roy claimed that the KPO had 6,000 dues-paying members and was publishing eight weekly and bi-monthly publications by the fall of 1929, with a combined circulation of 25,000. Brandler was named Secretary of the organization at this time. While the group never met with broad influence or electoral success, it nevertheless became the first as well as one of the most prominent parties to be identified with the so-called \\"International Right Opposition.\\" On January 1, 1930, the KPO attempted to expand its influence even further with the launch of a daily newspaper, Arbeiterpolitek. Financial problems led it a reduction of frequency, however, and by 1932 the paper was being issued only once a week. Despite Roy's protestations that the KPO did not constitute an independent political party, it was not long before it had entered the field with its own candidates for office. It ran its own candidates in the December 7, 1929 provincial election in Thuringia, one of the organization's strongholds, although these garnered only 12,000 votes.Alexander, The Right Opposition, pg. 141. In other elections, it supported the slate of candidates of the official Communist Party of Germany, including the candidacy of Ernst Thaelmann for President in the election of March 1932. Brandler and the KPO were strongly in favor of the establishment of a united front against the menace of Nazism and were particularly critical of the Communist Party's conception that \\"once the Nazis get into power, then will the united front of the proletariat rise and brush them aside.\\"Statement in Rote Fahne (Red Flag), official organ of the KPD, October 16, 1931, cited in Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 142. Instead, the KPO called for the immediate formation of a broad anti-fascist alliance including the Social Democratic-controlled trade union federation, the Social Democrats, Communists, and the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany.Alexander, The Right Opposition,\\" pg. 143. Following the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and his ultra-nationalist National Socialist German Workers Party on January 30, 1933 and the wave of repression which ensued, Brandler and most of the KPO leadership fled to France. Brandler lived in Paris until the beginning of World War II, where he continued to be involved in communist politics. In 1939 and 1940, Brandler was temporarily interned by the Vichy government and was sent to prison in the south of France. Brandler and Thalheimer fled to Cuba to avoid greater repercussions in 1941. After Thalheimer's death in 1948, Brandler left Cuba for the United Kingdom, where he attempted to work on writing his memoirs, struggling at the project without success.Isaac Deutscher, \\"Record of a Conversation with Heinrich Brandler, February 15, 1948,\\" New Left Review no. 105 (September‚ÄìOctober 1977). In 1949 he was able to return to West Germany. Brandler became involved in a new radical opposition organization called the Labor Politics Group and served as its president and editor of its journal, Gruppe Arbeiterpolitik (Labor Policy Group), until 1956. Brandler also corresponded extensively with Isaac Deutscher and aided Deutscher's research on German communism and the Right Opposition. =Death and legacy= Heinrich Brandler died on September 26, 1967. He was 86 years old at the time of his death. His organisation Gruppe Arbeiterpolitik exists today as one of the few surviving descendants of the Right Opposition current.

This key is included in the Media Key Block system and is an important part of the content protection process of Blu-ray and HD-DVD contents. What is it used for? The main objective of the Encrypted Title Key is to reinforce the discs‚Äô content security during the decryption process of content stored in the media. The content stored in medias like Blu-ray or HD-DVDs is composed and divided in information units called Titles. The owner of the protected contents, divide this information in the form of one or more Titles. It also provides a license to the player, a series of rules called Usage Rules which will be used later on to decrypt the disc information. To protect the content, the information units are encrypted using encryption keys called Title Keys. To achieve more security and so that the key obtention process cannot be obtained by player without license, the Title Keys are encrypted giving as a result the Encrypted Title Keys. The licensed replicator shall select a secret, random Title Key for each Title to be protected. Each Title Key shall be used to encrypt the content of its corresponding Title, as specified for each supported content format elsewhere in this specification. At the replicator‚Äôs discretion, a given Title may be encrypted using the same Title Key for all instances of pre-recorded media, or different Title Keys may be used for different instances. Decryption Procedure So that the players with license can achieve reading the discs‚Äô content, there are some decryption procedures before achieving the reading. The discs have a volume identifier called VID (Volume ID), the Encrypted Title Key and a decryption key (Media Key Block). Process to obtain the Media key, from the MKB and the Device Keys The players have some keys, according to each model, called Device Keys, which are granted by the AACS organization. In the reproduction moment, one of these keys decrypts the contained MKB in the disc and as a result of this process, the Media Key, is obtained. The Media Key is combined with the VID (Volume ID) and the Volume Unique Key (KVU) is originated so that the decryption of the Encrypted Title Key can finally be done and in consequence the necessary Title Key is obtained to decrypt and reproduce the discs‚Äô content. To codify the Encrypted Title Key, a codification is made following the next formula: AES-128E (Kvu, Kt ‚äï Nonce ‚äï AES_H(Volume ID  title_id)) It is possible to demonstrate, with a simple analysis of the formula, that the result is obtained of a combination between the Volume ID and a Title identifier obtained from the Media Key, giving as a result the Kvu (Volume Unique Key). decrypted AACS process Decryption Problems Although the process of updating all the Title Keys for an application usually takes a very small amount of time (much less than a second), it is a critical time. If the device were to fail during the re- encryption process, the user's content might be lost. To reduce the risk of user loss, recording devices shall begin the reencryption process by renaming the old MKB to a temporary name before writing the new MKB. When the device completes the re-encryption process, it shall delete the temporary MKB. If any recorder discovers a temporary MKB on a piece of media, it is an indication that the encrypted Title Keys might be corrupted. The device shall perform one of the following protocols to recover the corrupted encrypted Title Keys. Which protocol is chosen depends on where the encrypted Title Keys are stored in the particular application. A device re-encrypting Title Keys as a normal result of updating a recordable MKB shall also use these same protocols. These protocols are: \\\\- Recovery Protocol When the Encrypted Title Keys are in a Separate File: In this case, the original recording device shall rename the old encrypted Title Keys to a defined temporary name before beginning to write the new encrypted Title Key File. -Recovery Protocol When the Encrypted Title Keys are in the Content File: In the extreme case, each content file contains its own encrypted Title Key. In that case, it is not likely that there is a temporary version of the encrypted Title Keys. Where is it located? Components localization in the disc media The Encrypted Title Keys are located in the Blu-ray and HD-DVDs where there is content to reproduce by the player with license. The information stored in the discs is found divided in three different parts: Reading/Writing area, read-only area and protected area. The Encrypted Title Keys are found in the Reading/Writing area with the Media Key Block, the Usage Rules and the encrypted content.

A tributary of the Grande Ronde River, it is the second-longest stream in the Grande Ronde Valley. Originating in the foothills of the Wallowa Mountains, it flows generally northwest through Catherine Creek State Park and the city of Union before joining the river. The creek was named for Catherine Godley, a daughter of Thomas and M. E. Godley, who settled near Union in the 19th century. A former variant name for the stream on some maps was Ladd Creek. However, Ladd Creek on more recent maps is a stream flowing generally northeast from hills southeast of La Grande through the Ladd Marsh Game Management Area, joining Gekeler Slough before entering Catherine Creek. Little Creek, a tributary of Catherine Creek, was formerly called Julianna Creek for the Godleys' other daughter. Course Catherine Creek, flowing entirely within Union County, begins at the confluence of North Fork Catherine Creek and South Fork Catherine Creek in the Wallowa‚ÄìWhitman National Forest. Running generally northwest from the foothills of the Wallowa Mountains along Oregon Route 203, the creek receives Scout and Milk creeks from the left, then Little Catherine Creek from the right before entering Catherine Creek State Park. Continuing northwest through the city of Union, the creek receives Pyles Creek from the left and Little Creek from the right before turning away from the highway. Meandering north across the Grande Ronde Valley, the creek receives Ladd Creek (below its confluence with Gekeler Slough) and McAlister Slough, both from the left, and Mill Creek from the right before entering the Grande Ronde River west of Cove. The larger stream is a tributary of the Snake River. Recreation Catherine Creek is open for catch-and-release fishing for wild steelhead downstream of the Highway 203 bridge above Catherine Creek State Park. Chinook salmon frequent the creek and its forks where they flow through the national forest to about upstream of the state park, but they and the resident bull trout in these streams are protected from fishing. Small wild rainbow trout also inhabit the upper creek and its forks. Catherine Creek State Park, about from Union, has a public campground, and camping is also permitted at a site in the national forest. The campground at the state park is open from mid-April through October. The park also has picnic areas, restrooms, horseshoe pits, and hiking trails.

Neurotransmitters released from the terminals of a presynaptic neuron fall under one of two categories, depending on the ion channels gated or modulated by the neurotransmitter receptor. Excitatory neurotransmitters produce depolarization of the postsynaptic cell, whereas the hyperpolarization produced by an inhibitory neurotransmitter will mitigate the effects of an excitatory neurotransmitter. This depolarization is called an EPSP, or an excitatory postsynaptic potential, and the hyperpolarization is called an IPSP, or an inhibitory postsynaptic potential. The only influences that neurons can have on one another are excitation, inhibition, and‚Äîthrough modulatory transmitters‚Äîbiasing one another's excitability. From such a small set of basic interactions, a chain of neurons can produce only a limited response. A pathway can be facilitated by excitatory input; removal of such input constitutes disfacillitation. A pathway may also be inhibited; removal of inhibitory input constitutes disinhibition, which, if other sources of excitation are present in the inhibitory input, can augment excitation. When a given target neuron receives inputs from multiple sources, those inputs can be spatially summated if the inputs arrive closely enough in time that the influence of the earliest-arriving inputs has not yet decayed. If a target neuron receives input from a single axon terminal and that input occurs repeatedly at short intervals, the inputs can summate temporally. History The nervous system first began to be encompassed within the scope of general physiological studies in the late 1800s, when Charles Sherrington began to test neurons' electrical properties. His main contributions to neurophysiology involved the study of the knee-jerk reflex and the inferences he made between the two reciprocal forces of excitation and inhibition. He postulated that the site where this modulatory response occurs is the intercellular space of a unidirectional pathway of neural circuits. He first introduced the possible role of evolution and neural inhibition with his suggestion that ‚Äúhigher centers of the brain inhibit the excitatory functions of the lower centers‚Äù. Much of today's knowledge of chemical synaptic transmission was gleaned from experiments analyzing the effects of acetylcholine release at neuromuscular junctions, also called end plates. The pioneers in this area included Bernard Katz and Alan Hodgkin, who used the squid giant axon as an experimental model for the study of the nervous system. The relatively large size of the neurons allowed the use of finely-tipped electrodes to monitor the electrophysiological changes that fluctuate across the membrane. In 1941 Katz's implementation of microelectrodes in the gastrocnemius sciatic nerve of frogs‚Äô legs illuminated the field. It soon became generalized that the end- plate potential (EPP) alone is what triggers the muscle action potential, which is manifested through contractions of the frog legs. One of Katz's seminal findings, in studies carried out with Paul Fatt in 1951, was that spontaneous changes in the potential of muscle-cell membrane occur even without the stimulation of the presynaptic motor neuron. These spikes in potential are similar to action potentials except that they are much smaller, typically less than 1 mV; they were thus called miniature end plate potentials (MEPPs). In 1954, the introduction of the first electron microscopic images of postsynaptic terminals revealed that these MEPPs were created by synaptic vesicles carrying neurotransmitters. The sporadic nature of the release of quantal amounts of neurotransmitter led to the \\"vesicle hypothesis\\" of Katz and del Castillo, which attributes quantization of transmitter release to its association with synaptic vesicles. This also indicated to Katz that action potential generation can be triggered by the summation of these individual units, each equivalent to an MEPP. Types A diagram of temporal summation. At any given moment, a neuron may receive postsynaptic potentials from thousands of other neurons. Whether threshold is reached, and an action potential generated, depends upon the spatial (i.e. from multiple neurons) and temporal (from a single neuron) summation of all inputs at that moment. It is traditionally thought that the closer a synapse is to the neuron's cell body, the greater its influence on the final summation. This is because postsynaptic potentials travel through dendrites which contain a low concentration of voltage-gated ion channels. Therefore, the postsynaptic potential attenuates by the time it reaches the neuron cell body. The neuron cell body acts as a computer by integrating (adding or summing up) the incoming potentials. The net potential is then transmitted to the axon hillock, where the action potential is initiated. Another factor that should be considered is the summation of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs. The spatial summation of an inhibitory input will nullify an excitatory input. This widely observed effect is called inhibitory 'shunting' of EPSPs. =Spatial summation= Spatial summation is a mechanism of eliciting an action potential in a neuron with input from multiple presynaptic cells. It is the algebraic summing of potentials from different areas of input, usually on the dendrites. Summation of excitatory postsynaptic potentials increases the probability that the potential will reach the threshold potential and generate an action potential, whereas summation of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials can prevent the cell from achieving an action potential. The closer the dendritic input is to the axon hillock, the more the potential will influence the probability of the firing of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. =Temporal summation= Temporal summation occurs when a high frequency of action potentials in the presynaptic neuron elicits postsynaptic potentials that summate with each other. The duration of a postsynaptic potential is longer than the interval between action potentials. If the time constant of the cell membrane is sufficiently long, as is the case for the cell body, then the amount of summation is increased. The amplitude of one postsynaptic potential at the time point when the next one begins will algebraically summate with it, generating a larger potential than the individual potentials. This allows the membrane potential to reach the threshold to generate an action potential. Mechanism Neurotransmitters bind to receptors which open or close ion channels in the postsynaptic cell creating postsynaptic potentials (PSPs). These potentials alter the chances of an action potential occurring in a postsynaptic neuron. PSPs are deemed excitatory if they increase the probability that an action potential will occur, and inhibitory if they decrease the chances. =Glutamate as an excitatory example= The neurotransmitter glutamate, for example, is predominantly known to trigger excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in vertebrates. Experimental manipulation can cause the release of the glutamate through the non-tetanic stimulation of a presynaptic neuron. Glutamate then binds to AMPA receptors contained in the postsynaptic membrane causing the influx of positively charged sodium atoms. This inward flow of sodium leads to a short term depolarization of the postsynaptic neuron and an EPSP. While a single depolarization of this kind may not have much of an effect on the postsynaptic neuron, repeated depolarizations caused by high frequency stimulation can lead to EPSP summation and to surpassing the threshold potential. =GABA as an inhibitory example= In contrast to glutamate, the neurotransmitter GABA mainly functions to trigger inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in vertebrates. The binding of GABA to a postsynaptic receptor causes the opening of ion channels that either cause an influx of negatively charged chloride ions into the cell or an efflux of positively charged potassium ions out of the cell. The effect of these two options is the hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell, or IPSP. Summation with other IPSPs and contrasting EPSPs determines whether the postsynaptic potential will reach threshold and cause an action potential to fire in the postsynaptic neuron. EPSP and depolarization As long as the membrane potential is below threshold for firing impulses, the membrane potential can summate inputs. That is, if the neurotransmitter at one synapse causes a small depolarization, a simultaneous release of transmitter at another synapse located elsewhere on the same cell body will summate to cause a larger depolarization. This is called spatial summation and is complemented by temporal summation, wherein successive releases of transmitter from one synapse will cause progressive polarization change as long as the presynaptic changes occur faster than the decay rate of the membrane potential changes in the postsynaptic neuron. Neurotransmitter effects last several times longer than presynaptic impulses, and thereby allow summation of effect. Thus, the EPSP differs from action potentials in a fundamental way: it summates inputs and expresses a graded response, as opposed to the all-or-none response of impulse discharge. IPSP and hyperpolarization At the same time that a given postsynaptic neuron is receiving and summating excitatory neurotransmitter, it may also be receiving conflicting messages that are telling it to shut down firing. These inhibitory influences (IPSPs) are mediated by inhibitory neurotransmitter systems that cause postsynaptic membranes to hyperpolarize. Such effects are generally attributed to the opening of selective ion channels that allow either intracellular potassium to leave the postsynaptic cell or to allow extracellular chloride to enter. In either case, the net effect is to add to the intracellular negativity and move the membrane potential farther away from the threshold for generating impulses. EPSPs, IPSPs, and algebraic processing When EPSPs and IPSPs are generated simultaneously in the same cell, the output response will be determined by the relative strengths of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Output instructions are thus determined by this algebraic processing of information. Because the discharge threshold across a synapse is a function of the presynaptic volleys that act upon it, and because a given neuron may receive branches from many axons, the passage of impulses in a network of such synapses can be highly varied. The versatility of the synapse arises from its ability to modify information by algebraically summing input signals. The subsequent change in stimulation threshold of the postsynaptic membrane can be enhanced or inhibited, depending on the transmitter chemical involved and the ion permeabilities. Thus the synapse acts as a decision point at which information converges, and it is modified by algebraic processing of EPSPs and IPSPs. In addition to the IPSP inhibitory mechanism, there is a presynaptic kind of inhibition that involves either a hyperpolarization on the inhibited axon or a persistent depolarization; whether it is the former or the latter depends on the specific neurons involved. Current research The microelectrodes used by Katz and his contemporaries pale in comparison to the technologically advanced recording techniques available today. Spatial summation began to receive a lot of research attention when techniques were developed that allowed the simultaneous recording of multiple loci on a dendritic tree. A lot of experiments involve the use of sensory neurons, especially optical neurons, because they are constantly incorporating a ranging frequency of both inhibitory and excitatory inputs. Modern studies of neural summation focus on the attenuation of postsynaptic potentials on the dendrites and the cell body of a neuron. These interactions are said to be nonlinear, because the response is less than the sum of the individual responses. Sometimes this can be due to a phenomenon caused by inhibition called shunting, which is the decreased conductance of excitatory postsynaptic potentials. Shunting inhibition is exhibited in the work of Michael Ariel and Naoki Kogo, who experimented with whole cell recording on the turtle basal optic nucleus. Their work showed that spatial summation of excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials caused attenuation of the excitatory response during the inhibitory response most of the time. They also noted a temporary augmentation of the excitatory response occurring after the attenuation. As a control they tested for attenuation when voltage-sensitive channels were activated by a hyperpolarization current. They concluded that attenuation is not caused by hyperpolarization but by an opening of synaptic receptor channels causing conductance variations. =Potential therapeutic applications= Regarding nociceptive stimulation, spatial summation is the ability to integrate painful input from large areas while temporal summation refers to the ability of integrating repetitive nociceptive stimuli. Widespread and long lasting pain are characteristics of many chronic pain syndromes. This suggests that both spatial and temporal summations are important in chronic pain conditions. Indeed, through pressure stimulation experiments, it has been shown that spatial summation facilitates temporal summation of nociceptive inputs, specifically pressure pain. Therefore, targeting both spatial and temporal summation mechanisms simultaneously can benefit treatment of chronic pain conditions.

Her mother had been a professional singer before her marriage; her father was a comedian, singer and dancer. He toured extensively (including to Great Britain and France) in the role of the Scarecrow in a stage production of The Wizard of Oz and was a star of the Orpheum Circuit. He wrote his own material for his vaudeville act, and in the 1920s wrote comedy bits for Broadway shows as well. Aviation career =Early flying experience= In 1918, at the age of six, along with her brother Joe, she took her first plane ride in a Farman pusher that took off from a potato patch near Hicksville on Long Island. She immediately fell in love with flying, and took numerous rides that summer with the same French pilot, Louis Gaubert. At age 10 she began receiving flying lessons from Clyde Pangborn who tied blocks to the rudder pedals so Elinor‚Äôs feet could reach.Tami Lewis Brown, Soar, Elinor!, Farrar, Straus & Giroux (2010), She received further lessons from Frederick Melvin Lund, who piloted her father around the country on the vaudeville circuit and was teaching him to fly as well, and from Bert Acosta. Her father bought a Waco 9 and hired \\"Red\\" Devereaux as a pilot and flight instructor for both of them. However, during that time her father directed the instructors to not let her take off or land, because he was concerned for her safety. This prohibition was finally lifted by her mother while her father was out of town, and after ten days of intense instruction from Russ Holderman, she soloed for the first time at age 16. She began taking her father's Waco 9 up to higher altitudes than anyone had ever taken such a plane. (She later wrote in her memoir, \\"I had no business fooling around up there without oxygen‚Äîand I knew it.\\") Word got around, and it was arranged for her to get a F√©d√©ration A√©ronautique Internationale (FAI) license and an FAI-certified barograph. Orville Wright finalized her FAI license, and three months after her first solo, she set an official light plane altitude record of in the Waco 9. In September 1927, at 16, she became the youngest U.S.-government-licensed pilot on record. =Stunt flying under New York bridges= To this point, her family had kept publicity to a minimum, to allow her to hone her flying skills without the distraction of public attention. This changed in October 1928; on a dare, she flew a Waco 10 under all four of New York City's East River bridges; according to the Cradle of Aviation Museum, she is the only person to do so.Phyllis R. Moses (op. cit.) says she was the first person to do so. An October 22, 1928 report in The New York Times describes her only as the first woman to do so, but does not name any man who might have done this previously. The page about her on the web site of the Cradle of Aviation Museum says she is the only person ever to do this. In her memoir () she accounts herself the only person to do this in a land plane, but indicates that it was reasonably routine for seaplanes to go under the bridges. By her own account at the time, she first reconnoitered the route from above the bridges; nonetheless, she had to dodge several ships. Although she did not know it in advance, newsreel crews were there to film her at each bridge; the Curtiss Field regulars had been betting on whether she could really do it, and those who were betting on her side had alerted the media so that there would be clear evidence on film that it was, indeed, her at the controls of the plane. By her own account, the only sanction she received for the unauthorized stunt was a 10-day \\"grounding\\" by the city of New York, with Mayor James J. Walker interceding on her behalf to prevent any actual suspension of her license by the United States Department of Commerce. A request for Elinor‚Äôs autograph accompanied the Department‚Äôs letter of reprimand. Tom D. Crouch writes that she had her license suspended for 15 days. In any case, the stunt and her devil-may-care attitude made her a celebrity and helped to win her the \\"Flying Flapper\\" nickname.Tom D. Crouch, Wings: A History of Aviation from Kites to the Space Age, W.W. Norton, , p. 282. =Breaking records= Endurance records Numerous other feats followed close on. Until late 1928, there was no established women's flying endurance record; Smith decided to establish one, but was beaten to it. On December 20, Viola Gentry flew for eight hours, six minutes. As far as Smith was concerned, all that did was to establish a tangible target, one that Red Devereaux said Smith could break \\"standing on [her] head.\\" However, before Smith could finish her preparations, on January 2, 1929, Evelyn \\"Bobbi\\" Trout, flying in California, upped the record to 12 hours. Under FAI rules, endurance records had to be broken by a full hour. In late January 1929, it became clear that Gentry was ready to have another go at the record.\\"Girl Flier, 17, Sets Woman's Duration Mark; Remains in the Air 13 Hours 17 Minutes\\", The New York Times, January 31, 1929. p. 1. In the depths of a rough New York winter, Smith judged that Roosevelt Field was in no state for a heavily loaded takeoff. With some difficulty, she obtained permission to use the military's nearby Mitchel Field. On January 30, flying an open cockpit Bruner Winkle biplane on a day when the temperature was , Smith set a women's solo endurance record of 13¬Ω hours. Her plan was to fly through the night and land in daylight: unbeknownst to those around her, although she had often landed at dusk she had never done a true night landing before. However, the effect of the cold on both her body and that of her aircraft forced her down early. By her own account, she managed to land with a heavy remaining load of fuel only due to the good fortune of being able to follow in Jimmy Doolittle, who had seen her fire her V√©ry pistol. No one on the ground had seen the flare, so the runway lights had not been turned on. Upon landing she promised herself \\"never again to display this blend of incompetence and arrogance.\\"; the \\"incompetence and arrogance\\" quotation is on p. 84. The next day, Gentry crashed on takeoff while attempting to better Smith's achievement; Gentry was unharmed, but her plane was damaged. Bobbi Trout took back the endurance record with a 17-hour flight on February 10‚Äì11,\\"Miss Trout Sets Mark With 17-Hour Flight; Recaptures Record Miss Smith Took From Her\\", The New York Times, February 12, 1929. p. 1. but three months later, in April 1929, Smith smashed that record, soloing 26¬Ω hours in a Bellanca CH monoplane. That flight also made her the first woman ever to pilot such a large and powerful aircraft. Speed record The following month she set a woman's world speed record of in a Curtiss military aircraft. In June 1929 the parachute-maker Irving Parachute Company, hired her to tour the United States, flying a Bellanca Pacemaker on a tour, making the 18-year-old Smith the first female Executive Pilot. On this tour, at the air races in Cleveland, Ohio, she was the pilot for an unprecedented seven-man parachute drop. Endurance with mid-air refueling Also in 1929, flying out of Metropolitan Airport (now Van Nuys Airport) in Los Angeles, she and Bobbi Trout (who functioned as co-pilot) set the first official women's record for endurance with mid-air refueling. They were aloft 42¬Ω hours in a Sunbeam biplane powered by a 300-horsepower J-6 Wright engine. Smith did the contact flying while Trout handled the fueling hoses.Douglas Martin, \\"Evelyn Trout, Record-Setting Flier, Dies at 97\\" (obituary), The New York Times, February 2, 2003, p. 142.; p. 194 for this being the first establishment of such a record. Their refueling craft, a Curtiss Pigeon with a Liberty L-12 engine, was piloted by Paul Whittier with Pete Reinhart handling the hose. Smith and Trout were hoping for a record of at least 100 hours, and shooting for 164 hours (nearly a week), but this was not to be. The two craft were not terribly well suited to the task at hand. The Pigeon was chosen for its large cargo capacity to carry fuel, but it was an outdated aircraft with a temperamental engine for which spare parts were not easily obtained. In refueling position, the Pigeon's pilot could not see the Sunbeam at all, so there was no way to signal about any engine problems that would mean sudden loss of altitude. The Sunbeam was not a notably stable aircraft; in Smith's words, \\"it had to be flown every single minute with the concentration of a test flight.\\" Furthermore, the two craft were mismatched in terms of velocity: whenever they were refueling, the Pigeon had to fly near its top speed while the Sunbeam slowed down to just above its stalling speed.. The \\"concentration of a test flight\\" quotation is on p. 182. The first attempt at the record nearly ended in disaster around the 12-hour mark. During refueling near Catalina Island, sudden turbulence wrested the hose from Trout's hands, covering her in airplane fuel, while at the other end of the hose Reinhart was left bleeding from cuts. Both planes made it successfully back to Metropolitan Airport, and no one was seriously hurt. A series of additional attempts lasted between 10 and 18 hours; the weak link each time was keeping the Pigeon's engine running. Finally, in late November 1929, with the rainy season approaching, enough of the right factors fell into place to allow them to set a meaningful record, albeit a more modest one than they hoped for. The Sunbeam flew better than usual; the Pigeon's Liberty engine made it through 36 hours, although when it did fail it was dramatic, and forced the refueling craft into an emergency landing with its hose trailing. Smith and Trout flew the Sunbeam nearly dry, stretching their flight out to exactly 42¬Ω hours. Altitude record In March 1930 she added almost to the world altitude record, flying to a height of . Her articulate performance in an NBC broadcast interview after that flight won her a position as a broadcaster covering the world of aviation, including live broadcasts from air shows and interviews with other prominent aviators. passim. In May 1930, still before her 19th birthday, she became the youngest pilot ever granted a Transport License by the U.S. Department of Commerce. In October 1930 a poll of licensed pilots selected her as the \\"Best Woman Pilot in America\\". In March 1931, flying out of Roosevelt Field on Long Island, she attempted to set the world altitude record, again flying a 6-seater Bellanca with a turbocharged 575 hp P&W; Wasp R-1340-23 on two attempts. Her altitude of on the second flight gave her back the women's record, and demonstrated the over-the-weather capability of the Bellanca, but fell just short of the overall world record. The first flight nearly ended in calamity. At the engine died, and as she was trying to restart it, she lost consciousness (unbeknownst to her, the lead-encased oxygen bottle that she was wearing around her neck had cracked, allowing its content to leak out). The fuel line had probably frozen, and after she lost consciousness the now-powerless airplane went into a steep dive. Smith regained consciousness and began a cautious pullout at about , and managed to guide the plane to an open spot in a housing development, nosing it over during the landing.\\"Miss Smith in Faint Sets Altitude Mark; Girl Flier Loses Consciousness When More Than 30,000 Feet Up, a Record for Women.

For the second attempt ten days later, six upper wing ribs were replaced, the bent propeller was straightened, and another engine was installed (since the company was not sure why the first engine had quit). She ascended to 34,800 feet indicated on her altimeter. However, the barograph cylinder on her recording instrument had stuck at 28,000 feet, destroying hope of an official world's record.Elinor Smith, Off the Record, Air & Space/Smithsonian, Vol. 6, No. 6 (February/March 1992), pp. 24-26 =Later years= The Great Depression scrubbed her hopes of a non-stop solo trans- Atlantic flight in a Lockheed Vega, though she continued for several years to be a prominent stunt flyer, performing numerous fund-raisers for the homeless and needy. In 1934, Smith became the third person‚Äîand first woman‚Äîto be pictured on a Wheaties box. Smith married New York State legislator and attorney Patrick H. Sullivan, nephew of Tammany leader Timothy \\"Big Tim\\" Sullivan. She kept flying for a while after their 1933 marriage, but once she had a child she retired from flying and spent over 20 years as a suburban housewife, ultimately bearing and raising four children. Patrick Sullivan died in 1956, and Elinor Smith returned to the air. Her membership in the Air Force Association allowed her to pilot the Lockheed T-33 jet trainer and to take up C-119s for paratroop maneuvers. In March 2000 at the Ames Research Center, Moffett Federal Airfield, California, as the pilot with an all-woman crew, she took on NASA's Space Shuttle vertical motion simulator, and became the oldest pilot to succeed in a simulated shuttle landing. In April 2001, at the age of 89, she flew an experimental C33 Raytheon AGATE, Beech Bonanza at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia. Smith died on March 19, 2010, in Palo Alto, California. In Popular Culture In the documentary Obit, the lone keeper of the New York Times' morgue files shows off an \\"advance\\" obituary prepared in 1931 for Smith, who the Times believed might die in a plane crash. When she died in 2010, age 98, her advance informed the obit desk almost 80 years after it was written. References Bibliography * Further reading *Brown, Tami Lewis. Soar, Elinor!

Differences from estate sales The main differences between an estate liquidation and a mere estate sale is the sphere of inclusion which in a liquidation can expand to stocks, bonds, real property, fine jewelry, coin collections and fine art. Often an estate liquidation is accompanied by realtors, attorneys, Certified Public Accountants, and appraisers, while an estate sale can be done by anyone with knowledge of value of household items and collectibles in question. Forms of estate liquidation Besides estate sales, liquidating the estate may be done in the form of an auction or the estate liquidator will offer a cash buy-out for the entire contents of a home.

Gerlach is also Associate Editor of the Journal of Genocide Research and author of multiple books dealing with the Hunger Plan, Holocaust and genocide. Writings His books include \\"Krieg, Ern√§hrung, Volkermord: Forschungen zur Deutschen Vernichtungspolitik im Zweiten Weltkrieg\\" (1998); \\"Kalkulierte Morde: die Deutsche Wirtschafts- und Vernichtungspolitik in Weissrussland 1941 bis 1944\\" (1999); \\"Das letzte Kapitel\\" (co-authored with and G√∂tz Aly in 2002); and \\"Sur la conf√©rence de Wannsee\\" (2002). Ideas Gerlach's article, \\"Extremely Violent Societies: An Alternative to the Concept of Genocide\\" has been the subject of great debate among scholars of genocide and violence. In the article, Gerlach challenges the model utilized in trying to understand genocide. Gerlach has previously stirred intense debate among Holocaust historians with his thesis surrounding December 12, 1941 as the date on which Adolf Hitler made the decision to annihilate the Jews of Europe. Gerlach is also known by his critical attitude towards the national conservative resistance in Nazi Germany. According to Gerlach, the resistance offered by officers such as Claus von Stauffenberg and Henning von Tresckow, who were responsible for the assassination attempt on Hitler on 20 July 1944, was insincere and, in fact, Tresckow and many other resistance fighters were heavily implicated in national socialist war crimes Christian Gerlach, \\"Men of 20 July and the War in the Soviet Union\\", in War of extermination: the German military in World War II, 1941-1944 / edited by Hannes Heer and Klaus Naumann, New York : Berghahn Books, c2000. Gerlach's thesis was criticized by a number of scholars, among them Peter Hoffmann from McGill University and Klaus Jochen Arnold, from the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung, a political party foundation associated with the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU).Peter Hoffmann, Carl Goerdeler and the Jewish question, 1933-1942, Cambridge ; New York : Cambridge University Press, 2011, xvi. Klaus Jochen Arnold, Verbrecher aus eigener Initiative? Der 20. Juli 1944 und die Thesen Christian Gerlachs Other historians agree with Gerlach's findings. For example, the research by , a historian at the Institute for Contemporary History in Munich, confirms the culpability of the staff of Army Group Center in war crimes and Nazi atrocities. In his work, \\"Auf dem Weg zur Militaeropposition: Tresckow, Gersdoff, der Vernichtungskrieg und der Judenmord\\" (\\"Resistance in the Military: Tresckow, Gersdoff, the War of Extermination and the Murder of Jews\\"), Huerter analyzes documents on the relationship of Army Group Centre with the Einsatzgruppe B in 1941. He concludes that Tresckow and his circle of conspirators within the Army Group Center were well informed about the mass murder of Jews following Operation Barbarossa and provided required cooperation. Their National-conservative ideology was aligned with the Nazi regime in its anti-Communism, accompanied by racial prejudice against Slavs and Jews. Only when it became apparent that the defeat was imminent, and that Germany would be held responsible for its genocidal policies, did so-called ethical considerations came into play, he finds. In 2011, Danny Orbach, a Harvard based historian, wrote that Gerlach's reading of the sources is highly skewed, and, at times, diametrically opposed to what they actually say. In one case, according to Orbach, Gerlach had falsely paraphrased the memoir of the resistance fighter Colonel Rudolf Christoph Freiherr von Gersdorff, and in another case, quoted misleadingly from an SS document. Hence, Orbach concludes that Gerlach's thesis on the German resistance is highly unreliable.Danny Orbach, \\"Criticism Reconsidered: The German Resistance to Hitler in Critical German Scholarship\\", Journal of Military History 75:2 (April, 2011) References =Citations= =Bibliography= *  External links  * Christian Gerlach in the German National Library catalogue (German) * Curriculum Vitae - Present Position, Education, Books, Awards Swiss historians Swiss male writers Living people Year of birth missing (living people) Historians of the Holocaust ","title":"Christian Gerlach"},{"id":"20705358","text":"Justin Smith is an American actor best known for his roles on The CW drama The Vampire Diaries, the feature film Man Down (film), and the 20th Century Fox hit A Good Day To Die Hard. Growing up in a small town outside of Central Florida, Justin began acting in local and regional theatre, but spent much of his time at his father's fire station. His father was a fourth generation firefighter and Justin had planned to follow in the family legacy until a friend in college convinced him to audition for a local production of Eugene O'Neill's, Long Day's Journey Into Night. He was cast to play Edmund Tyrone and quickly formed a tireless work ethic, switching his focus from fighting fires to studying theatre, much to the skepticism of his family. One of Justin's early film projects took him to Cape Town, South Africa for work on the award-winning South African drama, \\"The Silent Fall\\". Prepping for the film, Justin gained some much appreciated life experience when he spent three weeks training alongside HIV/AIDS patients in some of Cape Town's most prominent clinics and dangerous townships. That experience now continues to inform his humble approach to life and work.

In 1880 he participated on an expedition to the African interior under the leadership of Wilhelm Junker (1840‚Äì1892). The expedition was a continuation of scientific exploration and research began by Georg August Schweinfurth (1836‚Äì1925) several years earlier.

Another name for the game is Tigers and Oxen. It is a hunt game played on a 5x5 square grid with only orthogonal lines. One player plays the three tigers, and the other player plays the twelve oxen. The board is empty in the beginning. Players first drop their pieces onto the board, and then are able to move them. The tigers can capture the oxen by the short leap as in draughts and Alquerque, but the oxen attempt to elude and at the same time hem in the tiger. Sua Ghin Gnua most resembles the tiger hunt games (or tiger games) such as Bagh-Chal, Rimau-rimau, Main Tapal Empat, Catch the Hare, and Adugo since they all use a 5 x 5 square grid. But tiger games technically consist of a standard Alquerque board which is a 5 x 5 square grid with several diagonal lines criss-crossing through it which are completely missing in Sua Ghin Gnua. There are however some variants of Catch the Hare which have missing diagonal lines also. Another game that resembles Sua Ghin Gnua is from Myanmar called Tiger and Buffaloes which is a hunt game consisting of a 4 x 4 square grid with no diagonal lines. Myanmar happens to border Thailand geographically so there might be a historical connection between the two games. Another game from Myanmar is Lay Gwet Kyah that is presumed to be similar to Sua Ghin Gnua. Sua Ghin Gnua was briefly described by Stewart Culin, in his book Chess and Playing Cards: Catalogue of Games and Implements for Divination Exhibited by the United States National Museum in Connection with the Department of Archaeology and Paleontology of the University of Pennsylvania at the Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta, Georgia 1895 (1898). It's also briefly mentioned by H.J.R. Murray in his book A History of Chess (1913). It was also described by R.C. Bell, in his book Board and Table Games from Many Civilizations (1969).  Setup  A 5x5 square grid is used consisting of twenty-five intersection points (here-in-forth referred to as \\"points\\"). The square grid consists only of orthogonal lines, that is, there are no diagonal lines. It is not an Alquerque board. There are three tiger pieces that are black, and twelve oxen pieces that are white. Players decide who will play the tiger, and who will play the oxen. The board is empty in the beginning with each player's pieces set beside the board.  Rules  * Players alternate their turns. * Players first drop their pieces onto the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell unfortunately did not describe in detail how they are dropped onto the board. In some other hunt games, an oxen piece would first be dropped onto any vacant point on the board followed by a tiger piece onto any vacant point on the board, and players would continue in this fashion. Tiger pieces may not be moved or perform captures until all three tigers have been dropped onto the board which takes three turns. Likewise, oxen pieces may not be moved until all twelve oxen pieces have been dropped onto the board which takes twelve turns. Another method that could be employed is the one used in the Myanmar game of Tiger and Buffaloes. Four oxen pieces would be dropped first, followed by a tiger piece. Then four more oxen pieces would be dropped, followed by another tiger piece. Then the remaining four oxen pieces would be dropped, followed by the last tiger piece. * Both tigers and oxen move (in any direction) along a line onto a vacant adjacent point on the board. All lines are orthogonal, therefore, all movements are left, right, forward, and backwards. * Only one oxen may be moved in a turn. Oxen cannot perform a capture. * Only one tiger may be moved or perform a capture exclusively in a turn. * A tiger piece performs a capture by leaping over an adjacent oxen as in the short leap in draughts. The leap must be along an orthogonal line, and the tiger must land on a vacant point on the board immediately beyond the oxen. The leaped oxen is removed from the board. Stewart Culin, H.J.R. Murray, and R.C. Bell do not mention if multiple leaps and captures are allowed, or if captures are compulsory, but in general captures are not compulsory in hunt games. * The three tigers win if they capture enough oxen pieces so that the oxen cannot effectively block their movements. The oxen win if they block the movements of all three tigers.

In addition, she was active in suffragist conventions and activities, known for her participation in the 1913 Suffrage Hike from New York City to Washington, D.C. Born in England, she had immigrated as a child to the United States with her mother and siblings, and lived in her early years in an orphanage. Biography Elisabeth Freeman was born in England in 1876 to Mary Hall Freeman, who was estranged from her husband. Elisabeth was the younger sister of Jane Freeman, who became a notable artist. Elisabeth, her mother, and siblings Clara (Jane) and John moved to the United States, where they lived on Long Island, New York. Mary worked for St. Johnland orphanage, where her children lived for a while. Growing up poor, Elisabeth Freeman gained only a limited education. She was said to have found only her activities for The Salvation Army to be \\"uplifting\\". Freeman moved for a time back to London, where she helped a woman who was beaten by a policeman; both women were arrested after the confrontation. This woman brought Freeman into the suffrage movement, within which she learned the arts of campaigning, including public speaking, media work and recruitment. Having developed such skills in London, Freeman used them after returning to the US, where she was employed by the suffrage movement. Elisabeth Freeman in 1913 A notable example of Freeman's activism occurred in 1913, when she took part in the national Suffrage Hike to the inauguration of President Woodrow Wilson in Washington, D.C. As a publicity stunt for a New York City suffrage march, she wore a gypsy costume and drove a wagon stenciled with 'Votes for Women' slogans and piled with women's suffrage literature. She attended a statewide suffrage convention in Dallas, Texas in May 1916. A crowd of 10,000 witnessed the brutal lynching of Jesse Washington, a young African-American farmhand convicted of murder in Waco, Texas. The NAACP contacted Freeman, hiring her to investigate and report on the murder and events. For a week, claiming to be a reporter, she talked to both African Americans and whites in Waco about the events. Her report on the lynching to W. E. B. Du Bois was used by the NAACP to publicize the case and garner national attention over the outrage of lynching American citizens. Their campaign helped establish the organization as a force for civil rights. In this period the NAACP was based in New York City; it hung banners outside its office publicizing lynchings. Its attorneys became involved in the defense of numerous African Americans in cases across the country. Elizabeth Freeman speaking at NAACP In the years between 1917 and 1919, when the United States was involved in the Great War (World War I) in Europe, Freeman was active for the peace movement. She lobbied Congress and also continued her work fighting for the cause of civil rights. Speaking up against US policies concerning the war generated strong reactions in opposition. Freeman owned an antique store in Provincetown, Massachusetts from 1925 until 1937, when she moved to Pasadena, California for health reasons. She died of pleurisy in February 1942.

In ship design, an inverted bow (occasionally also referred to as reverse bow) is a ship's or large boat's bow whose farthest forward point is not at the top. The result may somewhat resemble a submarine's bow. Inverted bows maximize the length of waterline and hence the hull speed, and have often better hydrodynamic drag than ordinary bows. On the other hand, they have very little reserve buoyancy and tend to dive under waves instead of piercing or going over them. Inverted bows were popular on battleships and large cruisers in the early 20th century. They fell out of favour, as they were very wet at high speeds and in heavy seas, but have made a comeback on modern ship design.

History Cloward and Piven were both professors at the Columbia University School of Social Work. The strategy was outlined in a May 1966 article in the liberal magazine The Nation titled \\"The Weight of the Poor: A Strategy to End Poverty\\". The two stated that many Americans who were eligible for welfare were not receiving benefits, and that a welfare enrollment drive would strain local budgets, precipitating a crisis at the state and local levels that would be a wake-up call for the federal government, particularly the Democratic Party. There would also be side consequences of this strategy, according to Cloward and Piven. These would include: easing the plight of the poor in the short-term (through their participation in the welfare system); shoring up support for the national Democratic Party-then splintered by pluralistic interests (through its cultivation of poor and minority constituencies by implementing a national \\"solution\\" to poverty); and relieving local governments of the financially and politically onerous burdens of public welfare (through a national \\"solution\\" to poverty). Strategy Cloward and Piven's article is focused on forcing the Democratic Party, which in 1966 controlled the presidency and both houses of the United States Congress, to take federal action to help the poor. They stated that full enrollment of those eligible for welfare \\"would produce bureaucratic disruption in welfare agencies and fiscal disruption in local and state governments\\" that would: \\"...deepen existing divisions among elements in the big-city Democratic coalition: the remaining white middle class, the working- class ethnic groups and the growing minority poor. To avoid a further weakening of that historic coalition, a national Democratic administration would be constrained to advance a federal solution to poverty that would override local welfare failures, local class and racial conflicts and local revenue dilemmas.\\"Cloward and Piven, p. 510 They further wrote: Michael Reisch and Janice Andrews wrote that Cloward and Piven \\"proposed to create a crisis in the current welfare system - by exploiting the gap between welfare law and practice - that would ultimately bring about its collapse and replace it with a system of guaranteed annual income. They hoped to accomplish this end by informing the poor of their rights to welfare assistance, encouraging them to apply for benefits and, in effect, overloading an already overburdened bureaucracy.\\" =Focus on Democrats = The authors pinned their hopes on creating disruption within the Democratic Party: > \\"Conservative Republicans are always ready to declaim the evils of public > welfare, and they would probably be the first to raise a hue and cry. But > deeper and politically more telling conflicts would take place within the > Democratic coalition...Whites - both working class ethnic groups and many in > the middle class - would be aroused against the ghetto poor, while liberal > groups, which until recently have been comforted by the notion that the poor > are few... would probably support the movement. Group conflict, spelling > political crisis for the local party apparatus, would thus become acute as > welfare rolls mounted and the strains on local budgets became more > severe.‚ÄùCloward and Piven, p. 516 Reception and criticism Michael Tomasky, writing about the strategy in the 1990s and again in 2011, called it \\"wrongheaded and self-defeating\\", writing: \\"It apparently didn't occur to [Cloward and Piven] that the system would just regard rabble-rousing black people as a phenomenon to be ignored or quashed.\\"Glenn Beck and Fran Piven, Michael Tomasky, Michael Tomasky's Blog, The Guardian, January 24, 2011 Impact of the strategy In papers published in 1971 and 1977,Cloward, Richard; Piven, Frances, \\"Poor People‚Äôs Movements: Why They Succeed, How They Fail\\", Vintage Books, 1978. Cloward and Piven argued that mass unrest in the United States, especially between 1964 and 1969, did lead to a massive expansion of welfare rolls, though not to the guaranteed-income program that they had hoped for. Political scientist Robert Albritton disagreed, writing in 1979 that the data did not support this thesis; he offered an alternative explanation for the rise in welfare caseloads. In his 2006 book Winning the Race, political commentator John McWhorter attributed the rise in the welfare state after the 1960s to the Cloward‚ÄìPiven strategy, but wrote about it negatively, stating that the strategy \\"created generations of black people for whom working for a living is an abstraction\\".McWhorter, John, \\"John McWhorter: How Welfare Went Wrong\\", NPR, August 9, 2006. According to historian Robert E. Weir in 2007: \\"Although the strategy helped to boost recipient numbers between 1966 and 1975, the revolution its proponents envisioned never transpired.\\" See also *Guaranteed minimum income  References  Political terminology of the United States Poverty in the United States ","title":"Cloward‚ÄìPiven strategy"},{"id":"20705821","text":"Acantuerta is a genus of moths of the subfamily Agaristinae of the family Noctuidae.

His areas of interest further include identity and emotions, urban sociology, Muslim migration/immigration, criminology, fundamentalism, secularisation processes, ethnomusicology, and the relationship between anthropological research and cognitive neuroscience. All of these seemingly highly varied topics, however, are linked to his main social anthropological interest: human identity and self. =Singapore= Marranci‚Äôs current research focuses on young Malay Muslims (aged 12‚Äì25) and the issues that they may encounter in contemporary Singapore. Based on participant observation and interviews with male and female residents of welfare homes, parents, educators and organizations, his topic investigates the exposure of young Malays to what he terms as ‚Äòglobal social threats‚Äô and also the effects of a widening generational gap in the context of the recent 2008-2009 economic crisis. =England and Scotland= Between 2004 and 2007, Marranci conducted in-depth research among Muslims in prison ‚Äì the longest study of its kind to date.Aberdeen University Media Release April 12, 2007; Aberdeen University Media Release April 13, 2007; Aberdeen University Media Release June 25, 2007.

Using participant observation as a primary research methodology, Marranci conducted over 170From Times Higher Education April 20, 2007. interviews with current and former Muslim prisoners and their families.Description of methodology taken from Marranci's presentation to the House of Lords, Faith Ideology and Fear: the case of current and former Muslim prisoners This meant taking part in Friday prayers, Islamic lessons, observing imams' activities and spending time with the prisoners in their cells and during their association time ‚Äì at times for up to 10 hours a day. As far as former prisoners are concerned, this has also included living for a short time with the former prisoners' families and following their lives once released from prison. Marranci presented some of his research at the 2007 IQRA Trust Annual Lecture at the House of Lords. His research has also attracted attention from newspapers such as The Guardian, Le Figaro, and Daily Times (Pakistan), among others.Mathaba News Network UK considering setting up Muslim-only jails, says daily July 28, 2007; Islam OnlineUK Radicalizing Muslim Prisoners: Study April 13, 2007; and further news items are listed in the Aberdeen University Media Coverage report. In addition, he has been interviewed for a documentary for the BBC.BBC Radio 4, Today, Monday June 16, 2008 =Northern Ireland= Between 2001 and 2003 Marranci carried out fieldwork among the local Muslim community, primarily in Belfast. His research interests included cultural influences, religious modifications, the concept of ummah, children's education, Muslim associations, community organization, child-parent relationships, identity conflicts, and women. He also studied identity construction among Muslim migrants and their children, proposing an interpretation of the reasons for which Muslims in the West may radicalize or understand jihad as violent struggle. He has published some of this research in Jihad beyond Islam and, along with findings from his research with Muslims in prison, in Understanding Muslim Identity, Rethinking Fundamentalism. =Italy= Between 1999 and 2000, Marranci studied Muslim immigrant women and their daughters in Pisa. His fieldwork centered on family roles, women's associations, diaspora, myth of return, private vs. public, female genital mutilation in immigration contexts and social relationships. =France= Between 1998 and 1999, Marranci conducted fieldwork in both Paris and Lyon with first and second-generation Algerian immigrants, focussing on the use of urban space, identity conflicts, cultural expressions, gender, transnationalism and local and global dimensions.

He became a naturalized U.S. citizen on May 11, 1943. He married Roberta Stevens White in 1933. She died in 1967. He married Florence R. Kluckhohn in 1968. Life and career George Taylor was born in Coventry, England, on December 13, 1905, and received degrees in history and politics from the University of Birmingham before coming to the United States in 1928 on a Commonwealth Fund fellowship. After study at Johns Hopkins University and Harvard University, he studied in Peking from 1930 to 1932 on a fellowship from the Harvard-Yenching Institute. He began his long term interest in the mid 19th century Taiping Rebellion with an article which combined documentary research with social analysis.G.E. Taylor, \\"The Taiping Rebellion,\\" Chinese Social and Political Science Review 16 (1932): 545. From 1933 to 1936, he was professor of international relations at the Central Political Institute in Nanking, then moved to teach at Yenching University in Beiping. While applying social analysis to the problems of the China of his day,George Taylor,\\"The Reconstruction Movement in China.\\" In Holland, William and Kate Mitchell, editors. Problems of the Pacific 1936 (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, [1937]) he was among the group of scholars in Peking who exchanged ideas and advanced the study of Chinese history with new techniques, laying the groundwork for, among other projects the Chinese Dynastic Histories Project organized by Karl August Wittfogel and sponsored by the Institute of Pacific Relations. After war broke out in 1937, Taylor spent the summer of 1938 traveling with the Chinese Communist Eighth Route Army, and smuggled medical supplies to them. These experiences were the basis of his book, The Struggle for North China.George E. Taylor: The Northwest's Expert on Asia and International Trade In 1939 Taylor became chair of the Department of Oriental Studies at the University of Washington, Seattle. He took leave in 1942 to become deputy director of the United States Office of War Information in charge of Pacific operations. Under his leadership the Foreign Morale Analysis Division recruited Clyde Kluckhohn, the Harvard anthropologist, and a team of twenty five others to study Japanese culture in order to formulate policy based on the best understanding. These studies included Ruth Benedict‚Äôs The Chrysanthemum and the Sword. After the war he was director of the Office of War Information at the United States State Department. Among the others who worked for Taylor were John Fairbank, who Taylor later criticized for failing to understand the dangers of Soviet Communism.Biographical Note, George E. Taylor Papers; John King Fairbank, Chinabound: A Fifty-Year Memoir (New York: Harper & Row, 1982): 92 Back in Seattle in 1947, Professor Taylor contended that the decision to drop the atomic bombs on Japan had not been based on all the available evidence. It is essential for the future, he said, that the skills of social scientists be used in the formulation of key decisions. Obituary, The New York Times April 20, 2000 Under his leadership as director, the Far Eastern and Russia Institute was home to scholars such as Wittfogel, Franz H. Michael, Hsiao Kung-ch‚Äôuan, and Chu T‚Äôung-tsu. As the Chinese Communists gained the upper hand in China, Taylor was among the strongest voices condemning American policy and opposing diplomatic recognition of the new government. With his colleagues Wittfogel and Nicholas Poppe, Taylor testified before the McCarran Committee that the scholar and activist Owen Lattimore had acted in the interests of the Soviet Union and had not recognized the danger of Soviet expansionism. In addition to these scholarly and political activities, Taylor co-authored a standard survey text, The Far East in the Modern World, which went through three editions. In the 1960s he was a strong supporter of American policies in the Vietnam War. He retired from the University of Washington in 1969, but turned to the promotion of trade, serving as president of the Washington Council on International Trade from 1976 to 1987.

The modern Maryland Terrapins football program representing the University of Maryland traces its lineage to the team first formed at what was then the Maryland Agricultural College (MAC) in 1892. In the initial years, due to the rudimentary state of intercollegiate athletics and interstate travel, all games were played against local colleges, high schools, and athletic clubs. In 1902, Maryland hired its first professional coach, John Markey, and soon after drafted a \\"football philosophy\\", an early attempt at a codification of college football. During his tenure as head coach from 1911 to 1934, Harry C. \\"Curley\\" Byrd significantly increased Maryland's strength of schedule, and recorded victories over then-powerhouses Penn and Yale. Byrd also greatly increased school support and interest in the sport, and was responsible for the building of the school's first stadium in 1923. Byrd became the university president in 1935, and continued his support for Maryland football from that office. As a coach, he was succeeded by several prominent individuals, namely Clark Shaughnessy, who had perfected the T-formation, and Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, who later went on to great success at Alabama. After just one season at Maryland, a conflict with Byrd resulted in Bryant's departure. The early years: 1892‚Äì1901 =Introduction of football at Maryland= Informally, football and baseball games had been played at the Maryland Agricultural College as early as the time of the Civil War. In 1890, an unofficial school team composed mostly of Maryland Agricultural students saw action against local high schools Laurel and Sandy Spring. It was not officially sanctioned by the college, but was allowed to use the school's name. In 1891, the same team played three games against Gallaudet, Hyattsville, and Sandy Spring. The victory over Sandy Spring prompted the MAC faculty to officially recognize the team.David Ungrady, Tales from the Maryland Terrapins, 2003, pp. 3-4, Sports Publishing LLC. The first official Maryland Agricultural College football team in 1892 In 1892, the first official Maryland Agricultural football team, known as the \\"Aggies\\" or \\"Farmers\\",Rick Snider, Ill will lingers at Navy, Maryland; Rivalry to restart in Crab Bowl, The Washington Times, page 1, 29 August 2005. was formed by quarterback William Skinner, who also served concurrently as the head coach. They went scoreless in that inaugural season with losses to St. John's College, Johns Hopkins, and Episcopal High School. In the game against Episcopal, halfback Pearse \\"Shorty\\" Prough gained the only positive yardage for the team‚Äîafter first running in the wrong direction for 30 yards, before changing course for a net gain of 35 yards. Episcopal's school newspaper, the Monthly Chronicle, stated that the play \\"showed an unaccreditable ignorance of football.\\"Ungrady, p. 5. The following season, in 1893, showed significant improvement. Maryland won all six of its games, including ones against Baltimore City College, St. John's, and Western Maryland. The St. John's match was controversial, however. After the game, St. John's players wrote in the Baltimore American that \\"a decision by which the M.A.C. were allowed to score the only touchdown made by the quarterback after a run of 90 yards, with no one in pursuit, appeared a very doubtful one.\\" At the end of the season, Maryland Agricultural was awarded both the District of Columbia and the state collegiate championships. The awarding of the Maryland state championship, however, was protested by St. John's, which claimed that it was the deserving team. =Formation of the MIFA= William W. Skinner, Maryland's first quarterback and head coach, played an integral role in the formation of the MIFA. In 1894, former coach and quarterback William Skinner helped lead the formation of the Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association (MIFA) in order to improve the process of naming the state champions. Other teams involved included Baltimore City College, Gallaudet, Johns Hopkins, Washington College, and Western Maryland.Ungrady, p. 6.Conference Champions ‚Äì Maryland Intercollegiate Football Association, College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved 16 December 2008.Ted Patterson and Edwin H. Remsberg, Football in Baltimore: History and Memorabilia, p. 39, 2000. The game against St. John's once again aroused controversy, and the MAC accused their opponent of hiring ringers from Lehigh. When Johns Hopkins canceled their game, Maryland arranged to play Georgetown instead. The Maryland team called the game with a 6‚Äì4 lead as darkness fell. However, the referee, Georgetown halfback Mike Mahoney, ruled it a forfeiture and awarded the win to Georgetown. Today, Maryland and Georgetown both count the game as a Maryland Agricultural win in their records.Georgetown Football Records, 2008 Football Media Guide, Georgetown University, 2008, accessed 15 December 2008. =A brief hiatus= In 1895, Maryland Agricultural, a land-grant school with a military curriculum requirement, had a new commandant of cadets take office. Lieutenant Clough Overton, who opposed football at the university, cut funding for equipment and instituted strict rules limiting practice time. Instead of accepting this serious disadvantage against their opponents, the players declined to field a football team for the season.Ungrady, p. 7. The following season, there was a renewal of football at Maryland. Fullback Grenville Lewis was elected as team captain and head coach. He instituted a strict physical training regimen involving calisthenics and long-distance running, and banned smoking, drinking, and eating pie during the football season. This was unpopular with the team, but Lewis was embraced by the students and faculty. In the game to decide the state championship, Maryland Agricultural faced Maryland-Baltimore. Late in the scoreless game, the Aggies pushed to their opponents' two-yard line. With darkness approaching and Maryland Agricultural having difficulty scoring, the referee called the game. It became clear that Maryland-Baltimore had sneaked three extra players onto the field, but the referee refused to award the Aggies the win. Two days later, the Maryland‚ÄìBaltimore players voted to forfeit the game, and with it the championship, to Maryland Agricultural.Ungrady, p. 8‚Äì9. In 1897, Maryland faced Johns Hopkins for the first time since the Aggies' inaugural season. Hopkins beat Maryland handily, 30‚Äì6, and the Aggies went on to lose their next three games to finish the year with a 2‚Äì4 mark. The 1898 season saw the Aggies finish 2‚Äì5‚Äì1 and in 1899, the team canceled the remainder of its season after accumulating a 1‚Äì4 record.Ungrady, p. 9. Maryland saw a marginal improvement to 3‚Äì4‚Äì1 in 1900, but then fell to a 1‚Äì7 season in 1901. The first professional coaches: 1902‚Äì1910 =A football philosophy= D. John Markey was Maryland's first paid football coach and also played on the team. In 1902, Maryland Agricultural paid $300 for its first professional football coach, John Markey. Markey re-instated physical conditioning and incorporated a tackling dummy during practice for the first time at the school. He led Maryland to a 3‚Äì5‚Äì2 record his first season, before improving to 7‚Äì4 in his second year. Markey had not planned to play on the team, but was forced to fill in for a fullback who was intimidated by a death threat from a Georgetown fan. The following year, in the game against Columbian (now The George Washington University), their opponents complained that Markey was a professional. Maryland Agricultural responded with the same accusation against Columbian fullback Granville Church, and the teams came to an agreement to let both play. Markey went on to score the only points of the game in a 6‚Äì0 Maryland Agricultural victory.Ungrady, p. 10. At this time, there was no official regulating body for college sports. The Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States (IAAUS), predecessor to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), was not formed until 1906.The History of the NCAA , National Collegiate Athletic Association, accessed 15 December 2008. Maryland Agricultural attempted to rectify this lack of regulation by writing a \\"philosophy\\" for the sport, which stated in part that it would \\"offer no inducements to any athlete.\\" After his request for a salary increase was rebuffed, Markey coached part-time in 1904. Maryland recorded a 2‚Äì4‚Äì2 record, and he did not return as head coach the following year. Markey was replaced by Fred Nielsen, a former Nebraska halfback.Ungrady, p. 14. =Arrival of Curley Byrd= Under Nielsen in 1905, Harry \\"Curley\\" Byrd began his long career at Maryland. He saw his first action as an end late in the 0‚Äì17 loss to the Naval Academy. Byrd impressed Nielsen enough to earn the starting position for the remainder of the season. He would also play baseball and run track and field at the school, where he set the records for the 50- (5.2 seconds), 100- (10 seconds), and 220-yard (22.3 seconds) dashes. In 1906, Byrd also played as a quarterback, and in 1907, a kicker. Additionally, he assisted with coaching, as head coach Charles Melick and assistant coach Durant Church had other full- time jobs.Ungrady, p. 15. The Curley Byrd era: 1911‚Äì1934 In 1911, Charley Donnelly was the head coach for the first seven games, before stepping down with a 2‚Äì4‚Äì1 record. Due to injuries, Maryland did not have enough players to field a practice squad and turned to local high schools for scrimmages. Curley Byrd was serving as the football coach at one of these high schools and agreed to take the head coaching job at Maryland, his alma mater. Byrd held that position for 24 years, making him the longest-serving football coach in school history. During this time, he developed a unique offensive scheme called the \\"Byrd system\\", which combined elements of the single-wing and double-wing formations.Old Liners Need New Backfield This Season, The Evening Independent, August 30, 1935. He also coached the basketball and baseball teams from 1913 to 1923.Ungrady, p. 15‚Äì18. =Founding of the University of Maryland= The Great Fire of 1912 devastated the Maryland campus. The campus was devastated by a fire in 1912, which deepened the school's grave financial difficulties.The Great Fire, Maryland Agricultural College, 1912, University of Maryland Library Archives, University of Maryland Library, accessed 15 December 2008. In 1916, the state government took full control of the school and renamed it Maryland State College.University of Maryland Timeline , University of Maryland, accessed 14 December 2008. Byrd became the assistant athletic director in 1918 and assisted in the consolidation with the professional colleges in Baltimore, which resulted in the creation of the University of Maryland.Ungrady, p. 16. During this time, the team was referred as 'The Old Liners', most likely in reference to the state nickname.\\"Maryland Terrapins History\\" , College Football History, accessed 16 January 2008. During his tenure, Byrd greatly increased fan and faculty interest and financial support for football at Maryland. Prior to 1912, the team lacked any facilities and its one field left much to be desired. In 1915, Byrd requested funds for the school's first stadium and associated facilities.Ungrady, p. 24. The 1914 state championship-winning Maryland Agricultural football team. In 1913, Maryland Agricultural compiled a 6‚Äì3 record. The team shut-out four Maryland state universities: Johns Hopkins (26‚Äì0), Western Maryland (46‚Äì0), St. John's (13‚Äì0), and Washington College (20‚Äì0). For the feat, Maryland Agricultural won the state championship. In 1914, the MAC tallied a 5‚Äì3 record. In intrastate play, the Farmers recorded wins over Johns Hopkins, St. John's, and Washington College, and a loss to Western Maryland. Once again, the team secured the state championship.Reveille, Maryland Agricultural College Yearbook, Class of 1915, p. 172. The following year, Maryland met Johns Hopkins at Homewood Field on Thanksgiving Day, which drew the venue's all-time record crowd of 13,000 spectators. Hopkins won a hard-fought defensive struggle, 3‚Äì0, and the two teams met on the occasion all but two subsequent years through 1934, the final game of the series.Patterson, p. 41. Jack Faber, who played for Byrd at the time, said that Maryland scheduled games against \\"four or five schools every year we had no right beating.\\"Ungrady, p. 21. Maryland achieved a winning record each season during Byrd's first decade of coaching, from 1911 to 1920. In that period, the team also accumulated a 7‚Äì2‚Äì1 record against arch-rival Johns Hopkins.Patterson, p. 5. The following decade, the team played an increasingly difficult and farther afield schedule. During the 1920s Maryland recorded wins against some of the period's powerhouses: Yale, Rutgers, Princeton, Pennsylvania, Syracuse, Cornell, and North Carolina.Ungrady, p. 23. =Conferences reshuffle= For the 1920 season, Maryland played in the South Atlantic Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SAIAA).Conference Affiliations , Maryland Historical Data, College Football Data Warehouse, retrieved 16 December 2008.Proceedings of the Annual Convention of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (Google Books), National Collegiate Athletic Association, 1921. Meanwhile, members of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA) were locked in a heated debate over whether first-year students should be eligible to play football. The larger schools, in general, were against the practice, and eventually the disagreement resulted in a schism within the SIAA. Eight teams from the SIAA split to form the Southern Conference: Alabama, Auburn, Clemson, Georgia, Georgia Tech, Kentucky, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. They were joined by six non-SIAA members: North Carolina, North Carolina State, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Washington & Lee, and Maryland.Roger Saylor, Southern Intercollegiate Conference 1921‚Äì1932, LA84 Foundation, accessed 15 December 2008. Maryland would remain within the Southern Conference for the next three decades. in-state rival Navy at Griffith Stadium in Washington, D.C.. In 1923, the eponymous stadium, for which Byrd had petitioned funding, was completed at a cost of $60,000 with a maximum capacity of 10,000. That season was also one of Byrd's most successful. He hired former Maryland quarterback and future long-time basketball coach, Burton Shipley, as an assistant coach. The team shutout five of its opponents and held Johns Hopkins and Catholic to just six points apiece, for an overall record of 7‚Äì2‚Äì1. The only losses came at Yale and against Virginia Tech. Maryland led Yale, 14‚Äì12, at halftime, but a referee ruled incomplete a drop kick that Byrd claimed was good by a \\"country mile\\". Yale won the game, 16‚Äì14. Mainly for his performance against Yale and Penn, end Bill \\"Zeke\\" Supplee was named an All-American by the Associated Press. He was the first Maryland player honored as such.Ungrady, p. 26. In 1928, Maryland finished with a 6‚Äì3‚Äì1 record, but tallied wins over \\"three of [its] ancient rivals\\": Johns Hopkins, Yale, and Virginia.Reveille, University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1929, p. 187. That season, Gerald \\"Snitz\\" Snyder became the second Old Liner to be named an All-American, when the Associated Press selected him to their second-team.All- Time Honors (PDF), 2001 Maryland Terrapins Football Media Guide, CBS Sports, retrieved 8 December 2008. In 1933, Byrd spearheaded the adoption of the diamondback terrapin as the official school mascot. He had already renamed the student newspaper The Diamondback in 1921, and the football team was referred to as the \\"Terrapins\\", in addition to the older nicknames, as early as 1928.Reveille, University of Maryland Yearbook, Class of 1928, p. 182. At some point, newspapers shortened the nickname to the \\"Terps\\" in order to abridge headlines. Big-name coaches: 1935‚Äì1946 When Byrd became the university president in 1935,University of Maryland ‚Äì Former President Harry Clifton \\"Curley\\" Byrd, Past Presidents, University of Maryland, accessed 15 December 2008. Jack Faber replaced him as head coach and accumulated a 7‚Äì2‚Äì2 record. The following year, Frank Dobson, former Georgia Tech assistant coach under John Heisman, assumed the head coaching position. After a 6‚Äì5 first season, Dobson led the Terrapins to an 8‚Äì2 record in 1937. The highlight of the season was a 13‚Äì0 shutout of 17th-ranked Syracuse. In the homecoming game, Charlie Weidinger completed a pass to William Bryant for a 13‚Äì7 go-ahead over Florida. The Terrapins' two losses came against Penn and Penn State, the latter being the second game in a rivalry that would bedevil Maryland throughout its entire duration. At the end of the season, Maryland was declared the Southern Conference champions, the team's first major conference title.Year-By-Year Results, 2007 Terrapin Football Record Book, University of Maryland, 2007. The following two years, 1938 and 1939, saw Dobson's teams accumulate 2‚Äì7 records, and he was replaced by Jack Faber. However, Faber did not have much more success, going 2‚Äì6‚Äì1 in 1940 and 3‚Äì5‚Äì1 in 1941. =Shaughnessy's T-formation= In 1942, Clark Shaughnessy was hired as head coach. Shaughnessy had achieved fame at Stanford, where he installed his quarterback-centric version of the T-formation as his primary offensive scheme. In response, Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner had said, \\"If Stanford wins a single game with that crazy formation, you can throw all the football I ever knew in the Pacific Ocean.\\" Stanford, which had gone 1‚Äì7‚Äì1 the previous season, went undefeated in Shaughnessy's first year and earned the number-two ranking in the final AP Poll. Shaughnessy was named 1940 College Coach of the Year for the turnaround performance. Under Shaughnessy, the Terps went 7‚Äì2, with one of the losses a 0‚Äì42 shutout at Duke, which in five seasons had won the Southern Conference three times and been ranked in the AP top-20 four times.Records (PDF), 2008 Duke Football Media Guide, p. 201, 2008, accessed 15 December 2008. After one season, Shaughnessy left Maryland for Pittsburgh. Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant began his long and distinguished coaching career at Maryland. For 1943 and 1944, Clarence Spears was the Maryland head coach. Like Shaughnessy, Spears had taken an underachieving team and turned them around. In 1925, he took over Minnesota, which had posted a 3‚Äì3‚Äì2 record the prior season, and led them to a share of the 1927 Big Ten championship.Year-By-Year Records, Gophersports.com, University of Minnesota Athletics Official Website, accessed 15 December 2008. However, at Maryland, when Spears accumulated a record of 5‚Äì12‚Äì1 after two seasons, he too was replaced. =Bryant's brief stint= In 1945, Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant, who would later go on to achieve legendary status among football coaches, was named the head coach at Maryland. During his first year as a college head coach, Bryant led Maryland to a respectable 6‚Äì2‚Äì1 record, including a last-second win over out-of-state rival Virginia. However, he resigned after just one season, when university president Curley Byrd reinstated a player that Bryant had suspended.B.J. Phillips and Peter Ainslie, Football's Supercoach, Time, p. 4, 29 September 1980, accessed 15 December 2008. In 1946, Clark Shaughnessy returned from Pittsburgh to Maryland for one more season. That year, the Terrapins recorded a 3‚Äì6 season including losses to North Carolina, South Carolina, Michigan State, and N.C. State. After that, Shaughnessy went on to coach the National Football League's Los Angeles Rams in 1948 and 1949.

It was enacted under President Richard Nixon in 1970 as part of the Public Health Service Act. Title X is legally designed to prioritize the needs of low-income families or uninsured people (including those who are not eligible for Medicaid) who might not otherwise have access to these health care services. These services are provided to low- income and uninsured individuals at reduced or no cost.Office of Population Affairs Clearinghouse. ‚ÄúFact Sheet: Title X Family Planning Program.‚Äù January 2008. Its overall purpose is to promote positive birth outcomes and healthy families by allowing individuals to decide the number and spacing of their children. In 2018, the program served 3.9 million people, 87% of them women. Between 2014 and 2019, Title X Family Planning program received $286 million per year. From the start, Title X funds could not be used to support abortion. Nevertheless, in 2019, the regulations were revised, making it harder for clinics that refer women to an abortion provider to receive Title X funds. History The first federal subsidies to help low-income families with birth control came in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty program. By 1969, both Congress and President Richard Nixon supported a bill that will provide adequate Family Planning services. In 1970, the Senate passed Title X unanimously, and the House voted 298 to 32 to pass the bill on to Nixon, who signed it into law. While in 1971 the federal budget for Family Planning was only six million dollar, by 1972 it was almost 62 million. In 1972, Congress passed a bill requiring state's Medicaid program to cover family planning services for low income families. Under this provisions, the federal government covers 90% of the states' expenditures. A third bill was passed in 1975 authorizing a network of family planning centers to be built across the U.S., resulting in almost 4,000 service sites in 2018. Mandate Title X is administered by the Office of Population Affairs (OPA). According to OPA, Title X operates by granting funds to a network of community-based clinics that provide contraceptive services, related counseling, and other preventive health services. Typical grantees include State and local health departments, tribal organizations, hospitals, university health centers, independent clinics, community health centers, faith-based organizations, and various public and private nonprofit entities. In 2018, 99 agencies received Title X funding, supporting almost 4,000 service sites in the U.S., including 8 U.S. territories. OPA estimates that there is at least one clinic receiving Title X funding in 75% of counties in the U.S.U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Population Affairs. ‚ÄúFamily Planning.‚Äù Ten Public Health Service Regional Offices are given the Title X funding and subsequently award regional service and training grant funds through a competitive review process. These offices also monitor program performance. Planned Parenthood clinics and affiliates receive about 60 million annually through the federal programs, serving 40 percent of all Title X patients. According to the CDC, family planning services include contraception to reduce unintended pregnancy, pregnancy testing and counseling, basic infertility services, preconception health care, and sexually transmitted disease (STD) services. services provided by Title X grantees include family planning and provision of contraception, education and counseling, breast and pelvic exams, breast and cervical cancer screening, screenings and treatment for sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV), education about preventing STIs and HIV and counseling for affected patients, referrals to other health care resources, pregnancy diagnosis, and pregnancy counseling. In addition to providing these services, Title X works to improve the overall quality of family planning services offered in the U.S. and help grantees better respond to patient needs. Title X funds training for family planning clinic staff through five national training programs that focus on clinical training; service delivery; management and systems improvement; coordination and strategic initiatives; and quality assurance/improvement and evaluation. Training also emphasizes application of the quality family planning guidelines. Title X also looks to improve the provision of family planning services by engaging in data collection and research of the program and its grantees. Finally, Title X funds also aid in disseminating information and implementing outreach and education activities in communities. Funding Title X is funded every fiscal year by Congressional appropriations. In FY2010, it received approximately $317 million in appropriations and enacted spending. Since then, the appropriated budget has been below $300 million per year, with a $286 million yearly budget between 2014-2019. Title X receives further funding from Medicaid reimbursements and additional federal sources. Combined with Congressional appropriations, these funding sources amount to over half of the operational funds provided to Title X grantees. The remainder of the funding comes from State and local funds, in addition to private sources like insurance and some patient fees. Impact Title X has served millions of people throughout the years; according to HHS estimates, in 2018 alone Title X served 3.9 million family planning clients seen through 6.5 million encounters. Title X program serves mainly low income and young population. In 2015 it has helped reduce teenage pregnancies by 44% and prevented more than 188,000 unintended pregnancies. Without publicly funded family planning services, the number of unintended pregnancies and abortions in the United States would be nearly two-thirds higher among women overall as well as teens; the number of unintended pregnancies among poor women would nearly double. In 2018, Title X funding was used to cover more than 600,000 tests for cervical cancer, more than 800,000 tests for breast cancer, and almost 5 million tests for STDs. The services provided at publicly funded clinics saved the federal and state governments an estimated $5.1 billion in 2008 in short term medical costs. Nationally, every $1.00 invested in helping women avoid unintended pregnancy saved $3.74 in Medicaid expenditures that otherwise would have been needed. According to President Obama's FY2012 proposed budget and the OMB, Title X provides grants to a network of over 4,500 clinics that annually serve over 5 million individuals.The White House Office of Management and Budget. ‚ÄúHelping Women and Girls Win the Future.‚Äù The OPA describes their clientele as racially and ethnically diverse, with most patients in their 20s.https://www.hhs.gov/opa/title-x-family-planning, \\"The majority of clients were in their 20s (51%).\\" Title X mainly serves low- to middle-income women, but has stepped up its efforts to involve men in family planning efforts and the number of male clients is on the rise. In February 2011, a National Public Radio (NPR) article evaluated the impact of Title X. NPR cites a Guttmacher Institute report claiming that Title X grantee clinics serve 15% of women in the U.S. who use contraceptive prescriptions and supplies or get annual contraception check-ups. Furthermore, only five percent of patients served by Title X funding at these clinics came in solely for birth control. Nearly 90% also received preventive gynecological attention, and over 50% were treated for STIs or reproductive tract infections or related conditions.Julie Rovner, National Public Radio. ‚ÄúAt-Risk Federal Funds Cover Far More Than the Pill.‚Äù April 1, 2011. Title X clinics and funding may represent the sole source of health care services for many of their clients. Of the 5.2 million patients served in 2009, 70% were below the federal poverty line and around 66% had no health insurance. In 2006, over 60% of women who received health care services at a Title X clinic identified that as their usual source of health care. Abortion Since its inception, Title X has not directly provided funds for programs that use abortion as a family planning method. At the same time, by preventing unintended pregnancies, Title X has decreased the number of abortions in the United States. Title X grantees and sub-recipients must be in full compliance with Section 1008 of the Title X statute and 42 CFR 59.5(a)(5), which prohibit abortion as a method of family planning. Grantees and sub-recipients must have written policies that clearly indicate that none of the funds will be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning. Additional guidance on this topic can be found in the July 3, 2000, Federal Register Notice entitled Provision of Abortion- Related Services in Family Planning Services Projects, which is available at 65 Fed. Reg. 41281, and the final rule entitled Standards of Compliance for Abortion-Related Services in Family Planning Services Projects, which is available at 65 Fed. Reg. 41270. Despite the broad bipartisan support for Title X in 1970, in 2011 Title X became entangled with the abortion debate, during negotiations about funding for the government's programs, as well as the proposed FY2012 budget. Abortion opponents took issue with Title X since 25% of all Title X money went to Planned Parenthood affiliates, and Planned Parenthood clinics are the nation's biggest private abortion providers. Although Planned Parenthood is prohibited from using federal funds to perform abortions, abortion opponents argue that any money given to Planned Parenthood from Title X frees up more nonfederal money that can be used to perform abortions. Then Representative, now Vice President, Mike Pence, a Republican from Indiana, has led the charge to prevent Planned Parenthood from receiving Title X funds. House Republicans called for cuts of over $300 million from Title X for FY2011 in order to reduce the number of abortions.Laura Bassett. Huffington Post. ‚ÄúWhat Exactly is Title X Funding?‚Äù April 8, 2011. In June 2019, the Trump administration was allowed by a federal court of appeals to implement, while legal appeals continue, a policy restricting taxpayer dollars given to family planning facilities through Title X. The final Title X Rule, as issued by the Department of Health and Human Services on 22 February 2019, prohibits the use of Title X funds to perform, promote, refer for, or support abortion as a method of family planning. However, nondirective pregnancy counseling, including nondirective counseling on abortion, is permitted. More details on the final rules can be found on the Fact Sheet released by the Department of Health and Human Services. As a result of the new rule, some groups withdrew from the program in August 2019, including Maine Family PlanningPlanned Parenthood leaves federal family planning program over abortion restrictions and Planned Parenthood, which had been providing Title X birth control services to 1.5 million women.  Sterilization claims  Marie Sanchez, chief tribal judge on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation, arrived in Geneva in 1977 with a clear message to deliver to the United Nations Convention on Indigenous Rights. American Indian women, she argued, were targets of the ‚Äúmodern form‚Äù of genocide‚Äîsterilization.

It is located west of the main campus in Baltimore, Maryland, on a parcel of land at the southwest corner of the intersection of the Jones Falls Expressway and Coldspring Lane in the Woodberry neighborhood.About the Ridley Athletic Complex. Loyola University Maryland. At a total cost of US$62 million, it was the largest capital project in Loyola's history. Named after Rev. Harold Ridley, S.J. at the request of an anonymous donor whose $5 million contribution was the most from an individual to the university, the complex consists of a 6,000-seat stadium for Loyola Greyhounds men's and women's soccer and lacrosse, an additional field for its men's rugby union club and eight courts for men's and women's tennis. Features The centerpiece of the complex is J. Richard Awalt Field, named after the president of The Century Corporation who was a member of the Class of 1950 at Loyola College and a major factor in the facility's advancement. A 6,000-seat double-decked grandstand running the length of the field is situated along one side. The two decks are separated by a promenade with concession and merchandise stands, public restrooms and stairs that connect both levels. Overlooking the seating areas are press boxes and luxury suites. Eight sets of light standards, four on each side spread evenly apart, illuminate the stadium for nighttime events. A pair of video scoreboards featuring light-emitting diode technology were installed by Daktronics. The playing surface is Sportexe Momentum artificial turf. Loyola Maryland Greyhounds Lacrosse in the Patriot League Championships The auxiliary practice field immediately to the south is named the Sean Lugano Memorial Field, in memory of the 1995 Loyola graduate and one-time captain of the university's men's rugby union team who died in the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center. Lugano's family and friends raised over $1 million to name the field in his honor. It is the home of the Loyola Rugby Football Club. The playing surface is the same as the one at Awalt Field. The McClure Tennis Center, which consists of eight lighted courts, opened on April 11, 2015. Financed by a $3.2 million gift from an anonymous donor, it is named for Rick McClure, the university's men's and women's tennis coach since 1979 who had been inducted in Loyola's hall of fame in November 2003.Lee, Edward. \\"Loyola Maryland announces construction of tennis center in honor of coach Rick McClure,\\" The Baltimore Sun, Thursday, September 25, 2014.\\"Tennis Teams Split With Bison As Loyola Opens McClure Tennis Center,\\" Loyola University Maryland Athletics, Saturday, April 11, 2015. History The idea for the athletic complex originated in a 1995 conversation between Ridley, Loyola's president at the time, and athletic director Joe Boylan. Land for the smart- growth project was purchased in 1998, with previously owned by LifeBridge Health and the other by the City. The project was stalled for years as the university faced opposition from Woodberry residents, mainly over environmental concerns since the parcel was once a landfill. Eventually the land underwent environmental remediation with the installation of geomembranes to prevent groundwater contamination and a collection system that captured gases from leaking into the atmosphere. Additionally of the site were placed in forest conservation easements. Construction of the complex finally began in the spring of 2006. The opening event at the Ridley was a friendly match on March 10, 2010 between the Loyola Greyhounds men's soccer team and Crystal Palace Baltimore in a fundraiser to benefit Catholic Relief Services' Haitian earthquake recovery efforts. The Greyhounds won 4-3. Its first intercollegiate contest there, a 3-1 loss to William & Mary, was played six months later on September 7. Palace hosted a regular-season game that summer on August 18, a 2-0 defeat to the Rochester Rhinos. The official dedication ceremony for the whole complex was performed prior to the Loyola men's lacrosse home opener against Duke University on March 13, 2010. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, Archbishop Edwin O'Brien and Loyola President Rev. Brian F. Linnane, S.J. led the celebration. The Greyhounds lost to the Blue Devils 8-5 in front of a sellout crowd. Women's sports premiered on March 16 with Loyola defeating Rutgers 18-6 in lacrosse. The first contest at the facility for the Greyhounds' women's soccer squad resulted in a 3-2 victory over Towson on August 21. The Ridley was the site of the 2010 Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference Men's and Women's Soccer Championships. Between the host school's two teams, only the men qualified. They lost to Saint Peter's College 2-1 in two overtime periods in the semifinals on November 12. Two days later, the Peacocks defeated Iona College 2-1 for the championship. Siena College won the women's title one week earlier on November 7 with a 1-0 overtime victory over Canisius College.

Located on the edge of the tree-lined Mall in the centre of Armagh city, the museum is the oldest County Museum in Ireland and was officially opened in 1937.  History  = Charlemont Place National School (1835‚Äì1840s) = The building was originally established as Charlemont Place National School and the architect may have been Francis Johnston's pupil, William Murray. = Armagh Natural History and Philosophical Society (1856‚Äì1930) = The school was not a success and the trustees transferred the lease to Armagh Natural History and Philosophical Society in 1856. They utilised the premises as their reading room, library, lecture hall and museum. It was their museum that formed the foundation of what would become Armagh County Museum‚Äôs collection. They employed architect Edward Gardner to convert the one room interior into two ground floor rooms and a broad balcony housing the museum above. The Society and museum expanded during the latter half of the nineteenth century and by 1888 it could boast 275 members paying an annual subscription of five shillings each. In that year the interior layout of the building was described thus: \\"To economise space, the reading room, by the withdrawal of a partition formed of shutters, becomes the stage of the theatre, and the theatre and museum are one. A good collection of specimens has been secured for the illustration of lectures on natural history. The library is well stocked with books in the following departments: ‚Äì Antiquities, Astronomy, Arts, Biography, Chemistry, Economics, Geography, Geology,and Mineralogy, History, Mechanics, Metaphysics, Microscopy, Natural History, Natural Philosophy, Poetry, and general literature...\\" In 1891 Art Rooms were built immediately behind the museum and for some years an Art School flourished under the auspices of the Science & Art department of the South Kensington Museum. = Birth of County Museum (1930‚Äì1937) = In 1930 Armagh County Council took over the building with the primary purpose of using it as a repository for the County Library but by the far sightedness of the Council secretary T.E. Reid they were persuaded to rejuvenate the Philosophical Society's museum. In 1933 the Council commissioned J.A. Sidney Stendall then Assistant Curator at Belfast Municipal Museum & Art Gallery to write a report on the current state of the museum and how it should be developed. He found many of the \\"curiosities\\" collected by the Philosophical Society to be of little value to a modern County Museum and advised \\"that the few scattered ethnographic objects should be likewise jettisoned, including the very dilapidated mummy...\\" By 1934 they had expended ¬£1,300 \\"on the reconstruction of the buildings to make them suitable for a central Book Repository and Museum\\". The same Council minutes recommend that ¬£50 per annun be spent \\"for the assistance of the Honorary Curator.\\" The Honorary Curator was 46-year-old local historian George Paterson or as he became known through his writing, T.G.F. Paterson. By November 1934 he had been appointed \\"whole- time curator for three years commencing on the 1st January, 1935, at a salary of ¬£3.0.0 per. week.\\" Several years were spent rationalizing the collection and refitting the display cases as well as making alterations to the building. This was completed by 1937 and on 28 April of that year Viscount Charlemont in his role as Minister of Education for Northern Ireland performed the opening ceremony. The Carnegie U.K. Trust had contributed funds to complete the refurbishment of the museum and in 1938 they contributed a further ¬£162.10s.0d towards further development of the new museum. = T. G. F. Paterson (1888‚Äì1972) = Thomas George Farquhar Paterson was born in Canada on 29 February 1888. His father had emigrated there shortly after his marriage but while he was still a child young Paterson returned to Ireland with his family. They settled on the family farm in the town townland of Cornascreeb near Portadown in Co. Armagh. In his early days he often signed his name George Paterson and his friends knew him simply as Tommy but his numerous articles and essays published in newspapers and journals over the years were almost always signed T.G.F. Paterson. Although he was from a farming background young Thomas was apprenticed to a Portadown grocery business, Davidsons. He was later to continue in this line of work in Armagh, working for the old established grocers, Couser‚Äôs which catered for the local landed gentry. He possessed no formal academic training but had a passionate curiosity about his surroundings which served him in his role as museum curator. He brought an energetic spirit to the new museum and quickly began adding to the collection. His wide-ranging interests meant he was ideally suited to the role and soon was acquiring everything from archaeological artefacts to eighteenth century costume.Museum accession register and letter files The following example is typical of Paterson's talent for acquiring important additions to the museum. During the Second World War Belfast based artist John Luke moved to County Armagh to escape the blitz. Paterson was astute enough to commission him to paint a local scene for the museum‚Äôs developing art collection. The Old Callan Bridge (1945), has become one of the museum‚Äôs treasures and is recognised as one of Luke‚Äôs finest works. = Developing the collections = Paterson's interest in local artists can also be seen by his fascination in Lurgan-born polymath \\"√Ü\\"(George Russell). Over the years he managed to persuade many of Russell‚Äôs contemporaries including Lily Yeats to donate paintings by the poet and mystic as well as many of his personal articles. As a result, the museum has 26 of AE‚Äôs paintings, hundreds of letters written by him and such personal items as his spectacles, passport, his painting palette and birthday book. Paterson‚Äôs ambition to collect ranged across all the subjects relevant to a regional museum. Uniforms and accoutrements from the period of the Volunteers in the 1780s were acquired, as were harvest knots and rush-light candleholders used by the rural communities of South Armagh. By the late 1950s the museum had expanded to capacity and Armagh County Council was persuaded to spend money on an expansion programme.  Refurbishment (1959‚Äì1962)  In January 1955 D.R.M. (Roger) Weatherup had been appointed as Paterson‚Äôs Deputy Curator. Paterson and Weatherup spent several months of 1959 packing up the collections and emptying the display cases in readiness for the major refurbishment. Their temporary home for the next few years would be the nearby Armagh jail. Paterson was allocated a cell as his office where he continued his research and writing. = 1960s = During the closure of the museum all of the old buildings behind the neoclassical facade were demolished including the 1890s Art School. A new red-brick extension was built that would accommodate the museum on the first floor and the library repository below. The improvements incorporated a caretaker's residence at the rear of the premises but as work neared completion the Council was persuaded that the need for a live-in caretaker was unnecessary. It was thought the residence would suit Mr Paterson better and after the official opening in September 1962 he moved into his new home. He was to retire the following year but spent the rest of his days living in the museum he had been instrumental in creating. In March 1963 Roger Weatherup took on the role as curator. = 1970s and 1980s = In the early 1970s re-organisation of Northern Ireland's local government and the abolition of Armagh County Council meant the museum was left without the governing body that had been its funder since 1930. The newly formed Armagh District Council was unable to afford the museum so in 1973 an agreement was reached that the museum would be transferred to the Ulster Museum. This began a 40-year relationship with Northern Ireland's National Museum in Belfast. The close relationship with the Ulster Museum brought many advantages, not least the ability to rely on the skills and resources of the larger institution. A chance to expand the museum was realised in the early 1980s when the construction of a dedicated Library Headquarters on the outskirts of Armagh city at Woodford meant the ground floor became vacant. The museum took over the library premises rooms utilising them as storage and offices. = 1990s to present = Following the Wilson report in 1995 it was decided to merge the Ulster Museum with the Ulster Folk & Transport Museum and the Ulster American Folk Park. The Museums and Galleries (Northern Ireland) Order 1997 realised this goal. Armagh County Museum was included in this plan and became part of National Museums Northern Ireland (NMNI). It has continued as one of the four components of National Museums Northern Ireland since then and like the other sites is funded by the Department of Culture Arts and Leisure (DCAL). In April 2015, as part of Northern Ireland's Review of Public Administration the museum was transferred to the newly formed Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council.  Collections  = Archaeology = Many of the megalithic sites in South Armagh were subject to excavations undertaken during the 1930s and 1940s. As a consequence the museum acquired excavation material from sites such as Clontygora and Annaghmare. This material is supplemented by objects from the private collections of the Philosophical Society. = Transport = The transport section contains materials and ephemera such as handbills, posters and railway memorabilia collected by D.R.M. Weatherup during the 1960s when the local rail infrastructure was in decline. = Costume = Paterson's contacts with many of the Armagh landed gentry went back to his early days when he managed Couser's grocers in Armagh during the 1920s. Decades later when many of the \\"big houses\\" were closing up, many of the people he had done business back then donated the contents of their ancestors' wardrobes.Armagh County Museum letter files = Art = The art collection can be divided into the following broad categories: paintings by local artists; paintings of local people; and works representing county Armagh's buildings and topography. There are also paintings from Northern Irish artists such as T.P. Flanagan, Maurice MacGonigal, Beatrice Glenavy, James Humbert Craig, Maurice Wilks, John Luke, Cecil Maguire, James Sinton Sleator, William Conor, and Charles Lamb. Most of the older family portraits are by unknown artists with some exceptions, including Stephen Slaughter's portrait of Primate Hoadly and Martin Cregan's portraits of Leonard Dobbin and Sir William Verner.The oils and acrylics were photographed by the Public Catalogue Foundation and can be browsed on ArtUK's website. The English watercolour artist Cornelius Varley toured Ireland in 1808 and his pencil drawings of Armagh city and Markethill are also in the collection.

Intended for the newly established American Line, the four ships were at the time the largest iron ships yet built in the United States,\\"Looking for Luck\\" by Paul Dorpat ‚Äì Seattle Times Magazine, August 29, 2004.Heinrich, p. 59. and were launched with considerable fanfare. Upon entering service in 1874, they also became the first American-built steamships to challenge British dominance of the transatlantic trade since the American Civil War. Although soon outclassed by newer and larger vessels, all four of the Pennsylvania class steamships were to enjoy long and distinguished careers, the last of them being retired from service in 1921. Development Since 1850, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company (PRR) had enjoyed a lucrative partnership with the British Inman Line, which transported European immigrants from Liverpool direct to Philadelphia, thus ensuring the Railroad a steady stream of customers. In 1857, the Inman Line switched its destination to New York, depriving the Pennsylvania Railroad of this lucrative trade. The Railroad made its first attempt to compensate for the lost traffic by organizing its own steamship line in 1863 (during the American Civil War), but the plan was dropped after the Philadelphia city council declined to provide financial support.Heinrich, pp. 55‚Äì56. After a failed attempt to gain control of a Scottish shipping line, the Anchor Line, in 1870, Pennsylvania Railroad decided to try establishing its own shipping line once again. It petitioned the Pennsylvania State Legislature for a charter for a new company to be known as the American Steamship Company (ASC), created to manage a new shipping line known as the American Line, which would be American's first transatlantic line since the end of the American Civil War. The Legislature granted the ASC its company charter in April 1871.Heinrich, p. 56. The ASC convened its first meeting on April 4, 1871, at which a committee was appointed by the company directors to recommend suitable vessels for its operations. The committee recommended the purchase of four iron steamships of 3,000 or more gross tons, capable of attaining a speed of 11.5 knots and of carrying 75 first class and 1,000 steerage passengers‚Äîspecifications which were designed to ensure the new shipping line's competitiveness with existing transatlantic lines. The committee's recommendations were subsequently approved by the directors, and a public contract for the four vessels put out to tender.Heinrich, pp. 56‚Äì57. Four bids were eventually submitted, ranging as high as $660,000 per ship. The bidders were John Roach & Sons, William Cramp & Sons, Neafie & Levy and Dialogue & Wood‚Äîall Philadelphia firms. The winning bidder was Cramp & Sons, which submitted the lowest bid of $520,000 per unit, and the contract for all four ships was subsequently signed with that company on August 30.Heinrich, p. 57. Design of the vessels was entrusted to the marine architect Barnabus H. Bartol, a director of the American Line, and the head of the Cramp shipyard, Charles Cramp.Flayhart, pp. 23-24. Construction In 1871, no American shipyard was equipped to build even a single ship of the dimensions of the Pennsylvania class, let alone an entire class of such vessels. The largest iron ship built in the United States to date was Harlan and Hollingsworth's steamer Wyanoke, launched in 1870 and more than 1,000 tons lighter than a ship of the Pennsylvania class. In order to construct the four vessels, Cramp & Sons was forced to undertake a major revamping of its shipbuilding facilities. The company began by purchasing real estate at Norris St., Philadelphia, a few blocks from its existing works, on which it built an entirely new shipyard, which was fitted with its own blacksmith, engine, boiler and carpentry shops in addition to a 700-foot outfitting wharf. Cramp also purchased new tools and production equipment. Cost of the real estate alone was above $265,000, and in order to limit the financial risk involved in the expansion, the firm made the decision to incorporate as the William Cramp & Sons Ship and Engine Building Company; however, it remained a proprietary business with the Cramp family owning all the shares.Heinrich, pp. 59‚Äì61. Fortuitously, Cramp & Sons had built its first compound engine only the previous year, and Charles Cramp had also recently travelled to the United Kingdom to acquaint himself with the latest developments in engine technology, hiring a consultant engineer along the way. The company was thus in a position to fit engines of the latest design. Many parts for the ships however, such as iron plates, anchor chains, joinery for the first class cabins, gas fixtures etc., came from specialist Philadelphian manufacturers under subcontract.Heinrich, p. 62. Work on the ships remained on schedule until about February 1872, when progress began to be delayed by shortages of both craftsmen and materials. Cramp had expanded his company's workforce to over 1,000 to build the ships, but strong industry- wide demand at the time made it difficult to find skilled workers. The local ironmolding industry also had difficulty supplying the Cramp shipyard with the amount of iron plate it required.Flayhart, p. 33. Launch By August 1872 the first of the four ships, Pennsylvania was ready for launch. The event was considered of such patriotic and economic significance that a half day holiday was declared for the cities of Philadelphia and Camden and the surrounding area. The launch took place at 10:12 am on Thursday, August 15, watched by thousands of cheering spectators.Flayhart, pp. 33‚Äì34. The second ship, Ohio, followed on October 30. On December 28, Philadelphia's Mayor William S. Stokley presented the American Line with four twelve pound Dahlgren howitzers intended for installation on the ships as signal guns‚Äîa gesture of civic pride in the achievement of building the four vessels.Flayhart, p. 35. The last two ships of the class, Indiana and Illinois, were launched in March and June 1873. Description When completed, each of the four Pennsylvania class ships was fitted with a 2,000 horsepower compound steam engine serviced by several large boilers, delivering power to a single propeller. Each vessel had a single large stack amidships and two schooner-rigged auxiliary masts, one fore and one aft, capable of utilizing a total of ten sails. The sails were only for use in case of mechanical breakdown. An idea of the vessels' internal appointments may be drawn from descriptions of two of the individual ships of the class. Indiana's main saloon, finished in English walnut panelling, was 115 by 43 feet, and spanned the entire width of the ship. It featured a Waters piano at one end and a \\"finely covered bookcase\\" at the other. The ship featured the latest in accommodations, including bathrooms, a smoking room and a barbershop.Flayhart, p. 53. Pennsylvania's cabins were equipped with hair mattresses and fine quality silk-striped terrycloth curtains. While the cabins were finished in a uniform style, each was decorated with a different fabric, lending them an attractive variety.\\"Flayhart, p. 37. Service history Early American Line advertisement featuring a Pennsylvania class vessel When Pennsylvania set sail for Liverpool on her maiden voyage on May 22, 1873 on behalf of the American Line, she was the first ship owned by an American shipping line to participate in the transatlantic trade since the Civil War.Flayhart, p. 23. Pennsylvania was soon joined by her three sister ships, and the four vessels would continue to ply the same Philadelphia-Queenstown- Liverpool route almost without change for many years. =Financial troubles= Unfortunately, the vessels' entry into service closely coincided with the panic of 1873, which triggered one of the longest economic recessions in U.S. history. By 1875, immigration to the United States had plunged to just 50% of its previous level, while overall trade declined 17%.Flayhart, p. 62. Consequently, the four ships‚Äîthe only ships fully owned by the American Steamship Company‚Äîsteadily lost money.Flayhart, Ch. 2.Tyler, p. 34. A number of attempts were made to improve profitability‚Äîfor example, in 1875 all four ships had their capacity for carrying first class passengers upgraded from 75 to 100, and in the same year an unsuccessful attempt to transport fruit was made. A more successful experiment was made in November of the same year when the Illinois sailed for Liverpool with 30 sides of dressed beef along with 140 sides of mutton and some poultry, which may have been the first successful shipment of fresh meat across the Atlantic. However, reliable shipments of fresh meat would not become possible until the invention of refrigeration some twenty years later.Flayhart, pp. 57‚Äì60. A high point for the class came in 1876, when the Indiana had the honor of transporting President Ulysses S. Grant to Liverpool on the first leg of his highly successful world tour.Flayhart, pp. 70‚Äì71. By this time however the ASC's financial troubles were well known, and in 1878, the ships' original builder, William Cramp & Sons, offered to buy back three of the four Pennsylvania class ships in order to convert them into cruisers for the Russian Navy. The ASC refused the offer.Flayhart, pp. 72‚Äì74. =Transfer of management= A brief upturn in the U.S. economy between 1879 and 1881 assisted the ASC's profitability, but after the economy slumped again in 1882, ASC's parent company, the Pennsylvania Railroad, was no longer prepared to underwrite the losses. In October 1884, the Pennsylvania Railroad forced the sale of the ASC's four Pennsylvania class ships to its other shipping company, the International Navigation Company, and the American Steamship Company was disbanded. In the course of its ten-year history, the ASC had cost the PRR almost a million dollars, although the losses were offset to some extent by the extra business the Pennsylvania class ships had brought to the railroad. Around this time, each of the four ships also had their hulls strengthened at the cost of $25,000 per ship.Flayhart, pp. 76‚Äì78. The main difference between the ASC and the INC was that the former had run American-built, American-flagged ships, while the latter employed foreign built vessels which sailed under the Belgian flag and operated under the name of the Red Star Line. This saved money because the Red Star Line employed European crews, who were paid less than their American counterparts. The INC, however, continued to run the Pennsylvania class on the Philadelphia- Queenstown-Liverpool route under the established American Line name.Flayhart, p. 78. =Later service= A Red Star Line poster, probably dating from the 1890s Between 1887 and 1891, all four ships of the class were refitted with smaller but more modern triple expansion steam engines, which were more economical to run and allowed for more cargo space. At the same time, all but Ohio were downgraded to carry only cabin- and steerage-class passengers. During the 1890s, the vessels operated a variety of different routes, sometimes under charter to the Red Star Line, including Antwerp‚ÄìNew York and Antwerp-Philadelphia, as well as their original Liverpool to Philadelphia route.From North Atlantic Seaway by N. R. P. Bonsor, volume 3, pp. 928‚Äì929, as cited at \\"The Ships List\\" website, see Pennsylvania (1872) , Ohio (1872) , Indiana (1873) and Illinois (1873) . In 1897, Clement Acton Griscom, head of the Inman Line which now controlled the vessels, took advantage of high demand for American flag vessels caused by the Alaskan gold rush to sell off his ageing fleet of Pennsylvania class vessels.Flayhart, p. 54. Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana were all sold to Pacific steamship companies servicing gold rush customers, while the fourth ship, Illinois was sold to the U.S. Navy to serve as a supply ship.Flayhart, p. 56.USS Supply (1873), Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. All four ships continued to serve in these respective roles for at least another dozen years. Pennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana all eventually succumbed to accidents in Pacific waters. Illinois, as , served in both the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the First World War, and continued in U.S. Navy service until being struck from the Navy List in 1921. She was finally scrapped in 1928. In total, the four ships of the Pennsylvania class gave a total of well over 160 years of service to their various owners. Footnotes References * Bonsor, N. R. P.

The first of a series of four Pennsylvania-class vessels and the lead ship in her class, Pennsylvania and her three sister ships‚ÄîOhio, Indiana and Illinois‚Äîwere the largest iron ships ever built in the United States at the time of their construction, and amongst the first to be fitted with compound steam engines. They were also the first ships to challenge British dominance of the transatlantic trade since the American Civil War. Launched with great fanfare in 1872, Pennsylvania narrowly escaped destruction by hurricane in her first year of operation, but went on to enjoy a long and distinguished career. Though soon outclassed by newer ships, she continued in operation for some 44 years, plying various transatlantic routes and later playing a role in the Alaskan gold rush and serving as a troopship during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The ship was finally destroyed by a fire in 1918. Development The four Pennsylvania class liners were constructed at a cost of $520,000 each by William Cramp & Sons on behalf of the American Steamship Company (ASC), a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.Heinrich, p. 57, Flayhart, p. 20. Heinrich says the winning bid was $525,000 rather than $520,000. The Railroad intended to utilize the vessels to bring European immigrants direct to Philadelphia, thus ensuring the company a steady stream of customers. In recognition of this purpose, the four ships‚ÄîPennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio‚Äîwere named after the four states serviced by the Railroad.Heinrich, p. 62.Flayhart, p. 23. Design of the ships was entrusted to Charles H. Cramp of the Cramp & Sons shipyard, and Barnabas H. Bartol, a director of the ASC.Flayhart, pp. 23‚Äì24. Construction At 3,000 gross tons apiece, the ships were 1,000 tons larger than any iron ship previously constructed in the United States, and Cramp & Sons was forced to undertake a substantial upgrade of its facilities to complete them. The company established an entirely new shipyard for construction of the vessels, serviced by its own blacksmith, engine, boiler and carpentry shops, as well as providing it with a 700-foot outfitting wharf. Cost of the real estate alone was in excess of $265,000, and Cramp & Sons was obliged to incorporate as the William Cramp & Sons Engine and Ship Building Company in order to limit the financial risk involved.Heinrich, pp. 59-61. Fortuitously, Cramp & Sons had only recently built its first compound marine steam engine, and consequently the shipyard was able to install the vessels with the latest in engine technology.Heinrich, p. 53. The original contract called for Pennsylvania to be completed by September 1, 1872, but the schedule proved optimistic.Flayhart, p. 24. A short-lived shipbuilding boom in the early 1870s made it difficult for the Cramp shipyard to obtain iron plates and other materials, and the yard was also affected by shortages of skilled labor.Flayhart, p. 33. As a result, the ship would not be ready for delivery until almost nine months later. Launch Steamship Pennsylvania. 19th- century painting. Pennsylvania was launched on August 15, 1872. The event was considered of such significance that‚Äîin an era of the 12-hour day and six-day working week‚Äîa half day holiday was declared for the entire city of Philadelphia and the surrounding area. Piers, buildings and ships, including Pennsylvania herself, were decorated with patriotic bunting and flags of every description, and a vast crowd of sightseers thronged every available vantage point along the river, while others watched from the hundreds of boats large and small, many of which had been rented out as excursion vessels for the occasion. At 10:12 am, William Cramp gave the order to cut the stays, and Pennsylvania slid down the ways and into the Delaware River to \\"the cheers of a vast throng, the blowing of a hundred steam whistles, and a salvo of artillery.\\"Flayhart, 33-34. Quote is cited to the Philadelphia Commercial List and Price Current, August 17, 1872. It would be many more months, however, before the ship was ready for service. Difficulties in obtaining castings for the engines added to the existing delays, and consequently the ship's trials were not held until the week of May 3, 1873. After a 48-hour speed-and-economy trial of the ship's engines along the Delaware River, Pennsylvania's performance was declared satisfactory, and she was handed over to her new owners.Flayhart, pp. 35‚Äì36. Service history Pennsylvania departed Philadelphia on her maiden voyage on May 22, 1873, commanded by Captain George Sumner and with a complement of 56 first-class passengers, including Major Thomas T. Firth, a leading executive of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and his wife. The voyage proved not without incident as the ship shed propellor blades during the transatlantic crossing, and she arrived at Liverpool under sail, after which she spent some time in drydock undergoing repairs.Heinrich, pp. 63-64, Tyler, p. 34, Flayhart, pp. 37-38. By June 23 she was ready to make the return voyage, with a full complement of passengers and a substantial cargo.Flayhart, p. 38. Pennsylvania thereafter would continue to make regular crossings between Philadelphia and Liverpool for the next thirteen years. =1874 hurricane= Although destined for many years of reliable service, Pennsylvania's career was almost prematurely ended only a few months after launch. The winter of 1873‚Äì74 was a particularly bad one on the Atlantic,Smith, Craig B., Mueller, Kurt (2006): Extreme Waves, Joseph Henry Press, p. 177, . Google books extract.Flayhart, p. 42. and would prove a traumatic one for the crew and passengers of Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania departed Liverpool for Philadelphia at 2:30pm February 21, 1874, with a typical small winter-passage complement of two saloon and twelve steerage- class passengers, and some $250,000 of cargo. On the night of February 27, the ship ran into a hurricane on the open sea. Giant waves swept everything from the ship's decks and flooded the passenger saloon, while the ship struggled to retain headway. At around midnight, a mammoth wave slammed down upon the vessel, sweeping away all the lifeboats and liferafts, and breaking the foreboom and all four of the ship's forward hatches. Water began pouring into the holds, until they were about one quarter full. Tragically, the huge wave had also swept away the wheelhouse, the mate's house, and part of the wooden ship's bridge, taking with them the captain of the ship and four crew members, none of whom were ever seen again.Flayhart, 42‚Äì44. Command of the ship thereby devolved upon the ship's third officer, Charles Rivers, but Rivers, apparently in a state of shock, proved incapable of action. Fortunately, one of the ship's small complement of passengers, Cornelius L. Brady, was a ships' master himself with recent experience of such a crisis. Brady had been the hero in the shipwreck of the SS Atlantic less than a year prior, where his courageous action in personally establishing a rope to shore was credited with saving as many as 250 lives.SS Atlantic Memorial page, Nova Scotia's Electric Scrapbook.The S/S Atlantic of the White Star Line, disaster in 1873, Norway Heritage website.\\"The Atlantic: Progress of the Investigation‚ÄîOfficers' Testimony\\" - New York Times, April 8, 1873. Now he was now about to lead another rescue effort. Brady quickly ordered the crew to secure the damaged upper forward hatches with hatches from the lower deck, in order to stop the further flow of water into the ship. A delegation of the crew then implored Brady to take command, a proposal which he accepted. Brady made his way ondeck to the midships wheelhouse, where he ordered the helmsman to turn the ship into the wind. He then rang the engine room to reduce the ship's speed to dead slow.Flayhart, pp. 44‚Äì48.\\"The Pennsylvania: Testimony of Captain Brady in the Salvage Suit\\", New York Times, May 8, 1874. The ship was to survive another five days of battering from high seas until February 28, when the storm finally broke, after which Brady brought the ship home safely to Philadelphia, albeit a week late. The drama was not quite over however. Having just saved a $600,000 ship and its $250,000 cargo along with the passengers and crew from destruction, Brady felt insulted by a gift of just $1,000 offered by the American Steamship Company. He promptly sued for the full salvage value of the vessel, and in the subsequent court case, in which one witness after another testified in his favour, Brady was eventually awarded the sum of $4,000 plus $200 expenses, which after legal fees netted him the significantly improved sum of $2,550.Flayhart, pp. 48‚Äì52. As a result of the destruction of the ship's wooden bridge during the hurricane, a new iron bridge was later installed on all four of the Pennsylvania class vessels.Flayhart, p. 26. =1875‚Äì1880s= After this initial brush with destruction, Pennsylvania continued to provide regular service between Liverpool and Philadelphia for another thirteen years.From North Atlantic Seaway by N. R. P. Bonsor, volume 3, pp. 928, as cited at \\"The Ships List\\" website, see Pennsylvania (1872) . In 1875, a decision was made to increase the first class complement of all Pennsylvania class vessels from 75 to 100. In 1878, Pennsylvania was involved in a collision with the schooner H. B. Hume in which the latter was sunk. Judgement in the case was rendered against Pennsylvania in 1882. In that same year, the wooden pilothouse in the bow of all four Pennsylvania class ships was replaced with an iron one for safety reasons.Flayhart, p. 77. In 1883‚Äì84, inspections revealed that all four Pennsylvania class ships required immediate maintenance to their hulls, which needed strengthening. The repairs were carried out at a cost of $25,000 per vessel, but the additional costs probably contributed to the Pennsylvania Railroad's decision to wind up the American Steamship Company, whose inception had coincided with the extended economic downturn beginning with the financial crisis of 1873, as a result of which the company had constantly struggled to turn a profit. With the demise of the ASC, Pennsylvania and her three sister ships were sold to the PRR's other shipping line, the International Navigation Company, which owned the Red Star Line.Flayhart, pp. 77‚Äì78. Unlike the ASC, the Red Star Line did not exclusively employ American crews, resulting in a net saving on wages, but the transfer meant an end to the ASC's original vision of a class of \\"American iron steamship[s], built of American materials, owned by American capital, and ... manned by American seamen.\\"Flayhart, pp. 29‚Äì30. Quote is cited to the Philadelphia Commercial List and Price Current, April 6, 1872. In 1887, Pennsylvania was finally transferred from the Liverpool‚ÄìPhiladelphia route, which she had maintained from her first voyage, to the Red Star Line's premier Antwerp-New York route. By this time, the Red Star Line had also acquired the prestigious Inman Steamship Company, and Pennsylvania reportedly sailed for the first time with the Inman Line in 1888, adopting the company's colours in 1893.Flayhart, p. 163. =1890s‚Äì1918= In 1891, Pennsylvania had a major overhaul when her outdated compound engine was replaced by a new triple- expansion engine supplied by the original builder, William Cramp & Sons.SS Pennsylvania, American Line, Norway Heritage website. The new engine was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and was more economical to run. By this time, the ship was beginning to show her age in comparison with newer and more modern vessels, and she no longer carried first class passengers. In the same year, the ship was switched to the less important Antwerp-Philadelphia route, which she maintained until 1898, making her last transatlantic crossing that year. In the late 1890s, the Alaskan gold rush created a demand for American-flagged ships. The American Line took advantage of this demand to sell three of the ageing Pennsylvania class vessels, including Pennsylvania, at a premium. On April 11, 1898, Pennsylvania sailed from Philadelphia to San Francisco on the Pacific Ocean, where she was sold to the Empire LineCruise Travel, Volume 19, No. 5, March 1998, Lakeside Publishing Co., page 29, ISSN 0199-5111, Extract. for service on the Seattle-Nome route.Flayhart, p. 54. Shortly thereafter, she was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy to serve as a troopship during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Pennsylvania's 44-year career eventually came to an end when she was destroyed by fire in Iquique, Chile, on November 12, 1918, the day after Armistice Day.

The ship's launch consequently did not take place until October 30, and she was not completed for delivery until well into the following year. Service history Ohio's maiden voyage took place on August 7, 1873, on the Philadelphia-Queenstown- Liverpool route. She would continue working this route almost without interruption for the next 22 years. =1870s= SS Ohio Mid-Ocean SS Ohio Ohio's first few months of service proved eventful. The winter of 1873-74 was particularly bad on the Atlantic, and on a late winter voyage to Liverpool, Ohio lost two lifeboats, while her after wheelhouse was damaged beyond repair by the waves. During a March crossing to Philadelphia, the ship was so battered by heavy seas that she suffered damage to her bow. In May, some of Ohio's cargo caught fire between Liverpool and Queenstown. After the fire was extinguished, the ship resumed her voyage to Liverpool, but the cargo caught fire a second time, and was only finally extinguished by a combination of battening the hatches to starve the flames of oxygen and the use of steam pumps.Flayhart, p. 53. In February of the same year, the wooden bridge of Ohio's sister ship Pennsylvania was torn from the vessel in a hurricane, and a new iron bridge was subsequently installed on all four of the Pennsylvania class vessels.Flayhart, p. 26. In 1875, a decision was made to increase the first class complement of all Pennsylvania class vessels from 75 to 100. Failed experimental fruit shipment With the American Line struggling to turn a profit in the wake of the 1873 financial panic, the company decided to experiment with some novel exports. The first such experiment involved a large shipment of peaches onboard Ohio. Delaware fruit growers had experienced a bumper year in 1875, and a glut of peaches on the local market had depressed the price correspondingly. Seeking to take advantage of the situation, the ASC's management placed advertisements offering to ship the surplus fruit to the United Kingdom in specially ventilated compartments on Ohio. The ASC organized a train to pick up the fruit, and the response was overwhelming, with over 4,500 baskets of peaches delivered. Ohio sailed for Liverpool with its cargo of peaches in late August. The ASC had hoped to keep the fruit fresh during the transatlantic crossing by installing steam powered blowers to circulate an air current over the peaches through several tons of ice, but the ice was soon melted by heat from the ship's boilers and the sunny weather. By the time the ship reached Liverpool, the shipment of peaches had completely decomposed and was utterly worthless. Undeterred by this failure, the ASC next attempted a shipment of fresh meat on board Illinois, utilizing much the same technique. This time, the ice held out, and the meat arrived in Liverpool in excellent condition. A second shipment of meat was subsequently made; however, reliable shipments of fresh meat across the Atlantic would have to wait for the invention of refrigeration twenty years later.Flayhart pp. 57-60. =1880s= In 1882, the wooden pilothouse in the bow of all four Pennsylvania class ships was replaced with an iron one for safety reasons. In 1883-84, inspections revealed that all four Pennsylvania class ships required immediate maintenance to their hulls, which needed strengthening.

With the demise of the ASC, Ohio and her three sister ships were transferred to management of the PRR's other shipping line, the Red Star Line, but Ohio continued to service her familiar Liverpool- Philadelphia route. Ohio had a major refit with the installation of a triple- expansion steam engine to replace her original compound steam engine in 1887. The new engine, built and installed by James Howell of Glasgow,SS Ohio, American Line, Norway Heritage website.Flayhart, p. 46 was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and more economical to run. Ohio's first class accommodation was also rebuilt.From North Atlantic Seaway by N. R. P. Bonsor, volume 3, p. 928, as cited at Ship descriptions - O - The Ships List website. That same year, Ohio was switched from the Liverpool-Philadelphia run to the Liverpool-New York City route. She commenced her first such crossing on August 16, 1887 and made her thirteenth and last voyage on this route commencing February 20, 1889. =City of Paris incident= City of Paris In 1890, Ohio was on her way to the United States when she encountered her fellow Red Star liner City of Paris being towed back to Liverpool by the steamship Aldersgate and accompanied by the White Star liner Adriatic. City of Paris had suffered a catastrophic engine failure out from Liverpool that had shredded her engine and perforated the hull, causing the ship to take water. Ohio promptly turned around and joined the two vessels escorting the ship to safe harbor, which was achieved March 29 at Cork, by which time the stern of the stricken vessel was drawing and her bow was high out the water.Flayhart, p. 130. =To 1897= By 1892, Ohio was the only remaining vessel of the Pennsylvania class to be carrying first class passengers, all three of her sister ships having been downgraded to cabin class. In 1893, she began sailing under the colours of the prestigious Inman Line, which had recently been acquired by the Red Star Line.Flayhart, p. 164-65. Ohio maintained the Liverpool-Queenstown- Philadelphia service through the early 1890s, commencing her last such crossing on August 25, 1895. In 1896, Ohio was transferred to the New York- Southampton route, commencing her first such crossing on June 27 of that year. Her final North Atlantic voyage began when she sailed on August 22, 1897 from Kiel to Southampton and thence to New York. =Alaskan gold rush= Following the discovery of gold in Alaska in 1896, great demand was created for American-flagged ships to transport gold prospectors to Alaska during the resulting gold rush. Clement Acton Griscom, the executive head of the Inman Line, took advantage of this demand to sell the ageing and outdated Pennsylvania class vessels at a premium.Flayhart, p. 54. On March 5, 1898, Ohio sailed from Philadelphia to San Francisco on the Pacific Coast. There, the vessel was sold to the Alaska Steamship Company, and subsequently commenced servicing the Seattle-Nome route,\\"Looking for Luck\\" by Paul Dorpat - Seattle Times Magazine, August 29, 2004. which she was to maintain to the end. In 1907, Ohio struck an iceberg in the Bering Sea. Although the vessel survived the collision, 75 panicked passengers jumped overboard onto the ice, resulting in the loss of four lives. In 1908, Ohio's captain, mindful of the previous year's accident, infuriated his passengers by refusing to complete the journey before the ice melted. On August 26, 1909, Ohio hit an uncharted rock (which is now named Ohio Rock) at Sarah Island at the South end of Heikish narrows and the North end of Finlayson Channel, British Columbia, but the captain was able to beach the ship before she sank, saving the lives of all but four of the 214 passengers and crew. Michael James Heney died a year later from hypothermia caused from too much time in the frigid waters. Ohio's career thus came to an end after 36 years of service.

After the wooden bridge of Indiana's sister ship Pennsylvania was torn from the vessel in a February 1874 hurricane, a new iron bridge was subsequently installed on all four of the Pennsylvania class vessels. Later that year, on June 18, Indiana was selected to host a celebratory event for the American Steamship Company's board of directors. After a tour of the ship, followed by dinner and toasts, the directors left well satisfied with what they had seen.Flayhart, p. 53. The following year, a decision was made to increase the first class complement of all Pennsylvania class vessels from 75 to 100. On February 29, 1876, Indiana became grounded upon the Bulkhead BarDelaware River ship channels ‚Äì Philadelphia Dept. of Engineers. in the Delaware River, but she was freed the next morning without damage.Flayhart, p. 60. There is at least one other location named Bulkhead Bar, in New Jersey. The reference does not state which Bulkhead Bar it refers to, but it is almost certainly the one in the Delaware River. =Participation in Grant's world tour= A highlight of Indiana's career occurred when the vessel was selected to convey U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant on the initial leg of his world tour. The tour was destined to be highly successful, with Civil War hero Grant greeted with great enthusiasm and ceremony at every port of call.Flayhart, pp. 70‚Äì71. The tour departure date was set for May 17, 1877, and Grant spent the morning at a champagne breakfast hosted by Pennsylvania Governor John F. Hartranft. Arrangements had been made for Grant and his party to join Indiana downstream, away from the crowds that had gathered to watch the departure. Boarding the steamer Twilight, Grant and his entourage sailed to rendezvous with Indiana in midstream near New Castle, Delaware, accompanied by a huge flotilla of decorated yachts and tugs and a chorus of ships' horns and whistles. The voyage to Liverpool encountered unusually rough weather, and many of the passengers suffered from seasickness, but Grant later reported that neither he nor his wife were afflicted. Arriving at Liverpool on May 28, Grant was surprised to find the harbor filled with gaily decorated welcoming vessels, and the streets packed with cheering crowds, prompting him to remark that his reception was \\"as hearty and as enthusiastic as in Philadelphia on our departure\\". He subsequently decided to extend his stay in the city by a day before travelling on to London. Grant and his wife eventually returned triumphantly to the United States on board the Pacific Mail steamship City of Tokio on September 20, 1879. =1880s‚Äì1897= Ivan Aivazovsky. The Relief Ship (1892) In 1882, the wooden pilothouse in the bow of all four Pennsylvania class ships was replaced with an iron one for safety reasons. In 1883‚Äì84, inspections revealed that all four Pennsylvania class ships required immediate maintenance to their hulls, which needed strengthening. The repairs were carried out at a cost of $25,000 per vessel, but the additional costs probably contributed to the Pennsylvania Railroad's decision to wind up the American Steamship Company, which because of the after effects of the 1873 panic had always struggled to make a profit. With the demise of the ASC, Indiana and her three sister ships were transferred to management of the PRR's other shipping line, the Red Star Line, but Indiana continued to service her familiar Liverpool‚ÄìPhiladelphia route. In March 1889, Indiana made a single Antwerp to New York voyage under charter to the Red Star Line, one of apparently only a handful of transatlantic crossings by the vessel that were not made on the Liverpool-Philadelphia route. Indiana had a major refit with the installation of a triple-expansion steam engine to replace her original compound steam engine in 1891. The new engine, built and installed by James Howell of Glasgow,SS Indiana, American Line, Norway Heritage website. was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and was more economical to run. At the same time, she was refitted to accommodate only intermediate and third class passengers.From North Atlantic Seaway by N. R. P. Bonsor, volume 3, p. 929, as cited at \\"The Ships List\\" website, see Indiana 1873 . In 1892, Indiana made a voyage to Czarist Russia with a cargo of grain destined for famine relief. The relief voyage was a result of the sympathetic relationship that had built up between Russia and Philadelphia via warship contracts awarded by the Russian Navy to the shipyard of William Cramp & Sons, which had kept the Philadelphian waterfront busy during an economic downturn.Flayhart, p. 45. Indiana thereafter continued servicing her familiar Liverpool-Philadelphia route until 1897. She made her last transatlantic crossing commencing December 1, 1897. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Following the discovery of gold in Alaska in 1896, great demand was created for American- flagged ships to transport gold prospectors to Alaska during the resulting gold rush. Clement Acton Griscom, the executive head of the Inman Line, took advantage of this demand to sell the by now outdated Pennsylvania class vessels at a premium.Flayhart, p. 54. On March 28, 1898, Indiana sailed from Philadelphia to Seattle on the Pacific Coast. There, the vessel was sold to the Empire Line for service on the Seattle‚ÄìNome route. However, in April 1898 the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War broke out, and Indiana was requisitioned by the U.S. Navy as a troopship. Later in the war, she served as a hospital ship, returning wounded troops from Manila, Philippines via Honolulu to San Francisco. Nine of the wounded died during the voyage.Cruise Travel, Volume 19, No. 5, March 1998, Lakeside Publishing Co., page 29, ISSN 0199-5111, Extract. =Final years= After the war, Indiana was acquired by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, which utilized her from New York to South America as well as in the Northwest. On April 4, 1909, Indiana was grounded off Cape Tosco, Isla Santa Margarita, Mexico. The accident tore out the ship's bottom, flooding her three holds and engine compartment to a depth of about sixteen feet. Fortunately, passengers, cargo and crew were safely removed. The vessel's wreckage was subsequently sold for $5,000 salvage, bringing to an end a long and varied 36-year career.

The last of a series of four Pennsylvania-class vessels, Illinois and her three sister ships‚ÄîPennsylvania, Ohio and Indiana‚Äîwere the largest iron ships ever built in the United States at the time of their construction, and amongst the first to be fitted with compound steam engines. They were also the first ships to challenge British dominance of the transatlantic trade since the American Civil War. Though soon outclassed by newer and larger vessels, Illinois was destined to enjoy a long and distinguished career, first as a transatlantic passenger liner and later as the U.S. Navy's auxiliary vessel . In the 1870s, Illinois may have been the first ship to successfully transport a shipment of fresh meat from the United States to Europe, twenty years before the introduction of refrigeration. As USS Supply, the ship served in both the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and the First World War, and crew members may have been the first United States personnel to fire a hostile shot in the latter. Illinois was scrapped in 1928. Development The four Pennsylvania class liners were constructed at a cost of $520,000 each by William Cramp & Sons on behalf of the American Steamship Company (ASC), a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company.Heinrich, p. 57, Flayhart, p. 20. Heinrich says the winning bid was $525,000 rather than $520,000. The Railroad intended to utilize the vessels to bring European immigrants direct to Philadelphia, thus ensuring the company a steady stream of customers. In recognition of this purpose, the four ships‚ÄîPennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois and Ohio‚Äîwere named after the four states serviced by the Railroad.Heinrich, p. 62.Flayhart, p. 23. Design of the ships was entrusted to Charles H. Cramp of the Cramp & Sons shipyard, and Barnabas H. Bartol, a director of the ASC.Flayhart, pp. 23‚Äì24. Construction At 3,000 gross tons apiece, the ships were 1,000 tons larger than any iron ship previously constructed in the United States, and Cramp & Sons was forced to undertake a substantial upgrade of its facilities to complete them. The company established an entirely new shipyard for construction of the vessels, serviced by its own blacksmith, engine, boiler and carpentry shops, as well as providing it with a 700-foot outfitting wharf. Cost of the real estate alone was in excess of $265,000, and Cramp & Sons was obliged to incorporate as the William Cramp & Sons Engine and Ship Building Company in order to limit the financial risk involved.Heinrich, pp. 59‚Äì61. Fortuitously, Cramp & Sons had only recently built its first compound marine steam engine, and consequently the shipyard was able to install the vessels with the latest in engine technology.Heinrich, p. 53. The original contract called for Pennsylvania to be completed by January 1, 1873, but the schedule proved optimistic.Flayhart, p. 24. A short-lived shipbuilding boom in the early 1870s made it difficult for the Cramp shipyard to obtain iron plates and other materials, and the yard was also affected by shortages of skilled labor.Flayhart, p. 33. As a result, the ship would not be ready for delivery until almost a year later. Service history Illinois was launched in June 1873. She commenced her maiden voyage on January 23, 1874 on the Philadelphia‚ÄìQueenstown‚ÄìLiverpool route, a route she would maintain for the next twelve years. =1870s= Like her sister ships Pennsylvania and Ohio, Illinois also had an eventful first year of operation. In April 1874, she was making her way down the Delaware River when, just opposite the Philadelphia Naval Yard, she encountered four canal boats coming in the opposite direction. Illinois promptly collided with and sank all four vessels in short order. Fortunately, no lives were lost, and the hull of Illinois was undamaged by the collisions, enabling her to continue the voyage to Liverpool.Flayhart, p. 53. After the wooden bridge of Illinois' sister ship Pennsylvania was destroyed in an 1874 hurricane, a new iron bridge was installed on all four of the Pennsylvania class vessels.Flayhart, p. 26. In 1875, a decision was made to increase the first class complement of all Pennsylvania class vessels from 75 to 100. =Experimental meat shipments= With the American Line struggling to turn a profit in the wake of the 1873 financial panic, the company decided to experiment with some novel exports. A glut of peaches in the summer of 1875 encouraged the company to try and export some of the surplus fruit to Great Britain on the Ohio, but the experiment was a costly failure.Flayhart pp. 58‚Äì59. Undeterred, the company next tried a shipment of fresh meat. Illinois was loaded with 30 head of dressed beef, 140 sheep carcasses and some poultry and oysters for a November 1875 voyage. A high pressure engine was installed to circulate a current of cold air chilled by eight tons of ice. This time the ice lasted through the voyage, and the meat arrived in Liverpool in excellent condition, encouraging the client, Martin, Fuller & Company, to make a second shipment of 100 head of dressed beef. These may have been the first ever successful shipments of fresh meat from the United States to Europe, but another twenty years would pass before the invention of refrigeration made regular, reliable shipments possible.Flayhart, pp. 59‚Äì60. =1880s‚Äì1897= In 1882, the wooden pilothouse in the bow of all four Pennsylvania class ships was replaced with an iron one for safety reasons. In 1883‚Äì84, inspections revealed that all four Pennsylvania class ships required immediate maintenance to their hulls, which needed strengthening. The repairs were carried out at a cost of $25,000 per vessel, but the additional costs probably contributed to the Pennsylvania Railroad's decision to wind up the American Steamship Company, which because of the after effects of the 1873 panic had always struggled to make a profit. With the demise of the ASC, Illinois and her three sister ships were transferred to management of the PRR's other shipping line, the Red Star Line, but Illinois continued to service her familiar Liverpool‚ÄìPhiladelphia route until 1886. Her last such voyage commenced July 7 of that year. On December 17, she began the first of twenty crossings on the Antwerp‚ÄìNew York route. Illinois had a major refit in 1891 with the installation of a triple-expansion steam engine to replace her original compound steam engine. The new engine, manufactured and installed by the ship's original builder, William Cramp & Sons,SS Illinois, American Line, Norway Heritage website. was smaller, allowing for more cargo space, and more economical to run. At this time the first class accommodation of Illinois was removed, and she was fitted to accommodate intermediate \\"cabin class\\" and steerage passengers only.From North Atlantic Seaway by N. R. P. Bonsor, volume 3, p. 929, as cited at \\"The Ships List\\" website, see Illinois 1873. Illinois commenced her final Antwerp‚ÄìNew York crossing on February 27, 1892. Subsequently she worked the Antwerp- Philadelphia route until 1897. =USS Supply= In March 1898, Illinois sailed from Philadelphia to San Francisco. On April 30, 1898, she was sold for the sum of $325,000 to the United States Navy, for employment in the recently declared Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.\\"Supply II\\" ‚Äì Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. Renamed USS Supply, the vessel served as the supply ship for the American fleet in Cuban waters. After the war ended in late 1898, Supply was decommissioned, refitted to improve her living quarters, and recommissioned on August 1, 1902. She subsequently operated as the supply ship for the Asiatic Fleet and as Station Ship at Guam for many years. When the United States entered the First World War on April 6, 1917, USS Supply was in port at Guam together with the German auxiliary cruiser SMS Cormoran, which had been interned there since 1914. A party from Supply attempted to seize the German vessel, but Cormoran's captain had prepared for such a possibility and scuttled the ship. A warning shot fired over the bow of Cormoran by crewmen of Supply during the attempted seizure may have been the first hostile shot fired by American servicemen in World War I. Supply was placed out of commission at Mare Island on 15 September 1919. She was struck from the Navy List and sold for scrap on 30 September 1921. The ship was eventually scrapped in 1928.

Location  The Helmand PRT was headquartered in the province's capital, Lashkar Gah. It operated district field offices on military bases in Gereshk, Garmsir, Sangin, Nad-e Ali, Now Zad, Marjah, Khan-e shin and Musa Qalah. These offices are now closed.  Structure and staffing  The Helmand PRT was part of the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan and was located within Regional Command Southwest. HPRT was funded by the UK, USA, Danish and Estonian Governments. With a core team of over 100 civilian and military staff, the HPRT was one of the largest PRTs in Afghanistan. HPRT was a led by a civilian who outranked the British military commander in Helmand. UK, US and Danish District Stabilisation Teams were located in 11 of Helmand‚Äôs 14 Districts. A Stabilisation Team typically comprised: civilian stabilisation advisers; civilian specialists (e.g. in agriculture); a political adviser; and working with a UK Military Stabilisation Support Team (MSST), a US Civil Affairs Team or a Danish CIMIC (Civil Military Cooperation) Support Team. The Stabilisation Teams worked alongside the District Regimental Battle Group or Battalion Headquarters to coordinate civil and military activity.  Activities  The PRT worked to deliver a provincial stabilisation and development plan that had been agreed between the Government of Afghanistan and international partners. The plan coordinated the efforts of 9 themes, or strands: Governance and Politics; Rule of Law; Counter-Narcotics; Population Engagement; Health; Education; Agriculture; Infrastructure and Private Sector Development. To deliver this Helmand PRT worked with the Government of Afghanistan, ISAF, and the Afghan National Security Forces. Helmand PRT had more resources than any other PRT.

It is similar to the standard English \\"no problem\\". The phrase is widely used in Australian speech and represents a feeling of friendliness, good humour, optimism and \\"mateship\\" in Australian culture. The phrase has been referred to as the national motto of Australia. The phrase has influenced a similar phrase used in the Tok Pisin language in Papua New Guinea. No worries utilization migrated to New Zealand after origination in Australia. Its usage became more common in British English after increased usage in Australian soap operas that aired on television in the United Kingdom. Linguistics experts are uncertain how the phrase became utilized in American English; theories include use by Steve Irwin on the television program The Crocodile Hunter and usage by the United States media during the 2000 Sydney Olympics. It has also gained usage in Canadian English . Definition No worries is an Australian English expression, meaning \\"do not worry about that\\", or \\"that's all right\\". It can also mean \\"sure thing\\" and \\"you're welcome\\". Other colloquial Australian terms which mean the same thing include \\"she'll be right\\". The expression has been compared to the American English equivalent \\"no problem\\". In their book Australian Language & Culture: No Worries!, authors Vanessa Battersby, Paul Smitz and Barry Blake note: \\"No worries is a popular Australian response akin to 'no problems', 'that's OK' or 'sure thing'.\\" Cultural origins Early documentation dates the phrase back to 1966. According to author of When Cultures Collide: Leading Across Cultures, Richard D. Lewis, the phrase is a form of expression of the relaxed attitude in Australian culture. Anna Wierzbicka comments that the expression illustrates important parts of Australian culture, including: \\"amiability, friendliness, an expectation of shared attitudes (a proneness to easy 'mateship'), jocular toughness, good humour, and, above all, casual optimism\\". She concludes that along with \\"good on you\\", the expressions reflect the \\"national character\\" and \\"prevailing ethos\\" of Australia. Though initially utilized in Australia, the phrase migrated to New Zealand as well. Usage Wierzbicka writes in her book Cross-cultural Pragmatics that the expression \\"permeates Australian speech\\", \\"serves a wide range of illocutionary forces\\" and displays a \\"casual optimism\\". In her 1992 book Semantics, Culture, and Cognition, Wierzbicka classifies the phrase as \\"among the most characteristic Australian expressions\\", along with \\"good on you\\". The term can also be used in the context of an apology. The phrase has been used widely in British English since the late 1980s, a development partly attributed to the success of Australian soap operas such as Neighbours in the United Kingdom. The phrase \\"no wucking forries\\" has the same meaning in Australia; as a spoonerism of \\"no fucking worries\\", and is contracted to the phrases \\"no wuckers\\" and \\"no wucks\\". Influence No worries was referred to as \\"the national motto\\" of Australia in 1978, and in their 2006 work, Diving the World, Beth and Shaun Tierney call \\"no worries, mate\\" the national motto of the country. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Annette Kobak calls the expression a \\"ritual incantation\\" which has \\"particular charm\\". The phrase \\"no waris\\" in the Papua New Guinea language Tok Pisin is derived from the Australian English term. According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 newspaper report notes that no worries has begun to be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: \\"The Americans have no idea of the etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will never catch on as an attitude.\\" According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. One possibility not mentioned in the source is the prominent position of this phrase in the lyrics of song \\"Hakuna Matata\\" in the popular 1994 Disney film The Lion King. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds in the Garden of Words that expressions including \\"no worries\\", \\"absolutely\\", and \\"bottom line\\" have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.

Illinois was purchased by the Navy Department from the International Navigation Company on 30 April 1898 for $325,000.00 and commissioned as Supply, Lt. Comdr. R. R. Ingersoll in command. Service history =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War= Supply was used as the supply ship for the fleet in Cuban waters during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The ship was decommissioned at the New York Navy Yard on 28 April 1899. She was refitted after the war, with better living quarters, and recommissioned on 1 August 1902. =Peacetime service= After recommissioning, Supply was ordered to duty on the Asiatic Station. She operated as the supply ship for the Asiatic Fleet and as Station Ship at Guam for many years. In 1904, she transported Governor of Guam William Elbridge Sewell back to the United States when he fell deathly ill. The ship was overhauled at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in July 1912 and again from November 1915 to March 1916. Supply put to sea on 19 March 1916 and after embarking passengers at San Francisco for passage to Guam and sailed on 29 March. She called at Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, in early April and arrived at Apra Harbor on 25 April. This was her home port while serving as a stores ship for the Asiatic Station. From 22 October to 7 December 1916, she cruised to the Philippine Islands, China, and Japan. In January 1917 the ship was overhauled at Olongapo, Philippines, and returned to Guam on 27 March. =First World War= The German auxiliary cruiser had been in Asiatic waters at the outbreak of World War I and later operated in the southern Pacific. However, lack of provisions forced Cormoran to put in at Guam on 14 December 1914. The German captain accepted internment of the ship the following day, and the cruiser remained in that status until the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917. The morning of 6 April, Supply put a prize crew of 32 men afloat to board the German ship. Her captain offered to surrender the men but not the cruiser. At 0803, Cormoran was blown up by her own crew. Supply immediately lowered all boats to aid in recovering Cormorans crew and their personal effects from the water. Supply remained on station in Apra Harbor until steaming for Manila on 21 May 1917. She departed there on 6 June en route to Japan, via Guam. After visiting various Japanese ports, the ship returned to Cavite, Philippines, for drydocking and repairs. Upon completion, she returned to Guam on 29 August and resumed her duties until 28 November when she got underway for the United States. Christmas 1917 was celebrated at Pearl Harbor; the Panama Canal was transited on 19 January 1918; and Supply arrived at the Charleston Navy Yard on the 25th. =Decommissioning= Upon completion of repairs, Supply was designated flagship of the Train, Atlantic Fleet, based at Charleston. On 29 May 1919, she was reassigned to Guam for duty as Station Ship. However, upon her arrival on the west coast, she was ordered to Mare Island for repairs and placed out of commission there on 15 September 1919. Supply was struck from the Navy list and sold for scrap on 30 September 1921. She was scrapped in 1928.

As the reference says, this technique was subsequently much developed and applied, and was enunciated rather casually by Miller in a 1952 book of tables of Bessel functions. In volume 2 of The Art of Computer Programming, Donald Knuth attributes to Miller a basic technique on formal power series, for recursive evaluation of coefficients of powers or more general functions. In the theory of stellation of polyhedra, he made some influential suggestions to H. S. M. Coxeter. These became known as Miller's rules. The 1938 book on the fifty-nine icosahedra resulted, written by Coxeter and Patrick du Val.Stellation and facetting - a brief history In the 1930s, Coxeter and Miller found 12 new uniform polyhedra, a step in the process of their complete classification in the 1950s.Peter R.

Its site is located near modern Dramesi in Paralia Avlidas. History Graea is listed under Boeotia in Homer's Catalogue of Ships in the Iliad. It seems to have included the city of Oropus, though by the fifth century BCE it was probably a kome (district) of that city.G. S. Kirk, The Iliad: A Commentary: Volume 1, Books 1-4. Cambridge University Press, 1985, , p. 191. According to Pausanias the name was a shortcut of the original name Tanagraia, who was daughter of the river-god Asopos. Graea was a greater area including Aulis, Mycalessus, Harma etc.Pausanias: Boeotica 20‚Äì24 It is also described by some sources as a city; Fossey argues for its identification with the hill of Dhr√°mesi 8 km from Tanagra,John M. Fossey, \\"The Identification of Graia,\\" Euphrosyne 4 (1970), pp. 3‚Äì22. while others suggest it is identical with Oropus itself.Simon Hornblower and Elaine Matthews, Greek Personal Names: Their Value as Evidence. Oxford University Press, 2000, , p. 95; similarly Maria Stamatopoulou and Marina Yeroulanou, Excavating Classical Culture: Recent Archaeological Discoveries in Greece. Archaeopress, 2002, , p. 151. Graea was sometimes said to be the oldest city of Greece. Aristotle said that this city was created before the deluge. The same assertion about the origins of Graea is found in an ancient marble, the Parian Chronicle, discovered in 1687 and dated to 267‚Äì263 BCE, that is currently kept in Oxford and on Paros. Reports about this ancient city can be also found in Homer, in Pausanias, in Thucydides, etc. The name Gra√Øke ( ) was used of the Oropus area, which was dependent on Athens during the Peloponnesian War, by Thucydides, and the term was also used by Stephanus of Byzantium. At some point, the whole of Oropus, including Graea, was incorporated into ancient Attica and became a deme of the phyle of Pandionis, as evidenced from a surviving inscription.Ross & Meier, Die Demen von Attika, p. 6, et seq. The word ŒìœÅŒ±ŒπŒ∫œåœÇ (Graecus, Greek) is interpreted as \\"inhabitant of Graia\\" by some authors.Hatzidakis, 1977, quoted in Babiniotis Dictionary The German historian Georg Busolt suggested that the name Graeci was given initially by the Romans to the colonists from Graia who helped the Euboeans to establish Cumae in southern Italy, and was then used for all Greeks.Online Etymology Dictionary. The classicist Robin Lane Fox states that Oropus was either located in or identical with the city Graia, and writes: > If men from Oropos-Graia were among the early Greek visitors to Capua or > Veii and even early Rome, we can better understand an age-old puzzle: why > Greeks were called \\"Greeks\\" in the Latin West. Such people told their first > contacts in the Latin region that they were \\"Graikoi,\\" that is, people from > Graia. They were thus called \\"Graeci\\" by the people whom they met.Robin Lane > Fox, Travelling Heroes: In the Epic Age of Homer.

The trail was blazed with his brothers Charles and Jesse in 1846. Charles Applegate was not a member of the party that blazed the Applegate Trail from the Willamette Valley to the Humboldt River. According to an original manuscript written by Lindsay Applegate in 1877, the members of the expedition were: Capt. Levi Scott, John Scott (son of Levi), Henry Boygus, Lindsay Applegate, Jesse Applegate, Benjamin Burch, John Owens, John Jones, Robert Smith, Samuel Goodhue, Moses \\"Black\\" Harris, David Goff, Benit Osburn, William Sportsman, and William Parker. Early life Lindsay Applegate was born to Daniel and Rachel Applegate in Kentucky on September 18, 1808.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. pp. 9-10. The family moved to the Osage Valley in Missouri in 1820, where they farmed. In 1831, Lindsay married Elizabeth Miller, whose sister Melinda was married to Lindsay's older brother Charles, and they had six sons. He fought in the Black Hawk War against Native Americans in 1832. Oregon Country In 1843, Lindsay and Charles traveled along with their younger brother Jesse after they all sold their farms in Missouri, bought several hundred head of cattle and set out for Oregon at the behest of Jesse's good friend Robert Shortess. At that time, the final hundred or so miles beyond the Wascopam Mission were by boat through dangerous winds, rapids, and eddies on the Columbia River. Lindsay's nine-year-old son Warren perished, as did Jesse's ten-year-old son Edward, who did not know how to swim. Lindsay wrote, \\"We resolved if we remained in the country, to find a better way for others who might wish to emigrate.\\" Additional fatalities in the 1844 and 1845 immigration seasons further stirred up settlers and inspired many to search for alternate routes. Lindsay and fourteen other settlers established the South Emigrant Trail between Fort Hall in Idaho and the Willamette Valley via northern Nevada through southern Oregon where Ashland and Roseburg now lie. The intents of this route were to be safer than the Columbia River, encourage settlers to western Oregon, avoid the Hudson's Bay Company controlled area, and steer clear of the disputed English territory north of the Columbia, which most settlers expected would become the U.S.-British Columbia border. Jesse obtained information from Hudson Bay about the California Trail which led from Idaho to northern California along the Humboldt River. That combined with knowledge of the trapper's trail between the Willamette Valley and California led fifteen men on horsebackThey began with few than fifteen men, but by the time they left Polk county, the party consisted of Jesse and Lindsay Applegate, William G. Parker, Benjamin F. Burch, David Goff, John Owens, Robert Smith, Bennett Osborn, S. H. Goodhue, Jack Jones, Henry Boygus, William Sportsman, Moses \\"Black\\" Harris, Levi Scott and his son John. to set out in mid-June 1846 to look for a link between the two trails, blessed by the Provisional Government of Oregon. They traveled due south through the Willamette, Umpqua, and Rogue valleys. At the south end of the Rogue Valley‚Äîthe site of present-day Ashland‚Äîthey turned east and crossed the Cascade Range, approximately along the present route of Green Springs Highway, Oregon Route 66, and emerged near where Keno, Oregon now lies. They went around the south end of Klamath Lake and eventually to the future site of Winnemucca, Nevada. The party split, leaving some to rest, while the remainder followed the Humboldt River northeast and along the California Trail to Fort Hall. The first emigrants to use the Applegate Trail did so in fall 1846 by following the Applegate party on the return trip, a group of perhaps 150 families which were persuaded by Jesse. Upon their return, the combined party began to blaze a trail for wagons, though they were ill-prepared for such an effort, having few tools, and consisting of mostly weary emigrants. They also faced an early winter‚Äîone which set snowfall records and stranded the Donner Party a few hundred miles to the south. By the time they arrived in the Rogue Valley, winter had set in. Rain, snow, mud, swollen creeks and rivers hampered passage. Low supplies, scarce game, dense brush and trees, and difficulty lighting warming fires slowed progress considerably, separating the emigrants over many miles. They were spared by relief parties from the Willamette Valley when news of their trouble traveled along the trail. The Applegates were blamed for the hardships the first wagon train faced by Jesse Quinn Thornton, who waged a war of words which nearly led to a duel between him and an Applegate supporter, James Nesmith. Remnants of the hostility survive today among some descendants of those survivors. Though the Applegate Trail minimized natural dangers, aggressive Indian warriors took the lives of at least 300 emigrants by 1862, even though the trail fell into general disuse by 1847. Lindsay Applegate and his party were the first white men in what is now the Lava Beds National Monument. While traveling eastward they were stopped by rough lava around the south end of Tule Lake. The feature known as Stone Bridge at the north end was the route of hundreds of emigrants. Lindsay made a donation land claim in Yoncalla (between Eugene and Roseburg) in 1846 and established a grist mill. As a carpenter, he had built the first river ferry in Polk County in 1844. He also owned the toll road through the Siskiyous, which he sold in the 1860s. Lindsay was appointed special agent for the Modoc Indians in 1861. In 1862, he was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives as a Republican representing Jackson County.1862 Regular Session (2nd). Oregon State Archives. Retrieved on December 15, 2008. In 1865, he was appointed Indian subagent, responsible for treaty negotiations and other U.S. government dealings with the Klamath Indians. The Modoc War in 1872 was between the Modocs and the U.S. Army, just after Applegate had retired from his post. In January 1873, along with several other settlers, including Samuel Asahel Clark and R. H. Kincaid, Lindsay successfully proposed a peace commission to stop the war's spread. Later years and legacy Lindsay retired to Ashland in 1869. He died on November 28, 1892, in either Klamath Falls or Ashland, He was survived by sons Elisha, Jesse A., Oliver, Ivan, and Lucien, and daughters Alice and Rachel. He had five other children who died before he did: Warren (who drowned in the Columbia River), Theresa, Annie, Frank and Jerome. His wife, Elizabeth, died in 1882. He wrote Notes and Reminiscences of Laying Out and Establishing the Old Emigrant Road into Southern Oregon in the Year 1846. Lindsay Applegate is the namesake to the Applegate River in Oregon.

Brooks, Earth Revisited, Boston, Arena Publishing Co., 1893. It is one entrant in the large body of utopian and speculative fiction that characterized the later 19th and early 20th centuries.Kenneth Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Matthew Beaumont, Utopia Ltd.: Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England 1870-1900, Leiden, Brill Academic Publishers, 2005. Genre Brooks sends his protagonist from the late 19th century into the future to experience a vastly improved world. His novel is one of a stream of such books that appeared in the late 19th century. Edward Bellamy's Looking Backward (1888) was the most famous, popular, and influential of these; and Earth Revisited has been dismissively called \\"One of the stepchildren\\" of Bellamy's book.Everett Franklin Bleiler with Richard Bleiler, Science-Fiction: The Early Years, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1990; p. 86. Yet Brooks's novel can be usefully compared to an earlier work in the genre, John Macnie's The Diothas (1883). Both books share some particular ideas (like communal food preparation for private homes); and the concept of reincarnation is fundamental to both, which is not typical of the utopian literature of the era as a whole. Like many other utopian novels, Earth Revisited also verges on science fiction in its anticipation of future technologies. Notably, Brooks envisions contact with intelligent life on the planet Mars: topographic features are engineered as signals between the planets. (On the Earth, a large equilateral triangle, a hundred miles per side, is constructed in the Great Plains.)Earth Revisited, pp. 75-6, 95. Brooks also foresees a vast land reclamation project that turns the Sahara Desert into a region of lakes and farmland.Earth Revisited, pp. 96, 240. Society and technology Brooks anticipates a number of developments that would come about in the decades after his book, including a juvenile justice system that is empowered to remove children from homes with unsuitable parents. Technologically, he equips his future with electric cars and dirigible-like aircraft called \\"anemons.\\" He envisions electricity generated with solar power.Earth Revisited, pp. 88-90. He predicts color photography and advances in electronic communications.

Spiritualism In his novel, author Brooks goes farther than most utopian writers of his generation (including Macnie) ever did in uniting the utopian genre with elements of the spiritualism that was popular in his era.Samuel Weil, The Religion of the Future: or, Outlines of Spiritual Philosophy, Boston, Arnea Publishing, 1893. One contemporaneous source classified his book as a \\"spiritual romance.\\"Catalogue of English Prose Fiction, Including Juveniles and Translations, Brooklyn, NY, Brooklyn Public Library, 1894; p. 28. Brooks uses several elements of spiritualism in his book, including hypnotism, somnambulism, clairvoyance, mediumship, and automatic writing; reincarnation and life after death are important themes. Brooks concludes his book with a long discussion of religious and theological matters. Every novelist who wants to send his hero into the future has to decide on a means of doing so. For Bellamy, hypnosis does the trick, while the anonymous author of The Great Romance administers a \\"sleeping draught\\" to his character. Brooks chose what is arguably the most radical approach: he has his hero die, and then awaken in the body of another man living a century later. Synopsis The novel delivers the story of Herbert Atheron in a first-person narrative. In 1892 he is a successful businessman, married, the father of a son and daughter. Though not yet 50 years old, he has contracted a fatal illness; at the start of the book, he is dying. He re-evaluates his life, to reach a grim conclusion: he feels that he has wasted his life by concentrating on business and neglecting the personal and familial matters that count most. He especially regrets the loss of his first love, a woman named Theresa, who died young after he abandoned her. On his deathbed, he feels himself \\"alone in the vast vacuity of space, a naked, shivering soul. A deep darkness of horror engulfed me. I could endure no more.\\"Earth Revisited, p. 22. When he regains consciousness, he finds himself in the body of a 27-year-old man named Harold Amesbury. He discovers that it is now a hundred years later; Amesbury has been ill and delirious for three months. His fianc√©e, Helen Newcome, is overjoyed at his recovery -- but stunned when he reveals his identity as Atherton. Helen determines to nurse Herbert/Harold back to mental health. She leads him out into the world, where he confronts the vast changes of the intervening century, and beholds the \\"bewildering magnificence and beauty\\"Earth Revisited, p. 42. -- of Brooklyn in 1992. Helen Newcome brings the protagonist to her inventor father; together, the two Newcomes guide the confused time traveller in the realities of 1992. Society has enjoyed vast improvement in the intervening century: the city of Columbia, formerly New York, is cleaner, better organized, more peaceful, healthier, and generally better than before. Electrification and mechanization have brought widespread prosperity, and the extremes of wealth and poverty have been levelled. Government has assumed more responsibility: all land is owned by the state, and people lease the sites of their palatial houses. Newcome the inventor concentrates on improving food production; he receives a stipend from the state, and his inventions go to benefit society as a whole. Brooks does not dwell on the larger political organization of society, though he indicates the world is dominated by the United States of America and a \\"United States of Europe.\\"Earth Revisited, p. 281. War is a thing of the past. Brooks blends the technical and the spiritual: when Newcome shows the protagonist the new \\"harmonic telegraph,\\" Atherton/Amesbury speculates about the possibilities of both radio and telepathy.Earth Revisited, pp. 192-202. The second half of the book is dominated by spiritual matters. The protagonist has a rough adjustment to his strange situation, and obsesses over his lost Theresa. Helen Newcome grows distressed at her limited ability to help her fianc√©, and leaves for a trip abroad. Atherton/Amesbury boards with a widow and her children. The daughter of the house, Irene, was used as an experimental subject in hypnotism by her late physician father; she is a spontaneous medium and clairvoyant. Irene leads the protagonist on an aerial journey to the now-lush Sahara, where he is re-united with Helen. Through psychic visions, the two come to understand that Helen is the lost Theresa reincarnated. They are happily married in the end. The author Byron Alden Brooks (1845-1911) was a native New Yorker, born in the small town of Theresa (a name that he employs for important characters in Earth Revisited). He was educated at Wesleyan University, graduating in 1871. Brooks was a teacher, journalist, and inventor as well as the author of several other literary works. His first book was King Saul (1876). As an inventor, he produced improvements in typewriters and linotype machines; his most notable innovation was probably the first typewriter that could shift between upper- and lower-case letters.The National Cyclopedia of American Biography, Vol. 3, New York, James T. White, 1893; p. 319. He held approximately thirty patents (in printing, telegraph and type-forming machines) and published several novels, among other works.Haddock, John A The Growth of a Century: As Illustrated in the History of Jefferson County, New York, from 1793 to 1894, Printed by Sherman & Co. 1894.

It was located along Bathurst Street in the Bathurst Manor neighbourhood of Toronto and had over 100 programs and services, serving daycare to stroke recovery, seniors, Maccabi athletes, and campers. The BJCC was run by a non-profit charitable organization funded through UJA Federation, United Way, the government, fees and private support.Jewish Info History The BJCC was founded in 1930 as the YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association), and it offered members various programming opportunities in rented rooms in the Brunswick Avenue and College Street area in downtown Toronto. In 1953 a new facility was built, the Bloor Street \\"Y\\" at Bloor Street and Spadina Avenue. It is still there today, but has been completely renovated and is now called the Miles Nadal JCC.UJA As Toronto's Jewish community moved northward up the Bathurst Street corridor, so did the Jewish facilities and services. In 1958 saw the groundbreaking of the North \\"Y\\", which was the location of the Bathurst Jewish Community Centre. In addition to a fitness club, two pools, squash courts, gyms, running tracks, and an aerobics studio, the BJCC contained the Leah Posluns Theatre, Centre Camp, Kolel: The Adult Centre for Liberal Jewish Learning, the Family Resource Centre, and the Koffler Centre of the Arts. The BJCC property is currently under a large redevelopment. The new facility will be called the Prosserman JCC and is being constructed in phases. =Koffler Centre of the Arts= Opened in 1977 inside the BJCC, the \\"Koffler Centre of the Arts\\" is a broad-based cultural institution that was established by Murray and Marvelle Koffler. The Koffler Centre teaches dance, music, and visual arts; presents exhibitions of cutting-edge contemporary Canadian art; and is home to the Helen and Stan Vine Canadian Jewish Book Awards, the Annual Jewish Book Fair, the Koffler Chamber Orchestra, and the Stars of the 21st Century Gala. It presents concerts, film screenings, poetry, spoken word, comedy, and discussions on world issues through the lens of culture. =Leah Posluns Theatre= =Centre Camp= =Lipa Green Centre for Jewish Community Services= While not part of the BJCC, the Lipa Green Centre for Jewish Community Services shared the same property but was a separate building. The redevelopment plans call for all buildings to be connected by bridges and atriums with the Lipa Green Centre itself having just undergone a major renovation. =Sherman Campus Project= In 2007, the UJA of Greater Toronto announced plans to demolish the BJCC and build a newer, more advanced, and larger complex on the same site. The name given to the lot and the all of the proposed buildings therein was the \\"Sherman Campus\\". In 2009 the BJCC was demolished and in its place started construction on the Prosserman Jewish Community Centre. The first phase (The Donald Gales Family Pavilion) was completed in 2010. The first phase of the Prosserman Centre is considerably smaller than the BJCC and offers very limited programming. It is the current home to the Koffler gallery for the arts, and has absorbed many of the employees and programs offered by the BJCC, however, many more people were laid off when the building was demolished. The Prosserman JCC currently houses a limited health centre. UJA continues to fundraise to begin the second phase of construction.

Recent studies suggest they may represent Tydeus and Amphiaraus from a larger group of the Seven against Thebes. * The Head of a Philosopher from Porticello is a rare example of Greek portraiture * The marble Reggio Kouros is a recent acquisition by the museum (shown at the 2006 Winter Olympics at Turin as the archetype of a victorious Greek athlete) * A marble head of Apollo, from Cir√≤ * The group of the Dioscuri falling from their horse in the battle of Sagra, from Locri Epizefiri * The bronze tables, from the archive of the temple of Zeus at Locri Epizefiri * The vast collection of pinakes, terracotta ex votos/ with the rape of Persephone from Locri Epizefiri * A rich collection of jewellery, bronze mirrors, coins and medals. The city art gallery or Pinacotaca comunale was housed in the Museum until a dedicated structure for it was completed in 2008. It includes the two St. Jerome and Abraham panels by Antonello da Messina. = Palazzo Piacentini = The building was designed by Marcello Piacentini (from whom it takes its name) and built between 1932 and 1941. Characterised by its massive volume and monumentality, it consists of a ground floor in 'bugnato' black lava stone, linking the different heights of the Corso Garibaldi and the Via Vittorio Veneto. On this rest grand travertine pilasters and large windows for the first floor exhibition galleries. These large windows make the galleries open, airy and light and allow smoother and more continuous routes between them. On the main facade is a series of large illustrations of the ancient currencies of the cities of Magna Graecia. After the opening many rooms on the ground floor were also opened to the public as galleries (though not designed as such) and today the Museum occupies all the available space on all the floors (three floors and a basement). = Floors = * ground floor: :Prehistory and Protohistory, with objects from Calabria :the first of two sections on the colonies of Magna Grecia,The Magna Grecia collections are so large they have to be displayed on two floors with objects from digs at Locri Epizephiri; * first floor: :section part of the section on colonies, with objects from digs at Rhegion, Matauros, Medma, Kaulon, and other digs in progress; :numismatics; :Roman and Byzantine; * second floor: :the Pinacoteca comunale, awaiting a dedicated building; * basement: :underwater archaeology section, set up in 1981, including a vast collection of anchors and amphorae as well as the Riace bronzes and the Porticello Bronzes. History of the museum The Real Palazzina, series of buildings that housed the original Museo Civico. The origins of the Museo Nazionale di Reggio Calabria dates back to 1882 with the foundation of the Museo Civico which, in the new climate of national unity, collected and spread culture to local people by exhibiting paintings, objects of local history and culture, archeological finds, and mementoes of Il Risorgimento. This formed the Museo Civico di Reggio, based in the seafront Palazzo Arcivescovile and formed of ethnology, medieval art, modern art, Risorgimento art and numismatic departments. In 1907 the Soprintendenza Archeologica della Calabria was founded under the leadership of the famous archaeologist Paolo Orsi - it carried out intense excavations at Reggio, Locri, and in the main centres of archeological interest in Calabria. After the earthquake of 1908, which destroyed the city, Paolo Orsi suggested the creation of a National Museum, to exhibit objects from state excavations alongside those from Reggio's city collections. The Soprintendenza Archeologica was set up in 1925 in Reggio and in 1932 it initiated construction of the building for the Museo Centrale della Magna Grecia or Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia. It was designed by Marcello Piacentini, one of the most famous Italian architects of the first half of the 20th century, who created Italy's first purpose-built museum building (rather than a museum set up in an existing building). Its first stone was blessed by archbishop Carmelo Pujia, and then laid by the prince of Piedmont, with the following letter walled into it: :\\"In the august presence of HRH Umberto and Maria Jos√® of Savoy, with solemn ritual and popular celebration, during the month of May in the tenth year of the Fascist Era,In imitation of the French Republican calendar, each year of the Fascist Era ran from 29 October to 28 October, with the first such year running from 1922 to 1923. [this museum was] given to the Fatherland by Benito Mussolini. [Umberto] laid the first stone of this Museum, whose treasures survived great destructive adversities and perpetuate the Millennial civilisation of the First Italy.¬´ Alla presenza Augusta delle LL.AA.RR. Umberto e Maria Jos√® di Savoia, in solenne rito e tripudio di popolo, nel Decimo Maggio dell'Era Fascista, data alla Patria da Benito Mussolini. √à posata la prima pietra di questo Museo, dove tesori sopravvissuti alle tante avversit√† distruttrici perpetuano la civilt√† Millenaria della Prima Italia ¬ª\\" The new building opened in 1932 but closed on the outbreak of the Second World War, which led to its objects being transferred to safer locations. The new headquarters were inaugurated in 1932 but they had to be closed up because of the war, which forced the transfer of the materials to safer sites. In 1954, the collections of the Museo Civico were reunited with those of the Museo Nazionale, which was re-opened to the public in 1959. In 1962, the prehistory, protohistory and Locri rooms were opened, whilst the lapidary gallery and art gallery were opened in 1969 and the numismatic gallery in 1973. After the very important find of the Riace Bronzes (which, along with the Head of a Philosopher, have contributed to the museum's reputation) an underwater archaeology gallery was created in 1981, dedicated to the memory of superintendent Giuseppe Foti, who died just before its opening. In 1982 the galleries on the Greek colonies and Ionic and Tyrrhenian sub-colonies were re-arranged, thus opening the first and second floor to the public and adding 40 more galleries. There are now plans to move the medieval and modern art galleries (currently on the second floor) to another building to make room for thematic archaeological displays which are in preparation. The museum is currently divided into six sections and an art gallery, arranged in chronological and topographic order and spread over 4 floors. Collections The entrance is from Piazza De Nava and the visitor is immediately welcomed by the view of a tuff Telamone, coming from a public building from the 2nd century BC and found at Montescaglioso. =Prehistory and Protohistory= This section, which was recently reorganized with modern didactical criteria and with the construction of various rooms, collects Calabrian materials of sure date and origin, prehistoric findings (which come from stratified excavations) presented in chronological order through the documentation from the different sites, and displayed in the long room dedicated to them. The most antique objects, coming from the Lower Paleolithic date back to 600,000 years ago, are \\"choppers\\" (splintered rocks), found near Casella di Maida in the center of Calabria. At the entrance of the room are two large dioramas with life scenes from the people of the Middle and Upper Paleolithic. Next, there is the reproduction of the engraving representing the Bos Primigenius a bovid dating back around 11,000 years ago (thus from the final part of the Upper Paleolithic). It was discovered on a boulder in 1961, together with two other smaller figures and many linear signs, at the Riparo del Romito in the municipality of Papasidero, along the river valley Lao, which is at the border with Basilicata. The reproduction of the engraving has a great artistic value (beside its historical value) because the assurance of the line and the tridimensional effect make it the most significant figure, among all those found in the Mediterranean Sea, of the Paleolithic realism. Next to the engraving, simulating what was found at the Romito, a tomb has been recreated, in which one can see the skeletons of two people who have been buried contemporaneously in an unusual position, laying side by side and partially overlapping. The female skeleton laying underneath slips her left arm, as if in an affectionate gesture, around the neck of the young man partially above her who, as it is visible, is deformed by rickets. Maybe these are the skeletons of the guardians, pro tempore, of this sacred place, which has bovine engravings that are the images used during the rites before the hunt. Continuing further we find another diorama constructed to show scenes of life of the Neolithic (8,000- 5,000 years ago), followed by some show windows exhibiting terracotta, bronze, and iron objects, such as: vases, pitchers, calices, ax, swords and fibula, which go from the Neolithic to the next ages, coming from Calabrian places such as: Praia a Mare, Torre Galli, Santa Domenica di Ricadi, Roccella Ionica, Amendolara, Cassano allo Ionio. =Colonies= Lokroi Epizephyrioi (Locri Epizephyrii) =Temples of the contrada Mannella and the casa Marafioti= =Pinakes collection= =Archive of the Temple of Zeus= =Ionic Temple and Dioscuri group= Rhegion (Reggio) =Area Griso-Laboccetta area= =Other excavations= =Chora excavations= =Reggio Kouros= Sub-colonies =Metauros (Gioia Tauro)= =Medma (Rosarno)= =Hipponion (Vibo Valentia)= =Kaulon (Monasterace Marina)= =Laos (Marcellina)= =Krimissa (marine Cir√≤)= =Numismatics= =Roman and Byzantine= =Art gallery= The art collection has been relocated to the Pinacoteca Civica, in the former foyer of the city theatre. =Underwater archaeology= Porticello bronzes =Head of the Basilea= =Head of the philosopher= Riace bronzes =Statue B= Notes  Bibliography  * AAVV.

Carl Mayrhofer was a son of physician, he was recognized as an unusually bright student first at Kremsm√ºnster Gymnasium, then at the Vienna University. One of his colleagues was Ferdinand von Hebra, a close friend of the discoverer of puerperal fever and founder of aseptis Ignaz Semmelweis. Mayrhofer received an MD degree in 1860. In 1862 Mayrhofer was appointed second assistant to professor Carl Braun in the maternity clinic at Vienna General Hospital. Braun advised him to study airborne organisms as the source of childbed fever. As such, Mayrhofer was asked to support the position of Braun in his extremely bitter feud with Ignaz Semmelweis, who claimed that the disease was caused by contaminated hands, in effect blaming doctors for the horrific mortality rates at the time (i.e. that it was an iatrogenic disease). In 1863 Mayrhofer published the first paper on his findings, followed by several lectures in 1864. In these works he referred to Jacob Henle, Pasteur and Bassi, claiming that some living ferments caused the infections. Braun helped the assistant to get a new powerful microscope, with its help he successfully observed and described various microorganisms of different sizes, shapes and motility. He referred to these organisms as vibrions. Finally he identified one vibrion, the most abundant and constantly present in victims of childbed fever. It was motile, had more or less stable shape, fermented sugar and couldn‚Äôt survive in acids. Experiments on rabbits proved that injection of these vibrions caused puerperal fever and death. At first, Mayrhofer's work supported Braun's views and the results were published. The publications of 1864 were a success, but ‚Äúattracted universal attention <...> not in a positive sense only‚Äù. The medical establishment resisted young doctor‚Äôs ideas as much as it resisted Semmelweis' theory in the 1850s. In an 1865 publication Mayrhofer concluded that infection was usually the result of contaminated hands thus rejecting Braun's concept and supporting Ignaz Semmelweis' rivalling theory. Openly disagreeing with his superior, his fate was sealed. Mayrhofer's work was rejected and he soon left the clinic. He entered into private practice, very successful in its beginning. He was appointed privatdozent of obstetrics in 1870, and a few years later adjunct professor within the same field. In late 1870s several disasters struck him one after another: he got lymphangitis, lost two children, got addicted to morphine. In 1878 he moved to Russia, where he worked first at Tbilisi, then in St Petersburg. He faced numerous disappointments and frustrations, lost all interest in life and eventually died from long sickness in Franzensbad.

New York. 1991  History of the Term  In 1854, the Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini coined the term \\"vibrions\\" in a paper he published during the third Cholera pandemic arguing that they were the main agents causing cholera. He drew his conclusion from his observations of the thin, wormlike bacteria present in the blood and stool of cholera patients, especially characteristic of late-stage infections. The Vibrio cholerae identified by Pacini were rediscovered by Robert Koch in 1884, who was unaware of Pacini's work; he called them ‚ÄúComma Bacillus‚Äù and received worldwide fame as a result of his discovery. The term ‚Äúvibrion‚Äù was subsequently used by Louis Pasteur in 1861 in naming a bacterium he discovered, Vibryon butyrique, which was capable of surviving in an environment without oxygen. This bacterium was then identified as the same bacterium which had been discovered by two other scientists and renamed Clostridium butyricum. By the 20th century \\"vibrion\\" came to be used as a general term for motile microorganisms with an elongated, wormlike shape associated with pathogenic illnesses such as cholera and tetanus. It was also incorporated in the names created for several bacteria by microbiologists at the time, such as in the name \\"Vibrion septique\\" from a 1922 paper in The Journal of Medical Research. In an issue of the journal Modern Medicine from 1893, the term \\"cholera vibrion\\" is used to refer to Vibrio cholerae. In the same journal from 1893, the term \\"vibrion\\" is said to be dated, which highlights the brevity of the time period in which the word was used. The term \\"vibrion\\" was out of use by the late 1920s and does not appear on its own in subsequent biological literature. This is largely due to the more extensive development of bacterial taxonomy towards the turn of the 19th century, which gave bacteriologists a more specific way to classify microorganisms. The term \\"vibrion\\" was adapted into the name of the Vibrio prokaryotic genus.

It is situated centrally between the towns of Boyle, Elphin and Carrick on Shannon. History The village dates from the late 1700s and was set up by then local landlord Lloyd. The Lloyd family were granted the lands of Croghan which originally were owned by the Mcdermott's in 1680. Lloyd built a house in the 1700s where the GAA Club Rooms now stand, and in 1830 built a larger mansion nearby. Croghan village consisted of 30 houses all facing east towards the big house in a north-south direction. The only building on the other side of street was Donnellan's shop (1765), which in 1796 became the Roman Catholic Church. Croghan is now the parish name for this area incorporating the old parishes of Killukin, Killumod, Tumna, Kilcola and Estersnow. These were former monastic sites dating back up to 1500 years. Croghan was an agriculture area, and under encouragement of Guy Lloyd, fairs were set up after Trinity Sunday and 28 October, which were famous throughout west of Ireland for Croghan Shorthorn and continued till 1970. In 1898, the Croghan Co Operative Creamery was set up, being the second in Connacht and it flourished for 90 years. Today, Croghan has a six-teacher national school, three housing estates, and a tidy towns committee. In 1861, the Church of Ireland was opened and the creamery is now a centre for the community.

Yamamoto was an Eagle Scout in troop 12 and attended Lowell High School, graduating in 1935. After starting in aeronautical engineering, Yamamoto switched to art at UC Berkeley graduating with a Masters of Art in 1941. This was before the advent of the Masters of Fine Art.

After a first trial in absentia in 2003, one failed and two successful escapes and two extraditions (from South Africa and Canada), dos Santos was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment in January 2006. Dos Santos maintained his innocence throughout the trial. As of April, 2008, dos Santos remained in Mozambican custody and was investigated in another attempted murder case, that of BCM lawyer Albano Silva. December 7, 2008, dos Santos escaped from a maximum security Maputo jail for a third time. On the next day, the news media reported that dos Santos was arrested 36 hours after escape, but on December 10 a police spokesperson denied these reports, saying that dos Santos was still at large. After eight months at large, in August 2009 dos Santos was recaptured in South Africa. Background In November 2000, white Mozambican Carlos Cardoso, 49, editor of the Metical daily newspaper specializing in investigating corruption, was investigating an alleged $14 million fraud at the Central Bank of Mozambique (BCM). On November 22, 2000, nearly 15 minutes after speaking to BBC reporters, he left his Maputo office in a car and was ambushed on the Avenue of the Martyrs by gunmen who blocked his escape routes with two cars. Later, trial judges adopted the version of events that dos Santos was driving the stolen ambush car that overtook Cardoso's Toyota and forced it to the curb; the shots were fired by another suspect. Witnesses said the shooters fired 10 shots, killing Cardoso and injuring his driver. The murder occurred two weeks after 26 people were killed in riots; Cardoso reported on the incident and was highly critical of both leading political parties' actions preceding the clashes. The murder and funeral of Cardoso \\"produced a rare show of unity among political opponents\\"; president Joaquim Chissano and opposition leaders vowed to solve the murder. In May 2001 six men were charged with the murder. Initial reports stated that \\"a prominent businessman\\" and a bank manager were charged with contracting the murders and four men were charged with carrying out the murder. Later, Western media reported dos Santos was one of the four, the mastermind of the murder. Media reports of dos Santos' \\"normal\\" activities range from a petty car dealer to a car thief. First escape August 31, 2002, dos Santos escaped from a jail in Maputo, despite specific warnings of an upcoming escape attempt reported to the Minister of the Interior. Unidentified police officers on the case said that \\"everything was done at the highest level to facilitate the escape and make a trial impossible\\". Dos Santos' lawyer expressed fears that dos Santos might already be dead and \\"there were reports of bloodstains in his client's cell\\". Actually, dos Santos escaped to South Africa on a false Swazi passport. Seven low-level prison guards were tried and acquitted in connection with the escape. The whereabouts of dos Santos remained unknown until November 22, 2002. First trial and extradition The trial against the five present suspects and the missing dos Santos began November 18, 2002. Court sessions were broadcast on national TV. Three of the suspects identified Nyimpine Chissano, son of the president, as the man behind the murder. Nyimpine Chissano appeared in court and refuted all allegations. Soon after the trial commenced, the mother of dos Santos announced that her son was safely living in London. She said dos Santos \\"was helped to flee to London in order to prevent him from testifying\\",; she also claimed that he was innocent and ready to return to Mozambique and testify if given security guarantees. Dos Santos was arrested in Pretoria, South Africa, at the end of January 2003, one day before the scheduled pronouncement of court sentence in Maputo. South African authorities immediately announced that extradition would proceed \\"as early as [that] weekend\\". The next day the court declared dos Santos guilty as the mastermind of the crime, and sentenced him to 28 years and six months. Other suspects received up to 23 years. No charges where ever brought against Chissano family members. In the end of 2003 three of the convicts, but not dos Santos, were reported to be involved in court proceedings against the fraud at the Central Bank -- the last case of Carlos Cardoso. Second escape and extradition According to the Ministry of Interior statement, \\"On 9 May 2004 Anibal dos Santos Junior disappeared from his cell.\\" Anonymous sources at the prison said that dos Santos was \\"actually taken out of the jail by accomplices\\". The escape occurred when the court was preparing to pronounce verdicts against 15 suspects involved in the 1996 bank fraud case. In the middle of May Canadian authorities detained dos Santos at the Toronto Pearson International Airport. Mozambican authorities immediately requested extradition although Canada and Mozambique did not have an extradition treaty; international press organizations called on the Canadian government to \\"expedite [the] return of dos Santos\\" too. Dos Santos applied for political asylum in Canada, stalling the extradition process for half a year. Authorities persuaded dos Santos to drop the request for asylum in exchange for a fair retrial in Mozambique, an option open to anyone sentenced in absentia to more than two years in jail. The Mozambique court confirmed the convict's right to retrial. On December 14, 2004, Canadian authorities approved extradition, and dos Santos finally departed for Mozambique on January 21, 2005, arriving in Maputo the next day. Reporters without borders and other press organizations celebrated the capture. Second trial The second trial against dos Santos commenced December 1, 2005. Three days before the trial, dos Santos was caught preparing to make a third escape. The attempt was thwarted by a new guard, recently transferred to the jail. Dos Santos immediately pleaded innocent and not guilty and said that his previous statements on the Cardoso case had been the result of manipulation by his former defence lawyer. Dos Santos exonerated Nyimpine Chissano from any association with the murder and identified the Satar family members, already convicted at the 2002-2003 trial, as his principal clients. The trial pronounced dos Santos guilty on all nine counts and increased the sentence to 30 years. Media reports commented that the trial did not solve many incident questions on the extent of dos Santos' connections in Mozambique politics and that dos Santos' decision not to appeal the sentence was an indicator of another jailbreak being planned. His court-appointed lawyer explained that his client feared that the appellate court could increase the jail term further. 2008 trial In April 2008 dos Santos was in court again, this time as a defendant for the murder of BCM lawyer Albano Silva. His statement to the court addressed the 2000 Cardoso murder; this time, contrary to his past statements, dos Santos directly pointed at Nyimpine Chissano (by then deceased) as the ultimate client. According to the new statements by dos Santos, Chissano initially contacted him on to hire a car; commentators expressed disbelief that such a petty business could grow into a murder contract. The alleged \\"recruiter\\" identified by dos Santos has also died, leaving nobody to denounce or corroborate his story. He also made a statement that the late Chissano protected him in Maputo prison: \\"I never escaped, I was taken out\\". Dos Santos refuted all allegations of the Albano Silva case, despite objective evidence showing his regular communications with the other suspects in the case prior to the murder. Third escape On December 7, 2008, dos Santos escaped from a maximum security Maputo prison for a third time, together with two other notable gangsters. The next day, the media reported that dos Santos was arrested 36 hours after escape. According to Reporters without borders, he was apprehended 75 kilometers from Maputo, on the road to the border with Swaziland. However, on December 10 a police spokesperson denounced these reports, saying that dos Santos was still at large. The opposition requested that the national parliament summon executive ministers for an explanation, but the proposal was turned down by majority vote. Police officials, again, expressed regret over the incident, while the right-wing Zambese newspaper hailed dos Santos as a hero defying incompetent police. In a period of less than a week ending December 17, three high-ranking Maputo police officers were killed. Police chief Pinto said that the murders may be connected to the escapees, however, it was not clear which of the three escapees is considered most dangerous. Ministry of Interior General Zinocacossa has openly blamed police for the escape: \\"Anibalzinho was released by police commanders ... They, there in the police, they're mixed up with Anibalzinho, and now they want to involve me\\". On December 30, 2008, the Mozambican Interior ministry dismissed top-ranking police commanders for their part in the December 7 escape. It was reported that the officials visited Anibalzinho on the day before the escape and did nothing about the hole in the corridor wall that was used by the fugitives. . Recapture On August 26, 2009, the Mozambican authorities confirmed the recapture of Anibal dos Santos in South Africa.

It is home to several large employers such as PPL and The Morning Call and is host to city, county, and federal government centers. While downtown is no longer considered the premier regional shopping destination of the Lehigh Valley, dozens of small businesses and several prominent restaurants and nightclubs, including Robato of Tokyo, The Bay Leaf, the Allentown Brewworks, the Sterling, and others are located here. An ongoing effort to revitalize this area is progressing partially through the introduction of high-end loft apartments and townhouses, as well as an application to the commonwealth by the city and the Chamber of Commerce for \\"Main Street\\" designation. Downtown Allentown has been the beneficiary of the NIZ (Neighborhood Improvement Zone), a tax increment financing district that financed the construction of the PPL Arena at 7th and Hamilton as well as numerous other buildings in center city.http://www.allentownpa.gov/Neighborhood-Improvement-Zone * Arts District One of the anchors of downtown Allentown is its arts district between North 5th and North 6th Streets. The district is home to fine cultural arts and entertainment venues such as the Allentown Art Museum, the Baum School of Art, Allentown Symphony Hall, and most recently the Allentown Arts Park. The Arts District Master Plan was completed in 2004 for the purpose of providing a strategy for the district to grow and further develop its potential. * \\"\\"Jordan Creek\\"\\"NOTI (North of Tilghman) (Jordan Creek through 7th Street east to west north of Tilghman Street to the city line) This area is mainly residential. This area has had historically higher poverty rates than the surrounding neighborhoods. Prices of properties here are especially affordable and in recent years this neighborhood has been a magnet for working artists. * Old Allentown Historic District (8th through 12th Streets east to west, and Linden through Liberty Streets south to north) The Old Allentown Historic District was established on September 6, 1978 by City Ordinance #12314 and was certified by the Pennsylvania State Historical and Museum Commission on September 26, 1978. The neighborhood was laid out in the original plan for Allentown by order of William Allen in 1762, and developed as the City grew northward and westward and today contains a mix Federal, Italianate, Eastlake and Victorian housing styles. Old Allentown now is also the home of the United Way's Allentown Promise Neighborhood initiative, modeled on the work of Geoffrey Canada and the Harlem Children's Zone. The Allentown Promise Neighborhood takes a systems approach to improving the academic performance and the college and career readiness of the children in its nine block area. The City, in association with the Old Allentown Preservation Association, is a participant in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Elm Street program. Covering the Old Allentown neighborhood, the Elm Street program's goals are to: * Revitalize neighborhoods in proximity to the existing downtown by improving the exterior appearance of the buildings and streetscape. * Formalize a connection between established residential neighborhood areas with downtown revitalization activities. * Prevent neighborhood decline by developing a plan that includes the establishment of a sustainable community organization that will implement a five-year strategy. * Assist municipalities in preparing and implementing a revitalization strategy for established residential neighborhoods either in the vicinity of a Main Street Program project or in proximity to an existing commercial district. * The Old Allentown program has an Advisory Committee that executes an annual work plan based on the Old Allentown Neighborhood Improvement Plan, prepared with the assistance of the Bureau of Planning. The program's activities are managed by four committees, Organization, Promotion, Clean Safe and Green, Design, and Neighborhood Restructuring. A program manager assists in the program's implementation. Efforts of the Old Allentown Preservation Association may be followed on their website: oldallentown.org or on their blog at: oldallentown.blogspot.com The City plan which outlines the effort can be found on the Allentown City website at: https://web.archive.org/web/20110522111217/http://www.allentownpa.gov/Portals/0/OpenDocLibraryRoot/Planning_Zoning/OLDALLENTOWNPLAN.PDF * Jordan Heights/Old Fairgrounds (N. 5th and 6th Streets from Gorden to Tilghman Streets south to north) The Old Fairgrounds Historic District was established on July 8, 1981 by City Ordinance #12314 and was certified by the Pennsylvania State Historical and Museum Commission on September 9, 1981. The district takes its name from the use of the area as the Lehigh County Agricultural Society's fairgrounds from 1852-1888. After the Society moved the fairgrounds to its current location at 17th and Chew Streets the land was auctioned off to developers. The area was developed in a mixture of housing styles with Victorian the most common.

The network, which operated nightly on the channel space of Nickelodeon, focused mainly on fine arts programming. It merged with The Entertainment Channel in 1984 to become the Arts and Entertainment Network (A&E;). History =Early history= By the early 1980s, cable television had reached millions of American households and was starting to draw significant audiences away from the \\"Big Three\\" broadcast television networks. All three networks saw opportunities to expand into cable television in order to protect and grow their audiences, and they all experimented with niche programming. In fact, all three traditional networks introduced arts-related channels within one year of each other. CBS launched CBS Cable in 1981, which focused on \\"art house\\" and critical acclaimed programs; NBC, meanwhile, launched the similarly formatted The Entertainment Channel. ABC partnered with the Hearst Corporation to create its own arts-oriented service, the Alpha Repertory Television Service. ARTS launched on April 12, 1981, focusing on highbrow cultural fare such as opera, ballet, classical symphonic performances, dramatic theater productions and select foreign films (besides CBS Cable and The Entertainment Channel, ARTS also competed with Bravo and the Public Broadcasting Service). Many cable providers had limited channel bandwidth at that time over their headends; as a result, CBS Cable struggled to find channel carriage and an audience, eventually folding in late 1982. However, while ARTS fared no better in finding viewers, it shared channel space with Nickelodeon, signing on at 9:00 p.m. Eastern Time after the children's television network ended its broadcast day. That shared channel arrangement was a perfect symbiotic scheduling match for the two networks given their respective audience demographics (the target viewership of ARTS either did not have young children or had sent them to bed by the time the channel began its programming). ARTS had somewhat lower programming costs than CBS Cable, with fewer (and less costly) original programs. Prime time was normally the most valuable airtime, but not for Nickelodeon ‚Äì ARTS paid a very low rate to that network for its three evening satellite transponder hours, plus a repeat broadcast at 9:00 p.m. Pacific Time (according to Hearst executive Raymond Joslin, ARTS did not pay Nickelodeon at all for the first year, and paid a $1 million fee for the second year and $2 million for the third). Most cable providers that carried Nickelodeon also carried ARTS simply because of the convenience of the single channel feed. These factors combined to help keep the channel on the air more than twice as long as CBS Cable. Nonetheless, despite having a small but affluent audience ostensibly attractive to advertisers, Hearst/ABC could not turn a profit on ARTS. The network had carried limited advertising each hour, typically carrying low-key commercials for luxury products and services; often advertising slots went unfilled. =Merger with The Entertainment Channel and relaunch as A&E;= NBC had been facing a similar problem in finding a sufficiently large audience for its cable network The Entertainment Channel, which launched in 1982 and aired such expensive programming as BBC cultural imports from the United Kingdom and live broadcasts from Lincoln Center. Hearst/ABC Video Services and NBC ultimately decided to merge ARTS and The Entertainment Channel to form a single service, the Arts & Entertainment Network (A&E;), which launched on February 1, 1984; ABC would exit the partnership soon afterward (ironically, The Walt Disney Company, which bought ABC, in 1996 would later acquire an ownership interest in A&E; in the early 1990s). A&E; took over the transponder space held by ARTS, as well as that network's timeslot over Nickelodeon's channel space. That summer, A&E; announced that it would move the network to its own dedicated transponder and become a separate 24-hour cable channel to take better advantage of valuable satellite time. The move took place on January 1, 1985, with Nickelodeon expanding part of its programming schedule to fill the time period formerly held by A&E; with more teen-oriented programming and displaying a test pattern screen after the network signed off later in the evening. As a result of A&E;'s separation from Nickelodeon, MTV Networks President Bob Pittman commissioned Geraldine Laybourne, who served as general manager of Nickelodeon at the time, to develop programming to fill the vacated time period. Laybourne asked programming and branding consultants Fred Seibert and Alan Goodman, founders of Fred/Alan Inc. (who launched successful branding campaigns for MTV when it launched in 1981, and for Nickelodeon in 1984), to come up with programming ideas. Seibert and Goodman came up with the idea to launch a nighttime block of classic television series, modeled after the \\"Greatest Hits of All Time\\" oldies radio format, after being presented with over 200 episodes of the 1950s sitcom The Donna Reed Show. On July 1, 1985, Nick at Nite launched over Nickelodeon's channel space in the 8:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Eastern and Pacific time period, featuring reruns of classic television series from the 1950s to the 1970s. To this day, A&E; survives as one of the most popular cable channels in the U.S. However while it retained the same arts-focused programming for its first decade-and-a-half as a merged channel, A&E;'s programming has gradually evolved to bear little or no resemblance to its progenitors (aka \\"channel drift\\"), shifting its focus in recent years towards reality, lifestyle and scripted drama series.

It was started as a propaganda initiative in the aftermath of the German occupation to influence left-leaning segments of French public opinion. The Director, Jean Drault, was a French anti-Semite while its editor, Georges Oltramare, was a pro-Nazi Swiss journalist who broadcast on French radio. The extent of German control is evident in that editorial meetings were held directly in the German embassy on the rue de Lille. In style and content, the newspaper mirrored the Communist newspaper L'Humanit√© except for virulent anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic positions. The newspaper was fairly successful with sales of 92,000 in the first weeks rising to 180,000 by August 1940. Exposure by the clandestine Communist press as well as mainstream French newspapers, however, ensured a steady, and then permanent, decline.

Knott encountered difficulties with his walking technique whilst in England prior to the 1948 London Olympics. Knott was disqualified in his walking events at the British AAA's Championships and also at Birmingham. This necessitated Knott correcting his style, which left him well behind in his Games heat. During the London Olympic Games, Knott finished last in his heat of the 10,000 metres walk. After Knott finished his competitive career he became a dedicated and hardworking official, not only for his club Collingwood but also for the State body, the Victorian Amateur Athletic Association. On 5 October 1986, Knott was honoured with the Victorian Athletic Association's highest honour, Life Membership. Further honours came Knott's way when the athletic facility in Heidelberg Road, home to the Collingwood Harriers Athletic Club and the Collingwood Little Athletics Centre was named after George Knott.

She enrolled in the Performing Arts High School of Tampere pursuing her acting, improvisation, and speech. After high school she was accepted into the National Circus School of Montreal, where she trained under their performing arts coaches. Pauliina graduated with a difficult routine of swinging trapeze including an original skill, in which she intentionally dislocates her shoulders while executing a salto around the bar. Cirque du Soleil signed her up as their first Fennoscandian artist, to perform in their production Alegr√≠a. She toured with Cirque du Soleil for 5 years until she decided to leave in pursuit of other goals. While in Cirque du Soleil, Pauliina met her future partner Viatcheslav (Slava) Volkov from Russia. The couple found they shared similar visions in personal life as well as in acrobatics. Together they created a hand-to-hand acrobatic act combining elements of dance, acting, and high-level acrobatics. Their performance music is composed by French accordionist Corinne Kuzma. At the moment the couple lives in Kustavi, a small city in the Southern Archipelago of Finland, and regularly performs in European theaters. R√§s√§nen and Volkov are currently filming a feature film, Circus Fantasticus for Staragara production. Pauliina was also awarded a 5-year grant from the Finnish Central Commission of Arts to continue her artistic goals in Finland. ArtTeatro R√§s√§nen and Volkov own their own Finland-based circus arts company and agency, ArtTeatro Ltd. Its goal is to create intimate, touching, and high-level shows in a family-like atmosphere combining theater and circus arts. Their created a show, Cirque Dracula, will be performed as part of the Turku Culture Capital Event in 2011. The cast includes international performers and singers from Europe and Canada.

Mack founded the Brethren along with seven other Radical Pietists in Schwarzenau in 1708. Mack and the rest of the early Brethren emigrated to the United States in the mid-18th century, where he continued to minister to the Brethren community until his death. Early life and founding of the Brethren Mack's baptism alongside seven other Radical Pietists in the Eder marks the inauguration of the Brethren Mack was born in Schriesheim, Palatinate in contemporary Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany, where he worked as a miller. He was born the third son to miller Johann Phillip Mack and his wife Christina Fillbrun Mack and baptized into the local Reformed church on 27 July 1679. The Macks remained in Schriesheim throughout the Nine Years' War, intermittently seeking refuge in the hill country because of violence. Upon finishing his studies, Mack took over the family mill and married Anna Margarethe Kling on 18 January 1701. By 1705, the Macks became moved by the Pietist movement locally led by Ernst Christoph Hochmann von Hochnau and started to host an illegal Bible study and prayer group at their home. In the early 1700s, Graf (Count) Henrich Albrecht Sayn-Wittgenstein provided refuge to religious dissenters from other German states and elsewhere. Many were settled around the small village of Schwarzenau, including Mack and his followers. The era of toleration for radical Pietism lasted only until ~1740, but had few precedents at the time and was denounced by the rulers of most other German states. Schwarzenau is now part of the town of Bad Berleburg in the district of Siegen-Wittgenstein in the state of Nord Rhein Westfalen. The school (now closed) in Schwarzenau was named in honor of Alexander Mack. The initial group that became known as the Schwarzenau Brethren were inaugurated by Mack as a Bible study with four other men and three women. In 1708‚Äîhaving become convinced of the necessity of Believer's baptism‚Äîthe group decided to baptize themselves, using a lottery system to choose who would baptize one another in the Eder. Emigration to the United States In 1719, a branch of the Schwarzenau Brethren led by Peter Becker emigrated to Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States for religious freedom. Mack and several other Brethren emigrated to Friesland in the Netherlands because of pressure within the interfaith community in Schwarzenau in 1720. However, the Brethren in Friesland were impoverished, and the community was unable to sustain itself. In 1729, Mack and about 30 Brethren families sailed for Germantown. The arrival of the 1729 emigrants immediately brought renewed vitality and new members to the American Brethren, who had become less active since their migration. Mack's leadership was pivotal in sustaining this vitality, and it noticeably slackened upon his death in 1735. Teachings and writings Prior to the formation of any strict doctrine, the Schwarzenau Brethren espoused several fundamental tenets that would define the Brethren movement, including a rejection of any coercion in religion (such as infant baptism), viewing Christian rites and ordinances as a means of grace, and the New Testament as the only creed and Rule of Faith.

History Leyland Titan PD2 in Brighton In 1922 Richard Newell commenced operating a bus service between Seaview and Ryde. By the end of the 1920s Newell had commenced operating charter services.About Us Seaview Services The development of holiday camps at Puckpool and St Clare in the late 1930s boosted business considerably on the bus route as well as providing additional excursion work. The extra revenue created from this was used to fund the purchase of new coaches. In July 1939 Newells (Seaview) Limited was registered, being renamed Seaview Services Limited in July 1942. After the end of World War II trade increased rapidly particularly in connection with the holiday camps. In 1950, the company purchased two new Leyland Titan double deck buses to cope with the increased passenger numbers. In 1980 Seaview Services was sold to Mary Robinson and in December 1981 the company name was renamed A & MA Robinson Seaview Services Limited. The company continued to run route 12 from Seaview to Ryde under RedLynx branding, and in May 1986, (several months before deregulation day) extended this route to Nettlestone, St Helens, Bembridge and Sandown. However this move encouraged Southern Vectis to compete against Seaview Services with a minibus service to Seaview, leading to a bus war between the two firms. After this period of initial competition, in May 1987 Seaview Services retreated back to its previous Seaview to Ryde route and Southern Vectis withdrew its competing service. In 1992 the us side of the business was sold to Southern Vectis and the company has since concentrated solely on coach charters and tours. In 1989 the Seaview garage was sold and a new garage opened in Sandown.

The fuel distributor specialises in national supply of diesel, gas oil, kerosene and lubricants among other fuels and oils to the commercial and domestic market in the United Kingdom. Crown Oil has depots in six locations around the UK, including Bury, Birmingham, Iver, and three in Greater London with the Bury depot being the main depot that the fuel supplier operates from.  History  Crown Oil began trading in 1928 and was owned by Harry Greensmith, affectionately known as \\"Harry Lamp Oil\\". Greensmith traded door-to-door from a wooden cart, providing household goods such as firelighters, candles, and lamp oil (kerosene). After World War II, Greensmith expanded the product range of the company to include the bulk supply of fuels and lubricants.

In 1959, Harry's only son, David Greensmith, joined the family business, and new premises were acquired in the Heap Bridge area of Heywood, where the company is currently located. The distribution of fuels and lubricants became the firm's primary business activity, with red diesel currently making up the majority of business. In 1977 the business was incorporated and the name changed to Crown Oil Limited.

Tank cleaning is also undertaken in order to prevent mechanical failure caused by contaminated diesel. As part of the company's work towards environmental responsibility, all delivery mileage is carbon offset to keep CO2 emissions to a minimum. In 2019, Crown Oil committed further to reducing fossil fuels' environmental impact by turning its attention to hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO fuel), when the company invested ¬£4 million in stocks of the renewable fuel, making it reportedly one of the only suppliers in the UK with a stock of the fuel. HVO fuel is said to be useful for industries such as farming, commercial vehicles and data centres to reduce their carbon emissions. Other CO2-reducing fuels supplied are biodiesel and CHP biofuel.

He was educated at Eton College and Oxford University. In May 1939, Burnell was commissioned into the London Rifle Brigade. He was on the losing Oxford team in The Boat Race in 1939. He was a rowing correspondent for The Times and wrote several books on rowing matters. He competed for Kingston Rowing Club and in 1946 won the Wingfield Sculls. =1948 Summer Olympics= At the 1948 Olympics Burnell won a gold medal with Bert Bushnell in the double sculls, Burnell and Bushnell having never previously trained together. Jack Beresford told Bushnell that he had no chance to win the single sculls, and so created the double sculls team instead. Their differing physiques ‚Äì Burnell was 6 ft 4 inches and weighed stone, while Bushnell was 5 ft 10 inches and stone ‚Äì presented some difficulties in the boat, which Bushnell had to re-rig so that they were able to reach together. The pair only had a month to train for the Games, with animosity between the two due to the difference in their class backgrounds. Bushnell later said in an interview, \\"There was class tension there and it came from me being bloody awkward.\\" Bushnell struck up a friendship with American rower John B. Kelly Jr. and Australian Mervyn Wood. The rowers' diets had been increased from the normal 2,500 calories allowed by rationing to a \\"miner's diet\\" of 3,600. However, the other teams were having food flown in specially to increase their calorie intake and allow them to train more. Bushnell would invite Kelly and Wood over for dinner, with his guests bringing the food. Bushnell and Burnell both attended the opening ceremony of the 1948 Games, something Bushnell described as \\"dreadful\\", as they gave the athletes poorly fitting uniforms and made them stand out in the sun en-masse for three hours. On the Henley Royal Regatta course, they lost to France in the first round, but then won both the rep√™chage followed by the semi-final. On 9 August 1948, in front of a home crowd, Bushnell and Burnell competed in the Olympic final against the double scull teams of Uruguay and Denmark. Bushnell nearly missed the final, held at the Leander Club in Henley- on-Thames, as stewards would not allow him to enter; he later explained \\"You see I wasn't a member then ‚Äì not posh enough\\". At around the three-minute mark, the British team decided to push for the win, eventually taking it in six minutes and 51.3 seconds, two lengths ahead of the favoured Danish duo of Ebbe Parsner and Aage Larsen (6:55.3) and five ahead of Uruguay (7:12.4).Wallechinsky, David and Loucky, Jaime (2012) The Complete Book of the Olympics: 2012 Edition.

Having initially competed in athletics whilst at school, he took up competitive rowing in 1939, and during the Second World War he worked at John I. Thornycroft & Company's shipyard as a marine engineer and was involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk.

His older brother was Leonard John Bushnell (born 19 May 1918; died 1974). The Bushnell family have had a Royal Warrant since before the First World War and this has continued into the present generation with the senior member appointed a Royal Waterman to the reigning British monarch. John Henry Bushnell carried on the business of renting self-propelled rowing boats, dinghies, skiffs, punts, camping punts, until the early 1920s when he obtained electric canoes followed closely by motor-driven launches. Both the motor-propelled craft could be hired for self-drive or with drivers. During this time boat building of various types was carried on at the site and, as years passed, larger and more sophisticated craft were constructed for both sale and hire. In the mid-1930s the first self-drive holiday hire cruiser was built and thereafter others followed up until 1939 when the boatyard took on rapid expansions to cope with Admiralty contracts to build fast motor boats for both Naval and RAF air/sea rescue. Bushnell attended Henley Grammar School where he excelled at sport, including running the 100-yard dash in \\"evens\\" at Palmer Park. In his youth he was coached by sprinter Sandy Duncan. He became an apprentice at ship builders John I. Thornycroft & Company at the age of fourteen at the Southampton Docks. Career Bushnell first competed in rowing in August 1939 at the Maidenhead Regatta. In order to retain his amateur status under the rules of the Amateur Rowing Association, Bushnell was ineligible to work for his father's shipbuilding business as a boat mechanic and instead continued to work for Thornycrofts, becoming a marine engineer. During the Second World War, Bushnell tested motor torpedo boat engines and worked a 52-hour week for ¬£3 10s. He was also involved in the evacuation of Dunkirk. attaining the rank of Chief Petty Officer. Following the war, Bushnell began to compete in rowing once more. At the 1946 Henley Royal Regatta, Bushnell (representing Maidenhead Rowing Club) lost to Burnell in the Diamond Challenge Sculls. While at the Marlow Regatta in 1946, he accepted an offer to travel to Argentina to train and compete there. While in South America in the summer of 1947, he was undefeated in several single scull races on the Rio Tigre and met Juan Per√≥n, President of Argentina, and his wife Eva Per√≥n. He won the Wingfield Sculls in 1947, but lost to Jack Kelly in the semi-final in the Diamond Challenge Sculls in 1947. =1948 Summer Olympics= Bushnell hoped to compete at the 1948 Summer Olympics in the single scull event. However, after he was a distant runner-up by five lengths in the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta on 4 July 1948,Tierney, Frank \\"Five Wins for Australia; British Titles\\", The Sydney Morning Herald (5 July 1948) p.5.W.V.F., \\"Rowing in Britain\\", Western Mail (Perth, WA: 2 December 1948) p.23; \\"Britain Wins Sculls At Olympics\\", Border Watch (Mount Gambier, SA: 10 August 1948) p.1. to Australian policeman Mervyn Wood,\\"Won Skulls\\", Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW: 15 July 1948) p.5. who subsequently won the Olympic singles that year, Bushnell was chosen instead to pair with old Etonian Oxonian rower Dickie Burnell in the Olympic double sculls event, having never previously trained with his new partner. Jack Beresford told Bushnell that there wasn't a chance for him to win the single sculls, and so created the double sculls team instead. Their differing physiques ‚Äî Burnell was 6 ft 4in and weighed 14¬Ω stone, while Bushnell was 5 ft 10in and 10¬Ω stone ‚Äî presented some difficulties in the boat, which Bushnell had to re-rig so that they were able to reach together. Bushnell and Burnell only had a month to train for the Games, with animosity between the two due to the difference in their class backgrounds. Bushnell later said in an interview, \\"There was class tension there and it came from me being bloody awkward.\\" Bushnell struck up a friendship with American rower John B. Kelly Jr. and Australian Merv Wood. The rowers' diets had been increased from the normal 2,500 calories allowed by rationing to a \\"miner's diet\\" of 3,600 calories. However, the other teams were having food flown in specially in order to increase their calorie intake and allow them to train more. Bushnell would invite Kelly and Wood over for dinner, with his guests bringing the food. Bushnell and Burnell both attended the opening ceremony of the 1948 Games, something Bushnell described as \\"dreadful\\", as they gave the athletes poorly fitting uniforms and made them stand out in the sun en-masse for three hours. At the Olympic regatta on the Henley Royal Regatta course, which only measured 1900 metres,\\"Golden Bears Capture Eights Race\\", The Montreal Gazette (10 August 1948) p.15. Bushnell was in the bow and Burnell the stern seat, or as Bushnell indicated later: \\"I was on the bridge and Dickie was in the engine room\\". In an attempt to avoid the favoured Danish duo of Ebbe Parsner and Aage Larsen in the semi-finals, Bushnell and Burnell deliberately came second to France in the first round. According to Bushnell: \\"Dickie decided we should lose the first heat so as not to meet the Danes in the semi-final. ... I wouldn't have had the nerve to do that. We could have won, but we didn't.\\" They subsequently won both the rep√™chage followed by the semi-final. On Monday, 9 August 1948, in front of a home crowd estimated to be 20,000 spectators, Bushnell and Burnell competed in the Olympic final against the double scull teams of Uruguay and Denmark. Bushnell nearly missed the final, held at the Leander Club in Henley, as stewards would not allow him to enter; he later explained \\"You see I wasn't a member then ‚Äì not posh enough\\". At around the three-minute mark, the British team decided to push for the win, eventually taking it in six minutes and 51.3 seconds, 1¬Ω lengths ahead of the favoured Danish duo of Parsner and Larsen (6:55.3) and five ahead of William Jones and Juan A. Rodriguez Iglesias of Uruguay (7:12.4).Solem, Karen Ann, The Rower's Almanac 2004‚Äì2005 (Rower's Almanac, 2004) p.51. On the jetty they were awarded their medals while standing in their socks. As there were no ribbons for the medals due to cost- saving measures, they were given them in presentation boxes while \\"God Save the King\\" was played by a band. Decades later Bushnell indicated in an interview with Janie Hampton: \\"The Olympics didn't feel a big deal. It was like Henley regatta with a few foreigners thrown in.\\"Bert Bushnell, quoted in \\"How the Austerity Olympics struck gold for London\\" Yorkshire Post (13 May 2008). Despite winning an Olympic gold medal, Bushnell returned to his occupation, indicating in an interview: \\"There was no fuss and my life wasn't changed. I went back to work as a marine engineer on Monday. I didn't get paid to have days off and my employers considered I was a bloody nuisance.\\"Bert Bushnell, quoted in Bert Bushnell: \\"I was a bloody nuisance\\", from The Daily Telegraph (19 February 2012). In the 1949 European Championships Bushnell and Burnell finished 5th. In the Henley Royal Regatta of June 1949, Bushnell withdrew from the single sculls to focus on the double sculls.\\"Kelly Draws Bye in Henley Regatta\\", Oakland Tribune (30 June 1949) p.41. However, Bushnell and Burnell were defeated by the Danish team of Parsner and Larsen in the double sculls event in a record-breaking race. Later life In September 1948 Bushnell married Margaret Campbell (born 27 October 1925; died December 1988). They spent the first few years of their married life on a Thames sailing barge, moored up outside the boathouse in Maidenhead. They had three daughters: Patricia Pueschel, Jacqueline Page, and Susan Bushnell, and six granddaughters. After World War II, his father bought a second boatyard at Maidenhead. Later the businesses were split with Bert transferring to Maidenhead, and his older brother Leonard (and later his two sons, Nicholas and Paul) operating the original Wargrave boatyard until Leonard's death in 1974. After retiring from competitive rowing in 1951, Bushnell played association football for Maidenhead United and set up his own boatyard in Maidenhead, that rented cabin cruisers. Bushnell pioneered the development of recirculative \\"pump-out\\" lavatories which freed holidaymakers from elsan emptying and earned him the affectionate nickname \\"Recirc Bert\\". Bushnell was a founder member and later Chairman of the British Hire Cruiser Federation. After selling his business in 1979, he moved to The Algarve, Portugal. After the death of his wife in December 1988, Bushnell returned to live in Henley. In 1990 Bushnell had a lung removed.\\"Thames still a golden vision for bolshie Bert\\", This is London (14 January 14, 2003): \\"Bert Bushnell had a lung removed 12 years ago and says he's also become a \\"deaf old sod\\". About 2000 Bushnell donated his gold medal to the River and Rowing Museum in Henley, as he was concerned about it being stolen from his home and figured it was easy enough to go and visit it at the museum.\\"Olympic rowing veteran dies at 88\\" , Henley Standard (18 January 2010). In October 2006 Bushnell presented the trophy to Alan Campbell as winner of the Wingfield Sculls.Mike Rosewell, \\"Campbell happy to play coach's name game\\", The Times (London, England: 27 October 2006) p.97 Bushnell died at the Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire on Saturday, 9 January 2010, aged 88, survived by his three daughters and his partner Monica Rees. His funeral was on 27 January 2010 at the Parish Church of Saint Mary the Virgin at Henley-on-Thames. Legacy Bushnell was initially thought to be the final surviving gold medallist from the British team at the 1948 Summer Olympics, however David Bond (who won a gold medal in the sailing Swallow class) wrote in to The Guardian to inform the newspaper that he was very much alive. Hitchambury Homes created a housing development called Bushnell Place in honour of Bert Bushnell on Alwyn Road, Maidenhead. Bushnell and Burnell's Olympic success is featured at the Maidenhead Heritage Centre. Bushnell and Burnell and their efforts in the 1948 Summer Olympics are featured in \\"The Perfect Rower: 100 Years of Racing for Glory\\" exhibition at the River and Rowing Museum, from 31 March to 30 September 2012. On 25 July 2012, two days before the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, BBC One screened the film Bert and Dickie (also called Going For Gold: The '48 Games), depicting Burnell and Bushnell's achievement at the 1948 Games, with Bushnell portrayed by Doctor Who actor Matt Smith and Sam Hoare portraying Burnell. The film's writer, William Ivory, met Bushnell before his death in 2010. References Further reading =Books= * Burnell, Richard. Henley Royal Regatta: A Celebration of 150 Years.

This is accomplished by measuring local variation in factors that influence grape yield and quality (soil, topography, microclimate, vine health, etc.) and applying appropriate viticulture management practices (trellis design, pruning, fertilizer application, irrigation, timing of harvest, etc.).Bramley R.G.V., Hamilton R.P. 2004.

Understanding variability in winegrape production systems. 2. Within vineyard variation in quality over several vintages. Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research 11: 33-42. Precision viticulture is based on the premise that high in-field variability for factors that affect vine growth and grape ripening warrants intensive management customized according to local conditions. Precision viticulture depends on new and emerging technologies such as global positioning systems (GPS), meteorologic and other environmental sensors, satellite and airborne remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) to assess and respond to variability.  Background  Precision viticulture is unique in its emphasis on vineyard management according to local variation, and in its use of science and technology to accomplish this. While Australian viticulturists are generally recognized as leaders in precision viticulture, and while viticulturists worldwide have embraced the approach, the fundamental concepts have deep roots in the traditions of Old World winemaking regions. Terroir, a related French concept, refers to the special geographic qualities or \\"sense of place\\" embodied in the wine produced in a particular region.Robinson, J. (ed). 2006. The Oxford Companion to Wine, Third Edition. Oxford University Press. Precision agriculture emphasizes \\"doing the right thing, in the right place, at the right time\\", and is practical for viticulture because of high local variability of conditions within vineyards, and because of responsiveness to intensive management in terms of increased grape yield and quality. According to CSIRO, AustraliaCSIRO, 2008. Australia Precision Viticulture Overview, http://www.csiro.au/science/Precision-Viticulture.html, accessed December 15, 2008 \\"Typically grape yield varies eight to ten-fold under uniform management\\"; \\"patterns of yield variation are stable in time and driven by soil and topographic variation\\"; and \\"patterns of variation in fruit quality tend to be similar to those for yield, suggesting opportunities for zonal management and selective harvest\\". Australian precision viticulture has focused on yield monitoring, whereas California precision viticulture has focused on remote sensing.Goode, J. 2005. The Science of Wine: from Vine to Glass. University of California Press, Berkeley. ,  Technology for characterizing vineyard variation  Precision viticulture uses a broad set of enabling technologies to observe and respond to vineyard variability: *Global Positioning Systems (GPS) provide satellite-based georeferencing for mapping vineyard environmental variability. *Meteorologic Stations monitor climatic factors important for vine growth and grape ripening, including temperature, precipitation, humidity, and wind. *Remote Sensing from satellite and airborne platforms provides images depicting vineyard conditions, for example vine productivity from normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). *Digital Elevation Models (DEM) provide detailed topographic information. *High Resolution Soil Surveys provide detailed information about soil fertility and hydrologic characteristics. *Relational Databases organize environmental and economic information. *Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide digital tools for map-based analysis. *Other Environmental Sensors monitor important biophysical factors such as solar radiation, soil moisture, and temperature regimes.  Management practices  Precision viticulture draws upon a variety of management approaches, including zonal management, in which different areas of the vineyard are managed according to their unique conditions, and adaptive management, in which different management practices are applied according to observed needs and improved knowledge. Trellis design, in terms of row orientation and geometry of vine support, and pruning practices can be tailored to optimize vine health, to protect grapes from frost, sunburn, and mildew damage, and to ensure even grape ripening.Weiss, S.B., D.C. Luth, and B. Guerra. 2003. Potential solar radiation in a VSP trellis at 38¬∞N latitude. Practical Winery and Vineyard 25:16-27. Irrigation and fertilizer application schedules, pest management, and selective harvest based on timing of ripening can all be managed to minimize costs and maximize vineyard performance based on observed needs. Increasingly, precision viticulture, with its focus on management according to local variability, is coupled with organic farming, with its focus on environmentally friendly practices without the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, and with sustainable agriculture, with emphasis on long-term environmental stewardship and economic viability.  Future  Various integrative technological approaches are gaining increasing attention for application in precision viticulture: *Distributed Sensor Networks use strategic deployment of sensors throughout a vineyard to monitor key factors such as water stress and temperature. *Vineyard Models simulate microclimate, vine growth, grape ripening, and economic return on investment to evaluate management options. *Decision Support Systems (DSS) bring together vineyard environmental and economic databases, vineyard models, and GIS in an interactive software-based system to solve management problems and better make decisions.

Lithuanian Land Forces consist of three brigades, the Engineer Battalion, and the National Defence Volunteers Division. Structure The main element of the Land Forces is a single mechanised infantry brigade, the Iron Wolf Mechanised Infantry Brigade. This is formed around three mechanized infantry battalions and an artillery battalion, all named after Lithuanian grand dukes as the tradition of the Lithuanian Armed Forces goes. In addition to the formed infantry brigade, the Land Forces maintain three additional motorised infantry battalions; one of these is tasked to support operations both domestically and overseas; one is tasked primarily with the defence of territorial Lithuania, and the third is primarily a training unit Juozas Vitkus Engineer Battalion is responsible for mine clearance, the construction of pontoon bridges, unexploded ordnance detonation tasks, underwater engineering, and participation in search and rescue operations. The Explosive Ordnance Disposal Platoon is ready to participate in international operations. Starting in 2008, the Lithuanian Armed Forces launched a 10-year-long project continuing mine cleaning on Lithuanian territory of explosives left after the First and Second World War, and in former Soviet military bases. As an integral part of the Land Forces, the National Defence Volunteers have been developing since the beginning of the national movement for independence. The volunteers act smoothly together with the Allies during military operations and have been assigned new missions: to augment the regular forces, to deploy individual units and specific capabilities for international operations, to assist host nation support and to support the civilian authorities.

To bring them up to NATO standards, current efforts focus on upgrading equipment and armaments, enhancing their operational effectiveness, and combat training. The standard service assault rifle of the Lithuanian Armed Forces is the Heckler & Koch G36 and the standard pistol is the Glock 17. The Lithuanian Land Forces are also equipped with machine guns, including the GPMG MG-3, the FN MAG, and the 12.7mm (.50 cal.) M2 Browning machine gun. They also employ the AT-4 anti-tank rockets and Carl Gustav anti-tank recoilless rifles, HK GMG high-velocity grenade launchers, and low-velocity AG-36 under-the-barrel grenade launchers, in addition to light and heavy mortars and M101 howitzers. The army also uses high-technology Lithuanian-made tactical automated commanding and controlling informational systems (TAVVIS). Reserves Lithuanian Land Forces are formed from professional military servicemen and volunteers. In 2008 the minister of national defence of Lithuania signed a law that ceased conscription in an effort to develop Lithuania's professional army. National defence is based on reserve forces and mobilisation forces. The new minister plans to increase national defence capabilities by making all males from 18 to 24 take 7 week military basic training. After that the person will be added to the military reserves. The military conscription has been renewed in 2015 with a first draft of approx. 3000 draftees including volunteers, who will be assigned to military units starting from August 2015 and will complete a 9-month basic training. The updated law specifies that a draft of 3000 soldiers annually will continue at least until 2020, citing as the reason for renewed conscription the increased geopolitical risks in the region.

He attended the Liceo Classico Manzoni, obtaining (with Enrico Camporesi, now medical professor in Florida) the highest score in northern Italy at the final exams. He graduated in physics at Milan University and was the first non-Chinese to receive a PhD in a mathematical discipline in China, at Dalian University of Technology. Starting in 1969,ABS projection algorithms: mathematical techniques for linear and nonlinear equations, p. 227 (1989) (biographical sketch accompanying article) he worked for seven years at CISE, a nuclear research center near Milano. He also spent two years in the United Kingdom, University of Essex, and the United States, at Stanford University. He then moved to the University of Bergamo as a professor in operations research and was for many years director of its mathematics department. Disciplines He has been active in different disciplines, as shown by his list of about 500 papers, of which some 300 in mathematics. =Quasi-Newton methods= In mathematics he worked ten years in the field of Quasi-Newton methods, obtaining the first results on optimal conditioning and invariancy to nonlinear scaling. =ABS methods= Then, motivated by a seminar of J√≥zsef Abaffy, he developed within an international collaboration the new field of ABS (Abaffy-Broyden-Spedicato) methods. These are based on the little-known rank-one reducing matrix iteration due to Jen≈ë Egerv√°ry, a great Hungarian mathematician who committed suicide after hostility from communist bureaucrats. The work on ABS methods started in 1981 and is still continued. It has involved mainly Hungarians (Abaffy, Gal√°ntai, Jeney,‚Ä¶), Chinese (Deng, Zhu, Xia, Zhang, Huang, Li‚Ä¶) and Iranians (Mahdavi- Amiri, Esmaeili, Mirnia‚Ä¶.). It has produced over 400 papers, three international conferences in China and two monographs: one in 1989 by Abaffy and Spedicato, based upon some 60 papers, and another in 1998 by Xia and Zhang, based upon some 250 papers. A third monograph is envisaged. The main results by ABS methods include: * unification of algorithms for linear systems and linearly constrained optimization * improvement of the classic method of Gauss for linear system, by reducing memory and eliminating pivoting; the obtained method has also a natural application to the simplex algorithm for linear programming, where it can be up one order faster than the best of other methods * derivation of algorithms for nonlinear equations that are more efficient than Newton's method in memory, stepwise convergence, without requiring nonsingularity of Jacobian at solution * derivation of a general algorithm for linear Diophantine equations, i.e. for the linear solvable Hilbert's tenth problems, with extension to Diophantine inequalities and linear programming. Here the classic Euler condition for the existence of integer solutions is generalized for the first time from a single equation to a system, and similarly is generalized the method of Rosser. =Applied optimization= Other mathematical work of Spedicato has dealt with applications of optimization to industrial problems, especially to the reduction of fuel consumption and noxious emissions by cars, on data from Alfa Romeo and Fiat. =Mechanics and astronomy= He also has worked in celestial mechanics, in particular analyzing the effects of an inversion of the rotation axis of Earth (the results confirm statements in Herodotus and Pomponius Mela). Work in progress regards a new theory for the origin of the Moon (by capture from a passing by planet) and the study of a super Tunguska explosion over northern Germany, which may explain such things as the events of Exodus and the Deucalian flood. Other interests Spedicato's interests also concern ancient history, especially with respect to catastrophic events of extraterrestrial nature, where he has published papers related to Atlantis, Exodus and the Tunguska-type impacts of 1178 AD over the Pacific. He has also studied problems in biblical and other ancient texts, dealing e.g. with the geography of Eden and Gilgamesh's travels, the empire of Solomon, the origin of the Etruscans within the theory of Alinei who has shown their language to be ancient Hungarian. Finally he has interests in the musical field, started by a contact with prof Taboga, who found a convincing explanation for Mozart's death and showed that Andrea Luchesi, the teacher of Beethoven, played an essential role in the origin of the Wiener Klassik. These interests have been devoted recently to operatic music, after his discovery that Gigli and Pertile were family friends. He has met such stars of lyric as Valdengo, Taddei, Panerai, Di Stefano, Bergonzi, Prandelli, Olivero, Stella, Cerquetti and Maliponte, and is presently working on a book devoted to Puccini.

It was a part of the Union forces in the Western Theater of operations. Organization The original 63rd Ohio Infantry Regiment was organized on December 1, 1861, at Camp Worthington in Columbus and at Camp Marietta in Marietta, but only enough men were available to fill four companies. Hence, the 63rd was not officially designated as a regiment. The 63rd Ohio Infantry was organized January 23, 1862, in Marietta, Ohio, by consolidation of a battalion of the 22nd Ohio Infantry Regiment and the four companies originally raised for the 63rd Ohio Infantry Regiment. Governor David Tod appointed John W. Sprague as the regiment's colonel. Its ten individual companies had been raised in southern Ohio. Service history The regiment immediately took the field and joined Major General John Pope in Missouri. At New Madrid, the 63rd was brigaded with other Ohio regiments in what became known as the Ohio Brigade. It took part in all the operations resulting in the surrender of Island No. 10. In April 1862, the 63rd Ohio Infantry joined Maj. Gen. Henry Halleck's forces near Corinth, Mississippi. After the evacuation, it operated in Northern Alabama, and participated in the battles of Iuka and Corinth in the army of William S. Rosecrans. Colonel Sprague was promoted to brigadier general, and Oscar L. Jackson assumed command of the regiment. During 1863, the 63rd Ohio Infantry operated mostly in Northern Alabama and Tennessee. In January 1864, most of the men re- enlisted for three years, and the regiment went to Ohio on veteran furlough. In May it joined Sherman's Atlanta Campaign and shared in all the battles to the end of the campaign. In the autumn, the 63rd Ohio Infantry took part in Sherman's March to the Sea. In early 1865, the 63rd Ohio Infantry participated in the Carolinas Campaign. It took part in the Grand Review of the Armies in Washington, D.C. in May and then went by train to Louisville, Kentucky, where the men mustered out on July 8, 1865. The regiment lost during its term of service 2 officers and 91 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded; and 5 officers and 259 enlisted men by disease, for a total of 357 fatalities.

The show was broadcast on Sundays from 10am to 1pm. It was co-hosted by Matt (\\"Fordie\\") Forde, who usually joined Jon at 12noon. On Sunday 7 February 2010, Richardson announced that after three and a half years on 6 Music, he would be leaving the station after the 7 March show. He said he didn't want \\"to get typecast as a DJ\\", as he is a comic. He went on to state \\"I've loved doing it, so I'd love to do more radio at some point\\", but after he has asserted himself further as a stand-up comic. On Sunday 7 March 2010, the last show aired.  Features Guest Comedian, each week Jon invites a different comedian each week to join him in the studio for usually at least the first hour of the show. Rarely, two or more comedians may also be featured, such as Pappy's Fun Club. Cheer up Jon, Mark Olver finds someone who would cheer Jon up and they join him on air. These guests have included a Dyson engineer (due to Jon's admiration of the Dyson Airblade handdryer), the current Sheriff of Nottingham, and the lady who coined the phrase \\"a dog is for life, not just for Christmas\\" for the Dog's Trust. As of June 2009, this feature no longer appeared on the show, but currently continues under a Christmas theme. Olvers Olvent Calendolv Mark Olver appears again with a Christmas themed version of 'Cheer Up Jon': guests so far have included the founder of Pets As Therapy, a British charity which uses pets to aid those in need. The Podjoke, a feature present only in the podcast of the show. It takes the form of a gag, usually pun-based, which is begun in the intro at the beginning of the show, and completed in the outro. Pitcher's Pictures, Comedian Al Pitcher, while collecting pictures for a piece in his new stand-up set, began e-mailing the pictures to Jon. These pictures were put on the 6 Music website. This became a feature where listeners were challenged to take a better picture than Pitcher each week. The picture has to adhere to a category that is chosen by Pitcher. The category must be based on a song title. The winner is decided by Jon some weeks and by listener votes on other weeks. After the feature each week the song which the category is created from is played. The Project, a project announced on the podcast in which the Jon asks the podcast listeners (by over-clicking subscribe) to ruin the iTunes podcast chart, and propel Jon to the top. It was begun by a listener, that discovered that by clicking on the subscribe button next to the podcast on iTunes many times it was possible to cheat the podcast chart system and work Jon up near to the top of the charts. This became a popular idea, with many listeners following James's footsteps, however, after some doubting emails, Jon became skeptical on if it really worked, and eventually called for listeners to abandon the project. In 2009, the first hour of the show has been designated the Happy Hour where Jon tries to be happy (as he generally considers himself to be pessimistic). Listeners have a chance to email in stories of happiness to share with Jon, his team and other listeners. The happy hour is more frequently used to discuss listener's 'good deeds', in which Jon and his guest compare the deeds and decide which is the best - the show is then dedicated to this listener. Winners of this have included a group of friends holding a picnic for a friend's birthday, a lady who taught someone how to use a Dyson Airblade, and on one occasion, Jon himself (He picked up a man's train ticket and was thanked with the reply, \\"You have saved my life\\" which he took quite literally). Jon plays songs that will make himself and the listeners happy. Naturally, just minutes after the Happy Hour, Jon reverts to his usual self. On 1 February 2009, Jon was in a bad mood and decided to do 'Crappy Hour' instead of Happy Hour which consisted of anecdotes from both Jon and the listeners about bad things that had happened to them during their weeks. =Matt Forde features= The Fordie Files are a series of reports by Fordie, which have delved into topics such as Halloween, chivalry, advent, the art of taking a penalty, and cloning (in which Forde put across a compelling argument about why we shouldn't bring back any extinct animal with \\"wild\\" in its name). Whilst presenting his reports, Jon often plays random sound effects, that are often unrelated, and off-putting for Fordie. Get Fordie fit (sometimes referred to as \\"Get Fit Fatty\\" to the annoyance of Fordie), charts Fordies journey of losing weight. The main goal of this feature was for Fordie to lose a certain amount of weight before Christmas, and as an incentive, it was agreed he would only receive a Christmas present from Jon if this was achieved. This feature no longer appears on the show. Fordie's One Week Feature, Fordie creates a feature that will only be done for one show and will never appear again, usually because the feature is a weak attempt at a feature. An example of a one-week feature was \\"Inside Fordie's Car\\" where sound effects were played to recreate Fordie driving his car. The feature was filled with silences between Fordie saying phrases such as \\"Ahh, McDonald's is closed again, I'm starving.\\" and \\"You're driving like an idiot! Not you.\\" which led to awkward laughter from Jon and much criticism of the feature which Fordie had hoped would become a weekly occurrence on the show. Challenge Fordie Listeners text or email in challenges for Fordie, previous ones have included to climb Arthur's Seat (Mountain in Edinburgh), To complete a session of Cardiokick (exercise class) and get either live on air or a recorded message from Barack Obama, Joe Biden, Sarah Palin or John McCain. Fordie's Advice In this feature Fordie gives listeners tips on how to behave in certain situations, such as how to behave with the opposite gender, and how to behave at a party. During his advice for the latter, he insisted that filling a wine bottle with water and proceeding to 'accidentally' drop it on the door step of the party host was a successful way to get out of not bringing a present, whilst looking as if you had. Fordie Tries To Join The Gym Each week Fordie tries to join the gym in preparation for his marathon attempt, and then has to answer to Richardson and give some lame excuse as to why he has failed. Fordie's Interviews Each week, Fordie pretends to interview a famous person, yet actually uses soundbites from old interviews and fills in his part himself. He has 'interviewed' Gordon Brown, David Cameron, David Attenborough, the England football team, and even Jon. Guest comedian Every week, Jon Richardson invited a guest comedian to join him in the studio. Some of guest comedians appeared on the show were: Stephen K Amos, Jarred Christmas, Arnab Chanda (who announced his retirement from comedy while on the show), Rufus Hound, Josie Long, Michael McIntyre, Sarah Millican, Lloyd Langford, Dan Atkinson, Al Pitcher, Rich Hall (AKA Otis Lee Crenshaw), Paul Sinha, Andrew Bird, John (Nobbler) Robins, Seann Walsh, Toni and the Guys, Mark Olver, Hal Cruttenden, Will Smith, Dan Evans, Tom Wrigglesworth, Andy Zaltzman, Pappy's Fun Club, Rhod Gilbert, Danny Buckler, Rob Deering, Richard Herring, Tim Vine, Charlie Baker, Matthew Crosby, Sean Lock, Andy Parsons and David O'Doherty.

From a humble beginning in 1957, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) has grown into a notable organisation with the membership of 54 football association. The confederation of African Football is also responsible for the organization of the major competitions within Africa. Formation The Confederation of African Football began its formation at the 29th FIFA Congress in Bern, Switzerland, in June 1954. Africa was represented at the Congress by four national associations: Egypt, who had joined FIFA in 1923; Sudan affiliated in 1948; Ethiopia in 1953 and South Africa in 1910 and 1952. It was at that Congress that Africa was recognised as a zonal group with a right to have for the first time a representative on the FIFA Executive Committee. This representation was taken up by Engineer Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem of Egypt. It was not an easy task to get this recognition, Argentina kicked against the seats given to Africa and Asia arguing that the standard of football in these continents was not good enough, although at the previous Congress in Paris in 1953 it was agreed that Africa will be given the right to be represented subsequently. There was a long, heated argument. Africa's position was supported by Great Britain and the eastern countries, 24 votes in favour, 17 against. The Congress then elected Abdel Aziz Abdallah Salem to represent Africa on the Executive Committee until a confederation was founded. Then, the African delegation agreed to meet in Lisbon in 1956 on the occasion of the FIFA Congress to realise the project. Due to the Ethiopian Football Federation's lack of funds, Ydnekatchew Tessema was unable to travel to the historic 1954 FIFA Congress in Bern, which recognized Africa as a FIFA zone. The other African members were represented, not only in Bern, but at the 1956 Lisbon Congress as well. South African apartheid issue A committee was also set up to look into the case of South Africa, who run two separate federations the oldest run by only whites while the other recognized (sp) the other races. The rise of apartheid in 1948 had opened another front in the struggle against racism and segregation in colonial sport. The popularity of football in black communities arose from conditions present throughout colonial Africa: economic expansion, massive urban growth, and access to Western education, albeit for a small minority. During the 1950s, black athletes, organizers, and nationalists fought a long struggle with the entrenched white interests reinforced by apartheid. The first were organized in the South African Soccer Federation (SASF), while the second were represented by the South African Football Association (SAFA). Internationally, the Federation fought a bitter struggle for recognition within FIFA. FIFA ending up denying the Federation's membership application because it did not include whites. South Africa was suspended from FIFA in 1961 and remained isolated from the world of football until 1992 (except for a one-year reprieve in 1963). Established five years before the Organization of African Unity, and the famous Rivonia Trial that passed life sentences on Mandela, Albertina Sisulu and other black South African activists; the African football Confederation was the first International Organization to dare say no to then very strong Apartheid, as far back as 1957. At this point in history; Apartheid was acceptable both to the International Olympic Committee and to FIFA. The two heavy weight Global Sports Institutions thus labeled the unprecedented stand of the young Confederation, as one of, \\"mixing politics with sports\\". Subsequently, FIFA told the Confederation that it had no right to expel a member association of FIFA, and instructed immediate reinstatement of Apartheid South Africa. The new Confederation did not only refuse to comply, but, demanded that FIFA itself expel the racist association from membership. This first confrontation, which could have easily caused the early withdrawal of the three African member associations, subsided briefly, when FIFA under the Presidency of Englishman Arthur Drewry promised to review the African position. However, it relapsed again, after a three-man fact finding mission led by the newly elected president, Sir Stanley Rous, travelled to South Africa, and concluded that the National Football Federation had nothing to do with Government instituted Racial Discrimination. The controversial recommendation of this delegation to readmit the South African Federation was adopted at the FIFA Congress in Cairo 1963. The African delegation at the Congress in Lisbon, were Abdel Aziz Salem, Mohammad Latif, Youssef Mohammad (Egypt); Abdel Halim Mohammad, Abdel Rahim Shaddad, Badawi Mohammad Ali (Sudan) and Fred Fell (South Africa). They got together on June 7 and 8 at the Avenida Hotel and decided among other things to create an African Football Confederation and to organise a competition among countries beginning from 1957 in Khartoum, Sudan, where the statutes and regulations of the new body would be drawn. African Cup of Nations is born The Constitutional Assembly of CAF took place on February 8, 1957, at the Grand Hotel in Khartoum, Sudan. In attendance were Abdel Aziz Salem, Mourad Fahmy, Galal Koreitem, Moustafa Kamel Mansour and Youssef Mohammad representing Egypt, Ydnekatchew Tessema, General Aman Andom and Guebeyehu Double (Ethiopia), Abdel Halim Mohammad, Abdel Rahim Shaddad, Badawi Mohammad Ali and Ahmad Mohammad Singawi (Sudan) and Fred Fell (South Africa). The foundation of the CAF statutes came from proposed statutes by both Tessema and Shaddad while regulations were also drawn for the African Cup of Nations. Engineer Salem was elected first CAF President while Tessema, Abdel Halim and Fell were voted into the executive committee as members with Youssef Mohamed as the first honorary General Secretary. The first African Cup of Nations kicked off on February 10 without South Africa, who were disqualified after they failed to present a multi-racial team. Ethiopia had a bye to the final, while at Khartoum Stadium, the Egyptians beat the hosting nation 2:1. The final was much easier for Egypt; 4:0 against Ethiopia, all the goals were scored by Mohammad Diab El Attar, also known as \\"Ad-Diba\\", who finished the tournament as top scorer with 5 goals. Only two games were played to give Egypt the inaugural African Champions title. CAF moves to Cairo The young organisation suffered an early setback when its important documents were lost during a fire outbreak at the offices of the Sudan Football Association where they were kept. Lucky it was that the statutes adopted at the Constitutional Assembly had already been sent to FIFA and they were subsequently approved by the FIFA Executive Committee on June 21, 1957, in Zurich. Thus going by Article 5 of these statutes which stipulates that the headquarters of CAF be located in the same country as where the president resides, the organisation's first office was on 3, El Hadika Street, Garden City, Cairo. Abdel Aziz Moustafa becomes president The third CAF General Assembly took place in June 1958 in Stockholm during the FIFA Congress and World Cup. The four founding countries were represented although acting president Salem stayed away because of a strained relationship with the president of the Egyptian Football Association (EFA), Field Marshal Abdel Hakim Amer. General Abdel Aziz Moustafa will thus replace his compatriot as CAF President while Dr. Abdel Halim emerged as the first African to be elected to the FIFA Executive Committee. Moustafa Kamel Mansour also succeeded former player and referee Youssef Mohamed as CAF General Secretary. An Extraordinary meeting was held on August 21, 1960, in Rome, with delegates from Ghana, Morocco and Tunisia also in attendance. Several issues, from the creation of an Executive Committee to a revision of the statutes were discussed. It was agreed that the next meeting be held in November in Cairo with Egypt shouldering the expenses of all delegates. However, it was not till 16 February 1961 that the Congress took place. General Moustafa was re-elected President while Mourad Fahmy took over as General Secretary. It was also decided that each national association pay an annual affiliation fee of 50 Egyptian pounds. During the fourth Congress in Cairo in 1961, Ydnekatchew proposed the Headquarters of the Confederation be moved to Addis Ababa. Further to the main objective of ensuring a responsible Secretariat; his proposal was also the first effort for equitable distribution of duties, powers and benefits in the Confederation. Ydnekatchew hoped new members Ghana and Tunisia would support this logical proposal, but for reasons of election politics, they preferred not to challenge the status quo. Egypt aids the CAF financially Fahmy had to start from the scratch as the organisation did not have money and was even indebted to a printing company. It also did not have a staff. The EFA would later rent two rooms of its new office located on the Nile to CAF courtesy of the goodwill of both Fahmy and Mostafa who were both top officials of EFA. EFA also settled CAF's utility bills while the Egyptian Olympic Committee granted this new organisation 2,000 pounds a year. At the Extraordinary General Assembly in Addis Ababa, General Mostafa defeated Tessema to become a FIFA Vice-President while Ghana's Ohene Djan got on the FIFA Executive Committee also at the expense of Tessema. Sir Stanley Rous attends CAF 3rd Extraordinary General Assembly in Cairo A watershed gathering of this young confederation took place on January 23 and 24 1963 when Moustafa succeeded in getting the Egyptian government to bankroll the accommodation and travel expenses of visiting delegates. Therefore, a record 23 national associations attended alongside FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous. Several ground-breaking decisions were taken at this meeting. First, the continent was divided into six geographical zones and the CAF Executive Committee was expanded to take in 12 representatives. Djan and Tessema emerged as Vice-Presidents and a new set of statutes was adopted and published. African Cup of Champions Clubs is born At the next General Assembly in Accra, on November 22, 1963, a decision was taken to create a new competition for clubs the African Cup of Champions Clubs. A year later, during the Congress in Tokyo, on the eve of the 1964 Summer Olympics, a counter proposal co-sponsored by Ethiopia, Egypt and then new member Ghana, calling for the expulsion of Apartheid South Africa, surprisingly won the majority vote for the reduced, but equally effective suspension of Apartheid, reversing the 1963 decision. Thereafter, ceaseless efforts by Sir Stanley to change this new status were successfully blocked by Africa. As many as 25 African countries were represented during this congress, Djan was re-elected to the FIFA Executive Committee. Head of the Algerian delegation to the Seventh CAF General Assembly in Tunis, on November 11, 1965, Dr. Mohammad Maouche, criticised the structures of the organisation leading to the formation of a study committee to make amendments to the statutes and submit them at the Extraordinary Assembly in London in July 1966. Tense FIFA-CAF relationship Although the protracted battle on the issue of Apartheid had caused numerous disagreements in successive FIFA Congresses, none came near to a breaking point as the scheme encouraged by Sir Stanley Rous to establish a separate FIFA recognized regional Southern African Confederation, consisting mainly of South Africa, Rhodesia, Mauritius, Madagascar, Botswana and Malawi, with the obvious intent of facilitating the unchallenged readmission of Apartheid. African Football leaders came across copies of the confidential communications on the issue and made it clear to Sir Stanley during an informal discussion just before the opening of the 1966 Congress in London, that all African Associations would walk out of the Conference Hall if FIFA was not to withdraw its unofficial support to the divisive establishment of two independent Confederations in one continent. In a compromise last minute arrangement Sir Stanley retreated, avoiding the eminent walkout by all African Associations from this Congress and the ensuing publicity it would have provoked. This was a point in time when FIFA-CAF relations were strained to the limit, subsequent to the already declared African boycott of the 1966 FIFA World Cup hosted by England, refusing to share a single place with Asia. North Korea, winners of the Asian qualifiers got an automatic spot in the finals, representing the two continents as a result. =Suspension of Rhodesia= The other notable contentious issue in successive meetings was the demand by most African nations for the suspension of Rhodesia. The African Football Confederation was again the first International sports institution to expel the Rhodesia Football Association from membership, only four days after the country's unilateral declaration of independence on 11 November 1965. Five years later, the effort to expel Rhodesia from FIFA was taken to the Congress in Mexico City, 1970; Ydnekatchew Tessema was accompanied by renowned Ethiopian lawyer, and member of the Executive Committee of the National Federation, Tafari Benti, who assisted in preparing a legal case against Rhodesia's continued FIFA membership. African National Associations threatened to walk out if the congress did not endorse the Ethiopian argument. Concerned with the possibility of a last minute African boycott, Mexico, together with its supporters, voted in favor, thereby ensuring Rhodesia's suspension by a large majority vote. As a result of a military coup d'√©tat in Ghana, Djan was banned from any public gathering and was refused to travel to London. He was replaced by Tessema on the FIFA Executive Committee and a new statutes was adopted in July 1966. Among other things, the statutes stipulated the creation of six standing committees with the most important being the Organising Committee headed by Tessema. Abdel Halim Mohammad becomes president The capital city of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, hosted the Eighth CAF General Assembly on January 10, 1968. General Moustafa was not present and so lost his position to Dr. Abdel Halim, who was voted unanimously after Dr. Ahmad Bakr of Egypt withdrew his own candidature. Rito Alcantara from Senegal became Vice- President and was elected to the FIFA Executive Committee, as a third member, in case it was approved by FIFA. Tessema was re-elected to same position. CAF also agreed to collaborate with Supreme Council of Sports in Africa (SCSA) while also keeping its own independence. But two years after these elections, the constituency protested that Dr Halim was not doing much towards the promised reforms. Thus, during the seventh edition of the Nations Cup in the Sudan 1970, twenty member associations signed a petition demanding the establishment of a special committee for thorough review and amendment of the statutes. Ydnekatchew Tessema was again elected chairman of this committee which included, Dr. Maouche (Algeria), Hamici (Democratic Republic of the Congo), Karrar (Sudan), Matthia (Togo), Mwade Wade (Senegal), and Chief Mensah (Ghana). =Africa demands FIFA gate income= Later on, during FIFA Congress in Mexico prior to the 1970 FIFA World Cup, Ethiopia proposed that FIFA should collect gate income percentage from matches between the four British associations (England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland), so long as these Associations enjoy the privileges of four votes in the Congresses and four representations in the World Cups. This motion was defeated by 34 to 33 votes. Two years later, during the 1972 congress in Paris, the same motion on the four British Associations, presented by Uruguay, was adopted unanimously. Senegal call for change FIFA President Rous was at the assembly in Yaound√©, as well as 28 national associations. A proposal by Senegal for an ad hoc committee to prepare a technical development programme that will help raise the standard of refereeing on the continent was approved. The proposed amendments to the statutes were adopted by the assembly following the support of 22 of the associations present. Considering the noticeable interference by some elements from within and outside of the continent, who were striving to exploit this misunderstanding to further divide and weaken the Confederation, and thereby disrupt the necessary unity for the then nearly accomplished tasks of expelling Apartheid South Africa from FIFA, and achieving Africa's rightful places in the global body, Ydnekatchew Tessema, preferred not to publicize the works of the ad hoc committee. The situation was handled as an internal problem of the African Football Confederation that can only be resolved by its own general meeting. Accordingly, the new statutes, quietly and cautiously, drafted by this ad hoc committee, were submitted to the Congress in Yaound√©. The assembly refused to discuss the amendments in detail and again empowered Ydnekatchew to preside over a new sub-committee entrusted with double checking the recommended changes. This committee worked until four o'clock in the morning and presented the final version to the Congress the next day. The Congress in turn worked until five o'clock in the morning and adopted the new constitution of the Confederation. After two sleepless nights, the legislative for the first time asserted that it is in effect the supreme authority of the Confederation. Tessema rules CAF During Yaound√©'s assembly CAF President Dr. Abdel Halim Mohammad lost his seat to Tessema by 15 voices to 12, though it was said that Sir Stanley Rous, who supervised the elections, openly supported Dr. Abdel Halim during the elections. Professor Rene Essomba became first Vice-President while Alcantara was second Vice-President. Dr. Abdel Halim and Alcantara were elected to the FIFA executive committee. Egypt maintained the headquarters together with the African vice Presidency in FIFA. With Tessema as President and Mourad Fahmy as General Secretary, CAF broke new grounds. Tessema did not inherit a ready made Confederation; peace in the Confederation and total focus on the overall developmental works of the Continent's football, prevailed only after this historic Congress in Yaound√© 1972. This is why he is still viewed by connoisseurs of the Confederation's history, as the most successful African football leader; who had resolved all early detractive problems and directed total focus towards the development of the game, not only for his era, but also, for the future of the continent's most popular sport. It must be said here, that the differences due to this lengthy and detractive controversy; were confined to conference tables. The pioneers had always maintained enviable, mutual respect and brotherhood in their personal relationships. In the following years, the continuous inclusion of newly liberated African countries strengthened the Confederation's position in the FIFA congresses, but, this positive development was accompanied by the undesirable by-product of Colonialism; the division between Arab Africa, Francophone Africa and Anglophone Africa, maintaining the \\"One Africa\\" motto began to be more and more complicated. This was, and still is, a challenge to unity in African football. =Tessema's quote controversy= ‚ÄúCAF does not need any financial support. Its budget is very healthy and its receipts exceed its expenses every year,‚Äù declared a bullish Tessema in 1986. Yet, there is some controversy upon what was published in the February 2007 special edition of the CAF magazine 'CAFOOT' as The Tessemas official website denys such quotation, stating that \\"The authors and/or publishers, can not produce a single evidence to substantiate this quotation. It is deliberately out of context and dishonest. Yidnekatchew had on several occasions since the beginning of unseen before revenue from live TV broadcast of the Cup of Nations, in Libya in 1982, declared, \\"CAF'S budget is healthy, and its receipts exceed its expenses every year\\", but, he had never said \\"C.A.F. does not need any financial support\\"!! In fact, until his last FIFA Congress, in Mexico 1986, he had fought to increase Africa's share from FIFA revenues. He had gone as far as demanding the need for the revision of the statutes of FIFA; one of the Major objectives being, the equitable distribution of its revenue among all the Confederations. This meant reducing from powerful Europe to increase Africa's share.\\" New clubs competition evolved In 1975, the African Cup Winners' Cup was founded while three years later an African youth competition was first organised. In 1985, CAF organised a qualifying tournament for boys less than 16 years. The finances of the confederation improved remarkably as a result of an increase in the number of the competitions it organised. In 1982, CAF even sold the television and publicity rights of the Cup of Nations. Tessema names Hayatou as a successor Eight months after 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico, Tessema explained the nature of his illness to member associations of the African Football Confederation, and successfully appealed to them to vote for Omar Sey of Gambia in his place, in the 1988 elections; which he very well knew would be after his life. A few months later, this succession plan was complicated with the unexpected appointment of Omar Sey as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Gambia. However, Ydnekatchew was not prepared to give-up, easy; when the newly appointed Minister, visited Addis Ababa for a meeting of the Organization of African Unity, in June 1987, he invited him home and made one final effort to convince him to resign from his government position and run for the presidency of the Confederation. Omar did not offend his ailing colleague with an outright no, he said he would try, but also explained the difficulty and possible implications of submitting a resignation to his Head of State. At the end of this meeting, Ydnekatchew did not take time to announce his second choice, Issa Hayatou, in defending his surprise choice; he said that though being a newcomer to the Executive Committee, Issa was still better than any other potential candidate. Only days before he died, he invited the First Vice President Dr. Halim, and the Secretary General Moustafa Fahmy, to Addis Ababa, and repeated to both of them that Issa was now the most appropriate choice for the job. Though in vain, he also pleaded with veteran Dr. Halim, to abandon his ambition to the presidency and take the responsibility of ensuring elections, free of external influences. It is however not known, if the early support of by then already deceased Ydnekatchew had helped Issa win his first election at the Congress in Casablanca, seven months later. Hayatou's era Issa Hayatou, who was President of the Cameroonian Football Federation from 1986 to 1988, succeeded Tessema as CAF President at the General Assembly in Casablanca, in 1988. During the elections, Hayatou grabbed 22 votes as against 18 votes for the Togolese challenger Godfried Ekou√©. Under Hayatou' s leadership, African football has made giant strides. Until 1990, the African Cup of Nations paraded only eight finalists. However, through Hayatou's initiatives, this number has increased first in 1992 to 12 and since 1996 to 16 teams. * The African Youth Championship was redesigned in 1991 and now features eight teams in a final tournament every two years. * A competition for Under-17 has also followed suit since 1995. Three years later, a tournament for women, CAF Women Under-19 Championship was also staged. * The African Cup of Champions Clubs has also undergone remarkable innovations. Since 1997 it has transformed into the CAF Champions League with huge prize monies to be won by the top placed clubs. * In 2004, another international club competition, the CAF Confederation Cup, replaced both the CAF Cup and the African Cup Winners' Cup. It is played by teams who are runner-up in their local leagues as well as cup winners'. Prize money is also distributed to the top teams. * Giant strides have been achieved in the area of technical development since Hayatou took charge of the organisation. From a budget of 100,000 US Dollars, this area now commands in excess of 2,000,000 US Dollars. * CAF signed a protocol of understanding with UEFA in 1997 for the Meridian Project. As a result, every two years UEFA‚ÄìCAF Meridian Cup, an under-18 championship is held between teams from Africa and Europe. Also, every two years, UEFA supports two African national associations with financial and logistical assistance. Countries who have enjoyed this assistance include Chad, Namibia, Eritrea, Niger, Cape Verde and S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe. * The confederation has moved to its new headquarters in the southern suburbs of Cairo in October 2002. The ultra-modern edifice has four floors sitting on 5,000 square metres not far from the Great Pyramids of Giza. It set it back as much as four million dollars. * As a result of its extra earnings over years, CAF has undertaken from 2002 to pay the way of a delegate from each of the 53 member national associations to its General Assembly. This has boosted attendance and participation at all the next gatherings. * Hayatou has personally seen to the increase in Africa's representation at the various international competitions. From two to three teams at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States of America to five at the 1998 edition in France. Six African teams will feature at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. * It was under his leadership that an African country will finally stage the biggest football event in the world: The FIFA World Cup. * Under his tenure African teams have acquitted themselves at various competitions. Cameroon and Senegal both reached the quarter-finals in 1990 FIFA World Cup and 2002 FIFA World Cup, respectively. Nigeria and Cameroon also won Olympic gold in 1996 and 2000. * A developmental programme tagged Contract with Africa, which began in 2005, has also helped in stepping up grassroots, human resources and infrastructural growth across the continent. In 2005, a total of 1,300,000 US Dollars was allocated to 13 national associations namely Botswana, Malawi, Cape Verde, Gambia, Togo, Central African Republic, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, Djibouti, Eritrea and Rwanda. While in 2006, 13 other associations also received another 1,3000,000 US Dollars, which will be extended to more African national associations. The Emergency Committee of the executive office of the African Football Confederation met on November 17, 2008, in Douala, Cameroon. The committee endorsed the candidatures for the forthcoming elections on the Executive Committee of CAF and FIFA to be held during the Congress in February 2009 in Lagos, Nigeria. Mr. Issa Hayatou, will go through the elections unopposed. Today, CAF has 55 members, two members more than African Union as regard to R√©union and Zanzibar the CAF's associate members, unlike Western Sahara who is a member of the African Union but not of CAF. CAF celebrates 50-year anniversary In 2007, CAF celebrated its 50-year anniversary through organising a series of festivals in Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and South Africa so as to pay tribute to the four founding members. CAF who was born on February 8, 1957 in Khartoum started celebrating his anniversary on February 7, 2007 in Cairo, through organising a Gala international friendly match between Egypt, the 2006 African Cup of Nations champions and Sweden to raise funds for charity. Egypt won the match 2:0, scored by Ahmad Fathy and Amro Zaki During second part of the celebration CAF returned to its birthplace in Khartoum for its 28th General Assembly, the supreme authority of CAF. A forum on the future of African football and CAF member national associations‚Äô General Secretaries workshop were organized by the African football continental body. A very successful congress, presenting a historical documentary, The Anniversary Book, which was put together in a short time. The third part of the celebration took place in Addis Ababa where the 2006 CAF Super Cup final took place, winner of CAF MTN Champions league and winner of CAF Confederation Cup. The match was played on February 18 between Al Ahly (Egypt) and √âtoile Sportive du Sahel (Tunisia) in Addis Ababa Stadium. Al Ahly won the match 5:4 on PSO after 0:0 draw during full-time. The fourth and last part of the celebrations took place seven months later in South Africa with the annual CAF meeting and a Gala night as well as attending the international match between South Africa and Zambia in the qualification round for 2008 African Cup of Nations. During its annual Awards nights in December 2007, the African football Confederation, in collaboration with Globacom, will reward the 10 best African players in the last 50 years. =2010 Togo Expulsion Controversy= CAF has been the subject of widespread media controversy and criticism following a decision to ban Togo from the next two Africa Cup of Nations matches, after Togo briefly withdrew then tried to rejoin the competition following an armed ambush on their bus which wounded and killed several passengers, including players. Togo appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, with FIFA president Sepp Blatter stepping in to mediate. The ban was subsequently lifted with immediate effect on 14 May 2010, after a meeting of the CAF Executive Committee.

The parish is on the boundary with Oxfordshire, about northwest of Banbury. The parish includes the contiguous villages of Middle and Upper Tysoe and the separate hamlet of Lower Tysoe. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,143. Toponym The earliest known surviving record of the place-name is as Tiheshoche in the Domesday Book of 1086. It was Tiesoch in the reign of Henry I (1100‚Äì35), Thiesho in a charter from 1131‚Äì40 and Tisho in a royal roll from 1201. The name is derived from the Old English Tƒ´ges h≈çh, meaning \\"spur of land belonging to the god T√Ωr\\". Eilert Ekwall speculated: \\"The etymology suggested is rendered likely by the fact that at Tysoe was a cut figure of a horse, after which the Vale of the Red Horse was named. The horse may have been a monument to a victory won by the Anglo-Saxons dedicated to the war-god.\\" Ekwall was referring to the Red Horse of Tysoe, a hill figure which was recorded as late as 1607 but which is now lost. Parish church The earliest parts of the Church of England parish church of The Assumption of the Bless√©d Virgin Mary are two blocked windows on the south side of the nave, which date from late in the 11th century. The south aisle of the nave was added in the middle of the 12th century. In the 13th century the south arcade was extended from three bays to four and the three original arches were altered to give them a pointed Gothic shape. The north aisle was added later and is Decorated Gothic. The nave has a clerestory that was added in the 14th century. In the 15th century the south porch was added, new Perpendicular Gothic windows were inserted and the present west tower was built. The west tower has a ring of six bells. Richard Sanders of Bromsgrove, Worcestershire cast the treble, second, third and tenor bells in 1719. Abel Rudhall of Gloucester cast the fourth bell in 1750. Matthew III Bagley of Chacombe, Northamptonshire cast the fifth bell in 1782. The church has also a Sanctus bell cast by William Blews and Sons of Birmingham in 1866. In 1854 the church was restored under the direction of the architect George Gilbert Scott. The church is a Grade I listed building. In the churchyard is a 15th-century preaching cross, which is a Grade II* listed building. Economic and social history The oldest part of Tysoe Manor House in Upper Tysoe is the 14th- century hall range. A two-storey wing was added to the house in the 17th century. The house was extended again in 1932‚Äì33. It is a Grade II* listed building. All three Tysoe settlements include 17th-century buildings, especially Middle Tysoe, which was once the main village of the parish. Tysoe Windmill About south of Lower Tysoe is an 18th-century tower mill. The tower is built of local ironstone. Tysoe has a Church of England primary school.Tysoe Church of England Primary School George Gilbert Scott designed the school's original building, which was built in 1856. Extensions to the building were added in the 1980s and 2005. The agricultural trade unionist Joseph Ashby was born in Tysoe in 1859. His daughter Kathleen Ashby, teacher and historian, was born in Tysoe in 1892 and wrote her father's biography.

History  In 1902, the Bishop of Medell√≠n, Joaqu√≠n Pardo Vergara, created the St. Julian vice- parish (), which had approximately 3,000 inhabitants and a simple straw chapel, built by the Sons√≥n's priest, Daniel Florencio S√°nchez, with the help of the parishioners. On June 26 of the same year, Juan Manuel Contreras was appointed as vice-parson. The vice-parish was created as a part of the parish of Sons√≥n. On July 29, 1903, Pardo Vergara made a pastoral visit, during which he authorized the parson to present some unused ornaments to the vice-parish, including a harmonium, the first in Argelia, played by the young Nacianceno Ram√≠rez Pavas, future organist of the Metropolitan Cathedral of Medell√≠n for more than 40 years. One of the first goals of Contreras, was to build a church capable of accommodating all the parishioners. He requested the permission of the prelate, which was granted. A directive assembly was created, with Contreras as the president, Nazario L√≥pez as vice-president, Vicente Fl√≥rez as treasurer, Primitivo Giraldo as secretary, and Cr√≠spulo Alzate as councilman, the same post of Ram√≥n Mar√≠a Toro. On August 23, 1903, the first stone was laid, in the presence of Abel Mar√≠a Naranjo, parson of Abejorral, Isaac √Ångel, co-assistant of Sons√≥n, and Isaac Cardona, parson of Aquitania. Argelia was visited by the Archbishop Manuel Jos√© Caicedo on August 28, 1907, the first prelate visiting the vice-parish. By the time of his visit, the church was not initiated, except the \\"tapias\\" (walls), because the people had prioritised building the curate's home. Caicedo encouraged the inhabitants of the village to contribute money or time to the building of the church as a priority. Towards the middle of 1911, with Contreras still the vice-parson, Archbishop Caicedo made a second pastoral visit. Nave. On the suggestion of the parson of Sons√≥n, Tiberio de Jes√∫s Salazar y Herrera (future archbishop of Medell√≠n), Caicedo promoted Contreras to co-assistant on April 25, 1913, but he died on July 6 of the same year. Alzate, who designed the first emplacement of Argelia, was the director of the construction, and in August 1918, the archbishop created the parish of Argelia, mediating his own decree. On April 29, 1923, the main facade was started using granite, mined from a nearby quarry at the direction of Juan de Dios D√≠az. On March 13, 1927, the facade was almost finished, and the inside had a main altar. In 1937, Vargas was removed and Alberto Londo√±o was named as his replacement. Londo√±o was the parson for nearly seven years and replaced the old doors, and the brick floor was replaced with tiles. A clock was also added, bought for $ 180\\\\. The clock had previously been the property of Sons√≥n's church, and later, part of the Chapel of Jesus (), whose chaplain was Ram√≥n El√≠as Botero. Londo√±o was replaced by Mario √Ångel, and he by Antonio √Ångel in 1956. Antonio √Ångel bought the via crucis, the lamps and the candelabras. On March 18, 1957, the Diocese of Sons√≥n was created (today, the Diocese of Sons√≥n-Rionegro), and the parish became a part of the new diocese.

It is most frequently used for seamless countertop installations. Solid Surface Top Seamless Integral Kitchen Sink Integral Cove Slash with Wall Panel Solid surface was first introduced by DuPont in 1967 under the name of Corian. Since the expiration of their patent other manufacturers have entered the market with their own branded products. Performance characteristics Solid surface is a non-porous low-maintenance material used for surfaces such as countertops. It can mimic the appearance of granite, marble, stone, and other naturally occurring materials, and can be joined nearly invisibly by a trained craftsman. Typically manufactured in sheet form for fabrication into finished countertops, solid surface can also be cast into a variety of shapes, including sinks, shower pans and bathtubs. Sheet goods can also be heated and bent into three-dimensional shapes using a process called thermoforming, which adds to the versatility of the product. Color and design flexibility are key factors when choosing engineered composites over natural stone. In a residential setting, solid surface can be used as kitchen countertops, bathroom vanity tops, and shower and tub surrounds. Countertop fabricators typically join solid surface sheets into desired shapes using a two-part adhesive, after which the cured joint is machined flat. The same method is used to build up edge thickness, which can be profiled using tools and techniques similar to those used to work hardwoods. A major appeal of solid surface is its impermeability. Solid surface sinks can be joined to the countertop surface with no gaps, which eliminates areas for water to collect and bacteria to grow. Integral backsplashes can also be created that follow the contours of the wall ‚Äúseamlessly‚Äù and without gaps. Should the material become scratched or broken, solid surface can, in most cases, be repaired quickly by a certified solid surface repair company or trained fabricator. Cracked sinks can be replaced as well. Because the surface is solid throughout, a countertop that has undergone years of wear and tear can be refinished. The installed product is available in a variety of finishes, ranging from matte to high-gloss, although most manufacturers recommend a matte or satin finish for ease of maintenance. Availability Solid surface is available in hundreds of colors and visual textures, ranging from solid colors to sparkling, marbleized, or granite effect. Dozens of multinational companies manufacture solid surface sheet goods and sinks for the world market; and hundreds of smaller, regional manufacturers produce for local markets. Although solid surface faces competition from natural stone and engineered stone/quartz surfacing, the material is popular in Asia, particularly in residential new construction. An emerging market for solid surface is in commercial and industrial settings, where its non-porous characteristics, combined with durability, renewability and formability make it the material of choice for many designers and architects. Also appealing, is the wide range of colors and textures, as well as the ability to custom- color the material for large projects. Hospitals, in particular, employ large amounts of solid surface for sinks, showers, nursing stations and wall cladding, because its seamless properties eliminate gaps and crevices that harbor harmful bacteria.  Manufacture  Solid surface is manufactured by mixing acrylic, epoxide or polyester resin with powdered bauxite filler and pigments. The material chemically cures and is heated to 60 ¬∞C or more. Cured material is then cut in sheets or shapes and sanded on one or both sides depending the brand used. Sometimes the material is brought to 160 ¬∞C and cooled, to improve its heat resistance. Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be mixed one sheet at a time using different formulations, effects and appearances. Acrylic-modified polyester solid surface can be injected into molds to produce various solid decorative design figures. Solid-surface manufacturing companies may be members of the trade organizations American Composites Manufacturers Association, ISFA (International Surface Fabricators Association, and ICPA (International Cast Polymer Association).International Cast Polymer Association These organizations identify the product under the \\"brand\\" of MasterCast Engineered Composites. Solid surface can also be moulded using dedicated moulds. For example free standing baths are manufactured using a two-part mould tool which creates a cavity for the material to be poured into. Once the mould has been prepared for casting, the material is mixed and degassed in an automated casting machine. It is then injected into the cavity of the mould. Many finishes are available including, gel coated, matte, gloss, metallic and textured. Fabrication A surface fabricator shapes and installs functional and decorative surfaces, usually in buildings. Surface fabrication, as a distinct professional enterprise, usually involves complex tasks of surface shaping. A leading case is countertop fabrication. =Materials= For interior spaces, surfaces include solid coverings or decking for floors or walls, and countertops for kitchens, bathrooms, and workspaces. Natural surfaces are composed of naturally occurring materials like wood, stone, mineral, metals, clay, gum and resin. Synthetic surfaces contain, in addition to any natural materials, man-made substances such as metal alloys or polymers. Solid surfaces are synthetic surfaces manufactured from polymeric materials. = Tools = Tools of surface fabrication include routers, drills, templates, clamps, ovens, suction cup grips, and table saws. Larger surface fabricators may also use CNC routers. For all but the simplest jobs, surface fabrication usually takes place in the workshop, after which the finished product is assembled and installed at the work site. Installation of multi-part surfaces, such as \\"L\\" and \\"U\\" shaped countertops, often involves complex work with specialized tools, to create a seamless result. Applications Solid surfaces is used in the following environment : *Kitchen/Bathroom: kitchen worktops with integrated sink, vanity countertop, bath tub etc. *Hospitality/Catering: bars, tables, reception desks etc. *Shop Fitting: displays, counters, wall cladding etc. *Airports: check-in counters *Public buildings: displays in museums, facades, meeting tables etc. *Hospitals: laboratory countertops, decontamination sinks, endoscopy etc. Solid surface is priced to compete with natural stone or quartz surfacing. It is available in many colors and patterns. The material can be formed to shape, which makes it appealing to commercial and industrial designers. Specialist fabricators possess the skills and knowledge necessary to provide advice and customer service. Certain high-heat applications (anything above 400 F /200 C) are discouraged, due to the danger of cracking. Because scratches in solid surface appear white to the human eye, most dark colors are not recommended for high use areas.

Education and career Abedin was born and brought up in Dhaka, Bangladesh. She is the only child of her parents, Mohammad Joynal Abedin, (born 1932), a retired businessman who at that time owned a clothing factory and several shops, and Begum Sofia Kamal, (born 1941), a housewife.

It was written by Petar Zoraniƒá in 1536 and published posthumously in Venice in 1569. The story tells about a poet's imaginary seven-day journey across Croatian mountains on which he embarks in order to forget his love miseries. Although pastoral in form, the principal line of the story is patriotic in character. It is composed of 24 chapters, and the introductory contains a dedication to Matej Matijeviƒá, the canon of Nin. Plot summary The hero is the shepherd Zoran (i.e. Zoraniƒá himself), who for seven years has been suffering from unrequited love towards a maiden Jaga. One morning, wandering around, he arrives to a well called Vodica, having gotten bored with his life. Suddenly from a well a fairy Zorica (Napeja) appears, advising him to go for the mountains to find a particular plant which will cure his love pain. Then on a golden apple he makes a notice of a beautiful fairy Grace (Milo≈°ƒáa) which transfers him across the seas to Podgorje, where he continues the journey by himself. But, soon he runs into a beast, from which Grace saves him and leads him by safer pathways. Afterwards, he arrives to the Gates of hell (Paklenica), where the fairy tells him a tale on a young maiden Bura. The next day Zoran meets a company of shepherds with whom he spends the next three days. On the fifth day, Zoran hears from shepherds a story on the origin of Velebit and heads further to the east. There he discovers a small group of shepherds that complains of being attacked by the wolves from eastern sides (i.e. Turks), which has caused many of the shepherds to flee those areas. The next day Zoran is contacted by a fairy Consciousness (Svist) who directs him to the fairy Dinara. Dinara frees him by her magic powers from his love sufferings. Then Zoran dreams a vision of four fairies in a \\"gardens of Glory\\" (perivoj od Slave). These are the fairies Latinness (Latinka), Helleness (Grkinja) and Croatess (Hrvatica). While the first three hold in their arms a handful of golden apples (the symbol of a literary piece), the fairy Croatess is poor and makes a complaint on the small number of literary pieces written in folk language. The sixth day Zoran heads for home, but on his way he meets Dinara's daughter, fairy Krka, which drives him across Knin, Skradin and ≈†ibenik down to the mouth of Krka (where she makes her disappearance). Thence, fairy Grace returns him back to Zaton, the place of his departure. There he finds a grave of Juraj Divniƒá, the bishop of Nin, and swears to follow the path of Lord's love. Meaning and edification Zoraniƒá lived in times of a great danger from invading Ottoman Turks, and that consciousness has inspired his work; it pervaded it with patriotic fervour, against which all poet's personal sufferings, wishes and troubles pale and retreat. It is a pastoral-allegorical novel (a very common type of prose in that period), written mostly in prose but with many passages in verse. Typologically it's a unique piece of its kind in Croatian literature, with motifs borrowed from Latinate and Italian literatures, with clearly discernible influences of Virgil, Ovid, Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, Jacopo Sannazaro, as well as domicile writers such as Marko Maruliƒá and Croatian zaƒçinjavci. Planine are in fact an allegory: they are a dream, transferred to the alleged Zoran's path from Nin across the sea to Starigrad under the Velebit, and thence uphills, over Paklenica, across the Velebit, and from Lika to Dinara, where he would by the river of Krka settle down to ≈†ibenik and thence by the sea back to Nin. Accompanied by stanzas of Petrarchan and pastoral voice, Zoraniƒá's novel, imbuing with life an Arcadian idyll, echoes with \\"sorrowful shpard's tune of dispersed legacy\\" (tu≈æbenim pojem pastirov od rasute ba≈°ƒáine), but it also answers the call of fairy Croatess in the gardens of glory (chapter 20): she objurgates Croats who \\"many sapient and lettered are, who thyself and their tongue joyously appraise and deck apt are\\" (mnozi mudri i nauƒçeni jesu, ki sebe i jazik svoj zadovoljno pohvaliti i naresiti umili bi) but are ashamed of their Croatian language (jezika hrvackoga) and rather prefer to write in a foreign tongue. So Zoraniƒá, three centuries before the advent of the Illyrian movement, made a defense of the Croatian language, which is one of the most important attributes of this piece.

Thus it is equal to 1000 x the reciprocal of the sex ratio (ratio of males to females in a population) in the same age group, i.e. under age seven. An imbalance in this age group will extend to older age groups in future years. Currently, the ratio of males to females is generally significantly greater than 1, i.e. there are more boys than girls. According to the decennial Indian census, the sex ratio in the 0-6 age group in India went from 104.0 males per 100 females in 1981 to 105.8 in 1991, to 107.8 in 2001, to 108.8 in 2011.India at Glance - Population Census 2011 - Final Census of India, Government of India (2013) The ratio is significantly higher in certain states such as Punjab and Haryana (118 and 120 respectively per 2011 census).Census of India 2011: Child sex ratio drops to lowest since Independence The Economic Times, India The child sex ratio has been more prominent for males in India for quite a while, since the 1980s with thirty fewer females to males  Likelihood of an imbalanced child sex ratio  The natural \\"sex ratio at birth\\" is often considered to be around 105. This means that at birth on average, there are 105 males for every 100 females.http://www.searo.who.int/entity/health_situation_trends/data/chi/sex- ratio/en/ Thus a significant departure from the ratio of 1.05 boys per every girl born indicates an imbalanced child sex ratio. Thus, India had a natural child sex ratio before 1981. A large city in India, Jhajjar had almost 15,000 more baby boys than baby girls, that is 128 boys per 100 girls.  Variables that change the child sex ratio  = Sex-Selective Abortions = In the Asian culture, families want baby boys, because it is traditional that the boys take care of the parents, while the daughters marry and leave the family. These families want to ensure elderly security, therefore they want more boys in the family. Typically it cost more to have a daughter and they cannot contribute to the family nearly as much as the son can. These factors cause family to get an abortion because they want the variables that the boys have to offer, and unfortunately it causes the child male to child female sex ratio it be imbalanced.  Impact of skewed ratio  The impact of a skewed sex ratio‚Äîwith more male children than females‚Äîis already being felt in some parts of India and China and is likely to continue to tighten the skewed ratio between genders.: * When there are fewer women of marriageable age, a significant proportion of men will have to delay their marriage. This is known as the \\"marriage squeeze.\\" This is when one group, of marriage eligible men, choose brides from a group of women that is fewer in numbers than the males. When the next group of eligibility enters the group there will be leftover men from the prior group added to current, group. If the woman sex ratio of eligible marriage age is significantly smaller than the men, there will be a resulting decline in fertility. * This will initially affect younger generations of men in their 20s. These men will not only be in surplus within their cohort (age group), but they will also face competition from a backlog of older, unmarried men, who will still be in the marriage market. * This problem will not be overcome simply by delaying marriage, due to the cumulative impact of the skewed sex ratio over several generations. Thus a proportion of men will in due course have to forgo marriage altogether. The poorest males will be disproportionately affected by this marriage squeeze. This may cause destabilization and may translate into class-based tensions. * A larger amount of unmarried men can cause havoc in the country. Relationships and marriage potentially keep these men out of trouble, therefore with the problem of not having enough women for men to marry can cause men to make poor decisions. Typically the men who are not able to marry are those of middle to low socioeconomic classes who do not have as much education, potentially leading to closing themselves off to society and engaging in violent behavior.

Mathematical Structures in Computer Science 14(3):329--366, 2004.Farhad Arbab: Puff, The Magic Protocol. In Gul Agha, Olivier Danvy, Jose Meseguer, editors, Talcott Festschrift, volume 7000 of LNCS, pages 169-206. Springer, 2011. is a domain-specific language for programming and analyzing coordination protocols that compose individual processes into full systems, broadly construed. Examples of classes of systems that can be composed with Reo include component-based systems, service- oriented systems, multithreading systems, biological systems, and cryptographic protocols. Reo has a graphical syntax in which every Reo program, called a connector or circuit, is a labeled directed hypergraph. Such a graph represents the data-flow among the processes in the system. Reo has formal semantics, which stand at the basis of its various formal verification techniques and compilation tools.  Definitions  In Reo, a concurrent system consists of a set of components which are glued together by a circuit that enables flow of data between components. Components can perform I/O operations on the boundary nodes of the circuit to which they are connected. There are two kinds of I/O operations: put-requests dispatch data items to a node, and get-requests fetch data items from a node. All I/O operations are blocking, which means that a component can proceed only after its pending I/O operation has been successfully processed. The figure on the top-right shows an example of a producers-consumer system with three components: two producers on the left and one consumer on the right. The circuit in the middle defines the protocol, which states that the producers should send data synchronously, while the consumer receives those data in alternating order. Formally, the structure of a circuit is defined as follows: Definition 1. A circuit is a triple R = (N, B, C, t) where: # is a set of nodes; # B \\\\subseteq N is a set of boundary nodes; # C \\\\subseteq 2^N \\\\times 2^N is a set of channels; # t : C \\\\rightarrow T assigns a types to every channel. such that I \\\\cup O = 2, for all (I,O) \\\\in C. If c = (I,O) \\\\in C is a channel, then is called the set of input nodes of and is called the set of output nodes of . The dynamics of a circuit resemble the flow of signals through an electronic circuit. Nodes have fixed merger-replicator behavior: the data of one of the incoming channels is propagated to all outgoing channels, without storing or altering the data (i.e., replicator behavior). If multiple incoming channels can provide data, the node makes a nondeterministic choice among them (i.e., merger behavior). Nodes with only incoming or outgoing channels are called sink nodes or source nodes, respectively; nodes with both incoming and outgoing channels are called mixed nodes. In contrast to nodes, channels have user-defined behavior represented by their type. This means that channels may store or alter data items that flow through them. Although every channel connects exactly two nodes, these nodes need not to be input and output. For instance, the vertical channel in the figure on the top-right has two inputs and no outputs. The channel type defines the behavior of the channel with respect to data. Below is a list of common types: * : Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node. * : Same as Sync, but can lose data if its output node is not ready to take data. * : Gets data from its input node, temporarily stores it in an internal buffer of size , and propagates it to its output node (whenever this output node is ready to take data). * : Atomically gets data from both its input nodes and loses it. * : Atomically gets data from its input node and propagates it to its output node if the filter condition is satisfied; loses the data otherwise.  Software Engineering Properties  = Exogeneity = One way to classify coordination languages is in terms of their locus: locus of coordination refers to where coordination activity takes place, classifying coordination models and languages as endogenous or exogenous.Farhad Arbab: Composition of Interacting Computations. In Dina Goldin, Scott Smolka, and Peter Wegner, editors, Interactive Computation, pages 277-321. Springer, 2006. Endogenous models and languages, such as Linda, provide primitives that must be incorporated within a computation for its coordination. In applications that use such models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are inside the module itself. In contrast, Reo is an exogenous language that provides primitives that support coordination of entities from without. In applications that use exogenous models, primitives that affect the coordination of each module are outside the module itself. Endogenous models are sometimes more natural for a given application. However, they generally lead to an intermixing of coordination primitives with computation code, which entangles the semantics of computation with coordination protocols. This intermixing tends to scatter communication/coordination primitives throughout the source code, making the cooperation model and the coordination protocol of an application nebulous and implicit: generally, there is no piece of source code identifiable as the cooperation model or the coordination protocol of an application, that can be designed, developed, debugged, maintained, and reused, in isolation from the rest of the application code. On the other hand, exogenous models encourage development of coordination modules separately and independently of the computation modules they are supposed to coordinate. Consequently, the result of the substantial effort invested in the design and development of the coordination component of an application can manifest itself as tangible \\"pure coordinator modules\\" which are easier to understand, and can also be reused in other applications. = Compositionality / Reusability = Reo circuits are compositional. This means that one can construct complex circuits by reusing simpler circuits. To be more explicit, two circuits can be glued together on their boundary nodes to form a new joint circuit. Unlike many other models of concurrency (e.g., pi-calculus), synchrony is preserved under composition. This means that if we compose a circuit with synchronous flow between nodes A and B with another circuit with synchronous flow between nodes B and C, the joint circuit has synchronous flow between nodes A and C. In other words, the composition of two synchronous circuits yields a synchronous circuit.  Semantics  The semantics of a Reo circuit is a formal description of its behavior. Various semantics for Reo exist.Sung-Shik Jongmans and Farhad Arbab: Overview of Thirty Semantic Formalisms for Reo. Scientific Annals of Computer Science 22(1):201-251, 2012. Historically the first semantics of Reo was based on the coalgebraic notion of streams (i.e., infinite sequences).Farhad Arbab and Jan Rutten: A Coinductive Calculus of Component Connectors. In Martin Wirsing, Dirk Pattinson, and Rolf Hennicker, editors, Proceedings of WADT 2002, volume 2755 of LNCS, pages 34--55. Springer, 2003. This semantics is based on the concept of a timed data stream, which is a pair consisting of a stream of data items and a stream of monotonically increasing time stamps (real numbers). By associating every node with such a timed data stream, the behavior of a channel can be modeled as a relation on the streams on the connected nodes. Later, an automaton-based semantics was developed, which is called constraint automata.Christel Baier, Marjan Sirjani, Farhad Arbab, and Jan Rutten: Modeling component connectors in Reo by constraint automata. Science of Computer Programming 61(2):75-113, 2006. A constraint automaton is a labeled transition system, where transition labels consist of a synchronization constraint and a data constraint. A synchronization constraint specifies which nodes synchronize in the execution step modeled by the transition, and a data constraint specifies which data items flow on these nodes. One limitation of constraint automata (and timed data streams) is that they cannot directly model context-sensitive behavior, where the behavior of a channel depends on the (un)availability of a pending I/O operation. For example, using constraint automata, it is impossible to directly model the behavior of a LossySync, which should lose data only if its output node has no pending get-request. To solve this problem, another semantics of Reo has been developed, called connector coloring.Dave Clarke and David Costa and Farhad Arbab: Connector colouring I: Synchronisation and context dependency. Science of Computer Programming 66(3):205-225, 2007. Other semantics for Reo make it possible to model timedFarhad Arbab, Christel Baier, Frank de Boer, and Jan Rutten: Models and temporal logical specifications for timed component connectors.

Journal of Universal Computer Science 11(10):1718-1748, 2005. behavior.  Implementations  The Extensible Coordination Tools (ECT) are a set of plug- ins for Eclipse that constitute an integrated development environment (IDE) for Reo. The ECT consists of a graphical editor for drawing circuits and an animation engine for animating data-flow through circuits. For code generation, the ECT contains a Reo-to-Java compiler, which generates code for circuits based on their constraint automaton semantics. In particular, on input of a Reo circuit, it produces a Java class, which simulates the constraint automaton that models the circuit. For verification, the ECT contains a tool that translates Reo circuits to process definitions in mCRL2. Users can subsequently use mCRL2 for model checking against mu-calculus property specifications. (Alternatively, the Vereofy model checker also supports verification of Reo circuits.) Another implementation of Reo is developed in the Scala programming language and executes circuits in a distributed fashion.Jos√© Proen√ßa: Synchronous Coordination of Distributed Components.

Background In January 1900, 18-year-old Roosevelt and his Groton friend Lathrop Brown engaged rooms in Westmorly Court, (now B-Entry of Adams House). Built in 1898 and designed by the noted architects Warren and Wetmore (who also were responsible for Grand Central Station in New York) Westmorly was the newest and most luxurious building on what was called Harvard's Gold Coast, an area of luxury apartments for wealthy University students. The first floor suite chosen by FDR was equipped with all the latest innovations ‚Äì central steam heat, electricity, a modern \\"hygienic\\" bathroom, and contained over of living space spread across four rooms, with 14' ceilings, French doors, and a working fireplace ‚Äì all this when only a few buildings at the College enjoyed such modern conveniences. The rooms were meticulously decorated in high Edwardian style by FDR's mother Sara Delano Roosevelt and FDR himself, and were used by FDR during his entire four years at Harvard. After FDR left Harvard, the rooms were occupied by a succession of students until 1961. In June 1961, during Eleanor Roosevelt's visit to the College, the former first lady dedicated a plaque commemorating FDR's time there, and the rooms were converted into a study, officially named \\"The FDR Suite\\". After a brief return to student housing in the early 2000s, the rooms were finally set aside in perpetuity with the intention of creating Harvard's first memorial to Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The Restoration Begun in 2008, the restoration of Roosevelt's room consumed 6 years of research and $300,000, and was largely completed in 2014. The effort was led by the Franklin Delano Roosevelt Foundation Inc (formerly: the FDR Suite Foundation, an independent 501(c)3 US public charity led a group of interested individuals and Harvard alumni who privately raised the capital required to complete the project. The Suite is fully furnished with examples of period furniture, and contains almost 2000 period objects, much of it rare Harvard ephemera re-assembled in Cambridge from private collections worldwide. The restoration is intended not only to shed new light on the early years of one of the most influential American presidents of the 20th century, but to form one of the most illustrative collections of student life in the Gilded Age life anywhere in the world. The Suite is not open to the general public, but is routinely opened for Harvard students, alumni and affiliates, and maintains an active web presence. The Suite also functions as the physical and spiritual home of the Foundation, which maintains an active presence at the College, sponsoring scholarships under its FDR Global Citizenship Program, and also hosting the programs of the new Franklin Delano Roosevelt Center for Global Engagement, an innovation diplomacy think-tank. The Foundation has also published an illustrated history of Roosevelt, FDR: A Life in Pictures, which features pictures of the Suite.

Her New Discoveries are considered as indispensable for Swami Vivekananda research. Biography Marie Louise Burke was born in 1912 in the United States. =Religious life= In 1948, she was introduced to the Ramakrishna- Vivekananda movement by Swami Ashokananda. In 1957, Advaita Ashrama published her biography of Swami Vivekananda, Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries in two volumes, well known in the Vedanta circles, and the book was later published in six volumes in 1983‚Äî87. She also wrote articles in Vedanta journals. In 1974 in India, Burke took her vows of Brahmacharya from the Ramakrishna Mission. At that time she was given the monastic name \\"Gargi\\" (this name was inspired by Vedic scholar Gargi). In 1983, Burke was awarded the first Vivekananda Award by the Ramakrishna Mission for her research works on Swami Vivekananda. Later she took her final vows of Sannyasa, and was given the name Pravrajika Prajnaprana. Burke continued writing even in her 90s and continued staying at Vedanta Society of Northern California in San Francisco. She died on January 20, 2004 after suffering from cancer, at the convent of the Vendanta Society in San Francisco. = Author = Gargi was encouraged to write by her teacher, Swami Ashokananda. He asked her to write about Swami Vivekananda, but told her she could write about himself when she was finished with her work on Vivekananda.  Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries  Swami Vivekananda in the West: New Discoveries, a series of biographical books, were Gargi's most prominent work. This series of book was first published in two volumes in 1957. In 1983-87 these series was republished in six volumes. Swami Vivekananda spent a number of years teaching and lecturing in the West (specially in America and England). Gargi researched for many years and then published her findings in these works. She wrote about Vivekananda's spiritual quest‚Äî \\"Quite literally, he planted the seeds of spirituality deep in the hearts of innumerable human beings, changing the course of their lives forever... He was a prophet who prepared us to meet the modern age, which not only needs philosophy or Vedanta to solve its many and complex problems but requires thousands of spiritually awakened people to put that philosophy into practice and make it a living force in the future history of the world.\\"  Books on Swami Ashokananda  Gargi wrote multiple books on the life of Swami Ashokananda (1893‚Äî1969), a monk of the Ramakrishna Order who spent his life expanding the Ramakrishna‚ÄîVivekananda movement in northern California. Ashokananda was Gargi's teacher who initiated her into the Ramakrishna-Vivekananda movement in 1948. In 2003 her book A Heart Poured Out: A Story of Swami Ashokananda was published. In this book she discussed the life of Swami Ashokananda. She explained the reason of writing a book on Ashokananda in this book's preface‚Äî > Why, then, have I tried to write about Swami Ashokananda, who habitually > dwelt in high altitudes of the Spirit where we cannot or think we cannot, > follow? I write about him because in whatever height he had has moorings, > his heart beat in tune with that of every human being who aspires upward, > and he led us with a firm and unerring hand into his own realm, where, he > was convinced, we all belong. In short, I have written about him because he > was an authentic spiritual teacher whom each of us can benefit by knowing. In the 2004 book Shafts of Light: Selected Teachings of Swami Ashokananda for Spiritual Practice, Gargi presented Swami Ashokananda ideals and selected teachings. The 2003 book A Disciple's Journal: In the Company of Swami Ashokananda had autobiographical components.  Other books  Swami Trigunatita: His Life and Work was published from Vedanta Society of Northern California in 1997.

A. Hyatt Mayor's father was marine biologist Alfred Goldsborough Mayor (1868‚Äì1922) and his mother was sculptor Harriet Hyatt Mayor. His grandfather, whose name he carried, was the paleontologist Alpheus Hyatt. Mayor came from an artistic family; his mother's sister was the well-known sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, and her husband was art patron Archer Milton Huntington, founder of the Hispanic Society of America in 1904. Mayor received his B.A. from Princeton University (1922) and then received a Rhodes scholarship, which he used to earn his second bachelor's degree at Christ Church, Oxford in 1926. The next few years he spent in Florence, Italy and at the American School of Classical Studies. Upon returning to the United States he embarked on a literary career, working on Hound & Horn. He married Virginia Sluder in 1932 and then joined the Department of Prints at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, becoming curator of the department in 1946. He had to follow the massive figure of William Ivins, Jr., whose curatorship had lasted 30 years. His tenure was marked by significant acquisitions of engravings, woodcuts, and other printed material, some by then-unknown artists who proved later to be eminently collectible. Many European collections became available after World War II, and there were notable acquisitions, especially from the collection of the Prince of Lichtenstein. He also expanded the concept of collectible prints to include wine labels and cigarette cards. In 1952 he published Prints and People: A Social History of Printed Pictures, which has remained continuously in print. In 1966 he retired from the Museum as curator emeritus and directed his efforts to various art-related projects and writings, in particular his translation and updating of the catalogues of Max Lehrs and the initiation, with Anthony Blunt and others, of the massive and still ongoing Illustrated Bartsch series of print catalogues. In 1955 he had succeeded his uncle Archer as president of the Hispanic Society of America, and he continued to serve until 1980. He also served as a trustee of the American Federation of Arts and of Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina. He was awarded a Boston Museum Award in 1971.

The Head of a Philosopher is a fragment of a 5th- century BC bronze sculpture, discovered in 1969 on a shipwreck in the Straits of Messina. The wreck dates to the end of the fifth century. The date of the Porticello bronze head is uncertain: Alain Pasquier dates it to c.460-440 BC, but Enrico Paribeni suggests the late fourth or early third century. In order to reconcile this later date with the late-fifth century context of the shipwreck, it has been suggested that there were in fact two wrecks, one earlier and one later. Brunilde Ridgway rejects this suggestion, noting that other bronze fragments found in the wreck, which apparently derive from the same original sculpture, are stylistically closer to the mid-fifth century BC. It is part-damaged, lacking its laurel wreath, left eye and the hair on the back of its head, while the mangled fragments of a hand and a cloak were found with it, which has led to the head's identification as a philosopher. It is now held at the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia in Reggio. References Works cited Further reading *Dafas, K. A., 2019.

Since there are no known conditions where stars devoid of hydrogen can be formed from molecular clouds, it is theorized that they are the product of the mergers of helium-core and carbon-oxygen core white dwarfs. Properties Extreme helium stars form a sub-group within the broader category of hydrogen-deficient stars. The latter includes cool carbon stars like R Coronae Borealis variables, helium-rich spectral class O or B stars, population I Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, AM CVn stars, white dwarfs of spectral type WC, and transition stars like PG 1159. The first known extreme helium star, HD 124448, was discovered in 1942 by Daniel M. Popper at the McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas, United States. This star displayed no lines of hydrogen in its spectrum, but strong helium lines as well as the presence of carbon and oxygen. The second, PV Telescopii, was discovered in 1952, and by 1996 a total of 25 candidates had been found. (This list was narrowed to 21 by 2006.) A common characteristic of these stars is that the abundance ratio of carbon to helium is always in the range of 0.3 to 1%. This is despite wide variation of other abundance ratios in EHe stars. The known extreme helium stars are supergiants where hydrogen is underabundant by a factor of 10,000 or more. The surface temperatures of these stars range from 9,000‚Äì35,000 K. They are primarily composed of helium, with the second most abundant element, carbon, forming about one atom per 100 atoms of helium. The chemical composition of these stars implies that they have undergone both hydrogen and helium burning at some stage of their evolution. Theoretical models Two possible scenarios were proposed to explain the composition of extreme helium stars. # The double-degenerate (DD) model explained the stars as forming in a binary system consisting of a smaller helium white dwarf and a more massive carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Both stars had ceased to produce energy through nuclear fusion and were now compact objects. The emission of gravitational radiation caused their orbit to decay until they merged. If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, the helium will accrete onto the C-O dwarf and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this will become an EHe star before cooling to become a white dwarf. # The final-flash (FF) model suggested that an EHe star could form as a late evolutionary stage of a star after if had left the asymptotic giant branch. As the star is cooling to form a white dwarf, helium ignites in a shell around the core, causing the outer layers to expand rapidly. If the hydrogen in this envelope is consumed, the star becomes hydrogen deficient and it contracts to form an EHe. Examination of element abundances from seven EHe stars agreed with those predicted by the DD model.

Biography Carl Ludvig Thilson Locher was born in Flensburg in the Duchy of Schleswig which was then part of Denmark. From an early age he took an interest in ships and received his first training from his father who painted ship portraits for a living. After the father died, he continued his business for a short while and went on several voyages with ships of the Royal Danish Navy. Struck by the grandeur of the Atlantic Ocean, a voyage to the Danish West Indies made a particular impression on him. Even before he began his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Art in 1872, he was encouraged by Holger Drachmann to spend a couple of months in Skagen, the artists colony in the far north of Jutland. He quickly completed paintings of the beach, some with fishing boats or wrecks. He also became interested in the horse-drawn carriage which travelled along the beach on its journey from Frederikshavn.Carl Locher from Skagen's Museum. Retrieved 15 December 2008. In the 1870s, Locher continued his studies in Paris where he trained at the studio of L√©on Bonnat 1875-76, 1878-79. He visited Skagen whenever he was back in Denmark. Ultimately he had a house built there where he lived until his death. As an etcher Locher was regarded among the best and most productive of the Danish artists; From 1885 he made a number of smaller and larger prints, with a lot of picturesque energy. In 1892, he devoted most of his time to the art of etching, and travelled - with support from the Danish state - to Berlin, where he became a student of the excellent copper etching artist professor Hans Meyer (1846-1910) at the Berlin University of the Arts (Hochschule der K√ºnste Berlin). A complete collection of his prints can be found at Skagens Museum. Supported by the State, he opened an etching school for Danish artists in Copenhagen, where he taught until 1900.

The battle took place along the Sagra river. This river cannot be precisely identified, but may be the present-day Torbido or the Allaro, in the Province of Reggio Calabria,\\"Il parco delle Serre\\" by Francesco Bevilacqua southern Italy.  Background  A coalition of the cities Metapontum, Sybaris and Croton had besieged and captured Siris. According to Justin Croton attacked Locri afterwards because the latter had sent aid to Siris when it was under siege. It has been suggested that Justin was wrong and that strained relations between Locri and Caulonia were the cause instead. Because the foundation of Caulonia was supported by Croton, the conflict between Locri and Croton developed. An explanation which incorporates both possibilities is that Locri attacked Caulonia while Croton was occupied with the siege of Siris.  Battle  The date of the battle is uncertain and proposals for it vary widely, ranging from the end of the seventh century BC to after 510 BC. Peter Bicknell proposes a more specific date of either 580 or 576 BC, but most scholars date the battle to the middle of the sixth century BC. Some have considered the inscriptions on a bronze trophy from Olympia to be related to the battle. The inscription reads: \\"the citizens of Hipponium and Medma and Locri dedicated [this] as booty from the Crotoniates\\". Bicknell thinks this inscription refers to a later conflict because Hipponium was acquired by Locri fairly late. He suggests a date of 500‚Äì480 BC for the trophy because Locri took Temesa from Croton around this time. In advance of the battle Locri requested help from Sparta, but the Spartans replied that they should seek help from the Dioscuri, who according to legend helped them defeat Croton. According to Strabo the city Rhegion was allied with Locri and sent a contingent to their aid. He gives 10,000 men as the size of their army, but it is not clear if this includes or excludes the Rhegians. He provides a number of 130,000 for the army of Croton. Justin mentions a number of 15,000 Locrians versus 120,000 Crotoniates. Because Justin makes no mention of the Rhegians it is thought that they numbered 5,000 based on Strabo's numbers. The very large size of the Crotoniate army must have been a severe exaggeration. Justin and Strabo claim the news of the battle reached the Peloponnese in a single day.  Aftermath  In Justin's account Pythagoras arrived in Croton after the battle and instituted an austere regime. Strabo attributes the decline of Croton to the heavy casualties it suffered during the battle. For Locri it was instead the start of a more and more aggressive policy towards neighbouring cities, subsequently leading to a rupture in its alliance with Rhegion. There is evidence that a cult to the Dioscuri was present in Locri in the beginning of the fifth century BC, which probably began as a result of the battle.

Retrieved 29 July 2020 They are linked to the Christian Concern campaigning organisation. Notable cases Since its inception, the CLC has provided legal support in a number of high-profile cases in the UK. Notable examples include: * Emily Mapfuwa, a Christian who launched a private prosecution against the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead for exhibiting a statue by Terence Koh depicting Jesus with an erection. In a BBC Essex radio interview, Michael Phillips (a solicitor working for CLC who is also a member of The Lawyers Christian Fellowship) admitted that Ms Mapfuwa had never actually visited the exhibition. In fact she lives over away in Brentwood, Essex. The case was eventually discontinued by the Crown Prosecution Service. * Eunice and Owen Johns, a Christian couple who applied to become foster parents with Derby City Council. They withdrew their application after a social worker expressed concerns when they said they could not tell a child a homosexual lifestyle was acceptable. The two parties jointly agreed to take the case to the High Court, for clarification of the law, but the court sided with the city council; stating that laws protecting people from discrimination, because of their sexual orientation, \\"should take precedence\\" over the right not to be discriminated against on religious grounds. * Hybrid embryo research: The CLC and Comment on Reproductive Ethics (CORE) were refused permission to apply for a judicial review to overturn the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority's decision to allow laboratory testing of hybrid embryos. Mrs Justice Dobbs at the High Court in London ruled that the application was \\"totally without merit\\", and ordered the CLC to pay costs amounting to some ¬£20,000. * Gary McFarlane, a counsellor for Relate (a relationship support charity) who was sacked after raising a possible conscionable objection to assisting same-sex couples with sexual issues. The charity admitted to a charge of wrongful dismissal, conceding that he should have been served notice instead of being fired immediately for 'gross misconduct'. Further claims of unfair dismissal and discrimination on the grounds of religion were dismissed. His appeal against this ruling was dismissed by the High Court in April 2010. A subsequent appeal to the European Court of Human Rights also ended in failure. * Graham Cogman, a police constable from Norfolk who was sacked for sending emails to colleagues in which he quoted Bible passages condemning homosexuality and forwarded details of a group that offered to \\"cure\\" homosexuals. * Shirley Chaplin, a nurse who was supported by the CLC in an unsuccessful bid to sue the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust for discrimination because it had moved her to a desk job after she refused to remove a crucifix on a chain when asked to do so on health and safety grounds (hospital dress code prohibits front-line staff from wearing any type of necklace in case patients try to grab them). The hospital had offered Chaplin a compromise of wearing her cross pinned inside a lapel or pocket. An employment tribunal ruled they acted reasonably in April 2010, rejecting Chaplin's case. On 28 March 2010, six current and former Anglican bishops; Lord Carey of Clifton, Michael Scott-Joynt, Michael Nazir-Ali, Peter Forster, Anthony Priddis and Nicholas Reade ‚Äî cited the case in an open letter to the Sunday Telegraph newspaper in which they claimed to be \\"deeply concerned at the apparent discrimination shown against Christians\\". Ms Chaplin eventually tried unsuccessfully to obtain a ruling against the UK government at the European Court of Human Rights. * Duke Amachree, a homelessness officer who was sacked by Wandsworth Council for subjecting a client to a \\"30-minute barrage\\" of evangelism when he was simply supposed to be offering her housing advice. The client complained to the Council, leading to an investigation. The Council complained that Amachree revealed \\"sensitive personal information\\" about the client to the media, namely an interview with The Daily Mail after the CLC had become involved. The CLC supported Mr Amachree in an unsuccessful legal claim for unfair dismissal, religious discrimination and breach of contract. An appeal is being considered.To date (9 years after the tribunal ruling) no appeal has been lodged. * Victoria Wasteney, a senior occupational therapist, head of forensic therapy at the John Howard Centre, a mental health unit of the East London NHS Foundation Trust who was suspended for \\"harassing and bullying\\" a junior Muslim colleague. The Centre supported an appeal to the Employment Appeal Tribunal, where Her Honour Judge Eady QC found that Wasteney's treatment was not because of her beliefs, but because of her inappropriate behaviour and that it had nothing to do with her freedom to manifest her religious belief. * Jeff and Sue Green, a couple who were accused of discriminating against same-sex couples by operating a ‚Äòmarried couples only‚Äô policy for their double rooms at their guesthouse in Wales. Following an anonymous complaint in 2013 that the guesthouse discriminated against gay couples, the UK Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) warned the Greens that their website could be construed as ‚Äúpotentially discriminatory‚Äù and as such unlawful. The Greens changed their policy to offer only single beds in all rooms and the EHRC dropped the case. Supported by the CLC, in 2014 they sought a hearing at the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) in Strasbourg because they feared that ‚Äúrecent UK equality legislation seems to be being used to undermine Christian faith and values‚Äù. The ECHR refused to consider their request. * Alfie Evans case: the CLC became involved in the latter stages of this case. Their involvement was unsuccessful and was criticised by the judge.

The movement was most active in Swedish speaking Ostrobothnia, but it attracted people also in the south of Finland. The leader of the movement was the young girl Maria √Ökerblom from the village of Snappertuna in Uusimaa. The sect has its roots in Snappertuna in 1917, when it is said that twelve-year-old Maria √Ökerblom received prophesies from God. √Ökerblom was struck by sickness and as she fell asleep, she started to preach. She delivered her speeches in trance as a so- called \\"sleeping preacher\\". This happened several times, and √Ökerblom became famous. Services with √Ökerblom preaching became more and more popular and her reputation spread throughout Finland. She started to travel around in Finland preaching. √Ökerblom's sermons attracted most people in the northern parts of Ostrobothnia, especially in the Kokkola-region and the village of Teerij√§rvi. In the beginning no problems occurred as the movement started spreading in the region. Later, though, the members of the movement were accused of several different crimes, for instance shooting a policeman, stealing and physical violence. The movement grew larger in the early 1920s, in spite of all the accusations made against it. The leaders of the movement decided that all the members should sell all their belongings and give it to the sect. The movement's aim was to move to the holy land of Israel. The √Ökerblom Movement did not make it that far, though. In the 1920s it fell apart because of all the accusations and trials it went through. Some members remained close to Maria √Ökerblom, but the vast majority returned to normal life.

He was also associated with the Skagen Painters. He was the first head of Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler, an art school established in the 1880s to provide an alternative to the education offered by the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts. Biography P. S. Kr√∏yer Lauritz Regner Tuxen grew up in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was the son of Nicolai Elias Tuxen (1810-1891) and Bertha Laura Gi√∏dvad (1815-1908). His father was a naval officer and director of the Danish naval shipyard (Orlogsv√¶rftet). The still life-and flowerpainter Nicoline Tuxen (1847-1931) was his older sister. From 1868-1872, he studied at the Royal Danish Academy of Art together with Peder Severin Kr√∏yer (1851‚Äì1909). He studied in the Paris studio of L√©on Bonnat during 1875-1876 and again from 1877-1878. Tuxen, Lauritz Regner Dansk biografisk Lexikon. Retrieved 15 December 2008. He first visited Skagen in 1870, returning on several occasions. In the 1880s and 1890s, he travelled widely painting portraits for Europe's royal families including Christian IX of Denmark, Queen Victoria and the Russian royalty. \\"Laurits Tuxen\\", Skagens Museum. Retrieved 25 October 2013 (text had changed slightly by 3 February 2017). Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler was founded in Copenhagen during 1882, at the initiative of a group of dissatisfied students from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts and as a reaction to the outdated teachings at the Academy. Laurits Tuxen became the school's first director and Peder Severin Kr√∏yer one of its teachers. In 1914 he made a study trip to Greece to paint the entry of George I of Greece into Salonika, for the Christian castle. He made lively and well-characterized portraits, among them his self-portrait in the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, and portraits of P. S. Kr√∏yer, in the Museum of Fine Arts in Budapest. He also made portraits in sculpture, including a portrait group of Kr√∏yer and Michael Ancher. Tuxen went on to paint a number of landscapes in and around Skagen, but also completed a number of paintings of his family, friends and garden flowers. Portrait of Peder Severin Kr√∏yer by Laurits Tuxen Personal life He was married in 1886 to Charlotte Pauline Ursule de Baisieux (1862-1899). In 1901, after the death of his first wife, he married Frederikke Kos Treschow (1856-1946). He subsequently purchased Madam Bendsen's house in Skagen in the north of Jutland, converting it into a stately summer residence. He died in 1927 at Copenhagen. Exhibitions Tuxen painted mainly landscapes in Skagen, but also portraits of European royal personalities, namely Christian IX of Denmark, Queen Victoria, Czar Nicolas II, etc. Some of his works are exhibited at: *The Hermitage in St. Petersburg. *The Royal Collection of England. *Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen. *Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. *Skagens Museum in Skagen, Denmark.

Both were written in 1915; The Man-Eater, a jungle adventure, was first published as a serial in the New York Evening World newspaper from November 15‚Äì20, 1915, while Beyond Thirty, a science fiction story, was first published in All Around Magazine in February 1916. Neither work appeared in book form in Burroughs' lifetime. The first book versions were limited editions were issued by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach's Fantasy Press fanzine in 1955; the two works were then published in a combined edition under the present title by Science-Fiction & Fantasy Publications in 1957, through which they first reached a wide readership. Both works have since been published separately. Contents *Beyond Thirty *The Man-Eater Plot summary =Beyond Thirty= The story was heavily influenced by the events of World War I, and reflects U.S. sentiments at the time of writing. When the war broke out, Americans were predominantly isolationist and wary of being drawn into a European war. Burroughs imagines a future two centuries onward in which that view prevailed and the western hemisphere severed contact with the rest of the world. Consequently, the eastern hemisphere has exhausted itself in war and Europe descended into barbarism while the Americas, sheltered from the destruction, have continued to advance and joined peacefully into the union of Pan-America. By the twenty-second century the entire world east of the 30th meridian west and west of the 175th meridian east has become terra incognita to Pan-America. In 2137, Pan-American Navy Lieutenant Jefferson Turck is commander of the aero-submarine Coldwater, tasked with patrolling the 30th meridian from Iceland to the Azores. Disaster strikes when the vessel's anti- gravitation screens fail, dooming it to wallow upon the surface of the ocean, and the engines fail, leaving it adrift. As its wireless radio has failed as well, Turck cannot even summon help. It is implied that the perfidy of the Coldwater‚Äôs second officer is behind its misfortunes, as well as the abandonment at sea of Turck and three crewmen in a small boat while attempting repairs. Adrift, Turck and his companions are forced to make shore in forbidden England. Turck falls into the hands of raiders from the Abyssinian Empire, a black super-state ruling all of Africa, most of Europe, and the Arabian peninsula. While the Abyssinians' technology is roughly equivalent to that of the nineteenth century, the white savages that populate Europe in Turck‚Äôs time are no match for them. The Abyssinians consider whites a lower order and take them as slaves. Turck too is pressed into slavery. Becoming the personal servant of an Abyssinian colonel he is treated better than many of his fellow slaves, but is rankled by his status. Turck's master takes him to the court of the Abyssinian Emperor, Menelek XIV. Menelek is portrayed as gross and cruel, perhaps once a great man, but now corrupted by power. Turck watches powerless as white slave women are offered to the emperor for his harem, including the heroine Victory, queen of the primitives of England. Eventually Turck succeeds in rescuing Victory and makes his way with her to the rival empire of China. Communications between the hemispheres are re- opened, with commerce to follow, and Turck, despite violating the edict against crossing the 30th meridian, is hailed as a hero in Pan-America. =The Man-Eater= Jefferson Scott, Jr. and Robert Gordon, hunters in the Belgian Congo, are thrown together with missionaries Sangamon and Mary Morton and their daughter Ruth. Scott marries Ruth, and Gordon is entrusted with stock certificates to be taken back to Scott's father in America. Later Scott and the elder Mortons are killed by the native Wakandas; Ruth and her daughter Virginia are saved by Belgian forces and afterwards return to America to live with Scott's father. The stock certificates, meanwhile, have gone astray, with only a single sheet of paper having been delivered to the elder Scott. Nineteen years pass. On the death of Jefferson Scott, Sr., Virginia Scott is to inherit the estate, but the will cannot be located, and Scott Taylor, her grandfather‚Äôs disinherited nephew, appears to claim a half share. Proposing to Virginia in an effort to obtain it all, he is rebuffed, whereupon he disputes her right to any of the estate, pretending she is illegitimate. Ruth attempts to prove her marriage to Virginia's father by writing to Robert Gordon, who witnessed the ceremony, but he is now deceased. Her appeal reaches his son Dick Gordon instead. Moved but unable to provide the desired proof, Gordon writes back of his intention to sail to Africa to seek documentation of the marriage there. Taylor intercepts the letter and follows him with the intention of murder. Discovering this, Virginia also sets out for Africa. Gordon reaches the ruins of the old mission and finds there a sealed envelope, with which he begins his trek back to the coast. Taylor and his confederates Kelley and Gootch await him in ambush in a native village. They kill a lioness, whose mate the natives take captive in a pit trap. Virginia arrives at the village and is imprisoned by the villains. Meanwhile, Gordon discovers and frees the captured lion, which then returns to the village seeking the killers of its mate. The lion arrives just as the villains are about to rape and kill Virginia, and kills Gootch while others flee. Virginia escapes but is stalked by a hyena. Gordon, who happens to be nearby, hears her scream and shoots the beast. She warns him against Taylor, who then appears with Kelley, seeking her. Seizing Gordon‚Äôs gun, she wounds Taylor and drives the villains off. They return to America and separate, Gordon somehow neglecting to give her the envelope. Meanwhile, the lion has been captured by hunters and sold to an itinerant American circus, in which he is billed as \\"Ben, King of Beasts, the Man-Eating Lion.\\" Realizing his omission, Gordon visits the Scott home to deliver the envelope to Virginia and Ruth, unaware that Taylor and Kelley have returned from Africa and still plan to kill him. He finds the Scotts absent from home, their return delayed by a train wreck. Ben, who was also on the train, is freed by the wreck and turns up at the house, where he detects the scents of both his rescuer Gordon and the two villains. Encountering the latter, he kills Kelley and pursues Taylor to Gordons room. There Taylor struggles with Gordon and overcomes him, taking the envelope before fleeing from Ben. The lion follows, overtaking and killing Taylor within sight of the returning Scott's. Gordon, pursuing Taylor, recognizes Ben and protects him from the armed party that arrives to kill the escaped lion. He buys Ben from the circus, intending to give him a new home in a zoo. The mysterious envelope, finally opened, proves to contain the long lost stocks, not the hoped for marriage certificate. The latter turns up, together with the missing will, in a cupboard in the Scott house, having been secreted there by Jefferson Scott, Sr. The certificate was evidently the paper Gordon's father had delivered to the elder Scott instead of the stocks. Dick Gordon and Virginia Scott declare their love for each other and decide to marry.

Many Greek Muslims of Lebanon somewhat managed to preserve their identity and language. Until the Lebanese Civil War, their community was close-knit and entirely endogamous. However many of them left Lebanon during the 15 years of the war. By 1988, many Greek Muslims from both Lebanon and Syria had reported being subject to discrimination by the Greek embassy because of their religious affiliation.

The current hospital is an out-patient centre which opened on 25 May 2007 in a ceremony conducted by Tony Blair as part of his farewell tour before resigning as Prime Minister. History The old Corbett Hospital in 2007 before it was demolished =The Old Hospital= The old hospital had its origins in a seven-bedroom mansion was known as The Hill, the home of George Mills, a glass manufacturer who was a partner in the Albert Glass House situated in Wordsley. He committed suicide on 13 November 1885 after several years of mental illness. He left debts of ¬£11,344-12s-6d, and even though the house was in a poor state of repair it was eventually sold to pay of the liabilities. John Corbett, who spent his youth living at the Delph, made his fortune producing salt at Stoke Prior, Worcestershire and, perhaps remembering his youth, purchased the rather rundown house in December 1891. He repaired and refurbished the house, changing its use into a hospital, and endowed it to the local people on 31 July 1893, with a sum of ¬£2,000 for endowment. The Corbett Hospital Preliminary Training School was opened in 1948 on the formation of the National Health Service, providing accommodation for 12 medical students. =Accident and emergency unit= An accident and emergency unit was opened in 1964, but closed 20 years later following the opening of a new unit at Russells Hall Hospital. As recently as the late 1990s, there was widespread local campaigning for the return of accident and emergency facilities at the Corbett, on the grounds that such a facility there would have reduced the waiting time for people around Stourbridge needing the service. The original Corbett Hospital closed in 2005 after 112 years in use. The new building is situated within the grounds of the original one, which was demolished in late 2007.

History  The first generation of gyrocompass was based on fast- spinning discs and was requiring complex mechanics such as gimbals of fluid suspended platform. The first practical apparatus were installed onboard vessels at the beginning of the 20th century. The fibre optic gyrocompass is the first strapdown gyrocompass. The sensors are simply strapped to the chassis of the gyrocompass, this avoids the need for complex mechanics. The first fibre optic gyrocompass appeared on the market at the end of the 20th century but did not really supersede the original mechanical gyrocompass which remained the dominant technology on the market.

Life and career Michael Loewe was born on 2 November 1922 in Oxford, England, to a distinguished Anglo-Jewish family. Loewe's great-grandfather Louis Loewe (1809-1888) was a Prussian Silesian professor of Oriental studies and theology who later emigrated to Britain, and was the personal secretary of the prominent British Jewish businessman, financier, and philanthropist Moses Montefiore. Loewe's father, Herbert Loewe, was a professor of the Semitic languages who taught at both Cambridge University and Oxford University, while his mother, Ethel Victoria Hyamson, was a sister of the British official and historian Albert Hyamson. His elder brother Raphael Loewe (1919-2011) was, like their father, a scholar of Semitic languages, and was a professor of Hebrew and Jewish studies at University College London. Loewe was married to Carmen Blacker, a scholar in the Japanese language. Loewe attended secondary school at The Perse School in Cambridge, then entered university at Magdalen College, Oxford. Due to the Second World War, Loewe left Oxford in 1942 to train as a Japanese specialist officer in the Government Communications Headquarters, while studying Mandarin Chinese in his spare time.Three Questions to Michael Loewe During a six-month stay in Beijing in 1947, Loewe became interested in traditional and historical Chinese topics, which he began studying at the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London after returning to Britain. He received a first class honours degree in 1951, and in 1956 he left the government to serve as a Lecturer in the History of the Far East at the University of London. SOAS awarded him a PhD in 1963, and he subsequently joined the faculty at Cambridge, where he taught until retiring in 1990 to focus solely on research and scholarship.

The cyanido radical was one of the first detected molecules in the interstellar medium. Its detection and analysis was influential in astrochemistry. The first discovery was performed with a coud√© spectrograph, which was made famous and credible due to this detection. ¬∑CN has been observed in both diffuse clouds and dense clouds. Usually, CN is detected in regions with hydrogen cyanide, hydrogen isocyanide, and HCHN+, since it is involved in the creation and destruction of these species. Physical Properties Bonding in the cyano radical can be described as a combination of two resonance structures: the structure with the unpaired electron on the carbon is the minor contributor, while the structure with the unpaired electron on the nitrogen (the isocyano radical) is the major contributor. The charge separation in the isocyano radical is similar to that of carbon monoxide. ¬∑CN has a dipole moment of 1.45 Debye and a 2Œ£+ ground electronic state. The selection rules are: :N + S = J :J + I = F Where N is the angular momentum, S is the electric spin, and I = 1 is the nuclear spin of 14N.

McKellar In the interstellar medium. The coude spectrograph and a telescope were used to observe ¬∑CN's interstellar lines and ultraviolet spectra. Use of the spectrograph proved McKellar's findings to be correct and also made the spectrograph famous. In 1970, ¬∑CN's first rotational transition from J=0 to J=1 was detected In the Orion Nebula and W51. The first detection of ¬∑CN in extragalactic sources were seen toward Sculptor Galaxy (NGC 253), IC 342, and M82 In 1988. These emission lines seen were from N=1 to N=0 and N=2 to N=1. In 1991, the ¬∑CN vibration-rotational bands were observed in a king furnace at the National Solar Observatory using a McMath Fourier-Transform spectrometer. The observed 2 to 0 lines show an extreme hyperfine structure. In 1995, the rotational absorption spectrum of ¬∑CN in the ground state was observed in the 1 THz region, and most of the lines were measured in the range of 560 to 1020 GHz. Four new rotational transitions were measured; N=8 to N=8, J=15/2 to J=17/2 and J=17/2 to J=19/2; N=7 to N=8, J=15/2 to J=17/2 and J=13/2 to J=15/2.

The parish is about south of Callington and is in the St Germans Registration District. To the north, the parish is bordered by Callington and St Dominick parishes, to the east and south by Pillaton parish, and to the west by St Ive parish. The population in the 2001 Census was 377. The 2011 Census recorded that this had increased to 383. The parish name is taken from St Melaine, a 6th-century bishop of Rennes, Brittany. Parish church The Church of England parish church of St Melanus is in the village of St Mellion (the largest settlement in the parish) at . The older part of the church is the south side which was built in the 14th century whereas the north side is of the late 15th century and was built of granite. There is a series of monuments to the Corytons: these include a brass to Peter Coryton and his wife and 24 children, 1552, and two elaborate sculptural compositions to William Coryton, 1651, and Sir William, 1711, both in a style characteristic of the early 17th century. Notable sites St Mellion is also the location of Pentillie, a 17th-century castle and estate which has been the seat of the Coryton family since 1698. They had previously had an estate at West Newton Ferrers, also in St Mellion. The manor of Newton Ferrers (Niuuetona, Niweton, Niwetone) is recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086. Part of the manor was held by Reginald from Robert, Count of Mortain. There was half a hide of land and land for six ploughs. There were two ploughs, three serfs, three villeins, 12 smallholders, 12 acres of pasture, five cattle, 40 sheep and 10 goats. The value of this part was ¬£1 though it had formerly been worth ¬£1 10s. The other part of the manor was also held by Reginald from Robert, Count of Mortain. There was one hide of land and land for eight ploughs. There were 10 villeins and 20 smallholders with one plough, three serfs, half a league of pasture, woodland two leagues long and one furlong wide. The value of this part was ¬£1 10s. though it had formerly been worth ¬£2. The present house was built about 1686‚Äì95 (these dates being on the gatepiers) for Sir William Coryton. It is a plain granite mansion of two storeys: the centre is of seven bays and there are two projecting wings of two bays each. It is the earliest Cornish mansion in the classical style (i.e. with no Tudor survivals). Two thirds of the house were gutted by fire in 1940; of this some has been rebuilt while the rest remains as a ruin. The St Mellion golf course is also in the parish.

Description Turnaround video of specimen RMNH 110079, Naturalis Biodiversity Center The bird was similar to the Hispaniolan parakeet, and prior its extinction, it was for a time considered a subspecies. Its feathers were a duller green, and the red markings on the wing were more extensive.  Ecology  The bird fed primarily upon seeds, fruits, nuts and berries. It may also have eaten leaf buds and flowers. Nesting took place in hollow trees, old woodpecker holes and arboreal termite nests.  Behaviour  The Puerto Rican parakeet was a very gregarious bird, noted for its loud, continuous calling. While the bird was normally cautious, avoiding contact with humans, this lessened while feeding. As the bird often fed in farmers' field upon crops such as maize, this contributed to its widespread hunting.  Extinction  The last bird was seen in 1882, by W. W. Brown, who collected the specimen which now resides at the Field Museum in Chicago. The date of extinction is not well recorded. It was referred to as still being extant in 1905, but reported as extinct in 1950. Hunting by humans is believed to be the primary cause of extinction. It was noted by James Bond that the bird was seemingly unafraid of gunshots, making it particularly vulnerable to hunting. Bond attributed the bird's extinction to the large number of pigeon hunters who travelled to Mona Island. Deforestation of the island may also have played a role. Three specimens of the bird still exist. Beyond the one in the Field Museum, the Nationaal Natuurhistorisch Museum in Leiden and the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle in Paris each possess one skin. Although it is believed the species may also have existed on Puerto Rico, all the existing specimens were collected from Mona Island. The specimen in the Mus√©um National d'Histoire Naturelle is the type specimen.

In this animation, the on cells are white and the dying cells are blue. Brian's Brain is a cellular automaton devised by Brian Silverman, which is very similar to his Seeds rule. Rules Brian's Brain consists of an infinite two-dimensional grid of cells, but unlike Seeds, each cell may be in one of three states: on, dying, or off. Each cell is considered to have eight neighbors (the Moore neighborhood), as in Seeds and Conway's Game of Life. In each time step, a cell turns on if it was off but had exactly two neighbors that were on, just like the birth rule for Seeds. All cells that were \\"on\\" go into the \\"dying\\" state, which is not counted as an \\"on\\" cell in the neighbor count, and prevents any cell from being born there. Cells that were in the dying state go into the off state. Behavior Because of the cellular automaton's name, some websites compare the automaton to a brain and each of its cells to a neuron, which can be in three different states: ready (off), firing (on), and refractory (dying). oscillator in Brian's Brain. The \\"dying state\\" cells tend to lead to directional movement, so almost every pattern in Brian's Brain is a spaceship. Many spaceships are rakes, which emit other spaceships. Another result is that many Brian's Brain patterns will explode messily and chaotically, and often will result in or contain great diagonal waves of on and dying cells. For example, a 2√ó2 block of on cells will result in an ever-expanding diamond consisting of four diagonal waves that move across the plane at the pattern's speed of light. Nevertheless, oscillators have been constructed in Brian's Brain. An example has just four on cells and four dying cells, and oscillates with period 3.

He was a member of the world-famous Borodin Quartet in 1945 and was a member until 2007. He was the only Quartet member to have played in it from the beginning. Berlinsky played for the Borodin Quartet for 60 years, making him the longest-serving member of what The New York Times described as being \\"by all accounts the longest continuously playing\\" string quartet in the world. The group originally came together in 1945 as the Moscow Conservatoire Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich on cello, Rostislav Dubinsky and Nina Barshai on first and second violins and Rudolf Barshai on viola, all members of a class taken by Mikhail Terian, the viola player of the Comitas Quartet. However, after a couple of weeks Rostropovich found he was too busy and nominated Berlinsky in his place. They signed an oath of allegiance in their own blood which Berlinsky retained. He also maintained a complete log of their many performances. The quartet first met Dmitri Shostakovich in 1946 and became his interpreter. The group was known for its performances of all 15 quartets in the Shostakovich quartet cycle at concert halls around the world, including in 1994 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. The quartet was one of the Soviet Union's best known in the West during the Cold War era, through concert performances in the United States and Europe and through distribution of their recordings. As one of the most revered groups during the Communist era, the quartet performed at the funerals of both Joseph Stalin and Sergei Prokofiev, who both died on March 5, 1953.Dubinsky, Rostislav. \\"THE NIGHT STALIN DIED\\", The New York Times, March 5, 1989. Accessed December 25, 2008. After 20 years with the same line-up difficult times followed in the 1970s: Dubinsky emigrated to the West in 1976 and the second violinist, Jaroslav Alexandrov, retired through ill-health. Having recruited replacements, Berlinsky insisted that the ensemble spend two years out of sight until the Borodin sound had been fully recreated. Berlinsky was a very loyal Russian. In 2000 he said: \\"I have never condemned those who left. It's difficult to describe in words why I stayed, but for me it was nothing to do with cheap patriotism. It was just that Russia is my fatherland; I couldn't imagine living anywhere else.\\" For much of his life he taught at the Gnessin School of Music in Moscow, nurturing many talented young players. Berlinsky was born in Irkutsk, Siberia, on January 19, 1925. He took violin lessons from his father, who had been a pupil of Leopold Auer and who, with his three brothers, played as the Berlinsky Quartet in that part of the Soviet Union. He was soon sent to Moscow to study at the Moscow Conservatory.Fox, Margalit. \\"Valentin Berlinsky, Mainstay Cellist of the Borodin Quartet, Dies at 83 \\", The New York Times, December 25, 2008.

Wall was born in East Finchley. He suffered from glaucoma from an early age, which caused him to go completely blind by the age of eight. After his blindness took hold, he moved from a mainstream school to Chorleywood School for the Blind. He moved to Worcester College for the Blind (now New College Worcester) in 1940. Despite only being 14, two years younger than usual, he took his School Certificate in 1944, achieving the highest score in his class. After further strong academic performance in his Higher School Certificate, he was accepted into Balliol College, Oxford where he read jurisprudence and graduated in 1951. He also played chess at school and university. His blindness presented him with difficulties in finding a job; he made over 400 job applications after graduating and was invited to 53 interviews before he was offered a job as an articled clerk at Wilkins, Rowan and Newman, a small law firm of solicitors in Chelsea. He qualified as a solicitor in 1954, and in 1956 he began working as a legal adviser for the National Association of Local Government Officers (now part of Unison). Around this time he attempted to become a judge, but his application was rejected due to the potential difficulties his blindness could cause (as he would be unable to read court documents or study witnesses, for example) and because it was felt appointing a blind judge would not leave the public confident he could perform his duties. After 18 years as a legal adviser with NALGO, he joined the law firm Middleton Lewis in 1974 as a partner specialising in litigation, staying on when the firm merged with Lawrence Graham in 1977.

Cookhouse is situated in Greater Addo, in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Cookhouse was an early colonial settlement. The Scottish abolitionist and poet, Thomas Pringle mentions Cookhouse in his journal. The town was also visited by early explorers and writers such as Dutch military commander Robert Jacob Gordon and French traveller Fran√ßois Levaillant. Gordon's stay in South Africa produced scientific writings, drawings and maps about the region. The town is home to the Cookhouse Wind Farm which comprises 66 turbines. The farm became operational in November 2014 and supplies clean energy to Cookhouse, Adelaide, Somerset East and Bedford. History The Great Fish River formed the eastern boundary of the Cape Colony until 1819. The current village is said to take its name from a small stone house used for shelter and cooking by troops camping on the bank of this river. Another explanation links the name to the hot climate as experienced by the troops stationed there. The Cookhouse is located on what was the Roodewal farm owned by Frans Johannes van Aardt in the 1770s. He was born on 12 September 1777 in Somerset East and died in 1856. Frans Johannes van Aardt was married twice; first to Susanna Wilhelmina Tregardt on 21 October 1798. She died in 1825 aged 27. This small town got its name is in the late 1790s because Susanna van Aardt supplied provisions from her \\"cookhouse\\" (or outdoor kitchen) to riders and soldiers waiting to cross the Great Fish River. After her death, Frans Johannes married Maria Johanna Mentz in 1826. In the 1870s, the government of Prime Minister John Molteno oversaw a massive expansion of the Cape Colony's railway system, and a route northwards to De Aar from Port Elizabeth and Port Alfred was chosen by the Cape Government Railways to pass through what is now Cookhouse. A station was built here, which became an important railway junction, and a small settlement formed around this connection. This railway station in Cookhouse is an attraction was written about in Cookhouse Station, a poem by Chris Mann that describes how he imagines the railway station was at its peak. Monuments and museums *Cookhouse is home to the Slachter's Nek monument, commemorating the hanging of the five rebels of the Slachter's Nek Rebellion who were sentenced by the British to be hanged in public. The monument was erected in 1916, 100 years after the execution. *Cookhouse is home to Thomas Pringle's Cairn, a memorial built to commemorate his passage through the town. *The Fallen Heroes Memorial was unveiled in 2007 to commemorate Cookhouse residents who lost their lives in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa. *The Fairworld Fine Wool Museum is also located in Cookhouse and it shows the history of farming and wool production in the town. Willen van Aardt established the museum to tell the story of Fine Wool breeding on the farm as well as the history of the van Aardt family who have produced wool on the farm since 1797.

When a person reaches an important age in his or her life, Koreans have unique celebrations to mark these milestones. Dol means it has been 365 days since the baby's birth.  Dol (Îèå) Dol ceremony Dol (doljanchi, or tol) is probably one of the best-known of the Korean birthday celebrations. Dol is celebrated for the first year of a child. When Korea had little medicinal knowledge, many newborns would die from childhood diseases or because of Korea's seasonal temperature differences. When a child lived to be a year old during that period, it was a very joyous occasion.Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil The first part of the dol celebration is prayer. Traditionally, Koreans would pray to two of the many Korean gods: Sanshin (the mountain god) and Samshin (the birth goddess). Koreans would prepare the praying table with specific foods: a bowl of steamed white rice, seaweed soup (miyeok-guk) and a bowl of pure water. Layered red bean rice cakes (samshin siru) were placed next to the prayer table. The rice cakes were not shared outside the family; it was believed that sharing this particular item with people outside the family would bring bad luck to the child. After everything on the praying table was ready the mother (or grandmother) of the child would pray to Sanshin and Samshin, placing her hands together and rubbing her palms. She would ask for her child's longevity, wish luck to the mountain god, and give thanks to the birth goddess. After she finished her prayer, she bowed to Samshin several times. Women were the only ones allowed to participate in this ceremony; men were forbidden to be part of the praying. When the praying ceremony commenced depended on the region. People from Seoul would pray in the early morning of the child's birthday; other regions prayed the night before. Today this part of the celebrations is usually skipped, because Muism (the religion that worshiped the Korean gods) is rarely practiced.Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil Before the main part of the celebration, the baby is dressed in very colorful, ornate clothing called dol-bok. The dol-bok that the child wears differs according to the child's sex. A boy would traditionally wear a pink or striped jogori (jacket) with purple or gray paji (pants), a striped durumagi (long jacket), a blue vest printed with a gold or silver pattern or a striped magoja (jacket), a jonbok (long blue vest) with a gold or silver pattern, a bokgun (black hat with long tail), and tarae-busun (traditional socks). A girl would wear a striped jogori, a long red chima (skirt), a gold-and-silver printed jobawi (hat) and tarae-busun. In addition to their dol-bok, boys and girls would wear a long dol-ddi (belt that wraps around the body twice) for longevity and a dol-jumuni (pouch) for luck. The dol-jumuni would be made of fine silk, with a thread to open and close it. Buttons were not used in the dol-bok, to symbolize longevity.Child's first birthday (tol). Retrieved 10/05, 2008, from http://www.lifeinkorea.com/culture/tol/tol.cfm#baekil The Toljabee is the main celebration of Tol. A large table is prepared with over a dozen different types of rice cakes or ddeok (the main food). Some types of ddeok are paekseolgi (white steamed rice cakes), susu-kyongdan (rice cakes coated with rough red bean powder), mujigae-ddeok (rainbow-colored steamed rice cakes) and gyep'i-ddeok (puffed-air rice cakes). Along with the deeok, fruit is also served; the fruit on the table varies, depending on the season. There is also a bowl of rice and various other foods placed on the table. Food is not the only thing on the table, however; there is also a large spool of thread, a brush, a Korean calligraphy set, a pencil, a book, money (10,000-won bills) and a bow and arrow (or a needle, ruler and pair of scissors for girls). After the table is set, the parents sit the baby on a traditional Korean mattress (bolou) and Korean cushions (bangsuk). This is done so that relatives can get better pictures of the infant. There is also a traditional screen in the background. The toljiabee then begins. The baby picks up various items on the table that attracts him or her. The items that the child picks up are said to predict the child's future. If the child picks up the thread, the child will have a long life. A child who picks up the pencil, book or calligraphy set is forecast to be a good scholar. A child who picks the rice, rice cakes, or money will become rich; some say that choosing the rice (or a rice cake) means the child is unintelligent, or that they will never be hungry. If the ruler, pair of scissors or needle is chosen, it is said that the child will be dexterous. If the child chooses the knife, they will become a good chef. In the modern era, people often prepare modern objects such as sports equipment, a microphone, a stethoscope or a computer mouse, to symbolize modern talents.Child's first birthday (tol).

The Baekseolgi symbolizes sacredness. By this time, the baby and mother are still recovering from birth, so people were not allowed to see them. However, close family members are met and prayed for the healthy recovery of the baby's mother on this day.Festive Occasions: The Customs in Korea by Yoon Seo-seok  Baek-il (Î∞±Ïùº) Another birthday celebration is Baek- il (100th-day celebration). During this celebration, the family worships Samshin. They make her offerings of rice and soup for having cared for the infant and the mother, and for having helped them live through a difficult period. They give thanks to Samshin and also pray for jae-ak (wealth), longevity, and cho-bok (traditional word for \\"luck\\").Child's first birthday (tol).

This was considered an auspicious year, since when someone turned 60 the sexagenary cycle of the Korean zodiac is complete. Each person is born under one of the twelve zodiac animals. It takes 60 years for the zodiac animal and the element under which one is born to align.\\"Chinese Zodiac.\\" . Retrieved 10/12, 2008, from . Another reason that hwangap is so important is that many years ago (before the advent of modern medicine), it was uncommon for a person to live 60 years. There is a celebration; children honor their parents with a feast and merrymaking. Part of the celebration involves the children of the birthday celebrant; starting with the eldest, they bow and offer wine to their parents. After the children give their respects to their parents, their children show respect to them; again starting with the eldest, in the same way. While these rituals are being carried out, traditional music is played and professional entertainers sing songs, encouraging people to drink. In order to make the recipient of the hwangap feel young, adults and teens dress in children's clothing. They also sing children's songs and dance children's dances.Korean Embassy. (2000).

He would be required to lift a heavy rock as a test of his strength. If he can lift and move the rock, he is considered a man.

History In 1990 plans were drawn up for a new church project to cater for the growing population of the town. At the time it was estimated that a church capable of holding 800 people would be required.Letterkenny's New Church Project. Published in the 1990 edition of The Letterkenny and District Christmas Annual, p.34 The church project was initiated by Bishop Anthony McFeely and opened in 1994. It was the first church in Ireland to be named after the Irish Catholic Martyrs. An old abbey in the parish dates back to the 13th or 14th century. In 2000 it was decided to create a new parish and call it after the abbey. The site of the abbey is visible from the church, and its graveyard, which dates from 1756, is still in use to this day. The parish has a population of 6,500. the parish priests are Fr. Brian Quinn and Fr. Brendan Ward. Maurice Harron carved a stone cross on the church altar,Maurice Harron - Letterkenny and local sculptor Redmond Herrity created a jubilee stone that can be seen on display outside the church. Fourteen new Stations of the Cross were publicly unveiled at the Church of the Irish Martyrs on Ash Wednesday 2020, purchased at auction from St Mary's Convent in Derby and described by Quinn as \\"the most significant piece of artwork to come into the church\\". The stations, consisting of oil and gold leaf on canvas and laid down on eight metal panels, date to the late-19th century. One is inscribed Studio J Lintbout St Croix, Bruges, Belgium. The church's original stations were simple crosses above Donegal Irish, by Hugo Bonner. Then, when the Loreto Convent in Milford shut, the Church of the Irish Martyrs received their stations.

Churches and schools  St Pinnock Church Connon Methodist Church The Church of England parish church of St Pynnochus (Winnoc), is a Grade I listed building but closed for worship in 2017. The parish church lies on the edge of the hamlet of St Pinnock, where there are two Methodist chapels: Connon Chapel and Trevelmond Chapel, located within the parish. The parish has a Church of England Primary School and a Community Hall, both at East Taphouse. The medieval church building was cruciform but the present structure is mainly of the 14th century; it was over-restored in Victorian times. The rectory was attached to the manor of Penvrane before 1226.The Cornish Church Guide. Truro: Blackford; p. 185 The church was reopened on 18 April 1882 following a rebuild of the south chapel which serves as a vestry. The nave roof was restored and seats of pitchpine installed in the nave and aisle. A chapel of All Saints is mentioned in 1437. Bosent Cross is a fine 14th-century cross; the cross in the rectory garden came from Towednack.Cornish Church Guide; p, 185 The church was described on the Heritage at Risk Register as a: > Small parish church.

St Pinnock Viaduct  St Pinnock Viaduct The railway line through the parish was constructed by the Cornwall Railway company.. The line runs between Plymouth and Truro. The railway opened in 1859 and was extended to Falmouth in 1863. The St Pinnock railway Viaduct, was built in 1854-5 by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and heightened in 1882. It consists of seven piers of roughly dressed, coursed slatestone from Westwood quarry. It stands at approximately 60 foot with each pier consisting of eight buttresses with weatherings rising to form five stages with pointed openings piercing the 4 upper stages. Batter of about 1 in 100. In 1882 the piers were heightened with a slightly cruder, tapering, sixth stage and iron girders were used to replace Brunel's timber trestles. The two-track railroad of 1882 and later carried on rivetted plate steel girders with steel guardrails and refuges to the north side. It is considered the tallest viaduct on the railway in Cornwall, at 633 feet in length and 151 feet in height. The line was singled over the viaduct on 24 May 1964 to reduce the load on the structure. Beneath the viaduct is the Trago Mills out-of-town shopping complex.

The two structures were built to serve visitors to the park, and are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The museum was built in 1923 by Imogene Green MacPherson as the center of her private tourist development, and was then known as the Moraine Park Lodge. The National Park Service purchased the property in 1931 and demolished the surrounding cabins in following years. The amphitheater was designed and built in 1935, with the design by the NPS Branch of Plans and Designs and the construction by the Civilian Conservation Corps. The lodge was reworked in 1934-35. Both structures adhere to the National Park Service Rustic design ethic of the time, with stone and log construction. Imogene Green MacPherson first homesteaded the site in Moraine Park in 1903, naming the land \\"Hillcrest\\". In 1905, newly married, she expanded with a lodge, dining hall, stable and some cabins for guests. Paying guest began to arrive in 1910. Mrs. MacPherson continued to operate the resort after the death of her husband in 1919, and was involved in the campaign for the establishment of Rocky Mountain National Park. After her death in 1928, her family continued to run the lodge until its purchase by the Park Service. The amphitheater is built about one hundred feet from the lodge, with seating interspersed with trees. A projection booth and screen once existed, but were removed. An elaborate arrangement of stone gutters and culverts provides drainage. The Moraine Park Lodge adjoins the William Allen White Cabins historic district. The museum features interactive natural history exhibits, with themes including geologic processes, glaciation, weather and climate, ecosystems, and human impact. The park offers environmental education programs based on similar themes. The lodge building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 1976. The listing was expanded to include the amphitheater on June 15, 2005. Moraine Park meadows The valley of Moraine Park was formed when an ancient glacial lake silted up and drained, forming a flat meadow. The soil is too moist to support most trees but supports grasses, willows, and aspens. The Big Thompson River flows through this valley after coming down glacier- carved Forest Canyon. This habitat area is characterized by ponderosa pine, aspen, and douglas-fir forests, as well as a few large and small meadows. Moraine Park is also a popular place to watch elk, because many elk congregate here for the fall rut.

The content was well received but critics felt the DS was not a suitable platform. Prior to the advent of Kindle, The Guardian newspaper reviewed the game as part of the \\"minority fad\\" of e-readers, declaring it bland and impersonal but good value for money. Eurogamer magazine criticised Nintendo for only using texts that were out of copyright and for not spending the extra for modern classics. It also found the text difficult to read due to the size of the screen, with unhelpful hyphenations, a low word number per page and distracting animations. The Telegraph newspaper agreed that the game offered good value for money but also criticised the size of the screen.

Born on a farm near Russellville, Kentucky, Bailey is best known for the fly shop he established in Livingston, Montana in 1938. Dan Bailey's Fly Shop is still in business. Early life Dan Bailey graduated from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina, in 1926 and earned a master's degree in physics from the University of Kentucky. He was a teacher in Missouri when he became interested in fly fishing. His next job brought him to Lehigh University where he was able to pursue trout fishing in the central Pennsylvania chalkstreams. In 1929 while teaching at the Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute he pursued a Ph.D. in Physics from New York University. While Bailey was in New York, he met and befriended Lee Wulff, another notable fly fisherman. They fished the waters of the Catskills and Adirondacks together and Bailey eventually named a popular series of flies designed by Lee Wulff after him. Bailey learned fly tying while in New York and started teaching classes and selling flies to supplement his income. John McDonald, a noted fly fishing scholar was an early student of Bailey's and became a lifetime friend. In 1936, Bailey married Helen Hesslein, a nurse and acquaintance of one of his fly tying pupils. They honeymooned on an extended camping and fishing trip in Montana and Wyoming accompanied by his friend and fellow fly fisherman, Preston Jennings, noted author of A Book of Trout Flies. It was during this trip that Dan and Helen began making plans to permanently settle in Montana. In the summer of 1938, Bailey abandoned his physics education to move West to settle in Montana. The original plan was to settle in Bozeman, Montana but a minor accident with their car going up the east side of Bozeman Pass just west of Livingston forced them back to that town instead. They decided to stay in Livingston and open their fly tying business there instead. Dan Bailey's Fly Shop Original Dan Bailey's Fly Shop storefront, 1939 Dan Bailey's Fly Shop, Livingston, MT (2008) The original fly shop was established in the old Albermarle Hotel at 103 W Park Street along with a small shooting gallery. The Baileys lived in a back room and the rent was $25 a month. Because there was limited opportunity for local fly business, Dan Bailey's became primarily a mail order fly shop and outfitter for visiting anglers. Dan Bailey produced his first mail order catalog in 1941‚Äîstandard dry flies were $2.50 per dozen. In 1981, the year before Dan's passing, Dan Bailey's Fly Shop was the largest manufacturer of artificial flies in the United States producing over 750,000 flies annually for wholesale and retail customers. The mail order business had over 50,000 subscribers. =The Wall Fish= Dan Bailey's Wall of Fame, circa 1940s A unique aspect of Dan Bailey's Fly Shop was the Wall Fish where anyone who caught a trout of four pounds or more could have the fish outlined on paper with the angler's name, date and place caught. The paper outline would then be hung on the fly shop wall. The first Wall Fish was caught by Gilbert Meloche, a young fly tyer in Dan's shop. The fish was a large Brown trout from Armstrong Spring Creek. By the early 1980s, the wall had over 300 silhouettes of four-pound-plus fish on it. Although the Wall fish practice was stopped when Catch and release fishing came into vogue, the original Wall fish are still present in the shop. Innovative Western Fly Tyer Through his fly shop, mail order business and extensive correspondence and fishing experiences with other fly fisherman including Joe Brooks. Bailey became known as one of the most innovative fly tiers in the West. Using his knowledge of Eastern fly patterns, Bailey adapted these patterns to his experiences on Montana streams into a wide range of new and innovative fly patterns. Some fly patterns credited to Bailey are: * Marabou Muddler‚Äîan evolution of the Muddler Minnow introduced in the 1940s and still one of the most popular trout flies on the market today. * Mossback Nymph‚ÄîAn extremely popular woven stonefly nymph pattern that Bailey introduced in the 1940s. * Bailey Wulffs-Black, Grizzly, Blond and Brown hair wing dry flies named after Lee Wulff. * Red Variant‚ÄîA 1940s quill bodied may fly imitation adapted from eastern quill bodied flies. * Green Drake‚ÄîA 1950s may fly imitation originally tied for West Yellowstone anglers fishing Henry's Fork in Idaho. Conservation efforts Apart from his fly shop, Bailey earned respect and reputation for his efforts to protect and preserve Montana's trout streams. In the 1960s he helped establish the first Montana chapter of Trout Unlimited with fellow fly shop owner, Bud Lilly of West Yellowstone. Bailey ultimately served more than 10 years on the Trout Unlimited board of directors. Bailey is best known for his successful two decades of grassroots opposition to the proposed Allen Spur dam project that would have dammed a major portion of the Paradise Valley and Yellowstone River south of Livingston. In a 1959 issue of the Park Country News, Bailey wrote: > Recreation is one of the largest industries in Park County. Its value is > less tangible than that of other industries which are easily measurable in > terms of payroll or gross return. Several years ago the Fish and Wildlife > Service estimated the value of the upper Yellowstone watershed at twenty- > thousand dollars per mile per year for sport fishing.

The two greatest threats to the fishing > resource of the Yellowstone at present are: 1) The possibility of large > water developments which could mean much more of a detriment than a benefit > to recreation. 2) The possibility of losing access to much of our best > fishing water as fishing pressure increases... Bailey was also a prominent member of the Izaak Walton League, Nature Conservancy, Sierra Club, Wilderness Society, and Federation of Fly Fishers. After Bailey's passing in 1982, then Governor of Montana, Ted Schwinden proclaimed August 14, 1982 Dan Bailey Fishing Day to honor his legacy. > WHEREAS, the Montana Fish and Game Commission with sorrow and regret, > observes the death of Dan Bailey of Livingston, Montana; and > WHEREAS, Dan's remarkable life includes many significant contributions to > the preservation of trout waters, the conservation of trout and the art of > angling; and > WHEREAS, the accomplishments of Dan Bailey were of such magnitude that the > people of Montana can be assured for generations to come that Montana > anglers will have a riffle for their flies, a trout for their efforts and > flowing rivers for their souls; and > WHEREAS, the special relationship between Dan Bailey and the Yellowstone > River ordains that his spirit will forever dwell in its waters, and that the > river will run free as long as anglers share his love and respect for the > river. > Now, Therefore I, Ted Schwinden Governor of the State of Montana, do hereby > proclaim August 14, 1982 as Dan Bailey Fishing Day in the State of Montana > and urge all Montanans on that day to observe the contributions of Dan > Bailey that are now recorded and remembered through sparkling riffles, still > pools and wild trout. > Ted Schwinden, Governor of Montana Attest: Jim Waltermire, Secretary of > State See also * List of American fishers Further reading  Notes American conservationists People from Livingston, Montana 1904 births 1982 deaths American fishers Fly fishing Polytechnic Institute of New York University faculty Date of death missing ","title":"Dan Bailey (conservationist)"},{"id":"20711674","text":"Upper ‚Äì Assam is an administrative division of the state of Assam comprising the undivided Lakhimpur and Sivasagar (previously, Sibsagar) districts, of the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra valley.

History =Medieval= Chutia Kingdom (1187-1673) The Chutia people are an indigenous ethnic group and were among the first to settle in this region about 4000 years ago. The medieval Chutia Kingdom was established by Birpal in 1187 on the bank of the river Brahmaputra. It was a powerful kingdom which had ruled for over 400 years in northeastern Assam and some areas of present-day Arunachal Pradesh, with the capital at Sadiya. The kingdom controlled almost the entire region of present Assam districts of Lakhimpur, Dhemaji, Tinsukia and Dibrugarh as well as parts of Sonitpur, Golaghat, Jorhat and Sibsagar districts. In Arunachal Pradesh, it covered the districts bordering Assam. Ahom Kingdom (1228-1826) Ahom territories until 1522 AD before annexing the Chutia kingdom. The Ahom Kingdom was a kingdom in the Brahmaputra valley in Assam, India that maintained its sovereignty for nearly 600 years and successfully resisted Mughal expansion in North-East India. Established by Sukaphaa, a Tai prince from Mong Mao, it began as a Mong in the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra river. It expanded suddenly under Suhungmung in the 16th century after annexing the Chutia kingdom and parts of Kachari kingdom and therefore became multi-ethnic in character. The kingdom became weaker with the rise of the Moamoria rebellion, and subsequently fell to a succession of Burmese invasions. With the defeat of the Burmese after the First Anglo-Burmese War and the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826, control of the kingdom passed into British (East India Company) hands.  Demographics  The Upper Assam division has a population of 7.56 million (24 percent of Assam's population). More than 80 percent of the people follow Hinduism with Islam as the second largest religion. More than 70 percent of the people speak Assamese with a sizeable Bengali and Hindi minority. The major communities of Upper assam are Ahom, Chutia, Tea tribes, Mishing, Sonowal Kacharis, Moran, Matak, Deori, and Thengal Kacharis.

It is separated from the Philippine Sea Plate to the west by a divergent boundary with numerous transform fault offsets. The boundary between the Mariana and the Pacific Plate to the east is a subduction zone with the Pacific Plate subducting beneath the Mariana. This eastern subduction is divided into the Mariana Trench, which forms the southeastern boundary, and the Izu-Ogasawara Trench the northeastern boundary. The subduction plate motion is responsible for the shape of the Mariana plate and back arc.  Geological History  Subduction at the Mariana plate has been going on for over 50 million years. Some theories of the origin of this microplate is that when the Pacific plate began to subduct beneath the Philippine plate the volcanism and spreading ridge started to make an arc. This geological activity caused the section of the Philippine plate to break off and become the Mariana microplate. The Mariana Islands consist of volcanoes that are active and dormant and are made up of volcanic and sedimentary rocks from the Pleistocene.  Defining Features  As the Pacific Plate subducts beneath the Mariana Plate, it creates a trench. This is the Mariana Trench, and it is the deepest trench in the world. Another result from this subduction are the Mariana Islands. These are formed from dehydration of the subducting, old oceanic crust creates melt, and the melt rises to the surface through a volcano. This volcanism has been occurring for almost 50 million years. The rock type in the area is volcaniclastic sediments on top of igneous rocks. The source of these rocks are from crustal spreading. Just off the eastern coast of Mariana there are big seamounts made of serpentinized periodite. They are formed from mud volcanism. The composition for the seamounts differ in the Izu-Ogasawara Trench and Mariana systems which indicates regional changes in geology.  Tectonic Behavior  = Eastern Convergent Boundary = Mariana Plate Boundary. 1 is West Mariana Ridge, 2 is Mariana Trough, 3 is Mariana Arc, 4 is Mariana Fore-Arc, 5 is Mariana Trench The tectonic plate is approximately 100 km thick and converging to the east at a rate of 50‚Äì80 mm/yr with the Pacific Plate subducting at 60‚Äì100 mm/yr This eastern subduction is divided into the Mariana Trench, which forms the southeastern boundary, and the Izu-Ogasawara Trench the northeastern boundary. The Izu-Ogasawara Trench and Mariana subduction zones are traveling at different rates. While the northern section of the Izu-Ogasawara Trench plate is subducting at 44 mm/yr, the southern section subducts at 14 mm/yr. The subducting Pacific Plate dips at about 10 degrees and directed 83 degrees west of north. The northern subduction zone is expanding by rifting while the southern contains a strike slip fault. Seismologists have been studying how the subducting slabs underneath the Mariana island arc are entering the lower mantle and being redirected horizontally, deflecting off the upper to lower mantle transition zone. = Western Divergent Boundary = The Mariana Plate is also separating at a rate of 30 mm/yr from the Philippine Plate to the west. The Mariana Trough is located on the western side of the island arc along with the back arc basin. Around 3 Ma the basin began spreading at 4.7 cm/yr. Due to the back arc spreading in the Mariana Trough the islands are moving east while the Philippine Sea plate is staying almost stationary.  Future of Plate  Since there is volcanism happening on the Mariana back arc ridge and basin, this system could continue to grow but combining the rate of separation from the Philippine plate along with the subduction destroying the Mariana plate it is possible this microplate could eventually dissipate. The rate of subduction is greater than the rate of uplift. The collision of aseismic ridges and the axis of the trench explain how the plate curvature is evolving.

It allowed farmers to exchange ‚Äúpast, present, and prospective crop, market, statistical, economic, and other similar information‚Äù at their local cooperative meeting, without breaking antitrust laws. Previously, under the Capper‚ÄìVolstead Act, they had only been permitted to exchange pricing information. Under the Cooperative Marketing Act, farmers and their local, regional, and national cooperatives could legally exchange a host of information within their marketing systems. It was a critically important strategic authorization that enabled federated cooperative systems and marketing agencies-in-common to effectively function as coordinated entities. In addition, the Act created the Division of Cooperative Marketing within the United States Department of Agriculture to assist cooperatives in gathering and sharing data on output, prices, and demand. The Act also created the Cooperative Research and Service Division which conducted research and service activities relating to problems of management, organization policies, merchandising, sales, costs, competition, and membership arising in connection with the cooperative marketing of agricultural products and the cooperative purchase of farm supplies and services. The Cooperative Marketing act was useful, but it was still not satisfactory to the Farm Bureau or other farm lobbyist groups. For farmers, an increase in available information to help cooperatives work together was no substitute for the price floor on select crops that they demanded. Demand for a price floor was steady, and culminated in the passage of the McNary-Haugen bills in 1927, and again in 1928, both which suffered the veto of President Calvin Coolidge. More recently, \\"[t]he Treasury Department and the IRS considered a similar but alternative definition of agricultural or horticultural products as agricultural, horticultural, viticultural, and dairy products, livestock and poultry, bees, forest products, fish and shellfish, and any products thereof, including processed and manufactured products, and any and all products raised or produced on farms and any processed or manufactured product thereof within the meaning of the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 1091 (1946). While very similar to the definition set forth in these proposed rules, the Treasury Department and the IRS proposed using the definition based on the Cooperative Marketing Act of 1926, which specifically concerns cooperatives, unlike the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946, which concerns the marketing and distribution of agricultural products.\\"IRS proposed regulations (REG-118425-18). https://s3.amazonaws.com/public- inspection.federalregister.gov/2019-11501.pdf References Cooperatives in the United States Agricultural marketing in the United States ","title":"Cooperative Marketing Act"},{"id":"20711733","text":"The village of K≈Çomino, located in northwestern Poland (West Pomeranian Voivodeship, near Szczecinek) is the only official ghost town in Poland.20 Abandoned Cities from Around the World: Deserted Towns and Other Derelict Places \\"K≈Çomino is the only official ghost town in Poland.\\" Originally known as Westfalenhof, it was a large garrison and training ground of the German Wehrmacht.

History  K≈Çomino, located in a sparsely populated and densely wooded area of former German province of Pomerania, in the early 20th century was a little village known as Westfalenhof. In the 1930s, the Wehrmacht planners built a large military base here, together with a training ground. According to the Polish edition of Newsweek, in 1939 some 60,000 military personnel resided in Westfalenhof‚Äôs barracks.Newsweek Polska, A Report from an empty city by Dariusz Kozlenko In the autumn of 1939, after the Polish September Campaign, the Germans opened a POW camp here, in which in November 1939 there were some 6,000 Polish soldiers, as well as around 2,300 Polish civilians, arrested by the Wehrmacht during the invasion. In June 1940, the camp was named Oflag II D Gross-Born, and soon afterwards, French Army officers were brought to it in such numbers that in early 1941 there were 3731 of them. Later on, the number of French prisoners decreased, and they were replaced with Polish POWs, brought from other camps. Westfalenhof was captured by the advancing Red Army in January 1945, and after World War II it remained in Soviet hands, as a military base. Even though officially part of the People's Republic of Poland, it was de facto a Soviet Union territory, and Poles were not allowed to enter the town. Renamed Grodek, the village was not shown on Polish maps. Around 6,000 Soviet soldiers lived there, and the parts of the former German base which were not needed any more were razed to the ground by the Red Army servicemen. The debris was sent to Warsaw, to help rebuild the destroyed city.Newsweek Polska, A Report from an empty city by Dariusz Kozlenko After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia pulled out in 1993.Poles transform Soviet camps into capitalist beacons The derelict village became one of hundreds of former military installations in countries of the former Eastern Bloc -- Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary.

It is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Set on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, it celebrates the victory of Eakins's friend Max Schmitt in the October 5, 1870, single sculls competition. The Sculler riggers. Max Schmitt (1843‚Äì1900) had attended Philadelphia Central High School with Eakins, and the two were close friends. Schmitt was a member of the Pennsylvania Barge Club - as, it is presumed, was Eakins - one of nine men's clubs in the Schuylkill Navy, and twelve that rowed on the river. The Schuylkill Navy had been organized in 1858, with approximately 300 members, and began hosting annual regattas in 1859 (with a four-year hiatus for the American Civil War). Initially, the races were for 6-oared and 4-oared gigs and barges, but a new kind of lightweight craft was rapidly gaining popularity: the racing scull. Sculls, or shells, were narrower, longer, and a lot faster. Gigs had their oarlocks mounted on the sides (like a rowboat), but sculls had them a couple feet outside the boat thanks to riggers, triangular braces that projected out from the sides. This increased the efficiency of every stroke, and led to much longer oars. Meanwhile, boats got longer and hulls got narrower, until they were as narrow as was possible while still retaining sufficient buoyancy and balance. Schmitt was an early convert to sculls, and owned his own, named \\"Josie\\" after his sister. The name of the scull is visible in the painting just below Schmitt's right hand. In September 1866, the Schuylkill Navy's annual regatta first featured a single-sculls race (3 miles, 1 turn), and Schmitt won it. He won again in July 1867, but in September came in second to another Pennsylvania Barge rower in a longer (4 miles, 1 turn) race. He did not participate in 1868, when fellow Pennsylvania Barge rowers won first and second. Schmitt won the single-sculls title again in June 1869, but in September came in second to an Undine Barge Club rower. The Race Schuylkill River Rowing Course (1872). In 1870 the four top rowers in the Schuylkill Navy all belonged to the Pennsylvania Barge Club: Schmitt; Charles Brossman (who had won the title in 1868, and beaten Schmitt in the 4-mile race in September 1867); Austin Street (who had placed second in 1868); and John Lavens, Jr. They were the four competitors in the October championship race. The course was 3 miles long: beginning near Turtle Rock (Turtle Rock Light is the lighthouse at the northwest end of Boathouse Row), proceeding upriver under the Girard Avenue and Pennsylvania Railroad Connecting Bridges to a stake near the Columbia Railroad Bridge, making a 180-degree turn around the stake, and then heading downriver back to the starting line. Max Schmitt (circa 1871). > Starting well together, Schmitt soon drew ahead followed by Street, Brossman > and Lavens. When under the Girard Avenue Bridge, Brossman and Street fouled, > the oars of one resting on the boat of the other. Schmitt was now three full > lengths ahead. Street and Brossman again fouled in the attempt of the former > to turn the eastern stake, thus crossing Brossman's bow. Schmitt had no > trouble in maintaining the advantage he had gained, and won easily.Heilman, > p. 134. Schmitt not only re-established himself as the pre-eminent rower on the Schuylkill River, he set a new record, completing the 3-mile, 1-turn course in 20:00 minutes. Schmitt did not defend his title the following year, and Lavens won with a time of 19:59 minutes, shaving one second off Schmitt's record. Schmitt raced one-on-one against Lavens for the single-sculls championship in 1872, and won (but did not beat Lavens's record). Schmitt sat out 1873, and Lavens won again. The two raced one-on-one again in 1874, and Schmitt won again. Having regained the championship (but not the record) and never having been defeated by Lavens, Schmitt retired from single-sculls competition. But that same year, he and Lavens joined forces to help win the Four-Oared Shell competition for the Pennsylvania Barge Club. Another Eakins painting (unfinished) may commemorate that June 17, 1874 victory. The Painting Detail: Eakins's self-portrait. Eakins returned to Philadelphia in July 1870, following four years of study at the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He was a witness to Schmitt's victory in October. The painting's composition echoes the event by reproducing the weather conditions and position of the sun at the date and time of Schmitt's triumph. Rather than in the midst of the competition, Schmitt is depicted nearly at rest - dragging his oars with the disappearing eddies of his course visible in the water. The location is just downstream of the Columbia Railroad Bridge, the site of the turn in the race. Eakins, a keen oarsman himself who \\"was especially fascinated by rowing as a strenuous image expressive of physical as well as moral discipline\\", painted himself as the rower in the middle distance. He signed the painting - \\"Eakins, 1871\\" - on the stern of his scull. This was the first of his almost thirty rowing works - sketches, oil paintings, watercolors, perspective drawings - created by the end of 1874. The painting shows the influences of his tutors in France, Jean-L√©on G√©r√¥me and L√©on Bonnat, and of Diego Vel√°zquez, the Spanish artist. The Reception The painting was exhibited only once during Eakins's lifetime; at the Union League of Philadelphia for four days in April 1871. The reviews were mixed. From the Philadelphia Bulletin: > The latter artist [Eakins], who has lately returned from Europe and the > influence of G√©r√¥me, has also a picture entitled 'The Champion Single > Sculls' (No. 137), which, though peculiar, has more than ordinary interest. > The Artist, in dealing so boldly and broadly with the commonplace in nature, > is working upon well-supported theories, and despite a somewhat scattered > effect, gives promise of a conspicuous future.Philadelphia Bulletin, April > 27, 1871, quoted in Gordon Hendricks, \\"The Champion Single Sculls\\", > Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin, March 1968, pp. 306-07. From the Philadelphia Inquirer: > Thomas Eakins shows two, a portrait and a river scene, entitled 'The > Champion Sculls.'

An assessment from 2007: > This painting, the first of 24 rowing paintings that Eakins completed over > the course of four years, was the first time rowing was the focus of serious > art. However, the stuffy Philadelphia critics didn't take well to Eakins' > subject matter, even though rowing was, at the time, one of the most popular > sports.
