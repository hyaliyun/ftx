Her students included Adam Carolla, Will Forte, Lisa Kudrow, Joel McHale, Conan O'Brien and Julia Sweeney. Her professional acting credits included National Lampoon's European Vacation, as well as roles in Seinfeld and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Early life Szigeti went to Fairfax High School in Los Angeles. She later received her master's degree in acting from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Szigeti began her career by waitressing at the Pitchell Players improv club after graduating from UCLA. Her work at the club inspired her to enroll in improv classes at The Groundlings, the L.A. improv school, for $45 a month. Szigeti took the classes before successfully auditioning to become a full-time member of The Groundlings' main comedy troupe. Acting and improv career Cynthia Szigeti eventually left The Groundlings for The Comedy Store, a comedy club in West Hollywood, where she joined The Comedy Store Players alongside Taylor Negron, Martin Short and Robin Williams. In a 2009 interview, Szigeti spoke of the differences between performing within the comedy troupes of The Groundlings versus The Comedy Club, saying, \\"At the Groundlings it was all about wigs, rehearsals and costumes. At the Store, it was immediate, topical and edgy.\\" During the 1980s, Szigeti returned to The Groundlings to run the school. She also continued to teach improv, as well as directing and overseeing the training of its acting teachers. In addition to her work at The Groundlings, she also co-founded the ACME Comedy Theatre in 1989, as well as taught at Keep It Real Acting. Szigeti's improv students at The Groundlings and the ACME Comedy Theatre included Adam Carolla, Will Forte, Joel McHale, Conan O'Brien, Cheri Oteri and Julia Sweeney. Actress Lisa Kudrow, who studied under her at The Groundlings during the 1980s, called Szigeti \\"the best thing that happened, on so many levels\\" and credited her with changing her perspective on acting. In a 2012 interview with the Archive of American Television, Kudrow spoke of her experience studying under Szigeti, \\"She spoke to me in a way that no on else could have. I wasn't going to be OK with a touchy, feely, everyone sort of moan, crazy acting exercise thing. She was, 'There's no time in improv to work up to an emotion! You guys just need to have it [immediately]! It's all pretend anyway!'.\\" It was Szigeti who encouraged Kudrow to create her first \\"dumb\\" or \\"airhead\\" character, which Kudrow had initially resisted. Outside of improv, Szigeti accumulated her own numerous film and television credits, which spanned several decades. Her film credits included I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977), You Light Up My Life (1977), The Gong Show Movie (1980), Repo Man (1984), The Wrong Guys (1988) and Up Close and Personal (1996). Her television sitcom roles included WKRP in Cincinnati, Gimme a Break!, Married... with Children, Who's the Boss?, Empty Nest, The Norm Show, The King of Queens and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Most notably, Szigeti played Jerry Seinfeld's former high school girlfriend in a 1991 episode of Seinfeld called \\"The Library\\". In the episode, Seinfeld tracks down Szigeti's character to use her as an alibi for a borrowed book which he never returned to the New York Public Library. Death and legacy Szigeti died from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis at her home in Los Angeles on August 10, 2016, at the age of 66. Gunnar Todd Rohrbacher, an acting coach, founder of Actors Comedy Studio, and another of Szigeti's former students wrote a tribute to Szigeti, noting, \\"She was definitely intimidating, unapologetic, shockingly intelligent, generous, joyful and demanding... She would tell stories that included names like Bruce Springsteen, Robin Williams, Martin Short, Robert Redford and Helen Mirren. If you studied with her, your life was changed, and it was that simple.\\" Filmography *The Big Bus (1976) - Bus Passenger #21 *American Raspberry (1977) - Dawn *I Never Promised You a Rose Garden (1977) - Nurse *You Light Up My Life (1977) - Cousin *The Gong Show Movie (1980) - Diner Doll Sophie *What's Up, Hideous Sun Demon (1983) - Nurse Darlene *Repo Man (1984) - Deidre, U.F.O.

Air pollution and water pollution are challenges for Sri Lanka since both cause negative health impacts. Overfishing and insufficient waste management, especially in rural areas, leads to environmental pollution. Sri Lanka is also vulnerable to climate change impacts such as extreme weather events and sea level rise. Industrialization and population growth are major drivers of these environmental issues. A lack of public awareness and governmental guidelines intensify the problems. Background These environmental problems have escalated because of a high population growth and the increasing industrialization in Sri Lanka since the 1980s. The industrialization led to an increase in automobile use and energy consumption. The energy demand used to be almost covert by hydro power plants in 1988 (90%). The increased demands led to the construction of oil and coal fired thermal power plants which emit more greenhouse gases than renewable energy technologies like hydro power plants. A lack of public awareness and participation in government policies and environmental standards has amplified the problems. However, Sri Lanka‚Äôs government has undertaken several efforts to encounter environmental issues. Major environmental issues =Deforestation= Sri Lanka‚Äôs central and southern parts are home to montane forests, sub-montane forests and to lowland rainforests. In contrast, sparse forests, mangroves, riverine dry forests and monsoon forests are located in the dry zone. These forest covers in Sri Lanka have been greatly reduced by legal as well as illegal forest clearing. Deforestation because of a tea plantation in Sri Lanka Due to deforestation in Sri Lanka the size of land covered by natural forests decreased from 80% in 1820 to 43% in 1948. This was partly caused by British colonialism from 1801 to 1948 which increased the amount of tea, coffee and rubber plantations. The natural forest cover further decreased to 23% in 2000. In 2010, 29% of Sri Lanka‚Äôs area was covered by forests (this number includes forest plantations). Drivers of recent forest degradation are an increase in population, road construction, timber production, agricultural development and forest cleaning by private businessmen. Even though there are conservation areas, the management is partly insufficient. The extensive deforestation leads to a rise of the average surface temperature. Deforestation is also responsible for an increase in greenhouse gas emissions because trees remove CO2 from the air. By clear cutting areas the CO2 returns to the air and thereby increases the atmospheric carbon concentration.INDC Sri Lanka The government of Sri Lanka has adopted the target to increase the size of land covered by forests to 32% by 2030. In order to achieve this, the government intends to reforest degraded forests, to increase urban forests, and to improve the forest plantations. =Mangrove degradation= Sri Lanka‚Äôs mangrove forests, small trees that grow in coastal water, have been decreased by 70% since 1915. The size of mangrove ecosystems is being reduced because of the implementation of agriculture and aquaculture systems like fisheries. Shrimp aquaculture projects are one of the biggest threats. The shrimp business is growing very fast because of high demand and high profits. One of the negative impacts of shrimp farms is that mangroves are being destroyed where the farms are built. Mangroves however are very important for people living close to the coast. The reason for this is that mangroves offer products that can be used for cooking, building houses and fodder, as well as fish, and other food items. They also offer protection against floods and pollutants. Moreover, mangroves are important for other ecosystems and host animals like fish, crab and shrimp. In 2015, the government of Sri Lanka reached an agreement with private companies, non- governmental organizations, researchers and members of affected communities. This agreement protects all mangrove forests in Sri Lanka by law. Moreover, they agreed to launch mangrove reforestation activities and to create alternative sources of income for locals. = Coral reef destruction = Coral reefs are threatened by human activities such as destructive fishing methods, coral-mining, pollution and unsustainable management practices. Extensive aquaculture is the biggest threat to coral reefs. Shrimp farms are especially destructive to coral reefs. Coral reefs are very important for the coastal population. They provide food, protect the coast, and are popular destination for tourists and therefore are important for people‚Äôs income. Most Sri Lankans live along the coast and the population is growing which will have greater negative consequences for the coral reefs. = Soil degradation = Parts of the dry zone as well as the wet zone are damaged by soil degradation. Soil erosion in Sri Lanka is 14 to 33 times bigger than it would be without human influence. It has negative impacts on agriculture as well as on people‚Äôs livelihood. Soil degradation is mainly caused by unsustainable agricultural practices, high intensity rainfall and indirectly caused by population growth which results in increased consumption. Tree plantation such as tea and rubber plantation cause low rates of soil erosion. Higher rates of soil erosion are caused by crops which are harvested annually like potatoes, most vegetables and tobacco. Soil degradation in the dry zone leads to desertification. The loss of soil also is a big problem near watersheds, because a lot of hydro power plants are built in those watersheds. = Air pollution = Air pollution is a problem in Sri Lanka‚Äôs cities and it is mostly caused by vehicles. The number of motor vehicles almost tripled during the 1990s which also led to an increase in traffic jams. The use of old vehicles and poor quality gas intensify negative consequences. Major air pollutants in Sri Lanka are oxides of carbon, oxides of nitrogen, oxides of sulfur, particulates, inorganic compounds, hydrocarbons and the secondary pollutant photochemical smog. These pollutants have negative impact on people‚Äôs health as they can cause respiratory illnesses, asthma or even death. Dust falls are also an issue in areas with a high traffic density. Besides outdoor pollution, indoor pollution also is a concern. The pollutants listed above have even worse impacts inside motor vehicles and buildings. Air pollution inside buildings is a severe problem when firewood is used for cooking. In 2000, 80% of households burned firewood for cooking which sets free many fine particles that can cause respiratory illnesses, and cancer. = Water pollution = Domestic activities, industry and agriculture cause water pollution in Sri Lanka. Rivers and lakes are most affected by pollutants. Pollutants that end up in lakes are sewage, vegetable waste and waste from hospitals. The pollution of lakes in Sri Lanka leads to algal blooms, which reduces the oxygen content and has negative consequences on fish populations. The Kelani river is especially polluted because it flows through industrial areas. Industrial waste is often discharged into the river, treated or untreated. Moreover, dumps that are located close to rivers have negative influences on the water quality. Large amounts of pesticides used in the agricultural sector also get into the water of rivers and lakes. Groundwater and surface water are also polluted by the heavy use of fertilizer and pesticides and by storm run-offs. Coastal and marine waters are threatened by pesticides, fertilizer, industrial waste and run-offs from waste dumps. Rivers that flow out into the sea deteriorate the sea water. Oil spills, chemicals and non-biodegradable waste such as plastic also decrease the quality of Sri Lanka‚Äôs seawater. Microplastic pollution has resulted in a drastic reduction of fish stocks. In 2000, only 25% of the households in Sri Lanka got their water through pipes. Even the water that does come through the pipe from local suppliers is not monitored efficiently. This is why a part of the population does not get clean drinking water. = Waste management = Sri Lanka faces managerial problems in waste collection and waste disposal. A study from 2005 revealed that only 24% of the household had waste management and the percentage of access to waste collection is even smaller in rural areas (2%). Increased waste generation is caused by high population growth, industrialization, urbanization and increased consumption. Uncollected waste in Sri Lanka Provinces and local authorities are over- strained by these large amounts. Collected waste is often brought to open dumps and is not treated. Moreover, some dumps are located in environmentally sensitive locations or close to residential areas. These problems are caused by a lack of governmental regulations and public commitment but also a lack of technical knowledge, low financial resources and too little suitable space for waste disposal sites. The effects of poor waste management is waste laying in the streets, waterways and swamps. These results influence the aesthetic of the landscape, decrease the biodiversity, cause health problems and have negative impacts on Sri Lanka‚Äôs tourist industry. The study shows that in areas without waste collection, the majority of people dump their waste that should be going to the landfill in their backyard. Plastics and paper are often burned or also disposed in the backyard. Moreover, green waste is burned by 80% of the household in the southern provinces that do not have access to waste collection. Sri Lanka‚Äôs government aims to address these problems by implementing waste sorting systems in households, improved waste collection by municipalities and cities, composting systems and systematic treatment of hazardous waste from the industry and clinics. = Overfishing = Sri Lanka is experiencing declines in fish populations due to overfishing. = Climate change vulnerability = Flood in Sri Lanka Sri Lanka‚Äôs geographic location makes it vulnerable for climate change impacts. Expected impacts are an increase in temperature, more frequent extreme weather events like floods and cyclones as well as sea level rise.International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), Retrieved 2016-10-21. Sea level rise is especially critical for Sri Lanka‚Äôs coastal regions. These impacts negatively influence agriculture, fisheries, tourism, people‚Äôs livelihood, and the environment. The impacts on agriculture and fisheries will in turn influence food security and exports of crops and fishes. Negative consequences for the environment include biodiversity loss, ecosystem degradation and water cycle disturbances. Sri Lanka has set goals in their Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDC) how to implement climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies in order to prevent severe climate change impacts. The government has already implemented regulations and guidelines like the National Climate Change Policy of Sri Lanka, the Climate Change Vulnerability Profiles and the Technology Action Plans for Climate Change Adaption and Mitigation in 2014. Moreover, steps have been taking to reduce possible impacts of climate change in Sri Lanka. These steps include but are not limited to building a more resilient infrastructure, actions to ensure human health and food security during and after climate change impacts like floods and cyclones, and the protection of the environment and the tourism sector.

Among the French chemists of the late eighteenth century she stands out for her extensive translations of scientific literature from Swedish, English, German and Italian to French. She translated three books and thousands of pages of scientific papers, which were published as well as circulated in manuscript form. She hosted renowned scientific and literary salons in Dijon and Paris, and was an active participant in the collection of meteorological data. She helped to establish Dijon and Paris as scientific centers, substantially contributing to the spread of scientific knowledge during a critical period in the chemical revolution. Biography Poullet was born in Dijon and died in Paris. She was the eldest daughter of a royal notary, Fran√ßois Poulet de Champlevey. In 1755, Poullet married Claude Picardet, a barrister. Claude Picardet served as a councillor of the Table de marbre, and later a member of the Acad√©mie royale des sciences, arts, et belles-lettres de Dijon. This gave her a broad entr√©e to scientific, bourgeoisie and high society circles. She attended lectures and demonstrations and became active as a scientist, salonni√®re, and translator. She published initially as \\"Mme P*** de Dijon\\". The couple had one son, who died in 1776, at age 19. After she became a widow in 1796, she moved to Paris. In 1798 she married Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, a close friend and scientific colleague of many years. Guyton de Morveau served as a deputy in the Council of five hundred and was director and professor of chemistry of the √âcole polytechnique in Paris. She continued her translations and scientific work and hosted an elite scientific salon. During the reign of Napoleon, she was styled Baroness Guyton-Morveau. Little is known of her between her second husband's death in 1816, and her own in 1820. Translation Picardet translated thousands of pages of scientific works, many of them by the leading scientists of the day, from multiple languages, for publication in French. Her work can be seen in the context of a shift in the nature of scientific translation, away from the work of \\"solitary translators\\". Guyton de Morveau headed a group of translators at Dijon Academy, the Bureau de traduction de Dijon, in response to a demand for timely full translations of foreign scientific texts, particularly in the fields of chemistry and mineralogy. Those engaged in this \\"collective enterprise\\" needed local and international connections to acquire the original printed works, and linguistic and scientific expertise to develop and validate the accuracy of their translations. In addition to the linguistic work of translation, they carried out laboratory experiments to replicate experimental instructions and confirm the results observed. Mineralogical observations about materiality, such as the color, odor and shape of crystals, were made to confirm the factual information given in the original text. The group at Dijon Academy played a \\"pioneering role\\" in making the work of foreign scientists available in France. Some translations were published in books and journals. Others were circulated as manuscript copies within scientific and social circles. In addition, experiments were presented at public lectures and demonstrations. Claudine Picardet was the only non- academic among the group, the only woman, and more prolific than any of the half dozen men involved. She was the only translator in the group to work in five languages, and the only one to publish in journals besides the Annales de chimie. The Annales de chimie was established by Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude Louis Berthollet and others beginning in 1789. The rules of the editorial board stated, as of January 1789, that translators were to be paid comparably to authors. Some later writers, beginning with a \\"strange obituary\\" by Claude-Nicolas Amanton, have given Guyton de Morveau and others in the group credit for Picardet's work. Scholar Patrice Bret describes this as a misogynous and \\"metaphoric tale\\", contradicted by attributions in the published works and other evidence. =Works translated= By 1774, at the urging of Guyton de Morveau, Picardet was translating John Hill's Spatogenesia: the Origin and Nature of Spar; Its Qualities and Uses (English, 1772) for publication in Jean-Andr√© Mongez's Journal de physique. She became a prominent contributor to Mongez's journal, although her early publications identify her only as Mme. P or \\"Mme P*** de Dijon\\". By 1782, Guyton de Morveau's letters indicate that Claudine Picardet had translated works from English, Swedish, German, and Italian into French. Picardet's translation of M√©moires de chymie de M. C. W. Scheele Picardet created the first published collection of the chemical essays of Carl Wilhelm Scheele, translated from papers in Swedish and German, as M√©moires de chymie de M. C. W. Scheele, in two volumes (French, 1785). Mme. Picardet is credited with bringing Scheele's work on oxygen to the notice of scientists in France. Picardet was publicly identified as a translator, for the first time, in a review of the book by J√©r√¥me Lalande which appeared in the Journal des savants in July 1786. Picardet wrote the first translation of Abraham Gottlob Werner's 1774 work Von den √§usserlichen Kennzeichen der Fossilien (On the External Characters of Fossils, or of Minerals; Germany, 1774) Werner's major work, it was the first modern textbook on descriptive mineralogy, developing a comprehensive color scheme for the description and classification of minerals. Picardet's translation, Trait√© des caract√®res ext√©rieurs des fossiles, traduit de l'allemand de M. A. G. Werner (Treatise on the external characteristics of fossils) was eventually published in Dijon in 1790, 'par le traducteur des \\"M√©moires de chymie\\" de Scheele.' Because the original text was substantially expanded and annotated, Picardet's translation is often considered to have constituted a new edition of the work. In both of these translations, contributions by other authors (such as annotations) are clearly identified. Chemist and historian of science James R. Partington credits Picardet with the greater part of a French translation of the first two volumes of Torbern Olof Bergman‚Äôs six-volume Opuscula physica et chemica (Latin, 1779‚Äì1790). Published under the title Opuscules chymiques et physiques de M. T. Bergman (Dijon, 1780‚Äì1785), it has been generally credited to Guyton de Morveau. On the basis of letters between Guyton de Morvea and Bergman, Partington suggests that Picardet and others helped to translate Bergman's works without being credited. Mme. Picardet is variously credited with inspiring and possibly helping to write Madame Lavoisier's translation and critique of Richard Kirwan's 1787 Essay on Phlogiston. She translated some of Kirwan's papers. Claudine Picardet translated scientific papers from Swedish (Scheele, Bergman), German (Johann Christian Wiegleb, Johann Friedrich Westrumb, Johann Carl Friedrich Meyer, Martin Heinrich Klaproth), English (Richard Kirwan, William Fordyce), Italian (Marsilio Landriani) and possibly Latin (Bergman). Although she most frequently translated works on chemistry and mineralogy, she did translate some meteorological works. These included \\"Observationes astron. annis 1781, 82, 83 institut√¶ in observatorio regio Havniensi\\" (1784), reporting the astronomical observations of the longitude of the Mars knot, made in December 1783 by Thomas Bugge. Picardet's translation was published as \\"Observations de la longitude du n≈ìud de Mars faite en D√©cembre 1873, par M. Bugge\\" in the Journal des savants (1787). Scientific work Picardet had attended Morveau's chemistry courses and had studied the minerals in the Dijon Academy's collection. With Guyton de Morveau and other members of the Bureau de traduction de Dijon she carried out chemical experiments and mineralogical observations to confirm the content of the works they were translating. The \\"Translator's Advertisement\\" for Werner's treatise on minerals clearly states that she was skilled in laboratory and cabinet observations. She even developed her own terms in French, based on her direct observations of minerals, to capture Werner's neologisms. Picardet was also active in Antoine Lavoisier‚Äôs network for gathering meteorological data. From as early as 1785, she took daily barometric observations with an instrument from the Dijon Academy. M. Picardet sent her results to Lavoisier and they were presented to the Royal Academy of Science in Paris. Portrait Mme. Lavoisier (left), Claudine Picardet (with book), Berthollet, Fourcroy, Lavoisier (seated) and Guyton de Morveau (right) As early as 1782, Guyton de Morveau had proposed a systematic approach to chemical nomenclature in which simple substances received simple names indicative of their chemical structure, such as hydrogen and oxygen. Compounds received names indicative of their constituent parts, such as sodium chloride and ferric sulfate. From 1786 to 1787, Guyton de Morveau, Antoine Lavoisier, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine-Fran√ßois Fourcroy met almost daily, working intensively to write M√©thode de nomenclature chimique (‚ÄúMethod of Chemical Nomenclature‚Äù), which they intended to be \\"a complete and definitive reform of names in inorganic chemistry\\". A painting of Lavoisier with the co-authors of M√©thode de nomenclature chimique is believed to include both Mme. Lavoisier and Mme. Picardet. Mme. Lavoisier stands at the left of the group. The woman next to her is believed to be Mme. Picardet, holding a book emblematic of her work as a translator. Impact It was due to the work of both Claudine Picardet and her second husband Louis- Bernard Guyton de Morveau that Dijon was recognized internationally as a scientific center. As one of the two most prolific translators in chemistry during the 1780s, Madame Picardet increased the availability of chemical knowledge at a crucial time during the chemical revolution, particularly the knowledge of salts and minerals. Her activities supported the publication of specialized scientific journals and helped to establish the use of editorial features such as the date of first publication. The value of her work as a translator was recognized by scholars of her time both nationally and internationally.

He held the chair in medieval history of the University of Manchester (1979‚Äì86). Early life and education Hyde's family owned an iron and steel works, located at Stoke-on-Trent in 1930 when Kenneth Hyde was born. He was educated at Mostyn House on the Wirral, Cheshire, and the Oundle School, Northamptonshire, and then served in the Ordnance Corps. After his national service, he attended Worcester College, Oxford, where he graduated with a second-class degree in modern history in 1953, followed by a Diploma in Social Anthropology. His DPhil, also from Oxford, was on medieval Italy, supervised by D. M. Bueno de Mesquita. Career Hyde researched in Padua with Paolo Sambin in the mid-1950s. In 1961, he joined the medieval history group in the history department of the University of Manchester, remaining there for the rest of his career, as assistant lecturer and then senior lecturer (1973‚Äì79). He held the chair of medieval history at the university from 1979 until his death. He was also active in administration, serving as the chair of the university's departmental board for history, and as a member of the Royal Historical Society's council. He strove to foster interdisciplinary research and collaboration between different departments, founding a short-lived Medieval Italy Society in the 1960s and, shortly before his death, an institution that was named the J. K. Hyde Centre for Late Medieval and Renaissance Studies in his honour. Research Medieval Italy remained Hyde's principal research area throughout his career. In his early work, he focused on social structure in cities, particularly Padua between 1256 and 1328, covering all classes except the poorest, for whom records were lacking. Later his research broadened to central and northern Italy, including rural as well as urban areas. In 1966, he published the earliest wide-ranging survey of medieval literature describing cities. His 1973 book, Society and Politics in Medieval Italy, was particularly successful. According to Brian Pullan, it \\"generalized elegantly, even brilliantly, about the development of medieval Italian cities and their dependencies.\\" It was translated into Italian by Girolamo Arnaldi in 1977. When Hyde died suddenly, his final \\"subtle and ambitious\\" work on changes in literacy and written material in late-medieval Italy was left unfinished. It included the study of newly emerging genres of literature, such as documents written by pilgrims, and diplomatic records and reports. His material was collected and edited by Daniel Waley, together with five of Hyde's earlier essays on the topic, to serve as a Festschrift. Robert Oresko writes in a review for History Today: \\"For a project which has been the plaything of a cruel fate, the focus is admirably clear, the argument coherent and fascinatingly nuanced.\\" Personal life Hyde married Maura, and the couple had three daughters. They lived near Manchester in Stockport and then Marple. His wife died in 1979, after having a stroke in 1977. Hyde died suddenly in Manchester in 1986, aged 56. His lifelong interest in industrial history, especially watermills and canals, led him to be one of the founders of the Ellesmere Port Boat Museum, later the National Waterways Museum.

Conspiracy theories As a social scientist, Goertzel studied conspiracy theories and conspiracy thinking in depth. One of his first studies on the subject started in 1992 with a telephone survey of 348 randomly chosen residents in southwestern New Jersey. The survey was of 10 conspiracy theories circulating at that time. He concluded that anomie, insecurity, and lack of trust in people are positively correlated to conspiratorial thinking. Moreover, people who believe in a conspiracy theory are more likely to believe in more than one. He is therefore considered an expert on rumors, including the Zika conspiracy theories, ebola, and moon landing conspiracies. Books * Brazil‚Äôs Lula: Rise and Fall of an Icon.

Davidson, along with their childhood friend William S. Harley. It stars Robert Aramayo as William Harley, Bug Hall as Arthur Davidson and Michiel Huisman as Walter Davidson, and premiered on the Discovery Channel as a \\"three-night event series\\" on September 5, 2016.

Davidson * Annie Read as Anna Jachthuber/Anna Harley * Essa O‚Äô Shea as Clara Beisel/Clara Davidson * Hera Hilmar as Emma Rosenheim/Emma Davidson Episodes Historical accuracy While the series is largely based on actual events, and is lauded for its use of reproductions of motorcycles from the era, a number of creative liberties were made for dramatic effect, notably with the rivalry between Harley and Indian, with George Hendee and the fictional Randell James being portrayed as arrogant and manipulative executives bent at defeating Harley through underhanded corporate schemes such as patent trolling and bribery. Some of the races and other subplots depicted in the miniseries were either fictitious or highly dramatized, particularly when Hendee challenges his competitors to an endurance contest hosted by his company, culminating in a fist fight between Hendee and Walter Davidson over dealership owners being bribed into selling Indian motorcycles exclusively, and a heated argument between the Davidson brothers following the dealership bribery incident. Eddie Hasha's death was downplayed in the Motordrome sequence, where he collided into a wall after avoiding a fellow racer; in reality Hasha's motorcycle suddenly turned sharply into the rail surrounding the track, killing a boy who had put his head over the rail to watch the race. The racer flew out into the grandstands, killing him instantly. Three other boys and a young man were also killed. In addition, Hasha's involvement with the company in the first episode was exaggerated and expanded upon, although he did indeed become friends with co-founder Arthur Davidson when he worked at a Dallas dealership and raced a motorcycle loaned by the company, in contrast to not being able to represent Harley and betraying in favor of Indian as depicted in the miniseries. Arthur Davidson's proposal of 20,000 motorcycles to the United States military for World War I was also fictionalized; Indian provided 41,000 units for the military effort while Harley produced 15,000. While the founders unveiled their 1936 EL at an outlaw race in the third episode, a pre-production version of the real-world EL was revealed in a 1935 dealers convention at the Schroeder Hotel in Milwaukee. In addition, the Knucklehead moniker as mentioned by Bill Harley didn't come into popular use until after World War II, when a revision to the OHV engine, later known as the Panhead, was introduced. Reception On Metacritic, Harley and the Davidsons holds a score of 57 out of 100, based on eight critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the miniseries has an approval rating of 80% based on ten reviews. Larry Lawrence of the motorcycling news magazine CycleNews gave the series a mixed to negative review, stating that it was \\"by most accounts a highly entertaining watch\\", but was critical of the highly dramatized portrayal of the company and its founders, particularly the Harley/Indian rivalry which culminated in an unresolved cliffhanger with the infringement case in the second episode, and the events of the third episode, where Harley unveiled their new motorcycle in a (fictional) outlaw race. =Reaction from the company= The show received positive reception from Harley-Davidson themselves. Bill Davidson, great-grandson of the original founders, and Bill Jackson, head of the company archives at the Harley- Davidson Museum, commended the producers' efforts in recreating the motorcycles and the era, saying \\"they really did their homework\\", but noted William A. Davidson's reduced role in the story despite the latter being one of the key founders.

History The parish of Gyland was established as a municipality on 1 January 1838 (see formannskapsdistrikt), but it was almost immediately merged into neighboring Bakke municipality in the fall of 1839. The Gyland area (population: 1,085) was separated (again) from Bakke municipality on 31 December 1893 to once again form its own municipality. During the 1960s, there were many municipal mergers across Norway due to the work of the Schei Committee.

Unlike many other sex-fueled underground comix, Young Lust was generally not perceived as misogynistic.Kerekes, David. \\"Thrill to Stories of Graphic Lust! Two Decades of Pornographic Comic Books,\\" in Critical Vision: Random Essays & Tracts Concerning Sex, Religion, Death (Critical Vision, 1995), p. 10. Founding editors Bill Griffith and Jay Kinney gradually morphed the title into a satire of societal mores. According to Kinney, Young Lust \\"became one of the top three best-selling underground comix, along with Zap Comix and The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers.\\"Kinney, quoted in \\"Gallery: Cultural Revolution Young Lust comix from 1977 (NSFW!),\\" The Shanghaist (March 3, 2012). Young Lust featured an all-star lineup of underground, and later alternative, cartoonists. Besides Griffith and Kinney, other frequent contributors included Justin Green, Roger Brand, Spain Rodriguez, Diane Noomin, Kim Deitch, Paul Mavrides, Michael McMillan, Ned Sonntag, Phoebe Gloeckner, and Harry S. Robins. In later years, the title was a showcase for female cartoonists like Gloeckner, M. K. Brown, Carol Lay, and Jennifer Camper; as well as rising alt- comics creators like Daniel Clowes, Charles Burns, Terry LaBan, and Lloyd Dangle.  Publication history  Young Lust had multiple publishers. The comic was initially rejected by local underground publishers the Print Mint, Rip Off Press, and Last Gasp.Griffith, Bill. \\"Thinking Inside the Box,\\" Lost and Found: Comics 1969-2003 (Fantagraphics, 2012), p. viii.Rosenkranz, Patrick.

Ultimately issue #1 (October 1970) was published by Company & Sons, an early underground press founded by John Bagley. The first printing of 10,000 copies sold out almost immediately, leading to more printings and more sales. Despite the first issue's success, Griffith and Kinney were dubious about Company & Son's accounting practices, so they brought issue #2 to Print Mint (which later also published issue #4). Issues #3 and #5‚Äì8 were published by Last Gasp under their \\"Sexploitation Comics Group\\" imprint.

Kennedy's Law Day Address was delivered on May 6, 1961 (Law Day) to the students of the University of Georgia School of Law in Athens, Georgia. It was his first official speech as United States Attorney General outside the capital, and the first endorsement of the civil rights movement by the Kennedy administration. Kennedy used most of the address to talk about civil rights and how he planned to enforce them. He placed a heavy emphasis on the rule of law and the example the United States would be setting for the international community in the face of communism. Kennedy had spent a substantial amount of time preparing for the speech, which ultimately distracted him from the Freedom Rides that would test his resolve to ensure civil rights in its immediate aftermath.  Background  Robert F. Kennedy had been preparing for his first speech as Attorney General outside of Washington D.C. for five weeks, which itself went through seven different drafts with a \\"Southern Brain Trust\\" of advisers and particular assistance from Assistant Attorney General Burke Marshall and John Seigenthaler. Over time the work transitioned from a statement on organized crime to one about civil rights. Kennedy wanted to make it apparent that he aimed to change the political climate in America. The situation at the University of Georgia was tense, as the school had only been integrated in January and had been subject to violent protests. The Bay of Pigs Invasion had only occurred less than a month before Law Day, and the Freedom Riders had just entered the South the day before. Vandals had painted \\"Yankee go home\\" on a sidewalk, but this was washed away before the speech. Before Kennedy arrived on May 6, a group of protesters gathered outside the lecture hall. Police arrested five fundamentalist ministers with signs saying \\"The Bible teaches separation.\\" Georgia Governor and university alumnus Ernest Vandiver, a critic of the Kennedy administration's attitude towards segregation, was noticeably absent from the event, instead choosing to go to the Kentucky Derby. Among those in attendance were Athens Mayor Ralph Snow, State Senator Julian Cox, and Charlayne Hunter, one of the students who was involved in the integration of the school. Attorney General Kennedy, with his hands trembling, gave his speech at 11:00 AM before about 1,600 students.  Summary  Kennedy opened by thanking Georgia's citizens for giving his brother, President John F. Kennedy, the largest percentage of the popular vote out of all the states during the 1960 election. He shortly thereafter brought up his brother's proclamation of Law Day: Kennedy listed three areas in which the Justice Department was involved that required immediate attention. The first, Kennedy argued, was organized crime: The second area was price fixing: He then warned about how this negatively affected the argument for capitalism in the Cold War: Kennedy spent the most time talking about the third area; civil rights. Kennedy first pointed out how the international community was looking for sides to choose in the Cold War. He stressed that by leading by example in respecting civil rights in an orderly manner, the United States would attract populations of developing countries away from communism. He then shifted to matters in Virginia, where the schools in Prince Edward County had been shutdown in the face of forced integration. Kennedy defended the controversial actions of the federal government on the matter: Kennedy shared his belief that the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling against segregated schools was just. He conceded that this wasn't pertinent; the courts had made their decision, and that was the law. This expressed Kennedy's philosophy at the time that the law held supremacy over cultural issues and local concerns and that it was the foundation of enforcing civil rights. Kennedy promised that as attorney general he would enforce civil rights statutes and other federal legislation. He attempted to invoke a universal sense of responsibility and commitment with a quote by the Georgian Henry W. Grady: Kennedy finished: Kennedy then returned to his seat. After a brief pause, the audience broke into applause for around half a minute.  Aftermath  The address marked the first official endorsement of civil rights by the Kennedy administration. Robert Kennedy's statements were idealistic and somewhat naive; he believed that he could scare the South into compliance under the threat of enforcing the law. He had made a promise to defend civil rights, which was almost immediately tested as the Freedom Riders were caught up in violence while challenging segregation in the South. Being focused on his speech preparations and the fallout from the Bay of Pigs Invasion distracted his attention away from the Freedom Rides as they began. Three days following the speech, White House Press Secretary Pierre Salinger stated that President John F. Kennedy would be backing away from some of the civil rights planks that he had supported in the election. On May 10, 1961 Representative John Brademas of Indiana praised Kennedy's speech before Congress.

He played college football at South Carolina and Kansas. College career Initially Johnson attended Western Carolina but was granted a medical redshirt. In 2012 he played for Iowa Western Community College where he led the nation in interceptions and helped lead them to an NJCAA National Championship. Johnson then played at Kansas. In 2013 Johnson played safety at Kansas and finished second on the team in tackles with 73 total tackles, and also had 5 interceptions. Johnson was named Big 12 Defensive Newcomer of the Year. In 2014, Johnson was second on the team in tackles again with 75 total tackles, and also had 1 interception. Johnson graduated from Kansas with a degree in sociology and then transferred to South Carolina to play college football for his final season of eligibility. At South Carolina in 2015, Johnson was named one of the team captains. Johnson finished his final season of college football at South Carolina as the second leading tackler with 74 tackles and an interception. Overall, Johnson started all 36 of his career Division 1 college football games. Professional career =Tampa Bay Buccaneers= Johnson was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers as an undrafted free agent on May 2, 2016. He was released on September 3, 2016 during final roster cuts and was signed to the practice squad. He spent the entire season on the practice squad and signed a reserve/future contract with the Buccaneers on January 2, 2017. On September 2, 2017, Johnson was waived by the Buccaneers and was signed to the practice squad the next day. He was promoted to the active roster on October 5, 2017. He was waived on October 24, 2017 and re- signed to the practice squad. He was promoted back to the active roster on December 20, 2017. On September 4, 2018, Isaiah Johnson makes the 53 man roster. On March 10, 2019, Tampa bay buccaneers extend tender to Johnson. The Buccaneers extended a tender to Johnson on Friday, Scott Smith of the team's official site reports. Johnson spent his first two years in the league unable to maintain a consistent role with a team, but he was on the active roster for all 16 games in 2018, recording 48 tackles and an interception. His contract tender basically guarantees he'll be with the Buccaneers in 2019, and he'll likely stick in a similar reserve role since Justin Evans and Jordan Whitehead are still under contract. On April 5, 2019, Johnson signed his exclusive rights tender prior to the start of offseason workouts Monday, Scott Smith of the Buccaneers' official site reports. The undrafted free agent played in 15 games during the 2018 season, logging four starts. Johnson acquitted himself well over that span, posting 48 tackles (40 solo), two passes defensed, one interception and one fumble recovery. In addition to serving as valuable depth in the secondary, Johnson also played extensively on special teams. Looking ahead to 2019, Johnson will look to reprise both roles under new coordinators Todd Bowles and Keith Armstrong, respectively. On August 31, 2019, Johnson was released by the Buccaneers. =Winnipeg Blue Bombers= Johnson signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers on February 28, 2020. After the CFL canceled the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Johnson chose to opt-out of his contract with the Blue Bombers on August 27, 2020.

Kern served as a soldier in the Austro- Hungarian armed forces during World War I and suffered threatening injuries that impeded his health for the remainder of his life and which often hampered his studies. He fostered an intense devotion for the Eucharist - for which he was known - and was often found in constant Eucharistic Adoration. Kern was beatified on 21 June 1998 in Vienna during the apostolic visit of Pope John Paul II to Austria. Life =Childhood and seminarian= Kern in 1912 with his teacher Franz Lehner. Franz Alexander Kern was born in Vienna on 11 April 1897 to Franz and Anna Kern at 56 Breitenseerstrasse; he had at least one sister who became a nun. He was baptized in the local parish church on 19 April 1897 with his two names being those of his father and his godfather Alexander Kern. Before his birth his mother travelled to a Marian shrine to seek protection for her unborn child and made a promise that if it were to be a male she would implore Jesus Christ to call him to the priesthood. Kern's mother died in 1919 and on her deathbed told her son about the promise that she had made back in 1897. In 1899 he asked his mother where his sister was to which his mother replied \\"in the church\\" and so he left the house. His mother searched for him and found him gazing at objects in a store window that had distracted the toddler as he went to go and find his sister. His relieved mother took him home and corrected him for this incident. He also liked to act out a pretend Mass as a child and this seeped into one particular Christmas when he was either four or five: he received a stuffed horse and a train set although he had said he wanted instead an altar with candles and flowers. One friend of his was Aloysius Benesch whose leg, it was thought had to be amputated and so Kern went to his local church begging God to relieve his friend: Benesch's leg healed in full and did not require amputation. Kern made his First Communion in 1907 while in the third grade and then received his Confirmation - with tears of happiness as was observed - in the fourth grade in 1908 on the Pentecost feast. In his childhood he exhibited and fostered an ardent dedication to become a priest - his mother instilled in him his religious upbringing - and so in September 1908 was granted permission to become a seminarian in Hollabrunn. It was there that he became noted for his diligent attention to his studies and for spending his free time before the Eucharist in veneration. One of his classmates there was Rudolf Henz. In 1911 he was permitted to take his vows. Also in 1911 he became a member of the Secular Franciscan Order. Kern completed his studies in 1915 and then volunteered straight after to serve in the armed forces where he still maintained his devotion to the Eucharist and attended frequent sessions of Eucharistic Adoration. He was assigned on 7 October 1915 and later moved on 15 October elsewhere as part of his armed service. When he became a seminarian the superiors saw him as being under the required age to enter and so made him take an initial vow on an annual basis until taking his last one on 21 April 1912. =Armed service= On 1 January 1916 he attended adoration in the church of Saint Blas√© in Salzburg and during a 40-hour devotion asked God to allow him to share in the suffering of Jesus Christ. It seemed that this wish was granted for he was sent not long after as a lieutenant during World War I in January 1916 to southern Austria and on 15 May 1916 was sent to the southern border to fight on the Italian front. Before he left for this assignment he spent an hour in adoration at a chapel in V√∂ckalbruck and he later arrived in Schlunders at 1:30am with limited time for sleep. Kern once injured his knee while serving in an instance that required him to undergo an operation and then rest in bed for under a week. On 10 September 1916 around 4:30am a battle began between Italian and the Austro-Hungarian armed forces and on 11 September 1916 while in combat with Italian troops he was injured after a bullet pierced his lung in what became a permanent wound that he would never recover from. Kern recuperated in Salzburg until 1917. He was also awarded the Medal for Bravery second class for his service. On 20 October 1917 he commenced his theological studies in Vienna but later dropped out in 1920 due to his ill health. The end of the Great War witnessed a schism for the church in 1919 in the new Czech Republic in what became heart-wrenching for him and he had even offered himself as a living atonement for Isidore Bogdan Zaradnik - a Norbertine canon who split and led the schism. On 18 October 1920 he received the habit of his order and assumed the name of \\"Jakob\\". After his elevation to the diaconate he presided over his first public sermon on 11 July 1922. He soon received his ordination to the priesthood on 23 July 1922 in the cathedral of Saint Stephen from Cardinal Friedrich Gustav Piffl. He celebrated his first solemn Mass at his sister's convent on 1 August 1922. =Final illness and death= In 1923 he contracted a bad cold during the Easter season that also saw him suffer from several haemorrhages. Doctors later assessed Kern and concluded that he had to have an operation on 10 August 1923 to remove four of his ribs. Local anesthetic was used and so he had to endure extreme pain and he never recovered from this operation which caused an even greater deterioration in his health - he had also refused to take painkillers during his time of rest. Kern apologized to his surgeon for inconveniences caused during the operation - that being the pain he felt during it. He seemed to recover during a brief respite in Merano but his health deteriorated at a rapid pace not long after in which he had bouts of repeated coughing and spitting blood. He preached his last sermon on 20 July 1924. Kern was scheduled to make his solemn profession on 20 October 1924 but had to undergo an operation - he still made his profession before the operation. He had predicted that he would die in the operation on 19 October 1924: \\"Tomorrow I will see the Mother of God and my Guardian Angel\\" he said to a nun. He also told that nun how he was to be vested in his habit in his coffin which startled the nun due to Kern's bluntness. He had said to an aunt of his on 18 October: \\"I will not awaken from the surgery on Monday\\". As he was wheeled to the operating room he said: \\"I will not return\\" to his relatives. He died at the Vienna General Hospital during the ringing of the noontime Angelus bells on 20 October 1924. The hospital chaplain gave him the last rites during the procedure. His funeral was celebrated on 22 October at 1:30pm and a solemn requiem Mass was said on 25 October at 10:00am in which the abbot Emilian Greisl presided over. =Exhumation= His remains were exhumed on 26 September 1956 in which one priest who knew him saw the remains and exclaimed: \\"This is he! Yes it is he!\\" It became impossible for the skeletal remains to be lifted in one piece since the bones fell apart when the coffin was opened in addition to the lower portion of the coffin being corroded. His remains still had remnants of flesh on bones in addition to skin and hair being present on some parts of the skull. His right hand was still connected to the lower arm and was preserved to the wrist including the nails and tendons. Beatification Relics. The insignia of a lieutenant - his rank in the armed forces. The formal request for the canonization cause to open was lodged with the Congregation for Rites in Rome on 15 November 1956 and the latter department allowed for it to open in Vienna where its metropolitan archbishop Franz K√∂nig inaugurated the diocesan process on 18 March 1958 and oversaw its closure before his retirement in 1985. The formal introduction to the cause came on 2 July 1985 after Kern was titled as a Servant of God and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against' to the cause). The C.C.S. later validated the diocesan process on 4 June 1993 and received the official Positio dossier not long after this in 1993. Theologians issued their approval to the cause on 17 February 1995 while the C.C.S. met and also voted in favor of the cause on 6 June 1995. Kern was proclaimed to be Venerable on 11 July 1985 after Pope John Paul II confirmed the fact that Kern had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue both cardinal and theological. The investigation for a miracle occurred in the diocese of its origin and received C.C.S. validation in Rome on 20 May 1994 before it was passed to a medical board on 4 July 1996 who approved the miracle. Theologians also approved it on 24 January 1997 and the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. followed suit on 15 April 1997 before John Paul II issued his final approval to the miracle on 7 July 1997. John Paul II beatified Kern on 21 June 1998 on his apostolic visit to the Austrian nation. The current postulator assigned to the cause is the Rev. Gabriel Wolf.

Neuwirth (July 11, 1933 \\\\- December 17, 2013) was an American physician, inventor, and real estate developer. Dr. Neuwirth devoted his career to crafting and refining noninvasive practices promoting women's health. He was one of the first doctors to employ endoscopy in gynecological practice, in which a small optical instrument called an endoscope is used to examine areas tucked deep into the body. He is known as the first doctor to introduce laparoscopy to the United States, in 1968. Neuwrith is also known for his work in the pharmaceutical industry and sold several of his patents, primarily to Johnson & Johnson, between 1994 and 2003. From 1974 to 1991, Dr. Neuwirth acted as chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at St. Lukes-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan, at which time he published a critical analysis of the gynecological uses of hysteroscopy. In 1977 he was appointed as the first Babcock Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Columbia University. During that tenure, he served as an examiner for the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology from 1982 to 1998. Dr. Neuwirth contributed to at least 55 medical journals and publications in his lifetime.  Gynecologic endoscopy  One of Dr. Neuwirth's greatest priorities was lessening the need for hysterectomy, a common gynecological surgical procedure that removes the uterus while often posing significant risks of infection and other severe complications. The surgical discipline of gynecological endoscopy, which Dr. Neuwirth pioneered, utilizes optical instruments to help diagnose common female-specific disorders and pathologies, including but not limited to infertility and vaginal hemorrhaging. Gynecological endoscopy is performed using at least one of two methods: hysteroscopy and laparoscopy. Dr. Neuwirth is credited as the first doctor to introduce laparoscopy to the United States in 1968, authoring several research articles on laparosopic sterilization and ovarian biopsies. In 1969 he introduced hysteroscopy to the American gynecological community and authored a monograph on the technique in 1974. In 1976, Dr. Neuwirth developed resectoscopic surgery of submucous fibroids, arguably the most important development in modern gynecology. The technique enabled doctors to minimize uterine perforation.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992.  History  The Walton pastoral run was taken up by Richard Welford in , having migrated to Australia from Britain in 1863. Welford held the Walton run for only two years before he and his stockman, Henry Hall were murdered by aborigines in about May 1872. Welford was buried on the property with a marble headstone which said: > In memory of Richard Welford, B.A., Edinburgh, barrister of Lincoln's Inn, > only son of Richard G. Welford, County Court Judge at Birmingham, England, > murdered by blacks at Walton, 21st April, 1872, in the thirty third year of > his age. In August 1872, the property was sold to the Rome brothers, who, by 1875, were calling it Welford Downs. The homestead is thought to be constructed in 1882-83 (at the time of Welford's murder there was only a hut). In 1956, the homestead was damaged by fire and the roof was replaced with a flatter hip roof. Following heavy rain in 1963, the stone kitchen was demolished. In 1989, major renovations brought the building to its present state. The homestead is now used as staff quarters for the Welford National Park.  Heritage listing  Welford Homestead was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 August 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Welford Homestead illustrates the early exploration and settlement of Queensland as pastoral land, later instrumental in the formation of towns throughout Queensland. Welford Homestead is constructed using the pise methods and is a rare surviving example of its type. It demonstrates a high degree of creative achievement in using natural resources for construction purposes. It has the potential to yield information through historical and archaeological research that will contribute to an understanding of Queensland's history. It is also an uncommon example of an intact homestead setting. As such, it demonstrates the principal characteristics of its class and contributes to an understanding of early station life. Welford Station has special associations with the community as one of the first stations in the region.

It is the second rauisuchid known from the southwestern United States, and it highlights the wide biogeographic range similar rauisuchid taxa occupied during the Late Triassic across Pangaea, despite the varied faunal assemblages at different latitudes. Discovery Stratigraphic and geographic location of the Hayden Quarry Vivaron was named in 2016 from material collected at the Hayden Quarry at Ghost Ranch, New Mexico in 2009. The locality is part of the Chinle Formation in the Petrified Forest Member, and dates to the middle Norian ~212 Ma, possibly representing one of the youngest known rauisuchids. Prior to its description, all Late Triassic rauisuchid material from Texas, Arizona and New Mexico had been referred to Postosuchus kirkpatricki. However, the rauisuchid remains from Hayden Quarry could be clearly distinguished from Postosuchus, and was erected as a new taxon Vivaron haydeni. The generic epithet was named for Vivaron, a mythical 30 foot rattlesnake spirit that was said to live under Mesa Huerfano (Orphan Mesa) at Ghost Ranch, and the specific name in honour of John Hayden, a hiker who discovered the Hayden Quarry in 2002 where the material for Vivaron was collected. Description Vivaron is known only from three jaw bones, associated skull fragments and referred hip bones. Comparisons with related taxa allow for an estimated length of 12 to 18 feet (~3.5 to ~5 metres), similar in size and appearance to other rauisuchids. Vivaron can be distinguished from other rauisuchids by the presence of two prongs on the posterior portion of the maxilla where it articulates with the jugal. It is also unique among rauisuchids by possessing five alveoli in the premaxilla, similar to the state in early crocodylomorphs but in contrast with other rauisuchids, which only have four alveoli (however, a reconstruction of a Postosuchus skull (UCMP A269) figured in Long & Murry 1995 (Fig. 121) possibly shows a fifth alveolus in the left premaxilla). Vivaron was noted to share a number of characteristics with Teratosaurus, to which it is believed to be closely related to, particularly features of the maxilla and antorbital fossa. The referred hip elements also share similarities to the referred hips of Teratosaurus, potentially supporting their referral to each taxon, despite neither being directly associated with the holotype. Classification Referred premaxilla Vivaron was found to be a member of Rauisuchidae by Lessner et al. 2016 in their phylogenetic analysis, with no changes to the relationships of pseudosuchians found in a previous analysis (Nesbitt, 2011). The analysis recovered Rauisuchidae as monophyletic but completely unresolved, with all six species in a polytomy. Surveys of the interrelationships within Rauisuchidae found P. kirkpatricki as the sister taxon of Polonosuchus, and Rauisuchus as the sister taxon to the rest of Rauisuchidae. The presence of Vivaron in the southwestern United States in addition to Postosuchus has implications for the classification of numerous other rauisuchid material from these locations, as almost all of it had been referred to the single species Postosuchus kirkpatricki based on their geographic location. Vivaron demonstrates the need for more detailed morphological analysis of all rauisuchid remains in the southwestern United States when determining their assignment within the group, and not refer them to a taxon based only on geographic distribution. The inferred close relationship between Vivaron and Teratosaurus also has implications for the biogeography of middle Norian Pangaea. During the late Carnian to early Norian, very similar faunal associations were present across Pangaea, all of which included rauisuchid taxa. However, by the middle Norian faunal assemblages were becoming disparate, particularly evident between high-latitude locations in Europe (including sauropodomorphs, phytosaurs, aetosaurs and turtles) and the lower- latitude southern United States (including dinosauromorphs, metoposaurs, phytosaurs, aetosaurs and non-archosaur archosauromorphs). The close relationship between Vivaron and Teratosaurus demonstrates that despite being widely geographically separated and belonging to distinct faunal assemblages, there was a clear biogeographic link between the Chinle Formation and high- latitude Pangaea, and that rauisuchids were able to main a widespread distribution into the middle Norian.

Role in Indian Independence Movement  The village Eram was remote, inaccessible and far from cities, surrounded by the Bay of Bengal and two rivers Gamoi and Kansbans and thick jungles the place was sleepy and silent to reach. From 1920, Eram was a secret place for Utkal Congress meetings, Gopabandhu Das, Harekrushna Mahatab and other Congress leaders used Eram as a place for public meetings to share the messages about Quit India Movement or Non-cooperation Movement of Mahatma Gandhi and to propagate the Gandhian ideals of freedom struggle among the villagers.  1942 Mass attack incident  On 28 September 1942 there was a huge gathering at that place to protest against British Raj and to prepare a course plan of action to fight against British.

In July 2016, the owners of two local competing radio stations filed a letter with the Federal Communications Commission regarding the station, noting it would occasionally broadcast a silent carrier, or another licensed broadcast station out of Evanston, Wyoming, some 100 miles to the west. Both filed that the station made on air claims that it would create a translator network and increase its power, however the FCC noted that there were no applications for such changes. It was also claimed that the station was rebroadcasting an internet radio station out of a private residence in Rock Springs, Wyoming, and had no main studio. In addressing the main studio concern, the station informed the FCC that it was broadcasting from a studio in Rock Springs. The station remained silent until August 2016, when it flipped to a country format. The FCC dismissed the claims made by the competing stations in December 2016. Signal KREO can be heard throughout Sweetwater County. The station's broadcast tower is located on top of Wilkins Peak between Rock Springs and Green River. KREO's tower is above sea level.

Merrie Melodies cartoon directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on December 18, 1937. Timed at 5 minutes and 50 seconds, September in the Rain may well be the shortest among all Warners Bros. Merrie Melodies or Looney Tunes animated short subjects. Due to the controversy engendered by the sequences considered to depict racial stereotyping, it has been most commonly edited to a much shorter running of four or even three minutes, with the invariable excision of the Fats Waller‚ÄìLouis Armstrong \\"Nagasaki\\" production number\\"Racist Cartoon: Tin Pan Alley Cats\\" at US Slave (March 28, 2012) and, often, the Al Jolson title song performance. Although not listed among the Censored Eleven, the cartoon has been exhibited infrequently, even in its brief censored version.Original title card, screen captures and other images associated with September in the Rain Re-released under the \\"Blue Ribbon\\" label, September in the Rain was shorn of its original title card containing all the credited names, however, the recovered card, along with those for other \\"Blue Ribbon\\" reissues, is available for viewing.Original title card for September in the Rain at Cartoon Research Synopsis =\\"Am I Blue?\\", coffee, clog dance and bagpipe music= Seen from the inside of a brightly lit grocery store, the plate glass storefront window shows a dark and rainy night. The song \\"Am I Blue?\\" (voice of unbilled Wini Shaw) is heard, revealing the performer to be a bottle of blueing with a face, arms and legs. The bottle's feet are shod in spats- covered footwear and its label states, \\"for keeping your clothes white and clean\\". Next, a white-bearded fakir on a coffee can label (which also depicts the indistinct words \\"air-tite dated\\" / \\"deffe that is coffee\\") plays a pungi- like instrument, causing a tube of \\"Tootsie Tooth Paste\\" to squeeze out a stream of snake-dancing paste with the tube's cap serving as a hat. Then, a can marked \\"Searchlight\\", with a lighthouse pictured on the label, sends out a light beam, while four identical blonde women wearing blue dresses, aprons and wooden shoes, step off four cans of \\"Old Maid Cleanser\\" (\\"Old Dutch Cleanser\\") and perform a Klompendansen-styled clog dance which ends with the women showing their clothed backsides, including a flash of white underwear, to the audience. After that, a shallow box marked \\"Rubber Gloves\\" is seen. A single glove rises and walks out of the box using three fingers as feet and two as hands. It has drawn lines indicating eyes and eyebrows as well as a large mouth which inhales air and inflates the glove, emitting the sound of a bagpipe upon exhaling. The glove's drawing in of more air and repetition of the bagpipe sound provides inspiration to the subsequent act ‚Äî three packs of cigarettes, marked \\"Carmel / Turkish Blend\\", each with a picture of a small- scale Egyptian pyramid at the feet of a two-humped camel. The camel executes a dancing walk to the bagpipe music which carries over to the next shelf, featuring two bottles of \\"Good Ol' Scotch\\", each of which bears a label depicting a kilt-wearing thistle, the floral emblem of Scotland. The plants, with two leafy arms and two leafy legs, step off their labels of Scotch and perform the traditional Scottish dance Highland Fling, each touching a leafy finger to the top of its budding head. =Chicks and worm= The scene moves to a display of apples where, to the tune of \\"In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree\\", a worm pops out and is chased by five chicks which jump off the box fronts of \\"My Ami? Powder\\" (only three boxes are visible). One of the chicks swallows the worm and begins to involuntarily bounce around and forcibly move in violent worm-like crawl. The worm eventually pops out of the chick's beak and jumps back into the apple's wormhole. =\\"By a Waterfall\\" and Al Jolson's \\"September in the Rain\\"= A shelf featuring boxes of \\"Threaded Wheat\\" has, on its front, a factory-styled structure in the background and a river waterfall in the foreground (a stylized representation of Shredded Wheat's longtime factory in the New York State city of Niagara Falls). The melody of \\"By a Waterfall\\" is heard (sung by unbilled Wini Shaw), as the water cascades to the shelf below and rains over round (unnamed) cardboard containers depicting an umbrella-holding girl resembling the familiar image from \\"Morton Salt\\". Nearby, a raincoat-wearing boy on a package of \\"Uneedum Crackers\\", hears her singing, steps off, walks to her label and joins her in a Dick Powell‚ÄìRuby Keeler-styled duet from Footlight Parade, while still holding his oversized box of crackers. A glance at another shelf reveals a box of \\"Dream of Wheat\\" featuring, on the front, a large caricature of Al Jolson, in blackface, wearing a chef's uniform with a large red bowtie. He begins to sing \\"September in the Rain\\", a song introduced by James Melton in that year's musical, Melody for Two.\\"September in the Rain\\" song history at Cafe Songbook Turning to the nearby package of \\"Aunt Emma Pancake Flour\\", he exclaims, \\"and look who's comin' to see me ‚Äî 'tis mammy ‚Äî ohhhh‚Ä¶ nobody else's\\". Aunt Emma extends arms to him from her package and responds, with a big smile, \\"Sonny Boy\\". Jolson continues to sing and points to his \\"li'l ol' Southern home\\" ‚Äî a container of \\"Cabin Syrup\\" with windshield wipers flinging away the September rain from the cabin windows ‚Äî and then to \\"Brite Sun Cleanser\\" shining over the \\"Cabin Syrup\\". He ends with the sign-off phrase, \\"Good evening, friends...\\" =Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance= A different shelf shows a pack of \\"Domingo Cigarettes\\", with a stylized depiction of Ginger Rogers in a checkered party hat, alongside a pack of \\"Tareytown Cigarettes / Cork Tips / There's a Funny Thing About Them\\", which depicts a stylized Fred Astaire. The miniature stars step off the fronts of the packs, as spats-wearing Astaire flings away his top hat along with cane and, sporting ballroom dancing outfits, they launch into a realistically intricate rotoscoped performance in which, as a representation of their stairstep routine, they repeatedly dance up and down matchboxes, past oversize packs of \\"Park Avenue\\" and \\"Lucky Blows\\" cigarettes. At the end of their act, they segue into a brief tap dance and then walk off behind the multitude of cigarette packs. =Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong and \\"Nagasaki\\"= Watching Astaire and Rogers finish their dance, two tutu-wearing figures on the box front of \\"Gold Rust Twins Washing Powder\\", one of whom is a caricature of Fats Waller wearing a tiny bowler hat, shout, \\"swing it, brother\\", to a Bisquit chef banging upon an oversized drum. A hammer holding arm on the package of \\"Strong Arm Baking Soda / Burp and Company Carbonated Soda\\" strikes the side of \\"Kleenax for Pots and Pans\\" as Fats Waller jumps over to the box of \\"Piano Wax\\" and, with a stogie in his mouth, begins to play and sing. The other \\"Gold Rust Twin\\", a caricature of Louis Armstrong, remains on the box and sings \\"Nagasaki\\". Two roosters on the front of \\"Chicken Feed\\" follow the rhythm, Aunt Emma steps off the box of her pancake flour, executing dance steps and waving her arms, while triplicate packages feature \\"Yea Man\\" chefs singing in unison. Fats Waller leans back in his piano chair and continues to play with great speed, now using his toes, while Louis Armstrong energetically picks up the \\"Nagasaki\\" melody on his jazz trumpet, with closeup of his fingers pressing the valves. As the music reaches its climax, the viewpoint moves back to the big storefront window and irises out on the rainy night sky.Hartley, Steven. \\"187.

It was built from 1952 to 1953 by Ben Hargreaves. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 July 2008.  History  Located in Adelaide Street, Birdsville, the single-storeyed, prefabricated steel, Australian Inland Mission Hospital building was erected in 1952-1953 on the site of its predecessor, which burnt down in November 1951. An Australian Inland Mission bush nursing home or hostel was established at Birdsville in 1923 in the former Royal Hotel building, the first mission hostel in Queensland and the seventh in Australia. It was replaced by a purpose-built, pre-fabricated hospital opened in 1937 on land purchased by the Presbyterian Church. Although European explorers had passed through the Diamantina district in the 1840s and early 1860s, this semi-arid region was not occupied until the mid-1870s when a number of pastoral runs were established. In the early 1880s the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie developed to service the newly taken-up pastoral holdings of the Diamantina. Birdsville, known originally as the Diamantina Crossing, is reputed to have sprung up around a rough depot constructed by general merchant Matthew Flynn in the late 1870s on the stock route from Boulia south to Adelaide. It became the headquarters of Diamantina Shire when the shire was established in 1883. The township was officially surveyed by mid-1885 and the name Birdsville adopted in reference to the profuse bird life of the district. Located over west of Brisbane and north of the Queensland- South Australian border, Birdsville developed as an administrative centre for police and border customs. Nearly all the trade of the town was with Adelaide, and it became an important marshalling point for cattle being driven south to markets in South Australia. Due to the lack of local timber, the town's remoteness and the lack of good access by roads or rail, which created prohibitively high transportation costs, almost all the town's early buildings were built of local sandstone. The population peaked in 1895 at 220. The Presbyterian Australian Inland Mission (AIM) leased the Royal Hotel buildings (erected from ) from 1923 to 1937 as their first bush nursing home, or hostel in Queensland. At that time the AIM was headed by its founder Rev. Dr John Flynn, who was working toward establishing a flying doctor and air ambulance service for remote central Australia (now known as the Royal Flying Doctor Service). Such a service could only operate efficiently if it could be contacted quickly, which became possible in 1929, with Alfred Traeger's invention of the pedal radio. In August 1929 Traeger installed at the AIM's Birdsville Hostel one of six experimental pedal radios, the others being placed at four head stations in far western Queensland and at the Aboriginal Mission at Mornington Island, with base station VJI established at Cloncurry. The system revolutionised outback communications. Importantly, Birdsville became reliably connected to the station properties in the Diamantina district and with the new Aerial Medical Service, established by Flynn in 1928 under the auspices of the AIM and based at Cloncurry. By 1930 the Royal Hotel building needed extensive repairs and the AIM decided to erect a purpose-built hospital - more modest than the masonry hospitals erected at Victoria River Downs Station (circa 1923), Innamincka (1923) and Alice Springs (1926). AIM hospitals, previously intended to become district hospitals, changed in purpose after the advent of the flying doctor. Their function changed to that of first-aid posts, with serious cases being evacuated to larger centres. The Birdsville Hospital took years to eventuate. It was not until April 1937 that the purchase of land for the project at the eastern end of Adelaide Street, the main street of Birdsville, was completed. Flynn decided on a pre- fabricated building, designed for the arid conditions, to function as a community house and public hall as well as a hospital. The hospital opened in December 1937, and a separate Aboriginal ward, a simple transverse gabled building with corrugated iron cladding and roof over a steel frame, was added before 1951. On 10 November 1951 the AIM Hospital at Birdsville was destroyed by fire thought to be caused when a kerosene refrigerator blew up. Only the Aboriginal ward was spared, but no lives were lost. Within days of the disaster the Charleville Flying Doctor Base flew out medical supplies and rigged an emergency transceiver and aerial to restore communications, while Rev. Les McKay of the AIM Western Queensland Patrol drove from Burketown to begin salvage operations. The ruins of the burnt building were dismantled and temporary accommodation erected out of salvaged material so that services could continue. An emergency hospital was set up in the two small rooms of the Aboriginal ward and a bough shed was constructed adjoining it. Local people started a subscription for a replacement hospital and a re-building fund appeal was organised to the required. Donations of came from each of the Kidman cattle stations in the area and many other donors Australia-wide. Queensland's Minister for Health promised a pound for pound subsidy, thereby ensuring the project proceeded. Governor Sir John Lavarack setting the corner post, 1952 In February 1952 a prefabricated steel building was ordered from the Sidney Williams factory in Sydney. The materials were transported from Sydney by road to Birdsville via Broken Hill, Marree and the Birdsville track, a journey. The Rev. Les McKay spent a year in Birdsville assisting with the re-building. The Queensland Governor, John Lavarack, visited Birdsville for the first time in June 1952 to set the corner post. Ben Hargreaves, builder of the 1937 AIM hospital at Birdsville, came out of retirement to undertake construction of the 1952 building. A skilled cabinetmaker with outback experience, he constructed the building and made most of the original furniture and fittings, such as cupboards and tables on site, using North Queensland silky oak. Other furniture was of tubular steel, regarded as ideal for bush conditions, while canvas deck chairs lined the front verandah. These were used by outpatients and also for open-air movie shows, church services and other gatherings. Some of the furnishings and equipment were donated for instance, the dispensary was equipped by the Society of St Andrew, Brisbane and the Adelaide pharmaceutical company, Fauldings, gave worth of drugs. Reverend Fred McKay welcoming guests at the opening of the new Australian Inland Mission Hospital, 1953 The new hospital was opened on 5 August 1953, having cost . The opening was a community event for the Diamantina Shire and beyond. The gala event was accompanied by a two-day race meeting and a dance, and attracted the largest crowd the town had ever seen. The opening and dramatic events preceding it were recorded in the movie Diamantina Drama, one of several films produced by the AIM. A reporter from Brisbane's Courier-Mail attended and the ABC broadcast the event in their news the next day, referring to it as \\"the miracle at Birdsville\\". As with the former building, the plan incorporated a large central room (pavilion) suitable for public gatherings. The plan and footprint generally followed that of the former building, except that a central entrance has replaced two former front porches. Other rooms include a dispensary, two wards men's and women's, the latter used by the nursing sisters or visitors when not needed for patients; a wireless room-cum lounge with an open fireplace, that once housed the transceiver and a circulating library for the use of local people; a large kitchen with floor to ceiling cupboards and an adjoining pantry; bathrooms, toilets and sisters' accommodation. Sidney Williams & Co, which prefabricated both the 1937 and 1952 AIM hospitals, was a well-known steel fabrication business. Originally based in Rockhampton, it was active in the prefabrication of metal buildings from the 1890s. The Company began to expand rapidly around the time of the development of its Comet Windmill () with branches established in Brisbane and Townsville. In 1922 the Company opened a new factory in Sydney which led to the closure of the Brisbane and Rockhampton Works. During World War II the company prefabricated large numbers of \\"huts\\" for the defence forces. The company also established hundreds of offices and agencies throughout Australia to distribute and service its product. A subsidiary of the company, BOWAS, was established in 1950 as a result of the significant building component of the company's operations. This company ceased trading in 1976. From as early as the late 1890s the company was involved in designing, manufacturing and erecting steel-framed buildings for many purposes including rural and town uses. The company promoted their buildings as being white ant proof, fire proof, hygienic, long lasting and easily dismantled and erected on another site. Their so-called \\"ordinary buildings\\" were those individually designed to meet the specific client's needs. The whole of the frame was erected in the factory yard with all the joints being marked. The structure was then dismantled and packaged for shipment to the site for re-erection. There was extensive use of their locally-manufactured, prefabricated metal buildings throughout the hot, sparsely populated areas of pastoral Queensland and the Northern Territory. Buildings prefabricated by this company included: hangars; Sidney Williams Huts; the Supreme Court complex in Darwin; Christ the King Catholic Church at Tennant Creek; dormitory and school accommodation on Croker Island; and AIM hospitals at Tennant Creek (pre-1937) and at Dunbar on Cape York Peninsula (). Additional buildings were added to the Birdsville Hospital site over time. The main building was surrounded by a series of detached buildings, including the Aboriginal ward, laundry, electric light plant house (the later two made from materials salvaged from the former hospital building), goat pen, chook house and Old Timers' cottages. These cottages were built in 1963, to accommodate elderly bushmen who wanted to spend their final years in retirement in the precincts of the town. One of these Old Timers' cottages was named the Francis Cottage after Grace Francis, one of the first AIM nurses in Birdsville. Towering behind the building was a tall radio aerial and a windmill, the latter used to generate electricity. Following the creation of the Uniting Church in Australia in the 1970s, the work of the Presbyterian Australian Inland Mission, the Methodist Inland Mission and the Home Mission of the Congregational Church, was amalgamated as the Uniting Church in Australia Frontier Services. From 1977 to 2005 the Birdsville AIM Hospital was operated by Frontier Services. Like all AIM hospitals, Birdsville's was intended eventually to be handed over to local control. In 2005 the Australian Inland Mission Hospital at Birdsville closed, after serving as a hospital for 53 years. Its function was taken over by the Diamantina Shire Council, which built a clinic on adjacent land provided by the Uniting Church Frontier Services. The former AIM Hospital remains the property of The Uniting Church in Australia Property Trust (Qld), which holds the land and buildings in trust for Frontier Services, but is now open to the public as the \\"Old Birdsville Hospital historical display\\".  Description  Located at the eastern end of the main street of Birdsville, Adelaide Street, the former Australian Inland Mission Hospital site comprises the hospital building, former Aboriginal ward, \\"billiard room\\", water tanks, shed and new padre cottage. Of these, the hospital building, former Aboriginal ward and above ground corrugated iron tank and the in-ground concrete water tank are significant. The north-west facing hospital building is a rectangular structure with a gabled hip roof and is surrounded on three sides by enclosed verandahs. It is constructed on a steel frame with corrugated iron external walls, ripple iron verandah linings, Oregon pine joists and rafters, masonite and tilux internal walls, and caneite ceilings. The foundations and floors are concrete, with linoleum covering most internal floors. The hospital was designed especially for the inland. Ceilings are well insulated and low to afford maximum space between the ceiling and the iron roof, while air vents in the gables provide roof ventilation. Verandah ceilings have a gap at the eaves to permit air flow. The building is equipped with a cool storage cellar under the kitchen, an underground tank for rain (drinking) water and an above ground tank for town water, which was previously drawn from the Diamantina River and now from an artesian bore. On the roof at the rear of the building is a communications aerial. Entrance is central, via a covered walkway from the front gate onto the enclosed verandah that is built-in at both ends. Central French doors lead into a chapel. On the chapel's left hand side are two wards, both with single door access onto the front verandah. On the right hand side of the chapel are a pantry and an L-shaped kitchen. From the kitchen, stairs lead to the cellar. Double doors through a partition wall lead from the kitchen to the central pavilion. At the eastern end of the pavilion are three rooms designated as nurses' quarters with a common lounge room on the southern side of the pavilion. Western and southern verandahs have been enclosed to accommodate bathrooms and cupboards, while a cold room is located near the kitchen on the northern end of the western verandah. On the eastern end of the northern verandah a bathroom has been added. The former Aboriginal ward is located at the rear of the former hospital near the property's south-east boundary. This corrugated iron-clad, steel-framed, gable-roofed building consists of an open verandah, two wards and an enclosed rear verandah along the long axis of the building, approximately east-west. Hinged, corrugated iron shutters cover the window openings. Other buildings on the site include a separate gabled building on the north-west corner of the former hospital, now used as a billiard room; a new Padre Cottage; and an iron-clad shed used for storage and containing toilet facilities. These are not regarded as significant being relatively new structures. Other outbuildings have been demolished.  Heritage listing  The former Australian Inland Mission Hospital was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 17 July 2008 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The former Australian Inland Mission (AIM) Hospital at Birdsville, demonstrates the continued presence and importance of the AIM to inland Queensland from the establishment of its first Queensland hospital in Birdsville in 1923 (the seventh of its hospitals Australia-wide). The services provided by the Birdsville Hospital were an important component of the AIM's objective of providing a \\"mantle of safety\\" for residents of inland Australia, and this ensured that after a fire destroyed its predecessor in 1951 this hospital replaced it. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The former AIM Hospital, Birdsville is a rare example of the AIM hospital service that was established to provide medical aid to the people of remote inland Australia. Of the AIM hospitals built in Queensland at three different locations - Birdsville, Dunbar and Coen, only the Birdsville and Coen hospitals remain. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The former AIM Hospital, Birdsville demonstrates the principal characteristics of an AIM hospital viz. a simple building designed for life in inland Australia that comprised wards for patients, a dispensary, kitchen, bathrooms and toilets, and quarters for two nurses including a living room. Under the kitchen was a cellar/basement. Near the hospital were the Aboriginal ward and Old Timers' accommodation and structures necessary to the hospital's operations such as water tanks and communication equipment. The building is a good example of a Sidney Williams and Co prefabricated building and the company made at least two other AIM hospitals. These buildings were considered ideal for use in remote inland Australia because of ease of transportation and erection, and durability. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Located in remote south-western Queensland, the former AIM hospital, Birdsville was a place of essential community function upon which people relied, leading to special attachment not only for the Diamantina Shire community but those living beyond Queensland's border. The significance of its community association is evidenced by the Australia-wide fund-raising campaign and subsequent attendance and interest in the building's opening in 1953. The opening was witnessed not only by shire residents, but also by media from Brisbane and filmed by Fox Movietone for the documentary \\"Diamantina Drama\\". The hospital served as a health facility for 52 years. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The former AIM Hospital, Birdsville has a special association with the Presbyterian Church's Australian Inland Mission founded by the Rev. Dr John Flynn, which has made an important contribution to the development of medical and community services to inland Queensland since 1923. For 52 years this hospital provided medical services to remote Queensland communities in conjunction with the Royal Flying Doctor Service.

Regarded as one of the country's most astute businessmen, he is best known for his former shareholding in Montana Wines. Private life Masfen was born in 1941 in Auckland, New Zealand. He received his schooling at King's School and then King's College in Auckland. When he worked for Porter Wigglesworth & Grayburn, he married Joanna Porter, the daughter of principal Rolf Porter. Their sons are Rolf and Anatole and daughter Eugenie. Involvement in rowing After having received an invitation to the Henley Royal Regatta, he won the inaugural Prince Philip Challenge Cup regatta in 1963 in Henley-on-Thames. That year, the Henley regatta was regarded as the event that came closest to a world championship. Darien Boswell, Dudley Storey and Alistair Dryden made up the other rowers, and Bob Page was the cox. The same coxed four team then went to the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, where they placed a disappointing eighth. He went to the 1966 World Rowing Championships in Bled, Yugoslavia with the coxed eight, where the team came sixth. Masfen worked as a rowing coach for some time. He helped fund both the New Zealand women's and men's eight to attend the 2015 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette-le-Lac, France, and the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Professional life Masfen started his professional life as an accountant for the accounting firm Porter Wigglesworth & Grayburn, where he eventually became a partner. He consolidated a number of business interest into Collingwood Holdings, which became Corporate Investments Ltd. He invested in the winemaker Montana Group and held 21% of its shares until 2001, when the winemaker was taken over by Allied Domecq. From 2001 to 2005, Masfen was one of the New Zealand representatives on the APEC Business Advisory Council (ABAC). In 2003, he took a 50% shareholding in the Mount Linton Station near Ohai in Southland. Masfen is regarded as \\"one of New Zealand's most shrewd businessmen\\" and he has often displayed counter-cyclical investment, with a tendency to holding companies longer term. The Masfen family is on the rich list published by the National Business Review. In 2006, the family wealth was estimated at NZ$330m, and this had increased to over NZ$400m by 2015. Awards Masfen was inducted into the New Zealand Business Hall of Fame in 2002. He was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit in the 2016 New Year Honours, for services to business and philanthropy.

It is a remake of the 1974 film of the same name (which originated the Death Wish franchise), based on Brian Garfield's 1972 novel. The film stars Bruce Willis as Paul Kersey, a Chicago doctor who sets out to get revenge on the men who attacked his family. Vincent D'Onofrio, Elisabeth Shue, Dean Norris, and Kimberly Elise also star. The film was released in the United States by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and in international markets by Annapurna Pictures on March 2, 2018. It was the first film released by MGM through their joint distribution venture with Annapurna (later rebranded as United Artists Releasing). It received generally negative reviews from film critics, but the reception among general audiences was more positive. Plot Paul Kersey (Bruce Willis), a Chicago trauma surgeon, lives with his wife, Lucy (Elisabeth Shue), and daughter, Jordan (Camila Morrone). When the family visits a restaurant with Paul's brother Frank (Vincent D'Onofrio), a valet named Miguel photographs their home address from their car's navigation software after hearing about a night they plan to be away from home. However, Paul is called to work that night, and Jordan and Lucy are home when the burglars arrive. The ensuing struggle leaves Lucy dead and Jordan in a coma; one of the burglars is scarred when Lucy and Jordan fight back. Paul becomes frustrated with the lack of police progress on the case, led by Detectives Kevin Raines (Dean Norris) and Leonore Jackson (Kimberly Elise). After seeing two men harassing a woman, Paul tries to intervene but is beaten up. He visits a gun store, but changes his mind when he learns that a legally purchased weapon can be traced back to him. When a gang member is brought to the hospital and his Glock 17 falls off the gurney, Paul kicks it under the bed, then secretly takes it and practices shooting. He uses the gun to stop a carjacking, a video of which goes viral. During the effort, he cuts his left hand due to improperly handling the gun. Enjoying his efforts as a vigilante, Paul decides to kill a drug dealer calling himself \\"the Ice Cream Man\\" after a young boy comes to the hospital with a gunshot wound in his leg. Paul calmly walks up to the dealer, referring to himself as \\"his last customer,\\" and murders him in cold blood. At the hospital, Paul recognizes a critically injured Miguel, wearing Paul's watch stolen during the home invasion. Miguel dies and Paul takes his phone, leading him to a liquor store that fences stolen goods. The owner, Ponytail, recognizes Paul and messages one of the burglars, Fish (Jack Kesy), before Paul demands his family's belongings back at gunpoint. Fish arrives and accidentally kills Ponytail; Fish claims the burglary was done by a mechanic named Joe (Ronnie Gene Blevins) before Paul kills him. The detectives visit Paul with his stolen ring, recovered at the liquor store. Assured that the ring's discovery will lead police to the perpetrators, Paul destroys their phones to cover his tracks. Finding Joe at his auto body shop (and recognizing his facial scars from the night of the burglary), Paul tortures him, cutting his sciatic nerve with a scalpel and pouring brake fluid into the wound. Joe divulges that the third burglar Knox (Beau Knapp) shot Lucy, and Paul crushes Joe's head with the car. Knox calls Paul, arranging to meet in a nightclub bathroom, where they wound each other. Paul gets away while Knox arrives at the hospital, posing as a bystander and giving the detectives a description of Paul. Arriving home, Paul is confronted by Frank, who was questioned by the detectives (they were looking for a left-handed individual and saw him batting left-handed at a batting cage) and realized Paul is taking his revenge. During the intervention, the hospital calls to tell Paul that Jordan has regained consciousness. Paul simply tells Frank, \\"it's over.\\" A week later, Paul leaves the hospital with Jordan and encounters Knox in the elevator. Unnerved by the encounter, Paul returns to the gun store to legally purchase weapons to defend his family. Days later, Knox and two accomplices invade Paul's home at night. Paul glimpses a man running across the lawn and hides Jordan, who calls the police. After killing the accomplices, Paul is ambushed in the basement by Knox, but retrieves an M4 carbine assault rifle from a hidden compartment under a coffee table and shoots Knox dead. The police arrive and Raines accepts Paul's story, subtly suggesting that Paul end his vigilantism. Months later, Paul drops off Jordan at NYU. He spots a man stealing a bag from a bellhop, calls out to him, and points at him with a finger gun.

Production =Development= Development of the film began in 2006, when Sylvester Stallone announced that he would be directing and starring in a remake of Death Wish (1974). Stallone told Ain't It Cool News, \\"Instead of the Charles Bronson character being an architect, my version would have him as a very good cop who had incredible success without ever using his gun. So when the attack on his family happens, he's really thrown into a moral dilemma in proceeding to carry out his revenge.\\" He later told the publication that he was no longer involved. In a 2009 interview with MTV, though, Stallone stated that he was again considering the project. In late January 2012, The Hollywood Reporter confirmed that a remake would be written and directed by Joe Carnahan. The film was originally set to star Liam Neeson and Frank Grillo. Carnahan left the project in February 2013 due to creative differences, but received sole writing credit for the completed film. He was replaced as director with Gerardo Naranjo, who was interested in casting Benicio Del Toro in the lead role; this version also never came to fruition. In March 2016, Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced that Aharon Keshales and Navot Papushado would direct with Bruce Willis starring. Willis was chosen from a shortlist which included Russell Crowe, Matt Damon, Will Smith, and Brad Pitt. In May, Keshales and Papushado quit the project after MGM declined to allow them to rewrite Joe Carnahan's original script, which had been approved by Willis. In June, Eli Roth signed on to direct, with the script being rewritten by Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski. On August 25, 2016, Vincent D'Onofrio was cast alongside Bruce Willis to play Paul Kersey's brother, Breaking Bad actor Dean Norris also joined Willis in the film. On October 7, 2016, Kimberly Elise and Camila Morrone were cast in the film to play Detective Jackson and Jordan Kersey. Later on October 17, 2016, Ronnie Gene Blevins was cast in the film. =Filming= Principal photography on the film began in late September 2016 in Chicago, Illinois. Later in October 2016, it began filming in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Release In June 2017, it was announced Annapurna Pictures would distribute the film on behalf of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and release it on November 22, 2017. However, in October 2017, it was announced it was being delayed until March 2, 2018 and that MGM would handle the film's distribution in the United States, with Annapurna Pictures handling its international distribution. It was speculated the delay was due in-part to the mass shooting in Las Vegas several days prior. Death Wish was released theatrically in the United Kingdom on April 6 by Vertigo Releasing. It became available on DVD and Blu-ray on June 5, 2018. Reception =Box office= As of July 5, 2018, Death Wish has grossed $34 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $48.5 million, against a production budget of $30 million. In the United States and Canada, Death Wish was released alongside Red Sparrow, and was projected to gross $10‚Äì20 million from 2,847 theaters in its opening weekend. It made $4.2 million on its first day (including $650,000 from Thursday night previews) and $13 million in its opening weekend, finishing third behind Black Panther ($66.7 million in its third week) and Red Sparrow ($17 million). 55% of its audience was male, while 89% was over the age of 25. It dropped 49% to $6.6 million in its second weekend, finishing at 7th. =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 18% based on 155 reviews and an average rating of 3.88/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Death Wish is little more than a rote retelling that lacks the grit and conviction of the original‚Äîand also suffers from spectacularly bad timing.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 31 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. The Chicago Sun-Timess Richard Roeper gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, writing, \\"Even with the social commentary, Death Wish isn't trying to be some intense, gritty, ripped-from-the-headlines docudrama ... A number of gruesome scenes are staged like something out of one of those Final Destination movies, with a bowling ball, a dart, a wrench and other conveniently handy items used as weapons of singular destruction. It's essentially revenge porn.\\" Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1 out of 4 stars and said, \\"For a while, director Roth plays this stuff relatively straight, and Willis periodically reminds us he can act (the grieving Kersey cries a fair bit here). The script contains a reference to AR-15 rifles; by the end, Willis goes full Willis when his adversaries return to the sanctity of the family home.\\" Many critics noted the timing of the film's release, coming less than three weeks after the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida alongside the positive portrayal of American gun culture.'If the NRA made film': Bruce Willis's Death Wish remake is a badly timed misfire, say US critics Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times called the film \\"imbecilic\\", and criticized its jokey tone and \\"morally unconflicted\\" approach to its subject matter. Similarly, The Guardians Amy Nicholson criticized the film for \\"[flatlining] the politics and [saturating] the pathos\\", and for insulting both sides of the gun control argument. The Hollywood Reporters John DeFore noted that the film does not attempt to \\"use genre metaphors to address real national debates\\", making the original film \\"look philosophical by comparison\\", and he also noted the improbable and contrived nature of Kersey's mission. Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Justin Chang called the film \\"a slick, straightforward revenge thriller as well as a sham provocation, pandering shamelessly to the viewer's bloodlust while trying to pass as self-aware satire\\". Chang compared the film unfavorably to the 2007 Death Sentence, citing the lack of consequences that Kersey faces. Some reviewers stood in defense of the film. Peter Howell of the Toronto Star stated that \\"Roth and Carnahan do an OK job updating Death Wish\\", and that the film accurately depicts the \\"casual way that Americans acquire and use guns\\". He felt, though, that Liam Neeson would have been a better choice for the lead role. Matthew Rozsa of Salon agreed that the film's release was timed poorly, but argued that \\"mass shootings have been ubiquitous for so long that I doubt there ever would have been an appropriate release date for a vigilante fantasy. ... It exists everywhere in our culture, from movies and video games to the right-wing talking points that regularly thwart gun control legislation.\\" Rosza considers Death Wish his guilty pleasure, recommending it as a \\"success\\" as well as \\"a competent popcorn muncher that moves at a brisk pace, is about as engaging as your average Law and Order episode and contains an appropriately glowering (if somewhat bored looking) Bruce Willis.\\" The San Francisco Chronicles Mick Lasalle called it \\"way better than all the Death Wish sequels\\" and \\"easily the second best Death Wish movie ever made, and not a distant second.\\" =Accolades= February 23, 2019 *Worst Actor (Bruce Willis) (nominated) *Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel (nominated) References External links  Death Wish (film series) 2018 action thriller films 2018 crime drama films 2018 thriller drama films 2010s vigilante films American films American action thriller films American crime drama films American film remakes American films about revenge American thriller drama films English-language films Films about murderers Films based on American crime novels Films scored by Ludwig G√∂ransson Films set in Chicago Films shot in Chicago Films shot in Montreal Medical-themed films Annapurna Pictures films Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Vertigo Films films Films directed by Eli Roth American vigilante films Films with screenplays by Joe Carnahan 2018 drama films ","title":"Death Wish (2018 film)"},{"id":"51536530","text":"Gabriel Towerson (1576 ‚Äì 1623), was a captain and agent for the East India Company. Career He may have been the son of William Towerson, an influential member of the Muscovy Company in 1576, and an adventurer in Fenton's voyage in 1582, who seems to be distinct from William Towerson, the merchant and navigator. His brother William is repeatedly mentioned in the East India papers. Gabriel appears to have gone out in the Company's second voyage in 1604 under Sir Henry Middleton and to have been left as factor at Bantam, together with John Saris. In 1609 he and Saris returned to England; and in 1611 he went out again on the Company's Eighth Voyage as captain of the Hector, under the command of Saris. On 15 January 1612 (OS)‚Äì13(N.S.), still in the Hector, he sailed from Bantam in company with Nicholas Downton and William Hawkins. He arrived at Waterford in September 1613 having brought back, \\"Coree\\", the first South African to set foot in England, who was taken into the care of Sir Thomas Smythe, Governor of the EIC. In the following January he applied for a 'gratification' for good service in bringing home the Hector. In considering the matter, the court found charges of private trading made against him, rendering him liable to the forfeiture of his bond for ¬£1,000. They resolved to remit the punishment, but to make him pay freight for the goods, 18 January 1613‚Äì14. In 1617 he was again in India, apparently with some mission; Sir Thomas Roe, English ambassador at Ahmedabad to Jahangir, complained that Towerson had arrived with 'many servants, a trumpet, and more show' than he himself used. In 1618 Towerson returned to England, leaving his wife at Agra. On 24 January 1619‚Äì1620 he was ordered to go out as principal factor in the Moluccas, with pay of ¬£10 per month, the same as when he was captain of the Hector. He applied to go out in command of one of the company's ships; but this was refused, and, together with some other factors, he was ordered a passage 'in the great cabin of the Anne, of which Swanley is commander.' The sailing of the Anne appears to have been delayed; for she was still on the way out on 30 May 1621, when a consultation of the principal officers of the fleet was held on board her. The committee of officers appointed Towerson to command the Lesser James, on account of the differences between her pilot and master ever since they left England. In November he was at Batavia, whence he and the other factors wrote on the 6th that, \\"seeing the Netherlanders are so contentious, false, and impudent in all their proceedings, not shaming to affirm or write anything that makes for their purposes, we have thought fit not to answer their protest fraught with untruths.\\" Such a declaration seems to have a very direct bearing on the tragedy which followed. In May he went to Amboyna, to succeed the agent who was going home. Amboyna massacre On 11 February 1623 on the island of Amboyna, a Japanese soldier Shichizo in the Dutch service was apprehended on suspicion of treachery. He was forced by torture to confess that he had been bribed by the English to take part in a plot to seize the fort. On the 15th, Abel Price, a drunken English surgeon, was arrested, tortured, and made to admit the conspiracy. Then Towerson was arrested and all the other Englishmen on the island. Many of them‚Äîincluding Towerson‚Äîwere subjected to severe torture \\"first with water and then with burning wax candles under their armpits, hams, and soles of their feet extremely.\\" They were thereby compelled to admit the existence of the plot and their own and Towerson's complicity in it. On 27 February 1623, the Dutch governor of Amboyna, Herman van Speult, ordered the beheading of Towerson, along with nine other Englishmen, ten Japanese and a Portuguese. All died declaring their innocence; and considering that there were only twenty Englishmen all told on the island, and they unarmed civilians, while there were from four to five hundred Dutch, and half of them soldiers in garrison, besides eight large ships in the roadstead, their truth may be considered established. \\"It is true,\\" says the official narration, \\"that stories do record sundry valiant and hardy enterprises of the English nation, and Holland is witness of some of them; yet no story nor legend reporteth any such hardiness either of the English or others that so few persons, so naked of all provisions and supplies, should undertake such an adventure upon such a counter party so well and abundantly fitted at all points.\\" On the other hand, it must be remembered that torture was then and for many years later, in England as on the continent, considered a good and useful means of compelling an unwilling witness to give evidence, and the evidence was considered none the worse for being so obtained. The idea in England was that the Dutch were aiming at a monopoly of the trade, and prepared to stick at no measures which might secure it for them. It is perhaps more probable that on this occasion they were the victims of a blind panic, which rendered them incapable of reason or reflection. News of the massacre reached England in June 1624 aboard the Texel. The incident became known as the 'Amboyna massacre' and remained a source of tension between the English and Dutch until late in the 17th century. Personal life Towerson married the widow of Sir William Hawkins, Mariam Khan, an Armenian Christian who was the daughter of an influential merchant in the courts of the Mughal Emperors Akbar and Jahangir. Towerson abandoned her and returned to England in 1619 before resettling in Amboyna. Despite appealing to the EIC for maintenance, she received nothing and on Towerson's death his assets were awarded to his brother. Legacy In 1654, Towerson's heirs and others received ¬£3,615 from the Dutch East India Company in compensation for the events at Amboyna. Towerson features in John Dryden's 1673 play Amboyna, or the Cruelties of the Dutch to the English Merchants.

The audio-files are normally in MP3 format and spliced with audio-editing software online. The new, edited song is called mashup. The expression mashup culture is also strongly connected to mashup in music. Even though it was not originally a political community, the production of mash-up music is related to the issue of copyright. Mashup Culture is even regarded as \\"a response to larger technological, institutional, and social contexts\\".  History  The history of mashup culture in general can be dated back to the beginnings of dada and conceptual art. Artists such as Marcel Duchamp were the first to introduce already existing objects, which they rearranged and combined in collages, to the world of higher art. These artists believed that even though certain artifacts were ascribed a certain meaning, this meaning could be altered through rearranging them and putting them into a new context. However, it was still quite a long way to the beginning of mashup culture in music. From the early 2000s on, music was more and more distributed through the internet. With the introduction of MP3 audio files, it became much easier to access and download music. Not only could music be accessed easier, it could also be transformed and mixed in ways that were not possible before. Especially for younger people, this new gained freedom when it came to the accessibility of audio files lead to the development of a new form of cult around the transformation of musical pieces. This \\"reworking MP3 recordings pulled from the Internet\\" was turning into more than just a fashion just as \\"the Internet is more than just a means of distribution, it becomes a raison d‚ÄôeÀÜtre for a culture based on audio data‚Äô‚Äô states Alistair Riddell in 2001. During that time, the first versions of mashup music were published, sometimes not under the term mashup but under the name of \\"creative bootleg\\" or \\"bastard pop\\". Even though the creation of a new song by combining at least two samples of different songs was also used in other music styles such as Hip Hop before, it was only with the rise of the MP3 audio file along with easy-to-use computer mash-up programs that mash-up was transformed into an own culture as such. Especially peer-to-peer sharing was contributing to this phenomenon: People who create mashup music can easily distribute it and share it with other people through online programs.  Forms of mashup culture  Mashup culture is motivated by a number of different factors. = Statement of art = Mashup culture is sometimes regarded as a cultural movement against common, existing music that is published by the music industry. In 2002, a Newsweek article described the mashup of songs as a strategy of Londoner DJs to transform music they considered bad into something they could appreciate and were willing to listen to. Even though mashup culture has its origin in online communities, it entered a more art-related realm. It is art used as a statement against the content music industry provides. = Political statement = It can even be considered as a political statement against copyright laws and restrictions imposed by the government as well. \\"Reframing of the original narrative\\" is regarded as a way to create a new and unique product which leads to a \\"fresh perspective\\" of the original. Murray states \\"there‚Äôs the question of the kind of Internet we want moving forward ‚Äì one increasingly controlled by corporate gatekeepers who get to sanction what creative expression looks like, or one in which the freedom of this expression is valued above share price\\". Copyright issues have always been limiting the possibilities of mashup culture. Those implications by law have led to the problem of online piracy. Mashups are often created with illegally acquired content. This closeness to illegality has become part of this culture. \\"In some cases, the illegality of piracy contributes to the appeal of unauthorized copies online\\" states Shiga in her article Copy-and-Persist: The Logic of Mash-Up Culture. Even though copyright laws were intentionally supposed to stop illegal downloads, they contributed to the appeal of mashup and to the culture existing around it. = Do-it-yourself culture = Another important aspect of the success of mashup culture nowadays lies in the do-it-yourself or DIY trend. Consumers are turning into producers as well, especially due to the simplification of online tools that help creating personalized content.  Mashup in current literature  = DJ Spooky = Paul D. Miller, also known as DJ Spooky, Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture, a book about mashup culture's influence on society. It focuses on \\"the nature of that transformation\\", stating that it has been \\"fuelled by rapid advances in technology that have transformed art and communication\\".Weidenbaum 2008 He describes sampling as an essential part of our society. The book was published by the MIT Press and has been regarded highly by scholars such as Lawrence Lessig.

Plot Kevin is released from youth prison. He got there after he knocked down a man and left him behind as being dead. As his father does not want him to come back, Kevin moves in at his aunt Sonja and uncle Willem who have a son Sammy. Sammy is befriended with the shy, introvert John. John‚Äôs mother is a lunatic. Besides a separation anxiety disorder she has mysophobia and thinks her son smells. That‚Äôs why the boy must shower multiple times a day. She also divided the living room in imaginary areas which John may or may not enter. She does not permit John to stay with his friends for a long time, to have dinner with them or to stay there for the night. She also harasses John sexually. John did speak the madness of his mother with some teachers but nobody believes him. Furthermore his mother is manipulative and convinces everyone she is the victim as ‚Äúbeing the solid mother with an unmanageable, respectless son‚Äù. One evening Sammy and Kevin wait outside the house of John. As he does not show up, they enter the house. They find the mother of John half unconscious and full of blood. John sits at the other side of the room in shock. He has just beaten up his mother after he found out she cut the tires of his bike so he would stay with her for the rest of the evening instead of going out with his friends. For unknown reasons, Kevin strangles her. Sammy just watches not knowing how to react. Her corpse is put in her car. Kevin and Sammy go home to wash their clothes whilst John drives the corpse away. John is stopped by the police who finds the body in the trunk. The police starts an investigation and they are sure the skinny John would most probably not be able to strangle his mother let alone that he moved the corpse in the car. They also find out Sammy is befriended with Kevin and that Kevin once posted a message on Facebook he would like to kill someone. That‚Äôs why Kevin and Sonja must go to the police station for interrogation. Kevin claims not to be involved with the murder and the message on Facebook does not have value. Sonja thinks the police only accuses Kevin as he was in youth prison. Sammy can‚Äôt handle the incident and tells his mother what happened. She is in shock but tells to keep this a secret, not to protect Kevin nor to have John released. She is afraid her son will be found guilty as he did not help a person in danger. At same time, the police tries to convince John to tell the truth but he stays with his story he murdered his mother and nobody else was involved.

Early life Ward was born at Great Horton, Bradford, in 1865, eldest of five sons of William Ward, stuff manufacturer, and his wife Mary, only daughter of Henry Snowden, manufacturer. He was educated at Bradford Grammar School and at Bradford Technical College, and entered in 1880 his father's business. With Herbert James Riley he established the periodical The Practical Naturalist (afterwards amalgamated with The Naturalist's World), and founded the Practical Naturalists' Society. In 1885 he joined the printing and publishing firm Percy Lund & Co. of Bradford, for whom in 1890 he founded and edited the monthly periodical, the Practical Photographer. He soon became a recognised authority on photography and kindred technical subjects. In America Ward left Bradford for London in 1891 and paid his first visit to America in 1892. In America, he married on 15 July 1893 Catharine Weed Barnes, daughter of William Barnes of Albany, New York, and granddaughter of Thurlow Weed, a prominent New York journalist and politician. After returning to England they lived for many years at Golden Green, Hadlow, Kent. Publications =Periodicals and technical works= Illustration from Early work in Photography: a text-book for beginners by W. Ethelbert Henry and H. Snowden Ward (1896) He and his wife, an accomplished photographer, edited in London The Photogram (1894‚Äì1905), continued from 1906 as The Photographic Monthly; The Process Photogram (1895‚Äì1905), continued from 1906 as The Process Engravers' Monthly; also Photograms of the Year (from 1896) and The Photographic Annual (from 1908). He also compiled many technical handbooks, of which the chief were Practical Radiography, the first handbook in English on X-rays, then known as R√∂ntgen rays (with A. W. Isenthal, 1896; new editions in 1897, 1898, and 1901); The Figures, Facts, and Formul√¶ of Photography (3 editions, 1903); Photography for the Press (1905; 3rd edition 1909); and Finishing the Negative (1907). For the photographic firm of Dawbarn & Ward (in existence from 1894 to 1911), of which he was a joint director, he edited the Useful Arts Series (1899), the Home Workers' Series, and Rural Handbooks (1902). =Literature= Literature and topography also attracted Ward, and he and his wife wrote and copiously illustrated with photographs taken by themselves: Shakespeare's Town and Times (quarto, 1896; 3rd enlarged edit. 1908); The Shakespearean Guide to Stratford-on-Avon (1897); The Real Dickens Land (quarto, 1903); and The Canterbury Pilgrimages (1904). Ward also edited, with notes and introduction, an edition, elaborately illustrated by his wife, of R. D. Blackmore's Lorna Doone in 1908. Societies and travels He became a member of the Royal Photographic Society in 1892 and a fellow in 1895. He was one of the first members in 1897 of the R√∂ntgen Society, and was president in July 1909 of the Canterbury meeting of the Photographic Convention of the United Kingdom, founded in 1886 to promote photographic research. Ward was an ardent traveller and made many lecturing tours in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States. His topics were both technical and literary. An enthusiastic admirer of Dickens, he was an original member of the Dickens Fellowship, was chairman of council (1907‚Äì8), and was mainly responsible for the acquisition for the Guildhall Library of Frederick George Kitton's collection of Dickensiana in 1908. As commissioner of the Dickens Fellowship, he went in October 1911 to America on a six months' lecture tour to stimulate American interest in the Dickens centenary; but he died suddenly in New York from mastoiditis-meningitis on 7 December 1911, and was buried at Albany, New York.

Biography  Van Hoesen was born in Schoten near Antwerp, Belgium and grew up in Antwerp. He attended music academy between the ages of 11 and 14 and in those years started playing the electronic organ, then bass guitar and guitar. He was a member of several bands and played bass and keyps. Leaving Antwerp for Brussels aged 18, van Hoesen went to Vrije Universiteit Brussel from 1988 to 1994 to study for a Masters in Communication Sciences. Growing up around the time of EBM's peak popularity in Belgium, it was this and New Beat that first excited him. A first club experience came during his teenage years and inspired him to get into techno and DJing. He also started putting on his own techno events while at University and got ever more involved with the Brussels's scene. Attending clubs like Fuse in its early years, he grew bored of techno by the year 2000 and began researching other forms of music. At this time he was also developing the Foton collective (experimental music) and released a first album under his Object alias, 2001's Release the Object. In 2002 he released 1025 as RM, a collaborative alias with Jeroen Baekelandt. Around 2004 van Hoesen expanded his experimental interests and started exploring drum and bass and later dubstep. He co-organised one of the first Belgian dubstep events with Mutant Hip Hop in 2005. In 2006 he returned to techno with the release of the Increments EP. Throughout his career, van Hoesen has launched labels like Foton, which ran from 1998 to 2006, Time To Express in 2008, and was co- founder of Archives Interieures in 2013. He also collaborates with Yves De Mey as Sendai, composing music which focusses on fragmented rhythms and advanced sound design. They have released albums such as Geotope(2012), A Smaller Divide (2014) and Ground and Figure (2016) on Editions Mego. As such, van Hoesen has produced various styles of music, but is best known for his bass- heavy, abstract take on techno with a psychedelic approach. Van Hoesen is also a composer who has made music for Zoo/Thomas Hauert's contemporary dance company in the form of Accords and You've Changed, which was composed in 7.1 surround sound. He has done composition and programming for Bent Object: In Human Format and Winning, composed the tracks for Terrene with Heleen Blanken and has curated art installations with the Foton collective. As both a DJ and performer van Hoesen has played at key clubs and festivals across Europe, America, Australia and Asia. In 2010 he moved from Brussels to Berlin, where he co-founded synthesizerstudio Handwerk Audio.

Grace Cash was born in 1872. She married Harold Oakeshott and both were active in socialist circles. Grace wrote a paper in 1900 on Women in the Cigar Trade in London, published in The Economic Journal. She was involved in the foundation of the first Trade School for Girls in 1904, and in the Women's Industrial Council. In 1907 a pile of her clothes was found on a beach in Brittany where she was on holiday, giving the impression that she had drowned. In fact she had made plans to emigrate to New Zealand with her lover Dr Walter Reeve, apparently with the knowledge of her husband, at a time when divorce was difficult and scandalous. The supposed widower, Harold Oakeshott, later married again, bigamously. In New Zealand Oakeshott used the name Joan Reeve, and had three children with Walter Reeve. She died of multiple sclerosis in 1929 in New Zealand. Legacy Oakeshott was the subject of the play Grace, written and directed by her great-granddaughter Sophie Dingemans, which was performed at Wellington's BATS Theatre in 2008.

The memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens; it was unveiled in 1922 and is now a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Muncaster's memorial is one of fifteen War Crosses by Lutyens, all sharing a broadly similar design. Prior to the outbreak of the First World War, Lutyens established his reputation by designing country houses for wealthy clients. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated with pre-war friends and clients; his connection with Muncaster came from Sir John Ramsden of Muncaster Castle. Lutyens originally travelled to the area in August 1918 to discuss alterations to the castle for Ramsden, which would have cost around ¬£100,000; in the event nothing came of those plans, but Ramsden commissioned Lutyens to design the war memorial in April 1919.Skelton, p. 82. During his visit to Muncaster, Lutyens and his wife, Emily, exchanged letters discussing possible inscriptions for his Stone of Remembrance.Skelton, pp. 32‚Äì33. History and design The memorial stands on a junction of the A595 road between Barrow-in-Furness (the main town in the area) and Gosforth, at the top of the road to the village of Ravenglass on the west coast. One of Lutyens' fifteen War Crosses, it consists of a tapering shaft in Lakeland granite, to which the short arms are moulded close to the top. At the base of the cross is a rectangular plinth which is inscribed with the dedication: \\"TO THE MEN OF MUNCASTER WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR\\", and beneath that is a laurel wreath in relief carving‚Äîsuch wreaths appear on several of Lutyens' other memorials but Muncaster's is the only War Cross to bear one. The whole memorial stands on a base of three shallow stone steps and is set within a recess in a stone wall. The names of the dead from the First World War are inscribed in stone panels in the wall and the names of the fallen from the Second World War were added at a later date. The memorial was unveiled by a Mrs Cowan from Ravenglass on September 1922, who lost three sons in the war. Muncaster War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 21 January 1985. In November 2015, as part of the commemorations of the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens's war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

It is positioned to the west of Rigil Kentaurus but can be difficult to spot against the Milky Way. It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +5.57. Measuring its parallax reveals it is located away from the sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an interstellar extinction factor of 0.24 due to intervening dust. The radial velocity of this star is zero, indicating it is neither moving toward nor away from the Sun. Iota2 Normae is a B-type main-sequence star with a stellar classification of B9.5 V. It is larger than the Sun with 2.6 times the mass of the Sun and about 3.1 times the Sun's radius. The star is estimated to be 257 million years old and is spinning with a projected rotational velocity of 111 km/s.

Federation The organisation originated as the Women's Trade Union Association, founded by Clementina Black in the East End of London in 1889. It was intended to be a federation of women's trade unions, with early affiliates including the East London Ropemakers' Union, led by Amie Hicks, and the confectioners' union, whose leader, Clara James, became assistant secretary of the association. The federation was supported by leading figures from the Social Democratic Federation, including Hicks, and also male trade unionists such as John Burns and Tom Mann. However, its membership soon began to fall, and it was refounded as the \\"Women's Industrial Council\\" in 1894, with a focus on investigating and reporting on the conditions under which women worked. Investigation Under the new leadership of Catherine Webb, this new mission proved more successful, with more than one hundred trades investigated. Most research was conducted in London, but some in other British cities. Hicks and James objected to the research focus and finally left in 1908, but many other women, later to become prominent, became involved. They included Margaret Bondfield, Ishbel Gordon, Elizabeth Leigh Hutchins, Mary Macarthur, Margaret MacDonald, Lucy Wyatt Papworth and Dorothea Margaret Zimmern, and suffragette Louise Eates. The work of the organisation slowed during World War I and it appears to have disbanded around 1917. Archives Archive material from 1895‚Äì1910 is held at the British Library of Political and Economic Science.

History Founded on 12 May 1898, as US Tourcoing, the club played football from 1902 under the leadership of the supervisor of the Lyc√©e Gambetta: Albert Fromentin. The colours were black and white. Champions of the USFSA du Nord in 1900, 1909, 1910 and 1912, US Tourcoing reached three times the semifinals of the Championnat de France (1900, 1909 and 1912) and won it in 1910 . In the final, they beat Stade Helv√©tique de Marseille 7-2 on 1 May 1910 at the Parc des Princes. The club was at its peak and many players need to be mentioned here, in particular Adrien Filez (the only provincial player to be selected in 1904 for the first game of the France national football team), Gabriel Hanot, Victor Denis and Jules Dubly. North champions in 1920 and 1928, the Ustiens got to the semifinals of the Coupe de France in 1921. They were against the formidable Olympique de Paris and lost in the 114th minute. Always present in the Coupe de France (quarter-finalist in 1922 and 1926) or in the Championnat (Championnat du Nord in 1933), the club still provided players for the national team (Maurice Depaepe, Victor Farvacques and Jean S√©cember) the club chose to have professional status in 1933. Admitted into Division 2 in the year of its creation, US Tourcoing struggled and abandoned its professional status in June 1938. After World War II, the club was actively involved in the creation of CO Roubaix-Tourcoing. UST regained its independence in 1957. A year later, Charles Van Veegaete, co-founder of the sports club in 1898, died. The stadium was renamed the Stade Charles Van Veegaete from the Stade Albert Fromentin. Since then, the club played simply in amateur competitions (Division 4). On 30 June 1990 the club merged with AS-Jean Mace Tourcoing (one of the best UFOLEP clubs in the region and playing in DH in 1990), to become the Tourcoing FC (TFC), playing in yellow, white and black. The founding presidents were Albert Vandenabaele (of UST) and Roger Vandepeutte (of ASJMT). The club played in the CFA2 until 2002, then experienced four consecutive relegations, finding itself playing in the regional league in 2005. The Ivory Coast international Didier Drogba played in the youth teams of TFC, likewise with French international Yohan Cabaye, when they were ten years old. The club was renamed Union Sports Tourcoing Football Club (USTFC) in 2010. The official colours were changed back to the original ones, black and white.

History Kahnotation was developed from 1930-1950 by Stanley D. Kahn. A prominent figure of the International Tap Association, he instructed tap dance at his San Francisco studio for 45 years, and was dance director for the Ice Follies (now Disney on Ice). Kahnotation was first published in 1951, with continuing refinements until his death in 1995. Kahnotation is one of the oldest dance notations in use. In 2016, Kahnotation symbols were proposed as a percussion instrument notation to the W3C Music Notation Community Group. It was adopted in 2018 as part of the Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL). Structure of the Notation The notation consists of 82 symbols. Approximately 30 are primary symbols and the remainder are compound derivatives. There is no attempt to indicate style, expression, or any of the other dance nuances. These are left entirely to the discretion of the performer or teacher. The primary symbols define * Weight change * Movement of feet (step, tap, brush, shuffle, jump, hop, chug, slide) * Diacritics (heel, ball, toe, edge) * Hand sounds (clapping & snapping) =Primary concept= Weight transference during dance is a key dynamic of balance that must be accurately notated. The primary design concept consists of a vertical or horizontal \\"stroke\\" or \\"shaft\\", and a barb on either side of the shaft indicating whether a weight change occurs. When the barb appears at the LEFT of the vertical shaft, there is NO change of weight from one foot to the other. When the barb appears at the RIGHT of the vertical shaft, there is a TOTAL change of weight. This group of symbols define STEPS, TAPS, JUMPS, LEAPS, HOPS, and SLIDES. =Brush= The second symbol group use \\"C\\" shaped symbols indicating the foot brushing the floor over a period of time to produce sound. A brush does not change weight. This group of symbols define SHUFFLES, CHUGS, FORWARD BRUSHES, and BACKWARD BRUSHES. =Diacritics= The diacritics indicate the anatomy of the foot involved, dance rotation, and which foot is involved. For example, when combined with a STEP symbol, they can indicate whether the step is on the toe, heel, or flat footed. =Miscellaneous= The miscellaneous group of symbols indicate hand clapping, finger snapping, and sounds of feet contacting such as heel drops and toe- clicks, grace taps, etc. =Symbols= Kahnotation symbols References * Kahn, Stanley D.

He composed it in 1898 on Luther's hymn \\"\\". The full title is Phantasie √ºber den Choral \\"Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott\\".  Background  Reger was raised Catholic but was fascinated by the variety of melodies of Protestant hymns, and used quotations from them throughout his life. He composed seven chorale fantasias in Weiden between 1898 and 1900, inspired by a fantasia on \\"Wie sch√∂n leuchtet der Morgenstern\\", Op. 25 (1895) of his teacher Heinrich Reimann. Reger's fantasias follow Reimann's model of setting individual stanzas, connected by interludes. Reger wrote the works for Karl Straube, whom he met in April 1898 when he played concerts at the Frankfurt Paulskirche, including parts of Reger's Suite for organ, Op. 16. Straube believed in Reger as a composer and premiered several of his works from manuscript. The text of the hymn was written by Martin Luther, published in 1529. Reger composed the fantasia in Weiden in August and September 1898, and dedicated it to Karl Straube, who played the first performance in Wesel on 20 September 1898. It was the first work written for Straube, and the first work by Reger to find success with the public, regarded as his breakthrough as a composer. The fantasia was published by Rob. Forberg in Leipzig in March 1899. Reger had planned it as his Op. 27a, with Op. 27b a fantasia on \\"Freu‚Äô dich sehr, o meine Seele\\". The second work was published by Jos. Aibl Verlag as Op. 30. Ein' feste Burg ist unser Gott, as other chorale fantasias by Reger, is more often performed in concert than in liturgical church services, because of its dimensions. Reger commented the alleged difficulty of his organ works in 1900 to his friend the organist Gusav Beckmann: \\"Meine Orgelsachen sind schwer, es geh√∂rt ein √ºber die Technik souver√§n herrschender geistvoller Spieler dazu\\" (My organ pieces are difficult; they need a skillful player who masters the technique). The organist Alfred Sittard first recorded this work by Reger on shellac in 1908 on the Sauer organ of the Berlin Garnison Church.

A native of Bellmont, New York, Weed was an 1857 graduate of Harvard Law School. After attaining admission to the bar, he settled in the village of Plattsburgh, where he practiced law and became involved in businesses including lumber, mines, and railroads. He served in the New York State Assembly in 1865, 1866, 1867, 1871, 1873 and 1874. In 1871, Weed's opposition to the Tammany Hall Democratic organization caused a pro-Tammany Assembly member to assault him; the member resigned rather than face expulsion. Weed attended several Democratic National Conventions as a delegate and was a supporter of Samuel J. Tilden for president in 1876 and 1880. During the controversy that followed the disputed 1876 election, Weed was accused of attempting to bribe election officials in contested states in order to procure their support for Tilden. Weed was a candidate for U.S. Senate three times; when Republicans held state legislative majorities in 1887 and 1905, Weed was nominated by Democrats as an honor, and lost to the Republican nominees. When Democrats held a legislative majority in 1891, Weed expected to be the nominee and win election to the Senate, but deferred to incumbent Governor David B. Hill, who went on to win the seat. Weed died on Valcour Island on June 7, 1920 and was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Plattsburgh. Early life Smith M. Wead was born in Bellmont, New York on July 26, 1833, the son of Roswell Alcott Weed and Sarah A. Mead. He was educated in Franklin County, New York, studied law with Judge George Mather Beckwith, and attended Harvard Law School, from which he graduated in 1857. He was admitted to the bar and practiced in the village of Plattsburgh. In addition, he became active in local politics and government, including several terms as village president. Weed was also active in numerous business ventures, including lumber, mining, and railroads. Political career Weed was a member of the New York State Assembly from Clinton County in 1865, 1866, 1867, 1871, 1873 and 1874 (the 88th, 89th, and 90th legislatures, and 94th, 96th and 97th legislatures). In 1867, he was a delegate to the state constitutional convention. In 1871, Weed's opposition to the Tammany Hall Democratic organization led to an assault on Weed by James Irving, a pro-Tammany member of the Assembly; Irving chose to resign in order to prevent being expelled. A supporter of Samuel J. Tilden, Weed was a delegate to the 1876 Democratic National Convention. In the dispute that followed the 1876 election, Weed was accused of attempting to bribe election officials in the disputed states to award their electoral votes to Tilden. Weed was also a delegate to the 1880 convention and the one in 1884. He was the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in the January 1887 election. Republicans controlled the state legislature, and he lost to Republican Frank Hiscock. In 1890, Weed was a prominent organizer and financial supporter of his party's effort to take control of the state legislature. With a narrow minority in the State Senate but a small majority in the Assembly, the Democrats were positioned to elect on a joint ballot one of their own to the US Senate in 1891 as the successor to William M. Evarts. Weed expected to be his party's candidate, but agreed to withdraw if Governor David B. Hill desired the nomination. Hill decided to run; Weed withdrew as a candidate, and Hill won the Senate seat. Weed was the Democratic US Senate nominee again in 1905; Republicans controlled the legislature, and reelected Chauncey Depew. Death and burial He died on Valcour Island on June 7, 1920 and was buried at Riverside Cemetery in Plattsburgh. Family In 1859, Weed married Catherine L. Standish (1836-1885), a descendant of Myles Standish. They were the parents of five children - Roswell Alcott, George Standish, Margaret Celeste, Caroline, Katherine Miller, and Standish Kellogg. Legacy Plattsburgh's Smith Weed Bridge is named for Weed, as are the city's Weed Street and Weed Street Extension. Weed's former home at the corner of Sailly Avenue and City Hall Place still stands. It is privately owned, and is the location of a local law firm's offices.

The interior retains most of its original materials and finishes, despite a nearly 50-year period in which some were covered by other materials. with The school was built in 1868 as a district school, and is one of Vermont's most architecturally distinguished district schools of the period. The school was funded by Sir Curtis Lampson, a native of New Haven Mills who is best known for overseeing the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable. The school served the community until about 1940, and was sold to a private developer in 1951. It was converted to a two-family residence, adding dropped ceilings and wall dividers that retained most of its original interior finishes. These alterations were reversed in the late 1990s.

She is currently a Member of the European Parliament, and spokesperson of Uni√≥n Progreso y Democracia in the European Parliament. She was born and grew up in a small village in the Basque Country. She studied Basque and Spanish Philology at the University of Deusto. Her mother was a war refugee who later became an activist for freedom in the Basque Country. One of her siblings, Joseba Pagazaurtund√∫a, was murdered by ETA in 2003 after suffering threats, harassment and aggressions for years. She is married and has two daughters. She had to leave the Basque Country, encouraged by the police, after years of harassment, persecution and aggressions, and especially after her brother's murder.  Activism  Maite Pagaza is a reference for freedom and Human Rights activism, as well as in the fight against terrorism and fanaticism. She took part in different social movements and initiatives in favour of freedom both in Spain and abroad. In 2005 she was part of a list of 1000 women nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. = Against ETA = She is a prominent figure within civic movements supporting victims of terrorism in Spain. She was the President of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism and of the victims of terrorism collective in the Basque Country COVITE. Her achievements earned her several recognitions, such as the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Human Rights in the year 2000 -as member of ¬°Basta Ya!- or the Medal of the Order of Constitutional Merit in 2003. Her public stance in the frontline of the fight against terrorism came with a price: she had to live for 13 years with police escort, suffer years of harassment, threats, aggressions and both physical and psychological violence, and leave her home and resettle with her family outside the Basque Country. Maite Pagaza has kept her engagement with freedom in the Basque Country, justice for the victims of ETA and the regeneration of Basque society upon joining the European Parliament. Some of her works are reports such as ‚ÄúDemocracy and freedom‚Äù and ‚ÄúLos profesores de la UPV-EHU contra ETA‚Äù. = ¬°Basta Ya! = In 1999, together with Basque intellectuals such as Fernando Savater, citizens and politicians, she took part in the founding of ¬°Basta Ya!. They all shared the commitment to fight terrorism under any circumstance, to support its victims and to defend the Rule of Law, the Spanish Constitution and the Basque Country's Statute of Autonomy. Her brother, Joseba Pagazaurtund√∫a, murdered by ETA in 2003, was also a member of ¬°Basta Ya!. Amidst great hostility from the nationalist entourage in the Basque Country, ¬°Basta Ya! engaged in new and dynamic ways to actively defend freedom against terrorism such as demonstrations, peace convoys, putting up of posters and an online publication. ¬°Basta Ya! was awarded the prestigious Sakharov Price for Human Rights in the year 2000, becoming the first civic association to ever be awarded this recognition. = Joseba‚Äôs Mailbox = In February 2015, on the 12th anniversary of her brother's murder by ETA, she and her family set up a white mailbox next to Agust√≠n Ibarrola's homage sculpture to Joseba Pagazaurtund√∫a in Andoain. The aim is to allow the hundreds of inhabitants of Andoain who asked of ETA to murder any neighbours who did not think like them to send letters to the mailbox -even anonymously- and hence acknowledge their part in the harassment and persecution of so many innocent people. The actual letterbox has an online version which makes it possible to have contributions from all over Spain, included those of Mario Vargas-Llosa and Fernando Savater.  Politics  = European Parliament = She was second in UPYD's list for the 2014 European Elections. She is a member of the Committee onCivil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), the Committee on Development (DEVE) and Human Rights (DROI) committee.

After becoming Head of the UPYD Delegation in October 2014, she also became a member of the Constitutional Affairs committee (AFCO), focusing on European Citizenship. Pagazaurtund√∫a is specialised in international terrorism, radicalisation and religious fanaticism, as well as in prevention of violent radicalisation and yihadism. She is supporting different causes at an international level, such as democracy and freedom in Venezuela or the Iranian opposition. = Foundation for Victims of Terrorism = She was the president of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism from 2005 to 2012. She strived to have the 400 unsolved ETA murders clarified during that period. She also fostered the publication of the book ‚ÄúShattered lives‚Äù, a compilation of the stories of every man, woman and child murdered by ETA. = Spanish Socialist Party in the Basque Country = She was a member of the Basque Regional Parliament from 1993 to 1998, and city councillor in Urnieta from 1999 and 2007. She distanced herself from the party when it tried to get closer to the Basque Nationalist Party and with Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero's anti-terrorism policies.

Its symptoms usually appear about two years after adolescent growth spurt and is significantly more common in males (average age of onset, 15- to 25-year-old). MMA is reported most frequently in Asia but has a global distribution. It is typically marked by insidious onset of muscular atrophy of an upper limb, which plateaus after two to five years from which it neither improves nor worsens. There is no pain or sensory loss associated with MMA. MMA is not believed to be hereditary. Both the names for the disorder and its possible causes have been evolving since first reported in 1959. It is most commonly believed the condition occurs by asymmetrical compression of the cervical spinal column by the cervical dural sac, especially when the neck is flexed. However, the disease is uncommon and diagnosis is confused by several atypical reports. Symptoms In terms of the signs and symptoms that are consistent for an individual who has monomelic amyotrophy are the following (although this does not reflect a complete list): Initially most people notice weakness in one hand; they may feel contracture of middle and ring finger and notice a thinning of the subdigital palm of the affected fingers. Progress of the condition varies, and weakness in the arm ranges from minimal to significant. Fasciculations are uncommon (>20%); increased weakness under cold conditions is commonly reported (cold paresis). Cause The disability originates with impaired functioning of the anterior horn cells of the lower cervical cord (lower neck), but the cause of the decline is not fully understood and is still considered unknown. Researchers, including Hirayama, believe that \\"forward displacement of the cervical dural sac and compressive flattening of the lower cervical cord during neck flexion\\" is the contributing factor. Studies consistently note a loss of normal neck curvature (the cervical lordosis) and compression of the cervical chord by the dural sac in forward flexion. :\\"There is a debate about whether this condition represents a focal form of primary LMN degeneration (ie, a focal form of spinal muscular atrophy) or a local consequence of chronic compression from a dural expansion in the cervical spine.\\" A familial link has been found in a minor percentage of cases, including parent-child and sibling-sibling. Because of the unusual distribution of the disease, some researchers speculate that there could be an ethnic link. Diagnosis The condition presents almost exclusively in 15 to 25 year old adults experiencing weakness in hand and arm. A patient history and a neurological exam narrows down the possible diagnosis; this preliminary exam typically includes strength and reflex tests. Cold paresis (increased weakness in cold weather) is reported by most patients (> 80%). Fasciculations are reported as uncommon (< 20%) to common; larger tremors are more consistently cited. Males are far more likely to be diagnosed with the condition. The disease is rare and several cited cases deviate from the expected norm, making diagnosis more difficult. Proposed diagnostic criteria: # Distal predominant muscle weakness and atrophy in forearm and hand # Involvement of the unilateral upper extremity almost always all the time # Onset between the ages of 10 to early 20s # Insidious onset with gradual progression for the first several years, followed by stabilization # No lower extremity involvement # No sensory disturbance and tendon reflex abnormalities # Exclusion of other diseases (e.g., motor neuron disease, multifocal motor neuropathy, brachial plexopathy, spinal cord tumors, syringomyelia, cervical vertebral abnormalities, anterior interosseous, or deep ulnar neuropathy) MRI A neurological exam can suggest different motor neuron diseases (such as MMA), but to more confidently distinguish MMA from the diseases it mimics, advanced diagnostic tools are called for. These include exam tools such as Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) tests. An MRI examination of the neck would typically reveal - for a positive MMA diagnosis‚Äîsome constriction of the cervical cord and an abnormal forward extension of the neck, (\\"loss of cervical lordosis\\"); pressure by the dura on the nerve cord apparently causes the flattening / narrowing. An EMG test reveals loss of the nerve supply, or denervation, in the affected limb without a conduction block (a nerve blockage restricted to a small segment of the nerve). In early stages of the disease MMA may be confused for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), cervical spondylotic amyotrophy (CSA), and other challenging neurological diseases, as well as conditions that are minor but that call for very different treatments, such as advanced carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). Symptoms somewhat differ. Pain and tingling in the hand is typically present in CTS and absent from MMA; loss of function presents differently; with careful electrophysiological study and neurological exams the two are distinguished. In early stages, ALS, SCA, and MMA, presentation may be similar. Both CSA and ALS ultimately have more extensive symptoms. MMA is more prevalent in young people while ALS and CSA are more common in older populations. With ALS, hand symptoms usually more commonly both proximal and distal vs in MMA mostly distal only, and with ALS fasciculations (twitching) are often present in upper extremities, but rarely in MMA. MMA is usually eliminated from consideration if disability expresses itself in more than one extremity or in lower extremities (legs), but symptomatic absence may not rule out ALS for three to five years after initial onset. Electrophysiological texts and reflex tests tend to yield different results, but interpretation is at times subjective. Treatment At present there is no cure for MMA. The impact on the affected individual ranges from minimal to significant depending on the extent of the weakness. Physical and occupational therapies include muscle strengthening exercises and training in hand coordination. Early use of a cervical collar is increasingly encouraged as therapeutic for arresting further compression of the cervical spinal cord. Spinal surgery on patients with more advanced symptoms has met with reported success, but is still regarded as experimental. Prognosis The symptoms of MMA usually progress slowly for two to five years and then remain stable for many years. The weakness can progress to the opposite limb, although whether this progression is typical or rare is under discussion. Cases of patient improvement and deterioration have both been described, but are atypical. Initially MMA can be confused for slowly progressing case of other neurological diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); initial symptoms can be similar, but their causes are apparently different, and their outcomes markedly so. Diagnostic tools have improved since first described, and a few therapies are being introduced. But sometimes several years of observation are needed before a definitive diagnosis can be made. Use of a cervical collar may afford relief, and some researchers advocate its therapeutic use. There is also a slowly progressive variant of MMA known as O'Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, which only affects the small muscles of the hand and forearm and has a slowly progressive course. Epidemiology  MMA is described most frequently in Asia, with studies of a few hundred individuals emerging from Japan, China and India; it is much less commonly seen in North America and Europe. The disease (disorder) was first described by Keizo Hirayama in 1959 as \\"juvenile muscular atrophy of unilateral upper extremity\\". In 1984 Mandavilli Gourie-Devi (et al) introduced the term ‚Äúmonomelic amyotrophy‚Äù. The disease primarily (but not exclusively) affects young (15- to 25-year-old) males. As of 2014 there had been less than 1500 described cases, starting with the patients in Hirayama's 1959 study. The condition is disproportionately high in Asia but no conclusive reason has been found for this. To date the largest studies recorded are Japan (333 cases), India (279 cases), (179 cases) and China (179 cases). Etymology Both the names for the disorder and its possible causes have been evolving since first reported. Because this condition has been found almost exclusively in healthy young adults and stabilizes after a few years, a span of 23 years elapsed between the time Hirayama first described the condition, and the first death (from cancer), and autopsy. Over the several decades since first reported, a majority of researchers now describe this as a biomechanical condition linked to adolescent growth spurt. However, this is not yet a universal conclusion and there are anomalous reports that suggest an incomplete understanding of the condition.

Page 90 The region's waters have also become highly polluted due to millions of tons of oil being spilled. Due to these reasons, the region has become afflicted with militancy.J√ºrgen Scheffran, Michael Brzoska, Hans G√ºnter Brauch, P.

Page 534 People of the region have protested against the negative impact of the oil industry, corruption and lack of development. In recent years, militant groups seeking to control the resources have indulged in oil theft and violence which sometimes has been claimed as retribution for mistreatment of the locals by the oil industry.E.M. Young Food and Development (2013). Routledge. Page 534 A violent insurgency was carried out under the banner Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) until an amnesty agreement in 2009 by Late President Umaru Musa Yar'adua. The election of Goodluck Jonathan (a Christian) as President of Nigeria was a significant factor in the ceasefire as he hailed from the region and was considered to be sympathetic to it. The conflict reignited after the election of Muhammadu Buhari (a Muslim) as president in 2015. This was due, in part, to rumours that Buhari was considering scrapping the amnesty agreement and, more generally, the traditional northern‚Äìsouthern and Muslim‚ÄìChristian divide. Conflict =February - August 2016= A spate of bombings on oil installations started in February 2016. The Niger Delta Avengers (NDA) then publicly announced its existence in March 2016. The NDA's declared aims are to create a sovereign state and they have threatened to disrupt Nigeria's economy to achieve their goals. The group has also criticised President of Nigeria Muhammadu Buhari for never visiting the region as well as for his detention of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) leader Nnamdi Kanu, who said he was not affiliated with either MEND or the NDA. A militant group calling itself Red Egbesu Water Lions later emerged in May 2016 and demanded his release, as well as that of former National Security Advisor Sambo Dasuki. It also demanded that the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission de-freeze the bank accounts of Government Ekpemupolo, as well as unconditional compensation to the victims of the Bonga oil spill and Chevron gas explosion. It further threatened to shut down all oil exploration activities in the region of its demands were not met. Another group calling itself Egbesu Mightier Fraternity emerged in the same month, demanding the release of Kanu and Dasuki in 14 days and that the Nigerian military leave the Gbaramatu Kingdom and stop harassing Ekpemupolo. It also threatened to blow up all offshore facilities in the region if the government did not meet its demands. A group calling itself Joint Niger Delta Liberation Force emerged in early June 2016 and vowed to launch six missiles in the Niger Delta on 7 June. It further warned that it will bring down any helicopter deployed in the area and that it might shut down the Nigerian satellite orbit within a week so that telecommunications within the country would be cut off. It also demanded that the Nigerian military leave the Ijaw communities. On 7 June, it renewed its threat claiming that it was going to target national buildings and infrastructure of oil companies in Lagos, Abuja and Kaduna, as well as all military formations in Lagos, Abuja, Kaduna and Benue. A dispute then developed between the militant factions as one of the groups calling itself Reformed Egbesu Boys of the Niger Delta unilaterally announced a ceasefire on 13 June. Although the group agreed with other groups over cessation of hostilities, it was opposed to demands regarding Kanu and Dasuki. A group calling itself the Niger Delta Red Squad declared its existence in late June 2016. The group claimed that it had blown up two pipelines belonging to Shell in the Asa/Awarra axis and also threatened to attack major oil pipelines in Oguta Council area, as well as shutdown all oil wells in Imo State. A few days later, another group calling itself Adaka Boro Avengers emerged, threatening to destroy oil producing facilities and warned all oil companies to leave the Niger Delta within a week In July, the group announced that it would declare an independent state on 1 August and warned all northern Nigerians to leave the region. It however abandoned its bid on the same day it was supposed to declare an independent state. A group calling itself Asawana Deadly Force of Niger Delta also emerged in late June 2016 and demanded independence for the region within a few days while threatening to shut down oil production in the region if it failed to achieve its goal. On 8 July, a new group called Niger Delta Revolutionary Crusaders (NDRC) bombed the Brass Creek Manifold in Bayelsa State. On 13 July, the group then declared a two-week ceasefire. On 1 August, the group released a statement in which it accused northern Nigerians of plotting to Islamisise the region in order to take control of its oil. After the new Boko Haram leader Abu Musab al-Barnawi threatened to increase attacks on Christians and destroy churches, the NDRC, on 6 August, threatened to kill Muslims and destroy mosques if Boko Haram carried out its threats. On 9 August, Niger Delta Greenland Justice Mandate declared its existence and threatened to destroy refineries in Port Harcourt and Warri within 48 hours, as well as a gas plant in Otu Jeremi within a few days. The next day, the group reportedly blew up a major oil pipeline operated by the Nigerian Petroleum Development Company (NPDC) in Isoko On 12 August, the group warned that it would blow up more oil installations in the future. On 19 August, the group was reported to have blown up two pipelines belonging to NPDC in Delta State. Ceasefire In late August 2016, the NDA declared a unilateral ceasefire and agreed to negotiations with the Nigerian government. After the declaration of a ceasefire by the Niger Delta Avengers, the Reformed Egbesu Fraternities comprising the three militants groups Egbesu Boys of the Niger Delta, Egbesu Red Water Lions and Egbesu Mightier Fraternity also announced a 60-day ceasefire. =Operation Crocodile Smile (August 2016-September 2016)= Nigeria's Army launched \\"Operation Crocodile Smile\\" in late August to get rid of all criminal activities in Niger Delta. On 26 September, five militants were killed in clashes while 23 were arrested. On 30 August, NDGJM blew up the Ogor-Oteri oil pipeline in the Delta state and declared the launch of \\"Operation Crocodile Tears\\" in response to the military's operation. On 1 September, the Nigerian Army captured Gabriel Ogbudje, a supposed ex-militant who they claimed had now become leader of a new militant group Otugas Fire Force. 14 oil workers and their driver on their way to Port Harcourt were kidnapped by unknown gunmen on 2 September after the vehicle transporting them was hijacked on Omoku-Elele road. On 4 September, NDGJM claimed it had rigged all the marked oil and gas facilities with explosives and warned residents living nearby to evacuate. Chief of Army Staff Tukur Yusuf Buratai officially launched the operation on 5 September. Niger Delta Avengers mocked the operation on 8 September claiming 20 soldiers were killed in it and also claimed that the Nigerian military was harassing citizens of Niger Delta. The operation concluded on 11 September. During the operation, 23 militants were killed while 38 militant camps, 91 illegal refineries and bunkering sites were destroyed during the operation. =Continued insurgency (September 2016-present)= The oil workers kidnapped in early September were released by 18 September after the police engaged in a shootout with the kidnappers. On 13 September, NDGJM stated they had blown up the Afiesere-Iwhrenene pipeline belonging to NPDC in Ughelli North. On 19 September, the group stated they had blown up a crude oil pipeline belonging to NPDC near Ekuigbo in Ughelli North. On 20 September, Abraham Suru, one of the suspected leaders of NDA was arrested. On 24 September, Niger Delta Avengers claimed they had blown up the Bonny pipeline. On 27 September, a militant group calling itself Niger Delta Volunteers (NDV) warned the government that it will cripple all its infrastructure that generated income, describing the bombing by Avengers on Bonny pipeline as a \\"child's play\\". It also warned oil companies to evacuate their staff and suspend their operations, adding that their next strike will be deadly. Meanwhile, Niger Delta Justice Defence Group (NDJDG) blew up an oil pipeline in Gokana. On 28 September, NDJDG warned Buhari that they will destroy any national asset he tries to sell. Meanwhile, a militant was killed in clashes between NDA and Imo Security Network in Owerri. On 29 September, NDGJM claimed it had blown up the Unenurhie-Evwreni pipeline belonging to the NPDC. On 9 November, Niger Delta Avengers said it was behind an attack on Shell's For√ßados crude pipeline a day earlier. Reactions MEND had condemned the ensuing militancy in its early days. However, by September it abandoned the negotiating position with the government and sought a unified voice for the Niger Delta, even proposing to work with the NDA. The NDA announced its intention for a declaration of independence on 1 October, which gained the support of IPOB despite the group saying it was unaffiliated with the former as Powerful said: \\"We have nothing to do with MEND, but our philosophy aligns with that of Niger Delta Avengers who bravely called for the release of our leader and had maintained it till date. Avengers and IPOB are one in pursuit of freedom for all the peoples of Biafra. IPOB is in total support of the proposed independence declaration proposed by Avengers on the 1st of October.\\" However, later IPOB and the Renegade Indigenous People of Biafra (RENIPOB), a faction from the Kanu-led IPOB, decided to re-unite and would surrender to the Nigerian government on 15 January 2017. As a consequence its intention for the burning of the flag of Biafra on 1 October was then replaced by an intention of surrender to the government. Following Kanu's arrest, IPOB spokesman, Comrade Emma Powerful said of Nigeria that it was a \\"contraption done by the former British colonialists which is no longer working, hence the quest of the Biafrans to opt out of the incompatible marriage ‚Äì the 1914 Amalgamation.\\"  See also   References  Nigerian Civil War Biafra History of Nigeria History of West Africa Civil wars post-1945 Ethnicity-based civil wars Separatist rebellion-based civil wars Wars involving Igboland Wars involving Nigeria Wars involving the states and peoples of Africa 2016 in Nigeria Conflicts in 2016 Attacks on energy sector ","title":"2016 Niger Delta conflict"},{"id":"51538654","text":"Miguel Rangel, O.F.M.

Established by Joseph W. Foster in 1900, the company was a pioneer in the use of track spikes for runners and athletes, producing most of the highly-regarded running shoes in the 1920s. J.W. Foster & Sons was absorbed by Reebok (a company established by Foster's sons) in 1976.  History  The company founder, Joseph William Foster, was born in 1881 and trained as a cobbler. At the age of 14 in 1895, as a member of the local harriers, he started work in his bedroom above his father's sweet shop in Bolton, and designed some of the earliest spiked running shoes. After his ideas progressed, he founded his business 'J.W. Foster' in 1900. Later he joined with his sons and changed the company name to \\"J.W. Foster and Sons\\" in 1910.\\"Brand History\\" at ShoeBacca.com(Archive)at reebokthefounder.com(Brand History) Foster opened a small factory called Olympic Works, and gradually became famous among athletes for his \\"running pumps\\". During the World War I, the company produced army boots (which production would be resumed by the company in the Second War). 1924 Olympic 100 m champion Harold Abrahams wearing J.W. Foster's pioneering running spikes For pioneering the use of spikes, the company's revolutionary running pumps appear in the book, Golden Kicks: The Shoes that changed Sport. The company began distributing shoes across the United Kingdom which were worn by British athletes, and were made famous by 100m Olympic champion Harold Abrahams (who would be immortalized in the Oscar winning film Chariots of Fire) in the 1924 Summer Olympics held in Paris. Joe died in 1933, 18 months before his second grandson was born in 1935 on his birthday, 18 May, a second Joseph William. The ‚ÄòFoster‚Äô company was continued by sons Billy and Jim, headed by Joe's wife Maria, who handed the business to Billy and Jim in 1939. Again war interrupted the business, but J W Foster & Sons picked up their business, with Derek Ibbotson breaking the Mile world record. Foster was also supplying most First Division (now Premiership) Football teams with trainers and signed a contract for distribution in the United States by Frank Ryan and Bob Geinjack, coaches at Yale University. Jeffrey William Foster (Jeff), Jim's first son, joined J. W. Foster in 1948 and Joseph (Joe) joined later in 1952. In 1953 National Service took first Joe and six months later Jeff for 2 years. On their return to J. W. Foster they saw a business failing to move forward, mainly due to the growth of rival manufacturers such as Adidas and Puma, which had successfully entered the market after the WW II. Requests to change went unheeded, so in November 1958 the brothers established their own company, Reebok, in Bury. Eighteen months after Joe and Jeff left J W Foster to set up their own company, Billy died at the age of 58. Jim carried on the business at Deane Road, until the ‚ÄòOlympic Works‚Äô made way for the new Bolton Technical College, which was later to become Bolton University. Jim moved J. W. Foster & Sons (Athletic Shoe) Ltd to the North of Bolton, opening as a Sports Shop. His business continued until his death in 1976, at which time the ownership transferred to Reebok. The J.W. Foster Tradition continues today as J W. Foster (Heritage) Ltd, with many items held on loan in the Reebok archive at the company's worldwide headquarters in Boston, Massachusetts.

Trombetas State Forest The Trombetas State Forest is divided between the municipalities of Oriximin√° (87.91%), √ìbidos (10.27%) and Alenquer (1.82%) in the state of Par√°. It has an area of . The western part of the state forest contains the Kaxuyana-Tunayana Indigenous Territory. The forest adjoins the Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station on its northern border. It adjoins the Trombetas/Mapuera Indigenous Territory to the west. It adjoins the Faro State Forest and Rio Trombetas Biological Reserve to the south. To the east it adjoins the Mulata National Forest, the Paru State Forest and the Zo'√© Indigenous Territory. Environment The state forest covers about 14% of the Northern Corridor of Par√°, which contains about of protected areas. This in turn is part of the Amap√° and Central Amaz√¥nia corridor, the largest biodiversity corridor in the world. The Trombetas River runs through the forest from north to south. The Paru de Oeste River (Erepecuru River) forms part of the eastern boundary, then cuts across the forest from north to south. Other rivers include the Cachorro and Cuminapanema. About 98.5% of the area is covered by well-preserved forests. Vegetation includes submontane, lowland and alluvial dense rainforest, open rainforest, cerrado, pioneer formations and transitional forest. The forest is home to thousands of species of animal and plant, many endemic to the region. Economy As of 2011 there were 106 families along the Trombetas, 102 families along the Cachorro and one or two families on the Ariramba, Cuminapanema and Rio Verde. About 241 non-residents make use of the forest. The main economic activity of the residents is collection of Brazil nuts. They also engage in subsistence agriculture and in raising cattle and buffalo. The cattle and buffalo present a threat to the environment, as does gold mining. There is potential for managed use of wood and non-wood forest products, ecotourism and environmental services. History The Trombetas State Forest was created by Par√° state governor decree 2.607 of 4 December 2006 for the purpose of sustainable multiple use of forest and environmental resources, managing the forest in a manner consistent with conserving biodiversity. The position of the traditional quilombola residents was regularised by giving them the right of use. The advisory council was created on 14 December 2009. The management plan was approved on 9 August 2011. On 7 May 2012 various state and non-state agencies (Par√° Secretariat of State of the Environment, Par√° Institute of Forest Development, Conservation International of Brasil, Institute of Man and the Environment of Amazonia ‚Äì Imazon and other) agreed to work together to support implementation, consolidation and management of the north Para conservation units, namely Gr√£o-Par√° Ecological Station, Maicuru Biological Reserve and the Faro, Trombetas and Paru state forests.

She began sweetgrass basket-weaving at a young age, and the tradition has been continued by her children and grandchildren. The art of sweetgrass basket-weaving is an important tradition in the Gullah culture and has been a prominent practice in communities brought over to the United States as early slaves. She was a recipient of a 1984 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.  Early life  Manigault was born in 1913 in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina to Solomon and Sally Coakley. She learned sweetgrass basket-weaving at a young age from her mother, saying \\"My mother taught me how to make baskets when I was eight years old\\".  Sweetgrass basket weaving  Photo of sweetgrass baskets Sweetgrass basket weaving is an art form that gained popularity among African-Americans living off the coast of the southeastern United States during the 17th century. Sweetgrass baskets were originally woven for the cultivation of rice. Europeans depended on the enslaved African's knowledge of agriculture to create specialized tools. As time passed, the uses for sweetgrass baskets pivoted from field use to a variety of other uses such as picnics, sewing baskets, church collection, laundry, and many more. Sweetgrass baskets often vary in design but regularly use materials such as bulrush, oak, hickory, and palmetto.  Career and legacy  Manigault was a successful basket-weaver at a young age, and ran a basket stand in 1962 on U.S. highway 17 just north of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. In the mid-1970s, Manigault moved her basket-weaving enterprise to Charleston's City Market. In the later years of her career, Manigault continued to weave magnificent baskets at her family home in Hamlin Beach. In 1984, Manigault was named a National Heritage Fellow by the National Endowment for the Arts. The award recognizes outstanding American folk artists. Mary Jane Manigault suffered a stroke in late 2000, but stated, \\"I'm going to keep making baskets, as long as I can\\". Manigault's sweetgrass baskets have been displayed in many museums, including the Sante Fe Folk Art Museum, the William Mathers Anthropology Museum at Indiana University, the American Museum of Natural History, the Cleveland Museum of Art, and McKissick Museum at the University of South Carolina. Mary Jane Manigault's children and grandchildren continue the tradition of making and selling sweetgrass baskets. Manigault's eldest daughter, Mary Jane Habersham, runs a basket stand on Highway 17 saying, \\"I will keep the tradition going on\\".  Death  Mary Jane Manigault died on November 8, 2010 in her Hamlin Beach home after suffering a seizure, at the age of 97. Manigault had been suffering from sporadic seizures for a year prior to her death and was hospitalized numerous times.

Established in 1783, it was later eclipsed by Randolph Village, which developed around the town's main railroad depot. The village now has a distinguished array of late 18th and early 19th-century architecture, and is home to an academic campus now housing the Vermont Technical College. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history The central Vermont town of Randolph was founded in 1783, with its civic center located on the crest of north-south ridge near the geographic center of the town. The ridge is traversed by Main Street (part of which is designated Vermont Route 66), and the village became an important stop on the stagecoach route between Boston, Massachusetts and Montreal. The village flourished, housing a number of industries, until the mid-19th century, when the Central Vermont Railroad was built further to the west. Since then, the economic and civic centers migrated to the area of the railroad depot, now known as Randolph Village. The center became more of a residential nexus, although it also benefited from the presence of an academic campus established in 1804. Originally housing the Randolph Academy, it is now home to the Vermont Technical College. with The historic district extends along Main Street, roughly from Furnace Street in the north to South Randolph Street in the south. The district is mainly residential in character with Federal and Greek Revival houses of wood and brick. Notable exceptions including the historic wood-frame dormitory (now used for other purposes) at the front of the Vermont Technical College Campus, most of which consists of modern buildings and is excluded. At the southern end of the district stand the Congregational Church (1798, restyled in 1838 into the Greek Revival and Gothic Revival), a former Methodist Church building (1881), and the 1903 community school building.

He was born in Troyes on 28 January 1562 and died on 12 May 1622 in Rome. Early years Born on 28 January 1562, he was one of the twelve children of Jehan Thomassin, a belt-maker, and Nicole Aubry. He was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Troyes in circa 1577.  Engraver in Rome  Philippe Thomassin is first documented in Rome in 1585. He initially worked for the French publishers Claude Duchet (Claudio Duchetti), Lorenzo Vaccari and Marcello Clodio.M.Bury, The Print in Italy 1550‚Äì1620, London, 2001, p. 234 He subsequently collaborated with Antonio Tempesta on the Vita et miracula Divi Bernardi Clarevalensis Abbatis which was published in 1587.  Association with Jean Turpin  In 1588 Thomassin married Barbara Unge. This marked the beginning of his association with the Parisian painter Jean Turpin, who had married Barbara‚Äôs sister. Together, their collaborative business activities included acquiring plates and republishing them, copying existing plates by others printmakers, such as those in the possession of Antonio Lafreri and Antonio Salamanca, and producing prints after contemporary paintings by artists including Federico Barocci.V. Pagani, ‚ÄòPhilippe Thomassin‚Äôs engraved plates after 1602‚Äô, Print Quarterly, XXXIII, September 2016, pp. 251. Thomassin was arrested in 1590 by the Holy Office on account of a portrait of the Protestant French king Henry IV of France which he had engraved.E. Bruwaert, Philippe Thomasin devant le tribunal de l‚Äôinquisition, Troyes, 1896 The death of Barbara on 29 June 1601, saw the break down of Thomassin‚Äôs relations with Turpin. A notarial deed dated 19 January 1602 formally dissolved their partnership, with terms that specified that Thomassin was to receive 500 scudi in exchange for giving Turpin a proportion of his share of their business, which, if the share given to Turpin was worth more than 500 scudi, was to be considered a gift from Thomassin.Pagani, op.cit., pp. 252‚Äì54 It has been estimated that circa 240 engraved plates passed into Turpin‚Äôs possession in January 1602: many of these were later to be sold to Callisto Ferrante.Pagani, op. cit., p. 254; Bruwaert, La vie et les ≈ìuvres de Philippe Thomassin, graveur Troyen 1562‚Äì1622, Troyes, 1914, p. 72.  Post 1602: Thomassin‚Äôs associations with Giulio Mancini  In the years following the termination of his relations with Turpin, Thomassin rebuilt up a stock of circa 250 engraved plates. These were left in his will to his second wife, Girolama Piscina, whom he married on 3 June 1602 and who, as inventories of the possessions of Girolama and her second husband Francesco Agazzi evince, was in possession of the engraved plates in June 1627.Pagani, op.cit., pp. 254‚Äì60, Appendices 1 & 2, pp. 260‚Äì62. The plates ultimately passed into the possession of the de‚Äô Rossi publishing family.F. Consagra, The De‚Äô Rossi Family Print Publishing Shop: A Study in the History of the Print Industry in Sixteenth-Century Rome, Baltimore, MD, 1993, Appendix 3, passim. In addition to issuing prints after the work of contemporary artists, Thomassin also engraved plates after artists from the preceding centuries including Raphael, Parmigianino, Francesco Salviati and Giorgio Vasari. The decision to produce prints after these earlier Tuscan and Northern-Italian artists was motivated by Thomassin‚Äôs involvement with the Sienese art collector and dealer, Giulio Mancini (1559‚Äì1630).J. Gabarelli, ‚ÄòPhilippe Thomassin and Giulio Mancini‚Äôs Art Collection‚Äô, Print Quarterly, XXXII, December 2015, pp. 380‚Äì94. Mancini was present in Rome from 1592 and Thomassin is referred to in Mancini‚Äôs correspondence with his brother Deifebo Mancini on 25 September 1609, in reference to a sottocoppa (or metal wine dish) that was to be engraved by Thomassin following a design by Guido Reni.Gabarelli, op.cit., pp. 380‚Äì81. In the following six years, Thomassin continued to issue prints after drawings and paintings in Mancini‚Äôs collection, including Parmigianino‚Äôs The Virgin and Child in 1611, Vasari's Immaculate Conception in 1611‚Äì12, Zuccari‚Äôs The Adoration of the Magi in 1613 and Francesco Salviati‚Äôs The Baptism of Christ in 1615.Gabarelli, op.cit., pp. 386‚Äì93. Jamie Gabarelli has pointed out that the relationship between Thomassin and Mancini was one based not only on a professional interaction but also one based on reciprocal favours, and the resulting engravings represent the earliest group of engravings to be based on works owned or handled by a single collector.Gabarelli, op.cit., pp. 386‚Äì93. Between 1608 and 1611/1612 Jacques Callot was present in Thomassin‚Äôs workshop, where he was tasked with engraving prints after well known paintings: a commercial practice which offered a steady source of income.

Usually, Blue Ben dwells in the shale caves along the Somerset coast, regularly bathing in the nearby waters in order to cool himself after breathing fire. In order to avoid getting stuck in the extensive mud flats between the water and his lair, he built the limestone causeway there to provide him safe passage. The Devil, who had watched Blue Ben for some time, decided to capture him for use as a mount. The Devil rode the dragon mercilessly through the fires of Hell until the dragon escaped. Hurrying to get back to the security of his lair, Blue Ben made the mistake of tramping through the mud flats. He got stuck in the mud, which consumed him. An alternative version of the story says that he lived inland but went to Kilve to cool off.

From 1905 to 1919 he was the senior mathematics master at Jarrow-on-Tyne, Secondary School. In 1910 in conversation, R. A. Sampson suggested that Goldsbrough should do research on the theory of tides and gravitational astronomy. At Armstrong College, Goldsbrough was appointed in 1910 Lecturer in Applied Mathematics, in 1922 Reader in Dynamical Astronomy, and in 1928 Second Professor of Mathematics. (In 1937 Armstrong College became part of King's College, Durham.) At King's College, as the successor to T. H. Havelock, he became in 1942 Head of the Department of Mathematics and remained so until his retirement in 1948.

After peace was restored he enrolled in the University of Belgrade to study medicine, before transferring to the newly founded University of Sarajevo where he earned his degree in 1953. He completed his specialization in Nephrology three years later. Medical career He was granted an internship in Banja Luka after which he moved back to his home town where he was named director of the local health center, which he ran until 1966. He was next transferred to Mostar and appointed director of the Social Insurance Institute before finally being appointed Minister of health in the government of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina. After his mandate expired he was named director of the Sarajevo Health Center.

Alexandru DepƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu was a Romanian poet, politician and playwright. Born in Ro»ôiorii de Vede, his parents were Petru DepƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu and his wife Elisabeta (n√©e Altanl√¢u). He studied in his native town and at Bucharest's Saint Sava College, after which he went to the University of Paris from 1856 to 1858, without earning a degree. From 1860 to 1865, DepƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu was deputy prefect of Teleorman and T√¢rgului plƒÉ»ôi, and in 1864 was a deputy to the Legislative Chamber. DepƒÉrƒÉ»õeanu's contributions appeared in Buciumul, Seculul and Na»õionalul. Two books of his poetry were published in 1861: Ciocoii vechi »ôi ciocoii noi and Doruri »ôi amoruri. These were followed by his 1864 historical drama Grigorie VodƒÉ ‚Äì domnul Moldovei. Among the first translators from Spanish to Romanian, he worked with a few romancero texts, finding convincing equivalent terms. His poetry bears all the marks of a transitional era and suffers from the lexical uncertainties of a language under the impact of French influence. Nevertheless, pre-Eminescian and even pre-Symbolist tones are dimly perceptible. As a playwright (aside from the 1864 work, he wrote a comedy in 1852, Don GulicƒÉ sau pantofiorii miraculo»ôi, that was published posthumously), he shows sufficient talent for creating scenes, even managing beautiful sequences in the Romance drama style.

The group currently has a presence in 81 countries and is one of the largest business groups in northern Spain. With 58 years in the market, the group is part of the Industrial Division of the Mondragon Corporation. History XXXI International Fair of Barcelona,1963 The origins of the ULMA Group date back to the early sixties and the creation of two separate cooperatives. The first was created in 1961 by six young mechanics following several meetings with Jos√© Mar√≠a Arizmendiarrieta, the local priest in Mondrag√≥n (Gipuzkoa) and the driving force behind what is today known as Mondragon. They decided to set up a cooperative called ULMA S.C.I. to provide ancillary services to the chocolate industry and later on entered the construction sector. At the same time and in the same region, four workers from the Forjas de Zubillaga (Zubillaga Forge) company decided to acquire a locksmith and accessories workshop. Both companies grew and established close ties during the late seventies and eighties and finally created the actual group in 1987 with the addition of Oinakar, a third cooperative that sold forklift trucks. The group was first named O√±alan and it's been called ULMA Group since 1989. In 1993, as a result of the decision to have its own cooperative group, ULMA decided not to take part in the organisational restructuring proposed by the Mondragon Cooperative Corporation (MCC). In 2002, however, its members approved the group joining the Industrial Division of Mondragon, of which it still forms a part. Current situation In 2015, 4,396 people worked for the Group, which recorded a turnover of EUR 716.4 million, of which around 80% was accounted for by international sales. Although all the cooperatives share general policies and management strategies, each one produces, rents, manufactures or markets its own products. Since every cooperative has its own products, Ulma Group has all sort of projects in different countries, from Greenhouses in the Middle East desert (ULMA Agr√≠cola) to Skyscrapers in New York (ULMA Construction) or drainage channels in different buildings and stadiums around the world. Social responsibility Most of ULMA Group‚Äôs social responsibility is carried out through the ULMA Foundation. It was established in 2010 and supports projects with a social purpose which are financed with 10% of the group's profits.

After numerous acts of criminality in concert with other Midlands landowners, he became a member of the Lancastrian affinity centred on John of Gaunt and a supporter of Henry IV. He fought in two campaigns of the Hundred Years War but his violence and lawlessness continued and he was decidedly out of favour during the reign of Henry V. With power less concentrated in the early years of Henry VI, he was able to serve three terms as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests and to wield considerable power and influence. He represented Derbyshire no less than nine times and Warwickshire twice in the House of Commons of England. Background =Ancestry= Effigies of John and Edmund Cokayne, Sir John's father and grandfather, in Asbourne parish church. John Cokayne was the eldest son of :*Edmund Cockayne (died 1403) of Ashbourne Hall Ashbourne, Derbyshire. :*Elizabeth Harthill (died 1416), daughter of Sir Richard Herthil or Harthill (died 1390) of Pooley Hall, near Polesworth, Warwickshire. The Cockayne family are known to have lived at Ashbourne from the mid-12th century.Gentleman's Magazine, volume 215, p. 224. The Derbyshire historian Stephen Glover wrote that the Cockaynes \\"resided and flourished for many generations in this town, and had considerable estates in the county, much increased by a match with the heiress of Herthill.\\"Glover, p. 32. His mother's patrimony was to be an important factor in the prominence Sir John Cockayne assumed in his county's affairs, although he did not gain full control of it until after his mother's death. However, the family were already wealthy before the Harthill inheritance, although it has been pointed out that they suffered over several generations from \\"reduced family income due to the longevity of dowagers,\\"Wright, p. 9. which led to Edmund and his brother John not being knighted in their youth. The Cokaynes gained considerable advantage over many decades from a close connection with the Duchy of Lancaster, especially under Edward III's son, John of Gaunt. Sir John's grandfather, also Sir John, had been joint custodian with Henry de Haydock of the Duchy lands north of the River Trent under Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, including several important estates in LancashireJohn of Gaunt's Register, volume 2, p. 347, no. 1799. and Staffordshire,John of Gaunt's Register, volume 2, p. 349, no. 1801. and he was responsible for them during the transition to Gaunt's control. =Confusions of identity= As his family were unimaginative in their choice of personal names, Sir John Cokayne is often confused with others of the same name. Footnote 1. Sir John was confused by GloverGlover, p. 34. with his uncle Sir John Cokayne (died 1429), appointed an executor by John of Gaunt as \\"chief seneschall de mes terres et possessions,\\"Armitage-Smith (1905), p. 430-1 the post held previously by his father. It was this uncle who was a distinguished lawyer and it was he, not Sir John Cokayne of Ashbourne, who was Chief Baron of the Exchequer throughout the reign of Henry IV,Foss, p. 303-4. as well as Justice of the Common Pleas from 1406 until 1429, the year of his death. The Chancery rolls have numerous references to him, as he was a very active judge and administrator for several decades. Sometimes he is distinguished from his nephew as John Cokayne the Elder. Glover's confusion arose from his belief that uncle John died in 1403 at the Battle of Shrewsbury, thus leaving his later career unattributable. It was his brother Edmund, Sir John's father, who died in the battle. Sir John Cockayne's eldest son, also named John and also knighted, is also sometimes confused with him. The problem of identification is considerable, as the son died before his father (dvp or decessit vita patris in genealogical records), so their careers overlap for some decades with no clear chronological span for the younger Sir John to occupy as head of the family. Moreover, Sir John had a second son called Sir John by a different wife, with further confusion. Early career =Armed marauder= Richard II of England. Sir John Cokayne first appearance in the history of his region was as a bandit leader in the reign of Richard II. On 26 February 1388, while John of Gaunt was abroad and the Lords Appellant, including Gaunt's son, Henry Bolingbroke, were at the height of their power, Cockayne's name headed the list of a group of young landed gentry accused of \\"divers enormous offences in the county of Derby, against the ministers, officers and servants of the king's uncle John, duke of Lancaster.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1385‚Äì1389, p. 463. It was alleged that they had set an ambush to kill Gaunt's officials. A substantial party of Midlands landowners, headed by Robert de Ferrers, 5th Baron Ferrers of Chartley, was deputed to bring Cockayne and his gang to justice. Among the posse were Sir Walter Blount, a justice of the peace, a veteran of Gaunt's campaigns and his main representative in the region,Roskell et al. Members BLOUNT, Sir Walter (d.1403), of Barton Blount, Derbys. ‚Äì Author: C.R. John Ipstones and Thomas Beek, both rewarded by Gaunt for their service in his campaign for the Crown of Castile.Walker, p. 225. Ipstones had a reputation for violence and had besieged Blount's home with an armed band the previous year during a dispute over a bond that Blount had taken from John Moston, a tenant of Ipstones.Walker, p. 221. This internecine warfare among Gaunt's affinity was a principal part of the wave of violence afflicting the north Midlands,Walker, p. 222. a major embarrassment for Gaunt, who had been arguing in parliament that the great lords' affinities were a force for order.Walker, p. 228. Cokayne's main disruptive activity seems to have been breaking into Gaunt's enclosures. Despite his family links with Gaunt, Cockayne was not at this time part of the duke's affinity: Simon Walker, the historian of the affinity, found no clear evidence of that before 1398,Walker, p. 267. the year of Gaunt's death. The commission to arrest him named nine accomplices and he was said to have a retinue of twenty. However, he soon made friends with some of the very Lancastrian affinity members who had been commissioned to arrest him. Ipstones had long been involved in a complex dispute over lands at Tean, Staffordshire, and Hopton, Shropshire, which he claimed by right of his mother. The other claimant, Maud Swynnerton, a cousin, was still a child in 1381 when Ipstones seized the manors with the help of Richard Thornbury and John Wollaston.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 13, p. 169. Ipstones seems to have quarrelled with Thornbury, his chief accomplice, as he was granted a pardon for his murder on 13 November 1387.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1385‚Äì1389, p. 366. Cokayne was one of those whom he recruited to fill the gaps in his own entourage. Maud continued to uphold her side in the property dispute and, now a widow, was living with Joan Peshale, her mother-in-law, at La Mote, a house within Chetwynd Park in Shropshire. Cokayne joined Ipstones and Beek in abducting Maud from Chetwynd in December 1388. They were said to be \\"armed as for war,\\"Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 16, p. 28. but stole a collection of additional weapons as they took Maud, who was forced to marry William Ipstones, Sir John's son, and made to renounce her claim to the disputed estates. However, Joan Peshale pursued the matter through the courts, alleging that the gang had entered her manor by scaling the walls with ladders, threatened her and her tenants, attacked her servants and abducted a maidservant called Alice Costeyne as well as Maud. Property losses were put at ¬£100.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1388‚Äì1392, p. 339-40. Cokayne was prominently named in all the allegations as well as in the gaol delivery made at Shrewsbury Castle when they were committed for trial in 1390. However, they were acquitted by the jury, probably because of intimidation. =Pious purposes= In 1392 Cokayne was party to an important donation intended to fund a chantry at St Oswald's Church, Ashbourne. On 18 March he, together with John Kniveton, Roger Bradbourne and Richard Cokayne, granted rents worth 100 shillings a year from the manor of Mercaston to William Hyde, the church's chaplain.Jeays (ed). Descriptive Catalogue of Derbyshire Charters, p. 210-11, no. 1693. In this, they were acting as feoffees for Nicholas Kniveton and the purpose of the chantry was to pray for the souls of the Kniveton family, who were probably relatives of the Cokaynes. Cokayne was involved in the process over some time, as he had witnessed the transfer by feoffees of the Mercaston estate to Johanna, the widow of Nicholas Kniveton, in June 1391.Jeays (ed). Descriptive Catalogue of Derbyshire Charters, p. 210, no. 1692. As was customary, the souls of others concerned in the grant were included, and in this case John, Duke of Aquitaine and Lancaster was named, as the manor was held of him, together with John Sheppey, the Dean of Lincoln, who confirmed the grant. Hyde paid ¬£20 for the licence to accept the alienation in mortmain of the rents,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 138. a costly privilege because the property passed thereby outside the land market and beyond most royal taxation. With reference to a later donation to set up a chantry at Ashbourne for the Bradbourne family, the local historian Susan Wright comments on the peculiar \\"intensity of relations, including much intermarriage, among those families with manors between the Dove valley and Derby in the Peak foothills\\" which was both celebrated and created through such rituals.Wright, p. 58. =Responsibility and criminality= Cokayne now began to acquire a degree of influence and recognition in Deryshire society. In March 1392 he received a commission of array.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 93. In February 1393 he received a commission of arrest to pursue a fugitive in a case brought to attention by his uncle John.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 237. Rituals of social solidarity and political responsibility did not make Cokayne markedly less inclined to consort with criminals. In May John Cokayn, probably the uncle, obtained a pardon for a man involved in a rampage of housebreaking and murder at Ashbourne.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 267. Although there is no suggestion in the text that Sir John himself was present on this occasion, the list of those involvedCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1391‚Äì1396, p. 268. overlaps substantially with that of his cronies who had terrorised the area in 1388, including Edmund Harthill, presumably a cousin. Moreover, when Sir John was returned to Parliament for the first time in 1395, he had another indictment for felony hanging over him. While he was at Westminster he had the case transferred to Derbyshire by a writ of nisi prius, which covered also Thomas Lache and William Walsh, both of Normanton,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1392‚Äì1396, p. 328. presumably his accomplices. The other knight of the shire in 1395 was Peter Melbourne or Fauconer, a one-time MP who was a close and devoted adherent of Gaunt. It was rare for the Derbyshire gentry to send two inexperienced men to Parliament: generally at least one would have served before. The dangers of Cokayne's political position must have been apparent to him, not least because of the fate of his close friend Ipstones, murdered while in London for the 1394 Parliament by Roger Swynnerton, a relative of Maud.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399, p. 143. Moreover, the murderer was pardoned in 1397 after an intervention by Baldwin Raddington, controller of the king's wardrobe. Cokayne was clearly not trusted by the king, Richard II, and the Court party: after his brief period of respectability, he received no commissions after 1393. The Ipstones property dispute had wider resonances in the competition between magnates in the region. The Peshales, Maud's in-laws were clients of the Earls of Stafford, as was Ipstones until 1381, when hostilities broke out between them. Gaunt had intervened to get Sir John Holland restored to favour after he murdered the son of Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford in 1386, bringing about a deterioration in relations between the two magnates. Stafford had great influence in his own countyWalker, p. 212. and his reach came very close to Cokayne's home territory around Dovedale. Cokayne faced the same toxic combination of local infamy, official indifference and magnate hostility that encompassed the death of Ipstones. Lancastrian power was much more dominant in Derbyshire than in Staffordshire,Walker, p. 210-11. making Gaunt a realistic protector for its gentry. Arms of John of Gaunt, asserting his kingship over Castile and Le√≥n, as well as his English and French connections. However, there is some confusion about Cokayne's developing relations with Gaunt and his affinity. Simon Walker cites him as an example of Gaunt's success in co- opting unruly gentry into the status quo, as he progressed \\"from breaker of the duke's chases in 1388 to chief steward of the North Parts of his duchy by 1398.\\" The History of Parliament is certain that the latter post was actually occupied by uncle John Cokayne, not Sir John. Moreover, Walker's own listing of Gaunt's officials names \\"John Cokayn,\\" without mention of knighthood,Walker, p. 286. as chief steward of the North Parts on 4 March 1398 ‚Äì in line with Gaunt's will, which generally uses titles as appropriate but names his executor and seneschal simply as \\"Johan Cokeyn.\\" It seems therefore that Sir John himself had in 1398 become simply one of the Lancastrian affinity, with an annuity of 20 marks, drawn on the manor of Daventry. Even this is not attested before that year, although the arrangement may go back some years earlier. Uncle John, however, had progressed to the highest levels in the service of Gaunt and had also made a considerable name for himself in the capital as a lawyer, becoming Recorder of London in 1394 and serjeant-at- law in 1396.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1396‚Äì1399, p. 28. His success can only have smoothed the way for his nephew. Both were left in an exposed position when Gaunt died and Sir John bought a pardon in 1398, probably because of his association with Bolingbroke, Gaunt's exiled heir. Lancastrian dominance =Royal favour= Henry of Bolingbroke claims the throne, 1399. After Bolingbroke was deprived of his inheritance of the Duchy of Lancaster in March 1399 by the disqualification of his attorneys,Jacob, p. 1. he gathered an invasion force and landed in July at Ravenspurn in Holderness. This was apparently chosen for its convenience in meeting and mobilising the Lancastrian affinity and network of duchy officials,Jacob, p. 2. who played a major part in bringing the Midlands over to his side. So close was the link between Derbyshire and the House of Lancaster that a third of the Derbyshire MPs of the period were actually in attendance when Bolingbroke landed. It seems that Sir John Cokayne, like his uncle, was a trusted supporter of the uprising and of the new r√©gime from the outset and he must have provided notable services during the seizure of power to be rewarded as he was. After Bolingbroke's accession to the throne as Henry IV, Cokayne was recognised as one of the king's bachelors. His annuity of 20 marks as a Lancastrian retainer was paid for a further year and in October 1400 replaced by one of ¬£60 drawn on Ashbourne, his home town. The sense that he was already the most representative member of the family was reinforced by the practice of naming the distinguished lawyer \\"uncle\\" in official documents.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 91. Both uncle and knight received the commission of array for Derbyshire, a key military appointment, in December 1399.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 213. Although he had not yet inherited the family estates, it was Sir John, not his father, who was called to attend great councils of the realm early in the reign.Proceedings and Ordinances of the Privy Council, volume 2, p. 88. On 16 May 1401 he was at last made a justice of the peace for Derbyshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1399‚Äì1401, p. 557-8. On 11 May 1402 Cokayne was one of the Derbyshire notables commissioned to combat propaganda against Henry IV.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 129. The commissioners were to argue publicly that the king was committed to the \\"common wealth and laws and customs of the realm\\" and to take action against those \\"preaching among other things that the king has not kept the promises he made at his advent into the realm and at his coronation.\\"Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 126. Cokayne was returned by the county to the 1402 Parliament with Roger Leche, a Derbyshire Lancastrian who had also been called to the councils and was favoured by both the king and Henry, Prince of Wales. The pair's claim for expenses of ¬£26 to cover 65 days' service was authorised on 25 November.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1402‚Äì1405, p. 125. With his father's death, fighting for the king at the Battle of Shrewsbury on 21 July 1403, Sir John came into his patrimony. In September his commission of array for Shropshire was renewed, along with his uncle's,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 287. and his commission of the peace was renewed twice in 1404, in March from Westminster and in November from Coventry.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 516. St. Mary's Priory in Coventry was the location that month of a Michaelmas Parliament, the second of that year because of royal financial demands,Jacob, p. 74. known as the Parliamentum Indoctorum or Unlearned Parliament. This was attended as representatives for Derbyshire by Cokayne and Roger Bradbourne, a Lancastrian who had fought under Gaunt in Spain and welcomed Bolingbroke at Ravenspurn but was not apparently a paid part of the Lancastrian retinue. The two members claimed expenses totalling ¬£16 for 40 days' service, authorised by a writ issued on 12 November.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1402‚Äì1405, p. 520. During the parliament Cokayne was accused by a group of four feoffees of violently seizing the manor of Baddesley Ensor in Warwickshire.Rotuli Parliamentorum, volume 3, p. 560. The accusers included figures of the greatest importance in the realm: Lawrence Allerthorpe, a former Lord High Treasurer,Jacob, p. 75-6. William Gascoigne, the Chief Justice,Foss, p. 165. Robert Waterton, one of a long-serving family of Lancastrian retainersWalker, p. 284. who held the key manor and castle of Pontefract for the dynasty and had played a key part in Bolingbroke's return to England, and John West. They claimed that Cokayne had entered the manor with \\"deux centz gentz arraiez a faire de guerre\\", that is to say, \\"200 men dressed for warfare\\".Rotuli Parliamentorum, volume 3, p. 561. The king ordered him to appear before his council at Westminster the following May. The Harthill family had held land at Baddesley Ensor since the late 13th century, Note anchor 17. when Richard de Hertewell, still a minor, is mentioned as an heir to Thomas de Edensor, the previous and eponymous lord of the manor.Calendar of Fine Rolls, 1272‚Äì1307, p. 219. Sir Richard Harthill, Cokayne's maternal grandfather, made various settlements of land at the manor, some of them slightly mysterious,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1381‚Äì1385, p. 623. before his death. Secondary sources appear to minimise the issue. The History of Parliament avers that Sir John escaped punishment because of the \\"proven validity of his claim to the property, which his mother had recently inherited,\\" while the Victoria County History maintains that he \\"may merely have been too previous in his entry, as in 1417 Elizabeth, widow of Edmund Cokayn, daughter and heir of Richard de Herthill, released to John Cokayn, her son, all right in the manor.\\" Note anchor 29. The manor formed part of the patrimony of Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, and was retained by her throughout her lifetime. She did not voluntarily release it to Sir John: 1417, when it was quitclaimed to her son with the rest of her estates,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1413‚Äì1419, p. 427. was the year after her death. It is unclear whether Sir John was acting in his own or his mother's interests, but past behaviour shows that he was not averse to using armed force to dispossess women. If he had a right to the property, it is unclear why he needed to use an armed force of 200 to occupy it. Clearly he did not prevail, even if he did avoid punishment, as the manor did not fall into his hands for more than decade. =Military service= Cokayne now found it prudent to enlist with the king's son, Thomas of Lancaster for military operations in the English Channel. This was during a lull in the Hundred Years' War, without major warfare between England and France, but with both sides sponsoring proxies. The French monarchy supported the Glynd≈µr Rising and aristocratic plotting, the so-called Tripartite Indenture, as well as privateering to destabilise Henry IV.Jacob, p. 54-8. The king appointed his son admiralCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 496. and large ships were requisitionedCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1401‚Äì1405, p. 512. and in April Cokayne obtained letters of protection to embark, probably on this occasion taking with him a party of 12 archers.Yeatman, p. 138. The following year Cokayne again served under Thomas of Lancaster, who on 17 March 1406 was made responsible for operations to intercept rebels who were travelling across the North of England to link up with Owain Glynd≈µr in Wales. It was alleged many were doing this, pretending to be on their way to join the forces led by the Prince of Wales.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 229. In Derbyshire Cokayne who was one of the Lancastrian knights commissioned to aid Thomas, along with the bailiffs of Derby. =Power struggles and imprisonment= Although Cokayne received the commission of the peace in January 1406,Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1405‚Äì1408, p. 490. it was not renewed the following year and he was not to serve as a JP again for a decade. However, he was still called upon to enforce the law where armed force might be necessary. In October 1408 he was sent to support the sheriff, Thomas Foljambe, in restoring order at Chesterfield, where a group of tradesmen were refusing to accept the authority of the town's bailiff and of the bailiff of Joan, the widow of Thomas Holland, 3rd Earl of Kent.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1408‚Äì1413, p. 63. In April 1410 he was commissioned with other gentry to arrest Henry Pierrepont, a turbulent landowner with interests at Chesterfield and in Nottinghamshire. Pierrepont was a close associate of Roger Leche, another Chesterfield landowner, and it seems that the bonds of locality and kinship in that part of Derbyshire now began to work against Cokayne. Cokayne was involved in a series of disorders over the succeeding years. In August 1410 he gathered an armed force of 200 around his home at Ashbourne. He claimed later, when obtaining a pardon the cover the events, that he had received reports of a plot against his life and that Roger Leche was on his way with an armed band to kill him.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 17, p. 28. The precise reasons for the distrust between the two men are obscure. Leche had been chamberlain to Bolingbroke as Earl of Derby and had succeeded another Derbyshire man, John Curzon of Kedleston, as steward of the main Lancastrian stronghold in the region, Tutbury Castle.Wright, p. 84,] He had become particularly close to the Prince of Wales, acting as steward of his household. He had a history of turning up with armed supporters when involved in what were supposed to be peaceful occasions. It is likely that some kind of personal enmity had developed between him and Cokayne. However, his loyalty to the Prince of Wales placed him on the opposite side of a political divide that had opened up within the House of Lancaster and among its supporters. It had become apparent in the parliament of 1410, which insisted on the king appointing to his council \\"the most valiant, wise and discreet lords of the realm.\\" This was coded support for the active policies favoured by the Prince, frustrated by his experiences as captain of Calais, and his closest confidants, his uncles Sir Thomas Beaufort, the Chancellor and Henry Beaufort, the Bishop of Winchester. This contrasted with a more cautious approach in the council, associated with Archbishop Thomas Arundel and the Prince's brother, Thomas of Lancaster.Jacob, p. 103-6. Cokayne had apparently chosen several times to serve under Thomas and was to do so again. The quarrel between Leche and Cokayne seems to have been prolonged and dangerous to the peace. On 24 October 1411 the king's council issued orders for the Constable of the Tower or his lieutenant to receive Cokayne into custody, together with several other Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire knights.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1409‚Äì1413, p. 243. Cokayne's imprisonment coincided with apparent triumph of the faction headed by the Beauforts and the Prince and their policy of engagement in the Armagnac‚ÄìBurgundian Civil War. Only two days earlier an English expedition had accompanied John the Fearless, the Duke of Burgundy, in taking Paris.Jacob, p. 111. However, it is unlikely Cokayne was the victim of a political purge, as Leche was included with him in the round-up. Neither headed the list: rather it was Thomas Chaworth, who had been involved in a violent feud with Sir Walter Tailboys. Then came Richard Stanhope and John Zouche, who had a bitter property dispute of their own, which also involved John Leek, who completed the list. John Finderne was added by a separate letter. The imprisoned knights may all have been involved in the quarrel between Cokayne and Leche or the internecine Lancastrian rivalries but the principle of selection may simply have been one of removing gentry miscreants temporarily from the region. On 6 November the constable was informed of arrangements for the trial of the imprisoned menCalendar of Close Rolls, 1409‚Äì1413, p. 244. and not until 30 November, after they had been kept out of circulation for more than five weeks, was their release ordered.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1409‚Äì1413, p. 261. =Service in France= While Cokayne and the other knights were still in the Tower of London, the king initiated a quiet coup to remove his opponents from power. On 11 November he made Thomas of Lancaster head of his council in place of the Prince of Wales and, with the acquiescence of the Michaelmas parliament, went on to remove Thomas Beaufort as chancellor, replacing him with Arundel, his predecessor.Jacob, p. 112. This led to a reversal of foreign policy and in 1412 Cokayne went to France with a force led by Thomas of Lancaster, now Duke of Clarence, in pursuance of an accord made at Bourges with the Armagnac faction: an expedition that paid the knights 2 shillings per day.Jacob, p. 114. Before departure he made a will at Pooley, placing the manor of Middleton-by-Wirksworth in the hands of feoffees for the use of his daughter, Alice. He also appointed Sir John Dabrichecourt a feoffee for his interest in the manor of Baddesley Ensor, with the aim of raising a sum towards the marriage of his younger daughter Elyn.Cockayne Memoranda, volume 1, p. 19. Any residue he hoped would be devoted to chantries for his family at Polesworth and Ashbourne.Cockayne Memoranda, volume 1, p. 20. He probably served in central France and Aquitaine until the death of Henry IV, when Clarence returned to England, after the French factions made temporary peace among themselves and bought off the English. =Continuing feuds= Henry V. The new reign apparently brought little change in Cokayne's involvement with local and regional disputes. At Michaelmas 1414 the sheriff was ordered to produce Cokayne, John Blount, the prior of Gresley Priory and 50 others, at the following Trinity sessions in Derby to answer charges of \\"divers extortions, conspiracies and insurrections,\\"Collections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 17, p. 25. However, at Stafford he was named as arbitratorCollections for a History of Staffordshire, vol. 17, p. 51. in a convoluted and bitter quarrel between Hugh Erdeswyk, recently MP for Staffordshire, and Edmund de Ferrers, 6th Baron Ferrers of Chartley. Probably originating as a property dispute, this had become a contest for local hegemony, involving the Peshales. Cokayne was nominated by Erdeswyk: at this point Ferrers was demanding forfeit of a bond for 500 marks. Neither Ferrers nor Erdeswyk ultimately suffered any great loss. Early in 1415 Cokayne himself appeared in court at Derby in connection with his 1410 dispute with Leche, but was able to produce a general pardon he had purchased. Cokayne received few commissions under Henry V, although they did include the important commissions of array for Warwickshire in May 1418Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1416‚Äì1422, p. 198. and March 1419.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1416‚Äì1422, p. 212. He is not known to have played a part in Henry V's campaigns in France, although his son, also John, did serve in France under Richard Grey, 4th Baron Grey of Codnor. Instead he continued his private local warfare. In August 1419 he used armed force to seize manors on the Derbyshire-Leicestershire border belonging to John Finderne, including Stretton en le Field.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1419‚Äì1422, p. 23-4. Finderne had acted as a lawyer for the Duchy of Lancaster and it appears that Cokayne was now making a habit of harassing its local officials. Under examination by the king's council, he claimed that he and others had an interest in Stretton, but the local coroner was ordered to return it to Finderne's control. By the time the Stretton dispute was settled in December 1419, Cokayne had attended his fourth parliament for Derbyshire. He was also elected for the next three, alternating between Derbyshire and Warwickshire, where he was now a major landowner following his mother's death. At the 1419 parliament he made mainprise for Dame Eleanor Dagworth.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1419‚Äì1422, p. 65. She was involved in disputes because of the treason of Sir John Mortimer, her second husband, who upheld the claim of Edmund Mortimer, 5th Earl of March to the throne.Cobbett's State Trials, volume 1, p. 267-8, no. 21. The list of mainpernours was illustrious, including the soldier Sir Thomas Erpingham and John Pelham, a member of the king's council, as well as the Staffordshire MP and Derbyshire landowner Sir Richard Vernon. Mortimer was to be executed in 1424, not directly for treason but for escaping from custody. Later career =Networks of power= During the minority of Henry VI Cokayne emerged very quickly from the disfavour of Henry V's reign and was able to achieve considerable influence by exploiting his relationships with those powerful at the centre and in his locality. In December 1422 he was one of a team of local gentry commissioned to investigate breaches of the laws restricting the taking of salmon and lampreys, particularly the young fish, from the River Trent.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1422‚Äì1429, p. 35. As early as February 1423 he was appointed Sheriff, a post shared between Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire and most often occupied by a Nottinghamshire man.Wright, p. 110. This was an onerous and expensive honour, but it gave considerable influence, particularly in returning MPs and determining the composition of juries. Cokayne held the shrievalty again for an unusually extended period from November 1428 to February 1430 and during 1435. Similarly, he soon became a JP again in Derbyshire, commissioned on 7 July 1423, while serving as sheriff.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1422‚Äì1429, p. 561. This was renewed in July 1424 and May 1425, the latter commission lasting until July 1429. After a break, he was made a JP for Derbyshire again in June 1431Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 615. and remained so for the rest of his life. He was also commissioner of array for Derbyshire in 1427.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1422‚Äì1429, p. 405. Cokayne was now a wealthy man, with estates valued at ¬£200 in 1436, although he lent only ¬£19 13s. 4d. to the king for prosecution of the war effort in 1430.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 61. He was one of those commissioned to promote the loan in Derbyshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 50. The only other contribution from the shire was 20 marks from Sir Nicholas Montgomery, who was much less wealthy than Sir John but seems to have felt he must set an example, as he had been commissioned to solicit loans in neighbouring Staffordshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 51. Cokayne's new patron Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell had also been commissioned to raise funds in Derbyshire but his contribution was returned under Lincolnshire, where headed the list with nearly ¬£6000. The Duchy of Lancaster, like the Crown, was no longer a distinct force in Derbyshire, so the immensely rich Cromwell, with a base in the east of the county, was a useful counterweight to the power of the Greys and Staffords.Wright, p. 70, 114-5. Cromwell was a prominent member of the royal household and one of the dominant small nucleus in the council.Jacob, p. 435. Cokayne allowed himself to be drawn into the complex property deals and lawsuits of Cromwell and his circle. One of Cokayne's services was to pledge support for Cromwell's prosecution of John Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, over his claim to the manor of Crich in Derbyshire.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 292. This took place in 1430 but is known from a long and complicated exemplification obtained by Cromwell in 1433, which shows the breadth of his dealings in the region, with numerous Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire estates claimed by himself or his representatives. Cromwell had obtained judgement against Grey the previous summerCalendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 290. but when he launched his prosecution, with the support of Cokayne and his own lawyers, he was still having difficulty in actually gaining possession of Crich. Cokayne's involvement with Cromwell then drew him into the affairs of Lincolnshire. Walter Tailboys, a neighbour and client of Cromwell, together with some of his relatives and friends, had initiated an assize of novel disseisin. Eight plaintiffs and four defendants were named, although others were involved, and a number of tenements were at stake on or close to the Lincolnshire coast, at Theddlethorpe, Mablethorpe, Saltfleetby, Strubby, Carlton, Gayton and Withern, suggesting a contest between groups of property speculators. The plaintiffs had triumphed at the initial hearing and the defendants had decided to come to terms. They promised to accept the judgement and make a quitclaim,Calendar of Close Rolls, 1429‚Äì1435, p. 110. but wanted to limit their losses. Both sides seem to have recruited guarantors among serving MPs: the 1431 parliament, which was Cokayne's tenth, was assembling as the legal process continued. The defendants obtained recognizances to guarantee their quitclaimCalendar of Close Rolls, 1429‚Äì1435, p. 109. from John Culpepper, just elected MP for Rutland, and from Thomas Strange, a Midlands landowner. Cokayne agreed to enter into a recognizance of ¬£1000 in Derbyshire to guarantee that Tailboys would press the issue no further after the judgement had been affirmed.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1429‚Äì1435, p. 114-5. This was matched by Sir Richard Stanhope, then serving as MP for Nottinghamshire, whose wife Maud was Lord Cromwell's daughter. It was later alleged that about this time Cromwell had illegally tried to recruit Cokayne, Vernon and others into his affinity by offering them his livery. =Elections and disorder= In his later years, Cokayne became closely allied to Sir Richard Vernon. The Vernon family were the wealthiest and most powerful of the Derbyshire gentry, with large and widely spread estates, more like those of the local nobility.Wright, p. 8. Sir Richard Vernon was too powerful to be easily absorbed into one of the aristocratic affinities but not strong enough to stand entirely alone. Cokayne, in a similar position, negotiated the tricky waters of politics in the king's minority alongside Vernon and often in close alliance with him. At the county's parliamentary election in 1432 he sealed the indenture returning Richard Vernon, Sir Richard's son,Wright, p. 114. and at about the same time arranged the betrothal of his heir, John, to Vernon's daughter Anne. During this period Vernon, Cokayne and Henry Grey, Baron Grey of Codnor, were the decisive influences in the choice of knights of the shire, generally in collusion, although Humphrey Stafford also took a close interest. However, in 1433 the tacit collaboration between the gentry and Grey broke down. In April Grey sought a closer alliance by granting his livery to both Cokayne and Vernon.Wright, p. 132. However, the county was already in a state of great tension, with a major dispute between the Foljambe and Pierrepont families overshadowing other issues. This did not reach a climax until 1 January 1434 at Chesterfield parish church, when Sir Henry Pierrepont was maimed and two of his companions killed.Wright, p. 128. Subsequently, through the interpretations of two separate grand juries set before a commission of oyer and terminer at Derby in March and a trial the following month, the previous year's events were filtered into rival and shifting narratives. Cokayne and Vernon were part of a jury that upheld Thomas Foljambe's version of events. Grey was indicted for bringing a force of 200 men to Derby on 24 June 1433 to hinder the county election. However, Vernon and Cokayne were also indicted for turning out a force of 300 to take the county seats for themselvesWright, p. 130. ‚Äì the last time either would sit in Parliament. There was no direct connection between the contested election and the sensational murders but at the time there seemed to be a pattern of widespread violence and intimidation which both sides sought to use in justification. The 1433 Parliament had agreed that \\"no Lorde, nor none other persone, of what estate, degree or condition that he be, shal wetyngly receyve, cherishe, hold in household, ne maynteyne\\" criminals of any sort. To that end it had specifically forbidden the granting of livery and the maintenance of retinues as part of a general condemnation of intimidation in judicial and political affairs.Rotuli Parliamentorum, volume 4, p. 422. Ironically, it was Grey, together with Vernon and Cokayne, described as \\"knights of the shire,\\" who were in May 1434 commissioned under the terms of the act to take oaths from a large number of Derbyshire men, pledging themselves not to maintain peace breakers.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 410. Despite his role in the turbulence afflicting the county, Cokayne remained a trusted agent of government and order to the end of his life. He was again commissioned to help raise a loan on 24 February 1436Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 529. and made a commissioner of array on 6 August of that year.Calendar of Patent Rolls, 1429‚Äì1436, p. 522. Landowner Based on the pedigrees in Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls. In 1412 Cokayne's income from his Derbyshire lands was put at ¬£40, compared with an annuity of ¬£60 he was still drawing from Ashbourne ex concessione domini regis pro termino vite sue (as a grant from his lord the king to the end of his life) as a Lancastrian retainer.Feudal Aids, volume 6, p. 412. The extension of his estates through the Harthill inheritance was for long uncertain. At the death of his grandfather, Richard Harthill, there was still a male heir in the family, a ten-year-old grandson called William, who was intended to inherit the majority of the estates. Richard had appointed feoffees to ease the transition, although there were reports that the tenants had no connection with the feoffees and an inquisition post mortem decided that Pooley and the rest ought to escheat to the king during William's minority.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Richard II, volume 16, nos. 863-5. In March 1401 an inquiry was held at Tamworth, Staffordshire, into the age of William and it transpired that he was 21, old enough to take over his estates, although he his wardship was still held by Roger Sapurton.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Henry IV, volume 18, no. 529. Only with the death of William sine prole in the summer of 1402 could it be certain that his aunt Elizabeth, Sir John Cokayne's mother, would inherit. However, matters were still far from straightforward. For example, an inquisition at Tamworth on 10 August found that Elizabeth's stepmother, Mary, was still alive and held a third of the estate at Newton Regis.Calendar of Inquisitions Post Mortem, Henry IV, volume 18, no. 529. After the death of Edmund Cokayne in 1403, Elizabeth married John Francis (also rendered Franceys and Fraunceys) of Ingleby, Note anchor 178. apparently in the same year,Cockayne Memoranda, volume 1, p. 18. She and Francis settled the manor of Harthill on Sir John Cockayne at about the time of their marriageCockayne Memoranda, volume 1, p. 17. but Elizabeth seems to have been in no hurry to hand over any more of her inheritance to her son. The quitclaim dated 21 April 1416 but issued on 5 May 1417, after her death, listed the manors and properties that made up the Harthill inheritance. During the final two decades of his life, but only then, Cokayne was a major landowner with a substantial collection of properties in three counties. =Derbyshire= :* Ashbourne. Although the manor was under the lordship of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Cokaynes had been resident and held considerable property in Ashbourne over several centuries, with their most important seat at Ashbourne Hall. Sir John Cokayne also drew his annuity on lands in the manor. :* Parwich. Cokayne is listed as holding Parwich in 1431Feudal Aids, volume 1, p. 295. and it was not apparently part of the Harthill inheritance, so must have been acquired by Sir John himself on an earlier Cokayne. :* Thorpe. Thorpe, like Parwich, was held by Cokayne in 1431 but apparently not inherited from the Harthills. :* Middleton-by-Wirksworth was held in 1431 by Cokayne,Feudal Aids, volume 1, p. 294. who inherited it from his mother, as he did the remaining Derbyshire properties. :* Ballidon :* Tissington :* HarthillFeudal Aids, volume 1, p. 282. Cokayne inherited a considerable residence in this manor.Cockayne Memoranda, volume 1, p. 21. :* Alport. The quitclaim of Elizabeth Francis mentions that the Harthill inheritance included the valuable watermill at Alport, at the foot of Lathkill Dale. =Staffordshire= :* Calton. His mother's bequest included the revenues and feudal services of Calton, northwest of Ashbourne, but does not mention the manor itself. =Warwickshire= :* Baddesley Ensor was held of the Earl of Warwick. Note anchor 5. :* Newton Regis. The manor of Newton Regis was divided in two in 1259 Note anchor 10. and the Harthill inheritance consisted of a moiety. Of this a third was still occupied by Mary, Richard Harthill's second wife, and her new husband Otto Worthington, as late as 1427.Wrottesley.Pedigrees from the Plea Rolls, p. 335 :* Pooley. Like Baddesley Ensor, Pooley had come into the Harthill family from Thomas de Edensor. Note anchor 168. Mary Harthill tried to claim a third of it as part of her dower in 1404, but unsuccessfully. Note anchor 177. Marriage and family Sir John Cokayne married twice. Effigy of Margaret Cokayne, Ashbourne. By his first wife, Margaret, he had a son and a daughter. :*Sir John Cokayne the younger died before his father. He married Joan, the daughter of Sir John Dabrichecourt of Markeaton, a wealthy Derbyshire Lancastrian landowner and a partisan of Thomas of Lancaster, who died during the French campaign of 1415. :*Alice Cokayne married Sir Ralph Shirley, a wealthy landowner with estates in Warwickshire, Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, who sat as MP for Leicestershire in 1420. His second wife was Isabel Shirley, whom he had married by 1422 at the latest, was the daughter of Sir Hugh Shirley and sister of Sir Ralph. Cokayne's second wife and Alice, his eldest daughter, were thus sisters-in-law. As Isabel was of a different generation from Sir John, she long outlived him, surviving at least into the 1460s. By Isabel he had another family of four sons and two daughters, most prominent being: :*John Cokayne, the second son so-named, who would have been a minor when his father died. He married Anne or Agnes Vernon and was later knighted. Like his father, he seems to have lived to a considerable old age and died in 1504.Glover, p. 33. Based on the pedigree in The Genealogist, 1891,The Genealogist, series 2, volume 7, p. 70. with additional information from relevant entries in the History of Parliament. Death Towards the end of his life Cokayne was preoccupied by questions of inheritance and the consequent family disputes. He was possibly aware of his impending death when in the Spring of 1438 he levied a fine of lands to compel the tenants of his manors of Calton, Staffordshire, and Ballidon, Derbyshire, to recognise the rights of Isabel, his second wife, as joint landholder.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, volume 11, p. 244-5. He had conditionally leased Ballidon to John and Robert Taylor, two local men, the previous year,Jeays (ed). Descriptive Catalogue of Derbyshire Charters, p. 28, no. 217. probably in preparation for this legal stratagem. Similarly Calton was leased to Richard Bingham and Richard Bromley, who agreed to recognise John and Isabel as joint holders of the estate.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1435‚Äì1441, p. 212. Bingham and John Manchester were similarly used as lessees to levy fines on other Derbyshire and Warwickshire properties. The aim seems to have been to speed Isabel's succession on Cokayne's death but to secure the estates in tail male, thus avoiding losses due to his heir's minority. On his death bed at his Warwickshire seat, Pooley, Cokayne was compelled to send for his friends and relatives Henry and Robert Kniveton to attest to his financial position and property dealings because of an argument between Isabel and his daughter Alice.Rutland Manucripts, volume 4, p. 52. The Knivetons seem to have been among feoffees he employed to handle his property: Henry was involved in transferring a small grant of land and houses around Ashbourne he had left to John Bate, dean of the Church of St Editha, Tamworth.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1435‚Äì1441, p. 459. Cokayne died on 7 June 1438 and was buried in the parish church at Ashbourne, next to his first wife. A writ of diem clausit extremum was issued on 19 June.Calendar of Fine Rolls, 1272‚Äì1307, p. 3. The inquisitions post mortem were held in the autumn and on 6 February 1439 the escheator of Staffordshire ordered to release Calton to Isabel, and the escheators of Derbyshire and Warwickshire to release the remaining estates.Calendar of Close Rolls, 1435‚Äì1441, p. 215-6. The legal disputes between Isabel and the rest of the family continued. Early in 1439 Joan, the widow of Sir John's deceased eldest son, issued a writ for the arrest of Isabel on a charge of debt and, although it was not executed locally, she was detained in London and brought to court during Trinity term. The case was transferred to Coventry under a writ of nisi prius and Isabel was released on the technicality that her place of residence was wrongly recorded in the original writ.Collections for a History of Staffordshire, series 2, volume 3, p. 156. One of those who stood surety for Isabel in London was Richard Bingham, the lessee of Calton, and another Thomas Bate, a lawyer employed by Humphrey Stafford. Bate and Isabel later married and are recorded as husband and wife in 1446, recognising the rights of John Cokayne the younger, who had granted the manor of Middleton to Isabel for her lifeJeays (ed).

The continuing temperature rise caused by global warming contributes to UAE's water scarcity, drought, rising sea level and aridity. The countryside of the UAE, characterized with its great arid land, infrequent precipitation, and high temperatures are already facing long-term aridity. This precondition is very vulnerable to the effects of climate change and contributes to worsening water scarcity, quality, and water contamination. The United Arab Emirates is located in the Middle East between Oman and Saudi Arabia, adjoining the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf. In the last years, the impact of global warming on the UAE has intensified the already existing environmental issues, including water scarcity and limited agricultural land. The United Arab Emirates are a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, listed as having the 29th highest carbon dioxide emissions. Since the boom of the oil industry occurred in the early 21st century, the population and its consumption of energy have sharply increased. The United Arab Emirates contains the world's seventh largest natural resource of oil and seventeenth-largest natural gas reserve. This possession of a high amount of valuable natural resources pushed the United Arab Emirates to the position of the ninth wealthiest country in the world by 2016 GDP per capita. These financial resources support their adaptation capacity to \\"climate change-induced challenges\\". Currently, they are investing in increasing air conditioning infrastructure, rainwater drainage systems, constructing flood barriers and new desalination plants. In June 2016 Abu Dhabi announced a project for an enhanced rainwater drainage system due to unnaturally occurring thunderstorms in March 2016 which caused 860 damages on properties and flooding. Also, the three main characteristics of United Arab Emirates' politics contribute to the recent natural unsustainability: First, the Emirates feature components of a Rentier state. It is governed by an authoritarian political system and finally, both facts cause critical natural resource-related trades. In particular, UAE as a rentier state means that the federalization gains external rent from foreign individuals, companies and governments. A rentier state's economy is predominated by the dependency on external rents. Oil revenues also count as external rent.  Issues  Notable environmental issues of the United Arab Emirates can be divided into: * loss of wildlife habitat * climate change and its effects * limited agricultural land * air pollution * land pollution = Historical background = The UAE, founded in 1971, is a developing federalization of seven emirates: Abu Dhabi, Ajman, Dubai, Fujairah, Ras al-Khaimah, Sharjah and Umm al-Quwain. The area of UAE was originally populated by nomadic people and faced only rural development. In the last 40 years the United Arab Emirates, with a population of 9,156,963 citizens, have developed to one of the most rapidly growing countries in the world. Their enormous growth is powered by the exploitation of their gas and oil resources with a peak in the 2000s when the Gulf monarchy's finally got dependent on their oil and gas exports. The Gulf monarchy's wealth is almost entirely related to their huge export in fossil fuels, thus they have never been particularly interested in cooperation or negotiation concerning global warming. Since global warming intensified and its impacts on the UAE got worse, they are making important approaches regarding climate change. In 2005, the UAE signed the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Convention on Climate Change, thus becoming the \\"green\\" leader of the major oil-producing countries. The United Arab Emirates, with a focus on their wealthiest emirates Abu Dhabi and Dubai, started their first action concerning climate change by initiating small \\"green\\" projects in 2006. For instance, the project Masdar City was the first contribution of Abu Dhabi which addressed global warming through the implementation of natural sustainability in people¬¥s daily life, for example using solar energy. Abu Dhabi created a new form of branding by calling itself as a \\"green\\" leader and \\"demonstrate[s] fossil fuel wealth can and will be used to promote clean energy and environmental sustainability initiatives if there is an economic or political motive, as in any other state\\". Finally, the United Arab Emirates hosted the International Renewable Energy Agency in 2009. Nowadays, the United Arab Emirates are mainly focused on the economic challenges of the diminishing volume of natural resources while also regulating the stability of imports and exports. That is the reason why UAE decided to ensure energy security with nuclear power as well as renewable energy, in particular, solar energy. \\"We have seen impressive solar developments in the UAE this year [2016] with Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Dubai, and recently in Abu Dhabi where its planned 350MW solar PV plant in Sweihan received very competitive bids, with the lowest bid offering a new global record low price of 2.42 U.S. US cents/kWh,\\" said Ali Alshafar, Deputy Head of Delegation of the UAE. Alshafar points out UAE's major development in solar power. While the UAE extend their renewable energy infrastructure, they are challenged by three main environmental issues: loss of wildlife habitat through urbanization and industrialisation, limited agricultural land caused by UAE's arid landscape and low precipitation and finally the intensifying effects of climate change like sea level rising and the increasing frequency of dust storms. Especially, their growing population contributes to even worsening the dependency on desalination plants and increasing huge food imports from the main importer, India. In the future development of the UAE, Luomi predicts that they will continue with overconsumption while applying to enhanced technology. \\"As long as energy resources and external rent are maintained, the Gulf monarchies will at least, in theory, maintain their capability to sustain their energy- intensive modern lifestyles (with air conditioning and seawater desalination); secure food supply through subsidized local farming and foreign farmland purchases; continue the opulent land manipulation projects; and, generally, keep up a strong state capacity through rent distribution, despite rising temperatures and sea levels.\\"  Climate change  The Earth's climate is constantly changing throughout the existence of the planet earth. In the last years, human activities including air pollution and water pollution have introduced a new area of climate change, global warming. \\"The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is very likely human- induced and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented in the past 1,300 years.\\" In other words, today's climate change differs from the normal climate development through its induction by human activities. The global warming of over 2 ¬∞C would begin to seriously threaten global living. In 2010, UAE examined with the support of the Stockholm Environment Institute's US Center the effects of increasing carbon dioxide emissions and its impact on the weather. The report investigates the effects of climate change on the economy, the infrastructure, the health of citizens and the entire ecosystem. It resultants with a dramatical impact of rising sea levels by affecting 6 percent of its coastal urbanization by the end of the century. The scenario of one-meter sea-level rise would lead to UAE's loss of 1,155 square kilometers of the country's coast by 2050. Nine meters of sea level rising would flood almost all of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. = Abu Dhabi Ascent = The United Arab Emirates also contributed to the Climate Summit 2014 by hosting the \\"Abu Dhabi Ascent\\". This preparatory meeting on 4‚Äì5 May 2014 was held by Secretary- General Ban Ki-moon and Minister of State and Special Envoy for Energy and Climate Change, of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Dr. Sultan Al Jaber. On Abu Dhabi Ascent participated1,000 attendees, \\" including 1,000 Government ministers, business, finance and civil society leaders, who discussed a range of new and existing initiatives and partnerships to tackle climate change in their countries.\\" Its target was to create an impulse for the following Climate Summit. The Climate Summit was introduced by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who invited world leaders in finance, politics and business as well as civil society to Climate Summit 2014. It was held on September 23 of 2014 and its aim was the effective approaches in climate action. The Climate Summit also acted as an impulse on politicians decisions regarding the important universal climate agreement in Paris in 2015 . It encouraged all countries to reduce greenhouse gases while corresponding with adaptation to the negative impacts of climate change. = Effects of climate change =  Rising sea level  NASA satellites show sea levels rising at a rate of 3.22 millimeters per year. The UN International Governmental Panel on Climate Change published also a report which shows that the sea levels might peak a level of 0.76 meters in 2100. The calculations for the year 2500 show a rise of 1.8 meters. Specifically in the UAE, reports expect a land loss of 1‚Äì6% (1,555‚Äì 5,000 km2) by 2100. \\"Climate change impacts are very important in this part of the world. Global warming has a huge impact in terms of water scarcity and rising sea levels. Those huge cities and huge buildings are very near the sea,\\" Christian de Perthuis, economist and professor at Paris-Dauphine University and Head of the Climate Economics Chair said. If sea levels continue to rise, \\"it will be very difficult to protect those cities.\\" The consequences of rising sea levels are economic harm and the relocation of low- lying urbanized cities, for instance the population on the famous Palm Islands, a man-made island in Dubai. In 2010, The Abu Dhabi Environmental Agency published an announcement which shows that 85% of UAE's population would be affected by rising sea levels as well as 90 percent of its infrastructure.  Dust storms  Dust Storm in Dubai Dust storms are caused by wind blowing over the desert. The biology department of the United Arab Emirates University investigated Dust storm's frequencies and strengths on a 5-year time period, between 2004 and 2009, and have ascertained that climate change effects could be the reason for the resultant of a noticeable shift in the characteristics of dust storms. \\"The range of mineral compositions of the collected dust samples is consistent with temporally and spatially variable dust sources, associated with changing wind patterns over the Persian Gulf.\\" The reason for this development is given by rising temperature which causes less precipitation. The consequence is dehydration of already dry landscape. UAE's climate condition of hot temperature and semi- arid landscape affects also the reaction between industrial pollution and airborne dust different than other places in the world. This reaction might support the correlation between the pollution caused by human consumption and the increasing airborne dust frequency. \\"Dust provides surfaces for heterogeneous reactions, it can get compounds, dangerous compounds that we could not see in other places\\" explained Professor Georgiy Stenchikov at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia. Mr Stenchikov points out that the reaction between dust and man-made pollutants in the desert of the UAE is unique and must still be investigated by scientists. Moreover, it is possible that the effects are even worse than assumed. For instance one man-made pollutant produced by the production and the use of iron, causes rising levels of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) in the atmosphere. Dimethyl sulfide are responsible for condensation nuclei which are vital for the formation of clouds and precipitation. By oxidation, DMS \\"will scatter solar radiation effectively with a consequent decrease in global temperature as a climate feedback.\\" A positive effect of dust storm is the distribution of mineralogical nutrients which have a good influence on the marine ecosystem. = Mitigation of climate change =  Nuclear power  Nuclear power \\"emerged as a proven, environmentally promising and commercially competitive option which could make a significant base-load contribution to the UAE's economy and future energy security.\\" This statement was given by The World Nuclear Association, an international organization which represents the global nuclear industry. In 2006, the United Arab Emirates agreed to an investigation of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) for the construction of nuclear power plants in the Persian Gulf area. Two years later the country announced a nuclear energy policy driven by a study which estimates an increase in energy demand of over 40 GWe in 2020. UAE's natural gas resources would not be able to supply the demand. The same situation with renewable energy which could only produce 6-7% of the required energy by 2020. The import of coal is not possible because of its negative impact on the environment and the energy security. Thus UAE decided to turn to nuclear. Since 2009 the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) is responsible for projects concerning nuclear power in the UAE. The organization was established with a budget of $100 million. In 2013, the country's energy production of 106 TWh gross was almost entirely produced from gas. The energy demand continued growing especially because of the high consumption of desalination plants. In 2015, UAEs energy import from Iran has peaked 3000 MWe . The construction of the first nuclear power station began in the United Arab Emirates in March 2011. The project comprises a nuclear power plant called Barakah nuclear power plant with four reactors (5600 MW) in total. The power plant is located close to the city Ruwais. Another possible location for a nuclear power station is Al Fujayrah on the Indian Ocean coast. In October 2016, the United Arab Emirates contracted a new reactor constructed by Korea Electric Power Corp. The first reactor is planned for 2017. In neighboring Saudi Arabia the location for their first nuclear power plant will be chosen soon. = Adaption to climate change =  Desalination  The ongoing industrialization and the boom in the tourism sector have had a high influence on the country's water consumption, which can not be satisfied by natural resources because of the arid landscape and the hot climate in the United Arab Emirates. The growing pressure on politicians shapes UAE's huge investments in high-level technology in order to supply the growing demand of water consumption. The UAE's require desalination from the Persian Gulf to meet their groundwater demand. While desalination supports groundwater supplies, it also highly increases energy demand because of its required power to produce 40% to 99% of all drinking water. The Gulf monarchy's desalination pattern reaches high levels on the global scale, by controlling 60% of worldwide constructed desalination plants. The procedure of desalination generates two types of water, water that satisfies drinking water conditions and the second \\" by- product \\" contains a concentrated salt level. The by-product is drained into the sea for cost-saving purposes. The consequences are noticeable, with seas becoming \\"hypersaline\\", causing a reduction on desalination plants effectivity. The costs of desalination increase simultaneously. UAE's wasteful procedures to exploit groundwater have led to a crisis level on fresh water resources. Reports are available, which show a sinking groundwater level of 1 meter per year. The contamination of water aquifer by saltwater contributes to this situation. Since the 1960s, when the first desalination plant was constructed by Weir Westgarth, the UAE's drinking water supply has always depended on this technology. In the 2014 environment statistics report from the Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi, demonstrates its sharply increasing water consumption from 667 million cubic meters in 2005 to 1.126 billion cubic meters in 2014. By 2025 the Arab countries will face serious levels of water scarcity regardless of climate change. Human activities like the construction of dams, unsustainable irrigation practices, and wasteful water overconsumption caused this approaching drought. 80% of Arabs water consumption is used for agriculture. If the temperature rises, also the Euphrates water level might drop to 70% of its past water flow and the Jordan River will sink to 20% of its current water volume by the end of this century. 80% of Arab's area is desert and faces low precipitation.  Loss of wildlife habitat  = Coastal urbanization = In the last 30 years, the United Arab Emirates boom in the oil industry has caused largely urbanized cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Their approach in technology, economic and politics are represented by high-tech innovations, enhanced infrastructure and an established industry with worldwide operating companies. Those conditions shaped UAE's society and powered the urbanization in their development. The growing industrial business influenced people from all over the world, to settle down in the UAE. Driven by the increasing prosperity, society overconsumes to adapt to the rising living standard. Also, the high demand for cheap labor attracts many migrants. The urbanization of UAE influences the environment, the social structure, and the economy in this area. Also, the growing tourism sector in this urban environment challenges the country's food, social and energy security. In detail, to provide the growing population with food, UAE overfish and overgraze. The waste is reaching crisis levels while the exploitation of oil and gas comes with wealth but destroys environmental habitat. Nighttime view of the United Arab Emirates \\"Ecological Footprint World resources are being consumed at a rate 25 % faster on average than their availability\\". That is caused by the UAE's rapidly growing population in their major cities while environmental resources are rare. Urbanization destroyed the natural habitat and industrial development led to water pollution and exploitation of natural resources. In 1971, when the United Arab Emirates was founded, the country¬¥s population was approximately 300 000 people. Today, the country has over 9 000 000 citizens while 89,5% live in urban areas. Within the next 100 years, the centralization on the coastal area will face a rising sea level caused by climate change. For instance, 50% of the United Arab Emirates population would be affected by a sea-level rising of 5 meters.  Limited agricultural land  \\"The interannual, monthly and daily distribution of climate variables (e.g., temperature, radiation, precipitation, water vapour pressure in the air and wind speed) affects a number of physical, chemical and biological processes that drive the productivity of agricultural, forestry and fisheries systems.\\" Through the impact of pollution, the exploitation of natural resources and destruction of wildlife habitat, climate variables change and affect environmental conditions. This leads to less productivity in agriculture through water scarcity and soil erosion. The United Arab Emirates have had ever a high dependency on the international food market because of their semi- arid landscape. Through these basic conditions, agriculture is almost not possible. That is the reason why only 81 000 hectares of cultivated land exists. Also, only 1 percent of their water consumption can be supplied by rainfall. UAE's food security is challenged even more by the effects of climate change. To support the domestic cultivation of raw materials, the country has extended its agricultural policies, for instance by implementing new support of new innovations in agriculture technology, a more efficient water usage, and specific crop selection. The UAE's region of Ra's al-Khaimah owns the most successful agricultural plants, watered by the mountains of Oman. Nevertheless, the domestic production is only considered as 1 percent of countries gross domestic product. Since agriculture is only rarely possible, the UAE have a high dependency on grocery imports. For instance, their total imports were forecasted with US$20 billion in 2006.The country is considered as one of the largest net importer of staple food on a global scale. The import contains mostly wheat, rice, and sugar. India is the most important supplier with 15 to 20 percent of total. The Emirates also lease areas in countries like Sudan, Morocco and Pakistan, to provide food security. Almost all Gulf Cooperation Council states depend on agri-food import except Saudi Arabia. Some of the GCC countries began to search for farmland because of the increasing international food prices.  Air pollution  The United Arab Emirates are a contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, listed as having 29th highest carbon dioxide emissions. This was caused by the boom in oil-industry in the early 21st century which contributed to a great increase in population and its consumption.The United Arab Emirate's fossil fuels have always been the main factor in energy security and economic activity. From 1990 until 2008, carbon dioxide emissions increased from 60.8 to 146.9 million tons. From 2009 to 2010, the energy demand in Dubai continued to increase over 10%. In order to satisfy the rising energy demand, the Emirates responded in 2011 with a new mixture of energy supplies by including coal as the most important power source as well as natural gas, nuclear power and a low input of solar energy. In 2015, UAE's energy sector polluted about 50% of the total carbon dioxide emissions. Presently, the energy demand is mostly supplied by 28% oil and 71% gas production. The remaining 1 percent is contributed by renewables, which are in their initial stage. Abu Dhabi contains 95 percent of the UAE's oil and 92 percent of their natural gas reserves. The main energy consumption is caused by socio-cultural factors of the recently wealthy society, the high energy demand of desalination plants and generally industrial and tourism energy consumption. By 2020, the UAE target increasing sustainable energy by 20 percent. In 2030, a new energy mix is scheduled of 5.6 GW of nuclear energy, which is already under construction, and 2.5 GW of renewable energy. Within the UAE, the emirate of Sharjah's air contamination was concluded to be worse than in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, making it the most polluted city among the 8 major cities (including al ain), likely due to increased industrial activity, high vehicular density, and urbanization.file:///C:/Users/Dr%20Mulk/Desktop/Comparing%20pollution%20in%20Sharjah%20and%20Dubai- converted-edited.pdf References  Bibliography  * The Gulf Monarchies and Climate Change: Abu Dhabi and Qatar in an Era of Natural Unsustainability * 2016 Country Review United Arab Emirates.\\" Review. 2016: n. pag. * Luomi, Mari.

The school was first managed by the Society of Jesus and later passed on to the Piarists Fathers during the nineteenth century. The school building is one of the few Herrerian style buildings in Galicia, and widely known due to its magnificent structure, which counts with a main building, a church, and a museum. Nowadays the school continues to impart classes from kindergarten to High School. History =Foundation= The school was founded in 1523 by the Cardinal of Seville, Don Rodrigo de Castro, son of Countess Beatriz de Castro and Count Don Alvaro de Osorio. The school is located in Monforte de Lemos, in the north region of Spain, in the city of Lugo, Galicia.http://escolapiosmonforte.es/historia/... thumbRepresentation of Virge n de la Antigua in the Cathedral of Seville, Spain left =First Years= During the first years, the school was managed by the Society of Jesus, in which the Cardinal was highly involved, providing financial support and management supervision to other Jesuit schools in the south of Spain: School of Jerez de la Frontera and Seminary School of the British Jesuits. Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Antigua The school is considered the biggest legacy of the Cardinal in Monforte de Lemos, and one of the few buildings built in the Herrerian style in Galicia, Spain. The name of the school, Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Antigua, emerges from the great devotion the Cardinal had to the Antigua Virgin, one of the multiple representations of Virgin Mary. = 1767-1873 = In 1767, the 11 Jesuits residing in the school were driven out by Spanish King Carlos III, and forced to abandon the school leaving all their objects and personal belongings. After the Jesuits were expelled form the School, the King ordered to erase all signs of the Jesuits Society from the school shield and symbols. Since this moment until 1873, the school was served for multiple purposes, from the Real Seminar, School of Humanities and Fine Arts and Province Institute of Lugo. After this period of time, the building was left in ruins, having to be closed because it was completely uninhabitable. = 1873 = In 1873, Duke of Alba, takes control of the School and ordered the Piarists Fathers to restore and mend the building and start again to impart classes. In November 1873, the Piarists Fathers started to impart classes to a promotion of 153 students, but it didn't last long before the Piarists Fathers tried to escape the city due to defaults from the Duke and the Mayor. = Contemporary = Nowadays the school is still managed by the Piarists Fathers, after 141 years. The school offers kindergarten, primary and secondary education, offering a study exchange program with United Kingdom and France. Geography Lugo, is a province situated in the northwest of Spain, in the autonomous province of Galicia. The municipality counts with a population of 98,134 in 2015,http://www.ige.eu/web/index.jsp?idioma=gl... making it the most populated province of Galicia.City Hall, Lugo, Galicia Lugo is the only city in the world to be surrounded by completely intact Roman walls, which reach a height of 10 to 15 meters (33 to 49 feet) along a 2,117-metre (6,946 ft) circuit ringed with 71 towers.http://www.spain.info/en_CA/que-quieres/ciudades- pueblos/otros-destinos/lugo.html... The walk along the top is continuous round the circuit, and features ten gates. These 3rd century walls are protected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/987... The bridge over the Minho is essentially of Roman date, though many repairs over the centuries have effaced its Roman character. Infrastructure View of the School Nuestra Senora de la Antigua from the Outside = Main Building = The building was built in the Herrerian style, which falls into the Renaissance art. Due to the size and grandiosity of the building, it received the name \\"El Escorial de Galicia\\". The building is 23 meters high and 110 meters long, and is distributed in total symmetry. The whole building was built with Spanish granite, which turns into gold color with the pass of time. In the middle of the structure a portico was built, as the entrance of the church that was built in the building. The portico is divided in two different parts. The superior part, built on an Ionian style and the inferior part, built on a Doric style. = Great Escalator = Built by Pedro Marlote and Juan de la Sierra between 1594 and 1603, the great escalator is characterized for its 3 meters wide and its one piece steps. The structure was made with such a strong granite, that the state of it is almost perfect after centuries of used. One of the main characteristics that make this escalator unique is the way it was built. The escalator has no central support, resting on the side walls of the building. Under the escalator, in the arcade, there are still rests of the map, the architects draw as a reference to built the escalator.Cloister, Nuestra Senora de la Antigua School in Lugo, Spain = Cloister = The cloister was built on a Doric-Romanic style with 22 meters of length from side to side. The cloister is supported by heavy pillars of one and a half meters high and surrounds a yard, covered with groined vaults and rosettes that fall between the ribs intersections. In the top-middle of each pillar four different shields represent the different contributors to the building: the first shield represents the Cardinal Rodrigo de Castro; the second one refers to Casa de Lemos; the third one belongs to the Casa de Alba; and the last one stand for Escuelas Pias, representing the contribution of the Piarists Fathers. The shield representing the Piarist Fathers was decided to include it in along with the others, because they were the ones that finished the building between 1919 and 1926. = Church = The church from the inside The church was built on a Jesuitical style, inspired by the Gesu de Roma, mother church of the Jesuits. The building was built on a Latin-cross plant with short arms. The central vessel has a barrel vault resting on an ionian entablature, which is decorated with a geometric and simple border.http://www.escolapiosmonforte.com/historia%20del%20colegio/historia.htm ...

During working days the church offers one session at 11:00AM and during holidays it counts with three different sessions: 9:30AM, 11:00AM and 12:30AM.http://www.misas.org/p/escolapios-monforte-de-lemos... = The Museum = The school counts with a small museum situated in the old sacristy of the church.http://museos.xunta.gal/es/nosa-senora-antiga... The museum houses paintings from important Spanish artists such as El Greco, the author of two of the most relevant pieces found in the walls of the sacristy: La Aparicion de la Virgen con el nino a San Lorenzo and Fray Leon meditando sobre la muerte. Among other paintings, there are five pieces from Andrea del Sarto, all of them representations of different saints: San Pedro, San Juan Buatista, Santa Ines, Santa Margarita and Santa Catalina. We can also find two oil paintings each of them representing the Doomsday and the Death, and a portrait of the Cardinal by Francisco Pacheco. On both sides of the room there are glass cabinets which contain objects that belong to the Cardinal.

This temple is co-related to Moothedathu Devi Temple at Vaikom. The story behind the co-relation is that the grandfather of Gowri Kuttapan (eldest member Kalloorath family) was a staunch believer of Moothedathu Devi. He was also the velichappadu of Moothedathu Devi Temple. The following generation did not take the position of Velichapaadu, so after the Grandfather's death, Gowri Kuttapan inherited his sword. After her marriage with Kuttapan, Gowri settled at Kattappana. During this period Gowri Kuttapan used to light a lamp to venerate the Sword. They faced problems such as disease and poverty. Late Kuttapan conducted a Devaprasanam (astrological verification). In Devaprasanam the presence of Devi was visualised, and Devi needed shelter outside the house. So in the early 20th century, Late Kuttapan built a small building, but wished to build a proper temple. In 1989, the Kalloorath family, headed by K.K. Thankapan, built a new temple. Family members involved the public in administering the temple, selecting 51 neighbours as the governing body. Festivals Kumbha Bharani Mahotsavam hosted during February and March is the most noted festival of the temple.

In 2016, he won two graded stakes races in the United States, including the prestigious Woodward Stakes. He started 2017 with a runner-up performance in the world's richest horse race, the Pegasus World Cup, followed up by wins in the Santa Anita Handicap and Pimlico Special. He was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in 2018. Background Shaman Ghost was bred in Canada by Frank Stronach's Adena Springs and raced as a homebred for Stronach Stables. His sire Ghostzapper and grandsire Awesome Again also ran for Stronach, winning the Breeders' Cup Classic in 2003 and 1998 respectively. Ghostzapper was a \\"freakishly talented\\" racehorse whose career as a stallion has been somewhat hampered by the fact that his best runners tend to develop late. Shaman Ghost was the third foal and first winner out of Getback Time, a stakes-placed mare by Gilded Time. Racing career Shaman Ghost raced only twice as a two-year-old, finishing out of the money both times. \\"He was never a precocious two-year-old. He was a slow learner,\\" his trainer Brian Lynch said later. \\"I always thought he was talented, it just took him a few starts to get it together.\\" =2015: three-year-old campaign= His three-year-old season started the same way, with a fourth place finish in a maiden special weight race at Gulfstream Park on January 3, 2015. After losses on Polytrack, dirt and turf, Lynch decided to change things up by removing the blinkers the horse had previously worn. On March 14 at Gulfstream Park, Shaman Ghost won his first race, following up with an allowance race win on April 9 at Keeneland. On May 16, he was shipped to Woodbine Racetrack for the Grade III Marine Stakes at a distance of miles. In spite of his two-race winning streak, he was a longshot in the nine-horse field at 13-1. Shaman Ghost raced near the back of the field for most of the race, then started his move on the far turn. He made up ground quickly but then ran into traffic, checked and moved to the outside. Once in the clear, he regained his stride and pulled away to win by half a length. On July 5, Shaman Ghost entered the Queen's Plate, the first leg of the Canadian Triple Crown and run over Woodbine's Polytrack surface at a distance of miles. He was the 3-1 co-favorite with Danish Dynaformer, the winner of the Plate Trial Stakes. The two raced behind a fast early pace, then Danish Dynaformer made his move on the far turn, hitting the lead in mid- stretch. At that point, Shaman Ghost was in fourth, but started closing ground on the outside, drawing away in the final strides to win by lengths. \\"He (Danish Dynaformer) made a move too early, I let him pass me,\\" said jockey Rafael Manuel Hernandez. \\"I know my horse always got a kick... and we got them back.\\" It was the first Queen's Plate win for both Hernandez and Lynch, and the third for Stronach. Shaman Ghost's next start was the Prince of Wales Stakes, the second leg of the Canadian Triple Crown, held at Fort Erie Race Track on July 28. He was the 3-2 favorite but lost by a neck to longshot Breaking Lucky after a less than ideal trip. \\"I was inside down the backside and had to stay where I was and make one run,\\" said Hernandez. \\"It looked like we were done down the lane, but he came back again and almost got there.\\" Shaman Ghost did not enter the Breeders' Stakes, the third leg of the Triple Crown, and missed the rest of the year after undergoing surgery on his ankle. Finishing the year with four wins and a second in six races, he received the Sovereign Award for Canadian Champion Three-Year-Old Colt. =2016: four-year- old campaign= In December 2015, Shaman Ghost was switched to the stable of Jimmy Jerkens, who gave the colt time to recover from the ankle surgery, then entered him an allowance optional claiming race at Belmont Park on May 21, 2016. He finished third, but Jerkens felt the race was \\"a lot better than it looks on paper.\\" Shaman Ghost's next start was on June 7 in the Grade II Brooklyn Invitational at Belmont Park. He raced behind a slow early pace in the -mile race, then accelerated past the field in the stretch to win by lengths. \\"Everything pretty much went as planned,\\" said jockey Joel Rosario. \\"He was very comfortable, and relaxed and finished strong.\\" On July 9, Shaman Ghost finished fifth behind stablemate Effinex in the Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park. He came down with a nagging cough, but recovered when Jerkens moved his barn to Saratoga for the summer. On September 3, Shaman Ghost was entered in the Grade I Woodward Stakes, in which Frosted was the 2-5 favorite after wins in the Metropolitan Handicap and Whitney Stakes. Shaman Ghost raced close to the pace in fourth for most of the race, then moved wide around the far turn to start passing the early leaders. In the stretch, he was overtaken by Mubtaahij on the inside and Frosted on the outside. Frosted reached the lead mid-stretch, then drifted in front of Shaman Ghost. Shaman Ghost switched paths to the gap between the two leaders and started to close ground. At the wire, the three horses were separated by a head, with Shaman Ghost in first and Frosted in third. \\"I almost decided to go around the horses,\\" said jockey Javier Castellano. \\"But when I see Frosted he went out wide, I thought the only chance I could beat him was cut the corner, split horses, and go from there.\\" Shaman Ghost's next race was supposed to be the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 5, but he spiked a fever and was scratched. He finished his 2016 campaign with a third-place finish in the Clark Handicap at Churchill Downs on November 25. Because he did not race during the year in Canada, he was not eligible for the Sovereign Awards. However, he did help Adena Springs win the Sovereign Award for Best Breeder. =2017: five-year-old season= The owner of multiple racetracks including Gulfstream Park, Stronach was responsible for the creation of the Pegasus World Cup, the world's richest horse race, run for the first time on January 28, 2017 at Gulfstream. He entered Shaman Ghost in the race at a cost of $1,000,000 against the two best racehorses in the world, California Chrome and Arrogate. Shaman Ghost responded with a second place finish behind Arrogate, earning $1.75 million. \\"He kept on coming against a lot of nice horses,\\" Jerkens said. \\"They saw Arrogate out there galloping along and they couldn't make any headway and threw in the towel and he kept it up.\\" Shaman Ghost made his next start on March 11 in the Santa Anita Handicap. In the early going, he was positioned on the rail a few lengths behind the early pace set by Midnight Storm, then moved to the outside as they rounded the far turn into the stretch. He closed ground rapidly but lost some momentum when Midnight Storm started drifting into his path. With an eighth of a mile remaining, Castellano hit Shaman Ghost left-handed and guided the horse out to the center of the racetrack to avoid engaging Midnight Storm. Shaman Ghost then regained his stride and pull away to win by lengths in a time of 2:01.57 for miles. \\"Of course any time you win a grade 1 it is a thrill, especially this race,\\" said Stronach, who also owns Santa Anita racetrack. \\"I was kind of sitting there quiet (watching the race). He's had a lot of bad racing luck and he's better than what he has shown. Today it all worked out.\\" On May 19, Shaman Ghost won the Pimlico Special by a neck over Dolphus, a half-brother to Hall of Famer Rachel Alexandra. Despite a slow early pace, Shaman Ghost completed the distance of in a solid time of 1:54.55. On his next start in the Suburban Handicap on July 8, he raced in second behind a slow early pace, then moved to the lead as they entered the stretch. He was passed in the final eighth of a mile though by Keen Ice, best known for upsetting American Pharoah in the 2015 Travers Stakes. \\"Turning for home, he ended up on the lead... he waited a little bit, but the other horse is a nice horse,\\" said Castellano. \\"You never know which Keen Ice is going to show up.\\" Shaman Ghost was scheduled to make his next start in the Woodward Stakes on September 2 but developed breathing issues that required throat surgery, performed on August 13. Retirement Shaman Ghost was retired from racing in December 2017. He stood the 2018 season at stud in California for a fee of $10,000. Stronach felt Shaman Ghost's presence would help strengthen the California-bred program, a key element in the success of the state's racetracks. He was relocated to Adena Springs for the 2019 season, where he will be stabled in the stall next to his sire, Ghostzapper. Shaman Ghost was inducted into the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame in August 2018. Pedigree Shaman's Ghost is inbred 3S x 5D to Relaunch, meaning Relaunch appears in the 3rd generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and in the 5th generation of the dam's side. Shaman's Ghost is also inbred 5S x 4D to Northern Dancer.

It is Nintendo's first mobile game that is part of one of the company's long-running and major franchises. In Super Mario Run, the player controls Mario or other characters as they automatically run across the screen while timing jumps to collect coins and dodge enemies and hazards. As a Super Mario game, it contains a common plot wherein Mario must rescue Princess Peach, who has just been kidnapped by Bowser. However, the player must also rebuild the Mushroom Kingdom destroyed by Bowser. The game had involvement of series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, and was developed primarily by the same team that had developed New Super Mario Bros. for the Nintendo DS, featuring many similar gameplay concepts adapted for ease of mobile controllers. The first three levels of Super Mario Run are free to play, and unlocking the rest of the game requires a one-time payment. Super Mario Run received overall positive reviews by critics. Reviewers generally praised the game's replay value and addictive gameplay, though common criticism was directed towards its comparatively high price in the mobile market, as well as its required connectivity to the internet. With 50 million downloads, it became the most downloaded mobile game in the first week. The total figure of downloads was 300 million . Gameplay Gameplay of Super Mario Run showing Mario standing on a pause block, halting his running as well as the timer at the top of the screen. Super Mario Run plays as a side-scrolling, auto-runner platform game. The plot begins with Mario accepting Princess Peach's invitation to her castle, only to witness Bowser kidnapping the Princess and destroying the Mushroom Kingdom, tasking Mario to undo his actions. Mario automatically runs from left to right and jumps on his own to clear small gaps or obstacles. The player can control Mario by tapping the touch screen to make him jump over larger obstacles; the longer the screen is touched, the higher he jumps. Like other Super Mario games, the player must maneuver Mario over gaps, onto enemies, and into coins to collect them. The player's end goal is to not only steer Mario safely across the level and reach the flagpole before time is exhausted but also accumulate as many coins as possible. In addition to controlling when and how high he jumps, a hidden ability exists where the player swipes and holds the screen in the direction opposite of Mario, stalling his jumps during his descent and moving him slightly in that direction. Standing on pause blocks pauses the timer and Mario's running, and standing on blocks marked with directional arrows changes the direction of his jump. Bubbles are collectible items used to send him backward, letting the player repeat sections of the level. If a bubble is available, it is automatically used to rescue Mario from impending death. Otherwise, the player can only restart the level. Replayability comes from collecting all the normal coins and finding special coins in each level. First, the player must find five pink coins, collecting those unlocks five purple coins and finally collecting those unlocks five black coins, therefore it takes at least three playthroughs to collect everything in a given level. In addition to the main game, there is the \\"Toad Rally\\" game mode where players can challenge \\"ghost\\" versions of other players' prerecorded playthroughs of levels. Access to Toad Rally requires the player to use a Rally Ticket, which can be earned either through completing levels in the main game mode, trading My Nintendo coins, or other in-game tasks. Playing either game mode earns the player coins that can be used to buy items for creating and customizing their own \\"Mushroom Kingdom\\" in a third gameplay mode comparable to FarmVille. The player can gain or lose Toads that populate their Mushroom Kingdom in Toad Rallies. The player can unlock other characters to play as through these game modes, such as Luigi, Princess Peach, Toad, Toadette, and Yoshi. These characters have slightly different gameplay attributes; using the different characters is not required to complete any level, but they give players the tools for completing levels with different approaches. Since launch, Nintendo has released updates introducing features and other changes. For example, a \\"Friendly Run\\" version of Toad Rally does not require any Rally Tickets, can only be played up to five times per day, and will also not earn the player coins for winning. An easy difficulty mode assists players having difficulty in beating levels in World Tour by granting them unlimited bubbles and removing the time limit. However, coins collected will not count while playing in that mode. Another update raised the maximum cap number of Toads from 9,999 to 99,999, and added support for Game Center and Google Play Games achievements. A later update added nine new levels, courses, Princess Daisy as a playable character, and buildings, all of which can be unlocked by completing various goals and challenges. The levels are themed as \\"a forest, a ship packed with coins, and a whole airship armada\\", and a new game mode, titled \\"Remix 10\\", has players run through ten very short levels in a random order, with each level only taking \\"a few seconds to complete.\\"  Development  The game was developed jointly by Nintendo and DeNA. Takashi Tezuka served as the game's designer and Shigeru Miyamoto as the producer. This was the first game that Miyamoto had been closely involved in its development since 2007's Super Mario Galaxy. Nintendo used the same core development team that created New Super Mario Bros., and Super Mario Run shares a similar 2.5D graphic style with this previous title. The game's three gameplay modes were developed in parallel by separate groups within the development team. The game was built using the Unity engine. Shortly before release, Nintendo's Reggie Fils-Aim√© said the game would not be coming to the Nintendo Switch, due to different development architecture. Nintendo had been hesitant about developing titles for the mobile gaming market since its onset in the early 2010s, as the company was highly protective of its franchise characters and desired to have them only featured in games for their hardware. At that time, Nintendo president Satoru Iwata felt that by developing mobile titles, they would \\"cease to be Nintendo\\" and lose their identity. By 2014, the company recognized that the growth of the mobile market was impacting their financial performances, with sales of its hardware and software declining greatly and posting a $240 million loss for the financial year. By the next year, Iwata's views had shifted significantly, and he led Nintendo into a partnership with mobile developer DeNA to start bringing Nintendo's brands to mobile, including five planned Nintendo titles. The first of these was Miitomo, based on the Mii avatars used in Nintendo's console software. Separately, Nintendo collaborated with Niantic and The Pok√©mon Company to release Pok√©mon Go. The concept of the game arose from ideas for new Mario games on the Wii, including one where the player would need to control Mario in time to the rhythm of the music. This concept was fleshed out further as part of New Super Mario Bros., but led to the idea of a simply-controlled game. Nintendo was also inspired by speedrunners, and had noticed that these players, in racing through the various Mario games, never let go of the forward direction control, effectively making Mario run all the time, and considered how to allow all players to have that experience. Similarly, they observed speedrunners were adept at performing certain types of difficult timed jumps that enabled quick completion times; Nintendo included special blocks that players would encounter in Super Mario Run to easily complete similar jumps, so that they could \\"give even beginner players an opportunity to get a taste for what's fun about the more skilled style of Mario play\\", according to Miyamoto. The game was developed to be played with the mobile device in a vertical orientation. This gave the developers more gameplay ideas to stretch the vertical space of the game, as well as to emphasize the simplicity of the game's controls. Super Mario Run is the second mobile game under the DeNA partnership, and Nintendo's first mobile game to use one of their established intellectual properties. Miyamoto explained that some of their game franchises became increasingly more complex with every installment, making it difficult to attract new players, and that the company believed they could use mobile games with simplified controls not only to target the broadest audience of people, but also to draw them to their consoles by reintroducing these properties. While it would be possible for them to port their existing titles to mobile device with the creation of virtual controllers on the touchscreen, Miyamoto felt that would not be as \\"interesting\\", instead they were \\"more interested in looking at how we can be creative with Mario, and design for iPhones in a way that takes advantage of the uniqueness of that device and the uniqueness of that input and the features that that device has\\".  Release and updates  The game was announced by Miyamoto on September 7, 2016, at Apple's annual iPhone event. The game initially launched in 10 languages in 150 countries. Super Mario Run was released on iOS devices on December 15, 2016, and on Android devices on March 22, 2017. For the iOS release, the game runs on both iPhone and iPad. While still using the freemium model, Nintendo eschewed requiring players to keep paying to access more levels, instead offering the game as a free demo with the first three levels unlocked and requiring a one-time payment to unlock the rest of the game. Part of the reason for this pricing scheme was to make it transparent to parents who may be purchasing the game for their children so that they would not incur further costs. Fearing piracy of the game, Nintendo added always-on DRM, which requires that players have a persistent Internet connection to play. Polygon speculated that Nintendo opted to develop the game first for the iOS platform because of its stronger security options and consistent ecosystem compared to Android. Since its inception, Super Mario Run has seen updates that mostly expanded support for Nintendo accounts or added or changed gameplay content. An update released in January 2017 introduced \\"Easy Mode\\", reduced the number of Toads lost in Toad Rally, and added Korean language support. The game launched in South Korea on the same date. An April 2017 update allowed players to use Miitomo via their Nintendo Accounts to add friends already registered on their Nintendo Account, as well as customize their Mii icons, including implementing any costumes they own. A significant update in September that year added new levels and the Remix 10 game mode.  Reception  Upon release, Super Mario Run received \\"generally positive reviews\\" from critics, holding an aggregated Metacritic score of 76/100. Glixel stated that while the game was \\"deceptively simple\\" to play to reach the end of a level, it was \\"genuinely satisfying to work on the real meat of the game\\". IGN agreed, citing the game's addictive qualities and high replayability in its extra coin-collecting challenges, praising the game for successfully capturing the Super Mario charm, but criticizing it for lacking the originality in gameplay ideas that generally come with new entries in the series. While the game received positive reviews from publications, players of the game were more critical. The BBC noted that the game's user- driven App Store rating after three days of release was 2.5 stars out of 5, with the most common complaints being about the need for a persistent Internet connection and the fixed US$10 price point compared to similar games on the store. The game's Toad Rally mode was a point of division for players, as while some praised the mode, others expressed concern that its competitive features would prevent players without high amount of skill from being able to advance development of their Mushroom Kingdom, as well as the Rally Ticket entry system being seemingly unnecessary for a game without microtransactions. Industry analyst Michael Pachter suggested that the low user ratings reflect the non-traditional single-point-of-purchase approach for monetization, and that mobile gamers are more amenable towards free-to-play games that provide a larger amount of free content prior before any microtransactions are required to proceed forward. GamesIndustry.biz agreed, noted that mobile gamers have been highly critical of games with \\"hard\\" paywalls that require in-app purchases to continue, and the last several years of free-to-play mobile games has created consumers unwilling to pay for mobile games, a factor Nintendo will need to contend with for its future applications. Polygon considered that based on the negative feedback from players, that Nintendo kept too many of its own practices for its consoles and handhelds, such as the use of the Friend Code system and the lack of any planned expansions, into Super Mario Run, as well as eschewing typical mobile gaming practices, and believed that Nintendo should have worked better to adapt the game for the expectations of mobile gamers. Responding to the player complaints, Miyamoto acknowledged that Nintendo had made a mistake with the game's pricing. At The Game Awards 2017, it was nominated for \\"Best Mobile Game\\". = Commercial = Shortly after the game's announcement, Nintendo's stock soared to just under the high point it had reached after the release and success of Pok√©mon Go earlier in 2016. Financial analysts recognized that Super Mario Run would be more significant than Pok√©mon Go for Nintendo; whereas revenue from Pok√©mon Go must be split between Niantic and The Pok√©mon Company, nearly all revenue from Super Mario Run would go to Nintendo directly being an in-house developed title. After Super Mario Runs release date was announced in November, Nintendo's stock rose by 2.8%. Shortly before release, Nintendo provided a public look at the game during an episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon featuring Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aim√©. App-tracking service Apptopia reported that Super Mario Run was downloaded 2.85 million times on the day of its iOS release, while grossing over US$5 million. The title had 40 million downloads over the first four days, surpassing Pok√©mon Go as the most downloaded mobile game in the first week of release; that week's figure totaled over 50 million. App Annie estimates that about one million of those downloads lead to the user paying for the title, with 55 percent being from the United States, earning $14 million in sales. The iOS version of Super Mario Run was the tenth most downloaded app in 2016 and the top downloaded free game in 2017. With the company's end-year report for fiscal year 2016, which ended on March 31, 2017, the combined downloads for Super Mario Run across iOS and Android was approaching 150 million, and climbed to 200 million six months later. Despite these numbers, the game missed some of the anticipated metrics, particularly in Japan. On the Monday following the game's release on iOS, Nintendo's and DeNA's stock price dropped over seven percent due to its poor market reception. By December 26, Super Mario Run was no longer the top grossing app in any nation, though remained one of the top downloaded apps in 63 countries. Nintendo's stocks had dropped over 18 percent within the first two weeks of release. Within three weeks, market analysis firm Newzoo estimated that the app had been downloaded over 90 million times, with approximately $30 million in revenue from the roughly three percent who had purchased the full game. Wall Street Journals Dan Gallagher stated this conversion rate represented the difficulty in convincing mobile gamers to purchase content. Nintendo later reported in a total of 78 million downloads, with more than five percent paying for the full game, by January 2017 in fiscal year earnings report. This generated ¬•6 billion ($53 million) in revenues from the game. Nintendo was anticipating that they would obtain 10 percent conversion of app downloads into full purchases, and noted in February 2017 that twenty countries account for 90 percent of the game's revenue, and that within those countries they were approaching this 10 percent conversion rate. However, Nintendo's president Tatsumi Kimishima was disappointed the next month, when the revenue from the iOS version failed to fulfill the company's expectations. Nintendo's next mobile title, Fire Emblem Heroes, released two months after Super Mario Run and which used the freemium payment approach, had only 10 percent of the previous title's downloads, yet had outperformed it in overall revenue by the end of Nintendo's fiscal year 2016. Kimishima said that Nintendo had learned several lessons in development and releasing of mobile games from Super Mario Run. Kimishima said that \\"we honestly prefer the Super Mario Run model\\", though in a June 2017 investor question-and-answer session, he said \\"in the future we will consider not only a single set price, but other methods that incorporate a wider variety of elements that allow as many consumers as possible to play\\", suggesting that Nintendo's mobile strategy may move away from the pay-once model. Within days of the game's App Store release, journalists noted a number of unofficial video game clones that appeared on the Google Play store, which they believe was prompted by the lack of an Android version of Super Mario Run at the time and allowing developers to take advantage of uninformed consumers. In at least one case, an Android clone contained malware designed to collect sensitive information from a player's device. Super Mario Run was the most-downloaded game for Android devices in 2017.

After the Palamite victory, he left the city, but before leaving, he consecrated the historian and fellow anti-Palamite Nikephoros Gregoras as a monk.

From 1366‚Äì1376 he was a rival Patriarch of Antioch against the incumbent Pachomius, seeking to expand his jurisdiction against the Patriarchate of Constantinople.

Its registered office was in Castletown, Isle of Man.The Manx Sun. Saturday, 1 July 1854 By 1858 the company had run into significant financial difficulties which ultimately led to the sale of its vessel, the Ellan Vannin, and the winding up of the company. Company operations Commencing operations in August 1854 the company was formed to provide maritime transportation of cargo and passengers from the Isle of Man primarily to Whitehaven, Cumberland and the Port of Liverpool with the operation undertaken by its newly built vessel the Ellan Vannin.Manx Sun. Saturday 5 August 1854 For the town of Castletown the beginning of the company's operation was described as a joyous occasion. Shops in the town were closed, numerous flags were flown and ships in the harbour were adorned with bunting. One flag at the company‚Äôs offices displayed the ancient armorial symbol of the Isle of Man, with the motto \\"We are Progressing\\" and on the reverse side \\"Success to our Steamer\\". The Ellan Vannin entered service under the command of Captain Joseph Skillicorn, an experienced mariner who prior to his appointment had been in the employ of the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company serving on the Mona's Queen with the rank of First Officer. In order to maximise revenue the Castletown Steam Navigation Company would also serve Douglas. In March 1856 the company commenced a service from Douglas via Castletown to Kingstown, and also served Holyhead from Castletown. In the summer of 1856 excursions were also organised from Castletown via Peel to Strangford Lough so as people could attend the Ardglass Regatta. At a meeting held at the Union Hotel, Castletown, on Monday 11 August 1856, a gift in the form of a gold chronometer was presented to Capt. Skillicorn in recognition of his efficient management of the Ellan Vannin and for his part in the establishment of the company. However, by the end of 1856 the Castletown Isle of Man Steam Navigation Company were starting to make a loss.Mona's Herald. Wednesday 24 September 1856 At their third Annual General Meeting held at the town hall, Castletown on Wednesday 17 December 1856, it was disclosed that for the previous two months the company had sustained a weekly loss of ¬£12 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) resulting in a total loss of ¬£100 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). One of the directors reported that they had received several offers from a company in Dublin to charter the Ellan Vannin for the winter months of 1856-57. The rate for the charter was to be ¬£50 per week (equivalent to ¬£ in ) with a further payment of ¬£28 per week (equivalent to ¬£ in ) towards the wages of the crew. The charterer was to be also responsible for the costs of coal, oil and port charges. As terms of this potential charter, the directors had undertaken measures to enable the direct link between Castletown and Liverpool to be maintained. An agreement had been reached with the Ramsey Steam Company who would employ their vessel the Manx Fairy on the route. This was seen as a sensible course of action as opposed to sustaining a weekly loss of ¬£12 over the winter months. It can be assumed that the offer of the winter charter was accepted as there is no published schedule in the Manx Press for the Ellan Vannin from 10 December 1856 until mid-May 1857. The question was also raised at the meeting as to whether the Board had received an offer for the sale of the Ellan Vannin. One shareholder understood that the company had been offered ¬£14,000 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) for the vessel. This was explained by a director who stated that \\"should\\" they be interested in the vessel's sale, then the former proprietor of the Countess of Ellesmere \\"could\\" be willing to pay that sum. However, there is no evidence of any offer having been made and no proposal for any sale is recorded as having been presented to the shareholders by the Board of Directors. In the summer of 1857 the Ellan Vannin's regular sailings were augmented by summer cruises from Douglas via Castletown and on to the Calf of Mann. Also further pleasure cruises were added via Peel and onwards to the north of Ireland. It would appear that the vessel was being utilised to her maximum. Sailings to Whitehaven and Liverpool were maintained whilst sailings to Glasgow and from Liverpool to Dundrum via the Isle of Man were introduced. However it would seem that the company continued to sustain losses over the winter of 1857-58, and by March 1858 it had been decided to put the Ellan Vannin up for sale by public auction.Mona's Herald. Wednesday 10 March 1858 She was sailed to Trafalgar Dock, Liverpool on 6 March, where she was laid up awaiting sale. She was offered for sale at the Broker's saleroom, 5, York Buildings, Dale Street, Liverpool on 18 March 1858. Either no sale could be agreed or no interest was expressed, and the Ellan Vannin resumed trading whilst a further public auction was scheduled for 20 May. She was advertised for sale with inspections being offered at Liverpool or Castletown. The sale commenced at the Quay, Castletown, at 12:00hrs on Thursday 20 May 1858, and it was reported that there was a good attendance. The bidding proceeded very slowly with the highest offer being ¬£4,200 (equivalent to ¬£ in ) (a long way short of the ¬£14,000 reputed to have been available in 1856) a sum which the directors and shareholders present would not accept. Again the Ellan Vannin resumed revenue service whilst further attempts were made to find a buyer. The Ellan Vannin's final excursion took her across to the coast lines of County Louth and County Down via Carlingford Lough on 25 June, before she left the Isle of Man for good.Mona's Herald. Wednesday 30 June 1858. Finally the Directors of the Castletown Steam Navigation Company (by now in serious financial difficulties) managed to find a buyer. Ellan Vannin was sold to Cunard & Wilson who were acting as agents for the Sardinian Government for ¬£4,070 (equivalent to ¬£ in ). Upon purchase Ellan Vannin's name was changed to Archimedes. The company's offices in Castletown, Isle of Man were closed, with a sale of the fixtures and fittings to the public held on Wednesday 11 August 1858. Attendance was said to be good, with people wanting to buy mementoes of the Ellan Vannin.Manx Sun. Saturday 14 August 1858. p.4 The Castletown Steam Navigation Company subsequently went into liquidation. A further call on the shareholders of 10 shillings per share was made in order to finally clear the liabilities incurred by the Ellan Vannin for final claims of ¬£600Manx Sun. Saturday 25 January 1860. (equivalent to ¬£ in ). The company was finally dissolved in 1860.

It is a fan disc for the 2014 game Chaos;Child, and part of the larger Science Adventure series. The story, which is affected by player choices, is set in Shibuya, Tokyo after the events of Chaos;Child, and follows Takuru Miyashiro, who ignores the \\"Return of the New Generation Madness\\" events, instead choosing to spend time with women. Gameplay The player causes the game's plot to branch by answering questionnaires in an in-game magazine. Chaos;Child Love Chu Chu!! is a visual novel in which the story is affected by player choices: the player regularly uses the \\"Yes/No Trigger\\" system, in which they fill in \\"yes/no\\" questionnaires in the in-game magazine Cool Cat Press, and the returning \\"Delusion Trigger\\" system, in which the player chooses whether the player character should experience a positive or negative delusion. The player's choices in these cause the story to branch, affect characters' reactions, and let the player experience different scenes. Synopsis The game is a spin-off from Chaos;Child, set in October 2015 in Shibuya, Tokyo. Bizarre events referred to as the \\"Return of the New Generation Madness\\" take place, but do not interest the protagonist Takuru Miyashiro, the president of the school newspaper club; instead, he wants to focus on \\"real-life activities\\", and spend time with women. =Plot= In the beginning of the game, set after the events of Chaos;Child, Mio Kunosato is contacted by detective Takeshi Shinjo, and taken to the hospital, where he shows her a Chaos Child Syndrome (CCS) patient who still exhibits the symptoms even though all other patients have been cured. Reading the patient's documents, they find a reference to the ability to change causality, as well as a report from Shuichi Wakui mentioning that the patient has been kept unconscious due to her ability, and that he plans to use it to change the outcome of events in Chaos;Head. Looking up from the report, Mio sees not Shinjo in front of her, but Wakui. The patient opens her eyes, and the world changes. Back in October, Takuru and the newspaper club discuss the \\"Return of the New Generation Madness\\" incidents which took place in Chaos;Child ‚Äì but which have been altered, all ending non-fatally ‚Äì but they end up deciding that the events are nonsensical and decide to find another topic to cover. Eventually they decide to try making a \\"yes/no\\" questionnaire like in the Cool Cat Press magazine; Takuru ends up taking the quiz from Cool Cat Press, and the story branches into different routes depending on the result. Development and release Love Chu Chu!! was developed by 5pb., and was planned by Chiyomaru Shikura, produced by Tatsuya Matsubara, and directed by Yusuke Matsumoto, with main character designs by Mutsumi Sasaki, and music by Takeshi Abo. The scenario was written by Masashi Takimoto, Toru Yasumoto and Tsukasa Tsuchiya, under supervision by Eiji Umehara. Risa Taneda, who voiced Mio in the original Chaos;Child, did not reprise her role for Love Chu Chu!!; it was taken over by Asami Sanada after Taneda took a hiatus from her voice acting career for medical treatment. The opening theme, , was performed by the group Junj≈ç no Afilia, and the ending theme, , by the group Iketeru Hearts. The game was first announced by Shikura in September 2016, and was presented in Famitsu in November 2016, where its platforms and release date were revealed; at this point, development was said to be 30% finished. The \\"yes/no\\" questionnaire was added as a new take on the series' \\"trigger system\\" of determining story outcomes. Love Chu Chu!! was released for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on March 30, 2017 in Japan, in both a standard release and a limited edition. The latter includes a pillow cover, a school calendar, an original soundtrack album, and other items; certain retailers also included a tapestry featuring a nude illustration of the character Serika Onoe. The cover art for the limited edition was based on that of the original Chaos;Child limited edition Xbox One release, featuring the same composition, but with the characters depicted in just their underwear. In March 2018, the PlayStation 4 version was added to the PlayStation Now cloud gaming service in Japan. Digital Touch released the PlayStation 4 version in South Korea on June 21, 2018. The opening and ending themes were released as singles on April 19, 2017 and March 29, 2017, respectively. Reception Famitsu and Gameshot were surprised by the game, considering it seemingly uncharacteristic for Chaos;Child with its markedly different atmosphere, although Famitsu still called it a \\"heart-pounding\\" love story, and Gameshot appreciated how it still felt like an authentic sequel rather than just a fan disc, taking place after the original's main story. Gameshot did find some of the game's routes lacking, particularly calling the ending dissatisfying, but thought it felt more cohesive than previous side games in the series such as Chaos;Head Love Chu Chu! and Steins;Gate: My Darling's Embrace, and recommended it to series fans who like the Chaos;Child cast. Famitsu liked the limited edition Serika tapestry, describing it as \\"irresistible\\" for fans of the character. The PlayStation Vita version was the 18th best selling physical game in Japan during its opening week, selling 6,240 print copies; meanwhile, the PlayStation 4 version did not appear on Media Create's weekly top 20 chart. The game's opening theme charted on the Oricon Singles Chart in Japan for three weeks, peaking at 6th place, and the ending theme charted for one week at 16th place.

In Panamanian history, she is known as a shoemaker, seamstress, trade unionist, communist and nationalist leader and is \\"synonymous with organized labor\\" in the Panamanian psyche. She is known for leading strikes in the 1940s which resulted in workers gaining maternity leave with pay and job security while they were on leave. In 1951, she became the first woman general secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Workers of Panama. \\"The Hunger and Desperation March\\" Matamoros led in 1959, resulted in the first minimum wage law in Panama. After she joined the Communist movement of Panama, she became the subject of investigations, though it did not stop her from protesting U.S. involvement in Panamanian affairs. In 1994, she was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Omar Torrijos Herrera and in 2006, a meritorious order was named in her honor, the Order of Marta Matamoros to recognize those who have promoted gender equality in Panama. Biography Marta Matamoros Figueroa was born on 17 February 1909 in the Santa Ana neighborhood of Panama City, Panama to Josefa Figueroa and Gonz√°lo Matamoros. Her father was a professional musician and had come to play in Panama City with the Banda de Batall√≥n Colombia. Both of her parents were from the border area between Costa Rica and Panama, known as the Coto Region. Because it was unclear at that time whether the area belonged to Costa Rica or Panama, when the Coto War broke out, the family were forced to flee back to Panama City. Her father's nationalism and humanitarianism became guiding spirits for Matamoros' life. Career Forced to stop high school for lack of funding, Matamoros began working as a shoemaker and then became a dressmaker. In 1941, she started working in the El Corte Ingl√©s factory and came into contact with the harsh conditions under which laborers worked. Seventy percent of the textile manufacturer's work force were women, swing in small cramped cubicles. The women labored for 12 to 13 hours per day and were paid between $5 and $7 per week. Comparably, men were paid $15 to $20 per week. There was no type of maternity leave, so if a worker became pregnant, they had to work up to their delivery and return promptly, or face losing their job. In 1945, Matamoros joined the Union of Tailors and Allied Workers of Panama () and quickly worked her way through the ranks to become secretary of finance for the organization. By 1946, aware of labor developments in the region, Matamoros led a strike for the dressmakers of the Bazar Franc√©s. Though the strike lasted only 38 days, was declared illegal and the workers, including Matamoros were fired, the women had succeeded in bringing attention to their need for better pay and working conditions. Esther Neira de Calvo and Gumercinda P√°ez, the first two women to serve in the National Assembly, agreed to take up the issue. Matamoro's strike resulted in workers gaining paid maternity leave with pay and job security while they were on leave. It also ensured that they have job security for one year after their child's birth, when the Labor Code was changed in 1947. Later that same year Matamoros led groups in protest of the , which attempted to extend World War II concessions for United States Military Bases in Panama to permanent status. In 1951, she became the first woman general secretary of the Trade Union Federation of Workers of Panama () and was involved in protests against the United Fruit Company, which called for better working conditions and pay. She served as the Union's delegate to the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU) Congress held in Vienna in 1953. In the 1950s, Matamoros began studying the works of Marx and Lenin, traveling to the Soviet Union to see first-hand the gains made by workers there. She joined the People's Party of Panama and served on its Central Committee. She was arrested in 1951 and spent 99 days in the Modelo Prison for supporting a strike of bus drivers from R√≠o Abajo, who were demanding salary and social insurance reforms. The McCarthyism which existed in the 1950s, led to job insecurity for Matamoros and she had to quit her factory employment. Instead she turned her focus to working independently and union organization. In 1959, Matamoros led the strike called \\"The Hunger and Desperation March\\" (), in which protesters walked from Col√≥n to Panama City in protest of high unemployment and inflation. The march was successful in establishing the first minimum wage law in the country and a new renter's law. She led protests against the U.S. Army intervention of the riots of 9 January 1964 and protests in 1967 against the Robles-Johnson Treaty, which would have returned sovereignty of the Panama Canal Zone to Panama but allowed U.S. troops to remain in perpetuity. Matamoros never married or had children because she realized that marriage would have required her to give up her autonomy and ability to take risks. She founded many organizations to help women, including the Alliance of Panamanian Women (), the Vanguard of Women (), the Women's Commission for the Defense of the Rights of Women and Children () and the National Union of Panamanian Women (). Death and legacy Plaque dedicating the Institute for Women to Marta Matamoros Matamoros died on 28 December 2005 in her apartment in Santa Ana and has become, along with Domingo Barr√≠a and Angel G√≥mez, \\"synonymous with organized labor\\" in the Panamanian psyche. In 1994, she was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Omar Torrijos Herrera. She was honored by the University of Panama as one of the 100 outstanding women of Panama during the centennial celebration of Panama and the Institute for Women of the university is named in her honor. The Library of the National Confederation of Workers of Panama bears her name, as does a conference room in the Ministry of Labor and Workforce Development. In 2006, an executive decree created the Order of Marta Matamoros to honor women who have been role models and strengthened the nation by working for socio- economic, political or cultural aims to improve gender equality of society.

Early life and cartooning Martin was born on May 26, 1873, in Salem, Illinois. His given name was Horace. He was the third of four children of Thompson and Jennie Martin; Thompson Martin was a laborer. Martin studied at Vincennes University and began working in newspapers in Vincennes, Indiana in 1893. In 1894, Martin was living in St. Louis and working as a cartoonist, and was hired by Chris von der Ahe as the secretary and official scorer for the St. Louis Browns. Martin originated the Weatherbird character and single-panel comic strip for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on February 11, 1901. Though Martin handed the strip off to Oscar Chopin (1873 ‚Äì 1932) in 1903, the Weatherbird continues in use to this day and is the oldest continuously-published strip. The bird was first named \\"Dickie Bird\\" (\\"dicky-bird\\" is a generic slang term for any small bird) and it is from this that Martin got his nickname. Martin moved to New York City in 1904 and worked for the New York World, New York American, and New York Globe. He drew the strips It Happened In Birdland (April 12, 1907 ‚Äì January 6, 1908 and February 26, 1909 ‚Äì September 7, 1909 for the New York Evening Journal) and Inbad The Tailor (April 27, 1911 ‚Äì June 18, 1912, for the New York American). He also drew sports cartoons. Golf writer Martin worked as a golf journalist (including covering matches overseas) and was an expert on golf. He wrote fifteen golf books and at one time was the editor of four golf magazines. He organized a number of exhibition golf matches and was a founder of the American PGA. Personal life and death Martin married Susan Flanders on December 3, 1900, in St. Louis. They had two children. He died on April 15, 1959, in New York City. Publications * *Martin, Harry B.

Porta was armed with a crossbow and a machete, On arrival to school, he started shooting in a class with the crossbow, resulting in a teacher being killed and four students injured. The attack was the first documented case of a student killing a teacher in Spain. Attack Porta began the attack by arriving late to class, and firing a crossbow into the face of a female teacher. The student then fatally stabbed another teacher, Abel Mart√≠nez Oliva, as Mart√≠nez came to help the female teacher. Two other students were injured in the attack, including the daughter of the female teacher. The attack ended when the school P.E. teacher, David Jurado Fern√°ndez, managed to talk the student down. According to Jurado, he found the student in the second floor classroom with a knife, a crossbow, a backpack, and manipulating a beer bottle to make a molotov cocktail. Jurado then told the student that he was hurting more people than he realized and asked him to show him what he had in his backpack. The student did, then collapsed in tears into Jurado's arms. Jurado then sat with the student in the classroom until the police arrived. Victims One teacher was killed in the attack, and four others were injured. The teacher killed was a substitute teacher who had only recently begun working at the school. Two additional teachers and two students were also injured in the attacks. None of the injured victims were reported to have been seriously injured. Perpetrator The perpetrator was identified as the 13-year-old student also known as the suspected attacker of this school. After the attack, the suspect's classmates and close friends said that he \\"was a withdrawn boy who had academic problems\\". They, along with most other people, were aware of a \\"blacklist\\" which included twenty people's names who he wanted to kill. Friends argued that he had spent months talking about it, but they thought it was a \\"sick joke\\".

It first appeared in the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus which were introduced on September 7, 2016, and is used in the sixth- generation iPad, seventh-generation iPad, and seventh-generation iPod Touch. The A10 is the first Apple-designed quad-core SoC, with two high-performance cores and two energy-efficient cores. Apple states that it has 40% greater CPU performance and 50% greater graphics performance compared to its predecessor, the Apple A9.  Design  The A10 (internally, T8010) is built on TSMC's 16 nm FinFET process and contains 3.3 billion transistors (including the GPU and caches) on a die size of 125 mm2. It features two Apple-designed 64-bit 2.34 GHz ARMv8-A cores called Hurricane, each with a die size of 4.18 mm2. As the first Apple-produced quad-core SoC, it has two high-performance cores designed for demanding tasks like gaming, while also featuring two energy-efficient Apple-designed 64-bit 1.05 GHz cores codenamed Zephyr at 0.78 mm2 for normal tasks in a configuration similar to the ARM big.LITTLE technology. Unlike most implementations of big.LITTLE, such as the Snapdragon 820 or Exynos 8890, only one core type can be active at a time, either the high-performance or low- power cores, but not both. Thus, the A10 Fusion appears to software and benchmarks as a dual core chip. Apple claims that the high-performance cores are 40% faster than Apple's previous A9 processor and that the two high- efficiency cores consume 20% of the power of the high performance Hurricane cores; they are used when performing simple tasks, such as checking email. A new performance controller decides in realtime which pair of cores should run for a given task in order to optimize for performance or battery life. The A10 has an L1 cache of 64 KB for data and 64 KB for instructions, an L2 cache of 3 MB shared by both cores, and a 4 MB L3 cache that services the entire SoC. The new 6-core @ 900 MHz GPU built into the A10 chip is 50% faster while consuming 66% of the power of its A9 predecessor. Further analysis has suggested that Apple has kept the GT7600 used in Apple A9, but replaced portions of the PowerVR based GPU with its own proprietary designs. These changes appear to be using lower half-precision floating-point numbers, allowing for higher- performance and lower power consumption. Embedded in the A10 is the M10 motion coprocessor. The A10 also includes a new image processor which Apple says has twice the throughput of the prior image processor. The A10 adds hardware encoding for HEIF and HEVC.Apple has chosen HEVC as its next-generation video codec. 8 June 2017. The A10 is packaged in a new InFO packaging from TSMC which reduces the height of the package. In the same package there are also four LPDDR4 RAM chips integrating 2 GB of RAM in the iPhone 7, the iPad 6th generation, and the iPod touch 7th generation, or 3 GB in the iPhone 7 Plus and the iPad 7th generation.

Gameplay The goal of the game is to take care of an anthropomorphic cat called Tom (who can optionally be renamed by the player). The player is invited to care for \\"Tom\\" and help him grow from a baby kitten to a full-grown tomcat by interacting with him in different ways, such as feeding him, taking him to the bathroom, playing mini games, and tucking him into his bed to sleep when he is tired. Tom can repeat words spoken into the device's microphone for up to 25 seconds using a synthesized voice. Through in-app purchases, in-game currency, or by logging into Facebook, there is an option to visit Tom's friends, or travel around the world. Using in-game currency, various different outfits, skins, and accessories can be purchased to dress-up and customize Tom.  Age Inappropriate Advertising Controversy  The app was reported for having advertised age-inappropriate advertisements for adult services. In 2015, the UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that advertising for an adult web site was delivered to underage children via the app. The ASA noted that Outfit7 \\"had a strict advertising policy\\" but that the company \\"had not been able to identify which ad network had served an age-inappropriate ad on a children‚Äôs app\\" and how the advertisements were shown in the app. Awards * \\"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\\" at the 2014 Tabby Awards. * \\"Best iPad Game: Kids, Education & Family\\" and \\"Best Android Game: Puzzle, Cards & Family\\".

It consists of the use of either a debit card or a credit card to generate data on the transfer for the purchase of goods or services. Transaction data describes an action composed of events in which master data participates. Transaction focuses on the price, discount and method of payment interaction between the customer and the organization. They are based on volatility as each transaction data changes every time a purchase is made, one time it could be $10, the next $55. Since debit and credit cards are commonly used to pay for goods and services, they represent a strong percentage of the consumption expenditure in the country.  Overview  When a transaction is made, the card holder is offered a paper or electronic transaction record containing information about the purchase. This includes: transaction amount, transaction number, transaction date and time, transaction type (deposits, withdrawal, purchase or refund), type of account being debited or credited, card number, identity of the card acceptor (organization/store address) as well as the identity of the terminal (company name from which the machine operates). The use of debit cards in 2014 increased by 18% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. As for credit cards, it increased by 26% from the 2011 total volume of Canadian Payment Methods. These two types of payment methods combined make up for more transactions than cash. Card transaction data has increased through the expansion of payment channels available to customers. Additionally, incentive and reward programs have increased the use of electronic cards for their benefits. The use of contactless and e-commerce payment has also allowed for a growth in card transaction data to increase due to the simplicity of the transaction. The use of Interact Debit transactions have increased rapidly in the last 6 years according to Interact Debit statistics. However, Canada has a lower rate debit use transactions by inhabitant in comparison to the United States, Sweden, Netherlands, Australia, and Great Britain. = Credit cards = Terminal processes of credit card transactions: * Purchase * Purchase-void * Refund * Refund-void * Pre- authorization * Private label payment * Private label payment-void * Note: Terminals process pre-paid credit cards the same as standard credit cards Type of credit cards: * Standard (MasterCard, Visa, Discover, AMEX) * Pre-paid (MasterCard, Visa, Discover, AMEX) * Corporate (purchasing) cards (as long as it is a processable standard card, i.e. standard Visa means corporate Visa cards are processable) * Private label cards (depending on the terms of agreement between the company's financial terminal data generator = Debit cards = Terminal processes of debit card transactions: * Purchase * Purchase-void * Refund * Refund-Void * Some debit chips may also allow: ** Pre-Authorization ** Private label payment ** Private label payment-void * Note: debit card-holder must input their own PIN to complete transaction Point of sale terminals will give access to information  Uses  Transaction data, especially for credit card use is being turned into a revenue stream and being sold for digital advertising and other marketing efforts by many credit card companies. This is not always clear or shared between the companies and their consumers. When asked, Google refuses to disclose who and how these data are being analyzed. Information is shown that their undisclosed partner companies had access to 70 percent of transactions for credit and debit cards in the United States.The data collected is often kept anonymous and aggregate yet it can still define users within a specific ZIP code region for certain types purchases.This information allows for an analysis of the type of consumers found within a specific region and if there are any similarities. This information is then beneficial to companies or stores as it provides data on the kind of consumer they are targeting and how to be successful to increase their revenue in sales. Allowing for statistics to be gathered and marketing targeted in a more broad manner rather than based on consumer's personal transactions. Due to privacy concerns, companies such as MasterCard have refrained from sharing more detailed data on a more individual basis. Some companies such as MasterCard are planning on combining their card transaction data with purchase history and loyalty cards. Allowing for a more defined collection of statistical data of consumer buying and spending habits, this data is collected from real purchases which makes it reliable. = Card transaction data levels = Some companies such as PayPal offer an incentive rates program for merchants who offer more detailed information on their sales transactions. They are only eligible for merchants who comply with Level 2 or Level 3 transactions, transactions that fall under Level 1 qualify as a normal card transaction. To ensure that data being shared is accurate, card companies perform strict verification of data being collected at either Level 2 or 3, therefore only accurate information is eligible for incentive rates being offered by card issuers. This is another form of collecting card transaction data that can be more individualized as it is completed by the merchant after the transaction has been made. The levels refer to the amount of transaction data submitted for the card, the higher the level the more data is needed to be reported. Level requirements usually differ between companies but are similar to the following offered by PayPal:  Level 1  * Any merchant who accepts credit cards complies with this level. It functions as a normal credit card and is authorized and associated with normal transaction data.  Level 2  * Additional data regarding the actual sales such as tax, customer code, purchase number, invoice number etc. is captured at the point of sale. Most of the time it is combined with the merchants information such as Tax ID number, state and postal code data.  Level 3  * Significant additional information on the actual product or service is shared such as line items, product codes, item description, unit price and quantities as well as shipping postal code data are needed in addition to the Level 2 requirements.  Advantages for Business  The marketing industry claims that sharing card transaction data can be beneficial to consumers as it allows for card companies and merchants to provide better products and services tailored to them directly. This may result in favourable products or services for the consumer, however it tends to increase spending habits. It is also claimed that less mass marketing is done and instead only specific groups that are susceptible to the advertisements will be targeted. Businesses benefit enormously, often at the expense of consumer privacy, as this type of information is useful for identifying promising areas of growth, enhance direct marketing response rates, and improve retention of existing customers. Exposing payment and spending trends can offer more opportunity for revenue growth as well as for consumer experiences in stores and online.  Privacy Concerns  Keeping this type of data anonymous is a challenge for debit and credit card companies who share the information with third parties. Metadata with certain properties, especially a geographical location attached are hard to keep unsourced. Other patterns of behaviour are also unique enough on their own to identify individuals to using metadata, indicating that complete anonymity is impossible. As more information becomes available and is tagged by people's consuming behaviour, this will only get harder to do. The standards for protection and enforcement against the release of this metadata varies among OECD member nations. The United States does not have any enforced national law for reporting consumer data breaches.

Most modern computer processors have fast and local cache memory in which prefetched data is held until it is required. The source for the prefetch operation is usually main memory. Because of their design, accessing cache memories is typically much faster than accessing main memory, so prefetching data and then accessing it from caches is usually many orders of magnitude faster than accessing it directly from main memory. Prefetching can be done with non-blocking cache control instructions.  Data vs. instruction cache prefetching  Cache prefetching can either fetch data or instructions into cache. * Data prefetching fetches data before it is needed. Because data access patterns show less regularity than instruction patterns, accurate data prefetching is generally more challenging than instruction prefetching. * Instruction prefetching fetches instructions before they need to be executed. The first mainstream microprocessors to use some form of instruction prefetch were the Intel 8086 (six bytes) and the Motorola 68000 (four bytes). In recent years, all high-performance processors use prefetching techniques.  Hardware vs. software cache prefetching  Cache prefetching can be accomplished either by hardware or by software. * Hardware based prefetching is typically accomplished by having a dedicated hardware mechanism in the processor that watches the stream of instructions or data being requested by the executing program, recognizes the next few elements that the program might need based on this stream and prefetches into the processor's cache. * Software based prefetching is typically accomplished by having the compiler analyze the code and insert additional \\"prefetch\\" instructions in the program during compilation itself.  Methods of hardware prefetching  = Stream buffers = * Stream buffers were developed based on the concept of \\"one block lookahead (OBL) scheme\\" proposed by Alan Jay Smith. * Stream buffers are one of the most common hardware based prefetching techniques in use. This technique was originally proposed by Norman Jouppi in 1990 and many variations of this method have been developed since. The basic idea is that the cache miss address (and k subsequent addresses) are fetched into a separate buffer of depth k. This buffer is called a stream buffer and is separate from cache. The processor then consumes data/instructions from the stream buffer if the address associated with the prefetched blocks match the requested address generated by the program executing on the processor. The figure below illustrates this setup: 400x400px * Whenever the prefetch mechanism detects a miss on a memory block, say A, it allocates a stream to begin prefetching successive blocks from the missed block onward. If the stream buffer can hold 4 blocks, then we would prefetch A+1, A+2, A+3, A+4 and hold those in the allocated stream buffer. If the processor consumes A+1 next, then it shall be moved \\"up\\" from the stream buffer to the processor's cache. The first entry of the stream buffer would now be A+2 and so on. This pattern of prefetching successive blocks is called Sequential Prefetching. It is mainly used when contiguous locations are to be prefetched. For example, it is used when prefetching instructions. * This mechanism can be scaled up by adding multiple such 'stream buffers' - each of which would maintain a separate prefetch stream. For each new miss, there would be a new stream buffer allocated and it would operate in a similar way as described above. * The ideal depth of the stream buffer is something that is subject to experimentation against various benchmarks and depends on the rest of the microarchitecture involved. Another pattern of prefetching instructions is to prefetch addresses that are s addresses ahead in the sequence. It is mainly used when the consecutive blocks that are to be prefetched are s addresses apart. This is termed as Strided Prefetching.  Methods of software prefetching  = Compiler directed prefetching = Compiler directed prefetching is widely used within loops with a large number of iterations. In this technique, the compiler predicts future cache misses and inserts a prefetch instruction based on the miss penalty and execution time of the instructions. These prefetches are non-blocking memory operations, i.e. these memory accesses do not interfere with actual memory accesses. They do not change the state of the processor or cause page faults. One main advantage of software prefetching is that it reduces the number of compulsory cache misses. The following example shows the how a prefetch instruction will be added into a code to improve cache performance. Consider a for loop as shown below: for (int i=0; i<1024; i++) { array1[i] = 2 * array1[i]; } At each iteration, the ith element of the array \\"array1\\" is accessed. Therefore, we can prefetch the elements that are going to be accessed in future iterations by inserting a \\"prefetch\\" instruction as shown below: for (int i=0; i<1024; i++) { prefetch (array1 [i + k]); array1[i] = 2 * array1[i]; } Here, the prefetch stride, k depends on two factors, the cache miss penalty and the time it takes to execute a single iteration of the for loop. For instance, if one iteration of the loop takes 7 cycles to execute, and the cache miss penalty is 49 cycles then we should have k = 49/7 = 7 \\\\- which means that we prefetch 7 elements ahead. With the first iteration, i will be 0, so we prefetch the 7th element. Now, with this arrangement, the first 7 accesses (i=0->6) will still be misses (under the simplifying assumption that each element of array1 is in a separate cache line of its own).  Comparison of hardware and software prefetching  * While software prefetching requires programmer or compiler intervention, hardware prefetching requires special hardware mechanisms. * Software prefetching works well only with loops where there is regular array access as the programmer has to hand code the prefetch instructions. Whereas, hardware prefetchers work dynamically based on the program's behavior at runtime. * Hardware prefetching also has less CPU overhead when compared to software prefetching.  Metrics of cache prefetching  There are three main metrics to judge cache prefetching = Coverage = Coverage is the fraction of total misses that are eliminated because of prefetching, i.e. Coverage = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Cache Misses eliminated by Prefetching}}{\\\\text{Total Cache Misses}}, where, \\\\text{Total Cache Misses} = (\\\\text{Cache misses eliminated by prefetching}) + (\\\\text{Cache misses not eliminated by prefetching}) = Accuracy = Accuracy is the fraction of total prefetches that were useful - i.e. the ratio of the number of memory addresses prefetched were actually referenced by the program to the total prefetches done. \\\\text{Prefetch Accuracy} = \\\\frac{\\\\text{Cache Misses eliminated by prefetching}}{(\\\\text{Useless Cache Prefetches}) + (\\\\text{Cache Misses eliminated by prefetching})} While it appears that having perfect accuracy might imply that there are no misses, this is not the case. The prefetches themselves might result in new misses if the prefetched blocks are placed directly into the cache. Although these may be a small fraction of the total number of misses we might see without any prefetching, this is a non-zero number of misses. = Timeliness = The qualitative definition of timeliness is how early a block is prefetched versus when it is actually referenced. An example to further explain timeliness is as follows : Consider a for loop where each iteration takes 3 cycles to execute and the 'prefetch' operation takes 12 cycles. This implies that for the prefetched data to be useful, we must start the prefetch 12/3 = 4 iterations prior to its usage to maintain timeliness.

The Ghetto was really intended to act as a business venture for the Medici family, and it had no intentions of attempting to force Jews to convert to Christianity. Although life for Jews in the Florentine Ghetto was at times rough due to economic circumstances and constant degradation from non-Jews, it was considered a much less violent and hostile environment than other Ghettos that formed around Italy before and after. The Florentine Ghetto was technically active for 264 years.  Role of the Medici family in the creation of the Florentine Ghetto  Giovanni Medici, along with his son Cosimo the Elder and grandson Piero the Gouty, rose in society from simple shopkeepers up to international bankers. The Medici family consistently involved themselves in government affairs, again slowly moving further and further up the totem pole of politics. The Medici family arrived in Florence to a city in political and social shambles; the city itself was in the midst of conflict with many of the cities and towns surrounding it. Generation after generation went by as the Medici family continued to overpower and take over rival empires with similar goals in mind. It did not take long before the Medici's became the superior power of the territory around Florence. The Medici estate that was built in Florence grew to become almost twenty times the space that the Jewish Ghetto came to occupy. A Medici Grand Duke by the name of Francesco I became a co-founder of the Florentine Ghetto.  Creation of the Ghetto  The Florentine Ghetto was officially developed in 1571 by the Medici family as a private real estate endeavor. The ghetto was constructed on the basis that rent would be set high in order to draw high profits on the investments. The purpose of the Ghetto was not to attempt to convert the Jews to Christianity. Many people who follow Western Christian ideals have been led to believe that the Jews were moved into a ghetto specifically in this area because the land had been known as having been previously inhabited by prostitutes and whores. The majority of Jews that came to live in the Florentine Ghetto were arriving from one of the previously dissolved Medici settlements. For the Medici family, the creation of the Florentine Ghetto was considered just another business deal in which they took advantage of the Jews by forcing them into bidding wars for the small and cramped properties that were made available in the Ghetto. Before the creation of this Ghetto, there had been almost no presence of Jews in Tuscany, with the exception of the higher class. On a sign over the Florentine Ghetto which read \\"segregate but not expel\\", which is an important aspect to the reasoning of the Medici family behind the creation of the Ghetto; they aspired to make as much possible income off of the Jews as possible while creating as little of an economic and social interruption between the Jews and Christians of Florence. Because the Ghetto is seen as more of a business venture than anything else, it was built less through a natural process of economic shifts and changes in demographics and more through the Jews dire need to relocate after the fall of other Medici settlements. Refugees from over twenty towns relocated into the Florentine Ghetto almost involuntarily, which is why the creation of the Ghetto is said to have been built \\"artificially\\". = Ghetto structure = The Florentine Ghetto itself, which was made up of almost 500 men, women and children, was constructed in the center of the Tuscan capital. It consisted of a piazza (center place) and a narrow street that were enclosed by gates that shut every night. The population of the Ghetto compiled less than 1% of Florence's total population of around 60,000. Geographically, the Ghetto was just north of the Mercato Vecchio, which became a positive attribute later on for the many Jews who were involved in trading. Physically, the Ghetto did not look much different than any other nook in a large city, with the exception of the large gates on either end. The physical appearance of the Ghetto was intentionally created to show that the presence of the Jews in that area was merely insignificant to the people on the outside. \\"The Ghetto was designed to be seen as simultaneously powerful, functional, and unobtrusive.\\" As previously stated, Cosimo I, a man of the Medici family who contributed most to the Ghetto's construction, emphasized the importance of the Jews working with the commerce within their own enclosed area while still remaining inconspicuous to those who were not living there.  Life in the Ghetto  = Physical markers = Soon after the creation of the Ghetto, the Medici decided that an effective way to distinguish between Jews and non-Jews of Florence was to not only segregate the Jews, but by forcing them to wear physical markers that further set them apart from the people living outside of the Ghetto's gates. The branding that the Jews were subjected to differed between males and females; males were required to wear hats made out of any yellow fabric at all hours of the day, while females were required to wear shirts with yellow right sleeves. The implications of Jews not abiding by these \\"dress code\\" rules were high. However, many Jews chose to accept the risks of not following these laws because of the vast difference in treatment that they received by non-Jews under different physical circumstances. Some Jews, however, were able to find loopholes in the dress code system. For example, a Jewish banker named Prospero Marino requested and petitioned wearing the yellow cap by claiming that it hindered the success of his business activities. \\"The yellow badge was certainly a sign of Jewishness ‚Äì but even more, it was a sign of poverty and powerlessness.\\" For the majority of Jews in the Florentine Ghetto who were forced into wearing this segno, (\\"sign\\" or \\"mark\\"), they soon approached a multitude of difficulties when it came to establishing themselves in the world of commerce because of how hesitant non-Jews were to implementing business relationships with them. = Interaction with non-Jews = Although the Ghetto as a physical entity within the city of Florence was blocked off by gates, this did not originally deter Christians and Jews from intermingling for social or economic purposes. \\"No permission was needed for Jews to leave it or for Christians to enter it\\" As time went on, life for Jews in the Florentine Ghetto became more difficult in terms of their ability to sustain relationships with non-Jews (especially in the general social sense - which was known as conversazione) thanks to laws passed by Jewish authorities in 1608 and 1620. The first law outlined that no one living outside of the Ghetto could attend any type of festivities that were happening on the inside unless invited formally by the host of the event. The latter prevented Jews from taking part in even the most mundane social activities with non-Jews, like eating, drinking and gambling. Similar to the punishments that Jews incurred from failing to wear the yellow badges, punishments from Jews who decided to be involved in sexual relationships with non-Jews were public humiliation and jail-time. = Political affairs = Once the Jews arrived in the Ghetto in 1571, the Medici provided them with a reasonable amount of freedom to manage their own political affairs. There were two magistrates that were in charge of overseeing all of these affairs inside the Ghetto: The Nine Preservers of the Florentine Dominion and Jurisdiction and The Eight Magistrates for the Protection and Supervision of the City of Florence. Within the Ghetto, only a limited number of men were given the freedom to represent themselves in the political sphere, by attending meetings, being allowed to vote, and being given the ability to hold positions in office. However, for the majority of men and women were not given these types of political representation in the Ghetto or beyond. The chosen people that were given the right to political representation within the Florentine Ghetto had the job of acting as spokesmen for the rest of the Ghetto community that had no voice. Social status for men in the Ghetto was largely determined by age, with provenance and lineage following close behind. Men who came from wealthier families had the political advantage of being able to run for governor earlier than men from middle-class families. The role of governor involved having the authority to write laws and make decisions in the best interest of the Ghetto. Jews who served in the Ghetto government were looked upon with a special status in the eyes of the rest of the Ghetto population. = General life = Although the Florentine Ghetto was not nearly one of the worst ghettos to live in of the time, the everyday living conditions were still not favorable. Tensions were often high between Jews living in the Ghetto because of the high amount of intra-community competition that occurred in order for the Jews to get through each day. Author and scholar Edward Goldberg claims that \\"tensions often boiled over, and sometimes the police had to take notice ‚Äì but for every Ghetto incident that came to trial, many others certainly did not.\\" Another large factor that contributed to the often petty fights between Jews was the fact that the Ghetto itself was so small and enclosed. The tensions among Jews were even sensed at times among Christians, highlighted in Goldberg's book where she writes \\"Even the Christian magistrates could sometimes feel the tension building, then erupting at night after the gates of the Ghetto were shut\\". Because the Jews, unlike Christians living outside the Ghetto, were always highly suspected of moral and general wrongdoings, they easily developed inferior reputations for partaking in the same misdemeanors as their Christian counterparts. Despite Jews in the Ghetto having high ambitions for their employment opportunities, (and being qualified for these positions), they often found it difficult to succeed in becoming anything other than just a merchant or trader because of their religious affiliation. (Goldberg ?) The Jews in the Ghetto were not a wealthy group. According to their status in the guilds, most of the Jewish men in the Ghetto fell into the lower ranks of membership, and if their incomes were comparable to those of other artisans, they probably earned between 20 and 40 scudi. = Practice of faith = Luckily for the Jews of the Florentine Ghetto, there was already an official synagogue built for them upon their arrival in 1571 and later. This synagogue was one of the more beneficial aspects of the Ghetto; it served as a helpful method for many Jews who were struggling to reassimilate into a completely new area and lifestyle. Benedetto Blanis, a Florentine Jew who documented much of his time in the Ghetto through letters written to Don Giovanni dei Medici, once wrote in regard to the hardships of religion in the Ghetto, \\"As you also know, the room is where I do my preaching every Saturday. The courtyard in question is very small, measuring roughly 4 braccia [7.65 feet], and they set out tables there, so there is much insolence from drunken and impertinent people and much scandalous behavior\\". While Blanis in this letter was hoping for more space for casual prayer, most Jews could just rely on the main Ghetto synagogue, also called the scoula or sinagoghe, for more organized prayer. In terms of its physical appearance, the synagogue was extremely plain and inconspicuous, which was considered a stark contrast from the lavishly decorated churches that the Christians living just outside the Ghetto were used to. An important aspect of the Ghetto's synagogue, which made it similar to synagogues established in other areas, was the emphasis on separation of the sexes during prayer. The scoula was not only a place of worship, however. Because of its central location within the Ghetto, the synagogue also acted as a pseudo \\"town hall\\", where laws were formed, bids on properties were made, leaders were elected, and other official businesses were conducted. \\"Not only was the scoula a place of prayer and reflection, it was the seat of Ghetto government and the nexus of local power and prestige\\". = Economy = The Jews that lived in the Florentine Ghetto were restricted to the jobs that they could uphold, which in turn immensely affected their abilities to succeed into breaking the lower-middle class barriers that were in place for them. Economic activity within the Ghetto consisted almost solely of the selling of crafts and commerce in small shops. The Ghetto was geographically situated in close proximity to the Via dei Rigattieri, also known as the Street of the Second-hand dealers. Similar to this street, the Ghetto became known for its merchants selling scraps and second-hand products. To the benefit of Jewish shopkeepers, the Ghetto was also conveniently located in the middle of the Mercato Vecchio, which was one of Florence's largest and most populated markets. As a result of its location, the Ghetto became \\"an integral part of the city's shopping district - or so it seemed to the Christian bargain hunters who dropped in during business hours to buy things on the cheap.\\" Despite the obvious benefits that this situation poses, the Jews were still underwhelmed with their limited options in terms of occupations, especially during this time where the Ghetto was extremely straining on allowing the Jews to live a high quality of life.  Abolition  The gates of the Florentine Ghetto, which served to keep Jews in and Christians out, began to lose their function around 1755. Authorities that were in charge of inspecting the gates at midnight slowly stopped doing so. Around this time, the official obligation for the gate to be closed at midnight ended, however the Jews of the Ghetto still chose to perform this duty themselves for around 80 more years. On June 9, 1779, Jacob Bassano of Livorno, Angelo di Vita Finzi, and the two Rimini brothers David Salomone and Mois√® Vita of Florence, who were the highest bidders, bought the Florentine Ghetto for 34,584 scudi. Although the Ghetto was purchased in 1779, the Jewish Council (Consiglio Israelitico) decided to officially stop closing the Ghetto gates at midnight in 1834. This action led to protests of Jews living in the Ghetto, who were apprehensive about their only source of protection for the schools, shops and homes no longer being enforced. In the Jewish Council's memorandum on the issue, it mentioned that \\"though it was the need to cut expenses, including the doorkeeper's salary, they also claimed the Jews' right to abandon a custom that recalled periods of humiliation and shame.\\" Approximately one year after the Jewish Council decided to stop closing the Ghetto gates, in 1835, the gates became permanently attached to the side walls of the Ghetto. The Florentine police had no objections to this action, and at that time, the Florentine Ghetto officially ceased to exist.  Contributions to Jewish development  The Florentine Ghetto was more than just a relocation of a group of people from one Medici empire to another. The presence of the Ghetto had a significant impact on the economic and political state of not only the Jews of the time but the Jews to come. Literary scholar Stefanie B. Siegmund described the impact of the Ghetto as \\"an event which both symbolically and quite literally shiften and redefined the boundaries between Jews and Christians\\". When the Jews became emancipated in Italy, they witnessed all of their previous traditions, including the restrictions that came with them, disappear completely as they were replaced with more modernized traditions that better reflected the Jews' shift in their roles in society. After its abolition, the ghetto system became remembered as a lifestyle which was methodical and conventional in every aspect of life: economically, socially, religiously and legally. \\"The birth of the ghetto as a place of enforced habitation, one of the aberrations of the modern era, paradoxically was also a catalyst for the development of Jewish ceremonial art in Italy\\".

A member of the Democratic Alliance (DA), South Africa's official opposition, he has served at various times in the local, provincial and national tiers of his country's government. He was the longest-serving member of the North West Provincial Legislature before moving to the National Council of Provinces, the upper house of the national parliament in Cape Town, in 2015. He was the DA candidate for a municipal by-election that was held on 18 September 2019. He lost to the Freedom Front Plus candidate. Background A direct descendant of the Stellenbosch landowner Hans Heinrich Hattingh, Hattingh was born in Potchefstroom. He completed his school career at the Potchefstroom Gymnasium and did basic military training at the 4th Field Regiment and the School of Artillery. He served as a Citizen Force officer in various positions in the Regiment Potchefstroom University and finally for seven years as the commanding officer. He started practising as a community pharmacist in Potchefstroom after obtaining a B.Sc. (Pharm) degree at the Potchefstroom University ‚Äì a career he pursued until 1999.People's Assembly Career in politics Upon first entering politics, Hattingh managed to win a seat on the Potchefstroom City Council in 1988 as an independent candidate, defeating his opponent from the National Party, the dominant party in the town at the time. He was re-elected on the same basis in 1995. He joined the Democratic Party, a previously small party that was on a rapid upward curve in minority constituencies, in 1998. This gave the DP its first elected seat in the North West. By 1999, Hattingh was elected provincial leader of the DP and was elected to the provincial legislature later the same year. He would hold both positions for 16 years. The party was renamed Democratic Alliance in 2000. Hattingh led the North West DA to consistent growth in each national election, improving the party's position from the 1 seat earned in 1999 to win 4 seats in 2014. During his tenure the DA even briefly governed Tlokwe Local Municipality, which included Potchefstroom, in 2013 after their political opponents were divided by infighting. The move to take control of Tlokwe had been championed by his daughter Juanita, who was serving under him as the DA's constituency leader for Tlokwe at the time. Hattingh finally decided to step down as provincial leader in 2015, and left the legislature later the same year. Despite having been a firm critic of the governing African National Congress, he received a warm farewell from ANC officials, who commended him for his institutional knowledge and support to newer members. After four years in the National Council of Provinces, he retired from the legislature in Cape Town and returned to Potchefstroom. He was the DA's candidate for a by- election that was held on 18 September 2019. The Freedom Front Plus won the ward.Montsho, Molaole.
