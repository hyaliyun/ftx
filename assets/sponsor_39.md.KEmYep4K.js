Biography Emerging from the city's improvised music scene, in the 1990s he became one of the world's pre-eminent prepared guitar players. Since then his work has expanded to include electroacoustic compositions and live electronic music made with laptop computers and analog modular synthesizers. His early recordings contain mostly sparse, quiet sounds; recent works have been more loud and dense. Drumm has collaborated with many artists working in similar fields, including Japanese guitarist Taku Sugimoto, multi- instrumentalist and producer Jim O'Rourke, and many European improvisers such as Swedish saxophonist Mats Gustafsson and German trumpeter Axel Dörner. He has also worked with the artist group Simparch, composing a piece for their installation Spec, shown at Documenta XI in Kassel, Germany and at the Renaissance Society in Chicago. Drumm has also worked with saxophonist Ken Vandermark's Territory Band, which brings together American and European players who work in both jazz and free improvisation. Drumm has received a Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists award (2011).

This enables the device to be bent or rolled while still operating. Currently the focus of research in industrial and academic groups, flexible OLEDs form one method of fabricating a rollable display. Technical details and applications An OLED emits light due to the electroluminescence of thin films of organic semiconductors approximately 100 nm thick. Regular OLEDs are usually fabricated on a glass substrate, but by replacing glass with a flexible plastic such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) among others, OLEDs can be made both bendable and lightweight. Such materials may not be suitable for comparable devices based on inorganic semiconductors due to the need for lattice matching and the high temperature fabrication procedure involved. In contrast, flexible OLED devices can be fabricated by deposition of the organic layer onto the substrate using a method derived from inkjet printing, allowing the inexpensive and roll-to- roll fabrication of printed electronics. Flexible OLEDs may be used in the production of rollable displays, electronic paper, or bendable displays which can be integrated into clothing, wallpaper or other curved surfaces. Prototype displays have been exhibited by companies such as Sony, which are capable of being rolled around the width of a pencil. Disadvantages Both flexible substrate itself as well as the process of bending the device introduce stress into the materials. There may be residual stress from the deposition of layers onto a flexible substrate, thermal stresses due to the different coefficient of thermal expansion of materials in the device, in addition to the external stress from the bending of the device. Stress introduced into the organic layers may lower the efficiency or brightness of the device as it is deformed, or cause complete breakdown of the device altogether. Indium tin oxide (ITO), the material most commonly used as the transparent anode, is brittle. Fracture of the anode can occur which can increase the sheet resistance of the ITO or disrupt the layered structure of the OLED. Although ITO is the most common and best understood anode material used in OLEDs, research has been undertaken into alternative materials that are better suited for flexible applications including carbon nanotubes. Encapsulation is another challenge for flexible OLED devices. The materials in an OLED are sensitive to air and moisture which lead to degradation of the materials themselves as well as quenching of excited states within the molecule. The common method of encapsulation for regular OLEDs is to seal the organic layer between glass. Flexible encapsulation methods are generally not as effective a barrier to air and moisture as glass, and current research aims to improve the encapsulation of flexible organic light emitting diodes.

The church was largely destroyed in the Second World War and the ruins are now a public garden. History St Dunstan-in-the-East inside (2014) The church was originally built in about 1100. A new south aisle was added in 1391 and the church was repaired in 1631 at a cost of more than £2,400. It was severely damaged in the Great Fire of London in 1666.\\"The City Churches\\" Tabor, M. p72:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917 Rather than being completely rebuilt, the damaged church was patched up between 1668 and 1671.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C; Weinreb,D; Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) A steeple was added in 1695–1701 to the designs of Sir Christopher Wren. It was built in a gothic style sympathetic to main body of the church, though with heavy string courses of a kind not used in the Middle Ages. It has a needle spire carried on four flying buttresses in the manner of that of St Nicholas in Newcastle. The restored church had wooden carvings by Grinling Gibbons and an organ by Father Smith, which was transferred to the abbey at St Albans in 1818. In 1817 it was found that the weight of the nave roof had thrust the walls seven inches out of the perpendicular. It was decided to rebuild the church from the level of the arches, but the state of the structure proved so bad that the whole building was taken down. It was rebuilt to a design in the perpendicular style by David Laing (then architect to the Board of Customs) with assistance from William Tite. The foundation stone was laid in November 1817 and the church re-opened for worship in January 1821. Built of Portland stone, with a plaster lierne nave vault, it was 115 feet long and 65 feet wide and could accommodate between six and seven hundred people. The cost of the work was £36,000. Wren's tower was retained in the new building. The church was severely damaged in the Blitz of 1941. Wren's tower and steeple survived the bombs' impact. Of the rest of the church only the north and south walls remained. In the re- organisation of the Anglican Church in London following the War it was decided not to rebuild St Dunstan's, and in 1967 the City of London Corporation decided to turn the ruins of the church into a public garden, which opened in 1971. A lawn and trees were planted in the ruins, with a low fountain in the middle of the nave. The tower now houses the All Hallows House Foundation. St Dunstan's in 1891 The parish is now combined with the Benefice of All Hallows by the Tower and occasional open-air services are held in the church, such as on Palm Sunday prior to a procession to All Hallows by the Tower along St Dunstan's Hill and Great Tower Street. The ruin was designated a Grade I listed building on 4 January 1950.

Aker served as president of the Drake Navigators Guild in California, which promotes Drake and his explorations. It was the work of Aker that helped ensure that Drake received credit for the discovery of Cape Horn, at the southern tip of South America. Biography Aker was born in Yonkers, New York and grew up in Atherton, California. He was interested in sailing from an early age, and developed a hobby of making models and paintings of ships. He continued this hobby throughout his life, making detailed drawings and models of ships. At age nineteen in 1939, he enrolled in the California Nautical School. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, his class was graduated early in 1942 class. Aker become a deck officer on troop transport ships with Matson Lines. After World War II, he worked for 29 years at Westinghouse on projects that include the Polaris missile and ship propeller design. He also continued to develop his skills as a navigator and mariner. He developed a fascination with Drake and used his own nautical skills to reconstruct Drake's 1577-1580 circumnavigation of the globe, during which Drake landed on the west coast of North America and founded a temporary colony of New Albion at a still undetermined spot, possibly in Northern California. Like many in the Drake Navigators Guild, Aker was a proponent of the theory that Drake landed at what is now called Drakes Bay in Marin County, California, north of San Francisco. To support his theory, Aker spent many years analyzing the variation in the tides in the cove called Drakes Estero. Critics of the Drakes Estero theory have maintained that the geography of the cove does not match the descriptions in the journals of those on the voyage, or the map made from voyage accounts by Jodocus Hondius. Aker maintained that the cove geography was cyclic over decades, and in 2001 he correctly predicted the reemergence of a spit in the cove which he claimed closely matched the contemporary accounts of Drake's landing spot. He led a longtime effort to lobby the National Park Service to designate Drakes Bay as a National Historic Landmark. That effort came to fruition in 2012 with the establishment of the Drakes Bay Historic and Archaeological District National Historic Landmark. As part of his study of Drake's circumnavigation, Aker became convinced that Drake was the true discoverer of Cape Horn, rather than Dutch explorer Willem Schouten, who was thought to have discovered it in 1616. Most historians at the time believed that Drake landed on Henderson Island northwest of Cape Horn. In 1997 the American National Maritime Historical Society accepted Aker's argument that it Drake who first discovered Cape Horn. The argument was also accepted by the National Geographic Society. Aker also became convinced that the partial remains of Drake's ship the Golden Hinde, are buried at the old Deptford Navy Yard along the Thames in east London.

It was a small company- owned asbestos mining town located in the Cassiar Mountains of Northern British Columbia north of Dease Lake. History The discovery of asbestos in the area in 1950 led to the founding of the Cassiar Asbestos Company in the following year. The town was established in 1952, the same year the mining operation began. By the 1970s Cassiar had a population of 1,500 and had two schools, two churches, a small hospital, theatre, swimming pool, recreation centre and hockey rink. By the early 1990s, diminished demand for asbestos and expensive complications faced after converting from an open-pit mine to an underground mine made the continued operation of the mine unprofitable. In 1992, Cassiar Asbestos decided to close the mine and liquidate its assets, including the town of Cassiar itself. Most of the contents of the town, including a few houses, were auctioned off and trucked away. Most of the remaining dwellings were bulldozed and burned to the ground. The mill was briefly reactivated in 1999 by Cassiar Chrysotile Inc which had a reclamation permit to clean up the site. 11,000 tons of asbestos were exported before the mill burned down on Christmas Day of 2000, effectively halting all production. Today the streets are bare and flowers bloom where the houses once stood. Residents living between the townsite and the Stewart-Cassiar Highway, and on the highway itself, who originally obtained phone service from the Cassiar exchange, were moved to the nearby Good Hope Lake exchange in fall 2006 and the Cassiar exchange shut down. Neglected and in disrepair, the hockey arena collapsed in 2008, with the church following in 2015. The tramline which transported ore from the mine down the mountainside to the mill was purchased in the auction however the buyer left it, and it still stands. The four old apartment blocks at the east end of town are operational for ongoing site reclamation work. They are currently being utilized as of November 2006 by mining exploration companies conducting underground gold mining at Table Mountain (formerly Erickson Gold) and base metal exploration in the immediate area. There is also seasonal jade mining from the Cassiar waste dumps. Climate Cassiar has a subarctic climate (Köppen climate classification Dfc) with long, cold, and snowy winters and short, cool summers.

It is one of the three surviving timber-framed houses in the city (the others being the Old Queen's Head and Broom Hall). It is known as Bishops' House because it was said to have been built for two brothers, John and Geoffrey Blythe, both of whom became Bishops. There is, however, no evidence that they ever lived in this house—the first known resident is William Blythe, a farmer and scythe manufacturer, who was living here in 1627. Samuel Blyth was the last of the family to live in the house, dying in 1753, after which his sons sold the house to a William Shore. The Blyth family subsequently moved to Birmingham.Blyth, E.L.I. 1893, The family of Blythe or Blyth of Norton and Birchet Notable descendants were Benjamin Blyth, Sir Arthur Blyth and Benjamin Blyth II. The house was subsequently let to a tenant farmer and his labourer, at which point the house was sub-divided into two dwellings. In 1886 ownership passed to the Corporation (Sheffield City Council) and various recreation department employees lived in the house until 1974. It is a Grade II* listed building and has been open as a museum since 1976, following a renovation funded by English Heritage and Sheffield City Council. The Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust managed the building for some years until April 2011, when management of public opening, on behalf of the building's owner Sheffield City Council, was conferred to the Friends of Bishops' House. The building is open to the public on Saturdays and Sundays between 10am and 4pm. In April 2012 Sheffield Galleries and Museums Trust stopped providing educational visits and the Friends of Bishops' House began opening the house to schools also. The displays in the house have had some recent small changes but are still curated by Museums Sheffield. The Friends of Bishops' House is a registered charity and limited company, run entirely by volunteers. The house contains exhibitions on life in the 16th and 17th centuries with two rooms decorated in Jacobean style.

Srinivasan (PKS) (4 November 1924 – 20 June 2005) was a well known mathematics teacher in India. He taught mathematics at the Muthialpet High School in Chennai, India until his retirement. His singular dedication to education of mathematics would bring him to the United States, where he worked for a year, and then to Nigeria, where he would work for six years. He is known in India for his dedication to teaching mathematics and in creating pioneering awareness of the Indian mathematician Ramanujan. He has authored several books in English, Telugu and Tamil that introduce mathematics to children in novel and interesting ways. He was also a prominent reviewer of math books in the weekly Book Review column of the Indian newspaper The Hindu in Chennai.  Experience  PKS, as he was known to the world-at-large, among his colleagues, students and friends, travelled to the United States as a Fulbright exchange teacher and worked in Liverpool Central School, New York, in 1965-'66. Later he served as a Senior education officer and a Senior lecturer in Mathematics in Nigeria for seven years. He served as a lecturer in the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) in India. He organized over sixty math expositions and fairs in India, Nigeria and the United States, and participated actively in four International Congress on Mathematical Education (ICME) conferences. He inspired many a creative idea and gave them shape through demonstrative displays by his students. Conduct of Bharat Dharshan, World Exhibition, three-day three-tier Math Expositions to make all his math students walk across the curriculum which was highly talked about in his days and research papers on subjects from English to Social Studies by students studying from 7 to 12 Standards was an everlasting contribution made by him to the students and to The Muthialpet High School, Chennai where he was a teacher par excellence. He could pick the brightest of students and discuss esoteric topics such as Boolean algebra, Ramanujan's theorems and at same time deploy easy-to-understand teaching tools for teaching mathematics and English. As a class teacher, he could reach across to the poorest performers and made them cross average levels in English and mathematics. Although he hailed from a traditional family, he was always clad in a white kurta and dhoti spun out of khadi - rough and homespun cotton cloth that symbolized the Swadeshi concept of Gandhiji. He sported a Gandhian cap as well. His vision and unquenchable thirst for knowledge transcended the narrow barriers of caste, language and religion. Personal and family interests always took a backseat in his mission for spreading knowledge and awareness and imparting a sense of purpose in his students to go beyond the narrow frontiers of a syllabus-oriented formal education to exploration of the unfathomable depths of knowledge. He displayed the same missionary zeal in making classroom education and teaching of English and mathematics in particular a matter of fun and curiosity among the low-mark scoring students as well. In addition, he was the founder and the curator-director of Ramanujan Museum & Math Education CentreRamanujan Museum & Math Education Centre which he helped establish in 1993. He was also one of the founders of the Association of Mathematics Teachers of India (AMTI) in 1965.  Honours  He was awarded the National Science Award by the Government of India in 1991 and a State Award by the Tamil Nadu Science and Technology Centre for popularisation of mathematics education to enable children to learn mathematics with interest and enthusiasm.  Philosophy  He advocated the use of no cost teaching aids and no cost, no material teaching aids, improvising them to illustrate mathematical concepts whenever they are introduced and almost lead a crusade against the mere rote learning techniques and drill. He also indicated the efficacy of introducing non-routine thinking when the child can grasp, using the concepts introduced, leading to problem solving techniques and innovative strategies.  Memorial Meeting  A meeting to pay homage to his memory was organised on 8 July 2005 by AMTI in the Dakshinamoorthy auditorium of the P.S. Higher Secondary School in Mylapore, Chennai. Many speakers who were his associates, admirers, friends and relatives spoke of the momentum he brought to the movement of mathematics education in the country. It was mentioned by more than one speaker at that time that the best tribute to his memory would be for mathematics teachers to make mathematics learning interesting for the children.

In computer programming, a rope, or cord, is a data structure composed of smaller strings that is used to efficiently store and manipulate a very long string. For example, a text editing program may use a rope to represent the text being edited, so that operations such as insertion, deletion, and random access can be done efficiently. Description A rope is a binary tree where each leaf (end node) holds a string and a length (also known as a \\"weight\\"), and each node further up the tree holds the sum of the lengths of all the leaves in its left subtree. A node with two children thus divides the whole string into two parts: the left subtree stores the first part of the string, the right subtree stores the second part of the string, and a node's weight is the length of the first part. For rope operations, the strings stored in nodes are assumed to be constant immutable objects in the typical nondestructive case, allowing for some copy-on-write behavior. Leaf nodes are usually implemented as basic fixed-length strings with a reference count attached for deallocation when no longer needed, although other garbage collection methods can be used as well. Operations In the following definitions, N is the length of the rope. = Insert = : Definition: \`Insert(i, S’)\`: insert the string S’ beginning at position i in the string s, to form a new string . : Time complexity: . This operation can be done by a \`Split()\` and two \`Concat()\` operations. The cost is the sum of the three. = Index = Figure 2.1: Example of index lookup on a rope. : Definition: \`Index(i)\`: return the character at position i : Time complexity: To retrieve the i-th character, we begin a recursive search from the root node: function index(RopeNode node, integer i) if node.weight <= i and exists(node.right) then return index(node.right, i - node.weight) end if exists(node.left) then return index(node.left, i) end return node.string[i] end For example, to find the character at in Figure 2.1 shown on the right, start at the root node (A), find that 22 is greater than 10 and there is a left child, so go to the left child (B). 9 is less than 10, so subtract 9 from 10 (leaving ) and go to the right child (D). Then because 6 is greater than 1 and there's a left child, go to the left child (G). 2 is greater than 1 and there's a left child, so go to the left child again (J). Finally 2 is greater than 1 but there is no left child, so the character at index 1 of the short string \\"na\\", is the answer. = Concat = Figure 2.2: Concatenating two child ropes into a single rope. : Definition: \`Concat(S1, S2)\`: concatenate two ropes, S1 and S2, into a single rope. : Time complexity: (or time to compute the root weight) A concatenation can be performed simply by creating a new root node with and , which is constant time. The weight of the parent node is set to the length of the left child S1, which would take time, if the tree is balanced. As most rope operations require balanced trees, the tree may need to be re-balanced after concatenation. = Split = Figure 2.3: Splitting a rope in half. : Definition: \`Split (i, S)\`: split the string S into two new strings S1 and S2, and . : Time complexity: There are two cases that must be dealt with: # The split point is at the end of a string (i.e. after the last character of a leaf node) # The split point is in the middle of a string. The second case reduces to the first by splitting the string at the split point to create two new leaf nodes, then creating a new node that is the parent of the two component strings. For example, to split the 22-character rope pictured in Figure 2.3 into two equal component ropes of length 11, query the 12th character to locate the node K at the bottom level. Remove the link between K and G. Go to the parent of G and subtract the weight of K from the weight of D. Travel up the tree and remove any right links to subtrees covering characters past position 11, subtracting the weight of K from their parent nodes (only node D and A, in this case). Finally, build up the newly orphaned nodes K and H by concatenating them together and creating a new parent P with weight equal to the length of the left node K. As most rope operations require balanced trees, the tree may need to be re-balanced after splitting. = Delete = : Definition: \`Delete(i, j)\`: delete the substring , from s to form a new string . : Time complexity: . This operation can be done by two \`Split()\` and one \`Concat()\` operation. First, split the rope in three, divided by i-th and i+j-th character respectively, which extracts the string to delete in a separate node. Then concatenate the other two nodes. = Report = : Definition: \`Report(i, j)\`: output the string . : Time complexity: To report the string , find the node u that contains Ci and , and then traverse T starting at node u. Output by doing an in-order traversal of T starting at node u. Comparison with monolithic arrays { class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" + Performance ! Operation !! Rope !! String - align=\\"center\\"  Index   - align=\\"center\\"  Split   - align=\\"center\\"  Concatenate (destructive)   - align=\\"center\\"  Concatenate (nondestructive)   - align=\\"center\\"  Iterate over each character   - align=\\"center\\"  Insert   - align=\\"center\\"  Append   - align=\\"center\\"  Delete   - align=\\"center\\"  Report   - align=\\"center\\"  Build   } Advantages: * Ropes enable much faster insertion and deletion of text than monolithic string arrays, on which operations have time complexity O(n). * Ropes don't require O(n) extra memory when operated upon (arrays need that for copying operations). * Ropes don't require large contiguous memory spaces. * If only nondestructive versions of operations are used, rope is a persistent data structure. For the text editing program example, this leads to an easy support for multiple undo levels. Disadvantages: * Greater overall space use when not being operated on, mainly to store parent nodes. There is a trade-off between how much of the total memory is such overhead and how long pieces of data are being processed as strings. The strings in example figures above are unrealistically short for modern architectures. The overhead is always O(n), but the constant can be made arbitrarily small. * Increase in time to manage the extra storage * Increased complexity of source code; greater risk of bugs This table compares the algorithmic traits of string and rope implementations, not their raw speed. Array-based strings have smaller overhead, so (for example) concatenation and split operations are faster on small datasets. However, when array-based strings are used for longer strings, time complexity and memory use for inserting and deleting characters becomes unacceptably large. In contrast, a rope data structure has stable performance regardless of data size. Further, the space complexity for ropes and arrays are both O(n). In summary, ropes are preferable when the data is large and modified often.

Lowe had previously been signed to Stiff Records, as had several other Radar acts, including Yachts, Richard Hell and the Voidoids, and Radar's major act, Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Costello and Lowe were brought to Radar by their manager Jake Riviera when Riviera left Stiff, which he had co-founded. Other prominent Radar acts included La Düsseldorf, the Pop Group, Loudon Wainwright III, Pere Ubu, Clive Langer and the Boxes, 999, Wayne Kramer, the Soft Boys, Bette Bright and the Illuminations, Tanz Der Youth, Visage and Métal Urbain. Several of Radar's early releases (including Iggy Pop and James Williamson's Kill City, National Lampoon's That's Not Funny, That's Sick!, the Good Rats' From Rats to Riches and Pezband's Laughing in the Dark) were licensed from independent American labels. Radar also released new albums by original 1950s rockabilly singers Ray Campi and Mac Curtis through an arrangement with Rollin' Rock Records. Some Radar releases were reissues of garage rock and psychedelic rock bands from the 1960s. Through its WEA connections, Radar was able to rerelease recordings by the Shadows of Knight (originally on the Atlantic-distributed Dunwich Records) and the Electric Prunes (originally on the Warner Bros.-distributed Reprise Records). In addition, Radar licensed the International Artists catalog, allowing them to reissue albums by the 13th Floor Elevators and the Red Krayola. Radar also released new recordings by the Red Krayola's late 1970s lineup. The original Radar label put out its last release in 1981, but it was revived with a new roster between 1995 and 1998. Notable bands signed to the second version of Radar included Midget, Prolapse, Acacia, Morning Glories, Heave, and Pure Morning, a precursor of Clinic.

The first and best known software package it produced was Norton Utilities. Another successful software package was Norton Commander, especially the DOS version. In 1990, the company was acquired by Symantec. The acquired company became a division of Symantec and was renamed Peter Norton Computing Group. Most of Norton Computing's 115 employees were retained. The Symantec merger helped Norton Computing regain the market share it was losing to competitors, especially Central Point Software. Norton Computing's revenues tripled between June 1990 and September 1991, and by November it appeared to have regained the market lead over Central Point. History Peter Norton founded the company in 1982 with $30,000 and an IBM computer. The company was a pioneer in DOS- based utilities software. Its 1982 introduction of the Norton Utilities included Norton's UNERASE tool to retrieve erased data from DOS disks. In 1984, Norton Computing reached $1 million in revenue, and version 3.0 of the Norton Utilities was released. Norton had three clerical people working for him. He was doing all of the software development, all of the book writing, all of the manual writing and running the business. The only thing he wasn't doing was stuffing the packages. He hired his fourth employee and first programmer, Brad Kingsbury, in July 1985. John Socha, the author of Norton Commander until 1989, was hired shortly after. From November 1985 until April 1986 Warren Woodford worked at Norton Computing and created Norton Guides.https://www.f6s.com/warrenwoodford In late 1985, Norton hired a business manager to take care of the day-to-day operations.Investigating The Lost Files Of Peter Norton, PC Pioneer, Computers & Electronics, May 1992 In 1985, Norton Computing produced the Norton Editor, a programmer's text editor created by Stanley Reifel, and Norton Guides, a TSR program which showed reference information for assembly language and other IBM PC internals, but could also display other reference information compiled into the appropriate file format. Norton Commander, a file managing tool for DOS, was introduced in 1986. In this year PNCI reached $5 million in revenues with Norton Utilities still bringing the largest parts.

Developed and published by Ubisoft, it was released in November 2003 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2, and GameCube; an Xbox version of the game, released at the same time, was developed by Southend Interactive, while an OS X version was developed by Zonic, published by Feral Interactive, and released the following year in June 2004. Designed with a comic book-style, cel-shaded presentation, the game incorporate single-player and multiplayer game modes. The game's main story focuses a confused and amnesic man who searches for his identity after being found stranded on a beach, and slowly finds themselves caught up in a conspiracy by a group who aim to overthrow the government, having already assassinated the President of the United States, in which the man is wanted by the FBI for the crime. XIII received mixed reviews and made poor sales upon its release, suspending plans for a sequel, but received a cult following. It also received a follow-up game for mobile phones entitled XIII ²: Covert Identity, with a re-imaginging of the game as a point-and-click adventure entitled XIII: Lost Identity being released in October 2011. A planned remake of the original game, aimed for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, is scheduled for intended release in November 2020. Gameplay Gameplay of XIII, illustrating the insets that pops up when a headshot is performed. XIII is a first-person shooter with elements of stealth and action in certain missions. The game centers on the main character, named XIII, who has awakened with amnesia. He uses a variety of weapons and gadgets to uncover the mystery of his identity throughout the 13 chapters and 34 missions. The characters and weaponry in XIII are cel- shaded, giving a deliberately comic book style appearance, including onomatopoeic words contained in bubbles for sound effects. It uses Unreal Engine 2 because it was \\"really strong for level design\\" and allowed development \\"across all platforms using one engine\\". The graphics were compared with Jet Set Radio Future and Auto Modellista. The developer felt that the appearance reflected the comic book and innovated in its portrayal of violence; blood splatters are shown in a cartoon manner. XIII includes 16 weapons, from a knife to a bazooka, an Uzi to an M60. Objects such as bottles, chairs, or brooms may be used as weapons. Kevlar gear, helmets and first aid boxes are scattered throughout the map. People can be taken as hostages or as human shields, preventing enemies from firing on the protagonist. Lock picks are used to unlock doors and grapnels to climb on walls. Through the \\"sixth sense\\", XIII can hear enemies behind walls with the aid of \\"tap-tap-tap\\" signals. Stealth operations include strangling enemies or hiding dead bodies. Comic strip-style insets pop up at the top when a headshot is performed or serve as clues or tips for the player. =Multiplayer= The multiplayer hosts a maximum of 16 players. The game features three standard game modes along with modes exclusive to each system: Team Deathmatch, Deathmatch, Capture the Flag, Sabotage (on Xbox and PC), The Hunt (on PC, PS2 and GameCube), and Power-Up (on PC and PS2). Depending on the platform, players in online and offline modes (against bots) range from 4 to 16. The GameCube version does not have any online modes, while the PC version excludes the multi-screen modes but includes a map editor. There are 13 maps on Deathmatch plus one additional on Team Deathmatch, while 5 on Capture the Flag and 3 on Sabotage. The player can choose from among 10 different character appearances. In Deathmatch, all players compete against each other and the strongest player wins. Team Deathmatch is similar, but players form two teams. In Capture the Flag, a player must retrieve the flag from their enemy's base, and bring it to their own team's base. In Sabotage, one team must place a bomb in three different locations, while the opposite team must protect these areas; the protectors win if the time limit is exceeded (except if the time is set to infinite). The bomb is always found at the beginning of the team base, and the player who holds the bomb must wait 12 seconds until they may drop it and take shelter from the ensuing detonation. In The Hunt, players must shoot ghosts, which become gradually smaller after receiving hits. The player only has one weapon, the hunting gun, with which they can shoot human opponents. Power Up is a deathmatch game, in which boxes containing special, temporary abilities, such as invisibility and higher speed, are found throughout the map. Plot =Setting= The game's setting takes place within the same arrangement as the first five volumes of the 1984 Belgian graphic novel series XIII. While the plot itself borrows major elements from all five volumes to create singular narrative - the attempt to uncover the identities of a group of conspirators seeking to overthrow the US government, and the involvement of a man with no memory to achieve this - the adaptation of the comics features notable differences and situations in various places. =Synopsis= On a beach in Brooklyn, New York City, a man with a gunshot wound is found by a lifeguard. Suffering from amnesia, the man can only recall being shot at while trying to escape from a boat, and learns he possesses a bank deposit key and a tattoo of the Roman numeral XIII on his right shoulder. When men led by a hitman named the Mongoose arrive to kill him, identifying him as XIII, he finds himself forced to escape. Investigating the key leads XIII to a bank where he recalls he was investigating a conspiracy, but had set a trap for those involved that he inadvertently sets off. Forced to escape in the chaos, XIII finds himself arrested outside the bank by the FBI for the assassination of the President of the United States, William Sheridan. Interrogated by the lead investigator, Colonel Amos, the man learns that his face belongs to that of the shooter in the murder, Steve Rowland. After the Mongoose attacks the FBI headquarters, XIII finds himself aided by a female soldier named Jones, whom he remembers working with, and escapes from the city. Jones informs XIII that the pair were working with war veteran General Ben Carrington, who was conducting a parallel investigation into the president's death and had unearthed a conspiracy against the US government. Learning that he was arrested and taken to a base station in the Appalachian mountains, XIII proceeds to rescue him in order to uncover his past. Carrington agrees to help him, but instructs XIII to assist a contact in the Rocky Mountains. XIII meets with the contact who identifies herself as Kim Rowland, and that he is not Rowland; the real Rowland, her husband, died after committing the assassination. Protecting her from the men sent by the Mongoose, XIII is captured following an avalanche and promptly taken away to a mental asylum for examination after the hitman suspects him to be an impostor. XIII manages to escape, killing the asylum's director, before reuniting with Jones. Informed of a meeting taking place in Mexico, XIII find himself sent to eavesdrop on it within the base of a special forces group called SPADS. During his infiltration, XIII recalls his identity as Jason Fly, a squadmate of Rowland. Gathering evidence that the conspiracy involves a coup using SPADS soldiers led by a powerful group, XIII deals with two conspirators, while eliminating a stockpile of weapons meant for the coup. Upon returning to the United States, Carrington rendezvous with XIII alongside Amos, and reveals to both that Sheridan's murder was conceived by Rowland was murdered by the conspirators after the assassination, but survived long enough to contact his wife. Angered by his death, Kim decide to get revenge, and decided to expose the identity of the group and their scheme to the authorities through faking Rowland's survival. Carrington reveals that Fly agreed to assist by undergoing plastic surgery to replicate Rowland's appearance; XIII recalls he had been close to identifying the leader, before something went wrong. With the aid of the FBI, XIII proceeds to uncover the identity of the conspirators, and infiltrates the meeting site of the group to find out how the coup will occur. With sufficient evidence, XIII, Amos, and Carrington meet with William's brother Walter, and explain to him the conspiracy - a group of powerful men in the United States, calling themselves \\"The XX\\" (\\"The Twenty\\") - due to the Roman numerals tattooed onto each member - planned a coup during a war simulation exercise using loyal SPADS soldiers, who would replace US democracy with a totalitarian government. As the coup involves a key military facility, Walter offers assistance to gain entry to the site. Shortly after arriving, XIII finds himself having to protect William's successor when SPADS begin attacking the site, eliminating the remaining members that had not been killed or arrested, before defeating the Mongoose in one final battle. With the coup thwarted, Walter holds a party on his private yacht. While seeking him out, XIII overhears Kim arguing with Walter, and has a flashback that reveals Walter was behind the conspiracy. The game ends on a cliffhanger when Walter finds XIII in his private office, accompanied by armed bodyguards. Development David Duchovny voiced the protagonist Ubi Soft announced on March 13, 2002, that it would be working on a game called XIII. Based on the comic book of the same name by Belgian Jean Van Hamme. The game debuted at an event in Montreal, and was submitted at the 2002 Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2002, with such games as Doom III, Max Payne 2 and Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. On November 22, 2002, Ubi Soft announced a delay of the game. Justin Calvert of GameSpot guessed that the time would be used to thoroughly check the game and implement additional features on other platforms. On May 7, 2003, Ubi Soft announced that singer, actress and model Eve would be the voice for major character Jones. Ubi Soft's vice president of marketing, Tony Kee, stated that she was the perfect choice for the role, admitting that she has \\"a combination of style, sexiness, and attitude—perfect attributes that describe the Jones character.\\" Two months later, two other major voice acts were revealed: David Duchovny would play Jason Fly (XIII), while Adam West, General Carrington. The official site was launched on August 19, featuring videos and information about the gameplay. Ubi Soft implemented a pre-order in September 4, promising a free demonstration version with multiplayer and soundtrack. The game was promoted at the Fall College Tour from September to October. Beginning at Cornell University and finishing at the University of Southern California, the tour featured demonstrations of games, playable via the 50-screen GamePort system. Another demo, multiplayer-only, was issued on October 2, but the discovery of a bug led to its removal. A different fixed demo was released a day later. Xbox players had the opportunity from December 15 on to win one of 50 copies of the game. The campaign was dubbed \\"13 Days to Xmas\\": those who spent not less than 13 hours playing until Christmas were qualified for the contest. The winner was randomly selected on January 9. Soundtrack The Thirteen Soundtrack was composed by several artists from the San Francisco- based music label Future Primitive Sound. 13 tracks were produced, all of which were initially unnamed. According to the booklet, the DJs are connected with the characters, such as DJ Faust and Shortee with XIII, DJ Zeph with Carrington or J-Boogie's Dubtronic Science with Mongoose. The album opens with an introduction and then includes songs in the likes of typical 70s-era music such as soul, funk, jazz, but also hip hop. According to founder and creative director of the collective, Mark Herlihy, the soundtrack project began with Herlihy's friend, Pete Jacobs, whom he met at a gig, five or six years previously. After studying the characters and the story, the group decided on a noir and futuristic style that would reflect the espionage theme. Its rhythm ranges from 105 to 120 bpm. Herlihy later stated that they \\"wanted to capture the essence of XIII in this soundtrack by showcasing its nostalgic style while giving the beats a modern twist\\" and their intention was \\"to tell its story through the music and create a seamless head-nodding mix that would complement the energy of XIII and get gamers hyped.\\" One reviewer of IGN gave the album 8 out of 10 stars, stating: \\"It's an album that works expertly as a chill-out slice of background groove, yet it also doubles as a dance floor jolt of exuberance perfect for spinning at a small party\\", but also stated that the player, understandably, quickly forgets the music while playing. He concluded that the album is \\"jazzaphonic electronic tripped out funkuphoria\\". Reception XIII received \\"mixed or average\\" reviews, according to video game review aggregator Metacritic. Reviewers often praised the game's graphical style and presentation, while criticising the gameplay. GamePro called it a \\"rejuvenating, jaw-dropping experience\\". IGN said \\"XIII has a great story-driven sheen, but at its core, it's weighed down by some occasional bewildering flaws, in addition to the lackluster weapons and simple combat\\". GameZone also criticised the combat, stating \\"If not for the graphics to carry the game through, XIII would have been a boring game. Gunfights are the best part of the gameplay. It also happens to be the most unbalanced part\\". Edge said XIII had \\"true artistic merit: it never gets stale; every episode has been drawn with minute care and attention. It would have been an incredible achievement if the gameplay had matched the outstanding art direction\\". GameSpy criticised the graphics and the multiplayer mode, and concluded \\"When it comes right down to it, XIII is a fine game...Just don't expect the FPS of the year because, sadly, this isn't it\\". GamesTM said \\"It's one of those mixed-bag situations – flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory\\". Eurogamer called XIII \\"a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking from most of the factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity\\". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as \\"about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS\\". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, \\"You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII\\", but complained that \\"numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill\\". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its \\"style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [but] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane\\"; he concluded, \\"But if all you need is a solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going\\". Sales performance for XIII was lower than expected. In 2010, UGO ranked it #7 on the list of the games that need sequels.25 Games That Need Sequels , UGO.com, 23 November 2010 Sequel and remakes While the anticipated sequel on major gaming platforms remained unrealized due to poor sales of the original title, Gameloft released a follow-up on mobile phones titled XIII²: Covert Identity in October 2007, which was a side-scrolling game rather than a first-person shooter. A re-imagining of XIII, called XIII: Lost Identity, was released by Anuman Interactive for Microsoft Windows, iPhone and iPad on November 15, 2011. The game is not a shooter, but a hidden object game. On April 18, 2019, a faithful remake of the original game was announced for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, which is being developed by PlayMagic Ltd and published by Microids. It was originally scheduled for release on November 13, 2019, until it was delayed to 2020 for further development. In June 2020, it was announced that the game is scheduled for release on November 10, 2020.

It was originally released in German, then translated to English for international release. The game features a science fiction setting that incorporates traditional fantasy elements, such as magic. The game was intended to be developed for the Amiga computer, but was developed for DOS instead when Commodore declared bankruptcy. Albion can be considered a spiritual successor to the Amiga role-playing video games Amberstar and Ambermoon, bearing very similar gameplay and developed by the same core team (Erik Simon - design, Jurie Horneman - code, Thorsten Mutschall - graphics, Matthias Steinwachs - sound and music, and Dieter Rottermund - artwork) under the Thalion Software name. The game was re-released in 2015 on Gog.com with support for Windows. Plot In the year 2230, the gigantic, interstellar space ship Toronto emerges from hyperspace at the edge of a distant planetary system. The ship's owners, the multinational DDT corporation, believe that there are rich deposits of raw materials on one of the planets in the system, and the Toronto is to mine the whole planet's resources at once. The player is cast in the role of Tom Driscoll, the pilot of the exploration shuttle sent to verify the status of the planet. His shuttle malfunctions, forcing him to make a crash landing. Tom discovers that the data that described the planet as a desert world was false. Albion is a world teeming with life, secrets, surprises, and magic. It is inhabited by the sentient, tall and slender, feline-like humanoids called Iskai and the many divisions of Celtic humans that traveled magically to the planet in their era. It is up to Driscoll to alert the crew of the Toronto to the true situation to save Albion and its inhabitants. Gameplay Albion is a role-playing video game and features a number of gameplay elements typical of that genre. The player controls a party of up to six characters, each with their own skills and abilities. With these characters they may explore the game world, fight enemies, and engage in conversation or trade. Characters earn experience points by defeating enemies or by solving certain puzzles. When a character has sufficient experience points they will advance in level, increasing their maximum life and spell points. They will also receive training points which can be expended at a trainer to permanently increase one or more of their skills. Albion uses a hybrid 2D/3D graphical system to depict its environments. Most interior locations are shown using a 2D overhead view, centered on the player's party. Movement is possible using either the keyboard or the mouse and the mouse is used to examine or manipulate objects within the reach of the party leader. A similar view is used when exploring the larger world outside the cities, but with objects and characters shown on a much smaller scale. Upon entering most dungeons, caves, and the exteriors of larger cities the game switches to a real-time first-person 3D view. As in the 2D view, players may use the mouse or keyboard to move around and the mouse is used to select objects to interact with. A 2D automap is available to assist navigation in these areas. Combat occurs when the party runs into one or more enemies. The combat system is turn-based and takes place on a five-by-six grid similar to a chess board, with the player's characters arranged at the bottom and their enemies at the top. At the start of each turn, the player selects an action for each character to perform: Attack, Move, Use magic, Use Item, or Flee. The order in which party members and enemies execute their actions depends on their relative speeds and is an important tactical consideration. Since attacks are targeted at a grid square rather than the character or enemy in it, attacks will miss if their intended target moves before they are made, even if that target is still within reach. The movement of the player's characters is limited to the bottom two rows, but there is also an 'Advance Party' option which moves all enemies one row towards the party. Reception Writing for PC Gamer US, Michael Wolf called Albion \\"a fun, engrossing, and involved roleplaying experience\\", with \\"all the elements of a great roleplaying adventure.\\" In Computer Gaming World, Petra Schlunk wrote, \\"I found this lengthy game enjoyable to play and recommend it to lovers of role- playing games when another dry spell hits.\\" The game was a finalist for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Role-Playing Game of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. The reviewer for Next Generation called Albion \\"well-thought out and definitely worth checking out\\", and praised it as a \\"bright spot in the desert\\" of computer role-playing games at the time. Chuck Klimushyn of Computer Games Strategy Plus considered Albion to be \\"a breath of fresh air for the RPG crowd\\", and he wrote that \\"those who cut their teeth on the likes of Might and Magic, Wizardry, and Ultima may find that the future looks a little brighter because of this latest offering from Blue Byte.\\" The magazine later nominated Albion as its 1996 role-playing game of the year. Albion was a runner-up for Computer Game Entertainments 1996 \\"Best Role-Playing Game\\" prize. The magazine's editors wrote, \\"Albion was refreshing, not only because it helped fill a void, but because it carefully balanced story, puzzles, combat and exploration.\\" It was also nominated in this category by CNET Gamecenter, whose editors gave the prize to Meridian 59. Legacy Albion will work on later Windows operating systems, like Windows XP, but tends to perform poorly and run slowly. Using the alternative DOS extender DOS/32ADOS/32A might improve the performance as using a DOS emulator like DOSBox. In 2011 a port for ARM architecture and the Pandora handheld was created by fans via static recompilation from the original x86 binary executable.

It often includes buildings created under English influence or by English architects in other parts of the world, particularly in the English and later British colonies and Empire, which developed into the Commonwealth of Nations. Apart from Anglo-Saxon architecture, the major forms of non-vernacular architecture employed in England before 1900 originated elsewhere in western Europe, chiefly in France and Italy, while 20th-century Modernist architecture derived from both European and American influences. Each of these foreign modes became assimilated within English architectural culture and gave rise to local variation and innovation, producing distinctive national forms. Among the most characteristic styles originating in England are the Perpendicular Gothic of the late Middle Ages, High Victorian Gothic and the Queen Anne style. Prehistoric architecture Stonehenge The earliest known examples of architecture in England are the megalithic tombs of the Neolithic, such as those at Wayland's Smithy and the West Kennet Long Barrow. These cromlechi are common over much of Atlantic Europe: present day Spain; Brittany; Great Britain; and Ireland. Radiocarbon dating has shown them to be, as historian John Davies says, \\"the first substantial, permanent constructions of man and that the earliest of them are nearly 1,500 years older than the first of the pyramids of Egypt.\\" The Neolithic henges of Avebury and Stonehenge are two of the largest and most famous megalithic monuments in the world. The structure is an annual calendar, but the reason for the massive size is unknown with any certainty, suggestions include agriculture, ceremonial use and interpreting the cosmos. With other nearby sites, including Silbury Hill, Beckhampton Avenue, and West Kennet Avenue, they form a UNESCO World Heritage Site called Stonehenge, Avebury and Associated Sites. Numerous examples of Bronze Age and Iron Age architecture can be seen in England. Megalithic burial monuments, either individual barrows (also known, and marked on modern British Ordnance Survey maps, as Tumuli,) or occasionally cists covered by cairns, are one form. The other is the defensive earthworks known as hill forts, such as Maiden Castle and Cadbury Castle. Archaeological evidence suggests that British Iron Age domestic architecture had a tendency towards circular dwellings, known as roundhouses. Roman architecture The Roman period brought the construction of the first large-scale buildings in Britain, but very little survives above ground besides fortifications. These include sections of Hadrian's Wall, Chester city walls and coastal forts such as those at Portchester, Pevensey and Burgh Castle, which have survived through incorporation into later castles. Other structures still standing include a lighthouse at Dover Castle, now part of a church. In most cases, only foundations, floors and the bases of walls attest to the structure of former buildings. Some of these were on a grand scale, such as the palace at Fishbourne and the thermae at Bath. The more substantial buildings of the Roman period adhered closely to the style of Roman structures elsewhere, although traditional Iron Age building methods remained in general use for humbler dwellings, especially in rural areas. Medieval architecture =Anglo-Saxon architecture= All Saints' Church, Earls Barton Architecture of the Anglo-Saxon period exists only in the form of churches, the only structures commonly built in stone apart from fortifications. The earliest examples date from the 7th century, notably at Bradwell-on-Sea and Escomb, but the majority from the 10th and 11th centuries. Due to the systematic destruction and replacement of English cathedrals and monasteries by the Normans, no major Anglo-Saxon churches survive; the largest extant example is at Brixworth. The main material is ashlar masonry, sometimes accompanied by details in reused Roman brick. Anglo-Saxon churches are typically high and narrow and consist of a nave and a narrower chancel; these are often accompanied by a west tower. Some feature porticus (projecting chambers) to the west or to the north and south, creating a cruciform plan. Characteristic features include quoins in 'long-and-short work' (alternating vertical and horizontal blocks) and small windows with rounded or triangular tops, deeply splayed or in groups of two or three divided by squat columns. The most common form of external decoration is lesene strips (thin vertical or horizontal strips of projecting stone), typically combined with blind arcading. Notable examples of this exist at Earls Barton, Bradford-on-Avon and Barton-upon- Humber. =Norman architecture= Norwich Castle: round arches are characteristic of the Romanesque style In the 11th century the Normans were among Europe's leading exponents of Romanesque architecture, a style which had begun to influence English church building before 1066, but became the predominant mode in England with the huge wave of construction that followed the Norman Conquest. The Normans destroyed a large proportion of England's churches and built Romanesque replacements, a process which encompassed all of England's cathedrals. Most of the latter were later partially or wholly rebuilt in Gothic style, and although many still preserve substantial Romanesque portions, only Durham Cathedral remains a predominantly Romanesque structure (along with St Alban's and Southwell, abbey churches in the medieval period). Even Durham displays significant transitional features leading towards the emergence of Gothic. Romanesque churches are characterised by rounded arches, arcades supported by massive cylindrical piers, groin vaults and low-relief sculptural decoration. Distinctively Norman features include decorative chevron patterns. In the wake of the invasion William I and his lords built numerous wooden motte-and-bailey castles to impose their control on the native population. Many were subsequently rebuilt in stone, beginning with the Tower of London. There are also a very small number of domestic Norman buildings still standing, for example Jew's House, Lincoln; manor houses at Saltford and Boothby Pagnall; and fortified manor houses such as Oakham Castle. Perpendicular Gothic lady chapel of Gloucester Cathedral = Gothic architecture = The major buildings of the Late Middle Ages and the first centuries of the Early Modern Period were constructed in the predominant late medieval European style of Gothic architecture. Art-historical periodisations are Early English or First Pointed (late 12th–late 13th centuries), Decorated Gothic or Second Pointed (late 13th–late 14th centuries), and Perpendicular Gothic or Third Pointed (14th–17th centuries). The architect and art historian Thomas Rickman's Attempt to Discriminate the Style of Architecture in England, first published in 1812, divided Gothic architecture in the British Isles into three stylistic periods. Rickman identified the period of architecture from William the Conqueror () to Henry II () as Norman; from Richard the Lionheart () to Edward I () as Early English; the reigns of Edward II () and Edward III () as Decorated, and from Richard II () to Henry VIII () as Perpendicular. From the 15th century, under the House of Tudor, the prevailing Gothic style is commonly known as Tudor architecture, being ultimately succeeded by Elizabethan architecture and Renaissance architecture under Elizabeth I (). Rickman excluded from his scheme most new buildings after Henry VIII's reign, calling the style of \\"additions and rebuilding\\" in the later 16th and earlier 17th centuries \\"often much debased\\". Architect and art historian Edmund Sharpe published in 1851 The Seven Periods of English Architecture, in which he identified a pre-Gothic Transitional Period (1145–90) after the Norman period, in which pointed arches and round arches were employed together. Focusing on the windows, Sharpe dubbed Rickman's first Gothic style the Lancet Period (1190–1245); divided the second into first the Geometrical (1245–1315) and then the Curvilinear (1315–1360); and named the third style Rectilinear (1360–1550). This last Gothic style was typified by large windows, four-centred arches, straight vertical and horizontal lines in the tracery, and regular arch-topped rectangular panelling. Perpendicular was the prevailing style of Late Gothic architecture in England from the 14th century to the 17th century. Perpendicular was unique to the country: no equivalent arose in Continental Europe or elsewhere in the British Isles. Of all the Gothic architectural styles, Perpendicular was the first to experience a second wave of popularity from the 18th century on in Gothic Revival architecture. = Vernacular architecture = Hall in Alfriston Clergy House, 14th-century Little survives of the vernacular architecture of the medieval period due to the use of perishable materials for the great majority of buildings. Most domestic buildings were built on timber frames, usually with wattle and daub infill. Roofs were typically covered with thatch; wooden shingles were also employed, and from the 12th century tile and slate came into use in some areas. Also around the 12th century, the cruck frame was introduced, increasing the size of timber framed vernacular buildings. Typically, larger houses of this period were based around a great hall open from floor to roof. One bay at each end was split into two storeys and used for service rooms and private rooms for the owner. Even quite high up the social scale houses were small by modern standards, except for the very wealthy.Aslet and Powers, 15 Buildings surviving from this period included moated manor houses of which Ightham Mote is a notable late medieval example, and Wealden hall houses such as Alfriston Clergy House. Tintagel Old Post Office is a 14th-century manor house in a part of the country where stone was the typical building material for better houses. Little Moreton Hall, a large manor house begun in 1504-08 and later extended, is a famous showpiece of decorative half-timbering.Aslet and Powers, 13-15, 40 Near the dangerous Scottish border, the peel tower was a type of tower house or small castle; in Scotland they were even more common. The bastle house was a two-storey version, continuing what had been a common form of house for the better-off across the country in the late Anglo-Saxon and Norman periods.Aslet and Powers, 20-24 Tudor transition Montacute House, near Yeovil, Somerset. Built 1598 The Tudor period constitutes a transitional phase, in which the organic continuity and technical innovation of the medieval era gave way to centuries in which architecture was dominated by a succession of attempts to revive earlier styles. The Perpendicular Gothic style reached its culmination in the reign of Henry VII and the early years of Henry VIII, with the construction of King's College Chapel, Cambridge and Henry VII's Chapel at Westminster Abbey. However, the Reformation brought an effective halt to church-building in England which continued in most parts of the country until the 19th century. By the time of Henry VII's accession castle-building in England had come to an end and under the Tudors ostentatious unfortified country houses and palaces became widespread, built either in stone or in brick, which first became a common building material in England in this period. Characteristic features of the early Tudor style included imposing gatehouses (a vestige of the castle), flattened pointed arches in the Perpendicular Gothic manner, square-headed windows, decoratively shaped gables and large ornate chimneys. Outstanding surviving examples of early Tudor palatial architecture include Hampton Court Palace and Layer Marney Tower. Over the course of the 16th century Classical features derived from the Renaissance architecture of Italy exerted an increasing influence, initially on surface decoration but in time shaping the entire design of buildings, while the use of medieval features declined. This development gave rise to palatial stone dwellings or prodigy houses such as Hardwick Hall and Montacute House. Style revivals =Stuart architecture= The Queen's House, Greenwich During the 17th century the continuing advance of Classical forms overrode the eclecticism of English Renaissance architecture, which gave way to a more uniform style derived from continental models, chiefly from Italy. This entailed a retreat from the structural sophistication of Gothic architecture to forms derived from the more primitive construction methods of Classical antiquity. The style was typified by square or round-headed windows and doors, flat ceilings, colonnades, pilasters, pediments and domes. Classical architecture in England tended to be relatively plain and simple in comparison with the contemporaneous Baroque architecture of the continent, being influenced above all by the Palladian style of Italy. This was first introduced to England by Inigo Jones and typified by his Queen's House at Greenwich. The dome of St. Paul's cathedral designed by Sir Christopher WrenThe Great Fire of London in 1666 forced the reconstruction of much of the city, which was the only part of the country to see a significant amount of church-building between the Reformation and the 19th century. Sir Christopher Wren was employed to replace many of the destroyed churches, but his master plan for rebuilding London as a whole was rejected. Wren's churches exemplify the distinctive English approach to church-building in the Classical manner, which largely rejected the domes that typified the continental Baroque and employed a wide range of different forms of steeple, experimental efforts to find a substitute for the Gothic spire within a Classical mode. However, a dome featured very prominently in Wren's grandest construction, St Paul's Cathedral, the only English cathedral in any permutation of the Classical tradition. The later 17th century saw Baroque architecture, a version of Classicism characterised by heavy massing and ostentatiously elaborate decoration, become widespread in England. Grand Baroque country houses began to appear in England in the 1690s, exemplified by Chatsworth House and Castle Howard. The most significant English Baroque architects after Wren were Sir John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor, who adapted the Baroque style to fit English tastes in houses such as Blenheim Palace, Seaton Delaval Hall and Easton Neston. =Georgian architecture= The Circus (Bath) The 18th century saw a turn away from Baroque elaboration and a reversion to a more austere approach to Classicism. This shift initially brought a return to the Italian Palladianism that had characterised the earliest manifestations of Classical architecture in England. Later Neoclassical architecture increasingly idealised ancient Greek forms, which were viewed as representing Classicism in its original 'purity', as against Roman forms, now regarded as degenerate. Country houses representing this style include Woburn Abbey and Kedleston Hall. This period also saw the emergence of an increasingly planned approach to urban expansion, and the systematic, simultaneous construction of whole streets or squares, or even of entire districts, gave rise to new forms of domestic construction, the terrace and the crescent, as exemplified in Bath and in Bloomsbury and Mayfair in London. Among the notable architects practising in this era were Robert Adam, Sir William Chambers, John Wood and James Wyatt. =Victorian architecture= The Palace of Westminster, completed in 1870. Designed by Sir Charles Barry and A. W. N. Pugin The 19th century saw a fragmentation of English architecture, as Classical forms continued in widespread use but were challenged by a series of distinctively English revivals of other styles, drawing chiefly on Gothic, Renaissance and vernacular traditions but incorporating other elements as well. This ongoing historicism was counterposed by a resumption of technical innovation, which had been largely in abeyance since the Renaissance but was now fuelled by new materials and techniques derived from the Industrial Revolution, particularly the use of iron and steel frames, and by the demand for new types of building. The rapid growth and urbanisation of the population entailed an immense amount of new domestic and commercial construction, while the same processes combined with a religious revival to bring about a resumption of widespread church building. Mechanised manufacturing, railways and public utilities required new forms of building, while the new industrial cities invested heavily in grand civic buildings and the huge expansion and diversification of educational, cultural and leisure activities likewise created new demands on architecture. The Gothic revival was a development which emerged in England and whose influence, except in church building, was largely restricted to the English- speaking world. It had begun on a small scale in the 18th century under the stimulus of Romanticism, a trend initiated by Horace Walpole's house Strawberry Hill. However, widespread Gothic construction began only in the 19th century, led by the renewal of church building but spreading to secular construction. Early Gothic revival architecture was whimsical and unsystematic, but in the Victorian era the revival developed an abstract rigour and became a movement driven by cultural, religious and social concerns which extended far beyond architecture, seeing the Gothic style and the medieval way of life as a route to the spiritual regeneration of society. The first great ideologue of this movement was Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin, who together with Charles Barry designed the new Houses of Parliament, the grandest work of Victorian Gothic architecture. St Pancras Station, designed by George Gilbert Scott The Parliament building's Perpendicular style reflects the predominance of the later forms of English Gothic in the early Victorian period, but this later gave way to a preference for plain Early English or French Gothic, and above all to a style derived from the architecture of medieval Italy and the Low Countries. This High Victorian Gothic was driven chiefly by the writings of John Ruskin, based on his observations of the buildings of Venice, while its archetypal practitioner was the church architect William Butterfield. It was characterised by heavy massing, sparse use of tracery or sculptural decoration and an emphasis on polychrome patterning created through the use of different colours of brick and stone. The Gothic revival also drove a widespread effort to restore deteriorating medieval churches, a practice which often went beyond restoration to involve extensive reconstruction. The most active exponent of this activity was also the most prolific designer of new Gothic buildings, George Gilbert Scott, whose work is exemplified by St Pancras Station. Other leading Victorian Gothic architects included G. E. Street, J. F. Pearson and G. F. Bodley. The Victorian period also saw a revival of interest in English vernacular building traditions, focusing chiefly on domestic architecture and employing features such as half-timbering and tile-hanging, whose leading practitioner was Richard Norman Shaw. This development too was shaped by much wider ideological considerations, strongly influenced by William Morris and the Arts and Crafts Movement. While its ethos shared much with the Gothic revival, its preoccupations were less religious and were connected with romantic socialism and a distaste for industrialisation and urban life. In the later 19th century vernacular elements mingled with forms drawn from the Renaissance architecture of England and the Low Countries to produce a synthesis dubbed the Queen Anne Style, which in fact bore very little resemblance to the architecture of that reign. While some architects of the period were ideologically committed to a particular manner, a tendency personified by Pugin, others were happy to move between styles. An exemplar of this approach was Alfred Waterhouse, whose works included buildings in Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance styles and eclectic fusions between them. The Palm House at Kew Gardens, a key example of Victorian glasshouse construction The new technology of iron and steel frame construction exerted an influence over many forms of building, although its use was often masked by traditional forms. It was highly prominent in two of the new forms of building that characterised Victorian architecture, railway station train sheds and glasshouses. The greatest exponent of the latter was Joseph Paxton, architect of the Crystal Palace. In the 18th century a few English architects had emigrated to the colonies, but as the British Empire became firmly established in the 19th century many architects at the start of their careers made the decision to emigrate, several chose the United States but most went to Canada, Australia or New Zealand, as opportunities arose to meet the growing demand for buildings in these countries. Normally they adopted the style of architecture fashionable when they left England, though by the latter half of the century, improving transport and communications meant that even quite remote parts of the Empire had access to many publications, such as The Builder magazine. This enabled colonial architects to stay abreast of current fashion. Thus the influence of English architecture spread across the world. Several prominent 19th century architects produced designs that were executed by architects in the various colonies. For example, Sir George Gilbert Scott designed Bombay University & William Butterfield designed St Peter's Cathedral, Adelaide. =Historical styles in the 20th century= The last great exponent of late Victorian free Renaissance eclecticism was Edwin Lutyens, and his shift into the Classical mode after 1900 symbolised a wider retreat from the stylistic ferment of the 19th century to a plain and homogenous Classicism based on Georgian exemplars, an approach followed by many architects of the early 20th century, notably Herbert Baker and Reginald Blomfield. This Neo-Georgian manner, while not greatly favoured in later decades by the architectural profession or architecture critics, has remained popular with clients and conservative commentators, notably Charles, Prince of Wales. Domestic architecture throughout the 20th century and beyond has continued to be strongly influenced by a homogenised version of Victorian vernacular revival styles. Some architects responded to modernism, and economic circumstances, by producing stripped down versions of traditional styles; the work of Giles Gilbert Scott illustrates this well. Modern architecture =International Style= The International Style (also known as Modernism) emerged as a reaction against the world before the First World War, including historical architectural styles. Stylistically it was functional, drawing upon objects that were designed for a specific purpose such as Oceanliners. It emerged as an idea from continental Europe, but was of interest to some English architects. However it the arrival of emigre architects such as Mendelsohn and Lubetkin that galvanised the position of modern architecture within England. The bombing of English cities created a housing shortage, in the post war years. To meet this many thousands (perhaps hundreds of thousands) of council houses in mock-vernacular style were built, giving working class people their first experience of private gardens and indoor sanitation. The demand was partly sated through the pre-fabrication of buildings within factories, giving rise to the \\"Pre-fab\\" . =Brutalist architecture= The reconstruction that followed the Second World War had a major impact upon English architecture. The austerity that followed the WWII meant that cost dictated many design decisions, however significant architectural movements emerged. One such movement was the native development of Brutalism. Its look was created though the desire to express how buildings were constructed, for example through the use of exposed concrete. Significant \\"New Brutalist\\" buildings were the Economist Building, the Hayward Gallery, the Barbican Arts Centre and the Royal National Theatre. Lloyd's Building, City of London. Designed by Richard Rogers. Late 20th century =High-tech architecture= High-tech architecture emerged as an attempt to revitalise the language of Modernism, it drew inspiration from technology to create new architectural expression . The theorical work of Archigram provided significant inspiration of the High-tec movement. High-tech architecture is mostly associated with non-domestic buildings, perhaps due to the technological imagery. The two most prominent proponents were Richard Rogers and Norman Foster. Rogers' most iconic English building is the Lloyd's building, situated nearby is Foster's most famous 30 St Mary Axe building (nicknamed The Gherkin). Their respective influence continues into the current century. =Postmodern architecture= Postmodern architecture also emerged as an attempt to enrich Modern architecture. It was especially fashionable in the 1980s, when Modernism had fallen from favour, being associated with the welfare state. Many shopping malls and office complexes for example Broadgate used this style. Notable practitioners were James Stirling and Terry Farrell, although Farrell returned to modernism in the 1990s. A significant example of postmodernism is Robert Venturi's Sainsbury Wing of the National Gallery. =Contemporary architecture= Significant recent buildings, in a variety of styles, include: Will Alsop: Peckham Library, North Greenwich tube station; David Chipperfield: River and Rowing Museum, Hepworth Wakefield; Future Systems: Lord's Media Centre, Selfridges Building, Birmingham; Zaha Hadid, London Aquatics Centre; Ian Simpson: Beetham Tower, Manchester, Beetham Tower, Birmingham.

He is also known as Tudor din Vladimiri (Tudor of Vladimiri) or, occasionally, as Domnul Tudor (Voivode Tudor). Background Tudor was born in Vladimiri, Gorj County (in the region of Oltenia) in a family of landed peasants (mazili); his birth year is usually given as 1780, but this is still debated. At the age of 12, he was sent to Craiova, in service to boyar Ioan Glogoveanu, where he would later learn rhetoric, grammar and the Greek language. He became administrator of the boyar's estate and, in 1806, was named vătaf (leader of the local militias) at Cloșani. Tudor's experience as a servant made him familiar with customs, habits and objectives of landowners; this insight helped him walk the fine line between conflicting interests of boyars and peasants in the first months of the uprising against the Phanariotes. While leader of a mainly peasant movement, Tudor did his best not to antagonize the elite, punishing any destruction of property.Nicolae Iorga, Izvoarele contemporane asupra mișcării lui Tudor Vladimirescu, Lib. \\"Cartea Românească\\" şi Pavel Suru, 1921 Tudor enrolled in the Russian army and took part in the Russo-Turkish War, 1806-1812. Consequently, he was awarded the Order of St. Vladimir 3rd degree and given Russian protection and immunity from prosecution under both Wallachian and Ottoman legislation (see Sudiți). This contributed to Tudor's decisions throughout the uprising, alongside his belief that Russia was backing his actions. After the war, Tudor returned to Oltenia. He traveled briefly to Vienna, in 1814, in order to attend a lawsuit involving Glogoveanu's wife's patrimony. The trip coincided with the Peace Congress, and it is believed that Vladimirescu followed the treaties' outcome. Back in the country in 1815, Tudor learned that Ada Kaleh Ottoman garrison, who roamed Mehedinți and Gorj, had also destroyed his household from Cerneți. From 1812 to 1821, Vladimirescu slowly built a follower base. The Pandurs respected his military skills, and many sources point out his charisma and outstanding negotiating abilities. He would also have been familiarised with the outcomes of the First and Second Serbian Uprising. Uprising Prince Alexandros Soutzos' death in January 1821 led to the forming of a temporary Comitet de Ocârmuire (\\"Governing Committee\\"), three regents - all of them members of the most representative indigenous boyar families, of which the most prominent was Caimacam Grigore Brâncoveanu. The Comitet, motivated against competition and denied Phanariote rulers' favours, decided to quickly manoeuver anti-boyar and anti-Phanariote sentiment in Wallachia (and especially in Oltenia), acting before the newly appointed Scarlat Callimachi could claim his throne. Therefore, an agreement between it and the Pandurs was reached on the 15th: Dimitrie Macedonski was awarded the post of lieutenant to Tudor. The very same day, Vladimirescu sent a letter to the Ottoman Court of Mahmud II, stating that his objective was not the rejection of Ottoman rule, but that of the Phanariote regime, and showing his willingness for preservation of the traditional institutions. The statements were meant to buy Tudor time against Ottoman response, as he was already in negotiations with the Greek Anti- Ottoman revolutionary society Philikí Etaireía (having probably been in contact with it from around 1819). Together, they produced a plan for insurrection, with the two Etairist representatives (Giorgakis Olympios and Iannis Pharmakis) assuring the Wallachians of Russian support for the common cause. It is apparent that Tudor was not himself a member of the Etaireía: the rigid command structure of the Brotherhood would have excluded the need for any negotiations. After fortifying monasteries in Oltenia (Tismana, Strehaia) that were to serve him in the event of Ottoman intervention, Tudor travelled to Padeș where he issued his first proclamation (23 January). It included references to Enlightenment principles (notably, the right to resist oppression), but was also an almost millenarianist appeal to peasants, promising a \\"spring\\" to follow \\"winter\\". In February the demands were detailed by more documents. They included: the elimination of purchased offices in the administration, with the introduction of meritocratic promotion, the suppression of certain taxes and taxing criteria, the reduction of the main tax, the founding of a Wallachian Army, and an end to internal custom duties. In line with these, Tudor asked for the banishment of some Phanariote families and forbidding future Princes to hold a retinue that would compete with local boyars for offices. Calls by boyars in the Divan for Tudor to cease such activities (expressed by envoy Nicolae Văcărescu) were met with a virulent refusal. The Etaireía and Ottomans fighting in Bucharest (August 1821). The army, swelled up in numbers as it advanced, occupied Bucharest on 21 March - here, Tudor issued another important proclamation, one that expressed yet again his commitment to peace with the Ottomans. Previously, the Philikí Etaireía under Alexander Ypsilanti had emerged in Moldavia, proclaiming a liberation from Ottoman rule that was backed by the then Moldavian Prince Michael Soutzos (see Greek War of Independence). However, this coincided with Russian reaction against Greek rebellion, with the Russian army entering Moldavia and enforcing Holy Alliance policies. Ypsilanti's army headed south, reaching Pandur-occupied Bucharest. Tudor's actions in the meanwhile had destroyed his alliance to local boyars. He had started wearing the kalpak (a tall, cylindrical, black leather hat; see Ottoman Clothing) reserved for the Prince, and demanded to be addressed as Domn (\\"Master\\", \\"Prince\\"; cf. Domnitor) - moving away from subordination to the landowners' cause. The meeting between Ypsilanti and Tudor brought a new compromise. Tudor considered himself liberated from the provisions of the January agreement, as Russia was now an enemy of the Etaireía; Ypsilanti tried to persuade him that Russian support was still possible. The country was divided into a Greek administration and a Wallachian one, with Tudor's declaring itself neutral in the face of large Ottoman armies preparing to cross the north of the Danube. Ottoman actions had been prompted by Russian threat of intervention in Wallachia. Tudor's army retreated towards in Oltenia in May, as the Ottomans occupied Bucharest without meeting resistance. Tudor was no longer capable of maintaining the discipline and cohesion of his own troops, some of whom had resorted to robbery. In an attempt to ensure discipline, he imposed hangings of those found guilty. In the meantime, Etaireía members, led by Alexander Ypsilantis developed a plot to remove Tudor. Following treason, Tudor was arrested in on 21 May. On the night of 27 to 28 May, following accusations of collaboration with the Ottomans against Etaireía, he was tortured and killed by Etaireía in Targoviste, his mutilated body being thrown into a cesspit. Tudor's collaboration with the Ottomans was never confirmed.Vasilie Urechiă, \\"Istoria Romanilor: Revolutiunea lui Tudor Vladimirescu\\", Bucuresci, 1901 The Etaireía did not succeed in its goal to assume command of Vladimirescu's army: most of it disbanded on the spot. Legacy Tudor's rebellion ensured that Wallachia would stay under military occupation. Although the situation was stabilized by August, Ottoman troops remained present until 1826. However, as they could no longer trust Phanariote rule in the face of its infiltration by Greek nationalism (Ypsilanti himself came from a Phanariote family - see Alexander Ypsilanti, his grandfather, and Constantine Ypsilanti, his father), the Ottomans returned the two Principalities to rule by and through locals (in 1822): Grigore IV Ghica in Wallachia, Ioan Sturdza (Ioniţă Sandu Sturdza) in Moldavia. The changes in the situation were to be confirmed by the Treaty of Adrianople and Russian occupation (at the end of the Russo-Turkish War). Although the scope of his movement appealed to generations of Romanian nationalists, Tudor Vladimirescu's most favorable treatment came with the official ideology of the Romanian People's Republic (the first period of Communist Romania, lasting from 1948 to 1965). He was considered progressive, and it also contributed that he viewed himself as an ally to the Russian cause—almost as a precursor of the Soviet alliance. The Romanian film TudorTudor (1962) at the Internet Movie Database (1962) narrated his life from the return home in 1812 to his death. Tudor, portrayed by Emanoil Petruţ, falls from his horse after being shot in the back, claiming to return \\"as the grass of spring\\" - a far easier death than what Vladimirescu had endured in reality. A division bearing his name (Divizia Tudor Vladimirescu) was formed by the Red Army with Romanian prisoners of war who had fought on the Eastern Front. They were called on to fight the Ion Antonescu pro-Nazi Germany regime, and were absorbed into the Romanian Army after 1944. The division had its precedent in an artillery battery of the same name, grouping Romanian volunteers in the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War.It was customary for units of the International Brigades to be named for a notable past leader of their country, considered a Progressive but not a Communist - e.g. the American Abraham Lincoln Brigade. An Order of Tudor Vladmirescu was also created. There are multiple streets and structures in Romania bearing his name, including a metro station in Bucharest.

The hotel currently has 133 guest rooms, Caroline's restaurant, the Riverboat Lounge, the Potosa Spa, a pool and fitness center, and large banquet facilities. The interior redesign converted the existing 168 guest rooms into 133 luxury rooms and suites and restored the historic lobby and grand ballroom, while at the same time adding modern systems and amenities like a geothermal heating and cooling system, a reflective roof, a swimming pool and fitness facility. It was included as a contributing property in the Old Main Street Historic District in 1983 as the Julien Motor Inn. with History The history of the Hotel Julien Dubuque can be traced back to 1839, when the first lodging establishment was built at Second and Main streets. At first, the hotel was called the Waples House. The Waples House was known for fine dining and extravagant furnishings. In 1854 the hotel was renamed the Julien House. The hotel was enlarged and refurbished. It's believed that Abraham Lincoln stayed at the Julien House when he traveled to Galena, Illinois to attend to legal matters there. During the late 1800s, the hotel became a focal point of downtown Dubuque. In 1913, the Julien House was destroyed by a fire - very little was left standing by the time the fire was over. Construction on the present building began soon after, and was completed in 1915. During the time that Al Capone was the leader of the mob in Chicago, he reportedly owned the Julien. Capone supposedly had a fondness for Dubuque, and when he had trouble in Chicago Capone would come to Dubuque and use the Julien Inn as a retreat and hideout. Local lore says that he had an underground garage in the area in order to hide his personal cars so that he could better disguise his presence in the city. Another famous guest of the Julien was Sylvester Stallone. Stallone stayed at the Julien Inn during the filming of the movie F.I.S.T. Louis Pfohl eventually purchased the hotel, and remodeled the building. He was responsible for many of the features found in the hotel, such as the mirrored staircase leading from the lobby to the second floor. The Julien Inn is currently owned by the Fischer Companies - a company that owns a number of buildings in Dubuque. In 2007, the Fischer Companies began further renovation, intending to restore the building's exterior to its original appearance, plus renovating the interior of the hotel. As part of the renovation, the hotel also received a new name: Hotel Julien Dubuque. The renovation is now complete and the hotel reopened in Summer 2009.

The Macedonian army was unable to capture the city, which was a strategic coastal base on the Mediterranean Sea, through conventional means because it was on an island and had walls right up to the sea. Alexander responded to this problem by first blockading and besieging Tyre for seven months, and then by building a causeway that allowed him to breach the fortifications. It is said that Alexander was so enraged at the Tyrians' defence of their city and the loss of his men that he destroyed half the city. According to Arrian, 8,000 Tyrian civilians were massacred after the city fell. Alexander granted pardon to all who had sought sanctuary in the temple, including Azemilcus and his family, as well as many nobles. 30,000 residents and foreigners, mainly women and children, were sold into slavery. Location Tyre, the largest and most important city-state of Phoenicia, was located both on the Mediterranean coast as well as a nearby island with two natural harbours on the landward side. The island lay about a kilometre from the coast in Alexander’s days, its high walls reaching above the sea on the eastern, landward facing, side of the island. Background thumb250px Tyre view from an airplane, 1934 At the time of the siege, the city held approximately 40,000 people, though the women and children had been evacuated to Carthage, the former Phoenician colony and then Mediterranean power. The Carthaginians also promised to send a fleet to their mother city’s aid. As Alexander did not have access to his own navy, he resolved to take the city and thus deny the Persians their last harbour in the region. Alexander knew of a temple to Melqart, whom he identified with Heracles, within the new city walls and informed the inhabitants that they would be spared if he were allowed to make a sacrifice in the templeArrian: The Campaigns of Alexander translator Aubrey de Sélincourt (New York: Penguin Books, 1971), pp. 129-131. (the old port had been abandoned and the Tyrians were now living on an offshore island a kilometre from the mainland). The defenders refused to allow this and suggested he use the temple on the mainland, saying that they would not let Persians or Macedonians within their new city. A second attempt at negotiation resulted in Alexander's representatives being killed and then thrown from the walls into the sea. Alexander was enraged at the Tyrian defiance and ordered the siege to commence.O'Brien, John Maxwell Alexander the Great: the invisible enemy : a biography Routledge; 1 edition (15 September 1994) p.82 The siege As Alexander could not attack the city from the sea, he built a kilometre-long causeway stretching out to the island on a natural land bridge no more than two meters deep. This causeway allowed his artillery to get in range of the walls, and is still there to this day, as it was made of stone. As the work came near the city walls, however, the water became much deeper, and the combined attacks from the walls and Tyrian navy made construction nearly impossible. Therefore, Alexander constructed two towers high and moved them to the end of the causeway. Like most of Alexander’s siege towers, these were moving artillery platforms, with catapults on the top to clear defenders off the walls, and ballista below to hurl rocks at the wall and attacking ships. The towers were made of wood, but were covered in rawhide to protect them from fire arrows. Although these towers were possibly the largest of their kind ever made, the Tyrians quickly devised a counter-attack. They used an old horse transport ship, filling it with dried branches, pitch, sulphur, and various other combustibles. They then hung cauldrons of oil from the masts, so that they would fall onto the deck once the masts burned through. They also weighed down the back of the ship so that the front rose above the water. They then set the ship on fire and ran it up onto the causeway. The fire spread quickly, engulfing both towers and other siege equipment that had been brought up. The Tyrian ships swarmed the pier, destroying any siege equipment that hadn’t caught fire, and driving off Macedonian crews who were trying to put out the fires. Alexander the Great at the Siege of Tyre A naval action during the siege. Drawing by André Castaigne, 1888-1889. After this set back, Alexander was convinced that he would not be able to take Tyre without a navy. However, his previous victory at Issus and subsequent conquests of the Phoenician city states of Byblos, Arwad and Sidon had meant that the fleets of these cities, which had composed most of the Persian navy, came under his banner. This immediately gave him command of a fleet of 80 ships. This development coincided also with the arrival of 120 war galleys sent by the king of Cyprus, who had heard of his victories and wished to join him. With the arrival of another 23 ships from the Greek city states of Ionia, Alexander had 223 galleys under his command, giving him command of the sea. With his new fleet, Alexander's forces sailed on Tyre and quickly blockaded both ports with its superior numbers. Alexander had several of the slower galleys and a few barges refitted with battering rams. Finding that large underwater blocks of stone kept the rams from reaching the walls, Alexander had them removed by crane ships. The rams were then anchored near the walls, but the Tyrians sent out ships and divers to cut the anchor cables. Alexander responded by replacing the cables with chains. The Tyrians launched another counter-attack, but according to Arrian, were not so fortunate this time. They noticed that Alexander returned to the mainland at the same time every afternoon for a meal and a rest along with much of his navy. They therefore attacked at this time, but found Alexander had skipped his afternoon nap, and was able to quickly counter the sortie. Conclusion of the siege Alexander started testing the wall at various points with his rams, until the rams made a small breach in the south end of the island. He then coordinated an attack across the breach with a bombardment from all sides by his navy. Alexander is said to have personally taken part in the attack on the city, fighting from the top of a siege tower.History of Alexander the Great of Macedonia, section 4.4.10-21 Once his troops forced their way into the city, they easily overtook the garrison, and quickly captured the city. Those citizens who took shelter in the temple of Melqart were pardoned by Alexander, including the king of Tyre. According to Quintus Curtius Rufus 6,000 fighting men were killed within the city and 2,000 Tyrians were crucified on the beach. The others, some 30,000 people, were sold into slavery. The severity of reprisals reflected the length of the siege and Alexander's response to the Tyrians having executed some of his soldiers on the walls, in sight of the attackers. Following the capture of Tyre, Alexander moved south to attack Gaza. Alternative conclusion Polyaenus the Macedonian, in one of the two stratagems he gives about Alexander's siege of Tyre, provides a different account of Alexander’s conquest of the city. According to him, Alexander had marched into Arabia having left Parmenion in charge of the besieging force. The Tyrians found the courage to exit their walls and engage the Greeks, often beating them in various skirmishes. Alexander was informed and hurried back, reaching the city exactly when the Tyrians were fighting against a retreating Parmenion. Instead of attacking the Tyrians, he chose to march directly to the city, which he immediately took by force surprising its remaining garrison. Another view is that Alexander was so incensed at having to build a bridge to take the city of Tyre that he decided to kill or enslave most of Tyre's population.Polyaenus, 4.3 Alexander, 4 See also *Admetus of Macedon *List of Sieges of Tyre *Diades of Pella *Macedon References Sources *Jongeling, Hans, The Siege of Tyre by Alexander the Great in 332 B.C.

Aircraft  The aircraft was a 747, registration B-198, that had been in service for 11 years, 3 months. The aircraft had clocked a total of 45,868 hours of flight time during its time in service. The last A-check maintenance had occurred on December 21, 1991, and the aircraft had accumulated 74 hours of flight time since that point.  Accident  Several minutes after takeoff, the crew reported problems with the #2 engine, prompting Taipei air traffic control (ATC) to vector the flight into a left turn to return to the airport. Approximately two minutes later, the crew reported that they were unable to turn left, and ATC approved a right-hand turn instead. This was the last radio contact made by the crew. The crew lost control of the aircraft and it struck a hill, right wing first, near Wanli, Taipei. The crash occurred at approximately 3:05 PM, at an altitude of 700 feet. All five crew members died in the crash, and there were no injuries on the ground.  Investigation  The subsequent investigation revealed that the number 3 engine and its pylon had separated from the aircraft and struck the number 4 engine, breaking it off the wing as well. A more detailed investigation revealed that the pylon midspar fittings, which attach the pylon to the lower portion of the wing front spar, had failed. The search for the number 3 engine and its pylon, which landed in the sea, took several months. Information from the investigation of this crash and the nearly identical crash of El Al Flight 1862 10 months later resulted in Boeing ordering pylon modifications to every 747 in use.

It was written before Jane Eyre, but was rejected by many publishing houses. It was eventually published, posthumously, in 1857, with the approval of Charlotte Brontë's widower, Arthur Bell Nicholls, who took on the task of reviewing and editing the text. Plot introduction The novel is the story of a young man, William Crimsworth, and is a first-person narrative from his perspective. It describes his maturation, his career as a teacher in Brussels, and his personal relationships. The story starts with a letter William has sent to his friend Charles, detailing his rejection of his uncle's proposal that he become a clergyman, as well as his first meeting with his rich brother Edward. Seeking work as a tradesman, William is offered the position of a clerk by Edward. However, Edward is jealous of William's education and intelligence, and treats him terribly. Through the actions of the sympathetic Mr Hunsden, William is relieved of his post, but starts a new job at a boys' boarding school in Belgium. The school is run by the friendly Monsieur Pelet, who treats William kindly and politely. Soon William's merits as a \\"professor\\" reach the ears of the headmistress of the neighbouring girls' school. Mademoiselle Reuter offers him a position at her school, which he accepts. Initially captivated by her, William begins to entertain ideas of falling in love with her, but then he overhears her and Monsieur Pelet talking about their upcoming marriage and their deceitful treatment of him. William begins to treat Mademoiselle Reuter with cold civility as he sees her underlying nature. She, however, continues to try to draw him back in by pretending to be benevolent and concerned. She asks him to teach one of her young teachers, Frances, who hopes to improve her skill in languages. William sees promising intelligence in this pupil and slowly begins to fall in love with her. Jealous of the attention Frances is receiving from William, Mademoiselle Reuter takes it upon herself to dismiss Frances from her post and to hide her address from William. After a long search he re-encounters Frances in a graveyard and they renew their acquaintance. It is revealed that as she was trying to make herself amiable in William's eyes, Mademoiselle Reuter had accidentally fallen in love with him herself. Not wanting to cause a conflict with Monsieur Pelet, William leaves his establishment. William gets a new position as a \\"professor\\" at a college, allowing him and Frances to marry. The two eventually open a school together and have a child. After achieving financial security the family travels around England and then settles in the countryside, near to Mr Hunsden. Characters *William Crimsworth: The protagonist, an orphaned child who is educated at Eton College after being taken in by his uncles. Rejecting their offer of a post as a clergyman, as he does not believe himself good enough for the role, he severs ties with them in order to walk in his late father's shoes and become a tradesman. His time in Yorkshire as a clerk for his cruel elder brother is short and he departs for Belgium, where he becomes a \\"professor\\" and meets his wife to be, who is a pupil of his. He is educated, religious and healthy, though not handsome. *Lord Tynedale / Hon. John Seacombe / Mr Seacombe: William's maternal uncles who attempt to set William up as Rector of Seacombe-cum-Scaife and to marry him off to one of his own cousins, \\"all of whom [he] greatly dislike[s]\\". William severs all ties with these relatives and little is related of them in the rest of the book. *Charles: Seemingly William's only friend at Eton. William writes a letter to him detailing his activities since Eton and just after his first meeting with Edward at Crimsworth Hall. This letter serves as an introduction to the book. Charles does not reply to the letter, as he has already set off for one of the colonies. He is an unseen character. *Edward Crimsworth: William's tyrannical elder brother. He is an accomplished tradesman, owner of a Yorkshire mill, married and more handsome than his brother. Jealous of his sibling's education, he treats William cruelly. He later loses his wealth and wife, only to become rich again by the end of the book. *Hunsden Yorke Hunsden: The man who frees William from his brother's clutches. He sets him up with contacts in Brussels and the two become good friends. He is a unique but not unattractive man whose taste in women is similar to William's, though he remains a lifelong bachelor. *Monsieur Francois Pelet: The French headmaster of a boys' school in Belgium who employs William and becomes a good friend. He later betrays him to ensure the affection of Zoraïde Reuter, whom he later marries. *Mademoiselle Zoraïde Reuter: The Catholic headmistress of the school in Belgium. William is initially attracted to her, though she is destined to marry Monsieur Pelet. *Frances Evans Henri: A pupil-teacher at the school in Belgium where William Crimsworth finds himself. After the two fall in love they get married. They eventually move to England. She is a Swiss orphan of half -English extraction who was raised by her aunt. *Madame Reuter: Zoraïde's mother *Madame Pelet: Monsieur Pelet's mother *Eulalie, Hortense and Caroline: Three coquettish students at Mademoiselle Reuter's school *Sylvie: Another student *Jules Vanderkelkov: A student at Monsieur Pelet's school *Victor Crimsworth: Son of William and Frances Evans Henri. Themes =Religion= Throughout the novel William looks down on Catholics and \\"Romish wizardcraft\\". Charlotte Brontë pictures the two main Catholic characters as treacherous and untrustworthy. William believes that Catholic training has a negative influence on the young girls at his school. =Nationalism= The charming Hunsden has little patriotism, in contrast to Frances, who is proud both of her native Switzerland and of England, where her mother's family came from and which she longs to see. William has a certain snobbery against the Flemish and is disgusted by the way they butcher the English language as he attempts to teach them. Context The novel is based on Charlotte Brontë's experiences in Brussels, where she studied as a language student and was a teacher in 1842. Much of the subject matter of The Professor was later reworked, from the perspective of a female teacher, into Brontë's later novel Villette. Bibliography *Brontë, Charlotte The Professor.

He played regularly around the Southeastern US with The Hilltops, a band based in Oxford, Mississippi that included his twin sister Laurie Stirratt and her husband Cary Hudson. During this time he met and befriended the band Uncle Tupelo and supported them on tours of the East and Midwest. After the breakup of The Hilltops in 1990 Stirratt recorded a record under the name The Gimmecaps and briefly joined Lafayette, LA band The Bluerunners before joining Uncle Tupelo in 1992 as bassist/guitarist on their last album Anodyne.  Wilco and The Autumn Defense  After the breakup of Uncle Tupelo, Stirratt rejoined Jeff Tweedy, Ken Coomer and Max Johnston to found Wilco in 1994. Since the founding of Wilco, Stirratt and Tweedy are the only members to contribute to all Wilco releases. Stirratt also joined Wilco members Jay Bennett and Ken Coomer to form Courtesy Move, an early Wilco side project that recorded an album in late 1996 that was never released. Stirratt formed The Autumn Defense in 2000 with friend and fellow New Orleanian Pat Sansone. In 2001 they recorded their debut The Green Hour in New Orleans and Nashville with former Wilco members Bob Egan and Ken Coomer, releasing the album on Stirratt's own Broadmoor Records. The Autumn Defense released Circles in 2003 with Greg \\"G. Wiz\\" Wieczorek on drums and Nashville-based bassist Brad Jones. When Sansone joined Wilco in 2004, The Autumn Defense had more time to collaborate, resulting in their third, self- titled album (2006). The Autumn Defense focused on Sansone's orchestral production style. November 2010 brought the world the group's fourth album \\"Once Around\\".

It is based on the 3D optical data storage technology developed for the Fluorescent Multilayer Disc by the defunct company Constellation 3D. DMDs can store between 22 and 32 GB of binary information. It is based on red laser technology, so DM discs and players can be easily made in existing production facilities with little modifications. Discs are composed of multiple data layers joined by a fluorescent material. Unlike DVDs and CDs, DMD do not have metallic layers, so they are nearly transparent. DMDs are coated with proprietary chemical compositions, and those chemicals react when the red laser shines on a particular layer. The chemical reaction then generates a signal, which is then read by the disc reader. This allows for discs to potentially have up to 100 GB of storage space. Advantages * Because DMD only requires a stable, reliable red laser to read information from the disk, the manufacturing processes for both disks and drives is much simpler and much less expensive than other alternatives, like Blu-ray or HD DVD. * DMD is highly scalable meaning 20GB, 50GB, 100GB+ disks are possible with little additional research & development required.

The machine's rotors are labelled with Cyrillic, requiring 30 points on the rotors; this is in contrast to many comparable Western machines with 26-contact rotors, corresponding to the Latin alphabet.

The M-125-MN had a typewheel that could handle Latin and Cyrilic letters. The M-125-3MN had separate typewheels for Latin and Cyrilic. The M-125-3MN had three modes, single shift letters, double shift with letters and symbols, and digits only, for use with code books and to superencrypt numeric ciphers. Encryption mechanism Ten Fialka rotors fitted inside the machine. Rotor stack removed from the machine, showing the 30 contact pins. The Fialka rotor assembly has 10 rotors mounted on an axle and a 30 by 30 commutator (Kc 30x30). The commutator consists of two sets of 30 contact strips set at right angles to each other. A punched card is placed between the two sets of contacts via a door on the left hand side of the unit. Each punched card has 30 holes, with exactly one hole per row and column pair, and thereby specifies a permutation of the 30 rotor contact lines. This feature is comparable to the plug board on the Enigma machine. A triangular plate was used to enter the null permutation for testing purposes. There are two types of rotors: *disassemblable (zerlegbar) rotors, used with the M-125-3MN. The rotorset name is \\"PROTON.\\" The disassemblable rotors consist of an insert with electrical contacts and scramble wiring, and an outer ring with mechanical pins whose presence or absence control rotor stepping. As part of the key setup, the stepping control pins can be rotated relative to the outer ring. The inner, electrical ring can also be rotated relative to the outer ring and can be inserted in one of two ways, with side 1 or side 2 up. *unitary rotors, used with the M-125-MN. These have both electrical contacts and mechanical pins. The only key adjustment is the order of the rotors on the axle and the initial rotor settings. There is one combination for the disassemblable rotors that is compatible with the unitary rotor. One East German manual that has become public contains typed-in and hand written addenda that suggest the East Germans, at least, later stopped using the added features of the disassemblable rotors and only used them in unitary compatibility mode. Adjacent rotors step in opposite directions. A spare rotor assembly could be kept in the unit's top cover. Museum of Military History Vienna Keying material The keying material for the Fialka consists of a daily key book, a message key book and a message identifier book for broadcast traffic. The daily key book contains day keys for one month. A day key consists of a key table (in Cyrillic) and a punched card. For fixed rotor systems, the key table specifies the order of the rotors on the axle and the initial rotor settings to be used to decrypt the indicator of broadcast messages. As its name implies, the day key is valid (has a cryptoperiod in NSA parlance) for 24 hours and was changed at 00:01 hours. For the disassemblable rotors, the table also specifies the electrical insert for each outer rotor, which side was to be up, and the orientation of the insert relative to the outer rotor. Here is a sample M-125-3NM day key table for use on the 14th of the month: :ИДЖЗА ВКБГЕ 14 :OCAHE PTБВЕ :БДВИА ГЕЗКЖ :2II22 I22I2 :КУЛКЮ ЫХВУГ The message key table contained the initial rotor settings to be used with each message. A message key was never to be used more than once. The keying material was distributed in a foil-covered package, with the daily key tables and punched cards fan-folded in a pouch with perforations between each item. The other tables were in a side pouch. Comparison with other rotor machines The Fialka design seems to derive from the Swiss NEMA, but the NEMA only has 5 electrical rotors vs. the Fialka's 10 and NEMA lacks a punched card commutator or an equivalent, such as a plug board. Fialka seems most comparable to the U.S. KL-7 which has eight electrical rotors and also lacks a commutator, but its keyboard permutor switch eliminated the need for a reflector, which proved to be a weakness in the Enigma system.

He played as an all-rounder who bowled fast-medium pace and has been used as both an opening batsman and in the lower order. He was born in Johannesburg in South Africa in 1975 and educated at Hoërskool Alberton in Alberton, Gauteng. Prior to making it on the South African first-class cricket scene he played indoor cricket for South Africa. He broke through in 1995/96 and has played for Transvaal, Gauteng, and Easterns. Internationally, Hall was initially thought of solely as a limited overs cricket specialist and made his ODI debut against the West Indies at Durban in 1999. He was a regular in the ODI side until 2007, taking part in South Africa's 2003 Cricket World Cup squad and the 2007 Cricket World Cup. He appeared in the Test side sporadically and made his debut in 2002 against Australia at Cape Town. Batting at number 8, he scored 70 but did not pick up any wickets in the match. He retired from international cricket in September 2007 but continued to play domestic cricket in both South Africa and England until 2014. International career During the 2003 England tour he received a late call-up to the South African squad and impressed with 16 wickets in the Test series. He scored a match-winning 99 not out at Headingley and became the 5th batsman in Test cricket to have been stranded one short of a hundred.Hall makes his mark, BBC Sport, 2003-08-24. Retrieved 2017-10-22. In 2004, due to the absence of the recently retired Gary Kirsten and non-touring Herschelle Gibbs, he was promoted to open the batting in the Test series against India. He reacted to the added responsibility by scoring 163 at Kanpur - his maiden Test century. The century was made against the likes of Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, batting for almost ten hours. He holds the World Record 8th wicket stand in ODI cricket of 138 with Justin Kemp, made against India in November 2006. His contribution was an unbeaten 56 from 47 balls and he went on to take 3 wickets in the second innings. During the 2007 Cricket World Cup in the West Indies he took his maiden 5 wicket haul (5/18) against England on 17 April at the Kensington Oval, Bridgetown, Barbados. =International retirement= Hall retired from international cricket in September 2007. Whilst not giving a reason for his decision, Graham Ford - Hall's coach at Kent - speculated it was due to his omission from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship squad, saying: County career Hall played for Durham Cricket Board in the 1999 NatWest Trophy, his first experience in English County Cricket. He played one List A match for Suffolk in the 2002 Cheltenham & Gloucester Trophy whilst playing for Rawtenstall in the Lancashire League. This was Halls only appearance in any form of cricket for Suffolk. He then played his first senior English cricket for Worcestershire in the 2003 and 2004 English seasons. Hall moved to play for Kent from 2005 to 2007, playing parts of each season when not appearing for the South African side. He returned to England in 2008 when he signed for Northamptonshire as a Kolpak player. While playing for Northants he set a record for the side's best Twenty20 bowling figures, taking 6/21 against Worcestershire in 2008. He also achieved his best Twenty20 batting performance in the same game (66 not out). He became captain of the county in 2010 after fellow South African Nicky Boje resigned, remaining captain until after the 2012 season when he was replaced by Stephen Peters. During his tenure as captain he nearly led Northants to promotion in the County Championship. Hall continued to play for Northants until the end of the 2014 season when he was not offered a new contract. He announced his retirement from professional cricket shortly afterwards.

Born in Dunbarton, New Hampshire in 1815, Hoyt received his undergraduate education at Yale University, where he was a member of Skull and Bones. After Hoyt's graduation from Yale in 1840, he served as an instructor in mathematics and natural philosophy at Phillips Exeter Academy from 1840 to 1858, before taking up his post at Washington University. In 1862, Hoyt died in St. Louis, Missouri at the age of 47. Biography Joseph Gibson Hoyt, Washington University in St. Louis's first chancellor, was born in Dunbarton, New Hampshire, in 1815. Until he was 16, he was only able to attend school three months a year because he was needed on the family farm. Nevertheless, he entered Yale University in 1836. There, he took prizes in mathematics and classics, served as editor of Yale's famous literary magazine, and graduated sixth in a class of 100. After graduating in 1840, he took charge of an academy in Plymouth, New Hampshire, and a year later was appointed professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Phillips Exeter Academy in Exeter, New Hampshire, where he remained for 18 years and rose to national prominence as an educator. He was a skilled draftsman and architect, personally designing some of the buildings and furnishings in the town of Exeter. Hoyt helped revise the New Hampshire state constitution in 1851; and in 1858, narrowly missed a congressional nomination. But that same year he accepted the appointment as chancellor and professor of Greek language and literature at Washington University in St. Louis. He arrived in St. Louis in 1859, he wrote, with a \\"controlling purpose\\" to develop a college. \\"Of the constituent elements of a true University,\\" he said in his inaugural address, \\"the first and most important is the College, which should give students a solid foundation in the liberal arts.\\" He did just that, defining the requirements and curriculum for bachelor's degrees, which survived into the 1890s, and designating a full-time faculty for the College. His most noted hire was that of William Chauvenet, a Yale College classmate who came as the new chair of mathematics and astronomy and would later succeed him as chancellor. The University's Collegiate Department, the forerunner of Arts & Sciences, graduated its first class of five students near the end of his tenure in 1862, although he missed the ceremony due to illness, knowing he was dying of tuberculosis. On October 4, Hoyt tried to resign in a final, poignant letter to William Greenleaf Eliot, who had previously refused to accept his resignation: \\"I need not say,\\" he wrote, \\"that it fills me with inexpressible sadness to feel constrained, at the very noon of life, to ask leave to lay down an office in which I had concentrated every worldly hope and ambition.\\" He died of complications from tuberculosis on November 26, 1862. Of his service to Washington University, one biographer wrote: \\"The institution which he found an academy he left a university.\\" William Greenleaf Eliot referred to him as \\"a perfect educator.\\" Hoyt Hall, a dormitory at Phillips Exeter Academy, is named for Hoyt.

The novel was rejected by several Spanish-language publishers before being published in Buenos Aires in 1982. It became an instant best-seller, was critically acclaimed, and catapulted Allende to literary stardom. The novel was named Best Novel of the Year in Chile in 1982, and Allende received the country's Panorama Literario award. The House of the Spirits has been translated into over 20 languages.Penalva, Joanna. \\"Arts & Culture: Department of Drama Presents ‘The House of the Spirits’,\\" Syracuse University News (November 7, 2017). The book was first conceived by Allende when she received news that her 100-year-old grandfather was dying. She began to write him a letter that ultimately became the manuscript of The House of the Spirits.Beard, Alison. \\"CREATIVITY: Life’s Work: An Interview with Isabel Allende,\\" Harvard Business Review (May 2016). The story details the life of the Trueba family, spanning four generations, and tracing the post-colonial social and political upheavals of Chile – though the country's name and the names of figures closely paralleling historical ones, such as \\"the President\\" or \\"the Poet\\", are never explicitly given. The story is told mainly from the perspective of two protagonists (Esteban and Alba) and incorporates elements of magical realism. Plot summary The story starts with the del Valle family, focusing upon the youngest and the oldest daughters of the family, Clara and Rosa. The youngest daughter, Clara del Valle, has paranormal powers and keeps a detailed diary of her life. Using her powers, Clara predicts an accidental death in the family. Shortly after this, Clara's sister, Rosa the Beautiful, is killed by poison intended for her father who is running for the Senate. Rosa's fiancé, a poor miner named Esteban Trueba, is devastated and attempts to mend his broken heart by devoting his life to restoring his family hacienda, Las Tres Marías, which has fallen into poverty and disrepair. He sends money to his spinster sister who takes care of his arthritic mother in town. Through a combination of intimidation and reward he quickly earns/forces respect and labor from the fearful peasants and turns Tres Marías into a \\"model hacienda\\". He turns the first peasant who spoke to him upon arrival, Pedro Segundo, into his foreman, who quickly becomes the closest thing that Trueba ever has to an actual friend during his life. He rapes many of the peasant women, and his first victim, Pancha García, becomes the mother of his bastard son, Esteban García. Esteban returns to the city to see his dying mother. After her death, Esteban decides to fulfill her dying wish: for him to marry and have legitimate children. He goes to the Del Valle family to ask for Clara's hand in marriage. Clara accepts Esteban's proposal; she herself has predicted her engagement two months prior, speaking for the first time in nine years. During the period of their engagement, Esteban builds what everyone calls \\"the big house on the corner,\\" a large mansion in the city where the Trueba family will live for generations. After their wedding, Esteban's sister Férula comes to live with the newlyweds in the big house on the corner. Férula develops a strong dedication to Clara, which fulfills her need to serve others. However, Esteban's wild desire to possess Clara and to monopolize her love causes him to throw Férula out of the house. She curses him, telling him that he will shrink in body and soul, and die like a dog. Although she misses her sister-in-law, Clara is unable to find her sister-in-law by any means and the gap between her and her husband widens as she devotes her time to her daughter and the mystic arts. Clara gives birth to a daughter named Blanca and later, to twin boys Jaime and Nicolás. The family, which resides in the capital, stays at the hacienda during the summertime. Upon arriving at Tres Marías for the first time, Blanca immediately befriends a young boy named Pedro Tercero, who is the son of her father's foreman. Blanca and Pedro grow up together as best friends despite them being of two different social and economic classes. During their teenage years, Blanca and Pedro Tercero eventually become lovers. After an earthquake that destroys part of the hacienda and leaves Esteban injured, the Truebas move permanently to Las Tres Marías. Clara spends her time teaching, caring for her husband's battered body, and writing in her journals while Blanca is sent to a convent school and the twin boys back to an English boarding school, both of which are located in the city. Blanca fakes an illness so as to be sent back to Las Tres Marías, where she can be with Pedro Tercero, but when she arrives home she finds that Pedro Tercero has been banished from the hacienda by Esteban, on account of his revolutionary communist/socialist ideas. Pedro Tercero meets with Blanca in secret adopting disguises while also spreading his ideas in the form of song to neighboring haciendas. A visiting French count to the hacienda, Jean de Satigny, reveals Blanca's nightly romps with Pedro Tercero to her father. Esteban furiously goes after his daughter and brutally whips her. When Clara expresses horror at his actions, Esteban slaps her, knocking out her front teeth. Clara decides to never speak to him again, reclaims her maiden name and moves out of Tres Marías and back to the city, taking Blanca with her. Esteban, furious and lonely, blames Pedro Tercero for the whole matter; putting a price on the boy's head with the corrupt local police. At this point, Pedro Segundo deserts Esteban, telling him he does not want to be around when Trueba inevitably catches his son. Enraged by Pedro Segundo's departure, Trueba begins hunting for Pedro Tercero himself, eventually tracking him down to a small shack near his hacienda. He only succeeds in cutting off three of Pedro's fingers, and is filled with regret for his uncontrollable furies. Blanca finds out she is pregnant with Pedro Tercero's child. Esteban, desperate to save the family honor, gets Blanca to marry the French count by telling her that he has killed Pedro Tercero. At first, Blanca gets along with her new husband, but she leaves him when she discovers his participation in sexual fantasies with the servants. Blanca quietly returns to the Trueba household and names her daughter Alba. Clara predicts that Alba will have a very happy future and good luck. Her future lover, Miguel, happens to watch her birth, as he had been living in the Trueba House with his sister, Amanda. They move out shortly after Alba's birth. Esteban Trueba eventually moves to the Trueba house in the capital as well, although he continues to spend periods of time in Tres Marías. He becomes isolated from every member of his family except for little Alba, whom he is very fond of. Esteban runs as a senator for the Conservative Party but is nervous about whether or not he will win. Clara speaks to him, through signs, informing him that \\"those who have always won will win again\\" – this becomes his motto. Clara then begins to speak to Esteban through signs, although she keeps her promise and never actually speaks to him again. A few years later, Clara dies peacefully and Esteban is overwhelmed with grief. Alba is a solitary child who enjoys playing make-believe in the basement of the house and painting the walls of her room. Blanca has become very poor since leaving Jean de Satigny's house, getting a small income out of selling pottery and giving pottery classes to mentally handicapped children, and is once again dating Pedro Tercero, now a revolutionary singer/songwriter. Alba and Pedro are fond of each other, but do not know they are father and daughter, although Pedro suspects this. Alba is also fond of her uncles. Nicolás is eventually kicked out by his father, moving, supposedly, to North America. When she is older, Alba attends a local college where she meets Miguel, now a grown man, and becomes his lover. Miguel is a revolutionary, and out of love for him, Alba involves herself in student protests against the conservative government. After the victory of the People's Party (a socialist movement), Alba celebrates with Miguel. Fearing a Communist dictatorship, Esteban Trueba and his fellow politicians plan a military coup of the socialist government. However, when the military coup is set into action, the military men relish their power and grow out of control. Esteban's son Jaime is killed by power-driven soldiers along with other supporters of the government. After the coup, people are regularly kidnapped and tortured. Esteban helps Blanca and Pedro Tercero flee to Canada, where the couple finally find their happiness. The military regime attempts to eliminate all traces of opposition and eventually comes for Alba. She is made the prisoner of Colonel Esteban García, the son of Esteban Trueba's and Pancha Garcia's illegitimate son, and hence the grandson of Esteban Trueba. During an earlier visit to the Trueba house, García had molested Alba as a child. In pure hatred of her privileged life and eventual inheritance, García tortures Alba repeatedly, looking for information on Miguel. He rapes her, thus completing the cycle that Esteban Trueba put into motion when he raped Pancha García. When Alba loses her will to live, she is visited by Clara's spirit who tells her not to wish for death, since it can easily come, but to wish to live. García, fearful of his growing attachment to Alba, discards her. Esteban Trueba manages to free Alba with the help of Miguel and Tránsito Soto, an old friend/prostitute from his days as a young man. After helping Alba write their memoir, Esteban Trueba dies in the arms of Alba, accompanied by Clara's spirit; he is smiling, having avoided Férula's prophecy that he will die like a dog. Alba is pregnant, though whether the child is Miguel's or the product of her rape is unknown. Alba embraces this ambiguity, however, loving her unborn child as above all, it is her own. Alba resolves that she will not seek vengeance on those who have injured her, choosing to believe in the hope that one day the human cycle of hate and revenge will be broken. Alba is revealed to be the narrator of the novel, which she writes while she waits for Miguel and for the birth of her child. Main characters Some of the characters' names are significant, particularly the women's names, which often indicate the personalities of the characters. The names Nívea, Clara, Blanca, and Alba are more or less synonyms, and this is mentioned as a family tradition. (Nívea means snow-white, and can be translated as \\"white\\" as can all the others, though they have specific meanings.) Férula's name means \\"rod\\" in Latin; when used in Spanish it refers to an object used to immobilize a limb, such as a splint or cast. =Clara del Valle Trueba= Clara (one of its translations is the equivalent of English \\"clear\\", although it is also a common female name) is the key female figure in the novel. She is a clairvoyant and telekinetic who is rarely attentive to domestic tasks, but she holds her family together with her love for them and her uncanny predictions. She is the youngest daughter of Severo and Nívea del Valle, wife of Esteban Trueba, and mother of Blanca, Jaime, and Nicolás. Even as a child her strangeness is noticed and seen as a threat to many in her community. Otherwise, her family and devoted Nana protect her from her strangeness. She and her uncle Marcos use her powers to run a fortune-telling centre as she develops other paranormal activities like dream reading. Her uncle eventually leaves in a primitive airplane he built himself, disappearing for many months, assumed dead but later is found to die instead as the result of a 'mysterious African plague' contracted during his travels. Clara practices divining and moving inanimate objects, most notably a three-legged table, and she is surrounded by friends such as the psychic Mora sisters and The Poet. Severo and Nívea del Valle are main characters in another Allende novel. As Clara grows up, she developed her abilities and is even able to communicate with ghosts and spirits. Clara represents love and cherishment. Clara's marriage to Esteban Trubea is something she accepts but she never truly loves him and knows from the beginning that she will never do so. She is uninterested in material things and takes for granted what is her high economic standing. It is not until later after great tragedy that she takes the role of helper/servant instead of dreamy bystander. =Esteban Trueba= Esteban Trueba is the central male character of the novel, and along with his granddaughter Alba, is one of the story's main narrators. In his youth, he seeks the mermaid-like and green- haired Rosa the Beautiful, daughter of Severo and Nívea del Valle, and so he toils in the mines to earn a suitable fortune so that he can support her. However, while he is working in the mines she dies by accidental poisoning: a cruel stroke of fate that changes Esteban's life and hardens his heart. Although he eventually marries Clara (Rosa's sister and youngest daughter of the Del Valles) and raises a large family, Esteban's stubborn and violent ways alienate all those around him. Esteban has a tense relationship with his daughter Blanca but shows genuine love and devotion to his granddaughter Alba. Despite his often violent behavior, he is also devoted to his wife Clara, entering into a state of permanent mourning following her death. As a self- made man who earned all of his wealth from years of work spent improving Tres Marías, Esteban scorns communists and believes them to be lazy and stupid. Later in life he turns to politics where he spends his money and effort trying to prevent the rising Socialist movement within the country. However, after the military coup he loses much of his power and suddenly has to face the fact that he has become an old and weak man. Yet it is not the loss of power, so much as the injury done to his country, that agonizes the highly patriotic Esteban. His realization that he desires the love of his family and peace in his country leads to a pivotal change in his character. In his last days, he slowly loses the rage that has been driving him all his life. He begins to make amends with what's left of his family by helping Blanca and Pedro Tercero escape the country so they can live happily and when Alba is kidnapped by the military he asks his longtime friend Tránsito Soto (who had influence in the military) to help him, so he is ecstatic when Alba is rescued. Esteban dies happily, knowing that he has achieved Clara's posthumous forgiveness. =Blanca Trueba= Blanca is Clara and Esteban's first-born daughter. She spends her childhood between the Truebas' house in the capital and Tres Marías, where she forms an intense connection with a boy named Pedro Tercero García, the son of Esteban's foreman. Their friendship endures, though they only see each other in the summer, and upon adolescence they become lovers. Their love persists even after Pedro is run out of the hacienda by Esteban, because he is putting communist ideas in the other workers' heads. After she becomes pregnant with Pedro Tercero's child, her father forces her to marry Count Jean de Satigny, whom she does not love. After Blanca leaves the Count and returns to the Trueba home, she sees Pedro sporadically, resisting his attempts to persuade her to marry, but their relationship continues. Blanca's reconciliation with her father eventually allows her to flee to Canada with Pedro, where they finally are able to achieve happiness together. Blanca is also able to earn large amounts of money for the first time by selling her clay figurines, which are seen as folk art by Canadians. =Pedro Tercero García= Pedro is the son of the tenant/foreman of Tres Marías, Pedro Segundo García. At a young age, he falls in love with Blanca and is the father of her only child, Alba. In his youth, he spreads socialist ideals to the workers on the hacienda, and later he becomes a revolutionary and a songwriter (his character may be modeled after revolutionary songwriter Victor Jara). After the coup d'état in his country, he and Blanca exile themselves in Canada with Esteban's help. It is mentioned that he resumes his political crusade during his exile in Canada where his music is embraced in translation even if \\"chickens and foxes are underdeveloped creatures\\" in comparison with the \\"eagles and wolves\\" of the North. =Alba Trueba de Satigny= Alba (Spanish for \\"Dawn,\\" while in Latin its meaning is \\"white\\") is the daughter of Blanca and Pedro Tercero García, although for many years of her life she was led to believe that Count de Satigny was her father. From before her birth, her grandmother Clara decreed that she was blessed by the stars. Because of this, Clara said she didn't need to go to school and was raised at home until she was seven. The novel ends with Esteban's death, and Alba sits alone in the vast Trueba mansion beside his body. The last paragraph reveals that she is pregnant, although she does not know (or care) whether the child is Miguel's or the product of the rapes that she endured at the hands of security police, during her imprisonment. = Severo and Nívea del Valle = Severo and Nívea are the parents of Rosa, Clara and several other children. Severo's candidacy for the Liberal Party of Chile promptly came to an end after someone tried to poison him, but got his daughter Rosa instead. Nívea, however, would come to become a prominent social activist for women's liberation. The couple pass away in a gruesome car accident in which Nívea is decapitated and her head lost. The details of the accident were hidden from their daughter Clara, because she was pregnant at the time. However, her intuition brings her to the location of the lost head, which ends up being hidden in the basement since the body had already been buried. = La Nana = Having served the Del Valle and Trueba families all her life, Nana is close with all the children that she had taken care of, especially Clara. She even takes care of Clara's children after Severo's and Nívea's death. Nana passes away in an earthquake and was buried without fanfare. Her body is later moved to the mausoleum with Clara's and Rosa's bodies. = Rosa del Valle = The oldest daughter of Severo and Nívea, Rosa was born with green hair and great beauty. Her unearthly beauty intimidated everyone in the village except for Esteban Trueba, who was enamored with her and sought her hand in marriage. Rosa waits patiently while Esteban slowly accumulates wealth working in the mines in order to feel worthy of Rosa. Esteban returns to find that Rosa had died from consuming poison meant for her father. Though never truly forgetting Rosa, Esteban marries her sister Clara instead. many critics note the similarities to Remedios, La Bella in Márquez's Cien años de soledad. = Jaime Trueba = Jaime is the son of Clara and Esteban Trueba. As a shy, bookish and compassionate doctor who treats the poor, he stands out against his outgoing twin brother Nicolas and his cantankerous father. Jaime had always had a strenuous relationship with his father, especially with Jaime's revolutionary ideals. He becomes friends with the Candidate whilst under the impression that the revolution was to be peaceful. Jaime also becomes good friends with Alba, whom he treats as a sister. He is summoned to the Presidential Palace during the coup and was killed for refusing to announce that the president had drunkenly committed suicide. Esteban doesn't believe it until Jaime appears in spirit to Clara, showing her how he had been murdered by the regime. Jaime may be inspired by the personal doctor Arturo Jiron of the Chilean president Salvador Allende.

Early in the 20th century, Muskoka was poorly served by roads. Vacationers were transported to lodges, or private cottages, via a fleet of steamships. Segwun is one of only three ships in the world still carrying the status of Royal Mail Ship. Ports of call included Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, Beaumaris, Port Sandfield, Port Carling and Bala. History =Construction= RMS Segwun on her maiden voyage to Bracebridge 9 July 1925. Note the separation between the oak lounge forward, and the gentleman's lounge aft on the upper deck. In the 1920s the Muskoka Lakes saw strong growth in tourism as the Canadian economy recovered from the trauma of World War I. By 1924 the Muskoka Lakes Navigation Company found that the six steamers then serving the lakes were growing inadequate to the task and looked to add to their fleet. Rather than commission an entirely new boat, management decided to convert the decommissioned SS Nipissing from a paddle-wheeler to a twin propeller passenger steamer. Nipissings wrought iron hull was built on the Clyde in 1887 and was in service on the lakes from 1887 through 1915. When Segwun was rebuilt on the hull of the second SS Nipissing she was also converted from a side paddle wheel steamer with a walking beam engine into the current two counter-rotating propellers. The conversion was performed at the Navigation Company's yard in Gravenhurst, Ontario during the fall and winter of 1924–5, at which time the bulk of Nipissings machinery was removed, including her engines. Workers installed a new Scotch marine boiler along with two secondhand Doty compound steam engines and stack. The bulk of the two lower decks were retained. A carving of the Phoenix carried atop of Segwuns pilothouse is a replica of the one originally carried on Segwun in 1925. The first Phoenix statue was carved for a second version of SS Nipissing launched in 1887 to replace the original Nipissing destroyed in a fire the previous year. The new version of the Nipissing inherited the engines from the original Nipissing – which had to be raised from the bottom of the lake after the fire, so the second version carried on both the name and steam engine. At the close of the navigation season in 1925, caught fire while being laid up, so in subsequent years the Phoenix was placed on \\"the Sag\\" where it was lost by fire a second time in 1969. SS Sagamo was not rebuilt; however the Phoenix did rise from its ashes and is now carried by the ship for which it was intended. The ship was launched in June, 1925 for the summer passenger season. While originally she was intended to retain the Nipissing name, the extent of the alterations were so extensive that the Navigation Company chose to rename her Segwun, an Ojibwa word meaning \\"springtime\\". =Remodel= The Navigation Company underwent a change in ownership at the end of World War II, when Major Hugh C. MacLean, publisher, sold his 90% interest in the company to a Toronto businessman, Gordon Douglas Fairley. MacLean had owned his share in the company for several decades and the steamship line benefited from promotion in MacLean's publications. Perhaps anticipating another postwar economic boom similar to the 1920s Fairley made some significant investments in the company's fleet. In the off season of 1946–7 Segwun was remodeled. The gentleman's lounge and two staterooms toward the aft of the upper deck were removed and a new series of seven carpeted staterooms were added in their place and connected to the forward oak-paneled lounge. The open space formerly present on that deck just aft of the stack was closed in. Additionally a new steel bulkhead salvaged from Medora was installed in the forward hold to create a crew sleeping area. The changes were generally favorable, but at the cost of increasing the craft's sensitivity to the wind. These changes finalized the silhouette of the ship to this day. =Refit= On 16 September 1949 a fire broke out on , then sailing the Great Lakes and docked at Toronto. Inadequate fire alarms and firefighting equipment allowed the fire to rage out of control resulting in between 118 and 139 deaths. In the aftermath, the Ministry of Transport imposed new fire control requirements on steamships. The Muskoka Lakes Lines, then owner of Segwun and the remaining steamships of the Muskoka Lakes Navigation and Hotel Company, already suffering from declining passenger and freight business due to new competition from the automobile and trucking lines, lacked the resources to re-fit the entire fleet. The Muskoka Lakes Lines filed bankruptcy and the ships were repossessed by the Navigation Company who chose to fit the required equipment only on the flagship Sagamo and her companion Segwun. Segwun was fitted with new hoses and hydrants and sailed the 1950 season, but her occupancy certificate was cut from 243 to only 100 by the Ministry. =Accident= In the 1958 season Segwun received a new captain to replace the aging crew who had long manned the ship. Unfortunately, on his first trip, the captain bumped the swing bridge at Port Carling, almost disabling it, then later struck the concrete dock at the Lockmaster's house, resulting in a badly dented forepeak. =Segwun Museum= Most of these vessels on the Muskoka Lakes were broken up or lost to fire, when roads were built. Segwun, and the fleet's former flagship, RMS Sagamo, the last two remaining vessels in service, were retired in 1958 and Segwun spent decades moored at the Town Dock in Gravenhurst. Sagamo, converted into a floating restaurant, was destroyed in a fire in 1969. Segwun Steamboat Museum, moored next to Sagamo, survived the fire. =Restoration= From 1972 through 1981, Segwun was restored, and put back into service on 27 June 1981. Segwun still maintains its Canada Post 'R.M.S.' designation as an official Royal Mail Ship. As part of a fundraising venture, she once carried her own private label wine which was distributed throughout Ontario by the L.C.B.O.Muskoka Steamship & Historical Society -The Real Muskoka Experience website In 2001 & 2002, Segwun was voted 'Best Large Attraction' by Attractions Canada.

The company was founded by David Ward and Jon Woods and was based in Manchester. Ocean developed dozens of games for a variety of systems such as the ZX Spectrum, Oric 1, Commodore 64, Dragon 32, MSX, Amstrad CPC, Commodore 16, Atari ST, Amiga, PC, BBC micro and video game consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System, Super Nintendo Entertainment System, Master System and Sega Genesis.  History  The company started out as \\"Spectrum Games\\" in 1983, selling arcade clones for various home computers including the ZX81, ZX Spectrum and VIC 20. Although not named after the ZX Spectrum, the name became confusing and was changed to Ocean Software leading to some of their games being re-released with different titles so the Berzerk clone Frenzy was reissued as the Robotics and Missile Attack became Armageddon. Their early releases (Moon Alert, Hunchback, High Noon, Gilligan's Gold, Daley Thompson's Decathlon etc.) were developed in-house, but later in 1984 Ocean Software acquired its former Liverpool rival, the defunct software developer Imagine, and focus shifted from development to publication of games. Also in 1984, Ocean struck a deal with Konami to publish their arcade games for home computers. In 1985, Ocean Software managed to secure the first movie licences, such as Rambo, Short Circuit and Cobra, as well as the TV show Miami Vice and RoboCop which spent about a year on the top of the charts. In 1986, a deal was signed with Taito and Data East for home versions of their arcade games such as Arkanoid, Renegade, Operation Wolf and The NewZealand Story. Also in 1986, Ocean Software created with Marc DJAN Ocean Software France. This studio would create most of the 16-bit arcade conversions between 1986 and 1991, which then became the French marketing and sales subsidiary of Ocean Software Ltd. In 1987, Ocean Software published original games again, after a marginal season filled with licences, resulting in Head over Heels, Match Day II and Wizball. Ocean was voted Best 8-bit Software House of the Year at the 1989 Golden Joystick Awards, along with awards for their 8-bit and 16-bit conversions of Operation Wolf. In 1996, Ocean Software announced a merge with French publisher Infogrames for £100 million. After the merger Infogrames kept Ocean as a separate division publishing their own games until 1998, when they were rebranded to Infogrames United Kingdom Limited and Ocean's last titles would end up being published by Infogrames' European subsidiary, Infogrames Multimedia SA. The company is now named Bandai Namco Entertainment UK Limited after Bandai Namco's purchase of Atari, SA's European assets in 2009.  Tape loaders  One of the most recognisable features of Ocean games on the Commodore 64 was the Ocean Loader. Since cassettes were the most popular storage medium used in Europe for 8-bit computers, loading a game could take around 6 minutes. Ocean used a special loading system that displayed a picture based on the game and played music while the game was loading. Five versions of the tune exist; 1 and 2 were composed by Martin Galway, 3 by Peter Clarke, 4 and 5 by Jonathan Dunn. The Ocean Loader was first used in the game Hyper Sports. Up to 1987 the Ocean Loader was written by the in-house Ocean programmer Bill Barna, from 1987 to the end of the Commodore 64's commercial life the loader was replaced by \\"Freeload\\" written by in house programmer Paul Hughes. Freeload also featured a copyright protection mechanism. On the ZX Spectrum, games after 1984 generally used the Speedlock protection system, which eventually included a countdown timer showing the time left to load a game. In 2004, Paul Hughes released the 6502 source code of some of Ocean's development tools, among them Freeload, into the public domain.  Gameography  = Licensed games = Screenshot of Highlander for the Commodore 64 Ocean was famous for often buying the rights to make video games from different arcade, film and television franchises. Many license games combined several styles for example featuring platform action and car driving. These include RoboCop (1988), Batman The Movie (1989) and RoboCop 3 (1991), which featured 3D graphics in 16-bit versions. The adventure game Hook (1992) also received positive reviews. The 1986 game Batman got a rating of 93% in Crash magazine. Among Ocean's licensed games are: * The Addams Family * The Addams Family: Pugsley's Scavenger Hunt * Addams Family Values * Batman * Batman: The Caped Crusader * Batman: The Movie * Cobra * Cool World * Darkman * Dennis The Menace * Eek the Cat * The Flintstones * Highlander * Hook * Hudson Hawk * Jurassic Park * Knight Rider * Lethal Weapon * Manchester United Championship Soccer * Miami Vice * Navy Seals * Platoon * Rambo * Rambo 3 * Red Heat * RoboCop * RoboCop 2 * RoboCop 3 * Short Circuit * Street Hawk * Terminator 2: Judgment Day * Top Gun * Total Recall * The Transformers * The Untouchables * Waterworld * WWF WrestleMania * WWF European Rampage Tour = Arcade conversions = Ocean also acquired several licenses to develop and publish conversions of arcade games for home computers.

Sigma Pi Fraternity, International has chartered over 230 chapters, with 111 currently active plus six colonies in the United States and Canada and is headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Since its inception, the fraternity has initiated more than 110,000 men and has over 5,000 undergraduate members.

He was a member of the Christian Church and of Masonic Lodges in Tombstone, Arizona and Phoenix. * George Martin Patterson (November 7, 1877 – April 7, 1960): Born in Palmyra, Township, Knox County, Indiana. His ancestors settled in Vincennes before Indiana became a state and was a prominent part in the development of that part of the country. Served as the Deputy Recorder of Knox County and then followed in his father's footsteps of farming. =Founding and early history (1897–1908)= On January 26, 1897, Charlotte N. Mallote, a professor of Latin and French, spoke to a group of students during chapel hour at Vincennes University about College Fraternities. One month later, on February 26, 1897, a new literary society had its first meeting, founded by Rolin Roscoe James, William Raper Kennedy, George Martin Patterson, and James Thompson Kingsbury. The first two initiates of the society were Samuel and Maurice Bayard, who were brought into the organization well before it had a constitution or name. The constitution, name, and first ritual were developed at the home of the Bayard's. The founders soon agreed upon a name, and the society was christened Tau Phi Delta (ΤΦΔ). By the end of its first year in 1898, Tau Phi Delta had 10 members, but the new Fraternity encountered membership struggles at the turn of the 20th century. Many of America's young men left the states to fight in the Spanish–American War. Personal endeavors were paused, as the nation focused all efforts on the war that was raging in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans. Key members of Tau Phi Delta, William Raper Kennedy, Lee B. Purcell, and Maurice Bayard had all left to participate in the war, leaving Rolin Roscoe James as the sole member by the end of the war. James restored the society by initiating five new members shortly after the turn of the 20th century. These new members pressured James to change the name to Theta Gamma Psi (ΘΓΨ), but James successfully argued to keep the society named Tau Phi Delta. In 1903–1904, the Fraternity had grown so large that it ceased to meet at Vincennes, instead meeting at a small cottage nearby, The Bayard Cottage. This structure is considered the fraternity's first chapter house. In 1907, Tau Phi Delta began meeting at the old colonial residence of Judge J.P.L Weems. It was in the Niblack-Weems household that Tau Phi Delta reorganized as Sigma Pi. The home would later play host to the first national congress. William & Mary est. 1931 In 1904–05, Tau Phi Delta finally began to seek expansion to other universities. Although rejected, a local fraternity at Indiana University petitioned to become the second chapter, and Tau Phi Delta began to engage in talks with other local fraternities at nearby universities. These discussions ultimately ended without expansion. Additional chapters would eventually be added after Tau Phi Delta became Sigma Pi on February 11, 1907. In May 1908 the fraternity had its first National Convocation in Vincennes and charters were granted to groups at the University of Illinois (Phi chapter) and Ohio State University (Gamma chapter). Francis L. Lisman was elected as the fraternity's first Grand Sage. =Patterson episode: how Sigma Pi got its name= Robert George Patterson (of no relation to the founder) was only 11 years old in 1896, when he first heard William Jennings Bryan speak. Patterson was convinced Jennings Bryan was the greatest American of his time. Shortly after the presidential election of 1896, Patterson read Jennings Bryan's autobiography The First Battle, which revealed Jennings Bryan was a member of Sigma Pi, a literary society at Illinois College in Jacksonville, Illinois. Patterson was determined to attend the college and follow the footsteps of Jennings Bryan. However, Patterson's parents forced him to attend the nearby Ohio State University, prohibiting him from joining the literary society that only existed at Illinois College. Patterson still desired to become a member of the prestigious Sigma Pi. He wrote Sigma Pi at the Illinois College to petition for expansion, but was rejected as the society refused to expand. Patterson also contacted another fraternity named Sigma Pi at the University of Toronto to request expansion, but was again rejected. In 1907, Patterson learned of Tau Phi Delta and wrote them asking if they would \\"consolidate with us and become a chapter of Sigma Pi Fraternity.\\" Despite seeking to expand, Sigma Pi did not actually exist; Patterson was its sole member. Tau Phi Delta agreed and planned to consolidate. Patterson himself faked and made up the entire history of his Sigma Pi. Patterson stated it was founded in 1752 at the College of William & Mary and historical elites such as James Madison, Thomas Jefferson, Robert E. Lee, Jefferson Davis, and others were members. He claimed Sigma Pi failed during the Revolutionary War, but was kept alive by passing down its traditions from father to son. According to Patterson, Sigma Pi was revived in 1801 by Payne Todd, step-son of alleged member James Madison. He claimed Sigma Pi was successful until its repression by the Anti-Masonic Party in 1835. Patterson was the first to bring about its public revival since the repression. Under this guise Sigma Pi expanded and added several chapters. William Jennings Bryan In 1909, Patterson's lies and fallacies began to collapse. The World Almanac published Patterson's Sigma Pi on its list of fraternities. It listed its founding date as 1752 and William Jennings Bryan as its most famous alumnus. Upon hearing this, Jennings Bryan sent letters to inform the magazine of its mistake and denounce his inclusion as its alumni. Jennings Bryan was a brother of the Delta Chi. He never belonged to any organization at the College of William & Mary, just Delta Chi Fraternity and Sigma Pi Literary Society at the College of Illinois. Furthermore, when Patterson submitted materials for Sigma Pi Fraternity's inclusion in William Raimond Baird's 7th edition of Baird's Manual of American College Fraternities, it was rejected. Discussing the request for inclusion, Baird wrote \\"all statements concerning the alleged origin of this society are inherently incredible.\\" He suggested the story seemed to \\"be the product of a rather sophomoric imagination.\\" Sigma Pi Fraternity, still unaware of Patterson's lies, appealed to Baird to reconsider. Baird refused and eventually published an article ridiculing Sigma Pi Fraternity to the entire Greek community. Patterson was immediately expelled from the society and all records bearing his name were deleted. Only in the second half of the 20th century did Sigma Pi research and include this incident in its history. With the expulsion of Patterson at end of 1909, Sigma Pi had 5 chapters: Vincennes University, University of Illinois, Ohio State University, Temple University, and the University of Pennsylvania. At this time the Fraternity redesigned its badge, coat of arms, and ritual, becoming Sigma Pi as it is known today. =Early Growth: 1910–World War II= Sigma Pi survived the embarrassment of the Patterson Incident and continued to grow. In 1910, the fraternity co- founded and became part of the National Interfraternity Conference, now known as the North American Interfraternity Conference. On July 15, 1911 Sigma Pi's official publication, The Emerald, was first published, although it would not be regularly published until 1914. In 1913, Iota, the first chapter west of the Mississippi River was installed at the University of California, Berkeley. World War I saw only the Kappa chapter at Temple University close, although many others operated on a \\"skeleton\\" basis. The fraternity was able to expand when men returned home at the end of the war and began, or resumed, their education. By 1918 there were 14 chapters in seven states from California to New York. In 1920 the fraternity produced its first song book, The Songs of Sigma Pi. The book was produced by brothers James P. deWolfe, Herman S. Sidener, and Philip W. Timberlake. That same year the fraternity opened its first chapter in the American south with the Omicron chapter at Tulane University. Plans were first made for the creation of the Sigma Pi Foundation in 1922. The fund sold life memberships to alumni and was an endowment fund for the fraternity. Money raised was used to help chapters purchase housing and to fund other fraternity needs. Life memberships also came with a lifetime subscription to The Emerald. The fund was formally chartered in the State of Indiana on February 26, 1923. From 1920–1927, Sigma Pi doubled in number of chapters and established a national office on May 16, 1927. The first office was located in Roselle, NJ in the home of fraternity's first executive director, Harold Jacobsen. This small room was quickly overwhelmed and a 200 square foot office at 122 Chestnut Street was rented. On February 23, 1929 proper office space was rented in rooms 322 and 323 of the Martin Building on Jefferson Avenue in Elizabeth, NJ which became the new national office. In 1931 the fraternity produced its first pledge manual with brothers Oscar E. Gerney, Benjamin V. Ogden, and Harold Jacobsen being on the committee that produced it. That same year, the fraternity saw the first publication of the Keryx newsletter. In 1937, Mississippi State University chapter was installed, becoming the first new chapter formed from a colony. Before the Alpha-Lambda chapter, all new chapters had been fraternities or societies already in existence that agreed to consolidate into Sigma Pi. That same year the fraternity hired brother James Hauser as its first field representative. By May 1940, Sigma Pi had 34 active chapters and 2 inactive chapters, and had begun using the new I Believe pledge manual. World War II decimated the fraternity, causing it to almost disappear entirely. As all able bodied young men left to fight for their country or to serve in defense plants, few college aged men remained. By the end of the war, Sigma Pi had only 11 active chapters. =Post War era: 1945-1980= Brother Wally Schirra entering capsule Sigma 7 (1962) Following World War II, many veterans attended college under the GI Bill. Sigma Pi, again, took advantage of the spur in college enrollment. By 1950 Sigma Pi had grown to 53 chapters, 7 of which remained inactive. In 1960, the Fraternity had grown to 63 chapters. In 1945, Byron R. Lewis made a contribution to the fraternity to start an educational fund to provide scholarships to worthy brothers. This gift was the start of the Byron R. Lewis Educational Foundation which incorporated in 1952. The chartering of Beta-Kappa chapter at Arizona State University in 1951 was a special one for Sigma Pi. Beta-Kappa is the only chapter (other than Alpha) to have a founder, James Thompson Kingsbury, assist with its founding. Kingsbury assisted with the start of the Sigma Pi colony but died before the chapter received its charter. During the 1960s the fraternity added 39 chapters, giving it 109 total chapters. In 1961, Vincennes University (through the work of Curtis Shake and Isaac K. Beckes) donated the Shadowwood estate to the fraternity for use as its national headquarters. After renovations in 1962 to Shadowwood's plumbing, heating, and electricity the fraternity moved its national office into the home on July 1, 1963. 1964 saw the merging of a national fraternity into Sigma Pi. A 1953 edict by the New York State Board of Regents prohibited any national fraternity from existing at any state-funded university. This forced many chapters of Delta Kappa fraternity to close or become local fraternities. The fraternity had been founded in New York state and half of its chapters were effected. Delta Kappa's national structure was weakened after the edict, but chapters in the rest of the country were determined to continue their national tradition. After ten years of trying to recover, Delta Kappa's national leadership began looking for another fraternity for its chapters to join. They petitioned Sigma Pi for membership for their six remaining chapters. This was approved in 1964 and four Delta Kappa chapters were re-initiated as members of Sigma Pi. William J. Cutbirth became the first Sigma Pi to be president of the North American Interfraternity Conference when he was elected to a term running from 1974 to 1976. =International era, 1980-Present= The 1980s saw growth in the fraternity as it chartered 42 new chapters during the decade. In 1984 Sigma Pi became an international organization upon the chartering of the first Canadian chapter (Zeta-Iota at Western Ontario), ushering the fraternity to change its name to the current title, Sigma Pi Fraternity International. In 1988, the fraternity was bequeathed the Rose Hill Farmstead by the family of founder George Martin Patterson. The property was visible from the Shadowwood headquarters. The fraternity sold the property to the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation in 1992. In 2003, the fraternity moved its international offices to Brentwood, TN as it was not as isolated as Vincennes. Being closer to a major city allowed for better access to airports and computer network infrastructure. The fraternity rented offices in the Gallatin Building until a property could be purchased. The fraternity sold the Shadowwood Estate in 2005 to a private individual. An office was found on Wilson Pike Circle and the fraternity's offices moved there in 2007. In 2013, the fraternity sold the property on Wilson Pike Circle and purchased the Mitchell House in Lebanon, Tennessee from Cracker Barrel Old Country Store for use as its headquarters. It held the grand opening of the building on March 29, 2014. After more than five years at the Mitchell House, the Executive Office moved to a new location near downtown Nashville and the Nashville International Airport. =Alpha chapter at Vincennes University: preserving Sigma Pi's history= Sigma Pi Centennial Clock Tower at Alpha chapter (Vincennes University) After its founding in 1897, the Alpha chapter at Vincennes University closed in 1910. It remained dormant for 55 years until 1965 when the Alpha chapter was re-activated. Grand Sage Frank C. Fryburg worked with the students and administration at Vincennes to re-activate the chapter. However, the North American Interfraternity Conference prevented its members from opening chapters at 2 year Junior colleges. Honorary Grand Sage Curtis G. Shake was tasked with creating a formal petition to the NIC, which requested special dispensation be granted to Sigma Pi to reopen the chapter. The petition passed and on February 26, 1965, Alpha chapter was re-charted. In December 1970, the success of the Alpha chapter convinced the NIC to allow chapters at all junior colleges. A clock tower on the campus of Vincennes University commemorates the foundation of Sigma Pi. Despite Sigma Pi's diminished presence in the area after the move of its headquarters, the fraternity still recognizes and celebrates the university as its birthplace. The Alpha chapter is still active today, claiming some of the university's most notable alumni, including three Vincennes University Presidents, as members. Government Sigma Pi has three main subordinate bodies: chapters, Alumni Clubs, and colonies. A colony is started by a group of men at a university, who are interested in joining Sigma Pi. No man in a colony is initiated, until the chapter is chartered. An active chapter is composed of at least twenty-five active members and is also in good standing with their respective college or university and with the Grand chapter. To be in good standing with the Grand chapter, a chapter must pay all financial debts, be in good judicial standing, and host all required events. Alumni Clubs are composed of Sigma Pi members, who are no longer undergraduates, but retain their affiliation with Sigma Pi. Alumni Clubs are created by geography or for a particular chapter. All three are important in the continued success of Sigma Pi. Sigma Pi is governed by its Constitution and Bylaws, as well as the rules and regulations of the North-American Interfraternal Conference. Individual chapters are also subjected to the regulations of the administration of their school and the local Interfraternal Council. Sigma Pi Fraternity has resolved to hold its chapters accountable for compliance with all Grand chapter and University policies, FIPG guidelines, new member education policies, minimum standards on chapter membership, and adherence to the governing laws of the Fraternity. Any man, who meets the requirements, may be offered a bid to membership. Honorary membership may be extended to relatives of members, alumni and members of the faculty or administration of a university. Once accepting membership, all men are governed by the Bylaws and Constitution of Sigma Pi. The Constitution and Bylaws of Sigma Pi are reviewed and may be changed by a favorable vote at a Convocation held biennially. Sigma Pi is ruled by a Grand chapter, which reflects the structure that governs individual chapters. Individual chapters and the Grand chapter are ruled by Robert's Rules of Order. =Grand Chapter= The Grand Chapter consists of chapter and alumni club delegates, past, present, and honorary Grand Officers, and Founders' Award recipients. The Grand Chapter is headed by the Grand Council. Each alumni club is given 1 vote. Each chapter in good standing is given 2 votes. A colony receives no votes until is it charted and becomes a chapter. Robert's Rules of Order dictate meetings of the Grand chapter. The Grand Chapter has full jurisdiction over the Fraternity, elects officers, amends the Constitution and Bylaws and possesses all powers of a legislative assembly. Meetings of the Grand chapter are held every two years at a Convocation. Each chapter is required to send one delegate. When the Grand Chapter is not in session, all governmental power is vested in the Grand Council. The Grand Council consists of 7 officers, who are elected at the Biennial Convocation for a term of two years. Before 2010, the Grand Council previously was concerned with policy creation and the implementation. In 2010, Sigma Pi changed its governance policy, as it decided the Grand Council was too pre-occupied with implementation to be truly effective. The Grand Council has become essentially a Board of Governors. They design end policies based upon dialogue with members. The Executive Office Staff at the Lebanon, Tennessee Headquarters then determines the means by which the policies will be achieved and implemented. Any member of Sigma Pi may be elected to any of the seven positions on the Grand Chapter. Generally candidates have served on the Grand Chapter previously. The Bylaws of Sigma Pi allow the Grand Chapter to maintain two standing committees: scholarship and expansion. =Grand Council structure= The titles and roles of the government of Sigma Pi at the Grand and chapter level are summarized below: # Grand Sage (President) – Presides over the Fraternity, as well as acting as Chairman and Chief Governance Officer. He leads the discussions of the chapter. #Grand Second Counselor (Vice President) – Assumes the role of Sage, when the Sage is absent or unable to perform his duties. He also is in charge of the committees to ensure they accomplish what has been assigned to them. # Grand Third Counselor (Treasurer) – Controls the financials of the fraternity and makes sure all decisions are financially sound. # Grand Fourth Counselor (Secretary) – Controls the minutes of meetings, as well as all correspondence. He also keeps accurate records of membership. # Grand First Counselor (Sergeant at Arms) – Acts as a parliamentarian, risk management, alumni secretary. # Grand Herald (Historian) – Keeps historical records of Sigma Pi. # Past Grand Sage – Provides continuity. =Differences between Grand Chapter and chapters= The government of individual chapters mirrors the Grand Chapter, except the use of the prefix \\"Grand.\\" Since the Grand Council has essentially become a Board of Directors using policy governance, the traditional roles of each member of the Grand Council are no longer strictly followed. However, in the individual chapters this is not the case; a chapter's executive council follow the traditional duties of their position. chapters are required to maintain scholarship, recruitment, pledge education, finance, social, and intramural committees. They are encouraged, but not required, to have: alumni relations, public relations, risk management, and community service. Each chapter is required to have an adviser, generally encouraged to be an alumnus or faculty member, but may be anyone. They are free to make any rules that do not conflict with the regulations of Sigma Pi International, National Laws, individual rules of the Interfraternal Council, and their college or university. =Executive Office and Executive Director= The Executive Office, located in Nashville, Tennessee, serves as an information and service center as well as being the primary record keeper of the fraternity. Information and assistance is available for all phases of chapter operations. All templates of forms and other materials are kept at the Executive Office. All of the Fraternity's publications are prepared and distributed at the Executive Offices. A small museum also exists at the Executive Office which consists of items donated by famous members and artifacts from the Fraternity's history. As noted the Grand Chapter and Grand Council simply dictate end policies. After dictating end policies, the implementation of those policies falls on the Executive Office. The Chief Executive Officer or Executive Director is responsible for the management of the headquarters, including all staff and operations of the Fraternity. He devotes his time to the interests of the Fraternity, reports directly to the Grand Sage, and is responsible to the orders of the Grand Council. He is required to maintain full and accurate records of the business affairs of Sigma Pi. He gives periodic reports to the Grand Council, Grand Chapter, and Convocations. The Executive Director previously traveled to chapters to advise them personally. But with the large size of the fraternity over the entire country, this became impractical and unhelpful. Sigma Pi initially created the Educational Leadership Consultants (ELC) program to fill this role. An ELC was a young alumnus selected for the position based on his undergraduate education and experience. He underwent a training period to prepare him for his advising role then traveled to all chapters in his jurisdiction. He then helped them develop programs to improve their chapters. This program was replaced in 2013 with the Regional Director's Program. This program consisted of older alumni who would assist chapters in specific geographical regions. Executive Director Jonathan Frost will implement a new Chapter Management Associate system, which will be put in place prior to the 2018–2019 academic year. Foundations of membership Sigma Pi house at the University of Illinois at Urbana Sigma Pi, like many social fraternities, limits membership to men only. Requirements can vary by campus, depending on the rules of the university or college and the standards dictated by the campus Interfraternity Council. Generally Sigma Pi requires members to be in good academic standing and be active in the campus community. Potential members meet the brothers of a chapter during a process called rush. Following rush, the chapter convenes and votes on potential new members. With a favorable vote by the entire chapter, a potential new member will be offered a bid to join the local Sigma Pi chapter. If accepted, the man begins his pledgeship. Sigma Pi defines a pledge as \\"a man who has assented to become a member and who has been elected to membership, but has not yet been initiated.\\" During this period the pledge and the Fraternity come to know each other better and mutually reaffirm the decision to become full members in Sigma Pi. During his pledgeship, a man will learn about the Fraternity's history, operations, and reasons for existence. He will also learn how his specific chapter operates and what is expected of him as a brother. A pledge has no right to exert influence on chapter policy or organization until he is granted full membership upon initiation; however, a pledge should still participate in conversations about chapter policy and organization with initiated members. Generally the pledge should speak through his big brother or the new member educator. Sigma Pi Fraternity International has a strict no hazing policy. Briefly Sigma Pi defines hazing as anything that produces physical or mental stress. A pledge surrenders no legal or social rights, none of his personal or family ties, nor any of his moral or religious ideas or standards, when accepting an invitation to join Sigma Pi. Although not an initiated member, a pledge should not be viewed as less than or unequal to a member. He simply does not know the secrets and rituals of Sigma Pi. His status as a pledge in no way entitles members to treat him any differently than any other member of Sigma Pi. Although a pledge may not know everything about Sigma Pi, he is still governed by the expectations and rules of Sigma Pi. Some of the important principles, ideals and obligations are expressed below. =Sigma Pi Motto= Robert Browning, a key influence of the founders The mother of the first two initiates of Sigma Pi, Samuel and Maurice Bayard, chose the Fraternity's motto during one of the first meetings. There was much debate about the appropriate motto, and no agreement could be reached among the members. Attempting to point the fraternity in the right direction, Ms. Joseph L. Bayard (née Orr) took a volume of Robert Browning's poems from a shelf, turned to A Death in the Desert, reading what would become the motto. =Five ideals= Sigma Pi Fraternity promotes five basic ideals, which a brother considers to be of extreme worth. Each ideal is mentioned in the Creed of Sigma Pi. Each ideal represents goals which every member is encouraged to strive toward in their own daily life. #The First Ideal: To establish a brotherhood. #The Second Ideal: To establish and maintain an aristocracy of learning. #The Third Ideal: To raise the standards of morality and develop character. #The Fourth Ideal: To diffuse culture and encourage chivalry. #The Fifth Ideal: To promote the spirit of civic righteousness and quicken the national conscience. =Creed= By committing to Sigma Pi, Brothers also strive to follow the five ideals as expressed in the Sigma Pi Creed. It is the guide and ideal around which a brother patterns his life. =Ten obligations of members= Sigma Pi demands its members have a reasonable amount of interest and participation in its affairs. Sigma Pi's expectations are summarized by the 10 obligations. All brothers are expected to regard each obligation with utmost seriousness and strive to work towards their fulfillment. If properly followed, these obligations help make Sigma Pi chapters run effectively and efficiently as well as making Sigma Pi men outstanding members of their communities and society. #The First Obligation: Give proper attention to the interests of Sigma Pi. #The Second Obligation: Regard the Fraternity with a spirit of sincerity and respect and give earnest considerations to its teachings and ideals. #The Third Obligation: Meet Financial Obligations Promptly And Fully. #The Fourth Obligation: Cheerfully perform tasks that may be assigned for the good of the Fraternity. #The Fifth Obligation: At all times be a gentleman and use moderation in all things. #The Sixth Obligation: Strive at all times to cooperate for the good of the Fraternity. #The Seventh Obligation: Work diligently to maintain good scholarship. #The Eighth Obligation: Participate in worthy college activities. #The Ninth Obligation: Profit by associations with men in a spirit of fraternalism. #The Tenth Obligation: Be an exemplary Sigma Pi and citizen. =Expectations of membership= Sigma Pi has several expectations of members to help them gain the most from their membership in Sigma Pi. These expectations are expressed below. # I will respect the dignity of all persons, and therefore, I will not physically, psychologically, or sexually abuse any human being. # I will respect the rights of property, both others and my own; therefore I will not, nor will I tolerate, the abuse of private or community property. # I will pay all of my financial obligations in a timely manner. # I will not use nor support the use of illegal drugs. # I will not abuse nor support the abuse of alcohol. # I acknowledge that a clean and an attractive environment is essential to both physical and mental health; therefore, I will do all in my power to see that the chapter property is properly cleaned and maintained. # I will confront the members of my Fraternity who are violating the bylaws and policies. Philanthropy Sigma Pi encourages a fraternal culture that promotes its ideals by philanthropic events for its members and the communities in which its chapters are located. Each chapter is required to complete regular philanthropy events and participate in Sigma Pi's Altruistic Campus Experience (ACE). The ACE project is in addition to each chapter's normal philanthropy events that it holds throughout the year. Finally, Sigma Pi's Educational Fund provides assistance to students to cover the costs of college tuition. =General philanthropy= Every two years at the Biennium Convention, Sigma Pi selects a new charity as the official philanthropy of Sigma Pi. At times Sigma Pi will select more than one charity. Usually Sigma Pi selects charities created by or for brothers and their families. By doing this Sigma Pi hopes to turn tragedies into rallying points to help promote a cause that has affected brothers and their families. Medal of Honor Recipient Brother Major General James Livingston meeting with troops. At this time Sigma Pi focuses its philanthropic efforts on two organizations for the next two years; the Amazing Day Foundation, and Donate Life America. Additionally, Sigma Pi requires each individual chapter to sponsor philanthropy events throughout the academic school year. Sigma Pi even encourages chapters to participate in Philanthropy events that occur during breaks and summers. The Fraternity currently allows each individual chapter to assist any charitable cause as they see fit. =Educational fund= Beginning in 1947, Honorary Grand Sage Byron R. Lewis (Member of both the Alpha and Phi chapters) donated several monetary gifts, recommending that the money be used to begin an educational fund. In his name the Byron R. Lewis Educational Fund was established. Its stated goals were to: \\"supplement the work of colleges in the educational development of students; to assist needy and deserving students to complete their education; and to aid aged or disabled former students who are in need or worthy of assistance.\\" In 1992, the fund was renamed the Sigma Pi Educational Foundation. Any Sigma Pi member in good standing may become a member of the Educational Foundation by contributing an annual 100 dollar membership fee or $5,000 in lifetime gifts. In 2000, the Foundation's assets were worth more than 2.3 million dollars. The Educational foundation's growth supports Sigma Pi members in their continuing quest for education. At the 2012 Convocation in San Antonio, Texas, Sigma Pi unanimously voted to collect 5 dollars per undergraduate member per year specifically for the educational foundation. =Altruistic Campus Experience= The \\"ACE\\" (Altruistic Campus Experience) Project began in the fall of 2002 when Former Executive Director Mark Briscoe re-evaluated the role of Greek life on campus. The project is the first fraternity or sorority campus service program for chapters specifically designed to benefit their host institutions. The program is designed to improve the campuses, on which chapters are located, thereby improving the collegiate experience for the entire college or university. Every project is unique to the individual campuses of each chapter. chapters are asked to determine a campus need and work to fill that need. The university must be aware of and approve the project prior to beginning the project. Publications Sigma Pi has several publications, which aid its operations. Each serves a specific purpose within the Fraternity that helps Sigma Pi in all facets of membership. The fraternity has promotional literature to help promote Greek Life in general but also membership in Sigma Pi. Manuals are produced that aid the pledge education process, as well as all ritual information. Sigma Pi finally produces a magazine to keep alumni members informed. These publications are all written, edited, and updated at Sigma Pi's Headquarters in Lebanon, Tennessee. =The Emerald of Sigma Pi= Commonly referred to as The Emerald, the magazine is published three time a year. It is sent to initiated members, libraries, Greek advisors, other Greek organizations, and any other subscribers. Louis L. Moore (Kappa, Temple University) edited the magazine's first issue, which was published July 15, 1911. Due to the lack of financial support, The Emerald was not published again for nearly 3 years. Luther C. Weeks (Eta, Purdue University) published three issues starting in October 1914. Weeks' Emerald created the standard for its publication that still exists today. The Emerald is designed to inform members of the progress and circumstances surrounding Sigma Pi on a national and chapter level. Many of the articles are produced by individual chapters and brothers. Each chapter's herald writes a brief article with pictures detailing its activities. Each chapter's essay is published. Alumni are also encourages to write brief articles about their life progress. The Emerald helps keep alumni connected to Sigma Pi, which asks for membership that lasts a lifetime. =The Keryx= The Keryx was created in July 1931 to be the esoteric publication of Sigma Pi. It has been printed in many different formats over the years. Its purpose is to bring news of important matters and activities relating to the Fraternity's welfare to every initiated member. It may include financial statements of the Grand Chapter, Convocation proceedings, and reports on Grand Council meetings. =The Manual of Ceremonies= The Manual of Ceremonies is the printed book, which contains the rituals of Sigma Pi. Each chapter is only allowed to have six copies of The Manual of Ceremonies. It is the chapter's duty to safeguard this publication and make sure only initiated members see it. =I Believe – The Sigma Pi Pledge Manual= First published in 1940, the I Believe is distributed to every man who pledges Sigma Pi and pays his pledge deposit. The I Believe contains information on the history of fraternities in general, general etiquette, the value of membership in Sigma Pi, Sigma Pi's ideals, history, and government among many other topics. It is the comprehensive and complete guide to everything a new member must know before becoming an initiated member in Sigma Pi. =Who's Who in Sigma Pi= Who's Who in Sigma Pi is a directory of every member of Sigma Pi. It is published at least once a decade, but all records are kept on computers for viewing at any time by Executive Office Staff or initiated member through the MySigmaPi online portal. It has both alphabetical and geographical information on members. Geographical information can be sorted by region or chapter. =Song book= The first publication, entitled Songs of Sigma Pi, was published in 1922. The song book was not reprinted until 1968, when Sigma Pi Sings was published. It was edited by William L. Lane and included all the songs that the Fraternity considered important with lyrics and sheet music.  Notable Sigma Pi alumni  Main article: List of Sigma Pi brothers and alumni With more than 120 active chapters and colonies in the United States and Canada, Sigma Pi has over 100,000 alumni. Sigma Pi has alumni who are notable in many different industries and fields. Some notable controversies In November 2014, the chapter at Elon University temporarily lost its charter after its national office and Elon officials were notified about several new members suffering injuries from being forced to lie down on bottle caps. The chapter was a repeat hazing offender. The chapter is eligible to seek reinstatement on campus in fall 2017. In December 2016, a former chapter of the fraternity made national headlines after disturbing photos leaked of former members hazing at the then-closed Hofstra University chapter. A former pledge and expelled member of the fraternity leaked photos showing individuals who appear to be pledges locked in small cages and photos showing additional individuals who appear to be pledges shirtless, blindfolded, covered in hot sauce, and kneeling in front of a swastika. On March 1, 2016 - nine months prior to the release of these photos - the Grand Council of Sigma Pi revoked the chapter's charter due to \\"violations of both Fraternity and FIPG risk management policies.\\"http://thehofstrachronicle.com/alleged-sigma-pi-hazing-involved- induced-vomiting-cage-anti-semitic-imagery/ In October 2016, Gamma-Sigma chapter at the University of Missouri opted to withdraw from the university's Greek community due to alleged overzealous enforcement of the student code of conduct against members of the chapter. Shortly after the chapter withdrew from the Greek community, the University of Missouri banned Sigma Pi from campus. This rift was caused when a pledge was sent to an emergency room with bruises on his buttocks and a blood alcohol level of 0.34.http://www.columbiamissourian.com/news/higher_education/documents-reveal- repeated-violations-at-mu-fraternities-and-inconsistent- sanctions/article_41dbc392-c2eb-11e6-a80f-0f168216a030.html In March 2017, the Executive Office of Sigma Pi opted to close its colony at Illinois Wesleyan University after an investigation launched due to a member of the colony being pulled over for drunk driving. The investigation found that the colony may have sponsored an event where underage drinking could have occurred. This was the colony's first offense, though a prior iteration of Sigma Pi on this campus faced its own risk management problems. The colony was noted in this case to have a \\"failure to attend to the culture of risk management.\\" http://collections.carli.illinois.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/iwu_argus/id/38937 In November 2018, the Boulder chapter of Sigma Pi was ordered to cease operations after 5 students from the University of Colorado Boulder told police that they were drugged during a party at the Sigma Pi fraternity house. As of November 2, 2018, police and Sigma Pi are investigating the allegations. In mid-November 2018, a pledge was found unresponsive and later pronounced dead at an unofficial annex house to Ohio University's Epsilon chapter of Sigma Pi. The chapter was issued a cease and desist by the school's administration and the incident is under investigation by Ohio University and Athens, Ohio police. In April 2019, Ohio University permanently barred Sigma Pi from operating at any of its campuses. Current Sigma Pi members are additionally barred from joining any other social fraternity on campus or creating or colonizing a new fraternity. In February 2019, the estate of the deceased pledge, Collin Wiant, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Sigma Pi alleging that Wiant and other pledges were hazed. This hazing included being forced to drink a gallon of beer in one hour, and be beaten and humiliated. The suit alleges that this pattern of activity ultimately resulted in Wiant's death. On April 12, 2019, a University at Buffalo chapter caused all Greek life at the university to be suspended along with the creation of a new internal review committee for Greek Life following potential hazing. The student, Sebastian Serafin-Bazan, died five days later. The investigation is ongoing as of April 17, 2019.

The sloop then sailed around Cape Horn and proceeded to Valparaíso, Chile, in early 1818. The Chilean War of Independence at this time was in full swing and a Spanish blockade of Valparaíso had been declared, with American merchantmen ships being seized. Through diplomatic negotiations with authorities at that port, Captain Biddle succeeded in achieving the release of captured U.S. ships, and then departed north, arriving off Cape Disappointment on the Columbia River on 19 August. There the ship claimed both sides of the river for the United States and next sailed south, touching at Monterey, California, for supplies, becoming the first American naval vessel to visit the three future Pacific coast states.

He died in Dublin aged 39, of pneumonia, his death certificate listing him as an accountant.Death Ceritificate: Percy Edwin Ludgate Irish Genealogy.ie It seems that Ludgate worked as a clerk for an unknown corn merchants, in Dublin, and pursued his interest in calculating machines at night. Charles Babbage in 1843 and Ludgate in 1909 designed the only two mechanical analytical engines before the electromechanical analytical engine of Leonardo Torres y Quevedo of 1920 and its few successors, and the six first-generation electronic analytical engines of 1949. Working alone, Ludgate designed an analytical engine while unaware of Babbage's designs, although he later went on to write about Babbage's machine. Ludgate's engine used multiplication as its base mechanism (unlike Babbage's which used addition). It incorporated the first multiplier-accumulator (MAC), and was the first to exploit a MAC to perform division (using multiplication seeded by reciprocal, via the convergent series ). Ludgate's engine used a mechanism similar to slide rules, but employed his unique discrete Logarithmic Indexes (now known as Irish logarithms (Boys, 1909)), and provided a very novel memory using concentric cylinders, storing numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles. His design featured several other novel features, including for program control (e.g. preemption and subroutines – or microcode, depending on viewpoint). The design is so different from Babbage's as to be a second type of analytical engine, preceding the third (electromechanical) and fourth (electronic) types. The engine's precise mechanism is unknown as the only written accounts of the engine which survive do not detail its workings, although he stated in 1914 that \\"[c]omplete descriptive drawings of the machine exist, as well as a description in manuscript\\" – these have never been found. He was one of a few independent workers in the field of science and mathematics. His inventions were worked on outside a lab. He worked on the inventions only part-time, often until the early hours of the morning. Many publications refer to him as an accountant, but that came eight years after his 1909 analytical engine paper. Little is known about his personal life, as his only records are his scientific writings. The best source of information about Ludgate and his significance lie in the work of Professor Brian Randell. As from 2016, a further investigation is underway at Trinity College, Dublin under the auspices of The John Gabriel Byrne Computer Science Collection. He died of pneumonia in 1922, and is buried in Mount Jerome Cemetery in Dublin.

On average they weigh about .Diversity of Soil Fauna and Ecosystem Function, Biology International. Retrieved on October 23, 2008. They have a dark purple head and a blue-grey body, and about 300 to 400 body segments. Ecology They live in the subsoil of blue, grey or red clay soils along stream banks and some south- or west- facing hills of their remaining habitat which is in Gippsland in Victoria, Australia. These worms live in deep burrow systems and require water in their environment to respire. They have relatively long life spans for invertebrates and can take 5 years to reach maturity. They breed in the warmer months and produce egg capsules that are to in length which are laid in their burrows. When these worms hatch in 12 months they are around long at birth. Unlike most earthworms which deposit castings on the surface, they spend almost all their time in burrows about in depth and deposit their castings there, and can generally only be flushed out by heavy rain. They are usually very sluggish, but when they move rapidly through their burrows, it can cause an audible gurgling or sucking sound which allows them to be detected.Action Statement: Giant Gippsland Earthworm. Retrieved on July 23, 2012. Threatened status Gippsland earthworm colonies are small and isolated, and the species' low reproductive rates and slow maturation make those small populations vulnerable.Victoria Resources Online: Giant Gippsland Earthworm . Retrieved on July 23, 2012. Their natural habitats are grasslands, and while they can survive beneath pastures, cultivation, heavy cattle grazing and effluent run- off are adversarial to the species. The Gippsland earthworm requires moist loamy soil to thrive; dense tree planting negatively affects soil humidity, which in turn negatively affects the species' habitat. No successful breeding has yet been achieved in captivity. Education Until it closed in 2012 amid animal welfare concerns, Wildlife Wonderland Park near Bass, Victoria, was home to the Giant Earthworm Museum. Inside the worm-shaped museum, visitors could crawl through a magnified replica of a worm burrow and a simulated worm's stomach.

It was said that his father was told in a dream by a Dominican friar that his son would be famous throughout the world. His mother is said never to have experienced pain when she gave birth to him. He was named after St. Vincent Martyr, the patron saint of Valencia. He would fast on Wednesdays and Fridays and he loved the Passion of Christ very much. He would help the poor and distribute alms to them. He began his classical studies at the age of eight, his study of theology and philosophy at fourteen. Four years later, at the age of eighteen, Ferrer entered the Order of Preachers, commonly called the Dominican Order, in England also known as Black Friars. As soon as he had entered the novitiate of the Order, though, he experienced temptations urging him to leave. Even his parents pleaded with him to do so and become a secular priest.International website of the Order of Preachers \\"St. Vincent Ferrer\\" He prayed and practiced penance to overcome these trials. Thus he succeeded in completing the year of probation and advancing to his profession. For a period of three years, he read solely Sacred Scripture and eventually committed it to memory. He published a treatise on Dialectic Suppositions after his solemn profession, and in 1379 was ordained a Catholic priest at Barcelona. He eventually became a Master of Sacred Theology and was commissioned by the Order to deliver lectures on philosophy. He was then sent to Barcelona and eventually to the University of Lleida, where he earned his doctorate in theology. Vincent Ferrer is described as a man of medium height, with a lofty forehead and very distinct features. His hair was fair in color and tonsured. His eyes were very dark and expressive; his manner gentle. Pale was his ordinary color. His voice was strong and powerful, at times gentle, resonant, and vibrant. Western Schism St. Vincent Ferrer, Église Saint-André (Brech) The Western Schism (1378–1417) divided Roman Catholicism between two, then eventually three, claimants to the papacy. Antipope Clement VII lived at Avignon in France, and Pope Urban VI in Rome. Vincent was convinced that the election of Urban was invalid, although Catherine of Siena was just as devoted a supporter of the Roman pope. In the service of Cardinal Pedro de Luna, Vincent worked to persuade Spaniards to follow Clement. When Clement died in 1394, Cardinal de Luna was elected as the second antipope successor to the Avignon papacy and took the name Benedict XIII. Vincent was loyal to Benedict XIII, commonly known as \\"Papa Luna\\" in Castile and Aragon. He worked for Benedict XIII as apostolic penitentiary and Master of the Sacred Palace. Nonetheless Vincent labored to have Benedict XIII end the schism. When Benedict XIII did not resign as intended at either the Council of Pisa (1409) or the Council of Constance (1414–1418), he lost the support of the French king and of most of his cardinals, and was excommunicated as a schismatic in 1417. Vincent encouraged King Ferdinand I of Aragon to withdraw his support from Benedict XIII. Vincent later claimed that the Western Schism had had such a depressing effect on his mind that it caused him to be seriously ill. Religious gifts and missionary work For twenty-one years he was said to have traveled to England, Scotland, Ireland, Aragon, Castile, France, Switzerland, and Italy, preaching the Gospel and converting many. Many biographers believe that he could speak only Catalan, but was endowed with the gift of tongues. He preached to St. Colette of Corbie and to her nuns, and it was she who told him that he would die in France. Too ill to return to Spain, he did, indeed, die in Brittany in 1419. Breton fishermen still invoke his aid in storms, and in Spain he is the patron of orphanages.Website O.P. Conversion of Jews and controversy Vincent is said to have been responsible for the conversion of many Jews to Catholicism, often by questionable means according to the Jewish Encyclopedia; for instance, he is said to have made their lives difficult until they converted and to have \\"dedicated\\" synagogues as churches on the basis of his own authority. One of his converts, a former rabbi by the name of Solomon ha-Levi, went on to become the Bishop of Cartagena and later the Archbishop of Burgos. Vincent is alleged to have contributed to anti-Semitism in Spain, as violence accompanied his visits to towns that had Jewish communities. Because of the Spanish's methods of converting Jews at the time, the means which Vincent had at his disposal were either baptism or spoliation. He won them over by his preaching, estimated at 25,000. Sources are contradictory concerning Vincent's achievement in converting a synagogue in Toledo, Spain, into the Church of Santa María la Blanca. One source says he preached to the mobs whose riots led to the appropriation of the synagogue and its transformation into a church in 1391; a second source says he converted the Jews of the city who then changed the synagogue to a church after they embraced the Faith, but hints at the year 1411. A third source identifies two distinct incidents, one in Valencia in 1391 and one in Toledo at a later date, but says that Vincent put down an uprising against Jews in one place and defused a persecution against them in the other. Vincent also attended the Disputation of Tortosa (1413–14), called by Avignon Pope Benedict XIII in an effort to convert Jews to Catholicism after a debate among scholars of both faiths. Compromise of Caspe Vincent participated in the management of a significant political crisis in his homeland. King Martin of Aragon died in 1410 without a legitimate heir, and five potential candidates came forth to claim the throne, all with royal bloodlines. It was determined that a committee of nine respected figures, three each from Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia (the realms comprising the Crown of Aragon), would review the qualifications and select the next king. Vincent was chosen as one of the representatives of Valencia, and he voted for the Castilian prince Ferdinand of Antequera, who became the next King of Aragon. The process by which Ferdinand was determined to be the next king is known as the Compromise of Caspe. Death and legacy Vincent died on 5 April 1419 at Vannes in Brittany, at the age of 69, and was buried in Vannes Cathedral. He was canonized by Pope Calixtus III on 3 June 1455. His feast day is celebrated on 5 April. Entities named after him include a pontifical religious institute, the Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer, and two Brazilian municipalities, São Vicente Ferrer, Maranhão, and São Vicente Ferrer, Pernambuco.

The party received the second-highest number of votes in the 1981 general elections, but failed to win a seat. Prior to the 1986 elections it merged into the new National Alliance for Reconstruction. History The party was founded by Karl Hudson-Phillips, who had resigned from the ruling People's National Movement in 1973 when Prime Minister Eric Williams reversed his decision to resign from politics. Hudson-Phillips had been the main contender to succeed Williams - once Williams returned there was no longer room for a person who had openly expressed an interest in leading the party. Hudson-Phillips went on to form the 'National Land Tenants and Ratepayers Association of Trinidad and Tobago in 1974, a right-of-centre body. After building a support base among the middle and upper classes, he launched the ONR in 1980. Despite receiving 22.2% of the vote, the party failed to win any seats, whilst the United Labour Front (which had received 15.2% of the vote) won ten seats.Nohlen, D (2005) Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I, pp640-642 This setback led to the ONR forging a closer relationship with the other opposition parties, which had organised themselves as the National Alliance prior to the elections. In the 1983 local elections the ONR won 26 of the 120 local government seats, while the National Alliance won 40. This was the first time since 1959 that the PNM had not won the majority of seats contested in any election in Trinidad (the DAC had taken control of the Tobago House of Assembly in 1980). Following on this success, the three parties making up the National Alliance and the ONR merged to form a single party, the National Alliance for Reconstruction. In the 1986 general elections the NAR won 33 of the 36 seats in Parliament and was able to form the new government. Hudson-Phillips did not take a major role in the NAR government (according to Basdeo Panday this was because of animosity between Hudson-Phillips and A. N. R. Robinson, the \\"compromise\\" leader of the NAR). However, several other ONR members held prominent posts in the NAR government. After the NAR folded, many former ONR members joined the United National Congress, while others returned to the PNM.

Although the point has been debated, prolegs are not widely regarded as true legs, derived from the primitive uniramous limbs. Certainly in their morphology they are not jointed, and so lack the five segments (coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus) of thoracic insect legs. Prolegs do have limited musculature, but much of their movement is hydraulically powered.  See also  * Terrestrial locomotion in animals References *Peterson, A. 1948. Larvae Of Insects.

Its formation is common during the winter in rivers and lakes located in northern latitudes, and usually forms in open-water reaches of rivers where and when the heat exchange between the air and the water is such that the water temperature can drop below its freezing point (typically not lower than -0.1 °C in rivers). As a rule of thumb, such conditions may happen on cold and clear nights, when the air temperature is lower than . Frazil ice also forms in oceans, where it is often referred to as grease ice when floating on the surface. Frazil ice is notorious for blocking water intakes as crystals accumulate and build up on the intake trash rack. Such blockages negatively impact water supply facilities, hydropower plants, nuclear power facilities, and vessels navigating in cold waters, and can lead to unexpected shut downs of the facility or even collapse of the trash rack.  Formation  river Blanda in Iceland When the water surface begins to lose heat rapidly, the water becomes supercooled. Turbulence, caused by strong winds or flow from a river, will mix the supercooled water throughout its entire depth. The supercooled water will already be encouraging the formation of small ice crystals (frazil ice) and the crystals get taken to the bottom of the water body. Ice generally floats, but due to frazil ice's small size relative to current speeds, it has an ineffective buoyancy and can be carried to the bottom very easily. Through a process called secondary nucleation, the crystals quickly increase in number, and because of its supercooled surrounding, the crystals will continue to grow. Sometimes, the concentration is estimated to reach one million ice crystals per cubic meter. As the crystals grow in number and size, the frazil ice will begin to adhere to objects in the water, especially if the objects themselves are at a temperature below water's freezing point. The accumulation of frazil ice often causes flooding or damage to objects such as trash racks. Since frazil ice is found below the surface of water, it is difficult to detect its formation. Usually what happens is the frazil ice accumulates on the upstream side of objects and sticks to them. The frazil ice accumulates as more gets deposited. The growth will extend upstream and increase in width until the point where the frazil ice accumulations bridge together and block the water. As more and more water flows against this block, the pressure on the upstream side increases and causes a differential pressure (difference in pressure from the upstream side and the downstream side). This will cause the growth of the bridge to extend downstream. Once this happens, flooding and damage is likely unless otherwise prevented. Frazil ice has also been demonstrated to form beneath temperate (or \\"warm-based\\") glaciers as water flows quickly downhill and supercools due to a rapid loss of pressure. This \\"glaciohydraulic supercooling\\" process forms an open network of platy ice crystals that can effectively trap silt from the sediment-laden water that flows beneath glaciers and ice sheets. Subsequent freezing and recrystallization can result in a layer of sediment-rich ice at the base of the glacier which, upon melting at the terminus, can result in significant accumulation of sediment in moraines. This phenomenon has been verified by elevated concentrations of tritium — produced by nuclear weapons testing and therefore almost entirely absent in ice frozen before 1945 — in the basal ice of several glaciers (signifying young ice) and the observation of rapid growth of ice crystals around water discharge vents at glacier termini. Control There are several ways to control frazil ice build up. They include suppression, mechanical control, thermal control, vibration, materials selection and damage mitigation. =Suppression= Frazil ice forms in supercooled water which occurs because the surface water loses heat to cooler air above. Suppression is the idea of ‘insulating’ the surface water with an intact, stable ice cover. The ice cover will prevent heat loss and warm the supercooled water that might have already formed. Sufficient area needs to be covered in order for this method to work, but it is still unknown what is meant by \\"sufficient\\". The St. Lawrence River is explicitly managed to create \\"flow conditions that help form a stable ice cover\\" to prevent frazil ice and subsequent ice jams. =Mechanical control= These methods include stabilizing freeze without restricting water flow, such as implementing weirs and ice booms, installing water jets to break up any accumulation that might occur, and using manual labour to rake away the accumulation. This final method is often not preferred because of high labour costs, cold, wet and late night working conditions. Back flushing is another technology that uses the idea of cancelling out the differential pressure caused by the frazil ice accumulation. This technology creates a high pressure on the downstream side of objects to reverse the differential pressure. =Thermal control= These methods either heat the structures in the water to prevent frazil ice adhesion or heat the water to prevent frazil ice from forming in the first place. When heating the structure, it must be heated to a temperature above freezing. Electrical resistance heaters have been found to work well, but these have potential safety problems. Installing hollow tubes in the structures through which steam or warm water is pumped also works, but this method has been seen to cause operational problems. Other active methods are also available. Sometimes warm water byproducts are released from nearby water facilities, and the warm water is wasted. Redirecting this water to potential frazil ice accumulation regions could raise the water temperature by , often enough to prevent supercooled water from developing. =Vibration= Although still in the experimental stages, blasting with dynamite is one form of vibrational control that will break loose any frazil ice accumulation. The charge must be precise such that the ice breaks, but surrounding structures and environment are not harmed. Safety of the blasting also is important and nearby residents might complain about sound pollution. For all these reasons, this method is not often used, except as an emergency last resort. =Materials selection= Man-made structures are often the objects to which frazil ice adheres. As such, the choice of materials for these structures should include consideration of ice adhesion. Steel structures, for example will rust, and rust-to-ice adhesion is very strong. Choosing a material with lower adhesion such as plastic, fiberglass, graphite or even an epoxy paint coating on the steel will reduce the adhesion probability. Although adhesion will still occur, using such materials makes other methods, such as raking, easier. =Damage mitigation= Damage could be reduced by protecting designated flood regions with mechanical structures.

Its only known species is Velella velella, a cosmopolitan free-floating hydrozoan that lives on the surface of the open ocean. It is commonly known by the names sea raft, by-the-wind sailor, purple sail, little sail, or simply Velella.Harrington Wells (1937). Seashore Life. Wagner Publishing Company, USA (see pages 138 and 144 in the 1942 edition) This small cnidarian is part of a specialised ocean surface community that includes the better-known cnidarian siphonophore, the Portuguese man o' war. Specialized predatory gastropod molluscs prey on these cnidarians. Such predators include nudibranchs (sea slugs) in the genus GlaucusGosliner, T.M. (1987). Nudibranchs of Southern Africa page 127, and purple snails in the genus Janthina.Branch, G.M., Branch, M.L, Griffiths, C.L. and Beckley, L.E. (2010). Two Oceans: a guide to the marine life of southern Africa. Cape Town:Struik Nature. page 188. . Each apparent individual is a hydroid colony, and most are less than about 7 cm long. They are usually deep blue in colour, but their most obvious feature is a small stiff sail that catches the wind and propels them over the surface of the sea. Under certain wind conditions, they may be stranded by the thousand on beaches. Like other Cnidaria, Velella velella are carnivorous. They catch their prey, generally plankton, by means of tentacles that hang down in the water and bear cnidocysts (also called nematocysts). The toxins in their nematocysts are effective against their prey. While cnidarians all possess nematocysts, in some species the nematocysts and toxins therein are more powerful than other species. V. velella's nematocysts are relatively benign to humans, although each person may respond differently to contact with the nematocyst toxin. It is wise to avoid touching one's face or eyes after handling V. velella, and itching may develop on parts of the skin that have been exposed to V. velella nematocysts. Stranded Velella Velella close-up Distribution and habitat Velella velella lives in warm and temperate waters in all the world's oceans. They live at the water/air interface, with the float above the water, and polyps hanging down about a centimetre below. Organisms that live partly in and partly out of the water like this are known as pleuston. Offshore boaters sometimes encounter thousands of V. velella on the water surface. The small rigid sail projects into the air and catches the wind . However Velella sails always align along the direction of the wind where the sail may act as an aerofoil so that the animals tend to sail downwind at a small angle to the wind. Having no means of locomotion other than its sail, V. velella is at the mercy of prevailing winds for moving around the seas, and are thereby also subject to mass-strandings on beaches throughout the world. For example, most years in the spring, there is a mass stranding that occurs along the West Coast of North America, from British Columbia to California, beginning in the north and moving south over several weeks' time. In some years, so many animals are left at the tide line by receding waves, that the line of dying (and subsequently rotting) animals may be many centimetres deep, along hundreds of kilometres of beaches. Mass strandings have been reported also on the west coast of Ireland. Velella (By- the-wind sailors) stranded on Rodeo Beach, Marin County, California. Life cycle Like many Hydrozoa, Velella velella has a bipartite life cycle, with a form of alternation of generations. The deep blue, by-the-wind sailors that are recognized by many beach-goers are the polyp phase of the life cycle. Each \\"individual\\" with its sail is really a hydroid colony, with many polyps that feed on ocean plankton. These are connected by a canal system that enables the colony to share whatever food is ingested by individual polyps. Each by-the- wind sailor is a colony of all-male or all-female polyps. The colony has several different kinds of polyps, some of which are both feeding and reproductive, called gonozooids, and others protective, called dactylozooids. The gonozooids each produce numerous tiny jellyfish by an asexual budding process, so that each Velella colony produces thousands of tiny jellyfish (medusae), each about 1 mm high and wide, over several weeks. The tiny medusae are each provided with many zooxanthellae, single-celled endosymbiotic organisms typically also found in corals and some sea anemones, that can utilize sunlight to provide energy to the jellyfish. Curiously, although a healthy captive Velella will release many medusae under the microscope, and are expected to do the same in the sea, the medusae of Velella are rarely captured in the plankton and very little is known about their natural history. The medusae develop to sexual maturity within about three weeks in the laboratory and their free-spawned eggs and sperm develop into a planktonic larva called a conaria, which develops into a new floating Velella hydroid colony. Systematics Velella velella & Palmaria palmata in a tidepool, Cambria, California The Porpitidae is a family of the Hydrozoa erected for two genera of hydroids that live floating free at the surface of the open ocean: Velella and Porpita. The systematic position of these peculiar genera has long been a topic of discussion among taxonomists who work with pelagic Cnidaria. The three genera were put in with athecate hydroids in the mid-to-late 19th century by some, whereas other authors at the time included them in the Siphonophora. A new order was established for these genera by Totton, in 1954, called the Chondrophora, while at the same time, other authors favored again placing them in the Anthomedusae/Athecatae. Most authors in the past 40 years have accepted interpretation of these animals as unusual floating colonial athecate hydroids, which produce medusae clearly belonging in the Anthomedusae. Although the exact position of the family Porpitidae within the Athecatae/Anthomedusae is not yet clear, the order Chondrophora is no longer used by hydrozoan systematists.

The Italians in summer 1941 improved the region by building hospitals and infrastructure, but started a process of Italianization (related to the history of Venetian Albania & the Republic of VeniceTreccani: Cattaro (in Italian)). Because of this, after one year of peaceful administration & control, in summer 1942 there was a small insurrection against the Italian conquest, but without huge consequences until summer 1943. In September 1943, the German army took control of the region from the Italians, who had surrendered to the Allies, and soon started a terrible guerrilla war between the Nazi occupiers and Joseph Broz Tito's partisans.

His books included Ancient Woodland (1980) and The History of the Countryside (1986). Life and academic career Rackham was born in Bungay and attended King Edward VI School, and then Norwich City College. In 1958 he won a scholarship to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, graduating in Natural Sciences in 1961 and subsequently gaining a PhD. Professor Oliver Rackham, historical ecologist – obituary, The Telegraph, 19 February 2015 He began his academic career studying physics, but moved between several Cambridge departments. He conducted research in the Department of Botany from 1964 to 1968 and 1972 to 1990, and the Plant Breeding Institute of Cambridge from 1968 to 1972. He transferred to the Department of Geography from 1988 to 2000, latterly as Professor, and was appointed Honorary Professor of Historical ecology in the Department of Plant Sciences in 2006 and Honorary Director of the Cambridge Centre for Landscape and People in 2010. Rackham also worked as a tutor in the Kingcombe Centre in Dorset, teaching about the history of woodlands. He was associated with Corpus Christi College from his student days. He briefly served as Master of the College from 2007 to 2008, and was made a Life Fellow in 2010. Contributions Rackham was a prolific historical ecologist whose prime interest was the function, history, and management of British woodlands. He kept a series of notebooks, which he began during his youth and continued until his death, in which he recorded observations on plants seen in his home surroundings and on his travels, in addition to information about the weather and his college duties. Arising from his research on Hayley Wood in Cambridgeshire, he developed the concept of ancient woodland, rich in plant diversity and managed through traditional practices. His 1980 book Ancient Woodland, its History, Vegetation and Uses in England led to the recognition of such areas by the Forestry Commission and in planning legislation. It also helped to alter forestry industry views about woodland conservation. The Woodland Trust became a larger woodland owner to ensure conservation.\\"Oliver Rackham and the woodland owner \\" He argued for the preservation of traditional management techniques like coppicing, to let light in to increase in the diversity of the herb layer. In 1986 he published The History of the Countryside, regarded as his greatest achievement and described as \\"a magisterial 400-page account of the British landscape from prehistory to the present day, with chapters on aspects ranging from woodland and hedgerows to marshes and the sea.\\" The book won several awards for literature. His other books include Woodlands (2006), in the Collins New Naturalist series, and he also wrote on Hatfield Forest. As well as working in England, he studied and published extensively on the ecology and landscape of Crete, co-writing The Making of the Cretan Landscape with Jenny Moody in 1998, and latterly leading a (failed) protest against the granting of planning permission for the Cavo Sidero golf and hotel project on the island's eastern tip.Save the Cretan Landscape Personal life Rackham was an only child, and was unmarried.

It involves use of a radiopharmaceutical, injected into a patient, and a gamma camera for acquisition. A MUGA scan (multigated acquisition) involves an acquisition triggered (gated) at different points of the cardiac cycle. MUGA scanning is also called equilibrium radionuclide angiocardiography, radionuclide ventriculography (RNVG), or gated blood pool imaging, as well as SYMA scanning (synchronized multigated acquisition scanning). This mode of imaging uniquely provides a cine type of image of the beating heart, and allows the interpreter to determine the efficiency of the individual heart valves and chambers. MUGA/Cine scanning represents a robust adjunct to the now more common echocardiogram. Mathematics regarding acquisition of cardiac output (Q) is well served by both of these methods as well as other inexpensive models supporting ejection fraction as a product of the heart/myocardium in systole. The advantage of a MUGA scan over an echocardiogram or an angiogram is its accuracy. An echocardiogram measures the shortening fraction of the ventricle and is limited by the user's ability. Furthermore, an angiogram is invasive and, often, more expensive. A MUGA scan provides a more accurate representation of cardiac ejection fraction.  History  The MUGA scan was first introduced in the early 1970s and quickly became accepted as the preferred technique for measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) with a high degree of accuracy. Several early studies demonstrated an excellent correlation of MUGA-derived LVEF with values obtained by cardiac catheterization contrast ventriculography.  Purpose  MUGA is typically ordered for the following patients: * With known or suspected coronary artery disease, to diagnose the disease and predict outcomes * With lesions in their heart valves * With congestive heart failure * Who have undergone percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, or medical therapy, to assess the efficacy of the treatment * With low cardiac output after open-heart surgery * Who are undergoing cardiotoxic drug agents such as in chemotherapy e.g., with doxorubicin or immunotherapy (herceptin) * Who have had a cardiac transplant  Procedure  The MUGA scan is performed by labeling the patient's red blood pool with a radioactive tracer, technetium-99m-pertechnetate (Tc-99m), and measuring radioactivity over the anterior chest as the radioactive blood flows through the large vessels and the heart chambers. The introduction of the radioactive marker can either take place in vivo or in vitro. In the in vivo method, stannous (tin) ions are injected into the patient's bloodstream. A subsequent intravenous injection of the radioactive substance, technetium-99m-pertechnetate, labels the red blood cells in vivo. With an administered activity of about 800 MBq, the effective radiation dose is about 6 mSv. In the in vitro method, some of the patient's blood is drawn and the stannous ions (in the form of stannous chloride) are injected into the drawn blood. The technetium is subsequently added to the mixture as in the in vivo method. In both cases, the stannous chloride reduces the technetium ion and prevents it from leaking out of the red blood cells during the procedure. The in vivo technique is more convenient for the majority of patients since it is less time-consuming and less costly and more than 80 percent of the injected radionuclide usually binds to red blood cells with this approach. Red blood cell binding of the radioactive tracer is generally more efficient than in vitro labeling, and it is preferred in patients with indwelling intravenous catheters to decrease the adherence of Tc-99m to the catheter wall and increase the efficiency of blood pool labeling. The patient is placed under a gamma camera, which detects the low-level 140 keV gamma radiation being given off by technetium-99m. As the gamma camera images are acquired, the patient's heart beat is used to 'gate' the acquisition. The final result is a series of images of the heart (usually sixteen), one at each stage of the cardiac cycle. Depending on the objectives of the test, the doctor may decide to perform either a resting or a stress MUGA. During the resting MUGA, the patient lies stationary, whereas during a stress MUGA, the patient is asked to exercise during the scan. The stress MUGA measures the heart performance during exercise and is usually performed to assess the impact of a suspected coronary artery disease. In some cases, a nitroglycerin MUGA may be performed, where nitroglycerin (a vasodilator) is administered prior to the scan. The resulting images show that the volumetrically derived blood pools in the chambers of the heart and timed images may be computationally interpreted to calculate the ejection fraction and injection fraction of the heart. The Massardo method can be used to calculate ventricle volumes. This nuclear medicine scan yields an accurate, inexpensive and easily reproducible means of measuring and monitoring the ejection and injection fractions of the ventricles, which are one of many of the important clinical metrics in assessing global heart performance.  Results  =Normal results= In normal subjects, the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) should be about 50%(range, 50-80%). There should be no area of abnormal wall motion (hypokinesis, akinesis or dyskinesis). Abnormalities in cardiac function may be manifested as a decrease in LVEF and/or the presence of abnormalities in global and regional wall motion. For normal subjects, peak filling rates should be between 2.4 and 3.6 end diastolic volume (EDV) per second, and the time to peak filling rate should be 135-212 ms. (source?) =Abnormal results= An uneven distribution of technetium in the heart indicates that the patient has coronary artery disease, a cardiomyopathy, or blood shunting within the heart. Abnormalities in a resting MUGA usually indicate a heart attack, while those that occur during exercise usually indicate ischemia. In a stress MUGA, patients with coronary artery disease may exhibit a decrease in ejection fraction. For a patient that has had a heart attack, or is suspected of having another disease that affects the heart muscle, this scan can help pinpoint the position in the heart that has sustained damage as well as assess the degree of damage. MUGA scans are also used to evaluate heart function prior to and while receiving certain chemotherapies (e.g. doxorubicin (Adriamycin)) or immunotherapy (specifically, herceptin) that have a known effect on heart function.  Massardo method  The Massardo method is one of a number of approaches for estimating the volume of the ventricles and thus ultimately the ejection fraction. Recall that a MUGA scan is a nuclear imaging method involving the injection of a radioactive isotope (Tc-99m) that acquires gated 2D images of the heart using a SPECT scanner. The pixel values in such an image represent the number of counts (nuclear decays) detected from within that region in a given time interval. The Massardo method enables a 3D volume to be estimated from such a 2D image of decay counts via: V = 1.38 M^3 r^{frac{3}{2}} , where M is the pixel dimension and r is the ratio of total counts within the ventricle to the number of counts within the brightest (hottest) pixel. The Massardo method relies on two assumptions: (i) the ventricle is spherical and (ii) the radioactivity is homogeneously distributed. The ejection fraction, E_f , can then be calculated: E_f(%) = frac{ text{EDV - ESV} }{ text{EDV} } times 100 , where the EDV (end-diastolic volume) is the volume of blood within the ventricle immediately before a contraction and the ESV (end-systolic volume) is the volume of blood remaining in the ventricle at the end of a contraction. The ejection fraction is hence the fraction of the end- diastolic volume that is ejected with each beat. The Siemens Intevo SPECT scanners employ the Massardo method in their MUGA scans. Other methods for estimating ventricular volume exist, but the Massardo method is sufficiently accurate and simple to perform, avoiding the need for blood samples, attenuation corrections or decay corrections. = Derivation = Define the ratio r as the ratio of counts within the chamber of the heart to the counts in the hottest pixel: r = frac{ text{Total counts within the chamber} }{ text{Total counts in the hottest pixel} } = frac{ N_t }{N_m} . Assuming that the activity is homogeneously distributed, the total count is proportional to the volume. The maximum pixel count is thus proportional to the length of the longest axis perpendicular to the collimator, D_m, times the cross-sectional area of a pixel, M^2. We can thus write: N_m = K M^2 D_m , where K is some constant of proportionality with units counts/cm^3. The total counts, N_t, can be written N_t = K V_t where V_t is the volume of the ventricle and K is the same constant of proportionality since we are assuming a homogeneous distribution of activity. The Massardo method now makes the simplification that the ventricle is spherical in shape, giving N_t = K left( frac{pi}{6} right) D^3 , where D is the diameter of the sphere and is thus equivalent to D_m above. This allows us to express the ratio r as r = frac{N_t}{N_m} = frac{pi D^2}{6 M^2} , finally giving the diameter of the ventricle in terms of r, i.e. counts, alone: D^2 = left( frac{6}{pi} right) M^2 r . From this, the volume of the ventricle in terms of counts alone is simply V_t = sqrt{ frac{6}{pi} } M^3 r^{frac{3}{2}} approx 1.38 M^3 r^{frac{3}{2}} .

The film depicts a landing by the United States Marine Corps on an unnamed Japanese-held Pacific island. The film is based on Peter Bowman's 1945 novella of the same name, which was based on his experiences with the United States Army Corps of Engineers in the Pacific War. Title meaning During Allied amphibious operations of World War II, designated invasion beaches were code named by color, such as \\"Beach Red\\", \\"Beach White\\", \\"Beach Blue\\", etc.Newell, Reg Pacific Star: 3NZ Division in the South Pacific in World War II Exisle Publishing, 1 Oct 2015 There was a \\"Beach Red\\" on virtually every assaulted island in accordance with the standard beach designation hierarchy. Plot The 30-minute opening sequence of the film depicts an opposed beach landing. Its graphic depiction of the violence and savagery of war was echoed years later in Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.Basinger, Jeanine. \\"Translating War: The Combat Film Genre and Saving Private Ryan,\\" Perspectives on History: the Newsmagazine of the American Historical Association (October 1998). In one scene during the landing, a Marine is shown with his arm blown off, similar to Thomas C. Lea III's 1944 painting The Price. As Americans are shown consolidating their gains, flashbacks illustrate the lives of American and Japanese combatants. Shifting first-person voice-over in a stream-of-consciousness style is also used to portray numerous characters' thoughts. Like Wilde's previous production of The Naked Prey (1965), the film does not use subtitles for characters speaking Japanese. The film contains large sections of voice-over narration, often juxtaposed with still photographs of wives, etc. (who are inexplicably dressed in 1967 attire rather than that appropriate for the 1940s). Many soldiers in the film shed tears, and the narrative displays an unusual amount of sympathy for the enemy. In one scene, an injured Cliff is lying close to an injured Japanese soldier in a scene paralleling the one from All Quiet on the Western Front with Paul Bäumer and Gérard Duval. Just after the two soldiers bond, other Marines appear and kill the Japanese soldier, distressing Cliff. Director, producer, and co-writer Wilde plays a Marine captain, the company commander. Rip Torn plays his company gunnery sergeant, who utters the film's tagline, \\"That's what we're here for. To kill. The rest is all crap!\\" Cast * Cornel Wilde - Captain MacDonald * Rip Torn - Sergeant Honeywell * Burr DeBenning - Egan * Patrick Wolfe - Cliff * Jean Wallace - Julie * Jaime Sánchez - Colombo * Dale Ishimoto - Captain Tanaka Production Beach Red was filmed on location in the Philippines using troops of the Philippine Armed Forces. The sequence of the Japanese dressed in Marine uniforms was inspired by Bowman's book, which mentions Japanese wearing American helmets to infiltrate American lines.Bowman, Peter. Beach Red: A Novel (Random House, 1945). There were no incidents in the Pacific where large numbers of Japanese donned American uniforms and attempted to infiltrate a beachhead. The action, though, is similar in some ways to a large-scale Japanese counterattack and banzai charge conducted on July 7, 1944, on Saipan, which was defeated by U.S. Army troops with heavy losses. When seeking assistance from the U.S. Marine Corps, Cornel Wilde was told that due to the commitments of the Vietnam War, all the Corps could provide the film was color stock footage taken during the Pacific War. The film provided had deteriorated, so Wilde had to spend a considerable part of the film's budget to restore the film to an acceptable quality in order to blend into the film. The Marine Corps was grateful that their historical film had been restored at no cost to them.p.203 Suid, Lawrence H. Guts & Glory: The Making of the American Military Image in Film University Press of Kentucky, 2002. The film's title sequence incorporates various paintings that suddenly segue into the preparations for the landing. Soundtrack The film's single musical theme is by Col. Antonino Buenaventura, a National Artist of the Philippines in Music. It appears in the title sequence, sung in a folk song manner by Jean Wallace – Wilde's wife – and appears in various other orchestrations throughout the film. Wallace also appears in flashback photos as soldier's wife Julie MacDonald. Reception Howard Thompson of The New York Times praised the film as \\"an admirable war movie that says a bit and suggests even more, thanks to Cornel Wilde\\". Variety wrote that \\"[i]n contrast to many professedly anti-war films, Beach Red [sic] is indisputably sincere in its war is hell message\\". In a capsule review published many years after the film debuted, Time Out London wrote, \\"Wilde's neglected WWII movie is an allegory about the futility and the carnage of Vietnam. ... The movie is massively and harrowingly brutal, almost like a horror movie, with severed limbs washing up on the beach. Although Wilde deals exclusively in pacifist clichés, the film has a genuine primitive power; in fact, it's the equal of anything made by Fuller.\\" Awards Beach Red received a 1968 Academy Award nomination for Best Film Editing.

History The northernmost section of the route was opened in stages by the fledgling York and North Midland Railway (Y&NM;), a company which belonged to the railway empire of George Hudson. York to Sherburn Junction was completed in 1839 to form a link with the Leeds and Selby Railway, which was later taken over by the Y&NM.; This section includes Ulleskelf, Church Fenton and Sherburn-in-Elmet stations, as well as the former station sites at Copmanthorpe (closed 1959) and Bolton Percy (closed 1965). Y&NM; extended the line to Altofts Junction in 1840 to meet the new North Midland Railway as part of a new route from York to London St Pancras via Normanton, Swinton, Chesterfield and Derby. Stations on this section were Milford (closed 1904), Monk Fryston (closed 1959) and Burton Salmon (also closed in 1959), where the present route diverges. The next section, from Burton Salmon to Ferrybridge, was completed in 1850 to form a link between York and Knottingley; Ferrybridge station closed in 1965. From Ferrybridge, the route takes up the course of the Swinton and Knottingley Joint Railway, constructed in 1879. The first station encountered is Pontefract Baghill, which remains open today, before the line reaches a closed station at Ackworth (last served in 1951) then the station at Moorthorpe. The small hamlet of Frickley saw its station close in 1953, but two new stations at Thurnscoe and Goldthorpe were constructed in the 1980s. These are primarily served by Wakefield Line trains; the two Dearne Valley line trains a day pass through without stopping. Finally, the S&KJR;'s Bolton- on-Dearne station has remained open throughout. Beyond Bolton-on-Dearne the line joins the North Midland's route to the south, opened in 1840 and serving Swinton, a new station here replacing that closed in 1967 and Kilnhurst West (also closed in 1967). At Aldwarke Junction the route diverges from the North Midland via a junction constructed by British Rail and opened in 1965. Here it joins the former Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway line, part of a link between two branch lines opened many years earlier by the South Yorkshire Railway. This section once had stations at Parkgate and Aldwarke (closed 1951) and at Rotherham Road (closed 1953), before reaching the former Rotherham Central re-opened, slightly nearer the College Road bridge, in 1987 by British Rail. Leaving Rotherham Central we take the \\"Holmes Chord\\", a single line to Holmes Junction where we take to the rails of the Sheffield & Rotherham company, which opened its line in 1838 and which once served Holmes (closed in 1955), Meadowhall (a new station opened in 1991), Wincobank (closed 1956), Brightside (closed 1994) and Attercliffe Road (closed 1994), before arriving at Sheffield. The section between Holmes Junction, adjacent to the station and Grimesthorpe Junction is the oldest section of the route. Current services Services which operate over the entire length of the route are provided by Northern Trains. Freight trains also regularly use the route. Northern services, which currently make just three round trips daily, from Sheffield to York calling at Meadowhall Interchange, Rotherham Central, Swinton, Moorthorpe, Pontefract Baghill, Sherburn-in-Elmet, Church Fenton and Ulleskelf. This service was more frequent in the 1970s and 1980s (e.g. the 1988 timetable had seven trains per day in each direction Mon-Sat, including a summer only through service to and from , and four each way on Sundays), but since a major round of cutbacks in 1991 (due to a shortage of rolling stock) the service frequency has gradually declined. The northern part of the route as far as Colton Junction is used by all Edinburgh to London King's Cross expresses, as well as the numerous CrossCountry, TransPennine Express and Northern York to Leeds workings which continue as far as Church Fenton. Sherburn-in-Elmet is served by some York–Selby/Hull trains which diverge from the route at Sherburn South Junction, but beyond this point the only passenger trains are the infrequent Sheffield–York local services, until Moorthorpe is reached. Overall, the effect of this is that there are only three departures in each direction from Pontefract Baghill per day, although there are two other stations in Pontefract ( and Tanshelf). The line is however a busy freight artery (particularly with bulk loads of imported coal for the power stations at Ferrybridge, Eggbrough and Drax and also further afield in the East Midlands) and also a useful diversionary route, which ensures its continuing survival. In 2017, the section through Rotherham Central was adapted for use by Sheffield Supertram, the light rail network that operates within Sheffield. Supertram is operating a pilot tram-train service over the route, testing the feasibility of such an operation. This is initially intended to run for two years, with an extension of the operation should it prove successful. It involved the construction of a new chord between the National Rail line and Supertram's own network, with a tram platform built at and a short siding to serve the Rotherham Parkgate tram stop terminus with the extension electrified. It opened on 25 October 2018. References  Literature  *Rail Atlas: Great Britain & Ireland, by S. K. Baker *The Railways of Great Britain: A Historical Atlas, by Colonel Michael H.

It grew with 19th-century coal mining, but is now known for its extensive mature forestry and greenery, that attract thousands of visitors and mountain biking enthusiasts each year.  Pre- industrial history  Significant settlement at Cwmcarn came with Bronze Age migration of local tribes from the Gwent levels to the uplands of Mynydd y Grug, Mynydd Machen and Mynydd Maen (Twmbarlwm) and led to a later Iron Age (900-55 BC) hillfort to be constructed by the Silures on Twmbarlwm. Roman forces took control of most of what became the Roman province of Britannia Superior in 43 AD but then took a further 25 years to gain control of the present day South Wales valleys. Roman control remained established until full scale withdrawal in the 5th century AD when the Kingdoms of Gwent and Glywysing were established. Gwent was defined as the land between the River Usk and the River Wye and Glywysing, the land between the River Usk and the River Tawe. Cwmcarn, located where the Carn and Ebbw river valleys meet, being situated within the Welsh Kingdom of Glywysing. The Welsh placename of Cwmcarn came about in 942 when Llywarch ap Cadogan gave Villa Treficarn Pont ('estate near the bridge over the Carn') to a Bishop of Llandaff named Wulfrith with King Cadell's guarantee, i.e. the place where the Carn meets the Ebbw (now Cwmcarn). Following the Norman invasion of Wales the separate townships of Abercarn, Cwmcarn and Newbridge were given a manorial title of Abercarne. The three townships were also within the boundaries of the ancient parish of Mynyddislwyn and remained therein up until comparatively recent times.  Economic activity  = Coal mining = Cwmcarn lies at the south-eastern edge of the South Wales coalfield. The colliery development in the Cwmcarn area started in 1836, when a single shallow, 180 ft downshaft, the Abercarn No.6., was sunk into the Rock (or Tillery) seam, for the nearby Prince of Wales Colliery at Abercarn operated by the Monmouthshire Iron and Coal Company. The second shaft was excavated by the Ebbw Vale Steel Iron & Coal Company to target the deeper No.4 Steam and Black Vein seams. The colliery was run as an individual unit until it was later acquired by Partridge Jones and John Paton and Company in 1935. It was closed by the National Coal Board in November 1968 and the site was cleared after becoming uneconomical to run. The Cwmcarn Forest Drive now runs over the shafts of the colliery and a relics of colliery buildings can still be seen on the slope above the old shaft. The present day lake that is stocked by the Cwmcarn Angling Association was originally down stream of the colliery's washery. = Manufacturing = A telecoms factory located between the Ebbw River and the A467 road was part of the British Post Office and British Telecom before being sold to STC plc, Northern Telecom (Nortel), and more recently Solectron. The factory closed during Spring 2007.  Cwmcarn Forest Drive  To the east of the village of Cwmcarn is the popular Cwmcarn Forest Drive, a popular 7 mile drive through hills and forests on the flanks of the mountain of Twmbarlwm which is operated by the Forestry Commission. The area is popular as a tourist site and a location for mountain biking, and has seen significant recent development as the world-class Y Mynydd Mojo DH Track mountain biking trail is attracting an increased volume of visitors. A new £2 million visitor centre has been opened. In the summer of 2018 the area suffered a spate of extensive fires which were deliberately set and \\"killed many of the newly-planted saplings on the hillsides.\\" The area was also a victim of the spread of phytophthora ramorum, which had required the felling of \\"vast swathes\\" of larch trees in the area to prevent the disease spreading further. Natural Resources Wales project manager for Cwmcarn, Geminie Drinkwater, stated in September 2019 that alongside local activist Robert Southall and Friends of Cwmcarn Forest Drive, they are now \\"planting countless native trees, to repopulate Cwmcarn's ancient woodland\\" and are \\"looking to improve the forestry and restore it as a tourist hotspot\\" in conjunction with the local activist group.

It is frequently referred to as a biodiversity hotspot.Myers, Norman; Mittermeier, Russell A. ; Mittermeier, Cristina G.; da Fonseca, Gustavo A. B.; Kent, Jennifer. Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities. Nature 403, 853-858 (24 February 2000)  doi:10.1038/35002501; Received 22 September 1999 The country is a large South Pacific archipelago with a total land area of more than . The terrain includes a variety of reefs, atolls, small islands, and a variety of topographical and edaphic regions on the largest island, all of which promote the development of unusually concentrated biodiversity. The region's climate is oceanic and tropical. New Caledonia is separated from the nearest mainland by more than of open sea. Its isolation dates from at least the mid-Miocene, and possibly from the Oligocene, and that isolation has preserved its relict biota, fostering the evolution of wide ranges of endemic species. Location and description New Caledonia lies on the southernmost edge of the tropical zone, near the Tropic of Capricorn. It is part of the Melanesia subregion. It includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, the Chesterfield Islands in the Coral Sea, and a few remote islets.Présentation - L'Outre-Mer The archipelago is about east of Australia and 1500 km, 1800 km and 1200 km from New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji respectively. A few lesser islands are closer, but now provide no convenient island-hopping path by which animal species could pass either to or from major mainlands. Some plants, invertebrates, sea mammals, and many flying species as aquatic birds, parrots, and bats have spread to new locations, either under their own power or due to freak events such as storms, or have been transported by humans. Some plant species have colonized new areas by means of seed carried by ocean currents. Some animal and plant species have reached New Caledonia from surrounding regions and in turn, some New Caledonian species have successfully extended their ranges into the Pacific Ocean area. Other New Caledonian species or their close relatives are found in regions remote from the archipelago. For example, the New Caledonian parakeet is known to be the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which has spread to many Pacific islands. Many bats and birds that rely heavily on fruit for their diet, including members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Toucan, swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal (ornithochory) has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. The main island, Grande Terre hosts multiple habitats under the influence of varied precipitation, geology, edaphic factors and altitude. New Caledonia has several biotopes, including dense evergreen forests, maquis shrubland, sclerophyllous forest (dry forest), wetlands, savannas, and halophytic vegetation. The island has two main ecoregions: the greater area is occupied by the eastern New Caledonia rainforest while the now-fragmentary New Caledonia dry forest runs along the west coast. The most conspicuous aspects of the New Caledonian marine environment are associated with the surrounding coral reef. Such circumstances may be expected in general to promote biodiversity, but in the case of New Caledonia, a striking feature is the intense biodiversity in such a small land area. Presumably this is partly due to the edaphic and topographic features that define a number of discrete regions and ecological gradients. However, the local species do not always occupy all the potential niches, leaving the territory vulnerable to certain forms of invasion.Le Breton, Julien, Jourdan, Herve; Chazeau, Jean; Orivel, Jerome; Dejean, Alain. Niche opportunity and ant invasion: the case of Wasmannia auropunctata in a New Caledonian rain forest.

Klötzli, G.-R. Walther, eds. Birkhauser, Basel. =Geologic origins= Mining vista New Caledonia comprises fragments of the continental crust of Gondwana, dating to over one hundred million years ago (MYA), as well as volcanic material. The fragments apparently split from the Indo-Australian tectonic plate. Prevailing opinion holds that the archipelago represents the non-submerged regions of the continental fragment known as Zealandia.Heads, Michael. \\"Biogeographical affinities of the New Caledonian biota: a puzzle with 24 pieces\\". Journal of Biogeography (J. Biogeogr.) (2010) 37, 1179–1201 Zealandia broke away from the Australian part of Gondwana some 80-90 MYA. The separation of New Caledonia from mainland contact must have begun some tens of millions of years ago, probably during the Cretaceous period.McLoughlin, Stephen. \\"The breakup history of Gondwana and its impact on pre-Cenozoic floristic provincialism.\\" Aust. J. Bot. (2001) 49, 271–300 However, the view of the island as a surviving fragment of the Cretaceous period is obsolete. Islands from that time are partly or fully submerged. Most modern New Caledonian terranes formed via accretion of oceanic island arcs and seamounts. The biota evolved as metapopulations on islands that changed constantly until they merged into the archipelago. This hypothesis that the islands and their biota emerged some 30 MYA during the Oligocene better explains the organisms that occur in New Caledonian biota. In the Carboniferous and Permian, New Zealand and New Caledonia were on the periphery of Gondwana, which included Africa, South America, Antarctica, India, New Zealand and Australia. Paleomagnetic data locate New Caledonia as originally near the South Pole. In the Triassic and early Jurassic, Gondwana moved northward, warming the eastern margin. New Caledonia separated from Australia and New Zealand during the breakup of the super-continent, separating from Australia at the end of the Cretaceous (66 MYA) and probably completing its separation from New Zealand in the mid-Miocene. However, as with any plate tectonic process, the process was protracted and in this region it was exceptionally complex. Many questions remain to be resolved.Grandcolas, Philippe; Murienne, Jerome; Robillard, Tony; Desutter-Grandcolas, Laure; Jourdan, Herve; Guilbert, Eric; Deharveng, Louis. New Caledonia: a very old Darwinian island? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2008) 363, 3309–3317 doi:10.1098/rstb.2008.0122 Published online 2 September 2008 The island soils derived largely from ultramafic rocks and have been a refuge for many native flora species that have adapted to their composition a long time ago; such flora can survive on acid soils with unfavourable compositions of nutrient elements. On New Caledonia examples of such soils commonly have an excess of magnesium, plus unusually high concentrations of phytotoxic compounds of heavy metals such as nickel. Not many invader species can compete successfully with plants adapted to such challenging soils. The native flora evolved many extremophile species that thrive in environments sufficiently toxic to put invasive plants at a disadvantage. Many areas, mainly on Grand Terre have some very high concentrations of metalliferous rocks. Their mineral content is poorly suited to most foreign species of plants.Dossier > La flore de Nouvelle-Calédonie - Première partie Ultramafic rocks also contain elevated amounts of chromium and nickel which may be toxic to plants. As a result, a distinctive type of vegetation develops on these soils. Examples are the ultramafic woodlands and barrens of the Appalachian mountains and piedmont, the \\"wet maquis\\" of the New Caledonia rain forests, and the ultramafic forests of Mount Kinabalu and other peaks in Sabah, Malaysia. Vegetation is typically stunted and is sometimes home to endemic species adapted to the soils. Often thick, magnesite-calcrete caprock, laterite and duricrust forms over ultramafic rocks in tropical and subtropical environments. Particular floral assemblages associated with highly nickeliferous ultramafic rocks are indicative tools for mineral exploration. Weathered ultramafic rocks may form lateritic nickel ore deposits.Golightly, J.P. (1981): Nickeliferous Laterite Deposits. Economic Geology 75, 710-735Schellmann, W. (1983): Geochemical principles of lateritic nickel ore formation. Proceedings of the 2. International Seminar on Lateritisation Processes, Sao Paulo, 119-135 =Early organisms= The marine fauna of the period, separate from that of the southwest Pacific, was distinguished as the \\"Maori province\\". Gondwana began its fragmentation in the middle and upper Jurassic, and the arrival of benthic invertebrate fauna is visible in fossil deposits. The Cretaceous marked the appearance of marine invertebrate fauna of southern origin. It was then that angiosperm flora such as Nothofagus and Proteaceae colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia, from South America, along the Antarctic margin of Gondwana. At the beginning of the Tertiary, New Zealand and New Caledonia moved north to a warmer climate. This led to a long period of evolution in near complete isolation. New Caledonia's natural heritage includes species whose ancestors were present on New Caledonia when it broke away from Gondwana; not only species but entire genera and even families are unique to the island. Evolution and history Many current species in the vicinity of the Pacific Island region similar to New Zealand's geckos, such as the Duvaucel's gecko, may have had their origins in New Caledonia. The species of the archipelago of New Caledonia are relicts of a type of vegetation which earlier covered much of the tropics of the Earth, including much of the mainland of Australia, South America, Antarctica, South Africa, and North America. Although tropical cloud forests disappeared during the glaciations, they re-colonized large areas during successive geological eras when the weather was favorable again. At other times they were replaced by more cold-tolerant or drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities. Many of the then existing species became extinct because they could not cross the barriers posed by new oceans, mountains and deserts, but others found refuge as species relict in coastal areas and islands. When the large landmasses became drier and with a harsher climate, this type of forest was reduced to those boundary areas. Although some remnants of archaic rich flora still persisted in coastal mountains and sheltered sites, their biodiversity was reduced. The location of the New Caledonian Islands in the Pacific Ocean moderated these climatic fluctuations, and maintained the relatively humid and mild climate which has allowed these communities to persist to the present day. The ecological requirements of many of the species are those of the laurel forest, and like most of their counterparts laurifolia in the world, they are vigorous species with a great ability to populate the habitat that is conducive. The geographical isolation and special edaphic conditions helped to preserve it too. Some species are even specialized in nickel hyperaccumulation such as the Sapotaceae Sebertia acuminata. Some geologists assert that, as the island moved north due to the effects of continental drift, it submerged at various intervals, extinguishing its terrestrial flora and fauna. Botanists counter that some areas must have remained above sea-level, serving as refugia. Many members of the late Cretaceous – early Tertiary Gondwanan flora survived in New Caledonia's equable climate but were eliminated in Australia due to increasingly dry conditions. The isolation of New Caledonia was not absolute, given the rise and fall of sea level caused by the ebb and flow of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between New Caledonia and its neighbours, the Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, and Australia. Thus new species came to New Caledonia while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. =Extinct species= Numerous species were wiped out by humans before the arrival of Europeans. Fossils found in cave deposits show the island once had an endemic species of barn owl Tyto letocarti; two extinct hawks, Accipiter efficax, Accipiter quartus; a large, flightless galliform bird, Sylviornis neocaledoniae;Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds, University of Chicago Press. Steadman D, (2006). Extinction and Biogeography in Tropical Pacific Birds, University of Chicago Press. a snipe, (Coenocorypha sp.); a gallinule, Porphyrio kukwiedei; the lowland kagu, Rhynochetos orarius; a ground dove, Gallicolumba longitarsus; the pile-builder megapode; a hornbill of Lifou (Loyalty Islands); a possibly extinct lorikeet, Charmosyna diadema; as well as a giant bat, arthropods and others. The island also hosted the giant terrestrial turtle Meiolania, unlike any alive today which was armed with a clubbed tail and a spiked head. There was also a species of terrestrial crocodile, the mekosuchine Mekosuchus inexpectatus which became extinct after the arrival of humans. Both Meiolania and Mekosuchus may have arrived after crossing the ocean, via island hopping and/or wave dispersal from Australia. Ecoregions There are several vegetation types, in a variety of niches, landforms and micro-climates where endemic species thrive, By Leanne Logan, Geert Cole among including dense evergreen forests, maquis (shrubland), sclerophyllous forests (dry forests), wetlands, savannas, and halophytic vegetation. New Caledonia has two terrestrial ecoregions. The greater area is occupied by the eastern New Caledonia rain forests, which covers the eastern part of Grande Terre, Loyalty Islands, and Isle of Pines. In the habitat of tropical montane laurel forest of New Caledonia with Laurisilvas, which are cloud-covered for much of the year, the moist evergreen forests have a closed canopy of moderately sized trees, up to in the lowlands and in montane forest. In humid montane Melaleuca forests of lowland, communities of Mt. Ignambi and of the Yaté Lake with area of low shrubland, is the ideal habitat for the native species. For example, Erythrinas are food plants for some native parakeet species. The now- fragmentary New Caledonia dry forests runs along the west coast of Grand Terre. Europeans generally settled here, avoiding the eastern part of the Kanakas. New Caledonia's marine environment is characterized by the surrounding New Caledonia Barrier Reef. =Dry forests= Typical terrain in the south of the islands at Grand Terre The west coast of New Caledonia has a drier climate and different habitat from the rain forests that cover most of the island. The plant life of the west coast consists of nearly 400 species, including endemic species such as the unique Captaincookia margaretae, and Oryza neocaledonica, an endangered wild rice. This coast is home to endangered animals including the New Caledonia wattled bat (Chalinolobus neocaledonicus) and the ornate flying fox. Dry forests are vulnerable to fire and human intervention. The original vegetation was cleared for farming, especially cattle ranching, leaving only two percent of the original dry forest, in isolated patches, none of them protected. Urban areas on the west coast include New Caledonia's cosmopolitan capital Nouméa, while there are farms and farming communities all along the coast. =Rainforest= Mountain forests are mainly located on the lee slopes, where communities are evergreen species of laurel forest. The forests are typically evergreen because the mild climate allows for continuous biological activity. In the absence of a strong environmental selective pressure, the number of species that share the canopy is high. This diversity earns them the name \\"rainforest\\", as opposed to \\"woods\\" (\\"Mediterranean wood\\", \\"temperate wood\\", etc.), implying canopies dominated by one or a few tree species. In this sense, the laurel forest is a transitional formation between temperate forests and rainforests. Many tree species do not have a coordinated timing of shedding their leaves, flowering or fruit ripening, with phases occurring at any time of year. The woody plants including conifers of the families Podocarpaceae, Araucariaceae and the subfamily Callitroideae of Cupressaceae and angiosperms such as families Erythroxylaceae, Epacridaceae, Proteaceae, Griseliniaceae, Cunoniaceae, Atherospermataceae, and Winteraceae, and genera such as southern beech (Nothofagus). Many other families of flowering plants and ferns inhabit the forest, including some tree fern genera, know in Canada fossils, as Dicksonia and Cyathea (Cyathea novae-caledoniae),Dossier > La flore de Nouvelle- Calédonie - Deuxième partie or the tallest in the world, Cyathea intermedia. Amborella has emerged as of great interest to plant systematists due of recent molecular phylogenetic analyses. There are many epiphytes and large, hanging mossy formations, giving a surreal and ghostly effect. Moisture is abundant, creating a moist, hygrophilous environment with great visual appeal, in the form of mists, sprays, ponds and streams that permeate the entire visual field. Flora Tree ferns on Île des Pins New Caledonia's vegetation is distinguished by the world's highest rate of endemism: 5 families, 107 genera and 3,380 species. Among these are Acacia spirorbis, Dracophyllum species, Drosera neocaledonica, Grevillea gillivrayi, Neocallitropsis pancheri (Cupressaceae), and Austrotaxus spicatus (Taxaceae). Of the 44 species of Gymnosperm in the archipelago, 43 are endemic, including the unique parasite gymnosperm Parasitaxus ustus. The palm trees include 37 endemic species belonging to 16 genera. For the endangered Pritchardiopsis jennencyi, one only adult specimen is known. Three of the most primitive genera of Araliaceae also occur. Some New Caledonia plant communities are true living fossils. Flora contains many groups of plants that appear to be remnants of the Gondwanan flora in late Cretaceous - early Tertiary that once covered large parts of Australasia. The flora is exceedingly diverse and includes a level of endemism, per square kilometre, seen almost nowhere else on Earth. Three- quarters of native plant species on New Caledonia are endemic, but a quarter of those are \\"at risk\\" of decline or extinction. There are besides 454 species of marine macrophytes. In contrast, several groups that are well represented in the rest of tropics have only a few species on the Archipelago, such as Melastomataceae with one species, or are absent all together, e.g., Ochnaceae (sensu stricto) and Begoniaceae. Other families, such as Araceae, Boraginaceae, Brassicaceae, Commelinaceae, Gesneriaceae, and Zingiberaceae, are substantially under-represented. Five families are considered endemic: the Amborellaceae, the Oncothecaceae, the Phellinaceae that was often included in Aquifoliaceae, the Paracryphiaceae, and the Strasburgeriaceae, before placed in Ochnaceae. Some genera originated in the Gondwanian Antarctic flora. The most remarkable Gondwanian groups include the Cunoniaceae, the Myrtaceae, the Escalloniaceae and the Proteaceae. Due to this fact, the islands share many plant families with the Valdivian forest of South America, New Zealand, Tasmania and Australia, in habitats of cloud forest and temperate rainforest. Angiosperm flora colonized New Zealand and New Caledonia during the Cretaceous with genera such as Nothofagus, Forgesia, and Polyosma. Many other groups reached New Caledonia after it separated from Australia, which took place as part of a widespread movement of Indo-Malesian elements that expanded into Australasia during the early and middle Tertiary.(Holloway, 1979; Jaffré et al., 1993) Some of these newer flora speciated intensively and are now among the largest genera on the island. Examples include Phyllanthus, with 111 species, Psychotria with about 85 species, and Eugenia with around 37 species, Flindersia in the family Rutaceae, and Polyosma among others. Most Gymnosperm species are in rainforest. The Gymnosperms are more common in the poorer acid soils and in soils with an excess of magnesium and other phytotoxic elements derived from ultramafic rocks. 39 species are extant, while 27 are considered extinct. The Gymnosperms are more common on exposed ridges or next to rivers or creeks in floodplains. Their concentration is important at individual locations which provide lifesaving refugia, because environmental conditions make interspecific competition less severe. Four genera, Araucaria, Libocedrus, Prumnopitys and Retrophyllum that populate the subantarctic Pacific, have endemic species in New Caledonia. The genus Acmopyle (Podocarpaceae), currently present in New Caledonia and Fiji, is a fossil in Patagonia. There are 13 endemic species of Araucaria, including A. rulei and A. columnaris. The island shares some Araucaria species with Australia's Norfolk Island. Many, if not all current populations are relict. Angiosperms also include many groups of archaic characteristics that appear as vestiges of an old Gondwanan floral background. The bamboo genus Greslania is endemic to New Caledonia and comprises three or four species. They are found only in the southern part of the island where the soil contains heavy metals such as iron. Several genera, belonging to primitive families, are endemic or sub-endemic. Amborella is the monospecific endemic genus of the endemic family Amborellaceae. Others are Hedycarya and Kibaropsis (Monimiaceae), Nemuaron (Atherospermataceae) and Balanops (Balanopaceae). The Winteraceae, of the order Magnoliales, considered the oldest group of angiosperms, are represented by the genus Zygogynum with 18 species of an order with fifty genera ranging over the Moluccas islands to northern Australia. Among the families with conducting vessels absent or imperfect, New Caledonia has Atherospermataceae, Amborellaceae, Annonaceae and Winteraceae, representatives of families of Chloranthaceae, such as the genus Ascarina with two species, Piperaceae, with twenty species of genera Piper and Peperomia, and Trimeniaceae with Trimenia neocaledonica. The importance of the families of Gondwanan origin, both in the number of species and their abundance in different plant communities contrasts with the low representation in indigenous communities of more modern groups such as the Compositae, Gramineae, Labiatae and Melastomataceae. The groups of Gondwanan origin are the most remarkable flora and include Cunoniaceae, Proteaceae and Myrtaceae. The family of Cunoniaceae has six genera in New Caledonia. Pancheria and Codia are endemic, although the last is known as a fossil in Australia, while Cunonia has 23 endemic species in New Caledonia and one species in South Africa. The other three genera have a Papuan-Australian (Acsmithia), Australian (Geissois) and sub-Antarctic (Weinmannia) distribution. Proteaceae's two main centers of dispersion are in Australia and Southern Africa; the family is represented in the archipelago by 43 species. They divide into six endemic genera: Beauprea, Beaupreopsis, Garnieria, Kermadecia, Sleumerodendron and Virotia and three non-endemic genera Grevillea, Knightia and Stenocarpus. Myrtaceae, although basically Gondwanan in origin, currently range throughout the tropical world and have reached the Northern Hemisphere. With 229 species, it is the largest family in New Caledonia. It has two widely distributed genera, Eugenia and Syzygium. The endemic genera are Arillastrum, Cloezia, Myrtastrum, Pleurocalyptus, and Purpureostemon. The genus Melaleuca is represented by six endemic species and one shared with Australia and Papua New Guinea, Melaleuca quinquenervia, known locally as niaouli. Fauna The kagu represents not only an endemic species but also New Caledonia's only endemic bird family, the Rhynochetidae. The New Caledonia Great Barrier Reef is the second largest barrier reef in the world. Amedee island is a special marine reserve of coral reef lagoon, Ilot aux Goelands is a tiny lagoon island surrounded by a large shallow reef flat. The reef has great species diversity with a high level of endemism. Many groups have been under sampled and insufficiently studied, especially when considering hard bottoms of the intermediate coral reefs and external slopes of the barrier reef. This diversity includes oceanic and continental reefs forming islands, atolls, uplifted reefs, immerged reefs, fringing reefs, barrier reefs, patch reefs and shallow or deep lagoons, is home to endangered dugongs (Dugong dugon) and is an important nesting site for green sea turtle (Chelonia mydas). New Caledonia has a remarkable marine fauna due to the abundance of relic organisms from the Mesozoic.,(Vacelet et al. 1992, Roux et al. 1991) for example some sponges of the Lithistideae and the Tetractinellideae which are considered living fossils due to their closeness to Cretaceous species. The endemic mollusc Nautilus macromphalus is one of only four Nautilus species known in the world, the only living group of cephalopods with an external shell.. This mollusc seems to be identical to its Paleozoic ancestor. Cephalodiscus graptolitoides, described in 1993, is also considered a living fossil member of the graptolites, previously thought to be extinct for over 300 million years. Today's New Caledonian marine biodiversity has been counted to 9372 species, belonging to 3582 genera and 1107 families. Important groups that contribute include the molluscs (2151 species), fish (1695 species), the Foraminifera (585 species), the Brachyura (552 species) and the marine macrophytes (454 species).Payri and Richer de Forges 2007, www.ird.nc/biodec New Caledonia's animal land diversity was similar to that of some oceanic islands, particularly New Zealand and as in these islands, the biodiversity was greater before being inhabited by humans. The island has no native mammals except for bats and no native amphibians. The vertebrates are dominated by reptiles and birds. Today the island has 21 endemic species of birds, including one endemic family, the Rhynochetidae, represented by one living species, the kagu.Hunt, Gavin R. (1996): Family Rhynochetidae (Kagu).

The island is also home to the unusual tool-using New Caledonian crow. The separation of the Gondwana islands before the mammalian expansion that allowed the radiation of flightless birds (moa, kiwi, sylviornis, cagous) and Mesozoic reptilian forms such as the tuatara of New Zealand. Endemic species comprise 62 of 69 total. No crocodiles or terrestrial turtles remain on the islands. Two species of snake are found in the Territory, one on Grand Terre and the other on the Loyalty Islands. It is the home to a large number of skinks and geckos. The island Île des Pins is home to the crested gecko Correlophus ciliatus and the world's largest gecko Rhacodactylus leachianus. The island of Grande Terre has the greatest variety of reptiles, giant gecko, (Rhacodactylus leachianus) is present too, and the giant skink (Phoboscincus bocourti).. The local sea snakes laticaudinae have venom ten times as potent as rattlesnake venom. Before the arrival of Europeans, the only mammals in the island were six endemic bat species, including Rousettus, a large fruit bat that was eaten by locals. The world's highest biodiversity of Volutomitridae is in waters off New Caledonia.Bouchet, P. & Kantor, Y. I. (2003) \\"New Caledonia: the major centre of biodiversity for volutomitrid molluscs (Mollusca: Neogastropoda: Volutomitridae)\\". Systematics and Biodiversity 1(4): 467–502. Tropical invertebrates make up the bulk of the endemic fauna. They include freshwater sponges, annelid worms, molluscs terrestrial and freshwater, arachnids, scorpions and mygales of this many vicariant to the mygales of Queensland. There are fourteen endemic species of decapod crustaceans in rivers and lakes. Mites, Pauropoda, Isopoda and Collembola inhabit the island. The most studied insect orders are Diptera, Hymenoptera, Lepidoptera, Psocoptera, Odonata, Ephemeroptera, Trichoptera and Dermaptera. About 4,000 insect species are recorded, showing high endemism at the species and genus levels. Notable are the giant coconut grasshopper (Pseudophyllanax imperialis) and other endemic insects including an ant (Cerapachys cohici), a cicada Kanakia typica, a damselfly Caledopteryx maculata a longhorned beetle Buprestomorpha montrouzieri, a phasmid Gigantophasma bicolor and a leafcutting bee Eutricharaea australis. There are 521 species of Lepidoptera, with 197 endemic (38%), notably the butterfly Montrouzier's swallowtail (Papilio montrouzieri), Graphium gelon, Polyura gamma, Paratisiphone lyrnessa, Austroypthima petersi and a sphinx moth Compsulyx cochereaui. =Birds= There are twenty two endemic species of terrestrial birds, three endemic genera and one family. The New Caledonian crow (Corvus moneduloides) is known for its intelligence. The laurel forest pigeon (Columba vitiensis hyponochroa), giant wood pigeon notou (Ducula goliath). Two genera are endemic: Drepanoptila (the green pigeon), and Eunymphicus, Ouvea parakeet. The New Caledonian parakeet known to be the basal species in the genus Cyanoramphus, which had its origins in New Caledonia from where it spread to many ocean Pacific islands. The best-known animal species is the Rhynochetos jubatus or cagou, which is at risk from dogs, rats and other predators. It is a chicken-sized bird, almost unable to fly, with a long crest and a funny cackling song, found in leafy forest mountains. The other terrestrial bird endemics are Accipiter haplochrous, Philemon diemenensis, Erythrura psittacea, Zosterops xanthochroa, Phylidonyris undulata, Pachycephala caledonica, Aplonis striata, Gymnomyza aubryana, Eopsaltria flaviventris, Coracina analis, Myzomela caledonica, island thrushes (Turdus poliocephalus) T. p. xanthopus, T. p. pritzbueri (probably extinct) and Megalurulus mariei. Threats New Caledonia's biodiversity is threatened by many factors.Pascal, M; De Forges, B;, Le Guyader, H & D Simberloff (2008) \\"Mining and Other Threats to the New Caledonia Biodiversity Hotspot\\" Conservation Biology 22 (2), 498–499 The ecosystems of isolated islands are typically vulnerable to takeover by introduced species, because they faced reduced competitive pressure as they originally evolved. Insects as Wasmannia auropunctata and mammals such as rat, cat, dog and pig have taken a toll on native species, such as the ground-living kagu. Deforestation from logging, mining, uncontrolled fires, agriculture, urban development and tourism all increase pressure on these fragile ecosystems by destroying vital habitat. Hunting is a problem in remote areas. Some species are at risk from overexploitation as medicinal plants. Deforestation alone could cause the extinction of complete genera and orders across the restricted region with an accompanying loss of genetic and phylogenic information. For example, the reproductive structures of primigenia group of Amborella are true flowers that have a unique and provide an anatomical bridge between the structures seen for cone-bearing and flower-bearing plants. Its order is found only in New Caledonia. The mining industry is focused on the island's rich nickel deposits, which comprise about one fourth of world reserves. In consequence, mining poses serious threats to its ecology. The dry zone is the area most degraded by human activity, largely occupied by Colonial buildings fronting fine beaches and the infrastructure of the nickel industry. Despite these threats, no species are known to have become extinct since 1500. Two species, the New Caledonian rail and the New Caledonian lorikeet have not been seen for over a hundred years and are considered to be critically endangered if not actually extinct. A similar fate was thought to have befallen the New Caledonian owlet-nightjar, but a recent survey found them in remote areas.BirdLife International (2006) \\"New Caledonia's most wanted Accessed 21 April 2008. The New Caledonian crested gecko was thought to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 1994. Native grasses are being outcompeted by robust, introduced competitors, such as Melinis minutiflora. The biodiversity of native tree species has protected against invasive introduced tree species, as has happened on other Pacific islands. The government created protective parks and reserves. Preservation New Caledonia is considered a conservation priority by many environmental organizations, which have lobbied to preserve the islands' unique ecosystems. To date they have failed to achieve definitive protection for New Caledonia's remaining natural areas. For instance, all attempts to grant them UNESCO World Heritage Site-status protection failed, due to opposition by regional governments and mining and development interests. Mining continues to expand in sensitive areas, although mining companies perform minimal rehabilitation after a mine closes. However, even when taking such rehabilitation efforts into account, mining activity devastates the local biodiversity. World Heritage Site-status would limit mining activity in areas of ecological importance, affecting employment and government revenues. Grass-roots conservation efforts have been tentative at best, and invariably failed when in direct conflict with mining and other development projects. Recent efforts to increase habitat protection met with strong official opposition, and violence against the proponents. Notably, Bruno Van Peteghem, recipient of the 2001 Goldman Environmental Prize, used the local court system to force government leaders to obey laws protecting the country's coral reefs. After winning in court, his home was firebombed, and his family was repeatedly threatened.Tolmé, P. (2002) \\"\\"Little Scum\\" Takes On Big Mining\\". National Wildlife 40 (4) Ultimately, the head of government, Jacques Lafleur, succeeded in silencing Van Peteghem, forcing him into de facto exile by arranging the termination of his employment with the national airline.

Established in 1968, Gombe is one of the smallest national parks in Tanzania, with only of protected land along the hills of the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika.The Jane Goodall Institute: “Gombe Stream Research Center”, 2008. The terrain is distinguished by steep valleys, and the forest vegetation ranges from grassland to woodland to tropical rainforest.PBS: Nature- “Jane Goodall’s Wild Chimpanzees”, 1996. Accessible only by boat, the park is most famous as the location where Jane Goodall pioneered her behavioral research conducted on the chimpanzee populations. The Kasekala chimpanzee community, featured in several books and documentaries, lives in Gombe National Park. Gombe’s high levels of diversity make it an increasingly popular tourist destination. Besides chimpanzees, primates inhabiting Gombe include beachcomber olive baboons, red colobus, red-tailed monkeys, blue monkeys, and vervet monkeys. Red-tailed monkeys and blue monkeys have also been known to hybridize in the area. The park is also home to over 200 bird species and bushpigs. There are also many species of snakes, and occasional hippopotami and leopards.African Ape Study Sites: “Gombe National Park, Tanzania”, 1999. Visitors to the park can trek into the forest to view the chimpanzees, as well as swim and snorkel in Lake Tanganyika with almost 100 kinds of colorful cichlid fish. Jane Goodall Jane Goodall first traveled to Tanzania in 1960 at the age of 26 with no formal college training. At the time, it was accepted that humans were undoubtedly similar to chimpanzees—we share over 98% of the same genetic code. However, little was known about chimpanzee behavior or community structure. At the time she began her research, she says “it was not permissible, at least not in ethological circles, to talk about an animal's mind. Only humans had minds. Nor was it quite proper to talk about animal personality. Of course everyone knew that they did have their own unique characters--everyone who had ever owned a dog or other pet was aware of that. But ethologists, striving to make theirs a \\"hard\\" science, shied away from the task of trying to explain such things objectively.”Jane Goodall, “Learning from the Chimpanzees: A Message Humans Can Understand” Science, 1998. However, her research eventually proved just that—the intellectual and emotional sophistication of non-humans, chimpanzees in particular. With the support of renowned anthropologist Louis Leakey, Goodall set up a small research station in Gombe in hopes of learning more about the behavior of our closest relatives. There she spent months tracking the elusive chimpanzee troops, particularly the Kasekela chimpanzee community, and observing their daily habits until she was slowly accepted by one troop and was allowed rare and intimate glimpses into chimpanzee society. =Research findings= Social grooming of chimps observed in Gombe NP Without college training directing her research, Goodall observed things that strict scientific doctrines may have overlooked. Instead of numbering the chimpanzees she observed, she gave them names such as Fifi and David Greybeard, and observed them to have unique and individual personalities, an unconventional idea at the time. She found that \\"it isn’t only human beings who have personality, who are capable of rational thought [and] emotions like joy and sorrow\\". She also observed behaviors such as hugs, kisses, pats on the back, and even tickling, what people consider identifiable human actions. Goodall insists that these gestures are evidence of “the close, supportive, affectionate bonds that develop between family members and other individuals within a community, which can persist throughout a life span of more than 50 years.” These findings suggest similarities between humans and chimpanzees exist in more than genes alone, but can be seen in emotion, intelligence, and family and social relationships. Goodall’s research at Gombe is best known to the scientific community for challenging two long-standing beliefs of the day: that only humans could construct and use tools, and that chimpanzees were passive vegetarians. While observing one chimpanzee feeding at a termite mound, she watched him repeatedly place stalks of grass into termite holes, then remove them from the hole covered with clinging termites, effectively “fishing” for termites.Goodall, Jane. Reason for Hope: A Spiritual Journey. New York: Warner Books, 1999. The chimps would also take twigs from trees and strip off the leaves to make the twig more effective, a form of object modification which is the rudimentary beginnings of toolmaking. Humans had long distinguished ourselves from the rest of the animal kingdom as “Man the Toolmaker”. In response to Goodall’s revolutionary findings, Louis Leakey wrote, “We must now redefine man, redefine tool, or accept chimpanzees as human!” Over the course of her study, Goodall found evidence of mental traits in chimpanzees such as reasoned thought, abstraction, generalization, symbolic representation, and even the concept of self, all previously thought to be uniquely human abilities.The Jane Goodall Institute: “Chimpanzee Central”, 2008. Hunting chimp with prey In contrast to the peaceful and affectionate behaviors she observed, Goodall also found an aggressive side of chimp nature at Gombe. She discovered that chimps will systematically hunt and eat smaller primates, such as colobus monkeys. Goodall watched a hunting group isolate a colobus monkey high in a tree and block all possible exits, then one chimpanzee climbed up and captured and killed the colobus. The others then each took parts of the carcass, sharing with other members of the troop in response to begging behaviors. The chimps at Gombe kill and eat as much as one-third of the colobus population in the park each year. This alone was a major scientific find which challenged previous conceptions of chimp diet and behavior. But perhaps more startling, and disturbing, was the tendency for aggression and violence within chimpanzee troops. Goodall observed dominant females deliberately killing the young of other females in the troop in order to maintain their dominance, sometimes going so far as cannibalism. She says of this revelation, “During the first ten years of the study I had believed […] that the Gombe chimpanzees were, for the most part, rather nicer than human beings. […] Then suddenly we found that chimpanzees could be brutal—that they, like us, had a darker side to their nature.” These findings revolutionized contemporary knowledge of chimpanzee diet and feeding behaviors, and were further evidence of the social similarities between humans and chimpanzees, albeit in a much darker manner. =Gombe Stream Research Center= Feeding station where Jane Goodall used to feed the chimps Goodall lived at Gombe almost full-time for fifteen years and the long-term data she accumulated is still of value to scientists today. In 1967, the Gombe Stream Research Center (GSRC) was established to coordinate ongoing chimpanzee research in the park. Run mostly by a team of trained Tanzanians, the GSRC is the longest-running field study of an animals species in their natural surroundings, now over 40 years. This long-term data has provided scientists with insight into chimpanzee demographic patterns, male politics, hunting, culture and mother-infant relationships over multiple generations—rare and valuable data. The ongoing research is also providing information on the current threats to chimpanzees, such as disease, poaching, and habitat disturbance, which affect other species at Gombe as well.Pusey et al., “The Contribution of Long-Term Research at Gombe National Park to Chimpanzee Conservation” , Conservation Biology, 2007. The research of Goodall has also drastically changed ethological thinking and how behavioral studies are conducted. Where once talk of animal emotion was dismissed as anthropomorphism, her observations of animals in their natural habitat show that societies, behavior, and relationships between animals are quite complex. Her research of chimpanzee habitat (food and special) requirements also aid in improved design for new protected areas. The GSRC also conducts research on the baboon population, led by the Jane Goodall Center for Primate Studies.African Conservation Foundation: “Gombe Stream Research Centre”, 2008. Research from the GSRC has resulted in 35 Ph.D. theses, over 400 papers and 30 books. Conservation The biodiversity of Gombe National Park is primarily threatened by human encroachment. Although 25% of Tanzania is set aside in parks and reserves, wildlife populations are still declining.Property & Environment Research Center: “Overcoming Government Obstacles- Some Tanzanian Communities Manage Wildlife” , 2004. This is mainly due to the lack of collaboration between park management, government sectors, and rural communities. Village lands often lie between parks and become obstacles for animals traveling between protected areas. Without incentives to protect the animals, rural communities will hunt them for food or kill them for safety reasons. Poverty also increases the demand.

He is the Shirley and Leonard Ely Professor of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford University, a position he has held since 1987. Milgrom is an expert in game theory, specifically auction theory and pricing strategies. He is the winner of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, together with Robert B. Wilson, \\"for improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats\\". He is the co-creator of the no-trade theorem with Nancy Stokey. He is the co-founder of several companies, the most recent of which, Auctionomics,Auctionomics provides software and services for commercial auctions and exchanges. Milgrom and his thesis advisor Wilson designed the auction protocol the FCC uses to determine which phone company gets what cellular frequencies. Milgrom also led the team that designed the broadcast incentive auction between 2016 and 2017, which was a two-sided auction to reallocate radio frequencies from TV broadcast to wireless broadband uses.Incentive Auction Rules Option and Discussion September 12, 2012. Early life and education Paul Milgrom was born in Detroit, Michigan, April 20, 1948, the second of four sons to Jewish parents Abraham Isaac Milgrom and Anne Lillian Finkelstein. His family moved to Oak Park, Michigan, and Milgrom attended the Dewey School and then Oak Park High School. Milgrom graduated from the University of Michigan in 1970 with an AB in mathematics. He worked as an actuary for several years in San Francisco at the Metropolitan Insurance Company and then at the Nelson and Warren consultancy in Columbus, Ohio. Milgrom became a Fellow of the Society of Actuaries in 1974. In 1975, Milgrom enrolled for graduate studies at Stanford University and earned an MS in statistics in 1978 and a PhD in business in 1979. Academic career Milgrom assumed a teaching position at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University where he served from 1979 to 1983. Milgrom was part of a group of professors including future Nobel laureate Roger Myerson, Robert B. Wilson, Bengt Holmstrom, Nancy Stokey, Robert J. Weber, John Roberts and Mark Satterthwaite that helped to bring game theory and information economics to bear on a wide range of problems in economics such as pricing, auctions, financial markets, and industrial organization. Weber recounted his collaboration with Milgrom. During what was supposed to be a brief meeting to ponder a problem faced by Weber, Milgrom had a key insight. Weber wrote, \\"And there, in a matter of a few minutes, was the heart of our first two joint papers.\\" From 1982 to 1987, Milgrom was a professor of economics and management at Yale University. In 1987, Milgrom returned as an economics professor to his alma mater, Stanford University, where he is currently the Shirley and Leonard Ely Professor of Humanities and Sciences in the Department of Economics. Milgrom held editorial positions at the American Economic Review, Econometrica and the Journal of Economic Theory. He became a Fellow of the Econometric Society in 1984, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1992. In 1996, he gave the Nobel memorial lectureProcuring Universal Service: Putting Auction Theory to Work, in Le Prix Nobel: The Nobel Prizes, 1996, Nobel Foundation, 1997, 382-392. honoring the laureate William Vickrey, who had died three days after the Nobel prize announcement. In 2006, Milgrom was elected to the National Academy of Sciences. = Awards and honors = Milgrom received the Erwin Plein Nemmers Prize in Economics in 2008 \\"for contributions dramatically expanding the understanding of the role of information and incentives in a variety of settings, including auctions, the theory of the firm, and oligopolistic markets.\\" Upon receiving the Nemmers Prize in 2008, the official releaseNemmers Prize Press Release, 2008 highlighted the following: > Milgrom's path-breaking work has developed and popularized new tools for the > analysis of asymmetric information and strategic interaction and, most > significantly, has shown the usefulness of those tools for the analysis of > applied problems,\\" said Charles Manski, professor and chair of economics at > Northwestern.

Reputation formation In an influential 1982 paper with David M. Kreps, John Roberts, and Robert B. Wilson (Kreps et.al., 1982), Milgrom showed that if one or both players have even a very small probability of being committed to playing tit-for-tat, then in equilibrium both players cooperate until the last few periods. This is because even an uncommitted player has an incentive to \\"build a reputation\\" for being committed to tit-for-tat, as doing so makes the other player want to cooperate. The Kreps-Milgrom-Roberts-Wilson \\"Gang of Four\\" paper launched an entire branch of the game theory literature on such \\"reputation effects.\\" Distributional strategies Milgrom's 1985 paper with Robert J. Weber on distributional strategies showed the general existence of equilibria for a Bayesian game with finitely many players, if the players' sets of types and actions are compact metric spaces, the players' payoffs are continuous functions of the types and actions, and the joint distribution of the players' types is absolutely continuous with respect to the product of their marginal distributions. These basic assumptions are always satisfied if the sets of types and actions are finite. Repeated games Milgrom made a fundamental contribution to the theory of repeated games. When players' actions are hidden and noisy signals about their actions are observable (i.e., in the case of imperfect monitoring), there are two general ways to achieve efficiency. One way is to transfer future payoffs from one player to others. This is a way to punish a potential deviator without reducing the total future payoffs. The classical folk theorem result under imperfect monitoring is built on this idea. The second general method is to delay the release of information. Under the second method, the outcomes of the noisy signals are released in every T periods, and upon the release of information players \\"review\\" the signals in the last T periods and decide to punish or reward each other. This is now widely known as the \\"review strategy\\", and Milgrom's paper with D. Abreu and D. Pearce (Abreu, Milgrom and Pearce, 1991) was the first to show the efficiency of review strategy equilibrium in discounted repeated games. The review strategy turns out to be useful when players receive private signals about each other's actions (the case of private monitoring), and the folk theorem for the private monitoring caseSugaya, T. (2013), \\"The Folk Theorem in Repeated Games with Private Monitoring,\\" mimeo, Stanford GSB. is built on the idea of the review strategy. Supermodular games The theory of supermodular games is an important recent developments in economic theory. Key contributions to this theory include seminal work Topkis's Theorem, Vives (1990), and the Milgrom and Roberts (1990c). The impact and importance of the theory of supermodular games came from its breadth of application, including search, technology adoption, bank runs, arms races, pretrial negotiations, two-player Cournot competition, N-player Bertrand competition, and oil exploration, and the economics of organizations (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b). Learning in games Milgrom and Roberts build on their work in supermodular games to understand the processes by which strategic agents reach equilibrium in a normal-form game. In Milgrom and Roberts (1991), they proposed two learning processes each with a degree of generality so as to not model learning but learning processes. They considered a sequence of plays over time which, for a player n, is denoted {xn(t)} where for each possible time, t, xn(t) is a pure strategy. Given this, an observed sequence, {xn(t)}, is consistent with adaptive learning if a player n eventually chooses only strategies that are nearly best-replies to some probability distribution over the joint strategies of other players (with near zero probability being assigned to strategies that have not been played for a sufficiently long time). By contrast, {xn(t)}, is consistent with sophisticated learning if the player eventually chooses only nearly best-replies to their probabilistic forecast of the choices of other players, where the support of that probability distribution may include not only past plays but also strategies that the players might choose if they themselves were adaptive or sophisticated learners. Thus, a sequence consistent with adaptive learning is also consistent with sophisticated learning. Sophisticated learning allows players to make use of payoff information that is used in equilibrium analysis but does not impose the fulfilled expectations requirement of equilibrium analysis. With these definitions in place, Milgrom and Roberts showed that if a sequence converges to a Nash equilibrium or correlated equilibrium then it is consistent with adaptive learning. This gave a certain generality to those processes. They then showed how these processes related to the elimination of dominated strategies. This was shown to have implications for convergence in Cournot and Bertrand games.See also Gans, J.S. \\"Best Replies and Adaptive Learning,\\" Mathematical Social Sciences, Vol.30, No.3, 1995, pp.221-234. =Comparative statics= Milgrom's research has often highlighted the restrictiveness (and often superfluity) of these assumptions in economic applications. For example, in the study of modern manufacturing (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b), one would like to focus on the complementarity or substitutability across production inputs, without making assumptions on scale economies or divisibility (through a concavity condition on the production function). Monotonic relationships, in which more of one quantity would imply more of another, are found pervasively in economic analysis. Milgrom pioneered in the development of new mathematical methods for understanding monotonic relationships in economics. His work on auctions with Robert Weber introduced the concept of affiliation of random variables, to indicate systems of unknown quantities where learning that any one of them is higher than some given level would cause beliefs about others to be higher. His work with John Roberts and Chris Shannon advanced the use of supermodularity as a property of individuals' preferences that can yield general monotonicity results in economic analysis. The work of Milgrom and Shannon (1994) showed that comparative statics results could often be obtained through more relevant and intuitive ordinal conditions. Indeed, they show that their concept of quasi-supermodularity (a generalization of supermodular function) along with the single-crossing property, is necessary and sufficient for comparative statics to obtain on arbitrary choice sets. Their theory extends earlier work in the Operations Research literature (Topkis, 1968;Topkis, D. (1968). Ordered Optimal Decisions. Ph.D. Dissertation, Stanford University. Veinott, 1989Veinott, A. F. (1989). Lattice programming. Unpublished lectures.) which already uses lattice theory but focuses on cardinal concepts. Milgrom and John Roberts (1994) extended this to comparative statics on equilibria, while Milgrom (1994) demonstrated its wider applicability in comparing optima. Milgrom and Roberts (1996) also generalized Paul Samuelson's application of Le Chatelier's Principle in economics. In related work, Milgrom and Ilya Segal (2002) reconsidered the Envelope Theorem and its applications in light of the developments in monotone comparative statics. Due to the influence of Milgrom and Shannon's paper and related research by Milgrom and others, these techniques, now often referred to as monotone comparative statics, are widely known and used in economic modelling. The single-crossing property as reformulated by Milgrom and Shannon was subsequently shown by Joshua Gans and Michael Smart not only to resolve Condorcet's Voting paradox in majority voting and social choice theory but also to give rise to a complete characterization of social preferences. Susan Athey extended these results to consider economic problems with uncertainty. Writing in 1994 on the comparative statics and theoretical modeling, Milgrom relates a theorem that would demonstrate when a result with a specific functional form may easily generalize, and notes: > These conclusions do not mean that functional form assumptions are either > useless or inconsequential for economic analysis.

His work comprises three broad theoretical and practical efforts in the field : auction theory and matching theory, and simplifying participants' message. =Organizational and information economics= Agency theory Milgrom, together with Bengt Holmstrom, asked what features of a contracting problem would give rise to a simpler, say, linear, incentive scheme (that is, a scheme in which the wage consisted of a base amount plus amounts that were directly proportional to specific performance measures). Previously, most theoretical papers in agency theory assumed that the main problem was to provide an incentive for an agent to exert more effort on just one activity. But in many situations, agents can actually exert unobservable efforts on several different activities. In such contexts, new kinds of incentive problems can arise, since giving an agent more incentive to exert effort on one dimension could cause the agent to neglect other important dimensions. Holmstrom and Milgrom believed that incorporating this multi-dimensional feature of incentive problems would generate implications for optimal incentive design that were more relevant for real world contracting problems. In their 1987 paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom introduced new techniques for studying multidimensional agency problems. The key insight in the Holmstrom-Milgrom paper is that simple linear incentive schemes can become optimal when the agent can monitor the evolution over time of the performance measures on which his compensation will be based. In that paper, an agent continuously chooses the drift of an N-dimensional Brownian motion, contingent on observing the whole history of the process. Under some assumptions on the agent's utility function, it is shown that the optimal compensation scheme for the principal specifies a payment to the agent that is a linear function of the time- aggregates of the performance measures. Such a linear compensation scheme imposes a \\"uniform incentive pressure\\" on the agent, leading him to choose a constant drift for each dimension of the Brownian process. Having demonstrated that the optimal incentive contract in a dynamic principal-agent problem will be linear in certain environments, Holmstrom and Milgrom then used linear contracts to explore in more detail what happens when agents allocate their efforts or attention across multiple tasks. Prior to 1991, models had generally considered effort on a single task. To reward performance on a single task, a principal can either reward performance (or some measure of it) or change the agent's opportunity cost of performing that task. This second strategy is key to understanding what happens when an agent has more than one task to which he can allocate effort, because increasing the reward on one task will generally alter the agent's opportunity cost of allocating effort to other tasks, increasing it when the tasks are substitutes for the agent and decreasing it when the tasks are complements. Holmstrom and Milgrom's (1991) paper demonstrates that when tasks are substitutes for the agent and it is difficult to measure performance on one of them, it may be optimal to have low-powered incentives, or even no incentives, on all tasks, even if some can be easily measured.Francis Woolley also relates how the notation in that paper represented best practice in economic theory. Notation: A Beginner's Guide, Worthwhile Canadian Initiative, 17 April 2013. They also demonstrated that the difficulties of providing incentives on multiple tasks have implications for the design of jobs. For instance, it may be better to split conflicting tasks between agents or to vary the intensity of monitoring and communication. Finally, in their 1994 paper, Holmstrom and Milgrom broadened the scope of their analysis to include not only performance-related pay but also other management choices that affect agents' incentives, such as choices about how much discretion to give agents and about whether or not agents own the assets with which they work. This paper stressed the interactions (the \\"complementarities\\") between these different choices, showing that the optimal choices for the principal will often vary together as the contracting environment changes. Holmstrom recounted the impact of this work at the Nemmers Conference in Honor of Paul Milgrom.Holmstrom Nemmers Presentation, 2008 Retrieved July 11, 2019. Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) anticipated an important aspect of the debate in education on the issue of teacher pay and incentives. In considering incentive pay for teachers based on student test scores, they wrote: > Proponents of the system, guided by a conception very like the standard one- > dimensional incentive model, argue that these incentives will lead teachers > to work harder at teaching and to take greater interest in their students' > success. Opponents counter that the principal effect of the proposed reform > would be that teachers would sacrifice such activities as promoting > curiosity and creative thinking and refining students' oral and written > communication skills in order to teach the narrowly defined basic skills > that are tested on standardised exams.

Information economics In Milgrom (1981), Milgrom introduced into economics a new notion of \\"favorableness\\" for information; namely, that one observation x is more favorable than another observation y, if, for all prior beliefs about the variable of interest, the posterior belief conditional on x first-order stochastically dominates the posterior conditional on y. Milgrom and others have used this notion of favorableness and the associated \\"monotone likelihood ratio property\\" of information structures to derive a range of important results in information economics, from properties of the optimal incentive contract in a principal-agent problem, to the notion of the winner's curse in auction theory. In the same paper, Milgrom introduced a novel \\"persuasion game\\", in which a salesperson has private information about a product, which he can, if he chooses, verifiably report to a potential buyer. (That is, the salesperson can, if he wishes, conceal his information, but he cannot misreport it if he reveals it.) Milgrom demonstrates that, with substantial generality, at every sequential equilibrium of the sales encounter game, the salesperson employs a strategy of full disclosure. This result has come to be known as the \\"unraveling result,\\" because Milgrom shows that, in any candidate equilibrium in which the buyer expects the salesperson to conceal some observations, the salesperson will have an incentive to reveal the most favorable (to himself) of those observations---thus, any strategy of concealment will \\"unravel\\". In a subsequent paper (1986), Milgrom and John Roberts observed that when there is competition among informed, self- interested agents to persuade an uninformed party, all of the relevant information may be disclosed in equilibrium even if the uninformed party (e.g. the buyer) is not as sophisticated as was assumed in the analysis with a single informed agent (e.g. the salesperson). The unraveling result has implications for a wide variety of situations in which individuals can strategically choose whether to conceal information, but in which lying carries substantial penalties. These situations include courtroom battles, regulation of product testing, and financial disclosure. Milgrom's persuasion game has been hugely influential in the study of financial accounting as a tool for understanding the strategic response of management to changes in disclosure regulation. This work has led to a large literature on strategic communication and information revelation. Organizational economics In the late 1980s, Milgrom began working with John Roberts to apply ideas from game theory and incentive theory to the study of organizations. Early on in this research, they focused on the importance of complementarities in organizational design. Activities in an organization are complementary, or synergistic, when there is a return to coordination. For example, a company that wants to make frequent changes in its production process will benefit from training workers in a flexible manner that allows them to adapt to these changes. Milgrom and Roberts first came on the ideas and applicability of complements when studying an enriched version of the classic news vendor problem of how to organize production that allowed both make to order after learning demand and make to stock (Milgrom and Roberts, 1988). The problem they formulated turned out to be a convex maximization problem, so the solutions were end points, not interior optima where first derivatives were zero. So the Hicks-Samuelson methods for comparative statics were not applicable. Yet they got rich comparative statics results. This led Milgrom to recall the work of Topkis (1968), particularly Topkis's theorem, which led to their development and application of complementarity ideas in many spheres. The incorporation of these methods into economics, discussed below, has proved very influential. In perhaps their most famous paper on organizations, (Milgrom and Roberts, 1990b) Milgrom and Roberts used comparative statics methods to describe the development of \\"modern manufacturing,\\" characterized by frequent product redesigns and improvements, higher production quality, speedier communication and order processing, smaller batch sizes, and lower inventories. Subsequently, Milgrom and Bengt Holmstrom (1994), used similar methods to identify complementarities in incentive design. They argued that the use of high-intensity performance incentives would be complementary to placing relatively few restrictions on workers and decentralizing asset ownership. In an influential paper, Milgrom and Roberts (1994) applied the framework of thinking about change of a system of complements to tackle some key issues in organizational economics. They noted that when organizations adapt by changing one element in a complementary system, it can often be the case that performance will degrade. This will make change a hard sell within organizations. Milgrom and Roberts suggested that this is why businesses had been unable to replicate Lincoln Electric's performance incentive system because the classic piece rate contract was supported by a string of human resource policies (e.g., subjective bonuses, lifetime employment) as well as production management policies (including organizational slack on delivery), and, perhaps most importantly, deep trust between workers and management. Thus, successful replication would require getting all of these elements in place. Milgrom and Roberts used the same theory to forecast the difficulties Japanese businesses would have in adjusting to change in the decade and a half following the recession that began in the early 1990s; a prediction that was borne out by subsequent experience. In a series of papers, Milgrom studied the problem of lobbying and politicking, or \\"influence activities\\" that occur in large organizations. These papers considered models in which employees are affected by post-hiring decisions. When managers have discretion over these decisions, employees have incentives to spend time attempting to influence the outcomes. Since this time could instead be spent on productive tasks, influence activities are costly for the firm. Milgrom shows that firms may limit the discretion of managers in order to avoid these costs (Milgrom, 1988). In a paper with John Roberts, Milgrom also studied a model in which employees have information that is valuable to the decision maker. As a result, allowing some degree of influence is beneficial, but excessive influence is costly. Milgrom and Roberts compare various strategies that firms might use to discourage excessive influence activities, and they show that typically, limiting employees' access to decision makers and altering decision-making criteria are preferable to the use of explicit financial incentives (Milgrom and Roberts, 1988). In another paper, with Margaret Meyer and Roberts (1992), Milgrom studied the influence costs that arise in multiunit firms. They demonstrate that managers of underperforming units have incentives to exaggerate the prospects of their unit in order to protect their jobs. If the unit were embedded in a firm whose other units were more closely related, there would be a lower threat of layoffs, because reassignment of workers could occur instead. Similarly, if the unit were independent, there would many fewer opportunities to misrepresent its prospects. These arguments help explain why divestitures of underperforming units occur so frequently and why, when such units do not become stand-alone firms, they are often purchased by buyers operating in related lines of business. In 1992, Milgrom and Roberts published their textbook on organizations, Economics, Organization and Management. The book covers a wide range of topics in the theory of organizations using modern economic theory. It is Milgrom's most cited work, a remarkable fact, given that it is a textbook aimed at undergraduates and masters students, while Milgrom has so many highly influential, widely cited research papers. In addition to discussing incentive design and complementarities, the book discusses some of the inefficiencies that can arise in large organizations, including the problem of lobbying or \\"influence costs.\\" In the 2008 Nemmers Prize conference, Roberts commentedRoberts' Nemmers Presentation, 2008 that the impact of the work on influence on management scholarship had exceeded its impact on economic scholarship. =Industrial organization= In a series of three seminal papers, Milgrom and Roberts developed some of the central ideas regarding asymmetric information in the context of industrial organization. The work of George Akerlof, Joseph Stiglitz, and especially Michael Spence, mostly developed in the 1970s, provides some of the conceptual and methodological background. However, it was primarily in the 1980s and largely due to the Milgrom-Roberts contributions in applying incomplete information game theory to industrial organization problems that these ideas were adopted into the mainstream of the field. Consider first the case of predatory pricing. For a long time, McGee's (1958) analysis, frequently associated with the Chicago school, provided the only coherent economic perspective regarding the main issues. McGee (1958) argued that the concept of predatory pricing lacks logical consistency. His idea is that, in addition to the prey, the predator too suffers from predatory pricing. If the prey resists predation and remains active, then the predator eventually will give up its efforts. Anticipating this outcome, the prey is indeed better off by resisting predatory efforts. Anticipating this outcome, in turn, the alleged predator is better off by refraining from its predatory strategy. Even if the alleged prey were short of cash, it could always borrow from a bank with the (correct) promise that its losses are only temporary. Further, supposing the predation were successful in inducing exit, if the predator subsequently raised prices to enjoy the fruits of its victory, new entry could be attracted, and the problem starts all over. Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), as well as Kreps and Wilson (1982), provide a novel perspective on the issue. Methodologically, this perspective is based on the concept of reputation developed by Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts and Wilson (1982), where reputation is understood as the Bayesian posterior that uninformed agents (e.g., an entrant) hold about the type of an informed agent (e.g., an incumbent). Suppose that, with some small probability, an incumbent may be \\"irrational\\" to the point of always fighting entry (even if this is not a profit maximizing reaction to entry). In this context, by repeatedly fighting rivals with low prices, a predator increases its reputation for \\"toughness\\"; and thus encourages exit and discourages future entry. If Kreps, Milgrom, Roberts and Wilson (1982) effectively created a novel economic theory of reputation, Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), as well as Kreps and Wilson (1982), provided a first application to an outstanding issue of central importance in industrial organization theory and policy (predatory pricing). Appendix A in Milgrom and Roberts (1982a) proposes an alternative theory for equilibrium predatory pricing, that is, an alternative response to McGee's (1958) Chicago school criticism. In this appendix, Milgrom and Roberts examine an infinite horizon version of Selten's chain-store model (with complete information) and demonstrate the existence of an equilibrium where any attempted entry is met by predation — and thus entry does not take place in equilibrium. Returning to the issue of information asymmetry between incumbent and entrant, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) consider the alternative case when the entrant is uncertain about the incumbent's costs. In this case, they show that the incumbent's low prices signal that its costs are low too, and so are the target's long term prospects from entry. Like Milgrom and Roberts (1982a), this paper brought formal understanding to an old idea in industrial organization, this time the concept of limit pricing. In the process of doing so, the paper also uncovered new results of interest. In particular, Milgrom and Roberts (1982b) show that the equilibrium entry rate may actually increase when asymmetric information is introduced. Finally, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) bring the asymmetric information framework to bear in analyzing the issue of advertising and pricing. Traditionally, economists have thought of advertising as being either informative (as for example classified ads, which describe the characteristics of the product for sale), or persuasive (as for example many television commercials which seem to provide little or no information about a product's characteristics). Following earlier ideas by Nelson (1970, 1974), Milgrom and Roberts (1986) show that even \\"uninformative\\" advertising, that is, advertising expenditures that provide no direct information about a product's characteristics, may be informative in equilibrium to the extent that they work as a signal of the advertiser's quality level. Methodologically, Milgrom and Roberts (1986) also make an important contribution: the study of signaling equilibria when the informed party has more than one available signal (price and advertising, in the present case). =Law, institutions and economic history= Milgrom made early contributions to the growing literature applying game theoretic models to our understanding of the evolution of the legal institutions of the market economy. Milgrom, Douglass North and Barry Weingast (1990) presents a repeated game model that shows the role for a formal institution that serves as a repository of judgments about contract behavior to coordinate a multilateral reputation mechanism. Milgrom and his co-authors argued that this model sheds light on the development of the Law Merchant, an institution of late medieval trade in Europe, whereby merchants looked to the judgments of the Law Merchant to decide what counted as \\"cheating.\\" In their model, merchants query the Law Merchant to determine whether a potential trading partner has cheated on prior contracts, triggering the application of punishment by other merchants. The incentive to punish in this model arises from the structure of the repeated game, assumed to be a prisoners' dilemma, where cheating is the dominant strategy and the only incentive not to cheat is because future partners can learn of this and cheating a cheater is not punishable; this makes the equilibrium sub-game perfect. Understanding the merchants' incentives to create an institution to support decentralized contract enforcement like this helps to overcome the tendency in the law and economics and positive political theory literatures to assume that the role of law is exclusively attributable to the capacity to take advantage of centralized enforcement mechanisms such as state courts and police power. In a further contribution in this area, Milgrom, together with Barry Weingast and Avner Greif, applied a repeated game model to explain the role of merchant guilds in the medieval period (Greif, Milgrom and Weingast, 1994). The paper beings with the observation that long-distance trade in the somewhat chaotic environment of the Middle Ages exposed traveling merchants to the risk of attack, confiscation of goods and unenforced agreements. Merchants thus required the assistance of local rulers for protection of person, property and contract. But what reason did rulers have to provide this assistance? A key insight from the paper is that neither bilateral nor multilateral reputation mechanisms can support the incentives of a ruler to protect foreign merchants as trade reaches an efficient level. The reason is that at the efficient level the marginal value of losing the trade of a single or even a subset of merchants—in their attempt to punish a defaulting ruler—approaches zero. The threat is, thus, insufficient to deter a ruler from confiscating goods or to encourage their expenditure of resources or political capital to defend foreign merchants against local citizens. Effective punishment that will deter rulers' bad behavior requires more extensive coordination of effectively all the merchants who provide value for the ruler. The question then becomes, what incentives do the merchants have to participate in the collective boycott? Here is the role for the Merchant Guild, an organization that has the power to punish its own members for failure to abide by a boycott announced by the guild. These insights have been built on to explore more generally the role of legal institutions in coordinating and incentivizing decentralized enforcement mechanisms like the multilateral reputation system.Gillian K.

Weingast \\"Law without the State: Legal Attributes and the Coordination of Decentralized Collective Punishment\\" Journal of Law and Courts 1 (Winter 2013) 1-23. Milgrom's contribution to the understanding of legal institutions also includes one of the early express analyses of the functioning of adjudicatory institutions. In Milgrom and Roberts (1986b) the authors explore the role of strategic revelation in an adjudicatory setting. They show that the core notion that adversarial litigation will lead to the truth is true if the parties are symmetrically informed and both have access to verifiable evidence that demonstrates the truth and so long as one of the parties prefers the decision that even a naive decisionmaker (who chooses from a set of decisions suggested by the parties) will reach under full information to the alternative under partial information. They also show, building on Milgrom (1981c) and Grossman (1981) that a decisionmaker can induce parties with less than complete information to reveal enough to ultimately result in full revelation by adopting a skeptical posture, drawing sufficiently negative inferences from weak or non-existent evidentiary showings. This early model laid the groundwork for future work on strategic information behavior in courts Shin (1998) and Daughter and Reinganum (2000) relax the symmetry assumption, for example, looking at the impact of sequential evidentiary search decisions or Bayesian inference by judges; Froeb and Kobayashi (1996) and Farmer and Pecorino (2000) investigate the role of evidentiary costs and alternative models of judicial inference; Che and Severinov (2009)Yeon-Koo Che and Sergei Severinov \\"Lawyer-advised Disclosure\\" explore a role for lawyers who are better informed about the legal significance of evidence and can advise their clients about to reveal in court. This important literature sheds light on the impact of legal rules governing discovery and attorney-client privilege as well as the function of lawyers in adjudicatory systems. =Finance and macroeconomics= Securities markets Milgrom and Stokey (1982) addressed an important question about why people trade securities and whether one can profit from speculation. The famous no-trade theorem in this paper showed that if traders have the same prior beliefs and trading motives are purely speculative, then no trading should happen. This is because all traders correctly interpret the information reflected by the equilibrium prices and expect other people to trade rationally; as a result, an uninformed trader anticipates that he would incur a loss if he traded with an informed trader so would be better off not trading. \`\`Why do traders bother to gather information if they cannot profit from it? How does information come to be reflected in prices if informed traders do not trade or if they ignore their private information in making inferences?\\" These questions, asked at the end of Milgrom and Stokey (1982), were addressed in Glosten and Milgrom (1985). In this seminal paper, the authors provided a dynamic model of the price formation process in securities markets and an information-based explanation for the spread between the bid and ask prices. Because informed traders have better information than market-makers, market-makers incur a loss when trading with informed traders. Market-makers use the bid-ask spread to recoup this loss from uninformed traders, who have private reasons for trading, for example, because of liquidity needs. This dynamic trading model with asymmetric information has been one of the workhorse models in the literature on market microstructure. Trading on stock exchanges had been growing at a growing rate in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, which led Milgrom and coauthors (Bresnahan, Milgrom and Paul 1992) to ask whether the rapid increase of trading volume also brings rapid increase of the real output of stock exchanges. Traders in this model make profit by gathering information of the value of the firm and trading its stocks. However, information valuable for making a real decision on the firm is the value added rather than the value of the firm. Their analysis suggests that the increased trading activity increased the resources devoted to rent-seeking, without improving real investment decisions. At the 2008 Nemmers Prize conference, Stephen MorrisMorris Nemmers Presentation, 2008 Retrieved July 10, 2019. provided an explanation of Milgrom's contributions to the understanding of financial markets as well as of the impact that they have had on financial analysis. Labor markets In 1987, Milgrom with Sharon Oster examined imperfections in labor markets. They evaluated the \\"Invisibility Hypothesis\\" which held that disadvantaged workers had difficult signalling their job skills to potential new employers because their existing employers denied them promotions that would improve visibility. Milgrom and Oster found that, in a competitive equilibrium, such invisibility could be profitable for firms. This led to less pay to disadvantaged workers in lower-level positions even when they otherwise had the same education and ability as their more advantaged co- workers. Not surprisingly, the returns to investing in education and human capital were reduced for those in disadvantaged groups; reinforcing discriminatory outcomes in labor markets. Two decades later, Milgrom, in a paper with Bob Hall (Hall and Milgrom, 2008), contributed to macroeconomics directly. Macroeconomic models, including real business cycle models, efficiency wage models and search/matching models, have long had difficulty accounting for the observed volatility in labor market variables. In an influential paper, Shimer explained the problem as it appears in the standard search/matching model, an important macroeconomic model for which the Nobel prize was recently granted to Diamond, Mortensen and Pissarides (DMP). Shimer explained that in the standard DMP model, a shock that raises the value of what firms sell – other things the same – increases their incentive to hire workers by raising profits per worker. The problem, according to Shimer is that this mechanism sets into motion a negative feedback loop which in the end largely cancels firms' incentive to expand employment. In particular, as employment expands, labor market conditions in general begin to improve for workers and this puts them in a stronger position as they negotiate wages with employers. But, the resulting rise in the wage then cuts into the profits earned by firms and thus limits their incentive to hire workers. The problem has come to be known as the 'Shimer puzzle'. That puzzle can loosely be paraphrased as follows: \\"what modification to the DMP framework is needed to put it in line with the empirical evidence that employment rises sharply during a business cycle expansion?\\" Although enormous efforts have been made, the puzzle has largely resisted a solution, until the Milgrom paper. Milgrom (with Hall), argued that the bargaining framework used in the standard DMP model does not correspond well to the way wages are actually negotiated. They argue that, by the time workers and firms sit down to bargain, they know that there is a substantial amount to be gained if they make a deal. The firm's human resources department has most likely already checked out the worker to verify that they are suitable. Most likely, the worker has done a similar preliminary check to verify that they could make a useful contribution to the firm. A consequence of this is that if, during the negotiations, the firm and worker disagree, they are very unlikely to simply part ways. Instead, it is more likely that they continue negotiating until they do reach agreement. It follows that as they make proposals and counterproposals, bargaining worker/firm pairs are mindful of the various costs associated with delay and the making of counterproposals. They are not so concerned about the consequences of a total breakdown in negotiations and of having to go back to the general labor market to search for another worker or job. Milgrom stresses that with this shift in perspective on bargaining, the impact of improved general conditions on the wage bargain is weakened as long as costs of delay and renegotiation are not very sensitive to broader economic conditions. In particular, the approach provides a potential resolution to the Shimer puzzle, a puzzle that has confounded macroeconomists generally. Policy =FCC Spectrum Auction 1993= The U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has responsibility for allocating licenses for the use of electromagnetic spectrum to television broadcasters, mobile wireless services providers, satellite service providers, and others. Prior to 1993, the FCC's authorization from the U.S. Congress only allowed it to allocate licenses through an administrative process referred to as \\"comparative hearings\\" or by holding a lottery. Comparative hearings were extremely time-consuming and costly, and there were concerns about the ability of such a process to identify the 'best' owners for licenses. Lotteries were fast, but clearly a random allocation of licenses left much to be desired in terms of efficiency. Neither of these methods offered any ability for the FCC to capture some of the value of the spectrum licenses for the U.S. taxpayers. Then in 1993, Congress authorized the FCC to hold auctions to allocate spectrum licenses. Auctions offered great potential in terms of obtaining an efficient allocation of licenses and also capturing some of the value of the licenses to be returned to the U.S. taxpayers. However, the FCC was directed to hold the auction within a year, and at that time no suitable auction design existed, either in theory or in practice. It was Milgrom, together with other economists including Robert Wilson, Preston McAfee, and John McMillan, who played a key role in designing the simultaneous multiple round auction that was adopted and implemented by the FCC. Milgrom's auction theory research provided foundations that guided economists' thinking on auction design and ultimately the FCC's auction design choices. The FCC needed an auction design suited to the sale of multiple licenses with potentially highly interdependent values. The FCC's goals included economic efficiency and revenue (although the legislation suggests an emphasis on efficiency over revenue) as well as operational simplicity and reasonable speed. According to FCC economist Evan Kwerel, who was given the task of developing the FCCís auction design, Milgrom's proposals, analysis, and research were hugely influential in the auction design. Milgrom and Wilson proposed a simultaneous ascending bid auction with discrete bidding rounds, which \\"promised to provide much of the operational simplicity of sealed-bid auctions with the economic efficiency of an ascending auction.\\"Kwerel, Evan (2004), 'Foreword' in Paul Milgrom's Putting Auction Theory to Work,New York: Cambridge University Press, p.xviii. Milgrom argued successfully for a simultaneous closing rule, as opposed to a market-by-market closing rule advocated by others because the latter might foreclose efficient backup strategies.Kwerel, 2004, op.cit., p.xix. Describing the Milgrom-Wilson auction design, Kwerel states: > It seemed to provide bidders sufficient information and flexibility to > pursue backup strategies to promote a reasonably efficient assignment of > licenses, without so much complexity that the FCC could not successfully > implement it and bidders could not understand it. Just having a good idea, > though, is not enough. Good ideas need good advocates if they are to be > adopted. No advocate was more persuasive than Paul Milgrom.

Milgrom's proposed design was adopted in large part by the commission. Called the simultaneous multiple round (SMR) auction, this design introduced several new features, mostly importantly an \\"activity rule\\" to ensure active bidding. Milgrom and Weber developed an activity rule to accompany their simultaneous closing rule to ensure that bidders could not hold back while observing the bids of others. The activity rule required that bidders maintain a certain level of activity, either by being the current high bidder or by submitting a new bid, in each round or else forfeit all or part of its eligibility to submit bids in future rounds. \\"Milgrom and Weber developed this insight into the activity rule that the FCC has used in all its simultaneous multiple round auctions. The Milgrom-Wilson activity rule was an elegant, novel solution to a difficult practical auction design issue.\\"Kwerel, op.cit.,2004, p.xx. Activity rules are now a nearly universal feature in dynamic multi-item auctions. Milgrom's singular role in creating the FCC design is celebrated in an account by the US National Science Foundation (America's Investment in the Future), which identifies this auction design as one of the main practical contributions of 20th century research in microeconomic theory. The same invention and Milgrom's role in creating it was celebrated again by the prestigious National Academy of Sciences (Beyond Discovery), which is the main scientific advisor to the US government. The SMR design has been copied and adapted worldwide for auctions of radio spectrum, electricity, natural gas, etc. involving hundreds of billion dollars. In the words of Evan Kwerel, \\"In the end, the FCC chose an ascending bid mechanism, largely because we believed that providing bidders with more information would likely increase efficiency and, as shown by Milgrom and Weber (1982), mitigate the winner's curse.\\"Kwerel, op.cit.,2004, p.xvii. The result alluded to by Kwerel is known as the Linkage principle and was developed by Milgrom and Weber (1982). (Milgrom (2004) recasts the linkage principle as the 'publicity effect.') It provided a theoretical foundation for the intuition driving the major design choice by the FCC between an ascending bid and sealed bid auction. =FCC Incentive Auctions= In 2012, the US Congress authorized the FCC to conduct the first spectrum incentive auctions.http://www.fcc.gov/incentiveauctions As envisioned by the FCC, the incentive auctions will enable television broadcast stations to submit bids to relinquish existing spectrum rights. Broadcast stations that opt to stay on-air will be reassigned to channels in a way that frees up a contiguous block of spectrum to be repurposed for wireless broadband, with licenses sold to telecommunications firms. Relative to prior spectrum auctions run in the United States and around the world, the incentive auctions will have the novel feature that they are a double auction: the proceeds from selling wireless broadband licenses will be used to compensate broadcasters who relinquish rights, or who must be re-located to new channels. Any further revenue will go to the Treasury. Subsequent to receiving Congressional authorization, the FCC announced in March 2012 that Milgrom had been retained to lead a team of economists advising the FCC on the design of the incentive auctions.Leading Auction Experts to Advise FCC on Incentive Auctions Federal Communications Commission. March 27, 2012. Retrieved July 11, 2019. In September 2012, the FCC released Milgrom's preliminary report on the possible auction design. Teaching Milgrom has taught a variety of courses in Economics. In the 1990s, he has developed a popular undergraduate course on The Modern Firm in Theory and Practice, based on his 1992 book with John Roberts. In the early 2000s, together with Alvin E. Roth, Milgrom taught the first graduate course on Market Design, which brought together topics on auctions, matching, and other related areas. The market design course has served as a basis for many similar graduate courses across the US and around the world, and has helped jump-start the field of Market Design. In his teaching, Milgrom was always cognisant of what economic models could and could not do. He stressed the assumptions that made them useful in generating robust empirical predictions as well as the core assumptions upon which those predictions relied. This philosophy is perhaps exemplified in this reflect on the assumption of rational choice (with Jonathan Levin).Levin, Jonathan; Milgrom, Paul \\"Introduction to Choice Theory\\", June 2004. > ... it is worth emphasizing that despite the shortcomings of the rational > choice model, it remains a remarkably powerful tool for policy analysis. To > see why, imagine conducting a welfare analysis of alternative policies. > Under the rational choice approach, one would begin by specifying the > relevant preferences over economic outcomes (e.g. everyone likes to consume > more, some people might not like inequality, and so on), then model the > allocation of resources under alternative policies and finally compare > policies by looking at preferences over the alternative outcomes. > Many of the \\"objectionable\\" simplifying features of the rational choice > model combine to make such an analysis feasible.

Business Milgrom has been involved for at least two decades in the design and practice of large-scale auctions. Working with Bob Wilson on behalf of Pacific Bell, he proposed the simultaneous multiple round auction that was adopted by the FCC to run the initial auctions for radio spectrum in the 1990s. He has also advised regulators in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, Germany, Sweden and Mexico on spectrum auctions, Microsoft on search advertising auctions and Google on the auction at the basis of their IPO. In 2006, along with Jeremy Bulow and Jonathan Levin, Milgrom advised Comcast in bidding on FCC Auction 66 including a rarely successfully implemented \\"jump bid.\\"Bulow, J., J. Levin and P. Milgrom (2009), \\"Winning Play in Spectrum Auctions\\", mimeo., Stanford. In the words of the Economist: > In the run-up to an online auction in 2006 of radio-spectrum licences by > America's Federal Communications Commission, Paul Milgrom, a consultant and > Stanford University professor, customised his game-theory software to assist > a consortium of bidders. The result was a triumph. > When the auction began, Dr Milgrom's software tracked competitors' bids to > estimate their budgets for the 1,132 licences on offer.

It directed Dr > Milgrom's clients to obtain a patchwork of smaller, less expensive licences > instead. Two of his clients, Time Warner and Comcast, paid about a third > less than their competitors for equivalent spectrum, saving almost $1.2 > billion. In 2007, Milgrom co-founded Auctionomics,Auctionomics Website with Silvia Console Battilana,http://www.stanford.edu/~silviacb/ to design auctions and advise bidders in different industries. In 2009, Milgrom was responsible for the development of assignment auctions and exchanges.Milgrom, P. (2009), \\"Assignment Messages and Exchange.\\" This was a mechanism that allowed for arbitrage possibilities and retained some of the flexibility of the simultaneous ascending bid auction but could be achieved instantaneously. The speed was an important attribute along with the potential to extend the auction design to consider bidding with non-price attributes. In 2011, the FCC hired Auctionomics to tackle one of the most complex auction problems ever, the incentive auction. FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski said, :I am delighted to have this world-class team of experts advising the Commission on this historic undertaking. Our plan is to ensure that incentive auctions serve as an effective market mechanism to unleash more spectrum for mobile broadband and help address the looming spectrum crunch. Our implementation of this new Congressional mandate will be guided by the economics, and will seek to maximize the opportunity to unleash investment and innovation, benefit consumers, drive economic growth, and enhance our global competitiveness. The knowledge and experience of this team will complement the substantial expertise of agency staff to meet these goals. In 2012, Auctionomics and Power Auctions were hired to design the FCC's first Incentive Auction, with the goal of creating a market for repurposing television broadcast spectrum to wireless broadband. The design team was led by Milgrom and includes Larry Ausubel, Kevin Leyton-Brown, Jon Levin and Ilya Segal. Over the years, Milgrom has been active as an innovator and has been awarded four patents relating to auction design.Patents Issued to Paul Milgrom Publications (selected) * (Ph.D. Dissertation)                 References External links  1948 births 21st-century American economists Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences fellows Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Fellows of the Econometric Society Financial economists Game theorists Information economists Jewish American social scientists Jewish Nobel laureates Mathematical economists Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Living people Stanford University alumni Stanford University Department of Economics faculty University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts alumni Nobel laureates in Economics ","title":"Paul Milgrom"},{"id":"1195169","text":"\\"The Empath\\" is the twelfth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek. Written by Joyce Muskat and directed by John Erman, it was first broadcast on December 6, 1968. In the episode, while visiting a doomed planet, the landing party is subjected to torturous experiments by powerful aliens. This episode is one of a handful not screened in the United Kingdom by the BBC for many years, owing to its disturbing content (torture). It was not broadcast by the BBC until January 1994.https://www.metv.com/lists/5-original-star-trek-episodes-that-were- banned-overseas Plot The starship USS Enterprise arrives at Minara II to recover research personnel as its star is about to go supernova. Captain Kirk, Dr. McCoy, and Science Officer Spock beam to the surface but find the research station deserted. Chief Engineer Scott moves Enterprise to a safe distance to protect it from being bombarded by a solar flare. The landing party is suddenly transported into an underground chamber and discover that they are trapped along with a beautiful mute woman, whom McCoy names \\"Gem\\". The landing party is attacked by two aliens, Lal and Thann, from a race of humanoid beings known as Vians, who proceed to injure Kirk. Gem proves she is an empath by absorbing Kirk's injuries, briefly taking them on herself before they are healed. They search the nearby chambers and find machinery and computer systems, along with transparent cylinders, some containing the missing research personnel in grotesque poses, and three empty ones labeled with the landing party's names. Lal arrives, but Spock subdues him with a Vulcan nerve pinch and allows the group to escape to the surface. They are surprised to see Scott and a landing party waiting for them, but soon discover they are only a mirage. The Vians arrive and transport Gem and Kirk back into the underground complex, where they begin torturing Kirk with Gem only able to watch. During this, the aliens explain that they had tested the research personnel (Linke and Ozaba) similarly, but both men died from their fears. Gem and a badly injured Kirk are transported back to where McCoy and Spock are held, and Gem heals Kirk's wounds, but only after McCoy urges her to do so. The Vians demand another test subject, and McCoy sedates both Kirk and Spock to make the Vians choose him. When Kirk and Spock awaken, they understand from Gem what McCoy has done and make their escape to find McCoy near death at the medical chamber after being subjected to the Vians' tests. Kirk and Spock attempt to help McCoy but are stopped by the Vians' use of a force field. They can only stand by and watch as Gem attempts to absorb McCoy's wounds, though she seems afraid to take the entirety of them upon herself. The Vians then explain that this has all been a test for Gem as a representative of her people in this solar system. They have been trying to judge if Gem was willing to sacrifice her life for that of another; if she passed the test, the Vians would use their advanced technology to save the rest of Gem's people from the pending supernova. Gem attempts again to absorb McCoy's wounds but he pushes her away, not wanting her to die. Spock observes the force field reacts to resistant force, and theorizes that total calm would dissipate the field, allowing them the opportunity to overtake the Vians. Kirk insists to the Vians that Gem has proven her choice is to sacrifice herself, and furthermore accuses the aliens of lacking compassion. The Vians realize their error, and agree that Gem has passed the test. They return Gem and McCoy to full health, and promise to save Gem's people. The Vians and Gem disappear. Kirk, Spock and McCoy return to the Enterprise safely. After hearing the trio discussing the probability of meeting a woman like Gem, Scott comments that she must have been a \\"pearl of great price\\" and they agree. Production =Writing and conception= Star Trek fan Joyce Muskat, fresh out of UC Berkeley, was working as a newspaper reporter when she wrote her first television script, \\"The Answerer\\". It was inspired by the 1933 science fiction novel When Worlds Collide, and also by an ancient Egyptian custom of inviting a person to speak on behalf of another who was being judged. Muskat was also working at a local theater, and wanted her story to be shot on a bare, surreal set, like a stage play that focused on the characters. Her theater employer, playwright and screenwriter Robert Fisher, liked the script and, acting as her agent, submitted it. Star Trek producers Gene Roddenberry, Fred Freiberger and Robert Justman all thought it had promise, but agreed there would have to be some changes. Muskat reworked the script based on their input. Freiberger, Justman and Story consultant Arthur Singer made further changes and Singer also gave the story a new title, \\"The Empath\\". Since Muskat was not a member of the Writers Guild, Star Trek would be saving money, which was becoming very tight. =Direction and casting= Star Trek associate producer Robert Justman had worked on an episode of The Outer Limits called \\"Nightmare\\", which also dealt with men being brutally interrogated by aliens on a minimalistic set. The episode was directed by John Erman, and Justman hired him for \\"The Empath\\", given their similar themes. Erman in turn hired a few actors he had previously worked with. He remembered Kathryn Hays from his time as a casting director, and recommended her for the part of Gem. She had also impressed Gene Roddenberry in an episode of Naked City that he had written. The actors who played the Vians (Lal and Thann) were friends of Erman. Willard Sage (Thann) had also worked on the Outer Limits episode. Alan Bergmann played the main Vian, Lal. He was reluctant at first, as the part sounded limited and he didn't like the idea of wearing grotesque makeup, but Erman eventually persuaded him, and promised to expand his role. =Filming= Filming began on Thursday, July 25th 1968. There was a delay due to Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley being unhappy with elements of the script, and various injuries and illnesses including Kelley suffering a back spasm. The scenes on the surface of the planet were filmed first, then the cast and crew moved to Paramount's giant Marathon stage 1, dressed as the surrealistic underground chamber. Guest star Kathryn Hays recalled, \\"A cyclorama went around the entire studio set right up against the walls and that, along with the floors and ceilings, was painted black, so it looked like we were out in space.\\" Filming finished on Friday, August 2nd, one full day behind due to the problems at the start of the shoot. This was to be cinematographer Jerry Finnerman's last Star Trek episode; he had been with the show since the first episode. This was also the only Star Trek assignment for director John Erman. He did not enjoy the experience, due to Shatner and Nimoy wishing to direct themselves. Erman later said, \\"Nobody was like Bill and Lenny. I don't remember any other actors saying what those guys said, which was, 'Oh no, my character just wouldn't do that.' That was the ultimate put down for a director.\\" Guest star Alan Bergmann recalled, \\"Mr. Shatner and Mr. Nimoy seemed to be in conflict. They struggled over better camera positions and made life difficult for the director.\\" =Music= \\"The Empath\\" has a distinctive music score, composed by George Duning. His use of the Yamaha organ was, according to the composer himself, the first time that the electronic instrument (newly arrived from Japan) was featured in a Hollywood film score. The enchanting theme for Gem was used in many subsequent episodes during tender, romantic scenes.Star Trek Volume Two: newly recorded music from selected episodes of the Paramount TV series (1986 album); sleeve notes by Fred Steiner. Reception =Broadcast= \\"The Empath\\" was broadcast on NBC at 10pm on Friday, December 6th 1968, and was the second most-watched season three episode (after the season opener, \\"Spock's Brain\\"), with 34% of the audience share. It was not repeated on NBC in summer 1969 because the torture scenes were considered too graphic for the earlier time slot. In the UK, the BBC decided to cancel the scheduled 16 December 1970 screening of the episode (it was listed in the Radio Times), following the screening of \\"Miri\\" two weeks previously, which had received a number of complaints from viewers. This caused the BBC to look at Star Trek more closely, resulting in the banning of both episodes along with \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\" and \\"Whom Gods Destroy\\". Fans writing to the BBC prior to another repeat run in 1984 received this reply: \\"There are no plans to screen the four episodes because we feel that they deal most unpleasantly with the already unpleasant subjects of madness, torture, sadism and disease.\\" The episodes were not screened by the BBC until the 1990s.http://space-doubt.blogspot.com/2014/10/star-trek-on-bbc-1970.html =Cast and crew response= This was one of DeForest Kelley's favourite episodes. He said, \\"I thought it was so dramatically done. The entire stage was blacked out in black curtains, and everything was done in 'pen spots'. It was so unique in production values and the cinematography on it.\\" Guest star Kathryn Hays recalled in an interview, \\"I’ve often thought that was an interesting role for me to play. I loved playing that. It was technically very interesting. That show was fascinating to work on from a technical point of view. It was so different from a regular show.\\"https://www.welovesoaps.net/2010/10/hays2.html Guest star Alan Bergmann said, \\"Given the minimal sets and the ludicrous pajama-like costumes of the regulars, the episode was quite successful in text and production.\\" Writer Joyce Muskat said, \\"When I saw it, there were a lot of changes. But the storyline of Gem learning something is the same, and the idea of the stark setting and four characters interacting was still there. So I couldn't find fault with it. I was very satisfied.\\" =Critical response= In 2015, Polygon ranked \\"The Empath\\" as one of the three best Spock-centric episodes of Star Trek. They praised the episode for its moralistic conclusion and what they call the best acting performance by Nimoy, who plays Spock. A 2018 Star Trek binge-watching guide by Den of Geek, recommended this episode for featuring the trio of characters Kirk, Spock, and Bones of the original series.

There are legal differences between a bareboat charter and other types of charter arrangements, commonly called time or voyage charters. In a voyage or time charter, the charterer charters the ship (or part of it) for a particular voyage or for a set period of time. In these charters, the charterer can direct where the ship will go but the owner of the ship retains possession of the ship through its employment of the master and crew. In a bare-boat or demise charter, on the other hand, the owner gives possession of the ship to the charterer and the charterer hires its own master and crew. The bare-boat charterer is sometimes called a \\"disponent owner\\". The giving up of possession of the ship by the owner is the defining characteristic of a bareboat or demise charter.  In shipping  In a bareboat charter, no administration or technical maintenance is included as part of the agreement. The charterer obtains possession and full control of the vessel along with the legal and financial responsibility for it. The charterer pays for all operating expenses, including fuel, crew, port expenses and P&I; and hull insurance. A bareboat charter is in effect a financing arrangement. It is generally considered a lease contract, specifically a finance lease, for accounting purposes, under both international financial reporting standards (IFRS 16) and US accounting standards.  In yachting  In yachting a bareboat charter is usually for a short period. There are hundreds of bareboat yacht charter brokers or agent companies. These companies offer yacht finding and travel organisation services similar to travel agent only more specialized. Their purpose is to use their experience and networks to locate a client's ideal bareboat in terms of price and location. Much like online travel agencies that sell unsold inventory of airline tickets and hotel rooms at a fraction of the price, there are now also last minute bareboat charter brokers where travellers can find excellent rates. While bareboat technically refers to any boat that can be chartered without a skipper or crew, typically bareboating refers to sailing yachts, including catamarans. Bareboat hire has become increasingly common since the mid-1990s and in particular since the early 2000s. There has been increasing demand for yacht vacations and many experienced and semi- experienced ‘yachties’ now consider it easier and cheaper to hire a bareboat, rather than own their own yacht. While both the international leisure travel industry (particularly outdoor activities based vacations) and the boating industry have boomed in the last decade, so too has the bareboat charter industry which incorporates both of these pursuits. In the USA there is an additional legal distinction with regard to bareboat versus for hire, or \\"skippered\\" charters. When persons pool their finances to bareboat so that the qualified master among them may skipper for the group, even though the master is not ostensibly a paid skipper, he/she now takes on the legal responsibilities of one. This can have far-reaching consequences in the event of negative occurrences at sea.

After moving from Perthshire to Birmingham to set up business as a draper, McGregor became involved with local football club Aston Villa, which he helped to establish as one of the leading teams in England. He served the club for over 20 years in various capacities, including president, director and chairman. In 1888, frustrated by the regular cancellation of Villa's matches, McGregor organised a meeting of representatives of England's leading clubs, which led to the formation of the Football League, giving member clubs a guaranteed fixture list each season. This was instrumental in the transition of football from an amateur pastime to a professional business. McGregor served as both chairman and president of the Football League and was also chairman of The Football Association (the FA). He was recognised by the FA for his service to the game shortly before his death in 1911, and was posthumously honoured by the local football authorities and Aston Villa. Personal life Born in Braco in Perthshire, Scotland, McGregor first became interested in football after watching a match between locals and visiting artisans at Ardoch. He served an apprenticeship as a draper in Perth, and in 1870, following the example of his brother Peter, moved to Birmingham, and opened his own drapery business in Aston, an area just outside the city. Upon his arrival in the English Midlands he became involved with a local football club, Calthorpe, which had been formed by a fellow Scot, Campbell Orr. (accessible with a UK library card) McGregor was enthusiastic enough about the game to arrange for his shop to close early on Saturdays to allow him to watch matches, and he later sold football kits at the shop, which became a popular meeting place for football enthusiasts. McGregor was married to Jessie, and the couple had a daughter and a son, also named Jessie and William. A teetotaller, McGregor was a supporter of the Temperance movement, and was active in the local branch of the Liberal Party until his membership lapsed in 1882 due to the increasing amount of time he devoted to football. He was involved in the early attempts to establish a baseball league in the United Kingdom, and served as the honorary treasurer of the Baseball Association of Great Britain and Ireland. Despite his commitment to sport, he held desperately on to his drapery business throughout his life. McGregor was a committed Christian who was widely respected for his honesty and integrity. He worshipped for forty years at the Congregational church in Wheeler Street, Aston. His pastor, the Revd. W.G. Percival said that the best thing about him \\"was not so much the genial, kindly, honest sportsman, but the Christian behind it all\\". He described him as \\"a man of absolutely unblemished personal character\\".

Almost all of the men sport moustaches. Displayed in the centre of the group are two large trophies. In 1877, McGregor was invited to become a committee member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested in joining Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president. The following year McGregor became a member of the club's board of directors. Villa's standing within the game continued to grow, and, in 1887, the club became the first from the Midlands to win the FA Cup, defeating local rivals West Bromwich Albion in the final. In 1895, McGregor became vice-chairman, and went on to become the club's chairman in 1897. During his time at the club he was noted for his organisational skills and ambition, and was responsible for adopting the lion rampant depicted on the Royal Standard of Scotland, as the club's crest. Founder of the Football League As the 1880s progressed, the balance of power within English football began to change. The first national competition, the FA Cup, had previously been dominated by amateur clubs from privileged backgrounds, such as Wanderers and Old Etonians. However the 1883 FA Cup Final saw the first victory by a working-class team, Blackburn Olympic. At this time professionalism was not permitted. Clubs from urban areas in the north were strong advocates of the practice, but the southern amateur teams and the FA authorities were firmly opposed. Though not initially an advocate of professionalism, McGregor came to favour its introduction. By 1885 the issue threatened to split the FA when a group of clubs, predominantly from Lancashire, announced their intention to leave and form a rival British Football Association if professionalism was not accepted. An emergency FA conference was called in response. Representing Aston Villa, McGregor spoke in favour of professionalism, the only delegate from the Midlands to do so, and was one of the few delegates to admit that his club had been paying players. Though not as outspoken as stronger proponents, such as Preston North End's William Sudell, McGregor was well respected. The conference ended with the FA accepting professionalism, although each club was permitted only to pay players who had been born or lived for at least two years within six miles of its home stadium. Professionalism brought fresh complications for club administrators. Many friendlies were cancelled due to opponents' FA Cup or county cup matches taking precedence or clubs simply failing to honour a fixture in favour of a more lucrative match elsewhere. This made it hard for the clubs to pay players' wages on a regular basis. McGregor took action after seeing Villa matches cancelled, to the increasing frustration of the club's fans, on five consecutive Saturdays. On 1888, he wrote to the committee of his own club, Aston Villa, as well as to those of Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End and West Bromwich Albion, suggesting the creation of a league competition that would provide a number of guaranteed fixtures for its member clubs each season. Corinthian F.C. founder Nicholas Lane Jackson, writing in 1899, stated that McGregor took his inspiration from the existing league set-up used in American baseball, although McGregor himself cited the County Cricket Championship as his inspiration. McGregor's letter to the clubs read: > Every year it is becoming more and more difficult for football clubs of any > standing to meet their friendly engagements and even arrange friendly > matches. The consequence is that at the last moment, through cup-tie > interference, clubs are compelled to take on teams who will not attract the > public. > I beg to tender the following suggestion as a means of getting over the > difficulty: that ten or twelve of the most prominent clubs in England > combine to arrange home-and-away fixtures each season, the said fixtures to > be arranged at a friendly conference about the same time as the > International Conference. > This combination might be known as the Association Football Union, and > could be managed by representative from each club. Of course, this is in no > way to interfere with the National Association; even the suggested matches > might be played under cup-tie rules. However, this is a detail. > My object in writing to you at present is merely to draw your attention to > the subject, and to suggest a friendly conference to discuss the matter more > fully. I would take it as a favour if you would kindly think the matter > over, and make whatever suggestions you deem necessary. I am only writing to > the following – Blackburn Rovers, Bolton Wanderers, Preston North End, West > Bromwich Albion, and Aston Villa, and would like to hear what other clubs > you would suggest. > I am, yours very truly, William McGregor (Aston Villa F.C.) > P.S. How would Friday, 23 March 1888, suit for the friendly conference at > Anderton's Hotel, London? McGregor chose 23 March as the date of his proposed meeting because it was the day before the FA Cup final and representatives of the country's top clubs would be in London. Representatives from ten clubs attended, including the FA Cup finalists West Bromwich Albion and Preston North End, but it quickly became clear that clubs from the South of England were not interested in McGregor's proposal and none attended. A second meeting was held in Manchester on , and details concerning the new competition were finalised. McGregor's suggested name for the competition, \\"The Association Football Union\\" was rejected as too similar to that of the Rugby Football Union and \\"The Football League\\" was chosen, despite McGregor's opposition on the grounds that he felt it might invoke associations with the unpopular Irish Land League. The term English League was avoided, to leave the possibility of future applications from Scottish clubs. McGregor also proposed a rule that only one club from each town should be included. The other founders agreed to this rule, which caused controversy, as it meant Birmingham team Mitchell St. George's were denied membership in favour of McGregor's Aston Villa. Twelve clubs kicked off the first season of League football in September 1888. John Bentley, McGregor's successor as Football League president, criticised McGregor for his failure to attend many meetings during his later spell as League presidentalt=A head and shoulders view of a man with thinning hair and a moustache. He is wearing a suit jacket and tie. McGregor served as the first chairman of the League's Management Committee. One of the committee's main jobs was handling issues of discipline, but committee members were not barred from involvement in decisions involving their own clubs. In fact, the first disciplinary meeting saw fines issued to three of the four clubs with representatives on the committee. McGregor was re-elected unopposed in 1891. Earlier he had spoken of his pleasure that \\"of the 132 matches in which the League clubs have taken part and in which about 300 players have taken the field, not a single fatal accident has to be recorded\\". A year later he oversaw the expansion of the Football League into two divisions when the rival Football Alliance was merged into the competition, but he relinquished his post later that year due to ill health, which caused him to miss meetings. After stepping down as chairman, he was unanimously elected to an honorary position of president, a role he kept until 1894, and was named the first-ever life member of the League in 1895. The role was that of a figurehead with little actual authority, but he was used as a mediator to resolve league disagreements. In the second half of the decade McGregor's failure to attend many committee meetings led to criticism from John Bentley, his successor as president. Bentley's criticism achieved the desired effect; from 1899 until his health deteriorated in 1910, McGregor seldom missed a meeting. During this period McGregor was noted for his reserved nature. He was silent for large parts of committee meetings, but would contribute enthusiastically on the occasions he felt his input was necessary. Other football activities Between 1888 and 1894 McGregor also served as chairman of The Football Association (the FA), English football's overall governing body, which had existed since 1863. He became known as a football celebrity, writing a weekly column for the Birmingham Gazette and endorsing products such as footballs, and a type of football boot which the manufacturer billed as the \\"McGregor lace-to-toe boot\\". Though he held many different administrative posts in his lifetime, McGregor never played the sport competitively; his only on-pitch involvement was occasional goalkeeping during Aston Villa practices in the 1870s. Death and legacy The statue of McGregor outside alt=A bronze statue of a man with a large beard, wearing a long coat, leaning on a walking stick, and holding some papers Although McGregor envisaged the League as a friendly union, within which clubs would share ticket revenues and work together in their mutual best interests, the immediate effect of its creation was that football came to be treated as a business for the first time, as opposed to something that players and officials simply regarded as a pastime. All the clubs involved experienced significant increases in their turnover, which at Aston Villa, McGregor's own club, increased more than sixfold between 1889 and 1899. The wages paid to players, however, remained low due to restrictions imposed by the FA, so clubs were able to use their increased profitability to build larger stadiums and accommodate ever larger crowds of spectators. Although the League initially contained a small number of clubs, all of which were based in the northern half of the country, by the early years of the twentieth century it included clubs from all parts of England. At its peak nearly 100 clubs played in the Football League, and it remained the pre- eminent competition in English football until the 1990s, when the top clubs broke away to form the Premier League. In keeping with McGregor's views on mutual support and co-operation, gate receipts were shared amongst the clubs until the 1980s, which helped to ensure that a select few wealthy clubs were not able to dominate the competition. McGregor himself had little interest in the business aspect of football, and was adamant that the Football League should not challenge the longstanding authority of the FA. The success of the Football League directly inspired the creation of similar competitions in other countries, beginning with Scotland, where the Scottish Football League was formed in 1890. In May 1910, McGregor was taken ill and later confined to a nursing home. His condition worsened towards the end of 1911. His last public appearance was a committee meeting on , and he underwent an operation on . However, after a brief improvement in his condition he relapsed and died the following day. Although a devout Congregationalist, he is buried in the grounds of a Church of England church, St. Mary's, in the Handsworth district of Birmingham, alongside his wife, who died in 1908. McGregor is remembered as the \\"father of The Football League\\", an Aston Villa legend, and a legend of football in general. Shortly before his death, the FA presented McGregor, who was at that time a vice-president of the association, with a long service medal. After his death, Aston Villa dedicated a bed in the children's ward of one of Birmingham's hospitals in his honour, and the Birmingham County Football Association unveiled a commemorative drinking fountain, which is now preserved at Villa Park, current home of his former club. In the modern era, Aston Villa selected him as one of the twelve inaugural members of its Hall of Fame, and named a hospitality suite at Villa Park after him. In 2008, the Aston Villa Supporters' Trust announced plans to further honour him with a bronze statue outside the stadium. The statue, by sculptor Sam Holland, is displayed outside the Directors' Entrance of the Trinity Road Stand, and was unveiled on 2009. The Trust also raised £1,000 to restore and rededicate McGregor's grave in 2011. Notes *A. In the 1870s the concept of the referee had not been introduced to football.

He was a co-founder of the Balalaika and Domra Association of America.  Biography  Born in Chester, Pennsylvania, Wolownik grew up with Russian and Ukrainian music. As a child and young adult, he participated in the balalaika orchestra at St. Nicholas's Russian Orthodox Church in Philadelphia under the tutelage of Paul Kauriga of the Kovriga Balalaika Orchestra. He also played under Anastasia Karnow. Wolownik received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania, where he founded the University of Pennsylvania Balalaika Orchestra (commonly known as \\"PennBO\\" or \\"Penn Balalaika Orchestra\\") in 1964. PennBO was unique in that, with the exception of the Tamburitzans at Pittsburgh's Duquesne University, it was the only university-level music ensemble dedicated solely to Eastern European music. Wolownik at Home He later moved to Los Angeles, where he received a master's degree in ethnomusicology from the University of California, Los Angeles. While there, he founded another balalaika group, the Odessa Balalaikas. Later, he founded balalaika groups in Houston and Atlanta. After returning to Philadelphia from Los Angeles, Wolownik received a master's degree in library science from Drexel University, whereupon he worked as a reference librarian at the Lippincott Library of the Wharton School. He also co-founded two more balalaika ensembles, The Balalaika Russe and The Gypsy Balalaikas, the members of both of which were from the Philadelphia area. Wolownik also continued directing the Penn Balalaika Orchestra until its demise in 1996. He later moved to Mount Laurel, New Jersey, where he was an assistant library director at the Mount Laurel Public Library until his death in 2000. Wolownik is buried in Lawn Croft Cemetery in Linwood, Pennsylvania, in the shadow of his boyhood home.  Influence  Wolownik is largely credited with reviving interest in the cabaret-style balalaika ensemble in the United States and reconnecting the balalaika and domra with their peasant roots. Popular in the 1910s and 1920s, the cabaret-style ensemble usually had no more than 10 members and played in small, intimate settings, often performing pieces which were not precisely Russian in appellation, but perhaps more Gypsy, Jewish, or Ukrainian in origin. The cabaret-style ensemble fell into disfavor with the rise of Communism, as Soviet government preferred huge Andreyev-style state-run ensembles with elaborate orchestral arrangements as sort of an antipode to the Western orchestra. Wolownik, having established balalaika societies and groups in Atlanta, Maine, and Pennsylvania, was well known in the balalaika community in the United States and abroad for his simple yet deep arrangements of tunes for small balalaika ensembles. In keeping with the cabaret tradition, Wolownik did not limit himself strictly to Russian music, but also arranged Romanian, Hungarian, Moldavian, Gypsy, and klezmer tunes, some of which had never been played on anything other than the native instruments for which they were composed. Despite his commitment to serious musicianship, some have claimed that Wolownik, who had an irreverent sense of humor, was a living embodiment of the skomorokhi of old Russia, street musicians who actively poked fun at both the Tsars and the Church. The Balalaika and Domra Association of America now numbers several hundred members. It is actively involved in promoting traditional Russian music in the United States. It holds a yearly convention in which luminaries of Russian music participate by teaching and performing.

He received a PhD from Princeton University. He is one of the main representatives of constructivism in international relations. Central to his work is the conceptualization of language as action. Language is closely related to norms and rules that produce inter-subjective meanings that allow players in international relations to act socially (i.e. in relation to others). History Kratochwil was born in Lundenburg (former Czechoslovakia). After graduating in 1963 from the humanistic Maximiliansgymnasium in Munich, he studied philosophy, history and political science at the Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität. He received in 1969 his university degree (M.A.) in International Relations from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C.. In 1976, he received his doctorate (Ph.D.) from Princeton University in political science with a focus on international relations. Kratochwil taught at American universities in Princeton, Columbia, Pennsylvania and at the European University Institute in Florence. Until 2003, Friedrich Kratochwil was Professor of International Politics at the Geschwister Scholl Institute of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich. One of his famous books is Rules, Norms and Decisions (1989), introducing constructivism to the discipline, a landmark study in the discipline of international relations. He has been the editor of the European Journal of International Relations and member of the editorial boards of several journals, including the Journal of International Relations of the Asia- Pacific, International Studies Quarterly, International Organization, World Politics, and member of the editorial advisory board of Millennium: Journal of International Studies.

For example, the beneficiary of a life insurance policy is the person who receives the payment of the amount of insurance after the death of the insured. Most beneficiaries may be designed to designate where the assets will go when the owner(s) dies. However, if the primary beneficiary or beneficiaries are not alive or do not qualify under the restrictions, the assets will probably pass to the contingent beneficiaries. Other restrictions such as being married or more creative ones can be used by a benefactor to attempt to control the behavior of the beneficiaries. Some situations such as retirement accounts do not allow any restrictions beyond death of the primary beneficiaries, but trusts allow any restrictions that are not illegal or for an illegal purpose. The concept of a \\"beneficiary\\" will also frequently figure in contracts other than insurance policies. A third-party beneficiary of a contract is a person whom the parties intend to benefit from its provisions but who is not a party to the contract. A software distributor, for example, may seek provisions protecting its customers from infringement claims. A software licensor may include in its agreements provisions that protect those who provided code to that licensor. In the context of development aid, the term \\"beneficiaries\\" refer to the persons and the communities that use the project outputs: the entities that development-aid projects.

Reverberation chambers tend to be large rooms (the resulting sound field becomes more diffused with increased path length) and have very hard exposed surfaces. The change of impedance (compared to the air) these surfaces present to incident sound is so large that virtually all of the acoustic energy that hits a surface is reflected back into the room. Arranging the room surfaces (including the ceiling) to be non-parallel helps inhibit the formation of standing waves - additional acoustic diffusers are often used to create more reflecting surfaces and further encourage even distribution of any particular sound field. Reverberation chambers are used in acoustics as well as in electrodynamics, such as for measurement microphone calibration, measurement of the sound power of a source, and measurement of the absorption coefficient of a material. All these techniques assume the sound field in the chamber to be diffuse, and will normally use a broadband sound source (e.g. white noise or pink noise) so that the resulting sound field contains acoustic energy across the whole audible range.

Hadley Memorial Bridge, is one of the Interstate 90 floating bridges. It is the fifth-longest floating bridge in the world, at 5,811 feet (1772 m). It carries the westbound lanes of Interstate 90 across Lake Washington between Mercer Island, Washington, and Seattle, Washington. History The bridge was built in 1989 and is named for Homer More Hadley, who designed the bridge's companion span, the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge. Hadley also designed the McMillin Bridge in Pierce County. When the bridge was built, parallel to the Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, two reversible high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes were set up to accommodate the traffic flow between Seattle and the suburban Eastside (westbound in the morning, eastbound in the evenings). Sound Transit and the Washington State Department of Transportation added HOV lanes to the bridge's westbound lanes in 2017. This preceded construction of the East Link light rail line from downtown Seattle to Bellevue and Redmond, which will use the former reversible express lanes. East Link, scheduled to be completed in 2023, will be the first time that a light-rail line will operate on a floating bridge. Usage Looking west toward Seattle, Washington The bridge carries four westbound lanes, including a HOV lane, as well as a bicycle and pedestrian path on the north side. Prior to 2017, it also carried two reversible lanes, configured to normally carry westbound traffic on weekday mornings and eastbound traffic at other times. Use of the reversible express lanes was restricted to HOV traffic, except for vehicles traveling to and from Mercer Island. With a total of five traffic lanes and three full-sized shoulders, the Third Lake Washington Bridge was the widest floating bridge in the world, until the completion of the new Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 2016.

The Continental brigantine , commanded by Captain John Barry, captured the sloop , a tender to British frigate , off the Delaware Capes on 7 April 1776, after a fierce, one-hour fight. Lexington escorted her prize to Philadelphia where Edward was libeled on 13 April, condemned on 29 April, and purchased by the Marine Committee of the Continental Congress on 2 May. Renamed USS Sachem, the sloop was fitted out under the direction of 17-year-old Joshua Barney who received his commission as a lieutenant while the ship was being prepared for sea. Shortly before Sachem was ready for action, Captain Isaiah Robinson assumed command of the sloop. On 6 July, Sachem, carrying dispatches for Barry who was patrolling the mouth of the bay, dropped down the Delaware. The orders directed Barry to put to sea in Lexington. Since Barry declined the suggestion that the two ships cruise together, they parted after clearing the capes. On 12 August, Sachem fought brigantine, Three Friends, for over two hours before the British letter of marque surrendered. Robinson sent the prize to Philadelphia for adjudication and, since Sachem had suffered substantial damage in the battle, she followed Three Friends into port for repairs. After Sachem was back in fighting trim, she was placed under the direction of the Secret Committee which handled procurement matters for the Continental Congress. Few details of her subsequent operations have survived. It is known that she sailed for the West Indies on 29 March 1777 carrying dispatches for William Bingham, the Continental agent in Martinique. These letters were duplicates of earlier messages which had gone astray when the frigate was diverted to Charleston, South Carolina for repairs after losing two masts. It is said that Sachem was burned in the Delaware River the following autumn to avoid capture by the British, but evidence to substantiate this claim is scant.

It is not an SI unit, as the SI unit of angular measure is the radian, but it is mentioned in the SI brochure as an accepted unit. Because a full rotation equals 2 radians, one degree is equivalent to radians. History chord (red). One sixtieth of this arc is a degree. Six such chords complete the circle. The original motivation for choosing the degree as a unit of rotations and angles is unknown. One theory states that it is related to the fact that 360 is approximately the number of days in a year. Ancient astronomers noticed that the sun, which follows through the ecliptic path over the course of the year, seems to advance in its path by approximately one degree each day. Some ancient calendars, such as the Persian calendar and the Babylonian calendar, used 360 days for a year. The use of a calendar with 360 days may be related to the use of sexagesimal numbers. Another theory is that the Babylonians subdivided the circle using the angle of an equilateral triangle as the basic unit, and further subdivided the latter into 60 parts following their sexagesimal numeric system. The earliest trigonometry, used by the Babylonian astronomers and their Greek successors, was based on chords of a circle. A chord of length equal to the radius made a natural base quantity. One sixtieth of this, using their standard sexagesimal divisions, was a degree. Aristarchus of Samos and Hipparchus seem to have been among the first Greek scientists to exploit Babylonian astronomical knowledge and techniques systematically. Timocharis, Aristarchus, Aristillus, Archimedes, and Hipparchus were the first Greeks known to divide the circle in 360 degrees of 60 arc minutes. Eratosthenes used a simpler sexagesimal system dividing a circle into 60 parts. The division of the circle into 360 parts also occurred in ancient India, as evidenced in the Rigveda: Another motivation for choosing the number 360 may have been that it is readily divisible: 360 has 24 divisors,The divisors of 360 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 24, 30, 36, 40, 45, 60, 72, 90, 120, 180, and 360. making it one of only 7 numbers such that no number less than twice as much has more divisors . Furthermore, it is divisible by every number from 1 to 10 except 7.Contrast this with the relatively unwieldy 2520, which is the least common multiple for every number from 1 to 10. This property has many useful applications, such as dividing the world into 24 time zones, each of which is nominally 15° of longitude, to correlate with the established 24-hour day convention. Finally, it may be the case that more than one of these factors has come into play. According to that theory, the number is approximately 365 because of the apparent movement of the sun against the celestial sphere, and that it was rounded to 360 for some of the mathematical reasons cited above. Subdivisions For many practical purposes, a degree is a small enough angle that whole degrees provide sufficient precision. When this is not the case, as in astronomy or for geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude), degree measurements may be written using decimal degrees, with the degree symbol behind the decimals; for example, 40.1875°. Alternatively, the traditional sexagesimal unit subdivisions can be used. One degree is divided into 60 minutes (of arc), and one minute into 60 seconds (of arc). Use of degrees- minutes-seconds is also called DMS notation. These subdivisions, also called the arcminute and arcsecond, are respectively represented by a single prime (′) and a double prime (″). For example, , or, using quotation mark characters, . Additional precision can be provided using decimals for the arcseconds component. Maritime charts are marked in degrees and decimal minutes to facilitate measurement; 1 minute of latitude is 1 nautical mile. The example above would be given as 40° 11.25′ (commonly written as 11′25 or 11′.25). The older system of thirds, fourths, etc., which continues the sexagesimal unit subdivision, was used by al-Kashi and other ancient astronomers, but is rarely used today. These subdivisions were denoted by writing the Roman numeral for the number of sixtieths in superscript: 1I for a \\"prime\\" (minute of arc), 1II for a second, 1III for a third, 1IV for a fourth, etc. Hence, the modern symbols for the minute and second of arc, and the word \\"second\\" also refer to this system. Alternative units A chart to convert between degrees and radians In most mathematical work beyond practical geometry, angles are typically measured in radians rather than degrees. This is for a variety of reasons; for example, the trigonometric functions have simpler and more \\"natural\\" properties when their arguments are expressed in radians. These considerations outweigh the convenient divisibility of the number 360. One complete turn (360°) is equal to 2' radians, so 180° is equal to radians, or equivalently, the degree is a mathematical constant: 1° = . The turn (or revolution, full circle, full rotation, cycle) is used in technology and science. One turn is equal to 360°. With the invention of the metric system, based on powers of ten, there was an attempt to replace degrees by decimal \\"degrees\\"These new and decimal \\"degrees\\" must not be confused with decimal degrees. called grad or gon, where the number in a right angle is equal to 100 gon with 400 gon in a full circle (1° = gon). Although that idea was abandoned by Napoleon, grades continued to be used in several fields and many scientific calculators support them. Decigrades () were used with French artillery sights in World War I. An angular mil, which is most used in military applications, has at least three specific variants, ranging from to . It is approximately equal to one milliradian ( ). A mil measuring of a revolution originated in the imperial Russian army, where an equilateral chord was divided into tenths to give a circle of 600 units. This may be seen on a lining plane (an early device for aiming indirect fire artillery) dating from about 1900 in the St. Petersburg Museum of Artillery.

The symbol ° is usually used, followed by the initial letter of the unit, for example “°C” for degree(s) Celsius. A degree can be defined as a set change in temperature measured against a given scale, for example, one degree Celsius is one hundredth of the temperature change between the point at which water starts to change state from solid to liquid state and the point at which it starts to change from its liquid to gaseous state.. Scales of temperature measured in degrees Common scales of temperature measured in degrees: * Celsius (°C) * Fahrenheit (°F) * Rankine (°R or °Ra), which uses the Fahrenheit scale, adjusted so that 0 degrees Rankine is equal to absolute zero. Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and degree Celsius, the kelvin is not referred to or written as a degree.

The film was directed by Mick Jackson for the BBC's Horizon science series, and stars Jeff Goldblum, Tim Pigott-Smith, Juliet Stevenson, and Alan Howard. It won several awards in the UK and U.S., including the 1988 BAFTA TV Award as the Best Single Drama. Summary The film tells the story of the rivalries of the two teams of scientists attempting to discover the structure of DNA. Francis Crick and James D. Watson at Cambridge University and Maurice Wilkins and Rosalind Franklin at King's College London. These two teams are also in competition with other scientists in the UK, and with international scientists such as the American Linus Pauling. The film manages to convey the loneliness and competitiveness of scientific research but also educates the viewer as to how the structure of DNA was discovered. In particular, it explores the tension between the patient, dedicated laboratory work of Franklin and the sometimes uninformed intuitive leaps of Watson and Crick, all played against a background of institutional turf wars, personality conflicts, and sexism. In the film Watson jokes, plugging the path of intuition: \\"Blessed are they who believed before there was any evidence.\\" The film also shows why Watson and Crick made their discovery, overtaking their competitors in part by reasoning from genetic function to predict chemical structure, thus helping to establish the then still-nascent field of molecular biology. Cast *Jeff Goldblum as James Watson *Tim Pigott-Smith as Francis Crick *Juliet Stevenson as Rosalind Franklin *Alan Howard as Maurice Wilkins Production The film script was written by William Nicholson, based on James Watson's 1968 memoir The Double Helix: A Personal Account of the Discovery of the Structure of DNA. It was produced and directed by Mick Jackson for Horizon, the long-running British documentary television series on BBC Two that covers science and philosophy. The film was produced by the BBC in association with the American A&E; network Original music was composed for the film by Peter Howell of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop. The main music theme is the Le Grand Choral by Georges Delerue, first used in the 1973 French film Day for Night directed by Truffaut. Detailed 1950s-style molecular models were recreated for the film. Accuracy In his book What Mad Pursuit, Francis Crick wrote that there were a few inaccuracies, such as portraying Watson as too manic and as always chewing gum, but wrote that overall \\"it tells a good story at a good pace so that people from all walks of life can enjoy it and absorb some of its lessons.

It was built in the 1820s, on a greenfield site just to the north of central London. Many of the houses were subdivided into flats during the Victorian era, and what was the street's communal garden is now the Carreras Building. History The crescent was named after the Earl of Mornington, brother of the Duke of Wellington. Comprising three curved terraces grouped in a crescent form around communal gardens, the north side of the crescent (numbers 37–46) was constructed first, dating from the 1820s or earlier. With 36 spacious houses suitable for professional people, the crescent was originally surrounded by green fields, enjoying views across open country to the front and rear, yet was conveniently close to town. However, the building of the railway line into the Euston terminus, and encroachment from the nearby working class districts of Kings Cross and Camden Town led to a change in the demographics of the area during the Victorian era. More and more, the houses were subdivided into houses of multiple occupancy with flats housing artists and artisans. The Art Deco Carreras Building The communal gardens of the crescent are occupied by a large Art Deco building, known as the Carreras Building. Originally built as a tobacco factory in 1926–28 by the Carreras Tobacco Company, it is a striking example of early 20th Century Egyptian Revival architecture and a distinctive local landmark, not least because of the large bronze statues of the Egyptian cat god Bastet which adorn the front. In the 1990s the building was restored and converted into an office building and renamed Greater London House. Cultural associations The crescent has a number of literary and artistic associations. The artist Frank Auerbach has a studio nearby and has often painted the crescent and surrounding area. The crescent was a popular subject of the Camden Town Group; the painter Walter Sickert lived there from 1905, at number 6, and Spencer Gore lived at number 31 from 1909 to 1912. Clarkson Stanfield (a painter friend of Charles Dickens) lived at number 36 from 1834 to 1841. The painter Harden Sidney Melville lived for a time at number 34. Dickens went to a school, Wellington House Academy, on Granby Terrace adjoining Mornington Crescent, after his spell working in a blacking warehouse.

The term autoerotic asphyxiation is used when the act is done by a person to themselves. Colloquially, a person engaging in the activity is sometimes called a gasper. The erotic interest in asphyxiation is classified as a paraphilia in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association. Erotic asphyxiation can lead to accidental death due to asphyxia. Physiology Concerning hallucinogenic states brought about by chronic hypoxia, Dr. E. L. Lloyd notes that they may be similar to the hallucinations experienced by climbers at altitude. He further notes that no such state occurs in hypoxia brought about by sudden aircraft decompression at altitude. These findings suggest to him that they do not arrive purely from a lack of oxygen. Upon examining the studies on hypoxia he found that \\"abnormalities in the cerebral neurochemistry involving one or more of the interconnected neurotransmitters, dopamine, serotonin, and beta-endorphin had been reported in all the conditions associated with hallucinations.\\"  History  Historically, the practice of autoerotic asphyxiation has been documented since the early 17th century. It was first used as a treatment for erectile dysfunction. The idea for this most likely came from subjects who were executed by hanging. Observers at public hangings noted that male victims developed an erection, sometimes remaining after death (a death erection), and occasionally ejaculated when being hanged. Practice Various methods are used to achieve the level of oxygen depletion needed, such as a hanging, suffocation with a plastic bag over the head, self-strangulation such as with a ligature, gas or volatile solvents, chest compression, or some combination of these. Sometimes, complicated devices are used to produce the desired effects. The practice can be dangerous even if performed with care and has resulted in a significant number of accidental deaths. Uva (1995) writes “Estimates of the mortality rate of autoerotic asphyxia range from 250 to 1000 deaths per year in the United States.” Cases have also been reported in Scandinavia and Germany. Autoerotic asphyxiation may often be mistaken for suicide, which is a major cause of death in teenagers.  Accidental death  Deaths often occur when the loss of consciousness caused by partial asphyxia leads to loss of control over the means of strangulation, resulting in continued asphyxia and death. While often asphyxiophilia is incorporated into sex with a partner, others enjoy this behaviour by themselves, making it potentially more difficult to get out of dangerous situations.Autoerotic Asphyxiophilia on 'Sexinfo' website, University of Santa Barbara, Ca. In some fatality cases, the body of the asphyxiophilic individual is discovered naked or with genitalia in hand, with pornographic material or sex toys present, or with evidence of having orgasmed prior to death. Bodies found at the scene of an accidental death often show evidence of other paraphilic activities, such as fetishistic cross-dressing and masochism. In cases involving teenagers at home, families may disturb the scene by \\"sanitizing\\" it, removing evidence of paraphilic activity. This can have the consequence of making the death appear to be a deliberate suicide, rather than an accident.Downs, Martin. The Highest Price for Pleasure, featured by WebMD The great majority of known erotic asphyxial deaths are male; among all known cases in Ontario and Alberta from 1974 to 1987, only 1 out of 117 cases was female. Some individual cases of women with erotic asphyxia have been reported. The main age of accidental death is mid-20s, but deaths have been reported in adolescents and in men in their 70s. Autoerotic asphyxiation has at times been incorrectly diagnosed as murder and especially so when a partner is present. Lawyers and insurance companies have brought cases to the attention of clinicians because some life insurance claims are payable in the event of accidental death, but not suicide. =Famous cases= Newspaper photo taken shortly after the arrest of Sada Abe (center) in Tokyo on May 20, 1936 Although Paula Yates contradicted earlier statements she had made by saying during a 1999 interview that Michael Hutchence’s 1997 death might have been caused by autoerotic asphyxiation http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/416509.stm \\"Paula challenges Hutchence verdict\\".

He played for the Detroit Tigers, New York Mets, Colorado Rockies, and Chicago Cubs of the Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1982 to 1995. He is third on the Mets' all-time lists for home runs, runs batted in, doubles, and stolen bases. He also played for the Rockland Boulders of the Canadian-American Association of Professional Baseball. On July 13, 2007, he was promoted from his position as the Mets' first base coach to their hitting coach which he held until the end of the 2010 season. From 2014 to June 2015, he was the hitting coach of the Seattle Mariners after starting 2013 as the batting instructor for the Tacoma Rainiers, the Mariners' Triple-A affiliate. Early life Johnson was born in Clearwater, Florida, and attended Clearwater High School playing baseball as a pitcher. He attended St. Petersburg Junior College and, at age 17 was drafted in the 23rd round of the 1978 MLB draft by the New York Yankees. Johnson did not sign with the Yankees and the following January was drafted in the first round, 12th overall, by the Tigers. Baseball career =1980–1983: Transition from minor leagues to major leagues= In the minor leagues, the Tigers soon converted Johnson from a pitcher to an infielderHoward Johnson at Baseball Library, and in 1981, he hit 22 home runs for the AA Birmingham Barons. He was promoted to Detroit to start 1982, but was hitting only .188 in early May when he was sent back to AAA.Howard Johnson 1982 regular season batting log – Retrosheet. He was back in the majors in mid-August and posted fantastic numbers for the rest of the season, including a .405 average in September that raised his final average to .316. He started 1983 with the big club but was sent down again in late May with a .212 average. =1984: Detroit Tigers and a first championship= In 1984, Johnson was back with the Tigers and was made the left side of a platoon with Tom Brookens. Johnson started fairly well but had a poor second half.Howard Johnson 1984 regular season batting splits – Retrosheet. The Tigers led the division for the entire season but Johnson sat the bench for the entire 1984 ALCS while Brookens, Marty Castillo and Darrell Evans split time at third.1984 American League Championship Series – Baseball-Reference.com Johnson wound up pinch-hitting only once in the 1984 World Series, reaching on an error by second baseman Alan Wiggins as the Tigers eased through the postseason en route to the world championship.1984 World Series – Baseball-Reference.com =1985–1986: New York Mets and a second championship= Johnson in 1986 After the season, Detroit traded Johnson to the New York Mets for pitcher Walt Terrell. The move put three players at third base for the Mets but, three days later, they sent Hubie Brooks to the Montreal Expos as part of a trade for catcher Gary Carter.Howard Johnson and Hubie Brooks – Baseball-Reference.com. Johnson's inability to hit well from the right side resulted in him being platooned by the Mets in 1985, this time with Ray Knight. Both started terribly and neither reached .200 until early July. Johnson hit below average all season, while Knight was even worse. The Mets, as they had in 1984, narrowly missed the postseason in 1985. 1986 was the year of the Mets and both Johnson and Knight started very well. The Mets' problems shifted from third base to shortstop as Rafael Santana struggled to keep his average above .150 most of the season. Johnson was a capable shortstop defensively and picked up extra playing time moving between short and third but his hitting started declining in May. Between his mediocre hitting, continued lack of power, and an injury that wiped out three weeks in June, Johnson played in only 88 games in the regular season. When he returned from the June injury, Johnson went on a home run tear including two in his first game back and, within six weeks, his slugging percentage jumped from .376 to .510. One of Johnson's home runs occurred in a legendary game on July 22, 1986, against the Cincinnati Reds. When a 10th- inning bench-clearing fight ended, three Mets players were out of the game and they were forced to spend the rest of the game with a pitcher in the outfield and two pitchers in the batting lineup. When one of the pitchers, Jesse Orosco, drew a walk in the 14th inning, Johnson followed with a three-run home run that led to a Mets win. Johnson faded down the stretch and was virtually shut out of the postseason, going 0-for-7 in four games. His only start was Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, when he went 0-for-4 in a crucial Mets loss that put them in an 0–2 hole. His only other at bat in the series was in Game 6, when he struck out in the ninth inning. Nevertheless, at age 25, Johnson already had his second World Series ring. =1987: Breakout season= Ray Knight was allowed to become a free agent after the 1986 World Series. Johnson, given sole ownership of the third base position, began a three-month power surge in mid-May. In 10 games, he hit five home runs, including a pair of three-run shots, with 13 RBI. In an 11-game span a month later, he hit another six home runs with 10 RBI. In seven games around the all-star break, he hit another six home runs and seven RBIs, raising his slugging percentage over .520. With his 22nd home run of the season in mid-July, the previously light-hitting Johnson took over the team home run lead from Darryl Strawberry while hitting from the seventh spot in the batting order. He ended July with six RBIs in seven games along with a four-hit game, and then started August with a grand slam. In a 13-game span in late July and early August, he had at least one RBI in all but one game and amassed 17 RBIs overall. Three games in mid-August brought another three home runs and seven RBIs, but the power tear was about over for his breakout season. Johnson's power surge was complemented by a surge in speed. Although he had 31 stolen bases in five previous seasons, on September 11, 1987, Johnson stole his 30th base to join the 30–30 club for the first time. Johnson became the first switch-hitter to join the club, and he and Strawberry became the only teammates to achieve 30–30 status in the same season. Another grand slam in September brought Johnson's home run total to 36, just four shy of his entire career before 1987. Unfortunately for the Mets, as Johnson's power faded, so did their run at the postseason and the defending champions missed the playoffs. The entire league took notice of Johnson's unexpected rise in 1987 and he received 42 points in the voting for National League MVP. His home run and RBI totals were second only to Strawberry on the team and his home runs were seventh-best in the entire majors. His right-handed hitting was substantially better than his left-handed hitting with numbers better in almost every category including a batting average 36 points higher and slugging 74 points higher. His 36 home runs overall were the most in National League history by a switch-hitter, breaking Ripper Collins' 53-year-old record. In 1988, Johnson did not nearly live up to his stellar 1987 season, but still showed decent home run power. He reverted to hitting much better from the left side with a .183 average and .338 slugging from the right side. A mid-season injury to his right shoulder contributed to his poor offense. One bright spot was September 8, 1988, when he had the only five-hit game of his career, going 5-for-5 with a three-run home run and four RBIs in a Wrigley Field victory. While Johnson was struggling to stay above .230, the Mets tried out 21-year-old third-base prospect, Gregg Jefferies, who blazed through September. After 13 games, Jefferies, who was also a switch hitter, had a batting average of .462 and a fantastic slugging percentage of .962 with five home runs, a four-hit game and four three-hit games. Despite Johnson's mediocre season, the Mets easily coasted to a division win but Johnson went 1-for-18 with six strikeouts in the 1988 NLCS. With the heavily favored Mets down 3–2 in the series, he was benched for Games 6 and 7 in favor of Jefferies. Johnson pinch-hit in Game 7 and struck out for the final out of the Mets disappointing season. =1988–1989: Trade rumors= With Johnson and Jefferies competing for the third base job, the 1988–89 off-season was filled with trade rumors. The logjam was cleared when second baseman Wally Backman was traded to the Minnesota Twins making Jefferies the Mets' regular second baseman in 1989. Johnson was moved from sixth or seventh in the lineup to third, in front of star slugger Darryl Strawberry, who had led the N.L. in home runs and slugging in 1988. The Mets were rewarded for not trading Johnson when he surpassed most of his numbers from 1987. Johnson had a torrid June when he hit eleven home runs, 24 RBIs and logged a slugging percentage of .770 earning him his first National League Player of the Month award. In the All-Star voting, third baseman Mike Schmidt was elected to start for the N.L. but that posed a problem: Schmidt had already retired six weeks before the game. As a result, Johnson was chosen to start for his first All-Star Game. In his first All-Star at bat, he drove in the second run of the game in which the N.L. lost 5–3. Johnson played well in the second half but an overall team slowdown knocked the Mets out of the playoffs. With his 30th home run on August 20, 1989, Johnson joined Bobby Bonds and Willie Mays as the only multi-year members of the 30–30 club. The only other infielders in major league history who had had multiple 30–30 seasons as of 2011 were Ian Kinsler, Alfonso Soriano, and Jeff Bagwell. He ended 1989 with 36 home runs, tying his career-high and his own N.L. record for switch hitters. He also broke the 100-RBI mark for the first time, finishing with 101. Only Kevin Mitchell's career year stopped Johnson from winning both the home run and slugging titles in the N.L. like his teammate Strawberry had done in 1987. Johnson also stole 41 bases, a career high, and scored 104 runs which tied for first in the N.L. He received 153 points in voting for N.L. MVP, finishing fifth. Both his on-base percentage and slugging from 1989 were career highs. After his stellar 1989, Howard Johnson's salary doubled from less than $800,000 to over $1.6 million but, similar to 1988, Johnson followed a great year with a decent one in 1990. Johnson put up consistently average numbers for the entire season. He stole 34 bases and, for the third time, he played in over 150 games. Despite finishing with only a .244 average and .434 slugging percentage, Johnson still racked up 90 RBIs and 37 doubles. He spent the last two months of the season as Kevin Elster's replacement at shortstop. The Mets started the season so poorly that manager Davey Johnson was fired in May but, under new manager Bud Harrelson, they recovered to win 91 games. They even took over first place in early September, but still missed the playoffs. Johnson's best game was his first ever five-RBI game, including a grand slam, at Wrigley Field on June 13, 1990. The quality of his season again mirrored the quality of his right-handed hitting, as he batted only .208 from his weaker side. =1990–1991: Leading the National League= Johnson's fall-off in 1990 led to more trade rumors. Instead, the Mets' troubled all-time home run and RBIs leader, Darryl Strawberry, left New York when he was signed by the Los Angeles Dodgers in December 1990. Johnson became the leader of the offense for the Mets and, in response, became arguably the best offensive player in the National League in 1991, winning two-thirds of the coveted Triple Crown. Johnson started slowly in April and caught fire in early May. The RBIs came in waves all season as he hit a right-handed grand slam on June 18, 1991 and had 26 RBIs in 22 games before the All-Star break. With 63 RBI, Johnson was selected as a reserve to his second and last All-Star Game. He finished out July well and had a slow August before a fantastic September in which he hit ten home runs with 28 RBIs while slugging nearly .700, earning him his second National League Player of the Month award. Johnson was the last Met to win the award until David Wright in June 2006. At season's end, Johnson had won both the National League home run title and RBI title. The 38 home runs broke his own record for N.L. switch hitters and 117 RBIs set the Met record for most runs batted in in a season until 1999. Both were also career bests for Johnson. On October 1, 1991, he stole his 30th base becoming only the second player, after Bobby Bonds, to join the 30–30 club in three different seasons. In June 1991, he passed Dave Kingman into second place on the Mets' all-time home run list. Johnson received 112 votes for National League MVP, finishing fifth. He likely would have received more MVP consideration except that the Mets had fallen all the way to a 77–84 record, second-to-last in the division. Despite his heroics, the Mets scored the fifth fewest runs per game in the majors. Johnson's had become a one-man show—his 38 home runs were more than the next two highest totals on the team combined and his RBI total was tops on the team by more than 40. His biggest liability was defense as he accumulated a career-worst 31 errors. In September, with Hubie Brooks out of the lineup and Johnson struggling defensively, the Mets moved him to the outfield, where he played for most of the rest of the year. =1992–1995: Later years and retirement= Going into the 1992 season, Johnson was surrounded by high-priced veterans like Eddie Murray, Bobby Bonilla, Vince Coleman, and Bret Saberhagen but he responded by virtually disappearing. While he was a spotty right-handed hitter his whole career, in 1992, he stopped hitting from either side of the plate. He hit three home runs in April and followed up with an even worse May. After three months, he had only seven home runs and was batting .223 with a slugging percentage well under .400. A home run in late June turned out to be his last of the season. He went homerless for another month before fracturing his wrist in late July. He played a few more games in agony before the fracture was diagnosed and his season ended in early August. Johnson made over $2 million while his slugging percentage dropped nearly 200 points from 1991. The Mets had the third-highest payroll in the majors and finished 72–90, two games out of last place in the division. He hit his 183rd National League home run that year, breaking Ted Simmons' league career record for home runs by a switch hitter. The 1993 Mets made their fans forget 1992 as the team went from bad to the worst team in the majors. His batting average did not reach .200 until almost May and his slugging only raised above .400 for barely a week before diving back down. He missed three weeks in June and his season again ended prematurely in late July. After the end of the 103-loss campaign, Johnson's time with the Mets came to an end as he was granted free agency. In 1994, Johnson signed with the Colorado Rockies. Despite the hitter-friendly atmosphere of Mile High Stadium, he wound up hitting more home runs on the road finishing with only ten overall. In the crowded left field position, he split time with Mike Kingery and Eric Young but was mostly pinch hitting by August when the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike ended the season. His .211 average was the worst of his career to that point and he was not re- signed. Johnson signed on with the Chicago Cubs, shortly after the strike ended in April 1995. He saw limited playing time and his average was at .115 in mid-August, lower than many of the team's pitchers. All of his production was at Wrigley Field, as his average on the road was under .100 with only two extra-base hits. A spurt in September raised his overall average to .195 but was not enough to garner a new contract from the Cubs. When he found no team interested, Johnson retired at age 35. =1996–present: Post-retirement / comeback attempts / coaching career= After retiring, Johnson expressed an interest in coaching. In mid-1996, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays named Johnson to the coaching staff of their rookie-level minor league team, the Butte Copper Kings. In February 1997, Johnson attempted a comeback with the Mets but abandoned the attempt after a month when his batting average was .129. Later in the year, he signed on as a scout with the Mets. Johnson was named the batting coach of the Mets' Brooklyn Cyclones minor league team for 2001. He was made the manager for 2002 after Brooklyn was named co-champion of the New York–Penn League (the championship was cancelled due to the September 11, 2001 attacks). In 2003, Johnson was the hitting coach under manager, Ken Oberkfell, when the St. Lucie Mets won the Florida State League championship. Johnson and Oberkfell were promoted to the AA Binghamton Mets for 2004 and guided them into the Eastern League playoffs. Both were promoted again to the AAA Norfolk Tides for 2005 and the Tides posted their highest batting average in six seasons. He served as the Tides' hitting coach again in 2006 under Oberkfell. In 2007, he took over first base coaching duties for the Mets, and later that year was named hitting coach. In 2011, he was replaced by Dave Hudgens. In 2011, at age 50, Howard Johnson returned to professional baseball for a brief comeback to play two minor league games with his son Glen Johnson for the Rockland Boulders. In the first game, Howard went hitless in four at-bats, but made contact in each plate appearance. In the second game, he walked in his first at-bat but then left the game to be the team's first-base coach. Johnson was named hitting coach for AAA Tacoma Rainiers of the Seattle Mariners organization for the 2013 baseball season. Johnson joined the Mariners as a hitting coach for the 2014 season, part of the new coaching staff. He was replaced by Edgar Martínez on June 20, 2015. Johnson managed the single-A Down East Wood Ducks in 2017, and was hitting instructor for the AAA Round Rock Express in 2018. In 2019, he was the hitting coach for the AAA Nashville Sounds. In 2020, he joined the Toros de Tijuana of the Mexican League as their hitting coach.

Within two years of his retirement, Johnson's two major National League switch-hitting home run records were broken. In 1996, his single-season record was broken by former teammate, Todd Hundley, who finished with 41. In 1997, his career record was broken by another former teammate, Bobby Bonilla, who hit his 210th National League home run in the midst of a championship season with the Florida Marlins. Bonilla finished his career in 2001 with 249 NL home runs, but Chipper Jones of the Braves currently holds the NL single-season switch hit HR record (45), achieved in 1999, and the career mark as well (452). Mike Piazza passed Johnson into second-place on both the all-time Mets home run list in 2004 and the all-time Mets RBI list in 2005. In 2001, Johnson was on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot but received no votes. Personal life Howard is married to his wife, Kim. Together they have three children (daughters: Shannon and Kayla; and son, Glen). Shannon is a figure skating coach in Florida. Glen started his amateur baseball career as a switch-hitting shortstop when he attended Jacksonville University on a baseball scholarship. In the 2007 draft, Johnson's son Glen was selected by the Mets in the 36th round but did not sign with the team. Glen continued to play professional baseball and most recently has been an infielder for the Newark Bears.

It has been frequented by many notable movie stars and celebrities. The restaurant has continued to serve traditional food items, including: lox and bagels, corned beef, matzoh ball soup, or challah. However, it is not certified kosher, being open on Saturdays and offering many non-kosher menu items (e.g., ham sandwiches). Canter's has remained open 24 hours most days, except on the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.  History  The Canter family originally opened a delicatessen in Jersey City, New Jersey, in 1924. They came west along with many Jews from the northeastern United States, and in 1931 they opened a delicatessen on Brooklyn Avenue in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, which at that time had a substantial Jewish population. After World War II, the Jewish population of Boyle Heights left en masse for the Fairfax District, West Hollywood, and other West Side neighborhoods (as well as the San Fernando Valley) and Canter's followed the influx of Jewish businesses west. A location at 439 North Fairfax Avenue opened in 1948; in 1953, the restaurant moved up the block into the former Esquire Theater (which had previously shown Yiddish-language films), resulting in a delicatessen much larger than its previous spaces. The restaurant was further expanded in 1959, and the Kibbitz Room cocktail lounge opened in 1961. The Boyle Heights location remained in business until the 1970s. Canter's quickly became a hang- out for show business personalities, given its location and late hours. It has remained such ever since. In the 1960s, Canter's became a late night hang-out for hippies, rock musicians, and other countercultural types, partially for the same reasons. Also, many rock musicians had grown up in Fairfax and West Hollywood, and the Sunset Strip was only a half-mile (0.8 km) away. Canter's has remained a favorite of rock musicians to the present day, and is still open 24 hours. Canter's is open every day except for the Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Canter's is known for its traditional deli favorites, such as pastrami, corned beef, matzah ball soup, challah, lox and bagels, and brisket. It also has a large menu of other breakfast, lunch, and dinner options and has been awarded for its food many times over the years. For example, Los Angeles Magazine named Canter's waffles the Best Waffle in Los Angeles. Esquire magazine called their Monte Cristo sandwich one of the best sandwiches in America. The bar in Canter's, called the Kibbitz Room, has its own history and has been a favorite of music personalities. Chuck E. Weiss. a regular at Canter's who has his name on a plaque at the booth where he would sit, wrote a song about the Kibitz Room called, \\"Rocking in the Kibbitz Room.\\" Although the restaurant is open 24 hours, the Kibitz Room closes at 2 am. They have live music every night, and were the launch pad for several bands, most notably the Wallflowers, Fiona Apple, and Rick Rubin's new project, the Vacation. The Big jam has had plenty of \\"A List\\" musicians sit in, including Phil Everly, Jackson Browne, Melissa Etheridge, and Marc Canter's high school friend Slash. Marc Canter, currently the restaurant's co- owner, published a book in 2007 about the early days of Guns N' Roses. In 2019 Gina Canter and Alex Canter released a book title \\"Stores on Rye\\" cataloging a collection of memories shared at Canter's. The restaurant has been featured in several movies and television shows, including HBO's Curb Your Enthusiasm in the episode \\"The Blind Date\\" (2004) and AMC's Mad Men in the episode \\"Time Zones\\" (2014). In 2007, Adam Stein, finalist on the FOX TV show On the Lot, filmed Dough: The Musical at Canter's. Canter's is also mentioned in the song, \\"Oh Daddy,\\" by The Turtles. In 2003, Canter's opened an additional location inside Treasure Island Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. It closed in December 2012. Another location has been announced for The Linq Promenade. Early Canter's Menu On 14 October 2008, Canter's celebrated their 60th anniversary. To mark the occasion, the deli reduced the price of their corned beef sandwich to its 1948 price of 60 cents, limited to one per customer, for a period of 12 hours. In 2008, Canter's had opened another deli outlet at Dodger Stadium. The operation at the baseball park closed in 2011 and was replaced by Dodgertown Deli. Today, the restaurant is not certified kosher, being open on Saturdays and offering non-Kosher menu items, such as ham sandwiches. On July 24, 2014, President Barack Obama surprised the lunchtime diners and staff when he visited Canter's. In 2017 Canter's Deli announced it would open a location along the Las Vegas strip. On August 7, 2017, Canter's Restaurant was ordered closed for three days by the Los Angeles County Health Department for eleven health code violations, including a vermin infestation. Among other things, inspectors observed more than 10 cockroaches and 20 rodent droppings in the restaurant storage area, and 20 flies in the food preparation area. The additional health code violations cited that food contact surfaces were not clean and sanitized and the food was not in a safe, healthy condition.Los Angeles Times, August 24, 2017), ABC News August 22, 2017 Canter's has now closed all locations in Las Vegas. After returning to the Las Vegas market in 2017, the first location closed at Tivoli Village in July 2018 and the second location closed at the Linq Promenade the second week of March, 2019.Vegaschanges.com, March 20, 2019 On May 30, 2020, at the start of the George Floyd Protests, Canter's neighborhood was the site of one of the first intense confrontations between protestors and police in Los Angeles. Canter's posted messages in support of Black Lives Matter and stayed open during the protests, giving out food and water to demonstrators. Popularity In 2006, Canter's was serving: * of pastrami per month * of chicken soup per week *4,000 knishes per week. Canter's is also prominently featured in Ann Patchett's novel, The Magician's Assistant. Canter's is mentioned in the song \\"Oh Daddy\\", by The Turtles. Chuck E.

MBASIC is a descendant of the original Altair BASIC interpreters that were among Microsoft's first products. MBASIC was one of the two versions of BASIC bundled with the Osborne 1 computer. The name \\"MBASIC\\" is derived from the disk file name MBASIC.COM of the BASIC interpreter.  Environment  MBasic 5.21 running on a Z80 CP/M system displayed on a monochrome monitor typical for that time. MBASIC version 5 required a CP/M system with at least 28 kB of random access memory (RAM) and at least one diskette drive. Unlike versions of Microsoft BASIC-80 that were customized by home computer manufacturers to use the particular hardware features of the computer, MBASIC relied only on the CP/M operating system calls for all input and output. Only the CP/M console (screen and keyboard), line printer, and disk devices were available. MBASIC in the uncustomized form had no functions for graphics, color, joysticks, mice, serial communications, networking, sound, or even a real-time clock function. MBASIC did not fully support the features of the host CP/M operating system, for example, it did not support CP/M's user areas for organizing files on a diskette. Since CP/M systems were typically single- user and stand alone, there was no provision for file or record locking, or any form of multitasking. Apart from these limitations, MBASIC was considered at the time to be a powerful and useful implementation of BASIC.  Features  = Language system = MBASIC is an interpreter. Program source text was stored in memory in tokenized form, with BASIC keywords replaced by one-byte tokens which saved memory space and speeded execution. Any line prefixed with a line number was stored as program text; BASIC statements not prefixed with a line number were executed immediately as commands. Programs could be listed on the screen for editing, or saved to disk in either a compressed binary format or as plain ASCII text. Every source line was identified with a number, which could be used as the target of a GOTO or GOSUB transfer. Only line editing commands were provided.CP/M products providing full-screen editing support required their own installation routines to customize the software for the specific computer terminal used as the system console. No support was provided within CP/M to standardize terminal capabilities. It was often beneficial to save a program as plain text and edit it with a full featured editor. Program text, variables, disk buffers and the CP/M operating system itself all had to share the 64 kilobyte address space of the 8080 processor. Typically when first starting MBASIC there would be less than 32 kB memory available for programs and data, even on a machine equipped with a full 64 kilobytes of RAM. Comment lines, prefixed with the \` REM \` keyword or an apostrophe, could be placed in the program text but took up valuable memory space, which discouraged BASIC users from fully documenting their code. To allow larger and more complex programs to be run, later versions of MBASIC supported functions that allowed portions of program text to be read in and executed under program control (the \\"\` CHAIN \`\\" and \` MERGE \` statements). No support for \\"shell\\" command execution was provided, though this functionality could be duplicated by a determined programmer. A particular advantage of MBASIC was the full-text error messages provided for syntax and run-time errors. MBASIC also had a \\"trace\\" function that displayed line numbers as they were executed. While this occupied the same screen space as normal program output, it was useful for detecting conditions such as endless loops. = Files and input/output = Data could be read and stored to disk as either sequential files (delimited by the CP/M convention of CR/LF at the end of each line) or else as fixed-record- length random access files, which, given a sufficiently determined programmer, could be used to perform database-type record manipulation. The Microsoft Binary Format for floating point numbers was proprietary to the implementation, which meant that data could only be interchanged with other programs using ASCII text representation or else with extensive programming to convert the binary format. = Variables and data types = MBASIC supported the following data types: * 8-bit character data, in strings of length 0 to 255 characters; * 16-bit integers; * 32-bit floating point (single precision), equivalent to six decimal digits, with a two-digit exponent; * 64-bit floating point (double precision), equivalent to sixteen decimal digits, with a two- digit exponent. String operators included substring selection, concatenation, assignment, and testing for equality. Arrays of the above types were allowed with up to 7 dimensions, but no functions or operators worked on arrays; for example, there was no assignment of arrays. Unlike some other BASIC implementations of the time, MBASIC did not provide support for matrix operations, complex numbers, or a decimal (BCD) data type for financial calculations. All floating point operations were carried out in software since typical CP/M systems did not have floating point hardware. The built-in mathematics functions (sine, cosine, tangent, natural log, exponential, square root) only gave single precision results. A software pseudorandom number generator was provided; this relied on the user to key in a seed number to obtain a sequence of numbers useful for games and some simulations. MBASIC permitted but did not require the \` LET \` keyword for assignment statements. Early versions of BASIC on microcomputers were infamous for one- or two- character variable names, which made the meanings of variables difficult to recall in complex programs. MBASIC version 5 allowed identifiers up to 40 characters long, which permitted programmers to give variables readable names. = Program flow control = Program flow control in MBASIC was controlled by \` IF...THEN...ELSE... \` conditional tests, \` WHILE...WEND \` loops, and \` GOTO \` and \` GOSUB \` instructions. No \` CASE \` statement was available, although an \` ON...GOTO... \`(computed GOTO) provided multi-way branches. Subroutines had no parameters and all variables were global. MBASIC did not make structured programming mandatory for programmers and it was easy to write spaghetti code.  PEEKs, POKEs, and user functions  No discussion of BASICs on the 8-bit computers of the late '70s and early '80s would be complete without mentioning the importance of the PEEK and POKE functions for directly reading and writing to memory. Since these systems typically had no memory protection, this allowed a programmer to access portions of the operating system, or functions that would not otherwise be available. This also provided opportunities for user programs to hang the system. For example, a CP/M programmer might use a \` POKE \` function to allow BASIC to switch the console device to the serial port, if the system BIOS supported this. For machines with real-time clocks, a set of \`PEEK\` instructions might have been used to access the time. For more complex operations, MBASIC allowed user-defined functions that could be called from a BASIC program. These were typically placed in a reserved area of memory, or POKEd into string constants, as a series of machine codes (op codes). MBASIC also provided hardware \`INP\` and \`OUT\` instructions that read and wrote directly to the 8080 hardware input/output ports. This could be used to control peripheral devices, though on at least one common CP/M system, the Osborne 1, all I/O instructions were pre-empted for use by the system. Any MBASIC programs that made use of \`PEEK\` and \`POKE\`, and of machine code user functions, were not portable between machines without modifications.  Successors to MBASIC  Besides Microsoft's BASIC-80 for CP/M, a variant of MBASIC was also available as for the ISIS-II operating system. MSX-BASIC is also a well known successor of MBASIC, featuring several extensions specific to the MSX machines. All the functions of CP/M MBASIC were available in the IBM PC disk-based BASICA or GWBASIC which made migration of programs from CP/M systems to PC-compatibles possible. The tokens used to represent keywords were different, so CP/M programs had to be saved in ASCII source form. Typically screen formatting escape sequences put into the CP/M version would be replaced with the cursor positioning commands found in the PC versions of BASIC, otherwise little rewriting would be needed. BASCOM Microsoft sold a CP/M BASIC compiler (known as BASCOM) which used a similar source language to MBASIC. A program debugged under MBASIC could be compiled with BASCOM. Since program text was no longer in memory and the run-time elements of the compiler were smaller than the interpreter, more memory was available for user data. Speed of real program execution increased about 3 fold. Developers welcomed BASCOM as an alternative to the popular but slow and clumsy CBASIC. Unlike CBASIC, BASCOM did not need a preprocessor for MBASIC source code so could be debugged interactively. A disadvantage was Microsoft's requirement of a 9% royalty for each compiled copy of a program and $40 for hardware-software combinations. The company also reserved the right to audit developers' financial records. Because authors' typical royalty rates for software was 10-25%, InfoWorld in 1980 stated that BASCOM's additional 9% royalty rate \\"could make software development downright unprofitable\\", concluding that \\"Microsoft has the technical solution [to CBASIC's flaws], but not the economic one\\".  Importance of MBASIC  MBASIC was an important tool during the era of 8-bit CP/M computers. Skilled users could write routines in MBASIC to automate tasks that in modern-day systems would be performed by powerful application program commands or scripting languages. Exchange of useful MBASIC programs was a common function of computer users' groups. Keying in long BASIC listings from a magazine article was one way of \\"bootstrapping\\" software into a new CP/M system. At least one compiler for a high-level language was written in MBASIC, and many small games and utility programs ranging from a few lines to a few thousand lines of code were written.  Other uses  MBASIC is also the name of a commercial BASIC compiler for the Microchip Technology PIC microcontroller family developed by Basic Micro, Inc., unrelated to the CP/M interpreter.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Minnesota Twins, Chicago White Sox, and Philadelphia Phillies between and . Koosman is best known as a member of the Miracle Mets team that won the 1969 World Series. New York Mets =Rookie year= Koosman was discovered by the son of a Shea Stadium usher who caught Koosman when he pitched in the United States Army at Fort Bliss, Texas. The Mets offered Koosman a contract after his discharge from the military. Koosman was about to be cut from the Mets in 1966, when Joe McDonald, the assistant farm director, requested Koosman be retained at least until his first payday, as he owed the Mets money they had wired him after his car broke down en route to spring training. After leading all International League pitchers in strikeouts in , Koosman broke into the Mets’ rotation in . He posted a 19–12 record with seven shutouts, 178 strikeouts, and a 2.08 earned run average. The wins, shutouts, and ERA set franchise records, breaking those set by teammate Tom Seaver the year prior. Koosman also made the first of two All-Star teams in his career. The National League won the game 1–0 (to date, the only All-Star Game to end in a 1–0 score) in the \\"Year of the Pitcher.\\" Koosman pitched a scoreless ninth for the save, striking out Carl Yastrzemski for the final out. Koosman was named to the 1968 Topps All-Star Rookie Roster and finished runner-up to Johnny Bench for the National League Rookie of the Year honors. =The Miracle Mets= In Koosman posted a 17–9 record with a 2.28 ERA and 180 strikeouts in another All-Star season. That year, he was a member of the Mets team that unexpectedly won the National League East title (both leagues had split into two divisions after expanding from ten teams to 12) after not only finishing dead last in five of their first seven seasons, but also trailing the Chicago Cubs for much of that season by as many as 9 games. After Koosman lost to the Houston Astros to fall to 9–8, he won eight of his final nine decisions. In Game Two of the NLCS against the Atlanta Braves, Koosman was shelled for six runs in 4 innings (including a Hank Aaron three-run homer). The Mets won 11–6, however, then won the next game to complete the series sweep. Koosman was the pitching star of the 1969 World Series against the Baltimore Orioles. After Seaver was defeated in Game One, Koosman, leading 1–0, held the Orioles hitless until Paul Blair singled to lead off the bottom of the seventh inning, eventually scoring on Brooks Robinson's only hit in 19 Series' at-bats. The Mets regained the lead in the top of the ninth; Koosman got two outs in the bottom of the frame, then walked the next two batters. He was relieved by Ron Taylor, who induced Robinson to ground out to end the game. With the Series shifting from Memorial Stadium to Shea Stadium for the next three games, the Mets won Games Three and Four, and Koosman took the mound for Game Five. He fell behind 3–0 in the third inning after giving up home runs to his mound opponent, Dave McNally, and Frank Robinson. The Mets, however, cut into the Oriole lead on Donn Clendenon's two-run home run in the sixth, then tied the game in the seventh on a homer by Al Weis, who had hit only six career homers at that point—none of which had been in a home game. The Mets scored two runs in the eighth to take the lead, and after walking Frank Robinson to lead off the ninth, Koosman retired the next three hitters to end the game and complete the Mets’ improbable World Series win. Game ball for game 5 After catching Davey Johnson's fly ball for the final out of the World Series, left fielder Cleon Jones gave the game ball to Koosman. That ball, as well as the game ball from Game 2, was stored in a safe in Koosman's residence. In the early 1990s, Koosman sold the ball from Game 5. The Game 5 ball's current whereabouts are unknown. =\\"Ya Gotta Believe!\\" and \\"It Ain’t Over 'til It's Over\\"= In Koosman posted a 12–7 record with a 3.14 ERA. Over the next two seasons, however, he posted losing records: 6–11 in (a season in which he was beset by arm woes) and 11–12 in with a 4.14 ERA—more than a run and a half above his career ERA to that point. In he went 5–0 in his first six starts, but ended the season 14–15. In late August/early September of that year, he set a Mets' record by pitching 31 consecutive scoreless innings (R.A. Dickey broke his mark by pitching 32 consecutive scoreless innings in ). As in 1969, the Mets unexpectedly won the NL East title—once again overtaking the Cubs, whom they had trailed this time by as many as nine games—on the strength of the pitching of Koosman, Seaver and the previous year's NL Rookie of the Year, Jon Matlack. This comeback gave rise to two slogans: Tug McGraw's \\"Ya Gotta Believe!\\" and manager Yogi Berra's \\"It ain’t over 'til it's over.\\" In Game Three of the NLCS against the Cincinnati Reds, Koosman pitched a complete game for a 9–2 victory in a game that was headlined by Pete Rose's altercation with Mets' shortstop Bud Harrelson. The victory gave the Mets a 2–1 lead in the NLCS; they won the pennant two days later in five games. Koosman was the winning pitcher in Game Five of the World Series against the defending champion Oakland Athletics, holding Oakland scoreless for 6 innings. This victory gave the Mets a 3–2 lead in the Series; however, Oakland won the next two games to repeat as World Champions. =Later Met years= Koosman posted a 15–11 record in and 14–13 record in . In he had possibly his best season ever, establishing career bests with 21 wins (against 10 losses) and 200 strikeouts. He also finished runner-up to Randy Jones for the National League Cy Young Award. In , the Mets traded Seaver to the Reds. The remainder of the team deteriorated, especially Koosman who slumped to 8–20, finishing tied with Phil Niekro for most losses in the NL. After a 3–15 season in Koosman, seeing no imminent improvement to the team, was traded to the Minnesota Twins at his request. His departure left Ed Kranepool as the last remaining member of the 1969 Miracle Mets (although Seaver returned to the Mets for the 1983 season). The Mets acquired Jesse Orosco in the trade that sent Koosman to the Twins. (Orosco had been the player to be named later who went to the Mets to complete the deal, which had been made two months earlier, in December 1978.) Later career Koosman on September 28, 2008 Koosman rebounded in to post a 20–13 record, and went 16–13 in . On August 30, , less than a month after the 1981 players' strike ended, the Twins traded Koosman to the Chicago White Sox. He went 4–13 on the season, again finishing tied for his league lead in losses. Koosman posted identical 11–7 records in and . In the latter year, the White Sox won the American League West title to make their first post-season appearance since the 1959 World Series; however, the Baltimore Orioles defeated the White Sox in four games. After the season Koosman was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies; he went 14–15 in his last productive season. On April 13, 1984 Koosman gave up a double to Pete Rose for his 4000th hit. With 222 wins, he is tied (with Hooks Dauss) at #72 on the all-time win list. He ended his career with a 222–209 record and a 3.36 ERA in 612 games. He struck out 2,556 batters in 3,839 innings pitched. Koosman has the third most wins in Mets history (140) behind Tom Seaver (198) and Dwight Gooden (157). Koosman was inducted into the New York Mets Hall of Fame in . He attended the 40th anniversary reunion of the 1969 Miracle Mets at Citi Field on August 22, 2009. The New York Mets announced that they would retire Jerry Koosman's number 36 on June 13, 2020, making him only the third former Mets player to have their number retired. Federal tax problem In May 2009, Koosman pleaded guilty to misdemeanor federal tax evasion after failing to pay up to $90,000 in federal income taxes for 2002, 2003, and 2004.

It also operated scheduled passenger service flying as Transamerica Airlines as well as charter flights during its last decade. Its headquarters were on the grounds of Oakland International Airport (OAK) in Oakland, California.\\"World Airline Directory.\\" Flight International. March 30, 1985. 127. History The first production Douglas DC-8 in service with TIA at London Gatwick Airport in 1966 TIA DC-10-30CF convertible passenger/cargo airliner at Frankfurt Airport in 1977 Future travel and entertainment mogul Kirk Kerkorian purchased Los Angeles Air Service, a small charter operator, in 1947 for $60,000. As tourism to Las Vegas, Nevada, boomed, so did the fortunes of the airline. From a single Douglas DC-3, the company expanded rapidly, adding Douglas DC-6s and Lockheed L-1049 Super Constellations, and it became the first charter airline to operate jet aircraft with the introduction of the Douglas DC-8 on trans- Pacific routes as well as the Boeing 727 on shorter routes. The airline later added McDonnell Douglas DC-10 and Boeing 747 wide body jetliners to its fleet. To better reflect its growing route structure, the airline was renamed Trans International Airlines in 1960. Between 1966 and 1986 TIA operated regular charter flights between the U.S. and Europe. International destinations were Paris Orly (ORY), London Gatwick (LGW), Brussels Zaventem (BRU) and Frankfurt (FRA). TIA contributed to cheap transatlantic flights which did not exist at the time. Boeing 747 of Transamerica at Zurich Airport In 1962 the Studebaker Corporation quixotically purchased the airline, retaining Kerkorian as president. Financial circumstances forced it to sell TIA back to him in 1964. Kerkorian took the company public in 1965, then sold his interests in 1968 to insurance conglomerate Transamerica Corporation, profiting an estimated $85 million. He reinvested proceeds from the sale in Las Vegas property, notably the International Hotel. Transamerica Corporation later purchased Universal Airlines and in December 1976, Saturn Airways, and merged their operations into TIA. The airline remained focused on charter and cargo operations until the passage of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, which gave it the opportunity to offer scheduled passenger service. In 1979 the airline was renamed Transamerica Airlines and on November 2 of that year it commenced scheduled transatlantic passenger flights to Shannon (SNN) and Amsterdam (AMS). The May 1, 1982 Transamerica route map depicted scheduled nonstop flights being operated between Amsterdam and New York City as well as between Shannon and Chicago, Los Angeles, New York City and Oakland, CA.http://www.departedflights.com, May 1, 1982 Transamerica Airlines route map By 1983, the airline was flying scheduled service into Paris Orly Airport (ORY) on a weekly round trip routing of Paris-Shannon-Los Angeles-San Francisco with this flight being operated with a Super DC-8-73 jetliner.http://www.departedflights.com, July 1, 1983 Official Airline Guide (OAG) Worldwide edition: Los Angeles, Paris Orly, San Francisco & Shannon flight schedules Following the popular Alex Haley book Roots, Transamerica flew charter flights between New York and Africa known as the \\"Roots\\" program. Other popular programs were to the Caribbean, South America, and Hong Kong. The airline also flew more than a hundred flights for the Jeddah hajj pilgrimage wet leased on behalf of Union des Transports Aériens (UTA) and Air Afrique. During this time, the airline was under U.S. military contract and it operated a number of military charters. Most notable of these was the route that connected Clark Air Base, Philippines and Andersen Air Force Base, Guam, to Travis Air Force Base, California during the late 1970s, using DC-8s. TIA was heavily involved in the transport of troops during the Vietnam, Angola, and Middle East conflicts and the relocation of refugees. In the early 1980s, Transamerica Corporation (per stockholder reports) announced its intention to divest all holdings that were not financial in nature. Transamerica Airlines, among the top five profitable holdings, was divested in 1986. Although there were potential buyers, it was more profitable to sell the airline in pieces and parts. The airline was dissolved and ceased operations on September 30, 1986. Following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 and the ensuing proliferation of new low-cost airlines, Transamerica Corporation incorporated a second airline, and re-activated the Trans International Airlines (TIA) name. The new TIA, flying Super Douglas DC-8-61 aircraft, was led by Robert R. Lindberg as Chairman and CEO, and William A. Hardenstine as President (the latter formerly of World Airways). TIA operated in the mid-1980s, and was based at Orlando International Airport (MCO), Florida. TIA was sold as a going concern at approximately the same time as the larger Transamerica Airlines divested its aircraft. Transamerica destinations in 1984 According to its May 1, 1984 system timetable, Transamerica Airlines was operating scheduled passenger service to the following destinations with the carrier using the two letter airline code \\"TV\\": http://www.departedflights.com, May 1, 1984 Transamerica Airlines system timetable * Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas (DFW) * Frankfurt (FRA) * Honolulu (HNL) * Los Angeles (LAX) * New York City (JFK) * St. Louis (STL) * Shannon, Ireland (SNN) * Tel Aviv (TLV) Also according to the above referenced timetable, all Transamerica passenger flights were being operated at this time with Boeing 747 aircraft with the exception of the New York-Shannon route which was being flown with Douglas DC-8-73 aircraft (which the airline called the \\"Super-73\\"). Two years earlier in 1982, a Transamerica Airlines route map listed the following destinations being served with scheduled passenger flights: Amsterdam (AMS), Chicago (ORD), Los Angeles (LAX), New York City (JFK), Oakland, California (OAK) and Shannon (SNN).http://www.departedflights.com, May 1, 1982 Transamerica Airlines route map Transamerica also operated charter flights from New York LaGuardia Airport (LGA) to Cozumel, Mexico (CZM) during the mid 1970s. Accidents and incidents On June 24, 1968, two Frankfurt newspapers reported that a TIA flight between JFK and FRA on June 23, 1968, left shards of tire on the New York runway and caused an incident in Frankfurt whereby emergency vehicles were scrambled in anticipation of landing a DC-8 with one blown tire (outside tire of the right-side main gear). Ground personnel at JFK discovered pieces of rubber shortly after the DC-8 took off, after which the flight crew and authorities in Frankfurt were notified of the potential problem. The captain declined to inform passengers of the situation and landed the airliner in Frankfurt without incident. Mechanics replaced the destroyed tire and the aircraft was able to depart for New York at 4:00 pm the same day.article in GermanScanned JPG from Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung On September 8, 1970, Trans International Airlines Flight 863, a Douglas DC-8 N4863T ferry flight, with eight flight attendants and three cockpit crewmembers on board, crashed en route from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City to Washington Dulles International Airport. Unknowingly to the crew, a foreign object became wedged between the right elevator and horizontal stabilizer, blown there by backwash from the aircraft preceding it on the taxiway. The problem was not detected, and the aircraft crashed upon takeoff with the loss of all 11 on board. Following this incident, the FAA instituted new minimums between aircraft in line-up for take-off. On November 18, 1979, Transamerica Airlines Flight 18, a Lockheed L-188 Electra (N859U), operating a flight for the US military from Hill Air Force Base, crashed near Salt Lake City, Utah. While climbing between 12,000 and 13,000 ft, all electrical power was lost; the crew requested an immediate descent. The aircraft attained a high airspeed and a high rate of descent and the aircraft disintegrated in flight killing all three crew members. The NTSB investigation stated the probable cause was a progressive failure of the aircraft electrical system leading to the disabling or erratic performance of flight critical flight instruments and lighting. As a result, the crew became disoriented and lost control of the aircraft. The crew's efforts to regain control of the aircraft imposed loads which exceeded the design limits and caused it to break up in flight.

It is used in situations where the former owner transfers possession of the goods to a new owner. Bills of sale may be used in a wide variety of transactions: people can sell their goods, exchange them, give them as gifts or mortgage them to get a loan. They can only be used: * to transfer ownership of goods that people already own; * to transfer ownership of moveable tangible goods; and * by individuals and unincorporated businesses. Bills of sale exist at common law quite independently of any legislation. In England and Wales, they are regulated by two Victorian pieces of legislation: the Bills of Sale Act 1878 and the Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882. This area of the law was subject to review by the Law Commission, which published a proposal for change in 2017.  Bills of sale in the US  =Historical origin= The term “bill of sale” originally referred to any writing by which an absolute disposition of personalty for value was effected or evidenced. A common feature of such dispositions is that the owner mortgagor remains in possession and exercises all the attendant rights of ownership, which may be so overwhelming as to induce a third party to accept the same chattel as a security for a grant, albeit without notice of the first mortgagee. This scenario made the bill of sale a veritable tool of fraud. The evolution of various bills of sale laws, within the USA, was to curb the use of the bill of sale as a means of defrauding innocent persons. The first of such being the Bills of Sale Act 1854 which was repealed and re-enacted by the Bills of Sale Act 1878 which was almost on all fours with the 1854 act. Further developments led to the enactment of the Bills of Sale Act 1882. A bill of sale has been defined as a legal document made by the seller to a purchaser, reporting that on a specific date at a specific locality and for a particular sum of money or other value received, the seller sold to the purchaser a specific item of personal property, or parcel of real property of which he had lawful possession . The Black’s Law Dictionary on its part defines a bill of sale as “an instrument for the conveyance of title to personal property, absolutely or by way of security”. According to Omotola the bill of sale is “a form of legal mortgage of chattels”. Bullen and Leake and Jacobs define a bill of sale as “a document transferring a proprietary interest in personal chattels from one individual (the “grantor”) to another (the “grantee”), without possession being delivered to the grantee”. In essence, a bill of sale is a written instrument showing the voluntary transfer of a right or interest or title to personal property, either by way of security or absolutely, from one person to another without the actual physical possession of the property leaving the owner and being delivered to the other party. It is clear from the definitions above that the bills of sale are essentially of two types: The absolute bill of sale and the conditional bill of sale. =The absolute bill of sale= Absolute bills of sale, which do not represent any form of security whatsoever, are simply documents evidencing assignments, transfers and other assurances of personal chattels, which are substantially no more than mere contracts of sale of goods covered by the common law of contract and the sale of goods law. =The conditional bill of sale= The conditional bill of sale refers to any assignment or transfer of personal chattels to a person by way of security for the payment of money. The conditional bill of sale creates a security in favour of the grantee of the bill whereby the grantee is given personal right of seizure giving right to a security interest of a possessory nature. There are other forms of security over goods such as a pledge and contractual lien which also only give right to a security interest of a possessory nature. An example of a conditional bill of sale can be found where a creditor gives a loan and has transferred to himself, as collateral or security for the loan, the title of the goods or other personal property of the debtor. The physical goods or other property however remains with the debtor.  Bills of sale in England and Wales  = Historical perspective = Bills of sale have existed at common law since at least the Middle Ages, when they were most commonly used commercially in the shipping industry. As the general population began to own more personal goods in the Victorian era, bills of sale came to be used as a form of consumer credit. Lenders would extend credit on the security of: > all and every the household goods, furniture, plate, linen, china, books, > stock in trade, brewing utensils and all the effects.J Weir, \\"The Law of > Bills of Sale\\" (1896) p.23 Most often, people would grant bills of sale over their goods as security for a loan. Borrowers would transfer ownership of their goods to the lender, while retaining possession of them when making repayments. When the loan was repaid, the borrower would regain ownership. Bills of sale used in this way are known as “security bills”. Sometimes, bills of sale would transfer ownership outright, such as when a person sold their goods to another while retaining possession. Bills of sale used for purposes other than borrowing money are known as “absolute bills”. = Bills of Sale Acts = The increased use of bills of sale in the Victorian era created a “false wealth” problem. Potential purchasers and other lenders could be misled into thinking that the person in possession of goods still owned them. The person in possession could sell the goods or use them to secure another loan. In both cases, the transaction was fraudulent, but the purchaser or lender had no way of discovering that the goods were already subject to a bill of sale. As a result, Parliament passed the Bills of Sale Act 1878. This largely replicated the provisions of an earlier Bills of Sale Act 1854. It requires all bills of sale to be registered at the High Court so that interested third parties could check whether the person in possession has already transferred away ownership of goods. The Bills of Sale Act (1878) Amendment Act 1882 had a different purpose. The 1878 Act led to a rise in the use of security bills. Concerns were expressed that such transactions could lead “thousands of honest and respectable people to their ruin”.Hansard (HC), 20 March 1882, vol 267, cc1398-416. Parliament noted that: > Many money-lenders advertised under the names of fictitious banks; and > sometimes they advertised in this form – “A widow, with capital to spare, > will be happy to lend on easy terms. Strict secrecy. Five per cent.”… Having > entrapped a man into his office, the money-lender proceeded in this way – He > produced a bill of sale containing a large number of clauses, which it was > impossible for the borrower to read or understand in the time allowed... In response, Parliament enacted the 1882 Act, which was an early attempt at consumer protection. Both the 1878 Act and the 1882 Act remain in force today. Absolute bills are regulated only by the 1878 Act. Security bills are regulated by the 1882 Act and the 1878 Act, to the extent that its provisions are consistent with those of the 1882 Act. = Bills of sale in the 21st century = In the twenty-first century, bills of sale are overwhelmingly used in the form of so-called “logbook loans”. These are security bills secured on the borrower’s vehicle. Borrowers transfer ownership of their car, van or motorcycle to the logbook lender as security for the loan. While making repayments, borrowers keep possession of their vehicle and continue to use it. Borrowers hand the logbook lender the V5C registration document – or “logbook” – but this is purely symbolic and has no legal effect. = Criticism and reform of the law = The law of bills of sale has been criticised on a number of occasions. The Crowther report in 1971Report of the committee on consumer credit (1971) Cmnd 4596. and the Diamond report in 1986A Diamond, A review of security interests in property (1989) both considered the Acts, with the latter recommending repeal. In its consultation paper, the Law Commission made a number of criticisms of the law as it stood in 2015. It proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgages Act. In its consultation paper, the Law Commission identified five key problems with the Bills of Sale Acts: * undue complexity; * highly technical documentation; * the registration regime is in need of modernisation; * they offer little protection to borrowers; * they offer no protection to third party purchasers. The Law Commission proposed to replace the Bills of Sale Acts with a new Goods Mortgage Act that would address each of the criticisms identified in the consultation paper.

Mainly an office building, it also contains an internal shopping arcade and the entrance to an underground station. It was built between 1924 and 1932, damaged by a bomb in 1941, and later restored to its original condition under the supervision of one of its original architects. The building, its design influenced by the Italian Renaissance and incorporating features of the American Beaux-Arts style, occupies an entire block in the city. History India Buildings was built between 1924 and 1932. The competition for its design was won in 1923 by Arnold Thornely and Herbert J. Rowse, the assessor being Giles Gilbert Scott. It was built as a speculative venture by the shipping firm of Richard Durning Holt and Alfred Holt and Company (the Blue Funnel Line) partly for its own use, and partly for letting offices to other businesses. It was built by Dove Brothers of Islington, its steelwork being made and erected by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough. The cost of the building was £1.25 million (equivalent to £ in ). The building replaced an older one on the site known as \\"India Building\\", built in the 1830s for George Holt, the father of Alfred. The new building was constructed in two stages, the first stage being alongside the earlier building, and the second stage demolishing and replacing it. The two stages straddled the former Chorley Street. Before the design was approved, Liverpool Corporation stipulated that an arcade of shops should run through the centre of the building on the route of the street, and this was incorporated into the design. The original occupants included Lloyds Bank, a post office, commercial and insurance companies, solicitors, and government offices. Alfred Holt and Company occupied most of the sixth, seventh and eighth floors. Also in the building were a public hall and a constitutional club. India Buildings was badly damaged by bombing in 1941, and was later restored to its original condition under the supervision of Herbert J. Rowse. The property became involved in one of the UK's largest fraud cases when it was used as collateral for large loans made by a company operated by Achilleas Kallakis and Alexander Williams. They had arranged for loans to be made in excess of the value of the buildings. This money was used to finance an expensive lifestyle including a helicopter and a plane. India buildings was sold to an Irish company called Green Property in 2009 who still owned it in January 2013 when the former owners, Kallakis and Williams were jailed for fraud. In August 2017 it was announced that British multinational financial services company, Legal & General had bought India Buildings. HMRC will lease ten floors of the building to house a new Regional Centre. Around 3,500 HMRC staff were expected to start moving into the building when renovation work was completed in 2019. The plans were delayed when 400 tonnes of asbestos were discovered during the works. A new contractor was bought in to carry out the redevelopment work in September 2019 with the new tenants hoping to move in during 2020. The package of work being carried out includes repairing and cleaning the façade, removing more than 50% of office ceilings, re-lining the cast iron drainage system, refurbishing ornate windows and replacing the existing 8 lifts and the addition of 5 new lifts. Architecture =Exterior= The building occupies a whole block, and is surrounded by Water Street, Brunswick Street, Fenwick Street, and Drury Lane. It has nine storeys, a mezzanine, a basement and a sub-basement. The building is constructed on a steel frame and is clad in Portland stone. It is roofed in green Lombardic tiles. The main entrance is on Water Street, this front having 13 bays. The entrance itself consists of three tall arches that are flanked by four bronze lamps, made by the Bromsgrove Guild, their design being based on those at the Palazzo Strozzi in Florence. Over the entrance is an ornamental balcony. At the basement level are four decorative shop fronts, and to the right of these is an entrance to the James Street underground station. The Brunswick Street front is similar, except that its entrance has one arch rather than three. The Fenwick Street front and the Drury Lane front have 15 and 14 bays respectively. =Sculpture= All the sculpture on the exterior of the building is by Edmund C. Thompson. The keystones in the arches over the doorways and above some of the windows are carved with cherubs. Rather than all being identical, their designs are slightly varied. A frieze runs around the building just below the level of the top floor windows. On both the Water Street and the Brunswick Street fronts and incorporated in the frieze are crests, each of which is carved with a figure of Neptune kneeling in a scallop shell, and two reclining Tritons, reflecting the building's maritime connections. =Interior= A shopping arcade runs through the centre of the building, with offices on all floors. The entrances in Water Street and Brunswick Street lead into foyers. Each foyer has three painted and coffered saucer domes in the ceiling, supported by fluted Ionic columns in Travertine marble. There are doors to two lifts on each side. The shopping arcade has Travertine walls and floors, and a coffered barrel-vaulted ceiling with pendant lights. Along the sides of the arcade are shops with decorative bronze fronts. Elsewhere on the ground floor are larger areas originally occupied by the bank, the Post Office and the public hall. The upper floors contain offices, some of which have retained their original layout, while others have been altered. Public access to the arcade will be closed as part of the deal to move in 3,500 HMRC staff, with HMRC citing security reasons for the proposed decision. Appraisal India Buildings was designated as a Grade II listed building on 14 March 1975. Following a campaign by the Twentieth Century Society, its designation was raised to Grade II* on 5 November 2013. One of the reasons given for this elevation in status is its transatlantic influence, reflecting Liverpool's historic links with the United States, stating that it \\"emulates the most impressive early 20th-century commercial buildings of the US\\", particularly those in New York. Other reasons include its architectural interest, including influences from the Italian Renaissance and the American Beaux-Arts movement, and the eminence of its architects. Also noted are its planning interest, in that it follows the United States grid system of town planning, the high quality of its internal finishes, its degree of survival with its major elements having been retained, and its group value with the nearby listed buildings.

It was based at Idlewild Airport (now New York JFK Airport) with five Douglas DC-6 aircraft in the fleet. Its main function was to carry US military personnel to and from Europe from the east coast of the USA. ONA also had a dedicated Douglas DC-7F for freight operations. For a brief period from 1964 to 1965, ONA went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy to reorganize. Flights resumed in October 1965, this time operating Douglas DC-8 aircraft. Operations expanded to include flights to the Caribbean, Europe and India. Beginning in 1968, ONA acquired 11 secondhand Lockheed L-188 Electra turboprops, which were used for freight operations. The DC-8s serviced trans-Atlantic routes. The airline then acquired McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 jetliners, which replaced the Electras. In 1973 two McDonnell Douglas DC-10 widebody jetliners were acquired. In 1978 when airline deregulation went into effect, the board of directors decided to liquidate the airline. Due to the value of the company's DC-10s, this was successful. ONA ceased operations in October 1978.Airlines Remembered by BI Hengi, Publisher Midland Publishing = Second ONA = The second airline to be named Overseas National Airways was created when officials of Overseas National Airways formed a FAR Part 129 leasing company known as United Air Carriers on July 21, 1977. When Overseas National Airways folded in 1978, the company was renamed Overseas National Airways and it was certified in 1980 under FAR 121 as a cargo and passenger charter company. In 1982 the company gained approval for scheduled service, leading to the company purchasing the name National Airlines from Pan American World Airways in anticipation of scheduled New York to Paris service. The scheduled service never materialized, although charter flights were flown on the route. Due to financial problems the airline ceased operations in December 1985, filing for bankruptcy in May 1986.  Incidents  * On 2 May 1970, ALM Flight 980 was operated by ONA with a DC-9-30 named \\"Caribbean Queen\\", from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York to St. Maarten in the Caribbean. Several failed attempts to land in bad weather at St. Maarten, followed by a decision to divert to St. Croix, forced the flight crew to ditch the aircraft after running out of fuel. 23 of the 63 people on board were killed. Caribbean Queen is still at the bottom of the sea. * On 12 November 1975, ONA Flight 032, a DC-10 on a ferry flight to Frankfurt Airport, suffered a bird strike while on its takeoff roll at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. The aircraft was destroyed, but all 139 people on board survived. * On 2 January 1976, an ONA DC-10 experienced an undershoot of the short runway at Istanbul. A fire occurred in the #1 engine after the aircraft touched down and crash-landed. It was not the cause of the crash. The aircraft was destroyed. All passengers survived.

Announced in December 1988, they replaced Fujitsu's earlier FACOM VP Model E Series. The VP2000 was succeeded in 1995 by the VPP300, a massively parallel supercomputer with up to 256 vector processors. The VP2000 was similar in many ways to their earlier designs, and in turn to the Cray-1, using a register- based vector processor for performance. For additional performance the vector units supported a special multiply-and-add instruction that could retire two results per clock cycle. This instruction \\"chain\\" is particularly common in many supercomputer applications. Another difference is that the main scalar units of the processor ran at half the speed of the vector unit. According to Amdahl's Law computers tend to run at the speed of their slowest unit, and in this case unless the program spent most of its time in the vector units, the slower scalar performance would make it 1/2 the performance of a Cray-1 at the same speed. The reason for this seemingly odd \\"feature\\" is unclear. One of the major complaints about the earlier VP series was their limited memory bandwidth—while the machines themselves had excellent performance in the processors, they were often starved for data. For the VP2000 series this was addressed by adding a second load/store unit to the scalar units, doubling memory bandwidth. Several versions of the machines were sold at different price points. The low-end VP2100 ran at an 8 ns cycle time and delivered only 0.5 GFLOPS (about 4-8 times the performance of a Cray), while the VP2200 and VP2400 decreased the cycle time to 4 ns and delivered between 1.25 and 2.5 GFLOPS peak. The high-end VP2600 ran at 3.2 ns and delivered 5 GFLOPS. All of the models came in the /10 versions with a single scalar processor, or the /20 with a second, while the 2200 and 2400 also came in a /40 configuration with four. Due to the additional load/store units, adding additional scalar units improved performance by increasing memory bandwidth, as well as allowing several programs to run at the same time and thereby increase the chance there was something to process on the vector unit. Each unit is said to increase performance 1.5 times, allowing the VP2400/40 to match the performance of the earlier VP2600/20. The machines were supplied with either the Unix-compatible UXP/M or the MVS-compatible VSP/S operating systems, both supplied by Amdahl. The later was used for Fortran programs while the former was typically used for C, and vectorizing compilers were supplied for both languages. Like most companies, Fujitsu turned to massive parallelism for future machines, and the VP2000 family were not on the market for very long. Nevertheless, over 100 were sold, and in July 1993, there were 180 installed.

Band members include Sally Ellyson (vocals), Dan Messé (piano, accordion, glockenspiel), Gary Maurer (guitar, mandolin), Steve Curtis (guitar, mandolin, banjo, back-up vocals), George Rush (bass guitar), Mark Brotter (drums), Bob Hoffnar (pedal steel guitar), and Heather Zimmerman (violin). The group sometimes expands to include other musicians and orchestral accompaniments. Their music has been variously described as \\"folk\\", \\"indie\\", \\"Americana\\" and \\"roots\\". Stylistically, their songs bridge 19th-century American parlour music, Appalachian folk music, gospel music, traditional American ballads, the European art song, early jazz and even contemporary classical music. Band history In 1999, songwriter Dan Messé and producer Gary Maurer teamed up and decided to produce a record. A mutual friend, Steve Curtis, joined them. None of them knew any potential singing talents for the band, so they placed an advertisement in The Village Voice. Overwhelmed by an onslaught of bizarre and unlistenable demo tapes, the three friends soon abandoned their quest. Months later Sally Ellyson called Messé in response to the ad, cautioning that she was not really a \\"singer\\". A skeptical Messé asked Ellyson for a demo tape and was greatly surprised when he heard the very spare recording, which featured Ellyson's a cappella renditions of several old-time lullabies that she had recorded for the infant son of a long-time friend. Messé was impressed -- and Hem had finally found itself a singer. Ellyson was soon whisked into New York recording studio, Stratosphere sound, to record vocals on tracks that would later become the album Rabbit Songs. Several of Ellyson's lullabies have since surfaced on subsequent Hem releases. Rabbit Songs opened with the lullaby \\"Lord, Blow the Moon Out, Please.\\" from the original demo tape. Eveningland featured \\"Now the Day is Over\\" as a hidden track (after the song \\"Carry Me Home\\"), and No Word From Tom opened with yet another lullaby, \\"All the Pretty Horses.\\" Rabbit Songs was widely acclaimed in the U.S. music press. The album received glowing praise in a feature story on NPR's \\"All Things Considered\\" and garnered an enthusiastic review from Entertainment Weekly. Allmusic described the album as having an \\"effortlessly timeless appeal\\". Including overseas releases, the album has been issued and reissued a total of eight times as of 2006. Problems at Hem's new label, DreamWorks Records, delayed the release of the band's second album. Finally, in late 2004, Eveningland was released on Rounder Records. Eveningland capitalized on the success of Rabbit Songs, enjoying positive reviews in the U.S. from the likes of Pitchfork Media as well as from international media outlets, such as the BBC. In early 2006, Hem's third album, No Word From Tom, was released by Nettwerk. In much the same vein as the band's EP I'm Talking With My Mouth, No Word From Tom showcased a collection of cover songs, live versions of original songs from prior albums, and some new material. Later in 2006, Hem received a career boost when the song \\"Half-Acre\\", from Rabbit Songs, was featured in a television commercial for Liberty Mutual insurance, which brought their music to many who might not otherwise have heard it. In May 2007, in a follow-up campaign, Liberty Mutual used Hem's music once again, debuting a new song, \\"The Part Where You Let Go.\\" Hem's fourth album, Funnel Cloud, was released on September 5, 2006. Funnel Cloud was recorded with a 21-piece orchestra, and with help from the likes of former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha and Ollabelle vocalist Amy Helm (daughter of Levon Helm). One of the songs from the album, \\"Not California\\", was subsequently featured on NPR's \\"All Songs Considered.\\" In 2007, the band received another career boost when they played with the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall, for the Boston Pops' annual event Edgefest. The band provided the music for the 2009 Public Theater production of Shakespeare's \\"Twelfth Night\\" at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, featuring Anne Hathaway in the role of Viola. The band received a nomination for Outstanding Music in a Play for the 2009/2010 Drama Desk Awards. The band released the album Departure and Farewell in 2013. A short UK tour took place in October 2013, along with a session on Bob Harris's Sunday Show on BBC Radio 2.

While little of his music survives, he is notable for his innovative keyboard and church music writing. He was also politically active, a mayor, Member of Parliament, and Alderman.  Music career  Little is known about the early life of this important early Tudor composer, and his date and place of birth are currently unknown. However, on 27 November 1510 he supplicated for the degree of BMus at Oxford University, proposing for his examination an oration on the volumes of Boethius, and the submission (and performance) of a mass and an antiphon.Tudor Church Music vol. X, Hugh Aston, John Marbeck,and Osbert Parsley, p.xiv. London, Oxford University Press, 1929. He stated that he had studied music in the University Music School for eight years (suggesting that he must have been in his mid-20s by that date, hence the estimated date of birth of around 1485). Presumably his study of Boethius was of the 6th century philosopher's De Institutione Musica, which had been published in Venice in 1491 and 1492 (one of the first musical works to be published).Boethius, Anicius Manlius Severinus, De Institutione Musica. Translated, with Introduction and Notes as Fundamentals of Music by Calvin M. Bower. Edited by Claude V. Palisca. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1989. The University records show that his examination was successful,Oxford University: Register of Congregations. Oxford History Society vol. 38 (N.S.) pp. 106–7. and the University ordered that the University Proctors supervising the examination should retain the two manuscripts. It seems most likely that these were Aston's five part Missa Te Deum Laudamus and the clearly associated antiphon Te Deum Laudamus. Though the original manuscripts are not in Music School archives today, excellent early copies of ca. 1528–30 almost certainly made for Cardinal's College (now Christ Church) Oxford are in the Forrest-Heather Part BooksDigital Image Library of Medieval Music: Forrest-Heather Part Book – taken from Census-Catalogue of Manuscript Sources of Polyphonic Music 1400–1550, 5 vols. (Neuhausen-Stuttgart, 1979–1988. now in the Bodleian Library, Oxford. After 1510 he may have lived in London, and it is suggested that he may have had some association with the court of Henry VIII. In 1520/21 he was paid by the Dean and Chapter of the Collegiate Church of St Mary, Warwick, to advise on the purchase and installing of a new organ. By 1525 at the latest Aston was settled and working in Leicester, as a verbatim record of his evidence given to a Bishop's Visitation on 27 & 28 November 1525 is preserved in the Lincoln Diocesan Records, and he seems to have stayed in Leicester for the rest of his life. His appointment in Leicester was that of Keeper of the Organs and Magister Choristerorum (Master of the Choristers) at the major Royal foundation, the Hospital and College of St Mary of the Annunciation. This was first established by Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster in 1330, and re-endowed and substantially enlarged by his son Henry, 4th Earl and later 1st Duke of Lancaster under a Charter of 24 March 1355/6. Later known as The Newarke, the institution had a Dean and twelve Canons (later termed Prebends), thirteen Vicars-Choral, four Lay Clerks and six (boy) choristers. By the late 15th century it had achieved a high status and musical reputation and had acquired the privilege, apparently shared only with the Chapels Royal, of having the right to recruit outstanding musicians and singers from other institutions without their consent, in other words to poach the very best musicians of the country. Perhaps the already highly regarded Aston was himself recruited by The Newarke using this privilege, but there seems to be no surviving documentary evidence of exactly how or when he came to be engaged by the Leicester Choral College. The Charters required among many other things the use of the Salisbury (\\"Sarum\\") Rite, a daily sung Mass in honour of Our Lady, and also the singing of Matins, a High Mass and Vespers on more than two dozen high feasts, led by the Dean in Choir, so there would have been a heavy musical programme for the choir of around sixteen (including at least some of the Vicars) and its musical director. His initial salary was £10 a year (only £2 a year less than that of the Dean) and by 1540 this had increased to £12 a year. In addition Aston, also referred to in some documents as a singer and organist, was entitled to receive further significant payments for additional services such as funerals. In 1525 he had been recommended to Cardinal Wolsey as the founder director of music at his new Cardinal's College, Oxford, (now Christ Church College and Cathedral) but Aston seems to have declined the offer and in any event Wolsey appointed John Taverner instead. Aston continued at The Newarke until shortly before the final dissolution of the Foundation at Easter 1548, and on retirement he received a £12-a-year state pension in respect of his Newarke College office. By this time he must have been holding at least advisory positions at a number of other important Midlands choral institutions, since he also received further state pensions totalling £6 13s. 4d. in respect of loss of office at six other suppressed choral institutions: Sully and Pipewell in Northamptonshire, Coventry and Kenilworth in Warwickshire, and the Leicestershire abbeys of Launde and St Mary de Pratis (= Leicester Abbey).The History of the Hospital and the New College of the Annunciation of St Mary in The Newarke, Leicester, A. Hamilton Thompson. Leicester: Leicestershire Archaeological Society, 1937 Political career Before 1530 a Hugh Aston, almost certainly the musician as there are no others of the same name recorded in 16th century Leicester, was already representing the Southgates Ward in which he lived as a member of the Town council and later as a Borough Alderman, and by 1550 the Ward was even being referred to in the Leicester Borough Records as \\"the Ward of Mr Hugh Aston\\". From 1532 he was a Justice of the Peace, Coroner for two years, Auditor of Accounts for a total of 16 years, Mayor for 1541–1542, one of the two Members of Parliament for the Borough for the 1555 Parliament, and remained an Alderman to his death. Death The exact date of this is not known, but he was buried on 17 November 1558 in the parish church for the Southgates Ward, St Margaret's. On 15 November 2008 a 450th anniversary Commemorative Service was held in St Margaret's, featuring two of Aston’s surviving antiphons, the two known keyboard pieces and much of the Sarum Rite plainsong music for the Requiem Mass of the pre-Reformation Sarum liturgy, which had been restored by Queen Mary.Hugh Aston (c. 1485–1558): Composer and Mayor of Leicester, Patrick J Boylan. Leicestershire Historian no. 44, pp. 26–30, 2008. Residence In Leicester the College provided him with a rent-free house just outside the South Gate of the Borough more or less directly opposite the main gate of The Newarke in the Borough's First (soon to be renamed Southgates) Ward. It seems likely that before or at the time of the dissolution of the College the property passed to Aston or his family and what was presumably the same property seems to have remained his family's home to at least his grandson's time in the early 17th century. Most of the buildings of the medieval Hospital and College of the Newarke, including the Collegiate Church much admired by Leland during his visit in ca. 1535, were demolished soon after the Dissolution, and the campus of De Montfort University today covers almost the whole site. In March 2015 the University opened a new DMU Heritage Centre incorporating the remaining ruins of the Church of the Annunciation together with displays explaining the history of the Newarke area. On 17 March 2010 Patrick McKenna, founder and Chief Executive of Ingenious Media, declared open De Montfort University's new £35 million Faculty of Business and Law, adjacent to the great Gateway to The Newarke and only 100 metres or so from the site of Aston's Hangman's Lane house: this new building is called the Hugh Aston Building. The event was also marked by performances by singers from the choir of the Holy Cross Dominican Priory, New Walk, Leicester (directed by David Cowen) of sections from Aston's Te Deum Mass and Te Deum, two of Aston's keyboard compositions, and some of the 'Sarum Rite' medieval plainsong for 17 March – St. Patrick's Day.  Works  Four sacred vocal compositions by Aston survive substantially complete: * Missa Te Deum (five voices) * Missa Videte manus meas (six voices) *Gaude mater matris Christe (five voices) *Te Deum laudamus (five voices) Other compositions survive in fragments. In addition, he wrote keyboard music, most of which shows an unusually progressive use of idiomatic keyboard: his Hornepype in particular is often cited as an example of early idiomatic keyboard writing. Some other famous early keyboard pieces have been attributed to him on stylistic grounds, including the often-recorded and anthologized My Lady Careys Dompe.

All receipts must have the date of purchase on them. If the recipient of the payment is legally required to collect sales tax or VAT from the customer, the amount would be added to the receipt and the collection would be deemed to have been on behalf of the relevant tax authority. In many countries, a retailer is required to include the sales tax or VAT in the displayed price of goods sold, from which the tax amount would be calculated at point of sale and remitted to the tax authorities in due course. Similarly, amounts may be deducted from amounts payable, as in the case of taxes withheld from wages. On the other hand, tips or other gratuities given by a customer, for example in a restaurant, would not form part of the payment amount or appear on the receipt. In some countries, it is obligatory for a business to provide a receipt to a customer confirming the details of a transaction. In most cases, the recipient of money provides the receipt, but in some cases the receipt is generated by the payer, as in the case of goods being returned for a refund. A receipt is not the same as an invoice. There is usually no set form for a receipt, such as a requirement that it be machine generated. Many point-of-sale terminals or cash registers can automatically produce receipts. Receipts may also be generated by accounting systems, be manually produced or generated electronically, for example if there is not a face-to-face transaction. To reduce the cost of postage and processing, many businesses do not mail receipts to customers, unless specifically requested or required by law, with some transmitting them electronically. Others, to reduce time and paper, may endorse an invoice, account or statement as \\"paid\\". Process =Shop receipts= A receipt from a restaurant, which includes a list of purchased items, along with prices in two currencies and a 7.6% tax levied. Also included are contact and tax information about the business. The practice in most shops at the point of sale is for a salesperson to scan or in some way record the price of a customer's proposed purchases, including tax, discounts, credits and other adjustments. In traditional situations and still in some family businesses today, the salesperson would then show the customer the summary, the invoice, for their agreement; but many shops today bypass this stage. The practice of presenting an invoice is most common in restaurants where a \\"bill\\" is presented after a meal. The salesperson would indicate to the customer (whether by way of an invoice or otherwise) the total amount payable, and the customer would indicate the proposed method of payment of the amount. Payment in cash or by payment is regarded as payment of the amount tendered, but payment by store account is not. After processing the payment, the salesperson would then generate in the one document an invoice and receipt. If payment was made by a payment card, a payment record would normally also be generated. The invoice and receipt are the printed record of the transaction and are legal documents. A copy of these documents would normally be handed to the customer, though this step may be dispensed with. In many countries, a retailer may be under a legal obligation to provide a receipt to a customer which shows the details of a transaction and the shop and other information, so that the tax authority can check that sales and related taxes are not being hidden. The document may also include messages from the retailer, warranty or return details, special offers, advertisements or coupons, but these are merely promotional and not part of the formal receipt. =Other receipts= Receipts may also be provided for non-retail operations such as banking transactions. =Barcodes= Shops that use barcode readers may generate receipts with a barcode of the receipt identification number, that enables a salesperson to scan the barcode and quickly retrieve the details of the original transaction, for example: if a customer seeks to return or exchange goods or there is some other query. =Customer history= If linked to a customer shop account, some retailers' point-of-sale systems also allow the salesperson to see a complete record of the customer's buying history. A receipt (or a copy of a receipt) is the proof of purchase usually needed to make a return and often plays a vital part in a company's return and exchange policy. Recipients An invoice goes to the person responsible for paying the bill while the shipping list (or packaging slip) goes to the recipient. The shipping list is included in the shipped box. In some scenarios, the same person will pay the bill and receive the shipment. However, a person can buy and pay for a product and send it to someone else (i.e. a gift). Shipping list details Shipping lists vary depending on the business and its products. Every shipment to a customer should contain a shipping list that includes the order date, the products included within the box, and the quantity of each product. Some businesses may want to include the weight of the product next to the item. Many receivers use the shipping list as a guide or checklist when unpacking their order. If something is missing from the box, they cross-check it with the shipping list and then alert the seller. Manual receipts Hand-written or hand-completed receipts are more often used for infrequent or irregular transactions, or for transactions conducted in the absence of a terminal, cash register or point of sale: for example, as provided by a landlord to a tenant to record the receipt of rent. It can also be required when company representatives buy goods, because tax deduction rules might require hand signed receipts. Related industries Organizing receipts and similar financial documents is a multimillion-dollar industry in the United States. Consumers can use both desktop and online software to organize electronic receipts; sometimes, receipts are sent digitally from point of sale devices directly to consumers. The growing trend of digital receipts has led to the launch of new businesses focused on digital receipt management.

It was released for the PlayStation in 2000 for Japan and North America, and 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in Japan and parts of Asia in 2003 and for the PlayStation Portable in 2005. The game features Mega Man Volnutt's quest to find four keys hidden in the planet in order to aid in the search of the Mother Lode, a legendary treasure thought to be an infinite energy source. A demo of the game was originally featured in the spin-off The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, with its purpose being to show an overview of the gameplay of the title despite having an independent story. Critical reception to Mega Man Legends 2 has overall been positive with video game publications praising how the graphics and the gameplay improved over the ones from its prequel. Additionally, the game's story was praised for how complex it is in comparison to the ones from the original series. Gameplay The gameplay in Mega Man Legends 2 is very similar to that of its predecessor and has a few changes. The player controls the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt in his explorations through ruins and fights against Reaverbots. The ruins, however, are from various islands in contrast to the prequel in which most ruins belonged to Kattelox Island. The player is able to travel to other islands with Roll's ship, the Flutter, although he can only enter certain islands by completing different missions.Capcom (2000), p. 16 Unlike Mega Man Legends in which the player could enter to different ruins by having the approval of Kattelox's mayor, here the player must pass different tests in order to win Digger licenses from a specific level. The license allows Mega Man to enter into ruins which are forbidden to lower-class Diggers. Additionally, when winning a license, the Reaverbots' health is higher, but once they are destroyed, they drop more refractors' shards which are used in shops to buy items. Mega Man's interactions with other characters can also affect the character's state depending whether he is good with other people or makes them angry.Capcom (2000), p. 23 Mega Man is also able to grab objects or people which help the player to complete missions.Capcom (2000), p. 7 Mega Man can also suffer from special damage when fighting Reaverbots or touching fields that damage him such as lava. If the player equips Mega Man with a specific body part, he will become invulnerable to such states. Another addition is the underwater dungeon, in where the objects' weight is reduced and Mega Man can jump higher.Capcom (2000), p. 13 The energy of the special weapons, which are developed by Roll using unusable items, are now shown in two energy bars, one green and one blue. The blue bar indicates how much energy the weapon has, while the green bar shows how much energy is consumed when the weapon is used.Capcom (2000), p. 11 Plot =Setting and characters= Mega Man Legends 2 brings back several characters from its predecessor. This includes the protagonist Mega Man Volnutt (whose original name is Mega Man Trigger), a Digger in charge of exploring ruins to find Refractors,Capcom (2000), p. 18 Roll Caskett, his spotter, who is searching for her missing parents,Capcom (2000), p. 19 and Data, a mechanical monkey who contains all of Mega Man's original memories. Roll's grandfather, Barrel Caskett, also appears alongside his old friend Werner Von Bluecher in search of the Mother Lode, a legendary treasure supposed to have infinite energy. The pirates \\"the Bonnes\\", made up of siblings Teisel, Tron, and Bon, return once again as antagonists of the series but allied with three new members:Capcom (2000), p. 20 a blonde-haired man named Glyde previously seen in The Misadventures of Tron Bonne who uses Birdbots as servants,Capcom (2000), p. 21 and Bola and Klaymoor, a floating samurai and an enormous man wearing armor, respectively.Capcom (2000), p. 22 Other characters include Yuna and Sera, whose purposes remain unknown during the game's start, as well as the Master: a 3000-year-old man who is referred to as the last \\"true\\" human. =Story= A news conference is held by Professor Barrel Caskett and his old friend Werner Von Bluecher about the upcoming journey to the Forbidden Island in a large airship called the Sulphur Bottom to search for the Mother Lode. Barrel recognizes a reporter, Yuna, as his lost daughter, Matilda Caskett, who warns them of the catastrophe that could transpire if they pursue their journey. Yuna escapes with her servant, a Reaverbot flying machine-like being named Gatz to break the windows for her escape. Ignoring her warning Bluecher continues to the center of the island. Yuna orders Gatz to give warning shots but due to the hostile retaliation of the Sulphur Bottom, Gatz damages the engine, forcing the airship to descend to the island below. Mega Man Volnutt and Roll Caskett watch the events from television and decide to rescue them. With Roll's help, Mega Man makes his way to the center of the island and in the process releases a girl called Sera and her servant Geetz, both of whom go to the Sulphur Bottom. Geetz tells Bluecher and Barrel that the Mother lode can be accessed by means of four keys. Bluecher and Barrel ask Mega Man if he could retrieve the keys before the Pirates who heard their conversation with Geetz. Mega Man along with Roll set forth to find the four Keys in the Manda, Nino, Saul Kada and Calinca Ruins, while battling the Pirates, most often the Bonne Family, along the way. When Mega Man returns with the final key to the Sulphur Bottom, Sera orders Geetz to attack the ship and take the keys. Yuna appears in the ship and orders Gatz to fight Geetz. Mega Man stumbles upon Yuna, who then gives some reminder about his former life and explains to him the terrible catastrophe she was trying to prevent: Sera's plans for the execution of the \\"Carbon Reinitialization Program\\", meant to kill every human from Terra and revive the original humans. Soon after, Mega Man reaches the deck of the Sulphur Bottom and sees Gatz defeated by Geetz. Mega Man is able to defeat Geetz, who, using his last forces, seriously damages Mega Man. While recovering, Mega Man starts to explore his past. In his dreams he sees himself and a man known as \\"Master\\" going to Terra and giving Mega Man his \\"Genetic Code\\" before dying and requesting that Mega Man destroy the system that can start the Carbon Reinitialization Program. Yuna tells Mega Man to choose whether to follow what the System wants him to do or oppose it. Mega Man then takes a flight in a ship merged with Gatz heading for the planet Elysium with Yuna. In Elysium, Mega Man reaches the room where the Carbon Reinitialization Program is to be executed from. Sera then appears in the form of a robot to Mega Man and states that she did not execute the Carbon Reinitialization Program but has, instead, been waiting for Mega Man's arrival to challenge him in hopes that by defeating him she would prove that their master liked her more. In battle, Gatz tries to aid Mega Man by attacking Sera's logic circuits, but dies in the attempt. As Mega Man defeats Sera, Yuna arrives at the scene reminding Sera that it is not their Master's wish for her to die. Sera awakes in Yuna's real body and decides to help Yuna protect the Carbons from the machines that are being activated in Terra due to an old system Master tried to stop. However, due to Gatz's death, Mega Man, Sera and Yuna are now stranded in Elysium with no means of transporting back to Terra any time soon. The game ends with Roll and other characters working together to build a rocket to rescue Mega Man from Elysium. Development In 1999, Capcom announced that the series' spin- off, The Misadventures of Tron Bonne, would include a demo of the game. The demo was meant to show off the game's improved graphics and a larger scale universe. The demo, titled , features an independent story in which Tron has kidnapped Roll and Mega Man sets to rescue her. It was only included in the Japanese version of the game and the PlayStation Portable port of the game. The game was released for the PlayStation in 2000 in Japan, as a regular release and another one under the label of \\"PlayStation the Best\\". It was later released in 2000 in North America and in 2001 in Europe. Unchanged Japanese ports of the game were also released for the PC in 2001. In September 2005, Capcom ported the game to the PlayStation Portable but it was only published in Japan. Like the preceding game, the music was composed by Makoto Tomozawa with the ending theme used in the Japanese version being Hara Fumina's . In October 2009, Capcom released , which is composed of a soundtrack including 17 tracks from the game and an artbook. The artbook also shows characters which were not featured in the game with all of them sharing the name of Mega Man like Mega Man Volnutt and Mega Man Juno. Producer Keiji Inafune comments that he was asked by several fans if a sequel to Mega Man Legends 2 would be made. Inafune expressed desire in making, but at first stated that he could not do it. Reception The game was generally well received by critics in comparison to its predecessor. GameSpot directly stated that with Legends 2s release, Capcom was able to turn \\"what began as a mere spin-off into a worthy stand-alone franchise\\", while Allgame's Jon Thompson stated it \\"trumps its predecessor in almost every way, and shows that Capcom is certainly learning from its mistakes in the genre\\". IGN's Adam Cleveland mentioned Mega Man Legends 2 was \\"the most involving game I've seen with Mega Man, and is one of the best, too\\". Publications commented that the gameplay was highly improved and that the variations of controls helped the players. Despite being compared with other games such as the ones from the Zelda franchise , the dungeons and missions were praised. Bosses fights were also found to be entertaining although some of the bosses' height are larger than the ones featured in the prequel. Famitsu found that the game's overall sense of action was superior to the first incarnation, considering the ability to be assisted in missions by computer controlled characters as well as its mini- games and events. The graphics received a mixed to positive reception. The graphic design and style was praised, but still reviewers criticized that the level design was still blocky and primitive. The story and cutscene animation were universally praised, and compared to watching an anime. In comparison to the first game, the story was also found to be darker and deeper. Eurogamer also focused in this, finding the game's story to be a more \\"rolling narrative rather than a simple 'click the face, beat the boss, save the world' sort of cop-out\\" comparing it with the original 2D series. Sound effects and music were likewise well-received, with the exception of Mega Man's voice, which was derided as too feminine. Samuel Bass reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for Next Generation, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"A fun game held back by pig-headed camera design.\\" GameRankings had an average of 76.60% for the PS version, while Metacritic had 76 favorable reviews out of 100 for it. In a 2007 retrospective of the Mega Man series, Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com ranked Mega Man Legends 2 as \\"Worth it!\\", praising its graphical improvements over the first title and commenting that its unresolved ending is \\"one of gaming's greatest injustices\\". In a similar feature, GameSpot stated that the game could \\"fix lot of the flaws in the original and [Mega Man Legends 2] is a substantial improvement upon the Legends formula\\". 1UP.com analyzed Legends 2s ending and found it unfortunate as the plot involving the Elder System mentioned in the game's ending remained unresolved. The PlayStation version of Mega Man Legends 2 was the 139th best- selling video game in Japan in 2000 at 88,131 units sold. The PSP version of the game barely made it into the Famitsu top 500 best-sellers list in Japan for 2005 at a mere 15,309 units sold by the end of the year.

It has good railway connections to London, Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton, from the nearby Havant railway station. There are many large gated detached houses on the main road, \\"Langstone Road\\" and on the roads surrounding this. It has a sailing club, several architecturally unusual buildings, and several historically significant buildings, including a converted (water) millhouse and a converted 18th century windmill, the latter of which is a local landmark. Geography The village surrounds \\"Langstone Road\\" which leads to Hayling Island. There is a technology park on Langstone Road and this is due to the connections of the road. It lies just off the A27 that provides quick links to Portsmouth, Southampton and Brighton. The A3(M) to London is also nearby and the distance to the M25 is about 45 miles. It is connected by Langstone Bridge, a single-carriageway road and footbridge, to Hayling Island to the South; this road (the A3023) is the only road connection from Hayling Island to the mainland. To the west of the road bridge the remains of the former railway bridge are visible; Langstone Harbour lies to the west of the railway bridge, Chichester Harbour to the east. The historic causeway to Hayling Island known as the Wadeway still exists, however it is now completely impassable, having been cut in two by a deep channel for the Portsmouth and Chichester Canal in the 1820s, the same company having subsequently funded the old wooden road bridge, served by a toll-house situated at the northern end. There was a weight-limit and after WW2 only single-decker buses were allowed across and if they were carrying too many passengers some had to get out and walk, regardless of the weather, to reduce axle-weight. The old wooden bridge was demolished following construction of the current (2014) concrete bridge in the late 1950s. The much earlier causeway was known as the wade way,Langstone - Wadeway Investigation and was classified as a bridleway in 1988, and is shown as such on modern Ordnance Survey maps in spite of its use being considered hazardous at best.Hampshire County Council Rights of Way Sub- Committee Minutes, 14 Jan 1988, ITEM 3(b)\\"Accessed 25 Nov 2009\\" Excavation of this feature in 2006, constructed on a natural high point in the harbour, put its date in the Roman to mediaeval range but found no evidence to be more specific.Chichester Harbour Conservancy \\"Changing Landscapes\\" project website \\"Accessed 25 Nov 2009\\" Citing unpublished reports by Maritime Archaeology Ltd, 2005, 2006, 2007 Chichester Wadeway Investigation Phases 1, 2, 3 respectively. The village High Street is designated as a Conservation Area (denoted by a blue plaque at the sea-end of the High Street), while the coastal path leading eastwards from the village is both part of Hampshire County Council's Solent Way and the same Councils' Wayfarers Walk. Thorney Island and Portsea Island are also both clearly visible from the village coast. =Pubs In Langstone= * The Royal Oak * The Ship Inn Architecture The flood defences on one building in Langstone Flooding can be a problem in the village, on occasion with water right up to the main Langstone Road, and many buildings on Langstone High Street have slots for wooden barriers on their door frames, and stack up sandbags. However flood risk to buildings is strictly limited to the older (pre-twentieth century) properties. Houses in the terrace on Langstone High Street date back to the 18th century and a number are thatched. The other significant buildings, commonly featured in local postcards, is Langstone Towers, characterised by a large lightning conductor. History The village used to have rail links with Hayling Island and Havant in the form of the Hayling Billy railway, however the lines have since been torn up and the route replaced with a cycle and bridlepath. The remains of the Hayling Billy rail bridge over to Hayling Island can still be seen. Etymology The name Langstone comes from Lang (compare the High German \\"lang\\") meaning \\"Long\\", and Stone with the same current-day usage.

Announced in July 1982, the FACOM VP were the first of the three initial Japanese commercial supercomputers, followed by the Hitachi HITAC S-810 in August 1982 and the NEC SX-2 in April 1983. Context in the supercomputer market The FACOM VP were sold until they were replaced by the VP2000 family in 1990. Developed with funding from the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, the FACOM VP was part of an effort designed to wrest control of the supercomputer market from the collection of small US-based companies like Cray Research. The FACOM VP was marketed in Japan by Fujitsu, where the majority of installations were located. Amdahl marketed the systems in the US and Siemens in Europe. The ending of the cold war during this period made the market for supercomputers dry up almost overnight, and the Japanese firms decided that their mass- production capabilities were better spent elsewhere. Development Fujitsu had built a prototype vector co-processor known as the F230-75, which was installed attached to their own mainframe machines in the Japanese Atomic Energy Commission and National Aerospace Laboratory in 1977. The processor was similar in most ways to the famed Cray-1, but did not have vector chaining capabilities and was therefore somewhat slower. Nevertheless, the machines were rather inexpensive, and during the late 1970s supercomputers were seen as a source of national pride, and an effort started to commercialize the design by combining it with a scalar processor to create an all-in-one design. The result was the VP-100 and VP-200, announced in July 1982. These two models differed primarily in clock rates. Lower-end models were spun off as the VP-30 and VP-50. In 1986 a two-pipeline version was released as the VP-400. The next year the entire series was updated with the addition of a new vector unit that supported a multiply-and-add unit that could retire two results per clock cycle. This resulted in the \\"E series\\", VP-30E through VP-400E. Issues with the design One problem with the design was the limited memory bandwidth as a result of having only one load-store unit. Even on the top-end VP-400E it could drive only 4.57 GB/s peak, limiting the maximum performance to only 0.5 GFLOPS for 64-bit operands. US designs focused on this problem in the early 1980s, and the contemporary Cray-2 could drive about 2 GB/s per processor, with up to four processors. References  R.W. Hockney; C.R. Jesshope (1988).

The tire failures are linked to 271 fatalities and over eight hundred injuries in the United States with more injuries and fatalities occurring internationally, it led Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford Motor Company to recall and replace 23 million tires, it cut the market value of Bridgestone/Firestone in half, Firestone closed the Decatur, Illinois factory where the tires were manufactured, several executives in Bridgestone and Ford resigned or were fired, it led Congress to pass the TREAD Act, and it brought an end to the nearly 100 year corporate relationship between Ford Motor Company and Firestone. Problem detection As early as 1996 personal injury lawyers were aware of accidents, injuries and fatalities caused by the tread of Firestone tires separating from the tire at high speeds. Lawyers and traffic safety researchers decided not to contact the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) because they lacked confidence in the agency and feared that an investigation might conclude that there were no defects thereby compromising existing personal injury lawsuits. All but 13 of the 271 fatalities from these tires took place after 1996. In 1996 the State of Arizona told Firestone that the tread on its tires were separating in high temperatures. Firestone sent several engineers to inspect the tires and concluded that normal passenger tires were being used in heavy conditions, on dirt roads, off-road, and under heavy loads. Firestone replaced those tires with heavier duty tires. Internal Firestone documents showed a rise in injury claims for ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires as early as 1997. In July 1998 Samuel Boyden, a researcher for State Farm Insurance, received a call from a claims handler asking for information about tread separation in Firestone tires. Boyden found 21 cases of accidents caused by tread separation and forwarded the information to NHTSA. In 1999 he found an additional 30 cases and forwarded that information to NHTSA. Sean Kane, a researcher at Strategic Safety Consulting, found documents showing that Ford had been replacing Firestone tires in Venezuela starting in 1998 where 46 deaths had occurred. Firestone was aware of tire defects in Venezuela as early as 1999. A Ford dealer in Saudi Arabia noticed high failure rates of Firestone tires in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait starting in 1997 and in July 1999 began replacing Firestone tires on unsold Ford Explorers and to offer a 75% discount for replacement tires when customers came in for maintenance. Ford and Firestone began testing tires in late 1997 or 1998 and began a limited recall in the Middle East, Venezuela, Malaysia, and Thailand in 1999 and the spring of 2000 but did not notify NHTSA. On February 7, 2000 KHOU-TV in Houston Texas ran a 9-minute story about high speed Firestone tire failures on Ford Explorers that led to 30 deaths. KHOU was overwhelmed by phone calls from concerned citizens and started directing callers to contact NHTSA. Clarence Ditlow, Executive Director for the Centre for Auto Safety, stated before the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation that, \\"Emerging Information shows that both Ford and Firestone had early knowledge of tread separation in Firestone Tires fitted to Ford Explorer vehicles but at no point informed NHTSA of their findings\\".Senate Committee On Commerce, Science And Transportation, Washington D.C., September 12, 2000 (from the Internet Archive) Firestone had more information about tire failures than Ford did because of warranty claims, but Firestone never acted on this information because it always blamed consumers for not maintaining their tires correctly or operating their vehicles in extreme environments, leading to these failures. When either Ford or NHTSA looked into concerns about tire failures or rollovers they always consulted consumer complaints to NHTSA's toll-free hotline. The consumer complaints didn't reflect the size of the problem because attorneys and their clients had almost completely stopped using the hotline to report tire failures or other complaints. Investigation and possible causes On March 6, 2000 NHTSA began a preliminary inquiry and on May 2, NHTSA began an investigation (PE00-020) concerning the high incidence of tire failures and accidents of Ford Explorers and other light trucks and SUVs fitted with Firestone Radial ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness tires. On August 9 Firestone recalled all ATX and ATX II tires and all Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Decatur, IL. On August 31, 2000 the Office of Defect Investigation (ODI) upgraded the investigation to an Engineering Analysis (EA00-023) to determine whether Firestone's recall covered all the defective tires. Ford and Firestone both issued root cause analyses to NHTSA. Firestone argued that vehicle weight, tire design, low recommended inflation pressure, and lower tire adhesion for tires manufactured at the Decatur, IL factory contributed to the tire failures. Ford argued that the tire design led to higher operating temperatures compared to similar tires manufactured by Goodyear and that differences in manufacturing at Decatur led to weaker tires that were more prone to failure. Ford also argued that the size of the wedge, a strip of rubber between the first and second belts, is smaller in Firestone tires than Michelin tires making them weaker than comparable Michelin tires. Publicly Firestone argued that Ford's recommended 26 psi inflation pressure was too low and should have been 30 psi. In addition Firestone argued that the Explorer was abnormally dangerous and prone to rollovers in the event of a tire failure, leading to more injuries and fatalities. In the words of Firestone CEO John Lampe, \\"When a driver of a vehicle has something happen such as a tread separation, they should be able to pull over not rollover.\\" Ford argued that the Explorer was no more dangerous than any other SUV and that the accident rate for Explorers with Goodyear tires was far lower than for Explorers with Firestone tires. Ford also argued that there was something wrong with the design of Firestone tires and with the manufacturing of those tires at the Decatur, IL factory. Some outside observers speculated that both parties were to blame suggesting that Firestone's tires being prone to tread separation and failure, and the Explorer was especially prone to rolling over if a tire fails at speed compared to other vehicles. = Ford Explorer = '91-'94 Ford Explorer 95-98 Ford Explorer The Ford Explorer was first offered for sale in March 1990. The Explorer was originally designed by taking an SUV cabin and attaching it to a Ford Ranger undercarriage. This cut the cost of producing the new Explorer because Ford could use existing facilities, parts, and robots and wouldn't have to design everything from scratch. This created problems though. Because the Explorer added more upper cabin weight to the already somewhat higher pickup chassis, it had a higher center of gravity and was more likely to roll over in the event of accident. It was also more likely to sway during sharp turns because it used the same leaf spring suspension that is found on the Ranger. The likelihood of a crash and likelihood of injuries and fatalities from a crash were greater in an SUV experiencing a tread separation than on a pickup truck. Ford came up with three options for correcting this problem; use shorter suspension springs to lower the vehicle half an inch in the front and 1 inch in the back, lower the tire pressure to give the Explorer a more car-like ride, or widen the wheel base by two inches which would involve a substantial redesign. After the Explorer rolled over in company tests prior to production Ford decided to lower the suspension and remove air from the tires to 26 psi compared to 35 psi for the same tires on the Ranger. They did not widen the wheel base. One consequence of lowering the tire pressure is increased tire temperatures which could lead to a tire failure. Firestone warrantied these tires at 26 psi for 11 years. The first generation Explorer had one of the lowest fuel economy ratings for any SUV available in the United States, due at least in part to Ford's recommended tire pressure. To fix the problem Ford reduced the amount of material in the roof of the Explorer for the second generation that went on sale beginning in 1995. The lighter roof was so weak that it would collapse under the weight of an overturned Explorer if the windshield were smashed in, a condition that often happened in rollover accidents. In addition Ford replaced the Twin I-Beam suspension with a lighter weight short and long-arm suspension, but didn't lower the engine. This had the effect of raising the Explorer's center of gravity making it more prone to rolling in an accident or sharp turn. After Ford Motor Company voluntarily recalled 13 million Firestone tires on May 21, 2001, Firestone requested that NHTSA investigate the handling and safety of Ford Explorers following a tread separation. Firestone argued that the Explorer is poorly designed and exhibits dangerous oversteer in the foreseeable event that a tire fails while driving. Firestone hired a consulting engineer to analyze the performance of the Ford Explorer and other SUVs during a tread separation, this report showed that the Explorer had a greater tendency to oversteer following a tread separation than other SUVs. NHTSA examined this report as well as real-world accident data and data provided by Ford concerning the design of the Explorer and denied Firestone's request. NHTSA stated that \\"[t]he many crashes following tread separations of tires on these vehicles that are documented in the Firestone claims database and that have been reported to ODI by consumers and others demonstrate that such a tire failure can lead to loss of control, particularly when it is a rear tire that fails and the vehicle is being driven at high speed. However, the fact that a vehicle exhibits linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire tread separation does not, in itself, indicate that the vehicle contains a safety-related defect. Moreover, the data available to ODI does not indicate that Explorers... are more likely to exhibit linear range oversteer characteristics following a rear tire tread separation than many of their peers.\\" The Explorer was redesigned for the 2002 model year. The tire pressure was raised to 30 psi, it was widened by 2.5 inches, the suspension was lowered, and independent rear suspension and electronic stability control were added. = Firestone tires = The tires that were involved in these accidents were P235/75R15 ATX and ATX II tires and P235/75R15 and P255/70R16 Wilderness AT tires. These tires were installed as OEM equipment on the Ford Explorer, Mercury Mountaineer, Ford Bronco, Ford Ranger, Ford F-series pickup trucks, Mazda B-series pickup trucks, and Mazda Navajo between 1991 and 2000. ATX tires were originally developed in the late 1980s for use on Ford light trucks and SUVs and were first installed on Ford trucks and SUVs in 1991. The ATX II was designed to improve the ATX's ride and the fuel economy of the Explorer. The Explorer had one of the lowest fuel economy ratings for any SUV under production at that time, due at least in part to the Ford's decision to lower the tire pressure to 26 psi,. Ford asked Firestone to reduce the weight of the ATX tires so that it could improve the fuel economy of the Explorer. Firestone created the ATX II by removing material from the tire which lowered the weight by 10%. Removing material from the ATX design also improved the profitability of the tire for Firestone. The Wilderness AT tire was developed in 1993 and was designed to have better snow handling and \\"irregular wear targets\\" and had a different tread design than the ATX tires. The Wilderness AT was sold and installed on Ford trucks from 1996 to 2000 and had a temperature and heat resistance rating of \\"C\\" which is the lowest rating allowed by the NHTSA's Uniform Tire Quality Grading System. Many of the features of the ATX tires were identical to the Wilderness AT tires. In May 1998 the Wilderness AT tires were redesigned with a thicker belt wedge (see Tire Design below) although the name of the tire was not changed. The defective ATX and ATX II tires were primarily manufactured at Firestone's Decatur, Illinois factory which produced tires with a significantly higher failure rate than the other two factories that manufactured these same tire models, Wilson, North Carolina and Joliette, Quebec. Wilderness AT tires manufactured before May 1998 had higher failure rates regardless of where they were manufactured and had a safety-related design defect according to NHTSA.  Tread separation  Cross section of a Firestone P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tire showing belt separation. Tire Tread Separation of a Firestone P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tire The failures all involved tread separation where the tire tread peeled off from the body of the tire. Tread separation, due to the interaction of steel and rubber tire elements, has been a challenge in radial tire design since their development by Michelin in 1946. The failure of the subject tires \\"begin as belt-edge separation at the edge of the second belt. This is the area of highest strain in a steel belted radial tire, primarily due to the structural discontinuity created by the abrupt change in modulus from steel to rubber.\\" Once a tread separation begins it can grow along the circumference of the tire or laterally across the width of the tire leading to cracks that grow between the belts. As separation progressed it could grow to form large crescent shaped areas along one or both sides of the tire. If those areas grew large enough they could separate catastrophically, especially at high speeds where the separation was aided by the centrifugal force of the spinning tire. Vehicles with tread-separating tires were difficult to control especially when the failing tire was on a rear wheel and when the vehicle was moving at a high rate of speed. A vehicle with a tread- separating rear tire will pull towards the side of the vehicle with the failed tire. The longer it takes the tread to separate the more the vehicle pulls in that direction. While the tread is separating the vehicle will oversteer while the tread-separating tire is on the outside of a turn. Once the tread separation has completed the vehicle will cease pulling in any direction. Tread separations for Firestone ATX, ATX II and Wilderness AT tires were significantly worse than for comparable tires manufactured by other companies including the Goodyear Wrangler RT/S which was also installed on new Ford Explorers. The tread-separating tire was most frequently the left-rear wheel of the vehicle, possibly because of additional heat from the exhaust, higher weight on the driver side because vehicles are often driven without any passengers, or because of higher temperatures in the middle of the road than on the shoulders.  Causes  There were several primary causes for the tread separations: tire age, manufacturing facility, operating temperature, tire design, as well as labor and management problems in Bridgestone/Firestone and at the Decatur, IL factory. = Tire age = The belt wedge and skim rubber compounds change as they age. Skim rubber is a thin strip of rubber sandwiched between the inner and outer belts and the belt wedge is a thin strip of rubber installed along the outer edge of the tire between the two steel belts and in the area of highest stress on the tire. These changes reduce the ability of the tire to resist crack growth and belt separation. Most of the tread separations occurred on tires that had been in service for at least three years. ATX and Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Decatur started to fail between one and two years after production, but between two and three years for tires from Wilson and between three and four years for tires from Joliette. Tire aging for Wilderness AT tires, regardless of factory produced them, was similar to other tires manufactured at Decatur and was worse than comparable tires manufactured by Goodyear. = Manufacturing facility = 198x198px The failure rates for ATX and ATX II tires manufactured at the Decatur, Illinois factory were higher than for the other factories that also manufactured these same tire models, Wilson, NC and Joliette Quebec. Tires manufactured in Decatur had \\"reduced fracture resistance\\" compared to tires manufactured at Joliette or Wilson. That is, once a crack formed within the tire, the crack would spread more readily than on comparable tires from the Joliette or Wilson factories. Researchers also tested belt adhesion strength by measuring the force that it would take to peel a strip of the second belt from the rest of the tire. ATX and ATX II tires manufactured at Decatur had lower belt adhesion strength than the same tires manufactured at Joliette or Wilson. The only manufacturing difference in the Decatur factory was in \\"the early material mixing stages which results in the production of materials with differing weight percentages of processing lubricant.\\" However, there was insufficient evidence to conclude that this would weaken a tire or lead to a premature failure. = Operating temperature = A tire's operating temperature will increase with higher vehicle load, speed, air temperature and with lower tire inflation pressure. The combination of inflation pressure, speed, and vehicle load could increase the tire temperature as much as 50 degrees C above the ambient air temperature. Higher operating temperatures will increase the rate of oxidative aging. Tires that were used in southern climates were less ductile and stiffer than tires that operated in northern climates. Tires in warmer climates also showed higher levels of cure and had somewhat lower peel strength. The role of air temperature would explain why geographic regions with higher air temperatures had the highest tire failure rates. These results held up even for tires that had zero percent tread wear. Higher vehicle loads increased belt crack growth rates. Of the four factors involved in the growth of cracks in the tires, vehicle load was the single most important factor. The Explorer weighs more than the Ford Ranger and has a higher Gross Vehicle Weight Rating (GVWR) while also having a lower recommended tire pressure. This difference in weight and tire pressure explains why Ford Explorers had far more tire failures than Ford Rangers even though they used the same tire models. Despite these differences, investigators were concerned that Ford Rangers would also see an increase in tire failures if those tires weren't recalled. = Tire design = Diagram Showing Steel Belts, Belt Wedge, and Design of Radial Tire Shoulder pocket of Wilderness At tires. The pocket is the gap along the edge of the tire between the lug or tread, e.g. above \\"B254\\" in this picture. Prior to May 1998 the belt wedge gauge for ATX and Wilderness AT tires was less than for comparable tires from other manufacturers. The wedge gauge on completed tires was also less than Firestone's minimum standards. The wedge on these tires was not large enough to resist crack formation and growth. The design of the belt wedge changed in May 1998 making it larger and comparable in size to tires manufactured by other companies. On Wilderness AT tires the inter-belt gauge, or a strip of rubber between the two steel belts, was often thinner than Firestone's minimum specification and the design was thinner than comparable tires from other manufacturers. The design of the shoulder pocket, a \\"cavity between the heavy ribs, or lugs, along the shoulders of the tire.\\", on the Wilderness AT tires could lead to high stresses along the tire edge allowing cracks to form in the belt wedge. Peel adhesion tests, where a strip of the second belt was pulled off the body of the tire, showed that Wilderness AT tires were weaker than similar tire models manufactured by other companies. Wilderness AT tires were comparable in strength to tires manufactured at the Decatur, IL factory, regardless of which factory the Wilderness AT were manufactured in. Wilderness AT tires had similar shearography results regardless of which factory produced them. Cracks and separations were more frequent than similar tires produced by other manufacturers. In 2000 Firestone added a nylon cap to reduce the problem of tread separation in all of its tire models installed on SUVs. = Labor and management problems = Bridgestone purchased Firestone in 1988 to compete with other large multinational tire companies and took on a considerable amount of debt to complete the purchase and upgrade Firestone's manufacturing facilities. At that time Firestone was losing a considerable amount of money each year which put a drain on Bridgestone's profits. Bridgestone pressured Firestone to cut manufacturing and labor costs to improve revenues. Critics and workers claim that this led Firestone to cut corners on production and to allow substandard tires to pass inspection that should have been rejected. This also led Firestone to pressure workers to accept new labor contracts that reduced pay and benefits and increased the hours that its factories were operating. In a deposition retired Firestone workers testified that quality control problems at the Decatur factory could have led workers to manufacture defective tires. One worker stated that, despite getting a company discount, he'd stopped purchasing Firestone tires years before the crisis developed because of quality control problems. Others stated that they had to inspect as many as 100 tires per hour which they believed were far too many tires to do an adequate job; that they were told to sign off on tires that they didn't actually inspect; that they rolled unvulcanized tire carcasses, also called a \\"green tire\\", across the factory floor which could allow debris from the floor to end up inside a completed tire; that they used an awl to puncture bubbles in tires; and that they were told to use a solvent similar to benzene on tire adhesives that had lost its tack from sitting too long in a humid factory. Organic solvents are commonly used in the tire industry as an ingredient in adhesives used to bond rubber components together. Industry observers, lawyers and workers claimed that too much of the solvent could damage the rubber in a tire and could lead to premature tire failures. Firestone claimed that these were disgruntled workers who quit after a bitter strike. \\"The comments of these former employees should be evaluated with a critical eye, given that they were carefully selected out of the thousands of current and former employees of the Decatur plant by plaintiffs' personal-injury lawyers.\\" Yoichiro Kaizaki, CEO and president of Bridgestone, stated that there were two different standards for quality control within Bridgestone. If a problem developed in a Bridgestone factory, \\"our technology staff would rush to the site [overseas]. But if a problem arose with a Firestone tire, they wouldn't do anything.\\" \\"We let the U.S. unit use its own culture. There was an element of mistake in that.\\" = United Rubber Workers strike = The tires that failed were primarily manufactured at Firestone's Decatur, Illinois factory during a time of labor unrest and a strike against Firestone carried out by the United Rubber Workers (URW) and the United Steel Workers (USW). In January 1994, Firestone and the URW entered into new contract negotiations with Firestone demanding considerable concessions from the union. These concessions included switching from an 8-hour workday to 12-hour alternating shifts so the factory could remain in operation 24 hours a day, a pay cut by 30 percent for new hires, a seven-day workweek instead of five days, hourly workers would contribute to their healthcare plan, a switch from a piece-rate system to a performance based system, and senior workers were to lose two weeks of vacation time. By April 1994, the existing labor contract ended and workers continued to work at the factory until the URW called a general strike in July at Decatur and four other Firestone facilities. Almost immediately Firestone began hiring replacement workers at all their facilities and by January 1995 Firestone had hired 2,300 replacement workers who were paid thirty percent less. Over time union workers started to cross the picket line and by May 1995 there were 1,048 replacement workers and 371 permanent workers at Decatur. At that time the URW voted to unconditionally end the strike to block Firestone from hiring even more replacement workers and then holding a union decertification election. While the strike ended the labor negotiations continued. In July 1995 the URW had run out of money and was absorbed by the USW. During the time period from May 1995 and December 1996 union workers worked alongside non-union replacements. Labor negotiations between Firestone and the USW continued but many union workers couldn't return to work because their jobs had been replaced. The union described that time period as \\"brutal.\\" The USW continued to negotiate specifically trying to get Firestone to allow all union workers to return to their jobs. In December 1996, the USW finally reached an agreement and all union workers were allowed to return to work. Tires with the highest rates of failure were manufactured in the months right before the union went on strike but after labor negotiations had begun, and later after union workers began to cross the picket line and work without a contract alongside replacement workers. Other Firestone factories (Joliette, Quebec and Wilson, North Carolina) also produced the same tire models but had far lower failure rates. Failure rates at the Decatur plant before the labor negotiations began, while the replacement workers worked without union workers, and after the labor negotiations ended, were comparable to the failure rate of tires manufactured at the Joliette and Wilson plants. Other studies have found that labor unrest reduces the quality of work by union members, suggesting that there should be additional inspections and heightened scrutiny by regulators during strikes. Recall On August 17, 1999, Ford in Saudi Arabia began replacing Firestone tires on unsold Ford Explorers and to offer steep discounts on replacement tires to customers who returned to Ford dealers for regular maintenance. While this wasn't officially a recall Ford still replaced Firestone tires on 6,800 Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers. In February 2000, Ford began to recall Firestone tires in Malaysia and Thailand. In May 2000, Ford recalled 150,000 Firestone tires on Explorers in Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador. In August 2000 Bridgestone/Firestone issued a recall in Venezuela of 62,000 Venezuelan made Firestone tires. The recall was estimated to cost $6 million. On August 9, 2000, Firestone issued a recall covering 6.5 million P235/75 R15 Firestone ATX and ATX II tires and P235/75R15 Wilderness AT tires manufactured after 1991 and 1996 respectively. The recall covered all ATX and ATX II tires regardless of which plant they originated from but only covered Wilderness AT tires from Firestone's Decatur plant. Firestone had produced 14.4 million tires that were covered by this recall but it was estimated that only 6.5 million remained in service. Wilderness AT tires manufactured in Joliette, Quebec and Wilson, North Carolina were not included in the recall. On August 21, 2000 Ford halted production at three truck assembly plants so that 70,000 tires could be diverted towards the recall effort. P235/75 R15 tires became scarce and Ford authorized dealers to install replacement tires from companies other than Firestone. Both Ford and Firestone looked for replacement tires internationally. On May 22, 2001, Ford announced a voluntary recall of all Wilderness AT tires of 15, 16, and 17 inches installed on all Ford trucks and SUVs. This covered an additional 13 million Firestone tires and cost Ford $3 billion. On October 4, 2001, NHTSA issued a mandatory recall of 3.5 million P235/75R15 and P255/70R16 Wilderness AT tires manufactured prior to May 1998 that were assembled in either the Joliette, Quebec or Wilson, NC factories. This recall removed all remaining Wilderness AT tires that were manufactured prior to May, 1998. NHTSA concluded that the rubber wedge between the outer edge of the two belts was not thick enough on Wilderness AT tires and not strong enough to resist crack formation and growth. Wilderness AT tires manufactured after May 1998 had a thicker wedge making them more robust. In November 2013, two recalled Wilderness AT tires were found in Atlanta, Georgia.Channel 2 Investigation Finds Recalled Tires for Sale, November 4, 2013 One of the tires was offered for sale as new at a used tire retail shop. Fallout = Injuries and fatalities = Sixty-two people were killed and more than 100 people were injured in the United States as a result of these failures. The large majority of accidents took place in California, Arizona, Texas, and Florida. An additional 46 people were killed in Venezuela. = Lawsuits = A large number of lawsuits were filed against both Ford and Firestone. The result of most lawsuits were kept confidential but one attorney estimated that Ford settled 1,500 cases regarding the safety of the Explorer. Ford's own financial statements indicate that it spent $590 million to settle personal injury and class action lawsuits. Firestone set aside $800 million to handle lawsuits related to the recalled tires. By February 2000, when KHOU in Texas ran a story about tire failures on Ford Explorers, Firestone had recorded 193 personal injury claims, 2,288 property damage claims, and was a defendant in 66 lawsuits. In 2000 Firestone was served with 413 individual lawsuits in state and federal courts. By July 2002 Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone had settled more than 600 cases. By late 2003 Bridgestone/Firestone and Ford had settled 1,300 cases. In November 2001, Firestone agreed to pay $41.5 million to end state lawsuits against Firestone. In 2003, Firestone settled a class action lawsuit by agreeing to pay $15.5 million for consumer education focusing on tire safety and $19 million in legal fees and $2,500 each to 45 plaintiffs. In 2005 Firestone paid Ford $240 million to settle claims related to the recall. Ford and Firestone worked to settle cases out of court to avoid punitive damages and were paying between $4 million and $8 million to settle cases involving fatalities and between $12 million to $16 million to settle cases of paralysis. Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that both Ford and Firestone knew of the dangers but did nothing, and that Ford knew that the Explorer was highly prone to rollovers. Firestone argued that Ford's recommended inflation pressure of 26 psi was too low and should have been 30 psi and that the Explorer was an especially dangerous vehicle prone to rollovers. = Congressional investigation = Congress began hearings in September 2000 to find out why it took so long for NHTSA to discover these tire defects and why Ford and Firestone were aware of tire failures as early as 1996 but never reported the information to NHTSA. The investigation led Congress to pass the Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and Documentation Act or TREAD Act on October 11, 2000 which was signed into law on November 1. = Ford/Firestone corporate relations = Relations between Ford and Bridgestone/Firestone deteriorated after NHTSA began investigating the tire failures in May 2000. Ford first accused Firestone of withholding data that Ford needed to determine which tires might be unsafe. Firestone then accused Ford of withholding safety data concerning the design of the Explorer. After Firestone agreed to the initial recall of 14.4 million tires on August 9, 2000 NHTSA continued to push Firestone to recall all ATX, ATX II, and Wilderness AT tires regardless of where they were manufactured. Ford executives were concerned that NHTSA might decide that the Wilderness AT tires wouldn't meet future safety standards and decided to recall these tires on their own. Before Ford could publicly announce this decision John T. Lampe (Chairman & CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone) announced on May 21, 2001 in a public letter to Jacques Nasser (Ford Motor Company chief executive) that Bridgestone/Firestone would no longer enter into new contracts with Ford Motor Company, effectively ending a 100-year supply relationship. The letter included accusations that the Ford Explorer was unsafe and called on NHTSA to investigate design flaws in the SUV. On May 22, 2001, angry that Firestone wouldn't expand the recall, Jacques Nasser at Ford announced a voluntary recall of all Wilderness AT tires that were not subject to the original recall. =Corporate firings and resignations= The chairman and CEO of Bridgestone/Firestone, Masatoshi Ono, resigned in October 2000 and was replaced by John Lampe. In January 2001, the CEO and president of Bridgestone, Yoichiro Kaizaki, resigned and was replaced by Shigeo Watanabe. The bitter public fight between Ford and Firestone was also a contributing factor in Ford's decision to fire Jacques Nasser in November 2001. Nasser was replaced by William Clay Ford Jr, the great-grandson of Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Company, and the great-grandson of Harvey Firestone, the founder of Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. = Firestone's Decatur plant = Firestone's Decatur plant was closed in December 2001 and all 1,500 employees were laid off. Firestone cited a decline in consumer demand for Firestone tires and the age of the Decatur plant as the reasons for closing that facility. It is estimated that closing the Decatur plant cost Bridgestone/Firestone $210 million. = Financial cost = It is estimated that these tire failures and rollovers cost Bridgestone/Firestone $1.67 billion and Ford Motor Company $530 million. Bridgestone's market price dropped by 50% and the resulting restructuring cost Bridgestone $2 billion. In 2001, Ford recorded a loss of $5.5 billion.

It began as a four-door higher equipment content version of the Civic in 1980. The Ballade was developed at the same time the Honda Vigor appeared, which was a higher content Honda Accord. In Japan, the Ballade was sold exclusively at Honda Verno dealerships alongside the Vigor, Prelude, CR-X, and Quint. In the UK it was launched at the same time as the very similar Triumph Acclaim with which it shared a Honda-built engine. History The name of the car was taken from \\"ballade\\", the French word for a ballad. Because both the four-door Ballade sedan and the five-door hatchback Quintet were both high luxury content vehicles derived from the Honda Civic, the Ballade represented a type of music, and the Quintet represented a musical group. The Ballade competed in Japan with the Toyota Sprinter, and the Nissan Laurel Spirit as the Civic competed with the Corolla, and the Sunny. It was launched in September 1980, nine months after the agreement between Honda and British Leyland to produce their own versions of the car and work on future cars together. Although the original Ballade was never sold in Europe, British Leyland produced its own version of the Ballade - the Triumph Acclaim - from 1981 to 1984. In North America the Ballade nameplate was never used, the model instead being sold as the Civic Sedan. Triumph Acclaim After 1984, the Ballade shared most of its body panels with the Civic, except for a sportier front end, and formed the basis of the CR-X sports car and the original Rover 200. Of this second generation Ballade the top model - EX-i - featured a 1.5L naturally aspirated 12 valve all-aluminium engine with multi-point fuel injection (using Honda's PGM-FI system) developing , the same engine was used on the first generation Civic CRX. Other features of the EX-i included electric windows all-round, electric and heated wing mirrors, metallic paint, vented front disc brakes and hydraulic power-assisted steering. Lower specification models featured the same 1.5L engine but with fuelling provided via a carburretor, giving . In keeping with the styling trend shared with other Honda Verno products, the second generation car adopted partially concealed headlights starting in 1983, shared with the Vigor, Quint Integra, Ballade Sports CR-X, and the Prelude. The Ballade in Japan was replaced in September 1987, with the Honda Concerto 5-door hatchback and sedan as the luxury Civic offering at newly established Honda Clio dealerships in Japan. As the Ballade was essentially a luxury version of the Civic sedan, Honda repositioned the Ballade from Honda Verno, first with the Concerto name, then renamed again as the Honda Domani at Honda Clio, and introduced it with the Honda Accord, the Honda Inspire, and the Honda Legend in 1992, with the Civic now headlining at Honda Primo stores. The sport-oriented version of the Civic loosely held by the Ballade evolved into the Honda Integra, and assumed the market position originally held by the Ballade at Honda Verno dealership locations. In South Africa, the name plate was revived in 2011 for the Honda City sold in other markets. South Africa =1980-1983= 1300 Twin carb, 5 speed manual or 3 speed auto E-series engine =1984-1987= Known in South Africa as the SC9, or informally as the \\"popup\\" as to not confuse it with the SH4.

Honda & Colt(Mitsubishi) Division of Mercedes-Benz of South Africa marketing manager Guy Franken says: \\"With a total 12 derivatives in the range we believe that we have the entire small/intermediate car market covered and offer value in performance, specification, safety and affordability.\\" MOTOR1.HTM These changes include: * A beverage holder * The velour colour of the bolsters in the Luxline has been changed to a more modern blue/grey. * A more pronounced grooved styling line in the bonnet. * A larger H-emblem on the grille. * Redesigned bumpers with no inserts. * A Becker A7 radio/tape was fitted in all Luxline models. * An anti- shock gearbox on the Ballade 180i Luxline Automatic. * Lightweight alloy wheels on the 180i and VTEC models and full wheel covers on the others. There was also an AMG (Mercedes Benz) version sold at AMG dealers since AMG Managed the racing team. It had some small modifications that allowed it to produce 129kW in B16A6 format. The engines available: D15Z4 D16Y9 B18B4 118 kW B16A6 D-series engines and B-series engines Honda Ballade (South Africa) reintroduction The Ballade name continued to be used for a Civic-based model in South Africa, where it was used instead of Civic on locally produced versions until 2001. South African Ballades were assembled by the local subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, which wanted to market a smaller and cheaper car in addition to its Mercedes-Benz models. The Ballade name was adopted because it was perceived to have more luxury and upmarket connotations than the Civic name. This was important because the Ballade was sold through the Mercedes- Benz dealership channel. In March 2011, the Honda City was launched as the Honda Ballade in South Africa.

He spent a year with the Wigston club South Leicester RUFC before he finally joined the Leicester Tigers Academy where he combined playing with further education at De Montfort University. He worked his way through the Tigers lower teams and continued his representative career, playing for both the England U19 and U21 sides. He has also featured in the England Sevens squad along with his teammate Louis Deacon. In August 2001, he made his first team Tigers debut in the Orange Cup game in Toulouse. In Leicester's 2002 Heineken Cup quarter final, Ellis scored the only try of the game, breaking away from a ruck and sliding over on the wet ground. Ellis went on to score a superb individual try that helped defeat Llanelli in the Heineken Cup semi-final at Nottingham. In the final itself Ellis came on as a replacement as Leicester emerged victorious. He was named Tigers’ Players Young Player of the Year for the 2001–2 season. He finally established himself as a regular in the No. 9 spot during the 2003–04 season, making 19 appearances and helping Tigers come back from a poor start and a turbulent mid-season to reach the Zurich Wild Card final. Ellis suffered knee ligament damage against Bristol on 5 May 2007 in the Guinness Premiership semi-final play-off. He played an influential role in the Tigers' domestic double success, but the injury meant him missing out on the Premiership and Heineken Cup finals. The Heineken Cup semi-final against Cardiff Blues resulted in a historic sudden death kicking competition. The shoot-out ended before Ellis's turn came up – though it was a close run thing, as either he or Tom Croft were to follow Jordan Crane. Although the Tigers fell at the final hurdle of the Heineken Cup, they won the 2008–09 Guinness Premiership final, which Ellis did not feature in but was an unused replacement. Ellis started the 2009/10 season as first-choice scrum-half for Leicester, but suffered an injury in training, which left him out of the game for a significant part of the season. He returned to play in the Guinness A league, and helped the Tigers A team to victory. His last game for the senior side came against Northampton Saints in the LV= Cup. International career Ellis played for the England A, Under 16 Group and Under 18 Group schools sides. In fact, he played for the England Under 18 side when he was only 16. Ellis was selected on England's 2004 summer tour as third choice scrum half behind Matt Dawson and Andy Gomarsall and did not play, however he made his England debut from the bench in their 32–16 win over the Springboks in autumn 2004. He also made an appearance as a replacement in the game against Australia. He subsequently became a regular fixture in the England side, rotating with Matt Dawson during the 2005 Six Nations. Ellis scored his debut try for England in the 2005 Calcutta Cup win over Scotland. He lost out to Matt Dawson for the opening two Autumn tests in 2005 but took his chance superbly against Samoa, scoring an outstanding solo try in what was comfortably his best test match performance. This helped secured him the no 9 shirt for four games of the 2006 6 Nations. He was left out of the Summer development tour to Australia, but was chosen again for the Elite Player England Squad for the 2006/2007 season. Ellis was not included in the 2006 Autumn internationals that saw England head coach Andy Robinson lose his job, but when Brian Ashton was appointed as his successor Ellis was named in the team to start England's 2007 Six Nations opener against Scotland. In this game Ellis came of age and it was arguably one of his best performances in an England shirt. He consistently retained his place throughout the 2007 Six Nations, starting in every game and scoring a try in the loss to Wales. Ellis was ruled out of the 2007 Rugby World Cup due to the knee injury suffered in the Premiership. He had a very successful 2009 Six Nations tournament, starting for England as a result of the ankle injury to Danny Care, and went on to score two tries in a man-of-the-match performance against , where his opposite number was, unusually, Mauro Bergamasco. He started all subsequent Six Nations matches, where he played scrum-half to former teammate Andy Goode, and then current teammate Toby Flood's fly-half. His last game for England came in the Calcutta Cup win over . His good form in the Six Nations contributed to him being picked for the 2009 British and Irish Lions tour, where he played as a substitute in the final Test win against the Springboks in Ellis Park.

The Serra dos Órgãos National Park lies partly within the city limits. The city is known as the home of the Brazil national football team, since it hosts CBF's training ground at Granja Comary.http://www.teresopolison.com/cbf.php History Founding of Teresopolis by then Governor of Rio de Janeiro, Francisco Portela on July 6, 1890. Before the arrival of the Portuguese to the area where Teresópolis lies today, in the 16th century, it was inhabited by indigenous brazilians. In the following centuries, Portuguese started buying land there. The region was also occupied by a quilombo, formed by runaway slaves coming from sugar cane plantations near Rio de Janeiro. In 1821, English citizen George March (born and raised in Portugal) established a farm there, which later became the most important settlement along the way between the court, in Rio de Janeiro, and the territory of Gerais (nowadays, the state of Minas Gerais), which led to the great improvement of agriculture and cattle raising. The Brazilian imperial family was much impressed by the natural beauty and the climate of the region, which developed slowly so that in 1855 the settlement became a village that was named Freguesia de Santo Antonio de Paquequer. The further development of the village was due to the traders that came from Minas Gerais in the way to Rio de Janeiro, and used the region as a resting stop. Finally, on July 6, 1891, the village became a municipality that was named Teresópolis (\\"city of Teresa\\"), after Empress Teresa Cristina, wife of Emperor Pedro II. Geography According to the 2010 Brazilian Census, the city has a population of 163,746 within a land area of 770,6 km2. The Serra dos Órgãos National Park is in the vicinity. Its predominant vegetation belongs to the Atlantic Forest type. The city is surrounded by forests and by well-known summits or peaks, because of which the city is known as the national capital of mountaineering. The most famous peaks are: * Peak of Pedra do Sino – * Peak of Pedra do Açu – * Peak of Agulha do Diabo – * Peak of Nariz do Frade – * Peak of Dedo de Deus – * Peak of Pedra da Ermitage – * Peak of Dedo de Nossa Senhora – Of these, Dedo de Deus (\\"God's finger\\") is the most famous. The municipality contains the Montanhas de Teresópolis Municipal Nature Park, created in 2009 to protect a large area of Atlantic Forest. The municipality contained the Floresta do Jacarandá Environmental Protection Area, but this was extinguished in 2013. It contains the Bacia dos Frades Environmental Protection Area, created in 1990. The municipality contains 20% of the Três Picos State Park, created in 2002. It contains part of the Central Rio de Janeiro Atlantic Forest Mosaic of conservation units, created in 2006. Climate Teresópolis features a subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification: Cfb), with relatively cold and dry winters and mild and wet summers. The annual average temperature is 16 °C/60.8 °F. Teresópolis has one of the mildest climates in Brazil and this is one reason why the area has been chosen as Brazilian Football Confederation's training headquarters, hosting the Brazil national football team, located in Granja Comary. Tragedy The uncontrolled growth of Teresópolis and other cities of the mountainous region near Rio de Janeiro led to the construction of a great number of houses in mountainous terrain or on the banks of rivers. This fact, together with a 24-hour rainfall that exceeded what was expected for the entire month, caused a series of floods and mudslides in January 2011. More than 400 people died and thousands lost their houses in the event, which is considered the worst weather-related tragedy in Brazilian history. .

Individual EBs are composed of approximately 1000 mESCs An embryoid body whose cells differentiated into enhanced green fluorescence protein-expressing spontaneously beating cardiomyocytes. Embryoid bodies (EBs) are three-dimensional aggregates of pluripotent stem cells. The pluripotent cell types that comprise embryoid bodies include embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the blastocyst stage of embryos from mouse (mESC), primate, and human (hESC) sources. Additionally, EBs can be formed from embryonic stem cells derived through alternative techniques, including somatic cell nuclear transfer or the reprogramming of somatic cells to yield induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Similar to ESCs cultured in monolayer formats, ESCs within embryoid bodies undergo differentiation and cell specification along the three germ lineages – endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm – which comprise all somatic cell types. In contrast to monolayer cultures, however, the spheroid structures that are formed when ESCs aggregate enables the non-adherent culture of EBs in suspension, making EB cultures inherently scalable, which is useful for bioprocessing approaches, whereby large yields of cells can be produced for potential clinical applications. Additionally, although EBs largely exhibit heterogeneous patterns of differentiated cell types, ESCs are capable of responding to similar cues that direct embryonic development. Therefore, the three-dimensional structure, including the establishment of complex cell adhesions and paracrine signaling within the EB microenvironment, enables differentiation and morphogenesis which yields microtissues that are similar to native tissue structures. Such microtissues are promising to directly or indirectly repair damaged or diseased tissue in regenerative medicine applications, as well as for in vitro testing in the pharmaceutical industry and as a model of embryonic development. Formation EBs are formed by the homophilic binding of the Ca2+ dependent adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which is highly expressed on undifferentiated ESCs. When cultured as single cells in the absence of anti-differentiation factors, ESCs spontaneously aggregate to form EBs. Such spontaneous formation is often accomplished in bulk suspension cultures whereby the dish is coated with non-adhesive materials, such as agar or hydrophilic polymers, to promote the preferential adhesion between single cells, rather than to the culture substrate. As hESC undergo apoptosis when cultured as single cells, EB formation often necessitates the use of inhibitors of the rho associated kinase (ROCK) pathway, including the small molecules Y-27632 and 2,4 disubstituted thiazole (Thiazovivin/Tzv). Alternatively, to avoid dissociation into single cells, EBs can be formed from hESCs by manual separation of adherent colonies (or regions of colonies) and subsequently cultured in suspension. Formation of EBs in suspension is amenable to the formation of large quantities of EBs, but provides little control over the size of the resulting aggregates, often leading to large, irregularly shaped EBs. As an alternative, the hydrodynamic forces imparted in mixed culture platforms increase the homogeneity of EB sizes when ESCs are inoculated within bulk suspensions. Formation of EBs can also be more precisely controlled by the inoculation of known cell densities within single drops (10-20 µL) suspended from the lid of a Petri dish, known as hanging drops. While this method enables control of EB size by altering the number of cells per drop, the formation of hanging drops is labor-intensive and not easily amenable to scalable cultures. Additionally, the media can not be easily exchanged within the traditional hanging drop format, necessitating the transfer of hanging drops into bulk suspension cultures after 2–3 days of formation, whereby individual EBs tend to agglomerate. Recently, new technologies have been developed to enable media exchange within a modified hanging drop format. In addition, technologies have also been developed to physically separate cells by forced aggregation of ESCs within individual wells or confined on adhesive substrates, which enables increased throughput, controlled formation of EBs. Ultimately, the methods used for EB formation may impact the heterogeneity of EB populations, in terms of aggregation kinetics, EB size and yield, as well as differentiation trajectories. Differentiation within EBs Within the context of ESC differentiation protocols, EB formation is often used as a method for initiating spontaneous differentiation toward the three germ lineages. EB differentiation begins with the specification of the exterior cells toward the primitive endoderm phenotype. The cells at the exterior then deposit extracellular matrix (ECM), containing collagen IV and laminin, similar to the composition and structure of basement membrane. In response to the ECM deposition, EBs often form a cystic cavity, whereby the cells in contact with the basement membrane remain viable and those at the interior undergo apoptosis, resulting in a fluid-filled cavity surrounded by cells. Subsequent differentiation proceeds to form derivatives of the three germ lineages. In the absence of supplements, the “default” differentiation of ESCs is largely toward ectoderm, and subsequent neural lineages. However, alternative media compositions, including the use of fetal bovine serum as well as defined growth factor additives, have been developed to promote the differentiation toward mesoderm and endoderm lineages. As a result of the three-dimensional EB structure, complex morphogenesis occurs during EB differentiation, including the appearance of both epithelial- and mesenchymal- like cell populations, as well as the appearance of markers associated with the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Additionally, the inductive effects resulting from signaling between cell populations in EBs results in spatially and temporally defined changes, which promote complex morphogenesis. Tissue-like structures are often exhibited within EBs, including the appearance of blood islands reminiscent of early blood vessel structures in the developing embryo, as well as the patterning of neurite extensions (indicative of neuron organization) and spontaneous contractile activity (indicative of cardiomyocyte differentiation) when EBs are plated onto adhesive substrates such as gelatin. More recently, complex structures, including optic cup-like structures were created in vitro resulting from EB differentiation. Parallels with embryonic development Much of the research central to embryonic stem cell differentiation and morphogenesis is derived from studies in developmental biology and mammalian embryogenesis. For example, immediately after the blastocyst stage of development (from which ESCs are derived), the embryo undergoes gastrulation, whereby cell specification of the inner cell mass results in the formation of the visceral endoderm and epiblast. As the anterior-posterior axis is formed, the embryo develops a transient structure known as the primitive streak. Much of the spatial patterning that occurs during the formation and migration of the primitive streak results from the secretion of agonists and antagonists by various cell populations, including the growth factors from the Wnt and transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) families (Lefty 1, Nodal), as well as repressors of the same molecules (Dkk-1, Sfrp1, Sfrp5). Due to the similarities between embryogenesis and ESC differentiation, many of the same growth factors are central to directed differentiation approaches. In addition, advancements of EB culture resulted in the development of embryonic organoids (Gastruloids) which show remarkable parallels to embryonic development such as symmetry-breaking, localised brachyury expression, the formation of the embryonic axes (anteroposterior, dorsoventral and Left-Right) and gastrulation-like movements. Challenges to directing differentiation In contrast to the differentiation of ESCs in monolayer cultures, whereby the addition of soluble morphogens and the extracellular microenvironment can be precisely and homogeneously controlled, the three-dimensional structure of EBs poses challenges to directed differentiation. For example, the visceral endoderm population which forms the exterior of EBs, creates an exterior “shell” consisting of tightly connected epithelial-like cells, as well as a dense ECM. Due to such physical restrictions, in combination with EB size, transport limitations occur within EBs, creating gradients of morphogens, metabolites, and nutrients. It has been estimated that oxygen transport is limited in cell aggregates larger than approximately 300 µm in diameter; however, the development of such gradients are also impacted by molecule size and cell uptake rates. Therefore, the delivery of morphogens to EBs results in increased heterogeneity and decreased efficiency of differentiated cell populations compared to monolayer cultures. One method of addressing transport limitations within EBs has been through polymeric delivery of morphogens from within the EB structure. Additionally, EBs can be cultured as individual microtissues and subsequently assembled into larger structures for tissue engineering applications. Although the complexity resulting from the three- dimensional adhesions and signaling may recapitulate more native tissue structures, it also creates challenges for understanding the relative contributions of mechanical, chemical, and physical signals to the resulting cell phenotypes and morphogenesis. Impact of ethics and policy on research ESCs are the subject of much public debate due to the ethical questions arising from the derivation from blastocyst-stage of development, necessitating the destruction of the embryo. Although much early EB research was conducted using ESCs derived from mouse sources, cell lines derived from human sources are necessary to fulfill the clinical promise of ESCs. While current U.S. regulations, initiated by the executive order of President Barack Obama in 2009 allow federal funding for hESC lines that are approved by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the derivation of new hESC lines using federal funding is prohibited by the Dickey-Wicker Amendment. However, due to the association of EB research with ESCs, the long term outcomes of EB research may be subject to regulation by local or federal policy changes. EBs however, are amenable to the use of alternative pluripotent cell sources, such as iPS cells, which holds promise for future applications in three-dimensional stem cell differentiation.

It is located south of Bevendean and north of Brighton Marina. The area is a large, modern housing estate built in a downland dry valley historically known as Whitehawk Bottom. The estate was originally developed by the local council between 1933 and 1937 and included nearly 1,200 residences. Subsequently, the Swanborough flats were built in 1967, and during the 1970s and 1980s much of the estate was rebuilt by altering the road layouts and increasing the number of houses. Whitehawk is part of the East Brighton ward of Brighton and Hove City Council, represented (as of 2019) by Nancy Platts (Labour), Nichole Brennan (Labour) and Gill Williams (Labour). History = Pre-development = Before being developed, Whitehawk was chalk downland. At the top of Whitehawk Hill, Whitehawk Camp was a Neolithic causewayed camp of the Windmill Hill culture inhabited around 5500 years ago. It is now a scheduled ancient monument and is one of three causewayed camps known to have existed in the South Downs. The name Whitehawk is believed to be a corruption of \\"Vied Ac\\", the Saxon for \\"holy oak\\", named after a wooden pole which stood on the hill. Horse racing started on Whitehawk Down in the late 18th century next to the causewayed camp and connected to the White Hawk Fair. Brighton Race Course is still on the site, which became known as Race Hill. By 1870, the neighbouring Sheepcote Valley was being used as a rifle range to train volunteer soldiers. By 1916 it had begun to be used as a refuse tip. A site at Sheepcote close to the edge of the Whitehawk housing is still used as a Council waste centre for domestic users. Whitehawk Road, as it then was, came to demarcate the eastern parish boundary of Brighton. In 1818 gas works were built at Black Rock, between Whitehawk and the sea. By virtue of being built there, the works avoided paying taxes in Brighton. =1920 to World War II= By the beginning of the 1920s, the Whitehawk area consisted mainly of pig farms, smallholdings and allotments. This would all change between 1920 and 1931 when Brighton Corporation, in common with local government authorities all over the country, began a program of slum clearances. Alongside Manor Farm, Whitehawk was one of the areas used for new homes to house the residents. The homes were designed to have \\"all modern conveniences\\" including electricity, gas and running water. They also had gardens. This was a huge contrast to the small, back to back terraces in the town centre, which they replaced. Some people found it very difficult to adjust. This was partly because many of those moved earned their living as rag and bone men, conducting their business by horse and cart. This was hard to do from so far out of town. Between 1933 and 1937 the council estate was built. By 1937 there were nearly 1,200 houses in Whitehawk, all with gardens. East Brighton Park, at the Eastern extremity of Whitehawk, was home to the first Municipal Camping Ground, opened by the mayor of Brighton, Herbert Hone, in May 1938. It utilised buildings already at the site, formerly belonging to the Newhouse Farm. These buildings are thought to date from the late 18th Century. The first Whitehawk Library opened in 1934 in front of the Primary School. In 1935 a lido was built on the seafront at Black Rock, a short distance from Whitehawk (via the eastern extremities of Brighton's Kemp Town seafront development). =1950s and 1960s= The Swanborough Flats Post-war Brighton suffered a housing shortage and so further building work was carried out in the Whitehawk area. New low- and high-rise flats were built to the west of Whitehawk (known as the Bristol Estate) and private housing was also started, most notably a large self-build scheme in Wilson Avenue at the far east of the estate. The high rise Swanborough Flats were built by Brighton Corporation at the northern tip of Whitehawk in 1967. By 1969 the library site was needed by the school for classrooms and so a temporary library was opened in Rugby House, Rugby Place. =1970s to 2000s= The Community Centre, along with a new library, including a toy library for children was opened by Princess Alexandra in November 1973 in Whitehawk Road. At the time it was the largest in Brighton. From 1975, the Council started a remodelling exercise in Whitehawk. Initially, houses were left empty as they became vacant, and were boarded up. Many of the long roads in Whitehawk were removed and replaced with smaller cul-de-sacs. This allowed larger numbers of houses to fit into the same space and by the end of the scheme the number of houses in Whitehawk had increased to over 1,400. The last part of the scheme, Lintott Avenue (South) was completed in 1988. In 1979, the Black Rock lido was demolished in conjunction with the development of Brighton Marina. Construction of the marina had already started in 1971. The population of Whitehawk (and Manor Farm) was nearly 8,000 in 1981. In April 2000, The East Brighton New Deal for Communities (EBNDC) Partnership was awarded £47.2m from the government's pilot NDC programme aimed at social regeneration of the area covering Bate's Estate, Higher Bevendean, Manor Farm, Moulsecoomb, Saunders Park and Whitehawk. Money was spent in Whitehawk on various community projects, the most notable being the Crew Club youth centre and The Whitehawk Inn Community Hub. 41 pedestrian alleys were remodelled because they were seen as \\"havens for anti-social behaviour\\". Whitehawk is overlooked by the White Hawk, a chalk carving in the hill at Sheepcote Valley. The White Hawk was carved in 2001 by local artists with support from the Friends of Sheepcote Valley (FSV) and Whitehawk residents. It was recently renovated by the FSV, local scouts, community workers, council rangers and residents.  2010s  Whitehawk was noted in 2010 to be in the 5% of most deprived areas in Great Britain. Funding of £7.4m was provided by the state and the local council to create a 'community hub'. After a consultation by two groups not based in Whitehawk, Racehill Community Orchard was built at the top of Whitehawk in 2012. Over 60 fruit trees and 1000 native hedgerow plants were installed. In 2018, the orchard won a Britain in Bloom award. Over 100 people attended a protest on Whitehawk Hill in 2018, to beat the bounds of the common land. They were angered by plans to build 217 homes on the conservation area. Local environmentalist Dave Bangs said \\"Whitehawk Hill is more precious than the Brighton Pavilion because of its public value, its ancient history.\\" The plans were definitively discarded by the Council in January 2019. Following local elections in May 2019, Whitehawk is part of the East Brighton ward represented at Brighton and Hove City Council by Nancy Platts (Labour), Nichole Brennan (Labour) and Gill Williams (Labour). Places of worship St Cuthman's Church St. Cuthman's (Church of England) Church was built in the 1930s and completely destroyed by bombing in World War II. It was rebuilt after the war, being completed in 1952 to the design of local architect John Leopold Denman. It is sometimes called \\"the Children's Church\\" because local children famously saved their pennies to help fund the rebuilding. The church hall was sold to the local Community Association in 1982. St. Cuthmans (Church of England) is situated on Whitehawk Way next door to the Valley Social Centre. The church also runs a drop-in centre. The Valley Social Centre, previously known as St. David's Mission Hall (also Church of England) is now used as a community centre, and also runs a drop-in centre.

History The label was started in 1949 as the Polygon Record Company Ltd. by Alan A. Freeman and Leslie Clark, who was anxious to control distribution of his daughter Petula Clark's recordings. (Those associated with it fondly referred to the company as \\"Dead Parrot Records\\".) The two set up offices on Grosvenor Place in the Sloane Square section of London, and arranged Clark's first recording session with Ron Goodwin and his orchestra and a vocal backing group called the Stargazers. Since Polygon's UK distribution had not yet been set up, the first 78rpm single - \\"You Go to My Head\\" backed with \\"Out of a Clear Blue Sky\\" - was released in Australia, followed by a cover of Teresa Brewer's \\"Music! Music! Music!\\" backed with \\"Blossoms on the Bough\\", both on the Esquire label. In fact, the first Polygon release in the UK was not by Clark but by Louis Prima and his orchestra. Clark's first official Polygon release was \\"You Are My True Love\\"/\\"You're the Sweetest in the Land\\" in 1950. Her first big hit came in June 1954 with 'The Little Shoemaker' (Polygon P1117). In all, she recorded more than fifty songs for the label, including a few duets with its other major artist, Jimmy Young. Jimmy Young recorded his big hit 'Too Young' for the Polygon label (P1013) in 1951, but this was before the days of UK record charts which started in November 1952. Near the end of 1955, Polygon was sold to Nixa Records, then part of Pye Records, which led to the establishment of Pye Nixa Records. Nixa utilized a selection of Clark's Polygon tapes to release her first LP, Petula Clark Sings. Clark's complete Polygon catalogue is available on CD - originally re-issued as The Polygon Years, Volume One (1950–1952) and The Polygon Years, Volume Two (1952–1955). However, when Polygon was first merged with Nixa, one of the two Nissen huts used for storing the label's master tapes was demolished with the contents still inside. Thus, as a consequence, the only source for around half of Polygon's masters is original 78rpm discs. The first CD reissues of these recordings therefore suffered from poor sound, which was not improved until 2007 on the compilation It Had to Be You - The Complete Early Singles.

The screenplay is based on the novel Off Magazine Street by Ronald Everett Capps. Set in New Orleans, the film stars John Travolta and Scarlett Johansson, who was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama for her performance. Plot Following the death of her mother from a drug overdose, 18-year-old Purslane (Pursy) Hominy Will leaves a Florida trailer park, where she lives with an abusive boyfriend, to return to her hometown of New Orleans. Her mother Lorraine was a jazz singer, whom Pursy felt neglected her for her career. Pursy had dropped out of high school and left the city. The girl is surprised to find strangers living in her mother's dilapidated home: Bobby Long, a former professor of literature at Auburn University, and his protégé and former teaching assistant, Lawson Pines, a struggling writer. Both men are heavy drinkers and smokers. They pass time quoting poets, playing chess, and spending time with the neighbors; Long also sings country-folk songs. The two convince Pursy that her mother left the house to all three of them. More exactly, the truth is that Pursy is the sole heir, and the other two are limited by her mother's will as to how long they can stay in the house. Pursy moves in, acting as the most responsible member of the evolving dysfunctional family. The men's efforts to drive her away decline as they grow more fond of her. Bobby - slovenly and suffering from ailments he prefers to ignore - tries to improve Pursy by introducing her to the novel The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter; he also encourages her to return to high school and get her degree. Lawson is attracted to her but hesitates to become involved. The three have memories of Lorraine, especially Pursy, who feels that her mother ignored her to pursue her jazz career. When she finds a cache of letters her mother wrote to her but never mailed, Pursy learns more about how Lorraine felt about her, and the identity of her biological father. Cast *John Travolta as Bobby Long *Scarlett Johansson as Purslane Will *Gabriel Macht as Lawson Pines *Deborah Kara Unger as Georgianna *Clayne Crawford as Lee Production and box office According to the film credits, it was shot on location in New Orleans and Gretna, Louisiana.

The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in September 2004. In order to qualify for Academy Award consideration, it opened on eight screens in New York City and Los Angeles on December 29, 2004, earning $28,243 on its opening weekend. It played in 24 theaters in the US at its widest release. It eventually grossed $164,308 domestically and $1,676,952 in foreign markets for a total worldwide box office of $1,841,260. Critical reception Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote \\"[I]t dawdles along aimlessly for nearly two hours before coming up with a final revelation that is no surprise.\\" He felt John Travolta was playing \\"a hammed-up, scenery-chewing variation of the brainy good ol' boy he played in Primary Colors,\\" and thought Gabriel Macht's \\"understated performance\\" was \\"the deepest and subtlest of the three.\\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote \\"What can be said is that the three actors inhabit this material with ease and gratitude: It is good to act on a simmer sometimes, instead of at a fast boil. It's unusual to find an American movie that takes its time. It's remarkable to listen to dialogue that assumes the audience is well-read. It is refreshing to hear literate conversation. These are modest pleasures, but real enough.\\" Carina Chocano of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the film > is, deep-down, a redemptive makeover story drenched in alcohol, Southern > literature and the damp romanticism of the bohemian lush life in New > Orleans.

Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film two out of four stars, calling it \\"an elegant mess.\\" He added \\"The actors labor to perform a rescue operation...It's the stunning location photography of camera ace Elliot Davis that provides what the movie itself lacks: authenticity.\\" Awards and nominations Scarlett Johansson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Drama.

Otago Boys' High School (OBHS) is one of New Zealand's oldest boys' secondary schools, located in Dunedin, Otago, New Zealand. Originally known as Dunedin High School, it was founded on 3 August 1863 and moved to its present site in 1885. The main building was designed by Robert Lawson and is regarded as one of the finest Gothic revival structures in the country.An English artist visiting New Zealand, signing himself Evacustes in a letter to the Otago Daily Times, when the building was still mostly a design, expressed such an opinion, also that this building and the university's \\"would do credit to any town either in Europe or America\\". Otago Daily Times 23 March 1883 p.4h. Situated on high ground above central Dunedin it commands excellent views of the city and is a prominent landmark. Otago Girls' High School now occupies the original site in Tennyson Street, closer to the centre of the city and is Otago Boys' sister school. The school owns a lodge in Mount Aspiring National Park, and has regular field trips for students. Building history The school opened on its present site in Arthur Street in 1885. The Main Tower Block was designed by R A Lawson and built for 14,800 poundsArnold (et al), 1963 p.6. in blue stone, Port Chalmers breccia and Oamaru stone by W A Carlton. It has long been regarded as a fine design and is listed as a Category I Historic Place. Increasing roll numbers from 1903 led to the opening of the Shand Building in 1914, designed by Edmund Anscombe. He was also responsible for the Rectory, 1913, the principal's onsite residence.Griffiths, Eccles, McCoy, 1983, pp.40–41. The Shand Building, originally called \\"Shand Hall\\" cost 3,600 pounds. The following year it was extended to a design by Harry Mandeno (1879–1972).Otago Daily Times 2 May 1914 p.5c A memorial arch at the entrance to the grounds, built in blue stone and Oamaru stone and designed by Leslie Coombs (1885–1952) was unveiled in 1923.Arnold (et al), 1963 p.23. In 1920 the Fulton Building provided six additional classrooms, but this has since been replaced with the gymnasium complex and rehoused swimming pool designed by E.J. Ted McCoy as part of the later major restoration and redevelopment of the school's buildings. There is a teaching block, named after a former Rector, Mr. W.J. Morrell, which was erected in 1961 to a standard Ministry of Works design, though contextualised with blue stone fascias by the architect Ian R McAllum. A grandstand with similar fascias on its rearward elevation forms part of a quadrangle, with the Morrell building, behind the Lawson building. This was also designed by McAllum and built from 1962 to 1963. It has a cantilevered, multiple-gabled canopy added in 1964. Specialist science laboratories designed by Angus Black were constructed in 1967 and were named after the pioneering plastic surgeon Sir Archibald McIndoe, an Old Boy of the school. Mr D J MacLachlan, Rector from 1963 to 1985, worked tirelessly for the construction of the main teaching block which now bears his name. This is part of the major restoration and redevelopment which saw the refurbishment of the Main Tower Block, the central feature of which is the Maurice Joel Theatre. It also involved the construction of several large new buildings, forming a new quadrangle around the former Green in the greatest expansion of the complex since the 1880s. This considerable undertaking, designed by E.J. Ted McCoy was completed in 1983. The new buildings, though unmistakably Modernist, nevertheless sit very comfortably with the old. Where Lawson's tower block is an exemplary composition in the Scottish Baronial style, taking its inspiration from the 16th-century tower houses and reading something like a toy fort or a castle to a modern eye, McCoy's blue stone aggregate and fair face concrete echo its materials while the new complex's gun slot windows are a playful reference to the Maginot line which echoes the old building's military theme. The new buildings are also very modestly set below the old so the latter take visual pre-eminence from a distance. The project won the architect a National Award from the New Zealand Institute of Architects. It has also been pointed to as an example of his unusual ability to mix the emphatically old with the unashamedly new.

They are situated in the upper lateral region of each orbit, in the lacrimal fossa of the orbit formed by the frontal bone. Inflammation of the lacrimal glands is called dacryoadenitis. The lacrimal gland produces tears which then flow into canals that connect to the lacrimal sac. From that sac, the tears drain through the lacrimal duct into the nose. Anatomists divide the gland into two sections, a palpebral lobe, or portion, and an orbital lobe or portion. The smaller palpebral lobe lies close to the eye, along the inner surface of the eyelid; if the upper eyelid is everted, the palpebral portion can be seen. The orbital lobe of the gland, contains fine interlobular ducts that connect the orbital lobe and the palpebral lobe. They unite to form three to five main secretory ducts, joining five to seven ducts in the palpebral portion before the secreted fluid may enter on the surface of the eye. Tears secreted collect in the fornix conjunctiva of the upper lid, and pass over the eye surface to the lacrimal puncta, small holes found at the inner corner of the eyelids. These pass the tears through the lacrimal canaliculi on to the lacrimal sac, in turn to the nasolacrimal duct, which dumps them out into the nose.\\"eye, human.\\"Encyclopædia Britannica. 2010. Encyclopædia Britannica 2010 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD 2010 Lacrimal glands are also present in other mammals, such as horses. Structure =Histology= The lacrimal gland is a compound tubuloacinar gland, it is made up of many lobules separated by connective tissue, each lobule contains many acini. The acini composed of large serous cells which, produce a watery serous secretion, serous cells are filled with lightly stained secretory granules and surrounded by well- developed myoepithelial cells and a sparse, vascular stroma. Each acinus consists of a grape-like mass of lacrimal gland cells with their apices pointed to a central lumen. The central lumen of many of the units converge to form intralobular ducts, and then they unite to form interlobular ducts. The gland lacks striated ducts. =Blood supply= The lacrimal gland receives blood from the lacrimal artery, which is a branch of the ophthalmic artery. Blood from the gland drains to the superior ophthalmic vein. =Lymphatic drainage= No lymphatic vessels have been observed draining the lacrimal gland. =Nerve supply= The lacrimal gland is innervated by the lacrimal nerve, which is the smallest branch of the ophthalmic nerve, itself a branch of the trigeminal nerve (CN V). After the lacrimal nerve branches from the ophthalmic nerve it receives a communicating branch from the zygomatic nerve. This communicating branch carries postganglionic parasympathetic axons from the pterygopalatine ganglion. The lacrimal nerve passes anteriorly in the orbit and through the lacrimal gland providing parasympathetic and sympathetic innervation to it.  Parasympathetic innervation  The parasympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland is a complex pathway which traverses through numerous structures in the head. Ultimately this two-neuron pathway involving both a preganglionic and postganglionic parasympathetic neuron increases the secretion of lacrimal fluid from the lacrimal gland. The preganglionic parasympathetic neurons are located in the superior salivatory nucleus. They project axons which exit the brainstem as part of the facial nerve (CN VII). Within the facial canal at the geniculate ganglion the axons branch from the facial nerve forming the greater petrosal nerve. This nerve exits the facial canal through the hiatus for the greater petrosal nerve in the petrous part of the temporal bone. It emerges to the middle cranial fossa and travels anteromedially to enter the foramen lacerum. Within the foramen lacerum it joins to the deep petrosal nerve to form the nerve of the pterygoid canal and then passes through this canal. It emerges in the pterygopalatine fossa and enters the pterygopalatine ganglion where the preganglionic parasympathetic axons synapse with the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons. The postganglionic neurons then send axons which travel with the zygomatic nerve to enter the inferior orbital fissure. As the zygomatic nerve travels anteriorly in the orbit it send a communicating branch to the lacrimal nerve which carries the postganglionic parasympathetic axons. The lacrimal nerve completes this long pathway by travelling through the lacrimal gland and sending branches to it which provide parasympathetic innervation to increase the secretion of lacrimal fluid.  Sympathetic innervation  Sympathetic innervation to the lacrimal gland is of less physiologic importance than the parasympathetic innervation, however there are noradrenergic axons found within the lacrimal gland. Their cell bodies are located in the superior cervical ganglion. Clinical significance In contrast to the normal moisture of the eyes or even crying, there can be persistent dryness, scratching, itchiness and burning in the eyes, which are signs of dry eye syndrome (DES) or keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS). With this syndrome, the lacrimal glands produce less lacrimal fluid, which mainly occurs with ageing or certain medications. A thin strip of filter paper (placed at the edge of the eye) the Schirmer test, can be used to determine the level of dryness of the eye. Many medications or diseases that cause dry eye syndrome can also cause hyposalivation with xerostomia. Treatment varies according to aetiology and includes avoidance of exacerbating factors, tear stimulation and supplementation, increasing tear retention, eyelid cleansing, and treatment of eye inflammation.Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 153.

The show was rerun on The Comedy Network in Canada. On the show, contestants face off in trivia matches against a panel of three resident \\"geeks\\" who are well-versed in music, movies, and television, as well as a fourth guest geek with an alternate area of expertise which varies from episode to episode. The object is to outsmart the geek at their own subject; as a handicap, the geeks are given questions of considerably greater difficulty than the contestants. Beat the Geeks was taped at the Hollywood Center Studios. Rules =First round= In the first season, the three contestants competed against each other to answer eight toss-up questions, two from each category; the Geeks did not play in this round. The first four questions (one per category) were worth 5 points each, and the second four were worth 10 points each. Occasionally, the Geeks would give a fact after the question. In the second season, four pairs of questions were asked, one in each Geek's category. The first question of each pair was a toss-up among the contestants, worth 10 points. The contestant who answered correctly then played the second toss-up against the relevant Geek. If the contestant answered correctly or if the Geek missed, the contestant scored 10 points; if the contestant missed or if the Geek answered correctly, the contestant lost 5 points. In both seasons, the lowest scorer at the end of the round was eliminated. In the event of a tie for low score, a question with a numerical answer was asked and the contestants wrote down their guesses. The one who came closer to the correct answer without going over remained in the game; if both were over, the closer guess won. =Second round= The remaining two contestants each play a head-to-head challenge against the Geek of their choice in order to win the Geek's medal. If the contestants begin the round tied, they are asked a toss-up question to determine who plays first. Otherwise, the player with the most points starts. Once a Geek has lost his medal to a contestant, he cannot be challenged again until the final round. Season 1 In the first season, four questions are asked, alternating between the contestant and the Geek, whose questions are much more difficult. If the Geek gives a wrong answer, the contestant wins the challenge, scores points, and gets to wear the Geek's medal for the rest of the game. If the contestant misses a question, the challenge ends and the opponent may score 10 points by giving the correct answer. If all four questions are answered correctly, a Geek-off is played to decide the challenge. The player has 15 seconds to name as many items that fit a certain category as they can think of; the Geek must then do the same in a much harder category. If the Geek cannot come up with more answers, the contestant wins the challenge (ties are broken in the contestant's favor). Resident Geeks' medals are worth 20 points each, while the Guest Geek's medal awards 30. Season 2 A maximum of four questions are asked as in Season 1. Now, though, if the contestant misses a question, the Geek must answer it correctly to win the challenge (the contestant does not need to correct the geek’s error to win if they correctly answered their own question). The opponent does not get a chance to score from a missed question. If both sides miss the same questions or if all four questions are asked, a Geek-off is played. Resident and Guest Geek medals award 20 and 40 points, respectively. =Third round= The third round starts with two more head-to-head challenges, and the trailing player starts. Gameplay is the same as in the second round, with all medals worth 20 more points (40/50 in Season 1, 40/60 in Season 2). After these challenges are over, the Geek-qualizer is played to decide a winner. A list of titles is read to the contestant, who must decide whether each is related to movies, music, or TV. The list continues until the contestant gives an incorrect answer, fails to give an answer within two seconds, or exhausts the list. Then, if they have tied or exceeded their opponent's score, their opponent plays their own Geek-qualizer round with the same rules. The player with the most points after the Geek-qualizer advances to the final round. If there is a tie, a numerical tiebreaker question is asked; the winner is the player who comes closer to the correct answer without going over. NOTE: When a contestant's turn is over, the geek that relates to the last title read explains it. Correct answers are worth 10 points each, with a maximum of 15 items in Season 1 and 16 in Season 2. =Final Round: Geek to Geek Showdown= In the final round, the contestant chooses one of the four Geeks to challenge. The contestant and Geek alternate questions, beginning with the contestant. Each turn, the host gives a category, then the player chooses whether to answer a 1-point (easiest), 2 point (harder), or 3 point (hardest) question; the Geek may not choose a point value lower than the contestant's previous question. If answered correctly, they earn the number of points chosen; otherwise there is no penalty. The first player to reach 7 points wins; if the contestant wins they are awarded $5,000 worth of prizes related to the category of Geek they challenged for the final round. Geeks =Regular Geeks= The host would mention in most episodes in season 1 that if the Geek's expertise slipped, he would be suspended from the show and therefore replaced by a new geek. * Marc Edward Heuck – Movie Geek * Paul Goebel – TV Geek * Andy Zax – Music Geek (Most of Seasons 1 and 2) * Michael Jolly – Music Geek (Part of Season 1) * Michael Farmer – Music Geek (Part of Season 2) =Guest Geeks (alphabetical)= Seasons 1 & 2 * Mike Bracken – Horror Geek (10 episodes) * Holly Chandler – South Park Geek (10 episodes) * Ken Crosby – James Bond Geek (10 episodes) * Gabriel Köerner – Star Trek Geek (15 episodes) * Alan Korsunsky – Comic Book Geek (10 episodes) * Antonio Lopez – Simpsons Geek (10 episodes) * John Steverding – Playboy Geek (10 episodes) Season 1 * Karen Brown – Michael Jackson Geek (5 episodes) * Ivy Shantelle Hover – Sopranos Geek (5 episodes) * Kathy Pillsbury – Star Wars Geek (5 episodes) * Melanie Prudhomme – Friends Geek (5 episodes) * Paul Schmeltzer – Hip Hop Geek (5 episodes) Season 2 * Dan Blau – Beatles Geek (5 episodes) * Krisztian Boldis – Star Wars Geek (5 episodes) * Karla De Trinidad – Friends Geek (5 episodes) * Dana Gould – Planet of the Apes Geek (1 episode) * Rudy Higa – Wrestling Geek (1 episode) * Tim Lakin – Toy Geek (5 episodes) * Christian Malmin – KISS Geek (1 episode) * Mr. Skin – Nudity in Movies Geek (2 episodes) * Ggreg Snyder – Saturday Morning Geek (5 episodes) Guest stars =Season 1= * Neferteri Shepherd (Season 1) * Jerry Springer (Season 1) * Jane Wiedlin (Season 1) * Wil Wheaton (Season 1) =Season 2= * Coolio (Season 2) * Susan Olsen (Season 2) * Jimmie Walker (Season 2) * Devin DeVasquez (Season 2) * Hugh Hefner (Season 2) * Lloyd Kaufman (Season 2) * Peter Noone (Season 2) Hosts J.

In the Domesday Book of 1086, Staverton is mentioned as Stavertone.The Domesday Book, Englands Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde, Northamptonshire page 203 Before the early part of the 18th century, the original village was located behind the church. However, in 1720 a fire broke out which caused damage, destroying many haystacks, stables, grain stores and 22 houses. The total loss was thought to be around £3,000. The result of this was that the village received, via a bequest from Elizabeth Darby, a fire engine. This came into commission in 1767, was kept in the village until quite recently and was later housed at the Daventry museum. A plaque can be seen on a door opposite the village green to this effect. The village green The village has a manor house, situated at the end of Manor Road and thought to have parts originating possibly from Anglo-Saxon times. It is only one of many examples of vernacular architecture in the village. There is an interesting window detail at The Stables in Manor Road. A datestone above the window reads R.R. 1684. Within the village, Well Lane runs parallel to the main A425. It has been conjectured that this was a much earlier approach to the village. The deeply banked sides to the lane bear testimony to it being an ancient right of way. Possibly, with the increase in coaching traffic from the west, the present A425 route was chosen in preference. Along the western boundary of the parish runs the now- disused railway, the last mainline railway to be built in Britain. It was constructed by the Great Central Railway Company between 1894 and 1899 and ran from Nottingham Victoria to London Marylebone. A mission was established for the navviesNavvies in Staverton in the village in a barn situated on the corner of Manor Road and Glebe Lane. This is now part of a private residence.

Landmarks Staverton Church St Mary the Virgin has been a site of Christian worship for well over a thousand years, although the first recorded vicar appears in records started in 1220. A board inside the church lists all subsequent vicars up to the present incumbent. The present church dates from about 1300 with some older parts.The Buildings of England, Northamptonshire, by Nikolaus Pevsner, 2nd Edition revised by Bridget Cherry, Whilton entry. For hundreds of years before this, possibly dating back to before 800 AD, a burial ground existed on the site - as evidenced by the raised churchyard. The main structure that can be seen today dates mainly from the 14th century, although traces of older architecture still remain, such as the lancet window in the north-west corner, which is from the Norman period. The church has many original architectural and historic features. From the top of the tower, sitting on top of one of the highest points in Northamptonshire, it is said that if one were able to travel eastwards maintaining the same altitude, one would not touch land again until reaching the Urals. The ‘new’ north porch, used as the main entrance into the church, dates back 600 years, whereas the south porch is 100 years older. The original door and roof timbers remain. The church has a peal of six bells cast in 1938 by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough. The vicar from 1933 to 1946, Rev. E.S. Powell, initiated the bell restoration; he and his wife were active bellringers.

The village has a traditional green and was mentioned in the Domesday Book.  Ironstone quarrying and the Scaldwell Tramway  Iron ore was quarried around Scaldwell by the Staveley Coal and Iron Company from 1912 until 1963. The company operated a number of ironstone quarries around the villages of Brixworth, Hanging Houghton and Scaldwell. The first pits lay to the east of the Scaldwell to Brixworth Road close to Scaldwell, and began producing ore in April 1913. Two separate gauge tramways transported ore from the quarries, one serving the Hanging Houghton pits, the second longer tramway, starting at Scaldwell and serving all the other quarries. An aerial ropeway was installed to connect the two tramway systems to sidings on the Market Harborough to Northampton railway line. The pits were originally hand worked, but in 1933 steam dragline excavators were introduced, which made the quarrying faster and more efficient. In 1914, new pits were opened near Grange Farm, a mile south of Scaldwell. The Scaldwell tramway was extended to these pits. New ore fields were leased just south of Brixworth village in 1939 and again the tramway was extended to reach them. These Brixworth pits continued in production until 1949 when the pits were abandoned and the tramway extension removed. During the Second World War, a new standard gauge branch line was laid to connect the sidings to the Hanging Houghton quarries; from then on the output from those quarries was no longer carried by the aerial ropeway. This branch was extended to Scaldwell in 1954, and the aerial ropeway was abandoned. From then on, ore was tipped from narrow to standard gauge wagons at Scaldwell. The final ironstone pits in use were a mile and a half south-east of Scaldwell at New Grange Farm. These ceased working in December 1962 and the entire system was abandoned. The narrow gauge tramway and standard gauge branch were removed by 1964, and the remaining pits were landscaped and returned to agricultural use. The final iron ore quarrying in Scaldwell was in the northern pit which operated close to Lamport village between 1961 and 1963 This was served by the standard gauge tramway. By then diesel and electric quarrying machines were used. The tramways used steam locomotives throughout the time they operated.

It was the dominant political force radiating from the interior of Central Java from the late 16th century until the beginning of the 18th century. Mataram reached its peak of power during the reign of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo (), and began to decline after his death in 1645. By the mid-18th century, Mataram lost both power and territory to the Dutch East India Company (Dutch: Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie; VOC). It had become a vassal state of the company by 1749. Etymology The name Mataram itself was never the official name of any polity, as the Javanese often refer to their realm simply as Bhumi Jawa or Tanah Jawi (\\"Land of Java\\"). Mataram refers to the historical areas of plains south of Mount Merapi around present-day Muntilan, Sleman, Yogyakarta, and Prambanan. More precisely, it refers to the Kota Gede area, the capital of the Sultanate on the outskirts of southern Yogyakarta. A common practice in Java is to refer to their kingdom by metonymy, specifically by the location of its capital. Historically, there were two kingdoms that have existed in this region and both are called Mataram. The later kingdom, however, is often called Mataram Islam or \\"Mataram Sultanate\\" to distinguish it from the Hindu- Buddhist 9th-century Kingdom of Mataram. Historiography The key sources to uncover the history of Mataram Sultanate are local Javanese historical accounts called Babad, and Dutch accounts by the Dutch East India Company (VOC). The problems with traditional Javanese Babad, are that they are often undated, obscure and incorporate non-historic, mythological and fantastic elements because these Javanese historical accounts were used as a tool to legitimize the authority of the ruler. An example of a mythical element is the sacred bonds between Panembahan Senapati with mythical Ratu Kidul, the ruler of Java's Southern Seas as his spiritual consort, as claimed in the Babad Tanah Jawi.Babad Tanah Jawi by Dr. J.J. Ras - (34:100 - 36:1) The dates for events before the Siege of Batavia during the reign of Sultan Agung, the third king of Mataram, are difficult to determine. There are several annals used by H.J. de Graaf in his histories such as Babad Sangkala and Babad Momana which contain list of events and dates from the Javanese calendar (A.J., Anno Javanicus), but besides de Graaf's questionable practice of simply adding 78 to Javanese years to obtain corresponding Christian years, the agreement between Javanese sources themselves is also less than perfect. The Javanese sources are very selective in putting dates to events. Events such as the rise and fall of kratons (palaces), the deaths of important princes, great wars, etc. are the only kind of events deemed important enough to be dated, by using a poetic formula chronogram called candrasengkala, which can be expressed verbally and pictorially, the rest being simply described in narrative succession without dates. Again these candrasengkalas do not always match the annals. Therefore, the following rule of thumb is suggested: the dates from de Graaf and Ricklefs for the period before the Siege of Batavia can be accepted as best-guesses. For the period after the Siege of Batavia (1628–29) until the first War of Succession (1704), the years of events in which foreigners participated can be accepted as certain, but - again - are not always consistent with Javanese versions of the story. The events in the period 1704–1755 can be dated with greater certainty since, in this period, the Dutch interfered deeply in Mataram affairs but events behind kraton walls are, in general, difficult to date precisely. History =Formation and Growth= Establishment of the Kingdom Kota Gede, the former capital of Mataram Sultanate, founded in 1582 by Sutawijaya (Panembahan Senapati). Details in Javanese sources about the early years of the kingdom are limited, and the line is unclear between the historical record and myths since there are indications of the efforts by later rulers, especially Agung, to establish a long line of legitimate descent by inventing predecessors. However, by the time more reliable records begin in the mid-17th century the kingdom was so large and powerful that most historians concur it had already been established for several generations. According to Javanese records, the kings of Mataram were descended from one Ki Ageng Sela (Sela is a village near the present-day Demak). In the 1570s, one of Ki Ageng Sela's descendants, Kyai Gedhe Pamanahan was awarded rule of the land of Mataram by the King of Pajang, Sultan Hadiwijaya, as the reward for his service of defeating Arya Panangsang, Hadiwijaya's enemy. Pajang was located near the current site of Surakarta, and Mataram was originally a vassal of Pajang. Pamanahan was often referred to as Kyai Gedhe Mataram. A kyai is a Muslim cleric who is well educated and tend to be well-respected. Meanwhile, in Pajang, there were major power struggles that took place after the death of Sultan Hadiwijaya in 1582. Hadiwijaya's heir, Pangeran (Prince) Benowo, was ousted by Arya Pangiri of Demak, and was removed to Jipang. Pamanahan's son, Sutawijaya or Panembahan Senapati Ingalaga, replaced his father around 1584, and he began to release Mataram from Pajang's control. Under Sutawijaya, Mataram grew substantially through military campaigns against Mataram's overlord of Pajang and Pajang's former overlord, Demak. The new Pajang Sultan, Arya Pangiri, was an unpopular ruler, and Benowo quickly rallied support to regain his throne and recruited Sutawijaya's support against Pajang. Subsequently, Pajang was attacked from two directions: by Prince Benowo from Jipang and by Sutawijaya from Mataram, and was finally defeated. After the defeat of Pajang, Prince Benowo did not dare to stand against Senapati and agreed to bow down to him and submit Pajang to Mataram's rule. This event in 1586, marked the end of Pajang kingdom and the rise of its former vassal, the Mataram Sultanate. The rise of Mataram Senapati assumed royal status by wearing the title \\"Panembahan\\" (literally \\"one who is worshipped/sembah\\"). He revealed the expansive nature of his reign and began the fateful campaign to the East along the course of Solo River that would bring endless conflicts. In 1586, the wealthy port city of Surabaya rose against Panembahan Senapati. Senapati however was unable to penetrate Surabayan defence. He then conquered Madiun in 1590-1 instead, and turned east from Madiun to conquer Kediri in 1591 and Ponorogo. Perhaps during the same time he also conquered Jipang (present day Bojonegoro) and Jagaraga (north of present-day Magetan). He reached east as far as Pasuruan, who may have used his threat to reduce pressure from the then powerful Surabaya. After his campaign in Central and East Java, Panembahan Senapati turned his attention to the West, as he forced Cirebon and Galuh in West Java to acknowledge Mataram's overlordship in 1595. His effort to conquer Banten in West Java in 1597 — witnessed by Dutch sailors — failed, perhaps due to lack of water transport. Later, Demak and Pati revolted and their forces almost reach the Mataram capital, before Senapati's cavalry manage to destroy them. Panembahan Senapati died in 1601 and entombed in Kota Gede, he succeed on establishing a firm foundation of a new state. His successor, Mas Jolang or later known as Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (Hanyakrawati), would face further rebellion. The reign of Panembahan Hanyakrawati (circa 1601–1613), the son of Senapati, was dominated by further warfare, especially against powerful Surabaya, already a major centre of power in East Java. He faced rebellion from his relatives who were installed in the newly conquered Demak (1601–4), Ponorogo (1607–8) and Kediri (1608). In 1612 Surabaya, again, rose against Mataram, as the response Hanyakrawati conquered Mojokerto, destroyed Gresik and burned villages around Surabaya. Surabaya however, was still indomitable. The first contact between Mataram and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) occurred under Panembahan Hanyakrawati. Dutch activities at the time were limited to trading from limited coastal settlements, so their interactions with the inland Mataram kingdom were limited, although they did form an alliance against Surabaya in 1613. Panembahan Hanyakrawati died accidentally that year when he was in Krapyak forest, hunting for deer. He was given posthumous title Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak (His Majesty who Died in Krapyak) =Golden age= Panembahan Hanyakrawati was succeeded by his son, Adipati Martapura. Adipati Martapura however, was of poor health and quickly replaced by his brother, Raden Mas Rangsang in 1613, who assumed the title Panembahan ing Alaga, and later in 1641 took the title of Sultan Agung Hanyokrokusumo (\\"Great Sultan\\"). Mataram Sultanate under the reign of Sultan Agung is popularly remembered as the apogee of Mataram's rule on Java, and the golden age of native Javanese power prior to European colonisation in following century. Surabaya campaign and eastern conquests Panembahan ing Alaga was an able military general and also a warlike ambitious leader, and he aspired to unite Java under Mataram's banner. He responsible for the great expansion and lasting historical legacy of Mataram due to the extensive military conquests of his long reign from 1613 to 1646. Under Sultan Agung, Mataram was able to expand its territory to include most of Java after capturing several port cities of northern Java. Surabaya with its strong fortification and surrounded by swamps, was still the most formidable enemy of Mataram. In 1614, Surabaya forged an alliance with Kediri, Tuban and Pasuruan, and launched invasion against Mataram. In the following year, Sultan Agung managed to repel allied Surabaya forces in Wirasaba (present day Mojoagung, near Mojokerto). He also conquered Malang, south of Surabaya. In 1616, Surabaya tried to attack Mataram but this army was crushed by Sultan Agung's forces in Siwalan, Pajang (near Solo). The coastal city of Lasem, near Rembang, was conquered in 1616 and Pasuruan, southeast of Surabaya, was taken in 1617. Tuban, one of the oldest and largest port cities on the coast of Java, was taken in 1619. Surabaya was Mataram's most difficult enemy. Senapati was not strong enough to attack this powerful city and Hanyakrawati attacked it to no avail. Sultan Agung tried to weakened Surabaya by launching a naval campaign across Java Sea and capturing Sukadana, Surabaya's ally in southwest Kalimantan in 1622, and the island of Madura, another ally of Surabaya, was taken in 1624 after a fierce battle. Soon Madura's fortifications in Sumenep and Pamekasan fell, Agung installed Adipati of Sampang as the Adipati of Madura, stylised as Prince Cakraningrat I. After five years of war, Agung finally conquered Surabaya in 1625. The city was taken not through outright military invasion, but instead through a siege; Agung installed a tight blockade from the land and sea, starving Surabaya into submission. With Surabaya brought into the empire, the Mataram kingdom encompassed all of central and eastern Java, also Madura and Sukadana on southwest Borneo, except for the west and east end of the island and its mountainous south (except for Mataram — of course). Sultan Agung consolidated his political unity by forging marriage alliance of his Adipati to the Princesses of Mataram. Agung himself took the hand of Cirebon Princess as his consort, in an effort to sealed Cirebon as Mataram's loyal ally. By 1625, Mataram was undisputed ruler of Java. Such a mighty feat of arms, however, did not deter Mataram's former overlords from rebellion. Pajang rebelled in 1617, and Pati rebelled in 1627. After the capture of Surabaya in 1625, expansion stopped while the empire was busied by rebellions. Batavia campaign and western conquests Siege of Batavia by Sultan Agung in 1628 Along western Java, Banten and the Dutch settlement in Batavia remained outside of Agung's control. In his effort to unite Java, Agung claimed Mataram as the successor state of Demak, which historically held Banten as a vassal state. However, the Banten Sultanate opposed Agung's claim, preferring to remain as a sovereign state. Agung therefore considered military conquest as a means to coerce Banten into Mataram's hegemony. However, if Agung were march his armies to Banten, the port city of Batavia would stand as a potential opponent too near to the proximity of the Banten region. This did not deter Agung from pursuing his claim as he already perceived Dutch rule of Batavia as a threat to the Mataram hegemony, thereby inciting further reason to march upon Batavia whilst en route to Banten. In 1628, Agung and his armies began the siege of Batavia. The initial stages of the campaign against Batavia proved difficult due to a lack of logistical support for Agung's troops. To avoid a repeat of such inadequacy, Agung established farming settlements along the northern coast of West Java. This saw support from constructed rice barns and Javanese ships filled with rice rations to support Mataram troops. Upon discovery from Dutch ships and spies however, operations of these Javanese ships and rice barns were eventually put to a stop or burned down. As a result, large numbers of Mataram troops again suffered from ill-adequate logistical support and eventually, starvation. Agung's attempt to invade Batavia ultimately ended in failure. Cracking down rebellions and eastern campaign In 1630, Mataram crushed a rebellion in Tembayat (southeast of Klaten) and in 1631–36, Mataram had to suppress rebellion of Sumedang and Ukur in West Java. Ricklefs and de Graaf argued that these rebellions in the later part of Sultan Agung's reign was mainly due to his inability to capture Batavia in 1628–29, which shattered his reputation of invincibility and inspired Mataram's vassal to rebel. This argument seems untenable due to two reason: first, rebellions against Sultan Agung already began as far back as 1617 and occurred in Pati even during his peak of invincibility after taking Surabaya in 1625. The second, and more importantly, the military failure to capture Batavia was not seen as political failure by Javanese point of view. After the failed Batavia campaign, Gresik tried to regain power in East Java and led a revolt that quickly cracked down completely in 1635. The sultan also launched a \\"holy war\\" against the still-Hindu Blambangan in the extreme eastern Java. At that time Blambangan kingdom was supported by Kingdom of Gelgel in Bali that treated it as a buffer against the Islamic expansion of Muslim Mataram. Blambangan surrendered in 1639, but quickly regained their independence and rejoined Bali soon after the Mataram troops withdrew. In 1641, Javanese envoys sent by Agung to Arabia have arrived home after obtaining permission to wear the title \\"Sultan\\" from Mecca. Mecca also sent numbers of ulama to Agung's court. His Islamic name and title gained from Mecca is \\"Sultan Abdul Muhammad Maulana Matarami\\". In 1645 Sultan Agung began building Imogiri, his burial place, about fifteen kilometres south of Yogyakarta. Imogiri remains the resting place of most of the royalty of Yogyakarta and Surakarta to this day. Agung died in the spring of 1646, leaving behind an empire that covered most of Java and stretched to its neighbouring islands. =Decline= Struggles for power Upon taking the throne, Agung's son Susuhunan Amangkurat I tried to bring long-term stability to Mataram's realm, by murdering local leaders that were insufficiently deferential to him, including the still-powerful noble from Surabaya, Pangeran Pekik, his father-in-law, and executed Panembahan Adiningkusuma (posthumous: Panembahan Girilaya), king of Cirebon, his son in- law. He also had closing ports and destroying ships in Javanese coastal cities to prevent them from getting too powerful from their wealth. This action devastated Javanese coastal economy and has crippled Javanese maritime prowess that has been nurtured since Singhasari and Majapahit era, thus making Mataram mainly as an agricultural inland kingdom for centuries to come. Because of this deeds, Amangkurat I was notorious as a ruthless king. He even massacred 5,000-6,000 ulema and their family members due to their alleged involvement in a coup plot.Ivan Aulia Ahsan, Saat 6.000 Ulama dan Keluarga Dibantai Sultan Mataram Islam, Tirto.id, 24 October 2017, retrieved 26 May 2018 Despite his political ruthlessness, unlike his father, Amangkurat I was not an accomplished military leader and dare not to pursue confrontation against the Dutch, as in 1646 he signed peace agreement with them. To further his glory, the new king abandoned Karta, Sultan Agung's capital, and moved to a grander red-brick palace in Plered (formerly the palace was built of wood). By the mid-1670s dissatisfaction with the king was turning into open revolt, beginning from the recalcitrant Eastern Java and creeping inward. The Crown Prince (future Amangkurat II) felt that his life was not safe in the court after he took his father's concubine with the help of his maternal grandfather, Pangeran Pekik of Surabaya, making Amangkurat I suspicious of a conspiracy among Surabayan factions to grab power in the capital by using Pekiks’ grandson's powerful position as the Crown Prince. He conspired with Panembahan Rama from Kajoran, west of Magelang, who proposed a stratagem in which the Crown Prince financed Rama's son-in-law, Trunajaya, to begin a rebellion in the East Java. Raden Trunajaya, a prince from Arosbaya, Madura, led a revolt supported by itinerant fighters from faraway Makassar led by Kraeng Galesong. The Trunajaya rebellion moved swiftly and strong, and captured the king's court at Plered in Mataram in mid-1677. The king escaped to the north coast with his eldest son, the future king Amangkurat II, leaving his younger son Pangeran Puger in Mataram. Apparently more interested in profit and revenge than in running a struggling empire, the rebel Trunajaya looted the court and withdrew to his stronghold in Kediri, East Java, leaving Prince Puger in control of a weak court. Seizing this opportunity, Puger assumed the throne in the ruins of Plered with the title Susuhanan ing Alaga. Amangkurat II and the beginning of foreign involvement Sultan Amangkurat II of Mataram (upper right) watching warlord Untung Surapati fighting Captain Tack of the Dutch East India Company (VOC). ca 1684 AD. On his way to Batavia to ask for Dutch's help, Amangkurat I died in the village of Tegalarum near Tegal just after his expulsion, making Amangkurat II king in 1677. He too was nearly helpless, having fled without an army nor treasury to build one. In an attempt to regain his kingdom, he made substantial concessions to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), who then went to war to reinstate him. He promised to give VOC the port town of Semarang if they lend him some troops. For the Dutch, a stable Mataram empire that was deeply indebted to them would help ensure continued trade on favourable terms. They were willing to lend their military might to keep the kingdom together. The multinational Dutch forces, consisting of light-armed troops from Makasar and Ambon, in addition to heavily equipped European soldiers, first defeated Trunajaya in Kediri in November 1678 and Trunajaya himself was captured in 1679 near Ngantang west of Malang, then in 1681, the alliance of VOC and Amangkurat II forced Susuhunan ing Alaga (Puger) to relinquish the throne in favour of his elder brother Amangkurat II. In 1680, Amangkurat II ascends as the king of Mataram by receiving his crown from the Dutch. As the compensation for Dutch supports, other than Semarang, Mataram has to hand over Bogor, Karawang and Priangan to VOC. Cirebon too was forced to shift allegiance from Mataram to the Dutch, and becomes Dutch's protectorate state. Since the fallen Plered was considered inauspicious, Amangkurat II move the capital to Kartasura in the land of Pajang (northern part of the stretch of land between Mount Merapi and Mount Lawu, the southern part being Mataram). The Dutch also erected a fort in Kartasura in an effort to control as well as protect the new capital. By providing help in regaining his throne, the Dutch brought Amangkurat II under their tight control. Amangkurat II was apparently unhappy with the situation, especially the increasing Dutch control of the coast, but he was helpless in the face of a crippling financial debt and the threat of Dutch military power. The king engaged in a series of intrigues to try to weaken the Dutch position without confronting them head on; for example, by trying to co-operate with other kingdoms such as Cirebon and Johor and the court sheltered people wanted by the Dutch for attacking colonial offices or disrupting shipping such as Untung Surapati. In 1685, Batavia sent Captain Tack, the officer who captured Trunojoyo, to capture Surapati and negotiate further details into the agreement between VOC and Amangkurat II but the king arranged a ruse in which he pretended to help Tack. Tack was killed when pursuing Surapati in Kartasura, then capital of Mataram (present day Kartasura near Solo), but Batavia decided to do nothing since the situation in Batavia itself was far from stable, such as the insurrection of Captain Jonker, native commander of Ambonese settlement in Batavia, in 1689. Mainly due to this incident, by the end of his reign, Amangkurat II was deeply distrusted by the Dutch, but Batavia were similarly uninterested in provoking another costly war on Java. Wars of succession Amangkurat II died in 1703 and was briefly succeeded by his son, Amangkurat III. However, this time the Dutch believed they had found a more reliable client, and hence supported his uncle Pangeran Puger, formerly Susuhunan ing Alaga, who had previously been defeated by VOC and Amangkurat II. Before the Dutch, he accused Amangkurat III of planning an uprising in East Java. Unlike Pangeran Puger, Amangkurat III inherited a blood connection with Surabayan ruler, Jangrana II, from Amangkurat II and this lent credibility to the allegation that he cooperated with the now powerful Untung Surapati in Pasuruan. Panembahan Cakraningrat II of Madura, VOC's most trusted ally, persuaded the Dutch to support Pangeran Puger. Though Cakraningrat II harboured personal hatred towards Puger, this move is understandable since alliance between Amangkurat III and his Surabaya relatives and Surapati in Bangil would be a great threat to Madura's position, even though Jangrana II's father was Cakraningrat II's son-in-law. Pangeran Puger took the title of Pakubuwana I upon his accession in June 1704. The conflict between Amangkurat III and Pakubuwana I, the latter allied with the Dutch, usually termed First Javanese War of Succession, dragged on for five years before the Dutch managed to install Pakubuwana. In August 1705, Pakubuwono I's retainers and VOC forces captured Kartasura without resistance from Amangkurat III, whose forces cowardly turned back when the enemy reached Ungaran. Surapati's forces in Bangil, near Pasuruan, was crushed by the alliance of VOC, Kartasura and Madura in 1706. Jangrana II, who tended to side with Amangkurat III and did not venture any assistance to the capture of Bangil, was called to present himself before Pakubuwana I and murdered there by VOC's request in the same year. Amangkurat III ran away to Malang with Surapati's descendants and his remnant forces but Malang was then a no-man's-land who offered no glory fit for a king. Therefore, though allied operations to the eastern interior of Java in 1706–08 did not gain much success in military terms, the fallen king surrendered in 1708 after being lured with the promises of household (lungguh) and land, but he was banished to Ceylon along with his wives and children. This is the end of Surabayan faction in Mataram, and – as we shall see later – this situation would ignite the political time bomb planted by Sultan Agung with his capture of Surabaya in 1625. With the installation of Pakubuwana, the Dutch substantially increased their control over the interior of Central Java. Pakubuwana I was more than willing to agree to anything the VOC asked of him. In 1705 he agreed to cede the regions of Cirebon and eastern part of Madura (under Cakraningrat II), in which Mataram had no real control anyway, to the VOC. The VOC was given Semarang as new headquarters, the right to build fortresses anywhere in Java, a garrison in the kraton in Kartasura, monopoly over opium and textiles, and the right to buy as much rice as they wanted. Mataram would pay an annual tribute of 1300 metric tons of rice. Any debt made before 1705 was cancelled. In 1709, Pakubuwana I made another agreement with the VOC in which Mataram would pay annual tribute of wood, indigo and coffee (planted since 1696 by VOC's request) in addition to rice. These tributes, more than anything else, made Pakubuwana I the first genuine puppet of the Dutch. On paper, these terms seemed very advantageous to the Dutch, since the VOC itself was in financial difficulties during the period of 1683–1710. But the ability of the king to fulfil the terms of agreement depended largely on the stability of Java, for which VOC has made a guarantee. It turned out later that the VOC's military might was incapable of such a huge task. The last years of Pakubuwana's reign, from 1717 to 1719, were dominated by rebellion in East Java against the kingdom and its foreign patrons. The murder of Jangrana II in 1706 incited his three brothers, regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III, Jayapuspita and Surengrana, to raise a rebellion with the help of Balinese mercenaries in 1717. Pakubuwana I's tributes to the VOC secured him a power which was feared by his subjects in Central Java, but this is for the first time since 1646 that Mataram was ruled by a king without any eastern connection. Surabaya had no reason to submit any more and thirst for vengeance made the brother regents openly contest Mataram's power in Eastern Java. Cakraningkrat III who ruled Madura after ousting the VOC's loyal ally Cakraningrat II, had every reason to side with his cousins this time. The VOC managed to capture Surabaya after a bloody war in 1718 and Madura was pacified when Cakraningrat III was killed in a fight on board of the VOC's ship in Surabaya in the same year though the Balinese mercenaries plundered eastern Madura and was repulsed by VOC in the same year. However, similar to the situation after Trunajaya's uprising in 1675, the interior regencies in East Java (Ponorogo, Madiun, Magetan, Jogorogo) joined the rebellion en masse. Pakubuwana I sent his son, Pangeran Dipanagara (not to be confused with another prince with the same title who fought the Dutch in 1825–1830) to suppress the rebellion in the eastern interior but instead Dipanagara joined the rebel and assumed the messianic title of Panembahan Herucakra. In 1719, Pakubuwana I died and his son Amangkurat IV took the throne in 1719, but his brothers, Pangeran Blitar and Purbaya, contested the succession. They attacked the kraton in June 1719. When they were repulsed by the cannons in VOC's fort, they retreated south to the land of Mataram. Another royal brother, Pangeran Arya Mataram, ran to Japara and proclaimed himself king, thus began the Second War of Succession. Before the year ended, Arya Mataram surrendered and was strangled in Japara by king's order, and Blitar and Purbaya was dislodged from their stronghold in Mataram in November. In 1720, these two princes ran away to the still rebellious interior of East Java. Luckily for VOC and the young king, the rebellious regents of Surabaya, Jangrana III and Jayapuspita died in 1718–20 and Pangeran Blitar died in 1721. In May and June 1723, the remnants of the rebels and their leaders surrendered, including Surengrana of Surabaya, Pangeran Purbaya and Dipanagara, all of whom were banished to Ceylon, except Purbaya, who was taken to Batavia to serve as “backup” to replace Amangkurat IV in case of any disruption in the relationship between the king and VOC since Purbaya was seen to have equal \\"legitimacy\\" by VOC. It is obvious from these two Wars of Succession that even though the VOC was virtually invincible in the field, mere military prowess was not sufficient to pacify Java. Court intrigues in 1723–1741 After 1723, the situation seemed to stabilise, much to the delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of VOC's military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that VOC's plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II, this time without any serious resistance from anybody. The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch's effort. In this relatively peaceful situation, the king could not gather the support of his \\"subjects\\" and instead was swayed by short-term ends siding with this faction for a moment and then to another. The king never seemed to lack challenges to his \\"legitimacy\\". The descendants of Amangkurat III, who were allowed to return from Ceylon, and the royal brothers, especially Pangeran Ngabehi Loring Pasar and the banished Pangeran Arya Mangkunegara, tried to gain the support of the Dutch by spreading gossips of rebellion against the king and the patih (vizier), Danureja. At the same time, the patih tried to strengthen his position by installing his relatives and clients in the regencies, sometimes without king's consent, at the expense of other nobles’ interests, including the powerful queens dowager, Ratu Amangkurat (Amangkurat IV's wife) and Ratu Pakubuwana (Pakubuwana I's wife), much to the confusion of the Dutch. The king tried to break the dominance of this Danureja by asking the help of the Dutch to banish him, but Danureja's successor, Natakusuma, was influenced heavily by the Queen's brother, Arya Purbaya, son of the rebel Pangeran Purbaya, who was also Natakusuma's brother-in-law. Arya Purbaya's erratic behaviour in court, his alleged homosexuality which was abhorred by the pious king and rumours of his planning a rebellion against the “heathen” (the Dutch) caused unrest in Kartasura and hatred from the nobles. After his sister, the Queen, died of miscarriage in 1738, the king asked the Dutch to banish him, to which the Dutch complied gladly. Despite these faction strruggles, the situation in general did not show any signs of developing into full-scale war. Eastern Java was quiet: though Cakraningrat IV refused to pay homage to the court with various excuses, Madura was held under firm control by VOC and Surabaya did not stir. But dark clouds were forming. This time, the explosion came from the west: Batavia itself. Chinese War 1741–1743 Chinese prisoners were executed by the Dutch in Batavia on 10 October 1740. In the meantime, the Dutch were contending with other problems. The excessive use of land for sugar cane plantation in the interior of West Java reduced the flow of water in Ciliwung River (which flows through the city of Batavia) and made the city canals an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes, resulting in a series of malaria outbreaks in 1733–1795. This was aggravated by the fall of sugar price in European market, bringing bankruptcy to sugar factories in the areas around Batavia (the Ommelanden), which were mostly operated by Chinese labour. The unrest prompted VOC authorities to reduce the number of unlicensed Chinese settlers, who had been smuggled into Batavia by Chinese sugar factory owners. These labourers were loaded onto ships out of Batavia but the rumour that these people were thrown into the sea as soon as the ship was beyond the horizon caused panic among the remaining Chinese. On 7 October 1740, several Chinese mobs attacked Europeans outside the city and incited the Dutch to order a massacre two days later. The Chinese settlement in Batavia was looted for several days, in which 10,000 Chinese were killed. The Chinese ran away and captured Bekasi, which was dislodged by VOC in June 1741. In 1741, Chinese rebels were present in Central Java, particularly around Tanjung (Welahan), Pati, Grobogan, and Kaliwungu. In May 1741 Juwana was captured by the Chinese. The Javanese at first sided with the Dutch and reinforced Demak on 10 June 1741. Two days later, a detachment of Javanese forces together with VOC forces of European, Balinese and Buginese in Semarang to defend Tugu, west of Semarang. The Chinese rebel lured them into their main forces's position in Mount Bergota through narrow road and ambushed them. The allied forces were dispersed and ran as fast as they could back to Semarang. The Chinese pursued them but were repulsed by Dutch cannons in the fortress. Semarang was seized by panic. By July 1741, the Chinese occupied Kaligawe, south of Semarang, Rembang, and besieged Jepara. This is the most dangerous time for VOC. Military superiority would enable VOC to hold Semarang without any support from Mataram forces, but it would mean nothing since a turbulent interior would disrupt trade and therefore profit, VOC's main objective. One VOC high official, Abraham Roos, suggested that VOC assumed royal function in Java by denying Pakubuwana II's “legitimacy” and asking the regents to take an oath of loyalty to VOC's sovereignty. This was turned down by the Council of Indies (Raad van Indie) in Batavia, since even if VOC managed to conquer the coast, it would not be strong enough to conquer the mountainous interior of Java, which do not provide much level plain required by Western method of warfare. Therefore, the Dutch East India Company must support its superior but inadequate military by picking the right allies. One such ally had presented itself, that is Cakraningkrat IV of Madura who could be relied on to hold the eastern coast against the Chinese, but the interior of Eastern and Central Java was beyond the reach of this quarrelsome prince. Therefore, VOC had no choice but to side with Pakubuwana II. VOC's dire situation after the Battle of Tugu in July 1741 did not escape the king's attention, but – like Amangkurat II – he avoided any open breach with VOC since his own kraton was not lacking of factions against him. He ordered Patih Natakusuma to do all the dirty work, such as ordering the Arch-Regent (Adipati) of Jipang (Bojonegoro), one Tumenggung Mataun, to join the Chinese. In September 1741, the king ordered Patih Natakusuma and several regents to help the Chinese besiege Semarang and let Natakusuma attack VOC garrison in Kartasura, who were starved into submission in August. However, reinforcement from VOC's posts in Outer Islands were arriving since August and they were all wisely concentrated to repel the Chinese around Semarang. In the beginning of November, the Dutch attacked Kaligawe, Torbaya around Semarang, and repulsed the alliance of Javanese and Chinese forces who were stationed in four separate fortress and did not co-ordinate with each other. At the end of November, Cakraningrat IV had controlled the stretch of east coast from Tuban to Sedayu and the Dutch relieved Tegal of Chinese rebels. This caused Pakubuwana II to change sides and open negotiations with the Dutch. In the next year 1742, the alliance of Javanese and Chinese let Semarang alone and captured Kudus and Pati in February. In March, Pakubuwana II sent a messenger to negotiate with the Dutch in Semarang and offered them absolute control over all northern coasts of Java and the privilege to appoint patih. VOC promptly sent van Hohendorff with a small force to observe the situation in Kartasura. Things began to get worse for Pakubuwana II. In April, the rebels set up Raden Mas Garendi, a descendant of Amangkurat III, as king with the title of Sunan Kuning. In May, the Dutch agreed to support Pakubuwana II after considering that after all, the regencies in eastern interior were still loyal to this weak king but the Javano-Chinese rebel alliance had occupied the only road from Semarang to Kartasura and captured Salatiga. The princes in Mataram tried to attack the Javano-Chinese alliance but they were repulsed. On 30 June 1742, the rebels captured Kartasura and van Hohendorff had to run away from a hole in kraton wall with the helpless Pakubuwana II on his back. The Dutch, however, ignored Kartasura's fate in rebel hands and concentrated its forces under Captain Gerrit mother and Nathaniel Steinmets to repulse the rebels around Demak, Welahan, Jepara, Kudus and Rembang. By October 1742, the northern coast of Central Java was cleaned of the rebels, who seemed to disperse into the traditional rebel hideout in Malang to the east and the Dutch forces returned to Semarang in November. Cakraningrat IV, who wished to free the eastern coast of Java from Mataram influence, could not deter the Dutch from supporting Pakubuwana II but he managed to capture and plunder Kartasura in November 1742. In December 1742, VOC negotiated with Cakraningrat and managed to persuade him to relieve Kartasura of Madurese and Balinese troops under his pay. The treasures, however, remained in Cakraningrat's hand. The reinstatement of Pakubuwana II in Kartasura on 14 December 1742 marked the end of the Chinese war. It showed who was in control of the situation. Accordingly, Sunan Kuning surrendered in October 1743, followed by other rebel leaders. In the mid-18th century, Mataram lost much of their lands, by 1743 Mataram only consists of areas around Surakarta, Yogyakarta, Kedu and Bagelen. Cakraningrat IV was definitely not pleased with this situation and he began to make alliance with Surabaya, the descendants of Untung Surapati, and hired more Balinese mercenaries. He stopped paying tribute to VOC in 1744, and after a failed attempt to negotiate, the Dutch attacked Madura in 1745 and ousted Cakraningrat, who was banished to the Cape in 1746. =Division of Mataram= The divided Mataram in 1830, after the Java War. The fall of Kartasura made the palace inauspicious for the king and Pakubuwana II built a new kraton in Surakarta or Solo and moved there in 1746. However, Pakubuwana II was far from secure in this throne. Raden Mas Said, or Pangeran Sambernyawa (meaning \\"Soul Reaper\\"), son of banished Arya Mangkunegara, who later would establish the princely house of Mangkunagara in Solo, and several other princes of the royal blood still maintained rebellion. Pakubuwana II declared that anyone who can suppress the rebellion in Sukawati, areas around present day Sragen, would be rewarded with 3000 households. Pangeran Mangkubumi, Pakuwana II's brother, who would later establish the royal house of Yogyakarta took the challenge and defeated Mas Said in 1746. But when he claimed his prize, his old enemy, patih Pringgalaya, advised the king against it. In the middle of this problem, VOC's Governor General, van Imhoff, paid a visit to the kraton, the first one to do so during the whole history of the relation between Mataram and VOC, to confirm the de facto Dutch possession of coastal and several interior regions. Pakubuwana II hesitantly accepted the cession in lieu of 20,000 real per year. Mangkubumi was dissatisfied with his brother's decision to yield to van Imhoff's insistence, which was made without consulting the other members of royal family and great nobles. van Imhoff had neither experience nor tactfulness to understand the delicate situation in Mataram and he rebuked Mangkubumi as “too ambitious” before the whole court when Mangkubumi claimed the 3000 households. This shameful treatment from a foreigner who had wrested the most prosperous lands of Mataram from his weak brother led him to raise his followers into rebellion in May 1746, this time with the help of Mas Said. In the midst of Mangkubumi rebellion in 1749, Pakubuwana II fell ill and called van Hohendorff, his trusted friend who saved his life during the fall of Kartasura in 1742. He asked Hohendorff to assume control over the kingdom. Hohendorff was naturally surprised and refused, thinking that he would be made king of Mataram, but when the king insisted on it, he asked his sick friend to confirm it in writing. On 11 December 1749, Pakubuwana II signed an agreement in which the \\"sovereignty\\" of Mataram was given to VOC. On 15 December 1749, Hohendorff announced the accession of Pakubuwana II's son as the new king of Mataram with the title Pakubuwana III. However, three days earlier, Mangkubumi in his stronghold in Yogyakarta also announced his accession with the title Mangkubumi, with Mas Said as his patih. This rebellion got stronger day by day and even in 1753 the Crown Prince of Surakarta joined the rebels. VOC decided that it did have not the military capability to suppress this rebellion, though in 1752, Mas Said broke away from Hamengkubuwana. By 1754, all parties were tired of war and ready to negotiate. The kingdom of Mataram was divided in 1755 under an agreement signed in Giyanti between the Dutch under the Governor General Nicolaas Hartingh and rebellious prince Mangkubumi. The treaty divided nominal control over central Java between Yogyakarta Sultanate, under Mangkubumi, and Surakarta, under Pakubuwana. Mas Said, however, proved to be stronger than the combined forces of Solo, Yogya and VOC. In 1756, he even almost captured Yogyakarta, but he realised that he could not defeat the three powers all by himself. In February 1757 he surrendered to Pakubuwana III and was given 4000 households, all taken from Pakubuwana III's own lungguh, and a parcel of land near Solo, the present day Mangkunegaran Palace, and the title of \\"Pangeran Arya Adipati Mangkunegara\\". This settlement proved successful in that political struggle was again confined to palace or inter- palace intrigues and peace was maintained until 1812. Culture Serimpi dance, many of traditional Javanese courtly artforms and dances found today in Keratons, were developed during Mataram era. Despite being an Islamic Sultanate, Mataram had never adopted Islamic culture, systems and institutions thoroughly. Its political system was more like a syncretism of earlier Javanese Hindu civilisation merged with Islamic elements. The major formation took place during Sultan Agung's reign as he adapted Islam to the Hindu- Javanese tradition and introduced a new calendar in 1633 based on Islamic and Javanese practice. The arts during Sultan Agung's reign were a mixture of Islamic and Hindu-Javanese elements. The mainstream belief system was the Kejawen tradition, while the Islamic beliefs was held by a handful of kiyai or ulama religious elite clustering around Kauman area near court's mosque. The Javanese court ceremonies, culture and rituals of Mataram still bears Hindu- Buddhist elements. Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, and inherited by its successors, the courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman. Javanese kingship Javanese kingship varies from Western kingship, which is essentially based on the idea of legitimacy from the people (Democracy), or from God (divine authority), or both. The Javanese language does not include words with these meanings. The concept of the Javanese kingdom is a mandala, or a centre of the world, in the sense of both a central location and a central being, focused on the person of the king (variously called Sri Bupati, Sri Narendra, Sang Aji, Prabu). The king is regarded as a semi-divine being, a union of divine and human aspects (binathara, the passive form of “bathara”, god). Javanese kingship is a matter of royal-divine presence, not a specific territory or population. People may come and go without interrupting the identity of a kingdom which lies in the succession of semi-divine kings. Power, including royal power is not qualitatively different from the power of dukuns or shamans, but it is much stronger. Javanese kingship is not based on the legitimacy of a single individual, since anyone can contest power by tapa or asceticism, and many did contest the kings of Mataram. List of Sultans of Mataram Mataram was divided in 1755, and the succeeding rulers of the new sultanates are not generally considered as Sultans of Mataram. # Sutawijaya (Panembahan Senopati ing Alaga Sayidin Panatagama Khalifatullah Tanah Jawa) : 1587-1601 # Raden Mas Jolang (Sri Susuhunan Adi Prabu Hanyakrawati Senapati- ing-Ngalaga Mataram) : 1601-1613 # Mas Wuryah (Duke Martapura : 1613 (interim monarch, reigning just for one day) # Raden Mas Jatmika / Sultan Agung (Sultan Agung Senapati-ing-Ngalaga Abdurrahman) : 1613-1645) # Raden Mas Sayidin / Amangkurat I (Kanjeng Susuhunan Prabu Amangkurat Agung) : 1646-1677 # Raden Mas Rahmat (Amangkurat II / Sunan Amral) : 1677-1703 (reigning from Kartasura since 1680) # Raden Mas Sutikna (Amangkurat III / Amangkurat Mas) : 1703-1704 # Raden Mas Darajat (Pangeran Puger / Pakubuwono I) : 1704-1719 # Raden Mas Suryaputra (Amangkurat IV / Sunan Prabu): 1719-1726 # Raden Mas Prabasuyasa (Pakubuwono II) : 1726-1742 # Raden Mas Garendi (Amangkurat V / Sunan Kuning) : 1742-1743 (rebel) # Raden Mas Prabasuyasa (Pakubuwono II) : 1743-1749 (reigning in Surakarta since 1745) Legacy Mataram Sultanate was the last major native polity in Java prior the kingdom broke into of courts of Surakarta and Yogyakarta, and the princedom of Mangkunegaran and Pakualaman, and prior the island was completely ruled by the Dutch. For some Central Javanese, especially those hailed from Yogyakarta and Surakarta city, the Mataram Sultanate, especially Sultan Agung's era, was remembered with pride as a glorious past, as Mataram become the regional hegemon after Majapahit, almost completely unified Java island, and almost succeed to drive the Dutch out of Java. However, for those of former Mataram's rivals or vassals; East Javanese Surabayan, Madurese and Blambangan, also Priangan and Cirebon of West Java, Mataram era is remembered as the era of Central Javanese overlordship over them, marked with authoritarianism and arbitrariness of feudal Javanese regime. In the future this would lead to interregional Madura - Central Java animosity. Also to some degree, Priangan–Mataraman rivalry. Within Mataraman realm, the disintegration of Mataram Sultanate into several competing keratons , also would lead to Surakarta–Yogyakarta rivalry. In art and culture, the Mataram Sultanate has left an everlasting mark in Javanese culture, as many of Javanese cultural elements, such as gamelan, batik, kris, wayang kulit and Javanese dance were formulated, codified and took its present form during this period, inherited and preserved diligently by its successor keratons. During the height of Mataram Sultanate in the first half of the 17th century, Javanese culture expanded, much of Western and East Java region are being Javanized. Mataram's campaign on Eastern Javanese principalities such as Surabaya and Pasuruan expanded Mataraman influences on Java. Mataram expansion includes Sundanese principalities of Priangan highlands; from Galuh Ciamis, Sumedang, Bandung and Cianjur. It was during this period that Sundanese people were exposed and assimilated further into Javanese Kejawen culture. Wayang Golek are Sundanese taking on Javanese Wayang Kulit culture, similar shared culture such as gamelan and batik also flourished. It is probably during this times that Sundanese language began to adopt the stratified degree of term and vocabulary to denote politeness, as reflected in Javanese language. In addition, Javanese scripts also used to write Sundanese as cacarakan. In political aspect, the incessant war of succession, treason, rebellion and court intrigue of Javanese Mataram keraton during the last period of its history, has made Mataram being remembered in quite unflattering way. Combined with Javanese behaviour, such as obsession with elegance and refinements (Javanese: alus), subtleness, politeness, courtesy, indirectness, emotional restraint and consciousness to one's social stature, has made Mataram politics quite complicated, intricate and deceitful. As the result the negative aspects of Javanisation of contemporary Indonesian politics, such as dishonesty, deceptive, treacherousness, rigidity of social hierarchy, authoritarianism and arbitrariness, accompanied by fondness of status display and arrogance, is often attributed to and called as \\"Mataramization\\". A typical negative description of priyayi behaving like the member of Javanese upper class.

An example of a chemical opacifier is titanium dioxide (TiO2), which is used as an opacifier in paints, in paper, and in plastics. It has very high refraction index (rutile modification 2.7 and anatase modification 2.55) and optimum refraction is obtained with crystals about 225 nanometers. Impurities in the crystal alter the optical properties. It is also used to opacify ceramic glazesTin Oxide ( SnO2 ) Stannic Oxide – Properties and Applications, The A to Z of Materials. and milk glass; bone ash is also used. Opacifiers must have a refractive index (RI) substantially different from the system. Conversely, clarity may be achieved in a system by choosing components with very similar refractive indices. Glasses Ancient milk glasses used crystals of calcium antimonate, formed in the melt from calcium present in the glass and an antimony additive. Opaque yellow glasses contained crystals of lead antimonate; bindheimite mineral may have been used as the additive. Under oxidizing condition, lead also forms incompletely dissolved lead pyroantimonate (Pb2Sb2O7). From 2nd century BC tin oxide appears in use as opacifier, likely in the form of cassiterite mineral. Opaque yellow can be produced as lead stannate; the color is paler than the lead antimonate one. Later calcium and sodium phosphates became used; bone ash contains calcium phosphate in a high proportion. Calcium fluoride was also used, especially in China. For dental ceramics, several approaches are in use. Spodumene or mica crystals can be precipitated. Fluorides of aluminium, calcium, barium, and magnesium can be used with suitable heat treatment. Tin oxide can be used, but zirconia and titania give better results; for titania, the appropriate resulting particle size is between submicron to 20 µm. Another desirable opacifier is zinc oxide. Opacifiers must also form small particles in the system. Opacifiers are generally inert. X-ray opacifiers In context of x-rays, opacifiers are additives with high absorption of x-rays; typically these are particles or compounds of lead, barium (often barium sulfate), tungsten, or other high atomic weight elements. Sometimes opacifiers are added to medical implants to make them visible under X-ray imaging. This is especially true in the case of most polymers which are often unrecognizable in the body when viewed using X-rays. Rocket propellants In solid rocket propellants and some translucent smokeless powders, the primary method of heat transfer into the propellant grain from the combustion process is by radiation, and opacifiers such as \\"lamp black\\" may be added to the propellant mixture to ensure the heat does not penetrate far below the surface of the grain, which could cause detonation. The opacifiers also prevent sub-surface overheating and localized premature ignition in the grains where imperfections absorbing the thermal radiation are present. Carbon black is commonly used for this purpose; other possible additives are nigrosin, Prussian blue, methylene blue, etc. in amounts ranging commonly between 0.1–0.5%.US Army.

He is known for his work with the Students for a Democratic Society, the New Communist Movement, and, later, the small schools movement. Political activism Klonsky's father, Robert Klonsky, a World War II veteran who fought as a volunteer against the Nationalists during the Spanish Civil War, had been arrested and convicted of \\"conspiring to advocate Marxist views\\" in violation of the Smith Act during the McCarthy period.. The Supreme Court later overturned the case. In the late 1960s Michael Klonsky became the national secretary of the Students for a Democratic Society,. which he joined as a student at San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge).. He was one of five S.D.S. members arrested on May 12, 1969, when \\"anonymous false reports of fire and a shooting\\" sent police and firefighters to the S.D.S. offices in Chicago. In the 1970s he became a leader of the New Communist Movement which broke with the older Communist Party USA and its allegiance to the Soviet Union. He headed the Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist),. in which role he was one of the first U.S. political activists to visit the People's Republic of China.. Klonsky later became critical of Marxist dogma but stayed active in civil rights, anti-war and educational reform politics. Education research Klonsky became one of the leaders of the modern small schools movement. His academic work focused on small school size as a solution to the problems of inner city schools; his early research. on issues of school size and its impact on student achievement, school violence, and dropout rates, helped pave the way towards the development of thousands of new small and charter schools across the country. By 1996, he was the director of the Small Schools Workshop at the University of Illinois, Chicago,. and in 1999, he was named by president Bill Clinton to the Academic Advisory Council of the National Campaign Against Youth Violence, where he advocated small schools as a mechanism for violence reduction.. Klonsky is now a retired professor of education after teaching at several universities, including UIC. and the Fischler School of Education at Nova Southeastern University.

It was aimed at technical and scientific users who would normally buy a machine like a Cray-1 but did not need that level of power or throughput for graphics-heavy workloads. About to be released just as the market was drying up in the post-cold war military wind-down, only a handful were built and only two sold. Background Jean-Yves Leclerc was a computer designer who was unable to find funding in Europe for a high-performance server design. In 1985 he visited Dave Evans, his former PhD. adviser, looking for advice. After some discussion he eventually convinced him that since most of their customers were running E&S; graphics hardware on Cray Research machines and other supercomputers, it would make sense if E&S; could offer their own low-cost platform instead. Eventually a new Evans & Sutherland Computer Division, or ESCD, was set up in 1986 to work on the design. Unlike the rest of E&S;'s operations which are headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, it was felt that the computer design would need to be in the \\"heart of things\\" in Silicon Valley, and the new division was set up in Mountain View, California. Basic design Instead of batch mode number crunching, the design would be tailored specifically to interactive use. This would include a built-in graphics engine and 2 GB of RAM, running BSD Unix 4.2. The machine would offer performance on par with contemporary Cray and ETA Systems. =8 × 8 crossbar= The basic idea of Leclerc's system was to use an 8×8 crossbar switch to connect eight custom CMOS CPUs together at high speed. An extra channel on the crossbar allowed it to be connected to another crossbar, forming a single 16-processor unit. The units were 16-sized (instead of 8) in order to fully utilize a 16-bank high-speed memory that had been designed along with the rest of the system. Since memory was logically organized on the \\"far side\\" of the crossbars, the memory controller handled many of the tasks that would normally be left to the processors, including interrupt handling and virtual memory translation, avoiding a trip through the crossbar for these housekeeping tasks. The resulting 16-unit processor/memory blocks could then be connected using another 8×8 crossbar, creating a 128-processor machine. Although the delays between the 16-unit blocks would be high, if the task could be cleanly separated into units the delay would not have a huge effect on performance. When data did have to be shared across the banks the system balanced the requests; first the \\"leftmost\\" processor in the queue would get access, then the \\"rightmost\\". Processors added their requests onto the proper end of the queue based on their physical location in the machine. It was felt that the simplicity and speed of this algorithm would make up for the potential gains of a more complex load-balancing system. =Instruction pipeline= In order to allow the system to work even with the high inter-unit latencies, each processor used an 8-deep instruction pipeline. Branches used a variable delay slot, the end of which was signaled by a bit in the next instruction. The bit indicated that the results of the branch had to be re-merged at this point, stalling the processor until this took place. Each processor also included a floating point unit from Weitek. For marketing purposes, each processor was called a \\"computational unit\\", and a card-cage populated with 16 was referred to as a \\"processor\\". This allowed favorable per-processor performance comparisons with other supercomputers of the era. The processors ran at 20 MHz in the integer units and 40 MHz for the FPUs, with the intention being to increase this to 50 MHz by the time it shipped. At about 12 Mflops peak per CU, the machine as a whole would deliver up to 1.5 Gflops, although due to the memory latencies this was typically closer to 250 Mflops. While this was fast for a CMOS machine processor of the time, it was hardly competitive for a supercomputer. Nevertheless, the machine was air cooled, and would have been the fastest such machine on the market. The machine ran an early version of the Mach kernel for multi-processor support. The compilers were designed to keep the processors as full as possible by reducing the number of branch delay slots, and did a particularly good job of it. Fatal flaw When it was introduced in 1989, configurations ran from $2 to $8 million, with the largest claimed to run at 1.6 Gflops. In trying to position the machine, Ivan Sutherland noted that their flight simulation systems actually ran at higher speeds, and that the ES-1 was \\"a step down for us\\". When the machine was first announced it was notable for its price/performance ratio. It completely outperformed most competitors machines, at least in theory. With peak performance of 1600 MIPS and a price $2.2 million, it was $1375/MIPS, compared to a contemporary Alliant FX/40 minicomputer at $4650/MIPS. A 1989 Computerworld review of the market for mid-range high-performance machines showed only one machine in the same class, the Connection Machine CM-2. The new leftmost-rightmost algorithm had a fatal flaw. In high-contention cases the \\"middle\\" units would never be serviced, and could stall for thousands of cycles. By 1989, it was clear this was going to need a redesign, but by this point other machines with similar price/performance ratios were coming on the market and the pressure was on to ship immediately. The first two machines were shipped to Caltech in October 1989 and the University of Colorado at Boulder in November, but there were no other immediate sales. One sample ES-1 is in storage at the Computer History Museum. Evans resigned from the E&S; board in 1989, and suddenly the votes turned against continuing the project. E&S; looked for a buyer who was interested in continuing the effort, but finding none they instead closed the division in January 1990.

Clark Kissinger (born 1940) was the National Secretary of Students for a Democratic Society in 1964-65. He visited the People's Republic of China twice during the Cultural Revolution, and is a devoted Maoist. His writings frequently appear in Revolution, journal of the Revolutionary Communist Party, USA. He was an activist for Refuse and Resist and Not in Our Name, and is an activist for World Can't Wait. Early life and education Kissinger graduated from the University of Chicago in 1960. He had previously attended Shimer College, a Great Books college then located in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Subsequently, Kissinger became a graduate student in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin. 1960s activism As National Secretary of SDS, Kissinger was the principal organizer of the first March on Washington against the war on Vietnam in April, 1965. He faced heavy pressure from the League for Industrial Democracy to incorporate opposition to North Vietnam, but kept the motto of the march as simply \\"End the War in Vietnam\\", focusing on the need for immediate US withdrawal. He hoped to build SDS by being the first organization to hold a national march against the war. In 1968, the Chicago Peace Council hired Kissinger to organize a march against the Vietnam War on April 27. Later in the year, he helped organize demonstrations against the Democratic Party National Convention, and testified at the trial of the Chicago Seven. Subsequent activism In the early 1970s, Kissinger was a founder and national officer of the US China Peoples Friendship Association. In 1987, Kissinger co-founded the human rights activist group Refuse & Resist!. He became head of the group's operations in support of Mumia Abu- Jamal. In that capacity, he became particularly known for successfully lobbying the City Council of Santa Cruz, California to adopt a resolution supporting a new trial for Abu-Jamal. In 2000, Kissinger served 90 days in jail after being convicted of violating his probation by speaking at a rally against the death penalty in Philadelphia. The probation had been imposed based on Kissinger's conviction for participating in a peaceful protest in support of Abu-Jamal in Philadelphia. Kissinger had requested permission from the court to speak at the rally, but it was denied. In the 1990s, Kissinger also drew attention for his position that the participants in the 1992 Los Angeles riots were social revolutionaries rather than rioters as portrayed in the media. In 2002, Kissinger was the coordinator of the Not In Our Name statement of conscience against the impending war on Iraq. Pro-war commentators such as Christopher Hitchens and Laura Ingraham pointed to Kissinger's involvement as indicating that opposition to the war was being organized by the far left. Subsequently, he was also the convener of the International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity Committed by the Bush Administration. When the commission released its findings, he was quoted as saying \\"We want this to be a step in the building of mass resistance to war, to torture, to the destruction of the earth.\\" Kissinger is currently the manager of Revolution Books in New York City.

The problem is not a general one, such as apathy, but is a more specific one that can be legislated and solved, such as medical malpractice or statutory rape. The speaker should also include some discussion of how the proposed solution will actually solve the problem. However, the legislature included should be plausible and sensible.

However, the winning speeches generally stick to the traditional, more analytical way of speaking. One theme that hasn't changed is that speeches generally have very specific topics ranging from domestic issues to international issues. Generally, the speeches are inspiring and informative. These speeches should have statistics, numbers, and proof (typically consisting of real stories found in the news) to support the various claims made by the speaker, though many speeches nowadays replace many statistics with jokes. Judges can evaluate this speech on any criteria, but usually the style of delivery (measured by the fluidity of the speech as well as the hand gestures, eye contact, memorization, posture, and tone) and content (the proof offered to prove the claims of problems) serve as fair and impartial indicators.

Activist career =Students for a Democratic Society involvement= Dohrn became one of the leaders of the Revolutionary Youth Movement (RYM), a radical wing of Students for a Democratic Society (SDS), in the late 1960s. Dohrn with ten other SDS members associated with the RYM issued, on June 18, 1969, a sixteen-thousand-word manifesto entitled \\"You Don't Need a Weatherman to Know Which Way the Wind Blows\\", in New Left Notes. The title came from Bob Dylan's song, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues.\\"Kolbert, Elizabeth, \\"The Prisoner,\\" The New Yorker Magazine, July 16, 2001, page 49.

A revolution is a war; when > the Movement in this country can defend itself militarily against total > repression it will be part of the revolutionary war. This will require a > cadre organization, effective secrecy, self-reliance among the cadres ... The manifesto also asserted that African-Americans were a \\"black colony\\" within a U.S. government that was doomed to overextend itself. And the RYM was needed to quicken this process. Dohrn said, \\"The best thing that we can be doing for ourselves, as well as for the [Black] Panthers and the revolutionary black liberation struggle, is to build a fucking white revolutionary movement.\\" The ninth annual national SDS conference was held at the Chicago Coliseum on June 18–22, 1969, and the SDS collapsed in a Revolutionary Youth Movement-led upheaval.

On the night of October 1, 1968, Dohrn spoke at a meeting in Chicago to condemn Chicago's Mayor Daley's orders to attack protesters during the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Then, from October 11 to 13, she and SDS held a national meeting at the University of Colorado Boulder wherein Dohrn was a speaker addressing concerns about where the movement was headed and what involvement they could expect as governmental tensions mounted and the student movement splintered into factions. On October 11, 1968, Dohrn suggested she would expand the movement to non-students and do all that was necessary to complete the job of \\"attack, expose, destroy.\\"U.S. Government Printing Office, The Weather Underground report, 1975. Dohrn continued to give speeches on behalf of SDS and Weather Underground and attend leadership conferences for both organizations. On January 29 and 30, 1969, in recognition of the tenth anniversary of the Cuban Revolution, the University of Washington held a Cuba teach-in where Dohrn was a speaker on campus. A month later at a press conference at the regional headquarters of SDS in Chicago, Dohrn spoke of the plans that were under way to \\"attack\\" college graduation ceremonies across the country, saying, \\"Our presence will be known at the graduation ceremonies where the big people will come as speakers.\\" By that time, Dohrn was known as a National Interim Committee member of the SDS and a member of the Weatherman group. =Weather Underground involvement= The Weather Underground was a domestic terror group responsible for bombings of the United States Capitol, the Pentagon, and several police stations in New York, as well as the Greenwich Village townhouse explosion that killed three of its members.Sheppart, Nathaniel, Jr., \\"Chicago Home of a Friend was Refuge for Miss Dohrn\\", The New York Times, December 5, 1980, p A22 Dohrn was a principal signatory on the Weather Underground's \\"Declaration of a State of War\\" in May 1970 that formally declared \\"war\\" on the U.S. Government, and completed the group's transformation from political advocacy to violent action. She recorded the declaration and sent a transcript of a tape recording to The New York Times. Dohrn also co-wrote (with Bill Ayers) and published the subversive manifesto Prairie Fire in 1974 and participated in the covertly filmed Underground in 1976. In late 1975, the Weather Underground put out an issue of a magazine, Osawatamie, which carried an article by Dohrn entitled \\"Our Class Struggle\\"; the article was described as a speech given to the organization's cadres on September 2 of that year. In the article, Dohrn clearly stated support for communist ideology:\\"Weatherman Underground / Summary Dated 8/20/76 / Part #1\\", 1976, pp 23-24, FBI website, retrieved June 8, 2008 > We are building a communist organization to be part of the forces which > build a revolutionary communist party to lead the working class to seize > power and build socialism. ... We must further the study of Marxism-Leninism > within the WUO [Weather Underground Organization]. The struggle for Marxism- > Leninism is the most significant development in our recent history. ... We > discovered thru our own experiences what revolutionaries all over the world > have found -- that Marxism-Leninism is the science of revolution, the > revolutionary ideology of the working class, our guide to the struggle ... According to a 1974 FBI study of the group, Dohrn's article signaled a developing commitment to Marxism-Leninism that had not been clear in the group's previous statements, despite their trips to Cuba and contact with Vietnamese communists there. =Statements about Tate-LaBianca murders= Dohrn was criticized for comments she made about the murders of actress Sharon Tate and retail store owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca by the Charles Manson clan. In a speech during the December 1969 \\"War Council\\" meeting organized by the Weathermen, attended by about 400 people in Flint, Michigan, Dohrn said, \\"First they killed those pigs, then they ate dinner in the same room with them, then they even shoved a fork into the pig Tate's stomach! Wild!\\"There are slightly differing versions of this quote cited in books and news reports. Bugliosi, Vincent, Helter Skelter, 2001 page 297 Barber, David (2008). A hard rain fell: SDS and why it failed, page 211. In greeting each other, delegates to the war council often spread their fingers to signify the fork. Arrests and trials On August 22, 1969, Dohrn was arrested in Chicago and charged with possession of drugs. The defense argued that Chicago Police had conducted an illegal search of the car in which she was a passenger, which led Judge Kenneth R. Wendt of the Narcotics Court of Chicago to dismiss the charges. On September 20, 1969, at an anti-Vietnam War rally at the Davis Cup tennis tournament in Cleveland, police arrested Dohrn and twenty other persons on charges of disorderly conduct. On September 26, 1969, Dohrn was arrested again in Chicago during a rally in support of the eight men accused of conspiracy concerning protests during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, who were on trial for riot conspiracy charges. Dohrn was next arrested on October 9, 1969, by the Chicago police during a rally for the women's faction of the Weathermen group and was later released on a one thousand dollar bond.October 24, 1969, Southern Illinoisan, Oregon, ILL. (AP) On October 31, 1969, a grand jury indicted 22 people, including Dohrn, for their involvement with the trial of the Chicago Eight, and she was again indicted on April 2, 1970, when a Federal Grand Jury indicted twelve members of the Weatherman group on conspiracy charges in violation of anti-riot acts during the \\"Days of Rage.\\"Kushner, Harvey W., Encyclopedia of Terrorism, Sage Publications Inc, 2003, pp 108-109, , ; retrieved via Google Books, September 5, 2008 However, all of these convictions were reversed on November 21, 1972, by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit on the basis the judge was biased in his refusal to permit defense attorneys to screen prospective jurors for cultural and racial bias.United States v. Dellinger, 472 F.2d 340 (7th Cir. 1972). Due to the increasing volatility of the Weather Underground led by Dorhn, on October 14, 1970, Dohrn was added to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. She was removed in December 1973, after District Court Judge Damon Keith dismissed the case against the Weathermen. That dismissal was followed shortly by another, when, on January 3, 1974, Judge Julius Hoffman dismissed a 4-year-old case against twelve members of the Weatherman faction of the Students for a Democratic Society, including Dohrn. She had been charged with leading the riotous \\"Days of Rage\\". =Coming out of hiding= While on the run from police, Dohrn used many aliases (including Bernardine Rae Ohrnstein, H.T. Smith, and Marion Del Gado) and married another Weatherman leader, Bill Ayers, with whom she has two children. During the last years of their underground life, Dohrn and Ayers resided in Chicago, where they used the aliases Christine Louise Douglas and Anthony J. Lee.Sheppart, Nathaniel, Jr., \\"Chicago Home of a Friend was Refuge for Miss Dohrn\\", The New York Times, December 5, 1980, p A22 In the late 1970s, the Weatherman group split into two factions, the \\"May 19 Coalition\\" and the \\"Prairie Fire Collective\\", with Dohrn and Ayers in the latter. The Prairie Fire Collective favored coming out of hiding, with members facing the criminal charges against them, while the May 19 Coalition remained in hiding. A decisive factor in Dohrn's decision to come out of hiding were her concerns about her children.Franks, Lucinda, \\"The Seeds of Terror\\", article, New York Times Magazine, November 22, 1981. Retrieved June 8, 2008. The couple turned themselves in to authorities in 1980. While some charges relating to their activities with the Weathermen were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct (see COINTELPRO), Dohrn pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges of aggravated battery and bail jumping for which she was put on probation.Milwaukee Sentinel, Jan. 14, 1981 After refusing to testify against ex-Weatherman Susan Rosenberg in an armed robbery case, Dohrn was held in contempt of a grand jury and served seven months in prison. Shortly after turning themselves in, Dohrn and Ayers became legal guardians of Chesa Boudin, the son of former members of the Weather Underground Kathy Boudin and David Gilbert, after the couple were convicted of murder for their roles in a 1981 armored car robbery.Former Radical Granted Parole In '81 Killings, NY Times -James Barron August 21, 2003 Later life and professional career Bernardine Dohrn and Bill Ayers in Occupy Wall Street, Zuccotti Park, 2012 From 1984 to 1988, Dohrn was employed by the Chicago law firm Sidley Austin,Haitch, Richard.

Family ties proved Ayers' point, Chicago Tribune, May 18, 2008, last accessed, October 17, 2008. However, Dohrn had not been admitted to the New York or Illinois bar even though she had passed both bar exams; she did not submit an application to the New York Supreme Court's Committee on Character and Fitness, and she was turned down by the Illinois ethics committee because of her criminal record. Trienens said of the Illinois rejection, \\"Dohrn didn't get a [law] license because she's stubborn. She wouldn't say she's sorry.\\" In 1991, Dohrn was hired by Northwestern University School of Law as an adjunct professor. Her title was \\"Clinical Associate Professor of Law\\". She was one of the founders of the Children and Family Justice Center in the Bluhm Legal Clinic at Northwestern Law. Because Dohrn was hired as an adjunct (a temporary assignment), her appointment did not require faculty approval. When law school officials were asked whether or not the dean or the board of trustees approved the hiring, the school responded as follows: \\"While many would take issue with views Ms. Dohrn espoused during the 1960s, her career at the law school is an example of a person's ability to make a difference in the legal system.\\" She retired from Northwestern Law in 2013. =Later politics= In 1994, Dohrn said, \\"I still see myself as a radical.\\"Chepesiuk, Ron, \\"Sixties Radicals, Then and Now: Candid Conversations With Those Who Shaped the Era\\", McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers: Jefferson, North Carolina, 1995, \\"Chapter 15: Bernardine Dohrn: From Revolutionary to Children's Rights Advocate\\", p 239;\\"Acknowledgements\\" section dated by the author as \\"Summer 1994\\" indicating interview took place before that In 2008, Dohrn and Ayers resurfaced into news headlines as presidential candidate John McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin publicly denounced the ties between Ayers and then-presidential candidate Barack Obama.Bumiller, Elisabeth and Healy, Patrick.

Referring to the August 28, 2010 Restoring Honor rally which was promoted by Glenn Beck and held at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., Dorhn said, \\"You have white people armed, demanding the end to the [Obama] presidency.\\" She has also asserted that \\"the real terrorist is the American government, state terrorism unleashed against the world.\\" In popular culture In Aaron Sorkin's 2020 film The Trial of the Chicago 7, Dohrn was portrayed by Alice Kremelberg.

Life and career He was born in Juiz de Fora, in the state of Minas Gerais, but he lived most of his life in Rio de Janeiro. In 1952, he started his career as a low-level cop and, later became a police commissioner, one of the highest ranks in the civil police of Brazil. Following the steps of American novelist Thomas Pynchon, a close friend of Fonseca, he refused to give interviews and felt strongly about maintaining his privacy.Tello Garrido, Romeo. Prólogo en Fonseca Rubem, Los mejores relatos. México: Alfaguara, 1998. His stories are dark and gritty, filled with violence and sexual content, and usually set in an urban environment. He claimed a writer should have the courage to show what most people are afraid to say. His work is considered groundbreaking in Brazilian literature , up until then mostly focused on rural settings and usually treating cities with less interest. Almost all Brazilian contemporary writers acknowledge Fonseca's importance. Authors from the rising generation of Brazilian writers, such as Patrícia Melo or Luiz Ruffato, have stated that Fonseca's writing has influenced their work. He started his career by writing short stories, considered by some critics as his strongest literary creations. His first popular novel was A Grande Arte (High Art), but \\"Agosto\\" is usually considered his best work. One recurring character in Fonseca's books is the lawyer-detective Mandrake. In 2003, he won the Camões Prize, considered to be the most important award in the Portuguese language. In 2012 he became the first recipient of Chile's Manuel Rojas Ibero-American Narrative Award.

He is one of the best known and the most translated post-war Polish writers. While he was first published in the 1950s (a volume titled Chord of Light was issued in 1956), soon after he voluntarily ceased submitting most of his works to official Polish government publications. He resumed publication in the 1980s, initially in the underground press. Since the 1960s, he was nominated several times for the Nobel Prize in literature. His books have been translated into 38 languages. Herbert claimed to be a distant relative of the 17th-century Anglo-Welsh poet George Herbert. Herbert was educated as an economist and a lawyer. Herbert was one of the main poets of the Polish opposition to communism. Starting in 1986, he lived in Paris, where he cooperated with the journal Zeszyty Literackie. He came back to Poland in 1992. On 1 July 2007 the Polish Government instituted 2008 as the Year of Zbigniew Herbert. In 2013, the Zbigniew Herbert International Literary Award was established in honour of the poet and his literary legacy. Biography =1924–1956= Herbert's Austrian ancestor came to Galicia from Vienna around the turn of the 18th and 19th century. The poet's father, Bolesław (half-blooded Armenian), was a soldier in the Polish Legions during World War I and a defender of Lwów; he was a lawyer and worked as a bank manager. Herbert's grandfather was an English language teacher. Zbigniew's mother, Maria, came from the Kaniak family. Before the war Zbigniew Herbert attended the Państwowe VIII Gimnazjum i Liceum im. Króla Kazimierza Wielkiego we Lwowie (during the Soviet occupation the name was changed to High School nr 14). After the German and Soviet invasion and subsequent occupation of Lwów, he continued his studies at the secret meetings organized by the Polish underground, where he graduated and passed the A-level exam (matura) in January 1944. At the same time, (following the Nazi invasion of Poland in 1939) he got involved in conspiratorial action with the AK. During the occupation, he worked as a feeder of lice in the Rudolf Weigl Institute that produced anti-typhus vaccines; he also worked as a salesman in a shop with metal articles. After his A-level exam, he began Polish philology studies at the secret University of Jan Kazimierz in Lwów but had to break them off as a result of moving to Kraków (spring 1944, before the invasion of the Soviet Red Army in Lwów). Lwów after the war became a Ukrainian Soviet city, no longer within Polish borders. Its previous Polish population had been expelled. The loss of his beloved hometown, and the following feeling of being uprooted, were important motifs in his later works. At first, he lived in Proszowice, near Kraków (May 1944 – January 1945). Herbert studied economics in Kraków and attended lectures at the Jagiellonian University and at the Academy of Fine Arts. In 1947, after three years of study, he got his Trade Academy diploma. He lived in Sopot (from 1948), where his parents moved in 1946. He worked different jobs; in the Polish National Bank (NBP) in Gdynia (1 March – 30 June 1948), as a sub-editor of the journal Przegląd Kupiecki, and in Gdańsk department of the Polish Writers' Union (ZLP). He met Halina Misiołkowa there (their relationship lasted until 1957). In 1948 he became a member-candidate of the ZLP but resigned in 1951; however, he joined the union again in 1955. While living in Sopot, he continued his law studies at the Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toruń, where he received a Master of Law. In the same year he was carried on the list on the second year of Philosophy at NCU in Toruń, where he was inter alia a student of his later master, Henryk Elzenberg. In 1949 Herbert moved to Toruń, and worked in the District Museum and in primary school as a teacher. In Autumn 1951 the poet moved to the University of Warsaw, where he continued studying philosophy for some time. At first, he lived alone in very poor conditions in suburban Warsaw, Brwinów, but then (December 1952 – January 1957), he lived in Warsaw itself on Wiejska Street in a room rented by 12 people. Subsequently, Herbert moved to an official flat on Aleje Jerozolimskie. He tried to live from his writing. However, since he did not follow the official socrealistic style of literature and was unwilling to write political propaganda this proved to be unsuccessful. He published theatrical and musical criticisms and reports from exhibits which ignored the criteria of socrealistic art. In 1948 the weekly magazine Tygodnik Wybrzeża published his cycle Poetyka dla Laików (Poetry for Lay People). Herbert also published a few of his reviews in the journal Słowo Powszechne in 1949 under his real name and a year later under a pen name, Patryk. The same happened with his publishing in Tygodnik Powszechny. In 1952 Przegląd Powszechny, published a few of his reviews under a pen name – Bolesław Hertyński. He published under the pen name Stefan Martha in Dziś i Jutro, the PAX Association magazine (1950–1953). These periodicals represented a different styles of Catholicism. Pax sought to 'collaborate' with the communist government, while Tygodnik Powszechny took a more oppositional stance (it was legal but its circulation was limited). Herbert definitely finished his cooperation with PAX in 1953. Przegląd Powszechny was closed and Tygodnik Powszechny was transferred to PAX after it refused to publish an obituary of Joseph Stalin's death. In this situation Herbert decided that his cooperation with PAX was impossible. During this time, he also earned money from biographies and librarian registrations. From January until July 1952, he was a salaried blood donor. He also had to undertake a job not connected with writing again. He worked as a timekeeper in Inwalidzka Spółdzielnia Emerytów Nauczycieli 'Wspólna Sprawa' (from 1 October 1953 till 15 January 1954), and also as a senior assistant in Centralne Biuro Studiów i Projektów Przemysłu Torfowego Projekt Torf (19 January – 31 November). Thanks to the help of Stefan Kisielewski, Herbert worked as a manager of the office of the Chief Management in the Union of Socialist Composers (ZKP) from September 1956 till March 1957. =1956–1981= An excerpt from The Envoy of Mr. Cogito, Gdańsk The year 1956 in Poland marked the end of Stalinism and as a result also of social realism as the only and obligatory style in art and literature. This enabled Herbert's debut as a poet. Thanks to this, his material position also improved. In 1957 supported by Jerzy Zawieyski he received a small studio to live in (in Warsaw) one of the flats distributed for young writers by the Polish Union of Writers (ZLP). He also was granted a scholarship (US$100) that allowed him to go on his first trip abroad. Herbert was attached to his homeland, but at the same time was deeply disgusted by all effects (political, economical, cultural etc.) of the communist rules enforced by the Soviet Union on Poland (arguably the best artistic expression of this disgust is contained in his poem \\"The Power of Taste\\"). Therefore, a will to escape from this gloomy reality and see \\"a better world\\" was one of important driving forces behind his passion for traveling. Even though he spent a great deal of time abroad he never wanted to choose the life of an émigré. Despite administrative difficulties imposed by the communist regime with regard to longer stays abroad he always tried to extend his Polish passport while abroad so that the possibility of coming back home was always open. His first lively impressions from his trips and reflections triggered by the direct contact with the cultural heritage of the Western Europe were enclosed in the essay \\"The Barbarian in the Garden\\" (Barbarzyńca w Ogrodzie, 1962). He also says in his poem The Prayer of Mr. Cogito – The Traveller (Modlitwa Pana Cogito – podróżnika) travelling allowed him to get to know better the world beautiful and of such variety\\". Herbert's trips cost as little as possible, as a poet's finances (from not stable sources: prizes, honorariums for the readings etc.) were very limited. This way of life contributed to his weak health condition in the future; however, he traveled through Vienna to France (May 1958 – January 1959), he visited England (January – March 1959), Italy (June – July 1959) and then France again. He came to Poland in May 1960. The result of that journey was the essay Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie (The Barbarian in the Garden). In Autumn 1960 Herbert travelled to England and Scotland. In December 1963 he went to Paris. In January 1964 he was given the Kościelski Prize in the Polish Library in Paris, which allowed him to extend his stay in the West. In 1964 he spent the summer in Italy (July – August) and in Greece (October 1964). Then he came back to France and at the end of that year he returned to Poland. From 1965 till 1968 he was a member of the editorial team at the monthly magazine Poetry. In 1965-1966 he was a literary manager of the Juliusz Osterwa Theatre in Gorzów Wielkopolski. In October 1965 he was awarded with The Lenau Prize, and he went Vienna to receive it. This period also marks a growing international esteem for Herbert as a man of culture. He becomes a member of Academy of Arts in West Berlin and Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in Munich. He stayed in Austria till spring 1966. Herbert traveled across Germany, and then stayed longer in France (June 1966 – September 1967). He then went back to Germany, visiting the Netherlands and Belgium. On 29 March 1968, he married Katarzyna Dzieduszycka at a Polish consulate in France. At the end of April, the Herberts returned to Berlin. In the summer of 1968, Herbert visited the US (invited by the Poetry Center). He went to New York, California, The Grand Canyon, New Mexico, New Orleans, Washington, D.C. and Los Angeles. At that time, the translation of his works was published in the U.S., which made Herbert one of the most popular contemporary poets in English literary circles. While traveling across the country, he gave several talks in New York, Berkeley and Los Angeles. After visiting the U.S., Herbert went back to Berlin, where he lived until September 1970 (with some short breaks to Poland and a holiday in Italy). In 1969, he took part in Dei Duo Mundi – The Festival of Two Worlds. From September 1970 to June 1971, the Herberts again stayed in the U.S., where the poet gave lectures as a visiting professor at California State University, Los Angeles. From autumn 1971 to spring 1973, not having his own flat, he lived in Artur Międzyrzecki's flat in Warsaw. In 1972, he became a member of the board of the Polish Literary Association (ZLP). At that time, he got involved in pro-democracy actions initiated by writer circles – he was one of the signatories of 'List 17' ('Letter of 17') which supported civil rights of the members of an openly anti-communist organization, The Movement (Ruch). He was also an organizer of protests against censorship. In 1972 he joined the Pen Club. In 1973, he received the Herder's Prize in Vienna. The summer of that year he spent together with Magdalena and Zbigniew Czajkowscy in Greece. He came back to Poland in autumn 1973. He spent the academic year of 1973/74 giving lectures at the University of Gdansk. In 1974, he wrote the 'Letter of 15' ('List 15') which was about the laws of the Polish Community in the Soviet Union. In December 1975, he signed 'Letter of 59' ('Memoriał 59') against the changes in the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland forced by the communist party introducing mostly declarations of eternal loyalty of Poland to the Soviet Union. In 1974, he settled at Promenade's Street in Warsaw. From 1975 to 1981, Herbert lived abroad, mainly in Germany, Austria and Italy. =1981–1998= Herbert came back to Poland at the beginning of 1981 – in the short period of the legal existence of Solidarity, the only independent mass organization in the Soviet bloc. At that time he joined the editorial team of the underground journal Zapis (Record). At the time of the martial law he supported the opposition personally, under his own name – he attended the secret meetings and published in 'second circulation'. His writings have become the manifesto of freedom, the expression of the resistance and the poet himself has become the symbol of uncompromised objection, especially for the young people. Przemysław Gintrowski played a huge role in presenting Herbert to the contemporary audience. Together with Jacek Kaczmarski and Zbigniew Łapiński, he composed the music to the poet's writings and performed it on stage. Herbert himself wasn't pleased with these doings at the beginning. However, later he accepted them and joked that he \\"writes lyrics for Gintrowski\\". In 1986 Herbert moved to Paris. In 1989 he joined the Polish Writers' Association (Stowarzyszenie Pisarzy Polskich). A year later he became a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1991, receiving the Jerusalem Prize gave Herbert another reason to travel to Israel for a while. There he befriended Yehuda Amichai and wrote a poem about him. \\"To Yehuda Amichai, Because you are a king and I'm only a prince\\"... In 1992 the seriously ill poet returned to Warsaw. The fierce anti-communist journalism of Tygodnik Solidarność (1994, # 41) and supporting the statement of the editorial office of Arka magazine about the decommunisation of the elites stoked the controversy among Herbert's opposition friends. He praised the Cold War anti-communist spy Colonel Ryszard Kukliński in an open letter to then president Lech Wałęsa in 1994, and later also expressed support for the Chechen Dzjochar Dudajev.'A Letter to President Dzhokar Dudayev'. In: Tygodnik Solidarność, No. 2 (330), 13 January 1995. See External links. He also organized the financial aid for Chechnya. This wasn't his only initiative. Earlier in an open letter to U.S. President George H. W. Bush he criticized the indifference towards the situation of Kurds. What is more, he supported the investigation of Liga Republikańska (Republican League) in the case of assassination of Stanisław Pyjas and advocated revealing the UB (Office of Security) files from 1956. In 1994 in the interview for Tygodnik Solidarność he criticized not only the Round Table Agreement and the politics of the Third Polish Republic (III Rzeczpospolita), but also accused some prominent public figures, such as Czesław Miłosz and Adam Michnik as being personally responsible for the country's difficulties.'Mr. Cogito's Duels: A Conversation with Anna Poppek and Andrzej Gelberg'. In: Tygodnik Solidarność, No. 46 (321), 11 November 1994. See External links. These controversial opinions prompted counter-polemics that would continue even after Herbert's death. This conflict has its roots in different judgments on the communist regime in Poland at the time of the People's Republic of Poland. In 1993 Herbert became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1994, already in a wheelchair, he traveled to the Netherlands and visited an exhibition about the 17th century tulip mania in the Nieuwe Kerk in Amsterdam. The Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad invited Herbert to visit this exhibition because he wrote a book with essays about the \\"Golden age\\" of the Netherlands. The last years of his life he spent in bed fighting with severe asthma. Despite that he never stopped working – Epilog burzy (Epilogue to a Storm) was published shortly before his death. Zbigniew Herbert died on 28 July 1998, in Warsaw. He was buried in Powązki Cemetery. President Aleksander Kwaśniewski sought posthumously to honor Herbert with the Order of the White Eagle, but his widow Katarzyna declined to accept the honor. On 3 May 2007, Herbert was posthumously awarded with the Order of the White Eagle by President Lech Kaczyński; Herbert's widow Katarzyna and sister Halina Herbert-Żebrowska accepted the Order. Writing =Poetry= \\"The loss of memory by a nation is also a loss of its conscience\\" (Herbert). Plaque at Mehringplatz, Berlin. The first poems by Zbigniew Herbert were published in Dziś i jutro (#37, 1950). Poems entitled: Napis (Inscription), Pożegnanie września and Złoty środek were printed however, without the permission of the author. The real debut occurred at the end of the same year with the publishing of the poem without the title (Palce wrzeciona dźwięków…) in Tygodnik Powszechny (#51). Until 1955 the poet published some of his works in that newspaper; however, kept out of the literary environment. Not having a chance for his own volume of poems, he decided to publish 22 poems in the anthology of modern catholic poetry …każdej chwili wybierać muszę… (Warsaw, 1954). Herbert was introduced to the bigger audience in Premiera pięciu poetów (The debut of five poets) in magazine Życie Literackie (#51, December 1955). He was presented together with other young poets, such as Miron Białoszewski, Bohdan Drozdowski, Stanisław Czycz and Jerzy Harasymowicz. In 1956 he published his debut book of poetry Struna światła (Chord of Light) and year later another one Hermes, pies i gwiazda (Hermes, Dog and Star). A relatively late debut of Herbert made him belong to the modern generation in literature which appeared after 1956, whereas biographically he belonged to the same generation as Krzysztof Kamil Baczyński and Tadeusz Różewicz. Another two books of poetry: Studium przedmiotu (Study of the Object) and Napis (Inscription) were published in 1961 and 1969. In 1974 the main character from another book of poetry Pan Cogito (Mr. Cogito) appeared in the Polish culture. The character of Pan Cogito appeared also in the later works of the author. The poet always liked to use the lyric of role (in which the lyrical persona cannot be identified with the author), multistage irony – the character introduced for good favored the game conducted by the author, between him and the reader. In 1983 the Literary Institute in Paris published another book of poetry by Herbert entitled Raport z oblężonego Miasta i inne wiersze (Report from a Besieged City and Other Poems). In Poland it was reprinted by the underground publishing houses. The time and the circumstances favored the literal understanding of the poem's title. Despite the fact that the title provoked such understanding, it led to the simplification in interpreting the poem. Another book of poems Elegia na odejście (Elegy for the Departure) (1990) was published also in Paris. In 1992, back in Poland, Herbert published Rovigo (Wrocław). Finally, the last work of the poet Epilog burzy (Epilogue to a Storm) came out shortly before his death. Herbert often used elements of mythology, medieval heroes and works of art in his writing, which attracted the attention of the critics. Those elements, however, didn't mean the dead parts of literary convention. Herbert uses the mechanism of special demythologization – he tries to get rid of any cultural layers (if possible) and reach the prototypes, face the antique heroes. In his literary output the past is not treated as something distant or closed – revived characters and events allow making an attempt at understanding not only history but also the current moment. The past is a measure of the present. In Herbert's poetry there is no consistent historiosophic conception. Quite the opposite – there is a clear reluctance towards systems which clarify everything, which explain a course of events as an inevitable logic of history. Everything what can be said about history is a result of a simple observation – namely, that history is (at least it used to be so far) the area where evil is rife, which is accompanied by a handful of indomitable people constantly opposed to it. An individual is not able to change the course of history. However, he is obliged to put up hopeless resistance despite everything. The ethical base of Herbert's artistic work constitutes the conviction that justice of a particular matter and actions taken in its defense; do not depend on a chance of victory. This pathetic message is accompanied by ironic consciousness of the fact that it is delivered in not a very heroic period – a period in which a potential hero is exposed not so much to martyrdom as to ridiculousness. The characteristic of the contemporary world is the fuzzy borderline between good and evil, the degeneration of language, which deprives words of their clear- cut nature, and common debasement of values. Contemporary evil is not demonic and cannot be easily defined. The hero, being aware of his own ridiculousness, provokes critical situations not only for preserving faithfulness of the message but also in order to provoke and force evil to reveal its real nature. Yet, the tough assessment of the present does not mean idealizing history. The last war experiences have put an end to the naïve perception of the past. The exposer's suspicion arises because visions of history are created usually by the winners' chroniclers. Therefore, what is under the fresco Przemiany Liwiusza (Transformations of Livy) should be analyzed diligently. The monumental picture of the ancient heroes can be false, or in other way – it can be based on judging criteria, which should not be acknowledged uncritically. Possibly, the vanquished are those who are entitled to our solidarity. According to Herbert, the field of history being maybe the easiest one to make observations is not the only one in which evil reveals itself. The presence of evil entails the question of life's meaning and order, which means that also of presence of God in the world. The history of literature has not yet settled a dispute over the sacred in Herbert's poetry. In his earliest volumes one can notice two completely different images of God, once he is almighty, cold, perfect and remote and next time powerless by his coming down from heaven Kapłan (Priest), Rozmyślania Pana Cogito o odkupieniu (Mr. Cogito's Reflections on Redemption). The first God is rather disliked – as all abstractions – indeed; everything that is valued in this poetry is small, tangible and close. After all, it is nothing else but senses, especially the most unerring touch, which give us the most reliable support in everyday life. Moreover, in this poetry, one has never reconciled oneself to the collapse of the sacred, as well as to the world of chaos. Against everything, being loyal – even to dead God – make sense. For want of no other refuge, we are supposed to seek power in us to save the world from chaos and nothingness Napis (Inscription). In his later works, there is less such pagan declarations, yet the need for reconciliation is being articulated more and more clearly. Compared to the poems from Epilog Burzy (Epilogue to the Storm) and his previous works, Puste Niebo Pana Cogito collected not very favourable critics' opinions. Statue of Zbigniew Herbert in Kielce, Poland Poetic style In his works he presented the 'reflection-intellectual' perspective, with stress on human beings and their dignity, to the background of history, where people are almost irrelevant cogs in the machine of fate. He often used elements of Mediterranean culture in his works. > \\"Herbert's steadily detached, ironic and historically minded style > represents, I suppose, a form of classicism.

Alvarez, Under > Pressure (1965) > \\"If the key to contemporary Polish poetry is the selective experience of the > last decades, Herbert is perhaps the most skillful in expressing it and can > be called a poet of historical irony. He achieves a sort of precarious > equilibrium by endowing the patterns of civilization with meanings, in spite > of all its horrors.\\" – Czesław Miłosz, Postwar Polish Poetry (3rd ed., 1983) > \\"There is little doubt that at this writing Zbigniew Herbert is the most > admired and respected poet now living in Poland. (...) Polish readers have > always revered poets who succeed in defining the nation's spiritual dilemma; > what is exceptional in Herbert is that his popularity at home is matched by > a wide acclaim abroad.\\" – Stanisław Barańczak, A Fugitive from Utopia (1987) In modern poetry, Herbert advocated semantic transparency. In a talk given at a conference organized by the journal \\"Odra\\" he said: > \\"So not having pretensions to infallibility, but stating only my > predilections, I would like to say that in contemporary poetry the poems > that appeal to me the most are those in which I discern something I would > call a quality of semantic transparency (a term borrowed from Husserl's > logic).

It is composed of essays, which describe particular places and things that have been seen by the poet, as well as two historical essays – the story about Albigensians and the persecution of the Templar order. The journey takes place in two dimensions simultaneously – it is both contemporary travel and time travel. The last one starts with prehistory, in the Lascaux caves, lasts over the age of Greek and Roman antiquity, the days of Gothic cathedrals, Renaissance painting and sentimental gardens. The journey becomes fascinating because the traveler shares with his readers the knowledge of the less and more serious history of the places, items and people portrayed in the essays. Even Herbert defined it as not only a journey to the places, but also to books. In Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie there are two historical essays. The theme of the Albigensian crusade and of the collapse of the Knights Templars absorbed Herbert not because of its peculiarity, but quite the opposite, namely because of its ubiquity in history. Therefore, both are described by the poet with proper respect to historical detail and towards the drama of the individuals being involved, thereby timeless crime mechanisms have been revealed. Another collection of essays, Martwa natura z wędzidłem (Still Life with a Bridle), published in 1993, is devoted to seventeenth-century Dutch painting. Just as in Barbarzyńca w ogrodzie, here widely accepted assessments have no impact on the author's personal preferences. Among Dutch painters, the one who fascinates Herbert the most is hardly known Torrentius, whose work Martwa natura z wędzidłem is the only one to be preserved. In this particular volume of essays the figure of traveler is less noticeable than in the previous one. Yet, people still arouse Herbert's interest – not only painters, also those who were buying and often ordering their works – since Dutch painting is typical of a certain civilization and is not possible to exist in any other place or time. Although written much earlier than Martwa natura z wędzidłem, the last volume of essays Labirynt nad morzem (Labyrinth on the Sea-Shore) was published only after the poet's death. Herbert handed in this volume to the Czytelnik publishing house already in 1968, but some time later withdrew it. Labirynt nad morzem consists mainly of essays devoted to ancient Greek culture and history, as well as in a lesser degree to the Etruscans and the Roman legionnaires from Hadrian's wall. This time however, the traveler seems not to be seeking his own way – he copes with the monuments of culture – the Acropolis of Athens or Knossos. Yet, when referring to the history of Greece, Herbert draws out the episodes which take up not too many pages in textbooks, and wrecks view patterns. He shows how Pericles' policy in the case of Samos became the beginning of the end of not only the Greek cities union but also of Athenian democracy. The assessments of history are reviewed in the same way as the one postulated in the poetry – by changing the perspective, rejecting the winners' point of view. That is in Labirynt nad morzem where the above rule was given the most visibly. =Dramas= All Herbert's dramas originated relatively early. The first four dramas were written between the years 1956 and 1961, and only the last one, the monodrama Listy naszych czytelników (Letters from Our Readers), in 1972. Some of these works were created as radio plays, or later, adapted for radio. We can observe this in their structure as tension is produced mainly by means of sound (main characters' voices, sounds in the background, or silence); some other theatrical measures appear to a minimum degree. Even the poet used the term \\"drama for voices\\". Jaskinia filozofów (Cave of Philosophers), probably the most valued among all Herbert's dramas, and Rekonstrukcja poety (The Reconstruction of the Poet) refer to antiquity. The plot of Jaskinia filozofów is set in an Athenian prison cell, where the main character, Socrates, waits for his death sentence. Conversations held with his students, wife and warder let him conduct an examination of his life. However, this is not the only theme brought up in the drama. Socrates could easily escape if he wants, as the death penalty was to be token. Those by whom he was sentenced, presume that he will escape and they saw to it that he had such a possibility. Yet, the philosopher does not reconcile himself to the hypocrisy of freedom without actual freedom – he goes to extremes and finally resigns himself to death. Rekonstrukcja poety refers to Homer. The author of great epics, being already blind, alters his view into something vital and worthy of interest – no more battle's clamor, but now detail, something which is considered to be the most personal and fragile. The remaining three dramas refer to more contemporary themes. The way of showing the ordinariness and triviality of situation, in which evil reveals itself, is extremely convincing. One can crave the other room so much as to wish a neighbour's death or even to contribute to it Drugi pokój (The Other Room). One can be deprived of everything that matters a lot in life, as a result of inhuman regulations and human stupidity. Listy naszych czytelników (Letters From Our Readers). In a small normal town, among respectable people, even murder can happen. The murder which no one is able to explain, and which no one had attempted to stop (Lalek). Awards and prizes According to a note made by the secret police (SB) agent in the Polish Union of Writers (Związek Literatów Polskich) Herbert was a candidate for the 1968 Nobel Prize in Literature along with another Polish writer Witold Gombrowicz. This information was provided by the Nobel committee secretary who was visiting Poland at that time. A historian from the Instytut Pamięci Narodowej Rafał Sierchuła speculates that the communist government in Poland may have made active attempts to prevent them from receiving the prize, due to their anti-communist opinions. * Nagroda Pierścienia Award (Polish Student Union) (1961) * Kościelski Prize (Geneva) (1963) * Jurzykowski Prize (1965) * Nikolaus Lenau Prize (1965) * Austrian State Prize for European Literature (1965) * Herder Prize (Austria) (1973) * Petrarca-Preis (Germany) (1979) *Nagroda Literacka im.

It is used by about 30 deaf and 1370 hearing people (2003). The Adamorobe community is notable for its unusually high incidence of hereditary deafness (genetic recessive autosome). As of 2012, about 1.1% of the total population is deaf, but the percentage was as high as 11% in 1961 before the local chief instituted a policy prohibiting deaf people to marry other deaf. Deaf people are fully incorporated into the community. Under these circumstances, AdaSL has developed as an indigenous sign language, fully independent from the country's standard Ghanaian Sign Language (which is related to American Sign Language). AdaSL is a shared sign language which differs from urban sign languages such as Ghanaian Sign Language because the majority of speakers of a shared sign language aren't actually deaf. National sign languages usually emerge for the purpose of use by deaf individuals such as those attending schools specifically for the deaf. This important feature of shared sign languages alters the way it is maintained, developed, and shared. A historical example of a shared signing community is the island Martha's Vineyard (Martha's Vineyard Sign Language). AdaSL shares signs and prosodic features with some other sign languages in the region, such as Bura Sign Language, but it has been suggested these similarities are due to culturally shared gestures rather than a genetic relationship. AdaSL has features that set it apart from the sign languages of large deaf communities studied so far, including the absence of the type of classifier construction that expresses motion or location (sometimes called \\"entity classifiers\\"). Instead, AdaSL uses several types of serial verb constructions also found in the surrounding spoken language, Akan. Frishberg suggests that AdaSL may be related to the \\"gestural trade jargon used in the markets throughout West Africa\\". Thus AdaSL provides an interesting domain for research on cross- linguistic sign languages. For over a decade, the deaf children of the village have attended a boarding school in Mampong-Akuapem, where the ASL based Ghanaian Sign Language is used. As a consequence, this language has become the first language of these children and their command of AdaSL is decreasing. This is likely to lead to a complete shift of the deaf community in Adamorobe to Ghanaian Sign Language. As such, AdaSL is an endangered sign language.

From 1925 to 1965 the quarrying was to obtain iron ore. It began to the south of the road from the A508 to Pitsford and Brampton Station and worked its way eastward to the A508. From 1959 the quarry was on the east side of the A508. The stone was transported to the main railway by a standard gauge branch operated by steam locomotives. From 1925 to 1939 gannister was also obtained and this was taken from the western part of the quarry to the standard gauge branch by a short 2 foot gauge tramway with its own steam locomotive. The quarry to the west of the main road was smoothed over as was the route of the branch railway but the quarry to the east of the A508 was later reopened for the obtaining of stone for road building, the stone being taken away by lorry. Steam quarrying machines were used at first but diesel machines were introduced from 1927 onwards. The steam machines were scrapped in 1958. Electric machines were also used from 1955. 20,000 trees have been planted on the later quarried area since 2002.

As successful female composer As a female composer of popular music in the first half of the twentieth century, Monnot was a pioneer in her field. Classically trained by her father and at the Paris Conservatory (her teachers included Nadia Boulanger, Vincent d’Indy, and Alfred Cortot), Monnot made the unusual switch to composing popular music after poor health ended her career as a concert pianist when she was eighteen. Soon after writing her first commercially successful song, \\"L'Étranger\\", in 1935, she met Édith Piaf, and in 1940 they became the first female songwriting team in France, remaining friends and collaborators throughout most of their lives. Monnot worked with such lyricists as Raymond Asso, Henri Contet, and Georges Moustaki, and collaborated with musicians and writers including Charles Aznavour, Yves Montand, Boris Vian, and Marlene Dietrich, who gathered in Piaf's living room on a regular basis to play and sing. In 1955, she achieved major success with her setting of Alexandre Breffort's book Irma la Douce, which was translated into English and had long runs in London and on Broadway under the direction of Peter Brook. Her early years Marguerite Monnot was born in Decize, Nièvre, a small city on the Loire River. Her father, Gabriel Monnot, who had lost his sight at the age of three, was a musician and composer of religious music. He was the organist at the Saint-Aré church in Decize and gave piano and harmonium lessons. Monnot's mother, Marie, also gave music lessons and was a teacher of French literature and a writer. Every evening, pupils and friends gathered in their home to play and sing, and the Monnots sometimes invited well-known musicians to join them. Marguerite thus grew up in an atmosphere of music. She rarely attended school: her mother taught her at home, she was tutored in music by her father, and she practiced piano several hours a day. At the age of three, she composed her first little song, \\"Bluette\\". At three and a half, she accompanied a singer at a Paris performance of a Mozart berceuse, receiving a toy stuffed cat as compensation. In 1911, at the Salle des Agriculteurs in Paris, she played Liszt, Chopin, and Mozart and received her first press reviews. From twelve to fifteen years of age, she performed in a number of different cities, including Paris, where Camille Saint-Saëns is said to have remarked of her, \\"I have just heard the best pianist in the world.\\" At age fifteen, she was sent to study in Paris. She had lessons from Vincent d’Indy in harmony and fugue, studied piano with Alfred Cortot, and learned harmony from Nadia Boulanger. The latter helped her to prepare for the Prix de Rome, although it is unclear whether she actually entered the competition formally, and taught her some composition techniques. She toured the capitals of Europe when she was sixteen, and accompanied the dancer Vincente Escuderro in Madrid. It was there that she became keenly interested in Spanish folklore. She was offered the opportunity to become an official musician at the Spanish royal court, but her parents sent her back to Paris instead for further study. Her concert career was interrupted in 1921, on the eve of a United States tour, by a bout of ill health and what the French call \\"le trac\\", or an attack of nerves. Her diffidence and stage fright were to follow her throughout her career as a composer. She became desperately shy when she had to show Piaf a new song, even after years of collaboration. Almost every person who knew Monnot and who later wrote about her has drawn attention to her shyness and absent-mindedness. Her second vocation, songwriting, was just a pastime at first. A fan of popular music on the radio in the early 1920s, including jazz and dance music, she began writing songs because a family friend encouraged her to write a waltz for a film based on a play by Tristan Bernard. This song, written with Bernard in 1931, was entitled \\"Ah! les mots d’amour!\\" and sung by Jane Marny. The lyricist Marc Hély then asked her to compose the music for \\"Viens dans mes bras\\", sung by Lucienne Boyer and published by Salabert. Her talent was quickly recognized, and she was encouraged to continue. She persevered, and in 1935, the song \\"L’Étranger\\" was born out of her collaboration with the journalist-lyricist Robert Malleron and the accordionist-composer Robert Juel, who co-authored the music. The song was awarded the Grand Prix de l'Académie Charles Cros that year. The Piaf years \\"L'Étranger\\" played a key role in Monnot's first encounter with Édith Piaf in 1936. Annette Lajon had sung the song originally, and Piaf wanted to acquire the rights to perform it. The publisher, Maurice Decruck, denied her request, however, because a singer had exclusive rights to a song for a six- month period. So Piaf learned it by heart and sang it at Le Gerny's, the nightclub where she was performing at the time. When Annette Lajon appeared in the audience at Gerny's one night, Piaf is said to have apologized to her for \\"stealing\\" her song. Lajon apparently accepted the apology graciously and introduced Piaf to its composer, Marguerite Monnot, who had accompanied her to the nightclub. The same year, Monnot met the lyricist Raymond Asso, with whom she was to collaborate for many years. He was a former Foreign Legionnaire, and he cut a romantic and exotic figure with his cape and boots. The first of Asso's songs for which Monnot wrote the music was \\"Mon légionnaire\\", which was to become an international standard, published in seven languages. This song, together with another inspired by the same colonial theme, \\"Le fanion de la Légion\\", written in 1938, established Monnot and Asso as a successful songwriting team. This was the era of such songs as \\"Morocco coeurs brulées\\" and the films of Jean Gabin featuring soldiers in North Africa. Some years later, during a trip to Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, Monnot and Asso were awarded decorations by the Foreign Legion. Monnot and Piaf became close friends and began collaborating on songs in the early 1940s. Many of these would become part of Piaf's repertoire for years to come. The two women were certainly the first successful female songwriting team of the era. Their songs were performed not only by Piaf, but by many of the most famous female singers of the day, including Damia, Mona Goya, and Line Viala. These include the songs from the film Montmartre-sur-Seine (\\"Tu es partout\\", \\"Un coin tout bleu\\", \\"Y’en a un de trop\\", \\"Où sont-ils mes petits copains?\\"), \\"Mon amour vient de finir\\" (Damia), and \\"C’était un jour de fête.\\" Monnot devoted the next twenty- five years almost exclusively to writing extraordinarily successful songs for Piaf. Monnot's friendship was extremely important in Piaf's life. In her biography, Piaf calls Monnot her best friend and the woman she most admired in the whole world. She also refers to her pride in having collaborated with Monnot. Piaf paid tribute to Monnot for encouraging her interest in classical music and in learning to play the piano. During the war years, from 1939 to 1945, Monnot collaborated with Henri Contet, writing such songs as \\"Y’a pas de printemps\\", \\"Histoire de coeur\\", \\"Le ciel est fermé\\", and \\"Le brun et le blond\\". They also worked together on the songs for the film Etoile sans lumière, for Piaf, and \\"Ma môme, ma p’tite môme [or gosse]\\" for Yves Montand. In those years, Piaf rehearsed a few songs by Monnot that were never recorded, including \\"Le chant du monde\\" (lyric by Asso), \\"Mon amour vient de finir\\", \\"Les rues du monde\\" and \\"Le diable est près de moi\\" (lyrics by Piaf), and \\"L’hôtel d’en face\\" (lyric by Gine Money). This was also the period when Piaf recorded a number of songs, as mentioned above, which were never released, such as the one with the intriguing title, \\"Je ne veux plus faire la vaisselle\\" (\\"I Don’t Want To Wash Dishes Any More). During Piaf's tour of the stalags in Germany during the war, one of the famous Monnot-Asso songs, \\"Le fanion de la Légion\\", was banned because it had created such patriotic fervor in Parisian audiences. Meanwhile, Monnot remained in Paris, making occasional trips home to Decize to see her mother (her father had died in 1939) and bring provisions from the countryside back to Paris. On 11 July 1950, Monnot married the singer Étienne Giannesini, whose stage name was Paul Péri. The couple had no children. They reportedly made many trips to Decize to visit Monnot's mother, and Monnot wrote songs for Péri, including the music for a detective film, \\"Les Pépées font la loi\\", in which Péri starred in 1954. In the 1950s, Monnot also collaborated with a few new lyricists, including Michel Emer, Luiguy, Norbert Glanzberg, Philippe-Gérard, Florence Véran, and Hubert Giraud, and with the orchestra of Robert Chauvigny. She continued to write for Piaf with another songwriter, René Rouzaud, who had already composed for Damia, Georges Guétary, and Lys Gauty. They wrote the popular \\"La goualante du pauvre Jean\\" (\\"Poor John's Song/Complaint\\"), which, translated as \\"The Poor People of Paris\\" due to confusion between \\"pauvre Jean\\" and \\"pauvre gens\\", became the first French song to hit number one on the American and British record charts. Irma La Douce and beyond Irma La Douce was the first French musical since Offenbach's operettas to enjoy success all over the world. It opened on 12 November 1956, at the Théâtre Gramont in Paris, where it ran for four years. The book and lyrics were by Alexandre Breffort; it was directed by René Dupuy and starred Colette Renard and Miche Roux. A year and a half into the Paris run, the show opened in London. It was directed by Peter Brook and starred Elizabeth Seal and Keith Michell. Eventually the English-language Irma went on to become even more popular than the original French one. The musical opened on 17 July 1958, at the Lyric Theatre in London's West End, where it ran for 1,512 performances. The show opened in New York on Broadway at the Plymouth Theater on 29 September 1960, and ran for 524 performances. It had the unprecedented distinction of playing simultaneously in France, the UK, the US, Canada, South Africa, Australia, Germany, Spain, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Brazil and Argentina. It was recorded under the Sony label and starred Elizabeth Seal and Keith Michell, who had both been part of the London cast. In 1963, Billy Wilder directed the movie version (with some of Monnot's music as background), starring Shirley MacLaine and Jack Lemmon. The film definitely suffered from the failure to include the original songs. Shortly after the success of Irma, Disney Studios reportedly asked Monnot to come to Hollywood and compose for American films, but she refused to leave her settled life in France. From then on, her career in film music was relatively limited. She collaborated regularly with Marcel Blistène, including writing some songs for the film Les amants de demain in 1959. (She had already worked with him on the film Etoile sans lumière in 1946.) She composed other songs for Péri, a singer of \\"realistic\\" songs, such as \\"Encore un verre\\" and \\"Ma rue et moi\\", which have been all but forgotten. She also composed the music for Méphisto and Le sentier de la guerre, written by Claude Nougaro. Generally speaking, Monnot had difficulty separating herself from Piaf's world and composing for others. Although her songs were also sung by such well-known singers as Damia, Josephine Baker, Suzy Solidor, and Yves Montand, the successful ones were few and far between. \\"Ma môme, ma p’tite môme [or gosse]\\" (sung by Damia and Yves Montand) and the songs from \\"Irma\\" were the exception. She did write two fairly successful songs during the 1950s with women lyricists, however. She collaborated with Claude Délècluse and Michelle Senlis on \\"C’est à Hamburg\\" (1955), an even better song called \\"Les amants d’un jour\\" (1956), and then \\"Comme moi\\" (1957). These songs were a synthesis between the first years of the Monnot-Piaf collaboration and the post-war song, between the time of the legionnaires and the end of the dream of colonialism. In 1957, Monnot met the lyricist Michel Rivgauche, with whom she was to write \\"Salle d’attente\\", \\"Fais comme si\\", \\"Tant qu’il y aura des jours\\" and \\"Les blouses blanches\\", at Piaf's apartment . In 1959 Edith Piaf recorded Milord, which became a major international hit and one of Monnot's biggest success. As many of Piaf's biographers tell it, the friendship between the singer and Monnot suffered a serious setback, if not a death blow, after Piaf met the composer Charles Dumont in the late 1950s. Dumont composed what was to be one of Piaf's greatest signature tunes, \\"Je ne regrette rien\\", whereupon Piaf took 11 of Monnot's songs out of her repertoire for her upcoming performance at the Olympia to make room for more Dumont songs. Monnot became ill with symptoms of appendicitis during her last year of life, 1961. She seems to have had a premonition that her illness was life-threatening, yet she failed to follow medical advice and have the operation she needed. Her deep sadness in the last months of her life reveals itself in the following excerpt from a letter to her friend, Madame Niaudet: \\"It means nothing to get old, if you are always surrounded by your loved ones. But how horrible it is to be alone most of the time. I have a tremendous need for rest, especially mentally and emotionally. How terrible it is to have been born too sensitive! Will I soon find the calm I so badly need? There are times when I just despair. Alone in my room, the radio! All those notes! All those minutes, at the end of which lies death and, before the final end, the death of the heart, the love life. It's dreadful, this emptiness inside me.\\" On 12 October 1961, at the age of 58, Marguerite Monnot died in a Paris hospital from a ruptured appendix and the resulting peritonitis. She was buried with her father and mother in the cemetery of her hometown. Her death devastated Piaf -who used to call her \\"La Guite\\"- as well as Monnot's many friends and colleagues, who paid glowing tribute to her and her music. In 1963, the city of Decize renamed the street where she had lived (rue des Écoles) \\"rue Marguerite Monnot\\". It also unveiled a commemorative plaque on the façade of the house where she was born. In 1989, the nursery school in the center of town was also named after her. In 1991, on the thirtieth anniversary of her death, a Mass, concert, and exhibition were held in Decize in her memory. But her true memorial is to be found in her œuvre: the beautiful songs she wrote.

Retrieved 15 November 2009 increasing to 741 at the 2011 Census.  The Church of St Nicholas Overstone  This church is now a chapel of ease in the parish of Sywell with Overstone. OVERSTONE, about four miles from Northampton and just off the A43 road to Kettering is a long linear village with the church of ST NICHOLAS, built in 1807 and remodelled in 1903, standing in a field in Overstone Park a short walk from the village. The church constructed of Kingsthorpe Stone (grey sandstone with streaks of silty clay) was built by John Kipling and replaced the old dilapidated earlier one built at the beginning of the 13th century and situated further into the park in the deserted village of Overstone. During the medieval period of the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries Overstone village was a little further into the park beyond the current church. It was a village of ‘modest size’ and continued throughout the following centuries to be a small village owned by the resident Lord of the Manor. In 1672 the manor is described as having 14 farms and 15 cottages. It is likely that Henry Stratford, Lord of the Manor of Overstone moved the village into its current position sometime around the middle of the 18th century – Eyre's map of 1775 shows the village having moved with only the church and rectory standing in front of the manor house. There are no traces of this first church which during the fifteenth century had four altars dedicated to the saints, Mary, Anne, Thomas and John the Baptist, whilst the manor house has had a variety of owners and a horrible fire in the late 20th century. The north wall of St Nicholas' holds the 'Wantage Window'. Lady Wantage once owned the manor and gave the window in memory of her husband who fought in the Crimean War, winning one of the first VC crosses to be awarded. He is also remembered as being one of the founders of the British Red Cross. There are also several monuments from the old church. The church has been reordered and the pews were removed it is now used for a lunch club, children's and family worship References External links Villages in Northamptonshire Daventry District Civil parishes in Northamptonshire ","title":"Overstone, Northamptonshire"},{"id":"1195730","text":"Old (previously Wold and before that Wolde) is a village and civil parish in the Daventry district of the county of Northamptonshire, England.

The population including Brokhall and Norton at the 2011 census was 434. The village is about east of Daventry, west of Northampton. Junction 16 of the M1 motorway is about south-east and the nearest railway station is at Long Buckby to the east. Near the village, on Watling Street, is the Roman settlement of Bannaventa. History Some of the earliest residents of the village were the Romans, who built the Roman settlement of Bannaventa, a Romano-British fortified town on the eastern outskirts of the village located on the Roman road of Watling Street (A5 London to Holyhead road). Material representing the remains of the Roman settlement of Bannaventa has been recovered from a strip around 200 metres wide on either side of a two kilometre length of Watling Street, in agricultural land north-west of the village, at Whilton Lodge. The settlement's defences were in the form of a trapezium, not aligned with Watling Street, and the enclosure was deeper on the east side of the street than it was on the west. The four sides of the enclosure were 190 m, 200 m, 250 m and 250 m, measured clockwise from north, and enclosed an area of about 55,000 square metres. The defences were built in two - possibly three - phases. First: a large ditch 7.6 m wide and 3.1 m deep backed by a clay and turf rampart was constructed after the end of the first century; second: the primary ditch was filled in with gravel early in the fourth century to provide a firm base for a stone wall with foundations 3.7 m wide and fronted by two newly-cut, parallel ditches; the inner 5.2 m wide and 2.4 m deep and the outer 4.3 m wide and 1.8 m deep; and thirdly: The inner ditch was filled with gravel shortly after the second phase was completed, perhaps intended as the firm base for external towers, though none have been discovered. The outer ditch was allowed to silt up by the end of the fourth century. Occupation of the site, which may have begun before the Roman conquest, continued into the fourth century. There is a Roman villa site at the nearby village of Nether Heyford to the south east. Possible association with Saint Patrick It is possible, but unsubstantiated, that Bannaventa was the birthplace of St Patrick, the patron saint of Ireland. In his Confessio, Patrick writes: This could possibly be an alternative name for Bannaventa. In around 405 AD when he was aged 16 he was kidnapped by \\"pirates\\" who were raiding the imperial highways, and taken to Ireland as a slave. This view is backed by the fact that the Watling Street ran indirectly to north Wales and thus offered easy passage to Ireland.

History =Grammar school= William Beyne, Abbot of Burton Abbey, endowed a grammar school in the early 16th century, functioning by 1531. The boys' grammar school moved to Winshill in 1957. It was administered by the county borough of Burton upon Trent, and known as The Grammar School with about 600 boys. The girls' high school opened in 1928. From April 1974 it was administered by Staffordshire County Council. Another similar nearby school was the Dovecliff Grammar School, formerly Burton Technical School, on St Mary's Drive in Horninglow, which became Wulfric Comprehensive School in 1975, then De Ferrers High School in 1985. =Comprehensive= In 1975 the grammar school was merged with the Burton on Trent Girls' High School and Ada Chadwick Secondary Modern School to become Abbot Beyne mixed Comprehensive School on Mill Hill Lane.

It deals with the patient- inmates of Bridgewater State Hospital for the criminally insane, a Massachusetts Correctional Institution in Bridgewater, Massachusetts. The film won awards in Germany and Italy. Wiseman went on to produce a number of such films examining social institutions (e.g. hospitals, police, schools, etc.) in the United States. The title of the film is taken from that of a talent show put on by the hospital staff. Titicut is the Wampanoag name for the nearby Taunton River. Synopsis Titicut Follies portrays the occupants of Bridgewater State Hospital, who are holed up in empty cells and infrequently bathed. It also depicts inmates/patients required to strip naked publicly, force feeding and indifference and bullying by many of the hospital staff. Production Titicut Follies was the beginning of the documentary career of Fred Wiseman, a Boston-born lawyer turned filmmaker. He had taken his law classes from Boston University to the institution for educational purposes and had \\"wanted to do a film there.\\" He began calling the superintendent of the facility looking for permission to film a year prior to production. Wiseman had previously produced The Cool World, a 1964 film based on Warren Miller’s novel, an experience that informed his desire to direct. He drafted a proposal that was verbally agreed to by the superintendent, which later came into question when the film began distribution. Following that agreement, filming began, with corrections staff following Wiseman at all times and determining on the spot whether the subjects filmed were mentally competent, adding further confusion to an already fraught process.Carolyn Anderson, “The Conundrum of Competing Rights in Titicut Follies,” Journal of the University Film Association, 33, no. 1 (1981): 17, https://www.jstor.org/stable/20687550. While on location, Wiseman recorded the sound and directed the cameraman with his microphone or by hand. He hired John Marshall as his cameraman, an established ethnographic filmmaker. Wiseman and Marshall spent 29 days documenting the conditions at Bridgewater and shot 80,000 feet of film. Wiseman then spent approximately a year cutting the footage into the final 84-minute narrative. Censorship Just before the film was to be shown at the 1967 New York Film Festival, the government of Massachusetts tried to procure an injunction banning its release, claiming that the film violated the patients' privacy and dignity. Although Wiseman had received permission from all the people portrayed or that of the hospital superintendent (the inmates' legal guardian), Massachusetts claimed that this permission could not take the place of release forms from the inmates. Wiseman was also accused of breaching an \\"oral contract\\" giving the state government editorial control over the film. A New York state court allowed the film to be shown, but in 1968, Massachusetts Superior Court judge Harry Kalus ordered the film to be recalled from distribution and all copies destroyed, citing the state's concerns about violations of the patients' privacy and dignity.Walker, Jesse. \\"Let the Viewer Decide.\\" Reason 39 (2007): 50-56. 2007. EBSCOhost. American University, Washington, DC. 5 Nov. 2008. Wiseman appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, which in 1969 allowed it to be shown only to doctors, lawyers, judges, health-care professionals, social workers and students in these and related fields. Wiseman appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which refused to hear the case. Wiseman believes that the government of Massachusetts, concerned that the film portrayed a state institution in a bad light, intervened to protect its reputation. The state intervened after a social worker in Minnesota wrote to Massachusetts governor John Volpe expressing shock at a scene involving a naked man being taunted by a guard. The dispute was the first known instance of a film being banned from general American distribution for reasons other than obscenity, immorality or national security.Lesser, Wendy. \\"Unwise Restrictions\\", The Threepenny Review 48 (1992). 1992. JSTOR. American University, Washington, D.C. 5 Nov. 2008 . It was also the first time that Massachusetts recognized a right to privacy at the state level. Wiseman has said, \\"The obvious point that I was making was that the restriction of the court was a greater infringement of civil liberties than the film was an infringement on the liberties of the inmates.\\" Little changed until 1987, when the families of seven inmates who had died at the hospital sued the hospital and state. Steven Schwartz represented one of the inmates, who was \\"... restrained for 2½ months and given six psychiatric drugs at vastly unsafe levels—choked to death because he could not swallow his food.\\"Horn, Miriam. \\"Shining A Light On Their Follies\\", U.S. News & World Report 114 (1993). 12 Apr. 1993.

Schwartz has said, \\"There is a direct connection between the decision not to show that film publicly and my client dying 20 years later, and a whole host of other people dying in between,\\" \\"... in the years since Mr. Wiseman made 'Titicut Follies', most of the nation's big mental institutions have been closed or cut back by court orders\\"Goodman, Walter. \\"Review/Television; An Unhealthy Hospital Stars in 'Titicut Follies'\\", The New York Times, 6 Apr. 1993: 13. 6 Apr. 1993.

Documentary Film: A Very Short Introduction. New York: Oxford UP, Incorporated, 2007. In 1991, Superior Court judge Andrew Meyer allowed the film to be released to the general public, saying that as time had passed, privacy concerns had become less important than First Amendment concerns. He also said that many of the former patients had died, so there was little risk of a violation of their dignity. The state Supreme Court ordered that \\"A brief explanation shall be included in the film that changes and improvements have taken place at Massachusetts Correctional Institution Bridgewater since 1966.\\" The film was shown on PBS on September 4, 1992, its first American television airing. Before the film, a narrative warning and an introduction by Charlie Rose were played. At the end of the film, a message was shown stating that improvements had been made since the time of the film's production. The film is now legally available through its distributor, Zipporah Films, Inc., for purchase or rental on DVD and for educational and individual license. Zipporah Films released the DVD to the home market in December 2007. In 2020 The film was shown on Turner Classic Movies.

Early life and education Prince Khalid was born on 24 September 1949. He is the oldest son of Prince Sultan and full brother of Fahd bin Sultan, Faisal bin Sultan and Turki bin Sultan. Their mother is Munira bint Abdulaziz bin Musaed bin Jalawi. She died in Paris on 24 August 2011. Moneera bint Abdulaziz was a sister of Alanoud, spouse of King Fahd. She was also cousin of King Khalid and Prince Muhammed. Khalid bin Sultan is a graduate of King Saud University. He attended the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst from January 1967, where he was a corporal in the cadet government, and graduated in 1968, thus fulfilling a teenage dream. He also studied at the US Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas. He graduated from the Air War College at Maxwell Air Force Base in Alabama. He also holds a master's degree in political science, which he received from Auburn University at Montgomery in 1980. Career In the first years as a soldier, despite his choice to be selected for special forces personnel, Khalid bin Sultan was given a command of an artillery platoon in Tabuk province. Later, his position advanced as he was given a task for conducting contract and purchasing of Saudi Arabia's first guided missile with People's Republic of China. For this prominent role, he was given an honorary title \\"Father of Saudi Arabia's Missile\\". After years in the army, thinking that air defense should be given more important role in the national defense, he established the Saudi air defense force, and became its first commander. Shortly after occupation of Iraq to Kuwait in the first Persian Gulf War, he was chosen as the commander of the joint Arab forces, and shared an equal position and responsibility with general Norman Schwarzkopf of US Army. King Fahd promoted Prince Khalid to field marshal afterward. In 1991, he retired from the military to focus on business. In January 2001, he was brought back into the military as assistant defense minister for military affairs. In early 2011, he announced that “more than 70 percent of military equipment can be produced locally\\" and the future creation of a government branch for domestic military growth. He was regarded as a likely candidate to replace his deceased father as defense minister in 2011. However, he was appointed deputy defense minister in November 2011. His term lasted until 20 April 2013 when he was replaced by Fahd bin Abdullah, another member of the royal family. Traditionally, the decision follows exemption \\"based on his request,\\" but the royal order issued exempting Khalid bin Sultan from office, did not include this phrase. 2009 Yemen bombing In November 2009, Khalid bin Sultan led a Saudi military intervention in Yemen. The campaign had various tactical mistakes and Khalid was heavily criticized. The Saudis had 130 casualties and Yemen lost over 1000. In December 2009, Khalid gave a 48-hour ultimatum for Houthi withdrawal from Al Jabri. Soon, he declared that the campaign had ended after the Houthi promised through Al-Quds Al-Arabi they would withdraw from the border in exchange for a ceasefire. The Houthi also stated that the Yemen government had used Saudi territory to bomb targets. In February 2010, Ambassador Smith met with Khalid. Smith brought attention to Saudi air strikes on Yemeni hospitals. Khalid admitted that the event occurred because Yemen had designated the area as a Houthi military base. He also stated that this event occurred because of inaccurate military equipment and the U.S. refusal to provide Predators. He went on to state that Saudi strategy was to force the Houthis to reconcile with the Yemeni government by a strong show of military force. He complained that it was difficult to avoid civilian casualties. The Saudi-Yemeni joint committee granted clearances to Khalid bin Sultan for attacks to be conducted. He complained that Yemeni intelligence was unreliable and politically motivated. Yemen data claimed terrorist positions in a place when in actuality the place was the office of General Ali Mohsen Al Ahmar, a political adversary to President Saleh. =Controversy= King Abdullah was not pleased by Khalid's leadership when Saudi troops could not quickly push back al Houthis Yemeni rebels, who had seized Saudi territory in late 2009. King Abdullah specifically expressed his concerns over the long duration of the conflict, large number of casualties, and Saudi incompetence. Therefore, this situation led to decrease in his potential succession of his father as defense minister. Joseph A. Kéchichian, a Middle East analyst, argued after Khalid's removal from office on 20 April 2013 that there are three potential reasons for his dismissal, one of which is about his activity in 2009 mentioned above. The others were related to his involvement in procurement of arms in 2010 and 2013.  Paradise Papers  In November 2017 an investigation conducted by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalism cited his name in the list of politicians named in \\"Paradise Papers\\" allegations. Other positions At the end of the 1990s, Prince Khalid had business contacts with French electronics group Thomson-CSF. Khalid is the chairman for the committee of the Prince Sultan bin Abdul-Aziz International Prize for Water.\\"About the Prize\\" psipw.org. Retrieved 31 December 2008. He is chair of board of trustees of Sultan bin Abdulaziz Al Saud Foundation. He is also a member of the board of trustees of the Arab Thought Foundation that is a Saudi think-tank group, attempting to improve the relations between Arab nations and the Western nations. He owns the newspaper Al-Hayat. It is said that he does not interfere in its articles as long as no royal criticism is published. Views =Turkish-Arab relations= In the late 1990s, Khalid expressed an opinion concerning the Turkish-Arab relations. According to him, Arabs should ask themselves what brought about this crisis. After criticizing Arab politics for an inability to \\"cope with rapid changes on the ground,\\" he states how they \\"assumed Turkey would be on their side forever, even if it gained no benefit thereby.\\" The Arab side, on the other hand, \\"did not comprehend the complexities of the internal situation in Turkey, or that country's regional and international considerations. This created a climate that could push Turkey ever further into the camp of unfriendly countries.\\" Finally, he proposed improving Turkish-Arab ties \\"[s]olely by granting supreme importance to mutual economic interests. It is vital to find a form of economic integration between the Arabs and Turks, even if it is a gradual process.\\" And he proposes Turkish-Arab cultural collaboration, calling on Arabs and Turks to \\"start purging history books and textbooks of mutual insults.\\" He also encouraged military cooperation between Turkey, Pakistan, and Arab states of the Persian Gulf. =Ethiopia= In February 2013, Khalid made a statement about Ethiopia's right to use the Nile waters, which was officially denounced by the Saudi government. His remarks were as follows: \\"The Ethiopian Renaissance dam….is for political plotting rather than for economic gain and constitutes a threat to Egyptian and Sudanese national security.\\" Personal life Khalid's first marriage was to his first cousin, Lulua, King Fahd's daughter. They divorced in 1978. They have three children. Their first child, Reema, died four months old. His other children from his first marriage are Faisal (born 1973) and Sara (born 1976). Later, he married to another full uncle's daughter, Abeer bint Turki bin Abdulaziz. They have five children: Hala, Fahd (born 1985), Abdullah (born 1988), Salman (born 1993) and Mishail. One of his daughters, Princess Hala, is the former wife of Turki bin Abdullah, who was then a pilot in the Royal Saudi Air Force, and they married on 13 January 2010. His son Faisal bin Khalid is the governor of the Northern Borders Region. Another son, Abdullah bin Khalid, was the permanent representative of Saudi Arabia to the United Nations in Vienna. He was assigned to the post in September 2019, and his tenure lasted until January 2020 when he was made nonresident ambassador of Saudi Arabia to Slovakia and Slovenia.

The A45 road runs a mile northwest of the village. The nearest railway station is at Long Buckby, northeast. The village nestles below a large hill in the valley of the River Nene. The village name is thought to derive from the nearby River Nene. The hill, called Newnham Hill, is topped by an ancient disused windmill, and has commanding views over the nearby town of Daventry. Also on the hill is a large aerial which is part of the air traffic control system of the British Isles.

The benefice has always been Badby-cum-Newnham, with the vicarage of Badby. As the church is perched high on a bank, the churchyard descends steeply east and south. The chancel, the north aisle and the present nave were built in the early 14th century, on the site of a 12th-century chapel. The western tower was built in the late 14th or early 15th century abutting the west wall and standing on three open arches. The tower has contained six bells since 1660. They were rehung on a new iron frame by John Taylor & Co in 1940. Other village amenities On the green is the Romer Arms, a public house which was originally called the Bakers Arms. It was bought by a man named Romer Williams, who was a hunting man and a lawyer by profession. He renamed it the Romer Arms and it is his family coat of arms that is depicted on the sign. Translated, the Latin inscription on the coat of arms is, 'To do and to suffer is the better way for the Roman'. This is also \\"Maria's Kitchen\\" a Portuguese restaurant. The village had another public house called the New Inn which is now a private residence. This former pub, cafe and hand-pumped petrol station, was on School Hill. A former proprietor, a Mr Howard, displayed a notice that read :You can have tea at teatime :— you can have beer at beer time :— you can have petrol at any time. Other prominent buildings Newnham Hall dates from 1820 and is set in of Northamptonshire Parkland. Newnham Hall was the home of the former Lord Lieutenant of Northamptonshire, Lieutenant Colonel John Walkelyne Chandos-Pole OBE, who died in 1993. Another fine residence is The Grove. Located in the grounds of The Grove, which was owned by the Marriott Family, is the Nuttery which is the site of a hazel orchard. The Nuttery was planted by the Marriotts of Newnham House. Hazel nuts are still picked, sorted in the house and then sent to Covent Garden. Daffodils and snowdrops grow underneath the trees and are picked in the spring for market. The orchard is open to the public. Prominent residents Newnham was the home of Thomas Randolph, a lesser- known 17th century poet. He was born, 15 June 1605, in Newnham at the brown stone gabled house in Poets Way. He was a poet and dramatist as well as a writer of English and Latin verse. He was an author of six plays including The Jovial Philosopher (1630); The Jealous Lovers (1632); The Muses' Looking-Glass (1638), and Amyntas (1638). It was recorded that Randolph was one of Ben Jonson’s cleverest disciples. Pleasant anecdotes are recorded of their relationship and one of Randolph's best poems is his, Gratulatory. Thomas Randolph died in 1634 at the age of 29. =Nigel Lawson= The former Chancellor of the Exchequer of Margaret Thatcher, Nigel Lawson lived close to the village for some years. On 1 July 1992 he was created a life peer as Baron Lawson of Blaby, of Newnham in the County of Northamptonshire. Lawson is the father of journalist and food writer Nigella Lawson, Dominic Lawson, the former editor of The Sunday Telegraph and Tom Lawson, housemaster of Chernocke House at Winchester College. Newnham Windmill At the summit of Newnham Hill near the edge of Beggars Bank is the village's most complete and prominent reminder of the rural industries. It is believed that a windmill has stood at this location as far back as 1661, when it was first recorded in an inventory of the then miller, John Bignell. The current building dates back to the early 19th century and was three floors high.

She was sunk in action against the Confederate ironclad ram CSS Albemarle during the Battle of Plymouth (1864). Southfield was built in 1857 at Brooklyn, New York by John English, and served as a ferry between South Ferry, New York, and St. George, Staten Island, until she was purchased by the U.S. Navy at New York City on December 16, 1861 from the New York Ferry Company. She was commissioned late in December 1861, Acting Volunteer Lieutenant Charles F. W. Behm in command. Service history =Battle of Roanoke Island, 1862= The double-ended gunboat joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Hampton Roads on the afternoon of January 2, 1862. On January 11, Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough ordered Southfield to proceed to Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina, the staging area for an expedition against Roanoke Island, which controlled navigation in the North Carolina sounds. The gunboat was detained at Hampton Roads awaiting troops to fill out her complement until about sunset on January 16 when she got underway south. She reached Hatteras Inlet the next day. Great labor was required to get Goldsborough's ships and the U.S. Army transports over Hatteras bar. The last vessel entered the sounds on February 5, enabling the expedition to get underway. The next morning, February 6, Goldsborough shifted his flag from the deep draft to Southfield since the double-ender was more nimble in shallow water. From her deck, he directed the attack on Confederate defenses, which began on the morning of February 7 with a heavy bombardment of Fort Bartow and was continued until dark. Late in the afternoon, Army troops under Brigadier General Ambrose Burnside landed under the cover of the naval gunfire. The attack was resumed on the morning of February 8 and pressed until about midafternoon, when the Union flag flew over Fort Bartow. Shortly thereafter, the Union ships managed to break through the Confederate obstruction and enter Albemarle Sound. The capture of Roanoke Island assured the Union forces free access to North Carolina's vast system of inland waterways and endangered the South's hold on much of North Carolina and Virginia. Norfolk, Virginia, a Southern strong point of special strategic importance, was flanked; and, in a few months, it was abandoned. Goldsborough was vigorous in exploiting the opening he had created by the conquest of Roanoke Island. Two days later, Elizabeth City, North Carolina was in Union hands. New Bern, North Carolina fell on March 14. Beaufort, North Carolina was captured by the end of April. Southfield played a major role in these Union conquests. =Peninsula Campaign, 1862= Late in May, her effort in behalf of the Union cause in North Carolina was interrupted by General George McClellan's request for more naval assistance in his drive up the peninsula from Fort Monroe toward Richmond, Virginia. Southfield arrived at Hampton Roads on June 2 and devoted most of the summer to operations on the York and James Rivers which form the peninsula. At the end of August, after McClellan had evacuated his army, the double-ender was sent to the Norfolk Navy Yard for badly needed repairs before returning to the North Carolina sounds. =Battle of Washington, 1863= Back in fighting trim, Southfield departed Hampton Roads on December 2, arrived at Hatteras Inlet the next day, and proceeded to Plymouth, North Carolina. On the morning of December 10, she engaged a Confederate land force which attacked that city. A Southern shot pierced her steam chest, disabling her engine and filling the ship with hot steam. The scalding vapor prevented the gunboat's crew from reaching her magazine and thus made it impossible for her guns to continue their fire. Boats were lowered to pull the disabled ship downstream; but , hearing the firing, steamed up, took Southfield in tow, and returned with her to Plymouth. By that time, the Confederate raiders had withdrawn. On the last day of March 1863, Confederate troops attacked and besieged the Union garrison at Washington, North Carolina. Southfield was ordered from Plymouth to the scene of the action where she engaged the investing forces. She and other Union gunboats also carried supplies through the blockade to sustain the beleaguered Northern troops, finally forcing the Southern attackers to withdraw on April 16. The next day, Southfield headed back for Plymouth and, for the following year of relative quiet in the sounds of North Carolina, labored to protect the Union's tenuous hold on the region. =Battle of Plymouth, 1864= However, the approach of the spring of 1864 seemed to stir new life among Confederate forces in the region. In February, they attacked New Bern and captured gunboat . On the first day of March, Southfield and tinclad ascended the Chowan River to assist Army steamer USS Bombshell, which had been cut off by Confederates above Petty Shore. On March 2, they shelled the Southern batteries, enabling Bombshell to dash down to safety. But worst of all, the air was rife with rumors that Rebel ironclad ram CSS Albemarle was ready to descend the Roanoke River to destroy the Union warships in the sounds. On the afternoon of April 17, Confederate ground forces attacked Plymouth with artillery and musketry. The Union gunboats in the vicinity helped to defend the town for the remainder of the day and throughout the next. That night, in anticipation of an attack by Albemarle, Southfield was brought alongside , and the two ships were lashed together for mutual protection and concentration of firepower. Before dawn on the morning of April 19, Albemarle emerged from the Roanoke. Miami and Southfield raced toward her. When the three ships collided, the ram scraped across Miami's bow, smashed through Southfield's starboard side, and pierced the wooden gunboat's boiler. For a moment, both Miami and Albemarle were entangled with the fatally wounded double-ender. The forward ropes which had lashed Southfield to Miami were snapped by the collision, and the aft lines were cut by Miamis crew. Albemarle had a harder time extricating herself from her bested and rapidly sinking adversary. Before she could pull free from the wreck by backing her engines, the ram had taken on so much water that her forward deck was too far depressed to permit her to overtake Miami or to let her guns open fire on the departing side-wheeler. Thus, in sinking, Southfield saved her consort.

Born in Wallasey, then part of Cheshire, he served in the RAF and then trained as a painter at the Royal College of Art. After graduating, he was asked to set up a photography department at Watford College. Moore became interested in photography at a time when photography was still viewed in Britain as an undistinguished craft rather than a serious art form. Influenced by some of the images in Hugo van Wadenoyen's seminal 1947 Wayside Snapshots book - a book which marked the start of the decisive British break with Pictorialism - Moore began to see fresh possibilities in the composition & framing of everyday English landscapes. Moore went on to create black & white fine art photographs; having his first solo gallery show in 1959. He continued teaching for most of his life, and he is widely regarded as one of the great teachers. Visiting the U.S. in 1968, he worked with photographer Minor White at MIT and was influenced by Harry Callahan and Aaron Siskind. He had his first major solo show in 1970 at the Art Institute of Chicago. In 1974 he became a lecturer at the influential Trent Polytechnic, Nottingham, but left in 1978 to pursue his own creative work in Cumbria. From around 1976 the climate in England slowly began to change in favour of art photography; and so Moore finally saw acclaim in his own country with a major London retrospective show at the Hayward Gallery, the publication of a strong book collection of his photography, and a BBC television documentary about his work. Moore's influential work has now been out-of-print for more than twenty years. Quotes from Moore \\"If we did but know it, the weather we so revile in these islands is about as perfect for photographic purposes as it could be made... To this vile weather we owe our most charming effects. If there was no bad weather, there would be no clouds and no gales, no rain and no snow. If there is one time more than another when the country smiles the most, it is during rain.\\"—Raymond Moore. \\"Photography is a means of sifting or extracting visual phenomena - it can be solely concerned with conveying factual information about objects in a particular position in time and space - or it can convey an awareness or revelation of the marvellous.\\"—Raymond Moore. \\"I'm just a go-between, things discover me, I don't discover them. But in them I can find myself and grow\\"—Raymond Moore. Books of photography by Moore * Photographs. (Welsh Arts Council pamphlet, 1968) * Murmurs at Every Turn: The Photographs of Raymond Moore.

Cobb playing Loman at the Morosco Theatre on February 10, 1949. Loman is a 63-year-old travelling salesman from Brooklyn with 34 years of experience with the same company who endures a pay cut and a firing during the play. He has difficulty dealing with his current state and has created a fantasy world to cope with his situation. This does not keep him from multiple suicide attempts. Description Willy Loman is an aging suburban Brooklyn, New York salesman whose less than spectacular career is on the decline. He has lost the youthful verve of his past and his camaraderie has faded away. His business acumen is still at its peak, but he is no longer able to leverage his personality to get by. Time has caught up with him. The play presents Loman's struggle \\"to maintain a foothold in the upward-striving American middle class\\" while combating his own self-doubt that plagues him in reminders from the past that his life rests on unsolid ground. According to Charles Isherwood, Loman is the play's dominant character because \\"It is his losing battle against spiritual and economic defeat that provides the narrative spine of the play.\\" Loman is a symbolic representation of millions of white collar employees who outlived their corporate usefulness. He lives in a world with delusions about how popular, famous, influential and successful he is and about the prospects for the success of his sons. His wife not only allows these delusions, but also buys into them, somewhat. His misplaced values of importance and popularity are shaken to the core by his declining ability to leverage those self-perceived traits successfully as he grows older. Loman's world crumbles around him during the play. According to Associated Press correspondent Cynthia Lowry's review of the drama, \\"we watched an aging, defeated traveling salesman move inexorably toward self-destruction, clinging desperately to fantasies\\". The play begins with the 63-year-old Loman dealing with a recent pay cut after 34 years on the job at a time when he is having difficulty meeting his financial responsibilities. In the second act, he deals with being fired. He is fired by the son of the man who had hired him 36 years prior. In the play, Loman reveals his past in scenes from his memory that the audience is challenged to judge for accuracy. Loman had succeeded in large part due to his ability to ingratiate himself with his bosses and appeal to his potential clients; thus, he continually impresses upon his sons the importance of popularity. Lee J Cobb (Willy), seated, with Arthur Kennedy (Biff), left, and Cameron Mitchell (Happy) in the 1949 production of Death of a Salesman Although the play was performed earlier in Philadelphia, the February 10, 1949 Broadway opening is considered the debut and on February 11, Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times said the following: \\"Mr. Cobb's tragic portrait of the defeated salesman is acting of the first rank. Although it is familiar and folksy in the details, it has something of the grand manner in the big size and the deep tone.\\" While reviewing a touring production of Death of a Salesman, Los Angeles Times critic Laurie Winer described Loman as \\"...the saddest, self-centeredest soul in American drama, a character who will continue to haunt the landscape as long as there are fathers and sons.\\" United Press International critic Rick Du Brow described Loman as \\"...the aging failure of a salesman who has wasted his life by living in a world of delusions and shallow values...\\" Willy is described as a \\"suffering. . .middle-aged man at the end of his emotional rope\\". Lowry described the production as depicting \\"the end of a man when his dream world is shattered\\". The play's author, Arthur Miller, described the role of Willy Loman as one for a large character in a small physical body, and noted he had difficulty finding the right actor at first. The part was originally written for a physically small man, with Willy at one point saying to his wife, \\"I'm short. I'm very foolish to look at.\\" When Cobb was cast, the line was changed to \\"I'm fat. I'm very foolish to look at,\\" and a reference to Willy being called a \\"shrimp\\" was changed to a \\"walrus.\\" Subsequent productions used whichever version was appropriate to the actor playing Willy; Dustin Hoffman, for example, used the original. Loman's Brooklyn accent is part of the challenge of the role. In 1950, Miller described Loman as a man who upon hearing society's \\"thundering command to succeed\\" found himself staring at a failure in the mirror. The Amazon.com editorial review by Ali Davis states that \\"Willy Loman is a salesman desperately hustling for a living even as he slides into old age.\\" Rovi Corporation's Matthew Tobey describes him as an everyman who has to cope with the sudden realization that he is over the hill, and retreats into a fantasy world in which he remains important. The Huffington Post's theater critic, Wilborn Hampton, describes the role as \\"one of the most complicated characters in dramatic literature\\". The play is a statement on the idea that a man is valued by his position in life. Loman never matures enough to realize that being popular without any substance or skill is meaningless in the end, and Miller uses Loman to make a point against anti-intellectualism. In the end, Loman gives way to the belief that his inability to be a successful man and father means that his life has been a failure. Family Willy's marriage to his wife Linda is described as \\"symbolic\\". Linda is a devoted wife who understands her husband's needs, dreams and shortcomings. Linda has emotional scenes as she attempts to manage Willy's emotional collapse and deals with her two adult sons, who have both wasted their lives following the easy road of pursuing popularity, as guided by their father. She breaks down as she confides in her sons about Willy's disintegration and reveals that he has attempted suicide before. Willy has always made the point to his sons that being popular and having contacts is the key to success. His older, less successful son, Biff, causes \\"old hopes and boiling resentments\\" to return by visiting home after losing yet another job. Biff and Willy love each other, but do not get along; Biff resents Willy for insisting he pursue a life he doesn't want, while Willy thinks Biff has failed on purpose to spite him. Their relationship is the emotional lynchpin of the production. Biff attempts to help his father see what has become of him. In the end, Biff decides that he must force his father to see the truth rather than his fanciful images, for his own good, regardless of its toll on his father. This is the emotional climax of the show as he bares his soul, saying, \\"Pop, I'm nothing! I'm nothing, Pop! Can't you understand that? There's no spite in it any more. I'm just what I am, that's all.\\" At Willy's funeral, Biff states that \\"He had the wrong dreams...He never knew who he was.\\". Although Willy's younger son, Happy, is self-absorbed, he attempts to humor his father. He views his Uncle Ben (his father's brother) as his role model rather than his father because Ben went out to the world as a teenager and was rich by the age of 21. He repeatedly reminds Willy of this. In the end, he is determined to not only adopt his father's dream (even when it killed him), but to surpass him as he states \\"It's the only dream you can have -- to come out No. 1 man.\\" Besides interacting with his wife and his sons, Willy spends much time during the play in fantasy conversations with his long-dead brother Ben, whom Willy still idolizes, calling on him for guidance, for instance, when he is fired from his job. Toward the end of the play - when Willy has dreamed up a scheme to kill himself so that Biff can receive the money from his insurance policy and finally become successful—he \\"debates\\" the merits of his plan with Ben, finally deciding to go ahead with it after Ben (in his mind) comes to agree with him that it's a good idea. Critical history Loman is the central role of the only play that has won a Tony Award for Best Broadway Production four times (Best Play, Best Revival and twice Best Revival of a Play). Each of the four Broadway revivals has brought critical acclaim to the role. In addition, the role has been reprised in film with six English-language film portrayals of this character, at least four of which received critical acclaim. Three actors have won Golden Globe Awards playing the role, two have won Drama Desk Awards playing the role and actors playing the role have also won a Primetime Emmy Award, a Screen Actors Guild Award and a Tony Award. The role has been nominated for an Oscar Award, a BAFTA Award, a Grammy Award, three Tony Awards and three Primetime Emmy Awards. At least two West End productions have earned Olivier Awards for this role. Although Cobb did not earn critical acclaim when he originated the role, he did when he reprised it for television. Other actors who have played the role on Broadway or in English-language cinema or television have almost all received critical acclaim. On Broadway, the role was reprised by George C. Scott (1975, Tony nomination), Dustin Hoffman (1984, Drama Desk award), Brian Dennehy (1999, Tony and Drama Desk awards), and Philip Seymour Hoffman (2012, Tony nomination). In cinema and on television, the role has also been highly acclaimed: Fredric March (1951, Golden Globe award and both Oscar and BAFTA nominations), Cobb (1966, Emmy and Grammy nominations), Rod Steiger (1966), D. Hoffman (1985, Golden Globe and Emmy awards), Warren Mitchell (1996) and Dennehy (2000, Golden Globe and SAG awards and Emmy nomination). =Awards= Fredric March won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama at the 9th Golden Globe Awards and was nominated for Academy Award for Best Actor at the 24th Academy Awards and BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role (Foreign) at the 6th British Academy Film Awards. Brian Dennehy won Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play at the 53rd Tony Awards in 1999, while Philip Seymour Hoffman was nominated for the same award at the 66th Tony Awards in 2012 and George C. Scott was nominated for the award at the 30th Tony Awards in 1976. Dennehy also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film at the 58th Golden Globe Awards in 2001 and the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries or Television Movie at the 7th Screen Actors Guild Awards in 2001 and was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie at the 52nd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2000. Dustin Hoffman and Brian Dennehy won Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Play at the 1984 and 1999 Drama Desk Awards. Hoffman also won both the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Miniseries or Television Film at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards in 1986 and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie at the 38th Primetime Emmy Awards in 1986. Lee J. Cobb was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Single Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role in a Drama at the 19th Primetime Emmy Awards as well as a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word, Documentary or Drama Recording at the 9th Grammy Awards in 1967. Warren Mitchell earned the Laurence Olivier Award for Actor of the Year in a Revival in 1979 for his West End theatre performance of the role.Mitchell, Warren (1926-) at BFI ScreenOnline Dennehy earned a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in 2006 for his reprisal of the role in the West End. =Commentary= Time described Scott's performance as \\"...a performance of staggering impact....When his head is bowed, it is not in resignation but rather like that of a bull bloodied by the picador yet ready to charge again.\\" Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance came at a time when the Occupy Wall Street movement echoed the play while its actors could not afford the $120 ticket price. The March version of Loman presented him as more mentally unstable than other versions. Influences Miller noted that although he wrote the play in 1947 and 1948, the play grew out of his life experiences, that included his father losing everything in the 1929 stock market crash. Miller claims that the role was actually modeled on one of his uncles. Dustin Hoffman says that the play was the first one he ever read and predated his interest in becoming an actor. He noted that the play resonated with him because his father was a travelling salesman and he had an older brother. Hoffman eventually played the role in a high-school production. In 1965, Hoffman served as the assistant director in an off-Broadway revival of A View from the Bridge at the Sheridan Square Playhouse with a cast that included Robert Duvall and Jon Voight. The show's director Ulu Grosbard suggested to Miller that Hoffman had the potential to make a great Willy Loman. Miller was unimpressed and later wrote that \\"My estimate of Grosbard all but collapsed as, observing Dustin Hoffman's awkwardness and his big nose that never seemed to get unstuffy, I wondered how the poor fellow imagined himself a candidate for any kind of acting career.\\" Notes External links * Bradford, Wade Character Analysis: Willy Loman from \\"Death of a Salesman\\" at plays.about.com Characters in plays Literary characters introduced in 1949 Fictional suicides Fictional attempted suicides Fictional salespeople Fictional characters from New York City ","title":"Willy Loman"},{"id":"1195815","text":"Homo antecessor is an archaic human species of the Lower Paleolithic, known to have been present in Western Europe (Spain, England and France) between about 1.2 million and 0.8 million years ago (Mya). It was described in 1997 by Eudald Carbonell, Juan Luis Arsuaga and José María Bermúdez de Castro, who based on its \\"unique mix of modern and primitive traits\\" classified it as a previously unknown archaic human species. The fossils associated with Homo antecessor represent the oldest direct fossil record of the presence of Homo in Europe. The species name antecessor proposed in 1997 is a Latin word meaning \\"predecessor\\", or \\"vanguard, scout, pioneer\\". Authors who do not accept H. antecessor as a separate species consider the fossils in question an early form of H. heidelbergensis or as a European variety of H. erectus. Taxonomy =Research history= Reconstruction of the \\"Boy of Gran Dolina\\" cranium from a reproduction of the fragments found (Museu d'Arqueologia de Catalunya, Barcelona) H. antecessor was discovered in 1991 in the Gran Dolina site of the Sierra de Atapuerca region of northern Spain by Spanish palaeoanthropologists José María Bermúdez de Castro, Eudald Carbonell, and Juan Luis Arsuaga. These remains were deposited in the sixth level (TD6) dating to about 780,000 years ago, making them the oldest European human fossils. Stone tools indicate hominin activity in Europe as early as 1.6 mya in Eastern Europe and Spain. The sediment of Gran Dolina was dated at 900,000 years old in 2014. More than 80 bone fragments from six individuals were uncovered in 1994 and 1995. The site also had included approximately 200 stone tools and 300 animal bones. Stone tools including a stone carved knife were found along with the ancient hominin remains. All these remains were dated at least 900,000 years old. The best preserved specimens are ATD6-15 and ATD6-69, a frontal bone and a maxilla (upper jawbone) of a 10 year old boy, dubbed the \\"Gran Dolina Boy\\" (el chico de la Gran Dolina), dating to 859–782,000 years ago. In 2007, a molar dating to 1.2–1.1 million years ago was recovered from the nearby Sima del Elefante site. It belonged to a 20–25 year old individual. In 2008, an additional mandible fragment, stone flakes, and evidence of butchery were discovered. Until 2013 with the discovery of the 1.4 Ma infant tooth from Barranco León, Orce, Spain, these were the oldest human fossils known from Europe. Evidence of early human presence in England and France has later been tentatively associated with H. antecessor purely on chronological grounds and not based on anatomical evidence. Fifty footprints dating to between 1.2 million and 800,000 years ago were discovered in Happisburgh, England. They were possibly made by an H. antecessor group. =Classification= Forensic reconstruction by Élisabeth Daynès (2014), Museo de la Evolución Humana, Burgos. H. antecessor has been proposed as a chronospecies intermediate between H. erectus (c. 1.9–1.4 Mya) and H. heidelbergensis (c. 0.8–0.3 Mya). While H. heidelbergensis is widely accepted as the immediate predecessor of H. neanderthalensis, and possibly H. sapiens, the derivation of H. heidelbergensis from H. antecessor is debatable. H. antecessor's discoverers suggested H. antecessor as a derivation of African H. erectus (H. ergaster) which would have migrated to the Iberian Peninsula at some point before 1.2 Mya, and developed into H. heidelbergensis by 0.8 Mya, and further into H. neanderthalensis after 0.3 Mya.\\"... a speciation event could have occurred in Africa/Western Eurasia, originating a new Homo clade [...] Homo antecessor [...] could be a side branch of this clade placed at the westernmost region of the Eurasian continent\\". In 2009, palaeoanthropologist Richard Klein stated he was skeptical that H. antecessor was ancestral to H. heidelbergensis, interpreting H. antecessor as a \\"failed attempt to colonize southern Europe\\".Klein, Richard. 2009. \\"Hominin Disperals in the Old World\\" in The Human Past, ed. Chris Scarre, 2nd ed., p. 108. The legitimacy of H. antecessor as a separate species has also been questioned because the fossil record is fragmentary, and especially as no complete skull has been found, with only fourteen fragments and lower jaw bones known. Because of this, it is also proposed that H. antecessor was an early form of H. heidelbergensis, which would extend the range of H. heidelbergensis to 1.2–0.3 Mya. A 2020 analysis by Welker et al. of ancient proteins collected from a tooth of an H. antecessor specimen indicated that H. antecessor belonged to a \\"sister lineage\\" related to the ancestor of modern humans, Neanderthals, and Denisovans, but was not itself their direct ancestor, corroborating earlier opinions that H. heidelbergensis was not derived from H. antecessor. Physiology Model of a male Homo antecessor of Atapuerca mountains (Ibeas Museum, Burgos, Spain) Based on the radial and clavicle lengths, the statures of 2 specimens were calculated to be and . The body proportions of H. antecessor fall within the range of variation for modern humans, and upper limb proportions were likely more similar to those of modern humans than Neanderthals. The facial anatomy of the Boy of Gran Dolina appears very similar to that of modern humans, and it was thus suggested that this marked the beginning of modern human facial features. These features likely did not change so drastically with age. However, modern humanlike facial features may have evolved multiple times independently among different human lineages. Based on teeth eruption pattern, the researchers think that H. antecessor had the same development stages as H. sapiens, though probably at a faster pace. Other significant features demonstrated by the species are a protruding occipital bun, a low forehead, and a lack of a strong chin. Some of the remains are almost indistinguishable from the fossil attributable to the 1.5-million-year-old Turkana Boy, belonging to H. ergaster. Behaviour Atapuerca practicing cannibalism (Ibeas Museum, Burgos, Spain) The large animal carcasses at Gran Dolina appear to have been carried to the site intact. This indicates that H. antecessor groups dispatched multi-member hunting parties who delayed eating immediately after a successful kill in order to share it with all group members after hauling it back, showing social cooperation, division of labour, and food sharing. A total of 16 species were recorded from Gran Dolina, including the bush-antlered deer, an extinct species of fallow deer, an extinct red deer, an extinct bison, a wild boar, the rhino Stephanorhinus etruscus, the Stenon zebra, a mammoth, the Mosbach wolf, the fox Vulpes praeglacialis, the Gran Dolina bear, the spotted hyena, and a lynx. The most common butchered remains are those of deer. Also, adult and child H. antecessor specimens from Gran Dolina exhibit cut marks, crushing, burning, and other trauma indicative of cannibalism, and are the second-most common remains bearing evidence of butchering. It is unclear if cannibalism was practiced often (ritual cannibalism) or if this was an isolated incident in a dire situation (survival cannibalism).

It is the opposite of a landslide victory; the two frequently going hand in hand. Note that the use of the phrase generally assumes that the returns were the product of a legitimate election; show elections to fraudulent legislatures regularly produce incredibly strong majorities for the ruling party(s).  Australia  Between 1901 and 1949, the upper house of the Australian Senate was elected by a system of majoritarian or \\"winner-take-all\\" voting. Each state had 3 of its 6 Senators retiring at each half-senate election. Each voter had 3 votes at each election, whether by first-past-the-post (FPTP) 1901-1918, or the alternative vote. It was often the case that the 3 seats all went the same way, leading to lopsided results in the six states such as 36-0 or 3-33. These results brought the parliament into some disrepute. In 1948, the Single Transferable Vote (STV) was introduced. At the same time, the number of senators per state was increased from 6 to 10, with 5 instead of 3 retiring at each triennial election. The increased number of vacancies per election would have exacerbated the \\"landslide/wipeout\\" effect if the old winner-take-all system had been retained. Instead, having more seats increased the degree of proportionality between votes received and seats won by parties. Since the introduction of STV in the Senate, the parties have generally been evenly balanced, with minor parties and independents holding the balance of power. In the 2004 election, the government did the nearly impossible and gained the 57% of the vote in one state to obtain a majority in its own right in the senate from July 2005, when the new senators take up their seats. The number of quotas required to win a majority (four) of six seats, at 57% (four-sevenths of the votes), is so high because there are an even number of seats. In the lower house, FPTP was changed to preferential voting in 1918. In the 1974 Queensland state election, using single-member electorates and full- preferential voting, the Labor opposition was reduced to a \\"cricket team\\" of eleven MPs, against the National Country Party/ Liberal Party Coalition government with 69 seats (and 2 Independents).  Canada  * In the 1993 Canadian federal election, the governing Progressive Conservative Party was reduced from a strong majority government to only two seats. * In the 2011 Canadian federal election, the Bloc Québécois was reduced to 4 seats. * In the 2015 Canadian federal election, the Liberals won all seats in the Atlantic Provinces. *In the 2001 British Columbia general election the governing NDP was reduced to two seats, with the other 77 being won by the Liberals. * 1995 New Brunswick general election 51.6% - 30.9% 48 - 7 (wipe out) * 1991 New Brunswick general election 47.1% - 21.2% 46 - 8-3-1 (lop-sided) * 1987 New Brunswick general election 60.4% - 28.6% 55 - 0 (clean sweep) * 1987 Ontario general election 47.3% 25.7% - 95 - 19 - 16 (lopsided) * 2003 Prince Edward Island general election 54.0% 42.9% - 23 -4 (wipe out) * 2000 Prince Edward Island general election 57.9% 33.7% - 26 -1 (wipe out) * 1996 Prince Edward Island general election 47.8% 44.8% - 18 -8 - 1 (strong government; strong opposition) * 1935 Prince Edward Island general election 51.7% 48.3% - 30 -0 (wipe out) * 1991 Saskatchewan general election 51.1% - 25.5% 55 - 10 - 1 (lopsided) * 1982 Saskatchewan general election 54.1% - 37.6% 55 - 9 (wipe out) * 1944 Saskatchewan general election 53.1% - 35.4% 47 - 5 (wipe out) * 1934 Saskatchewan general election 48.0% - 24.0% 50 - 5 (wipe out) Germany The use of an electoral threshold in German elections means that sometimes a major party can fail to win seats in the Bundestag or a state parliament, either because their vote share falls below 5% or because the number of directly-elected seats drops below 3. Post-war examples include: * 1957 West German federal election: The All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights lost all 27 seats. * 2002 German federal election: The Party of Democratic Socialism went from 36 seats to just 2 (both directly-elected). * 2013 German federal election: The Free Democratic Party lost all 93 seats. New Zealand Until it moved to a proportional representation system in 1996, general elections in New Zealand were also prone to the possibility of wipeouts, though these in general involved the likelihood of third parties getting few or no seats rather than one of the two major parties being massively underrepresented. This former circumstance occurred most starkly in the 1981 general election, in which the Social Credit Party gained 20.6% of the vote yet gained only two seats in the 92-seat parliament. The 1935 general election did, however, see a major party wipeout, and led to the creation of a new major party. In the 1935 election, the Labour Party gained 46.1% of the vote to the United/Reform Coalition's 32.9%, but won 53 seats to the United/Reform's 19. As a result of this election the two coalition parties merged to form the National Party, which remains a major force in current New Zealand politics. United Kingdom *In the 1997 United Kingdom general election, the Conservative Party were wiped out in Scotland and Wales - losing eleven and six seats respectively. The Conservatives failed to pick up a seat in Wales in the 2001 election either. The Conservatives picked up a seat in Scotland in 2001, but they didn't gain any additional MPs until 2017, while their share of the vote remained below 20%. *In the United Kingdom general election, 2005, the Ulster Unionist Party, which had been Northern Ireland's largest party, lost 5 of its 6 seats. Its last seat was lost at the 2010 election, leaving it without representation for the first time since the party was created in 1912. *In the 2015 United Kingdom general election, the Liberal Democrats lost 49 of their 57 seats, and despite taking 8% of the national vote only had 1.2% of the MPs. Both Labour and the Lib Dems were nearly wiped out in Scotland, retaining just one seat each. =Scottish Elections= The Scottish Parliament elections uses a version of the Additional member system, meaning that 73 seats are won through First Past the Post constituency votes, and additional seats are added for the regional vote which uses a variation of the D'Hondt method. *In the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, the Socialists lost all of their six seats, with their share of the vote reduced by over 6%. *In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Labour lost twenty constituency seats (seven overall), with the Liberal Democrats losing nine (twelve overall). The Lib Dems were left with only two constituency seats, suffering a complete wipeout on the Scottish mainland, leaving only Shetland and Orkney (two of the safest seats in the country) with Lib Dem MSPs.  Elsewhere  * 1955 Philippine Senate election: With the 24-seat Senate of the Philippines elected via nationwide plurality-at-large voting (8 votes per voter) and on staggered elections, the Liberal Party's seven seats were lost when none of their candidates finished eighth place or higher, despite having 29% of the vote. After the election, the Nacionalista Party then had 21 seats, and two minor parties having 3 seats with one seat vacant. * In the 1982 Spanish general election, ruling Union of the Democratic Centre went down from 168 to 11 seats, out of 350, and were ousted from government. * 1993 French legislative election: Ruling Socialist Party went down from 260 to 53 seats out of 577. Socialists were ousted from government and outgoing Prime Minister Pierre Bérégovoy committed suicide after the loss. * In the 2000 Mongolian State Great Khural Election, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party overturned a large majority for the Democratic Union, winning 72 out of the 76 seats contested. * 2002 French legislative election: Centre party Union for French Democracy went down from 112 to 29 seats out of 577, with a further decrease to just 3 seats in 2007. *In the Irish General Election of 2011, the ruling Fianna Fáil party suffered the worst defeat in its history, returning only 20 T.D.'s to the Dáil. The party moved from being the largest party in the Republic of Ireland, to third for the first time ever. Since the formation of the first Fianna Fáil government in 1932, until the 2011 Election, Fianna Fáil had been in power for 61 of those 79 years and had always been the largest party in the state (regardless of whether it was in power or not). Many factors caused the electoral meltdown, but chief among them was the collapse of the Irish economy. * 2017 French legislative election: Ruling Socialist Party went down from 286 to 45 seats out of 577. Socialists were ousted from government. * In the 2019 Spanish general election, the People's Party went from 127 of the 208 directly elected senators to just 54, falling from a comfortable overall majority of 61% of seats to holding just over 27% of the total, despite the fact that the Spanish electoral system for the Senate all but guarantees at least one seat for the runner-up party in 47 of the 50 provinces. Meanwhile, in the Congress of Deputies, the PP lost all their seats in the Basque Country (down from 2) and were reduced to a single one in Catalonia (down from 5).

Biography Louis-Antoine de Noailles was born at the Château of Teyssiére in Auvergne, France, on 27 May 1651 to Anne, 1st duc de Noailles and captain- general of Roussillon, and his wife, Louise Boyer, a former lady-in-waiting to Queen Anne of Austria.Dégert, Antoine. \\"Louis-Antoine de Noailles.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 3 June 2017 Noailles received his doctorate in theology from the Sorbonne on 14 March 1676. He was appointed bishop of Cahors in March 1679 but served only briefly before Pope Innocent XI ordered him transferred in 1680 to head the diocese of Châlons-sur-Marne, which made him a peer of France. On 19 August 1695, in recognition of Noailles's family connections, King Louis XIV made him archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud, and in 1700 Pope Innocent XII made him a cardinal. According to Antoine Degert, writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, although Noailles was not brilliant, \\"he was possessed of piety, zeal, and activity.\\" He is noted for having raised money to feed famine victims by selling his silver tableware in 1709, and for having spent a considerable part of his inheritance on redecorating Notre Dame. Noailles was a friend of François Fénelon, with whom he had studied at the Collège du Plessis before entering the Sorbonne. Nonetheless, he was among the bishops who condemned Fénelon's Maximes des Saints, ending the theologian's career. Noailles came to know the controversial young Lutheran Count Nicholas Ludwig von Zinzendorf in 1719 during the young man's Grand Tour. The two found great spiritual connection despite their historic denominational differences. They maintained a relationship and correspondence the rest of Noailles' life; and Noailles became a member of Zinzendorf's Order of the Grain of Mustard Seed, a secret society where nobles and church leaders committed to work together to build the spiritual Kingdom of God. The Cardinal also served as Godfather to Zinzendorf's son Christian Renatus (1727–1756). Noailles acted as a staunch moralist when at the end of March 1719 he firmly stood behind the curé of Saint-Sulpice. who refused to administer the sacraments to the Regent's daughter, Louise Élisabeth, Duchess of Berry, who was in a critical condition giving birth to an illegitimate child in the Palais de Luxembourg. Despite all the pleas of the Regent, Philip II, Duke of Orleans, Noailles refused categorically to overturn the decision of the parish priest.http://rouvroy.medusis.com/docs/1709.html This scandalous confinement wasn't Berry's first incartade. A widow since 1714, the Regent's daughter accumulated lovers and her repeated pregnancies which scandalized the Court were widely gossiped about, oftentimes being attributed to her alleged incestuous affair with the Regent Noailles had a complex relationship with the Jansenists; while he condemned their propositions, more orthodox theologians saw in his own teachings hints of Jansenism, and Noailles was an opponent of the Jesuits in their attacks on the sect. His position on Pope Clement XI's 1713 bull Unigenitus was also controversial; he opposed it, despite papal disapproval, up to 1728 but then abruptly reversed himself shortly before his death. He was succeeded as archbishop of Paris and Duke of Saint-Cloud by Charles-Gaspard-Guillaume de Vintimille du Luc.

His TV appearances cover bushcraft and survival techniques. He is best known for the TV series Ray Mears' Bushcraft, Ray Mears' World of Survival, Extreme Survival, Survival with Ray Mears, Wild Britain with Ray Mears and Ray Mears Goes Walkabout. Life and work =Early life= Mears grew up on the North Downs, in Southern England. He attended Downside Preparatory School in Purley and then Reigate Grammar School, where he was a member of the naval cadre of the Combined Cadet Force. Mears' ambition was to join the Royal Marines, but he could not meet the eyesight requirements for entry. After taking A-levels, Mears briefly worked in an office in the City of London. =Career= In 1983, Mears founded Woodlore, a company that offers bushcraft-related courses and paraphernalia. It became so successful that it soon led to the trademarking of the name \\"Ray Mears\\". Mears first appeared on television in 1994 presenting the BBC series Tracks and then, in 1997, Ray Mears' World of Survival. In 2003, he presented the BBC documentary Ray Mears' Real Heroes of Telemark about the Norwegian heavy water sabotage mission during World War II. While filming a documentary in Wyoming, US in 2005, Mears was involved in a serious accident. The helicopter in which he and his camera crew were travelling hit the ground during a steep low level turn, and broke apart, rolling to a stop. The fuel tank was ruptured in the accident and escaping fuel covered Mears and the crew. No fire occurred, and Mears was able to escape the wreckage uninjured and assist in the rescue and administer first aid to one of the crew who was badly hurt. On 29 May 2008, Mears appeared on The Graham Norton Show where he attempted unsuccessfully to light a fire using a bow drill. Unbeknownst to Mears, the entire set had been sprayed with fire-retardant. In 2009, Mears was approached by ITV to present a planned revival of the nature documentary series Survival. The resulting three-part series was rebranded Survival with Ray Mears and broadcast on ITV1 in 2010. Each episode followed Mears as he used his tracking skills to locate bears, wolves and leopards. In a Radio Times interview to promote the series, Mears complained of being typecast by the BBC with the result that he was not offered the opportunity to present wildlife programmes. He then presented Wild Britain with Ray Mears, which was also broadcast by ITV. Mears was a guest on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs in January 2014. His choices were \\"Jumpin' Jack Flash\\" by the Rolling Stones, \\"English Rose\\" by the Jam, \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" by the Beatles, \\"Annie's Song\\" by John Denver, \\"Maria\\" by Blondie, \\"Suddenly I See\\" by KT Tunstall, \\"Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters\\" by Elton John and \\"Feeling Good\\" by Nina Simone. In July 2010, Mears was asked by Northumbria Police to help them track fugitive killer Raoul Moat, after he fled his temporary tent-based shelter in the village of Rothbury. =Personal life= Mears met his first wife, Rachel, in 1992 when she attended one of his five-day survival courses. The couple lived in Eastbourne, East Sussex with her two adult children and married in 2005, after Rachel was diagnosed with breast cancer. Rachel died in 2006, aged 50, and her ashes are scattered in Ashdown Forest near their home. Mears currently lives in Sussex with his second wife Ruth and his stepson.

It contains 15 songs, of which only four appeared on their previous albums, and two of which were later re-recorded and included on Lisa Gerrard's first solo album, The Mirror Pool. The others previously existed only in live performances and unofficial bootlegs, but were not officially released until Toward the Within. Along with Perry and Gerrard were a number of musicians who had performed with them on other occasions.  Overview  Toward the Within was recorded in one take in November 1993 at the Mayfair Theatre in Santa Monica, California and was released by 4AD as an album and a video (VHS and LaserDisc) a year later. It was the last major event to take place in the Mayfair Theatre before it was severely damaged in the Northridge earthquake in January 1994 and had to be closed indefinitely. The video was filmed by producer Mark Magidson, known for his work on the 1992 film Baraka. It contains interviews with Gerrard and Perry, as well as a music video for \\"Yulunga (Spirit Dance)\\", composed of clips from Baraka. While the CD functions as the soundtrack to the video, neither contain the entire show. The CD lacks \\"Gloridean\\" as well as the song played over the ending credits of the video, while the video lacks \\"Persian Love Song\\" and concert footage of \\"Yulunga (Spirit Dance)\\". In 2001, Toward the Within was re-released on DVD and included in the box set Dead Can Dance (1981-1998). In addition to the original content, the DVD release contained a few extras: a discography; music videos for \\"Frontier\\", \\"The Protagonist\\" and \\"The Carnival Is Over\\"; and a chapter from Baraka titled \\"Calcutta Foragers/Homeless\\", which is set to Dead Can Dance's \\"The Host of Seraphim\\".

It is used in the treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia. While it is found in the opium poppy, papaverine differs in both structure and pharmacological action from the analgesic morphine-like compounds.  History  Capsule of Papaver somniferum showing latex (opium) exuding from incision. Papaverine occurs naturally in opium. Papaverine was discovered in 1848 by Georg Merck (1825–1873). Merck was a student of the German chemists Justus von Liebig and August Hofmann, and he was the son of Emanuel Merck (1794–1855), founder of the Merck corporation, a major German chemical and pharmaceutical company.William H. Brock, Justus von Liebig: The Chemical Gatekeeper (Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press, 1997). page 120.  Uses  Papaverine is approved to treat spasms of the gastrointestinal tract, bile ducts and ureter and for use as a cerebral and coronary vasodilator in subarachnoid hemorrhage (combined with balloon angioplasty) and coronary artery bypass surgery. Papaverine may also be used as a smooth muscle relaxant in microsurgery where it is applied directly to blood vessels. Papaverine is used as an erectile dysfunction drug, alone or sometimes in combination. Papaverine, when injected in penile tissue, causes direct smooth muscle relaxation and consequent filling of the corpus cavernosum with blood resulting in erection. A topical gel is also available for ED treatment. It is also commonly used in cryopreservation of blood vessels along with the other glycosaminoglycans and protein suspensions. Functions as a vasodilator during cryopreservation when used in conjunction with verapamil, phentolamine, nifedipine, tolazoline or nitroprusside. Papaverine is also being investigated as a topical growth factor in tissue expansion with some success. Papaverine is used as an off label prophylaxis (preventative) of migraine headaches. It is not a first line drug such as a few beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, and some anticonvulsants such as divalproex, but rather when these first line drugs and secondary drugs such as SSRIs, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, etc. fail in the prophylaxis of migraines, have intolerable side effects or are contraindicated. Papaverine is also present in combinations of opium alkaloid salts such as papaveretum (Omnopon, Pantopon) and others, along with morphine, codeine, and in some cases noscapine and others in a percentage similar to that in opium, or modified for a given application. Papaverine is found as a contaminant in some heroin and can be used by forensic laboratories in heroin profiling to identify its source. The metabolites can also be found in the urine of heroin users, allowing street heroin to be distinguished from pharmaceutical diacetylmorphine. Mechanism The in vivo mechanism of action is not entirely clear, but an inhibition of the enzyme phosphodiesterase causing elevation of cyclic AMP and cyclic GMP levels is significant. It may also alter mitochondrial respiration. Papaverine has also been demonstrated to be a selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor for the PDE10A subtype found mainly in the striatum of the brain. When administered chronically to mice, it produced motor and cognitive deficits and increased anxiety, but conversely may produce an antipsychotic effect, although not all studies support this view.  Side effects  Frequent side effects of papaverine treatment include polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, constipation, interference with sulphobromophthalein retention test (used to determine hepatic function), increased transaminase levels, increased alkaline phosphatase levels, somnolence, and vertigo. Rare side effects include flushing of the face, hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating), cutaneous eruption, arterial hypotension, tachycardia, loss of appetite, jaundice, eosinophilia, thrombopenia, mixed hepatitis, headache, allergic reaction, chronic active hepatitis, and paradoxical aggravation of cerebral vasospasm. Papaverine in the plant Sauropus androgynus is linked to bronchiolitis obliterans.  Formulations and trade names Papaverine is available as a conjugate of hydrochloride, codecarboxylate, adenylate, and teprosylate. It was also once available as a salt of hydrobromide, camsylate, cromesilate, nicotinate, and amygdalic acidphenylglycolate. The hydrochloride salt is available for intramuscular, intravenous, rectal and oral administration. The teprosylate is available in intravenous, intramuscular, and orally administered formulations. The codecarboxylate is available in oral form, only, as is the adenylate. The codecarboxylate is sold under the name Albatran, the adenylate as Dicertan, and the hydrochloride salt is sold variously as Artegodan (Germany), Cardioverina (countries outside Europe and the United States), Dispamil (countries outside Europe and the United States), Opdensit (Germany), Panergon (Germany), Paverina Houde (Italy, Belgium), Pavacap (United States), Pavadyl (United States), Papaverine (Israel), Papaverin-Hamelin (Germany), Paveron (Germany), Spasmo-Nit (Germany), Cardiospan, Papaversan, Cepaverin, Cerespan, Drapavel, Forpaven, Papalease, Pavatest, Paverolan, Therapav (Canada CSST - Service du répertoire toxicologique.

The Space Pen (also known as the Zero Gravity Pen), marketed by Fisher Space Pen Company, is a pen that uses pressurized ink cartridges and is able to write in zero gravity, underwater, over wet and greasy paper, at any angle, and in a very wide range of temperatures. Inventors The Fisher Space Pen was created by Austrian Friedrich Schächter and expanded by Erwin Rath. Paul C. Fisher invented the \\"thixotrop special ink\\". The pens were manufactured in Boulder City, Nevada. Paul C. Fisher first patented the AG7 \\"anti gravity\\" pen in 1965. Models There are two prominent styles of the pen: the AG7 \\"Astronaut pen\\", a long thin retractable pen shaped like a common ballpoint, and the \\"Bullet pen\\" which is non-retractable, shorter than standard ballpoints when capped, but full size when the cap is posted on the rear for writing. Several of the Fisher Space Pen models (the \\"Millennium\\" is one) are claimed to write for a lifetime of \\"average\\" use; however the product literature states that the pen will write exactly 30.7 miles (approximately 49.4 kilometers). Standard Space Pen refills can be used in any pen able to take a standard Parker Pen Company ballpoint refill, using the small plastic adapter that is supplied with each refill. Fisher also makes a Space Pen-type refill that fits Cross pens, one that fits 1950s-style Papermate pens (or any pen that uses that type of refill), and a \\"universal\\" refill that fits some other ballpoint pens. Technology The ballpoint is made from tungsten carbide and is precisely fitted in order to avoid leaks. A sliding float separates the ink from the pressurized gas. The thixotropic ink in the hermetically sealed and pressurized reservoir is able to write for three times longer than a standard ballpoint pen. The pen can write at altitudes up to 12,500 feet (3800 m). The ink is forced out by compressed nitrogen at a pressure of nearly 35 psi (240 kPa). Operating temperatures range from −30 to 250 °F (−35 to 120 °C). The pen has an estimated shelf life of 100 years. One of the first patents on space pen is US3285228, which was filed on 19 May 1965.Sakpal, Nilesh J Space pen  Zero gravity pen  Astronaut's pen AG7 - Fisher Space Pen Co. Uses in the U.S. and Russian space programs An urban legend states that NASA spent a large amount of money to develop a pen that would write in space (the result purportedly being the Fisher Space Pen), while the Soviets just used pencils. In reality, NASA began to develop a space pen, but when development costs skyrocketed the project was abandoned and astronauts went back to using pencils, along with the Soviets. However, the claim that NASA spent millions on the Space Pen is incorrect, as the Fisher pen was developed using private capital, not government funding. NASA – and the Soviets – eventually began purchasing such pens. NASA programs previously used pencils (for example a 1965 order of mechanical pencils) but because of the substantial dangers that broken pencil tips and graphite dust pose to electronics in zero gravity, the flammable nature of wood present in pencils, and the inadequate quality documentation produced by non-permanent or smeared recordkeeping, a better solution was needed. Russian cosmonauts used pencils, and grease pencils on plastic slates until also adopting a space pen in 1969 with a purchase of 100 units for use on all future missions. NASA never approached Paul Fisher to develop a pen, nor did Fisher receive any government funding for the pen's development. Fisher invented it independently and then, in 1965, asked NASA to try it. After extensive testing, NASA decided to use the pens in future Apollo missions. Subsequently, in 1967 it was reported that NASA purchased approximately 400 pens for $6 a piece. In 2008, Gene Cernan's Apollo 17-flown space pen sold in a Heritage auction for US$23,900.

Nf3 Nf6 Though this response has a long history, it was first popularised by Alexander Petrov, a Russian chess player of the mid-19th century. In recognition of the early investigations by the Russian masters Petrov and Carl Jaenisch, this opening is called the Russian Game in some countries. The Petrov has a drawish reputation; however, it offers attacking opportunities for both sides, and a few lines are quite . Often a trade occurs and Black, after gaining a tempo, has a well-placed knight. Pillsbury's game in 1895Lasker vs. Pillsbury, 1895, 0–1 Chessgames.com against Emanuel Lasker testifies to this. The Black counterattack in the centre also avoids the Ruy Lopez, Giuoco Piano (and other lines of the Italian Game), and the Scotch Game. The Petrov has been adopted by many of the world's leading players, including world champions Vassily Smyslov, Anatoly Karpov, and Vladimir Kramnik. The Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings codes for Petrov's Defence are C43 (for 3.d4) and C42 (for all other lines).* White's third move White's two main choices for move three are 3.Nxe5, the Classical Variation and 3.d4, the Steinitz Variation. 3.Nxe5 is more popular but they often lead to similar positions and \\"there is no clear reason to prefer one move over the other\\".Janjgava, p. 107 3.Nc3 may transpose to the Four Knights Game or the Three Knights Game. 3.Bc4 may lead to the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit or transpose to the Two Knights Defence. Occasionally seen is the 3.d3. =Classical Variation: 3.Nxe5 = After 3.Nxe5, the Classical Variation, Black should not continue to copy White's moves and try to restore the balance immediately with 3...Nxe4. After 4.Qe2 Black cannot play 4...Nf6 because 5.Nc6+ wins the queen, and after 4...d5?! 5.d3 Qe7 6.dxe4 Qxe5 7.exd5 Black loses a pawn. Relatively best for Black is 4...Qe7 5.Qxe4 d6 6.d4 dxe5 7.dxe5 Nc6, and after for example 8.Nc3 (8.Bb5 is also good) 8...Qxe5 9.Qxe5 Nxe5 10.Nb5 (or 10.Bf4) White has a clear advantage.Janjgava, pp. 108–09Yusupov, pp. 12, 22–24 If Black plays 3...Qe7?! then 4.d4 d6 5.Nf3 Qxe4+ 6.Be2 is better for White. Consequently, by far the most popular move for Black is 3...d6. Most often, White follows the main line 4.Nf3 Nxe4 5.d4 (5.Bd3 is also playable, known as the Millennium Attack) d5 6.Bd3, where he will try to drive Black's advanced knight from e4 with moves like c4 and Re1. If White achieves this, then he is up two tempi (Nf6–e4–f6, plus the tempo White starts the game with). In practice White is usually able to achieve this, but at some structural cost such as having to play c4, which balances out. White can also force simplification with Lasker's 5.Qe2 Qe7 6.d3. This is generally only good enough for a draw, which Black should be satisfied with. Another possibility, explored by Keres, is 5.c4, known as the Kauffmann Attack. A completely different approach is to meet 4...Nxe4 with 5.Nc3 Nxc3 6.dxc3 with rapid and castling. For instance, White can plan a quick Be3, Qd2, and 0-0-0, and play for a attack, trusting that his doubled c-pawns will help protect his king, and that his initiative and attacking potential will offset the longterm disadvantage of having doubled pawns. In the 5.Nc3 line, Black must avoid 5...Bf5?? 6.Qe2! which wins a piece due to the pin (if 6...Qe7 7.Nd5, forcing 7...Qd7 because of the threat to the c7-pawn; then 8.d3 wins the piece). Viswanathan Anand resigned after only six moves after falling for this against Alonso Zapata at Biel in 1988. The Cochrane Gambit, 4.Nxf7, is labelled \\"speculative but entertaining\\" by Nick de Firmian in Modern Chess Openings–14. He evaluates the position in Veselin Topalov–Vladimir Kramnik, Linares 1999 as offering chances for both sides after 4...Kxf7 5.Nc3 c5!? 6.Bc4+ Be6 7.Bxe6+ Kxe6 8.d4 Kf7 9.dxc5 Nc6. The Paulsen Variation, 4.Nc4, is labelled \\"ineffective\\" by de Firmian in MCO, but is occasionally seen at grandmaster level. US master Andrew Karklins has experimented with 4.Nd3!? The Stafford Gambit is 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nf6 3.Nxe5 Nc6. =Steinitz Variation: 3.d4 = 3.d4 was favoured by Wilhelm Steinitz, and is sometimes called the Steinitz Variation although it was known earlier. Black can capture either pawn; also possible is 3...d6, transposing into the Philidor Defence. After 3...exd4 4.e5 (4.Bc4 transposes into the Urusov Gambit) 4...Ne4 (4...Qe7?! 5.Be2 is better for White) 5.Qxd4 d5 6.exd6 Nxd6 7.Nc3 Nc6 8.Qf4 the game is approximately . After the other capture, 3...Nxe4, 4.Bd3 d5 (4...Nc6!? 5.Bxe4 d5, intending 6.Bd3 e4, is also possible) 5.Nxe5, when either 5...Nd7 or 5...Bd6 gives roughly equal chances. A long and complicated tactical sequence which has frequently been seen in master games is 3...Nxe4 4.Bd3 d5 5.Nxe5 Bd6 6.0-0 0-0 7.c4 Bxe5 8.dxe5 Nc6 9.cxd5 Qxd5 10.Qc2 Nb4 11.Bxe4 Nxc2 12.Bxd5 Bf5 13.g4 Bxg4 14.Be4 Nxa1 15.Bf4 f5 16.Bd5+ Kh8 17.Rc1 c6 18.Bg2 Rfd8 19.Nd2 (diagram) and White has the slightly better endgame after either 19...Rxd2 20.Bxd2 Rd8 21.Bc3 Rd1+ 22.Rxd1 Bxd1 or 19...h6 20.h4.Position Search after 19.Nd2 at chessgames.comNick de Firmian, Batsford's Modern Chess Openings, p. 136, 15th edition, Pavilion 2009, =Three Knights Game: 3.Nc3 = 3.Nc3 is the Three Knights Game of Petrov's Defence. It can also be reached via 2.Nc3 Nf6 3.Nf3 (the Vienna Game). Commonly, after 3...Nc6, the opening transposes to the Four Knights Game. With the reply 3...Bb4 (or some others), it remains the Three Knights Game proper. =Italian Variation: 3.Bc4 = 3.Bc4 is the Italian Variation of Petrov's Defence. With 3...Nc6, it transposes to the Two Knights Defence. Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit Another possibility is 3.Bc4 Nxe4 4.Nc3, the Boden–Kieseritzky Gambit. It is not considered wholly sound, since Black has several viable options. Black can accept the gambit with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 f6, although he must play carefully after 6.0-0 (for example 6...Bc5?? 7.Nxe5! is disastrous; 6...d6 and 6...Nc6 are good). Another more aggressive try is 6.Nh4, where White goes for a quick assault on Black's king, but Black can maintain a small advantage if he plays cautiously via 6...g6 7.f4 Qe7 8.f5 Qg7 9.Qg4 Kd8. Another possibility is returning the gambit pawn with 4...Nxc3 5.dxc3 c6 6.Nxe5 d5, which equalises. A third possibility is transposing to the Italian Four Knights Game with 4...Nc6, and if 5.Nxe4, 5...d5. If 5.Bxf7+?, then 5...Kxf7 6.Nxe4 d5 gives Black the and control of the . If 5.0-0, Black plays 5...Nxc3 6.dxc3 and now Black can play 6...Qe7!, after which Bobby Fischer wrote that \\"White has no compensation for the Pawn\\",Bobby Fischer, My 60 Memorable Games, Faber and Faber, 1972, pp. 280–81. . or 6...f6 transposing to the main line of the Boden–Kieseritzky. Black also has lines beginning 6...Be7 and 6...h6.

Named for President John Adams, she fought in the Quasi- War, the First and Second Barbary Wars, the War of 1812, the Mexican–American War and the American Civil War. At the end of her career, she participated in the Union blockade of South Carolina's ports. She then participated in a historic raid that Harriet Tubman, the former slave and Union operative, organized with Union colonel Montgomery. John Adams led three steam-powered gunboats up the Harbor River to Port Royal. The squadron relied on local black mariners to guide it past mines and fortifications. The squadron freed 750+ slaves and unsettled the Confederacy. Tubman was the first woman in U.S. history to plan and execute an armed expedition. This John Adams should not be confused with the frigate . Origin John Adams was built for the United States by the people of Charleston, South Carolina, under contract to Paul Pritchard and launched in the latter's shipyard some from Charleston 5 June 1799. Quasi-War Captain George Cross sailed John Adams on or about 1 October for Cayenne, French Guiana, to operate against French privateers based at that port. By the time she arrived off South America, the British had captured Surinam, which made the French base in Guiana unsafe for privateers. Captain Cross therefore decided to sail her on to Guadeloupe to join her squadron. Early in January 1800, she began operations against the French, taking an unidentified lugger off San Juan, Puerto Rico and recapturing brig Dolphin. She then retook the brigs Hannibal on 22 March and Atlantic the next day, both prizes of the French privateer President Tout. The French privateer schooner Jason surrendered to her 3 April, and in May she retook schooners Dispatch and William. Sometime in the late spring or summer she recaptured the American brig Olive, and on 13 June she took French schooner Decade. These victories punctuated and highlighted the day-to-day duty of patrolling the West Indies. She continued to protect American shipping through the late summer and fall. John Adams left on 5 December escorting a convoy to the United States. She was placed in ordinary in Charleston in mid-January 1801, and then in late June she sailed to Washington, D.C. where she was laid up. As the Quasi-War with France drew to a close, President Adams could report to Congress: > The present Navy of the United States, called suddenly into existence by a > great national emergency, has raised us in our own esteem; and by the > protection afforded to our commerce has effected to the extent of our > expectations the objects for which it was created. First Barbary War Peace with France freed the Navy for operations against Barbary corsairs who had been preying on American shipping in the Mediterranean. A small squadron under Commodore Richard Dale, sent out in 1801 for operations against Tripoli, was followed in 1802 by a much stronger force under Commodore Richard Valentine Morris. On 22 October John Adams, under the command of Captain John Rodgers, sailed from Hampton Roads to join Commodore Morris. After escorting vessels from Gibraltar to Málaga and Menorca, she finally caught up with Commodore Morris at Malta on 5 January 1803. She then operated with the squadron until 3 May when she received orders to cruise independently off Tripoli. Upon arriving off Tripoli, John Adams, still under the command of Rodgers, boldly attacked the forts and the gunboats anchored under their protection. Several days later she captured 28-gun Tripolitan cruiser Meshuda. After and joined her, John Adams engaged a flotilla of enemy gunboats off Tripoli on 22 May sending them scurrying back into the harbor to safety. Five days later—with the added support of , a sister frigate also named for President John Adams—the squadron again bested a group of pirate gunboats. One of the most important victories of the war came on 21 June when John Adams and Enterprise captured a 22-gun vessel belonging to Tripoli, thus weakening that state sufficiently to allow the squadron to turn its attention to Tunis, Algiers, and Morocco, which were threatening U.S. commerce in the Western Mediterranean. Throughout the summer and early fall John Adams operated in that quarter before returning home with New York. Meanwhile, Commodore Edward Preble, who had led a powerful fleet to the Mediterranean, vigorously pressed the fight. In August and September 1804 he made a series of major attacks on Tripoli. As the second of these blows was being delivered 7 August, John Adams, now under Captain Isaac Chauncey, arrived on the scene deeply laden with stores. Her boats participated in a reconnaissance patrol on the night of 18 August, and 6 days later she slipped in close to the city for an intensive 4-hour bombardment. Two nights later during a similar attack, an enemy shot sank one of John Adamss boats, killing three men and wounding a fourth, as the American Squadron severely punished Tripoli with over 700 well- directed rounds which took effect within the city. After a fifth attack had been successfully completed 3 September, bad weather interrupted operations and John Adams sailed to Syracuse with other ships of the squadron. Three months later she sailed for New York with Commodore Preble, arriving 26 February 1805. After a third Mediterranean cruise from May to November, she was laid up in ordinary. In service she had been considered a poor sailer; between 1807–09 her forecastle and quarterdeck were removed and she was re- rated as (depending on the source) either a corvette or a sloop-of-war. War of 1812 The outbreak of the War of 1812 found her undergoing repairs at Boston whence she was hurried to New York to have the work completed. There the British blockade and a critical shortage of seamen kept her in a laid-up status until early 1814. She finally sailed under a flag of truce carrying peace commissioners Henry Clay and Jonathan Russell to Europe and arrived Wargo Island, Norway, 14 April. She returned to the United States 5 September bringing dispatches from the American commissioners the Treaty of Ghent that would end the war towards the end of the year. Second Barbary War Meanwhile, the Barbary pirates, taking advantage of the American Navy's preoccupation with the British fleet during the War of 1812, had resumed operations against American merchantmen in the Mediterranean. Fortunately the treaty of peace signed on Christmas Eve 1814 freed United States men-of-war for renewed attention to this chronic trouble spot. In the autumn of 1815 John Adams arrived in the Mediterranean to assist frigates and and sloops and in maintaining peace and order in the area after strong squadrons under Commodores Stephen Decatur and William Bainbridge had induced the Barbary princes to honor their treaty commitments. Early in 1816 she returned home with dispatches, and with marble from Naples for refurbishing the Capitol at Washington.National Intelligencer, February 10, 1816 West Indies Pirates were also active in the West Indies at this time. Taking advantage of the chaos attendant upon the dissolution of Spain's American empire, lawless vessels from many nations preyed on neutral as well as Spanish commerce in the Caribbean, the Gulf of Mexico, and along the storied Spanish Main. For the next few years John Adams was busy fighting buccaneers. On 22 December 1817 she demanded and received the surrender of Amelia Island, off the east coast of Florida, the base from which corsairs of Commodore Louis-Michel Aury pounced upon merchantmen of all nations. Venezuela In the spring of 1819 Secretary of the Navy Smith Thompson selected Commodore Oliver Hazard Perry for the mission of establishing friendly relations with the government of newly independent Republic of Venezuela and Provinces United of Rio de La Plata and negotiating with the president Simon Bolivar to obtain restitution for United States schooners Tiger and Liberty that the Venezuelans patriots had illegally taken in the Orinoco river during the revolution. Perry boarded his flagship John Adams at Annapolis and sailed in company with schooner on 7 June. A month later he reached the mouth of the Orinoco, which he ascended to Angostura in Nonsuch while John Adams sailed on to Trinidad to await his return at Port of Spain. After protracted negotiation, the Vice President of Venezuela Francisco Antonio Zea granted all the demands of the United States on 11 August. However, during the passage down the river, Perry was stricken with yellow fever and died on board the John Adams. Commodore Charles Morris succeeded Perry in command of the squadron and John Adams accompanied his flagship Constellation on a voyage to the Plata River to continue the negotiations inaugurated by Perry to establish friendly relations with the new Latin American republics and to protect American commerce from South American privateers. After visiting Montevideo and Buenos Aires, both ships returned to the United States, arriving Hampton Roads on 24 April 1820. 1821–1845 In spite of these successes, piracy remained rampant in the West Indies, and John Adams was part of a strong West Indies Squadron created in 1821 to cope with the problem. Nicholas Biddle's ships labored with zeal; but the task, entailing careful searches by small-boat expeditions of innumerable bays, lagoons, and inlets, seemed endless. Yellow fever took a much heavier toll than the enemy necessitating reinforcements which arrived 3 March 1823 when Commodore David Porter's \\"Mosquito Fleet\\" anchored off Saint Thomas. Porter, the squadron's new commander, selected John Adams as his flagship. When Porter was recalled, his successor, Commodore Lewis Warrington retained John Adams as his flagship until 1826. From time to time, thereafter, the frigate returned to the West Indies for operations against pirates until 1829 when she was laid up and almost entirely rebuilt at the Navy Yard in Gosport, Virginia. John Adams joined the Mediterranean Squadron in 1831 as a frigate. One of her first duties was to take her former commander, ex-Commodore Porter, to Constantinople where he became the U.S.'s first chargé d'affaires. The ship was granted the rare privilege of passing through the Dardanelles with guns mounted. Thereafter, she convoyed ships in the Mediterranean and in 1833 visited Liberia. After extensive repairs in the United States, John Adams sailed from Hampton Roads on 5 May 1838, accompanied by , on a cruise around the world. Particular stress was placed upon showing the flag in the East Indies where the United States enjoyed a prosperous and growing trade. Both ships arrived Rio de Janeiro 10 July but departed separately, John Adams sailing on 25 July. She stopped at Zanzibar en route to Bombay, where she rejoined Columbia before sailing on to Goa and Colombo, Ceylon. At Colombo the ships learned that natives at Susoh (currently in Southwest Aceh Regency, Aceh, Indonesia) had attacked the American ship Eclipse. The squadron immediately sailed to the scene of the incident and bombarded the forts at Kuala Batee to induce the Rajahs of Sumatra to agree to offer assistance and protection to American vessels. They then landed over 300 marines and sailors to attack the village of Muckie, which they destroyed (Second Sumatran Expedition). Before returning to Rio de Janeiro on 23 April 1840, the squadron called at Singapore, Macau, Honolulu, Valparaíso, and Cape Horn. Mexican- American and Civil Wars John Adams finally arrived Boston about the middle of June where she was laid up until 1842. After duty on the Brazil Station, she went into ordinary where she remained until recommissioned at the beginning of the Mexican-U.S. War. She was anchored off the bar at Santiago 8 May 1846 during the Battle of Palo Alto. She then maintained a blockading station off the east coast of Mexico for the remainder of the war. John Adams returned to Boston in September 1848 and received extensive repairs before joining the Africa Station for action with the Royal Navy against the slave trade. She returned from this difficult duty in July 1853. Thereafter, with the exception of periods at home for repairs, John Adams operated in the Pacific and the Far East until after the outbreak of the Civil War. She sailed for home from Siam 6 July 1861 and reached New York 11 January 1862, bringing a box containing two letters from the King of Siam to President Lincoln, along with a sword and a pair of ivory tusks. John Adams was sent to Newport, Rhode Island, the wartime location of the Naval Academy, to act as training ship for midshipmen. In the summer of 1863 she joined the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron and took station off Morris Island inside Charleston Bar. There she served as flagship of the inner blockade until she sailed into the harbor after the evacuation of Charleston in February 1865. One of her crew, Coxswain Oliver O'Brien, received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the 1864 capture of a blockade runner. Another member of her crew, Acting Ensign Pierre d'Orléans, was a member of the Orleansist branch of the French royal family. Fate Late in the summer of 1865 she sailed to Boston where she was decommissioned in September. She was one of the oldest vessels in the US Navy at the time of her decommissioning. John Adams was sold 5 October 1867 for $1500 to the British government to use as quarters for the Hong Kong police.\\"From California and China\\". North American and United States Gazette (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania), 21 September 1867; Issue 29,123. She was taken to Hong Kong where her hulk was commissioned in 1868 for use as Water Police Headquarters. In February 1884 the hulk John Adams caught fire and was lost. later torpedoed and sank the burnt-out hulk.Hong Kong Police Force: Chronology of Notable Occasions and Events.

As an adult, he studied knowledge from the second-rank doctor Lương Đắc Bằng and passed the official government examination at the fairly late age of 44 in the exams of 1535. However, he passed the exam, ranking number one in the country. This was a period of great instability in Vietnam which may explain why he took the exam at such a late age. He served in the Mạc Dynasty court for just seven years until 1542 when he resigned after his official complaints of government corruptions were ignored. He then returned to his native village and opened a school. Among his students were Phùng Khắc Khoan (diplomat), Lương Hữu Khánh, Nguyễn Dữ (author of Truyền kỳ mạn lục). Khiêm became a person much sought after by many leaders during that time of upheaval, civil war, the Mạc collapse, and the rise of the Trịnh Lords and Nguyễn Lords. Both Trịnh Kiểm and Nguyễn Hoàng purportedly sought his advice in their pursuit of power. To the former, he gave the advice of being the real power behind the (restored) Lê Dynasty. To the latter, he advised building a base of power in the undeveloped south.Nghia M. Vo -Saigon: A History 2011 Page 13 \\"South Vietnam would not have existed had it not been fed by a relentless movement of Vietnamese southwards. ... advice of sage Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm (1491–1585), who told him the future would be better for him in the south: “Hoành Sơn nhất ...\\" Both men followed these suggestions, resulting in a political and military division of Vietnam that would last for 200 years. As a result of this sage advice, Khiêm gained a reputation as someone who could foretell the future. Some of his prophecies were of a Delphic nature as they were ambiguous and could be read in several ways.Anh Thư Hà, Hò̂ng Đức Trà̂n A brief chronology of Vietnam's history 2000 Page 133 \\"Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm - The Vietnamese people extol Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm as the Number One Oracle (Prophet) of Vietnam because he made a series of predictions to the benefit of posterity, which were referred to as “Divinations of Trạng (First ...\\" Khiêm was also a poet, composing many poems in Chinese and Nôm that have survived to this day. There is a long poem attributed to him called Sấm Trạng Trình (讖狀程, The Prophecies of Trạng Trình).Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm, \\"Sấm Trạng Trình\\" (Trạng Trình is one of Khiêm's nicknames.) This is the Vietnamese equivalent of the Nostradamus quatrains. It is suggestive, believed to predict future events, and very mysterious. This poem includes the line, \\"Vietnam is being created\\" (), an early use of the word \\"Vietnam\\". Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him. Modern Cult in the School of Teaching Goodness The School of Teaching Goodness emerged in the 1990s in the Vĩnh Bảo District, a rural area of the city of Hải Phòng. A local carpenter known simply as \\"Master Thu\\" claimed to have been visited at night by the spirit of Khiêm, who ordered him to build a shrine in his honor. Thu owned some land, where he built and inaugurated in 1996 a shrine he called Minh Đường Trung Tân (The School of Teaching Goodness). By 2016, it had attracted more than 10,000 visitors, and Thu had organized around the channeled messages of Khiêm a new religious movement with thousands of followers.Chung Van Hoang, New Religions and State’s Response to Religious Diversification in Contemporary Vietnam: Tensions from the Reinvention of the Sacred, Cham, Switzerland: Springer, 2017, 59–85. In 2016, a woman credited with spiritual powers who lived near the shrine claimed to have found Khiêm's coffin buried in her garden. State archeologists took the finding seriously and investigated it. The results were inconclusive, but the fame of the shrine grew as a result of the incident.Quỳnh Trang, \\"Hội khảo cổ nghiên cứu ngôi mộ nghi của Trạng trình Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm\\", VnEXpress, January 18, 2017.

The oil has a strong peanut flavor and aroma. It is often used in American, Chinese, South Asian and Southeast Asian cuisine, both for general cooking, and in the case of roasted oil, for added flavor. History Due to war shortages of other oils, use of readily available peanut oil increased in the United States during World War II.\\"The Peanut Situation\\" (Dec 12, 1942) The Billboard Uses Unrefined peanut oil has a smoke point of 320°F/160°C and is used as a flavorant for dishes akin to sesame oil. The refined peanut oil has a smoke point of 450 °F/232 °C is commonly used for frying volume batches of foods like French fries.The Smoke Point of Fats & Oils - TheSpruce.com =Other uses= Peanut oil, as with other vegetable oils, can be used to make soap by the process of saponification.\\"Saponification Table Plus The Characteristics of Oils in Soap\\", Soap Making Resource Peanut oil is safe for use as a massage oil. =Biodiesel= At the 1900 Paris Exhibition, the Otto Company, at the request of the French Government, demonstrated that peanut oil could be used as a source of fuel for the diesel engine; this was one of the earliest demonstrations of biodiesel technology. Composition Its major component fatty acids are oleic acid (46.8% as olein), linoleic acid (33.4% as linolein), and palmitic acid (10.0% as palmitin). Choose peanut oil and then \\"Oil, peanut, salad or cooking\\". The oil also contains some stearic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid and other fatty acids. Nutritional content According to the USDA data upon which the following table is based, 100 g of peanut oil contains 17.7 g of saturated fat, 48.3 g of monounsaturated fat, and 33.4 g of polyunsaturated fat. Health issues =Toxins= Highly refined peanut oil can contain traces of hexane, a petroleum byproduct used to maximize separation of oil from the solids of peanuts. The EPA identifies hexane as a neurotoxin in rat studies.Peanut Oil Extraction - Agico Group Official WebsiteHexane = EPA Report 09.2016 There are no specific regulations on the limits of hexane use in cooking oils. If quality control is neglected, peanuts that contain the mold that produces highly toxic aflatoxin can end up contaminating the oil derived from them. =Allergens= Those allergic to peanuts can consume highly refined peanut oil, but should avoid first-press, organic oil.Common Allergens - Peanut FARE (FoodAllergy.org) Most highly refined peanut oils remove the peanut allergens and have been shown to be safe for \\"the vast majority of peanut-allergic individuals\\". However, cold-pressed peanut oils may not remove the allergens and thus could be highly dangerous to people with peanut allergy.

History In 1539, Henry VIII ordered the construction of Calshot Castle, at the end of Calshot Spit, to defend the port of Southampton from attack. Its strategic importance continues to the present day, and there is still a military presence in Calshot, though the castle is no longer a manned fort. Calshot is notable for its role in the development of aircraft and flying boats. In 1913 the Royal Flying Corps established Calshot Naval Air Station (later known as RNAS Calshot and RAF Calshot) at the end of Calshot Spit. It was also at one point home to Lawrence of Arabia. Calshot Lifeboat Station was established in 1970 by the RNLI. =Relationship with Tristan da Cunha= Following a volcanic eruption in 1961, the population of the Tristan da Cunha islands was evacuated to Calshot. Many evacuees thrived, with the children attending local schools and adults employed in a variety of local businesses and ships. But problems occurred: one of the islanders' elders, a disabled gentleman called Ian Bootla, was mugged and the islanders lacked immunity from flu epidemics and also had to endure the harsh winter of 1962–63. Most of the islanders returned home, but some of the families decided to stay and remain a close- knit community centred on a complex of 50 houses called Tristan Close. Those that returned to Tristan da Cunha renamed the harbour there, Calshot Harbour after their temporary home. Today Calshot Castle and Coastguard Tower The original hangar from the World War II flying boats remains as an activity centre for watersports (including kite-surfing), climbing, snowboarding and track cycling. There is a small indoor velodrome, a dry ski slope, and facilities for climbing and bouldering. The climbing grades vary from about 3 to the occasional 8a. The centre offers residential and visitor courses. Next to the hangar is a dinghy marina. The approach road passes on the landward side of the spit, and there are a large number of beach huts. The spit comprises a flint pebble structure around one mile long. Between it and the main shore is a salt marshy area with a wealth of wildlife and birds. The nearby Fawley Power Station discharged cooling water into the shallow waters around Calshot beach, and this has led to some reports of warm water species being attracted into the Solent. The Habitats Directive Review of Consents for the Solent Maritime Special Area of Conservation (SAC) did indeed identify thermal pollution on the intertidal zone on the west shore of Southampton Water, but this is likely to be from more than this one source. Excavation for the nearby power station discovered buried land surfaces from the Neolithic period.

Biography  Steven Neal Barton was born on June 26, 1954, in Hot Springs, Arkansas, the youngest of three children of Tom and Mary Barton. He was raised in Nederland, Texas. He won a scholarship to the University of Texas at Austin (UT), where he majored in theater, dance and voice, and appeared in over 30 productions with UT and the Ballet of Austin. A UT endowed Presidential Scholarship is now named for him. After graduation he went to Europe and landed his first professional role in St. Gallen, Switzerland, then performed in several major Swiss, German and Austrian theater companies. He played leading roles in West Side Story, Godspell, Romeo and Juliet, The Fantasticks, The Threepenny Opera, Oklahoma!, Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Guys and Dolls, and Camelot, before playing the role of Munkustrap in the original Vienna cast of Cats, at the Theater an der Wien. At the Theater des Westens in Berlin he played roles in Guys and Dolls, Jesus Christ Superstar (as Jesus), La Cage aux Folles (as both Jean Michel and Albin/Zaza) and Robert in Company. In 1986 he originated the role of Raoul in Andrew Lloyd Webber's The Phantom of the Opera in London, and in 1988 reprised that role in the original Broadway cast. Barton was married to swing dancer and choreographer Denny Berry, who served as dance supervisor for the North American productions of The Phantom of the Opera, whom he met at college. A son, Edward, was born in Vienna in 1984; the couple separated at an unspecified later date. He was an Honorary Chairperson of the Steadman Hawkins Sports Medicine Foundation and an honorary member of the UTA Board of Education. In 1996 Barton returned to Vienna, where he took over the part of the Beast in Disney's Beauty and the Beast. In his final project, he originated the role of Graf von Krolock, a vampire in Jim Steinman's Tanz der Vampire, for which he won an IMAGE (International Music Award Germany) in 1998. Barton celebrated his 30-year onstage anniversary in 1997 during his run as von Krolock. Death Barton had, in the last years of his life, been battling with alcoholism and addiction to painkillers following chronic knee problems and had, only months before his death, started treatment for bipolar disorder. He was found dead at his apartment in Bremen, Germany on July 21, 2001 aged 47. While his death was initially attributed to heart failure, according to obituary information released by the press office for the New York production of The Phantom of the Opera, it was later ruled a suicide by the district attorney in Bremen after it was revealed an empty bottle of prescription heart medication was found at the scene.

FreePPP was widely considered the first working and most stable version of PPP for Apple Macintosh and led many PPP internet service providers to support Macintosh users for the first time. Besides the overall stability, usability was a large factor in the popularity of this implementation. A menu bar icon was introduced that gave users easy access to common tasks such as dialing and disconnecting. Modems were \\"auto-detected\\", keeping users from having to find and configure an init string for their modem (a common stumbling block for users). FreePPP was installed by a \\"lite\\" version of the commercial Internet Setup Monkey product, whose producer Rockstar Studios was a primary contributor to FreePPP. The installer included cartoon images of a monkey installing software on the computer.  Early history  FreePPP 1.0, the first version, was simply a repackaging of MacPPP from Merit Network; MacPPP developed for the most part by Larry Blunk. MacPPP was actually the first PPP for the Mac OS but was unstable and prone to error. The source code was made freely available and various users released fixes for common bugs. Steve Dagley aggregated most of those patches to MacPPP and added ISDN functionality. He re-released it as FreePPP in early 1994.  Adoption by Apple  FreePPP 2.5, the most popular version, was the result of Apple Computer getting involved in the development of MacPPP. Steve Dagley contacted Apple about his work with FreePPP and convinced Apple to use it for its Internet software, Cyberdog. An Apple engineer, Richard Reynolds, rewrote most of FreePPP, greatly improving stability. Richard left Apple to form Rockstar Studios along with Brian Chen, creator of the immensely popular screensaver from Berkeley Systems, \\"After Dark\\". Apple allowed Richard to take his work with him to Rockstar and continue it. Consequently, Steve Dagley and Richard (along with Rockstar) created The FreePPP Group to manage the distribution and licensing of FreePPP. Steve Dagley developed an all-new control panel that included location management. Rockstar Studios contributed PPP Menu and The Internet Setup Monkey. The Internet Setup Monkey included a cartoon monkey, developed by Matt Small, that appears to tear apart a computer, install FreePPP then put it back together. Rockstar sold this installer to Internet Service providers. This was a time when most operating systems did not come with any form of TCP networking support, requiring separate installation before its users could connect to the Internet. Installation and configuration issues were a common problem for both users and ISPs. Apple released a version of FreePPP under the old name MacPPP and included it in a few minor System 7.5.x releases. Open Transport eventually included a completely new PPP developed by Apple directly into Mac OS but many users choose FreePPP for its advanced and easy to use features. Eventually Rockstar Studios released a version of PPP Menu that supported Open Transport PPP (OT/PPP) consequently FreePPP users slowly migrated to Open Transport PPP. FreePPP is still widely available for users of older Macintosh hardware that cannot run Mac OS X. One of the most popular features of FreePPP is still included in macOS today. macOS includes a menu bar icon that allows users to open and close a PPP connection as well as configure PPP.  Legacy  As of 2004, Steve Dagley works for Netscape on the Mac OS version of Netscape Communicator. Richard Reynolds still works at Rockstar Studios. Rockstar Studios released software centered on FreePPP and Open Transport PPP though the late ’90s then changed its name to Rockstar Software and it changed its focus to Microsoft Windows based Internet account setup software. The company once again changed its name to Aramova, Inc. and changed its focus to wireless software. Aramova does not seem to have any macOS products at this time.  Contributors  Besides Steve Dagley and Richard Reynolds, other contributors in the FreePPP group are Mike Alexander, Yan Arrouye, Steve Brecher, Jim Browne, Alec Carlson, Tom Evans, Joe Husk, Cliff McCollum, Edward Moy, Tom Shaw and John Stephen. Most of the initial patches the Steve Dagley aggregated came from these contributors.

Burgoyne was a 21-year-old Royal Navy lieutenant, serving in the Crimean War when he performed the deed for which he was awarded the VC. Details On 29 May 1855, in the Sea of Azov, Crimea, Lieutenant Burgoyne of HMS Swallow, with Lieutenant Cecil William Buckley from HMS Miranda and Gunner John Robarts from HMS Ardent, volunteered to land at a beach where the Russian army were in strength. They were out of covering gunshot range of the ships offshore and met considerable enemy opposition, but managed to set fire to corn stores and ammunition dumps and destroy enemy equipment before embarking again.

The prime example is Peronospora farinosa featured in NCBI-TaxonomyNCBI-Taxonomy – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov and HYP3.HYP3 – ncbi.nlm.nih.gov This pathogen does not produce survival structures in the northern states of the United States, and overwinters as live mildew colonies in Gulf Coast states.

Upon closer inspection, a purple-brown mold (see arrow) becomes apparent. Small spores shaped like footballs can be observed among the mold with a 10x hand lens. In disease-favorable conditions (cool nights with long dew periods), downy mildew will spread rapidly, destroying leaf tissue without affecting stems or petioles.  Treatment and management  = Cultural options = Because the downy mildew pathogen does not overwinter in midwestern fields, crop rotations and tillage practices do not affect disease development. The pathogen tends to become established in late summer. Therefore, planting early season varieties may further reduce the already minor threat posed by downy mildew. = Chemical control = Fungicides applied specifically for downy mildew control may be unnecessary. Broad spectrum protectant fungicides such as chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and fixed copper are at least somewhat effective in protecting against downy mildew infection. Systemic fungicides are labeled for use against cucurbit downy mildew, but are recommended only after diagnosis of this disease has been confirmed. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has approved oxathiapiprolin for use against downy mildew. In Canada, a mixture of zoxamide and mancozeb was registered for control of the mildew under the trademark Gavel (fungicide) as early as 2008.grainews.ca: \\"Gowan buys Dow’s Gavel potato fungicide\\", 18 Jul 2008 = Organic control = One way to control downy mildew is to eliminate moisture and humidity around the impacted plants. Watering from below, such as with a drip system, and improve air circulation through selective pruning. In enclosed environments, like in the house or in a greenhouse, reducing the humidity will help as well.  Plant specific mildews  =Basil= Downy mildew of basil caused by Peronospora belbahrii has been a huge problem for both commercial producers and home growers. The disease was first reported in Italy in 2004,Garibaldi, A., Minuto, A., Minuto, G., Gullino, M.L., 2004. First Report of Downy Mildew on Basil (Ocimum basilicum) in Italy. Plant Disease 88, 312-312 was reported in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008Roberts, P.D., Raid, R.N., Harmon, P.F., Jordan, S.A., Palmateer, A.J., 2009. First Report of Downy Mildew Caused by a Peronospora sp. on Basil in Florida and the United States. Plant Disease 93, 199-199.Wick, R.L., Brazee, N.J., 2009. First Report of Downy Mildew Caused by a Peronospora Species on Sweet Basil (Ocimum basilicum) in Massachusetts. Plant Disease 93, 318-318. and has been steadily increasing in prevalence, distribution, and economic importance since then. =Cucurbitaceae= Cucurbitaceae downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora cubensis) is specific to cucurbits (e.g., cantaloupe (Cucumis melo), cucumber (Cucumis sativus), pumpkin, squash, watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) and other members of the gourd family). The disease is one of the most significant diseases of cucurbits worldwide. =Grapes= Plasmopara viticola is the causal agent of grapevine downy mildew. =Hops= Hop Downy Mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli) is specific to hops (Humulus lupulus). The disease is the single most devastating disease in Western United States hopyards, since the microbe thrives in moist climates. Infected young hop bines become stunted with thickened clusters of pale curled leaves. These spikes have a silvery upper surface, while the undersides of leaves become blackened with spores. These dwarfed spikes are called \\"basal spikes\\". 'Lateral' or 'terminal' spikes occur further up the vine. An entire hop crop could be devastated in only a few days. =Ornamentals= A new and particularly aggressive form of impatiens downy mildew has recently emerged as a major threat to the cultivation of ornamental impatiens in the United States, where they are one of the most popular ornamental plants. =Soybeans= Peronospora manshurica infects soybeans, reducing photosynthetic activity, yield, and quality. The fungus spreads by oospores on diseased leaves and/or on infected seed. The disease spreads in environments with high humidity and favors temperatures between 20-22 °C. Tufts of grayish to pale-colored sporangiophores on the underside of leaves easily distinguish the infection from other foliar diseases. The disease is often controlled using the fungicides mancozeb, maneb, or zineb. =Spinach= Downy mildew on spinach is caused by Peronospora effusa, an oomycete pathogen that poses a challenge to spinach production worldwide, especially in organic production. =Sunflowers= Plasmopara halstedii infects sunflowers, producing oospores which can remain dormant in the soil for many years.

It is located in the suburb of Yarralumla, near Lake Burley Griffin and Parliament House. It was built to house politicians when the Federal Parliament moved to Canberra from Melbourne in 1927. It was constructed by the contractor John Howie between 1922-1925. Originally opened in 1924 as Hostel No. 1, in 1927 it became known as the Hotel Canberra. History Hotel Canberra in the 1930s, with Albert Hall in the background. The federal government decided in January 1921 to construct a hostel in Canberra, to accommodate politicians and visitors, in anticipation of the relocation of federal government functions from Melbourne. The hotel was designed by federal architect John Smith Murdoch, and used an unusual (for a hotel) scheme of pavilions arranged around garden courts. The design gave each pavilion better outlook, and could be segregated from other pavilions (while still accessible to hotel services). The building opened on 10 December 1924.Australian Heritage Database - Hotel Canberra,Commonwealth Av, Yarralumla, ACT, Australia The Hotel Canberra was the first hotel to open in Canberra. It was followed shortly after (in 1926) by the Hotel Kurrajong, located on the other side of the central axis of the Parliamentary Triangle.Hotel Kurrajong Once the national capital moved to Canberra, a number of other hotels opened in 1927. The Hotel Canberra was not licensed to serve alcohol until 1928 (which is why it was initially called a \\"hostel\\"), owing to Minister for Home Affairs King O'Malley's decision to keep Canberra free of alcohol as it was being constructed.* Exploring the ACT and Southeast New South Wales, J. Kay McDonald, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1985, p41 The Canberra was frequently used as sitting-time accommodation by politicians and, in the early years, as long term accommodation for officials while homes were still being constructed for them. The same was true at the Hotel Kurrajong, with the Kurrajong reputedly favoured by politicians from the Australian Labor Party and the Canberra by politicians from the conservative parties.Australian Heritage Database - Hotel Kurrajong and Setting, 8 National Cct, Barton, ACT, Australia When James Scullin became Prime Minister of Australia in 1929, he refused to live in The Lodge, the official residence of the Prime Minister, and he and his wife lived at the Hotel Canberra during parliamentary sessions, and at their home in Melbourne at other times.Australia's Prime Ministers - Meet a PM - Scullin - Sarah Scullin During the Great Depression, economic conditions and the reduction in the number of government employees reduced demand for accommodation in Canberra, and the Canberra and the Kurrajong were the only hotels left open for a time. In 1950, the government gave up the management of the hotel and the lease was taken over by \\"Hotel Canberra Ltd\\", a subsidiary of Tooheys, a Sydney-based brewery. In 1974 the lease was not renewed and the hotel was shut down. Between 1976 and 1984 it was used as an annexe for Parliament House, providing office space for parliamentary staff. The hotel was designated as part of the National Estate by the federal government in 1980, shortly before a project began in 1982 to restore the hotel to its former glory and extend it in sympathetic style. After several years of troubles with the backers, Hyatt Hotels re-opened Hotel Canberra on 23 July 1988 as the new Hyatt Hotel Canberra, at the time the only international five-star hotel in Canberra. On 30 September 1998 , the building was added to the Interim Heritage Places Register of the Australian Capital Territory Heritage Register.

He was a member of the Kanō school of painting. Through his political connections, patronage, organization, and influence he was able to make the Kanō school into what it is today. The system was responsible for the training of a great majority of painters throughout the Edo period (1603–1868). After his death, he was referred to as Kohōgen (古法眼). Family Background The Kanō family are presumed to be the descendants from a line of warriors from the Kanō district. The Kanō district is now called Shizuoka Prefecture. The forebear of this family was Kanō Kagenobu. He seems to have been a retainer of the Imagawa family. It has been reported that he painted a picture of Mount Fuji for a visit to the shōgun Ashikaga Yoshinori in 1432. The Kanō family dominated the painting world from the end of the Muromachi period (1336–1573) to the end of the Edo period (1603–1868). Kanō Masanobu, Motonobu's father, was the founder of the Kanō school. Kanō Masanobu was the official court painter to the Ashikaga shogunate in 1481. Masanobu was a professional artist whose style derived from Kanga style. Masanobu’s descendants were the people that made up the Kanō school. The Kanō school had secular ink painters. Hosokawa Sumimoto on Horseback by Kanō Motonobu, Eisei Bunko Museum, 1507 Career Since Kanō Motonobu was a son and heir of the founder of the Kanō School, Kanō Masanobu, he was likely trained in Kanga (Chinese-style ink painting) by his father. Right away Motonobu showed great promise as an artist and procured several commissions from major patrons as early as nine years old. Such patrons include the Ashikaga shogunate, members of the imperial aristocracy, Kyoto merchant class, and major Kyoto shrines and temples. Portrait of Hosokawa Takakuni by Kanō Motonobu, Tōrin-in, 1543One of his earliest documented contracts was for a set of votive plaques (e-ma) depicting for the Thirty-six Poetry Immortals for the Shinto shrine of Itsukushima. It was commissioned by a group of Sakai merchants in 1515 and the pieces are now located in Hiroshima Prefecture. By the 1530s Motonobu had married the daughter of the head of the Tosa School of painting, Tosa Mitsunobu, had three sons (Shōei [1519–1592], Yusetsu [1514–1562], and Joshin), and lead a small Kanō sect in northern Kyoto. The workshop contains roughly ten people containing Motonobu, his three sons, Motonobu’s younger brother Yukinobu (1513–1575), and some assistants that might have not been blood related. Since Motonobu was the head or chief architect of these paintings he took on the contracting, production, and organization of the projects while still being very involved with the marketing of his work and his studio. Known for his charm and intellect, Motonobu became a fierce businessman, and frequently petitioned to the shogun for a vast amount of varied commissions with his fellow merchant, Hasuike Hideaki. However, the time he spent marketing did not deter him from his paintings. As head of the Kanō school, he took the most important rooms in a building commissioned, and then assigned his son and assistants other projects based on hierarchy. These projects could be painting their own rooms independently or grinding pigments, preparing the paper, painting the background color, or simply filled in large areas of color. As a result of Motonobu's marketing skills, the commissions grew allowing the workshop and school itself to expand. Motonobu trained his workshop which was full of members of his family and other apprentices to execute his many designs. The workshop trained other artists by watching the master painter work and emphasised recreating their master's style. Style Motonobu was known for his Chinese monochromatic style and characteristic brushwork, pioneering the suiboku-ga (sumi-e) painting style in Japan. The forms were organic, natural, and full of drama. Motonobu's commissions were generally designed for in the home of the samurai warrior class, focusing on fusuma and byōbu. His sumi-e style paintings are reported to take inspiration from three distinct Chinese masters of the sumi-e technique, Mu-ch'i Fa-ch'ang, Hsia Kuei, and Yü Chien (c. 1230). However, he was versatile in his painting and was able to produce landscapes, scenery, and figures of bold decorative patterns. This was likely due to his father-in-law being head of the Tosa school, Tosa Mitsunobu, who was famous for his revival of the yamato-e style. Noted works in the yamato-e style include a set of hand scrolls Seiryō-ji no engi (\\"Origins of Seiryō-ji\\", 1515; Kyoto, Seiryō-ji), and some fusuma wall paintings. By mastering these two distinct styles, Motonobu's artistic skills could be tailored to match his respective patron and create a unique fusion of Chinese and Japanese style. This fusion of Chinese style and iconography with Japanese aesthetics is what helped the Kanō school achieve the legendary status it is known for today. He also was a master in calligraphy, specifically the formal style known as shintai (\\"new form\\"), the more informal form known as gyōsho (\\"running style\\"), and the running style sōsho (\\"grass\\", very cursive style). Legacy One of Motonobu's greatest achievements was the creation of a new technique for painting. This technique formed the basis for the early Kanō school style. It was known as wa-kan, a mixture of Japanese and Chinese painting. This combination had the spatial solidity and careful brushwork techniques of Kanga. It also had some of the characteristics of Yamato-e style, for instance, the fine line and decorative patterning, use of colors, and gold leaf. The wall panels depicting Birds and Flowers of the Four Seasons shows this combination of styles. He taught other generations everything he learned. This established some creativity and flexibility in the Kanō school. The Story of Xiang yan (Tokyo National Museum) shows the emergence of Kanō style, although it has an underlying Chinese philosophy to it. But the figure in the foreground is active and the vertical plane makes the painting Japanese. The brushwork and compositional elements also make the painting appear distinctively Japanese. The Kanō school flourished because of leaders like Motonobu. His reputation, talent and developed organizational skills made this possible. Though the school was founded in the fifteenth century, its impact can still be felt in modern art across the world.  Works  * Kurama-dera engi (‘Origins of Kurama temple’; Zen Patriarchs), 1513.

The film was directed by Michael Schultz from a screenplay by Joel Schumacher. Starring Franklyn Ajaye, Bill Duke, George Carlin, Irwin Corey, Ivan Dixon, Antonio Fargas, Jack Kehoe, Clarence Muse, Lorraine Gary, The Pointer Sisters, and Richard Pryor, Car Wash is an episodic comedy about a day in the lives of the employees and the owner, Mr. B (Sully Boyar), of a Los Angeles, California car wash (filmed at a Westlake car wash at the corner of Rampart Boulevard and 6th Street). Plot Originally conceived as a musical, Car Wash deals with the exploits of a close-knit, multiracial group of employees at a Los Angeles car wash. In an episodic fashion, the film is set over a single day on a Friday in the month of July, during which all manner of strange visitors make cameo appearances, including Lorraine Gary as a hysterical wealthy woman from Beverly Hills dealing with a carsick son. Richard Pryor also appears in a cameo as a money-hungry evangelist named 'Daddy Rich' who preaches a pseudo- gospel of prosperity theology; The Pointer Sisters play the parts of his loyal (and singing) entourage, The Wilson Sisters. One main character is Abdullah, formerly Duane (Bill Duke), a Black Muslim revolutionary. Among his other misadventures in the film, the employees must deal with a man (\\"Professor\\" Irwin Corey) who fits the profile of the notorious \\"pop bottle bomber\\" being sought that day by the police. It causes employees, customers, and the owner of the car wash, Mr. B (Sully Boyar), to fear for their lives, but the strange man's \\"bomb\\" is simply a urine sample he is taking to the hospital. Mr. B's son Irwin (Richard Brestoff), a left-wing college student who smokes pot in the men's restroom and carries around a copy of Quotations from Chairman Mao, insists on spending a day with the \\"working class\\" employees, since he considers them \\"brothers\\" in the \\"struggle\\". As he gets ready to go to work, he sets off motion sensors that give him the first \\"human car wash\\", which he takes in good-natured (if pot-induced) stride. George Carlin appears as a taxi driver searching fruitlessly for a prostitute who stiffed him for a fare. The prostitute, Marleen, has her own hopes shattered as a customer with whom she apparently has fallen in love has given her a false telephone number. Ex-con Lonnie (Ivan Dixon) is the foreman of the car wash who tries to mentor Abdullah while struggling to raise two young children and fend off his parole officer (Jason Bernard). Abdullah confronts Lindy (Antonio Fargas) and sharply criticizes his cross-dressing, to which Lindy coolly replies, \\"I'm more man than you'll ever be and more woman than you'll ever get\\". T.C. (Franklin Ajaye) is another young employee who is determined to win a radio call-in contest to win tickets for a rock concert and to convince his estranged girlfriend Mona (Tracy Reed), who works as a waitress in a diner across the street, to accompany him. Floyd and Lloyd are musicians who have an audition for an agent at the end of their shift and spend the entire movie doing their jazz-blues dance moves in front of bewildered customers. Justin (Leon Pinkney) clashes with his girlfriend, Loretta (Renn Woods), who wants him to go back to college, but he refuses out of the feeling that a black man like him will not get anywhere in the world with any kind of education. Justin's elderly grandfather, Snapper (Clarence Muse), works as the shoe shine man at the car wash and is a follower of Daddy Rich. Other employees include womanizer Geronimo (Ray Vitte); Scruggs (Jack Kehoe), a cowboy who works as the gas pump operator; Hippo (James Spinks), an overweight employee who clearly hooks up with Marleen the prostitute; Chuco (Pepe Serna), a scheming Latino employee; Goody (Henry Kingi), a Native American employee; Charlie (Arthur French), a scruffy middle-aged employee; Sly (Garrett Morris), a con artist employee and bookie who later gets arrested right at the car wash for a series of unpaid parking tickets; and Earl (Leonard Jackson), who has the attitude of being superior to his colleagues because he does not get wet; he would appear to think that he is the supervisor at the car wash. Among everything, Mr. B constantly makes passes against the receptionist Marsha (Melanie Mayron) as an escape from his troubled home life. Mr. B is constantly tense and worried throughout the film as he fears about his car wash going out of business due to a competitor a few miles down the street. Lonnie, on the other hand, is full of ideas on how to save the car wash that he cannot get Mr. B or anyone else to listen to, mostly due to Mr. B being a cheapskate. Later at the end of the movie, Abdullah, after being fired by Mr. B for his unexplained absences, appears in the office with a gun while Lonnie is closing up, intending to rob the business. Lonnie talks him out of it, and the two commiserate at the status society has imposed on them: two proud men forced to work at a meaningless job for meager pay. It is a melancholy ending to the day as they all go their separate ways, knowing that they will be back tomorrow to do it all over again.

Though they had speaking roles, nearly all of their scenes were deleted from the theatrical version and they are only seen in the background. Their scenes were restored for the edited television version. The film also featured the speaking voices of local L.A. disc jockeys Jay Butler, J.J. Jackson, Rod McGrew, Sarina C. Grant, and Cleveland's Billy Bass, all heard in the background of the film on the fictional \\"KGYS\\" radio station. Production Originally the project was intended as a stage production, which would feature a replicate car wash on stage. The hope was that, if successful, the project could be adapted as a movie. Upon telling the idea to then head of Universal Ned Tanen, the producers were persuaded to make the film version instead. Joel Schumacher was chosen to write based on his work writing \\"Sparkle\\" Unusual for film production, the sound track was recorded prior to filming of the movie.[ Rose Royce bio] The director wanted the actors to actually listen to the same music that would later be added in post-production while filming the scenes. Reception The film presently has a score of 88% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 24 reviews, with an average score of 6.68 out of 10. Roger Ebert gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, calling it \\"a sunny, lively comedy\\" with a \\"tremendous sense of life.\\" Vincent Canby of The New York Times called it \\"a cheerful, somewhat vulgar, very cleverly executed comedy,\\" adding, \\"Nothing terribly dramatic happens, and some of the comedy gets a bit forced, but the wonder of the film is how it manages to succeed so much of the time.\\"Canby, Vincent (October 16, 1976). \\"'Car Wash' Froths on Screen With Pop Life\\".

Since the film's initial release, it has had a small but constant following as a cult film, some notable disciples including Michael Bay and Sandford Bay. The film won the Best Music Award and the Technical Grand Prize at the 1977 Cannes Film Festival plus a nomination for Golden Palm. In the same year it was nominated for a Golden Globe, plus it won a Grammy for Best Album of Original Score written for a Motion Picture or Television Special. Gay film historian Vito Russo cites the character Lindy, played by Antonio Fargas, as being both funny and challenging through his gay militancy. Russo deems Lindy's response to the militant Abdullah as being potentially revolutionary had it not been placed strictly within a comedic context.Russo, pp. 228—29 African American cultural critic Angela Nelson identifies Lindy as a \\"sophisticated sissy.\\"Means Coleman, p. 142 The \\"sophisticated sissy\\" characterization is often used as an easy contrast to the \\"appropriate\\" masculine behaviour that heterosexual black male characters are expected to display. Music Car Wash, recorded by Rose Royce, was a major success, yielding three Billboard R&B; Top Ten singles: \\"Car Wash\\", \\"I Wanna Get Next to You\\", and \\"I'm Going Down\\". The title track, written and produced by Norman Whitfield, was a #1 hit and was one of the biggest hit singles of the disco era. Meanwhile, The Pointer Sisters' \\"You Gotta Believe\\"—which the group performed during their cameo in the film—was a Top Twenty R&B; hit. The Car Wash soundtrack won a 1977 Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album.[ allmusic Biography] Versions Car Wash had its network television premiere on NBC Monday Night at the Movies in 1978. Along with the standard dubbing of strong language, many scenes that included the gay character Lindy (Fargas) were trimmed or deleted. To replace these shortened scenes, and therefore shortened film, a subplot of a diner owner (Danny DeVito) (scenes shot for the theatrical version but cut prior to release) were re-inserted. As of 2013, commercially available versions of the movie were of the original theatrical release, not the revised TV version. Notes References * Means Coleman, Robin R. (1998).

The club was opened on February 22, 1935, by Max Gordon. Originally, the club presented folk music and beat poetry, but it became primarily a jazz music venue in 1957. It has hosted many highly renowned jazz musicians since then, and today is the oldest operating jazz club in New York City. History =Early years= Max Gordon opened the Village Vanguard in 1934 on Charles Street and Greenwich Avenue. He intended it to be a forum for poets and artists as well as a site for musical performances. Due to insufficient facilities, Gordon was refused a cabaret license from the police department and was unable to create the club that he envisioned. In his autobiography he wrote, \\"I knew if I was ever to get anywhere in the nightclub business, I'd have to find another place with two johns, two exits, two hundred feet away from a church or synagogue or school, and with the rent under $100 a month.\\"Max Gordon, Live at the Village Vanguard (New York: Da Capo Press, 1980), p. 25. . In 1934, he moved his business and purchased the Golden Triangle, a speakeasy at 178 Seventh Avenue South. The Golden Triangle opened its doors in 1935.Martin Williams, Jazz Heritage (New York: Oxford University Press, 1985), p. 137. . The Golden Triangle's basement facility structure resembled that of an isosceles triangle. After purchasing the property, Gordon changed the name of the club to the Village Vanguard. Like its prototype on Charles Street, the Vanguard was dedicated to poetry readings and folk music. During the 1930s and 1940s, visitors to the club heard poetry read by Maxwell Bodenheim and Harry Kemp, blues and folk music by Lead Belly, and Caribbean calypso by the Duke of Iron. Painters discussed the Spanish Civil War between walls dotted by political posters.Lorraine Gordon, Alive at the Village Vanguard: My Life in and Out of Jazz Time (New York: Hal Leonard Corporation, 2006), p. 97. . Comedians such as Phil Leeds performed stand-up routines.Gordon (2006), p. 99. =Jazz= Maxine Sullivan, March 1947 Lorraine Gordon wrote, \\"The biggest reason my pals and I went to the Vanguard, though, was because there were jazz jam sessions in the afternoons on Sundays. You could go hear Lester Young, Ben Webster; all the greatest jazz musicians for fifty cents at the door, or something like that.\\" Although jazz was not yet the main attraction at the club, the Vanguard was a haven for small, swing groups.Martin Williams, Jazz Changes (New York: Oxford University Press, 1992), p. 262. . In the 1930s and 1940s, Sidney Bechet, Una Mae Carlisle, Art Hodes, and Mary Lou Williams performed at the Vanguard. Lorraine Gordon, Max Gordon's wife, said, \\"in time, Max began to book acts, often three a night. Many proved to be high-caliber jazzmen.\\"Gordon (2006), p. 98. In 1940, Roy Eldridge performed at the Vanguard. His performance and his dedicated fans raised the possibility that jazz could be the main attraction.Martin Williams, Jazz Changes, p. 260. As modern jazz developed in the 1940s, small groups began to dominate the Vanguard. College students and artists in Greenwich Village took an interest in jazz.John Hasse, Jazz First Century (New York: Harper Collins, 2000), p. 117. . In 1940, a resident trio was formed by Eddie Heywood, Zutty Singleton, and Jimmy Hamilton.John S. Wilson, \\"Eddie Heywood, 73, Jazz Pianist, Arranger and Composer, Is Dead\\" , The New York Times, January 4, 1989. Dexter Gordon and Benny Bailey in 1977 By 1957, one commentator writes, \\"Gordon reversed his policy, putting jazz at the top of the bill and letting the folknicks…and the comics…fill it out. Thus the Vanguard booked Miles Davis, Horace Silver, Thelonious Monk, Gerry Mulligan, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Jimmy Giuffre, Sonny Rollins, Anita O'Day, Charlie Mingus, Bill Evans (a regular), Stan Getz, Carmen McRae.\\"Martin Williams, Jazz Changes, p. 137. The booking of Thelonious Monk was a particularly interesting story that demonstrated the Vanguard's ability to take a relatively unknown musician and help launch his career. The story of Monk's introduction to the Vanguard began with the first ever encounter between Max and Lorraine. Max and Lorraine first met each other in the Bluebell Bakery, a \\"homey little Fire Island joint.\\"Gordon (2006), p. 95. After she walked in and spotted Max (who she knew to be the owner of the Village Vanguard), Lorraine proposed to him that he showcase Thelonious Monk at the club for a week. He agreed and on September 14, 1948, Monk opened for the Vanguard. The reception was not ideal. \\"[N]obody came. None of the so-called jazz critics. None of the so-called cognoscenti. Zilch.\\" But Lorraine continued to sponsor Monk as a genius and through her persistence helped him grow into the pillar of jazz he is today. From the 1950s on, the Vanguard was the leading small venue for jazz, launching many celebrated careers and sustaining others that were already aloft. The Thad Jones–Mel Lewis Orchestra that eventually became the Vanguard Jazz Orchestra played from 1966 to 1990 on Monday nights. In 1989, Max Gordon died. The day after, Lorraine Gordon closed the Vanguard. The following day, she reopened it and continued to run the place. On June 9, 2018, Lorraine Gordon died at the age of 95 from a stroke. Recordings The Vanguard helped start many careers and has hosted many recordings that are regarded as masterpieces in its basement, making it now a club of international renown. On 3 November 1957, during some of the first recording sessions at the club, Sonny Rollins, a tenor sax player, recorded three LPs. These recordings were at the forefront of the hard-bop movement. The LPs documented two different saxophone-bass-drums trios. Rollins had shown an interest in smaller ensembles as early as 1955; in Paradox, he exchanged four-measure phrases with drummer Max Roach, with no other instrument taking part. In the Vanguard recordings we hear similar styles in arrangements.Thomas Owens, Bebop (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 86. . In the song \\"Old Devil Moon\\", Rollins is accompanied only by a bassist and a drummer. Musically, this song set the standard for the piano-less trio. Following Rollins, recordings continued; The Gerry Mulligan Concert Jazz Band performed and recorded there in December 1960 after returning from a European Tour. Then there was John Coltrane's and Bill Evans's Vanguard titles, both from 1961 (Evans was extensively recorded at the Village Vanguard just three months before his death in 1980). Coltrane's album was five titles taken from 22 recorded songs over four nights at the Vanguard. In 1962 The Cannonball Adderley Sextet in New York was released. The Thad Jones/Mel Lewis Orchestra performed every Monday Night beginning in 1965, recording several times, and in 1976 hosted Dexter Gordon's \\"Homecoming\\" performance with Woody Shaw. Rahsaan Roland Kirk performed several shows at the Vanguard in May 1970 that were compiled for his album Rahsaan Rahsaan. During the same year and only four months apart, Pat Patrick and Thelonious Monk played together at the Village Vanguard. Other recordings include Art Pepper's Thursday Night at the Village Vanguard(1977), Tommy Flanagan's Nights at the Vanguard (1986), and Wynton Marsalis's seven-disc Live at the Vanguard (1999). \\"The words 'Live at the Village Vanguard' do have a direct and positive influence on an album's sales\\", said Bruce Lundvall, president of Blue Note, a jazz label with more than a dozen \\"Live at the Vanguard\\" titles in its catalog.

The penny knife dates from the 18th century and was a very basic utility knife, originally with a fixed blade. It received the name penny knife for what it reportedly cost in England and America during the late 18th century: one penny. The famous Fuller's Penny Knife helped build the reputation of Sheffield, England, cutlers in the pre-industrial era of the early 18th century.Sheffield, The Athenaeum, London: John Francis, No. 2420, 14 March 1874, p. 351 Description The penny knife would later evolve into a very simple, mass-produced pocketknife with a folding blade, which pivoted freely in and out of the handle without a backspring or other device to hold it in position (other than the frictional pressure of the knife handle itself). This type of inexpensive folding knife was popular with small rural farmers in the United States, England, France, Italy, Portugal, and Spain for much of the 19th and part of the 20th century, and consequently is often termed a farmer knife, sodbuster knife, or peasant knife.The Youth's Companion, Boston, MA: Perry Mason & Co., Vol. 52, No. 1 (2 January 1879), p. 108 Antique penny knives have increased significantly in value and can sell for as much as $500(US). In modern production, the smallest models of the Opinel, an early 20th-century peasant's knife, continue to utilize this basic design, consisting of a folding blade pivoting on an axle mounted through a steel-bolstered wooden handle.

Over the span of her career, she has released over 200 albums in at least twelve different languages, including Greek, French, English, German, Dutch, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Hebrew, Welsh, Mandarin Chinese and Corsican. Mouskouri became well-known throughout Europe for the song \\"The White Rose of Athens\\", recorded first in German as \\"Weiße Rosen aus Athen\\" as an adaptation of her Greek song \\"Σαν σφυρίξεις τρείς φορές\\" (San sfyríxeis tris forés, \\"When you whistle three times\\"). It became her first record to sell over one million copies. Later in 1963, she represented Luxembourg at the Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"À force de prier\\". Her friendship with the composer Michel Legrand led to the recording by Mouskouri of the theme song of the Oscar-nominated film The Umbrellas of Cherbourg. From 1968 to 1976, she hosted her own TV show produced by BBC, Presenting Nana Mouskouri. Her popularity as a multilingual television personality and distinctive image, owing to the then unusual signature black-rimmed glasses, turned Mouskouri into an international star. \\"Je chante avec toi Liberté\\", recorded in 1981, is perhaps her biggest hit to date, performed in at least five languages – French, English as \\"Song for Liberty\\", German as \\"Lied der Freiheit\\", Spanish as \\"Libertad\\" and Portuguese as \\"Liberdade\\". \\"Only Love\\", a song recorded in 1985 as the theme song of TV series Mistral's Daughter, gained worldwide popularity along with its other versions in French (as \\"L'Amour en Héritage\\"), Italian (as \\"Come un'eredità\\"), Spanish (as \\"La dicha del amor\\"), and German (as \\"Aber die Liebe bleibt\\"). It became her only UK hit single when it reached number two in February 1986. Mouskouri became a spokesperson for UNICEF in 1993 and was elected to the European Parliament as a Greek deputy from 1994 to 1999. In 2015 she was awarded the Echo Music Prize for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono-Akademie. Early years Nana Mouskouri's family lived in Chania, Crete, where her father, Constantine, worked as a film projectionist in a local cinema; her mother, Alice, worked in the same cinema as an usherette. When Mouskouri was three, her family moved to Athens. Mouskouri's family sent her and her older sister Eugenía (Jenny) to the Athens Conservatoire. Although Mouskouri had displayed exceptional musical talent from age six, Jenny initially appeared to be the more gifted sibling. Financially unable to support both girls' studies, the parents asked their tutor which one should continue. The sister conceded that Jenny had the better voice, but Nana was the one with the true inner need to sing. Mouskouri has said that a medical examination revealed she only has one functioning vocal cord and this could well account for her remarkable singing voice (in her younger years ranging from a husky, dark alto, which she later dropped, to a ringing coloratura mezzo), as opposed to her breathy, raspy speaking voice. Mouskouri's early childhood was marked by the German Nazi occupation of Greece. Her father became part of the anti-Nazi resistance movement in Athens. Mouskouri began singing lessons at age 12. As a child, she listened to radio broadcasts of singers including Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday, and Édith Piaf. In 1950, she was accepted at the Conservatoire. She studied classical music with an emphasis on singing opera. After eight years at the Conservatoire, Mouskouri was encouraged by her friends to experiment with jazz music. She began singing with her friends' jazz group at night. However, when Mouskouri's Conservatory professor found out about Mouskouri's involvement with a genre of music that was not in keeping with her classical studies, he prevented her from sitting for her end-of-year exams. During an episode of \\"Joanna Lumley's Greek Odyssey\\", shown on the UK ITV channel in the autumn of 2011, Mouskouri told the actress Joanna Lumley how she had been scheduled to sing at the amphitheatre at Epidauros with other students of the Conservatoire, when upon arrival at the amphitheatre word came through from the Conservatoire in Athens that she had just been barred from participating in the performance there due to her involvement in light music. Mouskouri subsequently left the Conservatoire and began performing at the Zaki club in Athens. She began singing jazz in nightclubs with a bias towards Ella Fitzgerald repertoire. In 1957, she recorded her first song, \\"Fascination\\", in both Greek and English for Odeon/EMI Greece. By 1958 while still performing at the Zaki, she met Greek composer Manos Hadjidakis. Hadjidakis was impressed by Nana's voice and offered to write songs for her. In 1959 Mouskouri performed Hadjidakis' \\"Κάπου υπάρχει η αγάπη μου\\" (Kápou ipárchi i agápi mou, \\"Somewhere my love exists\\"; co-written with poet Nikos Gatsos) at the inaugural Greek Song Festival. The song won first prize, and Mouskouri began to be noticed. At the 1960 Greek Song Festival, she performed two more Hadjidakis compositions, \\"Τιμωρία\\" (Timōría, \\"Punishment\\") and \\"Κυπαρισσάκι\\" (Kyparissáki, \\"Little cypress\\"). Both these songs tied for first prize. Mouskouri performed Kostas Yannidis' composition, \\"Ξύπνα αγάπη μου\\" (Xýpna agápi mou, \\"Wake up, my love\\"), at the Mediterranean Song Festival, held in Barcelona that year. The song won first prize, and she went on to sign a recording contract with Paris- based Philips-Fontana. In 1961, Mouskouri performed the soundtrack of a German documentary about Greece. This resulted in the German-language single Weiße Rosen aus Athen (\\"White Roses from Athens\\"). The song was originally adapted by Hadjidakis from a folk melody. It became a success, selling over a million copies in Germany. The song was later translated into several languages and it went on to become one of Mouskouri's signature tunes. Nana Mouskouri with her first husband Georges Petsilas in the Netherlands in 1971 Family life Mouskouri has been married twice: firstly at 25, to Yorgos (George) Petsilas, a guitarist in her backing band (the trio \\"The Athenians\\") and the first man she had kissed. They had two children (Nicolas Petsilas in 1968 and Hélène (Lénou) Petsilas (singer) in 1970) but divorced when Mouskouri was 39. Not long after that, she started a relationship with her record producer André Chapelle, but they did not marry then because she \\"didn't want to bring another father into the family\\" and divorce was against her conservative upbringing. They eventually married on January 13, 2003, and live primarily in Switzerland. Life outside Greece In 1960, Mouskouri moved to Paris. She performed Luxembourg's entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1963 that year, \\"À force de prier\\". Although the song achieved only eighth place in the contest, it achieved commercial success, and helped win her the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque in France. Mouskouri soon attracted the attention of French composer Michel Legrand, who composed two songs which became major French hits for her: \\"Les Parapluies de Cherbourg\\" (1964) and an arrangement of Katherine K. Davis's \\"Carol of the Drum\\", \\"L'Enfant au Tambour\\" (1965). In 1962, she met Quincy Jones, who persuaded her to travel to New York City to record an album of American jazz titled The Girl from Greece Sings. Following that she scored another hit in the United Kingdom with the song \\"My Colouring Book\\" (later included in her 1973 album Songs from her TV series). In 1965, she recorded her second English-language album to be released in the United States, entitled Nana Sings. American singer Harry Belafonte heard and liked the album. Belafonte brought Mouskouri on tour with him through 1966. They teamed for a duo album entitled An Evening With Belafonte/Mouskouri. During this tour, Belafonte suggested that Mouskouri remove her signature black-rimmed glasses when on stage. She was so unhappy with the request that she wanted to quit the show after only two days. Finally, Belafonte relented and respected her wish to perform while wearing glasses.\\"Going out on a song: Nana Mouskouri sets off on farewell tour after 40-year career\\", Jonathan Brown, The Independent on Sunday, 26 October 2007. On September 15, 1965, Mouskouri appeared for the first time on American television with Harry Belafonte on the Danny Kaye Show. While on the show Mouskouri performed \\"Telalima\\" followed by \\"Όπα νινα ναϊ\\" (Opa nina nai) accompanied by Harry Belafonte and Danny Kaye. Mouskouri's 1967 French album Le Jour où la colombe raised her to super- stardom in France. This album featured many of her French songs, \\"Au cœur de septembre\\", \\"Adieu Angélina\\", \\"Robe bleue, robe blanche\\" and the French pop classic \\"Le Temps des cerises\\". Mouskouri made her first appearance at Paris' legendary Olympia concert theatre the same year, singing French pop, Greek folk, and Hadjidakis numbers. These successes across Europe and elsewhere impressed Yvonne Littlewood, the BBC producer who had first met Mouskouri at the 1963 Eurovision Song Contest in London. Following several successful guest appearances on British TV after her Eurovision performance, the BBC then invited Mouskouri and her backing group, the Athenians, to start hosting a TV series called Presenting… Nana Mouskouri from 1968 onwards. Each episode of the series typically contained songs from her developing repertoire of Greek folk music, French chansons, classical pieces and contemporary pop, and the shows often featured world music stars of the time as guests, making it one of the first BBC TV series to do so regularly. Despite the fact that stars from mainland Europe singing in languages other than English have tended to find it difficult to break into the British market, the series proved very popular with viewers of the new BBC-2 channel, and it ran until the mid-1970s. As well as performing British and American pop and folk songs in her shows, Mouskouri also welcomed the television audience, chatted to her guest stars and gave spoken introductions to her French and Greek songs in fluent English. These introductions, along with a modest stage presence and her bespectacled appearance, made her a very distinctive star, as Yvonne Littlewood later explained: : \\"I suppose it was unusual to see a singer wearing glasses. She didn't look like everyone else. She didn't have blonde hair, and she was very distinctive in her appearance. […] You know, we should remember that, in those days, we didn't have all the holiday programmes, so Greek music and anything Greek wasn’t as well known to the average public as it is now. […] She would give the gist [in English] of the subject of the song before she sang it, and that was really quite unique and quite charming.\\"Yvonne Littlewood speaking on \\"Legends: Nana Mouskouri\\" (BBC, 2008; Youtube video). Nana Mouskouri receiving two gold discs for record sales in Netherlands (1971) In 1969, Mouskouri released a full-length British LP, Over and over, which reached number 10 and spent almost two years in the UK album charts. This was the first of a series of English-language albums which, boosted by her TV appearances, sold extremely well in the UK and Ireland, as well as in other European countries, during the early 1970s, including The exquisite Nana Mouskouri (1969), Turn on the sun (1970), A place in my heart (1971) and Presenting... Nana Mouskouri (1973), while concerts from two of her British tours were also recorded and released as LPs: British Concert (1972) and Live at the Albert Hall (1974). Mouskouri's international appeal encouraged the BBC to sell her programmes to television stations across the world, a fact which she acknowledged in a BBC interview in 2014: : \\"This series – I mean, for about 10 years I was doing every year the series on BBC-2… and they went everywhere… in Asia… of course in the Commonwealth… but even in South America… so that I think that I owe to the BBC a lot. And to Yvonne Littlewood, really.\\" Nana Mouskouri speaking on \\"BBC Breakfast\\" (BBC-1, 8th Sept 2014; Youtube video). Mouskouri also hosted her own shows for French and West German broadcasters during this period. At a time when TV programmes could attract huge audiences, her popularity as a multilingual television personality turned her into a truly international star. Although music series such as hers were becoming less common on British TV as the 1970s wore on, the BBC continued to engage her regularly for one-off television specials and guest appearances on other programmes until the mid-1980s, by which time she had been a regular contributor to British TV for more than 20 years. Meanwhile, during the 1970s and 1980s, she expanded her concert tour to include her new fans, not only in the United Kingdom, but also in Ireland, New Zealand, Japan and Australia, where she met Frank Hardy, who followed her to the south of France in 1976. Always a prolific recording artist, the 1970s saw Mouskouri record several LPs in German, including the hit albums, Sieben schwarze Rosen (1975) and Lieder, die die Liebe schreibt (1978). In France, she continued a series of top-selling records, such as Comme un soleil (1971), Une voix qui vient du cœur (1972), Vieilles chansons de France (1973), and Quand tu chantes (1976). Meanwhile, Passport, a compilation including her most popular songs in English, reached number 3 in the UK album charts in 1976 and won for her a gold disc. As her fame began spreading outside her fanbase in Europe, the USA and the Commonwealth, Mouskouri was asked to record songs for the Japanese market. Meanwhile, in 1976, a renowned Taiwanese author, Echo, heard her music and introduced it to one of her female radio DJ friends. Mouskouri's records then became popular in Taiwan, especially among high school and college students, with one of her British albums, Nana's book of songs (1974) becoming particularly popular. Middle years In 1979, Mouskouri released another English-language album named Roses and Sunshine. This album consisted largely of folk and country material, and included work from sources including Neil Young, Dolly Parton, Bob Dylan and John Denver. It was well received in Canada, and one of the album's tracks, \\"Even Now\\" (not the same song as the 1978 Barry Manilow hit), became a staple on beautiful music radio stations in the United States. She scored a worldwide hit in 1981 with \\"Je chante avec toi Liberté\\", which was translated into several languages after its success in France. The momentum from this album also helped boost her following German album, Meine Lieder sind mein Leben. In 1984, Mouskouri returned to Greece and performed to a large audience at the Odeon of Herodes Atticus; her first performance in her homeland since 1962. In 1985, Mouskouri recorded \\"Only Love\\", the theme song to the British TV series Mistral's Daughter – based upon the novel by Judith Krantz – which reached number 2 in the UK charts. The song was also a hit in its other versions: L'Amour en Héritage (French), Come un'eredità (Italian), La dicha del amor (Spanish), and Aber die Liebe bleibt (German). The German version was also recorded with an alternate set of lyrics under the title Der wilde Wein but was withdrawn in favour of Aber die Liebe bleibt. That same year, Mouskouri made a play for the Spanish-language market with the hit single Con Toda el Alma. The song was a major success in Spain, Argentina and Chile. She released five albums in different languages in 1987, and the following year returned to her classical conservatory roots with the double LP The Classical Nana (a.k.a. Nana Classique), which featured adaptations of classical songs and excerpts from opera. By the end of 1987, she had performed a series of concerts in Asia, including South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand. Later years Mouskouri's 1991 English album, Only Love: The Best of Nana Mouskouri, became her best-selling release in the United States. She spent much of the 1990s touring the globe. Among her early 1990s albums were spiritual music, Gospel (1990), the Spanish-language Nuestras Canciones, the multilingual, Mediterranean-themed Côté Sud, Côté Coeur (1992), Dix Mille Ans Encore, Falling in Love Again: Great Songs From the Movies. Falling in Love featured two duets with Harry Belafonte. In 1993, Mouskouri recorded the album Hollywood. Produced by Michel Legrand it was a collection of famous songs from films, and served not only as a tribute to the world of cinema, but also as a personal reference to childhood memories of sitting with her father in his projection room in Crete. She recorded several more albums over 1996 and 1997, including the Spanish Nana Latina (which featured duets with Julio Iglesias and Mercedes Sosa), the English-language Return to Love, and the French pop classics, Hommages. In 1997, she staged a high-profile Concert for Peace at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. This concert was later released as an album, and aired as a TV special on PBS in the United States. On 30 May 2013, Mouskouri was awarded an honorary degree by McGill University, Canada. UNICEF and politics Mouskouri was appointed a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador in October 1993. She took over from the previous ambassador, the recently deceased actress Audrey Hepburn. Mouskouri's first U.N. mission took her to Bosnia to draw attention to the plight of children affected by the Bosnian war. She went on to give a series of fund- raising concerts in Sweden and Belgium. She was a Member of the European Parliament through the New Democracy party from 1994 until 1999, when she resigned from her position as an MEP. Several reasons have been given for the resignation, one being her pacifism, and another being that she felt ill- equipped for the day-to-day work of a politician. 21st century Nana Mouskouri, waiting for an interview in 2006 Mouskouri lives in Switzerland with Chapelle, and, until her final performance in 2008, performed hundreds of concerts every year throughout her career. In 2004, her French record company released a 34-CD box set of more than 600 of Mouskouri's mostly French songs. In 2006 she made a guest appearance at that year's Eurovision Song Contest which was held, for the first time ever, in her native Greece. The ancient Herodes Atticus Theatre, in Athens, Greece In the same year, she announced her plans to retire. From 2005 until 2008, she conducted a farewell concert tour of Europe, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, South America, the United States, and Canada. On July 23 and 24, 2008, Mouskouri gave her two final 'Farewell Concert' performances at the ancient Herodes Atticus Theatre, in Athens, Greece, before a packed stadium, including Greece's Prime Minister and Athens mayor, plus the mayors of Berlin, Paris and Luxembourg, along with fans from around the world and thousands of her Athenian admirers. In 2010, in response to the financial crisis in Greece,The EU economic situation and Greece – ECFIN – European Commission, \\"the [European] Council decided in April 2009 that Greece was in excessive deficit\\" Mouskouri announced that she would forgo her pension to contribute to the country's recovery. She commented: \\"Everywhere I see stories about my country going bankrupt. And people are aggressive about it. It's frightening. And it's painful for me. Nobody wants their country to be treated badly. It's frustrating and very sad.\\" In late 2011, Mouskouri released two newly recorded CDs, the first featuring songs of the Greek Islands, recorded with other Greek singers, and the second featuring duets with French contemporaries. In late November 2011 Mouskouri sang again at a single concert, with guests, in Berlin, commemorating the 50th anniversary of her hit single \\"The White Rose of Athens\\". She then did a concert tour in Germany in 2012. At age 80, she embarked on a three-year Happy Birthday Tour and in 2018 had booked a five-month Forever Young Tour through parts of Europe and North America. In 2015 she was awarded with the Echo Music Prize for Outstanding achievements by the German music association Deutsche Phono- Akademie. In popular culture The British comedian Benny Hill impersonated Mouskouri on The Benny Hill Show. Wearing a long dress, large glasses and long black hair, he talked and sang with a slow and quiet voice. He introduced a song with a long translation into English of all the events supposedly mentioned in the song... and then sang just a single line of \\"Greek\\".Season 3, Episode 3: Episode #3.3 IMDb.com, The Benny Hill Show (1969), Episode list. Andrea Martin played Mouskouri in a sketch, 'The Nana Mouskouri Story', during the 1981–1982 season of SCTV (later included in a DVD compilation.) In 1976, Ronnie Barker performed a song in drag as a parody of Mouskouri in The Two Ronnies as Nana Moussaka. Mouskouri was also parodied in the first episode of the 1970s New Zealand political satire A Week Of It. In 1991, British comedienne Victoria Wood mentioned Mouskouri in her original song, \\"The Reincarnation Song.\\" The song was included in Wood's television special of that year, Victoria Wood: Sold Out. In the Ed, Edd n Eddy episode O-Ed-Eleven, Eddy's brother is shown to have a Nana Mouskouri poster in his old bedroom. Karl Pilkington included Mouskouri as a clue in his contest 'Rockbusters', part of the radio show The Ricky Gervais Show on XFM. Broadcasting on December 31, 2005, the clue was \\"Me granny's taking a penalty. She better get the ball in the back of the net,\\" initials (NM) = Nana Mouskouri (nanna must score 'ere). Gervais described this clue as \\"one of his best clues ever.\\" In 2015, Liina Vahtrik parodied her song \\"Only Love\\" on the Estonian version of Your Face Sounds Familiar.

The forty canons passed at this meeting should be considered in connection with those of the synods of Agile (506) and Orleans (511; qq.v.). They were intended to do for the Burgundian kingdom what these had done for the Visigothic or Frankish -- though the speedy dissolution of the former made their effect slight. Several of them, however, were included in a later (Spanish) collection of the canons of Agile (though with some modifications in the direction of less severity), and thus continued to have an influence on subsequent practise. The spirit of Avitus breathes through them all. An important section deals with the inalienability of ecclesiastical property; a more vigorous repression of Arianism is demanded, though the return of individuals to the Church is made easy. It appears that priests and deacons were married, and that the episcopal oversight embraced the monasteries. The enforcement of the rights of bishops corresponds to the treatment of the metropolitan power. The number of forbidden degrees for marriage is increased, in har mony with older legislation, apparently with an eye to the case of a royal official who had married his deceased wife's sister; this led to an attempt on the king's part to discipline the bishops, and to a firm pronouncement on their part at the first Synod of Lyons (before 523), at which eleven of the members of the Synod of Epao were present.\\" **Bibliography: The Acta, ed.

Respawning is the recreation of an entity after its death or destruction, perhaps after losing one of its lives. Despawning is the deletion of an entity from the game world. All player characters typically spawn at the start of a round, whereas some objects or mobs may spawn after the occurrence of a particular event or delay. When a player character respawns, they generally do so in an earlier point of the level and get some kind of penalty. The term was coined by id Software within the context of its game, Doom. Spawn points Spawn points are areas in a level where players spawn. In levels designed for team play, these points are usually grouped so that each team spawns in their own tight area of the level. Spawn points are typically reserved for one team at any time and often have the ability to change hands to the other team. Some games even allow spawn points to be created by players; using a beacon for example in Battlefield 2142. \\"Odd\\" spawn points cause the player to be spawned as if actively entering the game world, rather than merely appearing there. Regarding player-created spawn points, the game Enemy Territory: Quake Wars allows players utilizing the Strogg class (Strogg team version of GDF Medic class) to create \\"spawn hosts\\" out of the bodies of fallen GDF enemies. Any player on the Strogg team can use any unused spawn host and the player – upon death – can use it to spawn closer to the objective or in a tactical location, being effective tools for defending a location or advancing the front line. The spawn host disappears after the Strogg player respawns at its location, so the spawn host can only be used once. Conversely, players utilizing the GDF Medic class can disable and remove Strogg player-created spawn hosts by zapping them with their defibrillator pads. Spawn camping is a practice where a player waits near precise spawn points to kill enemies as they spawn. This is usually considered to be poor sportsmanship and some players even perceive it to be exploitative of the game itself. Most team-based games have some kind of protection against spawn camping, such as a one-way door that only allows players to leave the spawn area, permanent AI defences or perhaps a timer which kills enemies if they spend too long around the spawn area. Games with capturable spawn points will often leave some spawn points without this sort of camping protection. Spawn points for game objects are often abused in a similar fashion in game types such as role-playing games. Enemy respawning In some games, enemies may be respawned (or, equivalently, new ones spawned) to keep players on their toes and create tension, or force players to move on, making it too costly (in resources) and/or too dangerous to stay in one place for too long. Enemies may visibly spawn or, in more realistic games, spawn outside the player's line of sight and move towards the player. Early games including monster respawning are Joust, Doom and its sequel Doom II: Hell on Earth. The enemies in these games had the ability to spawn from their teammates. In MMORPGs, it is typical for monsters or mobs of monsters to continually respawn to allow all players a chance to fight. Some of these games implement instances, which create a temporary copy of the game world and its characters, reserved for a subset of players; this allows each subset the chance to experience that part of the game without any interference from uninvited guests. Player-requested entities In some games a player who has access to debugging or administrative tools can spawn entities or pickups with said tools.

Ehrlich theorized from very early in his career that chemical structure could be used to explain why the immune response occurred in reaction to infection. He believed that toxins and antitoxins were chemical substances at a time when very little was known about their nature. The theory explains the interaction of antibodies and antigens in the blood, and how antibodies are produced. History In 1891, Paul Ehrlich joined the newly established Robert Koch Institute in Berlin upon the invitation of Robert Koch himself. By 1896 a new branch, the Institute for Serum Research and Testing (Institut für Serumforschung und Serumprüfung), was established in Frankfurt with Ehrlich as its founding director. He worked on antitoxins for diphtheria and their binding to antibodies in the blood. He hypothesised that antibodies bind to antigens through special chemical structures that he called \\"side chains\\" (which he later named \\"receptors\\"). Borrowing a concept used by Emil Fischer in 1894 to explain the interaction between an enzyme and its substrate, Ehrlich proposed that binding of the receptor to an infectious agent was like the fit between a lock and key. He published the first part of his side-chain theory in 1897, and its full form in 1900 in a lecture he delivered to the Royal Society in London. Postulate Ehrlich's theory can be summarised with the following tenets: # Antibodies are produced by white blood cells normally and they act as side chains (receptors) on the cell membrane. # Antibody specificity exists for specific interaction with a given antigen. # Antigen- antibody interaction occurs by precise binding through the side chains. Concept right right Ehrlich supposed that living cells have side-chains in the same way dyes have side-chains which are related to their coloring properties. These side chains can link with a particular toxin (or any antigen), just as Emil Fischer said enzymes must bind to their receptors \\"as lock and key.\\" Ehrlich theorised that a cell under threat grew additional side-chains to bind the toxin, and that these additional side chains broke off to become the antibodies that are circulated through the body. According to this theory, the surface of white blood cells is covered with many side chains that form chemical links with the antigens. For any given antigen, at least one of these side chains would bind, stimulating the cell to produce more of the same type, which would then be liberated into the blood stream as antibodies. According to Ehrlich, an antibody could be considered an irregularly shaped, microscopic, three-dimensional label that would bind to a specific antigen but not to the other cells of the organism. It was these antibodies that Ehrlich first described as \\"magic bullets\\", agents that specifically target toxins or pathogens without harming the body. Ehrlich suggested that interaction between an infectious agent and a cell-bound receptor would induce the cell to produce and release more receptors with the same specificity. According to Ehrlich’s theory, the specificity of the receptor was determined before its exposure to antigen, and the antigen selected the appropriate receptor. Ultimately all aspects of Ehrlich’s theory would be proven correct with the minor exception that the “receptor” exists as both a soluble antibody molecule and as a cell-bound receptor; it is the soluble form that is secreted rather than the bound form released.

It is concurrent with the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) for from Burlington to Oakville. Although the Highway 403 designation was first applied in 1963 to a short stub of freeway branching off the QEW, the entire route was not completed until August 15, 1997, when the section from Brantford to the then-still independent Town of Ancaster was opened to traffic. The section of Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April 27, 2016. The majority of Highway 403 is surrounded by suburban land use, except west of Ancaster, where it passes through agricultural land; Brantford is the only urban area through this section. In Hamilton, Highway 403 descends the Niagara Escarpment, then wraps around the northern side of Hamilton Harbour to encounter the QEW. From there, co-signed with the QEW, it travels straight through Burlington and Oakville, departing from the QEW to the north at the Mississauga–Oakville boundary. The freeway then crosses through the centre of Mississauga in an east–west direction, serving its city centre, before turning north. Highway 403 then ends at Highway 401, but the physical freeway continues north of Highway 401 as Highway 410 to Brampton.  Route description  = Woodstock to Burlington = Highway 403 begins at a junction with Highway 401 on the outskirts of Woodstock. The eastbound lanes split from eastbound Highway 401, whereas the westbound lanes merge into westbound Highway 401. It travels along the back lot lines of the second concession south of former Highway 2. It passes beneath Oxford County Road 55 (formerly Highway 53) and curves southeast. After crossing into the third concession, it curves back to the east. The highway travels straight for several kilometres, meeting with the southern leg of Highway 24, which travels south to Simcoe. The highway crosses the Grand River to the south of Paris, then passes over former Highway 2 as it enters Brantford. As it passes through Brantford, the highway angles southeast and passes beneath the northern leg of Highway 24 and then the Wayne Gretzky Parkway. The route exits the small city to the east and curves northeast shortly thereafter. It travels between Jerseyville Road and former Highway 2 to Ancaster, jogging to avoid cutting through Dunmark Lake. As the freeway enters Ancaster, it once again crosses former Highway 2 and dips through the southern side of the town. Highway 2 / 53 south of Jerseyville East of Ancaster, the freeway passes through a short greenbelt, with Hamilton Golf and Country Club lying to the north. A divided segment of Highway 6 meets the freeway and continues concurrently with it through Hamilton; to the south, Highway 6 travels to Hamilton International Airport, Caledonia, and Jarvis at Highway 3. Continuing east, Highway 403 and Highway 6 curve north into Hamilton and meet the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway before abruptly turning to the east and descending the Niagara Escarpment. Scenic views of Hamilton, its harbour, port and Lower Princess Falls are along this steep descent. At the bottom of the escarpment the highway travels through a narrow, heavily developed corridor alongside former Highway 8. It passes beneath multiple bridges in a depressed trench, eventually curving north at a sharp corner and passing beneath more bridges. This section features a reduced speed limit of as opposed to . The highway returns to ground level alongside the Chedoke Creek, a now-channelized river from which the freeway may take its name. As the freeway continues north, it crosses an isthmus between Hamilton Harbour and Cootes Paradise alongside several roads which it has served to replace. It circles around the northern shore of Hamilton Harbour and returns to an eastward orientation. The concurrency with Highway 6 ends at an interchange where Highway 403 continues east and Highway 6 departs north towards Guelph. The freeway continues straight for several kilometres and encounters the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 407 at the Freeman Interchange. = Burlington to Mississauga = 401 and 410 In Mississauga. Highway 403 and the Queen Elizabeth Way converge at the Freeman Interchange in Burlington. Highway 407 ETR also begins at this junction. Highway 403 travels concurrently with the QEW for between the Freeman Interchange and Oakville, a straight section surrounded almost entirely by commercial units and warehouses. At the Ford Assembly Plant near the Halton–Peel regional boundary, Highway 403 branches off from the QEW and heads north for along the western edge of Mississauga. Here it interchanges with Highway 407 again, but the two freeways curve at 90 degrees to avoid each other. Highway 407 continues to the north and west, while Highway 403 turns east to follow alongside a hydro corridor through the centre of Mississauga. From this interchange to Highway 401, high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes are present in the shoulder lanes for vehicles with at least one passenger. Sandwiched between residential subdivisions on both sides, the freeway passes beneath Erin Mills Parkway and crosses the Credit River. On the other side of the river, Highway 403 skirts to the north of downtown Mississauga, as well as the Square One Shopping Centre. It passes beneath Hurontario Street (formerly Highway 10) and begins to widen before abruptly curving to the north as it approaches Cawthra Road. As the curve ends, the freeway widens further into ten lanes. This short section passes beneath Eglinton Avenue and begins to diverge into a sprawling interchange with Highways 410 and 401, where the route terminates. The highway meets Highway 410, which runs northward to Brampton, at the collector lanes, just south of Highway 401, where the highway curves east and ends soon after by feeding into both the eastbound collector and express lanes. Highway 410 and Highway 403 in Mississauga, showing the two sets of ramps to link 401 and 403, since each has a collector-express system.  History  Highway 2) interchange in Ancaster Though one of the first divided highways conceived for Ontario, Highway 403 is one of the most recently completed freeways in the province; the multiple segments of the route did not become continuous until 2002. Planning for the route was underway by 1958, with the completion of the Freeman Bypass along the QEW providing a three-legged junction for the new freeway. Sections of Highway 403 through Hamilton opened between December 1963 and September 1969. An isolated section known as the Brantford Bypass was opened in October 1966, and would remain unconnected to other freeways for over 20 years. Plans for a third segment through Mississauga were contemplated throughout the 1960s, but were not finalized until late 1977, after which construction began. Portions opened at both ends in 1980 and 1981, while the central gap, crossing the Credit River, was completed in December 1982. Construction to bridge the gaps in Highway 403 between Ancaster and Woodstock was carried out over three major phases. The first phase was a short extension of the Brantford Bypass beginning in 1975. Later, work began to connect that extension with Highway 401 near Woodstock, opening in 1988. The last phase, between Ancaster and Brantford, was opened in 1997. The final discontinuity, between Burlington and Oakville, was signed as a concurrency with the QEW in 2002. Originally, this section was to have travelled along the corridor occupied by Highway 407, until budget shortfalls in 1995 resulted in a change of plans. = Predecessors = Highway 2 near Woodstock was widened into a divided four lane highway by 1936 and is one of the precursors to Highway 403. The corridor that connects London and Hamilton has always been considered important to Ontario. In late October 1793, Captain Smith and 100 Queen's Rangers returned from carving The Governor's Road through the thick forests between Dundas and the present location of Paris. John Graves Simcoe was tasked with defending Upper Canada from the United States following the American Revolution and with opening the virgin territory to settlement. After establishing a \\"temporary\\" capital at York, Simcoe ordered an inland route constructed between Cootes Paradise at the tip of Lake Ontario and his proposed capital of London. By the spring of 1794, the road was extended as far as La Tranche, now the Thames River. Today, most of this route forms part of former Highway 2 and former Highway 5. The paving of the divided four-lane Middle Road, with gentle curves, a grass median, and grade-separated interchanges, would set the stage for the freeway concept. It was the first intercity freeway in North America when it opened in June 1939. Thomas McQuesten, the new minister of the Department of Highways and the man most responsible for the Middle Road, decided to apply the concept to sections of Highway 2 plagued with congestion. A portion east of Woodstock was rebuilt in this fashion, but World War II would put an end to McQuesten's ambitions, at least temporarily. = Initial construction = Highway 403 in Hamilton at the bottom of the Niagara Escarpment The end of the Korean War in 1953 heralded the resumption of freeway construction in Ontario; the advances in machinery more than made up for lost time. The construction of Highway 401 across the province took first priority. However, the opening of the section of Highway 401 from Highway 4 near London to Highway 2 east of Woodstock on May 31, 1957 would complete part of the route required between London and Hamilton.Ministry of Transportation and Communications pp. 8–9 By 1958, planning on the Chedoke Expressway, or Controlled Access Highway 403, was well underway, though plans for a four-lane freeway between Woodstock and Hamilton existed as early as 1954. The opening of the Freeman Bypass of the QEW in August 1958 provided a connection point for a new freeway, and construction began the same day that the Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway opened: October 31, 1958. Highway 403 between Longwood Road (Highway 2) and the QEW was opened to traffic on December 1, 1963 at a length of . Work was already underway on the next section of the route that would extend it to Aberdeen Avenue. That section opened on July 9, 1965, extending the freeway by . Meanwhile, to the west, work had begun on a bypass of Brantford. The new freeway passed north of the city between Paris Road in the west and the junction of Highway 2 and Highway 53 in the east, a distance of ; it opened October 31, 1966. A portion of the Brantford Bypass was itself bypassed in 1997 when the final section of Highway 403 was completed and is known as Garden Avenue. However, the Brantford Bypass would remain an isolated section of Highway 403 for over 20 years. In Hamilton, work was underway on an extension of the Chedoke Expressway to Mohawk Road, crossing the Niagara Escarpment. This tedious project, which required extensive rock blasting, was soon accompanied by construction from Mohawk Road to Highway 2 near Ancaster. Both projects were completed together and originally scheduled to be opened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on August 22, 1969. However, local residents complained the new section lacked any barriers preventing children from wandering onto the highway, postponing the ceremony until August 27 as temporary snow fencing was erected. This proved inadequate, and protests grew more vocal over the following week. Several petitions were presented to Deputy Highway Minister H. Howden on August 26, and the ceremonies were cancelled. Over the following week, Minister of Highways George Gomme met with residents and reached a compromise whereby a 24–hour patrol was established to watch for children until a proper fence could be constructed. The route was opened on September 3, without any ceremony. This completed the Hamilton section of Highway 403. = Mississauga = Highway 403 and QEW interchange in Oakville; the Ford Motor Assembly Plant is visible in the distance Planning for the segment of Highway 403 through Mississauga dates to the late 1950s when the Hamilton Expressway appeared on the Metropolitan Toronto's regional transportation plan. It was to be a continuation of the Richview Expressway, which was ultimately never built, continuing from Toronto to Hamilton.Toronto transportation plan, 1959 The plan featured the expressway's eastern terminus at the Highway 401 and Highway 427 interchange. As Toronto's anti-expressway movement gained momentum, provincial plans shifted the Hamilton Expressway to the west near Etobicoke Creek. In 1962, the right-of-way alongside the hydro corridor between Burlington and Etobicoke Creek was protected after traffic studies indicated the need for a future freeway. On May 25, 1965, the Department of Highways unveiled the Toronto Region Western Section Highway Planning Study. The plan designated Highway 403 north from Burlington and then parallel with the QEW to Highway 401 near Highway 27. By the time construction was actually underway, plans had been completely modified to connect the overburdened QEW at Oakville with Highway 401 at the new Highway 410 interchange. This interchange was a better connection point for Highway 403, but would also require the widening of Highway 401 from six lanes to twelve. Plans were submitted and approved in December 1977 by Mississauga city council, and construction began. A view of downtown Mississauga as seen atop Highway 403 The new freeway opened in sections during the early 1980s. The first section between Cawthra Road and Highway 401 was opened August 18, 1980. This was followed by a short section from Highway 5 (Dundas Street) south to the QEW at Ford Drive, which opened in mid-1981, with a further extension to Erin Mills Parkway opening on November 17th of that year. The final section to be opened took the longest to complete, involving construction of two bridges over the Credit River valley; it opened on December 2, 1982. The cost of the entire Mississauga segment was $87 million. Around the same period, the Ministry of Transportation began to study upgrading Highway 401 to a collector–express system between Renforth Drive and Highway 403, and along Highway 403 between Highway 401 and Highway 10. This took place between late 1982 and the summer of 1985; the existing outermost ramps from Highway 403 to Highway 401 eastbound were re-designated to serve collector traffic, as a pair of flyover ramps were added inside the interchange to serve motorists in the express lanes. Highway 401 junction with Highways 403 and 410 in 1987. Note the unused right-of-way in the middle of the interchange reserved for the future Highway 401 express lanes and flyover ramps to Highway 410. Highway 401 which was widened between 1982 and 1985 to a collector / express system in order to accommodate Highway 403 traffic. The right-of-way originally intended for Highway 403 between Cawthra Road and Etobicoke Creek was eventually used for a controlled-access arterial extension called Eastgate Parkway, which was planned beginning in 1982. The extension was built between 1988 and 1994, incorporating a portion of Fieldgate Drive at the eastern end. The first section, between Cawthra Road and Dixie Road, opened in early 1991. This was followed several years later by the section from Dixie Road to Eglinton Avenue that opened in late 1994. In the fall of 1991, alongside the widening of Highway 410 into a full freeway, construction began on the connecting ramps between Highway 403 and Highway 410, which pass under the existing bridge structures for Highway 401 collector traffic, while new overpasses were constructed in the centre for Highway 401 express lanes. The loop ramp from Highway 410 southbound to Highway 401 eastbound was replaced by a semi-directional high-speed flyover, while a new directional ramp and semi- direction flyover were added to serve westbound Highway 401 commuters. Prior to the opening of this link, traffic from both freeways was forced onto eastbound Highway 401. The link opened on November 2, 1992 at a cost of $7.3 million. = Bridging the gaps = Highway 403 eastbound at the Grand River bridge near Brantford. The stretch between Woodstock and Hamilton was rehabilitated in 2011, which included installing central guardrails and paved shoulders. In 1975, construction began on a westward extension of the Brantford Bypass, from Highway 2 (Paris Road) to Rest Acres Road, which would become Highway 24. This work consisted of the twin bridges over the Grand River and an interchange at Rest Acres Road. The Canadian National Railway underpass west of Highway 2 was built by the railway. By the beginning of 1978, this work was completed. Work resumed west of Highway 24 during the spring of 1982 to connect with Highway 401 near Woodstock to relieve the high traffic volumes along Highway 2. This included interchanges at Brant County Road 25 and Highway 53. A section from Highway 24 to County Road 25 was opened in November 1984, followed by the section west of there to Highway 53 one year later. Construction of the gap between Highway 53 and Highway 401 began in late 1985, followed by the Highway 401 overpass for the westbound lanes, which began in 1987. Transportation minister Ed Fulton ceremoniously opened the new freeway connection on September 26, 1988, completing the Woodstock to Brantford link. Highway 403 was briefly left with three discontinuous sections: Woodstock–Brantford, Ancaster–Burlington, and Oakville–Mississauga. Between Brantford and Ancaster, traffic was defaulted onto Highway 2, a four- lane road with numerous private driveways and at-grade intersections. On March 24, 1987, Chris Ward, MPP for Wentworth North officially announced that construction of the missing link between Brantford and Ancaster would begin in 1989. Construction did not actually begin until the summer of 1990. It included interchanges at Garden Avenue, Highway 52 and Highway 2. A continuous construction program was carried out over the next seven years, with the link opening on August 15, 1997. Highway 2, which was the only parallel route before the completion of Highway 403, was subsequently downloaded to regional jurisdiction. The eastern terminus of Highway 403 in Mississauga, feeding into the collector and express lanes of Highway 401 = Controversy = Though some officials considered Highway 403 to be a perfect example of a freeway construction process, it was not built without its share of controversy. In addition to the previously mentioned issues that occurred in 1969, portions of the freeway through Mississauga were built alongside established communities, leading to angry homeowners' associations pressuring the province for noise mitigation measures and compensation. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the Mississauga section of Highway 403 was the site of more than two dozen fatal accidents over a five-year period, one of the highest rates in North America at the time, despite being up to modern road standards. This led Peel Regional Police and the media to nickname it the \\"Death Highway.\\" In particular, the stretch from Mavis Road to Erin Mills Parkway has been the site of numerous accidents. In this section, Highway 403 features a downward slope as motorists head eastbound towards the Mavis Road interchange; drivers complain of having to slam on the brakes when traffic comes to a standstill, leading to rear-end collisions. There is also glare from the sun that causes vision problems throughout the day. In addition, unusual for an urban freeway, this section of Highway 403 had no lighting until the mid-2000s. = Recent construction = The Hamilton-Brantford and Mississauga sections of Highway 403 were initially planned to be linked up along the corridor now occupied by Highway 407. However, the Bob Rae government altered these plans in 1995 due to budgetary constraints. It was also announced the Mississauga section of Highway 403 would be renumbered as Highway 410, although this was not done. Instead, Highway 403 was signed concurrently along the Queen Elizabeth Way in 2002, remedying the discontinuity. HOV lanes on the co-signed 403-QEW In early 2001, high-mast lighting was scheduled to be added to the unlighted Mississauga section between Highway 407 and Eastgate Parkway. In 2003, the right shoulders between Erin Mills Parkway and Mavis Road were widened for GO Transit and Mississauga Transit to run express bus services. These projects preceded the widening of Highway 403 between Highway 407 and Highway 401/410, through which a high-occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane was added in each direction; the project started in summer of 2004 and these opened on December 13, 2005. The HOV lanes and the dividing Ontario Tall Wall concrete barrier were constructed using the existing right-of-way provided by the grass median. Highway 403 between Woodstock and Burlington was formally dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway on April 27, 2016. Land was reserved at the Highway 401/403/410 junction for a loop ramp from Highway 403 eastbound to Highway 401 westbound, and a directional ramp for the opposite movement. This would give Highway 401 eastbound traffic direct access to Cawthra Road, making it a full four-way interchange. Construction is underway on these links as of 2017, after Highway 401 was recently widened to a 12-lane collector-express system west of the interchange. The construction was completed in 2019. In Oakville, improvements are being made to the Highway 403/QEW/Ford Drive interchange. As of 2017, traffic using the existing loop ramp in the NE corner to access Highway 403/QEW will be directed onto a new overpass instead of sharing the existing overpass with westbound Highway 403 traffic, which should allow for longer merging lanes since the convergence of Highway 403 and the QEW is an infamous bottleneck. At the present Highway 403 only connects to the QEW west of the interchange, but flyover ramps are being proposed from Highway 403 to the QEW east of that junction using the existing right-of-way which would allow for a direct freeway connection from Milton to south Mississauga.

This is notable for being the first act of jurisdiction of this kind recorded of a bishop of Rome. Contumeliosus was the bishop of Riez in Gaul, and a sufficiently learned man that Bishop Avitus of Vienne forwarded to him some of his works for editing.Avitus of Vienne, (Danuta Shanzer, Ian N. Wood, trans.) Liverpool University Press, 2002 Contumeliosus was subsequently accused of adultery and alienation of church property. At a Council of Marseilles, convened in 533 by Caesarius, Metropolitan Archbishop of Arles, Contumeliosus admitted to the charges, and was subsequently deposed.

Guyon, A. de Vogüé, Éditions du Cerf, 1994 Caesarius is considered to be of the last generation of church leaders of Gaul that worked to promote large-scale ascetic elements into the Western Christian tradition. William E. Klingshirn's study of Caesarius depicts Caesarius as having the reputation of a \\"popular preacher of great fervour and enduring influence\\".Conrad Leyser, \\"Authority and Asceticism from Augustine to Gregory the Great\\" Among those who exercised the greatest influence on Caesarius were Augustine of Hippo, Julianus Pomerius, and John Cassian. The most important problem for Caesarius was the efficiency of the bishop's fulfillment of his pastoral duties. By that time, preaching had already become part of the standard church service in Gaul; many bishops recognized the importance of such a means of educating morality and encouraged it. However, Caesarius' enthusiasm was outstanding in its own way, and he urged his clergy to preach as often as possible, in the church and outside it, to the willing and the opposing. Caesarius' sermon topics generally dealt with moral issues.  Life  Map of participants of the Council of Agde in 506 AD, presided by Caesarius. Caesarius was born at what is now Chalon-sur-Saône, to Roman-Burgundian parents in the last years of the Western Empire. His sister, Caesaria, to whom he addressed his \\"Regula ad Virgines\\" (Rule for Virgins), also presided over the convent he had founded. At the time of his birth, Germanic kings de facto governed Burgundy despite nominal Roman administration. Unlike his parents, Caesarius was born with a very strong and intense feeling for religion which alienated him from his family for the majority of his adolescence. Caesarius left home at seventeen and studied under Bishop Sylvester for a few years. Afterwards, he found his way to Lérins (Lerinum), an island monastery, which was known to be a major dynamo for creative forces of work in the Church of Roman Gaul.William Daly, \\"Caesarius of Arles a precursor of medieval Christendom,\\" Traditio: Studies in Ancient and Medieval History, Thought, and Religion 26 (1970): 6 After training as a monk at Lérins he devoted himself to reading and applying the scripture in hopes of improving the quality and organization of Christian life and serving the poor. He rapidly became master of all the learning and discipline the monastery communicated and was appointed cellarer. However, he proved unpopular at Lérins when, as cellarer of the monastery, he withheld food from monks because he felt they were insufficiently austere. As a result, the abbot Porcarius removed Caesarius from his post, whereupon he began starving himself; the abbot intervened and sent Caesarius to Arles ostensibly for medical care. After living at Lérins for over a decade and his health steadily decreasing from monastic over-exertion, Caesarius sought out a different clerical Christian community in Arles. The Christian community he joined fostered him back to health and he was soon popularly elected as their bishop. By middle age, he had “become and was to remain the leading ecclesiastical statesman and spiritual force of his age”.Daly,Caesarius of Arles, 5 His concern for the poor and sick was famous throughout and beyond Gaul as he regularly provided ransom for prisoners and aided the sick and the poor. Upon arriving in the city, the Vita Caesarii claims that Caesarius discovered, completely to his surprise, that the bishop of Arles - Aeonius - was a kinsman from Chalon (concivis pariter et propinquus - \\"at once a fellow citizen and a relative\\"). Aeonius later ordained his young relative deacon and then presbyter. For three years he presided over a monastery in Arles; but of this building no vestige is now left. At the death of Aeonius the clergy, citizens, and persons in authority proceeded, as Aeonius himself had suggested, to elect Caesarius to the vacant seat, although Klingshirn suggests that there may have been considerable local hostility, that Caesarius' election may have been heavily disputed and that another cleric, Iohannes, who appears in the episcopal fasti of Arles may have been elected bishop. Caesarius was consecrated in 502, being probably about 33 years of age. In the fulfilment of his new duties he was courageous and unworldly, but yet exhibited great power of kindly adaptation. He took great pains to induce the laity to join in the sacred offices, and encouraged inquiry into points not made clear in his sermons. He also ordered the people to study Holy Scripture at home, and treat the word of God with the same reverence as the sacraments. He was specially zealous in redeeming captives, even selling church ornaments for this purpose. As bishop, Caesarius lived in a political world whose main theme was competition for Southern Gallic control among the Visigothic, Ostrogothic and Frankish kingdoms which led him to the constant ransoming of victims during these wars. The aftermath of war in 507/508 between the Burgundians and Franks and Visigothic and Ostrogothic kingdoms was devastating to its citizens. Peasants had no food supply and were in danger of enslavement, exile and death. Although Caesarius saved and ransomed many countryside citizens, his actions in redeeming captives was quite controversial. Although he ransomed many peasants of his country, he also ransomed numerous barbarians and enemies of the city. He defended himself by stating that barbarians were human beings and therefore had the potential to enter the City of God. A notary named Licinianus denounced Caesarius to Alaric II as one who desired to subjugate the civitas of Arles to Burgundian rule. Caesarius was exiled to Bordeaux, but on the discovery of his innocence, was speedily allowed to return. He interceded for the life of his calumniator. Later, when Arles was besieged by Theodoric around the year 512, he was again accused of treachery and imprisoned. An interview with the Ostrogothic king at Ravenna the next year speedily dispelled these troubles, and the remainder of his episcopate was passed in peace. Some rivalry appears to have existed in the sixth century between the sees of Arles and Vienne, but was adjusted by Pope Leo, whose adjustment was confirmed by Pope Symmachus. Caesarius was in favour at Rome. A book he wrote against the semi-Pelagians, entitled de Gratiâ et Libero Arbitrio, was sanctioned by Pope Felix IV; and the canons passed at Orange were approved by Pope Boniface II. The learned antiquary Louis Thomassin believed him to have been the first Western bishop who received a pall from the pope. François Guizot in Civilisation en France cites part of one of Caesarius' sermons as that of a representative man of his age; while August Neander eulogizes his \\"unwearied, active, and pious zeal, ready for every sacrifice in the spirit of love,\\" and his moderation on the controversy concerning semi-Pelagianism. However, throughout all this turmoil, unlike Boethius, another Christian philosopher of the 6th century, he was never charged with being a covert supporter of a revived Roman Empire. The old Roman political order seemed to have little significance to Caesarius who instead directed his attitude to reflecting and accepting Christian pragmatism. Religious beginnings  According to William Klingshirn, \\"Caesarius also has the reputation of being the faithful champion of Augustine of Hippo in the early middle ages. Thus Augustine's writings are seen to have profoundly shaped Caesarius' vision of human community, both inside and outside the cloister; and Caesarius' prowess as a popular preacher is understood to follow from his close attention to the example of the bishop of Hippo.Authority and Asceticism from Augustine to Gregory the Great, Conrad Leyser, 1 Caesarius was also highly influenced by his teacher, Julianus Pomerius. Pomerius had been inspired by the life of Augustine of Hippo too and insisted that bishops and members of the clergy live more like monks as opposed to aristocrats. This meant that any luxurious behaviour, such as participating in bountiful banquets, enlarging estates and enjoying “secular” learning, was condemned. Instead Pomerius urged bishops to give away all their riches and personal wealth as well as dress and eat simply. Caesarius's monasticism led him to the movement of church reform and he became one of its most influential spokesman.William Klingshirn, Caesarius of Arles: Life, Testaments, Letters (Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1994), xv According to many of his testaments he stayed true to the teachings of Pomerius and Augustine by rejecting secular learning, shunning comfortable living and organizing his clergy into monastic living. It is important to realize that Christianization in the late Roman and Early Medieval West was a slow, inconsistent and incomplete social and religious change. It required the building of churches, conversion of elites and a widespread adoption of Christian self-identity with a system of Christian values, practices and beliefs. The church was constantly struggling against the survival of superstitions and pagan practices that were widely common among communities and common folk.Rudolph, Arbesmann. \\"The \\"cervuli\\" and \\"anniculae\\" in Caesarius of Arles,\\" Traditio: Studies in Ancient and Medieval History, Thought, and Religion 35, (1979): 101 However, it was only with the consent and participation of local populations that these religious changes were able to take effect. Therefore, as Klingshirn so carefully puts it, this process was reciprocal. Although the elites and theologians implemented all of the goals and strategies, it was up to the peasants and townspeople of local communities to accept these practices. The directions of Caesarius for the conduct of monks and nuns have been censured as pedantic and minute, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. They certainly yielded to the spread of the rising Benedictine rule, but must be judged by their age and in the light of the whole spirit of monasticism. As a preacher, Caesarius displayed great knowledge of Scripture, and was eminently practical in his exhortations. Besides reproving ordinary vices of humanity, he had often to contend against lingering pagan practices, as auguries, or heathen rites on the calends. His sermons on the Old Testament are not critical, but dwell on its typical aspects. Several volumes of his sermons have been published in Sources Chrétiennes. Writings and teachings Caesarius has over 250 surviving sermons in his corpus. His sermons reveal him as a pastor dedicated to the formation of the clergy and the moral education of the laity. He preached on Christian beliefs, values, and practices against pagan syncretism. He emphasizes the life of a Christian as well as the love of God, reading the scriptures, asceticism, psalmody, love for one's neighbour, and the judgement that would come.DelCogliano, Caesarius, 20 Through Pomerius's teachings, it is logical to conclude that many of Caesarius' homilies and writings were influenced greatly by Augustine. Caesarius' writings were known to be adapted as he reworked many other philosophers' introductions and conclusions, especially those of Augustine.Alberto Ferreiro, \\"\\"Frequenter legere\\": the propagation of literacy, education, and Divine Wisdom in Caesarius of Arles,\\" Journal of Ecclesiastical History 43:1 (1992): 6 Many of his writings and sermons, including the popular Vita Caesarii, were ordered to be written in French, German, Italian, and Hispanic. Caesarius did not believe that his readings and sermons should be restricted to the clergy. He did not just address the upper class and elite but instead preached to many literate and near-literate bishops, abbots, parish priests, and monks. He encouraged the clergy to read to both themselves and others. He targeted the illiterate and ask that they hire others to read to them after church in order to absorb the divine lessons. Caesarius encouraged reading divine lessons both at church and in their homes, at night and during the day, alone and with family.Ferreiro, \\"Frequenter legere\\", 8 More than just learning and understanding the lessons, Caesarius emphasized that a “believer who does not share what he has learned, is not achieving what God intended\\".Ferreiro, Divine Wisdom in Caesarius of Arles, 12 Therefore, the believer is given a large responsibility as the lectio (divine reading) is God and therefore he should not be denied access to what belongs to Him. Caesarius believed that Christian People were God's new \\"elect\\" and he idealized incorporating men of places from all over the world into a believing, peaceful, and loving human community. This belief parallels Augustinian work as Augustine often referred to the populus christianus which can be translated as the Christian People. Revelation tells that God made a covenant with the populus christianus and the Christian epoch was predicted in all of the scriptures.Daly, Caesarius of Arles, 17 Scholars have remarked on two aspects of Caesarius's teaching and activity that deserve considerable attention. The first aspect deals with Caesarius who was stated to be “the creative leader who arranged at the Council of Orange in 529 a resolution of the century of disputes about grace and ‘good works’ which followed Augustine's death.^ Daly, Caesarius of Arles, 7 =Council of Orange, 529= The most important local council over which Caesarius presided was that of Orange (529). Its statements on the subject of grace and free agency have been eulogized by modern historians (see, e.g., Canon Bright, Church History, ch. xi. ad fin.). The following propositions are laid down in the Council of Orange's canon 25: :\\"This also do we believe, in accordance with the Catholic faith, that after grace received through baptism, all the baptized are able and ought, with the aid and co-operation of Christ, to fulfil all duties needful for salvation, provided they are willing to labour faithfully. But that some men have been predestinated to evil by divine power, we not only do not believe, but if there be those who are willing to believe so evil a thing, we say to them with all abhorrence anathema. This also do we profess and believe to our soul's health, that in every good work, it is not we who begin, and are afterwards assisted by Divine mercy, but that God Himself, with no preceding merits on our part, first inspires within us faith and love.\\" On the express ground that these doctrines are as needful for the laity as for the clergy, certain distinguished laymen (illustres ac magnifici viri) were invited to sign these canons. They are accordingly subscribed by eight laymen, and at least twelve bishops, including Caesarius. Provincial council, probably representing the condemnation of the bishop Contumeliosus, sixth from the left The Council of Orange in 529 was said to have condemned \\"the teaching of grace that predominated in southern Gaul in favor of a modified Augustinian position.\\"Mark DelCogliano, \\"Caesarius of Arles: On living in the community,\\" Cistercian Studies Quarterly 41:1, (2006): 19 =Sermons= The second aspect of Caesarius's teaching that deserves attention is his sermons. As mentioned previously, his corpus consists of over 250 surviving sermons.^ Caesarius of Arles Sermons Translated by Mary Magdalene Mueller, Catholic University of America Press (1964) Caesarius was determined to edit, shorten, and simplify his sermons in order to make them more effective and available to the existing patristic tradition. About 1/3 of his sermons are efforts of this sort. His works travelled to all parts of the Christian West, spreading his medieval sermon tradition and its topics of Christian love, the meaning of the last Judgment, the rights of the poor and the notion of Christianity. His writings were used by monks in Germany, repeated in Anglo-Saxon poetry and turned up in the important works of Gatianus of Tours and Thomas Aquinas.^ Daly, Caesarius of Arles, 9 In DelCogliano's article, he mentions two other historians who studied and presented new critical texts of Caesarius's sermons. The two historians, Courreau and Vogüé, noted that although Caesarius's monastic sermons contain their own perspective and emphasis, his teachings are largely consistent throughout all of his sermons. Certain recurring themes include the expectations of monks in the monastery (i.e., important to attain Christian salvation within the safe haven of a monastery with the help of God) as well as being assisted on this Christian journey by fellow brothers who must offer mutual support. Caesarius, unlike other monks like Anthony the Great, did not believe in solitude in order to be blessed with the Grace of God; instead he emphasized brothers living amongst each other and providing edification and a good example to one another. =Work for women= Caesarius’ Regula virginum (512), also known as the Rule for Virgins, is the first western rule written exclusively for women. In this text, Caesarius argues for the practice of claustration, the complete containment of women in the monastery from their entry until death. Caesarius also created a strict regime for women in the monasteries to adhere to, specifying times for prayer, limits on earthly luxuries such as fine clothes and elaborate decoration, and standards of modesty and piety. Caesarius begins the \\"Rule\\" by prefacing that the virgins for which he was writing this rule were the \\"gems of the Church\\" as they, \\"with God's help, evade the jaws of spiritual wolves.\\"The Rule for Nuns of St. Caesarius of Arles, 222. He also composed a letter of guidance, Vereor, for the women of his religious community in its early stages.Lindsay Rudge, \\"Texts and Contexts: Women's Dedicated Life From Caesarius to Benedict\\" (PhD., University of St. Andrew, 2006) As mentioned earlier, Caesarius was captured and later returned from Bordeaux. After he returned he began to build a monastery for women outside of Arles. The monastery was built for a group of ascetic women living under the spiritual direction of his sister, Caesaria.Klingshirn, \\"Caesarius of Arles\\", 105 It can be assumed that most of the women entering the monastery were from elite families, as there were strict provisions in \\"Regula Virginum\\" against having servants, luxurious clothes, and excessive decoration. There had been no monastery for women in Arles which allowed Caesarius, possibly in the imitation of Augustine, to provide women with an equal opportunity for a monastic life. Caesarius viewed the women in the monastery as having a religious advantage in being separated from the anxieties and responsibilities of daily life in the city, as they were able to devote themselves to a life of piety: “And therefore I ask you, oh sacred virgins and souls dedicated to God, who with you lamps shining await with clear conscience the coming of the Lord, that, because you know that I labored to establish a monastery for you, you with your prayers might ask that I be made a companion on your journey; and that, when you shall enter joyfully into the kingdom with the wise and holy virgins, you might obtain by your plea that I not remain outside with the foolish ones.” \\"The Rule for Nuns of St. Caesarius of Arles\\", 221 It was Caesarius's goal to attain security of his place both among the Church elites of Gaul as well as in heaven through the creation of the monastery. By creating the monastery and writing the Rule, Caesarius was able to make for himself a place among the great Church thinkers of Late Antique Gaul. Simultaneously, through the intercession of the women in the monastery praying for him, Caesarius believed he could confirm his place in heaven after death. Influence 19th-century reliquary of St Caesarius, Church of St. Trophime in Arles As the occupant of an important see, the bishop of Arles exercised considerable official, as well as personal, influence. Caesarius was liberal in the loan of sermons, and sent suggestions for discourses to priests and even bishops living in Spain, Italy, and elsewhere in Gaul. The great doctrinal question of his age and country was that of semi-Pelagianism. Caesarius, though evidently a disciple of Augustine, displayed in this respect considerable independence of thought. His vigorous denial of anything like predestination to evil has caused a difference in the honour paid to his memory, according as writers incline respectively towards the Jesuit or Jansenist views concerning divine grace. In Daly's article on Caesarius of Arles, he suggested that Caesarius in many ways may have anticipated the medieval notion of Christendom. His concern for others, redemption of captives and establishing bonds of peace, have been seen as a function of ‘his basic theology of love’. Unlike Augustine, who was a supporter and founder of the theology of Christian love, Caesarius stressed the clarification and integration of implications for spiritual activism. Caesarius promoted that God put the exercise of love in every man's reach. Klingshirn backs up this statement in his article when he describes how Caesarius was concerned with the barbarians and enemies of Arles as they were still within the City of God and therefore deserved redemption. According to the previously mentioned scholars and historians who have written on Caesarius such as Arbesmann, Daly, DelCogliano, Ferreiro and Klingshirn, Caesarius lived through an era full of many societal shifts. Historians have stated that Caesarius was caught up in its early stages and lacked historical “hindsight and perspective” to this era. However, he witnessed and understood the beginning of the vast societal shifts which surrounded him and intentionally set out to shape this process. This was an influential stance as it has been said that the displacement of Roman by European civilization was a long- lasting, complex, and mystifying processKlingshirn, \\"Caesarius of Arles\\", xvi Caesarius dreamed and saw an “expanding, world-embracing, world-uniting society”.Daly, Life, Testaments, Letters, 26 Caesarius emphasized and spread his treatise and beliefs of patristic tradition to men and women around Arles and surrounding cities. This recognizable social model occurred in a time where social communities were disappearing. Caesarius helped to foresee the institutional shapes of medieval Christendom and may have helped create it with his ideas circulating for a millennium in the medieval West.Daly, Caesarius of Arles, 28  Sources  Saint's Life: * Life of Caesarius of Arles (VIta Caesarii Arelatensis), by Bishop Cyprian of Toulon and others, ed. by Bruno Krusch, Monumenta Germaniae Historica, vol. 3, Hannover: Hahn 1896, pp. 433-501, English translation by William Klingshirn, Caesarius of Arles: Life, Testament, Letters, Liverpool: Liverpool University Press 1994 (Translated Texts for Historians, vol. 19), pp. 1–70.

The collective was first documented by Western journalists in the early 1950s, and was brought to widespread international attention by Brian Jones in 1969. They have collaborated with many Western rock and jazz musicians. The collective includes more than 50 musicians from the village of Jajouka (sometimes spelled as Joujouka or Zahjouka), in the Rif Mountains of northern Morocco. All members are the sons of previous members, and adopt the surname Attar (\\"perfume maker\\"). In the 1990s, the collective split into two factions, with the other currently known as The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar. History The Master Musicians of Joujouka perform a variety of Sufi music that is believed to be more than one thousand years old. The collective became an item of interest for members of the Beat Generation in the 1950s, when Moroccan folklorist Mohamed Hamri informed European colleagues about the group's music. Hamri operated a restaurant in Tangier that was frequented by European musicians and artists, and the Master Musicians often played there. Brion Gysin, Paul Bowles, and William S. Burroughs all wrote about the group and one of them may have coined the name \\"The Master Musicians of Joujouka\\" during this period. Timothy Leary famously, but erroneously, described the group and its music as \\"4000 years old\\", which has been repeated in many sources. The figure actually applies to previous Sufi traditions and not to the group or its music specifically. Brian Jones visited the collective many times while traveling in Morocco and in 1969 became the first Western musician to record with them. The album Brian Jones Presents the Pipes of Pan at Joujouka was released in 1971 after Jones's death. The collective played on the 1973 album Dancing in Your Head by Ornette Coleman. Arnold Stahl oversaw recording of the double album Tribe Ahl Serif: Master Musicians of Jajouka in 1974. In the early 1990s, the collective split into two factions, as first reported by visiting musician Lee Ranaldo. The faction fostered by Mohamed Hamri, and led by Ahmed Attar, retained the name \\"The Master Musicians of Joujouka\\". Meanwhile, another faction led by Bachir Attar, whose father had led the group during the Brian Jones period, took on the name \\"The Master Musicians of Jajouka led by Bachir Attar\\". The second group attracted protests at concerts in the United Kingdom, and international journalists noted that the schism created discord in the collective's home village. Other journalists and fans conceded that both groups were working to preserve their ancient musical heritage. The collective retaining the original name, and led by Ahmed Attar, resumed recording in the 1990s, releasing the album Joujouka Black Eyes in 1995. They appeared on the various-artists albums Sufi: Moroccan Trance II in 1996 and 10%: File under Burroughs (a tribute to early supporter William S. Burroughs) the same year. Their most recent studio album is Boujeloud, released in 2006. In 2011 they made a guest appearance on the album The Great Escape Artist by Jane's Addiction.\\"Jane's Addiction Collaborates With Master Musicians Of Joujouka\\"http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/jane-s-addiction-collaborates-with- master-musicians-of-joujouka/\\"Jane's Addiction, \\"End To The Lies\\"\\", Billboard, 22 April 2011, http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1067821/janes- addiction-end-to-the-lies The group frequently appears at music festivals in Europe,\\"Glastonbury 2011 live: Friday 24 June\\", The Guardian, https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/24/glastonbury-2011-live- fridayOndine Benetier, \\"On y était : le festival Villa Aperta 2013 à Rome\\", Les InRocks, 10 June 2013, http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/06/10/musique/concerts/on-y-etait-le-festival- villa-aperta-2013-a-rome-11401585/Eric Delhaye,\\"Récit Au Maroc, le village de Jajouka abrite le plus vieux groupe de rock du monde\\", Telerama, 12 September 2016, http://www.telerama.fr/sortir/au-maroc-le-village-de-jajouka-abrite-le- plus-vieux-groupe-de-rock-du-monde,147163.php and made an acclaimed live appearance at the BBC Radio 4, hosted by Jarvis Cocker, in 2017.Jarvis Cocker, Joujouka, Series 5 Episode 1, Wireless Nights, BBC Radio 4, first broadcast 13 March 2017, podcast, http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08hmd23.

MacKinnon in Guelph, Ontario. The company's business output consisted of role-playing games (RPGs). Their first game is the anime inspired Big Eyes, Small Mouth. In 2006 Guardians of Order ceased operations due to overwhelming debt.  Products  The Big Eyes, Small Mouth game used the Tri-Stat System. The system would later be modified for use in other games and be more generally named the Tri-Stat dX system. Most of Guardians of Order's games use some form of the Tri-Stat dX system. After Big Eyes, Small Mouth, Guardians of Order would go on to achieve significant success with the Sailor Moon Role-playing Game and Resource Book. The game was built on Big Eyes, Small Mouth but featured an extensive reference to the Sailor Moon universe. Guardians of Order acquired licenses and published Big Eyes, Small Mouth-based RPGs for a number of other anime series including Dominion, Demon City Shinjuku, and Tenchi Muyo!. After El Hazard, the last such game, the company's strategy with licensed anime series changed and it began issuing \\"Ultimate Fan Guides\\" which served the same purpose while avoiding the need to reprint the same BESM-based mechanics. All of these books included game statistics for characters in the series as well as extensive episode guides and character summaries. Guardians of Order expanded beyond anime based games when the Tri-Stat dX system was adopted for the superhero game Silver Age Sentinels. Guardians of Order later acquired the rights to publish the Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game from Phage Press. Guardians of Order licensed the rights to produce role-playing games set in existing fictional works. These include games based on The Authority, Tékumel, and A Song of Ice and Fire. History Mark C. MacKinnon created the company Guardians of Order to publish his anime game, Big Eyes, Small Mouth (1997). Guardians of Order was founded by Mark C. MacKinnon in 1996. In 1998, Guardians of Order hired David Pulver. In 1999, Jeff Mackintosh was hired; and 2000 brought in Liz Fulda and Lucien Soulban. In 2002, Guardians of Order launched their \\"Magnum Opus\\" program, licensing the company's intellectual property to third parties to create new games. By 2005, Guardians of Order downsized to just Mark C. MacKinnon. Between February 14, 2006 and August 1, 2006 there were no official updates to the Guardians of Order website. There was speculation on the official forums that the company was out of business. On July 28, 2006 a post to George R. R. Martin's official web site announced that Guardians of Order was out of business. In response, on August 1 Mark MacKinnon posted confirmation that Guardians of Order \\"ceased operations.\\" According to MacKinnon the company had too much debt. MacKinnon attempted to place Guardians of Orders games with other companies, and promised that existing orders would be filled. The company officially closed their doors August 1, 2006. On September 9, 2006 ArtHaus Games, whose titles are published by White Wolf Publishing, announced that it had acquired the third edition of Big Eyes, Small Mouth which was slated to be released in April 2006. The announcement stated the company was \\"extremely confident\\" that a release date of January 2007 would be met and confirmed that those who pre-ordered and prepaid for the book would be \\"in good hands,\\" though it was also said that they have not taken on Guardians of Order's liabilities. On March 7, 2007 George R. R. Martin wrote that he had regained control of his intellectual property rights and was \\"all square\\" with Guardians of Order. As part of their settlement, Mr. Martin received all remaining stock of the limited edition version of the RPG.

According to him, both love and hate, materialism and spirituality, egotism and generosity exist only due to our limited perception of Reality. However, he divided them into illusions that further bind us (avidyamaya) and illusions that take us further onto the dispelling of maya (vidyamaya). According to his Hindu school of thought, as one cannot trust one's eyes before a trained magician, also the human five senses draw and drag us further into illusions and false conclusions. However, the embracing and realization of some concepts that are not sensual (i.e., of the senses), such as love, generosity, spirituality, all of them vidyamaya, take us further away from sticking to what we see, touch, smell, hear, taste.

As such, it is not a denomination, but rather an organization that provides resources, support, and interagency communication. Organizations/agencies considered to share Mainstream Baptists and cooperate with and support the network are listed below under External links. Historic Baptist beliefs of Mainstream BaptistsBaptist Beliefs =Lordship of Christ= *The heart of Baptist beliefs is the Lordship of Christ. *Christ is Lord over the individual believer, he is Lord over the church, and he is Lord over the universe and all that is in it. *Jesus Christ is the final authority in our individual lives, in our homes, in our churches, and in all our relationships with society and the world. *Our ultimate loyalty and allegiance is to God's Person, rather than to books, creeds, confessions, traditions, programs or procedures. =Salvation by Grace Through Faith= *\\"For by grace have you been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, that no one should boast\\". *Baptists believe that God's love and grace is the only basis for any person's relationship with God. The individual can do nothing to earn or deserve God's love and forgiveness. Faith is not an effort or labor. *Faith is receiving God's love with an open heart and finding it transformed by God's grace. =Believer's Baptism= *Baptists baptize persons only after they make a personal confession of their faith in Christ. *Baptists do not believe that a loving God condemns anyone for a sin they did not commit. Baptists do not view baptism as a remedy for original sin. Baptists do not baptize infants. *Baptists practice baptism by totally immersing persons in water, rather than by sprinkling, pouring, or anointing persons with water. *Baptism by immersion preserves the dramatic imagery of the meaning of baptism as a symbolic death, burial and resurrection. The symbolism of baptism pictures: the death, burial and resurrection of Christ who died for our sins and the believer's own death to sin, burial of a sinful nature, and resurrection to a new life in Christ. =Priesthood of All Believers and Liberty of Conscience= *Baptists believe that all members are equal under God in the fellowship of the church. Jesus is the one mediator between God and humanity. Every human being has direct access to God through Christ. *Every Christian is her or his own priest in that he or she is authorized to go directly to God for forgiveness of sins and to search the scriptures with confidence of being guided by the same Spirit that inspired those who wrote the Bible. *Every Christian is a priest to others in that he or she is a member of a royal priesthood and responsible to Christ for ministering to others. =Religious Liberty and the Separation of Church and State= *\\"Religious Liberty is the nursing mother of all liberty. Without it all other forms of liberty must soon wither and die. The Baptists grasped this conception of liberty in its full-orbed glory, from the very beginning. Their contention has been, is now, and must ever be, that it is the God-given and indefeasible right of every human being, to worship God or not, according to the dictates of his conscience; and, as long as he does not infringe on the rights of others, he is to be held accountable to God alone, for all his religious beliefs and practices.\\" —George W. TruettDr. Truett was pastor of First Baptist Church of Dallas, TX 1897-1944, president of the Southern Baptist Convention 1927-1929, and president of the Baptist World Alliance 1934-1935. The quotation is from Truett's famous sermon, \\"Baptists and Religious Liberty,\\" preached on May 16, 1920 to 15,000 people from the steps of the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C. =Mainstream Baptists and the Bible= *The Bible from a Mainstream Perspective. No human understanding of the Bible can be so exhaustive and authoritative as to merit use as an “instrument of doctrinal accountability.” Mainstream Baptists think it more prudent to leave every believer free to interpret the Bible according to the dictates of a conscience that is guided by the Holy Spirit. *Though Mainstream Baptists insist on thinking for themselves, there is a broad consensus among them concerning the scriptures. *Mainstream Baptists love and respect the Bible. It is a holy book in that it holds a separate and unique place. It is the story of God's love. Each of us is part of that story. By identifying with this story, our lives receive meaning and direction. *While Baptists love and respect the Bible, they do not worship it. The Bible is the written word of God. In and of itself it is paper and ink, words and sentences, and has no life. The Bible is not the supreme revelation of God—It points to and must be fulfilled and completed by God's Living Word, Jesus Christ. As the only mediator between God and a person, he gives scriptures life by creating from them a spark of understanding in the individual. From that understanding He calls us to a personal relationship with Him. Those who respond in faith to God's call, identify with His story and commit themselves to a life of discipleship. For them, the Bible becomes more than a reliable record of God's revelation in the past. It is the authoritative tradition from which we view the horizons of life in both time and eternity. *Baptists believe in the divine inspiration and human authorship of the Bible.Further details are posted at http://www.mainstreambaptists.org/mbn/mainstream_&_bible.htm =Congregational Autonomy= *Mainstream Baptists believe in congregational autonomy which means that every local congregation is under the direct Lordship of Christ. They are opposed to ecclesiastical hierarchies. Their churches are not subordinate to the rule of any denomination, convention, association, fellowship or any other religious body. They believe that Christ is in and is the head of every congregation of his people. *Their churches operate democratically because they believe every other form of church government infringes on the Lordship of Christ. Every member is responsible for seeking and following the guidance of the Holy Spirit as they participate in the deliberations and work of the church. Each member has equal right to voice their convictions and to vote according to their conscience when the congregation makes decisions. They trust the spiritual discernment of the majority and act on it. They also realize that majorities can be mistaken and act with respect toward the consciences of a sometimes-prophetic minority. =Cooperative Missions= *Mainstream Baptists are committed to extending the good news about what God has done in Christ to all the world. They believe that every Christian is a missionary. *They believe that calls some persons to devote their lives to special ministries. Recognizing that the needs of the world are great, they cooperate and partner with other Christians and churches to support vocational missionaries with their prayers, their encouragement, their labors, and their financial assistance.

The title was derived from a catchphrase associated with the show. Directed by Melville W. Brown, from a screenplay by Bert Kalmar, J. Walter Ruben, and Harry Ruby, it starred Charles Correll and Freeman Gosden, in blackface, in the roles of Andy and Amos, respectively, which they had created for the radio show. The film also featured Duke Ellington and his \\"Cotton Club Band\\". Plot Amos and Andy run the \\"Fresh Air Taxicab Company, Incorporated\\", so named because their one taxi has no top. Their old vehicle has broken down, causing a traffic jam. Stuck in the traffic jam are John Blair and his wife, who were on their way to meet an old family friend at the train station, Richard Williams. When the Blairs do not show up, he makes his own way to their house, where he meets their daughter, Jean, who was also his childhood sweetheart. The two reignite their old flame, much to the chagrin of Ralph Crawford, who has been attempting to woo Jean himself. That night, prior to attending a meeting at their lodge, the Mystic Knights of the Sea, they are hired to transport Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club band to a party being given at the Blair estate. While they are on their way, Richard is confiding to John Blair his feelings for his daughter, and also stating that he has no intention of pursuing Jean unless he can afford to start his own business to support them. After the death of his father, Richard's family lost all their money. He has come up to New York because his grandfather used to own a large home in Harlem, and he hopes to be able to find the deed to it, in order to sell it for the money needed to start his business. He thinks the deed must be hidden somewhere on the property itself. Unknown to Blair or Richard, is that Ralph is eavesdropping on their conversation. After his discussion with Blair, Richard runs into Amos and Andy, who used to work for his father down south, and they are all happy to see one another. Having delivered their fare, the two cab drivers rush back to town to attend their lodge meeting. The lodge has an annual tradition where a pair of members must spend a night in a haunted house in Harlem, and find a document labeled, \\"Check and Double Check\\". Once they find it, they are to replace it, in a different location, with their own version, for the lodge members to find the following year. The haunted house in question in none other than the house previously owned by Richard's grandfather. As Amos and Andy are searching for their document, Ralph is also in the house with several of his cohorts, searching for the deed, in order to thwart Richard's chances with Jean. Amos and Andy find their document, but then realize they did not bring any other paper to write their message on and secrete for their lodge brothers. In searching for something to write on, they stumble on the deed to premises. As they are about to write their message on the back, they are interrupted by Ralph and his friends, who believe that the two have found the deed. In the confusion which ensues, the cab drivers hand over what everyone believes is the deed, before they scamper out of the building. However, when they return to the lodge, they realize that they had given the Check and Double Check paper to Ralph, instead of the deed. They do not know the importance of the document they have, but they recognized Richard's grandfather's signature on it, and intend to deliver it to Richard the following day. After failing to find the deed, a heartbroken Richard leaves for the railway station, intending to return home. Amos and Andy arrive at the Blair house too late to give him the deed, but race to the station and are able to hand over the deed just before Richard's train leaves. Now with the deed, Richard can sell the house, open his business, and marry Jean. Cast * Freeman F. Gosden as Amos * Charles J.

Perhaps foremost was the fact that the characters of the program were portrayed as blacks but were in fact entirely voiced by whites. This had posed no problem on the radio, but obviously would not be suitable for a film where the actors could be seen as well as heard. Rather than hire black actors for the roles and instruct them to imitate to the maximum extent possible the very stereotypical voices used by the radio performers, program creators Freeman Gosden and Charles Correll performed the roles themselves in blackface. Another problem was the attempt to base a full-length picture on a 15-minute- long radio program. In order to do this, the film's producers decided to flesh out the story with a love triangle involving white characters, essentially making Amos and Andy minor characters in what was marketed as a film about them. =Music= Duke Ellington and his band were invited to be a part of the film, not just to provide the music but also to appear performing in the film itself. This helped propel Ellington into a national spotlight. The director did not want to give audiences the impression that Ellington's band was racially integrated, and was worried that two band members were too light skinned. So valve trombonist Juan Tizol, who was Puerto Rican, and clarinetist Barney Bigard, a Creole, wore stage makeup to appear as dark as Amos and Andy on film. The songs included: *\\"Three Little Words\\" - Music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band, vocals by The Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris, and Al Rinker) (band members lip synched to the Rhythm Boys vocals) *\\"Nobody Knows But the Lord\\" - Music by Harry Ruby, lyrics by Bert Kalmar; sung by lodge brothers *\\"Ring Dem Bells\\" - Written by Duke Ellington; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band *\\"Old Man Blues\\" - Written by Duke Ellington and Irving Mills; performed by Duke Ellington and His Cotton Club Band *\\"East St. Louis Toodle-O\\" - Written by James \\"Bubber\\" Miley and Duke Ellington *\\"Am I Blue?\\" - Music by Harry Akst, lyrics by Grant Clarke; partially sung by Freeman F. Gosden *\\"The Perfect Song\\" - Words and music by Joseph Carl Breil; theme from the Amos and Andy radio program Response The film was very profitable for RKO, earning a profit of $260,000. However, RKO examined ticket sale patterns and determined that the film's success was due to the curiosity factor of the audience wanting to see the black-face performances of their two radio stars, but once seen, the novelty was worn off. Variety called it \\"the best picture for children ever put on the screen\\". Mordaunt Hall, film critic for The New York Times, gave the film a lackluster review, praising the efforts of Gosden and Correll, while not being as kind to the rest of the cast. Two animated short films were made following Check and Double Check: The Rasslin' Match and The Lion Tamer. However, no sequel was ever produced and there were no further attempts at live-action portrayals of Amos 'n' Andy until the CBS television show which ran from 1951-53, although the radio show continued to be a top- rated program throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Notes In 1958, the film entered the public domain in the United States because the claimants did not renew its copyright registration in the 28th year after publication. See Note #60, pg. 143 The Rhythm Boys (Bing Crosby, Harry Barris, and Al Rinker), were brought in at the last minute to sing the vocals on \\"Three Little Words\\", when Ellington's drummer, Sonny Greer, got stage fright about performing on film. After Greer couldn't get over his fright, Bing Crosby was supposed to sing the song solo, but when Melville Brown, the director, heard Crosby's version, he reportedly said, \\"This guy can't sing\\", and the entire trio was brought in to record the song.

It is one of six squares designed by the founder of Adelaide, Colonel William Light, who was Surveyor-General at the time, in his 1837 plan of the City of Adelaide which spanned the River Torrens Valley, comprising the city centre (South Adelaide) and North Adelaide. The square was named on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee after Princess Victoria, then heir presumptive of the British throne, and in 2003 assigned a second name in the language of the original inhabitants, Kaurna, Tarndanyangga (later changed to Tarntanyangga), as part of the dual naming initiative by the Adelaide City Council. The square has been upgraded and modified several times through its lifetime. During the Christmas period, it is traditional for a high Christmas tree to be erected in the northern part of the square. Dual naming and significance The square was first named \\"Victoria Square\\" on 23 May 1837 by the Street Naming Committee, in honour of the then Princess Victoria. Aboriginal flag in Victoria Square, February 2003. In line with the Adelaide City Council's recognition of Kaurna country, the square was officially referred to as Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga from 2002, modified to Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga City of Adelaide > Victoria Square - Tarntanyangga Retrieved 7 July 2017. by 2013, when Stage 1 of a major upgrade was done. The names \\"Tarndanya\\", sometimes recorded as \\"Dharnda anya\\" (or variant spelling) by colonial sources means \\"red kangaroo rock\\" and was reportedly the name used by the Kaurna people for \\"the site of South Adelaide\\" or the central-South Adelaide area; the local people whose central camp had been \\"in or near Victoria Square\\" were called the \\"Dundagunya tribe\\" by colonial sources. Kaurna Warra Pintyanthi > Tarndanyangga, 'red kangaroo dreaming' Retrieved 7 July 2017. Tarndanyangga/Tarntanyangga is derived from the Kaurna word for \\"red kangaroo\\" – tarnta (tarnda) – and that for \\"rock\\" – kanya. The ending \\"-ngga\\" means it's a location, implying \\"in, at or on\\", which is often used in Kaurna place names. Many quarries were built on the southern bank of the Torrens, and Tarnta Kanya probably referred to one or more rock formations which were quarried, providing much of the stone for the large early buildings on North Terrace. Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga is still considered an important meeting place for Aboriginal Australians. It is the focus for many political and community-based Indigenous events, such as the National Sorry Day commemoration held by Journey of Healing (SA) on 26 May each year. Each year during NAIDOC Week in July, there is a \\"family fun day\\" held at the square and a march to Parliament House. The Australian Aboriginal Flag was flown at Victoria Square for the first time in the country at a land rights rally in Victoria Square in Adelaide on 9 July 1971. On 8 July 2002 the Adelaide City Council endorsed the permanent flying of the flag, which now flies adjacent to the Australian flag. Description Victoria Square is in the centre of the city's grid plan, designed by William Light. It is bordered by numerous public institutions at its north and south ends, including the Supreme Court of South Australia, the Adelaide Magistrates' Court, the Federal Court of Australia, the historic old Treasury building (now a hotel run by the Adina hotel chain) and the former Adelaide General Post Office. On the eastern side is the Roman Catholic Cathedral Church of St Francis Xavier, the SA Water headquarters, State Government offices, including the office of the Premier, and the Torrens Building, which houses the Carnegie Mellon University. The west side of the square contains more commercially-oriented buildings, including an entrance to the Adelaide Central Market, the Hilton hotel, and the offices of various consultants, law firms and insurance companies. King William Street passes through the centre of the square from north to south, creating a diamond shape, with the southbound carriageway passing through the east side, and the northbound carriageway passing through the west side of the square. The square is bisected on its east-west axis by the section of road (technically part of the square) that connects Wakefield Street (entering from the east) with Grote Street (to the west). A tram stop (formerly the terminus) for the Glenelg tram line is just south of the Queen Victoria statue; it was shifted from the centre to the western edge of the square in 2007, as part of the extension that was made to the tram line around that time. History Statue of Queen Victoria (pictured pre-2007), erected in the centre of the square in 1894 The link between the Aboriginal people and the square, as a centre for the surrounding area, stretches back many centuries, to a time when Tarndanya (Red Kangaroo Dreaming) people gathered there for special ceremonies and dances. Tarndanyangga was the \\"headquarters\\" or central camp of the \\"Dundagunya tribe\\", a community numbering in the thousands.Adelaide Botanic Gardens Conservation Study - 5.0 Assessment of Cultural Significance DEWNR, 2006.

Retrieved 13 September 2014. During the 1960s the Aboriginal community renewed its activities in Victoria Square, with the area in front of what was then the central Police Station, (and is now the Commonwealth Law Courts building), becoming a social and gathering point. =19th century= Ceremony to mark the unveiling of the statue of Queen Victoria in Victoria Square on 11 August 1894. In 1837, the first Surveyor General of South Australia, Colonel William Light, mapped a plan for the City of Adelaide. The design incorporated a central square to function as Adelaide's focal point and provide open space for recreational activities. On his first map, Light called the precinct \\"The Great Square\\". It was eventually named in honour of Princess Victoria, then heir to the throne of England. The square was a dusty, treeless paddock until 1854, when the Adelaide City Council embarked on a planting program, constructed four broad diagonal pedestrian paths and erected a wooden fence. The landscaping work was designed by George William Francis, later the first director of the Adelaide Botanic Garden. Other work on the square included construction of an east-west roadway that created two garden areas. A fountain was also considered, but it took a further 100 years for this idea to come to fruition. By 1883, plans were under way to extend King William Street directly through Victoria Square, dividing it into four garden areas. The original wooden fence was replaced by ornate iron railings. A statue of Queen Victoria – who had ascended to the throne in June 1837 – was erected in the centre of the square in 1894. =20th century= The statue of Colonel Light, now known as Light's Vision and since 1938 situated on Montefiore Hill, was unveiled on 27 November 1906 in its original location at the northern end of Victoria Square. The original tram terminus was located outside the Charles Moore & Co. department store with services operating via a loop in an anti-clockwise direction in the south- western corner. As part of the rebuilding of the square, in December 1966 the tram terminus was relocated near the centre of the square with Grote and Wakefield Streets to the north and Gouger and Angas Streets to the south.New Tram Terminus in Victoria Square Among Ourselves issue 124 October 1966 pages 8/9New Adelaide Tram Terminus Opened Electric Traction January 1967 page 7 The layout remained unchanged until 1967 when the square assumed its present diamond form.http://www.abc.net.au/local/photos/2014/05/21/4008917.htm The Three Rivers Fountain by John Dowie was built to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, in 1968. The three South Australian rivers, the Murray, Onkaparinga and Torrens, are represented by an Aboriginal male with an Ibis, a female with a heron, and a female with a black swan. On 12 July 1971, the red, black and yellow Aboriginal flag designed by Harold Thomas was flown for the first time – in Victoria Square. It now flies permanently alongside the Australian flag on one of the two tall flagpoles in the centre of the square. =21st century= In 2002, the Adelaide City Council formally recognised the areas heritage by bestowing the dual name Victoria Square/Tarndanyangga. The old tram depot at the Square was also demolished,http://www.trammuseumadelaide.com/413634112 so was the old SAPOL Headquarters. An SA Water office building was built in its place. In 2012 the Adelaide City Council endorsed $24 million in funding to begin rejuvenating Victoria Square.

B. Birch, unveiled in 1894.The statue was from an improved model Birch created for an Indian prince variously cited as the Maharajah of Oodeypore, Dodeypore, and Bulrampore (yet to be identified), unveiled by Prince Albert Victor in 1889. The statue was presented to the city by Sir Edwin Smith, based on a design viewed in England in 1893. It was cast by Moore & Co. of Thames Ditton using bronze specifically made from Wallaroo and Moonta copper. Inscribed simply with \\"Victoria R.I.\\", the statue was originally unveiled by Lady Smith on 11 August 1894. The statue was symbolically draped in black as a sign of mourning following the death of Queen Victoria in 1901. For many years a wreath laying ceremony was held at the foot of the statue each 24 May (or 23rd when the 24th was a Saturday), the anniversary of her birth in 1819. It was removed, cleaned and polished in May 2013 as part of the upgrade of Victoria Square and returned in December 2013 in a modified location. = Three Rivers Fountain = Originally located at the northern end of the square in 1968, the Three Rivers Fountain was later relocated to the southern end, and was officially reopened by then Lord Mayor, Stephen Yarwood, in July 2014. The fountain was erected to commemorate the visit of Queen Elizabeth II to Adelaide in February 1963. It was first set in operation by the Duke of Edinburgh on 28 May 1968. Sculptured by John Dowie, the centrepiece in the shape of a crown represents the royal visit, and the fountain represents the three rivers that Adelaide draws water from: * The Murray (depicted by an Aboriginal man and an ibis) * The Torrens (depicted by a woman and a black swan) * The Onkaparinga (depicted by a woman and a heron) = The State Survey Mark = Located at the northern end of the square, the State Survey Mark commemorates the placing of the first peg for the survey of the City of Adelaide by Colonel Light on 11 January 1837. This survey mark is the reference point for all other survey marks in South Australia. The mark was unveiled, along with a commemorative plaque by then Minister of Lands, Susan Lenehan on 21 April 1989. = Reconciliation Plaza = The east-west road connecting Grote and Wakefield Streets was named Reconciliation Plaza in 2013. The plaza hosts two flagpoles flying the Australian National Flag and the Aboriginal Flag, which has flown permanently in the square since 2002. In 1971, the square was the first place the Aboriginal Flag was flown, at a land rights rally. (See Dual naming, above.) Reconciliation Plaza was officially opened on 26 May 2014 by Mayor Yarwood, Reconciliation Committee Chairperson Yvonne Agius and Journey of Healing SA Chairperson John Browne. =Statue of Charles Kingston= A statue of Charles Kingston, son of George Strickland Kingston and SA premier from 1893 to 1899, stands in the square with a plaque reading \\"patriot and statesman\\". British sculptor Alfred Drury was commissioned to create the statue, and it was placed in a central location on the northwestern side, facing down Grote Street towards his West Adelaide electorate. It was unveiled on 26 May 1916, during World War I. It was later criticised as capturing \\"little of his fire\\". While Kingston was instrumental in bringing about several progressive social policies, such as electoral reform (including the first law to give votes to women in Australia), a legitimation Act, the first conciliation and arbitration act in Australia, and a progressive system of taxation, he was also one of the main architects of the White Australia policy. After the Black Lives Matter gained pace in June 2020, with various statues representing slave traders and various perpetrators of racism being removed or defaced both in the US and in the UK during the George Floyd protests, archaeologist and historian Jacinta Koolmatrie pointed out the irony of the statue being placed so close to the Aboriginal flag in the square, which was also the site of the Adelaide Black Lives Matter protest.

Bidhan Roy is often considered the Maker of Modern West Bengal due to his key role in the founding of several institutions and five eminent cities, Durgapur, Kalyani, Bidhannagar, Ashokenagar and Habra. He is one of the few people in history to have obtained F.R.C.S. and M.R.C.P. degrees simultaneously. In India, the National Doctors' Day is celebrated in his memory every year on 1 July. He was awarded Bharat Ratna on 4 February 1961, India's highest civilian honour.Dr Bidhan Chandra Roy: Vision for young India – The 15 'Gods' India draws inspiration from . News.in.msn.com (20 November 2009). Retrieved on 9 October 2013. Family history Bidhan Chandra Roy's grandfather Prankali Roy was an employee of Baharampur collectorate in Murshidabad district, West Bengal. Thus his father Prakash Chandra Roy was born in the year of 1847 at Baharampur, Murshidabad district in present-day West Bengal, India. Bidhan Chandra Roy's mother Aghorkamimi Devi was the daughter of a Zamindar of Baharampur named Bipin Chandra Bosu. Early life and education Bidhan Chandra Roy was born to a Bengali baidya family on 1 July 1882 at Bankipore, Patna, Bihar, where his father, Prakash Chandra Roy, was working as an excise inspector. His mother, Aghore Kamini Devi, was a pious lady and a devoted social worker. Bidhan was the youngest of five siblings – he had 2 sisters, Susharbashini and Sarojini, and 2 brothers, Subodh and Sadhan. Bidhan's parents were ardent Brahmo Samajists, led an austere and disciplined life, and devoted their time and money to the service of everyone in need, irrespective of caste or creed. Prakash Chandra was a descendant of the family of the rebel Hindu king of Jessore, Bangladesh, Maharaja Pradapaditya, but did not inherit much wealth from his ancestors. He earned only a moderate salary for most part of Bidhan's childhood, yet he and Aghore Kamini supported the education and upbringing of not just their own children but also a number of other poor children, mostly orphans. The spirit of 'give and take' was inculcated in Bidhan and his siblings from their tender years. They were taught and even encouraged to give away what was precious to them, freely and willingly. Bidhan completed his matriculation from Patna Collegiate School in 1897, obtained his I.A. degree from Presidency College, Calcutta and B.A. from Patna College with Honors in Mathematics. After completing his graduation in mathematics, he applied for admission to the IIEST formerly BESU and the Calcutta Medical College. His application was accepted by both institutions and he opted to pursue medical studies. Bidhan left Patna in June 1901 to join the Calcutta Medical College. While at medical school, Bidhan came upon an inscription which read, \\"Whatever thy hands findeth to do, do it with thy might.\\" These words became a lifelong source of inspiration for him. The partition of Bengal was announced while Bidhan was in college. Opposition to the partition was being organised by nationalist leaders like Lala Lajpat Rai, Tilak and Bipin Chandra Pal. Bidhan resisted the immense pull of the movement. He controlled his emotions and concentrated on his studies, realising that he could serve his nation better by qualifying in his profession first. Intending to enroll himself at St Bartholomew's Hospital to pursue postgraduate study in medicine, Bidhan set sail to England in February 1909 with only 1200. However, the Dean of St. Bartholomew's Hospital was reluctant to accept an Asian student and rejected Bidhan's application. Dr. Roy did not lose heart but kept submitting his application again and again till the Dean, after 30 admission requests, admitted Bidhan to the college. Bidhan completed his postgraduation in just two years and three months, and in May 1911 accomplished the rare feat of becoming a member of the Royal College of Physicians and a fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons simultaneously. He returned home from England in 1911. Career Bidhan Chandra Roy statue in Salt Lake City a commemorative post stamp of Dr. Roy, published by India Post Statue of Dr. B. C. Roy in Howrah city Immediately after graduation, Roy joined the Provincial Health Service. He exhibited immense dedication and hard work, and would even serve as a nurse when necessary. In his free time he practised privately, charging a nominal fee. Following his return from England after post-graduation, he taught at the Calcutta Medical College, and later at the Campbell Medical School and the Carmichael Medical College. Dr. Roy believed that swaraj (the call to action for India's freedom) would remain a dream unless the people were healthy and strong in mind and body. He made contributions to the organisation of medical education. He played an important role in the establishment of the Jadavpur T.B. Hospital, Chittaranjan Seva Sadan, Kamala Nehru Memorial Hospital, Victoria Institution (college), and Chittaranjan Cancer Hospital. The Chittaranjan Seva Sadan for women and children was opened in 1926. Women were unwilling to come to the hospital initially, but thanks to Dr. Roy and his team's hard work, the Seva Sadan was embraced by women of all classes and communities. He opened a center for training women in nursing and social work. In 1942, Rangoon fell to Japanese bombing and caused an exodus from Calcutta fearing a Japanese invasion. Dr. Roy was serving as the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. He acquired air-raid shelters for schools and college students to have their classes in, and provided relief for students, teachers and employees alike. In recognition for his efforts, the Doctorate of Science was conferred upon him in 1944. Dr. Roy believed that the youth of India would determine the future of the nation. He felt that the youth must not take part in strikes and fasts but should study and commit themselves to social work. While delivering the Convocation Address at the University of Lucknow on 15 December 1956, Dr. Roy said: > My young friends, you are soldiers in the battle of freedom-freedom from > want, fear, ignorance, frustration and helplessness. By a dint of hard work > for the country, rendered in a spirit of selfless service, may you march > ahead with hope and courage... Dr. Roy was both Gandhiji's friend and doctor. When Gandhiji was undertaking a fast in Parnakutivin, Poona in 1933, Dr. Roy attended to him. Gandhiji refused to take medicine on the grounds that it was not made in India. Gandhiji asked Dr. Roy, \\"Why should I take your treatment? Do you treat four hundred million of my countrymen free?\\" Dr. Roy replied, \\"No Gandhiji, I could not treat all patients free. But I came... not to treat Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but to treat \\"him\\" who to me represents the four hundred million people of my country.\\" Gandhiji relented and took the medicine. Dr. Roy entered politics in 1925. He ran for elections from the Barrackpore Constituency as an independent candidate for the Bengal Legislative Council and defeated the \\"Grand Old Man of Bengal,\\" Surendranath Banerjee. Even though an independent, he voted with the Swaraj Party (the Parliamentary wing of the Congress in the 1920s). As early as 1925, Dr. Roy tabled a resolution recommending a study of the causes of pollution in Hoogly and suggested measures to prevent pollution in the future. Dr. Roy was elected to the All India Congress Committee in 1928. He kept himself away from rivalry and conflicts and made a deep impression on the leaders. Dr. Roy efficiently conducted the Civil Disobedience in Bengal in 1929 and prompted Pandit Motilal Nehru to nominate him Member of the Working Committee (CWC) in 1930. The CWC was declared an unlawful assembly and Dr. Roy along with other members of the committee were arrested on 26 August 1930 and detained at Alipore Central Jail. During the Dandi March in 1931, many members of the Calcutta Corporation were imprisoned. Congress requested Dr. Roy to remain out of prison and discharge the duties of the Corporation. He served as the Alderman of the Corporation from 1930–31 and as the Mayor of Calcutta from 1931 to 1933. Under him, the Corporation made leaps in the expansion of free education, free medical aid, better roads, improved lighting, and water supply. He was responsible for setting up a framework for dispensing grant-in- aid to hospitals and charitable dispensaries. Post independence The Congress Party proposed Dr. Roy's name for Chief Minister of Bengal. Dr. Roy wanted to devote himself to his profession. On Gandhiji's advice, however, Dr. Roy accepted the position and took office on 23 January 1948. Bengal at the time had been torn by communal violence, shortage of food, unemployment and a large flow of refugees in the wake of the creation of East Pakistan. Dr. Roy brought unity and discipline among the party ranks. He then systematically and calmly began to work on the immense task in front of him. Within three years law and order was returned to Bengal without compromising the dignity and status of his administration. He told the people: The nation honoured Dr. Roy with the Bharat Ratna on 4 February 1961. On 1 July 1962, his 80th birthday, after treating his morning patients and discharging affairs of the State, he took a copy of the \\"Brahmo Geet\\" and sang a piece from it. 11 hours later Dr. Roy died at midday past three. He had gifted his house for running a nursing home named after his mother, Aghorkamini Devi. He had also constituted a trust for his properties at Patna to carry out social service, with eminent nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha) being its first trustee. The B.C. Roy National Award was instituted in 1962 in Dr. Roy's memory and has been awarded annually since 1976. The award recognizes excellent contributions in the areas of medicine, politics, science, philosophy, literature and arts. The Dr. B.C. Roy Memorial Library and Reading Room for Children in the Children's Book Trust, New Delhi, was opened in 1967. Today, his private papers are part of the Archives at the Nehru Memorial Museum & Library, at Teen Murti House, Delhi.

The term itself was used by L. E. J. Brouwer, who in his 1951 lectures at Cambridge described the differences between intuitionism and its predecessors:Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer (edited by Arend Heyting, Collected Works, North-Holland, 1975, p. 509. > Of a totally different orientation [from the \\"Old Formalist School\\" of > Dedekind, Cantor, Peano, Zermelo, and Couturat, etc.] was the Pre- > Intuitionist School, mainly led by Poincaré, Borel and Lebesgue.

For the continuum, however, they seem not to have > sought an origin strictly extraneous to language and logic. The introduction of natural numbers The pre-intuitionists, as defined by L. E. J. Brouwer, differed from the formalist standpoint in several ways, particularly in regard to the introduction of natural numbers, or how the natural numbers are defined/denoted. For Poincaré, the definition of a mathematical entity is the construction of the entity itself and not an expression of an underlying essence or existence. This is to say that no mathematical object exists without human construction of it, both in mind and language. The principle of complete induction This sense of definition allowed Poincaré to argue with Bertrand Russell over Giuseppe Peano's axiomatic theory of natural numbers. Peano's fifth axiom states: *Allow that; zero has a property P; *And; if every natural number less than a number x has the property P then x also has the property P. *Therefore; every natural number has the property P. This is the principle of complete induction, which establishes the property of induction as necessary to the system. Since Peano's axiom is as infinite as the natural numbers, it is difficult to prove that the property of P does belong to any x and also x + 1. What one can do is say that, if after some number n of trials that show a property P conserved in x and x + 1, then we may infer that it will still hold to be true after n + 1 trials. But this is itself induction. And hence the argument is a vicious circle. From this Poincaré argues that if we fail to establish the consistency of Peano's axioms for natural numbers without falling into circularity, then the principle of complete induction is not provable by general logic. Thus arithmetic and mathematics in general is not analytic but synthetic. Logicism thus rebuked and Intuition is held up. What Poincaré and the Pre-Intuitionists shared was the perception of a difference between logic and mathematics that is not a matter of language alone, but of knowledge itself. Arguments over the excluded middle It was for this assertion, among others, that Poincaré was considered to be similar to the intuitionists. For Brouwer though, the Pre-Intuitionists failed to go as far as necessary in divesting mathematics from metaphysics, for they still used principium tertii exclusi (the \\"law of excluded middle\\"). The principle of the excluded middle does lead to some strange situations. For instance, statements about the future such as \\"There will be a naval battle tomorrow\\" do not seem to be either true or false, yet. So there is some question whether statements must be either true or false in some situations. To an intuitionist this seems to rank the law of excluded middle as just as unrigorous as Peano's vicious circle. Yet to the Pre- Intuitionists this is mixing apples and oranges. For them mathematics was one thing (a muddled invention of the human mind, i.e., synthetic), and logic was another (analytic). Other pre-intuitionists The above examples only include the works of Poincaré, and yet Brouwer named other mathematicians as Pre-Intuitionists too; Borel and Lebesgue. Other mathematicians such as Hermann Weyl (who eventually became disenchanted with intuitionism, feeling that it places excessive strictures on mathematical progress) and Leopold Kronecker also played a role—though they are not cited by Brouwer in his definitive speech. In fact Kronecker might be the most famous of the Pre- Intuitionists for his singular and oft quoted phrase, \\"God made the natural numbers; all else is the work of man.\\" Kronecker goes in almost the opposite direction from Poincaré, believing in the natural numbers but not the law of the excluded middle. He was the first mathematician to express doubt on non- constructive existence proofs that state that something must exist because it can be shown that it is \\"impossible\\" for it not to.

Production The series was co- created by Kermit Love (original Muppet designer and builder for Jim Henson) and Jim Martin (who later went on to work on a number of Henson-related projects including Sesame Street). The series' episodes, which were videotaped in New York City, were directed by Dick Feldman and were fitted with a laugh track. It was produced by Sunbow Productions and distributed by Claster Television, a division of Hasbro.Credits The puppets were designed by The Great Jones Studio, New York, under the supervision of Kermit Love. The puppet designers and builders consisted of Jim Kroupa, Robert Lovett, Christoper Lyall, John Orberg, and Matthew Stoddart. Summary The Great Space Coaster is about three young singers (Francine, Danny, and Roy) who are brought to a habitable asteroid in space called Coasterville by a clown named Baxter who pilots the \\"space coaster\\", a roller coaster-like spaceship. The asteroid is populated by strange-looking, wise-cracking puppet characters such as Goriddle Gorilla, Knock Knock the Woodpecker, Edison the Elephant, and Gary Gnu (host of \\"The Gary Gnu Show\\"). Baxter is forever on the run from M.T. Promises, a nefarious ringmaster who plans to re-capture Baxter and return him to the circus he worked at before he escaped. Each episode ends with a different life lesson, and various celebrity guest stars (such as Mark Hamill of Star Wars fame and composer Marvin Hamlisch) occasionally dropped by. In each episode, Roy shows a short film on his portable, fold-up television. Most often, the segments came from La Linea, an Italian animated series about a little man who is drawn (using a single line) at the beginning of the segment and then springs to life, communicating with his animator through high-pitched Italian mixed with gibberish. Other animated shorts from the National Film Board of Canada, Weston Woods Studios, Jim Thurman, and others were shown, usually broken up into two or more segments within an episode. Francine, Roy, and Danny sing a song together as the Space Coasters in each episode (sometimes originals like \\"Wacky Talk\\", sometimes older songs like \\"Be a Clown\\" or covers of 1960s and 1970s hits), and the various puppet characters often sing songs as well. A few years into the show's run, the MTV-like \\"Rockin' with Rory\\" segment began where a VJ named Rory introduced \\"Danny and the Space Coasters\\" performing cover tunes. There were also other additions to the show including Baffle, Big Jock Ox, and the Huggles. While the action was mostly videotaped on the space set, it was not unusual for the characters to venture down to Earth for filmed musical numbers. Characters =Space Coasters= * Francine (played by Emily Bindiger) - Francine, or Fran for short, is a young woman from a fishing village on the East Coast and is the leader of the Space Coasters where she plays the guitar. She also acts as Baxter's second-in- command. * Danny (played by Chris Gifford) - Danny is from a small midwestern town, a member of the Space Coasters, and Francine's second-in-command. He plays the drums in the Space Coasters. * Roy (played by Ray Stephens) - Roy is from the big city and a member of the Space Coasters where he plays the keyboards. He is also a good poet. Roy showed clips and short films on his hand-held magic screen. =Coasterville inhabitants= * Baxter (performed by Francis Kane) - A large, gentle clown who once worked for M.T. Promises in an apparently slave-like situation at his circus and lives in fear of ever going back. He now pilots the space coaster, taking the characters from Earth to the asteroid. He can magically disappear by twirling around, a talent he uses to escape M.T.'s attempts to catch him and bring him back to his circus. Whenever the gang wants to leave on a field trip, he always exclaims \\"The Great Space Coaster is ready for takeoff!\\" When the gang assembles, he always says \\"Get on board for a magical trip, and where we land this time is anybody's guess!\\" He sometimes plays the \\"baxophone\\" (an instrument similar to a saxophone) with the Space Coaster Band. * Goriddle Gorilla (performed by Kevin Clash) - A gravel-voiced orange gorilla-like creature. He has a tendency to be rude, obnoxious, nosy, lazy, and a nuisance, but somehow the gang on the asteroid seem to like him just the way he is. He is roommates with Edison the Elephant. Goriddle and Knock Knock introduce Gary Gnu whenever \\"The Gary Gnu Show\\" segment comes on; both have filled in as host of the segment in Gary's absence. In Goriddle's case, he made the segment his own by redecorating the studio as a jungle...and by putting on a \\"Guerrilla Warfare Fun-time Show\\" in which he told various one-liners amid small arms- and artillery-fire (Gary did not take this well: \\"He's turned my gnews set into a battlefield!\\"). * Knock Knock the Woodpecker (performed by John Lovelady in 1981-1983, Noel MacNeal in 1983-1986) - A prissy pink woodpecker who lives in the hollow of a tree and tells a lot of knock-knock jokes. She, alongside Goriddle Gorilla, occasionally introduces Gary Gnu whenever \\"The Gary Gnu Show\\" segment comes on. Knock Knock also intros the \\"Book of the Week in Review\\" segments by saying \\"And here's Gary Gnu with the Book of the Week in Review\\", usually waking Gary from a nap. Knock Knock also uses her sense of humor at times to give Goriddle a taste of his own medicine. * Edison the Elephant (performed by John Lovelady in 1981-1983, Jim Martin in 1983-1986) - A strange, large robotic-looking elephant with a segmented hose-like ever-moving trunk, semi- transparent fan-like ears, and a voice like an echo. He loves plants and tends a large garden. Edison and Goriddle Gorilla are roommates. * Gary Gnu (performed by Jim Martin) - A green gnu-like newscaster who hosts \\"The Gary Gnu Show\\" each episode and is well known for his catchphrase \\"No gnews is good gnews with Gary.... Gnu.\\" He adds a guttural \\"g\\" sound to the beginning of any word he spoke which normally began with an \\"n\\", such as \\"gnews\\" for \\"news\\" and \\"gnaturally\\" for \\"naturally\\". Whenever introduced by either Goriddle Gorilla or Knock Knock, the introduction is always \\"And now for something really gnew, here's Gary Gnu.\\" The only difference is that Goriddle always says \\"Wow!\\" each time he does so. Gary always begins by saying \\"This is Gary Gnu, and the 'No Gnews Is Good Gnews Show'. The only TV gnews program guaranteed to contain no gnews whatsoever.\\" In his segments, Gary introduced and narrated film clips of people in silly situations, weird sporting events, unlikely inventions, and the like. Gary's unusual speaking style was inspired by the 1957 Flanders and Swann song \\"The Gnu\\" which told the story of a gnu in a zoo who spoke much as Gary did, adding a \\"g\\" sound to the beginning of various words; Gary actually sang the song in one episode. Gary Gnu's gnewscasts were punctuated by comments and jeers from the filming crew with the crew having different items or things thrown onstage as a way of misinterpreting one of the words that Gary says in his gnews. Occasionally, he was set up for a practical joke after one of his own one-liners, as the crew called him a \\"turkey\\" followed by the dropping of a paper turkey (with Gary's picture taped over the face) onto Gary Gnu's head with a gobbling sound effect. Gary was not immune to practical joking himself; he once produced a spin-off of his show, Candid Coasterville, in which he played an assortment of humiliating pranks on several of his friends...including Goriddle, Baxter, Danny, Roy, and Fran. (Gary later apologized, after all five victims barged into his studio and told him what they thought of his set-ups.) * M.T. Promises (performed by Jim Martin) - A nefarious, bulgy-eyed, top hat-wearing, caped ringmaster who is the primary antagonist of the series. He has always been scheming to capture Baxter the Clown and take him back to his circus. More silly than sinister, he sweeps onto and off the set accompanied by evil circus music and his farewell is always a sarcastic \\"Have a nice day.\\" M.T. Promises has a full-length mirror that talks back to him. The mirror serves as his conscience and frequently gets him so mad that he tries to smash the “good for nothing” mirror with a swift kick, but he always hurts his foot and not the mirror. Whenever M.T. Promises is not trying to recapture Baxter, he tries to swindle the characters by selling them broken items for money, playing dirty pranks on the characters, and trying to break up the Space Coasters by inflating the egos of the members. One episode had M.T. Promises helping out the Space Coasters' telethon to get the money to replace their worn-out instruments. His name is a pun: Empty Promises. * Speed Reader (played by Ken Myles) - A young man who appears on \\"The Gary Gnu Show\\". He can allegedly read incredibly fast, zipping through an entire book (usually a recently published novel for young readers) in seconds and then offering a short review. Before a reading, he will warm up by doing \\"push-ups\\" with his eyelids (blinking rapidly and moving his eyes around). Before each Speed Reader appearance, there was a short film - set to the \\"Speed Reader\\" theme song - showing Speed Reader \\"doing his thing\\". Gary Gnu read the lyrics while a chorus shouted the \\"Speed Reader, Speed Reader\\" refrain. * The Huggles - Small, furry creatures who have stories read to them by Baxter (usually about \\"Bomba the Barbarian\\"). They consist of Fluffy, Puffy (both performed by Pam Arciero), and Scruffy (performed by Kevin Clash). They also have a younger sister named Baby Huggle (performed by Pam Arciero) who appears later on, and who spends most of her time sleeping. Baxter brought the Huggles to the asteroid after he found their eggs in space. As their intro song put it, Baxter \\"brought 'em home to hatch 'em, and now they're here to stay...\\" Introduced a few years into the series' run, the extreme cuteness of these characters was an attempt to appeal to a younger demographic. Their catchphrase was \\"Hey, what's snappenin'?\\" * Rory (performed by Kevin Clash) - A wild-looking lion-like VJ. He appeared a few years into the show's run as the host of \\"Rockin' with Rory\\", a segment featuring music videos by the Space Coasters, typically performing covers of 1960s hits. He often runs late and shows up in his pajamas while making a claim about why he was late when the crew asks \\"Late Again Rory! What’s the story?\\" Rory replies, “You guys won’t believe this, but...” and launches into one of his many wild excuses for being late. The crew never believes it. Rory says \\"Believe this\\" as he introduced the Space Coasters' act. * Baffle (performed by Jim Martin) - A furry, horned magical alien from the neighboring planet Blip (where everything is either backwards or upside down or just plain weird) who appeared a few years into the show's run. He casts spells by chanting the phrase \\"Miki Pooka Tiki\\". Baffle can see 12 minutes into the future. He loves to give free advice and when the residents of Coasterville have a problem, they pay Baffle a visit. Unfortunately, his advice is often so silly or cryptic that they usually have to solve the problem themselves. * Big Jock Ox (performed by Kevin Clash) - An ox-like character who appeared a few years into the show's run. Big Jock Ox often appeared on \\"The Gary Gnu Show.\\" Cast * Emily Bindiger - Francine * Chris Gifford - Danny * Ray Stephens - Roy * Ken Myles - Speed Reader =Puppeteers= * Pam Arciero - Baby Huggle, Fluffy, Puffy * Kevin Clash - Goriddle Gorilla, Rory, Big Jock Ox, Scruffy * Francis Kane - Baxter * John Lovelady - Knock Knock the Woodpecker (1981–1983), Edison the Elephant (1981–1983) * Noel MacNeal - Knock Knock the Woodpecker (1983–1986) * Jim Martin - Gary Gnu, M.T.

L'écu sommé d'une couronne ducale Espagnole, bonnet et manteau de gueules (Grand d'Espagne). The title of duke of Mouchy was a French peerage held by members of a cadet branch of the Noailles family. History The founder of the branch, Philippe de Noailles (1715–1794), comte de Noailles, afterwards duc de Mouchy, was a younger brother of Louis, 4th duc de Noailles, and a more distinguished soldier than his brother. He served at Minden and in other campaigns, and was made a marshal of France on the same day as his brother. He was long in great favour at court, and his wife was first lady of honour to Marie Antoinette, and was nicknamed by her Madame Etiquette. This court favour brought down punishment in the days of the Revolution, and the old marshal and his wife were guillotined on 27 June 1794. He received the Spanish title of Prince de Poix in 1729, and that of duke of Mouchy, also a Spanish title, in 1747, when on the birth of his first son the title of prince of Poix became a courtesy title held by the heir. Philippe Louis Marc Antoine, Duke of Noailles and Prince of Poix (1752–1819), was born on 21 November 1752. In 1767 he received the additional French non hereditary title of duke of Poix on the death of his older brother. In 1789 he was elected deputy of the States- General by the nobility of the bailliages of Amiens and Ham, but was compelled to resign in consequence of a duel with the commander of the Garde Nationale at Versailles. He left the country for some time, but returned to France and took part in the revolution of 10 August 1792. He was for a time a member of the Constituent Assembly. He was, however, forced to quit the country once more to evade the fate of his father and mother. Returning to France in 1800, he lived quietly at his residence at Mouchy during the First French Empire. At the Bourbon Restoration he was brought again into favour and became a peer of France in 1817, when he was created duc de Mouchy. From that point, the head of the male line has been duc de Mouchy and prince-duc de Poix. He died in Paris on 17 February 1819. As a male-line descendant of the 3rd Duke of Noailles, the Duke of Mouchy is also in remainder to this peerage and to the title of Duke of Ayen. Dukes of Mouchy (1817) From the creation of the French peerage, the holders have been: * Philippe de Noailles, 1st duc de Mouchy (1715 – 1794) * Philippe-Louis-Marc-Antoine de Noailles, 2nd duc de Mouchy (1752–1819) * Charles-Arthur-Tristan-Languedoc de Noailles, 3rd duc de Mouchy (1771–1834) * Antonin Claude Dominique Just de Noailles, 4th duc de Mouchy (1777–1846) * Charles-Philippe-Henri de Noailles, 5th duc de Mouchy (1808–1854) * Antonin-Just-Léon-Marie de Noailles, 6th duc de Mouchy (1841–1909) * Henri-Antoine-Marie de Noailles, 7th duc de Mouchy (1890–1947) * Philippe François Armand Marie de Noailles, 8th duc de Mouchy (1922–2011) * Antoine-Georges-Marie de Noailles, 9th duc de Mouchy (1950) Notes References ;Attribution * Further reading * Héraldique européenne: Maison de Noailles (European Heraldry: House of Noailles, in French) * Armory of the French Hereditary Peerage (1814-30) ","title":"Duke of Mouchy"},{"id":"1196206","text":"right Sabah Parks () is a conservation-based statutory body established in 1964 with the purpose of conserving the scenic, scientific and historic heritage of the state of Sabah, Malaysia, on the island of Borneo.

It is published in Japan by Kadokawa Shoten and it is published in English by Tokyopop who have currently released 3 volumes as of 2005. The series is also known as Lawful Drugstore or Gouhou Drug in Japan. Since then, however, the license has lapsed, and Dark Horse Comics picked up the publishing rights in 2014.http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-04-19/dark-horse-adds-legal- drug-drug-and-drop-oreimo/kuroneko The series was put on hold in 2003, as the magazine it was serialized in ceased its publication. It resumed serialization in November 2011 in Kadokawa's Young Ace Magazine Clamp to Start New Lawful Drug Manga Series under the new title, . The four leading characters of Legal Drug appear in CLAMP in Wonderland 2, which is the first time Kakei and Saiga are seen animated; Kazahaya and Rikuo had been previously animated during a brief appearance in the xxxHolic anime, episode 6, and xxxHolic Kei episode 13. Plot When Kazahaya Kudo collapsed in the snow one night and on the verge of death, he is rescued by a mysterious young man, Rikuo Himura, who takes him back to a pharmacy named the Green Drugstore. Kazahaya, apparently running from his past, takes up work at the Green Drugstore alongside Rikuo. He comments that although Rikuo rescued him, he really feels indebted to the store's owner, Kakei, whom he thanks for his current accommodation and job. While their day job is quite simple, the boys are persuaded and, in some cases, practically forced by Kakei to take on strange extra jobs outside the store, which make use of their supernatural powers. Characters ; : :The main protagonist of the series. Above all else, Kazahaya does not want to die - a fact which seems to be linked to a girl from his past named Kei, his twin sister. In his thoughts, he has indicated that he and Kei lived a secluded life, effectively trapped on a single property where no other children lived, and also indicates that neither he nor Kei ever finished their schooling even at the elementary level. :At the very start of the series, Kazahaya is found lying in the snow, having apparently run away from his former home and very nearly freezing to death, before being found by Rikuo, who brings him back to the Green Drugstore. Since then, he has always been trying to earn money so that he might live alone, which is the main reason why he accepts the 'extra' jobs offered by Kakei. He has a supernatural power which is something like psychometry in that he can see the \\"memories\\" of things or persons when he touches them; he may also possess some empathic ability as he seems capable of absorbing emotions as well as memories, and on at least one occasion has channeled the present visual perspective of another person (Rikuo). :While at times he may seem rather helpless, or at least hopelessly naive, he has many skills and abilities which make him highly capable in certain tasks. Specifically, some of his behaviors and abilities seem remarkably similar to a cat, including a heightened sense of smell and vision, several demonstrations of cat-like agility and speed, and his tendency to look like an angry kitten when upset. Kazahaya is noted to be seventeen-years-old at the start of the series, and is smaller, slimmer and has a much more feminine appearance than Rikuo, to the point that he can be accurately described as \\"pretty\\". He gets emotional easily, and frequently plays into Rikuo's hands when teased due to his quick temper. :In Drug & Drop, it's revealed that he is related by blood to Shuichiro Kudo from Wish and that their family is a very powerful one. ; : :The second protagonist of the series, Rikuo is Kazahaya's current co-worker and roommate, as well as the one who found Kazahaya lying nearly dead in the snow. Similarly to Kazahaya, his mysterious past is also centered on a woman, this one named Tsukiko. It appears that they lived together at some point, though at present the exact nature of their relationship remains unknown. Rikuo often comes across as being cold and insensitive, sometimes even sarcastic, and takes great pleasure in teasing Kazahaya. However, in spite of his nature, he is always the one who comes to Kazahaya's rescue when certain jobs go wrong. He has powers similar to telekinesis, as he can break things like cups, locks and branches. :Kazahaya claims that he and Rikuo are the same age, meaning Rikuo is also 17. Of the two protagonists, Rikuo is much calmer and quieter, and in appearance is taller and more masculine - high-school girls appear to come to the store often specifically to ask Rikuo where some random item is as an excuse to talk to the handsome boy. Rikuo has tattoos on his right shoulder and back, which has been implied to have a connection to Tsukiko.CLAMP, \\"Legal Drug\\" volume 1, chapter 5, Tokyopop, 2004 An interesting quirk about Rikuo is that he likes sweet things such as chocolate, which is considered unusual and un-masculine in Japanese society. ; :The owner of the Green Drugstore, Kakei is the one who sends the two boys out on missions, usually without telling them everything first. He seems to know exactly how things will turn out due to his power of precognition, however it has been noted that this power cannot be used on someone more powerful than himself, as in the case of his failures to find Tsukiko for Rikuo. :Kakei is a very beautiful person and has a gentle, kindly air about him. However, he is also very mysterious, and his expression often changes quickly from gentle and kindly to eerie and perhaps even dangerous. He is also noted to have a cruel, and even sadistic side to his nature, although this side of his personality is mostly actualized in almost-subtle teasing. It turns out that the reason he opened the Drugstore is in order to protect Kazahaya and everyone he cares about. :It is later revealed that Kakei and Saigo's true forms are Hisui and Kokuyo from Wish, but many years after the events that took place in that story. ; :Saiga is often seen hanging around in the Green Drugstore - usually napping, smoking, or both. He also always wears a pair of dark sunglasses which he never seems to take off. While it is unknown whether he has any supernatural powers like the rest of the cast, it was mentioned that he is extremely good at finding things, and is currently working on helping Rikuo find Tsukiko. He is Kakei's lover and is skilled in domestic areas, such as sewing and making food. =Minor characters= ; :Kei is Kazahaya's sister and not much is known about her, although Kazahaya mentioned that she has \\"cat- like\\" qualities. The reason Kazahaya left her has not yet been clarified; his only explanation is a guilty, \\"But if we had stayed together, it would have been either you or me.\\" CLAMP, \\"Legal Drug\\" volume 2, chapter 6, Tokyopop, 2005 It is revealed in Drug and Drop that she can see the future of objects by touching them, similar to Kazahaya's ability to see the past. ; :Tsukiko is a woman from Rikuo's past who has gone missing. It is thought she may be dead as when she went missing Rikuo found her room \\"all splattered with blood\\". Her relationship with Rikuo is unknown; he is determined to find her and is certain that she is still alive. It has been implied that Tsukiko cannot swim and that Rikuo once saved her from drowning.CLAMP, \\"Legal Drug\\" volume 1, chapter 4, Tokyopop, 2004 In recent chapters it is clarified that Tsukiko is Rikou's elder sister, and also his only living blood relative. She appears in one of Kazahaya's dreams and speaks to him, suggesting an ability to enter dreams. She can also see the future, albeit only a day or so ahead. ; :Satoru is a student at an all-boys private school. He is Vice President on the student-body government and was a victim of attempted rape. Unbeknown to his classmates and himself, he has the ability to project a piece of his soul out of his body in order to fulfill the desires of his subconscious. Crossover with other CLAMP works In the second volume of Legal Drug, Kakei purchases clothes from \\"Piffle Princess\\" for Kazahaya to give to a girl from Ohto High in exchange for her uniform. In Angelic Layer, this was a store selling Angelic Layer merchandise where people could practice fighting with their Angels. In Suki, Piffle Princess appears as Caffe Piffle Princess, a café frequented by the main characters. Piffle Princess also appears in other CLAMP works, including Chobits, xxxHolic, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Kobato, and Cardcaptor Sakura. In the world in which Legal Drug occurs, Piffle Princess appears to be a popular clothing store. A dress from Piffle Princess is given to a student at also known as (the Japanese word for vomit (謳吐) is also spelled Ohto). Hinata Asahi from Suki — Hinata, her teacher Shiro Asou, and Ohto High all appear in Suki as well. The Atashi character from Chobits appears, such as on a clock in the Green Drugstore. Rikuo and Kazahaya have appeared in xxxHolic; Watanuki is sent out to purchase a hangover remedy and enters the drugstore where the two work. He sees ghostly images around them (Tsukiko and Kei) and observes that there is some strong bond between the two. Furthermore, the High Moon Urn Yūko Ichihara has obtained in volume 5 from the \\"anything store\\" is actually the same vase retrieved by Kazahaya and Rikuo in volume 2 of Legal Drug. In volume 2, Kazahaya walks through the space between a telephone pole and a wall, as does Watanuki in xxxHolic. Watanuki, after inheriting the shop from Yuko, appears as Kakei's customer in Drug & Drop. The Green Drugstore and its staff have made small appearances in Kobato. The Green Drugstore, Kakei, Rikuo and Kazahaya are identifiable in the background of Drop 5 and two characters who look like Rikuo and Kazahaya walk past Kobato in Exam 9. Kohaku from Wish has appeared recently in this series. Release Written by Clamp, the chapters of Legal Drug appeared as a serial in the manga magazine Mystery DX from November 2000 to May 2001. In 2001, it resumed serialization in Shojo Teikoku from July to November; afterwards, it was transferred to Asuka, where it ran from June 2002 to September 2003. It was then placed on hiatus. The series is licensed in English by Dark Horse Comics and available on BookWalker.

It is also the royal town of the state. Its name comes from a flower, the Bunga Pekan. Pekan is also the name of the district the town is situated in, and a parliamentary constituency in its own right. It is the home of the state's royal family headed by Al-Sultan Abdullah Ri'ayatuddin Al-Mustafa Billah Shah ibni Almarhum Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Al-Musta'in Billah. It is also the hometown of the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, Tun Abdul Razak Hussein, and his son, former Prime Minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak. Najib is also Pekan's current Member of Parliament. The Masjid Abdullah, a landmark in Pekan which dates from the 1920s, and the newer Abu Bakar Royal Mosque is near the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum. The stretch by the river bank from the Abu Bakar Royal Mosque heading towards the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum is Pekan's Heritage Route. As you walk towards the Town from the Sultan Abu Bakar Museum, you can visualise the busy river in the olden days transporting people and goods into this Royal Town. History According to local lore, a flowering plant named Bunga Pekan used to grow wild along the banks of Pahang River, and the town was therefore so named. The flower is said to be white like jasmine, although the particular plant species is also said to have become extinct. The river at the Pekan town (near Mengkasar village) is also called Pekan River, however there is no evidence that Pekan derived its name from this river. Other sources say the name \\"Pekan\\" came from the word \\"Pekan Sehari\\" (Pekan Sehari or Sunday Market still exists today), and the word \\"Sehari\\" was eventually omitted and the locals simply called it \\"Pekan\\". Pekan is thought to have been in existence since the time of Old Pahang Kingdom. The old name was Inderapura, although it was also commonly known with the short form 'Pura', which some Malays called Pekan. The old capital was located on both the left and right banks of Sungai Pahang and Sungai Pahang Tua up to Tanjung Langgar. The town was divided into Pekan Baharu and Pekan Lama (New and Old Pekan), and the old name for Pekan Baharu used to be Kampung Cina. Several Arab and Chinese writers mentioned Pekan. The villagers at Kampong Mengkasar, about one kilometre from Pekan in the direction of Kuantan, are said to be direct descendants of Tok Tuan from Makassar in Sulawesi, Indonesia. Among the well-known figures, Tun Abdul Razak was recognised as having a Sulawesi heritage. Transport =Car= From Kuantan, Pekan is accessible by 3 routes, namely Tanjung Lumpur Highway (Federal Route ) which runs through Tanjung Lumpur, Penor and Ceruk Paloh, Jalan Pekan (Federal Route and ) and also through Gambang, Pahang by Tun Razak Highway (Federal Route ). From Kuala Lumpur, one may travel to Pekan by the East Coast Expressway, exiting at the Gambang Interchange to the Tun Razak Highway. From Johor, a scenic coastal road passes through Kuala Rompin. Alternatively, the Tun Razak Highway can be taken, which links Segamat and Kuantan. =Public transport= rapidKuantan bus route 400 connect Pekan to Kuantan. Places of interest = Sultan Abu Bakar Museum= Sultan Abu Bakar Museum. The Sultan Abu Bakar Museum displays many artefacts which are important in the state's history and the local Malay culture. The museum was officially opened by Sultan Ahmad Shah in October 1976. It is located in the former residence of the British Resident, which was built in 1929. It was acquired by the Sultan of Pahang in 1948 and was renamed Kota Beram Palace. In 1965, the Sultan moved his residence to a new palace (the Abu Bakar Palace), where the current Royal Palace is situated. The museum was officially opened to the public in October 1976, in conjunction with the birthday celebrations of the Sultan of Pahang. The first Chairman of the museum was the late YBhg. Dato' Haji Mohd Mokhtar bin Haji Daud and the first Director/Curator was YBhg. Dato' Mohamed Mokhtar bin Haji Abu Bakar. The museum expanded its collections of artefacts very actively during this era up to 1997. The locals eagerly surrendered and provided as gifts certain unique artefacts to the museum. One example of these is a keris (a type of Malay dagger) which was found by a young man in a river about 20 km from the town of Pekan. This particular keris drew a lot of attention, coupled with strange stories of its mystical prowess. The keris is still on display at the museum.

The museum has dedicated galleries focusing on water transportation, personal belongings of the late Sultan Abu Bakar and the late Tengku Ampuan Pahang Tengku Afzan. As of October 2008, the museum has been undergoing renovations. Visitors are advised to call the museum first for more information. =The Chiefs' Rest House= Pekan is home to the Chiefs' Rest House. This wooden structure was completed in 1926 and is featured in the 'Lonely Planet' Travel Guide as a must-visit site in Pekan. It was originally built by the British as a guest house for the Chieftains in Pahang who visited Pekan to attend meetings and events at the Istana. Until today, the Chiefs' Rest House offers good, clean and reasonable accommodation to travellers. Most of the furnitures adorning this building were brought over from the Istana. It is advisable to reserve your room in advance, as it can be packed during school holidays, weekends and whenever there are functions in the Istana. The Chiefs' Rest House is located along Jalan Istana Abu Bakar in Pekan. It is along the road approaching the Istana area. =Other places of interest= Abu Bakar Palace main gate. Other places of interest include the Royal Palace (the Sultan Abu Bakar Palace), Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Mosque, Royal Mausoleum, the Royal Pahang Polo Field nearby the Palace, the Royal Pekan Golf Club, birth house of late Tun Abdul Razak at Kampung Pulau Keladi and the Pahang Royal Silk Weaving Centre. Nearby the Royal Pahang Polo Field is a long-established Islamic college, known as Kuliah Sultan Abu Bakar (the Sultan Abu Bakar Kulliyyah). It has produced eminent scholars all over the State of Pahang and Malaysia. Its students consistently further their studies in the esteemed Al-Azhar University in Cairo, Egypt. Pekan is 15 minutes from clean, sandy beaches. North on the way to Kuantan, there is Pantai Legenda (Lagenda Beach), which features a golf course. South on the way to Kuala Rompin is the Pantai Batu 16 (the 16th Mile Beach), which used to have a royal retreat complex. A one-hour drive from Pekan is Lake Chini, a beautiful freshwater lake which is one of the largest in Malaysia. It features a resort with restaurant, jungle trekking paths and a boat station. Boat trips are available by various routes around the lake. Prices differ according to the chosen routes (duration of boat trip from 45 minutes to 3 hours). There are also Orang Asli (natives) settlements nearby providing a hands-on experience of their living culture. Pekan is also the location of the permanent campus of Universiti Malaysia Pahang (UMP). Pekan Lama. Pekan Lama means Old Pekan. It is situated on the banks of Sungai Parit which flows to Sungai Pekan. Early settlement of shops first started in this area. The original wooden structure of these shops can still be seen until today around Pekan Lama. Istana Pantai was once located here, but it is no longer around and the site is now occupied by the Majlis Agama Islam Daerah Pekan building. Bangunan UMNO Pekan Lama is situated nearby and had been on that site since the 1960s. One of the old shops in Pekan Lama is famously known as Kedai Ah Joy. The proprietor is a soft-spoken Chinese man, who is ever willing to sell produce and goods on generous credit terms to Pekan folks. At one time, this shop was so famous that its name was informally inscribed on one of Pekan town sign posts. Sadly, due to age factor, the proprietor had closed shop in 2011. The premise is now being leased to another business.  Industries  A DefTech AV8. Pekan is home to Malaysia's DefTech's Defence & Security Manufacturing Division plant. DefTech is Malaysia's largest military vehicle manufacturer. The plant was established at a cost of approximately RM70 million in 2001. The plant is situated on a 25.6 acre site and has a covered work area of approximately 180,000 sq feet. The plant is responsible for the manufacture of all armoured vehicles and was given a RM100 million upgrade in 2014 to prepare for the production of DefTech's chief vehicle, the DefTech AV8. The Plant is fitted with required resources and facilities and has the flexibility to undertake a variety of different jobs at once. It is also fully equipped with facilities which are capable of generating most of its requirements in house. The Plant also has: * A workshop for the repair (including base overhaul), maintenance, refurbishment, and upgrading of all types of soft skinned and armoured vehicles. * A dedicated assembly/production line for all types of military vehicles. * A comprehensive Research & Development Department equipped with latest CAD hardware and associated software which enables DEFTECH to undertake its own design work for its product development. * A warehouse with the requisite facilities for the stocking and distribution of spare parts nationwide. * A computerised Materials Resources Planning (MRP) System for all aspects of Production Planning and Control of assembly activities and inventory management. * A test track for the testing of both armoured and soft skinned vehicles (wheeled and tracked) of up to 60 ton MBT complete with NATO Standard Obstacles. Automotive Plants Since the early 1970s, local and global automotive corporations have chosen Pekan as their base. This industrial chapter in Pekan history was introduced and gathered momentum during Tun Abdul Razak's tenure as the 2nd Prime Minister of Malaysia. The legendary Tun had the vision to make Peramu as the industrial centre of Pekan. Back then, companies like TATA (of India) and ISUZU (of Japan) had assembled motor vehicles in their Pekan base. Both companies had since relocated from Pekan. Past and current automotive companies operating in Pekan are: * Mercedes Benz * Volkswagen * Citroen (the legendary Xantia & ZX models were assembled here) * Suzuki * Proton (the Tiara & Satria models were assembled here) * Military vehicles by DRB Hicom Cuisine Pekan offers a variety of delicious food. Being a Royal Town, Pekan enjoys the best kuih-muih (Malay delicacies) which are prepared by the same people or their descendants who used to prepare the same delicacies for the palace. Breakfast menu is aplenty to choose from. One particular novelty for breakfast is the 'roti naik' (a heavenly treat. Looks similar to small buns sold in supermarkets, but with a completely different taste, especially when it is hot). This particular bread can only be found in very few places, Pekan being one of them. Other delicacies are nasi dagang, kuih bakar, ikan bakar (fresh grilled fish) and others. Kampong Mengkasar is also well known of its Murtabak. It is a unique variant of the original Indian dish that can only be found in Pekan. The Murtabak Pekan was not started in Kampong Mengkasar, but it is available here throughout the year. Other murtabak outlets in Pekan, such as the Murtabak Mawar (also known as murtabak Sultan), are only available in the month of Ramadhan. It is believed that the original Murtabak Pekan was started by an Indian Muslim Restaurant located at the second floor of the central market known as Restoran Salam in the early 1970s. It was one of the favourite dish of the late Sultan of Pahang (Sultan Abu Bakar) for breaking fast during the month of Ramadhan. Due to the great demands, more outlets start selling murtabak all over Pekan. Murtabak has since referred as the special dish of Pekan, and one should not pass Pekan without trying and appreciate its delicious taste. Good eating places around Pekan: 1.

The site enjoys views over towards the island of Kerrera and a view of the town, harbour, and outlying isles. The castle is open to the public as part of the Dunollie Museum, Castle and Grounds. History There was a fortification on this high promontory in the Early Middle Ages, when Dunollie was the royal centre of the Cenél Loairn within the kingdom of Dál Riata. The Irish annals record that \\"Dun Ollaigh\\" was attacked or burned down three times, in 686, 698, and in 701. It was subsequently rebuilt in 714 by Selbach mac Ferchair (died 730), the King of Dál Riata credited with destroying the site in 701. Excavations in the 1970s suggest that this early fortification was abandoned some time in the 10th century. The area around Dunollie subsequently became part of the semi-independent Kingdom of the Isles, ruled over by Somerled in the 12th century. On his death the MacDougalls became Lords of Lorne. Dougall, Somerled’s son, held most of Argyll and also the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and many others in the 12th century. Excavations show that Dunollie was refortified with an earthwork castle in the 13th century or potentially the late 12th century. The builder may have been Dougall, or his son Duncan. Ewan MacDougall, great-grandson of Somerled and the third chief of the MacDougalls, switched the clan's allegiance in the mid 13th century: initially allied with Haakon IV of Norway, from the 1250s Ewan remained loyal to the kings of Scotland. In the 14th century Ewan's grandson John MacDougall, along with his kinsmen the Comyns, sided with the Balliols against the interests of Robert the Bruce. John MacDougall's army defeated the Bruce at the Battle of Dalrigh in 1306, but Bruce returned in 1308 and crushed the MacDougalls at the Battle of the Pass of Brander. The MacDougall lands of Lorne were subsequently forfeit and were given to the Campbells, though Dunollie and other estates were regained later in the 14th century. The existing castle ruins date largely from the 15th century. The Marquis of Argyll captured the castle in 1644, but it was returned to the MacDougalls in 1661. In 1746, the MacDougalls abandoned Dunollie Castle and built Dunollie House just downhill from the castle ruins. In recent years, a charitable trust was formed titled The MacDougall of Dunollie Preservation Trust, who are responsible for the care of the historic buildings and collections held in this an ancestral site. Today, the Dunollie Preservation Trust operates Dunollie Museum, Castle & Grounds - a visitor attractions and social enterprise. Through the running of this organisation, all funds raised contribute to ongoing conservation and development efforts as well as education and learning.http://www.dunollie.org Remains of a historical herb garden have recently been discovered in the castle grounds.

She was instrumental in Cicero's political life both as a benefactor and as a fervent activist of his cause. Family background Terentia was born into a wealthy plebeian family by the name of Terentius. She may have been a daughter of the Terentii Varrones, who were the most important senatorial branch of that family. This is suggested by the fact that Cicero had a cousin with the cognomen Varro and a friend by the name of Marcus Terentius Varro. This Varro owned a house near Arpinum not far from Cicero's own birthplace. Therefore, if Terentia was indeed the daughter of a Varro, Cicero's links to this family may have influenced his marriage to Terentia.Treggiari 30 Terentia had one half-sister named Fabia, who was a Vestal Virgin and the daughter of a patrician named Fabius. If Terentia’s mother married the plebeian Terentius first, then Terentia was the older sister and probably the sole inheritor of her father’s estate. Upon her father's death, Terentia became incredibly wealthy. She was endowed with a huge dowry, which included at least two blocks of tenement apartments in Rome, a plot of woods in the suburbs of Rome, and a large farm. The apartments and farm generated a considerable annual income. There is evidence that Terentia had much land in her own name. In addition to the public land she possessed, Terentia acquired a large woodland property among many other investments.s:Letters to Atticus/2.4s:Letters to Atticus/2.15Treggiari 34 She also owned a village which she intended to sell in the crisis of Cicero's exile.s:Letters to friends/14.1 Her total dowry was 400,000 sesterces, which was the exact amount needed for a man to run for senator. Since Cicero was still under the authority of his father, the paterfamilias, he had not yet inherited anything. Therefore, Terentia's dowry was probably used to finance his political career.Treggiari 32 Marriage, family life, and children Terentia was around 18 years old when she married Cicero in 79 or 80 BC. Besides the connections between Cicero and the Terentii, Terentia probably married him because Cicero was an up-and-coming novus homo (new man) with a promising political career. She married Cicero in a sine manu marriage (see manus marriage), bringing with her the dowry and her private property. While the dowry passed into the control of Cicero’s paterfamilias and later to Cicero himself, Terentia herself conducted the affairs of her private property with the aid of her guardian Philotimus. Terentia was responsible for conducting family affairs as well. Besides assigning slaves to complete tasks such as weaving and cooking, Terentia was serious about making offerings to the gods and demonstrating proper piety. Cicero refers to her regular worship in several correspondences; in one letter he describes her piety as an act of pure devotion.s:Letters to friends/14.4 In another, Cicero jokes that Terentia should sacrifice to the god that made him ill enough to expel his anxiety.Cicero Ad Familiares 14.7 Cicero’s jest indicates that he left much of these household responsibilities in the hands of his wife. She was also involved in supporting important relations with Cicero’s friends and family. In 68, Cicero and Terentia invited Cicero's brother Quintus Tullius Cicero and his new wife Pomponia (a sister to Cicero’s friend Atticus) in order to improve and solidify the marriage. In a letter of that time, Cicero writes that Terentia is just as devoted to Atticus and his family as Cicero is.s:Letters to Atticus/1.5Treggiari 41 Tullia, the daughter of Terentia and Cicero, was born in 78 BC. Since at this time they had already been married for two years without children, it is likely that the couple was not very fertile. Their son Marcus Tullius Cicero Minor was not born until 65 BC. Lack of fertility is also suggested by the fact that Tullia herself had problems conceiving children later in life.Treggiari 44 In 51, when Cicero departed for his proconsulship in Cilicia, Tullia was unmarried and in need of a third husband. Since Cicero could not make a match for her except through letters, Terentia was instrumental in finding a suitable husband for Tullia. Cicero himself writes that he allowed the pair to make the decision without his further approval. Therefore, Cicero must have given his consent for a marriage in advance, for a Roman citizen could not get married without the approval of the paterfamilias.Treggiari 83, 85 Terentia was also responsible for paying Publius Cornelius Dolabella the second installment of Tullia's dowry in 48 BC, when Cicero was having financial trouble.Treggiari 116 Since Cicero was a Pompeian and Dolabella a Caesarian, any decisive news of the civil war meant that the situation was getting worse for one of them.Treggiari 118 Terentia and Tullia had a strong relationship that helped them persevere through the tumultuous time of the civil war.Lightman Cicero's exile and family crisis In 58 BC, Cicero was exiled from Rome for the allegedly illegal execution of Roman citizens in the Catiline conspiracy. Publius Clodius Pulcher enacted the bill with the purpose of getting revenge on Cicero for the fact that he had nullified Clodius' alibi in the Bona Dea affair.Salisbury, Joyce E. Encyclopedia of women in the ancient world. Santa Barbara, Calif.: Abc-Clio, 2001 Plutarch, in his Parallel Lives, tells us that Cicero was compelled to testify against Clodius by Terentia, in order to prove that he was not having an affair with Clodia (Clodius' sister). However, this story is most likely conceived either by Plutarch himself or a slanderer of Cicero. Plutarch's intentions were to show Terentia as an oppressive wife and thus to show Cicero as a weak man under the control of his wife.s:Lives (Dryden translation)/CiceroTreggiari 49 Upon his exile, Cicero left his estate in chaos. Terentia was thus left in charge of the affairs concerning Cicero's houses, villas, revenues, and his slaves. The responsibility of Cicero Minor's upbringing, the welfare of the household, and the safety of Tullia also fell to Terentia. She continued to act as a wife to Cicero even though his exile legally ended their marriage.Treggiari 60 Both Tullia and Terentia protested the exile publicly. They wore their hair unkempt and put on black mourning clothes. In this fashion they visited the houses of their friends in Rome in order to gain sympathy and support for Cicero's return. After Cicero's house on the Palatine Hill was burned down by Clodius' mob, Terentia took refuge in the house of the Vestal Virgins. Although she may have also stayed at the home of Tullia's husband Piso, it is likely that Terentia spent the entire duration of Cicero's exile living with Fabia and the Vestals.Treggiari 61 During this time, Cicero himself was depressed and at times suicidal. He writes that he is wretched and that he should no longer live. He asks frequently what he should do and despairs that he cannot ask Terentia to come to him for she is an exhausted woman. Indeed, Terentia was very busy with her efforts to acquire Cicero's return to Rome. In an earlier letter, Cicero commends Terentia's relentless courage and fortitude. He says that he has heard how active Terentia is from many of his friends. This indicates that Terentia was able to rally widespread support on behalf of Cicero. Furthermore, Cicero reassures Terentia that he has given proper thanks to those who she has told him to recognize because they have helped her. This shows that Terentia was not only keeping Cicero up to date on her progress, but she was also delegating him a role to play in the whole effort. Cicero admits that the hope of his return depends on Terentia and so he worries for her health and ability to take on her many labours.s:Letters to friends/14.2s:Letters to friends/14.3 However, Terentia did not reveal the worst details to Cicero, probably so as not to encourage his depression.Treggiari 65 He found out from P. Valerius that Terentia was dragged from the Temple of Vesta to the Valerian Bank. Terentia may have also suffered physical abuse in this incident, as indicated by Cicero's later orations.Cicero On His House Thus, even though others such as Atticus, Tullia, Piso and Quintus were also lobbying for Cicero's return, Terentia was one of the most fervent activists in the crisis. Cicero was able to return to Rome in 57 BC. Civil war and divorce At the beginning of the civil war between Julius Caesar and Pompeius Magnus in 49 BC, both Terentia and Tullia remained at the Palatine house (which was already rebuilt). Tullia was pregnant at the time and she stayed with her mother because her third husband Dolabella had gone to join Caesar. It was up to Terentia and Tullia to decide whether or not they would remain in Rome during the war, even though Cicero worried about their safety.Treggiari 101, 103 During the remainder of 49 and much of 48 BC, Terentia was once again responsible for managing the family's finances. However, now Cicero was displeased with the way she was handling things and he was especially critical of Philotimus' work. In Life of Cicero, Plutarch tells us that Terentia was at fault for the lack of funds that Cicero required to pay for his journey. Although Plutarch was hostile to the record of Terentia, his account supports a letter by Cicero in which he may be blaming Terentia - someone \\"he has trusted too much\\".Cicero Ad Atticum 11.1Treggiari 114 Their time apart and the strained atmosphere of the civil war caused the letters of Terentia and Cicero to become increasingly emotionless and reserved. While Cicero was staying in Brundisium, he often found time to write Terentia. However, his letters were terse and ineloquent, which was unlike most letters between the two.Burns The pair had further disagreement over Terentia's will in 47 BC, specifically about what should be left to their children.Treggiari 122 - 123 At the same time, Tullia's marriage to Dolabella was going badly as his infidelity and neglect of her became more prominent. Cicero avoids blaming Terentia for making the match in the first place (despite Cicero's misgivings at the time), but it is clear that he wishes the decision had been made differently.Cicero Ad Atticum 11.25 Despite the lack of affectionate feelings and the growing resentment and suspicion of Terentia, Cicero continued to trust her with the administration of their household.Treggiari 124 - 125, 129 The strain on their marriage led to divorce in 47 or 46 BC. Terentia was around 52 years old at the time. According to Hieronymus Stridonensis, Terentia later remarried two times, her second husband being the historian Sallust and her third the writer and general Marcus Valerius Messala Corvinus.Hieronymus. Adversus Jovinianum Libri Duo, I, 48: \\"Illa [Terentia][…] nupsit Sallustio […], et tertio Messalae Corvino\\". Read online: . But Hieronymus lived much later, in the fourth century AD, and his assertions are not confirmed by any other ancient writer. Prominent scholars of Roman prosopography such as Ronald Syme refute the possibility of those two marriages (for instance, both actual wives of Messala Corvinus are known). She outlived her ex-husband by many years, dying at the age of 103 in 6 AD.Pliny, Naturalis Historia, lib. vii, 158.Valerius Maximus, viii. 13. s. 6. Notes References *Treggiari, Susan.

Palladium was founded April 1981 in Detroit, Michigan by current president and lead game designer Kevin Siembieda, and is now based in Westland, Michigan. The company enjoys the support of a small but dedicated fanbase who praise its various game series for their innovative settings and ease of adaptability to various personal preferences, play styles, and power levels. History The first game released by Palladium Books was The Mechanoid Invasion in 1981, followed by the first-editions of The Palladium Role-Playing Game in 1983 and Heroes Unlimited in 1984, with Valley of the Pharaohs releasing between the two. Other popular titles include adaptations of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1985) and Robotech (1986). Palladium was also one of the major distributors of Robotech merchandise for several years. Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, all of Palladium's licenses lapsed and were not pursued for renewal. In September 2007, Palladium finalized negotiations with Harmony Gold USA to produce Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles Role-Playing Game, an RPG based on Robotech: The Shadow Chronicles. This license was discontinued in 2018. Palladium claims that it was the first publisher in the RPG industry to adopt the practice of perfect binding its books, a move that has since been emulated by many other companies. Palladium also releases most of its titles in paperback, whereas other major RPG publishers mostly publish hardback editions. This format choice has allowed Palladium to provide full sourcebooks at a lower cost than many other game lines. Although Palladium did not establish the use of universal game mechanics, it was one of the first companies to successfully create role-playing games in multiple genres; for this reason, its house system may be described as \\"Megaversal\\" – \\"not universal, but more than just one world.\\" =Licensing= Palladium Books has licensed several of their intellectual properties to third-party developers. Only one book has ever been published by another company under license from Palladium: Rifts: Manhunter from Myrmidon Press, released December 1994. Palladium cancelled the license in May 1996. In October 2000, Rifts was licensed to the now defunct Precedence Entertainment for a collectible card game. In May 2004, Rifts was licensed to create the Rifts: Promise of Power video game for the failed Nokia N-Gage gaming platform. In May 2003, Palladium announced that Jerry Bruckheimer Films and Walt Disney Pictures had optioned the rights to make a film based on the Rifts RPG series. At the time, Bruckheimer was said to be developing the movie in conjunction with screenwriter David Franzoni. An April 19, 2006 press release asserted that \\"until Jerry Bruckheimer has a script he loves, the movie can't get the green light.\\" In the April 14, 2011 weekly update, Siembieda said that the film option would be renewed for a ninth year. =Embezzlement case and financial difficulties= On April 19, 2006, Kevin Siembieda issued a statement that revealed Palladium Books' critical financial difficulties due to alleged embezzlement and theft resulting in losses from $850,000 to $1.3 million, coupled with a series of delays in negotiating license deals for their properties in other media (the Nokia N-Gage game, the Jerry Bruckheimer movie, a massively multiplayer online game license, and other potential deals). They raised money to continue operations by selling a signed and numbered – but not, strictly speaking, \\"limited edition\\" – art print by Kevin Siembieda, as well as by urging fans to buy directly from their online store if their financial situations would allow for it. An April 26, 2006 article in the Kingsport Times-News revealed that Steve Sheiring, Palladium's former sales manager, had been sentenced in a plea bargain to a misdemeanor conviction, one year of probation, and ordered to pay $47,080 in restitution to Palladium Books in connection with these thefts. It also provided more information about the thefts, which took place from 2002 to 2004 and were only discovered when Palladium took inventory.  Criticisms  Palladium is entirely controlled and owned by Kevin Siembieda. Some writers who have been published by Palladium have stated that Siembieda's method of management was too centralized and not adapted to the size the company had reached (no delegation of responsibilities, lack of open dialogue with employees, bad interpersonal relationships), which they cited as a reason they were no longer working for the company. One of the writers later apologized for the manner in which he made his statements, but did not retract his claims. = Robotech RPG Tactics = Palladium Books and Kevin Siembieda continue to receive criticism regarding the handling of Robotech RPG Tactics after a successful Kickstarter campaign raising $1,442,312 from 5,342 backers, ending on May 20, 2013. During the campaign, Palladium specified an intended release date of Robotech RPG Tactics as early as 2013 Holiday Season. Shortly before expected release, Palladium Books shifted the projection to Spring/Summer of 2014; later the date was shifted again, to late Summer/Autumn 2014 with international backers several months after. Kevin Siembieda and Palladium Books attributed these shifting dates to a number of unforeseen issues including Chinese New Year causing production to start later than expected. On September 25, 2013, Update #113 echoed the intention of a holiday release and promised Kickstarter backers receipt of product prior to retail distribution. This was followed by an update in November 2013 listing several unforeseen issues holding up production and further delay. On September 8, 2014 several Kickstarter backers indicated receipt of their copies of the game, while the remainder of rewards were awaiting delivery from China via cargo ship. There were six cargo ships containing backer rewards, as indicated in Update #156 to Kickstarter backers. This same update also provided some clarification on delivery schedules, and outlined Palladium Book's 'two wave' product release schedule designed to offset additional delay in providing promised products. Some backers perceived the update implied the second wave of items were nearing production. Citing no specific dates however, Palladium estimated mid to late October 2014 as the general time Kick Starter rewards would be available for delivery to backers. On July 14, 2014 Palladium Books issued a plea to backers seeking permission to sell any available copies of Robotech RPG Tactics to attendees of Gen Con 2014, a perceived divergence from an earlier promise to make copies unavailable to the public until backer rewards were fully delivered. Kevin Siembieda wrote: Ultimately, the survey showed overwhelming support for allowing the sale with a majority of supporting votes coming from non- participatory backers. Several days before Gen Con, Palladium Books received word the shipping containers containing Robotech RPG Tactics had been tagged for inspection by US Customs subsequently blocking any opportunity to take the game to Gen Con and further delaying shipment to backers, projected at the time to early to mid-September 2014 for US residents. International backers had not received their backer rewards prior to April 2015 nor had report of backer rewards shipping outside of the US been made my Palladium Books, despite reports of Robotech RPG Tactics boxed-sets appearing in shops outside the United States. International backers receiving items mid April 2015. At Gen Con 2014, an attendee received one unopened core box game used for display at Gen Con and recorded an unboxing video of Robotech RPG Tactics to allow backers to see the final production quality. Subsequently, many fans expressed concern over several production oversights and issues. Notably, included game pieces were missing paint, paper materials used to play the game were missing altogether from all units shipped, game pieces contained manufacturing errors such as injection mold seams and pitted surfaces, and assembly instructions were vague or inaccurate with context to materials shown to backers throughout the Kickstarter Campaign. In Update #154 to Kickstarter backers, Palladium books issued a brief apology to backers and fans, \\"Oh, and we only recently realized that the plastic blast template is not painted, and it is too late to do anything about it now. This detail slipped past all of us – Palladium, Ninja Division, the factory, everyone. Sorry. It still looks great, is a quality piece of plastic and is easy to use.\\". Printed materials missing from initial backer rewards were later released in low resolution watermarked PDF format on the website DriveThru RPG for backers to print copies along with updated assembly instructions to all game pieces requiring assembly, free of charge. In September 2015 several backers openly discussed filing complaint with the Attorney General and Better Business Bureau in Michigan, with claims of filing becoming more public in December 2015 during speculative discussions from Siembada's comments regarding the game. Palladium Books made few statements regarding Robotech RPG Tactics through 2015, particularly regarding specific release dates. However, in January 2016 Kevin released a statement on the KickStarter project page remaining silent regarding the second portion of backer rewards: > ...As I have stated, for strategic and business reasons we have been unable > to share with you everything Palladium has been exploring, considering and > working on. As you know, one of the things we have been doing is looking > into and considering possible ways to reduce part counts and make the game > pieces easier to put together. As we get into actual production and > manufacturing for Wave Two this year, we will share plenty with you. And we > think you'll be pleased. Considering all the delays and frustration of the > past, we do not want to even speculate on release dates and other details > until we have hard, solid information we are confident with > ourselves.https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rrpgt/robotech-rpg- > tacticstm/posts/1478152 As of February 2016, only 176 backers of over 5000 have claimed receipt of their full backer rewards and more than 1000 days have passed since the initial Kickstarter project ended. Currently the Better Business Bureau has 14 complaints directed toward Palladium Books from July 2014 through February 2016, one of which is a complaint with no response.http://www.bbb.org/detroit/business-reviews/books-new/palladium- books-inc-in-westland-mi-13022151/complaints On February 27, 2018,https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rrpgt/robotech-rpg- tacticstm/posts/2120399 Kevin Siembieda announced that they were unable to fulfill the Wave 2 rewards and that due to the end of the Robotech license, Palladium Books would no longer try to produce and support RRT after March 31, 2018, although Palladium Books is still announced at Adepticon and Anime North,http://www.palladiumbooks.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=962:palladium- booksr-weekly-update-february-22-2018&catid;=52:weekly-updates&Itemid;=183 both events happening after the end of license. Furthermore, Kevin Seimbieda claimed that the production of Wave 1 items cost $1.5 million and thus Palladium Books has not been able to produce Wave 2 since 2015, date at which Wave 1 was shipping. As way to liquidate the overstock of RRT products before the licence ends, Palladium Books offered a rewards swap process with arbitrary valuation heavily in favour of Palladium Books. The also required that Backers who wished to receive Wave 1 items in lieu of Wave 2 pay the shipping to their location in advance https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/rrpgt/robotech-rpg- tacticstm/posts/2124551 as well as renouncing any and all legal claims against Palladium Books.https://www.dakkadakka.com/s/i/at/at2/2018/3/2/af520101c940bc20181203df76c22e23_78043.png The manner the project and mostly its end has been criticized by Backers and heavily voiced on multiple platforms. Some questioned the handling of the funds, to which Palladium Books responded with a pie chart missing a certain number of pertinent information (% tax paid, % of funds received as part of the Backerkit in September 2013...) A certain number of backers requested cash refunds as per the Terms of Services signed by Palladium Books at the time of the launch https://www.kickstarter.com/terms-of-use/oct2012 and their position in 2014.https://i.imgur.com/9Uxg55w.jpg As of today Palladium Books has yet to respond to questions regarding the usage of the funds and the refund due as stated by Kevin Siembieda and his staff as well as Kickstarter the Terms of Service. = Loss of the Robotech® license = On February 27, 2018, Palladium Books announced they had lost the Robotech® IP as it was not renewed by Harmony Gold, the current IP owner. Palladium Books had announced that Robotech RPG Tactics Wave Two kickstarter had been canceled. Kevin Siembieda, owner of Palladium Books went on to announce on their kickstarter page: > So it is with sadness and tremendous heartbreak that I announce that, > despite our best efforts, we are unable to produce the Robotech® RPG Tactics > Wave Two rewards. Moreover, after proudly carrying the legacy of Robotech® > in the role-playing games medium for 30 years, our license has expired and > is not being renewed. > ...As part of our license agreement, Palladium has a short window (from now > until the end of March) to liquidate our stock of Robotech® RPG Tactics > (RRT) products, Robotech® Shadow Chronicles® Role-Playing Game books, and > the PDFs of the original Robotech® RPG series currently available Palladium Books' Robotech® license ended on March 31, 2018. = Conversions = Palladium is aggressive in preventing wide distribution of fan-made conversions of their games to other systems (such as the D20 System), and also strongly discourages converting the intellectual property of others into their system; while they cannot prevent it, doing so is not allowed in venues owned by Palladium Books. Palladium also routinely threatens legal action against fans who distribute conversions in other venues by issuance of cease and desist orders. When asked why Palladium was so much stricter in regard to conversions than other game companies, Siembieda stated that the policy had been adopted due to advice from Palladium's lawyers, to shield Palladium from liability for conversions of other parties' intellectual property.

Matthew Balent was one of a few future Palladium Books writers who Kevin Siembieda met through the Detroit Gaming Center. At the time, Balent was working on a reference book that could be used in fantasy roleplaying games. Balent was a Library Sciences graduate, and had the skill and knowledge required to pick through hundreds of books to create a general overview of medieval armor and armaments. The Palladium Book of Weapons & Armor (1981) was the first of several books Balent compiled for Palladium. =Reception= Lewis Pulsipher reviewed Weapons in The Space Gamer No. 43. Pulsipher commented that \\"In my view there is no need to add weapons to those already in most FRPG; but if you must, you'll need to look them up in a good source to get some detail. Ten times as much information about a tenth as many weapons, presented more professionally, would have been much more useful. In short, Weapons is virtually useless.\\"  References   External links  * Palladium Books Online * RPGnet game index publisher information – List of series and titles with summaries, reviews, and user comments. * Kevin Siembieda...

With headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma, he also developed several office complexes and engaged in banking and ranching. Phillips was a philanthropist for both local Tulsa institutions and national causes. In Tulsa he built a 72-room mansion for his residence, which he later donated to the city; it became the Philbrook Museum of Art. He gave of his favorite ranch in New Mexico to the Boy Scouts of America, together with an office building as part of its endowment. The ranch is now Philmont Scout Ranch, one of the largest youth camps in the world. Phillips also made a substantial bequest to the University of Southern California, which named a building after him. Early life and education Waite Phillips and his identical twin brother Wiate were born near Conway, Iowa to Civil War veteran Lewis \\"Lew\\" Franklin Phillips and Lucinda Josephine \\"Josie\\" Faucett Phillips.Andrea Martin, \\"Phillips, Waite (1883-1964),\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture. Accessed April 15, 2015. Waite, the younger twin, was the 7th of 10 children born into the Phillips family. In 1899, at age 16, Waite and Wiate left the farm they called home, boarded a train and headed west. Their travels took them to most of the western and midwestern United States and parts of Canada. To support themselves, they worked a variety of jobs in fields such as railroad building, mining and lumbering, and spent one winter trapping fur animals in the Bitterroot Mountains. Their adventure came to an end in Spokane, Washington on July 16, 1902 when Wiate died as a result of acute appendicitis. Career Waite returned home to Iowa and, after six months of college studies, launched into an active business career. Under the guidance and help of his elder brothers, Frank and L. E. Phillips, he moved from a short period of coal mining in Iowa to petroleum operations in 1906, centered on Bartlesville, Oklahoma. His brothers created the business which became known as Phillips Petroleum Company. Mount Phillips as seen from Mt. Baldy In 1914 Phillips sold his oil interests to his elder brothers. He started out on his own as an individual oil producer, refiner and marketer. His fully integrated and extensive oil operations lasted almost 40 years. After 1918, he had his headquarters in Tulsa, Oklahoma. While in Tulsa, Phillips built several office complexes, such as the Philtower and Philcade Buildings. He also had a mansion built, the 72-room Italian Renaissance-style Villa Philbrook. In 1938 during the Great Depression, Phillips donated his immense home to the city of Tulsa, which adapted it into the Philbrook Museum of Art. Each of these buildings has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. After donating the mansion to the city, Phillips and his wife Genevieve moved into a 23-room penthouse residence that he had added to the Philcade in 1937. That became their primary residence in Tulsa until Waite sold the building in 1942.\\"Villa Philbrook and The Phillips.\\" Gilded Era Blogspot. June 14, 2014. Retrieved June 30, 2014. In addition to his oil business, Phillips was actively engaged in banking, city real estate developments and the operation of ranches in several Rocky Mountain regions. His first choice of ranches was the UU near Cimarron, New Mexico, acquired in 1922. After disposing of his other ranches, he developed the UU Ranch into diversified farming and livestock operations. Waite built the Villa Philmonte as his summer house. On the ranch, he also built mountain trails, a hunting lodge and a fishing lodge, all of which he found to be restful retreats from business pressures in Tulsa. Philanthropy Entrance sign at Philmont Phillips sometimes allowed others to visit his ranch, including a few Boy Scout troops. In 1938 and in 1941, Phillips donated of his Ranch to the Boy Scouts of America, complete with water, mineral and timber rights. The only condition was that it be used \\"for the benefit of the members of the Boy Scout organization\\" and the second larger donation had only the condition that it pay its fair share of taxes on any portion devoted to competitive commercial operations.Lawrence R. Murphy, University of New Mexico Press, Philmont, A history of New Mexico's Cimarron Country, As an endowment, he donated the 23-story Philtower Building in Tulsa. These donations were made without any rights of management reserved by the donor. All equipment and livestock was included in the gift with the idea that diversified ranch operations would provide educational benefits to Boy Scouts and would add to the endowment income. In honor of Phillips, the Boy Scouts of America renamed the newly donated land Philturn Rocky Mountain Scout Camp. Later the property was renamed Philmont Scout Ranch. His son Chope visited frequently, until his passing in 2015 at age 97. Phillips died in 1964 and a primary beneficiary of his estate was the University of Southern California. USC built a 12-story building, named the \\"Waite Phillips Hall\\", which was dedicated in 1968.Voices of Oklahoma; transcript In 1943, Phillips was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame.

At 5,946 feet (1,812 m), it is the highest peak on the eastern escarpment of the Blue Ridge Mountains, one of the major chains of the Appalachian Mountains. The Blue Ridge Parkway passes by the south side of the mountain and also passes over the nearby Grandmother Gap. It is located at the meeting point of Avery, Caldwell (highest point), and Watauga (highest point) counties. Era of private ownership Until 2008, Grandfather Mountain was privately owned and operated as a nature preserve and tourist attraction. It was and still is best known for its mile-high swinging bridge, the highest in America, built in 1952 by Hugh Morton. The bridge links two of the mountain's rocky peaks, and is known as the \\"swinging\\" bridge due to its tendency to sway in high winds. Morton inherited the mountain from his grandfather and developed the tourist attractions. He died on June 1, 2006 at the age of 85. After Morton's death, he donated all of his photographs, including many of Grandfather Mountain, Mildred the Bear, and many other aspects of life on the Mountain to the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Photographic Archives http://www.lib.unc.edu/blogs/morton/ North Carolina State Park On September 29, 2008, North Carolina Governor Mike Easley announced that the state had agreed to purchase of the undeveloped portions of Grandfather Mountain from the Morton family for $12 million.http://www.charlotteobserver.com/408/story/219105.html The area has been added to the North Carolina State Park system, becoming the 34th North Carolina state park. The Morton family established the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation to continue to operate the travel destination as an educational nature park. Grandfather Mountain State Park was officially established in 2009. The \\"backcountry\\" portion of the mountain that comprises the state park is now regularly (in favorable weather) patrolled by state park rangers and other state law enforcement personnel. As part of the purchase agreement, the state acquired part of the mountain commonly referred to as the \\"backcountry\\" in fee simple, and it also acquired a conservation easement and right of first refusal over the remaining \\"attraction side\\" of the mountain. In addition, the Morton family agreed to form a new non-profit organization and transfer ownership of the attraction to it. This arrangement was made as an alternative to the state acquiring the entire mountain, because some of the traditional activities at Grandfather Mountain conflict with state park management policies. On September 18, 2011, the park had a grand opening celebration for its first office area, which is from the Profile Trail- headTrail Descriptions: West Side Trails on NC 105. Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation The Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation is the 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established by the Morton family in 2009http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/Search/filings/9097733 to operate the scenic travel attraction Grandfather Mountain in Linville, N.C. The Foundation manages the roughly 720-acre property that includes the Mile High Swinging Bridge, Nature Museum and Animal Habitats. All proceeds from sales of tickets and souvenirs go toward preserving Grandfather Mountain and sharing its wonders in ways that deepen visitors' appreciation of nature and inspire good stewardship of the Earth.http://www.grandfathermountain.org/about-us/what-is- grandfather-mountain/ The mission statement of the Grandfather Mountain Stewardship Foundation, adopted in 2014, is: \\"Inspiring conservation of the natural world by helping guests explore, understand and value the wonders of Grandfather Mountain.\\"http://www.grandfathermountain.org/about-us/not-for- profit/mission-statement/ The Stewardship Foundation is managed by a seven- member Board of Directors, which in turn employs the leadership and staff of the Grandfather Mountain attraction. Physical features The southern face of Grandfather Mountain. Grandfather Mountain rises 5,964 feet above sea level, and due to the considerable elevation gain the mountain boasts 16 distinct ecological communities. The mountain is famous for its rugged character, and is home to many hidden caves and significant cliffs. It has been reported that Grandfather Mountain has experienced some of the \\"highest surface wind speeds ever recorded,\\" with unverified speeds in excess of . More recently, Grandfather Mountain has upgraded their wind equipment in order to help resolve controversy over these high wind recordings. Notably however, the new equipment is located on the Swinging Bridge of the attraction. The new instruments may not record the highest wind speeds on the mountain, which extends another 684 vertical feet above the current location of the equipment. The primary massif (ridge) of the mountain is oriented roughly north to south, and features four named peaks: Calloway Peak (5,964 ft.), Attic Window Peak (5,949 ft.), MacRae Peak (5,844 ft.), and Linville Peak (5,295 ft.). Although not as high as the adjacent Calloway and Attic Window Peaks, MacRae is much more difficult to reach due to difficult and exposed approaches from both the north and south. Two rivers have headwaters on Grandfather Mountain, the Linville River, flowing east, and the Watauga River, flowing west. Many lesser streams originate on the slopes of Grandfather, including: Upper Boone Fork, Little Wilson Creek, Wilson Creek (North Carolina), Stack Rock Creek, and others. On top of Grandfather Mountain, like many mountain peaks above 5000' in North Carolina, grows an \\"island\\" of Southern Appalachian spruce-fir forest. Though the forest was largely devastated during the 20th century by the introduction of the non-native balsam wooly adelgid, a remnant of this biome still exists on Grandfather Mountain. Many of these fir trees have been permanently bent by the high winds that often prevail from the west. In addition to fir trees, these \\"mountaintop island\\" biomes are a valuable and threatened habitat for many other flora and fauna suited to survival at higher elevation. Looking south from Linville Peak on Grandfather Mountain. Access The Blue Ridge Parkway. The attraction side of the mountain, which includes the Mile High Swinging Bridge, is accessed via Grandfather Mountain Entrance Road. Admittance fees are charged at the main gate. Part or all of the attraction is sometimes closed due to frequently inclement weather in the late fall, winter, and spring. Hiking and camping are free in the \\"backcountry\\" area now designated as a state park; the required permits are available at all trail heads. Those intending to enter or leave the park via the attraction must still pay admittance, however. In years previous when the whole mountain was privately owned, hikers and campers were required to pay fees. Park regulations are enforced by patrolling state park rangers. Fire is prohibited at many of the higher elevation campsites, due to high winds. The 11 trails on the mountain vary in difficulty, from strolls through the woods to some of the most rugged and intense hiking found in the Eastern U.S. The east side trails can be accessed at Boone Fork parking area, at milepost 300 of the Blue Ridge Parkway. When the parkway is closed in winter, this trailhead can still be accessed via the Asutsi trail, beginning at Serenity Farm on highway 221. The easiest east side route to Calloway Peak is to follow Tanawha Trail to the Daniel Boone Scout trail. This includes two large fixed ladders that traverse rock faces. Alternatively, a steeper but more scenic option is the Cragway trail, which is narrower and boulder strewn, but offers excellent views of the Boone Fork bowl, or \\"medicine valley.\\" The west side trails are accessed via NC 105, 0.7 miles north of the intersection with NC 184. There is a wooden sign with yellow lettering that reads \\"Profile Parking.\\" This references the Profile trail, which climbs steadily for 3.1 miles before intersecting the Grandfather trail at a point 0.4 miles south of Calloway Peak, and 0.8 miles north of Attic Window Peak. It is named for the famous \\"Profile View\\" it passes, which is a rock feature resembling a human facial profile. The Grandfather trail traverses the 2.4 miles of ridgeline between Calloway Peak and the Swinging Bridge (Linville Peak), attaining Attic Window and MacRae Peaks along the way. This trail is among the most difficult and technical in the region. In addition to significant steep elevation gain and loss, trail conditions include frequent exposure to very high winds, contiguity to several large cliffs, crossings of cracked boulders, and multiple traverses aided by fixed ladders and cables. This 2.4 miles is normally covered at below half of normal hiking pace. In favorable weather conditions this trail is considered advanced. In poor weather, (throughout the winter and much of spring), this trail should only be attempted by experienced, expert hikers, due to significant formation of ice sheets, accumulation of snow, frequent low visibility, and commonly sub-zero wind chill factors. Significantly, in the early months of 2011, the state park service closed trail access to MacRae peak, something very seldom if ever done under private ownership. The closure notice threatened violators with prosecution under a section of the NC General Statutes. Attractions Mile- High Swinging Bridge One of North America's largest Highland Games, the Grandfather Mountain Highland Games, are held here each year, drawing in visitors from all over the world. The Highland Games celebrate the Scottish ancestry of many of the pioneers who settled around the mountain and feature traditional Scottish games and music. The Grandfather Mountain games have been called \\"the best\\" such event in the United States because of the spectacular highland setting (reminiscent of Scotland) and the great percentage of people who attend in kilts and other Scottish regalia. It is considered the largest \\"gathering of clans\\" because more different family lines are represented at this event than any other in North America. A paved road leads to one of the mountain's several peaks (Linville Peak), and there visitors will find a museum, the famous \\"mile-high swinging bridge\\", and views of up to - on a clear day, it is possible to see the city skyline of Charlotte. The view also overlooks the Grandfather Mountain Golf and Country Club, which lies at the base of Grandfather Mountain. It has two 18-hole golf courses, one championship and one executive, each designed by Ellis Maples. The championship course is consistently ranked as the finest mountain course in the Carolinas. Two river otters seen swimming underwater in the wildlife exhibit at Grandfather Mountain State Park, North Carolina On the road to the summit there are wildlife exhibits and picnic areas. Grandfather has six environmental habitats for black bear, river otters, cougars, bald eagles, and elk. Mildred the Bear came to Grandfather Mountain in 1968 at age 2 from the Atlanta Zoo. She was named by Ralph Smith, a cast member of The Arthur Smith Show, which filmed Mildred for one of their songs. A 2-acre habitat for Mildred was added in 1973. Mildred died in 1993 at age 26. Grandfather Mountain and its surrounding communities were served by the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (The ET&WNC;, nicknamed \\"Tweetsie\\") until the flood of 1940. The railroad helped make the mountain a favorite vacation spot for excursionists during the early 20th century. The scene in the 1994 film Forrest Gump where the title character runs on a curvy mountain road was filmed here. Climate Grandfather Mountain has a humid continental climate, cooler than most of the rest of North Carolina. Winters are cold and snowy, while summers are mild. The mountain receives abundant precipitation throughout the year, with a slight peak in June and September. The average snow depth peaks in February at 3 inches. The earliest and latest snowfalls of the season have occurred on the dates September 10, 1964 and May 27, 1967 respectively.

Many of the diseases are characterised by inflammation either of the glomeruli or of the small blood vessels in the kidneys, hence the name, but not all diseases necessarily have an inflammatory component. As it is not strictly a single disease, its presentation depends on the specific disease entity: it may present with isolated hematuria and/or proteinuria (blood or protein in the urine); or as a nephrotic syndrome, a nephritic syndrome, acute kidney injury, or chronic kidney disease. They are categorized into several different pathological patterns, which are broadly grouped into non-proliferative or proliferative types. Diagnosing the pattern of GN is important because the outcome and treatment differ in different types. Primary causes are intrinsic to the kidney. Secondary causes are associated with certain infections (bacterial, viral or parasitic pathogens), drugs, systemic disorders (SLE, vasculitis), or diabetes. Signs and symptoms glomerulus, a functional unit that represents the first step in the filtration of blood and generation of urine. Glomerulonephritis refers to an inflammation of the glomerulus, which is the unit involved in filtration in the kidney. This inflammation typically results in one or both of the nephrotic or nephritic syndromes. =Nephrotic syndrome= The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of edema in a person with increased protein in the urine and decreased protein in the blood, with increased fat in the blood. Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus, podocytes, increases the permeability to proteins, resulting in an increase in excreted proteins. When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver's ability to compensate, fewer proteins are detected in the blood – in particular albumin, which makes up the majority of circulating proteins. With decreased proteins in the blood, there is a decrease in the oncotic pressure of the blood. This results in edema, as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same. Although decreased intravascular oncotic (i.e. osmotic) pressure partially explains the patient's edema, more recent studies have shown that extensive sodium retention in the distal nephron (collecting duct) is the predominant cause of water retention and edema in the nephrotic syndrome.The Nephrotic Syndrome Stephan R. Orth, M.D., and Eberhard Ritz, M.D. N Engl J Med 1998; 338:1202–1211 April 23, 1998 DOI: 10.1056/NEJM199804233381707 This is worsened by the secretion of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal gland, which is secreted in response to the decrease in circulating blood and causes sodium and water retention. Hyperlipidemia is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver. =Nephritic syndrome= Podocytes, cells which line the glomerulus, are negatively charged and have small gaps, preventing the filtration of large molecules. When damaged by inflammation, this can result in an increased permeability to proteins The nephritic syndrome is characterised by blood in the urine (especially Red blood cell casts with dysmorphic red blood cells) and a decrease in the amount of urine in the presence of hypertension. In this syndrome, inflammatory damage to cells lining the glomerulus are thought to result in destruction of the epithelial barrier, leading to blood being found in the urine. At the same time, reactive changes, e.g. proliferation of mesangial cells, may result in a decrease in kidney blood flow, resulting in a decrease in the production of urine. The renin–angiotensin system may be subsequently activated, because of the decrease in perfusion of juxtaglomerular apparatus, which may result in hypertension. Nonproliferative This is characterised by forms of glomerulonephritis in which the number of cells is not changed. These forms usually result in the nephrotic syndrome. Causes include: =Minimal change disease= Minimal change disease is characterised as a cause of nephrotic syndrome without visible changes in the glomerulus on microscopy. Minimal change disease typically presents with edema, an increase in proteins passed from urine and decrease in blood protein levels, and an increase in circulating lipids (i.e., nephrotic syndrome) and is the most common cause of the nephrotic syndrome in children. Although no changes may be visible by light microscopy, changes on electron microscopy within the glomeruli may show a fusion of the foot processes of the podocytes (cells lining the basement membrane of the capillaries of glomerulus). It is typically managed with corticosteroids and does not progress to chronic kidney disease. =Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis= Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is characterised by a sclerosis of segments of some glomeruli. It is likely to present as a nephrotic syndrome. This form of glomerulonephritis may be associated with conditions such as HIV and heroin abuse, or inherited as Alport syndrome. The cause of about 20–30% of focal-segmental glomerulosclerosis is unknown. On microscopy, affected glomeruli may show an increase in hyalin, a pink and homogenous material, fat cells, an increase in the mesangial matrix and collagen. Treatment may involve corticosteroids, but up to half of people with focal segmental glomerulonephritis continue to have progressive deterioration of kidney function, ending in kidney failure. =Membranous glomerulonephritis= Membranous glomerulonephritis may cause either nephrotic or a nephritic picture. About two-thirds are associated with auto-antibodies to phospholipase A2 receptor, but other associations include cancers of the lung and bowel, infections such as hepatitis B and malaria, drugs including penicillamine, and connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus. Individuals with cerebral shunts are at risk of developing shunt nephritis, which frequently produces MGN. Microscopically, MGN is characterized by a thickened glomerular basement membrane without a hyperproliferation of the glomerular cells. Immunofluorescence demonstrates diffuse granular uptake of IgG. The basement membrane may completely surround the granular deposits, forming a \\"spike and dome\\" pattern. Tubules also display the symptoms of a typical Type III hypersensitivity reaction, which causes the endothelial cells to proliferate, which can be seen under a light microscope with a PAS stain. Prognosis follows the rule of thirds: one-third remain with MGN indefinitely, one-third remit, and one-third progress to end- stage kidney failure. As the glomerulonephritis progresses, the tubules of the kidney become infected, leading to atrophy and hyalinisation. The kidney appears to shrink. Treatment with corticosteroids is attempted if the disease progresses. In extremely rare cases, the disease has been known to run in families, usually passed down through the females. This condition, similarly, is called Familial Membranous Glomerulonephritis. There have only been about nine documented cases in the world. =Thin basement membrane disease= Thin basement membrane disease is an autosomal dominant inherited disease characterized by thin glomerular basement membranes on electron microscopy. It is a benign condition that causes persistent microscopic hematuria. This also may cause proteinuria which is usually mild and overall prognosis is excellent. =Fibronectin glomerulopathy= Fibronectin glomerulopathy is a rare form of glomerulopathy characterised by enlarged glomeruli with deposits in the mesangium and subendothelial space. The deposits have been shown to be fibronectin. This condition is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. About 40% of cases are due to mutations in the fibronectin (FN1) gene located on chromosome 2 (2q34). Proliferative Proliferative glomerulonephritis is characterised by an increased number of cells in the glomerulus. These forms usually present with a triad of blood in the urine, decreased urine production, and hypertension, the nephritic syndrome. These forms usually progress to end-stage kidney failure (ESKF) over weeks to years (depending on type). =IgA nephropathy= IgA nephropathy, also known as Berger's disease, is the most common type of glomerulonephritis, and generally presents with isolated visible or occult hematuria, occasionally combined with low grade proteinuria, and rarely causes a nephritic syndrome characterised by protein in the urine, and visible blood in the urine. IgA nephropathy is classically described as a self-resolving form in young adults several days after a respiratory infection. It is characterised by deposits of IgA in the space between glomerular capillaries. Henoch–Schönlein purpura refers to a form of IgA nephropathy, typically affecting children, characterised by a rash of small bruises affecting the buttocks and lower legs, with abdominal pain. =Post-infectious= Post-infectious glomerulonephritis can occur after essentially any infection, but classically occurs after infection with the bacteria Streptococcus pyogenes. It typically occurs 1–4 weeks after a pharyngeal infection with this bacterium, and is likely to present with malaise, a slight fever, nausea and a mild nephritic syndrome of moderately increased blood pressure, gross haematuria, and smoky-brown urine. Circulating immune complexes that deposit in the glomeruli may lead to an inflammatory reaction. Diagnosis may be made on clinical findings or through antistreptolysin O antibodies found in the blood. A biopsy is seldom done, and the disease is likely to self-resolve in children in 1–4 weeks, with a poorer prognosis if adults are affected. =Membranoproliferative= Membranoproliferative GN (MPGN), also known as mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, is characterised by an increase in the number of cells in the glomerulus, and alterations in the glomerular basement membrane. These forms present with the nephritic syndrome, hypocomplementemia, and have a poor prognosis. Two primary subtypes exist: * Type 1 MPGN is caused by circulating immune complexes, typically secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus, hepatitis B and C, or other chronic or recurring infections. Circulating immune complexes may activate the complement system, leading to inflammation and an influx of inflammatory cells. * Type 2 MPGN, also known as Dense Deposit Disease, is characterised by an excessive activation of the complement system. The C3 Nephritic Factor autoantibody stabilizes C3-convertase, which may lead to an excessive activation of complement. =Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis= Crescentic glomerulonephritis induced by infective endocarditis on PAS staining and immunofluorescence. PAS staining (left) demonstrated circumferential and cellular crescent formation with interstitial nephritis. Immunofluorescence (right) demonstrated C3 positive staining in mesangial area. Photomicrograph of renal biopsy showing crescent formation and tuft narrowing. Periodic acid silver methenamine stain. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also known as crescentic GN, is characterised by a rapid, progressive deterioration in kidney function. People with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis may present with a nephritic syndrome. In management, steroid therapy is sometimes used, although the prognosis remains poor. Three main subtypes are recognised: * Type 1 is Goodpasture syndrome, an autoimmune disease also affecting the lung. In Goodpasture syndrome, IgG antibodies directed against the glomerular basement membrane trigger an inflammatory reaction, causing a nephritic syndrome and the coughing up of blood. High dose immunosuppression is required (intravenous methylprednisolone) and cyclophosphamide, plus plasmapheresis. Immunohistochemistry staining of tissue specimens shows linear IgG deposits. * Type 2 is characterised by immune- complex-mediated damage, and may be associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, post-infective glomerulonephritis, IgA nephropathy, and IgA vasculitis. * Type 3 rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis, also called pauciimmune type, is associated with causes of vascular inflammation including granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis. No immune deposits can be seen on staining, however blood tests may be positive for the ANCA antibody. Histopathologically, the majority of glomeruli present \\"crescents\\". Formation of crescents is initiated by passage of fibrin into the Bowman space as a result of increased permeability of glomerular basement membrane. Fibrin stimulates the proliferation of endothelial cells of Bowman capsule, and an influx of monocytes. Rapid growing and fibrosis of crescents compresses the capillary loops and decreases the Bowman space, which leads to kidney failure within weeks or months. Diagnosis Renal ultrasonography of chronic renal disease caused by glomerulonephritis with increased echogenicity and reduced cortical thickness. Measurement of kidney length on the US image is illustrated by '+' and a dashed line.Content initially copied from: (CC-BY 4.0) Some forms of glomerulonephritis are diagnosed clinically, based on findings on history and examination. Other tests may include: * Urine examination * Blood tests investigating the cause, including FBC, inflammatory markers, and special tests (including ASLO, ANCA, Anti-GBM, Complement levels, Anti-nuclear antibodies) * Biopsy of the kidney *Renal ultrasonography is useful for prognostic purposes in finding signs of chronic kidney disease, which however may be caused by many other diseases than glomerulonephritis. Treatment Antibiotic therapy to prevent streptococcal infection ( Prophylaxis ). Steroids to suppress immunity. Provide high calories & Low protein, sodium & potassium diet.

He was foreign minister of Ethiopia from 1947 to 1958 and 3rd Prime Minister from 1961 until shortly before his death.  Life  Aklilu Habte- Wold was the son of a rural Ethiopian Orthodox priest from the Bulga district of Shewa province. He and his brothers, Makonnen Habte-Wold and Akalework Habte-Wold benefited from the patronage of Emperor Haile Selassie, who had them educated. Aklilu Habte-Wold attended the French lycee in Alexandria, then afterwards studied in France.Bahru Zewde, Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia (Oxford: James Currey, 2002), p. 82 Upon returning to Ethiopia, Aklilu became the protégé of the powerful Tsehafi Taezaz (\\"Minister of the Pen\\") Wolde Giyorgis Wolde Yohannes, another man of humble birth, who had become a powerful figure in Ethiopian government, and a close advisor to the Emperor, with his appointment as Tsehafi Taezaz. Wolde Giyorgis recommended the sons of Habte-Wold to the Emperor, who promoted them through the ranks so that the two eldest, Makonnen and Aklilu, became particularly influential with the monarch. Their humble origins, and the fact that they owed their education and advancement solely to the Emperor, allowed Emperor Haile Selassie to trust them implicitly and to favor them and other commoners of humble origin in government appointments and high positions at the expense of the aristocracy, whose loyalty to his person, rather than to the institution of Emperor he suspected. The Emperor's preference for such men as Aklilu Habte-Wold over the high nobles created resentment among the aristocracy, who believed they were being displaced by these new western educated \\"technocrats\\". When Ethiopia was defeated in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Aklilu Habte-Wold was in France with his brother Makonnen; upon the defection of the head of the Ethiopian legation to France, Blatengeta Wolde Mariyam Ayele, Aklilu was made charge d'affairs.Haile Selassie, My Life and Ethiopia's Progress, translated by Harold Marcus (Chicago: Frontline, 1999), vol. 2 p. 47 Aklilu lived in Paris and married a French woman, Collette Valade. With the fall of Paris in June 1940, Aklilu managed to escape on a forged passport, and with the help of the Portuguese Minister of Foreign Affairs he was able to reach Cairo.John Spencer, Ethiopia at Bay: A personal account of the Haile Selassie years (Algonac: Reference Publications, 1984), p. 80 Following the restoration in 1941, Aklilu served as a representative to the Peace conference after the end of World War II, then served as Foreign Minister. During this time, Aklilu played a key role in the complex process that brought Eritrea into federation with Ethiopia. =Premiereship= Following the fall from favor of Tsehafi Taezaz Wolde Giyorgis in 1958, the Emperor appointed Aklilu to replace him as Tsehafi Taezaz.Bahru Zewde, A History of Modern Ethiopia, second edition (London: James Currey, 2003), states that Wolde Giyorgis' fall was due to the efforts of Aklilu's older brother, Makonnen (p. 205). In April 1961, four months after the previous Prime Minister Abebe Aragai had been killed in a failed coup, the Emperor promoted Aklilu Habte-Wold to that office, while retaining the powerful office of Tsehafi Taezaz in his portfolio. These two posts gave Aklilu a level of confidence with the Emperor that no one outside of the Imperial Family shared. This appointment, and the following increase of commoner \\"technocrats\\" in positions of power and influence greatly disturbed the more conservative elements in the Imperial Family, the aristocracy, and the Ethiopian Church. Two camps evolved at court, with Prime Minister Aklilu and his fellow non-noble \\"technocrats\\" on one side, who dominated the various ministries and the Imperial Cabinet, against the nobility who were represented by the Crown Council, and led by Ras Asrate Medhin Kassa. Although the Emperor forbade party politics, the two rival camps behaved as such, and maneuvered against each other rather vigorously. Many issues such as land reform and constitutional change were blocked largely because of this rivalry. On the other hand, Bahru Zewde is of the opinion that \\"Aklilu's impact on Ethiopian politics is not so easily identifiable. He lacked the capacity for political manipulation shown by his predecessor as tsahafe t'ezaz, Walda-Giyorgis, and his own brother, Makonnen. Aklilu was more of a leading functionary than a power-broker.\\"A History, second edition, p. 205 Former diplomat Paul B. Henze supports this view that Aklilu was not interested in reform, but repeats Aklilu's rival Ras Asrate's opinion that \\"Aklilu was the primary reactionary influence on the Emperor.\\"Paul B. Henze, Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 176 n. 91 On the other hand, John Spencer, who knew Aklilu personally, described him as \\"a remarkably clear and logical thinker and a formidable antagonist in encounters with foreign representatives.\\"Spencer, Ethiopia at bay, p. 115 Spencer further explains that Aklilu's ability was limited due, to the favoritism Emperor Haile Selassie showed him, which led to resentment and isolation from his compatriots. \\"In that isolation his power and stature declined in direct ratio to that of His Majesty,\\" Spencer notes, concluding that with his brother Makonnen's death in the 1960 Ethiopian coup attempt, he lost a vital window into the psychological reactions and secret movements of his peers.Spencer, Ethiopia at bay, p. 117 =1974 revolution= When student protests, military mutinies and an economic downturn caused by the oil embargo erupted in 1973 into a popular uprising against the government, calls went out for Prime Minister Aklilu to be dismissed. On 23 February, then the next day, the Emperor made a number of concessions to the various groups of protesters.Marina and David Ottaway, Ethiopia: Empire in Revolution (New York: Africana, 1978), p. 30 Meanwhile, Aklilu had grown frustrated and weary of holding a position with much responsibility but no authority. John Spencer offers one example, only a few months prior to this crisis, of Aklilu's loss of power: : In foreign affairs where, for decades, his views were uncontested, he was now confronted by [Minister of Foreign Affairs] Minassie Haile, who did not share his views on foreign policy. For Minassie, it was sufficient to go to His Majesty to obtain a compliant authorization of an opposite line of action. A case in point ... was whether or not the Emperor should make an urgent visit to Riyadh to consult with King Faisal. Ill-advisedly, Aklilou accepted a show-down in front of His Majesty. Aklilou lost. Without a constituency, with only a vacillating monarch to turn to, Aklilou expressed to me his concern for the future.Spencer, Ethiopia at bay, p. 330 By the time of the popular uprising, Aklilu Habte-Wold had resolved to resign, a decision opposed by Lt. General Abiye Abebe and Leul Ras Asrate Kassa. Both criticized him for abandoning the government without first having safeguarded authority, law and order in this situation. Nevertheless, Aklilu persisted in his decision, although he recommended Lt. General Abiye be his successor; however when he resigned it was Endelkachew Makonnen who became the new Prime Minister. Aklilu's resignation, instead of placating the protesters, this resignation only emboldened them to make further demands. The Crown Council had pushed the Emperor to appoint a nobleman to the position, and initially Lt. General Abiye Abebe was favored to be named the new Prime Minister. However and when General Abiye's request that he be made responsible to the elected parliament rather than the Emperor was presented, the Council balked and the General asked to be dropped from consideration. Lij Endelkachew Makonnen, son of the late former Prime Minister, was appointed. The new Premier attempted to address the many demands being put forward by the proponents of reform, and Ethiopia seemed to be on the verge of transforming itself into a democracy and a modern constitutional monarchy. However, a committee of low ranking officers called the Derg, who had been empowered to investigate corruption in the military, arrested Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu and most of the men who had served in his cabinet, as well as the new Prime Minister and his cabinet. The Derg deposed Emperor Haile Selassie on 12 September 1974 and assumed power as the Marxist military junta that would rule the country for almost two decades. On the evening of 23 November, Tsehafi Taezaz Aklilu Habte-Wold, and his brother Akalework Habte-Wold were removed from Menelik Palace and taken to Akaki Central Prison where they were summarily executed with 60 other ex-officials of the Emperor's government. This act led to protests around the world, not only from Europe and the United States, but also from a number of African countries who expressed their concern for the well-being of the deposed Emperor.Ottaway, Empire in Revolution, p. 61  Notes  1912 births 1974 deaths World War II political leaders Prime Ministers of Ethiopia Foreign ministers of Ethiopia Government ministers of Ethiopia Grand Crosses 1st class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Ethiopian nobility Executed Ethiopian people ","title":"Aklilu Habte-Wold"},{"id":"1196279","text":"Sigma Superzoom 18-200mm/3.5-6.3 DC Lens attached to the Canon EOS 400D A superzoom or hyperzoom lens is a type of photographic zoom lens with unconventionally large focal length factors, typically ranging from wide angle to extreme long lens focal lengths in one lens.J.

She had captured Jacob Bell the previous day. CSS Florida was a sloop-of-war in the service of the Confederate States Navy. She served as a commerce raider during the American Civil War before being sunk in 1864. Service history Florida was built by the British firm William C. Miller & Sons of Toxteth, Liverpool, and purchased by the Confederacy from Fawcett, Preston & Co., also of Liverpool, who provided her engines. Known in the shipyard as Oreto and initially called by the Confederates, the ship was the first of several foreign-built commerce raiders commissioned as into the Confederate States Navy as CSS Florida. Union naval records often referred to her as Oreto or confused her with , another Confederate vessel. Florida departed England on 22 March 1862, bound for Nassau in the Bahamas. To avoid suspicions that she was destined for Confederate service, the ship was only loaded with enough coal to reach Nassau. However, once in Nassau she planned to meet with a Confederate ship, take on a portion of that ship's coal, and use the additional fuel to steam to the nearest Confederate port. However, having been built under foreign licence, she was the subject of much diplomatic and intelligence correspondence. The governor of Nassau prevented Florida from attempting a rendezvous with her planned tender in Nassau harbor, so the two ships met instead near the more isolated Green Cay. There, stores, armaments, and coal were taken aboard the ship. While anchored off Green Cay, she was officially commissioned into the Confederate States Navy as CSS Florida on August 17, with Lieutenant John Newland Maffitt in command. During her outfitting, yellow fever raged among her crew, in five days reducing her effective force to one fireman and four deckhands. In desperate plight she ran across to the Spanish colony of Cuba. In Cárdenas, Lieutenant Maffitt too was stricken with the disease. In this condition, against all probability, the intrepid Maffitt sailed her from Cárdenas to Mobile, Alabama. In an audacious dash the \\"Prince of Privateers\\" braved a hail of projectiles from the Union blockaders and raced through them to anchor beneath the guns of Fort Morgan in Mobile Bay, where she was received with a hero's welcome by the war-weary citizens of Mobile. Florida had been unable to fight back not only because of sickness but because rammers, sights, beds, locks and quoins had, inadvertently, not been loaded in the Bahamas. Having resupplied her stores armed with the gun accessories she lacked, along with added crew members, Florida escaped to sea on January 16, 1863 under (now) Captain John Newland Maffitt. After coaling at Nassau, she spent six months off the coast of North and South America and in the West Indies, with calls at neutral ports, all the while making captures and eluding the large Federal squadron pursuing her. Florida sailed on July 27, 1863 from Bermuda for Brest, France, where she lay in the French naval dock from August 23, 1863, to February 12, 1864. There, broken in health, Maffitt relinquished command to Commander Joseph Nicholson Barney, whose ill health prompted an additional handover to Lieutenant Charles Manigault Morris. Departing for the West Indies, Florida bunkered (reloaded her coal bunkers) at Barbados, although the three months specified by British law had not elapsed since her last coaling at a British Empire port. She then skirted the U.S. coast, sailed east across the Atlantic Ocean to Tenerife in the Canary Islands and thence back southwest to Bahia, Brazil, arriving on October 4, 1864. Anchored at Bahia on October 7, Florida, while her captain was ashore with half his crew, was caught defenseless in an illegal night attack by Commander Napoleon Collins, of the U.S. Navy steam sloop-of-war . Towed to sea, she was sent to the United States as a prize, despite the Empire of Brazil's protests at the violation of its sovereignty. Commander Collins was court-martialed and was convicted of violating Brazilian territorial rights, but the verdict was set aside by United States Secretary of the Navy Gideon Welles. Collins won fame and eventual promotion for his daring capture of the raider. At Newport News, Virginia, on November 28, 1864, Florida reached the end of her career when she sank under dubious circumstances after a collision with the United States Army Transport , a troop ferry. Florida could therefore not be delivered to Brazil in satisfaction of the final court order, and could not rejoin the ranks of the Confederate States Navy. Florida captured 37 prizes in her impressive career. Two of her prizes were absorbed into the Confederate States Navy as and and in turn took 23 more prizes. Today, many of the artifacts from CSS Florida are at the Hampton Roads Naval Museum.

It is part of the Borough of Chorley, lies around above sea level. Its population is around 8,000, having been counted at 7,959 in the 2011 Census. It is bounded by Whittle Brook, Clancutt Brook, the River Yarrow, Eller Brook, Hic-Bibi Brook and Stars Brook. Coppull is located between Chorley and Standish, Greater Manchester, to the east of the A49 road near Charnock Richard. History It is possible that a Roman road between Wigan and Walton-le-Dale passed over Coppull Moor according to the Chorley and District Historical and Archaeological Society after excavating a site there in 1959 and 1985. The settlement has an Anglo Saxon name describing its topography derived from the Old English copp a hill top and hyll a hill. The township was variously recorded as Cophull and Cophulle in 1277, Copphull in 1351, Copthull in 1374 and Coppull from 1444. The township was originally held by the lords of Worthington until the manor of Coppull was granted to a family of that name under them. Richard of Coppull granted land to Burscough Priory. In the reign of Edward IV, Sir Thomas Stanley bought the manor and it descended with the Stanley property at Lathom until 1600 when William, Earl of Derby sold it to Edward Rigby of Duxbury. In 1755 the owners were named Livesey and John Hodson of Ellerbeck bought it in 1820. The Worthingtons were recussants who kept the old faith, Roman Catholicism. Thomas Worthington became a priest at the English College, Douai and was sent to the Tower in 1584. Chisnall was held by a family of that name. Roger and John de Chisnall are mentioned in 1277 and 1292. Roger de Chisnall settled land and property on Roger and his brothers Robert, John and Thomas in 1347. John Chisnall, when he died in 1525, held land and property in Coppull and Worthington of the Earl of Derby. Richard Worthington was a Member of Parliament for Wigan between 1688 and 1689 and sat for Preston as a Tory in 1690. Blainscough belonged to the Worthingtons who lived there until after the Civil War. =Industrial Revolution= A water mill at Birkacre was leased by Richard Arkwright for cotton spinning in 1778 but was set on fire by machine wreckers in 1779. The mill was rebuilt and used for calico printing, dyeing and bleaching. Water power was replaced by steam. Birkacre Colliery opened in 1880 to supply the works which employed more than 800 people in 1883. The works and colliery closed in the 1930s and many of the buildings demolished in the 1960s. The North Union Railway between Wigan and Preston opened in 1838. Coppull Colliery was owned by John Hargreaves. On 20 May 1852 was an explosion of firedamp, found to be caused by a lighted candle, 90 men suffering from chokedamp or burns escaped but 36 men and boys died. The colliery was renamed Hic Bibi Colliery in the 1860s. It had several owners and after it closed in the 1880s, fireclay was used at a brickworks started and operated by the Ellerbeck Collieries Company until it closed in 1959. Chisnall Hall Colliery on Coppull Moor was owned by Pearson and Knowles Coal and Iron Company in 1896 when it employed 135 underground and 48 surface workers. After 1850 Coppull grew rapidly, many rows of houses were built to house coal miners and factory workers. There were several collieries and deep shafts were sunk for the John Pit, Springfield Pit, Blainscough, Hic Bibi, Darlingtons, Ellerbeck Colliery, Birkacre and Pearsons mines. Mineral lines carried coal tubs to the main railway. Two large red brick spinning mills, Coppull Mill in 1906, and Mavis Mill were built in the early 20th century. Coppull Mill has been converted for other uses and is a Grade II listed building. The last surviving collieries were Chisnall Hall and Ellerbeck. Governance Coppull was a township in the ecclesiastical parish of St Wilfrid, Standish in the Hundred of Leyland. It was a member of the Chorley Poor Law Union formed in 1837 that took responsibility for the administration and funding of the Poor Law. Coppull became part of Chorley Rural Sanitary District from 1875 to 1894, and part of Chorley Rural District from 1894 to 1974. Since 1974, it is a civil parish and electoral ward in the Borough of Chorley.Your Councillors by Ward. Chorley Council. Retrieved 27 June 2010.Chorley Lower-Layer Super Output Areas . Lancashire County Council. Retrieved 27 June 2010. Economy Since the decline in manufacturing and the end of the coal industry, the village has been converted into a satellite town for commuters to Chorley and Wigan. Notable industries today include The Yew Tree Dairy, Morris's Bakery and Staveley's egg producer. Transport Intersecting the village is the B5251 road, which connects Chorley to the Wigan-Preston Road. The village's closest motorway connections are the M6 Junction 27 at Standish and the M61 Junction 8 at Chorley. Coppull is served by regular Arrivabus services to Wigan (the 362) and Chorley Interchange and Stagecoach bus services to Chorley. Network Chorley service operates within the village. The village was previously served by the Blackpool to Liverpool Line which stopped at Coppull railway station but the station was closed in 1969. Recently there has been a campaign from locals to re-open the station. Religion There was a chapel in Coppull before the Reformation. After it fell into ruin, it was replaced in 1654 and was probably served from the parish church in Standish but was later used by Presbyterians. It was closed in 1715 and secured for the Church of England. A grant from Queen Anne's Bounty in 1716 led to the appointment of a perpetual curate. It was rebuilt in 1758 and again in 1861. The village has several places of worship, Coppull Parish C of E Church, St John the Divine C of E Church, St Oswald's Roman Catholic Church, Spendmore Lane Methodist Church and Preston Road Methodist Church. Sport Owing to Coppull's coal mining history and proximity to Wigan, the sport of rugby league has had a strong presence in the village. Chorley Panthers is a successful youth and amateur club based at Chisnall playing fields. Coppull is also home to Coppull United F.C, an amateur football team who currently play in the West Lancashire Premier Division. An amateur boxing club is based at Coppull Mill. Coppull also has a long tradition of Martial Arts with both Karate and Kung Fu clubs in the district. Red Sun Shotokan Karate Club has been based at St. John's Church Hall in Coppull since 1986 and was founded by P.A.J. Handyside, 9th Dan. Coppull is also home to Springfield Park Leisure Centre which holds classes for all age groups including freestyle, trampolining and indoor rock climbing.

As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a triangular orthobicupola (J27) by inserting a hexagonal prism between its two halves. The resulting solid is superficially similar to the rhombicuboctahedron (one of the Archimedean solids), with the difference that it has threefold rotational symmetry about its axis instead of fourfold symmetry.  Volume  The volume of J35 can be calculated as follows: J35 consists of 2 cupolae and hexagonal prism.

Wood was The Guardians chief literary critic between 1992 and 1995. He was a senior editor at The New Republic between 1995 and 2007. , he is Professor of the Practice of Literary Criticism at Harvard University and a staff writer at The New Yorker magazine. Early life and education James Wood was born in Durham, England, to Dennis William Wood (born 1928), a Dagenham-born minister and professor of zoology at Durham University, and Sheila Graham Wood, née Lillia, a schoolteacher from Scotland. Wood was raised in Durham in an evangelical wing of the Church of England, an environment he describes as austere and serious. He was educated at Durham Chorister School and Eton College, both on music scholarships. He read English Literature at Jesus College, Cambridge, where in 1988 he graduated with a First. Career =Writing= After Cambridge, Wood \\"holed up in London in a vile house in Herne Hill, and started trying to make it as a reviewer\\". His career began reviewing books for The Guardian. In 1990 he won Young Journalist of the Year at the British Press Awards. From 1991 to 1995 Wood was the chief literary critic of The Guardian, and in 1994 served as a judge for the Booker Prize for fiction. In 1995 he became a senior editor at The New Republic in the United States. In 2007 Wood left his role at The New Republic to become a staff writer at The New Yorker. Wood's reviews and essays have appeared frequently in The New York Times, The New Yorker, the New York Review of Books, and the London Review of Books where he is a member of its editorial board. He and his wife, the novelist Claire Messud, are on the editorial board of the literary magazine The Common, based at Amherst College. =Teaching= Wood began teaching literature in a class he co-taught with the late novelist Saul Bellow at Boston University. Wood also taught at Kenyon College in Ohio, and since September 2003 has taught half time at Harvard University, first as a Visiting Lecturer and then as Professor of the Practice of Literary Criticism. In 2010–11, he was the Weidenfeld Visiting Professor of European Comparative Literature in St Anne's College, Oxford. =Ideas= Like the critic Harold Bloom, Wood advocates an aesthetic approach to literature, rather than more ideologically driven trends that are popular in contemporary academic literary criticism. In an interview with The Harvard Crimson Wood explains that the \\"novel exists to be affecting...to shake us profoundly. When we're rigorous about feeling, we're honoring that.\\" The reader, then, should approach the text as a writer, \\"which is [about] making aesthetic judgments.\\" Wood coined the term hysterical realism, which he uses to denote the contemporary conception of the \\"big, ambitious novel\\" that pursues vitality \\"at all costs.\\" Hysterical realism describes novels that are characterised by chronic length, manic characters, frenzied action, and frequent digressions on topics secondary to the story. In response to an essay Wood wrote on the subject, author Zadie Smith described hysterical realism as a \\"painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own White Teeth ... [yet] any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna. You cannot place first-time novelists with literary giants, New York hipsters with Kilburn losers, and some of the writers who got caught up with me are undeserving of the criticism'.” Wood coined the term commercial realism, which he identifies with the author Graham Greene, and, in particular, with his book The Heart of the Matter. He clarified it as attention to the minutiae of daily life, taking in mind elements of the everyday that are important owing to their supposed lack of importance. He believes it to be an effective style of writing because it captures reality by depicting banal features as well as interesting ones. Wood emphasises throughout the book How Fiction Works (particularly in the final chapter) that the most important literary style is realism. He states: Wood additionally attests to the significance of Flaubert in developing the form of the novel: Others on Wood In reviewing one of his works Adam Begley of the Financial Times wrote that Wood \\"is the best literary critic of his generation\\". Martin Amis described Wood as \\"a marvellous critic, one of the few remaining.\\" Fellow book reviewer and journalist Christopher Hitchens was fond of James Wood's work, in one case giving his students a copy of Wood's review of the Updike novel Terrorist, citing it as far better than his own.Christopher Hitchens on Books & Ideas In the 2004 issue of n+1 the editors criticised both Wood and The New Republic, writing: James Wood wrote a reply in the Fall 2005 issue, explaining his conception of the \\"autonomous novel,\\" in response to which the n+1 editors devoted a large portion of the journal's subsequent issue to a roundtable on the state of contemporary literature and criticism. Awards He was a recipient of the 2010/2011 Berlin Prize Fellowship from the American Academy in Berlin.  Personal life In 1992 Wood married Claire Messud, an American novelist. They reside in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and have a daughter, Livia, and a son, Lucian. Selected works  Notes Wood has written the following: \\"I have made a home in the United States, but it is not quite Home. For instance, I have no desire to become an American citizen. Recently, when I arrived at Boston, the immigration officer commented on the length of time I've held a Green Card. 'A Green Card is usually considered a path to citizenship,' he said, a sentiment both irritatingly reproving and movingly patriotic. I mumbled something about how he was perfectly correct, and left it at that. [...] The poet and novelist Patrick McGuinness, in his forthcoming book Other People's Countries (itself a rich analysis of home and homelessness; McGuinness is half-Irish and half-Belgian) quotes Simenon, who was asked why he didn't change his nationality, 'the way successful francophone Belgians often did'. Simenon replied: 'There was no reason for me to be born Belgian, so there’s no reason for me to stop being Belgian.' I wanted to say something similar, less wittily, to the immigration officer: precisely because I don't need to become an American citizen, to take citizenship would seem flippant; leave its benefits for those who need a new land.\\" References External links * James Wood at The Guardian * James Wood at the London Review of Books * James Wood at The New Republic * James Wood at The New Yorker * Text and video of keynote speech at the 2009 Griffin Poetry Prize ceremony 1965 births Living people Alumni of Jesus College, Cambridge English expatriates in the United States English people of Scottish descent Fellows of the Royal Society of Literature Harvard University faculty Kenyon College faculty English essayists English male novelists Literary critics of English English literary critics The Guardian people The New Republic people The New Yorker critics The New Yorker staff writers People educated at the Chorister School, Durham People educated at Eton College People from Durham, England ","title":"James Wood (critic)"},{"id":"1196332","text":"Bavius and Maevius (or Mevius) were two poets in the age of Augustus Caesar, whose names became synonymous with bad verse and malicious criticism of superior writers. Both are named together in Virgil's Eclogues (3.90). Maevius is also the object of Horace's tenth Epode, which invites the gods to drown him as he embarks on a sea voyage. The name M(a)evius is attested of several historical individuals, but whether Virgil's Bavius and Maevius are real writers or literary inventions is unclear. Alexander Pope mentions Bavius in his 1729 Dunciad Variorum and explains, in a note, that he drew the reference from Virgil. Pope draws a parallel between these two critics and his own dunces by quoting John Dennis who thought it likely that Bavius \\"and Maevius had (even in Augustus's days) a very formidable Party at Rome, who thought them much superior to Virgil and Horace: For (saith he) I cannot believe they would have fix'd that eternal brand upon them, if they had not been coxcombs in more than ordinary credit\\" (Dunciad Variorum). Bavius and Maevius are also like the \\"dunces\\" in Pope's own Dunciad in that little is remembered of them except for their bad reputations. In the Dunciad, Book III, Pope has Bavius dip the transmigrating souls of poetasters in Lethe, making them doubly stupid before being born as hack writers.

Eddie then finds himself awake and uninjured and realizes that he feels young and much more energetic. He also feels calm. He meets a man known simply as \\"the Blue Man\\". The Blue Man suffered from argyria caused by silver nitrate poisoning, and worked at Ruby Pier's sideshow while it was still open, during the days of Eddie's childhood. Through their conversation, Eddie finds out that he is dead, and he has arrived in heaven and embarked on a journey through five of its levels, meeting someone who has had a significant impact upon his life or someone upon whom his life had a significant impact. He also finds the reason for his sudden energy, youth, and stamina — in the five stages of Heaven, you will feel exactly the same way you did (young, old, healthy, sick, strong, weak) as you did when you knew the person you are meeting. Eddie asks why the Blue Man, whom he does not know, is his first person, and he informs Eddie that, when Eddie was very young, he caused the car accident that killed him. From this, Eddie learns his first lesson which is that there are no random events in life and all individuals and experiences are connected in some way. He also learns that everyone and everything has a purpose in life. The second person that Eddie meets is his former captain from the army, whom Eddie finds sitting in a tree in a Philippine rainforest. The Captain reminds Eddie of their time together as prisoners of war in a forced labor camp. Their group escaped after a lengthy period of time and burned the camp during their escape as an act of relieving some of the stress placed upon them during their long stretch in captivity. Eddie remembers that he had seen a shadow running from one of the huts that he set aflame, although he never identified the figure. The Captain confesses that he was the one who shot Eddie in the leg to prevent Eddie from chasing the shadow into the fire, which would have certainly caused Eddie's death because he promised that \\"no one gets left behind\\". This saved Eddie's life despite leaving him with a lifelong injury and severe limp that Eddie repeatedly blames as the main reasons for his never achieving a life outside of Ruby Pier, a place he had grown to loathe in his old age due to his mother's failing faculties making his father's taken-over job and a life at the pier impossible to escape. Eddie then learns how the Captain died -- something he had never put much thought into before, as the men in his platoon had lost touch with each other after the war, and Eddie was in no condition at the time to fully realize what had happened after his injury. As the Captain and his men were making their escape from the prison camp, the men tended Eddie's leg in the back of the truck as the Captain cleared the path ahead. While he was scouting the road in front of the truck, the Captain stepped on a land mine that would have killed all the men had he not set it off. Instead, the battlefield became the Captain's final resting place and Eddie learns his second lesson -- the importance of sacrifice, both big and small. After this revelation, the Captain shows Eddie the true nature of his Heaven, which is not in fact the battlefield that Eddie remembers. The war-torn environment around them makes way to the most serene, beautiful nature landscape that Eddie has ever seen. Eddie looks at the Captain to see a man he hardly recognized without the layer of ash and dirt on his face — a young man in a pristine, clean army uniform who explains that for his Heaven he wished to see what the world was like before war, fighting, conflicts, and cruelty. Eddie watches the Captain walk away after he tosses Eddie his old combat helmet. Inside the helmet, Eddie finds a foreshadowing of things to come: a single picture of his late wife Marguerite, the same one he carried with him during war times. The scene changes and Eddie finds himself outside in a snowdrift, but he notices that the snow is neither cold nor wet. He notices a diner where he sees his father through a window and begins yelling and pleading for his attention. When his father appears to not be able to see or hear him, a well- dressed woman named Ruby appears and introduces herself to him. He assumes she must have been rich based on the manner of her clothing. She tells him that she has not always been this way and proceeds to explain to Eddie her story. Ruby tells Eddie that she had once worked as a waitress at the diner and explains that Ruby Pier was named after her by her husband Emile, who built it in tribute to her. Emile was wounded while fighting a fire that burned much of Ruby Pier and later died from pneumonia. Ruby confesses that she picked the diner because that was where she had met Emile and wanted the diner to be a refuge for anyone who had ever been hurt in any way by Ruby Pier, which she grew to despise as it took so much away from them. This is the reason that Eddie's father, a harsh and abusive man, became a part of Ruby's Heaven. Ruby teaches Eddie to release his anger and forgive his father for all the trouble and hurt he had caused, only after she showed him the true cause of his father's death (different from what he had always believed had happened). Mickey Shea, a man who worked on rides at Ruby Pier with Eddie's father, was at Eddie's house drunk and in a terrible emotional state. He pulled out a flask, downed it, and then proceeded to try and force himself onto Eddie's mother. Eddie's father walked in at this point and managed to stop the drink- fueled rape, then chased Mickey all the way to the pier, where Mickey jumped into the freezing water in an attempt to evade him, even though unable to swim. Eddie's father jumped in after Mickey and saved him, as they had long been friends and Eddie's father felt he owed him despite his recent drunken behavior towards his wife. Eddie's father later died after falling ill due to being in the freezing water when he rescued Mickey. Ruby tells Eddie that he needs to forgive his father and tells him that hatred was a deadly weapon. \\"We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves.\\" Then Eddie moves on to another heaven. Eddie now awakens in a room with several doors. Behind each of the doors, there is a wedding from a different culture and Eddie meets his late wife, Marguerite, in one of the weddings. They spend an extended period together, moving from one wedding to the next and catching up on all the things they had not been able to share since Marguerite's death. They remember their own wedding, and in the end, Marguerite teaches Eddie that love is never lost in death, it just moves on and takes a different form. He begs her forgiveness for never making more of his life, never leaving his job at the pier, and for not giving her a better life she so richly deserved. However, she answers that she loved the fairground and their life on the pier, and the only thing she regretted was them not being able to have any children. He replies that all he would've changed is to have had even more time together with her, for it not to have been cut short like it was by her early death. Marguerite's love for weddings comes from the look in all the brides' and grooms' eyes right before the ceremony, the shared feeling that their love will without a doubt break all the records. Marguerite asks Eddie at one point if he believed they had that; he simply replies, \\"We had an accordion player\\", at which they both laugh. (Eddie and Marguerite's wedding was on the rented top floor of a Chinese restaurant and was very low-budget, but the couple holds nothing but fond memories of the occasion — in Eddie's house, Dominguez finds a case of sentimental objects, including a restaurant menu from their wedding night.) When Eddie awakens to a new scene, his fifth and last, he sees children playing along with a riverbed and a young Filipina girl named Tala waves and comes up to him. They attempt to understand each other, but finally, Tala manages to communicate and reveal that she was the little girl from the hut that Eddie set on fire. And Eddie finally realizes that shadow he had seen all those years ago in the burning hut, and in his nightmares for most of his life afterward, was indeed not imagined — the little girl had been that shadow attempting to flee the flames. The girl shows Eddie the burns that she suffered when dying from the fire, as her previously clear skin turns to burnt flesh and scars. Eddie is absolutely distraught and breaks down both cursing and asking God \\"why?\\", then further begging for God's forgiveness. The little girl walks into the river and hands him a stone and asks him to \\"wash\\" her like the other children in the river are doing to one another. Eddie is puzzled, tells her he doesn't know how, but then slowly attempts to do as she asks. He dips the stone in the water and starts to scrape off the injuries he had inflicted on her; and soon to his surprise, Tala's wounds begin to clear until she is freed of all the scars. Eddie then asks Tala if she knows if he was able to save the little girl he attempted to save before his death. He tells her he fears that he failed to save her and he remembers feeling the little girl's hands in his just before his death. But Tala tells him he did indeed manage to save her; he had actually pushed her out of the way. Then she reveals that it was her (Tala's) hands that Eddie had felt instead as she pulled him safely up to Heaven. So in reality, Eddie did manage to save the girl at Ruby Pier. Tala teaches Eddie that his life was not for nothing and that its purpose was to protect all the many children at Ruby Pier through his care for the safety of the rides. In this way, Tala explains, he also managed to atone every day for her unnecessary death. In the end, it shows that Eddie's Heaven is the Stardust Band Shell, where he met Marguerite. He is shown a vision of all the many people he saved along the years by his maintenance work, and consequently all their children's children down the generations. For he wants everyone to be free of accidents, everyone safe. He is once again told that every life touches another and that everything is connected: it is all one big life. He is also one of the five people to be met by the girl whose life he saved when she dies...  Characters and their characterizations  Eddie: The protagonist and main character around who the story centers; at the start of the story, he is killed on his 83rd birthday. When he awakes in heaven, he is taken on a journey to meet five people whose lives intertwined with his in many ways which he never expected. As an adult he wanted to work as an engineer. Marguerite: Eddie's wife who he met at Ruby Pier and married after returning from World War II. Eddie would always remember \\"her waving over her shoulder, her dark hair falling over one eye.\\" Marguerite has \\"olive skin\\" and \\"dark coffee eyes.\\" She dies at the age of forty-seven of a brain tumor. Joseph Corvelzchik, The Blue Man: Joseph's skin had been turned blue when he was a boy because of repeated ingestion of silver nitrate, thought to be an effective medication at the time. He had been given this medication to cure his \\"nervousness\\" and bed-wetting at a late age, and Joseph simply attributed all the side effects to not ingesting enough. Handicapped by this disfigurement, Joseph eventually made a life for himself at Ruby Pier. Joseph is a \\"middle-aged man with narrow, stooped shoulders, naked from the waist up. His belly sagged over his belt. His hair was closely cropped. His lips were thin and his face was long and drawn.\\" He dies of a heart attack because of Eddie, when Eddie tried to get a ball off the streets and causes him to swerve his car to avoid hitting Eddie. The Captain: Eddie's commanding officer at war. He has a \\"full head of dark hair\\" and looked to be \\"only in his 30s.\\" The Captain saved Eddie's life by shooting him in the leg. He died by stepping on a land mine while checking to ensure if there was a clear path ahead for his men. Ruby: A woman for whom Ruby Pier is named by her fiance Emile. Ruby's face was \\"gaunt, with sagging cheeks, rose-colored lipstick, and tightly pulled-back white hair.\\" She wore \\"wire-rimmed spectacles over narrow blue eyes.\\" She wore \\"a dress made of silk and chiffon with a bib-like bodice stitched with white beads and topped with a velvet bow just below her neck.\\" Her skirt had \\"a rhinestone buckle and snaps and hooks up the side\\" while also holding a \\"parasol with both hands.\\" She was a widow in her fifties. Emile: Ruby's husband, who also created the original Ruby Pier. He wore \\"a chalk-stripe suit and a derby hat.\\" He had neatly cut dark hair and a mustache that covered a constant smile. Emile was known for \\"his heavy, confident laughter\\" and being \\"a spender and a risk taker.\\" He was injured in a big fire trying to save Ruby Pier from being destroyed. Eddie's mother: Eddie's mother was known for her tenderness\\" towards Eddie and his brother Joe. She lived in a daze after the death of Eddie's father. Eddie's father: He abused Eddie his entire life. He smoked cigars and was a card player. Eddie's father was remembered for his \\"discipline\\" or \\"violence\\" and \\"denial of affection\\" or \\"silence.\\" He dies at the age of fifty-six of pneumonia. Mickey Shea: He is a family friend. He worked with Eddie's father \\"fixing rides at Ruby Pier.\\" Mickey is \\"fat, wears suspenders and is always singing Irish songs. Mickey attempted to rape Eddie's mother because of loneliness and depression. Mickey and Eddie's father fought, and Mickey was almost killed by Eddie's dad, but eventually, Eddie's dad ended up saving Mickey from drowning in the ocean, causing the pneumonia that killed Eddie's father\\". Dominguez: He is Eddie's friend and coworker at Ruby Pier. He is \\"a lanky, bony-cheeked young man.\\" He is planning to go to Mexico with his wife Theresa and eventually takes Eddie's job as head of maintenance. Willie: Willie works the Freddy's Free Fall at Ruby Pier. Annie: Amy or Annie is the \\"little girl with a pipe-cleaner animal\\". She is standing on the \\"ride's metal base\\" that one of Freddy's Free Fall's carts comes crashing down on. Eddie doesn't know whether or not he saved her until the end of the book. Tala: Tala is a young girl Eddie sees in a burning hut. She is a Filipina, maybe five or six years old with \\"a beautiful cinnamon complexion, hair the color of dark plum, a small flat nose, full lips that spread joyfully over her gapped teeth, and the most arresting eyes.\\" Fifth person that Eddie meets in heaven, Nicky: Nicky is a young man who visited Ruby Pier, and practically the reason why Eddie died. He dropped his car keys in the Freddy's Free Fall ride, causing its gears to jam and its cable to snap. Nicky claims to be Ruby's great- grandson.  Themes  The theme of the book changes as Eddie progresses through heaven, each theme being the lesson Eddie learns from each of the people he meets in heaven: * Blue Man: Everything happens for a reason. There are no random events in life. All lives and experiences are interconnected in some way, and even the little things you do can affect other people's lives and experiences dramatically. The Blue Man states \\"... the human spirit knows, deep down, that all lives intersect\\" * The Captain: Sacrifices are a part of life. Everyone makes these sacrifices. Some sacrifices are big, and others are day-to-day small sacrifices, but they all make an impact in other people's lives. * Ruby: The importance of releasing anger and granting forgiveness. There is always more than one side to a story. [31] * Marguerite: The power of love, even after death. There are multiple forms of love, some stronger than others. Lost love is the strongest kind of love, the kind that can be felt even across enormous distances. * Tala: There's always a purpose for your life. You live for a reason the same way that people die for a reason. Where you are today is a combination of all your past actions, decisions, and the way the people around you have affected you.  Film  A made-for-television film adaptation of the novel, starring Jon Voight as Eddie, was released in 2004 and is available on DVD. Aside from a few details about Eddie's life and a more chronological telling of the story, the film is very faithful to the book, as Mitch Albom himself wrote the teleplay.

He was the last prime minister from the Rana family, which had controlled Nepal for more than a century and reduced the monarchy to a figurehead. He was the son of the 5th Rana Prime Minister of Nepal Chandra Shumsher and Bada Maharani Chandra Loka Bhakta Lakshmi Devi. He became prime minister at a time when the king, Tribhuvan was attempting to assert himself. Tribhuvan wanted to establish a stronger monarchy and some democracy, which Mohan Shamsher opposed. In 1950, Mohan Shumsher's policies against the monarchy forced Tribhuvan and his son Mahendra to flee to India with the help of the Indian Residency and the Indian government, which led Mohan Shamhser to proclaim Mahendra's three-year-old son Gyanendra the king of Nepal. Later in the revolution of 1951, Tribhuvan returned to Nepal after signing The Delhi Treaty between Mohan Shamhser, Tribhuvan and Nepali Congress thus restoring his throne and bringing the stately power back to the monarch. By the end of 1951, the king and his allies, the Nepali Congress had triumphed, and Mohan Shumsher and the rest of the Rana family lost power. The Ranas were deprived of all the hereditary offices and privileges conferred by king Surendra Bikram Shah on Jang Bahadur even though Mohan Shumsher still held the office of the prime minister for until several demonstrations by Ranas in an attempt to reestablish their rule and the opposition of the monarchy and Nepali Congress forced him to resign from his position.

It is governed by the South Dakota Board of Regents. Founded in 1885, the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology offers bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees.View the SD Mines Virtual Tour and the Online Viewbook. History The cornerstone of the first School of Mines (then known as the Dakota School of Mines) building was dedicated on August 19, 1885, with the first classes being held February 21, 1887. John W. Hancher received the first bachelor of science degree at the first commencement on May 31, 1888. The school became known as the South Dakota School of Mines in 1889 after admission of South Dakota as a state to the United States. The School of Mines presented exhibits during the 1904 World's Fair and the first licensed radio station in the state of South Dakota was established on campus in December 1911, a full decade before WCAT (the precursor the current campus station KTEQ-FM). The first \\"M-Day\\" homecoming celebration occurred on October 5, 1912 with the construction of the \\"M\\" on M-Hill, the school's mountain monogram. The school's ROTC battalion was formed in 1918 in response to World War I. The football stadium began construction in 1931, and was completed as \\"O'Harra Field\\" in 1938. The school formally became the South Dakota School of Mines & Technology in February 1943. In September 2012, SDSM&T; made national news when Bloomberg announced that it had passed Harvard in the category of starting salaries for graduates. On September 19, Tech President Dr. Robert A. Wharton died due to complications of cancer treatments. During the presidential search, Duane C. Hrncir was the interim president. On April 25, 2013, the School of Mines announced that Heather Wilson will become the first female president in the school's 128-year history, starting in June 2013. She resigned in 2017 after being appointed to the office of Secretary of the United States Air Force. In October 2017, the School of Mines announced that the next president would be James (Jim) Rankin, Ph.D. Academics Mines offers degrees in more than 16 engineering and science fields, as well as 12 master's degree programs and 7 Doctorate programs. Campus The campus is located on the eastern side of Rapid City, on the northern slope of small foothills of the Black Hills. South Dakota Tech currently has three residence halls: Connolly Hall, Palmerton Hall, and Peterson Hall. Connolly was built in the 1940s, Palmerton in the 1960s, and Peterson Hall in 2004. The three combined can house up to 660 students on-campus After completion of Peterson Hall, March Hall and Dake Hall (both built in the 1950s) were demolished in 2006 to make room for additional parking.

During the communist period, he worked for the Securitate. He was the chief of bodyguards of President Nicolae Ceauşescu, and served once as his stand-in (double), but was not able to protect Ceauşescu from arrest and execution during the Romanian Revolution of 1989. Ten years after the revolution, he published his understanding of the revolutionary events and his beliefs about Ceauşescu. After publishing details about the coup, he received several death threats. He declared himself proud of having served Ceauşescu, and he considers Ceauşescu to have been one of the most intelligent and greatest leaders in history.  Biography  Dumitru Burlan was born on May 11, 1939, in Licurici (Gorj County), in a family of poor peasants with seven children. In 1950, after graduating from primary school in his native village, his father brought him to Bucharest. In the capital, he was enrolled into the military school. In August 1960, at the age of 21, he was ranked as junior lieutenant in the State Security Department. In the 1960s, his hierarchical bosses were Soviet advisers or close-knits, such as Gheorghe Pintilie, alias Pantiusha Bondarenko. In 1965, when Nicolae Ceaușescu was elected head of the Romanian Communist Party; Dumitru Burlan worked in the 7th Directorate (Surveillance and Investigations) with the rank of lieutenant-major. In 1989, he had the lieutenant colonel rank, Specialist Officer I at the 5th SSD Directorate. He worked for 30 years in the Securitate, including 22 years in the 5th Directorate.

History According to James Beard's American Cookery (1972), chess pie was brought from England originally and was found in New England as well as Virginia. A recipe similar to chess pie appears in Martha Washington's Booke of Cookery, from the mid-18th century. A recipe for chess pie appeared in the 1877 cookbook by Estelle Woods Wilcox, Buckeye Cookery. Chess pie is most commonly associated as a dessert of the American South. Common types of chess pie are buttermilk, chocolate, lemon, and nut. =Etymology= The origin of the name chess pie is unknown, but many theories have been proposed. It could be a derivation of \\"cheese pie\\", the combination of eggs, butter, and sugar making a custardlike filling that is similar in texture to British cheesecakes and lemon curd; it could be named after the town of Chester, England; it could be from a piece of furniture used prior to home refrigeration called a \\"pie chest\\", in which pies were stored; or it could have come from a mangling of \\"It's just pie\\"/\\"It's jes' pie\\". Composition The basic chess pie recipe calls for the preparation of a single crust and a filling composed of flour, butter, sugar, and eggs. Some variations call for the addition of cornmeal as a stabilizing agent in the filling. Many recipes call for an acid such as vinegar, buttermilk, or lemon juice. In addition to standard chess pie, other flavor variations include lemon, coconut, and chocolate chess pie. Nut pies, including pecan, fall under the category of chess pies.

Early life Maffitt was born at sea on a ship bound for New York City, his parents having emigrated from Ireland. Maffitt's parents, Reverend John Newland Maffitt and his wife Ann Carnicke, settled with their son in Connecticut. When Maffitt was about five years old, he was adopted by his uncle, Dr. William Maffitt who traveled across the Atlantic Ocean with them, and moved to Fayetteville, North Carolina to live at the Ellerslie Plantation. United States Navy service Maffitt entered the United States Navy as a midshipman in February 1832, at the age of thirteen. He first served aboard USS St. Louis in the West Indies, and was later assigned to the Pensacola Navy Yard. In 1835 he was assigned to USS Constitution, serving as an aide to Commodore Jesse Elliott in the Mediterranean; his service aboard Constitution would later become the basis for a novel, Nautilus; or, Cruising under Canvas, published in 1871. He also served on the frigate USS Macedonian, becoming its acting Master in 1841. Maffitt was ordered to the United States Coast Survey in 1842, and was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant in 1843. He spent more than fourteen years in the hydrographic survey, chiefly in Nantucket, Massachusetts, Wilmington, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, and Savannah, Georgia. A channel in Charleston Harbor still bears his name. In 1857, Maffitt was placed in command of the brig USS Dolphin and ordered to capture pirates and slavers in the West Indies. On August 21, 1858, Dolphin captured the slaver Echo with 318 Africans on board and sent her into Charleston; the liberated slaves were later sent back to Africa. Maffitt became commander of USS Crusader in 1859 and continued his assignment to suppress slavers in the West Indies until February 7, 1861. Confederate States Navy service John Newland Maffitt as he appeared in 1863. In May 1861, with the coming of the U.S. Civil War, Maffitt resigned his U.S. Navy commission and became a First Lieutenant in the Confederate States Navy. He served as a naval aide to General Robert E. Lee while preparations for the defense of Savannah were in progress. In early 1862, Maffitt was ordered to the civilian steamer Cecile to run the blockade with supplies for the Confederacy. On August 17, 1862, he became the first commanding officer of the cruiser CSS Florida, taking her through a difficult outfitting period during which most of the ship's company was stricken with yellow fever. While in port in Cuba, Commander Maffitt himself contracted the disease. In this condition, Maffitt sailed Florida from Cárdenas, Cuba to Mobile, Alabama. With the way into Mobile Bay blocked by Union warships, Florida braved a hail of projectiles from the blockaders and raced through them to anchor beneath the guns of Fort Morgan. The bombardment from the blockaders was severe and the damage to Florida was so great that Maffitt did not return to sea for more than three months. To prevent his escape, the Union Navy increased the blockading force near Mobile. Having taken stores and gun accessories the ship lacked, along with added crew members, Maffitt waited for a violent storm before setting out on January 16, 1863. He used trickery to lose six pursuing blockaders. After coaling at Nassau, Bahamas, Florida spent 6 months off North and South America and in the West Indies, with calls at neutral ports, all the while making captures and eluding the large Federal squadron pursuing her. It was during this period that he acquired the nickname \\"Prince of Privateers\\" (which was somewhat inaccurate, since he was a naval officer and not an actual privateer.) Maffitt was promoted to the rank of Commander in May 1863 \\"for gallant and meritorious conduct in command of the steam sloop Florida.\\" Ill health due to the lingering effects of yellow fever forced him to relinquish command of Florida at Brest, France on February 12, 1864. In the summer of 1864, after returning to the Confederate States, Maffit was given command of the ironclad ram CSS Albemarle. Under Maffit's command, Albemarle dominated the Roanoke River and the approaches to Plymouth, North Carolina throughout the summer. In September, he was given command of the blockade runner CSS Owl. On October 3, Owl escaped to sea from Wilmington; the blockaders wounded her captain and several crewmen but 9 shots failed to stop them, and Owl arrived in Bermuda on October 24 with a large and valuable cargo of cotton. Maffit made several more successful runs through the Union blockade in Owl before the war ended. During his service to the Confederacy, Maffitt repeatedly ran the blockade to carry needed supplies and captured and destroyed more than seventy prizes worth $10 to $15 million. Later life At the end of the war, he refused to surrender his ship to the United States. Instead, he returned Owl to agents in Liverpool. He chose to remain in England, and, after passing the British naval examination, he served for about two years in command of the British merchant steamer Widgeon running between Liverpool and South America. He returned to the United States in 1868 and settled on a farm near Wilmington, North Carolina. In 1870, Maffit commanded a warship for Cuban revolutionaries during the Ten Years' War. Maffit died in Wilmington in 1886, leaving an unfinished manuscript about piracy in the West Indies. His collected papers are in the library of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, he was married to Philippine Welser in his first marriage. In his second marriage to Anna Juliana Gonzaga, he was the father of Anna of Tyrol, future Holy Roman Empress. Life account Archduke Ferdinand at a young ageEngraving of Ferdinand, published in New Reformierte Landts-Ordnung Der Fürstlichen Graffschafft Tyrol Wie Die Auss Lands-Fürstlichem Befelch, Im 1603 Archduke Ferdinand of Austria was the second son of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary. He was a younger brother of Emperor Maximilian II. At the behest of his father, he was put in charge of the administration of Bohemia in 1547. He also led the campaign against the Turks in Hungary in 1556. In 1557 he was secretly married to Philippine Welser, daughter of a patrician from Augsburg, with whom he had several children. The marriage was only accepted by Emperor Ferdinand I in 1559 under the condition of secrecy. The children were to receive the name \\"of Austria\\" but would only be entitled to inherit if the House of Habsburg became totally extinct in the male line, and thus the marriage had many qualities of a morganatic marriage. The sons born of this marriage received the title Margrave of Burgau, an ancient Habsburg possession in Further Austria. The younger of the sons, who survived their father, later received the princely title of Fürst zu Burgau. After his father's death in 1564, Ferdinand became the ruler of Tirol and other Further Austrian possessions under his father's will. However, he remained governor of Bohemia in Prague until 1567 according to the wishes of his brother Maximilian II. In his own lands, Ferdinand made sure that the Catholic counter- reformation would prevail. He also was instrumental in promoting the Renaissance in central Europe and was an avid collector of art. He accommodated his world-famous collections in a museum built specifically for that purpose, making Ambras Castle Innsbruck the oldest museum in the world, and as the only Renaissance Kunstkammer of its kind to have been preserved at its original location, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle Innsbruck represents an unrivalled cultural monument. The collection was started during Ferdinand's time in Bohemia and he subsequently moved it to Tyrol. In particular, the Chamber of Art and Curiosities, the gallery of portraits, and the collection of armor were very expensive, leading Ferdinand to incurred a high level of debt. Part of collections remained in Innsbruck, and part ultimately was moved to the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna. After the death of his wife Philippine in 1580, he married Anna Caterina Gonzaga, a daughter of William I, Duke of Mantua, in 1582. Archduke Ferdinand died on 24 January 1595. Since his sons from the first marriage were not entitled to the inheritance, and the second produced only surviving daughters, Tirol was reunified with the other Habsburg lands. His daughter from the Mantuan marriage to Anna Caterina (later Anna Juliana) became Holy Roman Empress Anna, consort of Emperor Mathias, who received his Further Austrian inheritance. Children Philippine Welser, Ferdinand's first wife Anne Catherine Gonzaga Ferdinand's second wife He and his first wife Philippine Welser were parents of four children: * Margrave Andrew of BurgauThe Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church - Biographical Dictionary - Consistory of 19 November 1576 (15 June 1558 – 12 November 1600).

It can exist in any kind of culture. There are various sizes of urban oases. Central Park, Frederick Law Olmsted's park in New York City, can be considered as a very large urban oasis. The Los Angeles Central Library’s plaza can be considered to be a small scaled oasis. The oasis is used by residents, workers, and visitors during everyday activities. The urban oasis offers many benefits to the community by inviting people to stop, sit, eat, play, and relax. Plant material provides shade and screens the noise of vehicular traffic while fountains help to drown out the noise pollution. The oasis adds value to cities and neighborhoods while providing identity, economic benefit, environmental benefit, and a site for cultural activities in cities. Role in the community Hastings Creek, VancouverCentral park paved parking lot transformed into urban oasis;, Vancouver Courier Identity is one of the most significant roles of an urban oasis. Great public icons like Rockefeller Center's ice-skating rink, and Central Park’s woodlands, open fields, and fountains are good examples of identifiable places in New York City. Both are well known and visited often, allowing tourists and residents to take advantage of an urban oasis. Another role of the urban oasis is to provide economic benefit to the community. Land values in a city are considerably affected by parks and surrounding attractions. The highest land values in New York City tend to be around Bryant Park, Central Park, and Riverside Park. The green-market has been a major catalyst in revitalizing the surrounding neighborhoods. The parks revitalize streets for walking, gathering, and shopping and provide economic benefits to a city. Plaza-like urban oasis features provide settings for cultural activities like farmers' markets, art galleries, and music events. They not only provide for cultural activities, but plazas also provide economic activity to the communities. One good example is the WaterFire night event in Providence, Rhode Island. During the summer and early fall, bonfires are placed just above the surface of the three rivers that pass through the middle of downtown Providence, which give out pleasing smells of aromatic wood. This, combined with live music, creates a public cultural event that brings people into a central urban area after dark while engaging the senses and emotions of those who stroll the paths and bridges of Waterplace Park. Environment Environmental benefits including the perception of a landscape as naturally beautiful, increasing plant reliability and decreasing costs, improving planting success, richer living environment, or preventing habitats, are gained from urban oases. Our appreciation of the natural environment is enhanced by vegetative parks that add open spaces and create animal and bird habitat areas. Central Park is a significant example, as it lends enormous environmental benefits to New York City.

The music genre has roots in the country as it spread in the early 1960s from the United States with the earliest versions of rock and roll during this period being cover versions or interpretative covers of already existing songs. History =1960s and 1970s= The first distinctively Italian singer-songwriter was Piero Ciampi, whose style was reminiscent of the French chansonniers. The United States and United Kingdom during the 1960s were in the midst of the psychedelic rock boom, which inspired Italian psychedelic bands such as Mario Schifano and Le Orme. At the time of the 1968 student uprisings, many young and educated Italians began to identify with the counterculture in France, Mexico, the US and across the world. Young Italians still had a well-educated familiarity with classical music composers like Bach. The result was an influx of classically influenced rock bands which fit right into the international move towards progressive rock. Italian progressive bands include: *Banco del Mutuo Soccorso *Celeste *Devil Doll *Goblin *Jacula *Latte e Miele *New Trolls *Premiata Forneria Marconi *Reale Accademia di Musica *Saint Just *Le Orme Some bands, like Osanna, Area, Perigeo and Arti & Mestieri (Arti e Mestieri), fused progressive rock with jazz, fusion and world music. Il Balletto Di Bronzo's YS is one of the most debated Italian prog-rock albums; Some calling it trash and others extolling it as one of the greatest progressive albums ever made. Another important album of the time was Arbeit macht frei by Area. They merged agit-prop lyrics, jazz-rock jamming, raw electronics, middle- eastern scales and psychotic warbling, creating an original mixture of different music styles. Area were fronted by Demetrio Stratos, one of the most original singers of his age, who recorded experimental albums entirely devoted to the human voice such as Cantare la Voce. The same period, the early 1970s, also saw the rise of Italian singers and songwriters like Lucio Battisti, Fabrizio De André, Franco Battiato, Paolo Conte and Francesco Guccini. By the end of the 1970s, Italian punk and comedy rock pioneers Skiantos had released 1978's Monotono, which kickstarted the Italian punk scene. Later bands like The Confusional Quartet and Gaznevada fused new wave and Italian varieta with punk and other influences. =1980s= In the 1980s, Italy boasted one of the most vibrant new wave, hardcore and thrash metal scenes. In the late 1980s, more extreme heavy metal bands appeared. Of these bands include: *Afterhours *CCCP Fedeli alla linea *Detonazione *Diaframma *Kirlian Camera *Litfiba *Loschi Dezi *Marlene Kuntz *Necrodeath *Negazione *Opera IX *Raw Power *Vanadium *Vasco Rossi =1990s and 2000s= In the 1990s, Italian avant- garde, alternative rock and Metal bands gained international notoriety, at least among critics. In general, the sonic model was a mixture of Big Black, Sonic Youth and Fugazi, while the themes coined a sort of neo-existentialism, very much concerned with the psychodramas of ordinary kids. Italy, the homeland of melodic music, turned out to be one of the major international centers for post-rock. Gianna Nannini in the 1970s, 1980s and into the 1990s was the first Italian rocker who achieve real popular success outside of Italy. Especially in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Benelux and later in Mexico. While Francesco De Gregori was well appreciated by critics and well- informed fans outside of Italy it was Nannini who was first Italian pop icon to stick and to shift between pop and rock with ease and to stay the course through trends and upcoming generations. Zucchero, Eros Ramazzotti and Jovanotti (later: Nek and Laura Pausini) all went on to become huge international pop names in the late 1980s and 1990s. Another Tuscana (like Nannini) Irene Grandi has had a similar journey and has a similar persona only up-to-date and even more versatile. Sadly for Irene Grandi her success has remained mostly confined to Italy. It is thus even harder for artists from countries such as Italy to get airplay in other countries in 2006 than it was in 1986.

Missionary work formally began and the largest amount of inland trade occurred at Sinkan. Name The village name of Sincan has also been recorded as Sinckan, Cinckan, Xincan, and Zinckan. The place shares the same namesake as the Sinckan language and Sinckan Manuscripts. After the Kingdom of Tungning, the name was Sinicized into Sin-kang (). History Located about north of Sakam (see Fort Provintia), Sinkan was one of the most important stations of the Dutch during the 17th century. Sinkan was the smallest of four main aboriginal villages near the Dutch base at Tayouan, with around 1,000 inhabitants. This fact led them to seek friendship and protection from the Dutch; Sinkan was the VOC's closest ally. In 1861 Consul Robert Swinhoe arrived at Taiwan-fu (modern-day Tainan) and became the first European writer to come into contact with the Taiwanese aborigines after Maurice Benyovszky in 1771. Swinhoe wrote that he was informed by a \\"thoroughly Chinese-looking\\" military officer that his ancestor was one of 3,000 Dutch soldiers remaining in the island during the reign of Koxinga (and after Dutch rule), and that his village of Sinkang was chiefly composed of the soldiers' descendants. Sinshih Township was created in 1945 as part of Sinhua District, Tainan County. In 1946, Sinshih Township was trasferred to direct administration by Tainan County and in July, the villages of Dashe and Tanding, originally part of Shanshang, were transferred to the administration of Sinshih Township. The former Sinshih District Office at No. 3, Jhongsing Street was demolished in 1983. The current Sinshih District Office at No. 12, Jhongsing Street was completed in March 1984. On December 25, 2010, Tainan City and County were merged. At the same time, Sinshih Township was renamed as Sinshih District. In May 2019, the Taiwan Power Company announced plans to build a large solar energy power facility in Tainan. At that time, the Tainan city government had recently finished a bidding process to determine contracts in several areas including Sinshih District for roof-top solar power generation.

The school was operated by the New York City Department of Education. The Taft school campus is located on Sheridan Avenue and 172nd Street in the Bronx. History Founded in the 1940s, Taft originally served the largely homogeneous population of the surrounding area. In the post-war years of the forties, fifties and sixties, famous graduates included director Stanley Kubrick, producer Jerry Weintraub, novelist Judith Rossner, and singers Eydie Gormé, Chuck Negron, Luther Vandross and Alan Merrill. Demographic and the advent of specialized magnet schools brought about shifts in enrollment. During the Abraham Beame (1974–77) and Edward Koch (1978–89) administrations, citywide, crime rates were high and unfavorable publicity accelerated the decline of the school. By the early 1970s, Taft H.S. earned a reputation as a \\"failing school\\" with many of the problems of other high schools in poor, marginalized neighborhoods in New York City. Entering the 1990s, as a non-selective high school, it was unable to compete with the newer schools housing magnet programs that attracted prime students from throughout the borough. Crime intimidated vibrant young professionals from teaching at the high school. The danger was highlighted in May 1997, when Jonathan Levin, an English teacher at the school and the son of former Time Warner chairman Gerald M. Levin, was murdered by a former student in his Manhattan apartment. Of the 629 students attending Taft in the 1990s, the majority were Hispanic and African-American. On any given day, attendance hovered around 86%. The impoverished community, lacking in political clout or a cohesive PTA, was provided 10 truancy officers, rather than improved education strategies. The last graduating class of Taft High School was in June 2008. Transformation Within the same building, the previously identified \\"failing school\\" has been transformed into a series of small specialized high schools to meet modern career needs. The specialty schools are: *Bronx High School for Medical Science *Bronx High School of Business *Bronx Collegiate Academy (formerly Bronx Expeditionary Learning High School) *Claremont International High School *DreamYard Preparatory School *Jonathan Levin High School for Media and Communications *The Urban Assembly Academy for History and Citizenship for Young Men *New Directions Secondary School Notable alumni * Eddie Carmel, born Oded Ha-Carmeili (1936–1972), Israeli-born entertainer with gigantism and acromegaly, popularly known as \\"The Jewish Giant\\" * Arthur J.

The highest role of an orderly is that of an operations assistant. An operations assistant requires people of a higher caliber who are knowledgeable in advanced medical terminology and assist with specialist surgery setups, and typically an operations assistant understands more about surgical procedures than does a registered nurse working outside of theatres. An operations assistant is a direct assistant to consultant-level doctors more than to nurses. These duties are classified as routine tasks involving no risk for the patient. Job details Orderlies are often utilized in various hospital departments. Orderly duties can range in scope depending on the area of the health care facility they are employed. For that reason, duties can range from assisting in the physical restraint of combative patients, assisting physicians with the application of casts, transporting patients, shaving patients and providing other similar routine personal care to setting up specialised hospital equipment such as bed traction arrays. Orderlies are typically found in emergency departments, operating rooms, psychiatry, long term care, and orthopaedics. Orderlies are described as non licensed hospital assistants that are instructed to perform delegated functions under the direct supervision of a licensed practitioner in the health care setting. In the US, orderlies have been phased out of health care facilities in recent years and their functions are now replaced by the patient care assistant and Certified Nursing Assistant. They remain common in Canada and other countries. Orderlies in UK hospitals were known as \\"attendants\\" (primarily in lunatic asylums), but that role has been phased out. The nearest role left to a male hospital assistant is that of porter, but that is more a logistical role, moving patients and equipment around the hospital. This is not to be confused with healthcare assistants (HCAs) who are essentially carers for patients (not qualified or licensed health care professionals), and may be of both sexes. A common set up among hospitals in Australia is seen at the Royal Adelaide Hospital in Adelaide, South Australia. At the RAH the orderly service is contracted to Spotless, a national corporation. There are around 80 orderlies employed by Spotless at the Royal Adelaide alone. Here, they are tasked with the movement of patients and equipment between wards and departments, the movement of patients from ambulances in triage, the movement of patients from MedStar retrieval helicopters that land at the hospital, the movement of deceased patients to the mortuary and various other tasks. They respond to every MET (medical emergency team) call that originates within the hospital to provide extra oxygen and so that the patient is able to be moved to another area (such as the intensive care unit) as soon as is required. The orderlies are dispatched using pager-radio combos. Some orderlies are stationed at particular departments such as radiology and theatre/recovery but most are in the \\"pool\\" and are dispatched throughout the hospital. In The Royal Brisbane and Womans Hospital in Queensland, orderlies are called patient support officers or PSOs. Controversially, PSOs are required to do all cleaning within the hospital, leading to an outcry from staff that the practice is unsafe because PSOs have to not only clean, but also take care of the patient handling, leading to a possible increase in the spread of infection. In Canada, orderlies are called Nursing assistants, PCA (personal care attendants), PSW (personal support workers) and health care aids (HCA).

Pitfield, Jr., was Chairman of the family Investment Banking firm, Pitfield, MacKay, Ross, which later merged with Dominion Securities, now the investment arm of the Royal Bank of Canada. Another brother was stockbroker Robert Hartland Pitfield (d. 2004), father of Robert H. Pitfield Jr (married to former Toronto city councillor Jane Pitfield) His nephew, Ward Elcock is the former director of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and former Deputy Minister at the Department of National Defence (Canada).  Biography  Born in Montreal, Quebec, Pitfield graduated from St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, at the age of 16. His SLU degree, in science, was followed by a degree in law from McGill University. He went to Ottawa to join the civil service in 1959 where he worked as an administrative assistant to Justice Minister E. Davie Fulton. Pitfield subsequently obtained a postgraduate degree in public law, and held various positions in the civil service. In 1966, he became assistant secretary to the Privy council and in 1969 secretary of the Division of planification. He became Clerk of the Privy Council of Canada and Secretary to the Cabinet under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau from 1975 to 1979, and again from 1980 to 1982.Pierre Trudeau ally Michael Pitfield was Canada’s top bureaucrat Globe and Mail obituary by John Gray, October 20, 2017 Because of his perceived close association with Trudeau and the Liberals, he was replaced during the ministry of Joe Clark, but returned following the 1980 election that returned Trudeau to power. As head of the public service, Pitfield played a senior role in the government's successful efforts to patriate the Canadian Constitution. In recognition of his service, he was appointed to the Canadian Senate as an independent at Trudeau's recommendation on December 22, 1982. The appointment was controversial and seen as emblematic of the growing financial, partisan and cultural issues surrounding the Ottawa civil service. Pitfield served from the mid-1980s until 2002 as vice chairman of Power Corporation, and then was Director Emeritus of the company. Pitfield's two decades of service to the University of Ottawa Heart Institute Foundation were recognized by the establishment of the Michael Pitfield Chair in Cardiac Surgery at the Institute. In later years, he developed Parkinson's disease and worked to raise awareness of the condition. Pitfield resigned from the Senate on June 1, 2010. He fathered three children (Caroline, Thomas and Kate) before his death on October 18, 2017, and was predeceased by his wife Nancy in 1999. He lived in Westmount, Quebec, for many years.

Peeler re-settled with his family in Victoria, and was appointed the inaugural custodian of Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance in 1934. In May 1940, Peeler enlisted for service in the Second World War, understating his age by fourteen years to avoid the upper age limit imposed on volunteers. He was posted to the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion and initially saw action in the Syria-Lebanon Campaign. However, with the entry of Japan into the war, his unit was one of the first sent to the Netherlands East Indies in early 1942. Originally destined for Sumatra it was diverted to Java and after disembarking assisted in the Dutch defence of the island. When Dutch resistance collapsed in March, allied forces in Java signed a formal surrender with British, Australian and American troops becoming prisoners of war. After three-and-a-half years as prisoner of war, Peeler was freed in August 1945 and returned to Australia in October, resuming his duties at the Shrine of Remembrance. He retired in 1964 and, aged 80, died at his home in South Caulfield on 23 May 1968. Early life Walter \\"Wally\\" Peeler was born at Barker's Creek, near Castlemaine, Victoria, on 9 August 1887. He was the eighth child of William Peeler, a farmer and miner, and his English-born wife Mary Ellen (née Scott). As a youth Peeler worked in his parent's orchard, before gaining employment with Thompson's Foundry in Castlemaine. On 10 July 1907, he wed Emma Hewitt; the couple were to have five children. An active sportsman, Peeler was a member of the Castlemaine Cricket Club and, briefly, secretary of the Wesley Hill Football Club. First World War HMAT Wandilla at Port Melbourne. By 1916, Peeler was living in the Melbourne suburb of Richmond with his wife and three daughters. On 17 February, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force for service in the First World War. Posted as a private soldier to the machine gun section of the 3rd Pioneer Battalion, Peeler underwent his initial training in Victoria, before departing from Melbourne headed for England aboard HMAT Wandilla on 6 June. The battalion arrived in Plymouth seven weeks later. During the three months Peeler's unit spent in England undergoing additional training, he was charged with being absent without leave for six hours on 3 July, and fined a day's pay. He was nevertheless promoted to lance corporal on 6 November. Two weeks later, the 3rd Pioneer Battalion was posted to the Western Front. Sent to the Armentières sector, the battalion spent several months working on trench and railway construction. In mid-December, Peeler attended a week-long course at the Machine Gun School in Le Touquet, and in early 1917, accompanied the battalion north in preparation for the upcoming Messines offensive. However, on 8 May 1917, one month before the offensive, Peeler found himself the subject of a court-martial in the field. Following an incident that occurred during a training session on 26 April, he was charged with \\"careless and negligent handling of a Lewis Gun whilst instructing\\" that led to \\"grievous bodily injury\\" to Private John Martin Fife. Found guilty of the charge, Peeler was stripped of his lance corporal stripe. On 7 June 1917, Peeler participated in the initial assault on Messines Ridge. Manning a Lewis Gun during the action, he was injured twice, suffering shrapnel wounds to his face and eye from an artillery shell, and a gunshot wound to his right cheek. He spent three days in hospital before returning to his battalion. On 22 June, he was once again promoted to lance corporal. The 3rd Pioneer Battalion spent the next four months in a quieter section of the front. =Victoria Cross= Sergeant Peeler c. 1918 As part of the third stage of General Sir Herbert Plumer's Passchendaele offensive, an attack against Broodseinde was scheduled for 4 October 1917. The 3rd Australian Division's 10th Australian Infantry Brigade was one of the assault formations charged with delivering the main blow, and ultimately with seizing the heavily defended Broodseinde Ridge. To provide defence against low-flying German aircraft during the attack, a group of 24 men, including Peeler, from the 3rd Pioneer Battalion's machine gun section were attached to the 10th Brigade's 37th Battalion. The attack on Broodseinde began at 06:00 under the cover of an artillery barrage. Armed with a Lewis Gun, Peeler advanced with the initial wave. The Australians rapidly crossed the first before becoming pinned down by a party of nine German soldiers, who were situated in a shellhole and sniping at the advancing troops. Firing his machine gun from the hip, Peeler dashed forward across the exposed ground and shot the group of Germans, \\"clearing the way for the advance\\". He performed similar feats on two subsequent occasions, killing several German soldiers and emerging unscathed. The Australian force continued to press their assault, encountering pillboxes and machine gun positions as they pushed forward. One such machine gun position, situated in the open, held up the advance. Firing a single burst from his Lewis Gun, Peeler killed the gunner and caused the remainder of the gun's defenders to seek cover in a nearby dugout. One of the Australians then lobbed a \\"well aimed\\" grenade into the dugout, driving out ten soldiers whom Peeler then shot. Described as being \\"particularly prominent in the advance\\" by historian Charles Bean, Peeler \\"almost single-handedly\\" destroyed four German posts in an hour, accounting for more than 30 soldiers. Australian Victoria Cross recipients repatriated to Australia to assist in recruitment pictured on HMAT Medic with three naval officers. Peeler is standing at left. By 07:15 the following morning, the 37th Battalion had captured its objective, having seized eight pillboxes, several concrete dugouts, 20 machine guns and 420 prisoners. Two hours later, the Australians were in possession of Broodseinde Ridge. For his actions during the battle, Peeler was awarded the Victoria Cross; one of two Australians to be so decorated that day. On 12 October, eight days after Peeler's actions, the men of the 10th Brigade returned to the front line in an effort to exploit the success of the previous week. The ground in front of their position was dominated by a series of German pillboxes and had been turned into a quagmire by heavy rain. The brigade's attack was soon subject to a \\"torrent of machine gun fire\\", and Peeler was severely wounded in his right arm. Initially evacuated to the 11th Australian Field Ambulance casualty station, it was decided that his wound necessitated treatment in England so he embarked for the Northampton War Hospital on 15 October, arriving the following day. While recuperating in England, the announcement and accompanying citation for Peeler's Victoria Cross was promulgated in a supplement to the London Gazette on 26 November 1917, reading: Studio portrait of Sergeant Walter Peeler c. 1918 =Recuperation and repatriation= As news of Peeler's decoration spread, it prompted a \\"wave of celebrations\\" in his hometown of Castlemaine; flags flew in his honour, and one of his daughters was cheered by fellow pupils at her school. On 8 January 1918, Peeler was formally conferred with his Victoria Cross by King George V in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace. Having sufficiently recovered from his wound, Peeler rejoined the 3rd Pioneer Battalion in France on 17 May; he was promoted to temporary corporal two weeks later. On 22 June 1918, Peeler was posted to the Corps Gas School for eight days. He was promoted to sergeant on 30 July. Around this time, Australian Prime Minister Billy Hughes invited Australia's Victoria Cross recipients of the war to return to Australia and assist in a recruiting drive. Among the group who accepted the offer, Peeler was one of ten who embarked for Melbourne aboard HMAT Medic on 24 August, arriving in Melbourne seven weeks later. He would not return to France; on 11 November 1918 an armistice with Germany was declared, effectively ending the war. Peeler was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 10 December. Inter-war years Following his discharge, Peeler gained employment with the soldier-settler branch of the Victorian Department of Lands. He remained with the department for six years, before acquiring an orchard in the Castlemaine district. However, this venture proved short-lived and he soon returned with his family to Melbourne, joining the H.V. McKay Sunshine Harvester Works at Sunshine. Also on the company's staff was a fellow Victoria Cross recipient, Dominic McCarthy. When Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance was completed in 1934, Peeler was appointed as the memorial's first custodian. He occupied this post for next 30 years, coming to regard the Shrine as \\"his second home\\". Second World War =Enlistment and Syrian Campaign= Warrant Officer Peeler leads his company of ex-prisoners of war in the salute of Major Green, Commanding Officer of 2/4th Machine Gun Battalion. On 27 May 1940, Peeler enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force for service in the Second World War, giving his date of birth on his enlistment forms as 9 August 1901, thus understating his age by fourteen years. At 52, Peeler was twelve years over the maximum age limit, although he later claimed he was not the \\"oldest fellow in my unit\\". Granted the acting rank of sergeant, he was allotted to the newly raised 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion. The battalion completed its initial training at Puckapunyal, during which time Peeler was made acting staff sergeant and Company Quartermaster Sergeant of D Company on 1 August. On 7 April 1941, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion embarked aboard HMT Queen Mary at Sydney, bound for the Middle East; Peeler's rank of staff sergeant was confirmed as substantive on the same day. After just under four weeks at sea, the troopship disembarked at Port Tewfik in Suez, where the battalion entrained for Palestine. There it was attached to the 7th Division in support of the Syrian campaign against Vichy French forces. The 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was initially divided up, with each company attached to a different brigade of the 7th Division. Peeler's D Company—assigned to the 25th Brigade—was originally tasked with the maintenance and general repair of the road network in its locality. However, when the Vichy French launched a counter-attack on 15 June, the battalion was concentrated in the Merdjayoun area in an effort to prevent any further French gains. On the night of 27 June, after a costly assault against the Vichy French at Merdjayoun earlier that day, Peeler led out a patrol to recover the wounded. Four soldiers were discovered and brought back to the Australian lines. Despite suffering heavy casualties in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion served throughout the campaign, including participation in the decisive Battle of Damour in July. After the Vichy French defeat in Syria, the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion was relocated to Tripoli, Lebanon where it headquartered itself in an olive grove while carrying out training and garrison duties over the next four months. During November, the battalion was moved to Qatana in Syria, but with the entry of Japan into the war in late 1941, the 1st Australian Corps including the 6th and 7th Divisions were directed to move to the Netherlands East Indies for service in the Pacific theatre. In January 1942, Peeler was among the men of the 2/2nd Pioneer Battalion who embarked aboard HMT Orcades for Sumatra but later diverted to Java. He was promoted to Warrant Officer Class II during this time. =Defence of Java and prisoner of war= Peeler playing with three-year-old Ferne Pope on the deck of HMS Highland Brigade during his journey back to Australia, after three years as a prisoner of war. With the rapid Japanese advance through the Pacific and the fall of Singapore in February 1942, the 3,400 troops aboard Orcades were diverted from Sumatra to Java in the Dutch East Indies. Disembarking at Batavia on 18 February, Peeler's battalion was combined with the other units aboard Orcades to form Blackforce. This ad hoc grouping, under the command of fellow Victoria Cross holder Brigadier Arthur Blackburn, was tasked with defending a series of airfields and supporting the Dutch. Blackburn organised his men into a brigade formation, consisting of a headquarters and three infantry battalions—the men of the 2/2nd Pioneers made up the bulk of Blackforce's 2nd Battalion. On 28 February 1942, elements of the Imperial Japanese Army landed on Java. Blackforce was stationed at Buitenzorg, poised to advance west to confront the invaders. However, rapid Japanese progress pushed the defending Dutch forces in the opposite direction, and Blackforce was assigned the defence of Buitenzorg and Leuwiliang. As the situation deteriorated further, Blackburn was forced to withdraw his men east on the night of 4/5 March, and again on 7/8 March. On 8 March, the Dutch surrendered, ordering all men to lay down their arms. With supplies running low and unable to contact the Australian Government, Brigadier Blackburn announced the surrender of Blackforce four days later. Peeler and his fellow soldiers thus became prisoners of war. At the time, he was one of three Australian Victoria Cross recipients of the First World War serving overseas, all of whom were \\"swept up in the Japanese advance\\"; Blackburn surrendered with Peeler at Java, while Walter Brown was caught up in the fall of Singapore, where he is believed to have been killed attempting to evade capture. Peeler was among a contingent of Australian captives transported to work on the Burma Railway. Despite the \\"harsh treatment\\" meted out by the Japanese, he later played down his ordeal, stating: \\"I wasn't treated too badly, apart from nearly starving ... But what the Japs did to the others on the railway was pretty horrifying\\". After three- and-a-half years incarceration, he was freed following the Japanese capitulation in August 1945 and the subsequent liberation of prisoner-of-war camps in the Pacific. On 6 October, Peeler embarked for Australia aboard HMS Highland Brigade; he arrived in Melbourne fifteen days later. Back in Australia, he learned that his son, Donald, by his second marriage, had been killed in action on the island of Bougainville on 31 December 1944, while serving with the 15th Battalion. Donald Peeler was posthumously Mentioned in Despatches for his \\"distinguished service in the South-West Pacific Area\\". Warrant Officer Class II Walter Peeler was discharged from the Second Australian Imperial Force on 12 December 1945. Later life and legacy Walter Peeler's medals at the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Peeler resumed his duties as custodian of the Shrine of Remembrance on his discharge, guiding visitors around the memorial. In the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours, his \\"long and dedicated service\\" at the Shrine was recognised with the award of the British Empire Medal. He retired three years later at the age of 76, stating: \\"It's time I had a rest.\\" In 1966, Peeler was interviewed for a newspaper article; when queried on his Victoria Cross exploit, he recalled: On 23 May 1968, Peeler died at his home in South Caulfield, Victoria. Survived by his second wife, Kathleen, his first wife Emma pre deceased him in 1964, and his four remaining children, one by his first wife and three by his second, he was buried in Brighton Cemetery. Kathleen died the following year. Peeler is commemorated in the Victorian Garden of Remembrance, and a soldiers' club in Casula, New South Wales, bears his name. His Victoria Cross and other medals are on display in the Hall of Valour at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra.

It was produced in the UK and available in some other countries including Finland, Ireland, France, Spain, Denmark, Australia and New Zealand. In Germany, Italy, Belgium and the Netherlands, it is known as Star Quest. It is a sister game to HeroQuest, which was also produced by Milton Bradley and Games Workshop. It uses many of the concepts of the Games Workshop's Space Hulk and Warhammer 40,000 games, but at a much simpler level of game play. The game was designed by Steven Baker. The original box artwork was by Jim Burns, and the later edition had a cover by David Sque. Gameplay The game is designed to be played with 2 to 4 players, taking turns until one wins. One player takes the role of the aliens, controlling all the aliens and monsters on the space hulk, which were a mixture of Chaos, Orks, Genestealers and other aliens from Warhammer 40,000. The alien player takes on a significantly reduced role compared with that of a Game Master in traditional role-playing games, with its sole role being to stop the marine players from accomplishing their missions. The other players are marine players, and each controls a squad of 5 Space Marines in standard power armour, one of whom is a Commander. Each squad is further equipped with order commands as well as equipment cards. Marines can be armed with different weapons: light weapons allow marines to move faster at the cost of reduced firepower. Heavy weapons operate in special ways, such as being able to hit all units in a horizontal line, or attacking multiple targets. The blue squad represents the Ultramarines, the red squad represents the Blood Angels, and the yellow squad represents the Imperial Fists. All three are founding chapters of the Space Marines, and the chapter can be recognized by the insignia on the slider board, and accurately represents the standard colors of the Warhammer 40,000 versions. Each of the chapters are identical, although the equipment cards for the Blood Angels are specialised in close combat, and the Imperial Fists in use of ranged heavy weapons. Close range combat rules are enforced when two units engaging are next to each other; the controlling player of the two units in combat roll whatever number of dice allowed for that unit, and the highest wins. Otherwise, ranged combat rules are followed so long as there is line of sight between the two squares that each unit is occupying: the firing player rolls dice for the weapon being fired, and if the die total is above the armour value of the target, it is dealt hit points. The squad-based system gives each player greater access for strategy and planning. Most of the game is careful calculations of avoiding line of sight, and rushing to attack either from around the corridor, through open doors, or close in with close combat. The mission based system sometimes allows a player to sacrifice units to score points in order to win. The marine players have the advantage of heavy weapons, special equipment and high armour point values due to their power armour, while the alien player has the advantage of large numbers of pieces and random \\"Alien Event\\" cards which may be detrimental to his opponents. The marine Commanders have multiple Hit Points and special weapons, making them harder to kill. Each game consists of the marine players receiving their primary mission, docking and entering the space hulk (and later dreadnought factories), completing their mission before the other marine players, and returning their team back to the docking claw. Points are scored for units killed and missions completed, deducted for units lost. Players with sufficient points at the end of the game (including the Alien Player) can be promoted to the next rank, which gives them access to additional order or equipments for the subsequent games.  German Edition  The German version of the game was published under the name StarQuest to tie-in with Hero-Quest, which, at that time, was very popular amongst German children. The translation tones down most of the violent game elements: The aliens are \\"chaos robots\\", not living creatures. A player does not kill a robot, the robot is merely removed from this dimension or gets caught by the effects of the weapons and is not harmed at all. Although for example the \\"Assault Cannon\\" can quite easily be recognized as a type of machine gun, in the German version it is called \\"Zero Time Gun\\" and its effect is explained as \\"time bubbles\\" slowing down the enemy. =Box contents= Space Crusade had a large number of components. The list below is included as both a reference and as an indication of quite how comprehensive the game was. *50 figures - 3 Marine Commanders - 12 Space Marines, 8 Orks, 14 Gretchin, - 3 Genestealers - 1 Chaos Marine Commander, - 4 Chaos Space Marines, 4 Androids and - 1 Dreadnought *64 Playing Cards - Three sets of 12 Chapter cards and 28 Alien event cards *32 blip tokens *12 rank badges *6 honour badges *1 Alien control panel *24 doors *6 combat dice *3 marine reference charts *32 reinforcement counters *1 primary mission token *1 secondary mission token *4 marks of Chaos *4 piece gameboard with walls *3 marine landing docks with airlocks (extra board pieces where the space marines start) *3 Commander Scanners with Slides *Rule book *24 page Mission Manual *Advanced rules book Expansion games and sequels =Eldar Attack= A boxed expansion set that introduced Eldar with special abilities including psychic powers. This expansion pack allowed one extra player to control the Eldar miniatures, thus allowing the game to be played by 2-5 people. =Mission Dreadnought= A boxed expansion set. This expansion pack gives the marine player access to additional space marine miniatures, boosting the squad to 6 space marines and the commander. Space marines may carry extra heavy weapons or the tarantula mobile turret. The alien player gains extra heavy dreadnoughts, which are extremely powerful and capable of wiping out an entire squad. The last mission in the additional mission book allows the alien player to continuously construct additional dreadnoughts for more firepower from the dreadnought factory board. The additional bulkhead doors and corridor tiles allow players to build more interesting board constructions, whereas the initial game is quite limited to either the square 2x2 mode or the long 4x1 mode. =White Dwarf= Two articles about Space Crusade were published in White Dwarf: one for using Terminators, Space Marine Scouts, Ork Mobs, Tyranids and Genestealer Hybrids (White Dwarf 134, 1991), allowing players to use Warhammer 40,000 miniatures, and one campaign called 'Renegade' (White Dwarf 145, 1992). =Advanced Space Crusade= Advanced Space Crusade was a modular board game published in 1990 by Games Workshop. The premise of the game is that a number of Space Marine scout squads are boarding a Tyranid ship in order to sabotage its delicate internal \\"organs\\". The game is superficially similar to Space Hulk in that it uses 28 mm plastic Citadel Miniatures as play pieces, uses modular board pieces to represent the innards of the Hive ship, and has one player controlling the Marines while the other controls waves of Tyranids, but has no greater relationship to Space Crusade than any other game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe. Without the license from Milton Bradley, many of the components of Advanced Space Crusade were released in 1993's Tyranid Attack, a substantially different game. Video game Gremlin Graphics Software Ltd. released the Space Crusade video game version of the game in early 1992. It was available on Atari ST, IBM PC (MS-DOS), Amiga, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 64 and Amstrad and later received an expansion, The Voyage Beyond. It is considered a faithful conversion of the boardgame, with a board that could be viewed in 2D or isometric projection views (Barker, 1992). The ZX Spectrum version was voted number 24 in the Your Sinclair Readers' Top 100 Games of All Time.

Starting in the 1950s, rock music was imported from the United States of America, where it was becoming extremely popular. Danish jazz artists began adopting the rock genre. Towards the end of the 1950s and throughout the 1960s, Danish rock was heavily influenced by British music, one of the genres being R&B.; By the end of the 1960s, Danish rock was again being influenced by American rock. During the 1980s, Danish rock consisted mainly of pop-rock bands. In the current Danish rock scene, Indie rock is very popular. Historical development Denmark is a European country that began importing popular American rock and roll music in the 1950s, when that style was conquering audiences across the continent. Danish jazz and dance bands and soloists like Ib Jensen, Otto Brandenburg, Peter Plejl and Ib Glindemann brought the style to Danish listeners. At the end of the decade, the English band The Shadows was a major influence on the first pioneers of the era, The Cliffters and The Rocking Ghosts. In the early 1960s, British R&B; and beat bands inspired Danish counterparts like The Hitmakers, Sir Henry & His Butlers, The Defenders and The Beefeaters, as well as the breakthrough band Steppeulvene, whose 1967 LP Hip revolutionized the field of Danish rock by fusing American folk rock. Young Flowers was the first rock trio; some of their songs were in Danish language, but several others were adaptions of Walt Whitman lyrics. Jazz bands like Blue Sun, Burnin Red Ivanhoe, Secret Oyster and Maxwells also moved towards rock. At the close of the decade, much of the rock world was incorporating sociopolitical lyrics, along with the rise of the counterculture. Denmark's contribution to this field included Gasolin, Jomfru Ane Band and Røde Mor. Among middle-aged and older Danes, schlager-resembling Danish folk rock was gaining popularity those days, chiefly artists like John Mogensen, Otto Brandenburg and Kim Larsen. By the 1980s, however, pop-rock bands like Sneakers, Anne Linnet, Sebastian and Lis Sørensen were popular, alongside punk-influenced Miss B. Haven, TV-2, Sort Sol and Kliché. Best selling was the cowpunk band, D-A-D, who in the late eighties turned into a Ronnie James Dio inspired Heavy Metal band. The following decade saw the rise of pop bands like Michael Learns to Rock, Safri Duo and Aqua, guitar rock bands like Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, Kashmir and Psyched Up Janis. The current Danish rock scene is dominated by indie influences in bands such as Mike Tramp (formerly singer in White Lion, Freak of Nature and Mabel, The Raveonettes, and Mew. Other popular Danish rock groups include Iceage, Sort Sol (Black sun), VETO, Figurines, Kira and The Kindred Spirits, Carpark North, Saybia, Tim Christensen, The Floor Is Made of Lava and the Danish folk metal band Svartsot. Some hard rock bands to come out of Denmark are Volbeat, Red Warszawa, Mercenary, Mercyful Fate (later King Diamond), Artillery, Pretty Maids and Royal Hunt. For alternative rock, Cryoshell started out in affiliation with LEGO, gaining it some market. A popular newer Danish band is Nephew, who play a blend of indie and electro rock and utilize a mixture of Danish and English lyrics. Famous Danish rock musicians are among other Lars Ulrich, the drummer and co-founder of Metallica, and Mike Tramp, the vocalist and co-songwriter of White Lion. More extreme Danish metal bands include Mnemic, Illdisposed, Illnath, Corpus Mortale, Panzerchrist, Konkhra, Hatesphere, Marodium, Nortt and Iniquity. Festivals The annual Roskilde Festival is held in Danish city of Roskilde. The festival is the second-largest in Europe with ticket sales normally running from 70,000 to 100,000. The festival has featured many prominent artists (mainly rock), such as Nirvana, Guns N' Roses, U2, Bob Dylan, Black Sabbath and Green Day, and there has also been an emphasis on world music, alternative genres and Danish music at the festival. In 2000, the festival suffered a terrible accident during a Pearl Jam concert where 9 people were crushed by the wild crowds, making security a primary issue of the following festivals. The festival has since avoided any other incidents of this kind.

Although Vian despised rock and wrote these songs as attacks, they are highly acclaimed by French critics today and considered precursors. The first real French rock acts emerged at the end of the decade and in the beginning of the 1960s, with Johnny Hallyday achieving the most long-lasting success, while other acts like Les Chaussettes noires, led by other French rock star Eddy Mitchell, and Les Chats sauvages (led by Dick Rivers) contributed to the emergence of the genre, the last band writing the first real classic French rock song, Twist à Saint-Tropez. The emergence of the yé-yé movement slowed the commercial success of French rock, although some names like Antoine, Jacques Dutronc, Nino Ferrer and Michel Polnareff emerged in the middle of the 1960s and did have success, while others like Ronnie Bird or Les Variations (who are commonly considered forerunners of French hard rock) achieved cult status. In the 1970s, France saw the arrival of Alan Stivell's Breton folk-rock as well as a wave of progressive rock bands like Ange, Magma, Gong (whether they are actually a French band is debatable), Triangle, Dynastie Crisis, Shylock, Eskaton, Atoll and Pulsar. There was also some glam rock acts, like The Frenchies or the controversial and cult artist Alain Kan. Jacques Higelin's album BBH 75, which doesn't fit in these categories and is more of a transitional album between the classic era rock sound (à la Rolling Stones) and punk rock, is considered a seminal milestone by French critics, while ex-yé-yé star Christophe became a successful pop-rock artist, especially with his seminal albums Les Paradis perdus and Les Mots bleus (which title song is considered a major classic). French punk rock also appeared, including bands like Starshooter, Stinky Toys,* Electric Callas, Oberkampf and Métal Urbain. It was during this period that a few other variety music artists - Catherine Ribeiro, Bernard Lavilliers and others - flirted with rock, but without completely changing over. However, French singer Serge Gainsbourg's 70s output, which included the classic Histoire de Melody Nelson, the less accessible L'Homme à tête de chou and the reggae Aux armes et cætera, transitioned completely from chanson to rock (a move he started earlier in the 1960s) and offered French-language rock new classics. Another name to know is that of Gérard Manset, a cult artist who deliberately live in maintained obscurity, but whose ballad Il voyage en solitaire is a major song and progressive album La Mort d'Orion is a reference, and who has continued to collaborate with high-profile artists up to this day. French hard rock and heavy metal took off by the end of the decade, spearheaded by Trust. Things changed course in the 1980s. The changing of the political culture was accompanied by an explosion in youth culture. This helped the emergence of a distinct French rock that could match the lucrativeness of American and British rock music. French progressive rock continued in the 1980s in relative obscurity, with the bands Dün, Terpandre and Emeraude achieving some underground success (but were met with critical indifference). The success of Téléphone (pub rock), which started in the 1970s but peaked in the 1980s, also took French rock to new levels. The new wave was dominated by Indochine, who sold enormously, as well as Alain Chamfort, overshadowing the works of critical darlings Taxi Girl or Jacno, but the genre also later saw the emergence of Étienne Daho, who would remain a major figure in French music up to this day. Another notable artist from the early 1980s is Axel Bauer, who scored a massive hit with the song Cargo. Charlélie Couture also marked its time withComme un avion sans aile. The post-punk scene, although commercially unsuccessful, also featured critically acclaimed acts, such as Marquis de Sade, Hubert-Félix Thiéfaine, Orchestre rouge or Kas Product. The art rock band Les Rita Mitsouko enjoyed international success, while the decade also saw the emergence of Alain Bashung, who had been around since the 1960s but only started to have his first hits in the new wave era. Bashung would become the most critically acclaimed French rock singer in his home country, with several of his albums being now hailed as classics. There was also a second wave of French punk rock which included such acts as Bérurier Noir, Les Négresses Vertes, Les Garçons Bouchers, Les Wampas, Les Satellites or the seminal Mano Negra, which would make the genre evolve towards worldbeat (and whose leader Manu Chao would later have a worldwide successful solo career). The first major French indie rock act appeared: Les Thugs, who are considered a major reference of the scene up to this day. Finally, French hard rock and heavy metal really took shape in this decade, with the continuing success of Trust or that of other bands like ADX, Warning, Shakin' Street, Sortilège or Vulcain, and some early thrash-death metal acts like Agressor, Loudblast or Morsüre. The 1990s, still dominated by Bashung's aura and output (including Osez Joséphine and the major classic Fantaisie militaire), also saw the emergence of Noir Désir (their first classic album, Veuillez rendre l'âme (à qui elle appartient) dated back from the late 80s), whose sound fitted well in the grunge movement, and their 1992 album Tostaky was a huge popular and critical success, still selling solidly decades after its release. French rock was dominated by punk (No One Is Innocent), funk (-M-, FFF, Sinclair) and Noir Désir-soundalikes like Aston Villa or Saez (a trend which would continue in the 2000s with Luke, Eiffel or Déportivo, for instance). The very popular Louise Attaque refined the Noir Désir sound to fit a more indie folk approach, which would still allow them to achieve enormous sales. More on the indie scene, Diabologum and later its offshoots Expérience and Programme would become leaders, with a sound influenced by Pavement's approach. Other notable artists include Dominique A and Miossec who would sport a more minimalistic approach, pop bands Billy ze Kick et les Gamins en Folie, Les Innocents or L'Affaire Louis' Trio, and post-rock band Kat Onoma. Pop-rock artists Alain Souchon, Laurent Voulzy and Francis Cabrel, although they had been around since the 1970s, enjoyed major commercial success during this period. French heavy metal saw the emergence of the cult black metal scene of the Légions Noires with Vlad Tepes, Mütiilation, Belkètre or Torgeist and other acts not associated with it like Blut Aus Nord and Belenos, and some nu metal acts on the course of the decade, including Mass Hysteria, Lofofora, Eths or Pleymo. The 2000s would see, alongside bands still influenced by Noir Désir, a dilution of the rock sound, with acts like Benjamin Biolay or Phoenix incorporating rock in their music, while being closer to chanson for the former (in a Dominique A-influenced approach) and French touch for the latter. Other chanson-affiliated artists flirting with rock include Jeanne Cherhal, Keren Ann, La Grande Sophie, Camille, Anaïs, Cali, Raphael, Bénabar and ex-Les Innocents leader J. P. Nataf, and artists more specifically influenced by Biolay include Florent Marchet, Arman Méliès, Bertrand Belin and Albin de la Simone. It also saw the reemergence of ex-new wave patriarchs Indochine as an emo-influenced band, with their album Paradize selling enormously and becoming a new classic. The decades-old French heavy metal would enjoy an international emergence, with acts like Gojira or AqME, while the underground black metal scene would keep on striving with bands like Deathspell Omega, Peste Noire or the more experimental Alcest. On the indie rock scene, Dionysos would become extremely popular with their hit Song for Jedi from their best-seller Western sous la neige, while other acts like A.S. Dragon or Ultra Orange would have more confidential success. Indie acts Yelle and M83 would achieve most of their success abroad. The second half of the decade would see the emergence of a French garage rock revival scene, with BB Brunes, Plastiscines, the Cheeraks, Crash Normal, the Normals, Naast, Izïa, Alister, Mademoiselle K or Stuck in the Sound. In the 2010s, notable acts include the art rock/new wave outfit La Femme and Christine and the Queens, and French comedy electro-rock band Shaka Ponk also started to achieve major hits. Other notable acts include indie rock band Frànçois & the Atlas Mountains (who were active since 2005 but started to obtain critical acclaim this decade, although achieving most of their success abroad), Britpop-influenced Archimède, pop artist Arnaud Fleurent-Didier or art rock band Moodoïd.

Samuel Alito is sworn in as an Associate Justice by Chief Justice John Roberts in the East Room of the White House on the day after his confirmation, February 1, 2006. Speculation abounded over potential nominations to the Supreme Court of the United States by President George W. Bush since before his presidency. In the summer of 2005, this speculation became newsworthy due to the announcement of the retirement of Associate Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on July 1. President Bush announced federal appellate judge John Roberts as O'Connor's replacement on July 19. On September 5, two days after the death of Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Bush renominated Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on September 29, 2005.U.S. Senate Roll Call Votes – Nomination of John Roberts, senate.gov. On October 3, Bush nominated White House Counsel Harriet Miers to succeed O'Connor. However, Miers withdrew her nomination on October 27 after facing significant opposition. On October 31, Bush nominated another federal appellate judge, Samuel Alito, as his new choice to replace O'Connor. Alito was confirmed as the 110th Justice of the Supreme Court on January 31, 2006.James L. Gibson, and Gregory A. Caldeira, \\"Confirmation politics and the legitimacy of the US Supreme Court: Institutional loyalty, positivity bias, and the Alito nomination.\\" American Journal of Political Science 53.1 (2009): 139-155 online.  Overview  Throughout much of the history of the United States, the Supreme Court of the United States was clearly the least powerful branch of the government, and nominations to that body, although important, were not the source of great political controversy as they are today. Until the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist in 2005, the composition of the Supreme Court had remained unchanged since 1994, the second longest time period without a membership change in U.S. history (the longest having been from 1812–1823). Furthermore, the current court has been sharply divided on a number of high- profile issues, including abortion rights, affirmative action, the extent of Congressional power under the Commerce Clause, eminent domain, gay rights, the separation of church and state under the Establishment Clause, sovereign immunity, and states' rights. The number of close votes in cases involving these areas suggests that a change of one or two key justices could completely shift the thinking of the Court on such issues. Politics When asked about the kind of justices he would appoint to the Supreme Court, President George W. Bush responded: \\"I would pick people that would be strict constructionists. We've got plenty of lawmakers in Washington, D.C. Legislators make law. Judges interpret the Constitution. ... And that's the kind of judge I'm going to put on there.\\" In more detail, Bush in 1999 told reporter Fred Barnes of the conservative magazine The Weekly Standard that he would nominate judges to the court in the mold of originalist Justice Antonin Scalia.The Weekly Standard: BUSH SCALIA July 5, 1999. =The filibuster= Soon after President Bush's first inauguration in January 2001, many liberal academics became worried that he would begin packing the federal judiciary with conservative jurists. Yale law professor Bruce Ackerman, writing in the February 2001 edition of The American Prospect, encouraged the use of the filibuster to stop Bush from placing any nominee on the Supreme Court during his first term.Ackerman, Bruce. The Court Packs Itself , The American Prospect, February 21, 2001. In addition, law professors Cass Sunstein (University of Chicago) and Laurence Tribe (Harvard), along with Marcia Greenberger of the National Women's Law Center, counseled Senate Democrats in April 2001 \\"to scrutinize judicial nominees more closely than ever.\\" Specifically, they said, \\"there was no obligation to confirm someone just because they are scholarly or erudite.\\"Washington Talk: Democrats Readying for Judicial Fight, The New York Times, May 1, 2001. On May 9, 2001, President Bush announced his first eleven court of appeals nominees in a special White House ceremony.President Bush Announces Federal Judicial Appointees, May 9, 2001. There was immediate concern expressed by Senate Democrats and liberal groups like the Alliance for Justice.No Rush to Judges, The Nation, May 17, 2001.Judicial Selection During the Bush Administration , Alliance for Justice, 2008. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said that the White House was \\"trying to create the most ideological bench in the history of the nation.\\"Lewis, Neil A. Bush to Nominate 11 to Judgeships Today, The New York Times, May 9, 2001. From June 2001 to January 2003, when the Senate was controlled by the Democrats, the most conservative appellate nominees were stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee and never given hearings or committee votes.Gaziano, Todd F. A Diminished Judiciary: The Causes and Effects of the Sustained High Vacancy Rates in the Federal Courts , The Heritage Foundation, Oct 10, 2002. However, after the 2002 mid-term elections in which the Republicans regained control of the Senate by a 51–49 margin, these same nominees began to be moved through the now Republican- controlled Judiciary Committee.Threadgill, Susan. Who's Who, The Washington Monthly, March, 2003. With no other way to block confirmation, the Senate Democrats started to filibuster judicial nominees when they came before the full Senate for final consideration. This forced supporters of the nomination to move to invoke cloture, which, if agreed to by a three-fifths supermajority vote, would allow debate to end and force a final vote on confirmation. On February 12, 2003, Miguel Estrada, a nominee for the D.C. Circuit, became the first court of appeals nominee ever to be filibustered.O'Brien, Tim. Democrats begin filibuster against Estrada, CNN, Feb 13, 2003 Later, nine other conservative court of appeals nominees were also filibustered. These nine were Priscilla Owen, Charles W. Pickering, Carolyn Kuhl, David McKeague, Henry Saad, Richard Allen Griffin, William H. Pryor Jr., William Myers III and Janice Rogers Brown.Failed Cloture Votes on President Bush’s Nominees, abanet.org. Three of the nominees (Estrada, Pickering and Kuhl) withdrew their nominations before the end of the 108th Congress. =The \\"nuclear option\\"= As a result of these ten filibusters, Senate Republicans began to threaten to change the existing Senate rules by using what Senator Trent Lott termed the \\"nuclear option\\". This change in rules would eliminate the use of the filibuster to prevent judicial confirmation votes. However, with only a two- vote majority, the Republicans were in a weak position to implement this procedural maneuver. Circumstances changed in 2005, due to the 2004 elections. With President Bush winning re-election and the Republicans increasing their Senate majority to 55–45 for the 109th Congress, the \\"nuclear option\\" became a more viable strategy to ensure confirmation. On May 24, 2005, seven moderate senators of each party, called the Gang of 14, in a deal to avoid the use of the \\"nuclear option\\", agreed to drop the filibuster against three of the seven remaining affected court of appeals nominees (Owen, Brown, and Pryor) but not two others (Saad and Myers).Senators compromise on filibusters, CNN, May 24, 2005. In addition, the senators in the group agreed to block future judicial filibusters except in cases involving \\"extraordinary circumstances\\". As a direct result of the deal, the two filibustered nominees not mentioned in it (McKeague and Griffin) were confirmed. Despite these agreements, however, some observers noted that the chances were still high that the Democrats would filibuster any of the ten originally filibustered nominees if he or she were later nominated to the Supreme Court, especially Owen, Pryor or Brown. There was also speculation that the Democrats would filibuster any Supreme Court nominee who would change the ideological composition of the court. Historically, although there have been several unsuccessful Supreme Court nominations, only one has been defeated because its opponents were able to successfully maintain a filibuster. This occurred in 1968, when Senate supporters of incumbent Associate Justice Abe Fortas's nomination to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice lost a vote to invoke cloture by a 45-43 vote, prompting President Lyndon Johnson to withdraw the nomination. When conservative judge John Roberts was nominated to succeed conservative Chief Justice William Rehnquist in September 2005, the confirmation process went relatively smoothly with no threat of a filibuster. Four months later, the filibuster conjecture was disproved. When Bush chose another conservative judge, Samuel Alito, to replace moderate associate justice Sandra Day O'Connor, opponents of Alito could not generate enough votes to prevent cloture from being invoked (72-25) on his nomination. The next day, January 31, 2006, the Senate confirmed the Alito nomination 58-42. =Consultations with the U.S. Senate= As the 2004–2005 term of the Supreme Court ended, there was a flurry of rumors that Rehnquist, who was undergoing treatment for thyroid cancer, would soon retire. On June 27, 2005, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid suggested that the next appointment to the Court should come from outside the judiciary. Reid suggested the appointment of one of four Republican Senators, none of whom possessed previous judicial experience: Mel Martinez, Mike DeWine, Mike Crapo and Lindsey Graham.Supreme Court Justice O'Connor retiring, NBC News, 2005. The list did not include the name of Republican Senator John Cornyn of Texas, a former justice on the Texas Supreme Court. Reid declined to address the omission.Lopez, Kathryn Jean. Kiss of Death , National Review, June 28, 2005. Unexpectedly, on July 1, 2005, it was not Rehnquist who announced his retirement, but O'Connor. On July 12, Bush met at the White House with the party leaders and ranking Judiciary Committee members from the two major parties — Republicans Bill Frist and Arlen Specter, and Democrats Reid and Patrick Leahy — to discuss the nomination process. During the meeting, the Democrats offered the President the names of three \\"moderate\\" Hispanic federal judges that they could accept: Sonia Sotomayor of the Second Circuit, Edward Prado of the Fifth Circuit, and Ricardo Hinojosa, a district court judge from Texas. Reid later told the press he was disappointed that the President had not chosen to discuss his own choice of possible candidates with the Democrats. In the conservative magazine National Review, the three candidates suggested by the Democrats were quickly dismissed as being offered in bad faith because they were too liberal for a conservative president to seriously consider.Lott, John R. Jr, and Jones, Sonya D. Unserious Suggestions, National Review, July 19, 2005. Sotomayor was later nominated to the Supreme Court by President Barack Obama (a Democrat) and confirmed as an associate justice in 2009. On the same day as the president's bi-partisan leadership meeting, First Lady Laura Bush stated in a Today show interview during an official visit to South Africa a preference for her husband to nominate a woman to O'Connor's seat. Bush was surprised at his wife's public comments about selecting a replacement for O'Connor, but said he would be open to hearing her advice when she returned from her trip. =John Roberts nomination= John Roberts, now Chief Justice, is pictured here with President Bush at the announcement of his first nomination on July 19, 2005. On the evening of July 19, 2005, Bush announced his first Supreme Court nominee, choosing John Roberts, a highly regarded former Supreme Court litigator and conservative judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to succeed retiring associate justice O'Connor. During the day leading up to the announcement, there had been much media speculation that one of either two female judges on the Fifth Circuit would be selected: moderate Edith Brown Clement or conservative Edith Jones.Riechmann, Deb. Bush to announce Supreme Court nominee in prime-time TV appearance , The San Diego Union-Tribune, July 19, 2005.Source: Clement Not Bush's Choice for High Court, ABC News, July 19, 2009. Clement was considered the frontrunner. About an hour before the televised announcement, however, information was leaked to the press concerning the choice of Roberts.https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/SupremeCourt/wireStory?id=954437Bush Picks Roberts for Supreme Court , Fox News, July 20, 2005. On September 3, 2005, Chief Justice Rehnquist died. Three days later, on September 6, Bush officially nominated Roberts to be the next chief justice, and simultaneously withdrew Roberts's still-pending nomination to be an associate justice, once again leaving O'Connor's without a nominee to replace her. Hearings on the Roberts associate justice nomination, set to begin on September 6, were cancelled, and rescheduled hearings, on the chief justice nomination, began on September 12. =Possible O'Connor replacements= On September 6, Specter encouraged the President to fill O'Connor's position with a woman, saying that the Supreme Court should have a minimum of two female justices.Baker, Peter, and Becker, Jo. Bush Pledges Wide Search for Court Seat, The Washington Post, Sept 7, 2005. On September 9, Laura Bush reiterated her previous wish to also see a female nominee.http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/N09374711.htm On the Thursday before Roberts' confirmation hearing commenced, one of Reid's aides said that the nomination of several candidates said to be on the president's short list to replace O'Connor—conservative appellate Judges J. Michael Luttig, Emilio Garza and Edith Jones—would be unacceptable to the Democrats, implying that any of them would be filibustered. Several days later, Specter made it known that he felt that it was too early for Bush to elevate Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to the Supreme Court.Specter: Gonzales Not Ready for Supreme Court , Capitol Hill Blue, Sept 12, 2005. Roberts' confirmation hearing for chief justice was held from Monday, September 12, to Friday, September 16. During the week of the hearing, there was much talk that Priscilla Owen would be the next nominee, but columnist Robert Novak reported that by Friday, Reid had told Frist that Judge Owen would also be filibustered if chosen.http://www.suntimes.com/output/novak/cst- edt-novak18.htmlReid Warns of Filibuster Over Owen , politicalwire.com, Sept 17, 2005. On Wednesday, September 21, Bush had another meeting with Senators Frist, Specter, Reid and Leahy to discuss possible Supreme Court nominations. On the day before, Laura Bush mentioned publicly for the third time that she would like to see a female nominee. At the same time, Reid stated that the nomination of any of the previously filibustered appellate nominees would be viewed by the Democrats as \\"a poke in the eye with a sharp stick\\".https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp- dyn/content/article/2005/09/21/AR2005092100227.html He restated this position during the meeting with the President when he warned against nominating either Brown or Owen.Kiely, Kathy.

Again, Bush did not offer any names of his own to discuss. On Thursday, September 22, Roberts' nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee by a bipartisan vote of 13–5. During a press conference on Monday, September 26, Bush implied that his next nominee would be either a woman or a minority. In making his decision concerning O'Connor's replacement, he said he would keep in mind that, \\"diversity is one of the strengths of the country\\". John Roberts was confirmed by the United States Senate on Thursday, September 29, by a vote of 78–22 and was sworn in both privately and publicly later the same day. During the evening of Sunday, October 2, John Fund, a columnist for the Wall Street Journal, announced on the radio show of blogger Matt Drudge that his sources had told him that the nominee would be moderate Hispanic Judge Consuelo M. Callahan of the Ninth Circuit. The website ConfirmThem.com, however, reported on the same evening that the selection had been made in favor of conservative Fourth Circuit Judge Karen J. Williams. On Monday, October 3, President Bush unexpectedly chose little-known White House Counsel Harriet Miers to be O'Connor's replacement on the court.Bush picks White House counsel for Supreme Court, CNN, Oct 4, 2005. =Harriet Miers nomination= President Bush introducing withdrawn nominee Harriet Miers. There was immediate and intense opposition to Miers' nomination, primarily from conservative Republicans. Principal complaints included: * That her credentials under objective standards were not sufficient to qualify her for the position. * That her nomination was the result of political cronyism. Because her legal career did not compare to those of other possible conservative female candidates (like federal appellate judges Edith Jones, Karen J. Williams, Priscilla Owen, and Janice Rogers Brown), many thought that President Bush probably nominated Miers for her personal loyalty to him rather than for her qualifications. * That there was no written record to demonstrate that she was either a strict constructionist or originalist in her approach to constitutional interpretation. Some conservatives feared that she would support abortion rights, affirmative action and gay rights if ever confirmed to a seat on the Supreme Court. On the morning of Thursday, October 27, 2005, President Bush \\"reluctantly\\" accepted Miers's request to withdraw her nomination. =Samuel Alito nomination= Associate Justice Samuel Alito acknowledges his nomination on October 31, 2005, with President Bush looking on. Bush moved quickly to find an alternative nominee to Miers, a nominee who would have both the credentials that Miers lacked and a conservative judicial philosophy that could be well documented. On the morning of Monday, October 31, Bush announced the nomination of well-known conservative Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., a fifteen-year veteran of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. Alito's confirmation hearing was held from Monday, January 9, 2006, to Friday, January 13. On Tuesday, January 24, his nomination was voted out of the Senate Judiciary Committee on a 10–8 party line vote. Debate on the nomination began in the full Senate on Wednesday, January 25.

The next day, he was publicly sworn in. =Epilogue= At the end of the 109th Congress, the Gang of 14 deal expired. On November 7, 2006, the Democrats retook control in the 110th Congress. Starting in January 2007, they possessed a 51–49 majority in the Senate. As the new Senate majority, the Democrats easily blocked several conservative appellate judicial nominees without resorting to the filibuster. Conservative appellate nominees like Peter Keisler, Robert J. Conrad and Steve A. Matthews were blocked in committee and never given a hearing. If a Supreme Court justice had chosen to retire during the 110th Congress, it would have been easy for the Democrats to have blocked his proposed replacement in committee, or even by a party-line vote on the Senate floor, if it somehow came to that. As it developed, no Supreme Court justice retired or died during the 110th Congress.

They first appear in the fossil record in the Eocene in Australia, and survived until the arrival of humans: in the Pleistocene in Australia and within the Holocene in the Pacific islands of Fiji, New Caledonia and Vanuatu. There is however disagreement on whether or not Mekosuchinae is a true subfamily within Crocodylidae, or a distinct crocodilian family in its own right, Mekosuchidae, within the superfamily Crocodyloidea. Mekosuchine crocodiles are a diverse group. One of the last species, Mekosuchus inexpectatus from Holocene New Caledonia, may have been arboreal. The early Miocene species, Harpacochampsa camfieldensis, may have resembled a false gharial. Another mekosuchine fossil, currently undescribed, has been found in Miocene deposits from New Zealand. One genus, Mekosuchus, managed to spread to the islands of the Pacific; it is believed to have island-hopped across the Coral Sea, moving first to a now submerged island known as Greater Chesterfield Island, then New Caledonia and onwards. In the Pleistocene, Quinkana was one of the top terrestrial predators of the Australian continent. Mekosuchines underwent a drastic decline in post-Miocene Australia, with all genera, except for Quinkana and Pallimnarchus (both perishing during the Quaternary extinction event) becoming extinct in Australia by the end of the Pliocene. After the demise of Quinkana and Pallimnarchus, the group survived on Vanuatu and New Caledonia until the arrival of humans, who are presumed to have driven them to extinction.

He served as the departmental secretary of the Attorney-General's Department from 1901 to 1932, and after 1916 also held the position of Solicitor-General of Australia. Garran was born in Sydney, the son of the journalist and politician Andrew Garran. He studied arts and law at the University of Sydney and was called to the bar in 1891. Garran was a keen supporter of the federation movement, and became acquainted with leading federalists like George Reid and Edmund Barton. At the 1897–98 constitutional convention he served as secretary of the drafting committee. On 1 January 1901, Garran was chosen by Barton's caretaker government as its first employee; for a brief period, he was the only member of the Commonwealth Public Service. His first duty was to write the inaugural edition of the Commonwealth Gazette, which contained Queen Victoria's proclamation authorising the creation of a federal government. Over the following three decades, Garran provided legal advice to ten different prime ministers, from Barton to Joseph Lyons. He was considered an early expert in Australian constitutional law, and with John Quick published an annotated edition of the constitution that became a standard reference work. Garran developed a close relationship with Billy Hughes during World War I, and accompanied him to the Imperial War Cabinet and the Paris Peace Conference. Hughes, who was simultaneously prime minister and attorney- general, appointed him to the new position of solicitor-general and delegated numerous powers and responsibilities to him. He was knighted three times for his service to the Commonwealth, in 1917, in 1920 and in 1937. In addition to his professional work, Garran was also an important figure in the development of the city of Canberra during its early years. He was one of the first public servants to relocate there after it replaced Melbourne as the capital in 1927. He founded several important cultural associations, organised the creation of the Canberra University College, and later contributed to the establishment of the Australian National University. Garran published at least eight books and many journal articles throughout his lifetime, covering such topics as constitutional law, the history of federalism in Australia, and German- language poetry. He was granted a state funeral upon his death in 1957, the first federal public servant to receive one. Early life Garran was born in Sydney, New South Wales, the only son (among seven children) of journalist and politician Andrew Garran and his wife Mary Isham. His parents were committed to social justice, Mary campaigning for issues such as the promotion of education for women, and Andrew advocating Federation and covering reformist movements as editor of The Sydney Morning Herald and later promoting them as a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council. The family lived in Phillip Street in central Sydney. Garran's mother \\"had a deep distrust, well justified in those days, of milkman's milk\\" and so she kept a cow in the backyard, which would walk on its own to The Domain each day to graze and return twice a day to be milked. The Garrans later lived in the suburb of Darlinghurst, just to the east of the centre of the city. Garran attended Sydney Grammar School from the age of ten, starting in 1877. He was a successful student, and became School Captain in 1884. He then studied arts and law at the University of Sydney, where he was awarded scholarships for classics, mathematics and general academic ability. Garran graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1888 and subsequently won the University's Medal in Philosophy when he was conferred with a Master of Arts with first-class honours in 1899. After graduating, Garran began to study for the Bar examination. He was employed for a year with a firm of Sydney solicitors, and in 1890 served as associate to Justice William Charles Windeyer of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Windeyer had a reputation for being a harsh and inflexible judge, particularly in criminal cases, where he was said to have \\"a rigorous and unrelenting sense of the retribution that he believed criminal justice demanded, [and] a sympathy verging on the emotional for the victims of crime.\\" Garran however offered a different view, saying that \\"those who knew him well knew that under a brusque exterior he was the kindest of men\\", and his reputation had to some degree been created by misrepresentation. In 1891, Garran was admitted to the New South Wales Bar, where he commenced practice as a barrister, primarily working in equity. Federation movement Portrait of Andrew Garran, Robert's father, in 1896 Garran, like his father, was strongly involved in the Australian Federation movement, the movement which sought to unite the British colonies in Australia (and, in early proposals, New Zealand) into one federated country. The first Constitutional Convention was held in 1891 in the chamber of the Legislative Council of New South Wales in Macquarie Street, Sydney, around the corner from Garran's chambers in Phillip Street; Garran regularly attended and sat in the public gallery to see \\"history... in the making under my very eyes.\\" Garran would later recall with approval that the 1891 convention was the first with the courage to face the \\"lion in the path\\", the issue of customs duties and tariffs, which had previously divided states such as Victoria, who were in favour of protectionism, and states such as New South Wales, who were in favour of free trade. In Garran's view a clause proposed at the convention, which allowed for tariffs against international trade while ensuring free trade domestically (the predecessor to the final section 92 of the Constitution of Australia), \\"expressed the terms on which New South Wales was prepared to face the lion.\\" Garran became involved with the work of Edmund Barton, who would later be the first Prime Minister of Australia but at the time was the de facto leader of the federation movement in New South Wales as Sir Henry Parkes declined into poor health. Garran, along with others such as Atlee Hunt, worked essentially as secretaries to Barton's federation campaign, drafting correspondence and planning meetings. At one late night meeting, planning a speech Barton was to give in the Sydney suburb of Ashfield, Barton coined the phrase \\"For the first time, we have a nation for a continent, and a continent for a nation\\"; Garran recalled that the now famous phrase \\"would have been unrecorded if I had not happened to jot it down.\\" In June 1893, when the Australasian Federal League was formed at a meeting in the Sydney Town Hall, Garran joined immediately and was made a member of the executive committee. He was one of the League's four delegates to the 1893 Corowa Conference and a League delegate to the 1896 Bathurst Conference, informal conferences held between members of the League (primarily based in Sydney), the Australian Natives' Association (mainly Victorian) and other pro-federation groups. At Corowa he was part of an impromptu group organised by John Quick which drafted a resolution, passed at the Conference, calling on the colonial parliaments to hold a directly elected Constitutional Convention to be charged with drafting the Bill for the Constitution of Australia. The proposal, which came to be known as the Corowa Plan, was later accepted at the 1895 Premiers' Conference and formed the basis for the federation process over the following five years. In 1897, Garran published The Coming Commonwealth, an influential book on the history of the Federation movement and the debate over the 1891 draft of the Constitution of Australia. The book was based on material he prepared for a course on federalism and federal systems of government, which he had planned to give at the University of Sydney, but which failed to attract a sufficient number of students. Nevertheless, the book was both unique and popular, as one of the few books on the topic at the time, with the first edition quickly selling out. Soon after its publication the Premier of New South Wales George Reid, who had been elected as a New South Wales delegate to the 1897–1898 Constitutional Convention, invited Garran to be his secretary. At the Convention, Reid appointed him secretary of the Drafting Committee, at Barton's request; he was also a member of the Press Committee. Garran recorded in a letter to his family during the convention's Melbourne sitting that: > The committee professes to find me very useful in unravelling the conundrums > sent down by the finance committee... The last two nights I have found the > drafting committee fagged [tired] and despairing, and now they have pitched > the conundrums at me and gone out for a smoke; and then I worked out > algebraic formulas to clear the thing up, drafted clauses accordingly, and > when the committee returned we had plain sailing. Garran joked that the long work of the drafting committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working late into the night preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had gone to bed exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia. Throughout 1898, following the completion of the proposed Constitution, Garran participated in the campaign promoting Federation leading up to the referendums at which the people of the colonies voted whether or not to approve the Constitution. He contributed a daily column to the Evening News, and had humorous poems critiquing opponents of federation published in The Bulletin. The following year, he began working with Quick on the Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, a reference work on the Constitution including a history, and detailed discussion of each section analysing its meaning and its development at the Conventions. Published in 1901, the Annotated Constitution, commonly referred to simply as \\"Quick & Garran\\", soon became the standard work on the Constitution and is still regarded as one of the most important works on the subject. Public service Garran and his wife Hilda (second and first from left respectively), and their friends Sir Littleton Groom and his wife Jessie (first and second from right respectively), photographed at Telopea Park in 1926 On the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, Garran was appointed secretary and Permanent Head of the Attorney- General's Department by the first Attorney-General of Australia, Alfred Deakin. Garran was the first, and for a time the only, public servant employed by the Government of Australia. Garran later said of this time that: > I was not only the head [of the department], but the tail. I was my own > clerk and messenger. My first duty was to write out with my own hand > Commonwealth Gazette No. 1 proclaiming the establishment of the Commonwealth > and the appointment of ministers of state, and to send myself down with it > to the government printer. In this role, Garran was responsible for organising the first federal election in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from the states to the federal government, including the Department of Defence, the postal and telegraphic services (now part of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). As parliamentary drafter, Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation. Garran and his fellow staff aimed for a simple style of legislative drafting, a goal enabled by the fact that there was no pre-existing federal legislation on which their work would have to be based. In Garran's opinion the approach, which was put into practice many years before the similarly principled plain English movement became popular in government in the 1970s, was intended \\"to set an example of clear, straightforward language, free from technical jargon.\\" Subsequent parliamentary drafters have noted that Garran was unusual in this respect for deliberately setting out to achieve and improve a particular drafting style, and that it was not until the early 1980s that such discipline among drafters re-emerged. However, Garran himself admitted that his drafting could be overly simplistic, citing the first customs and excise legislation, developed with the Minister for Trade and Customs Charles Kingston and Assistant Parliamentary Draftsman Gordon Castle, as an example of the style taken to excess. The style was also once parodied by foundation High Court Justice Richard O'Connor as follows: > Every man shall wear – > (a) Coat > (b) Vest > (c) Trousers > Penalty: £100. The Attorney-General's Department also managed litigation on behalf of the government. Initially the department contracted private law firms to actually conduct the litigation, but in 1903 the office of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor was established, with Charles Powers the first to hold the job. The other Crown Solicitors that Garran worked with were Gordon Castle (with whom he had also worked as a drafter) and William Sharwood. In 1912, Garran was considered as a possible appointee to the High Court, following the expansion of the bench from five seats to seven and the death of Richard O'Connor. Billy Hughes, Attorney-General in the Fisher government at the time, later said Garran would have been appointed \\"but for the fact that he is too valuable a man for us to lose. We cannot spare him.\\" Garran worked with eleven Attorneys- General as Permanent Head of the Department. Garran regarded the first Attorney-General, Alfred Deakin, as an excellent thinker and a natural lawyer, and on occasion \\"[spoke] of Deakin as the Balfour of Australian politics.\\" He was also very much impressed with the fifth Attorney-General, Isaac Isaacs, who was an extremely diligent worker, and two time Attorney-General Littleton Groom, who was \\"probably one of the most useful Ministers the Commonwealth has had.\\" =Solicitor-General= The Australian delegation to the Paris Peace Conference, 1919. Garran is in the front row, seated, second from left. Also pictured are Billy Hughes, front centre, and Sir Joseph Cook, seated, second from right. In 1916, Garran was made the first Solicitor-General of Australia by Billy Hughes, who had since become Prime Minister as well as Attorney- General. The creation of the office and Garran's appointment to it represented a formal delegation of many of the powers and functions formerly exercised by the Attorney-General. Garran developed a strong relationship with Hughes, giving him legal advice on the World War I conscription plebiscites and on the range of regulations which were made under the War Precautions Act 1914. The War Precautions Regulations had a broad scope, and were generally supported by the High Court, which adopted a much more flexible approach to the reach of the Commonwealth's defence power during wartime. A substantial amount of Garran's work during the war involved preparing and carrying out the regulations. Many of them were directed at maximising the economic aspect of the war effort and ensuring supplies of goods to Australian troops; others were directed at controlling citizens or former citizens of the enemy Central Powers living in Australia. On one occasion, when Hughes had been informed that at a party hosted by a German man, the band had played \\"Das Lied der Deutschen\\", Hughes asked Garran \\"By the way, what is this tune?\\" to which Garran replied that it was Haydn's melody to \\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\\", and as it was used as the tune to several hymns \\"it was probably sung in half a dozen churches in Sydney last Sunday.\\" Hughes then said \\"Good Heavens! I have played that thing with one finger hundreds of times.\\" The partnership between Garran and Hughes is regarded by some as unusual, given that Garran was \\"tall, gentlemanly, wise and scholarly\\", and patient with his staff, whereas Hughes was \\"short of stature [and] renowned for bursts of temper.\\" Nevertheless, the partnership was a successful one, with Hughes recognising the importance of Garran's constitutional expertise, remarking once about the World War I period that \\"the best way to govern Australia was to have Sir Robert Garran at [my] elbow, with a fountain pen and a blank sheet of paper, and the War Precautions Act.\\" Likewise, Garran respected Hughes' strong leadership style, which had been important in guiding the country through the war, although in describing the Nationalist Party's loss in the 1922 federal election, Garran later said that \\"Hughes also overestimated his own hold on Parliament [although] his hold on the people was probably undiminished.\\" Garran accompanied Hughes and Joseph Cook (then the Minister for the Navy) to the 1917 and 1918 meetings of the Imperial War Cabinet in London, United Kingdom, and was also part of the British Empire delegation to the 1919 Paris Peace Conference in Paris, France. There he was on several of the treaty drafting committees, and contributed to many provisions, notably the portions of the League of Nations Covenant relating to League of Nations mandates. Though focusing mainly on League of Nations matters, Garran and John Latham (the head of Australian Naval Intelligence) had the status of technical advisers to Hughes and Cook, and so could attend the main conference and any of the associated councils. Observing the proceedings, Garran admired the \\"moral and physical courage\\" of French premier Georges Clemenceau, whom he regarded as determined to protect France from Germany but in a measured and temperate way; in Garran's words, Clemenceau \\"always withstood the excessive demands of the French chauvinists, of the French army, and of Foch himself\\". Garran viewed some similarities between British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and United States President Woodrow Wilson where others saw only differences, since Lloyd George \\"also had a strong vein of idealism in his character\\", and Wilson could be pragmatic when the situation called for it, such as in discussions relating to American interests. Garran also met other political and military leaders at the conference, including T. E. Lawrence, \\"an Oxford youth of 29 – he looks 18\\", who was modest and \\"without any affectation... in a company of two or three [he] could talk very interestingly, but at a larger gathering he was apt to be dumb.\\" Red Hill Following the war, Garran worked with Professor Harrison Moore of the University of Melbourne and South Australian judge Professor Jethro Brown on a report about proposed constitutional amendments which ultimately became the referendum questions put forward in the 1919 referendum. Garran attended two Imperial Conferences, accompanying Prime Minister Stanley Bruce in 1923 and in 1930 joining Prime Minister James Scullin and Attorney-General Frank Brennan, chair of the Drafting Committee which prepared drafts of agreements on various topics, such as merchant shipping. He also attended the eleventh League of Nations conference that year with them in Geneva, Switzerland. At the Royal Commission on the Constitution in 1927, Garran gave evidence over five days, where he discussed the history and origins of the Constitution and the evolution of the institutions established under it. Through the 1920s and early 1930s, Garran prepared annual summaries of legislative developments in Australia, highlighting important individual pieces of legislation for the Journal of Comparative Legislation and International Law.For example, and Towards the end of his time as Solicitor-General, Garran's work included the preparation of the Debt Conversion Agreement between the Government of Australia and the governments of the states, which involved the federal government taking over and managing the debts of the individual states, following the 1928 referendum. In 1930, he was asked by the Scullin Government to provide an opinion on whether Norman Lindsay's novel Redheap was indecent and obscene within the terms of section 52(c) of the Customs Act 1901. He concluded that it was, and the Department of Trade and Customs subsequently banned the book from being imported into Australia, the first book by an Australian author to suffer such a ban. It has been suggested that Frank Forde, the Acting Minister for Trade and Customs, had already decided to ban the book, and sought Garran's advice primarily as a buffer against political criticism. Personal life and retirement In 1902, Garran married Hilda Robson. Together they would have four sons, Richard (born 1903), John (1905), Andrew (1906) and Isham Peter (1910). At this time the family lived in Melbourne, and the boys all attended Melbourne Grammar School and later studied at the University of Melbourne, attending Trinity College there. The presentation of the Charter of the Canberra Rotary Club, 1928, at the Hotel Canberra. Garran is seated, front centre. In 1927, Garran had moved from his home in Melbourne to the newly established capital Canberra, one of the first public officials to do so (many government departments and their public servants did not move to Canberra until after World War II). He also worked within the Government to facilitate housing in Canberra for officials who needed to move there from other cities, and was involved in establishing cultural organisations in the city. In 1928 he was the inaugural President of the Canberra Rotary Club. In 1929, he formed the Canberra University Association in order to promote the formation of a university in Canberra, and in 1930 organised the establishment of Canberra University College (essentially a campus of the University of Melbourne) which taught undergraduate courses, chairing its council for its first twenty-three years. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Garran \\"consistently advocated the establishment of what he prophetically called 'a National University at Canberra' \\", which would be primarily for specialist research and postgraduate study, in areas particularly relating to Australia, such as foreign relations with Asia and the Pacific region. This vision was evidently influential on the establishment of the Australian National University (ANU) in 1946, the only research-only university in the country (although in 1960 it amalgamated with Canberra University College to offer undergraduate courses). Garran retired from his governmental positions on 9 February 1932, a fixed retirement date on the day before his sixty-fifth birthday. He soon returned to practise as a barrister, and within a month he was made a King's Counsel. However, he occasionally carried out more prominent work. In 1932, he was selected on the advice of the then Attorney-General John Latham to chair the Indian Defence Expenditure Tribunal, to advise on the dispute between India and the United Kingdom regarding the costs of the military defence of India. In 1934, along with John Keating, William Somerville and David John Gilbert, he formed a committee which prepared The Case for Union, the Government of Australia's official reply to the secessionist movement in the state of Western Australia. Garran served on ANU's council from 1946 until 1951. Garran was also involved with the arts; he was the vice-president of the Canberra Musical Society, where he sang and played the clarinet, and in 1946 won a national song competition run by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Garran also published translations of Heinrich Heine's 1827 work Buch der Lieder (\\"Book of Songs\\") in 1924, and of the works of Franz Schubert and Robert Schumann in 1946. Garran died in 1957 in Canberra. He was granted a state funeral, the first given to a public servant of the Government of Australia. He was survived by his four sons; his wife Hilda had died in 1936. His memoirs, Prosper the Commonwealth, were published posthumously in 1958, having been completed shortly before his death. Legacy Garran at ANZAC Day celebrations at the cenotaph in Martin Place, Sydney, 25 April 1944 Garran's \\"personality, like his prose, was devoid of pedantry and pomposity and, though dignified, was laced with a quizzical turn of humour.\\" His death \\"marked the end of a generation of public men for whom the cultural and the political were natural extensions of each other and who had the skills and talents to make such connections effortlessly.\\" At his death, Garran was one of the last remaining of the people involved with the creation of the Constitution of Australia. Former Prime Minister John Howard, in describing Garran, said: > \\"I wonder though if we sometimes underestimate the changes, excitements, > disruptions and adjustments previous generations have experienced. Sir > Robert Garran knew the promise and reality of federation. He was part of the > establishment of a public service which, in many ways, is clearly > recognisable today.\\" Garran's friend Charles Daley, a long time civic administrator of the Australian Capital Territory, emphasised Garran's contribution to the early development of the city of Canberra, particularly its cultural life, remarking at a celebratory dinner for Garran in 1954 that: > \\"There has hardly been a cultural movement in this city with which Sir > Robert has not been identified in loyal and inspiring support, as his > constant aim has been that Canberra should be not only a great political > centre but also a shrine to foster those things that stimulate and enrich > our national life... his name will ever be inscribed in the annals, not only > of Canberra, but of the Commonwealth as clarum et venerabile nomen > gentibus.Daley quotes Lucan's epic poem Pharsalia; the phrase may be > translated as \\"Among the people his name is honoured and distinguished.\\" However Garran is perhaps best remembered as an expert on constitutional law, more so than for his other contributions to public service. On his experience of Federation and the Constitution, Garran was always enthusiastic: > \\"I'm often asked 'has federation turned out as you expected?' Well yes and > no. By and large the sort of thing we expected has happened but with > differences. We knew the constitution was not perfect; it had to be a > compromise with all the faults of a compromise... But, in spite of the > unforeseen [sic] strains and stresses, the constitution has worked, on the > whole, much as we thought it would. I think it now needs revision, to meet > the needs of a changed world. But no-one could wish the work undone, who > tries to imagine, what, in these stormy days, would have been the plight of > six disunited Australian colonies.\\" Honours Garran was made a Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) on the day that Federation was completed and Australia created, 1 January 1901, \\"in recognition of services in connection with the Federation of Australian Colonies and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia\\", Garran was first knighted in 1917, and was appointed as a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in 1920. He was knighted a third time in 1937 when he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG). Shortly after the establishment of the ANU in 1946, Garran became its first graduate when he was awarded an honorary doctorate of laws. He had already been awarded such an honorary doctorate from the University of Melbourne in 1937 and later receiving one from his alma mater, the University of Sydney in 1952. = Memorials = Garran's influence on Canberra is remembered by the naming of the suburb of Garran, Australian Capital Territory, established in 1966, after him. Garran's link with ANU is remembered by the naming of a chair in the university's School of Law, by the naming of the hall of residence Burton & Garran Hall, and by the naming of Garran house at Canberra Grammar School for his work with that school. The Garran oration, established to honour his memory, has been given yearly since 1959. In 1983, the former Patent Office building – then occupied by the Federal Attorney General's Department – was renamed Robert Garran Offices. It was renamed the Robert Marsden Hope Building in 2011.

Garfield recorded a population of 1,786 at the 2016 Census. History The area was originally called Cannibal Creek, but was renamed to Garfield in memory of the U.S. President James A. Garfield. The Post Office opened as Cannibal Creek on 1 May 1886 and was renamed Garfield in 1887. =Garfield filmed= In the late 1980s the appearance of the town was transformed for the cameras to look like the 1960s in a television miniseries on aboriginal boxer, Lionel Rose, who was raised in the region in Jacksons Track, near Drouin. Some shop fronts were restored and the main street of the town was filled with old cars to recreate the era. Garfield today Since the beginnings as a railway and timber town, and later a dairy and potato farming and orchard area, Garfield has always been a close community, with almost everybody knowing everyone else, and in some cases four generations of family staying in the (mainly), farming area. Recent growth has seen a doubling of residential building and the (2006), upgrading of the railway line from Melbourne to Traralgon with increases in frequency of services by upgraded modern trains, is an attraction to new residents. A housing development, nearing completion in 2007, is for over-55s in a secure environment. Previously derelict shops on the main street are now reoccupied. Garfield has a small primary school with approximately 190 students. There is a church at the top end of the schoolgrounds. Local businesses include a milk bar, a newsagency, ANZ bank, pub, gift shops, and a bed and breakfast. The town has an Australian Rules football team playing in the Ellinbank and District Football League. Garfield has an undulating golf course on Thirteen Mile Road run by the Garfield Golf Club. A community swimming pool operates in the summer months within the recreation precinct where there is also the lawn bowling club, netball and tennis courts, skateboarding site, along with the newly regenerated football oval beside which is the community hall and children's playground which local groups use for a variety of functions. Garfield's picture theatre, although long closed, is being restored for future multi-entertainment uses, and stands as a landmark in the town. A newsagency and a post office operating six days a week, a bakery outlet, a milkbar and take-away shop, a combined-churches charity shop, an Equestrian outfitters, a pet shop, a gift shop, a chemist, butcher, and a full-time ANZ Bank branch operating out of the newsagency, a unisex hairdresser, plus the \\"Iona Hotel\\" (now known as the \\"Garfield Hotel\\") make up the occupants on the main street which runs parallel with the railway that dissects the town with the station at its centre. A local architectural engineering firm has been operational since the 1950s. The farming land nearby has an influx of horse owners in recent years and the Pakenham Racecourse will soon begin construction on a $35 million racing complex in the area.

History Wood introduced the term in an essay on Zadie Smith's White Teeth, which appeared in the July 24, 2000 issue of The New Republic. Wood uses the term pejoratively to denote the contemporary conception of the \\"big, ambitious novel\\" that pursues \\"vitality at all costs\\" and consequently \\"knows a thousand things but does not know a single human being.\\" He decried the genre as an attempt to \\"turn fiction into social theory,\\" and an attempt to tell readers \\"how the world works rather than how somebody felt about something.\\" Wood points to Don DeLillo and Thomas Pynchon as the forefathers of the genre, which continues, Wood says, in writers like David Foster Wallace. In response, Zadie Smith described hysterical realism as a \\"painfully accurate term for the sort of overblown, manic prose to be found in novels like my own White Teeth and a few others [Wood] was sweet enough to mention\\". and archived. Smith qualified the term, though, explaining that \\"any collective term for a supposed literary movement is always too large a net, catching significant dolphins among so much cannable tuna.\\" She also noted \\"David Foster Wallace's mammoth beast Infinite Jest was heaved in as an exemplum, but it is five years old, and is a world away from his delicate, entirely 'human' short stories and essays of the past two years, which shy away from the kind of totalizing theoretical and thematic arcs that Wood was gunning for. If anyone has recently learned a lesson about the particularities of human existence and their separation from social systems, it is Wallace.\\" Wood's line of argument echoes many common criticisms of postmodernist art generally. In particular, Wood's attacks on DeLillo and Pynchon clearly echo similar criticisms other critics had already lodged against them a generation earlier. The \\"hysterical\\" prose style is often paired with \\"realistic\\"—almost journalistic—effects, such as Pynchon's depiction of 18th century land surveys in Mason & Dixon, and Don DeLillo's treatment of Lee Harvey Oswald in Libra. Yet as Zadie Smith notes, \\"People continue to manage this awesome trick of wrestling sentiment away from TV's colonization of all things soulful and human, and I would applaud all the youngish Americans—Franzen, Moody, Foster Wallace, Eggers, Moore for their (supposedly) small but, to me, significant triumphs. They work to keep both sides of the equation—brain and heart—present in their fiction. Even if you find them obtuse, they can rarely be accused of cliché...\\" (op. cit.). The hysterical realist fiction of Roberto Bolaño, Giannina Braschi, Alberto Fuguet, and Edmundo Paz Soldán deals with mass culture, global riffs between labor and capital, and extreme violence in modern major cities and in border towns. Cultural theorists such as Ilan Stavans and Debra A.Castillo view the edgy fiction of these urban authors as signaling the end of Magic Realism and the Latin American Boom. Their elaborately dense sentences, manic energy, and visceral prose intertwines real world events with complex plots and an unlikely cast of far flung characters. In the case of Giannina Braschi's United State of Banana, this sprawling work of manic prose opens with the collapse of the World Trade Center on 9/11 and spins into a myriad of sardonic observations and ironic metaphors about financial terrorism, mass immigration, mass incarceration, and the meaning of freedom in a post-911 era. Braschi's hyperactive, elaborate narratives conjure disparate voices and perspectives of political figures (Barack Obama, Fidel Castro, and Hu Jintao), poets and philosophers (Pablo Neruda, Ruben Dario, Antonin Artaud and Neitszche), and even barnyard animals. In the case of Roberto Bolaño's novel 2666, a 900 page detective fiction about an epidemic of femicide, there are hyper-realistic descriptives, countless mysteries, high flying passions, and a convoluted plot that points to the economic pressures underlying systemic violence.  Works  Some books described as examples of hysterical realism are:   * Eggers, Dave (2000). A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius. * Fuguet, Alberto (2000). The Movies of My Life.

An initial organizational meeting was held in December 1961, attended by 12 of the approximately 50 current and former CPUSA members identifying themselves as the \\"Call group\\". Rosen delivered a political report to the Cuban Revolution-inspired group urging the establishment of a new communist party in the United States to replace the CPUSA, which was characterized as irredeemably \\"revisionist\\". The organization remained amorphous in its first months, publishing Progressive Labor—initially a monthly newsletter—and engaging in small-scale discussions. An organizational conference was called by the editors of Progressive Labor to be held in New York City in July 1962. This gathering, held at the Hotel Diplomat, was attended by 50 people from 11 different cities and served to launch a formal organization, the Progressive Labor Movement. Rosen again delivered the main political report to the gathering, calling for the writing of a program and development of a network of clubs and affiliated mass organizations in order to win supporters for a new revolutionary socialist movement. Given the small size of the fledgling organization, formation of a political party was deemed unpropitious. The name \\"Progressive Labor Movement\\" was selected to emphasize the organization's early and transitional nature. The Progressive Labor Movement was finally reconstituted as the Progressive Labor Party at a founding convention held in New York City on April 15–18, 1965.

During the 1960s, the PLP followed the international political line of the Communist Party of China and was described by commentators as \\"Maoist\\". The organization carved out a niche in the anti-Vietnam War movement, with its Worker Student Alliance faction acting as rivals to the Revolutionary Youth Movement faction within Students for a Democratic Society—the latter a self-described Maoist organization that had a minority faction that later evolved into the Weather Underground.Dylan Matthews, \\"The Washington Post picked its top American Communists. Wonkblog begs to differ,\\" Washington Post, Sept. 26, 2013. The PLP made extensive use of mass organizations (front groups) from its earliest years, through which it spread its ideas, raised funds and recruited new members.\\"Staff Report\\" in Progressive Labor Party: Hearings... pg. 4135. Among these were the Student Committee for Travel to Cuba (1963–64), which organized travel to post- revolutionary Cuba; the Harlem Defense Council (1964), organized in response to racially oriented rioting in Harlem; the May 2nd Movement (M2M, established 1964), organized in opposition to the Vietnam War; and other short-lived, issue-driven front groups. = 1970s = The PLP ended its previous political line supporting the Cultural Revolution and broke with the People's Republic of China in the spring of 1971 with the publication of an internal discussion bulletin for party members detailing eight points of disagreement with the Chinese regime.\\"Progressive Labor Party Line on Communist China,\\" in House Internal Security Committee, Progressive Labor Party: Hearings...\\" pg. 4431. These related to the softening of China's foreign relations towards Cambodia, North Korea, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the United States, its \\"complete elevation of the Black Panther Party as the revolutionary group in the United States\\" and its \\"total collusion with every nationalist fake the world over, from Nasser to Nkrumah\\". During the 1970s, the PLP began to shape its activity around racism in the United States, forming a mass organization called the Committee Against Racism (CAR).Harvey Klehr, \\"United States of America,\\" in Richard F. Staar (ed.). Yearbook on International Communist Affairs, 1977. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1977; pp. 500-501. A CAR convention held in New York City in July 1976 drew 500 participants. The organization made use of aggressive direct action tactics against its perceived opponents, disrupting presentations by the controversial psychologist Arthur Jensen and the physicist William Shockley in the spring of 1976. The CAR were the most vocal of the hostile critics of the sociobiologist E. O. Wilson. The organization picketed in Harvard Square and handed out flyers calling for demonstrations against sociobiology, which in their view was being used to defend individuals and groups responsible for racism, war, and genocide.Ullica Segerstråle. Defenders of the Truth: The Battle for Science in the Sociology Debate and Beyond. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press, 2000; pp. 21-22. In 1977, the organization, now renamed the International Committee Against Racism (InCAR), made headlines by disrupting an academic conference by pouring a pitcher of water on Wilson's head while chanting \\"Wilson, you're all wet\\".Wilson, Edward O. 1995. Naturalist. = Structure = According to the constitution adopted at the time of the PLP's formation in 1965, membership was open to anyone at least 17 years old who accepted the program and policies of the party, paid dues and required assessments and subscribed to party publications.\\"Staff Report\\" in Progressive Labor Party: Hearings... pg. 4131. Supreme authority within the organization was to be exerted by national conventions, held every two years. The convention was to elect a National Committee to handle matters of governance between conventions. The PLP's primary party unit was the \\"club\\", organized either on a shop, territorial, or functional basis. All party members were required to be active members of a club and bound by the principles of democratic centralism, in which decisions of higher bodies were considered binding on participants in lower bodies. During the 1960s, new members were additionally required to undergo three months of ideological training, usually in small group settings in individual houses. Owing in part to the significant economic and extensive time requirements expected of its members, the PLP has since its inception been a small cadre organization, with an \\"estimated hard-core membership\\" of about 350 in 1970, supplemented by numerous sympathizers. Members during the 1960s were predominantly from white, middle-class backgrounds, shunned drug use, and tended \\"to dress neatly and wear short hair\\", according to a 1971 House Internal Security Committee staff report. = Publications = During the 1960s and 1970s, the PLP published a magazine called Progressive Labor, which first appeared as a monthly before shifting to quarterly and later bimonthly publication.Testimony of Alma Pfaff, in House Committee on Internal Security, Progressive Labor Party: Hearings Before the Committee on Internal Security, House of Representatives, Ninety-Second Congress, First Session: April 13, 14, and November 18, 1971 (Including Index). Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972; pg. 4047. The press run of Progressive Labor circa 1970 was approximately 10,000.Romerstein in Progressive Labor Party: Hearings... pg. 4055. The party also published Challenge, a publication likewise issued at changing intervals over the years.Pfaff in Progressive Labor Party: Hearings... pg. 4048. In 1970, the press run of this publication was approximately 75,000, according to the estimates of government investigators, with many of these copies unsold. Challenge remains in production today as a biweekly, issued under the same covers with its parallel Spanish language counterpart Desafío. The PLP also produces a semiannual theoretical magazine, The Communist. During 1963 and 1964, the PLP also produced a theoretical magazine called Marxist-Leninist Quarterly.\\"Staff Report\\" in Progressive Labor Party: Hearings... pg. 4133. This publication was terminated and merged with Progressive Labor magazine in 1965. A West Coast publication called Spark was also produced from 1965 until early 1968.

As one of the most important charities in Hong Kong, The Community Chest serves as an umbrella organization to provide grants to a wide range of community projects. 100% of funds raised are used to enhance local social welfare services without any deductions for administrative costs. Vision The goal of The Community Chest is to work for the betterment of Hong Kong through the support by millions and to build a caring society through greater participation and giving by the Hong Kong community. Mission The mission statements of the Community Chest are: *to obtain donations through community wide appeals on behalf of member social welfare agencies; *to act as trustee of the donors and allocate funds raised prudently to member agencies to strengthen and maximize their services to the needy; *to provide an integrated service for donors wishing to support a wide range of welfare services in Hong Kong. Administration The Community Chest is governed by a Board. Under the Board, there are four main committees: the Executive Committee, the Campaign Committee, the Public Relations Committee and the Admissions, Budgets and Allocations Committee. Over 300 volunteers serving on various sub-committees contribute to support the work of these committees. They also work with the 40 staff at the Chest office to accomplish their fundraising target each year and allocate these funds to over 140 social welfare agencies. Each year, more than 1.7 million needy people benefit from the fundraising programs organized by the Chest. The Chest's administrative costs are subsidized by an annual grant from The Hong Kong Jockey Club, and by returns on investments. Therefore, the Chest is able to allocate 100% of the donations it receives to the beneficiaries without any deduction for administrative expenses.

names are listed in alphabetical order) Services Supported (Baseline Allocations) =Elderly Services= There are residential services, community support services, carer support services, and empowerment and health services. The Community Chest of Hong Kong collaborates with its member agencies such as Helping Hand and Caritas Hong Kong, to provide services for the elderly in Hong Kong. =Family and Child Welfare Services= For child welfare services, there are day care services, developmental and supportive services, residential child care services and child protection services. For family welfare services, there are 5 components: family support services, services for families with special needs, services for family reunion and new arrivals, services for women/men as well as parent education. =Rehabilitation and Aftercare Services= Eight groups of people are provided with aftercare and rehabilitation services from the Community Chest of Hong Kong. They are the visually impaired, the hearing impaired, the mentally handicapped, the physically handicapped, people who are chronically ill, drug-abusers, ex-offenders and people with other disabilities. =Children and Youth Services= In services provided to children and youth, provision of after school care services is one of the major parts. Also, youth counselling and recreational services are provided in youth centres. While collaborating with organisations like The Hong Kong Award for Young People and The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups, developmental and supportive services are provided. Furthermore, training is provided for the youth with collaborations of Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps and Boys' Brigade, Hong Kong, etc. Play-related services are also provided. =Medical and Health Services= Medical treatment is provided and community health care is also given out in the form of programmes such as health maintenance program and cancer education.

Major Events =Dress Special Day= \\"Dress Special Day\\" (公益服飾日, formerly named \\"Dress Casual Day\\" 公益金便服日), first launched in 1993, is a day when participants can dress in their favourite wear to work or to school and at the same time to raise funds for charity. It has run become a popular fund-raising event with an increasing number of participants every year. Each participant who raises/donates HK$60 can join the event while no minimum is set for student participants. As more and more employers began to encourage their employees to go to work in their casual wear, \\"Dress Casual Day\\" was renamed \\"Dress Special Day\\" in 2006. In doing so, the theme of this activity can be more flexible and vivid. It is hoped that donation can reach a higher peak by drawing strength from more participants. Website for the year 2009 =Walks for Millions= \\"Walks for Millions\\" () is a flagship fund- raising event of the Community Chest. It was first launched in 1971. People can participate in the walk by soliciting donation from friends and relatives. A number of walks were organised at major infrastructures before their official opening to public use. Until campaign year 2009/2010, over 3 million participants have joined this meaningful event and 160 walks have been organised by The Community Chest. =\\"Community for the Chest\\" Television Show= \\"Community for the Chest\\" Television Show () is another major initiative. It is jointly produced by The Community Chest and Television Broadcast Limited. Local celebrities, prominent social elites and famous stars pitch in their efforts to rally support from the general public. There are many innovative and entertaining programmes rolled out to raise funds for the Chest's member social welfare agencies. =The Community Chest Corporate Challenge Half Marathon= Runners from Corporations and organisations pitched in their support by joining the 10 km Run and 21 km Half Marathon to raise funds to designated services supported by The Community Chest. =Corporate and Employee Contribution Programme= A major fund-raising programme providing a direct channel for corporations and employees to make donations. Total contribution from corporations and employees, raised through direct donations, self-organised fundraising events or CARE Scheme – monthly payroll deduction, are recognised through a joint award scheme. Under this programme, special events are organised to seek both corporate and public support. Love Teeth Day Love Teeth Day aims to arouse public awareness on oral health whilst raising funds for the needy. In return, a \\"Love Teeth Day Pack\\" with various oral care products will be presented to participants as gesture of appreciation.

Participants are encouraged to solicit sponsorship to perform their own \\"GREEN\\" acts to support the event. Skip Lunch Day This event is held to encourage people to donate their lunch fees to support the needy. Each donor will be given a Skip Lunch Day Coupon by making a donation of HK$30 or more. In 2010, this event was supported by nearly 300 organisations and government departments. Over HK$1.6 million was raised. Stock Code Balloting Scheme for Charity Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited (HKEx) has always been a staunch partner of The Community Chest of Hong Kong. To encourage listed companies to re-invest into the local community, HKEx has initiated \\"Stock Code Balloting for Charity Scheme\\" in 1999 to give each company listing on Stock Exchange of Hong Kong the option to choose its stock code by making a donation to The Community Chest and help channel invaluable resources to the local social welfare services. =Celebrations for the Chest= In lieu of gifts to celebrate birthdays, weddings, anniversaries, opening for new businesses and other special occasions, donors can share their happiness with the needy by donating to the Chest through this year-round programme. =Greening for the Chest= \\"Greening for the Chest\\", jointly organised by The Community Chest and Education Bureau, aims to convey the message of environmental protection among the youth. Over the years, students from the 18 Districts Community Youth Clubs have been encouraged to take part in cleaning, planting and tree tendering in country parks, and at the same time, raise funds for the needy in Hong Kong. With the assistance from Leisure and Cultural Services Department and Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department, organisations could also clean or plant at designated locations for a better cause. =Flag Day= The Chest always encourages the younger generation to take an active role in serving the community and the annual \\"Flag Day\\" provides an ideal channel for the youth to realise their benevolent initiatives. Each year, more than 12,000 students and volunteers from primary and secondary schools, kindergartens, the Chest's member agencies, as well as other voluntary organisations participate in \\"Street Flag Sale\\". Together with the significant contributions from schools participating in \\"Gold Flag Sale\\", the event has helped raise a generous amount of resources. Donation There are two types of general donation, namely monthly donation and one-off donation. Monthly donation can be made through autopay or credit cards. One- off donation can be made on-line by internet donation, by credit card, by cheque, by phone, via 7-Eleven outlets or electronic teller machines.

It serves the town of Warragul, and opened on 1 March 1878. It was the junction station for the branch line to Neerim South and Noojee, which closed in 1958. The line between Pakenham to Warragul was duplicated in various stages between 1952 and 1956, and was electrified in 1954. Starting from 15 February 1987, and lasting until December 1998, the station was the terminus of a number of The Met/PTC electric passenger services from Flinders Street. The line was de-electrified beyond Warragul on 28 June 1987, and the overhead support structures were removed in 2005/2006, as part of the Regional Fast Rail project. The former \\"A\\" siding was abolished in 1988, along with alterations to points, signals and levers. Also during 1988, the double line block system between Warragul and Yarragon was abolished, with automatic three position signalling introduced. This introduction also resulted in the abolition of signal boxes \\"A\\" and \\"B\\". The tracks in the former yard are now used as storage for concrete sleepers, old and new signals, and rail machines. Tracks on the northern side of the station were moved slightly, to reduce the radius of curves, and allow trains to travel at higher speed. The station itself was upgraded in 2015. It included a new car park and a bus interchange, a new footbridge next to the Alfred Street overpass and a new road underpass at Normanby Place, located at the eastern end of the station.

This procedure is used to treat a variety of seizure disorders where the source of the epilepsy is localized to a broad area of a single hemisphere of the brain, notably Rasmussen's encephalitis. About one in three patients with epilepsy will continue to have persistent seizures despite epileptic drug therapy.Kraemer, Diana L., MD, and David Vossler Gregg, MD. \\"Epilepsy Surgery.\\" emedicine.medscape.com/. Ed. Brian H. Kopell. Medscape, 11 Apr. 2014. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. Hemispherectomy is reserved for the most extreme cases of this one-third in which the individual’s seizures are irresponsive to medications or other less invasive surgeries and significantly impair functioning or put the patient at risk of further complications. The procedure successfully cures seizures in about 85–90% of patients. Additionally, it is also known to often markedly improve the cognitive functioning and development of the individual.Blume, H. \\"Hemispherectomy.\\" Epilepsy Foundation. N.p., Jan. 2004. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. Subtotal hemispherectomy sparing sensorimotor cortex can be performed with successful seizure control expected in 70–80% of patients. Even with the presence of widespread unilateral epileptogenicity or anatomic/functional imaging abnormalities, complete hemispherectomy can often be avoided, particularly when there is little hemiparesis.  History and development  Hemispherectomy was first performed on a dog in 1888 by Friedrich Goltz. The first such operation on humans was done by Walter Dandy in 1928 for glioblastoma multiforme. Hemispherectomy was revitalized in children in the 1980s by John M. Freeman and Ben Carson at Johns Hopkins Hospital. In the 1960s and early 1970s, hemispherectomy involved essentially removing an entire half of the brain. This procedure is known as anatomical hemispherectomy. Anatomical hemispherectomy decreases the likelihood that seizures will return, as there is no longer any part of the identified epileptic brain area left to cause seizures. A second type of hemispherectomy, known as functional hemispherectomy, has become more prevalent in recent years. In this procedure, only the epileptic portions of that side of the brain are removed, as opposed to the entire hemisphere. If a functional hemispherectomy is chosen over an anatomical hemispherectomy, it is likely because it allows for less blood loss and greater chance of resilience for the patient.Choi, Charles. \\"Strange but True: When Half a Brain Is Better than a Whole One.\\" Scientific American. N.p., 24 May 2007. Web. 21 Sept. 2016.Danielpour M, von Koch C, S, Ojemann S, G, Peacock W, J, Disconnective Hemispherectomy. Pediatr Neurosurg 2001;35:169–172 Additionally, functional hemispherectomy is less likely to cause hydrocephalus, the “excessive accumulation of [cerebrospinal fluid] in the brain,” which leads to complications from harmful pressure on brain tissues.National Institute of Health. \\"Hydrocephalus Fact Sheet.\\" National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. U.S. National Library of Medicine, May 2013. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. Within the last fifteen years, a few types of functional hemispherectomies have emerged typically involving removal of less brain tissue. One such procedure is known as peri-insular hemispherotomy. Peri- insular hemispherotomy has been developed to allow for seizure relief with minimal brain tissue removal. In this procedure, the surgeon aims to disconnect (rather than remove) the hemisphere, hence termed hemispherotomy, in order to minimize long term complications.Villemure, Jean-Guy, MD, and Christopher Mascott R., MD. \\"Peri‐insular Hemispherotomy: Surgical Principles and Anatomy.\\" Neurosurgery 37.5 (1995): 975–81. Neurosurgery: The Register of the Neurosurgical Meme. Congress of Neurological Surgeons. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. This procedure continues to be refined and is now performed more commonly than classical hemispherectomy. Another procedure relatively new to epilepsy surgery is endoscopic surgery (see endoscopy), surgery performed using small camera scopes and little incision sites. Its appeal lies in its minimally invasive nature, which generally decreases chance of infection and increases speed of physical recovery.Chandra SP, Tripathi M. Endoscopic epilepsy surgery: Emergence of a new procedure. Neurol India 2015;63:571‑82.  Patient criteria  Because of the dramatic alteration of brain composition and the inherent risk that hemispherectomies pose, there are criteria that must be met in order for a person to qualify for the procedure. Criteria include no successful control of seizures throughout a variety of drug trials, and a reasonable to high chance of procedural success.Kraemer, Diana L., MD, and David Vossler Gregg, MD. \\"Epilepsy Surgery.\\" emedicine.medscape.com/. Ed. Brian H. Kopell. Medscape, 11 Apr. 2014. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. One such predictor of success is often the age of the patient. This procedure is almost exclusively performed in children because their brains generally display more neuroplasticity, allowing neurons from the remaining hemisphere to take over the tasks from the lost hemisphere. This likely occurs by strengthening neural connections which already exist on the unaffected side but which would have otherwise remained small in a normally functioning, uninjured brain. In one study of children under 5 who had this surgery to treat catastrophic epilepsy, 73.7% were freed of all seizures. The success of the procedure is not, however, limited to children. A study in 2007 indicated the long-term efficacy of anatomic hemispherectomy in carefully selected adults, with seizure control sustainable over multiple decades. A case study published in 2015 of 2 adults aged 48 and 38 demonstrated the success of functional hemispherectomy in treating status epilepticus (SE), an epileptic condition in which seizures are prolonged or occur closely together.McGinity, Michael, Nicholas Andrade, Kameel Karkar, Jean-Louis Caron, and Charles Szabo. \\"Functional Hemispherectomy for Refractory Status Epilepticus in 2 Adults.\\" World Neurosurgery 93 (2016): 489.e11-89.e16. Science Direct. Elsevier, Sept. 2016. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. In 2012, a case study following 30 individuals having undergone some form of hemispherectomy in adulthood found that 81% of individuals were seizure free post-procedure. Furthermore, almost all participating patients reported improved quality of life. The conclusion: “adult patients do not have to expect more problems with new deficits, appear to cope quite well, and most profit from surgery in several quality of life domains.”Schramm, J., Delev, D., Wagner, J. et al. Acta Neurochir (2012) 154: 1603. doi:10.1007/s00701-012-1408-z Ultimately, the chances of benefit and improvement to the individual must outweigh the costs. For example, a neurosurgeon would not recommend hemispherectomy in a patient who still possessed significant functionality, despite frequent seizures. Such a patient would risk losing their remaining functionality. Likewise, hemispherectomy likely would be recommended to a patient with debilitating seizures. A patient with little or severely deteriorating functioning does not have as much to risk by having the procedure, thus the chance of benefit to them is greater.Kraemer, Diana L., MD, and David Vossler Gregg, MD. \\"Epilepsy Surgery.\\" emedicine.medscape.com/. Ed. Brian H. Kopell. Medscape, 11 Apr. 2014. Web. 21 Sept. 2016. Depending on the case, a recommendation for a hemispherectomy could be more risky for a child than for an adult. Thus, age is not always the deciding success factor for hemispherectomies.  Results  Overall, hemispherectomy is a successful procedure. A 1996 study of 52 individuals who underwent the surgery found that 96% of patients experienced reduced or completely ceased occurrence of seizures post-surgery.Carson, Benjamin S., MD, Sam Javedan P., John Freeman M., MD, Eileen Vining P.G., MD, Aaron Zuckerberg L., MD, Jeremy Lauer A., MS, and Michael Guarnieri, PhD. \\"Hemispherectomy: A Hemidecortication Approach And Review of 52 Cases.\\" Journal of Neurosurgery 1996th ser. 84.June (n.d.): 903-11. Print. Studies have found no significant long-term effects on memory, personality, or humor, and minimal changes in cognitive function overall. For example, one case followed a patient who had completed college, attended graduate school and scored above average on intelligence tests after undergoing this procedure at age 5. This patient eventually developed \\"superior language and intellectual abilities\\" despite the removal of the left hemisphere, which contains the classical language zones.Smith, A and Sugar O. Development of above normal language and intelligence 21 years after left hemispherectomy. Neurology, 1975 September; 25(9):813-8. When resecting the left hemisphere, evidence indicates that some advanced language functions (e.g., higher order grammar) cannot be entirely assumed by the right side. The extent of advanced language loss is often dependent on the patient's age at the time of surgery. One study following the cognitive development of two adolescent boys who had undergone hemispherectomy found that “brain plasticity and development arise, in part, from the brain’s adaption of behavioral needs to fit available strengths and biases…The boy adapts the task to fit his brain more than he adapts his brain to fit the task.”Coch, Donna, Kurt Fischer W., and Geraldine Dawson. \\"Dynamic Development of the Hemispheric Biases in Three Cases: Cognitive/Hemispheric Cycles, Music, and Hemispherectomy.\\" Human Behavior, Learning, and the Developing Brain. New York: Guilford, 2007. 94–97. Print. Neuroplasticity after hemispherectomy does not imply complete regain of previous functioning, but rather the ability to adapt to the current abilities of the brain in such a way that the individual may still function, however differently the new way of functioning is. Christina Santhouse (now Paravecchia) underwent a Hemispherectomy on February 13, 1996, by Ben Carson when she was eight years old. Previously, she had suffered from Rasmussen's encephalitis, which caused her to experience around 150 seizures a day. After the surgery, her family was told that she would never be able to do many normal activities, such as driving a car or holding a normal job. However, she far surpassed everyone's expectations by going on to earn a master's degree in speech pathology and by getting married and having children of her own.https://www.inquirer.com/philly/news/local/20160214_20_years_after_surgerya_full_life_with_half_a_brain.htmlhttps://apnews.com/d81263a495714dce90c15f1a13d9dafd Traumatic hemispherectomy There are cases where a person that received major trauma to one side of the brain, such as a gunshot wound, and has required a hemispherectomy and survived. The most notable case is that of Ahad Israfil, who lost the right side of his cerebrum in 1987 in a gun-related work accident. He eventually regained most of his faculties, though he still required a wheelchair. It was noted that reconstructive surgery was difficult due to the gunshot shattering his skull, and he lived with a large indentation on that side of his head.

Shepley, a Democratic-Republican, served in the Maine State House before becoming one of the state's U.S. Senators. Shepley resigned from the Senate after two years to become a Justice (and later Chief Justice) of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court. Shepley was born in Groton, Massachusetts. He attended Groton Academy, (now Lawrence Academy at Groton) and in 1814 graduated from Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. He later studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1814. Shepley began practicing law in Saco, Maine (at the time, Maine was part of Massachusetts.) Shepley became a member of the Massachusetts General Court in 1819; the following year, he was a delegate to the Maine constitutional convention, which drew up the constitution for Maine when it became a state. From 1821 until 1833, Shepley was the U.S. attorney for the District of Maine. Later Shepley moved to Portland. He was elected as a Jacksonian Democrat to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1833, until his resignation on March 3, 1836. During Shepley's time in Congress, he served as chairman of the Committee on Engrossed Bills (23rd and 24th Congresses). On October 28, 1836, Shepley became a justice of the Maine Supreme Judicial Court; in 1848 he was elevated to Chief Justice. He served on the Court until October 22, 1855 (he was not a candidate for renomination). The following year he was appointed as the sole commissioner to revise the public laws of Maine. Later he resumed practicing law. Sheply died in Portland and is interred in Evergreen Cemetery in Portland, Maine. His son was George Foster Shepley.

Bunyip recorded a population of 2,468 at the 2016 Census. Its major road connection is via the Princes Highway. The town is named after a mythical creature, known as the Bunyip or Bunyeep, which according to legend lived in and around swampy areas. Mention of it is often found in Australian and Aboriginal mythology.Australian Places - Bunyip, victoria (web archive) History =Before European settlement= The Koo- Wee-Rup and Bunyip areas, among others, are considered to be places of importance to the Victorian Aborigines, particularly the Bunurong people of the Kulin nation, the traditional owners of the area, from whom the word Bunyeep is derived. They believe the Bunyip is a spiritual being which lives near water and preys on humans who come too near.Roberts(1985) quoted in Claessen, Samantha (2007). Bunyip Sanctuary Master Plan. Cardinia Shire Council, Victoria. =1800-1850= The Kooweerup Swamp comprised a region of some stretching from Sawtells Inlet on Westernport Bay to the township of Bunyip in the north-east. The marsh like area was formed by the waters of the many rivers which flow down from the surrounding high country and which often created impenetrable swamplands. The first settlers had great difficulty in cultivating the land because of the dense stands of giant Melaleuca, or tea- tree, large Eucalyptus and Acacia melanoxylon, or blackwood trees, which lay under the surface. In 1827 William Hovell attempted to cross the swamp but found the scrub to be an impenetrable wilderness.Koo Wee Rup (webpage) Retrieved 17 April 2014 from http://www.heritageaustralia.com.au/search.php?state=VIC&region;=67&view;=282 He was impressed by the country, and those areas which were workable held some promise for future development. Europeans with a view to settlement first arrived in the area around 1840 and established the Buneep Run. A report in 1847 by the surveyor and Commissioner of Crown Lands, Charles Tyers, confirmed the earlier findingsReport by surveyor C.J.Tyers to Governor La Trobe (11 March 1847) in \\"The Gippsland Road, 1836-1848\\" by William J Cuthill, from \\"Gippsland Heritage Journal\\" no 10 (June 1991), originally published in the Royal Historical Society of Victoria Magazine, vol 29, no 1 (1959), p 25 but no major drainage works were attempted until decades later. In 1847, a road was surveyed through virgin forest to \\"Buneep\\", as the area was known by its indigenous inhabitants,Rhodes, David (2004). Shire of Cardinia Urban Growth Corridor Aboriginal Heritage Study. (report) Retrieved 25 March 2014 from http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/78302/20081023-0000/www.cardinia.vic.gov.au/Files/Cardiniaaboriginalstudy.pdf which enabled travellers to follow a track that led further east into Gippsland. The survey showed a building, 'Andersons', at the future site of Bunyip. =1850-1900= In December 1857 the Buneep Run was surveyed with a view to establishing a village on the Melbourne to Sale Road and Messrs. Connor, Vale and McKinnon purchased most of the allotments in the area. This site was between the Bunyip River and the present Ellis Road (referred to now as Tonimbuk) north-east of the current town. Connor built the old \\"Buneep Hotel\\" around 1858 to accommodate coach travellers on the long route, a journey that usually took 36 hours. The names recorded in this era for the old town included Buneep, Burneep Burneep and Burra Burneep. At around the same time and in the same area the transport company Cobb and Co established their own trading post. In 1859, a new road, later known as the Old Telegraph Road was surveyed in an attempt to avoid the bad conditions of the previous route to Sale. But, in 1860 there were further improvements made for coach traffic with the opening of the Old Sale Road which crossed the Bunyip River to the south of the old Buneep village, which was abandoned around this time. In 1867 David Connor selected land to build the \\"Bunyip Hotel\\" on the west side of the Bunyip River along the new road. The licensee was David Devaney and the hotel had 14 rooms as well as a 25 stall stable. Located on a low hill some 44 metres above sea-level, a township was established in its final location alongside the Bairnsdale railway line when it arrived in October 1877.TIME- TABLE GIPPSLAND RAILWAY. (31 October 1877). South Bourke and Mornington Journal (Richmond, Vic. : 1872 - 1920), p. 2 Edition: WEEKLY. Retrieved 4 February 2014, from http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article70010424 By March of the following year the section of the line to Moe was completed. Surrounded partly by swamp as it was, the foundation of the town, and railway line, can be attributed to its relatively elevated position, its prior use as a coach stop and the increasing need to provide transport for farm produce and timber. Two hotels, the \\"Butcher's Arms\\" and the \\"Bunyip\\" were set up in 1876 while the railway line was under construction and in 1877 the \\"Railway Family\\" hotel opened with John O'Brien as its licensee. The establishment of these hotels was permanent. The Post Office opened around November 1877 and was known as Bunyip R. S.R. S. is an acronym for Railway Station until 1903. The main outlet for the men looking for work was in the timber industry and local splitters were fully employed having orders to keep them in work for many months. Large eucalyptus trees were selected and were then sawn with a cross cut saw into required lengths. Palings were used for weatherboards, garden fences and roof shingling. Although a number of private attempts were made at drainage works in the 1860s and 70s they were met with little success. In 1887, in addition to the hotels there was also a general store, three or four dwellings and a state school. It took another year for speculators to arrive in the district looking for land and it was about this time that development, and suitable drainage work started on the large swampy land nearby. By 1900 the town included a large produce, livestock and furniture market, opened by Ernest Witton in 1895. And, as the area was becoming more prosperous, a petition was prepared in April 1899 to ask the Bank of Australasia to establish an agency in Bunyip and to send an officer two days a week. =1900-1950= The township of Bunyip grew slowly in its early years, but by the turn of the century there were more businesses than houses, and these served the people in the surrounding agricultural districts as well as the local township. St Joseph's Iona Altar of St Thomas' Stained Glass Window from St Thomas' As the local population grew so did the need for additional services such as churches. St Joseph's Catholic Church at Bunyip South, later renamed Iona was opened in 1900. A new church was constructed in 1940 and blessed by Archbishop Daniel Mannix. Today most parishioners live in the nearby towns, including Bunyip. The current church with its Romanesque Revival architecture and tower is a genuine icon of the district. In 1902 the foundation of St Thomas' Anglican Church was laid on the hill above the town. It is notable for its stained glass windows. The Bunyip Parish of St. Thomas' was originally part of the Gippsland Forest mission in 1879 and early services were held in Kraft's Hall. On 15 October 1902, Mrs. W.A. A'Beckett Snr. of Brighton laid the foundation block for the new church which was designed by architect Frederick L. Klingender. This church was built on land donated by the A'Beckett family and cost over £377 and the opening was conducted by the Right Rev. Bishop Arthur Pain, the first Bishop of the Diocese on 28 December 1902. Extensive alterations were made to the church in 1919 due to damage caused by white ants. In 1980 another restoration appeal was launched to rectify structural problems relating to the roof, to reblock the floor and for repainting. Further renovations and extensions were carried out on the vicarage in 1995 and in 1996 a Lady Chapel was established. Following World War I the Soldiers' Memorial Stone was erected in 1921 to commemorate those townfolk who had been killed. The names of those who fell in World War II and the Vietnam War were subsequently added. In October 1924 a large two-storey brick building named Stacey's new Railway Hotel, containing 35 rooms was opened. This heritage building situated in the main street still remains today. Two years later enormous bushfires threatened the township and destroyed many properties before large fire breaks were cleared to the north of the town in February, 1926. By the end of 1928 electricity had been extended to the Bunyip township =1950-2000= The first hospital stood on land at the top of the hill on High Street, close to the Princes Street intersection. It was burnt down and later replaced by the Shelley Memorial Hospital situated in A'Beckett Street. This was opened in March 1965 when Dr Paul O'Hanlon was the town's medical officer. It had a small midwifery unit, small emergency area and general ward area. It was later converted into a Community Health Centre then the Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Hostel, before finally being demolished and rebuilt as the Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Centre. Bunyip in the 1960s and 1970s sported 4 grocery stores, 2 butchers, 3 milk bars, a shoe shop, 2 hotels, a newsagent, chemist, bakery, travelling solicitor, local paper, 2 banks, hairdressers (men's & women's), a haberdashery shop and an opportunity shop. =Modern period= Bunyip never witnessed a boom period, experiencing as it has slow and steady growth over the last 100 plus years. Many descendants of pioneers remain in the district. In the 1970s there was a concerted push by town locals to promote Bunyip and many residents could be seen wearing brightly coloured 'We support Bunyip' T-shirts. =Notable events= Some excerpts from the district newspapers of the time document the growth of the town:https://web.archive.org/web/20081211140405/http://www.bunyip.org.au/Snapshot/HistoryofBunyip/tabid/127/Default.aspx * June 1880, H.A.

Daniels delivered his product himself, either in a horse and cart or pushing a wheelbarrow. * May 1913, Mr Thomas, a dentist advertised that he was visiting Bunyip and would be consulting at the Gippsland Hotel. Apparently before his arrival the local station master obliged by extracting teeth with his ticket clippers. * Farmers persisted with growing tobacco but crops were spoilt by mould. A pea factory operated opposite the cemetery for a few years. A violet farm was known to have existed and many years later Bunyip Clothing Factory operated in Longwarry Road. * February 1930, fire destroyed five shops in Bunyip. * December 1967. Five members of the Bunyip Football Club; Peter Kay, Michael Breheny, Noel Heatley, Barry Sullivan and Don Smith, perished when their plane crashed at Daly Waters in the Northern Territory. A memorial was established at the Bunyip Recreational Ground in their memory. Community =Commercial= The Bunyip shopping precinct consists of a wide variety of businesses. These include a post office, chemist, hair dressers, Fast food shops, grocery stores, accountants and real estate agents, a bakery, a newsagent, Commonwealth and Bendigo banks, hardware and timber merchants, Lawn mower outlet, a veterinarian and two pubs (known locally as the Top Pub and the Bottom Pub due to their position on the sloping main street). In 2007 the Foodworks franchise came to the town when it opened a large supermarket. Bunyip has an \\"opportunity shop\\", with proceeds donated to local organisations. Previous businesses have included Westpac Bank, a drapery store (owned and serviced by Mr and Mrs Frederick Mitchell for many years), a real estate store, 2 petrol/garages (BGS Motors & Frank Kinder's BP), Pound and Ure's Electrical store, a gift shop, shoe shop, Flett's general store, cool store on the corner of Hope Street and Railway Avenue and Manson's Interstate Haulage. =Health and lifestyle= Bunyip has two kindergartens and a play group as well as the \\"Hillview Bunyip Aged Care Centre\\" which was renovated and extended in 2011. The towns health needs are catered for by a modern clinic situated opposite the aged care centre. Bunyip has an Australian Rules football team and includes juniors as well as seniors sections. Known as the Bunyip Bulldogs, it was formed in 1902, and currently plays in the Ellinbank & District Football League. Prior to belonging to the Ellinbank League, Bunyip belonged to the West Gippsland League. An affiliated netball club, which also caters for junior and senior members, plays in the same league. The Bunyip and District Soccer Club caters for followers of that game and draws players from the local area. =Attractions= Southerly views from Bunyip Dating from 1900, Bunyip has staged an annual agricultural show with categories for horses, dogs, cats, cookery, art work and many others. The Bunyip country music festival is held the 1st Sunday of February each year and attracts performers, and audiences from all over Victoria (Australia). As a regular feature the Bunyip Railway Hotel conducts an amateur music night where musicians can perform to a live audience. Bunyip has a wildlife sanctuary which is popular with bird watchers. Over fifty different types of birds have been sighted there. It is located north of the town and comprises a reserve of 13 hectares. As it was once part of the Koo Wee Rup Swamp it can often be wet underfoot, particularly during spring time. The sanctuary is home to animals such as frogs, lizards, snakes and water birds and is a rare reserve in this district. For the casual visitor to the area informative signage, brochures, picnic tables and a choice of walking trails have all been created.Sanctuary =Facilities= Bunyip Hall The town has two schools, a State School named Bunyip Primary School, established in 1880School Profile.

The Bunyip railway station, Victoria, situated on the Bairnsdale railway line is in the growth corridor and is serviced by modern V/Line VLocity trains. This station was once an important transportation link for both passengers, seeking to buy train tickets, and for parcel and goods freight. It was manned seven days a week and operated into the 1990s before being demolished and replaced with a metal passenger shelter. In its heyday, there was a livestock holding paddock to the south which ran alongside a railway siding. Animals were held here before being loaded onto the train bound for the livestock market in Dandenong. Today all that remains are relics of cracked concrete flooring slabs overgrown and hidden by weeds. The Bunyip Urban Fire Station is organised under the auspices of the Country Fire Authority and is located opposite the Police Station, Pearson Street, Bunyip. Up until the early 1990s the town also had a Rural and Urban Fire Brigade servicing Bunyip, Garfield and the surrounding areas of Iona, Vervale, Garfield North and Tonimbuk, which ceased to operate at that time. Members are voluntary and undergo training procedures on joining and include both male and female. The first female to join the brigade was Jenny Beavis in the early 1980s when females were admitted to the ranks. Bunyip Fire Brigade also enjoys an active 'Competition Running Team' who engage in competition training with other brigades at a district and statewide level between October and March each year. Some long serving members(more than 50 years) who have previously held office have included Joe Cumming as Captain for 31 years, John Beavis as secretary for 30 years and Lionel McGill as Lieutenant. All of whom are still living and continue to be active members although they are now into their 70s and early 80s. These members have dedicated extensive time over the years to help develop and shape both the brigade as well as mentoring junior officers and volunteers who have been and continue to be members. =Media= Warragul Radio stations Star FM and 3GG service this region. The original paper servicing the area was called \\"The Bunyip and Garfield Express\\". This was published for many years before finally succumbing to rising costs and larger papers replacing it. A local newsletter 'Bunyip and District Community News' now services the district. =Opera= Light opera companies that are based in Melbourne occasionally visit Bunyip on a regional tour. The Gilbert and Sullivan Opera Victoria performed Iolanthe at Bunyip Hall, Main St on Saturday evening, 29 April 2017.

The Two Black Crows (also called The Black Crows and Moran and Mack) was a blackface comedy act popular in the 1920s and 1930s. The duo appeared in vaudeville, on Broadway, on radio, comedy records, and in film features and shorts. History The act was originated by Charles Sellers (1888–1934), who hired actor John Swor as his partner. \\"Swor & Mack\\" enjoyed moderate success until Swor left the act. He was replaced by George Moran. The team of Moran and Mack caught on and became major recording stars. The Two Black Crows became a weekly radio show in 1928; Moran and Mack also guest-starred on Fred Waring's radio show in 1933. Although Moran and Mack's gags were mostly corny and the characters were stereotypical (one practical but naive, the other seemingly slow and lazy yet quick with a quip and a certain skewed logic), the relationship depicted plus their laconic delivery made them one of the most successful of comedy teams. The team was known for two catchphrases. Moran would remind Mack of some unfortunate event, causing Mack to say, \\"Why bring up?\\" Mack frequently would interrupt Moran's description of something with a drawling \\"What that?\\" The duo of Moran and Mack appeared in vaudeville with W.C. Fields, on Broadway in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1920 and in Earl Carroll's Vanities in the mid-1920s. They also appeared in George White's Scandals and The Greenwich Village Follies. At the height of their popularity, after completing their first talking feature film, Moran had a salary dispute with Mack and sued him in 1930. A judge ruled that Mack legally owned the act and could pay whatever salary he wanted. Moran quit. He was replaced by John Swor's brother, Bert Swor, who adopted the name Moran. The second \\"Moran and Mack\\" talkie (without George Moran) faltered at the box office, and the team made no further films until 1933, when the low-budget Educational Pictures studio hired them for a feature film and a series of \\"Two Black Crows\\" short subjects. Charles Mack died in an automobile accident on January 11, 1934. This ended the act, although George Moran did try to revive it with other partners. Moran would later appear in three W. C. Fields films, The Fatal Glass of Beer, My Little Chickadee, and The Bank Dick. Moran died on August 1, 1949. Legacy Their catch phrase, \\"Who wants a worm, anyhow?\\", was the punchline to a lengthy dialogue that Moran initiated by telling Mack that, \\"The early bird catches the worm\\". Mack of course had never heard the expression, so he took it literally, and frustrated Moran by repeatedly asking inane questions about the saying. \\"Who wants a worm, anyhow?\\" was the closing statement by the crow in a Warner Bros. cartoon called The Wacky Worm, and parts of the routine appeared in other Warner cartoons. Jokes Typical joke: :MACK: On our farm, we had a thousand , an' 999 o'em laid eggs. :MORAN: What was wrong with de udder one? :MACK: Uh, he was de head man. Once Moran played a blast on his kazoo. :MACK (annoyed): Boy, even if dat was , I wouldn't like it! :MORAN: I can play on dis! :MACK: You caint play on dat! And on it went. This shows at least how old the following joke is: :MACK: I'll meet you down by de pig-pen. You better keep yo hat on so's I'll know ya! Even a watermelon joke, the essence of racial stereotyping, took on a certain surrealist air in their hands: :MACK: Wish I had an ice-cold . :MORAN: Oh lawdy. Me too. :MACK: Wish I had a thousand ice-cold . :MORAN: Glory be. I bet if you had a thousand ice-cold , you'd give me one. :MACK: No, no siree!

The book explains Hawkins' memory-prediction framework theory of the brain and describes some of its consequences. Outline Hawkins outlines the book as follows: A personal history The first chapter is a brief history of Hawkins' interest in neuroscience juxtaposed against a history of artificial intelligence research. Hawkins uses a story of his failed application to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to illustrate a conflict of ideas. Hawkins believed (and ostensibly continues to believe) creating true artificial intelligence will only be possible with intellectual progress in the discipline of neuroscience. Hawkins writes that the scientific establishment (as symbolized by MIT) has historically rejected the relevance of neuroscience to artificial intelligence. Indeed, some artificial intelligence researchers have \\"[taken] pride in ignoring neurobiology\\" (p. 12). Hawkins is an electrical engineer by training, and a neuroscientist by inclination. He used electrical engineering concepts as well as the studies of neuroscience to formulate his framework. In particular, Hawkins treats the propagation of nerve impulses in our nervous system as an encoding problem, specifically, a future predicting state machine, similar in principle to feed- forward error-correcting state machines. The theory Hawkins' basic idea is that the brain is a mechanism to predict the future, specifically, hierarchical regions of the brain predict their future input sequences. Perhaps not always far in the future, but far enough to be of real use to an organism. As such, the brain is a feed forward hierarchical state machine with special properties that enable it to learn. The state machine actually controls the behavior of the organism. Since it is a feed forward state machine, the machine responds to future events predicted from past data. The hierarchy is capable of memorizing frequently observed sequences (Cognitive modules) of patterns and developing invariant representations. Higher levels of the cortical hierarchy predict the future on a longer time scale, or over a wider range of sensory input. Lower levels interpret or control limited domains of experience, or sensory or effector systems. Connections from the higher level states predispose some selected transitions in the lower-level state machines. Hebbian learning is part of the framework, in which the event of learning physically alters neurons and connections, as learning takes place. Vernon Mountcastle's formulation of a cortical column is a basic element in the framework. Hawkins places particular emphasis on the role of the interconnections from peer columns, and the activation of columns as a whole. He strongly implies that a column is the cortex's physical representation of a state in a state machine. As an engineer, any specific failure to find a natural occurrence of some process in his framework does not signal a fault in the memory-prediction framework per se, but merely signals that the natural process has performed Hawkins' functional decomposition in a different, unexpected way, as Hawkins' motivation is to create intelligent machines. For example, for the purposes of his framework, the nerve impulses can be taken to form a temporal sequence (but phase encoding could be a possible implementation of such a sequence; these details are immaterial for the framework). Predictions of the theory of the memory-prediction framework His predictions use the visual system as a prototype for some example predictions, such as Predictions 2, 8, 10, and 11. Other predictions cite the auditory system ( Predictions 1, 3, 4, and 7). *An Appendix of 11 Testable Predictions: = Enhanced neural activity in anticipation of a sensory event= 1. In all areas of cortex, Hawkins (2004) predicts \\"we should find anticipatory cells\\", cells that fire in anticipation of a sensory event. :Note: As of 2005 mirror neurons have been observed to fire before an anticipated event. = Spatially specific prediction= 2. In primary sensory cortex, Hawkins predicts, for example, \\"we should find anticipatory cells in or near V1, at a precise location in the visual field (the scene)\\". It has been experimentally determined, for example, after mapping the angular position of some objects in the visual field, there will be a one-to-one correspondence of cells in the scene to the angular positions of those objects. Hawkins predicts that when the features of a visual scene are known in a memory, anticipatory cells should fire before the actual objects are seen in the scene. = Prediction should stop propagating in the cortical column at layers 2 and 3= 3. In layers 2 and 3, predictive activity (neural firing) should stop propagating at specific cells, corresponding to a specific prediction. Hawkins does not rule out anticipatory cells in layers 4 and 5. = \\"Name cells\\" at layers 2 and 3 should preferentially connect to layer 6 cells of cortex= 4. Learned sequences of firings comprise a representation of temporally constant invariants. Hawkins calls the cells which fire in this sequence \\"name cells\\". Hawkins suggests that these name cells are in layer 2, physically adjacent to layer 1. Hawkins does not rule out the existence of layer 3 cells with dendrites in layer 1, which might perform as name cells. = \\"Name cells\\" should remain ON during a learned sequence= 5. By definition, a temporally constant invariant will be active during a learned sequence. Hawkins posits that these cells will remain active for the duration of the learned sequence, even if the remainder of the cortical column is shifting state. Since we do not know the encoding of the sequence, we do not yet know the definition of ON or active; Hawkins suggests that the ON pattern may be as simple as a simultaneous AND (i.e., the name cells simultaneously \\"light up\\") across an array of name cells. :See Neural ensemble#Encoding for grandmother neurons which perform this type of function. = \\"Exception cells\\" should remain OFF during a learned sequence = 6. Hawkins' novel prediction is that certain cells are inhibited during a learned sequence. A class of cells in layers 2 and 3 should NOT fire during a learned sequence, the axons of these \\"exception cells\\" should fire only if a local prediction is failing. This prevents flooding the brain with the usual sensations, leaving only exceptions for post-processing. = \\"Exception cells\\" should propagate unanticipated events= 7. If an unusual event occurs (the learned sequence fails), the \\"exception cells\\" should fire, propagating up the cortical hierarchy to the hippocampus, the repository of new memories. = \\"Aha! cells\\" should trigger predictive activity = 8. Hawkins predicts a cascade of predictions, when recognition occurs, propagating down the cortical column (with each saccade of the eye over a learned scene, for example). = Pyramidal cells should detect coincidences of synaptic activity on thin dendrites= 9. Pyramidal cells should be capable of detecting coincident events on thin dendrites, even for a neuron with thousands of synapses. Hawkins posits a temporal window (presuming time-encoded firing) which is necessary for his theory to remain viable. = Learned representations move down the cortical hierarchy, with training = 10. Hawkins posits, for example, that if the inferotemporal (IT) layer has learned a sequence, that eventually cells in V4 will also learn the sequence. =\\"Name cells\\" exist in all regions of cortex= 11. Hawkins predicts that \\"name cells\\" will be found in all regions of the cortex.

After the fire of 1805, Campus Martius (from the Latin for Field of Mars, where Roman heroes walked) was the focal point of Judge Augustus Woodward's plans to rebuild the city. It was named for the principal square in Marietta, Ohio, the first capital of the Northwest Territories.Farmer, Silas. History of Detroit and Wayne County and Early Michigan (Detroit: S. Farmer and Co., 1890) V.1, p.74. see https://books.google.com/books?id=_Od5AAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA74&dq;=detroit+campus+martius+marietta&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiS65jp5vDeAhUww1kKHefCDNQQ6AEINDAC#v=onepage&q;=detroit%20campus%20martius%20marietta&f;=false Description Campus Martius in 1907 Campus Martius in 1914 The park is located at the intersection of Woodward Avenue and Michigan Avenue, four blocks south of Grand Circus Park. The original park covered several acres and was a major gathering area for citizens. The park was lost in the 1900s as the city's downtown was reconfigured to accommodate increased vehicular traffic. Hart Plaza, along the riverfront, was designed to replace Campus Martius as a point of importance. But as Hart Plaza is a primarily hard-surfaced area, many residents came to lament the lack of true park space in the city's downtown area. This led to calls to rebuild Campus Martius, the site of the Civil War- era Michigan Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, located across from the new Compuware Headquarters. The park is also where the point of origin of Detroit's coordinate system is located. north of this point is Seven Mile Road; north is Eight Mile Road, and so on. The point of origin is marked by a medallion embedded in the stone walkway. It is situated in the western point of the diamond surrounding the Woodward Fountain, just in front of the park's concession building. The new Campus Martius Park was dedicated November 19, 2004 and includes two performance stages, sculptures, public spaces and a seasonal ice skating rink. At , the park is smaller than its predecessor, as a full restoration of the original would have required the demolition of several buildings. However, the city increased the amount of park space in the area by constructing the new Cadillac Square Park, which opened in summer 2007, immediately to the east of Campus Martius. The park's skating rink is designed to resemble the Rockefeller Center rink in New York City but is larger in size. Since its opening the rink has been operated by Magic Ice USA, Inc. Campus Martius Park is the home of the annual Motown Winter Blast, an event that has drawn more than 450,000 people to the downtown area every year and it has become the site of the city's annual Christmas tree lighting celebration, held the Monday before Thanksgiving. Thousands come to hear Christmas music and countdown to the lighting of the city's official Christmas tree and other decorations to mark the start of the holiday season. Cadillac Square Park Cadillac Square Park is another re-established park in the area. It lies immediately to the east of Campus Martius Park. Until 2001, the area where the park is located was occupied by a bus transfer station constructed in the 1960s. From 1841 until 1891, Cadillac Square was the site of the Detroit Farmer's Market. The new park is site of the relocated Bagley Memorial Fountain which previously occupied a spot on Campus Martius. In January 2008, the city of Detroit announced plans for a new Cadillac Centre, a $150 million mixed-use residential entertainment-retail complex attached to the Cadillac Tower. Designed by architect Anthony Caradonna and patterned after the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, the contemporary steel and glass 24-story skyscraper complex to be located on Campus Martius Park, was planned to begin construction in the fall of 2009, but was indefinitely postponed by the city in October of that year when the developers failed to meet key agreements with the city. The French sport of pétanque is played at Cadillac Square each workday from noon to 1 p.m. The similar Italian sport of bocce is also played there.

This theory concerns the role of the mammalian neocortex and its associations with the hippocampi and the thalamus in matching sensory inputs to stored memory patterns and how this process leads to predictions of what will happen in the future.  Overview  The theory is motivated by the observed similarities between the brain structures (especially neocortical tissue) that are used for a wide range of behaviours available to mammals. The theory posits that the remarkably uniform physical arrangement of cortical tissue reflects a single principle or algorithm which underlies all cortical information processing. The basic processing principle is hypothesized to be a feedback/recall loop which involves both cortical and extra-cortical participation (the latter from the thalamus and the hippocampi in particular).  The basic theory: recognition and prediction in bi-directional hierarchies  The central concept of the memory-prediction framework is that bottom-up inputs are matched in a hierarchy of recognition, and evoke a series of top-down expectations encoded as potentiations. These expectations interact with the bottom-up signals to both analyse those inputs and generate predictions of subsequent expected inputs. Each hierarchy level remembers frequently observed temporal sequences of input patterns and generates labels or 'names' for these sequences. When an input sequence matches a memorized sequence at a given level of the hierarchy, a label or 'name' is propagated up the hierarchy – thus eliminating details at higher levels and enabling them to learn higher- order sequences. This process produces increased invariance at higher levels. Higher levels predict future input by matching partial sequences and projecting their expectations to the lower levels. However, when a mismatch between input and memorized/predicted sequences occurs, a more complete representation propagates upwards. This causes alternative 'interpretations' to be activated at higher levels, which in turn generates other predictions at lower levels. Consider, for example, the process of vision. Bottom-up information starts as low-level retinal signals (indicating the presence of simple visual elements and contrasts). At higher levels of the hierarchy, increasingly meaningful information is extracted, regarding the presence of lines, regions, motions, etc. Even further up the hierarchy, activity corresponds to the presence of specific objects – and then to behaviours of these objects. Top-down information fills in details about the recognized objects, and also about their expected behaviour as time progresses. The sensory hierarchy induces a number of differences between the various levels. As one moves up the hierarchy, representations have increased: * Extent – for example, larger areas of the visual field, or more extensive tactile regions. * Temporal stability – lower-level entities change quickly, whereas, higher- level percepts tend to be more stable. * Abstraction – through the process of successive extraction of invariant features, increasingly abstract entities are recognized. The relationship between sensory and motor processing is an important aspect of the basic theory. It is proposed that the motor areas of the cortex consist of a behavioural hierarchy similar to the sensory hierarchy, with the lowest levels consisting of explicit motor commands to musculature and the highest levels corresponding to abstract prescriptions (e.g. 'resize the browser'). The sensory and motor hierarchies are tightly coupled, with behaviour giving rise to sensory expectations and sensory perceptions driving motor processes. Finally, it is important to note that all the memories in the cortical hierarchy have to be learnt – this information is not pre-wired in the brain. Hence, the process of extracting this representation from the flow of inputs and behaviours is theorized as a process that happens continually during cognition. = Other terms = Hawkins has extensive training as an electrical engineer. Another way to describe the theory (hinted at in his book) is as a learning hierarchy of feed forward stochastic state machines. In this view, the brain is analyzed as an encoding problem, not too dissimilar from future-predicting error-correction codes. The hierarchy is a hierarchy of abstraction, with the higher level machines' states representing more abstract conditions or events, and these states predisposing lower-level machines to perform certain transitions. The lower level machines model limited domains of experience, or control or interpret sensors or effectors. The whole system actually controls the organism's behavior. Since the state machine is \\"feed forward\\", the organism responds to future events predicted from past data. Since it is hierarchical, the system exhibits behavioral flexibility, easily producing new sequences of behavior in response to new sensory data. Since the system learns, the new behavior adapts to changing conditions. That is, the evolutionary purpose of the brain is to predict the future, in admittedly limited ways, so as to change it.  Neurophysiological implementation  The hierarchies described above are theorized to occur primarily in mammalian neocortex. In particular, neocortex is assumed to consist of a large number of columns (as surmised also by Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle from anatomical and theoretical considerations). Each column is attuned to a particular feature at a given level in a hierarchy. It receives bottom-up inputs from lower levels, and top-down inputs from higher levels. (Other columns at the same level also feed into a given column, and serve mostly to inhibit the activation exclusive representations.) When an input is recognized – that is, acceptable agreement is obtained between the bottom-up and top-down sources – a column generates outputs which in turn propagate to both lower and higher levels. = Cortex = These processes map well to specific layers within mammalian cortex. (The cortical layers should not be confused with different levels of the processing hierarchy: all the layers in a single column participate as one element in a single hierarchical level). Bottom-up input arrives at layer 4 (L4), whence it propagates to L2 and L3 for recognition of the invariant content. Top-down activation arrives to L2 and L3 via L1 (the mostly axonal layer that distributes activation locally across columns). L2 and L3 compare bottom up and top-down information, and generate either the invariant 'names' when sufficient match is achieved, or the more variable signals that occur when this fails. These signals are propagated up the hierarchy (via L5) and also down the hierarchy (via L6 and L1). = Thalamus = To account for storage and recognition of sequences of patterns, a combination of two processes is suggested. The nonspecific thalamus acts as a 'delay line' – that is, L5 activates this brain area, which re-activates L1 after a slight delay. Thus, the output of one column generates L1 activity, which will coincide with the input to a column which is temporally subsequent within a sequence. This time ordering operates in conjunction with the higher-level identification of the sequence, which does not change in time; hence, activation of the sequence representation causes the lower-level components to be predicted one after the other. (Besides this role in sequencing, the thalamus is also active as sensory waystation – these roles apparently involve distinct regions of this anatomically non-uniform structure.) = Hippocampus = Another anatomically diverse brain structure which is hypothesized to play an important role in hierarchical cognition is the hippocampus. It is well known that damage to both hippocampi impairs the formation of long-term declarative memory; individuals with such damage are unable to form new memories of episodic nature, although they can recall earlier memories without difficulties and can also learn new skills. In the current theory, the hippocampi are thought of as the top level of the cortical hierarchy; they are specialized to retain memories of events that propagate all the way to the top. As such events fit into predictable patterns, they become memorizable at lower levels in the hierarchy. (Such movement of memories down the hierarchy is, incidentally, a general prediction of the theory.) Thus, the hippocampi continually memorize 'unexpected' events (that is, those not predicted at lower levels); if they are damaged, the entire process of memorization through the hierarchy is compromised. In 2016 Jeff Hawkins hypothesized that cortical columns did not just capture a sensation, but also the relative location of that sensation, in three dimensions rather than two (situated capture), in relation to what was around it.Cade Metz The New York Times (15 October 2018) \\"A new view of how we think\\" pp.B1,B4 see: 'Clarity Over a Coffee Cup' \\"When the brain builds a model of the world, everything has a location relative to everything else\\" —Jeff Hawkins.  Explanatory successes and predictions  The memory-prediction framework explains a number of psychologically salient aspects of cognition. For example, the ability of experts in any field to effortlessly analyze and remember complex problems within their field is a natural consequence of their formation of increasingly refined conceptual hierarchies. Also, the procession from 'perception' to 'understanding' is readily understandable as a result of the matching of top-down and bottom-up expectations. Mismatches, in contrast, generate the exquisite ability of biological cognition to detect unexpected perceptions and situations. (Deficiencies in this regard are a common characteristic of current approaches to artificial intelligence.) Besides these subjectively satisfying explanations, the framework also makes a number of testable predictions. For example, the important role that prediction plays throughout the sensory hierarchies calls for anticipatory neural activity in certain cells throughout sensory cortex. In addition, cells that 'name' certain invariants should remain active throughout the presence of those invariants, even if the underlying inputs change. The predicted patterns of bottom-up and top-down activity – with former being more complex when expectations are not met – may be detectable, for example by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Although these predictions are not highly specific to the proposed theory, they are sufficiently unambiguous to make verification or rejection of its central tenets possible. See On Intelligence for details on the predictions and findings.  Contribution and limitations  By design, the current theory builds on the work of numerous neurobiologists, and it may be argued that most of these ideas have already been proposed by researchers such as Grossberg and Mountcastle. On the other hand, the novel separation of the conceptual mechanism (i.e., bidirectional processing and invariant recognition) from the biological details (i.e., neural layers, columns and structures) lays the foundation for abstract thinking about a wide range of cognitive processes. The most significant limitation of this theory is its current lack of detail. For example, the concept of invariance plays a crucial role; Hawkins posits \\"name cells\\" for at least some of these invariants. (See also Neural ensemble#Encoding for grandmother neurons which perform this type of function, and mirror neurons for a somatosensory system viewpoint.) But it is far from obvious how to develop a mathematically rigorous definition, which will carry the required conceptual load across the domains presented by Hawkins. Similarly, a complete theory will require credible details on both the short-term dynamics and the learning processes that will enable the cortical layers to behave as advertised.

Hisamitsu was virtual Super Potentate of Satsuma Domain.The younger brother of Shimazu Nariakira, Hisamitsu served as regent for his underage son Tadayoshi, who became the 12th and last daimyō of Satsuma Domain. Hisamitsu was instrumental in the efforts of the southern Satsuma, Chōshū, and Tosa clans to bring down the Tokugawa Shogunate. Hisamitsu held the court title of Ōsumi no Kami (大隈守). Biography Hisamitsu was born in Kagoshima Castle in 1817, the son of Shimazu Narioki, the 10th daimyō; Hisamitsu's name at birth was Kanenoshin; his mother was Yura, Narioki's concubine. He was briefly adopted by the Tanegashima clan as an heir, but was returned to the Shimazu family while still a child. At age eight, he was adopted into the Shigetomi-Shimazu, a branch family of the main Shimazu house. Kanenoshin, now named Matajirō, came of age in 1828, and took the adult name . At age 22, following his marriage to the daughter of the previous Shigetomi lord, Tadakimi, he inherited family headship. He was supported as a candidate for succession to the main Shimazu house during the . His half-brother Nariakira won the dispute and succeeded their father as lord of Satsuma; however, following Nariakira's death in 1858, Tadayuki's young son Mochihisa (later known as Tadayoshi) was chosen as the next lord of Satsuma. Tadayuki gained a position of primacy in Satsuma, due to his status as the lord's father. He returned to the main Shimazu house in 1861, and it was then that he changed his name to Hisamitsu. In 1862, Hisamitsu went to Kyoto, and took part in the increasingly Kyoto-centered politics of the 1860s; he was a part of the kōbu- gattai political faction. It was during Hisamitsu's return from a stay in Edo, when three Englishmen on horseback offended his retainers by refusing to dismount or stand aside. Their failure to observe proper etiquette resulted in some argument, a chase, and one was killed, in what came to be known as the Namamugi Incident. Hisamitsu remained at the core of the kōbu-gattai movement in Kyoto, until Satsuma's secret alliance with men of Chōshu. He supported the Satsuma domain's military actions in the Boshin War, and retired soon after the Meiji Restoration. In the Meiji era, he was given the rank of duke (), the highest of the newly-created kazoku nobility and which was awarded for his clan's participation during the Restoration. Hisamitsu died in December 6,1887, at age 70. He was accorded a state funeral. He is buried in Kagoshima Prefecture.

What acknowledgment, if any, is sent by the recipient to the sender is dependent on the email software of the recipient. Two notification services are available for email: delivery status notifications (DSNs) and message disposition notifications (MDNs). Whether or not such an acknowledgement of receipt is sent depends on the configuration of the recipient’s email software. Delivery status notifications DSN is both a service that may optionally be provided by Message Transfer Agents (MTAs) using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), or a message format used to return indications of message delivery to the sender of the message. Specifically, the DSN SMTP service is used to request indications of successful delivery or delivery failure (in the DSN format) be returned. Issuance of a DSN upon delivery failure is the default behavior, whereas issuance of a DSN upon successful delivery requires a specific request from the sender. However, for various reasons, it is possible for a message to be delivered, and a DSN is returned to the sender indicating successful delivery, but the message subsequently fails to be seen by the recipient or even made available to them. The DSN SMTP extension, message format, and associated delivery status codes are specified in RFCs 3461 through 3464 and 6522. Message disposition notifications MDNs provide a notification of the \\"disposition\\" of a message - indicating, for example, whether it is read by a recipient, discarded before being read, etc. However, for privacy reasons, and also for backward compatibility, requests for MDNs are entirely advisory in nature - i.e. recipients are free to ignore such requests. The format and usage MDNs are specified in RFC 3798. A description of how multiple Mail User Agents (MUAs) should handle the generation of MDNs in an Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP4) environment is provided in RFC 3503. A non-standard but widely used way to request return receipts is with the \\"Return-Receipt- To:\\" (RRT) field in the e-mail header, with the email return address specified. The first time a user opens an email message containing this field in the header, the client will typically prompt the user whether or not to send a return receipt.

He is a recipient of the Ibrahim Prize. Prior to his presidency, Pohamba served in various ministerial positions, beginning at Namibia's independence in 1990. He was Minister of Home Affairs from 1990 to 1995, Minister of Fisheries from 1995 to 1997, Minister without Portfolio from 1997 to 2000, and Minister of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation from 2000 to 2005. He was also secretary- general of SWAPO from 1997 to 2002 and vice-president of SWAPO from 2002 to 2007.

In 1964, he went to Lusaka to set up SWAPO's Zambian office, and on his return, met the man who was later to become president, Sam Nujoma. Until the achievement of Namibian independence, Pohamba represented SWAPO across Africa, He studied politics in the Soviet Union for a time in the early 1980s. He headed SWAPO's 1989 election campaign and was a SWAPO member of the Constituent Assembly, which was in place from November 1989 to March 1990,List of members of the Constituent Assembly, parliament.gov.na. before becoming a member of the National Assembly at independence in March 1990.

Under Pohamba's leadership as Minister of Lands, Resettlement and Rehabilitation, Namibia initiated a policy of partial land expropriation from landed white farmers to landless black ones. This policy was introduced to supplement the existing one of \\"willing buyer-willing seller\\" to try speed up the process. After becoming president, Pohamba also took over the chancellorship of the University of Namibia from Nujoma in November 2011. He was active in the Ovamboland People's Organization, a national liberation movement that in 1960 transformed into SWAPO. Pohamba was a founding member of the organisation's new incarnation and left his job in the mine to work as a full-time organiser for the group. Pohamba returned several times to South West Africa to work on behalf of SWAPO, and he was again charged with agitating against South African rule. =Presidency= Pohamba with United States President George W.

The book was written by Australians Tom Gleisner, Santo Cilauro, and Rob Sitch. Along with the other Jetlag Travel volumes, 2003's Molvanîa and 2006's San Sombrèro, the book parodies both the language of heritage tourism and the legacy of colonialism and imperialism. About Phaic Tăn The Kingdom of Phaic Tăn is a composite creation of a number of stereotypes and clichés about Indochinese countries. Phaic Tăn is said to be situated in Indochina. Place names in Phaic Tăn initially seem to be Vietnamese or Thai, but they form English language puns, hence the capital is called \\"Bumpattabumpah\\" (\\"bumper to bumper\\"). \\"Phaic Tăn\\" can be read as \\"Fake Tan\\". Also, the districts are the mountainous \\"Pha Phlung\\" (\\"far flung\\"), the infertile \\"Sukkondat\\" (\\"suck on that\\"), the hyper \\"Buhng Lunhg\\" (\\"bung lung\\"; Australian slang 'bung', meaning 'failed'), and the exotic \\"Thong On\\". The country was formerly a colony of France, but was liberated in the early 20th century through student and Communist uprisings. A Marxist dictatorship under Chau Quoc continued until his death in 1947, which prompted the country to launch into a lengthy civil war. Eventually a CIA- backed coup (\\"Operation Freedom\\") made the country into a military dictatorship which it remains to this day. The country has a popular royal family, though the current king has been deposed no fewer than 25 times. Like Molvanîa, the humour of the book comes from the guide's attempts to present Phaic Tăn as an attractive, enjoyable country when it is really little more than a squalid, third-world dump. The country is frequently plagued by monsoons and earthquakes and many armed militia groups still patrol the streets. The Phaic Tăn people are presented to be extremely superstitious, and obsessed with the concept of luck. The index of the book contains a list of almost 600 numbers the Phaic Tănese consider lucky, plus two considered unlucky (3 and 6). Turning left while driving is also considered unlucky, which causes a lot of traffic problems. Also unlucky is asking for a non- exotic massage, having more than 5 holes in Quic Pot, and to lose a lottery. The current king is Sukhimbol Tralanhng III, ninth king of the Angit dynasty. King Falanhng prides himself on being something of a musician and composer. In fact, the country's national anthem was actually written by him and whenever it is played Phaic Tănese will immediately stand and place one hand over each ear. His wife is the very overweight Suahm Luprang, his crown prince is the perverted Ferduk, his daughter is the also overweight (and embarrassed) Buk Phang, and his youngest son is Luat the Brooding, who was arrested for misusing a gun. =Geography and provinces= According to the book, Phaic Tăn is a country situated in Indochina of South-east Asia. It is shown in the book's map as being bounded to the south by the Lhong Chuk Sea and the Pong and Kut Rivers to the north and east respectively. Phaic Tăn is depicted as being roughly 650 kilometres abroad from east-west at its broadest point and the same distance from its far geographical north-east tip to the Pong Delta in the country's south-east. The country is divided by several rivers, including the Sirikan, Upper Kut and the Nahkthong. The country's major rivers are the Pong and Nahkthong, which both finish in the Pong and Nahkthong Deltas respectively. Phaic Tăn is made up of four provinces (going in order clockwise), Sukkondat, Pha Phlung, Buhng Lung and Thong On. The provinces are connected by roads, but not by rail, as rail gauges vary throughout the country and sometimes even on the same line. In one page the country's location is contradicted from being in Indochina to being between North and South Korea. Bumpattabumpah The capital city of Phaic Tăn is Bumpattabumpah, which is situated in Buhng Lung in a roughly central position on the Pong River and at the west end of the Upper Kut River. Bumpattabumpah is Phaic Tăn's largest city, and presumably the most populous. According to the book, Bumpattabumpah means \\"water convergence\\" and refers to the fact that the city is situated where the country's main river, the Pong, meets untreated effluent from a sewage treatment plant further upstream. Also, Bumpattabumpah was previously named \\"Phxux Xauan\\" but was changed because a survey revealed that less than 12% of the population were able to pronounce it. An in-book map of Bumpattabumpah shows the names of its suburbs, all English-language puns: Qic Phuk, Phlat Tiht and Dud Bhonk. Many of the names of the roads throughout the city are also English puns, as is the name of the city's and country's major airport, Phlat Chat Airport. High smog levels in the capital city mean that office blocks require no window tinting, a result of heavy amounts of air pollution. In 1997, developers announced plans to build the tallest office block in the world. Construction actually began but only a short while after the foundations were dug the Asian economic crisis hit, meaning the project was completely shelved. Bumpattabumpah now boasts the largest unfenced hole in the world. Sukkondat Sukkondat is traditionally Phaic Tăn's poorest province, due to the infertility of its soil, lack of natural resources and high number of casinos. An agricultural province, farmers harvest hay in order to camouflage their true primary crop, opium. The capital of the province is Sloh Phan, which is located about ninety kilometres north-east of Gunsa Wah, Phaic Tăn's tallest peak, at 2150 metres in height. Despite the fact that Sukkondat receives less than 2% of all visitors to Phaic Tăn every year, this statistic hasn't stopped its local Tourism Bureau from declaring the province 'the place to be'. Pha Phlung Pha Phlung in the country's northeast is mountainous and renowned for its rainforests, waterfalls and mud-slides. Pha Phlung is traditionally known as the 'Land Of A Thousand Tigers' and while actual numbers may be closer to seven (counting five in the Lom Buak Grand Circus), nature walks through Pha Phlung are an excellent way to see nature and wildlife up close. The capital of this wet and humid province is Nham Pong. Buhng Lung According to the book, Buhng Lung is a busy province where all car horns have cruise control, set to go off every ten seconds. The Pong Delta is located in the south-east of the Buhng Lung province. The capital city of Bumpattabumpah is located in the north of the province. Thong On Thong On is an exotic province of which Pattaponga, located on the coast of Kru Kut Bay, is the capital. The coast is composed of many beaches. Of particular note is Zou Kow Bow Beach, which is said to have the whitest sand of any beach in the world. The beach sand's whiteness was formed in the 1980s by the rare combination of global warming and a huge spill from a tanker carrying laundry bleach. =Flag= Flag of Phaic Tăn The Phaic Tănese flag has the design of a ping-pong (table tennis) table.

History and properties HN is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was found by and ). Its Schur multiplier is trivial and its outer automorphism group has order 2. HN has an involution whose centralizer is of the form 2.HS.2, where HS is the Higman-Sims group (which is how Harada found it). The prime 5 plays a special role in the group. For example, it centralizes an element of order 5 in the Monster group (which is how Norton found it), and as a result acts naturally on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 5 elements . This implies that it acts on a 133 dimensional algebra over F5 with a commutative but nonassociative product, analogous to the Griess algebra . Generalized Monstrous Moonshine Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For HN, the relevant McKay- Thompson series is T_{5A}(tau) where one can set the constant term a(0) = -6 (), :begin{align}j_{5A}(tau) &=T_{5A}(tau)-6 &=big(tfrac{eta(tau)}{eta(5tau)}big)^{6}+5^3 big(tfrac{eta(5tau)}{eta(tau)}big)^{6} &=frac{1}{q} - 6 + 134q + 760q^2 +3345q^3+12256q^4+39350q^5+dots end{align} and η(τ) is the Dedekind eta function.

Cir. or C.A.F.C.) is a United States court of appeals headquartered in Washington, D.C. The court was created by Congress with passage of the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, which merged the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims, making the judges of the former courts into circuit judges. §165, . The Federal Circuit is particularly known for its decisions on patent law, as it is the only appellate-level court other than the Supreme Court with the jurisdiction to hear patent case appeals.USCAFC Court Jurisdiction The court occupies the Howard T. Markey National Courts Building as well as the adjacent Benjamin Ogle Tayloe House, former Cosmos Club building, and the Cutts-Madison House in Washington, D.C. on Lafayette Square. The court sits from time to time in locations other than Washington, and its judges can and do sit by designation on the benches of other courts of appeals and federal district courts. , Washington and Lee University School of Law's Millhiser Moot Courtroom had been designated as the continuity of operations site for the court. Jurisdiction The Federal Circuit is unique among the courts of appeals as it is the only court that has its jurisdiction based wholly upon subject matter rather than geographic location. The Federal Circuit is an appellate court with jurisdiction generally given in . The court hears certain appeals from all of the United States District Courts, appeals from certain administrative agencies, and appeals arising under certain statutes. Among other things, the Federal Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals from:History of the Federal Circuit * Article I tribunals: ** United States Court of Federal Claims ** United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims ** United States Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ** United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (formerly known as the United States Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences) ** Boards of contract appeals (for Government contract disputes pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978): *** Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals *** Civilian Board of Contract Appeals *** Postal Service Board of Contract Appeals ** United States Merit Systems Protection Board (federal employment and employment benefits) ** United States International Trade Commission * Article III tribunals: ** United States Court of International Trade ** United States district courts relating to: ***Patents, including appeals arising from an action against the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks under ***The Little Tucker Act, ***Section 211 of the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970; ***Section 5 of the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973; ***Section 523 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975; and ***Section 506(c) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 * Congressional Office of Compliance Howard T. Markey National Courts Building. Although the Federal Circuit typically hears all appeals from any United States District Court where the original action included a complaint arising under the patent laws, the Supreme Court decided in Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc. (2002)Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 535 U.S. 826 (2002). that the Federal Circuit does not have jurisdiction if the patent claims arose solely as counterclaims by the defendant.Holmes Group, Inc. v. Vornado Air Circulation Systems, Inc., 2002. However, Congress changed the law in the America Invents Act of 2011, requiring the Federal Circuit to hear all appeals where the original action included a complaint or compulsory counterclaim arising under the patent laws. Thus, the Supreme Court's 2002 Holmes ruling no longer has the force of law. The decisions of the Federal Circuit, particularly in regard to patent cases, are unique in that they are binding precedent throughout the U.S. within the bounds of the court's subject-matter jurisdiction. This is unlike the other courts of appeals as the authority of their decisions is restricted by geographic location and thus there may be differing judicial standards depending on location. Decisions of the Federal Circuit are only superseded by decisions of the Supreme Court or by applicable changes in the law. Also, review by the Supreme Court is discretionary, so Federal Circuit decisions are often the final word, especially since there are usually no circuit splits given the Federal Circuit's exclusive subject-matter jurisdiction. In its first decision, the Federal Circuit incorporated as binding precedent the decisions of its predecessor courts, the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the appellate division of the United States Court of Claims.South Corp. v. United States, 690 F.2d 1368 (Fed. Cir. 1982) Because the Court is one of national jurisdiction, panels from the court may sit anywhere in the country. Typically, once or twice a year, the court will hold oral arguments in a city outside of its native Washington D.C. The panels may sit in Federal courthouses, state courthouses, or even at law schools. Composition The judges of the Federal Circuit as of 2016 The Federal Circuit may have a total of 12 active circuit judges sitting at any given time, who are required to reside within 50 miles of the District of Columbia, as set by . Judges on senior status are not subject to this restriction. As with other federal judges, they are nominated by the President and must be confirmed by the Senate. Their terms last during the \\"good behavior\\" of the judges, which typically results in life tenure. When eligible, judges may elect to take senior status. This allows a senior judge to continue to serve on the court while handling fewer cases than an active service judge. Each judge in active service employs a judicial assistant and up to four law clerks, while each judge in senior status employs a judicial assistant and one law clerk. Current composition of the court : List of former judges Chief judges Notwithstanding the foregoing, when the court was initially created, Congress had to resolve which chief judge of the predecessor courts would become the first chief judge. It was decided that the chief judge of the predecessor court who had the most seniority, as chief judge, would be the new chief judge. §166, . This made Howard T. Markey, former chief judge of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, the first chief judge. Succession of seats The court has twelve seats for active judges, numbered in alphabetical order by their occupant at the time the court was formed, with the sole vacant seat being numbered last. Judges who retire into senior status remain on the bench but leave their seat vacant. That seat is filled by the next circuit judge appointed by the President.

The Telegraph (London), 24 March 2011. Retrieved 30 March 2011. was a British-born documentary film director and one of the pioneers of direct cinema and cinéma vérité. Early life and career Leacock was born in London on 18 July 1921, the younger brother of film director and producer Philip Leacock. Leacock grew up on his father's banana plantation in the Canary Islands until being sent to boarding schools in England at the age of eight. He took up photography with a glass plate camera, built a darkroom and developed his pictures, but was not satisfied. At age 11 he was shown a silent film Turk-Sib about the building of the Trans-Siberian Railway. He was stunned, and said to himself: \\"All I need is a cine-camera and I can make a film that shows you what it is like to be there.\\" At the age of 14, he wrote, directed, filmed and edited Canary Bananas (10 min. 16mm, silent), a film about growing bananas,Leacock, Richard (2011), The Feeling of Being There – a Filmmaker's Memoir, Meaulne: Semeïon Editions. but it did not, in his opinion, give you \\"the feeling of being there\\". He was educated at Dartington Hall School from 1934 to 1938, alongside Robert Flaherty's daughters; David Lack (Life of the Robin) taught biology at the school. After filming Lack's expedition to the Canary and Galapagos Islands (1938–39), Leacock moved to the US and majored in physics at Harvard to master the technology of filmmaking. Meanwhile, he worked as cameraman and assistant editor on other peoples films, notably To Hear Your Banjo Play (1941)—Leacock filmed a folk music festival atop a mountain in south Virginia where there was no electricity, using a 35mm studio camera and 35mm optical film sound recorder with batteries in a large truck, a rare achievement at that time. He then spent three years as a combat photographer in Burma and China, followed by 14 months as cameraman on Robert Flaherty's Louisiana Story (1946–48). In the meantime, Leacock had married Eleanor \\"Happy\\" Burke in 1941. Daughter of the world-famous literary critic, philosopher, and writer Kenneth Burke, she had studied at Radcliffe College, but graduated from Barnard in New York City. The Leacocks had four children together: Elspeth, Robert, David and Claudia. After ethnographic fieldwork with the Innu (Montagnais-Naskapi) of Labrador, Eleanor Leacock (1922–1987) earned her doctorate in anthropology at Columbia University (1952). Ten years later, after her marriage broke up, she went on to become a pioneering feminist anthropologist.\\"Eleanor Burke Leacock: Biography\\". Kristin Alten, May 1998. Retrieved 4 April 2011. In 1963, he married Marilyn Pedersen West, a painter, writer, and fashion model, who worked for social causes. They had a daughter, Victoria. In 1970 they separated, and remained separated until her death in 1980. Documentaries Many relatively conventional jobs followed, until 1954, when Leacock was asked to make a reportage on a traveling tent theater in Missouri: the first film he had written directed, photographed, and edited himself since Canary Bananas. This film, Toby and the Tall Corn, went on the American cultural TV program, Omnibus, in prime time and brought him into contact with Robert Drew, an editor at LIFE magazine in search of a less verbal approach to television reportage.Leacock, Richard (2011), The Feeling of Being There – a Filmmaker's Memoir, Meaulne: Semeïon Editions. Another new contact, Roger Tilton, wanted to film an evening of people dancing to Dixieland music spontaneously. Leacock filmed Jazz Dance for him, using hand held camera techniques. Leacock's search for high quality, mobile, synchronous equipment to facilitate observation was ongoing. Along with fellow film maker Robert Drew, he developed the method of separating the wire from the microphones and the cameras. Leacock explains the problem with Louisiana Story and pre-synchronized sound filmmakers: > Like all documentary filmmakers, he [Flaherty] had an identity problem in > that period. They couldn't deal with sync sound. It tied them down. Made > them rigid… Except for the drilling sequence, which was shot with sound, it > was essentially a silent film. And it wasn't till 1960, when we were filming > Primary, that we were able to jump into the new world. Frustrated with the obtrusiveness of the process of synching footage and sound, Leacock knew there had to be a way to separate the two. In 1958, the idea became obvious. \\"We had to have a mobile quartz camera, and we had to have a mobile quartz tape recorder, and we couldn't have cables connecting them.\\" Leacock took the same design as in an Accutron watch and put it in the camera. This allowed proper synchronisation. They then took their design to RCA who showed interest; and after receiving money from LIFE magazine, Drew and Leacock were able to make the first model and shoot their film Primary. As Leacock pointed out, “nothing has really changed since then, I mean it is a little bit better… basically the same thing.\\" Brian Winston describes Leacock as the father of modern documentary because of this development. \\"He was the catalyst for the development of the modern documentary, liberating the camera from the tripod and abandoning the tyranny of perfectly stable, perfectly lit shot—as well as the straitjacket of ‘voice of god’ commentary.\\" Winston goes on to note that this new mode of film-making essentially dominated over any other style for “a quarter of a century.\\" When most people think of the word “documentary,” they think of the observational mode that Leacock, Drew, and Pennebaker all played such a huge role in creating. In 1947–1948, Leacock served as cameraman and co-director with John Ferno (Fernhaut) on seven short films in the 'Earth and Its People' series produced by Louis De Rochemont, two in France, and one each in Holland, Switzerland, Italy, Greece, and the Sahara Desert. In the late 1950s, Leacock produced several educational film shorts for the Physical Science Study Committee, a project based at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to improve the teaching of high school physics. A number of films followed made by Drew, DA Pennebaker, Maysles and their associates, but the U.S. networks were not impressed. In France at the Cinémathèque Française, when Drew and Leacock screened Primary (1960) and On the Pole (1960), Henri Langlois introduced the films as \\"perhaps the most important documentaries since the brothers Lumiere\\". After the screening, a monk in robes came up to them and said \\"You have invented a new form. Now you must invent a new grammar!\\" When Drew went to work for ABC-TV, the Leacock- Pennebaker company was formed and produced Happy Mother's Day, Dont Look Back, Monterey Pop (1966), A Stravinsky Portrait and many others ending with the remnants of Jean-Luc Godard's One A.M. – One P.M. (1972). In 1968, he was invited to join Ed Pincus creating a new, small film school at MIT. Because 16mm filming was becoming so expensive, his group developed Super-8 film sync equipment with modified mass-produced cameras that were much cheaper. Many filmmakers emerged from this program, including Ross McElwee (Sherman's March). Leacock taught at MIT until his retirement in 1989. In 1989, he moved to Paris, where he met Valerie Lalonde, and they made Les Oeufs a la Coque de Richard Leacock (84 minutes), the first major film shot with a tiny Video-8 Handycam to be broadcast on prime-time television in France. Leacock and Lalonde continued making films without the pressures of TV producers, notably A Musical Adventure in Siberia,A Musical Adventure in Siberia in collaboration with his daughter Victoria Leacock, conductor Sarah Caldwell, and filmmaker Vincent Blanchet. Leacock died on 23 March 2011 at age the age of 89 in Paris. Before his death, he was raising funds for his multi-format memoir The Feeling of Being There: A Filmmaker's Memoir, a bound paper book and DVB (digital video book), published by Semeïon Editions.Canary Banana Films & Semeïon Editions To Leacock, the process of film-making is a \\"process of discovery.\\" He did not film to preach his own ideas and his own presuppositions; he wanted to discover the world around him. To him, any type of staging makes no sense, and in the end, comes across as fake. \\"Usually, if you wait long enough they end up doing things naturally.\\" Leacock believed that if you wait, people will become comfortable with the camera and start acting like themselves. Cameras, he thought, should be small and unobtrusive, though never hidden. You should shoot in sequence if you can, and without interfering or asking for actions to be repeated. Just like in Crisis and Primary, the action only comes from observation. By simply placing a camera in a room, our eyes can be opened. His main goal was to give viewers the sense of being there.

The Christian Emperor Honorius, however, was impressed by the monk's martyrdom and it spurred him to issue a historic ban on gladiatorial fights. Frederick George Holweck gives the year of his death as 391.Holweck, F. G., A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints (St Louis: B. Herder Book Co., 1924) p. 51 The last known gladiatorial fight in Rome was on 1 January 404 AD. Telemachus at the stadium Background He is described as being an ascetic who came to Rome from the East. The story is found in the writings of Theodoret, Bishop of Cyrrhus, Syria. Although the site of Telemachus' martyrdom is often given as being the Colosseum in Rome, Theodoret does not actually specify where it happened, saying merely that it happened in \\"the stadium\\". Later retellings of the story have differed from Theodoret's in a number of details. Foxe's Book of Martyrs claims that Telemachus was first stabbed to death by a gladiator, but that the sight of his death \\"turned the hearts of the people\\". In the version of the story told by Ronald Reagan in 1984, the entire crowd left in silence. There is also an alternate form of the story, in which Telemachus stood up in the amphitheatre and told the assembly to stop worshipping idols and offering sacrifices to the gods. Upon hearing this statement, the prefect of the city is said by this source to have ordered the gladiators to kill Telemachus, and they promptly did so.Burns, Paul.

Bal-musette is a style of French instrumental music and dance that first became popular in Paris in the 1880s. Although it began with bagpipes as the main instrument, this instrument was replaced with accordion, on which a variety of waltzes, polkas, and other dance styles were played for dances. History Auvergnats settled in large numbers in the 5th, 11th, and 12th districts (arrondissements) of Paris during the 19th century, opening cafés and bars where patrons danced the bourrée to the accompaniment of the cabrette (a bellows-blown bagpipe locally called a \\"musette\\") and often the vielle à roue (hurdy-gurdy). Parisian and immigrant Italian musicians who played the accordion adopted the style and established themselves in Auvergnat bars especially in the 19th arrondissement.Rémi Hess : La valse, un romantisme révolutionnaire, Métailié editor, Sciences humaines collection, April 2003, p. 147-148. ().Henri Joannis Deberne : Danser en société, Christine Bonneton (editor), 3/1999, Paris. (). When Italians began introducing new rhythms like the waltz and polka into the traditional musical form and began playing it on recently introduced hybrid accordion, conflicts arose, and the Italian and Auvergnat styles split. By the end of 19th century, there were three kinds of bals-musette establishments: *bal des familles - Auvergnat *bal musette populaires - Italian *guinche or bal de barrière - seedy hangouts frequented by low-lifes and so-called bohemians. These places often were frequented by members of the French upper-class looking for excitement among the poor and downtrodden. Some establishments even staged mock police raids for their patrons' benefit. Performers of this era include Antoine Bouscatel, Émile Vacher, Martin Cayla, Charles Péguri, and Gus Viseur. Musette dance forms arose from people looking for easier, faster and more sensual dance steps, as well as forms that did not require a large hall. \\"Musette-forms\\" that established themselves as variations to popular dances of the day include: * tango-musette * paso-musette * valse-musette, with a special variation called la toupie (\\"the top\\"), where dancers are very close and turn around themselves very regularly. An original musette dance also appeared, known as java. Admission to most bals was free, but dancers bought dance tokens at the cash- desk. These tokens were made of metal in various shapes with the name of the hall stamped on one side. In the middle of the dance, the bal director walked between the couples with a bag and the dancers turned-in a token. In the 1930s, gypsy jazz, a rhythmic form of swing music, drew on musette styles. By 1945, the bal-musette became the most popular style of dance in France and its biggest stars were widely known across the country. Its popularity declined drastically beginning around 1960. A revival of bals has begun, especially in larger cities, and a modern form of the musette is establishing itself.

The Devi Sukta hymn of Rigveda, a scripture of Hinduism, declares the feminine energy as the essence of the universe, the one who creates all matter and consciousness, the eternal and infinite, the metaphysical and empirical reality (Brahman), the soul, (supreme self) of everything. The woman is celebrated as the most powerful and the empowering force in some Hindu Upanishads, Sastras and Puranas, particularly the Devi Upanishad, Devi Mahatmya and Devi-Bhagavata Purana.C. Mackenzie Brown (1990), The Triumph of the Goddess, State University of New York Press, ISBN , page 77Thomas Coburn (2002), Devī Māhātmya: The Crystallization of the Goddess Tradition, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 138, 303-309 Ancient and medieval era Hindu texts present a diverse picture of duties and rights of women in Hinduism. The texts recognize eight kinds of marriage, ranging from father finding a marriage partner for his daughter and seeking her consent (Brahma marriage), to the bride and groom finding each other without parental participation (Gandharva marriage).Rajbali Pandey (1969), Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, , pages 158-170 and Chapter VIII Scholars state that Vedic- era Hindu texts and records left by travelers to ancient and medieval India suggest that ancient and early medieval Hindu society did not practice Dowry or Sati. These practices likely became widespread sometime in the 2nd millennium CE from socio-political developments in the Indian subcontinent. Throughout history, Hindu society has seen many female rulers, such as Rudramadevi, religious figures and saints, such as Andal, philosophers, such as Maitreyi, and female practitioners/ conductors of Vedic Hindu rituals. Hinduism, states Bryant, has the strongest presence of the divine feminine among major world religions, from ancient times to the present. The goddess is viewed as central in Shakti and Saiva Hindu traditions.David Kinsley (2005), Hindu Goddesses: Vision of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Traditions, University of California Press, , pages 6-17, 55-64Flood, Gavin, ed. (2003), The Blackwell Companion to Hinduism, Blackwell Publishing Ltd., , pages 200-203 Matriarchal theology is quite prevalent in Sanskritic traditions and village Hinduism relating to the worship of Shakti, and there are numerous Hindu communities that are matriarchal.  Ancient texts  =Vedic literature= Ancient texts of Hinduism expound a reverence for the feminine. The 10th chapter of the Rigveda, for example, asserts the feminine to be the supreme principle behind all of cosmos, in the following hymn called as Devi Sukta, ;Upanishads The Devi Sukta ideas of the Rigveda are further developed in the relatively later composed Shakta Upanishads, states McDaniel, where the Devi asserts that she is Brahman, from her arise Prakṛti (matter) and Purusha (consciousness), she is bliss and non-bliss, the Vedas and what is different from it, the born and the unborn, and the feminine is thus all of the universe. She is presented as all the five elements, as well as all that is different from these elements, what is above, what is below, what is around, and thus the universe in its entirety. This philosophy is also found in the Tripuratapani Upanishad and the Bahvricha Upanishad. The early Upanishads are, however, generally silent about women and men, and focus predominantly about gender-less Brahman and its relation to Atman (Soul, Self). There are occasional exceptions. Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, composed about 800 BCE, for example, in the last chapter detailing the education of a student, include lessons for his Grihastha stage of life.Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 534-539 There, the student is taught, that as a husband, he should cook rice for the wife, and they together eat the food in certain way depending on whether they wish for the birth of a daughter or a son, as follows, Women are mentioned and are participants in the philosophical debates of the Upanishads, as well as scholars, teachers and priestesses during the Vedic and early Buddhist age.Ellison Findly (2004), Women, Religion, and Social Change (Editors: Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad, Ellison Banks Findly), State University of New York Press, , pages 37-58 Among women acknowledged in the Upanishads are Gargi and Maitreyi. In Sanskrit, the word acharyā means a \\"female teacher\\" (versus acharya meaning \\"teacher\\") and an acharyini is a teacher's wife, indicating that some women were known as gurus. Female characters appear in plays and epic poems. The 8th century poet, Bhavabhuti describes in his play, Uttararamacharita (verse 2 - 3), how the character, Atreyi, travelled to southern India where she studied the Vedas and Indian philosophy. In Madhava's Shankaradigvijaya, Shankara debates with the female philosopher, Ubhaya Bharati and in verses 9 - 63 it is mentioned that she was well versed in the Vedas. Tirukkoneri Dasyai, a 15th-century scholar, wrote a commentary on Nammalvar's Tiruvaayamoli, with reference to Vedic texts such as the Taittiriya Yajurveda. The epics Dushmanta asks Sakuntala (above) to marry him for love, in Gandharva-style marriage, without the consent of their parents.Adi Parva 1.LXXIII.6 - 1.LXXIII.14, Mahabharata, Translated by Manmatha Nath Dutt, page 105 The texts also describes seven other forms of marriage, and when they were appropriate or inappropriate. In the two Hindu epics, Ramayana and Mahabharata, the role of women is mixed. The main female character in the Mahabharata, Draupadi is married to all the five Pandavas, thus has five husbands. She is insulted by Duryodhana, one of the triggers for the great war. In the Ramayana composed in the second half of 1st millennium BCE, Sita is respected, honored and seen as inseparable beloved but presented as a homemaker, the ideal wife and partner to Rama. In the Hindu tradition, a majority of women's oral retellings of the Ramayana depict autonomy as the rule rather than the exception, but states Sugirtharajah, these versions are of recent origins. The Epics are stories, but carry precepts of dharma embedded them, suggesting perceived notions about women in Hinduism at the time the Epics were composed. The Mahabharata, in Book 1, for example, states, The Anushasana Parva of the Hindu epic Mahabharata has several chapters dedicated to the discussion about duties and right of women. It gives a mixed picture. In chapter 11, the goddess of wealth and prosperity Lakshmi asserts, that she lives in those women who are truthful, sincere, modest, organized, devoted to their husband and children, health conscious, patient and kind to guests.Anushasana Parva The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Chapter XI, pages 41-43 The goddess asserts she does not reside in woman who is sinful, unclean, always disagreeing with her husband, has no patience or fortitude, is lazy, quarrelsome with her neighbors and relatives. In chapter 47, as Yudhishthira seeks guidance on Dharma from Bhishma, the Anushasana Parva compares the value of daughter to a son, as follows, In Udyoga Parva of Mahabharata, states misogynists and bigots are sinners. \\"Assertion of one's own superiority, the avaricious [lolupa], those who are unable to tolerate the slightest insult, the bad tempered, the fickle, those who neglect the protecting of those who seek it. One who thinks only of his own sexual satisfaction, the bigoted, the arrogant, one who gives and then regrets it, one who’s parsimonious, one who admires power/wealth and pleasure, and the misogynist these are the 13 types of sinners. \\" (M.B.Udyoga Parva 43:18,19) The duties of women are again recited in Chapter 146, as a conversation between god Shiva and his wife goddess Uma, where Shiva asks what are the duties of women. Uma (Parvati) proceeds to meet all the rivers, who are all goddesses that nourish and create fertile valleys.Anushasana Parva The Mahabharata, Translated by Kisari Mohan Ganguli, Chapter CXLVI, pages 667-672 Uma suggests that the duties of women include being of a good disposition, endued with sweet speech, sweet conduct, and sweet features. For a woman, claims Uma, her husband is her god, her husband is her friend, and her husband is her high refuge. A woman's duties include physical and emotional nourishment, reverence and fulfillment of her husband and her children. Their happiness is her happiness, she observes the same vows as those that are observed by her husband, her duty is to be cheerful even when her husband or her children are angry, be there for them in adversity or sickness, is regarded as truly righteous in her conduct. Beyond her husband and family, her duty is to be cheerful of heart and humble with friends and relatives, do the best she can for friends and guests. Her family life and her home is her heaven, tells goddess Parvati to Shiva. Anushasana Parva has served as a source for modern era texts on women in Hinduism. For example, Tryambakayajvan of Thanjavur, in the 18th-century CE, published Strīdharmapaddhati (sometimes referred to as Stri Dharma Paddhati, or \\"Guide for a Dharmic Woman\\"). Tryambaka, according to Julia Leslie,Tryambakayajvan (trans. Julia Leslie 1989), The Perfect Wife - Strīdharmapaddhati, Oxford University Press, selectively extracts verses from many chapters of Anushasana Parva. He selectively extracts verses from other books of the Mahabharata as well, and other ancient Indian texts, for Strīdharmapaddhati, choosing those he preferred, omitting verses from the Mahabharata that represent its characteristic style of presenting many voices and counter-arguments.Leslie, J. (1992), The significance of dress for the orthodox Hindu woman, in Dress and Gender: Making and Meaning (Editors: Ruth Barnes, Joanne B. Eicher), pages 198-213; Quote - \\"Strīdharmapaddhati represents a bizarre mixture of reality and utopia.\\" =Shastras and Smritis= Brahmacharini is also revered in Hinduism as a goddess (above). The characterization and treatment of women is mixed in Shastras and Smriti texts of Hinduism. Scholars have questioned the later date insertions, corruption and authenticity of the texts, as dozens of significantly different versions of the Smriti texts have been found. Patrick Olivelle for example, who is credited with a 2005 translation of Manusmriti published by the Oxford University Press, states the concerns in postmodern scholarship about the presumed authenticity and reliability of Manusmriti manuscripts. He writes (abridged), Arthashastra, in chapter 1.21 describes women who had received military education and served to protect the king; the text also mentions female artisans, mendicants, and women who were wandering ascetics.Kautilya (3rd century BCE), Kautiliya Arthasastra Vol 2 (Translator: RP Kangle, 2014), Motilal Banarsidass, , page 51Patrick Olivelle (2013), King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kautilya's Arthasastra, Oxford University Press, , pages 77-79, 96, 254-262, 392-396, 477-479 One of the most studied about the position of women in medieval Hindu society has been a now contested Calcutta manuscript of Manusmriti. The text preaches chastity to widows such as in verses 5.158-5.160.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32, 108-123, 138-147 In verses 2.67-2.69 and 5.148-5.155, Manusmriti preaches that as a girl, she should obey and seek protection of her father, as a young woman her husband, and as a widow her son; and that a woman should always worship her husband as a god.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 98, 146-147 In other verses, Manusmriti respects and safeguards women rights. Manusmriti in verses 3.55-3.56, for example, declares that \\"women must be honored and adorned\\", and \\"where women are revered, there the gods rejoice; but where they are not, no sacred rite bears any fruit\\".Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 111Mācave P. \\"Hinduism, its contribution to science and civilisation.\\" 1979. . \\"Yatra ... Where women are worshipped, there the Gods are delighted. But where they are not worshipped, all religious ceremonies become futile.\\" Mahabharata 13 - 45.5 and Manu Smriti 3 - 56. Elsewhere, in verses 5.147-5.148, states Olivelle, the text declares, \\"a woman must never seek to live independently\\".Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , page 146 Divorce The text declares that a marriage cannot be dissolved by a woman or a man, in verse 8.101-8.102.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , page 84 Yet, the text, in other sections, allows either to dissolve the marriage. For example, verses 9.72-9.81 allow the man or the woman to get out of a fraudulent marriage or an abusive marriage, and remarry; the text also provides legal means for a woman to remarry when her husband has been missing or has abandoned her.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 190-207, 746-809 Arthashastra which is one of the sastras in Hinduism says A woman, hating her husband, can not dissolve her marriage with him against his will. Nor can a man dissolve his marriage with his wife against her will. But from mutual enmity, divorce may be obtained (parasparam dveshánmokshah). If a man, apprehending danger from his wife desires divorce (mokshamichhet), he shall return to her whatever she was given (on the occasion of her marriage). If a woman, under the apprehension of danger from her husband, desires divorce, she shall forfeit her claim to her property; marriages contracted in accordance with the customs of the first four kinds of marriages cannot be dissolved.https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Arthashastra/Book_III. Page 224 https://csboa.com/eBooks/Arthashastra_of_Chanakya_-_English.pdf Varna The text in one section opposes a woman marrying someone outside her own social class (varna) as in verses 3.13-3.14. Simultaneously, states Olivelle, the text presupposes numerous practices such a marriages outside varna, such as between a Brahmin man and a Shudra woman in verses 9.149-9.157, a widow getting pregnant with a child of a man she is not married to in verses 9.57-9.62, marriage where a woman in love elopes with her man, and then grants legal rights in these cases such as property inheritance rights in verses 9.143-9.157, and the legal rights of the children so born.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 31-32, 194-207, 755-809 The text also presumes that a married woman may get pregnant by a man other than her husband, and dedicates verses 8.31-8.56 to conclude that the child's custody belongs to the woman and her legal husband, and not to the man she got pregnant with.Robert Lingat (1973), The Classical Law of India, University of California Press, , pages 83-84Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 182-193, 659-706 Property rights Manusmriti provides a woman with property rights to six types of property in verses 9.192-9.200. These include those she received at her marriage, or as gift when she eloped or when she was taken away, or as token of love before marriage, or as gifts from her biological family, or as received from her husband subsequent to marriage, and also from an inheritance from deceased relatives.Patrick Olivelle (2005), Manu's Code of Law, Oxford University Press, , pages 200-201, 746-809 Inconsistency and authenticity issues Scholars state that less than half, or only 1,214 of the 2,685 verses in Manusmriti, may be authentic. Further, the verses are internally inconsistent.Arun Kumbhare (2009), Women of India: Their Status Since the Vedic Times, , page 56 Verses such as 3.55-3.62 of Manusmriti, for example, glorify the position of women, while verse such as 9.3 and 9.17 do the opposite.J Sinha (2014), Psycho-Social Analysis of the Indian Mindset, Springer Academic, , page 5 Mahatma Gandhi, when asked about his view about the Smriti, stated, that \\"there are so many contradictions in the printed volume that, if you accept one part, you are bound to reject those parts that are wholly inconsistent with it. (...) Nobody is in possession of the original text [of Manusmriti].Mahatma Gandhi, Hinduism According to Gandhi, Orient Paperbacks (2013 Reprint Edition), , page 129 Flavia Agnes states that Manusmriti is a complex commentary from women's rights perspective, and the British colonial era codification of women's rights based on it for Hindus, and from Islamic texts for Muslims, picked and emphasized certain aspects while it ignored other sections.Flavia Agnes (2001), Law and Gender Inequality: The Politics of Women's Rights in India, Oxford University Press, , pages 41-45 This construction of personal law during the colonial era created a legal fiction around Manusmriti's historic role as a scripture in matters relating to women in South Asia.Abdullahi Ahmed An-Na'im (2010), Islam and the Secular State, Harvard University Press, , pages 149, 289 = Puranas = Devi Mahatmya, a Hindu Sanskrit manuscript from Nepal 11th-century (above), helped crystallize the goddess tradition where the creator God is a female, but neither feminine nor masculine, rather spiritual and a force of good.Alf Hiltebeitel and Kathleen Erndl (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses, New York University Press, , pages 133-134 The Puranas, particularly the Devi Mahatmya found in Markandeya Maha- Purana, and the Devi-Bhagavata Purana have some of the most dedicated discussion of Devi and sacred feminine in late ancient and early medieval era of Hinduism. However, the discussion is not limited to these two major Hindu Goddess religion-related texts. Women are found in philosophical discussions across numerous other Puranas and extant era texts. For example, Parvati in a discussion with her husband Shiva, remarks: Feminine symbolism as being sacred and for reverence were present in ancient Hindu texts, but these were fragmentary states Brown, and it was around the sixth century CE, possibly in northwest India, that the concept of Maha-Devi coalesced as the Great Goddess, appearing in the text of Devi Mahatmya of Markandeya Purana. This development of the divine woman was not theoretical, according to Brown, but has impacted \\"self understanding of Hindus to the present day\\" and \\"what it means to be human in a universe that is infinite and yet is pervaded by the very human quality of a woman's care and anger\\". Devi Mahatmya, also called Durga Saptasati (or 700 verses to Durga), has been enormously popular among Hindus through the centuries, states Coburn. Devi Mahatmya does not attempt to prove that the female is supreme, but assumes it as a given and its premise. This idea influenced the role of women in Hinduism in the Puranic texts that followed for centuries, where male-dominated and female-dominated couples appear, in various legends, in the same religious text and Hindu imagination. The Devi Mahatmya presents the idea, states McDaniel, of a divine she who creates this universe, is the supreme knowledge, who helps herself and men reach final liberation, she is multitasking who in times of prosperity is Lakshmi brings wealth and happiness to human homes, yet in times of adversity feeds and fights the battle as the angry woman destroying demons and evil in the universe after metamorphosing into Durga, Chandika, Ambika, Bhadrakali, Ishvari, Bhagvati, Sri or Devi. However, notes Brown, the celebration of the goddess as supreme in Devi Mahatmya is not universal in Hindu texts of 1st millennium CE, and other Puranic texts celebrate the god as supreme, while acknowledging supreme goddess in various chapters and presenting the female as the \\"effective power behind any male\\" either in mythological sense or theological sense or both. The ideas of the 6th-century Devi Mahatmya are adopted in 11th-century text of Devi-Bhagavata Purana, another goddess-classic text of Shakti tradition of Hinduism. However, this text emphasizes devotion and love as the path to her supreme nature as goddess. In the latter text, Devi appears as a warrior goddess destroying demons, a world-mother nurturing the good, as the creator, the sustainer and the destroyer as different aspects of her, the one supreme.  Gender of God  In Hinduism, the impersonal Absolute (Brahman) is genderless. Both male gods (Deva) and female gods (Devi) are found in Hinduism. Some Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), or as either male or female, while cherishing gender henotheism, that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, , pages 74-76, Hinduism Today, Hawaii Bhakti traditions of Hinduism have both gods and goddesses. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine deva of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine devi.The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women Followers of Shaktism, worship the goddess Devi as the embodiment of Shakti (feminine strength or power). There is a popular perception that there exist millions of Hindu deities.David Lawrence (2012), The Routledge Companion to Theism (Editors: Charles Taliaferro, Victoria S. Harrison, and Stewart Goetz), Routledge, , pages 78-79 However, most, by far, are goddesses (Shakti, Devi, or mother), state Foulston and Abbott, suggesting \\"how important and popular goddesses are\\" in Hindu culture. Though in general, they are smaller, there are far more goddess temples than those of gods. Goddesses are most of the time, if not always seen as powerful, and when unmarried, seen as dangerous. Despite the patriarchal nature of Hindu society, women are seen as powerful alongside the Gods, and at certain times, dangerous. No one has a list of the millions of goddesses and gods, but all deities, state scholars, are typically viewed in Hinduism as \\"emanations or manifestation of gender-less principle called Brahman, representing the many facets of Ultimate Reality\\". In Hinduism, \\"God, the universe, all beings [male, female] and all else is essentially one thing\\" and everything is connected oneness, the same god is in every being as Atman, the eternal Self.Jeffrey Brodd (2003), World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, Saint Mary's Press, , page 43Christopher John Fuller (2004), The Camphor Flame: Popular Hinduism and Society in India, Princeton University Press, , pages 30-31, Quote: \\"Crucial in Hindu polytheism is the relationship between the deities and humanity. Unlike Jewish, Christian and Islamic monotheism, predicated on the otherness of God and either his total separation from man and his singular incarnation, Hinduism postulates no absolute distinction between deities and human beings. The idea that all deities are truly one is, moreover, easily extended to proclaim that all human beings are in reality also forms of one supreme deity - Brahman, the Absolute of philosophical Hinduism. In practice, this abstract monist doctrine rarely belongs to an ordinary Hindu's statements, but examples of permeability between the divine and human can be easily found in popular Hinduism in many unremarkable contexts\\". Ancient and medieval Hindu literature, state scholars, is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God.RM Gross (1978), Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess, Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 46, No. 3 (September 1978), pages 269-291 This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with \\"He\\" and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms. In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross, are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in the cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action. Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press,  Dignity  Hinduism does not regard Women as lacking dignity, therefore there are not many specific quotes about affirming women's dignity. However, there are many references in the primary and secondary Hindu texts that affirm the dignity of women. Many stories from the Upanishads of female scholars, such as Jābālā’s tale, Maitreyi, Gārgī, Lopāmudrā, and Haimavatī Umā, demonstrate the dignity accorded to Women. According to verse 6.4.17 from the Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the birth of a female child who would be scholar is desired. The quote prescribes the specific rituals for obtaining a learned daughter. > Verse 6.4.17 Brihadaranyaka Upanishad: > अथ य इच्छेद्दुहिता मे पण्डिता जायेत, सर्वमायुरियादिति, तिलौदनं पाचयित्वा > सर्पिष्मन्तमश्नीयाताम्; ईश्वरौ जनयितवै ॥ १७ ॥ > atha ya icchedduhitā me paṇḍitā jāyeta, sarvamāyuriyāditi, tilaudanaṃ > pācayitvā sarpiṣmantamaśnīyātām; īśvarau janayitavai  17  > \\"One who wishes that a daughter should be born who would be a scholar and > attain a full term of life, should have rice cooked with sesamum, and both > should eat it with clarified butter. Then the creators (would-be parents) > would indeed be able to produce such a daughter.\\"Wisdom Library: The > Bṛhadāraṇyaka Upaniṣad (with the Commentary of > Śaṅkarācārya)https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/book/the-brihadaranyaka- > upanishad/d/doc122237.html Will Durant (1885-1981) American historian says in his book Story of Civilization: > \\"Women enjoyed far greater freedom in the Vedic period than in later India. > She had more to say in the choice of her mate than the forms of marriage > might suggest. She appeared freely at feasts and dances, and joined with men > in religious sacrifice. She could study, and like Gargi, engage in > philosophical disputation. If she was left a widow there were no > restrictions upon her remarriage.\\"  Practices  =Marriage= The Asvalayana Grhyasutra text of Hinduism identifies eight forms of marriages. Of these first four – Brahma, Daiva, Arsha and Prajapatya – are declared appropriate and recommended by the text, next two – Gandharva and Asura – are declared inappropriate but acceptable, and the last two – Rakshasa and Paishacha – are declared evil and unacceptable (but any children resulting were granted legal rights).The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, James G. Lochtefeld (2001), , Page 427Hindu Saṁskāras: Socio-religious Study of the Hindu Sacraments, Rajbali Pandey (1969), see Chapter VIII, , pages 158-170 #Brahma marriage - considered the religiously most appropriate marriage, where the father finds an educated man, proposes the marriage of his daughter to him. The groom, bride, and families willingly concur with the proposal. The two families and relatives meet, the girl is ceremoniously decorated, the father gifts away his daughter in betrothal, and a Vedic marriage ceremony is conducted. This type of wedding is now most prevalent among Hindus in modern India. #Daiva marriage - in this type of marriage, the father gives away his daughter along with ornaments to a priest. #Arsha marriage - in this type of marriage, the groom gives a cow and a bull to the father of the bride and the father exchanges his daughter in marriage. The groom took a vow to fulfill his obligations to the bride and family life (Grihasthashram). #Prajapatya marriage - in this type of marriage, a couple agree to get married by exchanging some Sanskrit mantras (vows to each other). This form of marriage was akin to a civil ceremony. # Gandharva marriage - in this type of marriage, the couple simply lives together out of love, by mutual consent, consensually consummating their relationship. This marriage is entered into without religious ceremonies, and was akin to the Western concept of Common-law marriage. Kama Sutra, as well as Rishi Kanva - the foster-father of Shakuntala - in the Mahabharata, claimed this kind of marriage to be an ideal one. # Asura marriage - in this type of marriage, the groom offered a dowry to the father of the bride and the bride, both accepted the dowry out of free will, and he received the bride in exchange. This was akin to marrying off a daughter for money. This marriage was considered inappropriate by Hindu Smriti-writers because greed, not what is best for the girl, can corrupt the selection process. Manusmriti verses 3.51 and 3.52, for example, states that a father or relatives must never accept any brideprice because that amounts to trafficking of the daughter.Patrick Olivelle (2004), The Law Code of Manu, Oxford University Press, , page 47 # Rakshasa marriage - where the groom forcibly abducted the girl against her and her family's will. The word Rakshasa means 'devil'. # Paishacha marriage - where the man forces himself on a woman when she is insentient, that is drugged or drunken or unconscious. James Lochtefeld finds that the last two forms of marriage were forbidden yet recognized in ancient Hindu societies, not to encourage these acts, but to provide the woman and any children with legal protection in the society. = Dowry = The concept and practice of dowry in ancient and medieval Hindu society is unclear. Some scholars believe dowry was practiced in historic Hindu society, but some do not. Historical eyewitness reports (discussed below), suggest dowry in pre-11th century CE Hindu society was insignificant, and daughters had inheritance rights, which by custom were exercised at the time of her marriage. Stanley J. Tambiah states the ancient Code of Manu sanctioned dowry and bridewealth in ancient India, but dowry was the more prestigious form and associated with the Brahmanic (priestly) caste. Bridewealth was restricted to the lower castes, who were not allowed to give dowry. He cites two studies from the early 20th century with data to suggest that this pattern of dowry in upper castes and bridewealth in lower castes has persisted through the first half of the 20th century. Michael Witzel, in contrast, states the ancient Indian literature suggests dowry practices were not significant during the Vedic period. Witzel also notes that women in ancient India had property inheritance rights either by appointment or when they had no brothers. Kane states ancient literature suggests bridewealth was paid only in the asura-type of marriage that was considered reprehensible and forbidden by Manu and other ancient Indian scribes. Lochtefeld suggests that religious duties listed by Manu and others, such as 'the bride be richly adorned to celebrate marriage' were ceremonial dress and jewelry along with gifts that were her property, not property demanded by or meant for the groom; Lochtefeld further notes that bridal adornment is not currently considered as dowry in most people's mind.James G. Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: A-M, Rosen Publishing, ; 203 ページ出版 Historical and epigraphical evidence from ancient India suggests dowry was not the standard practice in ancient Hindu society. Arrian of Alexander the Great's conquest era, in his first book, mentions a lack of dowry, or infrequent enough to be noticed by Arrian.CV Vaidya, Epic India, Or, India as Described in the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, Arrian's second book similarly notes, About 1200 years after Arrian's visit, Al-Biruni a Persian scholar who went and lived in India for 16 years in 11th century CE, wrote, = Widowhood and remarriage = Widows were traditionally expected to pursue a spiritual, ascetic life, particularly the higher castes such as Brahmins.Bowker J. H and Holm J. \\"Women in religion.\\" Continuum, London 1994 p79 . There were restrictions on remarriage as well.Fuller C. J. \\"The camphor flame: popular Hinduism and society in India.\\" Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey 2004 p.23 Such restrictions are now strictly observed only by a small minority of widows, yet the belief continues that \\"a good wife predeceases her husband\\". During the debate before the passage of the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856, some communities asserted that it was their ancient custom that prohibited widow remarriage. Hindu scholars and colonial British authorities rejected this argument, states Lucy Carroll, because the alleged custom prohibiting widow remarriage was \\"far from ancient\\", and was already in practice among the Hindu communities such as the Rajbansi whose members had petitioned for the prohibition of widow remarriage. Thus, it failed the \\"customary law\\" protections under the British colonial era laws.Lucy Carroll (2008), Women and Social Reform in Modern India: A Reader, Indiana University Press, , pages 92-93 However, this issue lingered in colonial courts for decades, because of the related issue of property left by the deceased husband, and whether the widow keeps or forfeits all rights to deceased Hindu husband's estate and thereby transfers the property from the deceased husband to her new husband. While Hindu community did not object to widow remarriage, it contested the property rights and transfer of property from her earlier husband's family to the later husband's family, particularly after the death of the remarried widow, in the 20th- century.Lucy Carroll (2008), Women and Social Reform in Modern India: A Reader, Indiana University Press, , pages 93-96 = Sati = Sati where a Hindu woman committed suicide by burning herself with the corpse of her husband. Sati is an obsolete Indian funeral custom where a widow immolated herself on her husband's pyre, or committed suicide in another fashion shortly after her husband's death.Wendy Doniger (2013), Suttee, Encyclopedia BritannicaArvind Sharma (2001), Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 19-21On attested Rajput practice of sati during wars, see, for example Michael Witzel states there is no evidence of Sati practice in ancient Indian literature during the Vedic period. David Brick, in his 2010 review of ancient Indian literature, states The earliest scholarly discussion of Sati, whether it is right or wrong, is found in the Sanskrit literature dated to 10th- to 12th-century. The earliest known commentary on Sati by Medhātithi of Kashmir argues that Sati is a form of suicide, which is prohibited by the Vedic tradition. Vijñāneśvara, of the 12th-century Chalukya court, and the 13th-century Madhvacharya, argue that sati should not to be considered suicide, which was otherwise variously banned or discouraged in the scriptures. They offer a combination of reasons, both in favor and against sati. However, according to the textbook, \\"Religions in the Modern World\\", after the death of Roop Kanwar on her husband's funeral pyre in 1987, thousands saw this as cruel murder. Committing sati was then made a crime, with consequences worse than murder. Another historical practice observed among women in Hinduism, was the Rajput practice of Jauhar, particularly in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, where they collectively committed suicide during war. They preferred death rather than being captured alive and dishonored by victorious Muslim soldiers in a war.Arvind Sharma (1988), Sati: Historical and Phenomenological Essays, Motilal Banarsidass Publ, , page xi, 86 According to Bose, jauhar practice grew in the 14th and 15th century with Hindu-Muslim wars of northwest India, where the Hindu women preferred death than slavery or rape they faced if captured.Mandakranta Bose (2014), Faces of the Feminine in Ancient, Medieval, and Modern India, Oxford University Press, , page 26Malise Ruthven (2007), Fundamentalism: A Very Short Introduction, Oxford University Press, , page 63 Sati-style jauhar custom among Hindu women was observed only during Hindu-Muslim wars in medieval India, but not during internecine Hindu- Hindu wars among the Rajputs.Kaushik Roy (2012), Hinduism and the Ethics of Warfare in South Asia: From Antiquity to the Present, Cambridge University Press, , pages 182-184 The Sati practice is considered to have originated within the warrior aristocracy in the Hindu society, gradually gaining in popularity from the 10th century AD and spreading to other groups from the 12th through 18th century AD.John Stratton Hawley (1994), Sati, the Blessing and the Curse, Oxford University Press, , pages 51-53 The earliest Islamic invasions of South Asia have been recorded from early 8th century CE, such as the raids of Muhammad bin Qasim, and major wars of Islamic expansion after the 10th century.Andre Wink (1996), Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam: 7th-11th Centuries, Brill Academic Publishers, This chronology has led to the theory that the increase in sati practice in India may be related to the centuries of Islamic invasion and its expansion in South Asia. Daniel Grey states that the understanding of origins and spread of sati were distorted in the colonial era because of a concerted effort to push \\"problem Hindu\\" theories in the 19th and early 20th centuries. = Education = The Vedas and Upanishads mention girls could be a Brahmacharini, that is getting an education. Atharva Veda, for example, statesS Jain (2003), The Right to Family Planning, in Sacred Rights: The Case for Contraception and Abortion in World Religions (Editor: Daniel C. Maguire), Oxford University Press, , page 134, Quote - \\"The Atharva Veda confirms... a brahmacharini has better prospects of marriage than a girl who is uneducated\\"; \\"The Vedic period.... girls, like boys, are also expected to go through the brahmacharya...\\" The Harita Dharmasutra, a later era Hindu text states there are two kind of women: sadhyavadhu who marry without going to school, and the brahmavadini who go to school first to study the Vedas and speak of Brahman. The Hindu Sastras and Smritis describe varying number of Sanskara (rite of passage). Upanayana rite of passage symbolized the start of education process. Like the Vedas, the ancient Sutras and Shastra Sanskrit texts extended education right to women, and the girls who underwent this rite of passage then pursued studies were called Brahmavadini.Ram Chandra Prasad (1997), The Upanayana: The Hindu Ceremonies of the Sacred Thread, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 119-131 Those who didn't, performed Upanayana ceremony at the time of their wedding. Instead of sacred thread, girls would wear their robe (now called sari or saree) in the manner of the sacred thread, that is over her left shoulder during this rite of passage.Grihya sutra of Gobhila Verse 2.1.19, Herman Oldenberg & Max Muller (Translator), The Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 30, Part 2, Oxford University Press, page 44 =Dress= Sari in different styles (shown) has been traced to ancient Hindu traditions. In modern times, Sari is also found among non-Hindu women of South Asia. Information on ancient and medieval era dressing traditions of women in Hinduism is unclear. Textiles are commonly mentioned in ancient Indian texts.L Gopal, Textiles in Ancient India, Journal of the Economic and Social History of the Orient, Vol. 4, No. 1, BRILL, pages 53-69 The Arthashastra (~200 BCE to 300 CE) mentions a range of clothing and plant-based, muslin-based, wool-based textiles that are partially or fully dyed, knitted and woven.Patrick Olivelle (2013), King, Governance, and Law in Ancient India: Kautilya's Arthashastra, Oxford University Press, , pages 125-126, 533-534 It is, however, uncertain how women wore these clothing, and scholars have attempted to discern the dress from study of murti (statues), wall reliefs, and ancient literature.Kax Wilson (1979), History of Textiles, Westview, , pages 164-165 In ancient and medieval Hindu traditions, covering the head or face was neither mandated nor common, but Ushnisha – a regional ceremonial occasion headdress is mentioned, as is Dupatta in colder, drier northern parts of Indian subcontinent.GS Ghurye (1967), Indian Costume, 2nd Edition, Luzac, , pages 65-68, 76 Regardless of economic status, the costume of ancient Hindu women was formed of two separate sheets of cloth, one wrapping the lower part of the body, below the waist, and another larger wrap around piece called Dhoti (modern-day Saree) in texts. Some Murti and relief carvings suggest that pleats were used, probably to ease movement, but the pleats were tucked to reveal the contour of the body. However, where the pleats were tucked, front or side or back varied regionally.GS Ghurye (1967), Indian Costume, 2nd Edition, Luzac, , pages 76-77 The predominant style observed in the ancient texts and artwork is the wrapping of the excess of the Dhoti from right waist over the left shoulder, in the Vedic Upanayana style.PV Kane, History of Dharmasastra Volume 2.1, 1st Edition, pages 290-295 The breasts were covered with a stitched, tight fitting bodice named Kurpasaka (Sanskrit: कूर्पासक)कूर्पासक Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012) or Stanamsuka (Sanskrit: स्तनांशुक),स्तनांशुक Sanskrit-English Dictionary, Koeln University, Germany (2012) but this was not common in extreme south India or in eastern states such as Orissa and Bengal.GS Ghurye (1967), Indian Costume, 2nd Edition, Luzac, , pages 15, 76-79 Regional variations were great, to suit local weather and traditions, in terms of the length, number of pleats, placement of pleats, style of bodice used for bosom, and the dimension or wrapping of the upper excess length of the Dhoti. Greek records left by those who came to India with Alexander the Great mention that head and neck ornaments, ear rings, wrist and ankle ornaments were commonly worn by women.GS Ghurye (1967), Indian Costume, 2nd Edition, Luzac, , pages 16-22, 68, 73-74 A Hindu woman, with Sindur in her hair and Bindi on forehead, customs also found among women in Jainism.KS Singh (2004), People of India: Maharashtra, , pages 565-567 Usually, the sari consists of a piece of cloth around 6 yards long, wrapped distinctly based on the prior mentioned factors. The choice of the quality and sophistication of the cloth is dependent on the income and affordability. Women across economic groups in colonial era, for example, wore a single piece of cloth in hot and humid Bengal. It was called Kapod by poorer women, while the more ornate version of the same was called a Saree. The material and cost varied, but nature was the same across income and social groups (caste/class) of Hindu women.SM Channa (2013), Gender in South Asia: Social Imagination and Constructed Realities, Cambridge University Press, , pages 57-58 Sindoor or Kumkum has been a marker for women in Hinduism, since early times.A Eraly (2011), The First Spring: The Golden Age of India, Penguin, , pages 433-434 A married Hindu woman typically wears a red pigment (vermilion) in the parting of her hair, while a never married, divorced or a widowed woman does not.June McDaniel (2002), Making Virtuous Daughters and Wives, State University of New York Press, , page 117 note 52 A Hindu woman may wear a Bindi (also called Tip, Bindiya, Tilaka or Bottu) on her forehead. This represents the place of the inner eye, and signifies that she is spiritually turned inwards. In the past, this was worn by married women, but in the modern era, it is a fashion accessory and has no relation to the marital status for women in Hinduism.James B. Robinson (2004), Hinduism, Chelsea, , page 86 Cultural customs such as Sindoor are similar to wedding ring in other cultures. Regionally, Hindu women may wear seasonal fresh flowers in their hair, during festivals, temple visits or other formal occasions. White color saree is common with aging widows, while red or other festive colors with embroidery is more common on festivals or social ceremonies such as weddings.Susan Bean (2002), South Asian Folklore: An Encyclopedia (Editors: Peter Claus et al), Routledge, , page 170 These Hindu practices are cultural practices, and not required by its religious texts. Hinduism is a way of life, is diverse, has no binding book of rules of its faith, nor any that mandate any dress rules on Hindu women. The choice is left to the individual discretion.Tom Axworthy (2008), Bridging the divide: Religious dialogue and Universal ethics, Queen's University Press, , pages 153-154 Other ornaments worn by Hindu women are sometimes known as solah singar (sixteen decorations): \\"bindi, necklaces, earrings, flowers in the hair, rings, bangles, armlets (for the upper arm), waistbands, ankle-bells, kohl (or kajal – mascara), toe rings, henna, perfume, sandalwood paste, the upper garment, and the lower garment\\". Bernard Cohn (2001) states that clothing in India, during the colonial British era, was a form of authority exercised to highlight hierarchical patterns, subordination, and authoritative relations. Hindus in India were subject to rule under a range of other religious reigns, therefore influencing clothing choices. This was exemplified by a change in attire as a result of Mughal influence and later European influence resulting from British rule. =Arts: dance, drama, music= Hindu religious art encompasses performance arts as well as visual art, and women have been expressed in Hindu arts as prominently as men. Sanskrit literature has contributed to religious and spiritual expression of women, by its reverence for goddesses. The deity for arts, music, poetry, speech, culture, and learning is goddess Saraswati in the Hindu tradition.Mandakranta Bose (2011), Women in the Hindu Tradition: Rules, Roles and Exceptions, Routledge, , page 26 Baumer states that the resulting Sanskrit Theater has its origins in the Vedas, stemming from three principles: “The cosmic man (purusha), the self (atman), and the universal being (brahman)\\". Some of the earliest references to women being active in dance, music and artistic performance in Hindu texts is found in 1st millennium BCE Taittiriya Samhita chapter 6.1 and 8th-century BCE Shatapatha Brahmana chapter 3.2.4.Mandakranta Bose (2011), Women in the Hindu Tradition: Rules, Roles and Exceptions, Routledge, , pages 64-65 In religious ceremonies, such as the ancient Shrauta and Grihya sutras rituals, texts by Panini, Patanjali, Gobhila and others state that women sang hymns or uttered mantras along with men during the yajnas. A Hindu woman in a dance pose Bali Indonesia Music and dance, states Tracy Pintchman, are \\"intertwined in Hindu traditions\\", and women in Hinduism have had an active creative and performance role in this tradition.Tracy Pintchman (2007), Women's Lives, Women's Rituals in the Hindu Tradition, Oxford University Press, , pages 180-182 While aspects of the Hindu traditions curtailed the freedoms of women, they also gave opportunities to create and express arts. The historical evidence, states Pintchman, suggests that the opportunities to create and participate in arts were available to women regardless of their caste or class. Classical vocal music was more prevalent among women upper classes, while public performances of arts such as dance were more prevalent among women in matrilineal Hindu traditions, particularly the Devadasi.Tracy Pintchman (2007), Women's Lives, Women's Rituals in the Hindu Tradition, Oxford University Press, , pages 181-185 The Devadasi tradition women practiced their arts in a religious context. Young Devadasi women were trained in the arts of music, theater, and dance, and their lives revolved around Hindu temples. In south India, some of these women were courtesans, while others chaste. In 1909, the colonial government passed the first law banning the Devadasis practice in the state of Mysore; however, an attempt to ban Devadasis tradition in Tamil Nadu Hindu temples failed in Madras Presidency in 1927.DE Smith (1963), India as a Secular State, Princeton University Press, , pages 238-240 In 1947, the government of Madras passed legislation forbidding Devadasi practices under pressure from activists that this was a 'prostitution' tradition. However, the tradition was revived by those who consider it to be a 'nun' tradition wherein a Devadasi was a chaste woman who considered herself married to God and used temple dance tradition to raise funds as well as helped continue the arts. In poetry, 9th-century Andal became a well known Bhakti movement poetess, states Pintchman, and historical records suggest that by 12th-century she was a major inspiration to Hindu women in south India and elsewhere. Andal continues to inspire hundreds of classical dancers in modern times choreographing and dancing Andal's songs.Tracy Pintchman (2007), Women's Lives, Women's Rituals in the Hindu Tradition, Oxford University Press, , pages 185-187 Andal is also called Goda, and her contributions to the arts have created Goda Mandali (circle of Andal) in the Vaishnava tradition. Many other women, such as Nagaatnammal, Balasaraswati, and Rukmini, states Pintchman, were instrumental in bringing \\"Carnatic music and Bharat Natyam to the public stage and making the performing arts accessible by the general public\\" by the 12th-century. Gathasaptasati is an anthology of Subhashita genre of poetry, from the first half of 1st millennium CE, many of which are attributed to Hindu women in central and western India.MA Selby (2001), Grow Long, Blessed Night: Love Poems from Classical India, Oxford University Press, , pages 81-91, 169-170, 172-230 =Menstruation= In Hinduism, menstruating women are traditionally advised rules to follow. During menstruation, women are advised not to “enter temple, work in kitchen, wear flowers, have sex, touch other males or females, or come in contact with any creative energies to ensure free flow of Apana.” Menstruation is seen as a period of purification, and women are often separated from place of worship or any object pertaining to it, for the length of their period. This forms the basis of most of the cultural practices and restrictions around menstruation in Hinduism. =Sutak= Sūtak are Hindu rules of ritual impurity to be followed after the birth of a child (vṛddhi sūtak).https://www.douban.com/group/topic/2081128/ Sūtak involves the practice of keeping socially isolated from relatives and community by abstention of mealtaking with family, engaging in customary religious activities, and leaving the home.https://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/sutak A mother must practice sūtak for 10 to 30 days, depending upon her caste, while the father may become purified immediately after the birth of his child by ritual purification (ritualistic bathing).Textbook of the 'University of Spirituality', Volume 61, Death and Post-Death Rites, by Parātpar Guru (Dr) Athavale and H.H. (Mrs.) Anjali http://sanatanshop.com/shop/en/booklets/383-death-and-post-death-rites.html Context: historical and modern developments The role of women in Hinduism dates back to 3000 years of history, states Pechelis, incorporating ideas of Hindu philosophy, that is Prakrti (matter, femaleness) and Purusha (consciousness, maleness), coming together to interact and produce the current state of the universe. Hinduism considers the connection, interdependence, and complementary nature of these two concepts – Prakriti and Purusha, female and male – as the basis of all existence, which is a starting point of the position of women in Hindu traditions. Although these ancient texts are the foundation upon which the position of women in Hinduism is founded, Hindu women participated in and were affected by cultural traditions and celebrations such as festivals, dance, arts, music and other aspects of daily life. Despite these liberating undercurrents emerging in its historical context, Sugirtharajah states that there is some reluctance to use the term \\"feminism\\" to describe historical developments in Hinduism. In the colonial era 1800s, Hindu women were described by European scholars as being \\"naturally chaste\\" and \\"more virtuous\\" than other women.Jean A. and Dubois A. Beauchamp H. K. (trans.) Hindu manners, customs, and ceremonies.] Clarendon Press, Oxford 1897. In 20th-century history context, the position of women in Hinduism and more generally India, has many contradictions. Regional Hindu traditions are organized as matriarchal societies (such as in south India and northeast India), where the woman is the head of the household and inherits the wealth; yet, other Hindu traditions are patriarchal. God as a woman, and mother goddess ideas are revered in Hinduism, yet there are rituals that treats the female in a subordinate role. The women’s rights movement in India, states Sharma, have been driven by two foundational Hindu concepts – lokasangraha and satyagraha. Lokasangraha is defined as “acting for the welfare of the world” and satyagraha “insisting on the truth”. These ideals were used to justify and spur movements among women for women's rights and social change through a political and legal process. Fane remarks, in her article published in 1975, that it is the underlying Hindu beliefs of \\"women are honored, considered most capable of responsibility, strong\\" that made Indira Gandhi culturally acceptable as the prime minister of India, yet the country has in the recent centuries witnessed the development of diverse ideologies, both Hindu and non-Hindu, that has impacted the position of women in India. The women rights movement efforts, states Young, have been impeded by the \\"growing intensity of Muslim separatist politics\\", the divergent positions of Indian Hindu women seeking separation of religion and women's rights, secular universal laws (uniform civil code) applicable irrespective of religion, while Indian Muslim community seeking to preserve Sharia law in personal, family and other domains. =Western scholarship= There has been a pervasive and deeply held belief in modern era Western scholarship, states Kathleen Erndl, that \\"in Hinduism, women are universally subjugated and that feminism, however, it might be defined, is an artifact of the West\\".Kathleen Erndl (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 91-92, 95Arti Dhand (2009), Woman as Fire, Woman as Sage, State University of New York Press, , pages 3-7 Postmodern scholars question whether they have \\"unwittingly accepted\\" this colonial stereotype and long-standing assumption,Arti Dhand (2009), Woman as Fire, Woman as Sage, State University of New York Press, , pages 4-5; Quote: \\"The unfortunate result of such scholarship was the creation of a monumental stereotype of the Hindu woman from which a critical reader could derive little substantive knowledge of the particular values undergirding Hindu women's lives in different eras and locales, or the historical, social, political, and legal strictures under which they labors at different periods of history. (...) These works however still condition the questions that scholars raise of Hinduism, and the categories by which women's experience is analyzed and assessed. Perhaps the biggest problem with many works on women in Hinduism is that they presuppose a general category of womanhood, thus creating an essence where none exists\\". particularly given the emerging understanding of Hindu Shakti tradition- related texts, and empirical studies of women in rural India who have had no exposure to Western thought or education but assert their Hindu (or Buddhist) goddess-inspired feminism.Rita Gross (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 108-111 Western feminism, states Vasudha Narayanan, has focussed on negotiating \\"issues of submission and power as it seeks to level the terrains of opportunity\\" and uses a language of \\"rights\\". In Hinduism, the contextual and cultural word has been Dharma, which is about \\"duties\\" to oneself, to others, among other things.Vasudha Narayanan (1999), Feminism and World Religions (Editors: Arvind Sharma, Katherine K. Young), State University of New York Press, , pages 25-26 There has been a gap between Western books describing Hinduism and women's struggle within the Hindu tradition based on texts that the colonial British era gave notoriety to, versus the reality of Hindu traditions and customs that did not follow these texts at all.Vasudha Narayanan (1999), Feminism and World Religions (Editors: Arvind Sharma, Katherine K. Young), State University of New York Press, , pages 34-35 Narayanan describes it as follows (abridged), Ancient and medieval era Hindu texts, and epics, discuss a woman's position and role in society over a spectrum, such as one who is a self-sufficient, marriage- eschewing powerful Goddess, to one who is subordinate and whose identity is defined by men rather than her, and to one who sees herself as a human being and spiritual person while being neither feminine nor masculine.Rita Gross (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 104-111Cynthia Humes (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , pages 132-134, for context see 129-138 The 6th-century Devi Mahatmya text, for example, states Cynthia Humes, actually shares \\"the postmodern exaltation of embodiedness, divinizing it as does much of the Western feminist spirituality movement\\".Cynthia Humes (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 132 These texts are not theoretical nor disconnected from the lives of women in the historic Hindu society, but the verses assert that all \\"women are portions of the divine goddess\\", states Humes.Cynthia Humes (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , pages 137-139 The Hindu goddess tradition inspired by these texts has been, notes Pintchman, one of the richest, compelling traditions worldwide, and its followers flock villages, towns, and cities all over India.Tracy Pintchman (2001), Seeking Mahadevi: Constructing the Identities of the Hindu Great Goddess, State University of New York Press, , pages 1-3 Yet, adds Humes, other texts describe her creative potential not in her terms, but using the words of male virility and gendered dichotomy, possibly encouraging the heroic woman to abandon her female persona and impersonate the male. Postmodern empirical scholarship about Hindu society, states Rita Gross, makes one question whether and to what extent there is pervasiveness of patriarchy in Hinduism. Patriarchal control is real, and the Hindu society admits this of itself, states Gross, yet the Hindu culture distinguishes between authority – which men hold, and power – which both men and women hold.Rita Gross (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 108-110 Women in the Hindu tradition have the power, and they exercise that power to take control of situations that are important to them. The Goddess theology and humanity in the Hindu texts are a foundation of these values, a form that isn't feminist by Western definition, but is feminist nevertheless, one with an empowering and self-liberating value structure with an added spiritual dimension that resonates with Hindu (and Buddhist) goddesses.Rachel McDermott (1998), Devi: Goddesses of India (Editors: John Stratton Hawley, Donna Marie Wulff), Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 296-305 Kathleen Erndl states that texts such as Manusmriti do not necessarily portray what women in Hinduism were or are, but it represents an ideology, and that \\"the task of Hindu feminists is to rescue Shakti from its patriarchal prison\\". Her metaphor, explains Erndl, does not mean that Shakti never was free nor that she is tightly locked up now, because patriarchy is neither monolithic nor ossified in Hindu culture.Kathleen Erndl (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M. Erndl), New York University Press, , page 96 The Shakti concept and associated extensive philosophy in Hindu texts provide a foundation to both spiritual and social liberation.Kathleen Erndl (2000), Is the Goddess a Feminist?: The Politics of South Asian Goddesses (Editors: Alf Hiltebeitel, Kathleen M.

She was the subject of more than ninety solo exhibitions. Early life Margaret Olley was born in Lismore, New South Wales. She was the eldest of three children of Joseph Olley and Grace (née Temperley). The Olley family moved to Tully in far north Queensland in 1925, with Margaret boarding at St Anne's in Townsville in 1929, before returning to New South Wales in 1931. The family temporarily moved to Brisbane in 1935 with Margaret staying to attend Somerville House in Brisbane during her high school years. She was so focused on art that she dropped one French class in order to take another art lesson with teacher and artist Caroline Barker. In 1941, Margaret commenced classes at Brisbane Central Technical College and then moved to Sydney in 1943 to enrol in an Art Diploma course at East Sydney Technical College where she graduated with A-class honours in 1945. Career Her work concentrated on still life. In 1997 a major retrospective of her work was organised by the Art Gallery of New South Wales. She received the inaugural Mosman Art Prize in 1947.  Newcastle  In November 1965 Olley moved to Newcastle. Whilst living here she painted 23 paintings of the city and waterfront in a series known as the 'Newcastle Watercolours'. Olley began a 'love affair' with the city and bought several properties in Newcastle and at East Maitland. This established a long association with the city and a major influence on her work. Philanthropy On 13 July 2006 she donated more works to the Art Gallery of New South Wales; her donations included more than 130 works worth $7 million.Kruger, P. 13 July 2006.

She was also the subject of paintings by many of her artist friends, including Russell DrysdaleArtist Margaret Olley dead , The Sydney Morning Herald, 26 July 2011 and Danelle Bergstrom (that portrait being a finalist in the 2003 Archibald Prize). On 10 June 1991, in the Queen's Birthday Honours list, Olley was made an Officer of the Order of Australia \\"for service as an artist and to the promotion of art\\". On 12 June 2006, she was awarded Australia's highest civilian honour, the Companion of the Order, \\"for service as one of Australia's most distinguished artists, for support and philanthropy to the visual and performing arts, and for encouragement of young and emerging artists\\". In 2006, Olley was awarded the degree Doctor of Fine Arts honoris causa by the University of Newcastle.2006. Honorary degrees , The University of Newcastle, Australia Final exhibition Of the last paintings that Olley did before her death, 27 were exhibited at Sotheby's Australia in Woollahra in an exhibition entitled The Inner Sanctum of Margaret Olley that opened on 2 March 2012. Olley had put the final touches on the show the day before she died and Philip Bacon, who had exhibited her work for decades, had prepared a catalogue to show her that weekend. The opening night was attended by about 350 people among whom were the Governor-General of Australia, Quentin Bryce, who gave an address, in which she said that Olley's work was often just like the artist, \\"filled with optimism\\".Address by the Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia on the occasion of the Official opening of the Margaret Olley Exhibition Other attendees at the opening included Penelope Wensley, the Governor of Queensland, Edmund Capon, Ben Quilty and Barry Humphries.

Her ideas about art were explored in conversations held between 19 October 2009 and 22 September 2010 with author Barry Pearce, whose book based on them was published in the year of her death. Part of Olley's Paddington house, well known for its items that the painter collected and used as subject matter for her art, described as \\"her lifelong installation\\", has been recreated at the Tweed River Art Gallery, an area not far from where the artist was born. The architect of the Tweed's new Margaret Olley Centre, Bud Brannigan, said that it would be faithful to Olley's house, \\"in all of its glory\\".

A decade after Ransom left the magazine, in 1969, Kenyon College closed it down as its reputation dropped and financial burdens continued. In 1979, however, the quarterly was started up again. Marilyn Hacker, a poet, became the magazine's first full-time editor. \\"She quickly broadened the quarterly's scope to include more minority and marginalized viewpoints,\\" according to the magazine. In April 1994, the college trustees directed that costs be cut and revenues increased in various ways. Hacker left and an English professor at the college, David H. Lynn (acting editor in 1989–1990), took over on a two-thirds time basis. The publication's finances have stabilized and improved, and a Kenyon Review Board of Trustees has been set up.

It celebrates writers for the courage of their vision, their unparalleled imagination, and for the beauty of their art. The award is presented at a gala benefit dinner each year in New York City. The first award was presented to novelist E.L. Doctorow (Kenyon College '52). Novelist and short-story writer Joyce Carol Oates received the award in 2003, while poet Seamus Heaney won it in 2004. The 2005 honorees were Umberto Eco, the novelist, and Roger Angell, the New Yorker fiction editor and baseball writer. In 2006 Ian McEwan received the award; Margaret Atwood followed in 2007. In 2009 Louise Erdrich was honored, and in 2010 poet W.S. Merwin received the award. Historian, essayist and critic Simon Schama was the winner in 2011. Author and human rights advocate Elie Wiesel received the honor in 2012. In 2013 the poet Carl Phillips received the award, followed by novelist Ann Patchett in 2014. Roger Rosenblatt, author and playwright, won in 2015. The Kenyon Review honored author Hilary Mantel in 2016, and in 2017 acknowledged author Colm Toibin. Proceeds from the annual dinner go to the Kenyon Review's endowment fund, which supports both the magazine and the scholarships and fellowships to the Review's summer writing programs.

Doctorow Fund to provide additional scholarship support to a student committed to arts and literature. Poetry submissions Poetry editor David Baker, in a 2019 interview, provided information on submissions and the process. The magazine receives over 3,000 submissions a year (batches, not individual poems), and publishes some 50 of them per year in the print version, another 25 in the annual \\"Nature's Nature\\" feature on ecopoetics (published May-June). Of those 75, perhaps 15 or 20 are solicited, and so around 60 come via the open submission route. More poems are published in the Kenyon Review Online. A group of trained student associates do part of the first reading and they have the right to reject; it takes two such rejections before a poem is actually rejected. Baker does the final selection, and David Lynn does the \\"final sign-off\\".

It was built as either a complete bus or a bus chassis and was the Mercedes-Benz adaptation of the unified German VöV-Standard-Bus design, that was produced by many different bus manufacturers including Büssing, Magirus-Deutz, MAN, Ikarus, Gräf/Steyr, Heuliez, Renault, and Pegaso. The O305 was designed for use as a single-decker bus, however it was later redesigned to accommodate double-decker bodies. Germany Bergen trolleybus O305G in July 1989 Mercedes-Benz unveiled the O305 prototype in 1967, production in Mannheim started in 1969. A slightly elongated Standard- Überlandbus suburban model (11.3m) followed in 1970, replaced by the O307 class in 1972. From 1974 the O305 received a more powerful engine and an epicyclic gear rear axle plainly audible by its distinctive singing noise. An articulated version was named the O305G. In the mid 1970s, the Falkenried rolling stock manufacturer had developed a transmission concept with the engine and the power train placed in the rear part. After Mercedes-Benz had acquired the patent, a 1977 prototype was deployed by the Hamburger Hochbahn public transport operator. Production began in 1978. After a first converted trolleybus version named the O305T was deployed in Kaiserslautern, Daimler- Benz built five articulated buses with a BBC-Sécheron electrical equipment (O305GT) which served the public transport in Kaiserslautern and the Bergen trolleybus system, from 1985 in Basel, and finally in Brașov, Romania. Four dual-mode bus types were built in 1983 and deployed in Esslingen and Essen. Twenty hybrid electric variants were used by the Stuttgarter Straßenbahnen public transport company and in Wesel. In 1979, the CMTC in Brazil imported one O305T for test until 1980.http://onibusbrasil.com/blog/2011/04/22/hoje-62-anos-a-historia-do- brasil-e-do-trolebus/ From 1984 onwards, the O305 was replaced by the second generation of the German Standard-Linienbus Mercedes-Benz O405. Production of the O305 ceased in early 1987. Hong Kong 1985 Kowloon Motor Bus Alexander RH bodied O305 In Hong Kong, the O305 was the first bus model from outside United Kingdom and countries of Commonwealth of Nations to be purchased. A total of 41 buses were introduced, with the prototype in 1983 and the others in 1985. All were withdrawn and subsequently scrapped in 2001/02 except three, which are preserved by groups of bus enthusiasts in Hong Kong and Australia.Mercedes-Benz O305 (ME1-ME41) Bus Datafile =Background and history= For a long period of time, Hong Kong franchised bus operators were required by law to purchase double-decker buses produced in Commonwealth countries. After repealing the requirement in 1983, Mercedes-Benz supplied a two-axle 11-metre double-decker to Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB).Alexander's HK Merc Commercial Motor 12 March 1983 The O305 demonstrator was registered on 4 August 1983. Following successful trials, KMB ordered another 40 in 1985, with improved frontal design and ventilation system. All the 41 buses were fitted with Alexander RH bodies. KMB later adopted a policy of acquiring 3-axle double-decker buses of similar length. Because Mercedes-Benz did not offer a 3-axle version of the O305, no more Mercedes-Benz buses were purchased by KMB. =In service= Initially, the first bus ran on route 105, which was new, running between Lai Chi Kok and Sheung Wan. However, Cross Harbour Tunnel's environment was unsuitable for this model, as well as the fact that the towing of these buses by the tow trucks used by the tunnel authority could result in damage to the chassis, so entire fleet were reallocated to express routes running between Yuen Long and Tsuen Wan/Kowloon. The O305s were renowned for their speed and power, with a maximum speed of over 120 km/h reported. The buses provided services on the trunk routes in Yuen Long until the mid-1990s. With newer buses (especially those with air conditioning) available for trunk services, the Mercedes were redistributed to North District and Tai Po and served there until their retirement on 22 November 2002. These buses had a unique livery designed by KMB, but all of them had the livery returned to the standard livery of KMB non-air-conditioned buses shortly before their re- distribution. Singapore In 1982, Singapore Bus Services (SBS) acquired a single Willowbrook-bodied Mercedes Benz O305 double-deck bus in June for trial purposes. A year later, SBS also took in a second Mercedes Benz O305 double- deck demonstrator with a prototype Alexander R-type body make that was previously exhibited at the 1982 Commercial Motor Show in the UK. These buses were retired in the mid 1990s. Satisfied with the trial, SBS purchased 200 Mercedes-Benz O305 double-deck buses with Alexander-R bodywork in 1984.Biggest Alexander order Commercial Motor 20 August 1983 They featured an 11,412 cc OM 407h engine with its modular W3D 080 R gearbox. At 11.1 metres long and a licensed capacity of 109 passengers, they were the largest non-air conditioned double-decker buses in Singapore. They entered service from 1984 to 1987 and were deployed to Ang Mo Kio, Toa Payoh and Hougang bus depots throughout their lifespan. Withdrawals began in 1996 and the last units were retired by late 2001. Australia =Perth= Perth was the first Australian city to operate the Mercedes-Benz O305. The first units entered service with the Metropolitan Transport Trust (MTT) in 1975. Over a period of eleven years between 1975 and 1986, over 400 O305s were purchased. Transperth (as the MTT was rebranded in 1986) and its contractors began withdrawing this sizable fleet of O305s in October 1999 although it would be 2012 until the last were withdrawn. The bodies were built by Freighter Industries, JW Bolton, Hillquip and Howard Porter. There were some unusual O305s operating in Perth. Examples include 444, which featured a Mauri (Italy) body assembled locally by JW Bolton and 007, an experimental bus (model OG305) with an LPG-fuelled engine. In 1984, 008 Australia's first CNG-fuelled bus entered service. From the success of the trial gas buses, two O305s (270/1) were converted to LPG operation in the early 1980s, a CNG-fuelled O305G was ordered and entered service in 1987 as 009. In the early 1990s 26 O305s were converted to CNG. Perth was also the first Australian city to operate the articulated Mercedes-Benz O305G. Three batches were purchased with 18 in 1979, three in 1980, and 19 in 1986/87. The first and second batches had bodywork completed by JW Bolton and Howard Porter and featured model OM 407h 240 hp (177 kW) naturally aspirated engines. To overcome sluggishness, the buses in the third batch (also featuring Howard Porter bodies but built to the VöV-II design) were fitted with model OM 407hA 280 hp (206 kW) turbocharged engines. =Sydney= Sydney Buses Pressed Metal Corporation bodied O305 in August 2015 The Public Transport Commission and its successors operated the largest fleet of O305s, purchasing 1,287 O305s and 30 articulated O305Gs, all bodied by Pressed Metal Corporation for use in Sydney and Newcastle.

Narkiss was commander of the Israel Defense Forces units in the Central Region during the 1967 Six-Day War. Narkiss appears in the famous photograph of Defense Minister Moshe Dayan flanked by Chief of Staff Yitzhak Rabin taken in the Old City of Jerusalem shortly after its capture from Jordanian forces.Poster of Uzi Narkiss Biography Uzi Narkiss was born in Jerusalem to Polish Jewish parents. His first memory was of going into hiding during the 1929 Arab riots. Narkiss attended high school at Gymnasia Rehavia. He joined the Palmach at the age of 16A Defender of Jerusalem, Jerusalem Post supplement by Greer Fay Cashman (partial interview with Narkiss) and was involved in Haganah operations against British Mandatory forces in Palestine. He died in Jerusalem at the age of 72. Military career Gen. Uzi Narkiss, Defense Minister Moshe Dayan and Chief of staff Yitzhak Rabin in the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War Pages from the Quran taken from the body of Abdul Kader al-Husseini's body by Uzi Narkiss In April 1948, Narkiss headed the assault on Katamon with the Fourth Battalion of the Harel Brigade, during which time they captured the monastery at San Simon — a key strategic position. Following the final departure of the British in May 1948 and the Israeli Declaration of Independence, Narkiss was appointed to assist those besieged in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City. Narkiss' unit, dubbed a \\"diversionary force,\\" succeeded in penetrating Zion Gate, bringing in supplies and evacuating the wounded from those under siege. When military reinforcements failed to appear, however, Narkiss ordered his men to retreat, with the Old City falling to Jordanian forces shortly thereafter.Page 189 in: Narkiss spent several years studying in France at the École de Guerre (the French Military Academy). He later served as an Israeli military attaché and was awarded the Légion d’honneur by the French government. In 1965, he was appointed the first director of the Israel National Defense College. During the Six-Day War on June 5, 1967, with seven brigades under his command known as Central Command, Narkiss was responsible for combating any possible Jordanian offensive. Capturing the Old City was not part of the plan. Israeli units moved effectively to take key positions in east Jerusalem, where one key location was Ammunition Hill. Still, to Narkiss' dismay, the politicians would still not allow the Old City to be taken. But with a looming cease fire approaching after an emergency meeting of the UN, Moshe Dayan gave the order to Narkiss who quickly capitalised on the opportunity to capture the city before any cease fire prevented this as an option. Under his direction, the Old City was captured on June 7 and Jerusalem was reunified under Israeli control. From Narkiss' viewpoint, this completed the campaign he had begun 19 years earlier, and whose previous failure had haunted him. After the war the Palestinian village of Beit Awwa was completely destroyed.UN Doc A/8389 of 5 October 1971 A/8389 of 5 October 1971.

The Special Committee has ascertained that all these villages have been completely destroyed. Para 58. the village of Nebi Samwil was in fact destroyed by Israeli armed forces on March 22, 1971. Moshe Dayan claimed the destruction was carried out under the orders of an officer who wished to expel the residents; Brigadier General Uzi Narkiss claimed the credit for the action.Segev, 2007, p. 409 In 1948 Uzi Narkiss searched the body of the dead Palestinian commander Abdul Kader Husseini for his Koran on the battlefield. In the 1980s he wanted to give it to Kader's son Faisal Husseini but only \\"in the presence of journalists and TV cameras – otherwise I am not interested\\". Husseini was not interested under such terms, therefore Narkiss kept it in his library.Husseini's Koran Public positions After his retirement from the army in 1968, Narkiss held key positions in the Jewish Agency and the World Zionist Organization.

His first significant stint as a drummer was for the grindcore band Terrorizer, formed in 1986, where he began to demonstrate some of his talent. Heavily influenced by the grindcore music around him, Sandoval quickly developed his abilities as a drummer with little formal training or musical education. TOC  Career  In 1988, Sandoval was invited to join the death metal band Morbid Angel. Concurrently, the original lineup of Terrorizer was dissolved after the departures of Sandoval and guitarist Jesse Pintado (who subsequently joined Napalm Death). Sandoval had never used two bass drums before joining Morbid Angel. He had to practice frequently in order to get his feet up to speed, and recorded the Altars of Madness album within only a couple of months of joining Morbid Angel. According to Morbid Angel guitarist Trey Azagthoth, the band would occasionally walk in on Sandoval passed out on the floor in a pool of sweat. After being woken up, he would immediately say, \\"Time to get back to work!\\" After mastering the double-bass technique in Morbid Angel, Sandoval also implemented it in Terrorizer's World Downfall album when the band briefly re- united to record it. According to former singer David Vincent, the band once played a prank on Sandoval by making him listen to a band that used a preprogrammed drum machine, and pretended it was a real drummer who could play faster than he could. Sandoval was gutted, and went on to practice until he managed to play faster than the machine.David Vincent interview in \\"Hard Rock Magazine\\" n°3, June 1995, p.31 In 2010, he had to undergo surgery to repair a prolapsed disc. Not being able to play painlessly for an extended period for up to a year, he was replaced by Tim Yeung for the recording and touring of Morbid Angel's 2011 album Illud Divinum Insanus. In December 2013, David Vincent stated in an interview that Sandoval was no longer with Morbid Angel, citing incompatibility with the band after Sandoval's conversion to Christianity as the reason. In a 2014 interview, Sandoval said that his beliefs would not affect Terrorizer's music or lyrical content, explaining that his faith had given him a positive outlook on life. Sandoval explains that the reason for his split from Morbid Angel was not a religious matter, but having the time to recover from his back surgery which took much longer than he had expected, as the band would not wait for him to recover, thus prompting them to find a new drummer. He also mentioned that after the recording of Terrorizer's 2012 album Hordes of Zombies was when he converted to Christianity and his life started to change, crediting his mother and sister for their encouragement. Sandoval said that he would not have continued to perform in the band after his conversion due to his newfound religious differences with them. When asked if he misses performing with Morbid Angel, he said, \\"No, I don't. I don't miss it. I don't miss any of that.\\" His relationship with the band members is no longer existent without any negativity on both sides.

WFAN's studios are located in the combined Entercom facility in the Hudson Square neighborhood of lower Manhattan and its transmitter is located on High Island in the Bronx. Its 50,000-watt clear channel signal can be heard at night throughout much of the eastern United States and Canada. WFAN is also heard on WFAN-FM. WFAN was the world’s first radio station to adopt the 24/7 sports radio format.  History  = Early years of 660 = The 660 frequency in New York City originated as WEAF on March 2, 1922, owned by AT&T.; In 1926 WEAF became the flagship station of the NBC Red Network, one of two radio chains operated by the National Broadcasting Company (NBC). By 1928 WEAF was purchased by NBC's parent company, the Radio Corporation of America. As a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1941, WEAF became a clear-channel station and could be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night. In 1943 the Supreme Court of the United States, citing antitrust concerns, ordered RCA to sell off one of its radio networks. The company decided to keep the Red Network, and it was rebranded as the NBC Radio Network after the Blue Network was divested to Edward J. Noble, which was later renamed the American Broadcasting Company (ABC). WEAF's call letters were changed to WNBC in 1946, then to WRCA in 1954, and back to WNBC in 1960. During the 1960s, WNBC relied less on network programming and adopted a talk format, followed by a switch to a MOR music sound. The station spent much of the 1970s and early 1980s flipping between the Top 40 and adult contemporary formats, with varying success. By the middle of the 1980s up until its closing, WNBC played less music and relied more on personality-driven talk programs with hosts such as Howard Stern, Don Imus, Joey Reynolds, Alan Colmes, and Soupy Sales. = The launch of sports radio on 1050 = At 3:00 p.m. on July 1, 1987, Emmis Communications-owned WFAN signed on at 1050 kHz, replacing country music station WHN, and billing itself as the world's first 24-hour-per-day sports talk station. (The WFAN call sign was suggested by the wife of \\"The Fan's\\" first program director, John Chanin.) The first live voice heard on WFAN was that of Suzyn Waldman, with a sports update, followed by the first show, which was hosted by Jim Lampley. Waldman reported for the station, covering the New York Yankees and New York Knicks for 14 years. Other hosts besides Lampley during WFAN's fifteen months at 1050 kHz included Bill Mazer, Pete Franklin, Greg Gumbel, Art Shamsky, and Ed Coleman. Ann Liguori is also one of the original hosts and was the first woman to host a show on the station. \\"Hey Liguori, What's the Story\\" aired the first weekend the station was on the air in 1987 and continued until 2008. WFAN also inherited broadcast rights to the defending World Series champion New York Mets from WHN, who had held the rights since 1983; Mets games stayed on WFAN until 2013. = WFAN moves to 660 = In early 1988 General Electric, which now owned NBC through its purchase of RCA two years earlier, announced that it would close NBC's radio division and sell its owned-and-operated stations. In February of that year GE made a multi-station deal with Emmis and, in New York City the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. On October 7, 1988 at 5:30 p.m., WFAN moved down the radio dial to replace WNBC at 660 kHz. The last voice heard on WNBC was that of Alan Colmes, who counted down the seconds to WNBC's demise with the legendary NBC chimes (the notes G-E-C) playing in the background. = After the switch = As Don Imus had already been the morning show host at WNBC, WFAN left his program in place when they took over the frequency. WFAN's original morning show on 1050 was hosted by Greg Gumbel; his was a straightforward sports show, but it was not doing well in the ratings. At the time of the switch, sports talk radio was still an untested format with questionable prospects, and the idea of bringing on board a host that appealed to a broader audience would get more people to try the station out. WFAN also benefitted from the inertia from Imus's fans who were used to tuning into 660 kHz on weekday mornings to listen. WFAN instantly took advantage of its Imus inheritance; for example, it featured a special live monologue by Imus character \\"Billy Sol Hargus\\" from Shea Stadium moments after taking over the 660 frequency. Imus slightly altered his show for his new employer, adding sports updates and replays of last night's big plays. Discussions of sports stories that crossed over to general interest were also featured on the program, although Imus also kept many of his regular comedy bits that were not sports-related. Initially WFAN aired sports news and score updates every 15 minutes (at the quarter-hour), but by 1991 began doing updates every 20 minutes (at :00, :20 and :40 past the hour). These updates, called 20-20 Sports Flashes, are now considered an industry standard. Additionally, in a nod to the former WNBC, update anchors often end their top-of-the-hour updates with the catchphrase \\"And that's what's happening ...\\", which is how WNBC on- air news readers had ended their updates. WFAN discontinued the thrice-hourly updates on January 2, 2018; updates now occur only at the top of the hour. Other programming that WFAN had at its launch included a mid-morning show with Ed Coleman and Mike Francesa, and an afternoon drive time show with Pete Franklin, who in Cleveland had become one of the first polarizing, outrageous talk show hosts. During his stay in New York City Franklin was probably best known for an incident where he used a four-letter expletive on air, in error, when trying to say \\"All you folks\\" (he was not disciplined for the incident). Running a close second was a 30-second Franklin diatribe on whether he had been offensive – \\"Do I offend anyone? I'm not here to offend you, dammit!\\" – that has been replayed ever since, especially on the July 1 WFAN anniversaries. In a further drive to boost ratings, Imus instigated a feud with Franklin, much as he had with Howard Stern at WNBC in the mid-1980s. Both Imus and Franklin took shots at each other during their shows, Franklin calling Imus \\"Minus\\" and Imus recording parodies of radio commercials where he bashed Franklin as a \\"dinosaur\\", among other things. Ratings did not increase, and Franklin left WFAN in August 1989. On September 5, 1989, a jointly hosted afternoon drive show with Francesa and Christopher \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo – who had been a weekend/fill-in host to that time – would premiere. The Mike and the Mad Dog show became the defining show of WFAN, one of the most consistently popular radio shows in New York City and one of the most influential sports talk radio shows in the country. The combined success of Mike and the Mad Dog and Imus in the Morning helped WFAN become the number-one billing station in America during the 1990s. It also proved that the all-sports format worked as a radio format, prompting the explosion of sports talk radio across the country. In 1992, Emmis sold WFAN to Infinity Broadcasting, which would be purchased by Westinghouse Electric Corporation – CBS' then-parent company – in 1997. On February 2, 2017, CBS Radio announced it would merge with Philadelphia-based Entercom. The merger was approved on November 9, 2017, and was consummated eight days later. Current programming Since January 2, 2020, WFAN's current line-up includes, Boomer and Gio, co-hosted by former National Football League quarterback Boomer Esiason and Gregg Giannotti. Maggie Gray and Marc Malusis host the midday show from 10am until 2pm. Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts who previously hosted the midday show on WFAN since 2007, host the afternoon drive program. Mike's On: Francesa on the Fan, with Mike Francesa, is a post-afternoon drive program that runs from 6:00 pm until 6:30 pm. Francesa previously hosted the afternoon drive program by himself. On Monday nights during the NFL season, an NFL-based program serves as the lead in to Monday Night Football. In 2017, these broadcasts were hosted by Kim Jones and Carl Banks from Dan Rooney's Sports Bar at Empire City Casino in Yonkers, New York. Steve Somers hosts during most other evenings, often leading into and/or following live game broadcasts. John Jastremski works the majority of the overnight shifts and hosts during the evenings on weekends. Other regular overnight and weekend hosts include Jody McDonald, Chris Moore, Richard Neer, Bob Salter, Rick Wolff and Ed Randall. The update team consists of Harris Allen, Mike McCann, Erica Herskowitz, Bob Heussler, Joey Wahler, Chris Lopresti, and Jerry Recco. WFAN's update anchors also provide similar duties for sister station WINS. The station also employs beat reporters to cover the Mets (Ed Coleman), Yankees (Sweeny Murti), Jets (Brian Costello) and Giants (Paul Dottino). WFAN stands out in that all of its sports-talk shows are currently local in origin, not syndicated as is the practice of most sports-talk radio stations (usually except during the morning and/or drive- time periods). Over the years WFAN has established a tight bond with its listeners, to the point that one of them eventually landed a regular on-air spot. Joe Benigno had been a frequent caller to \\"The Fan\\" (especially the Mike and the Mad Dog show) as \\"Joe from Saddle River\\" and his calls were typically interesting and insightful. In 1994 he was chosen to host a one-hour show during a promotion in which listeners were invited to host a show. The test went well, and he later parlayed it into a regular overnight shift, which started in 1995. In 2010, the station was honored by the National Association of Broadcasters with the Marconi award for Sports Station of the Year. =Team coverage= Currently, WFAN airs broadcasts of MLB's New York Yankees, the NFL's New York Giants, and the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. During baseball season, the Yankees have first priority of airtime over all of the other teams. During the fall and early winter, the Giants have first priority followed by the Nets. The station is the flagship outlet for Westwood One's NFL broadcasts and some of its National Collegiate Athletic Association college football and basketball broadcasts. Since 2013, sister station WCBS has been utilized as WFAN's main \\"conflict\\" station for pre- and regular-season Giants and regular season Nets games, and some of Westwood One's NFL broadcasts. WFAN has marketed itself in recent years as the \\"Flagship Station for New York Sports.\\" Yankees manager Aaron Boone and Giants quarterback Eli Manning make exclusive appearances on WFAN during their respective baseball and football seasons. The station was the longtime radio home for the New Jersey Devils, New York Mets, New York Jets, New York Rangers and New York Knicks (the latter two were inherited from WNBC while the Jets coverage was moved from WCBS). Currently, WFAN's primary competition is WEPN-FM, the New York ESPN Radio affiliate which now carries the Jets, Knicks and Rangers plus national ESPN Radio programming, all of which WFAN previously broadcast. During the 2016-17 and 2017-18 seasons, WFAN broadcast New York Islanders games produced by Hofstra University-owned WRHU in Hempstead. Beginning in 2018-19 both the Devils and Islanders moved their broadcasts to the Radio.com platform, though WFAN is expected to broadcast a limited number of Devils contests. The station also carried matches of New York City FC during its inaugural 2015 season. WFAN was the sole flagship of the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship carried over Westwood One, but beginning in 2006, competitor WEPN took over a majority of the coverage including early round games as well as of conference tournament finals that Dial Global had the rights to; WFAN would air some of the conference tournament games but would not usually air the early round tournament games opting instead for local programming. WFAN does broadcast some of the tournament, but the majority of it—including the Final Four and the National Championship Game—is carried by WEPN-FM. On April 11, 2006, WFAN started streaming live on the Internet. Web streaming of live games, however, is limited due to broadcast rights (Yankees and Nets games are offered separately through the MLB and NBA websites as annual subscriptions). When these games are broadcast over the air, listeners who have Internet access receives alternate sports talk programming through CBS Sports Radio. As of April 2010, WFAN stopped streaming live on the Internet to listeners outside of the United States. Due to MLB and NFL blackout rules, WFAN is only allowed to air sporting events involving the New York-area teams within its home market; therefore, stations that carry WFAN on a HD radio subchannel are required to broadcast alternate programming in its place. =Radiothon= Each spring from 1990 until 2007, WFAN conducted the \\"WFAN Radiothon\\" to benefit children's charities that seek to ensure the continuity of life in its earliest stages and the treatment and eventual elimination of childhood cancer. The three most recent beneficiaries of the radiothon were Tomorrow's Children's Fund, the CJ Foundation for SIDS, and the Imus Ranch. WFAN has also done other radiothons and special broadcasts to raise money for assorted charities. On August 15, 2008, Mike Francesa announced during the final broadcast of Mike and the Mad Dog that WFAN would broadcast a new fundraising radiothon. The new fundraiser would benefit both the Boomer Esiason Foundation for cystic fibrosis research, and the Mike Francesa Champions of the Heart Foundation, a new charity created by Francesa. The first radiothon took place in September 2008. =Midday show controversy= The midday slot has been one of the better slots from a ratings perspective for WFAN. However, this slot's hosts have often found controversy. In the mid-1990s, popular hosts Ed Coleman and Dave Sims had their show cancelled. WFAN then announced that New York Daily News columnist Mike Lupica and WNBC-TV sports anchor Len Berman would co-host the new midday program. The show seemed all set to go when, at the last minute, Berman decided to back out of the show. He cited that he would have to work a near 14-hour day, combining his 10 a.m. start on radio with his WNBC-TV duties, which consisted of him appearing on all three of the station's evening newscasts. WFAN would not let Berman out of his contract, and as a result, the slot was split into two shows: Lupica hosted from 10 a.m. to noon, while Berman hosted from noon to 2 p.m. The split format did not work, and eventually Berman's show would be cancelled and Lupica's show soon followed. WWOR-TV sports anchor Russ Salzberg, who also worked an evening sportscast, was more than willing to assume the midday show duties. In 1995, he was joined by longtime overnight host Steve Somers and the show became known as \\"The Sweater and The Schmoozer\\", playing off Salzberg's habit of wearing sweaters on the air and Somers' on-air nickname. The midday show featured one of the most famous incidents in WFAN history. It occurred when Salzberg \\"banned\\" Eli from Westchester from calling his show due to his comments that Salzberg considered to be inappropriate. Salzberg notoriously said to Somers, during another Atlanta Braves World Series appearance talking about Braves' manager Bobby Cox: \\"What about Cox, Steve? You like Cox ... don't you, Steve?\\" In 1999, with the ratings not being what WFAN management expected, the Salzberg/Somers show was cancelled and both men were fired. However a large outcry from listeners over the termination of the popular Somers—including comedian Jerry Seinfeld, a native of Long Island—led to WFAN management giving Somers the evening shift, which (despite frequent pre-emptions for live games) he continues to hold to the present day. In middays, Salzberg and Somers were replaced by Suzyn Waldman and Jody McDonald. Waldman had been with WFAN since its infancy, as she was the first update anchor, and had served as the station's Yankees beat reporter and the Knicks' studio host. McDonald, son of a former Mets general manager and also one of the original WFAN personalities, was the weekend overnight host before leaving for sister station WIP in Philadelphia, nearer to his southern New Jersey home. Both Waldman and McDonald had their fans and detractors at WFAN. Waldman would leave WFAN in late 2001, joining the Yankees television broadcast team the following year. She would be replaced by Sid Rosenberg who, despite his shock jock reputation, had a vast knowledge of sports. Many felt there was great chemistry between McDonald and Rosenberg. However, the ratings still weren't what WFAN expected and in 2004 McDonald was let go, later to join WEPN, Sirius Satellite Radio, and WPEN radio in Philadelphia before returning in 2012. Overnight host Joe Benigno would replace McDonald and in 2014, Waldman returned to become the first woman color commentator for the station's Yankees broadcasts. Rosenberg was forced to resign from WFAN on September 12, 2005 after being given an ultimatum by station management for not showing up to host the New York Giants' pregame show the day before. Benigno hosted the show solo for over a year, and on January 2, 2007, part-time overnight host Evan Roberts became Benigno's new midday co-host. The pairing continues to consistently out-rate rival station WEPN, which broadcasts network and local programming opposite it. =Twentieth anniversary= On July 1, 2007, WFAN celebrated its twentieth anniversary. On the weekend of July 4, past WFAN hosts such as Suzyn Waldman and Jim Lampley did guest-hosting stints, and the station's current hosts provided career and station retrospectives throughout the weekend. The station also invited listeners to vote on the \\"Greatest New York sports moments\\", and the \\"Top 20 New York sports celebrities\\", during WFAN's 20-year history. =Twenty-fifth anniversary= On June 25, 2012, notable current staff announced their favorite moments, interviews, and teams. On June 28, 2012, it was revealed that Mike Francesa would join Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton on the Boomer and Carton program on June 29, 2012 as part of the festivities. It marked the first time they had appeared together since 2009, when Francesa was still the number one sports talk show host in New York. Later in the day, Carton and Esiason would join Francesa on his show, Mike's On: Francesa on the FAN. The same day—Carton surprised everyone by welcoming back host Sid Rosenberg, and Rosenberg later joined Francesa for a short interview the next day. Other notable former hosts who joined Mike Francesa included Christopher \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo and Don Imus. =Move to Manhattan= On October 10, 2009 WFAN moved from its studio location for its first 22 years, the landmarked Kaufman Astoria Studios in Astoria, Queens. The station began broadcasting from CBS Radio's then-new Hudson Square studios in Manhattan. Along with the move, the station changed its longtime call-in phone number from 1 (718) 937-6666 to 1 (877) 337-6666. =WFAN-FM= On October 6, 2012, CBS Radio announced the purchase of WRXP (101.9 FM) from Merlin Media for $75 Million. CBS began operating 101.9 under a local marketing agreement (LMA) at 11:57 p.m. on November 1, 2012, with the call sign changed to WFAN-FM. Transition =Exit Imus, enter Boomer and Carton= On the April 4, 2007 broadcast of Imus in the Morning, Don Imus made a sexually and racially controversial comment in reference to the Rutgers University women's basketball team. Imus made the remarks during a conversation with the show's producer, Bernard McGuirk, and Sid Rosenberg (who was on the phone).CBS News: CBS Fires Don Imus Over Racial Slur. February 11, 2009. Two days after making the comments, Imus issued a public apology. By that time, however, there were various calls for his dismissal, particularly from civil rights activists Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, who threatened to protest both CBS Radio and MSNBC (which aired a video simulcast of the program), and to boycott companies who advertised on the program. WFAN offered its hosts and listeners a sounding board for their own feelings and comments, which were both for and against his dismissal. Chris Russo, in particular, expressed his disappointment at Imus for waiting two days before retracting his comments. Imus was initially given a two-week suspension which was scheduled to begin on April 16, allowing him to work the annual WFAN Radiothon on April 12 and 13. On consecutive days Imus appeared on both Sharpton's syndicated radio show (April 9) and NBC-TV's Today Show (April 10) to reiterate his regret for the remarks. But on April 11, MSNBC announced the cancellation of the video simulcast of Imus in the Morning. The following day, CBS Radio dismissed Imus, at the time leaving WFAN with a very large programming—and money-earning—void in its schedule. Imus' last WFAN program was aired on the opening day of the radiothon. Imus's wife Deirdre joined his longtime co-host, comedy writer, and news reader, Charles McCord, to anchor the final segment of the radiothon on April 13. Imus revived his program at WABC radio in December 2007, and took his fundraiser with him—with the charities intact—and conducted a radiothon there in May 2008. From that point on, the 6:00 to 10:00 a.m. time slot was filled by various hosts. McCord and Chris Carlin remained on all the replacement shows as assistants and staff, in similar roles as they were on Imus's show, and the replacement shows continued to be syndicated via Westwood One. Mike Francesa and Chris Russo were the first to fill the spot, hosting for the two weeks (April 16–27) immediately after Imus' firing. Francesa and Russo also worked the shift separate from each other, as did fellow WFAN staffers Richard Neer, Joe Benigno and Evan Roberts, and Carlin, who worked both alone and with co-hosts, notably Kimberly Jones and Washington Post sports columnist John Feinstein. WFAN and Westwood One also brought in outside personalities into the slot. Among them were Boomer Esiason, Patrick McEnroe, Geraldo Rivera, Lou Dobbs, and Chicago market sports radio host Mike North. As MSNBC also held its own claim to the slot, the cable network was able to have its own replacement shows simulcasted; these programs were hosted by in-house personalities David Gregory, Jim Cramer, and Joe Scarborough; eventually Scarborough would become the permanent replacement host on MSNBC with Morning Joe. On September 4, 2007, Esiason took over as the permanent host of the WFAN morning show, with veteran radio personality Craig Carton (previously of WKXW-FM in Trenton, New Jersey) serving as co-host, and Chris Carlin remaining to do sports updates. The new program is not distributed nationally by Westwood One. Charles McCord left the station shortly after the announcement was made and has since rejoined Don Imus at WABC. Carlin was also given his own show in the one-hour time slot immediately preceding Esiason's show. The television simulcast, which had been on MSNBC since 1996, was not immediately brought back; it was not until September 2010 that WFAN reached an agreement with MSG Network to simulcast Boomer and Carton live each weekday; each four-hour show was simulcast live with a condensed one-hour \\"best-of\\" program airing later each day and throughout the weekend. In January 2014, the show's televised simulcast moved to CBS Sports Network. Carton was arrested on September 6, 2017, along with Michael Wright, and charged with four counts of fraud in what authorities say was a Ponzi scheme that duped investors of millions of dollars by promising them a share of the profits from the sale of concert tickets. The two were reportedly trying to pay off millions of dollars in gambling debts. Carton was suspended indefinitely by CBS Radio and later resigned from the station. Esiason hosted the morning show by himself with guest hosts until Gregg Giannotti was announced as Carton's full time replacement. =The end of Mike and the Mad Dog= During their 19-year run as WFAN's afternoon drive team, Mike Francesa and Chris Russo had enjoyed a relationship—both on- and off- air—which varied from respect to contempt. The two hosts did not get along well during the early days of their partnership, and had several differences which potentially put their program in jeopardy. In spite of the disagreements, the duo always seemed to patch things up for the benefit of the station and their listeners. In early 2008, several reports surfaced that Francesa and Russo were on the outs again, and these reports came as both men's contracts with WFAN were in the early stages of renegotiation. On June 22, 2008, sports columnist Neil Best of Newsday reported that the Francesa/Russo relationship had cooled, and they were considering ending their radio show. Francesa, reached by Newsday while vacationing, refused to comment. Russo, doing the show alone on June 23, denied the rumors. But on the June 27, 2008 broadcast, Francesa (working alone as Russo was on vacation) acknowledged the show was at a \\"crossroad\\", and could not guarantee the show would last through the summer. Francesa also stated he and Russo had not spoken since reports of their possible breakup came out. On July 11, 2008, Francesa and Russo reunited for their first show together since news of their possible breakup came out. Both men were coy about their future beyond the summer. Francesa and Russo then continued their normal summer routine of alternating vacation weeks, and on August 5, 2008, they would do their final show together at the New York Giants' training facility at the University of Albany. On August 14, 2008, Russo reached a mutual agreement with WFAN to let him out of his contract, which ran until October 2009. Russo insisted it was solely a personal decision and said, \\"This has nothing to do with Mike and I hating each other... This is about doing something different. I'm 48 years old and there are not going to be too many more opportunities to break away. It's time to try something else, but it was a tough decision to make.\\" On August 15, Russo phoned Francesa on the show to say goodbye. A highly emotional Russo began to break down on air as he talked about his partnership with Francesa. At the same time, while Russo left WFAN, Francesa signed a five-year deal to stay at WFAN and continue to host the afternoon drive-time show. On August 19, 2008, Russo signed a five-year contract worth about 3 million per year with Sirius XM to headline a new sports talk channel called Mad Dog Radio on both Sirius and XM satellite radio. Russo said there was nothing WFAN could have done to keep him after Sirius XM provided him an opportunity to not only do a show, but have his own channel, which he could not pass up. Influence of sports format WFAN's success—especially after the 1988 frequency switch—proved that sports-talk radio could in fact be a steadily profitable and popular format. This in turn fueled the explosive growth of sports-talk radio in the 1990s and 2000s (decade). Once a novelty, every major market (and many smaller markets) now has at least one sports radio station, and often more. ESPN Radio, Fox Sports Radio and Yahoo! Sports Radio have all launched 24-hour national sports talk radio networks, while NBC Sports Radio and CBS Sports Radio (the latter of which WFAN will be a member) are set to launch in fall 2012. There are also nationally syndicated radio shows, such as The Jim Rome Show and 2 Live Stews. Additionally there are dedicated sports radio streams on satellite radio, such as NFL Radio on Sirius and MLB Home Plate on XM Satellite Radio. With the migration of music stations to FM and other carriers all but complete, sports talk radio are considered to have been critical in saving the AM band as a viable broadcast medium. It is worth noting that, for all the success and influence that WFAN has had, its signature Mike and the Mad Dog show experienced limited syndication outside of New York state (the show had been carried over WQYK in Tampa, Florida and WROW in Albany, New York). This was primarily due to a desire by the hosts to keep their show New York-centric. WFAN once produced some of Fox Sports Radio's programming, notably Chris \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo's Saturday show, but the relationship did not last even one year for the same reason that Mike'd Up is syndicated nationally only through the YES Network—the hosts often talk about the NFL on a national basis, but stick mostly to local coverage of baseball. Nevertheless, callers from as far as California and Norway made it to air. Frequent callers Callers are an important facet of WFAN programming. A few callers have earned a reputation over the years and become as familiar to listeners as the hosts themselves. ;Jerome from Manhattan Jerome Mittelman, known on-air as \\"Jerome from Manhattan,\\" is a die-hard Yankees and Knicks fan. Jerome is known for his on-air take-no-prisoners blistering rants and raves, as well as his unique take on the English language. One of his favorite exclamatory phrases is \\"frickin' frack!\\" He refers to the bullpen as the \\"ballpen\\", and once shouted that the Yankees are \\"... done! D-O-E-N [sic], DONE!\\" His relationship status is intriguing enough for Steve Somers to once give Jerome $60 to take a lady out on a date, only for Jerome to keep the money and not go out on the date. Former host Sid Rosenberg once asked Jerome if he was upset that he was not taking his eagerly anticipated trip \\"... to Colorado?\\", and Jerome replied, \\"No, [it was] to Denver.\\" He does \\"... not like jets. They make [him] seasick.\\" Jerome, when he still called WFAN regularly, was known as being the only caller to have an audio intro, much like those played at the top of each show. Mr. Mittelman's health problems had kept him from the WFAN airwaves on a regular basis from late 2004 until mid-2008; when he again started to call in more frequently. Occasionally when he calls into Steve Somers' program, a special introduction is played to the tune of The Twilight Zone. ;Eli from Westchester Eli Strand, known when calling as \\"Eli from Westchester\\", was another famous repeat caller. Citing racism as the underlying factor behind any number of sports happenings, he was occasionally banned from calling for periods of time. One of the most famous times he was banned was by former mid-day host Russ Salzberg. However, he was also given an on-air tryout for the job which would eventually go to Joe Benigno. Strand, from Tuckahoe, New York, played college football at Iowa State University and spent two years in the NFL with the Pittsburgh Steelers and New Orleans Saints. ;Miriam from Forest Hills \\"Miriam from Forest Hills\\" is a blind New York Islanders and New York Mets fan from Queens. The first Islanders game Miriam ever attended became the topic of a Rick Reilly column in Sports Illustrated. ;Dave from Harlem David Paterson, former Governor of New York, has been known to call into the station on occasion. He has also used the alias \\"David from Manhattan.\\" After the end of his term, Paterson sporadically appeared as a guest host and in-studio guest for the station; Paterson accepted a job with WOR in August 2011. ;Doris from Rego Park Doris Bauer was one of the best-known late-night regular callers to WFAN. Calling in as \\"Doris from Rego Park\\" for a decade, Bauer was recognized by her chronic hacking cough, an encyclopedic knowledge of baseball, and her loyalty to the Mets. She called to talk sports on the overnight show with hosts like Steve Somers. Such was her status as a beloved member of the WFAN talk community that, when she died at 58 of complications from lung and breast cancer, it was host Joe Benigno who broke the news to his late-night audience at 1 a.m., Doris' usual call-in time. ;Omar from Brooklyn \\"Omar from Brooklyn\\" is another regular called on the Boomer and Carton Show. An avid Buffalo Bills fan, Omar's trademark is to call in on a Monday to rant (often incoherently due to his thick accent) about the Bills shortcomings and his hatred for other New York teams. During these calls there is usually Middle Eastern music playing in the background, courtesy of WFAN. Boomer and Carton had Omar in studio as a guest, and Omar received a pie in the face from Boomer. Omar also received tickets from Boomer to a Jets-Bills game in 2011. ;Ira from Staten Island Ira Lieberfarb is a frequent caller from Arden Heights, Staten Island that almost exclusively talks New York Jets football. Ira has been calling the station since 1993 and attends every Jets game (both home and away). In 2012, he was rewarded with a one-on-one conversation with Mike Francesa after being voted as one of the most famous callers during WFAN's 25th anniversary celebration. ;Mike from Mahopac Mike \\"Sour Shoes\\" DelCampo, a voice impersonator also known for his long association with The Howard Stern Show, was best known for calling in to Mike and the Mad Dog. Francesa eventually tired of DelCampo's schtick and stopped taking his calls. Reception WFAN's signal can be heard clearly on much of the East Coast of the United States and Eastern Canada after sunset because it is a Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \\"Class A\\" clear channel station. During the day, WFAN's groundwave signal can be heard faintly as far south as Washington, D.C. and as far north as the I-90 corridor (the New York State Thruway and Massachusetts Turnpike), about 150 miles north of New York City. WFAN can also allegedly be heard clearly on the northern beaches of North Carolina's Outer Banks during the day and the southern beaches around Wilmington, North Carolina at night. Signal strength varies depending on factors such as weather and elevation. Still, a good car radio can pick up WFAN cleanly in most of Pennsylvania, at times as far west as central Indiana, and throughout Connecticut, as well as parts of the Philadelphia, most parts of Southern New Jersey, Boston, Albany, and Syracuse markets, especially at night (WFAN does not broadcast on reduced power overnight, and thus needs very few affiliate stations for the teams it broadcasts). Callers from these locations are not uncommon, especially as some of the on-air staffers have backgrounds in those regions (Bob Heussler does radio play-by-play for the Connecticut Sun, Fairfield Stags basketball and has done radio play-by-play for UConn basketball and football, while Chris Carlin handles Rutgers football games). Alternatively, callers instead regularly listen to WFAN's Radio.com feed or its morning show simulcast on the CBS Sports Network, along with any other coverage simulcast through their league partner's paid audio streaming options. WFAN is also heard on some of Entercom's HD Radio stations elsewhere in the country, especially in the Orlando area, which contains a number of snowbirds and retirees from the Tri- State region. The FAN Sports Network In addition to having its broadcast heard on 660 AM in New York City, WFAN's programming is also transmitted via a secured internet feed to CBS owned and operated stations. These stations simulcast the same over-the air feed that is heard in New York City including all of the live team coverage including the New York Yankees, New York Giants, New Jersey Devils, and the Brooklyn Nets. The internet stream legally cannot include professional sports coverage because the Major League Baseball, the National Basketball Association, the National Football League, and the National Hockey League provide their own in-house on-demand and yearly subscription services for live and archived radio and television broadcasts. WFAN's simulcasts make it one of only a handful of terrestrial based radio superstations in the United States; KPIG-FM in Freedom, California, and WBBR in New York also syndicate terrestrially, though through different providers. ;WFAN HD FM simulcasts *WJFK-FM 106.7-HD3 Manassas, Virginia/Washington, D.C. *WOCL 105.9-HD2 DeLand/Orlando, Florida Notable on-air staff =Current staff= * Joe Benigno * Ed Coleman * Boomer Esiason * Mike Francesa * Bob Heussler * Kimberly Jones * Ann Liguori * Anita Marks * Jody McDonald * Sweeny Murti * Richard Neer * Ed Randall * Jerry Recco * Evan Roberts * Steve Somers * John Sterling * Suzyn Waldman * Rick Wolff =Former staff= * Len Berman * Mike Breen * Kevin Burkhardt * Chris Carlin * Craig Carton * Roberto Clemente, Jr. * Gary Cohen * Linda Cohn * Howard David * Spero Dedes * Ian Eagle * Scott Ferrall * Pete Franklin * Greg Gumbel * Don Imus * Jim Lampley * Steve Levy * Josh Lewin * Mike Lupica * Bill Mazer * Tom McCarthy * Charles McCord * John Minko * Bob Murphy * Tony Paige * Howie Rose * Sid Rosenberg * Spencer Ross * Christopher \\"Mad Dog\\" Russo * Sam Ryan * Bart Scott * Dave Sims * Gary Thorne * Bob Wischusen * Warner Wolf References External links  Clear-channel radio stations Radio stations established in 1922 FAN RCA 1922 establishments in New York (state) Sports radio stations in the United States New York Knicks broadcasters New York Mets broadcasters New York Rangers broadcasters CBS Sports Radio stations Entercom radio stations Hudson Square ","title":"WFAN (AM)"},{"id":"1196902","text":"Saif al-Islam Muammar Gaddafi (; born 25 June 1972) is a Libyan political figure. He is the second son of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and his second wife Safia Farkash. He was a part of his father's inner circle, performing public relations and diplomatic roles on his behalf. He publicly turned down his father's offer of the country's second highest post and held no official government position. According to American State Department officials in Tripoli, during his father's reign, he was the second most widely recognized person in Libya, being at times the \\"de facto\\" Prime Minister, and was mentioned as a possible successor, though he rejected this. An arrest warrant was issued for him on 27 June 2011 by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for charges of crimes against humanity against the Libyan people, for killing and persecuting civilians, under Articles 7(1)(a) and 7(1)(h) of the Rome statute. He denied the charges. Gaddafi was captured in southern Libya by the Zintan militia on 19 November 2011, after the end of the Libyan Civil War, and flown by plane to Zintan. He was sentenced to death on 28 July 2015 by a court in Tripoli for crimes during the civil war, in a widely criticised trial conducted in absentia. He remained in the custody of the de facto independent authorities of Zintan. On 10 June 2017, he was released from prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al-Siddiq Battalion. Later the same month, his full amnesty was declared by the Tobruk-based government led by Khalifa Haftar. , Gaddafi remained wanted under his ICC arrest warrant for crimes against humanity. Education and career Saif al-Islam Gaddafi graduated with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from Tripoli's Al Fateh University in 1994. However, there is another report stating that he is an architect. He earned an MBA from Vienna's Imadec business school in 2000. His paintings made up the bulk of the international Libyan art exhibit, \\"The Desert is Not Silent\\" (2002–2005),The Desert Is Not Silent, Internet Archive record, Historical index. a show which was supported by a host of international corporations with direct ties to his father's government, among them the ABB Group and Siemens.Commercial partners of \\"The Desert Is Not Silent\\", Internet Archive record, 29 June 2007. Gaddafi was awarded a PhD degree in 2008 from the London School of Economics, where he attended amid a series of contacts between the school and the Libyan political establishment. He presented a thesis on \\"The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from 'soft power' to collective decision-making?\\"Alqadhafi, Saif Al-Islam, The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from \\"soft power\\" to collective decision-making? , London School of Economics Library, 2008.Gaddafi son calls for democracy, BBC News, 16 September 2009. Examined by Meghnad Desai (London School of Economics) and Anthony McGrew (University of Southampton), among the LSE academics acknowledged in the thesis as directly assisting with it were Nancy Cartwright, David Held and Alex Voorhoeve (the son of former Dutch minister Joris Voorhoeve). Professor Joseph Nye of Harvard University is also thanked for having read portions of the manuscript and providing advice and direction.Desai, Meghnad (2011) LSE is paying a heavy price for Saif Gaddafi's PhD: When it comes to Saif Gaddafi and his PhD, hindsight is indeed a wonderful thing, The Guardian, Friday 4 March 2011Alqadhafi, Saif Al-Islam (2008) The role of civil society in the democratisation of global governance institutions: from \\"soft power\\" to collective decision-making? A thesis submitted to the Department of Philosophy of the London School of Economics for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy, London, September 2007, and published 2008, p.4. Furthermore, allegations abound that Saif's thesis was in many parts ghost-written by consultants from Monitor Group, which earned $3 million per year in fees from Muammar Gaddafi. Speaking in Sabha on 20 August 2008, Gaddafi said that he would no longer involve himself in state affairs. He noted that he had previously \\"intervene[d] due to the absence of institutions\\",\\"Qaddafi's son declares he's leaving politics\\", Associated Press (International Herald Tribune), 22 August 2008. but said that he would no longer do so. He dismissed any potential suggestion that this decision was due to disagreement with his father, saying that they were on good terms. He also called for political reforms within the context of the Jamahiriya system and rejected the notion that he could succeed his father, saying that \\"this is not a farm to inherit\\". =Charity and social affairs= Gaddafi was the president of the Libyan National Association for Drugs and Narcotics Control (DNAG). In 1998, he founded the official charity, the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations, which intervened in various hostage situations involving Islamic militants and the crisis of the HIV trial in Libya and the resulting European Union-Libyan rapprochement. In 2009, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch were allowed entry to Libya, via Gaddafi's non-profit organization in order to gather facts about the human rights situation in Libya. While AI and HRW reported that there were concerns about the \\"repressive atmosphere,\\" both felt there were signs of \\"improvement\\" and HRW said that one should not \\"underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far\\" by Gaddafi in the realm of human rights in Libya. In December 2010, Gaddafi announced that his charity foundation \\"will no longer be involved in promoting human rights and political change in the North African country,\\" and that instead, it \\"will focus on its 'core charitable mission' of delivering aid and relief to sub- Saharan Africa.\\" International diplomacy Gaddafi was instrumental in negotiations that led to Libya's abandoning a weapons of mass destruction programme in 2002–2003. He arranged several important business deals on behalf of the Libyan regime in the period of rapprochement that followed. He was viewed as a reformer, and openly criticised the regime: In 2003, he published a report critical of Libya's record on human rights. On 10 December 2004, shortly before a trip by Canadian Prime Minister Paul Martin to Tripoli, in an interview with The Globe and Mail Gaddafi requested a formal apology from the Canadian government, for joining U.S.-led sanctions against Libya after the Lockerbie bombing, and for denying him a student visa to study in Canada in 1997. His request was met with incredulity in Canada, and the Canadian government announced that no apology would be forthcoming. =HIV trial= Gaddafi played an important role in the HIV trial in Libya. At first he rejected information the medics were tortured. \\"During this time we saw Gaddafi's son on a television broadcast categorically denying that Libya still tortured suspected criminals\\", claimed Valya Chervianashka, one of the accused nurses in her autobiography. Later he admitted in interviews that the Bulgarian nurses, charged with conspiring to deliberately infect over 400 children with HIV in 1998, had been tortured and that the government had denied them a fair trial. His admissions were said to have badly damaged his reputation in Libya. The torture process is confirmed and described in details in the book Notes from Hell, co-written by one of the nurses, Valya Chervianashka. Saif al-Islam was mentioned several times in the book. According to her: > One day, the executive director of Muammar al-Gaddafi's son's foundation, > the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations (GICDF), > arrived at the prison, inviting us to the director's office of the women's > wing for a meeting. We were in our pyjamas, dishevelled and unprepared. We > hastily put on some clothes and hurried to meet the director. A Libyan man > along with Ambassador Lyudmil Spassov and Roumen Petrov waited for us > outside the office. The Ambassador told us, \\"This is a very important > person. He will help you; he is on your side.\\" Saleh Abdel Salam, executive > director of GICDF, was intimidating. We didn't realise it then, but this > Libyan man would indeed help us in the future. =Isratine proposal= Saif introduced the Isratine proposal to permanently resolve the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through a secular, federalist, republican one-state solution. =Philippine peace process= Gaddafi served as Chairman of the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charitable Associations. In this role, he was involved in a number of humanitarian initiatives. Notably, he hosted peace talks between the Government of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front in Tripoli.Agreement on Peace between the Government of the Republic of the Philippines and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front dated 2 June 2001 In the resulting peace agreement concluded on 22 June 2001, Gaddafi was expressly thanked for his involvement. He was also the witness to the signing of the peace agreement. The peace agreement forms a part of the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro concluded in 2014.Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro =2008 agreement with Italy= Gaddafi was involved in negotiating compensation from Libya's former colonial power, Italy, and on 30 August 2008 a Friendship, Partnership and Cooperation Agreement was signed in Benghazi by his father and Italy's prime minister Silvio Berlusconi. VOA: Italy to Pay $5 Billion to Libya in Landmark Accord, 30 August 2008, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Italy. However, the treaty was unilaterally suspended by Italy at the beginning of 2011, after Italy refused to consider Gaddafi government as their interlocutor. =Compensation for American terror victims= He was also negotiating with the United States in order to conclude a comprehensive agreement making any further payments for American victims of terror attacks that have been blamed on Libya – such as the 1986 Berlin discotheque bombing, the 1988 Lockerbie bombing and the 1989 UTA Flight 772 bombing – conditional upon U.S. payment of compensation for the 40 Libyans killed and 220 injured in the 1986 United States bombing of Tripoli and Benghazi. On 14 August 2008, the U.S.-Libya Comprehensive Claims Settlement Agreement was signed in Tripoli. Former British Ambassador to Libya Oliver Miles described the agreement as \\"a bold step, with political cost for both parties\\" and wrote an article in the online edition of The Guardian querying whether the agreement is likely to work. In an August 2008 BBC TV interview, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi said that Libya had admitted responsibility (but not \\"guilt\\") for the Lockerbie bombing simply to get trade sanctions removed. He further admitted that Libya was being \\"hypocritical\\" and was \\"playing on words\\", but said Libya had no other choice on the matter. According to Gaddafi, a letter admitting \\"responsibility\\" was the only way to end the economic sanctions imposed on Libya. When asked about the $10m (£5.3m) compensation that Libya was paying to each victims' family, he again repeated that Libya was doing so because it had no other choice. He went on to describe the families of the Lockerbie victims as \\"trading with the blood of their sons and daughters\\" and being very \\"greedy\\", saying, \\"They were asking for more money and more money and more money\\". =Diplomacy for extraditing Libyans= Interviewed by French newspaper Le Figaro on 7 December 2007, Gaddafi said that the seven Libyans convicted for the Pan Am Flight 103 and the UTA Flight 772 bombings \\"are innocent\\". Seif el-Islam Kadhafi : \\"La Libye sera un pays heureux\\", Le Figaro, 7 December 2007. When asked if Libya would therefore seek reimbursement of the compensation paid to the families of the victims (US$2.33 billion), Gaddafi replied: \\"I don't know.\\" Gaddafi led negotiations with Britain for the release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, the convicted Pan Am 103 conspirator. In 2007, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi met with French President Nicolas Sarkozy in Tripoli, with whom it is alleged he helped broker an arms deal, including missiles.\\"Sarkozy denies weapons deals to Libya\\", Jerusalem Post. 4 August 2007. Retrieved 27 February 2011.\\"EADS confirms it is selling military equipment to Libya\\", New York Times. 3 August 2007. Retrieved 27 February 2011.\\"Profile: Colonel Gaddafi's son Saif al- Islam\\", The Telegraph. 22 August 2009. Retrieved 27 February 2011. In November 2008, Gaddafi made a high-profile visit to the United States where he met with US Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice. During the meeting, Rice raised the case of Libya's jailed political dissident and democracy activist, Fathi El- Jahmi. In a Forbes article in 2009, Fathi's brother wrote that \\"for nearly a year, both Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch hesitated to advocate publicly for Fathi's case, because they feared their case workers might lose access to Libyan visas.\\" In 2009, Saif al-Islam welcomed Sarah Leah Whitson, director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East division, into Libya, accompanying her in meeting with many government officials and others during her visit. She wrote of her official visit that \\"the real impetus for the transformation rests squarely with a quasi-governmental organization, the Qaddafi Foundation for International Charities and Development\\" chaired by Gaddafi. She praised Gaddafi for establishing the country's two semi-private newspapers, and said \\"it is impossible to underestimate the importance of the efforts made so far. Let's hope this spring will last.\\" =Stand-off with US officials= In 2009, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi claimed that Libya's opinion of him was shaped largely by his role in Libya's engagement with the West, saying \\"If something goes wrong, people will blame me, whether I am in a certain official position or not.\\" He expressed frustration with the US, saying Libya's decision to give up its Weapons of Mass Destruction programs was contingent upon \\"compensation\\" from the US, including the signing of the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement, economic cooperation, and cooperation in purchasing conventional weapons and military equipment. He stated, \\"We share rich natural resources – oil and gas – along the borders, yet we have no capacity to defend that wealth.\\" Because of a US legal embargo, Libya cannot purchase weapons from the United States, Sweden, or Germany, and has been disallowed from buying \\"Tiger\\" vehicles with American-manufactured engines from Jordan. He asked for greater military assistance, as Libya had committed itself to destroying chemical stockpiles, but would require at least $25 million to do so. Gaddafi said the United States had \\"humiliated\\" his father during his visit to New York in 2009, and said that his father's tent and residence issues were disappointing and his UN speech had been misinterpreted. Gaddafi said that his father was barred from visiting Ground Zero, which also frustrated him. Gaddafi held a standoff with US officials in November 2009, refusing to send a shipment of Highly Enriched Uranium back to Russia unless the United States renewed its commitment to cooperation with Libya. Libyan civil war =Activities= On 19 February, several days after the conflict began, Saif al-Islam announced the creation of a commission of inquiry into the violence, chaired by a Libyan judge, as reported on state television. He stated that the commission was intended to be \\"for members of Libyan and foreign organizations of human rights\\" and that it would \\"investigate the circumstances and events that have caused many victims.\\" (Translation) Later in the month, he went on state television to deny allegations that the government had launched airstrikes against Libyan cities and stated that the number of protesters killed had been exaggerated. On 20 February 2011, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi delivered an address to the nation on Libyan state television stating that if no agreement could be found between protesters and the government \\"thousands of deaths, and rivers of blood will run through Libya\\". He also insisted that his father remained in charge with the army's backing and would \\"fight until the last man, the last woman, the last bullet.\\" Speaking on Libyan state TV, Saif al-Islam blamed the civil war on tribal factions and Islamists acting on their own agendas, drunken and drugged. He promised reforms, and said the alternative would be civil war blocking trade and oil money and leading to the country being taken over by foreigners.Gaddafi's son talks of conspiracy, Al Jazeera, 20 February 2011. He closed by saying, \\"We will not let Al Jazeera, Al Arabiya and BBC trick us.\\" Oliver Miles, a former British Ambassador to Libya, disagreed with his assessment.How will Libya's protests play out?, Oliver Miles, The Guardian, 20 February 2011.Libya on brink as protests hit Tripoli, Ian Black, The Guardian, 21 February 2011. In an interview with ABC News reporter Christiane Amanpour, Saif al-Islam denied that his father's regime was killing civilians.'This Week' Transcript: Saif al-Islam and Saadi Gadhafi, ABC News. In June 2011, Saif al-Islam and his father, Muammar, announced that they were willing to hold elections and that Muammar Gaddafi would step aside if he lost. Saif al- Islam stated that the elections could be held within three months and transparency would be guaranteed through international observers. NATO and the rebels rejected the offer, and NATO soon resumed their bombardment of Tripoli. On 27 June, an arrest warrant was issued by the ICC. On 1 July, Saif al-Islam had an interview with Russia Today, where he denied the ICC's allegations that he, or his father, ordered the killing of civilian protesters. He pointed out that he was not a member of the government or the military, and therefore had no authority to give such orders. According to Saif al-Islam, he made recorded calls to General Abdul Fatah Younis, who later defected to the rebel forces, requesting him not to use force against protesters, to which Younis responded that the protestors were attacking a military site, where surprised guards fired in self-defence. Saif al-Islam condemned NATO for bombing Libyan civilians, including his family members and their children, under the false pretence that their homes were military bases. He stated that NATO offered to drop the ICC charges against him and his father if they accept a secret deal, an offer they rejected. He thus criticised the ICC as \\"a fake court\\" controlled by NATO member states. In August, Saif al-Islam gave an interview to the New York Times stating that Libya was becoming more closely aligned to Islamists and would likely resemble Iran or Saudi Arabia. Saif al-Islam said that his father was working closely with Islamists within the rebellion to splinter the resistance. On 21 August, the National Transitional Council claimed that Saif al-Islam was arrested by the National Liberation Army, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court. However, on the early morning of 23 August, Saif al-Islam was seen by Western journalists apparently moving around under his own free will outside the Rixos Hotel. After the fall of Tripoli, Saif al-Islam went to Bani Walid.{بني وليد} His brother, Al-Saadi contacted CNN, stating that he had the authority to negotiate on behalf of loyalist forces, and wished to discuss a ceasefire. On 5 September, Al-Saadi said in an interview with CNN that an \\"aggressive\\" speech by his brother Saif al-Islam had led to the breakdown of the negotiations between NTC forces and Gaddafi loyalists in Bani Walid. Saif al- Islam stayed in Bani Walid until the town was captured by NTC forces. On 17 October, after leaving Bani Walid, his convoy was hit by a NATO air attack at Wadi Zamzam where he lost 26 of his supporters and 9 military vehicles. His right hand was wounded and according to his own explanation it happened during the NATO air strike. According to the Libyan Al Mashhad Al Leebi program, the fingers of his right hand were cut off. =Capture= With the death of Muammar and Mutassim Gaddafi in Sirte on 20 October 2011, Saif al-Islam was the only member of the Gaddafi family left in Libya. He appeared on Syrian pro-Gaddafi television on 22 October claiming \\"I am in Libya, I am alive and free and willing to fight to the end and take revenge\\", but his whereabouts were unknown and subject to many rumours. An international team of lawyers representing the interests of Saif al-Islam wrote to US leaders demanding that he be protected from assassination and holding the United States and NATO responsible for the Libyan leader's \\"brutal assassination\\" and repeated attacks on Libya's civilian population. On 19 November 2011, as Saif al-Islam was trying to flee from Libya, he and four aides were captured, and detained about west of the town of Ubari near Sabha in southern Libya, from Tripoli. Sources say that it was the betrayal by a Libyan nomad, Yussef Saleh al- Hotmani, that finally led to his capture. Yussef Saleh al-Hotmani told the interviewers that he was hired to guide a man to Niger and that he was offered €1 million for the job. Being offered such a huge sum of money, he suspected foul play as Saif's agent did not tell him whom he was going to guide. He contacted the rebel fighters and told them where a two vehicle convoy would pass through southern Libya on the night of 18 November and this allowed the rebel fighters to ambush the convoy. Saif was taken to Zintan by plane and, pending trial, he was kept in detention by the Zintan-militia that captured him. =Criminal charges and trials= Based on his outstanding warrant the International Criminal Court (ICC) asked the new government about Saif al- Islam Gaddafi's detention. The new government was unable or unwilling to comply with the ICC's information requests regarding Saif al-Islam. New deadlines for information requests from the ICC were also missed. A brief filed by the Office of Public Counsel for the Defence on behalf of Gaddafi claimed that \\"there is no basis for asserting that the ICC should defer the case to Libya\\". The brief requested the court to order Libya to immediately implement Gaddafi's rights, and report Libya to the Security Council if it does not. In August 2012, the Libyan government announced that Saif al-Islam would stand trial in the western Libyan town of Zintan, in September 2012. However, the trial was subsequently delayed. On 17 January 2013, Saif al-Islam appeared in court in Zintan. However, trial was again delayed, and it wasn't until April 2014 that Saif al-Islam Gaddafi appeared in court in Tripoli, via video link for security reasons. Libya appealed his extradition to the Hague Court (ICC), but the court affirmed the indictments. The court held that the Libyan government failed to show that Saif al-Islam faced the same charges in Libya as he did in the ICC. On 28 July 2015, Saif al-Islam Gaddafi was sentenced to death in absentia for war crimes by the \\"self-declared government\\" in Tripoli, Libya (he was being held in Zintan, not where the trial was held). However, the Zintan authorities have consistently refused to either hand him over to the Tripoli authorities or to implement their sentence. The trial and the sentence have been criticised by the United Nations human rights office (OHCHR) and by Human Rights Watch. In July 2016, one of his lawyers Karim Khan claimed that his client had been freed on 12 April of that year and transferred to a secret location after the government quashed his sentence, and that he would petition the ICC to drop all charges against him. A Zintan military source denied that he had been released. In May 2017 Saif al-Islam survived an assassination attempt in Zintan by local militias. =Release and ICC arrest warrant= On 10 June 2017, Saif al-Islam was released from prison in Zintan, according to a statement from Abu Bakr al- Siddiq Battalion. The militia chose not to transfer him to the custody of the International Criminal Court, saying \\"We are not concerned with the international tribunal as the ICC did not ask us to hand him over\\". The UN- backed Libyan government based in Tripoli condemned his release while an ICC prosecutor was still trying to verify the release, and called on Libya and other states to arrest and surrender him, stating \\"Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr Gaddafi [...] regardless of any purported amnesty law.\\" In May 2018, the ICC reminded Libyan authorities of the arrest warrant issued against Saif al-Islam, calling for him to be arrested and transferred to the custody of the ICC. The ICC also called for \\"credible information\\" that could lead to finding his location. 2021 presidential run Gaddafi announced on 22 March 2018 from Tunis that he will run for the post of president in the next Libyan general election under the Popular Front for the Liberation of Libya (PFLL). Ayman Abu Ras, a spokesperson for the party, said that Gaddafi wished to focus on a programme of \\"reform\\" focused on reconstruction projects that would benefit all Libyans. Personal life In 2006, the German newspaper Der Spiegel and the Spanish newspaper La Voz de Galicia reported that Saif al-Islam was romantically linked to Orly Weinerman, an Israeli actress and model, they dated from 2005-2011. At the time, Weinerman publicly denied having any contact with Saif al-Islam, but she has since admitted it, and in September 2012, she asked former British Prime Minister Tony Blair to intervene in his trial in order to spare his life. In 2009, a party in Montenegro for his 37th birthday included well-known guests such as Oleg Deripaska, Peter Munk and Prince Albert of Monaco.Milo with billionaires at Saif Gadaffi's birthday party, Visit Montenegro, 28 June 2009. =British society= In the 2000s, Saif al-Islam was hosted at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle by the British royal family.\\"Saif al-Islam Gaddafi: The new face of Libyan defiance\\", Jamie Doward.

Through the Gaddafi International Charity and Development Foundation (GICDF), Saif pledged a donation of £1.5 million to support the work of the LSE's Centre for the Study of Global Governance on civil society organisations in North Africa. Following the LSE Libya Links affair, the LSE issued a statement indicating that it would cut all financial ties with the country and would accept no further money from the GICDF, having already received and spent the first £300,000 instalment of the donation.Statement on Libya, London School of Economics, February 2011.

It must be understood that by \\"any geometric construction\\", we are referring to figures that contain no straight lines, as it is clearly impossible to draw a straight line without a straightedge. It is understood that a line is determined provided that two distinct points on that line are given or constructed, even though no visual representation of the line will be present. The theorem can be stated more precisely as: : Any Euclidean construction, insofar as the given and required elements are points, may be completed with the compass alone if it can be completed with both the compass and the straightedge together. Though the use of a straightedge can make a construction significantly easier, the theorem shows that any set of points that fully defines a constructed figure can be determined with compass alone, and the only reason to use a straightedge is for the aesthetics of seeing straight lines, which for the purposes of construction is functionally unnecessary.  History  The result was originally published by Georg Mohr in 1672,Georg Mohr, Euclides Danicus (Amsterdam: Jacob van Velsen, 1672). but his proof languished in obscurity until 1928.Hjelmslev, J. (1928) \\"Om et af den danske matematiker Georg Mohr udgivet skrift Euclides Danicus, udkommet i Amsterdam i 1672\\" [Of a memoir Euclides Danicus published by the Danish mathematician Georg Mohr in 1672 in Amsterdam], Matematisk Tidsskrift B , pages 1–7.Schogt, J. H. (1938) \\"Om Georg Mohr's Euclides Danicus,\\" Matematisk Tidsskrift A , pages 34–36. The theorem was independently discovered by Lorenzo Mascheroni in 1797 and it was known as Mascheroni's Theorem until Mohr's work was rediscovered.Lorenzo Mascheroni, La Geometria del Compasso (Pavia: Pietro Galeazzi, 1797). 1901 edition. Motivated by Mascheroni's result, in 1822 Jean Victor Poncelet conjectured a variation on the same theme. He proposed that any construction possible by straightedge and compass could be done with straightedge alone. The one stipulation though is that a single circle with its center identified must be provided. The Poncelet- Steiner theorem was proved by Jakob Steiner eleven years later. This was a generalization of the proofs given by Ferrari and Cardano and several others in the 16th century where they demonstrated that all the constructions appearing in Euclid's Elements were possible with a straightedge and a \\"rusty\\" (fixed-width) compass. Constructive proof approach To prove the theorem, each of the basic constructions of compass and straightedge need to be proven to be possible by using a compass alone, as these are the foundations of, or elementary steps for, all other constructions. These are: #Creating the line through two existing points #Creating the circle through one point with centre another point #Creating the point which is the intersection of two existing, non-parallel lines #Creating the one or two points in the intersection of a line and a circle (if they intersect) #Creating the one or two points in the intersection of two circles (if they intersect). #1 - A line through two points It is understood that a straight line cannot be drawn without a straightedge. A line is considered to be given by any two points, as any two points define a line uniquely, and a unique line can be defined by any two points on it. In keeping with the intent of the theorem which we aim to prove, the actual line need not be drawn but for aesthetic reasons. This fact will be shown when all other constructions involving the line are proven. #2 - A circle through one point with defined center This can be done with compass alone quite naturally; it is the very purpose for which compasses are meant. There is nothing to prove. Any doubts about this construction would equally apply to traditional constructions that do involve a straightedge. #5 - Intersection of two circles This construction can be done directly with a compass provided the centers and radii of the two circles are known. Due to the compass-only construction of the center of a circle (given below), it can always be assumed that any circle is described by its center and radius. Indeed, some authors include this in their descriptions of the basic constructions. #3, #4 - The other constructions Thus, to prove the theorem, there only compass-only constructions for #3 and #4 need to be given. = Alternative proofs = Several proofs of the result are known. Mascheroni's proof of 1797 was generally based on the idea of using reflection in a line as the major tool. Mohr's solution was different. In 1890, August Adler published a proof using the inversion transformation. An algebraic approach uses the isomorphism between the Euclidean plane and the real coordinate space mathbb{R}^2. This approach can be used to provide a stronger version of the theorem.Arnon Avron, \\"On strict strong constructibility with a compass alone\\", Journal of Geometry (1990) 38: 12. It also shows the dependence of the theorem on Archimedes' axiom (which cannot be formulated in a first-order language).  Constructive proof  The following notation will be used throughout this article. A circle whose center is located at point and that passes through point will be denoted by . A circle with center and radius specified by a number, , or a line segment will be denoted by or , respectively. In general constructions there are often several variations that will produce the same result. The choices made in such a variant can be made without loss of generality. However, when a construction is being used to prove that something can be done, it is not necessary to describe all these various choices and, for the sake of clarity of exposition, only one variant will be given below. However, many constructions come in different forms depending on whether or not they use circle inversion and these alternatives will be given if possible. = Some preliminary constructions = To prove the above constructions #3 and #4, which are included below, a few necessary intermediary constructions are also explained below since they are used and referenced frequently. These are also compass-only constructions. All constructions below rely on #1,#2,#5, and any other construction that is listed prior to it.  Compass equivalence theorem (circle translation)  The ability to translate, or copy, a circle to a new center is vital in these proofs and fundamental to establishing the veracity of the theorem. The creation of a new circle with the same radius as the first, but centered at a different point, is the key feature distinguishing the collapsing compass from the modern, rigid compass. The equivalence of a collapsing compass and a rigid compass was proved by Euclid (Book I Proposition 2 of The Elements) using straightedge and collapsing compass when he, essentially, constructs a copy of a circle with a different center. This equivalence can also be established with compass alone, a proof of which can be found in the main article.  Reflecting a point across a line  Point symmetry * Given a line segment and a point not on the line determined by that segment, construct the image of upon reflection across this line. # Construct two circles: one centered at and one centered at , both passing through . # , the other point of intersection of the two circles, is the reflection of across the line . If (that is, there is a unique point of intersection of the two circles), then lies on the line and equals its own reflection (contrary to the assumption). Extending the length of a line segment A compass-only construction of doubling the length of segment AB *Given a line segment find a point on the line such that is the midpoint of line segment . # Construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆ABD is an equilateral triangle.) # Construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆DBE is an equilateral triangle.) # Finally, construct point as the intersection of circles and . (∆EBC is an equilateral triangle, and the three angles at show that are collinear.) This construction can be repeated as often as necessary to find a point so that the length of line segment = ⋅ length of line segment for any positive integer .  Inversion in a circle  Point inversion in a circle * Given a circle , for some radius (in black) and a point construct the point that is the inverse of in the circle. Naturally there is no inversion for a point D=B. # Draw a circle (in red). # Assume that the red circle intersects the black circle at and #*if the circles do not intersect in two points see below for an alternative construction. #*if the circles intersect in only one point, E=E', it is possible to invert D simply by doubling the length of EB (quadrupling the length of DB). # Reflect the circle center B across the line EE': ## Construct two new circles and (in light blue). ## The light blue circles intersect at and at another point . # Point is the desired inverse of in the black circle. Point is such that the radius of is to as is to the radius; or . In the event that the above construction fails (that is, the red circle and the black circle do not intersect in two points), find a point on the line so that the length of line segment is a positive integral multiple, say , of the length of and is greater than (this is possible by Archimede's axiom). Find the inverse of in circle as above (the red and black circles must now intersect in two points). The point is now obtained by extending so that = . Determining the center of a circle through three points Compass-only construction of the center of a circle through three points (A,B,C) * Given three non-collinear points , and , find the center of the circle they determine. # Construct point , the inverse of in the circle . # Reflect in the line to the point . # is the inverse of in the circle . = Intersection of two non-parallel lines (construction #3)= Compass-only construction of the intersection of two lines (not all construction steps shown) * Given non- parallel lines and , find their point of intersection, . # Select circle of arbitrary radius whose center does not lie on either line. # Invert points and in circle to points and respectively. # The line is inverted to the circle passing through , and .

Find the center of this circle. # Let be the intersection of circles and . # is the inverse of in the circle . = Intersection of a line and a circle (construction #4)= The compass-only construction of the intersection points of a line and a circle breaks into two cases depending upon whether the center of the circle is or is not collinear with the line.  Circle center is not collinear with the line Assume that center of the circle does not lie on the line. Line-circle intersection (non-collinear case) *Given a circle (in black) and a line . We wish to construct the points of intersection, and , between them (if they exist). #Construct the point , which is the reflection of point across line . (See above.) #* Under the assumption of this case, . #Construct a circle (in red).

Find the center of this circle. # and are the intersection points of circles and .Pedoe carries out one more inversion at this point, but the points and are on the circle of inversion and so are invariant under this last unneeded inversion.  Circle center is collinear with the line  Compass only construction of intersection of a circle and a line (circle center on line) * Given the circle whose center lies on the line , find the points and , the intersection points of the circle and the line. # Construct point as the other intersection of circles and . # Construct point as the intersection of circles and . ( is the fourth vertex of parallelogram .) # Construct point as the intersection of circles and . ( is the fourth vertex of parallelogram .) # Construct point as an intersection of circles and . ( lies on .) # Points and are the intersections of circles and . Thus it has been shown that all of the basic construction one can perform with a straightedge and compass can be done with a compass alone, provided that it is understood that a line cannot be literally drawn but merely defined by two points.

In The Evitable Conflict the machines generalize the First Law to mean: # \\"No machine may harm humanity; or, through inaction, allow humanity to come to harm.\\" This was refined in the end of Foundation and Earth, a zeroth law was introduced, with the original three suitably rewritten as subordinate to it: :0.

EPSRC / AHRC principles of robotics  In 2011, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) of United Kingdom jointly published a set of five ethical \\"principles for designers, builders and users of robots\\" in the real world, along with seven \\"high-level messages\\" intended to be conveyed, based on a September 2010 research workshop: # Robots should not be designed solely or primarily to kill or harm humans. # Humans, not robots, are responsible agents. Robots are tools designed to achieve human goals. # Robots should be designed in ways that assure their safety and security. # Robots are artifacts; they should not be designed to exploit vulnerable users by evoking an emotional response or dependency. It should always be possible to tell a robot from a human. # It should always be possible to find out who is legally responsible for a robot. The messages intended to be conveyed were: # We believe robots have the potential to provide immense positive impact to society. We want to encourage responsible robot research. # Bad practice hurts us all. # Addressing obvious public concerns will help us all make progress. # It is important to demonstrate that we, as roboticists, are committed to the best possible standards of practice. # To understand the context and consequences of our research, we should work with experts from other disciplines, including: social sciences, law, philosophy and the arts. # We should consider the ethics of transparency: are there limits to what should be openly available? # When we see erroneous accounts in the press, we commit to take the time to contact the reporting journalists. The EPSRC principles are broadly recognised as a useful starting point. In 2016 Tony Prescott organised workshop to revise these principles, e.g. to differentiate ethical from legal principles. Judicial development Another comprehensive terminological codification for the legal assessment of the technological developments in the robotics industry has already begun mainly in Asian countries.bcc.co.uk: Robot age poses ethical dilemma. Link This progress represents a contemporary reinterpretation of the law (and ethics) in the field of robotics, an interpretation that assumes a rethinking of traditional legal constellations. These include primarily legal liability issues in civil and criminal law.  Satya Nadella's laws  In June 2016, Satya Nadella, a CEO of Microsoft Corporation at the time, had an interview with the Slate magazine and roughly sketched five rules for artificial intelligences to be observed by their designers: # \\"A.I. must be designed to assist humanity\\" meaning human autonomy needs to be respected. # \\"A.I. must be transparent\\" meaning that humans should know and be able to understand how they work. # \\"A.I. must maximize efficiencies without destroying the dignity of people\\". # \\"A.I. must be designed for intelligent privacy\\" meaning that it earns trust through guarding their information. # \\"A.I. must have algorithmic accountability so that humans can undo unintended harm\\". # \\"A.I. must guard against bias\\" so that they must not discriminate against people. Tilden's \\"Laws of Robotics\\"  Mark W. Tilden is a robotics physicist who was a pioneer in developing simple robotics. His three guiding principles/rules for robots are:Ashley Dunn. \\"Machine Intelligence, Part II: From Bumper Cars to Electronic Minds\\" The New York Times 5 June 1996. Retrieved 26 July 2009.makezine.com: A Beginner's Guide to BEAM (Most of the article is subscription-only content.) # A robot must protect its existence at all costs. # A robot must obtain and maintain access to its own power source. # A robot must continually search for better power sources. What is notable in these three rules is that these are basically rules for \\"wild\\" life, so in essence what Tilden stated is that what he wanted was \\"proctoring a silicon species into sentience, but with full control over the specs. Not plant. Not animal.

Like its 2000 predecessor Icewind Dale, the game is set in the Forgotten Realms fantasy setting in the Icewind Dale region. The player assumes control of a group of mercenaries in a war between the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale and a coalition of persecuted races and religions. The game is designed as an action-oriented alternative to other Infinity Engine games, with less emphasis on exploration and story. It uses a real-time adaptation of the Dungeons & Dragons (D&D;) Third Edition ruleset. The Infinity Engine was modified to comply with the Third Edition, but the team was forced to remove certain rules because of the engine's outdated nature. It was the final game to be developed using the Infinity Engine. The game was well received by critics, who praised its combat, pacing, and use of the Third Edition rules. However, some reviewers felt that the graphics and engine had become outdated, and could not compete with its contemporaries. Gameplay Icewind Dale II is a real-time adaptation of the D&D; Third Edition ruleset. The game is viewed from an isometric perspective, and a head-up display (HUD) occupies the bottom of the screen. Accessible from the HUD are an automap and a journal that records quests and important events. The player uses a point-and-click interface to interact with the game; for example, clicking on the ground moves the selected player character, and clicking on a passive non-player character (NPC) will initiate dialogue. When conversations occur, the game presents multiple dialogue options. The game world is separated into area maps—obscured by fog of war—that are revealed as the area is explored. A multiplayer mode is available for up to six players over a local area network or the Internet. The \\"Heart of Fury\\" mode is also available, which increases the game's difficulty and contains more powerful items. The game features over seven hundred items; the designers included a system that randomizes the items the player obtains from enemies. Example of the main screen. When beginning the game, the player may choose to play a pre-selected party, or to create a party of up to six characters; unlike the Baldur's Gate series, Icewind Dale II does not permit the player to import characters from previous Icewind Dale games. While creating characters, the player chooses their gender, race, class, alignment, and attributes, among other things. The player can sometimes choose a subvariety of a race or class, such as Deep Gnome or Cleric of Ilmater. Race, alignment, and attributes affect the player character's available dialogue options, as well as NPC responses. For example, some NPCs will be prejudiced against certain races, or a character of low intelligence will have limited dialogue options. Some sub-races in the game are significantly more powerful than the core races present in D&D; Third Edition; these sub-races must earn more experience points than others before leveling up. Characters can reach a maximum level of thirty. It is possible to add additional characters to the party at any time, including during combat. Icewind Dale IIs gameplay is focused on combat. The combat system is a real-time adaptation of the turn- based system used in D&D; Third Edition, which caused the developers to remove certain aspects, such as \\"attacks of opportunity\\". Dice rolls are simulated by the game. In place of the turn-based rounds used in D&D;, characters have independent rounds, during which they may execute one or more actions, depending on such factors as the duration of the action. The player can pause the game and issue orders to characters at any time. Each character can carry a limited amount of items. Plot =Setting= Icewind Dale II takes place in the Forgotten Realms D&D; campaign setting, on the continent of Faerûn. It centers on the northern Icewind Dale region, and is set thirty years after the original game. The game begins in the harbor town of Targos, one of the Ten Towns of Icewind Dale, which is under siege by a goblin army. The goblins are directed by the Legion of the Chimera, an army composed of outcast races and religious factions, such as goblinoids, half-breeds, and followers of winter goddess Auril. Targos hires mercenaries to defend against the attack. Areas encountered in the game include: the Black Raven Monastery, built over an entrance to the Underdark; the town of Kuldahar, constructed around a magical tree that emits heat; the Severed Hand, an ancient elven fortress that was lost during a war with goblinoids; and the Dragon's Eye, a network of volcanic caverns inhabited by yuan-ti. Other areas include the Underdark and the Jungles of Chult. =Story= The game begins as the player's group of mercenaries arrives by ship to defend Targos. They report to the town palisade and fend off an assault by the goblin army. Afterwards, the mayor of Targos orders them to start an offensive on the goblin army. The group kills the chieftain of the army, and discovers that he was under the command of a woman named Sherincal. When they return to Targos, the mayor asks them to rendezvous with reinforcements from Neverwinter. The group travels to meet them in an airship piloted by Oswald Fiddlebender. A storm causes the ship to crash, and the group awakens to discover that a glacier blocks the reinforcements' path. While investigating the glacier, the group finds Sherincal, a half-dragon, guarding the entrance to an Aurilite temple. They learn that Sherincal leads the Legion of the Chimera's western forces, and that the leaders of the Legion of the Chimera, cambion twins named Isair and Madae, reside in the Severed Hand. Inside the Aurilite temple, the group finds a prisoner from Kuldahar, who asks them to warn Kuldahar of the threat posed by the Legion of the Chimera. After this, the group creates a passage through the glacier, and meets with the reinforcements. As the group travels to Kuldahar, they meet a drow (dark elf) named Nym, who tells them that the pass to Kuldahar is guarded by the Legion of the Chimera, and that an alternate path through the Underdark exists. Later, Isair and Madae locate the group with information from Nym. They state their intention to attack Kuldahar, and warn the group to not interfere. The group then passes through the Black Raven Monastery to enter the Underdark. After exiting the Underdark, they are flown to Kuldahar by Oswald Fiddlebender. When the group lands in Kuldahar, they discover it has been invaded by the Legion of the Chimera. They meet the Archdruid of Kuldahar, who tells them that a portal has been opened to allow yuan-ti from the Jungles of Chult to assault Kuldahar. After the group prevents the attack, the Archdruid tells them that they may reach the Severed Hand through an exit at the bottom floor of the Dragon's Eye. The group travels through Dragon's Eye, and proceeds to the Severed Hand. Once inside, they learn that the war between the Ten Towns and the Legion of the Chimera was caused by the mayor of Bryn Shander, who had sent Isair and Madae poisoned food. They also discover that a mythal that was cast on the Severed Hand has been corrupted, and the structure will be transported to the plane of limbo. Eventually, the group finds Isair and Madae, and kills them. Development During summer 2001, Black Isle Studios employed three development teams. These included the Icewind Dale team, the team developing Torn, and a team working on an unannounced project. Before and during Torns development, several members of its team expressed interest in developing another game using the Infinity Engine. The development team was not made aware of Black Isle Studios' decision to develop Icewind Dale II until Torns cancellation. Lead designer J. E. Sawyer described, \\"I don't know when the producers decided to make the game, but I was told that we were making the game when I learned that TORN was being cancelled ... on a Wednesday afternoon\\", and that Feargus Urquhart \\"asked me to work with Steve Bokkes to create a story and area overview by Thursday afternoon. Steve and I talked about it for the rest of the day. I went home that night and worked on the overviews until the next day. I came in and turned the docs in, and after the Friday division meeting, the project was in development.\\" During this period, Interplay Entertainment relied on Black Isle Studios' games to alleviate financial trouble, which put pressure to release games quickly. The decision to develop Icewind Dale II was based partly on the original Icewind Dales reception, and the development teams' ability to create a game with the Infinity Engine relatively quickly. Sawyer said of the decision, \\"In all honesty, the reasons for making Icewind Dale II have to do with limiting risks and maximizing our chances for a popular title.\\" Conceptualization of Icewind Dale II progressed during the development of the Icewind Dale expansions, and production began late July 2001, shortly after the completion of Icewind Dale: Trials of the Luremaster. After six months of development, Icewind Dale II was officially announced on February 4, 2002. Icewind Dale II was originally planned to be an incomplete conversion to the D&D; Third Edition ruleset, with many rules omitted. The kit system (class specialization) introduced in Baldur's Gate 2 was to be used, but this idea was later abandoned. Sawyer and several other members of the team pushed for the game's conversion to Third Edition. The development team was eventually granted an extension, which allowed them to complete the change to Third Edition rules. The Infinity Engine required extensive modification to comply with Third Edition rules, as it had originally been designed for Second Edition rules; certain elements of the rules were removed due to interface and engine issues. The game's interface was redesigned, and all-new art was created. It features new item icons, with new spell icons by Brian Menze; Menze had previously created Planescape: Torments spell icons. Jason Manley, the portrait artist for the previous Icewind Dale games, left Black Isle Studios in late 2001; several new works he painted before his departure were later used in Icewind Dale II. Black Isle Studios artist Justin Sweet was asked to substitute. The game's resolution was increased to a minimum resolution of 800x600, with an unofficially supported maximum resolution of 2048x1536. J. E. Sawyer managed rule implementation, but the areas of the game were divided between designers. For example, designer Chris Avellone created the opening sequence, designer Dave Maldonado developed the Black Raven Monastery and a large area of wilderness, and designers John Deiley and Damien Foletto created the ending areas. Partway through development, Sawyer left the team to work as the lead designer on another internal project; Dave Maldonado and Chris Avellone were given his areas to finish. The developers wanted the game to contain more breaks from combat, with character interaction and puzzle solving, than the previous Icewind Dale. The decision to include more puzzles was influenced by the positive reception to the puzzles in Icewind Dale: Trials of the Luremaster. The game went gold on August 5, 2002, and was released on August 27. After the release of Icewind Dale II, Sawyer expressed dissatisfaction over the Icewind Dale series, saying that, \\"I wasn't particularly thrilled with how my work on [Icewind Dale] came out...\\" and, \\"...[Heart of Winter] managed to actually be worse than my Icewind Dale stuff.\\" In regards to Icewind Dale II he said, \\"[It] came out better than I expected, but still, not exactly awe-inspiring.\\" Chris Avellone later said, \\"Icewind Dale was a fun series, but it didn't try to set the bar for anything other than a fun romp. People may remember enjoying it, but it wasn’t trying to break any new ground or do anything revolutionary. In some respects, it was almost a step back from other games we'd done and focused more on exploration and dungeon crawls.\\" A Collector's Edition containing bonus material, such as a full-color cloth map and soundtrack CD, was also released. Icewind Dale II was the final game developed using the Infinity Engine. =Audio= The music of the game was composed by Inon Zur, whose previous works included Baldur's Gate 2: Throne of Bhaal and Fallout Tactics. Inon Zur worked with Jeremy Soule, the composer for Icewind Dale, to maintain the tone of the music. Inon Zur also worked closely with Interplay audio director Adam Levenson while composing the music; Zur and Levenson had worked together on several previous titles. Inon Zur said that while composing the theme for the game, \\"I wrote and rewrote the main theme several times\\", and \\"we tried to create a piece that would preserve the sound of the first Icewind Dale[...]we made great efforts to convey the new elements also. Capturing all of this in 30–45 seconds was not easy however I believe that we eventually found the right path for this game's soundtrack.\\" Zur described the composing process, \\"After learning the storyboard and getting additional insight from the producers/music supervisor I'll start to compose. The thematic idea (main melody or rhythmical groove) comes first. Then comes the accompaniment followed by the orchestration,\\" and that, \\"each piece should have its own unique flavour so every step is carefully examined. I have to make sure that the main idea of the piece is reflected in all these steps.\\" He called the composing experience \\"very pleasant and rewarding.\\" The music was composed in five weeks, and the recording and mixing lasted three weeks. As the game's music budget was low, a small Los Angeles orchestra was used to record the music; the sound of the each instrument was doubled during production. Inon Zur described the music as having \\"some uniqueness to it, that basically it developed throughout the game [with] the [inclusion] of more instruments, taking flutes and percussion and combining them with the standard orchestra.\\" Zur later said, \\"I thought that we definitely met some high standards; we compared our products to big budget films scores,\\" and, \\"in the end we were quite happy.\\" The game features voice work from Gabrielle Carteris, Peter Stormare, and Grey DeLisle, among others. Reception =Sales= Icewind Dale II debuted at #6 on The NPD Group's weekly computer game sales chart for the August 25–31 period, at an average retail price of $45. The game rose to fourth place the following week, and exited the weekly top 10 in its third week. It was North America's 20th-best-selling computer game of August 2002 and 14th-best-selling of September. Icewind Dale II sold between 100,000 and 270,000 copies in the United States alone by August 2006. Combined sales of the Icewind Dale franchise reached 580,000 units in the country by that date. =Critical reviews= Icewind Dale II reception was generally positive. Game Informer hailed it as, \\"one of the best RPGs ever released for the PC\\", and GameSpot called it, \\"simply a great role-playing game.\\" However, PC Format said, \\"it's uninspired and uninspiring, giving itself a narrow remit and fulfilling that unspectacularly.\\" Certain reviewers compared Icewind Dale II to Neverwinter Nights. IGN said, \\"[Compared to Neverwinter Nights] the pace of [Icewind Dale II] is more varied, its balance better, the gameplay more interesting,\\" and Game Informer considered the interface superior to that of Neverwinter Nights. PC Format said, \\"in the light of Neverwinter Nights in particular, there's little that stands out in Icewind Dale II to recommend it,\\" and PC Zone said, \\"it's not the [Baldur's Gate II: Shadows of Amn] killer we had all hoped for and neither does it stack up to Neverwinter Nights.\\" Many reviewers praised the game's combat and pacing. G4 called the game's combat \\"sublime\\", and said that \\"no Infinity Engine game thus far has had such interesting and intricate tactical combat.\\" GameSpot called it \\"expertly paced.\\" PC Zone complained that certain gameplay mechanics had become outdated, but that \\"the only real downer is the antiquated spell system and the inexplicable necessity to rest after every fight.\\" The game was also praised for its implementation of the Third Edition rules and interface. Computer Gaming World said that \\"[Icewind Dale II] has the Third Edition rules down, and in no other place in the game is it more apparent than with character development,\\" and PC Gamer said it had \\"a dazzling implementation of the D&D; 3rd Edition rules.\\" GameSpot called the interface \\"a big improvement on the spread-out interface of all previous Infinity Engine games\\", and IGN said that \\"the customization improvements to the interface that seem so natural, they make you wonder why they weren't thought of before.\\" Game Informer called the interface \\"absolutely inspired\\" and its inventory system \\"second to none.\\" The game was criticized for its graphics and engine, which reviewers considered to be outdated. G4 called the engine \\"old\\" and \\"clunky\\", and PC Format said that \\"the whole thing is limited by the creaking engine.\\" However, certain sources praised the engine. Game Informer called it \\"the best role-playing engine that has ever been invented\\", and GameSpot said that \\"'immortal' may be a better word to describe the engine, because the fact is, Icewind Dale II plays great.\\" In regards to the graphics, GameSpot said that \\"in many ways Icewind Dale II represents the best use of the Infinity Engine's prerendered, isometric settings to date, [but] that doesn't change the fact that Icewind Dale II generally looks dated.\\" IGN thought the sprites had become out-dated, and that \\"the animations are crude by today's standards.\\" New Straits Times agreed, saying that although some of the effects were attractive, the \\"dated Infinity Engine\\" could not compare to contemporaries Dungeon Siege and Neverwinter Nights. However, Computer Gaming World believed that \\"it consistently offers the same striking and imaginative environments that establish the tone and immersive charm of the game\\", and Computer Games Magazine said, \\"it may not look like much, but it's got it where it counts.\\" The game's pre-rendered backgrounds received praise. IGN said that \\"the artwork is attractive, both conceptually and in its final form\\", and Game Informer called them \\"beautiful\\". Many reviewers complained about the game's pathfinding AI, which PC Zone called \\"outrageously bad.\\" Game Informer called the writing and story \\"on par with any fantasy novel.\\" PC Gamer said it had \\"some of the richest and most enjoyable dialogue since Planescape Torment\\", and an \\"impressive storyline.\\" GameSpot called the story \\"engrossing\\", and said that \\"the game is very well written, offering up a number of strong characters and serious themes.\\" PC Zone noted that, \\"thanks to the excellent NPCs, the battles have a lot more meaning, as there is a strong storyline behind the endless hacking and slashing.\\" PC Format thought that \\"Icewind Dale II also suffers, like its predecessor, from a story irrevocably weakened by anonymous central characters – the six you create.\\" In regards to the audio, GameSpot said that \\"Inon Zur does a truly fantastic job that's perhaps even better than Soule's effort in the original Icewind Dale,\\" and that \\"the voice acting in Icewind Dale II is as great as you've perhaps come to expect from a Black Isle Studios role-playing game.\\" Computer Gaming World said that \\"[the] sound effects, music, and voiceovers are all excellent.\\" Icewind Dale II was nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds 2002 \\"RPG of the Year\\" award, which ultimately went to The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. The editors wrote that Icewind Dale II \\"is the last great game from a fading engine, and we love it.\\" It was also a nominee for PC Gamer USs \\"2002 Best Roleplaying Game\\" and The Electric Playgrounds \\"Best RPG for PC\\" awards, but lost both to Neverwinter Nights. Allen Rausch, writing for GameSpy's 2004 retrospective \\"A History of D&D; Video Games\\", \\"While nobody would mistake it for '2002 RPG of the Year' material, Black Isle Studios managed to give the Infinity engine a terrific game as its swan song.\\" Attempted remake While other Black Isle games, including Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, have been remade into Enhanced Editions by Beamdog, such as Icewind Dale: Enhanced Edition, Beamdog had unsuccessfully tried to do the same for Icewind Dale II due to the unavailability of the source code to the game; the project is on hiatus until the source code can be located.

The program was hosted by ventriloquist and voice actor Paul Winchell, airing Saturday mornings on NBC from September 9, 1972 to September 1, 1973. Paul would frequently use his dummies, Jerry Mahoney and/or Knucklehead Smiff on his program. The program was announced by Kenny Williams (as most Heatter-Quigley shows were), with music by Mort Garson. However, the show received low ratings and was canceled following the first season. Format The basic format of the game invited nine children to answer a three-way multiple choice question by running towards their chosen answer, then standing on marked areas numbered 1, 2 or 3. Just before the correct answer is revealed, the host invites the children to \\"Runaround... now!\\" at which point they have a split second to jump onto a different area; the premise is to give opponents the \\"runaround\\" in case they are merely following their movements. Host Winchell would say, before giving the correct answer, \\"When you hear the click, stick!\\" and then a moment later, \\"Last chance!\\", after which point he would press a finger-clicker (a toy device that made a clicking sound). Players still moving or not on one of the three answer areas were eliminated from the round (sent to a penalty area at the side of the stage). Winchell would then say, \\"Let's see who's right with the light!\\", whereupon the house lights would dim and the area for the correct answer would light up. Players with the correct answer took a pink ball from a large bowl near the middle of the stage; players with the incorrect answer were eliminated from the round. Each player had a transparent tube, into which the balls were dropped (this was a substitute scoring device for tote boards, which the show did not have). The player with the most balls at the end of the show was the day's winner.

Biography Willy Hess was born in Mannheim on 14 July 1859. He commenced the study of violin when only five years of age with his father, who was a pupil of Ludwig Spohr. When aged seven his family moved to the United States and as a youth he performed with his sister Joanna who accompanied him on pianoforte, making a number of successful tours around the country. In 1872 he moved back to Europe, spending a year in the Netherlands and performing in a number of continental cities. In 1874 he made an extended tour including London, Belgium and France. In 1876 he went to Berlin to be a student of Joseph Joachim and after two years left to take up the leadership of the Oper Frankfurt. He resigned from that post in 1886 to take up a professorship in the Rotterdam Conservatorium voor Muziek which he held for two years. In 1888 he moved to Manchester to become leader of the The Hallé Orchestra and from its opening in 1893 was also the principal professor of violin at the Royal Manchester College of Music. In 1895 he was appointed as principal professor of violin at the Conservatorium der Musik in Coeln (Cologne). From 1904 to 1910, he was the concertmaster of the Boston Symphony Orchestra and taught violin at Harvard University. He also spent time as concertmaster in Frankfurt and Rotterdam. He then relocated to Berlin in 1910 to take the position of premier violin instructor at the Royal Academy of Music in Berlin, Germany (Berlin Hochschule fuer Musik, now a part of the Berlin University of the Arts). The composer Max Bruch, a friend of Hess, helped arrange Hess's appointment as professor. During the time of the Weimar Republic the Hochschule was the hub of the international music scene, and Hess was associated with many of the musical luminaries of his day and taught students who came to Berlin from all over the world, the most distinguished of whom was his fellow German Adolf Busch. Hess taught a German style of right hand technique which emphasized wrist motion with very little finger motion. He had no difficulty alternating between the violin and viola, and performed the viola part in the first performance of Bruch's Double Concerto for Clarinet, Viola and Orchestra, Op. 88, as well as the first performance of the Violin Concerto, op. 50 by Felix Woyrsch 1903 in Altona. It was also in 1910 that Bruch composed the Concert Piece for Violin and Orchestra, Op. 84, for Hess. Hess advised Bruch on composing for strings, and also performed the premieres of other works by Bruch. Among works by other composers written for Hess was Arthur Foote's Ballade, Op. 69. He played in a piano trio with cellist Hugo Becker and pianist James Kwast. One of the instruments he played on was a Guadagnini. Hess died in Berlin in 1939, aged 79.

When a market for the Aerocar did not emerge, Taylor turned to more conventional designs. The Coot was nonetheless somewhat unusual for its low wing, a feature uncommon on most seaplanes and flying boats, which conventionally strive to keep their wings as far away from the water as possible. Instead, Taylor designed the Coot's wing roots to act as sponsons to stabilise the craft in the water. The arrangement allowed him to do away with the weight and drag penalties imposed by wingtip floats, and additionally gain ground effect benefits during takeoff. First flown in 1969, the Coot proved very popular with homebuilders, with an estimated 70 aircraft completed by 2007. The wings and elevator surfaces of the Taylor Coot can be folded for transport and storage. With wings folded the aircraft is wide. Some builders have equipped their aircraft with auxiliary sponsons.

For most of its history, it was the flagship station of the NBC Radio Network. It was a Class A clear-channel station broadcasting at the maximum power for AM radio, 50,000 watts. WNBC left the air on October 7, 1988. Its former frequency has since been occupied by Entercom-owned all- sports WFAN. NBC Network Radio (1922–1960) WNBC signed on for the first time on March 2, 1922, as WEAF, owned by AT&T; Western Electric. It was the first commercially licensed radio station in New York City. The call letters are popularly thought to have stood for Western Electric AT&T; Fone or Water, Earth, Air and Fire (the 4 classical elements). However, records suggest that the callsign was assigned from an alphabetical sequence. The first assigned callsign was actually WDAM. They were quickly dropped, but presumably came from the same alphabetical sequence. In 1922, WEAF broadcast what it later claimed to be the first radio advertisement (actually a roughly 10-minute-long talk anticipating today's radio and television infomercials). The ad promoted an apartment development in Jackson Heights near a new elevated subway line (the IRT's Flushing-Corona line, now the number 7 line). In 1926, WEAF was purchased by the Radio Corporation of America, making it a sister station to WJZ. RCA then formed the National Broadcasting Company, which operated two radio chains. WEAF became the flagship station of the NBC Red Network. The other chain was the NBC Blue Network, whose programming originated at WJZ (now WABC), also owned by RCA. As a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement of 1941 (NARBA), WEAF became a clear channel station, and could be heard across most of the eastern half of North America at night. In 1943, the United States Supreme Court ordered RCA to sell off one of its radio networks, citing antitrust concerns. The company decided to keep the Red Network, and it was rebranded as the NBC Radio Network after the Blue Network was divested, along with several stations (including WJZ), to Edward J. Noble. The Blue Network was renamed the American Broadcasting Company. WEAF's call letters were changed to WNBC in 1946, then to WRCA in 1954,\\"RCA replaces NBC in O&O; calls.\\" Broadcasting – Telecasting, October 4, 1954, pg. 78. and back to WNBC in 1960.\\"WRCA to be WNBC?\\" Broadcasting, April 4, 1960, pg. 88 WNBC local programming =1960s= By the early 1960s, the station gradually switched from NBC network programs to more local-oriented programs and adjusted its music policy from traditional standards to incorporate more popular hits while staying away from harder rock and roll. In 1964, it adopted a talk format, the first in New York radio. Hosts included genial morning- drive companion Big Wilson, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson announcer Ed McMahon, New York-based actor Robert Alda, NBC Radio comedian/satirist Mort Sahl, the witty mid-morning game-show host (\\"Fortune Phone\\") Sterling Yates, late-morning talk radio provocateur Joe Pyne, midday voices Lee Leonard and later Jim Gearhart, sports talk host Bill Mazer, plus late-nighters Brad Crandall (later of NFL Films) and Long John Nebel. On weekends, WNBC aired almost all of the NBC Radio Network's Monitor program, which featured many of WNBC's own hosts as well as the already established lineup holding court at NBC's Radio Central (Gene Rayburn, Henry Morgan, Bill Cullen, David Wayne, Kitty Carlisle and Wayne Howell). Later in the decade WNBC shed its \\"Conversation Station\\" format and readopted a middle-of-the-road (MOR) music format, covering songs from the 1940s to the 1960s with non-rock and soft rock hits recorded after 1955. The format would feature such artists as Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Nat \\"King\\" Cole, The Everly Brothers, Tom Jones, The 5th Dimension, Peggy Lee, and Dionne Warwick. Hosts during this transition back to music included Wilson, Jack Spector (formerly of WMCA), Jack Hayes, Charlie Brown and later Ted Brown, hired away from then-dominant MOR station WNEW. Well-known MOR host and vocalist Jim Lowe joined WNBC for a time during one of his many shuttles to and from WNEW. Former WMCA morning man Joe O'Brian joined WNBC during this time. By 1971, music from such acts as Sinatra and Cole would disappear, with a few exceptions, separating WNBC from its WNEW- like beginnings while WNEW also ironically began to also move away from the more traditional artists as well (only for them to return to a more traditional Big Band format 10 years later). =1970s= Don Imus was hired in December 1971, giving New York its first exposure to the shock jock genre. Imus stayed with the station for most of the next two decades, except for a couple of years in the late 1970s when there was a general purge of the air staff and a short-term format flip to a music intensive Top 40 approach. Despite somewhat different formats, WNBC saw itself as a mostly unsuccessful competitor to New York Top 40 powerhouse WABC. Thus they brought in Murray \\"the K\\" Kaufman in 1972, and Wolfman Jack opposite WABC's Bruce \\"Cousin Brucie\\" Morrow in 1973. This did not improve ratings much. By 1973, WNBC was a mainstream top 40 leaning Adult Contemporary radio station featuring the Carpenters, Paul Simon, Carole King, the Stylistics, Neil Diamond, James Taylor, and other artists of that era. They also began to play more 1960s-era rock and roll oldies, including the Motown artists, Beatles, Beach Boys, and Rolling Stones, at that point. Ted Brown would leave in the early 1970s and return to WNEW. In 1974, NBC Radio's new president, Jack G. Thayer, formerly of WGAR in Cleveland, hired John Lund from WNEW to be program director. Then WNBC hired Bruce Morrow away from WABC to take over the evening shift. In addition to Imus in the morning, Lund moved Cousin Brucie to middays, hired Bob Vernon for afternoons, Oogie Pringle for early evenings, and Dick Summer for late night. Other new DJs included Norm N. Nite who arrived from WCBS-FM in 1975. Lund departed in 1976. Joe McCoy was hired in 1976. Mel Phillips was program director at the time of Joe McCoy's hiring. By 1975, WNBC was playing an Adult Top 40 format, trying to compete with WABC. They featured hits from 1964 to then-current music. By this time, artists such as the Eagles, Billy Joel, Steve Miller, Fleetwood Mac, Bee Gees, Donna Summer, and disco acts, among others, were mixed in. Unfortunately, despite or because of the continuous tweaking of WNBC's format, the station remained in the second tier of New York stations. In 1977, Bob Pittman was hired as WNBC's new Program Director, replacing Mel Phillips. His first decision was to lay-off all of the station's personalities, some of which were veterans (including Don Imus, Cousin Brucie, Norm N. Nite and Joe McCoy), replacing them with younger- sounding disc jockeys from Boston and medium markets. He also shifted the format from Adult Top 40 or Hot AC to a more aggressively current-based Top 40 format, with occasional nods to FM radio (such as commercial-free hours). As a result of this tweaking, the station was now playing artists such as Andy Gibb, KC & the Sunshine Band, Boston, Peter Frampton, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, Billy Joel, the Bee Gees, among others. However, listenership did not go up, but actually went down, and while some of the new air personalities would find success (Johnny Dark, Frank Reed, and Allen Beebe would be heard on the station well into the 1980s), others would not (Ellie Dylan, who replaced Imus in morning drive, would be gone within months). By 1979, Pittman would leave WNBC (he would soon become the founder of MTV). John Lund was hired back as program director (from KHOW in Denver), and Don Imus returned to the morning show. Under program director John Lund, WNBC's playlist was tweaked back to an Adult top 40 format, and ratings increased by 50% to surpass WABC by the summer of 1980. =1980s= In the early 1980s, WNBC continued as an adult-leaning Top 40 radio station. The best days of WNBC were from the fall of 1980 until the fall of 1983, when the station was consistently in or near the top 5. When Lund returned as program director in late 1979, WNBC general manager Robert Sherman set the goal: \\"Beat WABC\\", which had been New York's #1 station for decades. Lund launched the \\"Twice as Many\\" contest promoting \\"twice the music, twice the prizes, and twice as many chances to win\\". As New York's #2 station (behind WABC), \\"WNBC had to be twice as good to be #1\\". WNBC promotion director Dale Pon (who later created the successful \\"I Want My MTV\\" campaign) created its slogan \\"The Next One\\", meaning that it would be the number-one ranked AM music station in New York City. As part of that campaign, TV commercials and subway boards softened the image of the cantankerous Don Imus by including two cute twin blonde little girls saying \\"We're #2\\" and blanketing the New York City metro area. When an Arbitron report was released that WNBC believed confirmed that it was in fact the most popular AM music radio station in New York City, the slogan was changed to \\"The New One\\". Also in 1980, to differentiate its call letter similarity with WABC, Lund got Imus and other talents to over-emphasize the letter N when saying the station name: \\"66 W-NNNN-B-C\\". Within a year, Imus was #1 in the morning and WNBC surpassed WABC in Arbitron ratings. WNBC added American Top 40 with Casey Kasem late in 1980. In reality, WABC's ratings had begun to nosedive in 1978-79, and by the time WNBC beat them in 1980, it was only good enough for sixth place in the market (behind WBLS, WKTU, WOR, CBS-FM and WRFM). In 1981, John Lund left WNBC to begin his consulting and research firm in San Francisco, and the station's assistant PD, R.E. \\"Buzz\\" Brindle served as interim program director until Kevin Metheny was hired in the late Spring. WNBC began moving to a similar AC format to sister station WYNY. Hard rock songs were eliminated during the day. At night, the station was slightly hotter playing a limited amount of rock songs. At that time, WNBC and WYNY were sort of fraternal twin stations (playing identical types of music but presented differently and their music mix was somewhat different for both current and gold songs). By summer 1982, WNBC was near the top with some of their best ratings ever. =Filling the void left by WABC= Once WABC switched to their present-day all-talk format on May 10, 1982, WNBC added a few rock songs that were not heard on any AC stations in the area. In the fall of 1982 to much fanfare, Long Island native Howard Stern was brought in from WWDC-FM in Washington, D.C., to do afternoon drive. Initially, Stern played a considerable amount of music, much to his dismay, though his ratings were high. Then, in 1983 with ABC-owned WPLJ evolving to a Contemporary Hit Radio (CHR) format, as well as WHTZ's debut with the same format, WNBC began to lose some listeners. WNBC lost American Top 40 to WPLJ in November 1983. The station performed well through 1984. =Transition from Music Intensive to Full Service= In the spring of 1984, Dale Parsons took over as program director. After that, Stern cut down his music load, eventually playing only four songs an hour and began to talk much more. On overnights beginning in the spring of 1984, WNBC added taped Wolfman Jack shows which featured oldies from the 1960s with some 1950s and early 1970s music, with current and 80's hits mixed into rotation and pre-recorded voice tracks of Wolfman Jack announcing the songs, making the show sound live. Throughout his three years at WNBC, Stern had continuous battles with station management and other jocks at the station, specifically Don Imus and program director Kevin Metheny, whom Stern nicknamed \\"Pig Virus\\". Many of these conflicts were dramatized in Stern's autobiographical book and film Private Parts which included an amusing scene where he is instructed by Metheny (fictionalized for the film as Kenny Rushton, with a nickname change to \\"Pig Vomit\\", and played by Paul Giamatti) on the preferred \\"W-ehhNNN-B-C\\" pronunciation of the station's call letters. Early in 1985, WNBC was a Hot AC station with a moderate amount of 1960s and 1970s music mixed in. That year they evolved from a music intensive format to more of a full-service AC station, with music as a background and personality as the foreground. In the spring of 1985, former children's television show host Soupy Sales started a talk-intensive program in middays, replacing the Frank Reed all-request radio show, heard 1984–1985 weekdays 10 a.m. – 3 p.m. Soupy combined comedy, games, and talk, while playing 6 to 8 songs per hour. On weekends they became oldies- based, emphasizing 1960s oldies while still playing current product in moderation; they were now basically out of the Top 40/CHR realm by then. Their younger audience base had already gone to WHTZ or WPLJ, but with Stern in afternoons and Imus in the morning they continued to do reasonably well. Imus and Soupy Sales were down to six to eight songs an hour and Stern played about four songs per hour, although he complained about the type of music on the playlist he was supposed to be playing at the time. That summer, with radiocasts of the New York Knicks and New York Rangers, WNBC added Sports Night on weekday evenings, initially hosted by Jack Spector until early in 1986 and then Dave Sims after that. During the month of August, music was still heard during \\"Sportsnight\\", approximately four songs per hour before being dropped completely by the end of the year. Stern was attempting to stop playing music on his show at this point, but songs were still used sporadically, as September airchecks exist with him playing \\"Bend Me Shape Me\\" by The American Breed (and making fun of it), \\"Careless Whisper\\" and \\"Freedom\\" by Wham!, \\"Part Time Lover\\" by Stevie Wonder and a few others. He was probably playing about two records per hour but never seemed to completely drop music. Stern's days at NBC were numbered for unrelated reasons. At that point music was taking a backseat during the week on the station. =Decline= On September 30, 1985, Howard Stern was terminated abruptly, supposedly due to corporate pressure. In Private Parts, Stern detailed how WNBC management expected that his last day would be September 26, and that Stern would not go in to work on September 27 due to Hurricane Gloria. However, Stern went in, and because there was no station management on hand, Stern did his show as normal refusing to cover the problems related to the storm. Ironically, he spent much of the show insisting that he was leaving the station, because he had learned that Soupy Sales had signed a syndication contract that had long been withheld from Stern. After Stern's dismissal and subsequent debut on rival New York station 92.3 K-Rock, WNBC's ratings plummeted, and they were under a two-share by the spring of 1986. Initially, they played a bit more music and then went through several temporary afternoon hosts. Afternoons were back to about 12 songs per hour. The music was more of a gold-based Adult Contemporary format with many oldies and moderate amounts of current product. In the Spring of 1986, Joey Reynolds moved into afternoons with a talk- intensive show playing six songs an hour. Wolfman Jack was dropped in overnights in favor of various weekend announcers playing the regular AC rotation. Weekends had Bill Grundfest doing a talk intensive show a few hours each day playing six songs an hour. Despite these changes, by the fall of 1986, WNBC was in a ratings crisis. At approximately 4:42 PM on October 22, 1986, the station's \\"N-Copter\\" traffic helicopter crashed into the Hudson River, killing traffic reporter Jane Dornacker and severely injuring pilot Bill Pate. As millions of WNBC listeners heard Dornacker giving her traffic report, she stopped abruptly as a grinding noise could be heard in the background (likely the copter engines going overspeed). Dornacker then screamed in terror, \\"Hit the water! Hit the water! Hit the water!\\", as the radio transmission was suddenly cut off and a very shaken Joey Reynolds, working as radio host, awkwardly tried to figure out what had happened by saying \\"Okay, we're going to play some music here, I think\\", and then played \\"Hip to Be Square\\" by Huey Lewis and the News. Dornacker had recently gotten back to flying in a helicopter after surviving a previous crash on of the N-Copter into the Hackensack River in New Jersey a few months earlier on April 18. An episode of NBC's television show Third Watch featured a similar incident (although it may have been more of a reference to the crash of WNBC- TV's helicopter, which crashed into the Passaic River in New Jersey over a decade later, with no deaths). WNBC had a turnover of programming in early 1987. On February 23, the music intensive AC mix with various people was dropped on overnights in favor of Alan Colmes, who would also do a talk intensive show and only six songs per hour. On February 27, 1987, Joey Reynolds' show was ended and Bill Grundfest temporarily moved into this time slot. On March 9, 1987, Alan Colmes moved to afternoons and continued to play four songs per hour. Joey Reynolds did not run his own board and had Big Jay Sorensen as his producer and board operator. Since Colmes ran his own board, Jay Sorensen moved to the overnight shift and did a music intensive show. This show was now marketed as The Time Machine, playing oldies from 1955 to 1974 (emphasizing 1964–69), complete with old jingles and an echo effect, resulting in a sound similar to WABC's during its Top 40 heyday. Two weeks later, on March 23, 1987, Soupy Sales had found out that there were plans to end his show and at that point he walked off midway through with Dale Parsons finishing the show. Weekender and assistant programming director, Jim Collins moved into that time slot with a gold based music intensive show on a temporary basis. Then on April 6, 1987, a couple weeks after Soupy Sales left, his former sidekick, Ray D'Ariano moved back into the 10 am to 2 pm weekday time slot but was now playing 1955–73 oldies focusing on 1964-69. His show was music-intensive, playing about 12 oldies an hour. In the summer of 1987, WNBC considered going all oldies, running the Time Machine full-time, with the exception of Knicks games, Rangers games, and Imus in the Morning. But instead, they increased the amount of oldies programming, but not on a full- time basis. Therefore, WNBC modified their format, keeping Imus in the morning, playing a few AC cuts and a couple oldies an hour with his usual talk. Alan Colmes continued hosting the afternoon drive talk show, but dropped music altogether. In evenings, Dave Sims continued with sports talk along with Knicks and Rangers games. The Time Machine remained on overnights, but was now expanded to full-time on weekends with hosts Dan Taylor (laid off from WHN when they became WFAN, \\"Big\\" Jay Sorenson, \\"The Real\\" Bob James, Jim Collins, Lee Chambers, Dale Parsons, Carol Mason and others. Ray D'Ariano continued his midday weekday oldies show, but was not part of the \\"Time Machine\\" programming. His show had newer WNBC jingles, no echo sound effects, and slightly softer songs. From the Summer of 1987 to the station's demise on October 7, 1988, WNBC's format was classified as Adult Contemporary, but they only played Adult Contemporary cuts during Imus's show. The actual format was block programming featuring AC and Talk in morning drive; all-Oldies on Middays, overnights, and weekends; Talk on weekday afternoons; and sports talk weekday evenings and whenever the Knicks or Rangers played a game. It was difficult to classify WNBC's format at that point. The beginning of WFAN and the end of WNBC (1987–1988) In November 1987, General Electric, which owned NBC at that time through its purchase of RCA in February 1986, announced that it would sell off the NBC Radio division. In February 1988, GE made a multi- station deal with Emmis Communications and, in New York, the WNBC license for 660 was included in the sale. Emmis announced it would move WFAN to 660. At the time, WFAN was located at 1050 AM and had a somewhat marginal signal in portions of the New York area. As the deal only included the license for WNBC and not the station's intellectual property, GE shut down the station for good.Radio City Without Radio: WNBC Is Gone On October 7, 1988, at 5:30 pm, WFAN moved to WNBC's old frequency at 660 AM, which has a much better signal. Earlier in the day, the station aired a 90-minute retrospective titled \\"WNBC- The First 66 Years,\\" hosted by Dale Parsons. The program was written and produced by Parsons and his wife, Ginny, who spent nearly six months researching the station's history. Regular music programming ended at 6 am; Jay Sorenson played \\"Imagine\\" by John Lennon followed by the NBC chimes and a 5-second pause.Rock Radio Scrapbook-Hellos & Goodbyes-WNBC The last voice heard on WNBC was that of Alan Colmes, who said \\"I'm Alan Colmes.

Their soon-to-be- former TV sister station, WNBC-TV, abruptly cut from a pre-produced history piece on WNBC and NBC Radio during their 5:00 pm newscast to cover the sign- off live.YouTube Video – \\"WNBC Radio sign-off on WNBC-TV\\" The October 7, 1988 signoff of WNBC radio, as covered LIVE by WNBC-TV on LIVE AT FIVE. Reports from Al Roker & Roger Grimsby. The TV station busted Grimsby's prerecorded package, as the final 2 seconds were counted down. Coverage continued with Al Roker at Shea Stadium, where a ceremonial switch was thrown marking the move of WFAN radio down the dial, from 1050 to 660. The final unofficial voice was that of then-WNBC-TV reporter Roger Grimsby, who could be heard announcing, \\"You heard the countdown, it's over.\\" After 66 years, the long history of NBC radio in New York had come to an end.audio file-Last moments of WNBC/first moments of WFAN Due to the way the transfer was handled legally, WFAN still operates under WEAF/WRCA/WNBC's old license. The FCC recognizes that Emmis Communications changed the callsign of WNBC to WFAN; changed the station's format to sports radio; rebranded the station as SportsRadio 66 WFAN; and reassigned on- and off-air staff. In effect, this new WFAN (660 AM) licensed to New York City had become the successor to the previous WFAN (1050 AM) licensed to New York City. While WFAN did not claim any part of WNBC's history upon the switch, it did inherit WNBC's rights to New York Knicks and Rangers play-by-play and signed up Imus to take Greg Gumbel's place in the morning. Imus remained on the morning drive-time slot for 19 years until his firing in 2007 for comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team; he moved to WABC near the end of that year and remained there until retiring in 2018. In the complicated switch that saw WFAN move to 660, 1050 that was formerly the home of WFAN became that of Spanish-language WUKQ, owned by Spanish Broadcasting System. However, SBS already owned an AM station in the market, Newark-based WSKQ at 620, and at the time, FCC rules stipulated that companies could own only one AM station per market. As a result, SBS received a temporary waiver to run 1050 while exploring the sale of either AM frequency. SBS chose to keep 620, and 1050 was traded to Forward Communications, which owned WEVD, then at 97.9 FM. After that deal was approved, WEVD's call letters and programming moved to 1050 (it is now WEPN) and SBS took over 97.9 as WSKQ-FM. The October NBC-Emmis switch also saw Emmis's WQHT (then at 103.5) move to 97.1, which had been the home of NBC's WYNY. Emmis sold 103.5 to Westwood One, who also acquired the WYNY call letters and its country music format. In the end, WFAN retired two of the oldest radio call letters from the dawn of commercial radio: WHN and WNBC.

It features a single 40-minute track, telling a story in the distant future, when human civilization is about to end. The album, which features Opeth frontman Mikael Åkerfeldt, received substantial critical acclaim, and is considered by most fans to be Edge of Sanity's finest achievement. A sequel, Crimson II, was released in 2003 and picks up directly where the first album left off.

This version splits the song in half, the parts running 18:38 and 21:04 respectively.Crimson I&II; at Discogs Narrative The album's single song tells the story of a world where humans no longer can bear children. Into this time of despair a child is born to the King and Queen of the barren Earth. The Queen dies during childbirth, and the King is left to rule the Earth and raise his daughter on his own. The people think the child is a sign that God will give them back the ability to reproduce, but as the child grows into a teenager humanity remains infertile. In time, the King dies and men fight over his throne. The new King crushes rebellions against his illegitimate rule and is generally hated by the populace. Eventually the Child is persuaded to lead a coup. As she is left alone to plan, the forces of evil beckon to her. She accepts an unholy Master and gains strong magical powers. She slays the false King easily and begins ruling Earth. The people watch her obsessively, because it was thought that by restoring the rightful ruler they might be returned the gift of breeding. But the new Queen misleads the people and slays the elders who the humans had preserved for their wisdom. Word of this gets out and a group of rebels gathers to stop her. They find a way to neutralize her power (by blinding her) and then place her in the same preservative tank of \\"crimson fluid\\" that the elders were kept in.

It is the commercial capital of the autonomous Jubaland region. The city is situated southwest of Mogadishu, near the mouth of the Jubba River, where the waters empty into the Indian Ocean. According to the United Nations Development Programme, the city of Kismayo had a population of around 89,333 in 2005.https://docs.unocha.org/sites/dms/Somalia/UNDP-POP- RURAL-URBAN%202005.pdf During the Middle Ages, Kismayo and its surrounding area was part of the Ajuran Empire that governed much of southern Somalia and eastern Ethiopia, with its domain extending from Hobyo in the north, to Qelafo in the west, to Kismayo in the south.Lee V. Cassanelli, The shaping of Somali society: reconstructing the history of a pastoral people, 1600–1900, (University of Pennsylvania Press: 1982), p.102. In the early modern period, Kismayo was ruled by the Geledi Sultanate and by the later 1800s, the Boqow dynasty. The kingdom was eventually incorporated into Italian Somaliland in 1910 after the death of the last sultan, Osman Ahmed. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official Kismayo District. Kismayo was the site of numerous battles during the civil war, from the early 1990s.http://www.cdint.org/resources/publications/somali/from-the-bottom-up/ In late 2006, Islamist militants gained control of most of the city. To reclaim possession of the territory, a new autonomous regional administration dubbed Azania was announced in 2010 and formalized in 2011. In September 2012, the Somali National Army and AMISOM troops re-captured the city from the Al- Shabaab insurgents. The Juba Interim Administration was subsequently officially established and recognized in 2013. History =Antiquity= During antiquity. Kismayo was part of the Somali city-states that in engaged in a lucrative trade network connecting Somali merchants with Phoenicia, Ptolemic Egypt, Greece, Parthian Persia, Saba, Nabataea and the Roman Empire. Somali sailors used the ancient Somali maritime vessel known as the beden to transport their cargo.Journal of African History pg.50 by John Donnelly Fage and Roland Anthony Oliver =Middle Ages and the early modern period= Flag of the Ajuran Sultanate, an influential Somali empire that held sway over Kismayo and the larger Jubaland region during the Middle Ages. The Kismayo area was originally a small fishing settlement. During the Middle Ages, the region came under the rule of the influential Ajuran Sultanate, which utilized the Jubba River for its plantations. After the collapse of this polity, the House of Gobroon was established and the Sultanate of the Geledi held sway over the area. The dynasty reached its apex under the successive reigns of Sultan Yusuf Mahamud Ibrahim, who successfully consolidated Gobroon power during the Bardera wars, and Sultan Ahmed Yusuf, who forced regional powers such as the Omani Empire to submit tribute. From 1836 until 1861, Kismayo and other parts of Jubaland were claimed by the Sultanate of Muscat (now in Oman), when the new Sultanate of Zanzibar was split from Muscat and Oman and given control of its East African territories. =Colonial era= On 7 November 1890, Zanzibar became a British protectorate, and on 1 July 1895, the Sultanate ceded all of its coastal possessions in continental East Africa to Britain. Together with the Zanzibar Sultanate's other former possessions in the area, Jubaland became part of the British East Africa colony. The Italians subsequently referred to the city as Chisimaio. Kismayo and the northern half of the Jubaland region were then incorporated into neighboring Italian Somaliland on 30 June 1926. The colony had a total area of 87,000 km² (33,000 sq mi), with a population of 120,000 inhabitants. Britain retained control of the southern half of the partitioned Jubaland territory, which was later called the Northern Frontier District (NFD). =Somali Civil War= Following the breakdown of central authority that accompanied the civil war in 1991, various local militias fought for control of the city, including supporters of Mohammed Said Hersi (\\"General Morgan\\"), and Col. Barre Adan Shire Hiiraale Somali National Front (SNF), later on known as the Juba Valley Alliance (JVA). As well of Col. Omar Jess' Somali Patriotic Movement (SPM). In March 1993, a United States Marine amphibious group arrived in the city in an attempt to keep the peace as part of the United Nations intervention in Somalia. By December 1993, General Morgan's troops controlled Kismayo, despite the presence of peacekeepers. The last UN troops left the city in December 1994.N.Y. Times, World News Briefs; Last U.N.

And invaded other parts of southern Somalia and promptly imposed Shari'a law. The Transitional Federal Government sought to re‑establish its authority, and, with the assistance of Ethiopian troops, African Union peacekeepers and air support by the United States, managed to drive out the rival ICU and solidify its rule. On January 8, 2007, as the Battle of Ras Kamboni raged just south of Kismayo, the TFG relocated from its interim location in Baidoa to the nation's capital, Mogadishu. This marked the first time since the fall of the Siad Barre regime in 1991 that the federal government controlled most of the country.Somalia President, Parliament Speaker dispute over TFG term Following this defeat, the Islamic Courts Union splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including Al‑Shabaab, regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al‑Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. By January 2009, Al‑Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to retreat, leaving behind an under-equipped African Union peacekeeping force to assist the Transitional Federal Government's troops. In September 2012, the Somali Army and AMISOM troops re-captured the city from the Al-Shabaab insurgents during the Battle of Kismayo (2012). On 12 July 2019, a car bomb and a gun attack at the Asasey hotel killed at least 26, including two prominent journalists and nine foreigners. Islamist group al- Shabab claimed responsibility.

With the subsequent ouster of the Al-Shabaab rebels in September 2012, the Somali government began preparing mediations between the city's various stakeholders in order to establish an inclusive local administration. On 28 August 2013, the autonomous Jubaland administration signed a national reconciliation agreement in Addis Ababa with the federal government. Endorsed by the federal State Minister for the Presidency Farah Abdulkadir on behalf of President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, the pact was brokered by the Foreign Ministry of Ethiopia and came after protracted bilateral talks. Under the terms of the agreement, Jubaland is administered for a two-year period by a Juba Interim Administration and led by the region's incumbent president, Ahmed Mohamed Islam. The regional president serves as the chairperson of a new Executive Council, to which he appoints three deputies. Additionally, the agreement includes the integration of Jubaland's military forces under the central command of the Somali National Army (SNA), and stipulates that the Juba Interim Administration will command the regional police.

Three levels of subordination were established for bearers of this title: * SS and Police Leader (SS- und Polizeiführer), SSPF * Higher SS and Police Leader (Höherer SS- und Polizeiführer, HSSPF, HSS-PF, HSSuPF) * Supreme SS and Police Leader (Höchster SS- und Polizeiführer, HöSSPF)  History  The first Higher SS and Police Leaders were appointed in 1937Yerger, p. 22. from the existing SS-Oberabschnitt Führer (leaders of the main districts). The purpose of the Higher SS and Police Leader was to be a direct command authority for every SS and police unit in a given geographical region with such authority answering only to Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler and Adolf Hitler. They were to act as the highest liaison under Himmler and \\"unifier\\" for command of the SS and police in a region. Inside the Reich the man named as HSSPF was usually also SS-Oberabschnitt Führer for that region. In the occupied territories, there was no Oberabschnitt, so the HSSPF existed on their own. However, they had something the Reich HSSPFs did not - several SS- und Polizeiführer (SSPF) reporting to them.Yerger, pp. 22, 52. There were two Höchster SS- und Polizeiführer (Supreme SS and Police Leader) posts. These were Italien (1943–1945) and Ukraine (1943–1944), both of which had various HSSPF and SSPF reporting to them.Yerger, pp. 22–25. The SS and police leaders directly commanded a headquarters staff with representatives from almost every branch of the SS and the uniformed police. This typically included the Ordnungspolizei (Orpo; regular police), Gestapo (secret police), Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV; Nazi concentration camps), SD (intelligence service), and certain units of the Waffen-SS (combat units). Most of these SS and Police Leaders normally held the rank of SS-Gruppenführer or above and answered directly to Himmler in all matters pertaining to the SS within their area of responsibility. Their role was to be part of the SS control mechanism within the state policing the German population and overseeing the activities of the SS men within each respective district. The men in these positions could bypass the main chain of command of the administrative offices in their district for the SS, SD, SiPo, SS-TV and Orpo under the \\"guise of an emergency situation\\" thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups. Himmler authorized SS and Police Bases (SS- und Polizeistützpunkte) to be established in occupied Poland and occupied areas of the Soviet Union. They were to be \\"armed industrialized agricultural complexes\\". They would also maintain order in the areas they were established. They did not go beyond the planning stage.Ingrao, Charles W.; Szabo, Franz A. J. (2008). The Germans and the East. Purdue University Press, p. 288. In 1944 and 1945, many HSSPF were promoted to general's rank in the Waffen-SS by Himmler. This was apparently an attempt to provide potential protection under the Hague Convention rules of warfare.  Crimes against humanity decrypted wireless telegram from \\"HSSPF Russland Mitte\\" (middle Russia) in 1942, reporting to Himmler the 'liquidation' of a village in Belarus (from NSA report) Another decrypt, 1941, HSSPF Russland Sud (south Russia), reporting to Himmler the 'liquidation' of Jewish people (from NSA report) The SS and Police Leaders served as commanding SS generals for any Einsatzgruppen (death squads) operating in their area. This entailed ordering the deaths of tens of thousands of persons and, following the end of World War II, most SS and Police Leaders who had served in Poland and the Soviet Union were charged with war crimes and crimes against humanity. The SS and Police Leaders were the overseeing authority of the Jewish ghettos in Poland and, as such, directly coordinated deportations to Nazi extermination camps with the administrative help of the RSHA. They had direct command over Order Police battalions and SD regiments that were assigned to guard the ghettos.

The HSSPF areas themselves might change, be absorbed, cease to exist, etc. This list is by no means exhaustive.Yerger lists about 37 separate HSSPF posts, most of which had several different commanders over the lifetime of the post.

Early life Luis was born in Sevilla, Spain, and studied at the University of Salamanca before entering the convent of \\"Calvario de los Hermanos Menores\\". He was sent, in 1600, to the Philippines, in order to take on the spiritual needs of the Japanese settlement of Dilao, until it was destroyed by Spanish forces, in 1608, after intense fighting. In 1608, Pope Paul V authorized Dominicans and Franciscans to proselytize in Japan, heretofore the preserve of the Jesuits. Sotelo spent four years in Manila, learning the Japanese language before going to Japan and taking a leading role there.  Proselytism in Edo Sotelo tried to establish a Franciscan church in the area of Edo (present-day Tokyo). The church was destroyed in 1612, following the interdiction of Christianity in the territories of the Tokugawa shogunate on April 21, 1612. After a period of intense missionary activity by the Catholic Church, Tokugawa Hidetada, the second shōgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, issued a decree which banned the practice and teaching of the Christian faith, and under the threat of loss of life, all the missionaries had to leave Japan. This decree started the bloody persecution of Christians, which lasted several decades.Fros SJ, Henryk Book of names and saints, pp. 423–437, 2007 After the healing in Edo of a concubine of the powerful daimyō of Sendai, Date Masamune, Sotelo was invited to the northern part of Japan, in the area controlled by Date, under whom Christianity was still allowed. He came back to Tokyo the following year and constructed and inaugurated a new church on May 12, 1613, in the area of Asakusa Torigoe. The Bakufu reacted by arresting the Christians, and Sotelo himself was put in the Kodenma-chō (小伝馬町) prison. Seven fellow Japanese Christians, who had been arrested with Sotelo, were executed on July 1, but he was freed following a special request by Date Masamune. Embassy project Sotelo, fluent in Japanese, planned and acted as translator on a Japanese embassy sent by Date Masamune to Spain on October 28, 1613. The embassy was headed by Hasekura Rokuemon Tsunenaga, and crossed the Pacific to Acapulco on board the Japanese-built (with assistance from European sailors) galleon San Juan Bautista. The embassy continued to Veracruz and Sanlucar de Barrameda, Seville, and Madrid. Sotelo had the Japanese receive baptism in Madrid, before accompanying them to see Pope Paul V in Rome. A replica of the Japanese-built 1613 galleon San Juan Bautista. The embassy was a product of ambitions of Sotelo to increase the spread of the church in Japan and of Date Masamune to provide more priests to man the churches of his Christian subjects and to establish trade between Sendai and New Spain,\\"Documents related to Date Masamune\\", Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan, Volumes 20-21, 1893, pp. 87-93 and it had the approval of the shōgun, Tokugawa Ieyasu. Sotelo remained for a full year in Madrid on the return journey, along with the rest of the embassy, delayed because Christianity was being harshly repressed in Japan, and because he was awaiting consecration as second Bishop of Japan. Pope Paul V had appointed him as such, pending the approval of the King of Spain, but, primarily because of rivalries between Franciscans and Jesuits, he was never consecrated. However, the Catholic Council of the Indies sent him back to Nueva España in 1618, to pursue his missionary activities there. Most of the Japanese samurai sent with the mission, who had converted to Christianity, remained at Coria del Río, near Seville, where their descendants live to this day. Sotelo accompanied ambassador Hasekura and the remains of the embassy back to Veracruz and Acapulco, where the San Juan Bautista, requested by the outgoing Viceroy of the Philippines to convey him to the Philippines before returning to Sendai, diverted their course to Manila, arriving there in 1620. The ambassadors' plan to return to Sendai from Manila was obstructed first by pirates and contrary winds. When Hasekura finally was able to return, the Spanish authorities impounded Sotelo in Manila, having no desire to stir up conflict with the Portuguese Jesuit mission in Macao by allowing a second, rival Franciscan bishop to be consecrated in Sendai, in addition to the existing Jesuit Bishop of Japan, previously ruling the diocese of Funai (Nagasaki). Date Masamune had wanted to trade with Nueva España (Mexico), but it soon became apparent that the policy of sakoku (the late-1613 closure of Japan to outside influences except for very carefully controlled trade through south-western ports), along with Spanish insistence that all trade to the East be channelled through the Philippines, would make this impossible.  Return to Japan and Martyrdom  When Masamune Date sent a ship to collect him from the Philippines in order to bring him back to Sendai, the Spanish authorities forbade Sotelo to board it and would not allow him to make his own boat and sail there. He finally managed to enter Japan in 1622 and was turned over to the authorities by Chinese merchants when he was discovered on their ship. He was imprisoned for two years at Ōmura, north of Nagasaki, while the shōgun deliberated on his case. In the local prison, he joined Pedro Vásquez, Miguel de Carvalho and two Japanese Franciscans, Ludovicus Sasada and tertiary Ludovicus Baba.Fros SJ, Henryk Saints and Blessed of the Society of Jesus, Kraków: Wydawnictwo Apostolstwa Modlitwy, pp. 108–109, 1992, Sotelo was burned at the stake in Ōmura, on 25 August 1624, at the age of 50, together with his religious companions.Boxer, Charles Ralph.

It lasted roughly six months from April to October 1096, and is categorized either as a prelude to the First Crusade, or, as a distinct part of the First Crusade to be distinguished from the \\"Princes' Crusade\\" which was much more well-organized, well-armed, and well-funded. It is also known as the Peasants' Crusade, Paupers' Crusade or the Popular Crusade as it was not part of the official Catholic Church-organised expeditions that came later. Led primarily by Peter the Hermit with forces of Walter Sans Avoir, the untrained peasant army was destroyed by the forces of the Seljuk Sultanate of Rum under Kilij Arslan at the Battle of Civetot in northwestern Anatolia. Historically, there has been much debate over whether Peter was the real initiator of the Crusade as opposed to Pope Urban II. The expedition's independence has been used by some historians such as to prove this.  Background  Peter the Hermit Preaching the First Crusade – from the painting by James Archer – from Cassell's History of England, Vol. I – anonymous author and artists Map of the People's Crusade Pope Urban II planned the departure of the crusade for 15 August 1096; a number of unexpected bands of peasants and low-ranking knights organized and set off for Jerusalem on their own. The peasant population had been afflicted by drought, famine, and disease for many years before 1096, and some of them seem to have envisioned the crusade as an escape from these hardships. Spurring them on had been a number of meteorological occurrences beginning in 1095 that seemed to be a divine blessing for the movement: a meteor shower, aurorae, a lunar eclipse, and a comet, among other events. An outbreak of ergotism had also occurred just before the Council of Clermont. Millenarianism, the belief that the end of the world was imminent, popular in the early 11th century, experienced a resurgence in popularity. The response was beyond expectations: while Urban might have expected a few thousand knights, he ended up with a migration numbering up to 100,000 Crusaders of mostly unskilled fighters, including women and children. A charismatic monk and powerful orator named Peter the Hermit of Amiens was the spiritual leader of the movement. He was known for riding a donkey and dressing in simple clothing. He had vigorously preached the crusade throughout northern France and Flanders. He claimed to have been appointed to preach by Christ himself (and supposedly had a divine letter to prove it), and it is likely that some of his followers thought he, not Urban, was the true originator of the crusading idea. It is often believed that Peter's army was a band of illiterate, incompetent peasants who had no idea where they were going, and who believed that every city of any size they encountered on their way was Jerusalem itself; this may have been true for some, but the long tradition of pilgrimages to Jerusalem ensured that the location and distance of the city were well known. While the majority were unskilled in fighting, there were some well-trained minor knights leading them, such as Walter Sans-Avoir (also mistakenly known as Walter the PennilessJonathan Riley-Smith, The Crusades: A History, 2nd ed. (Yale University Press, 2005), pg. 27), who was experienced in warfare. A list of known members of Peter's army can be found in Riley-Smith, et al., A Database of Crusaders to the Holy Land. Massacre of Jews in Central Europe In the late spring and summer of 1096, crusaders destroyed most of the Jewish communities along the Rhine in a series of unprecedentedly large pogroms in France and Germany in which thousands of Jews were massacred, driven to suicide, or forced to convert to Christianity.Nikolas Jaspert, The Crusades. Routledge, 2006: 39–40.Gerd Mentgen, \\"Crusades\\" in Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution (Vol. 1), ed. Richard S. Levy, 151-53.Jonathan Phillips, Holy Warriors: A Modern History of the Crusades. Random House, 2010: 9–10. Twelve Jews were murdered in Speyer, where the Bishop saved the rest of the Jews in return for a large payment from them, but in Worms some 800 were murdered. In Mainz, over one thousand Jews were murdered, as well as more in Trier, Metz, Cologne, and elsewhere. Others were subjected to forced baptism and conversion. The preacher Folkmar and Count Emicho of Flonheim were the main inciters and leaders of the massacre. The major chroniclers of the 1096 killings are Solomon bar Simson and Albert of Aachen.Norman Cohn, The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages.

Estimates of the number of Jewish men, women, and children murdered or driven to suicide by crusaders vary, ranging from 2,000 to 12,000.Simon Dubno and Moshe Spiegel, History of the Jews: From the Roman Empire to the Early Medieval Period (Vol. 2). Associated University Presse, 1980: 677. Julius Aronius put the number killed at 4,000, regarding other figures as too high.Jits van Straten, Jewish Migrations from Germany to Poland: the Rhineland Hypothesis Revisited, Mankind Quarterly 44 (2003). Norman Cohn puts the number at between 4,000 and 8,000 from May to June 1096.

Flannery, The Anguish of the Jews: Twenty-Three Centuries of Antisemitism. Paulist Press, 1985: 93. The clergy and nobility of Europe condemned the killing of Jews, and forbade it on subsequent crusades.  Walter and the French  1888 map showing proximity of left Peter gathered his army at Cologne on 12 April 1096, planning to stop there and preach to the Germans and gather more crusaders. The French, however, were not willing to wait for Peter and the Germans and under the leadership of Walter Sans Avoir, a few thousand French crusaders left before Peter and reached Hungary on 8 May, passing through Hungary without incident and arriving at the river Sava at the border of Byzantine territory at Belgrade. The Belgrade commander was taken by surprise, having no orders on what to do with them, and refused entry, forcing the crusaders to pillage the countryside for food. This resulted in skirmishes with the Belgrade garrison and, to make matters worse, sixteen of Walter's men had tried to rob a market in Zemun across the river in Hungary and were stripped of their armor and clothing, which was hung from the castle walls. Eventually the crusaders were allowed to carry on to Niš, where they were provided with food and waited to hear from Constantinople.  Cologne to Constantinople  Peter and the remaining crusaders left Cologne about 20 April. About 40,000 Crusaders departed immediately. Another group would follow soon after; this group committed the Rhineland massacres against Jewish populations and is sometimes referred to as the \\"German Crusade of 1096\\". When they reached the Danube, part of the army decided to continue on by boat down the Danube, while the main body continued overland and entered Hungary at Sopron. There it continued through Hungary without incident and rejoined the Danube contingent at Zemun on the Byzantine frontier. alt= In Zemun, the crusaders became suspicious, seeing Walter's sixteen suits of armor hanging from the walls, and eventually a dispute over the price of a pair of shoes in the market led to a riot, which then turned into an all-out assault on the city by the crusaders, in which 4,000 Hungarians were killed. The crusaders then fled across the river Sava to Belgrade, but only after skirmishing with Belgrade troops. The residents of Belgrade fled, and the crusaders pillaged and burned the city. Then they marched for seven days, arriving at Niš on 3 July. There, the commander of Niš promised to provide escort for Peter's army to Constantinople as well as food, if he would leave right away. Peter obliged, and the next morning he set out. However, a few Germans got into a dispute with some locals along the road and set fire to a mill, which escalated out of Peter's control until Niš sent out its entire garrison against the crusaders. The crusaders were completely routed, losing about 10,000 (a quarter of their number), the remainder regrouping further on at Bela Palanka. When they reached Sofia on 12 July they met their Byzantine escort, which brought them safely the rest of the way to Constantinople by 1 August.  Leadership breakdown  Byzantine Emperor Alexius I Comnenus, not knowing what else to do with such an unusual and unexpected \\"army\\", quickly ferried all 30,000 across the Bosporus by 6 August.J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Decline and Fall, 34 It has since been debated whether he sent them away without Byzantine guides knowing full well that they could be slaughtered by the Turks, or whether they insisted on continuing into Asia Minor despite his warnings. In any case, it is known that Alexius warned Peter not to engage the Turks, whom he believed to be superior to Peter's motley army, and to wait for the main body of crusaders, which was still on the way.http://historymedren.about.com/od/firstcrusade/p/The-Peoples- Crusade.htm The People's Crusade History Peter was rejoined by the French under Walter Sans-Avoir and a number of bands of Italian crusaders who had arrived at the same time. Once in Asia Minor, they began to pillage towns and villages until they reached Nicomedia, where an argument broke out between the Germans and Italians on one side and the French on the other. The Germans and Italians split off and elected a new leader, an Italian named Rainald, while for the French, Geoffrey Burel took command. Peter had effectively lost control of the crusade. Even though Alexius had urged Peter to wait for the main army, Peter had lost much of his authority and the crusaders spurred each other on, moving more boldly against nearby towns until finally the French reached the edge of Nicaea, a Seljuk stronghold and provincial capital, where they pillaged the suburbs. The Germans, not to be outdone, marched with 6,000 crusaders on Xerigordos and captured the fortress to use as a base to raid the countryside. In response, the Turks, led by one of Kilij Arslan's generals, recovered Xerigordos from the crusaders, who were forced to drink the blood of donkeys and their own urine during the siege, since their water supply was cut. Some of the crusaders who were captured converted to Islam and were sent to Khorasan, while others who refused to abandon their faith were killed.Steven Runciman, The First Crusade, pg. 59  Battle and outcome  Back at the main crusaders' camp, two Turkish spies had spread rumors that the Germans who had taken Xerigordos had also taken Nicaea, which caused excitement to get there as soon as possible to share in the looting. The Turks were waiting on the road to Nicaea. Peter the Hermit had gone back to Constantinople to arrange for supplies and was due back soon, and most of the leaders argued to wait for him to return (which he never did). However, Geoffrey Burel, who had popular support among the masses, argued that it would be cowardly to wait, and they should move against the Turks right away. His will prevailed and, on the morning of 21 October, the entire army of 20,000 marched out toward Nicaea, leaving women, children, the old and the sick behind at the camp. Three miles from the camp, where the road entered a narrow, wooded valley near the village of Dracon, the Turkish army was waiting. When approaching the valley, the crusaders marched noisily and were immediately subjected to a hail of arrows.Steven Runciman, The First Crusade, pg. 60 Panic set in immediately and within minutes, the army was in full rout back to the camp. Most of the crusaders were slaughtered; however, women, children, and those who surrendered were spared. Three thousand, including Geoffrey Burel, were able to obtain refuge in an abandoned castle. Eventually the Byzantines under Constantine Katakalon sailed over and raised the siege; these few thousand returned to Constantinople, the only survivors of the People's Crusade.Skoulatos, Basile (1980).

After smaller releases such as Tripfish 2 or Another High-Caliber Mechanical Complication, their breakthrough came in 2002 when they released their critically acclaimed demo Variform at Assembly 2002. Despite only achieving third place, the demo became one of the most widely known and top rated demos ever released, winning three Scene.org awards. Further major demos to be released later included Protozoa (ranked 6th at Breakpoint 2003) and A Significant Deformation Near The Cranium, released at Assembly 2003.

These restored nutrients include iron and B vitamins (folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, and thiamine). Calcium may also be supplemented. The purpose of enriching flour is to replenish the nutrients in the flour to match the nutritional status of the unrefined product. This differentiates enrichment from fortification, which is the process of introducing new nutrients to a food.  History  White flour became adopted in many cultures because it was recognized as being healthier than dark flours during the late Middle Ages. The unknown factor for its benefit at that time was that mold and fungus in the grains, which led to several diseases, were eliminated in the processing that resulted in white flour. In the 1920s, Benjamin R. Jacobs began to document the loss of essential nutrients, however, through this processing of cereals and grains and to demonstrate a method by which the end products could be enriched with the lost nutrients. These nutrients promote good health and help to prevent some diseases. The international effort to start enriching flour was launched during the 1940s as a means to improve the health of the wartime populations of the British and United States while food was being rationed and alternative sources of the nutrients were scarce. The decision to choose flour for enrichment was based on its commonality in the diets of those wartime populations, ranging from the rich to the poor. A major factor in the switch to enriched flour in the United States was the U.S. Army's restriction in 1942, that it would purchase only enriched flour.  Flour processing and nutrient loss  The conversion of grains to flour involves several steps that vary with the type of grain used. The initial stages of processing remove the bran and the germ of the seed. The bran is the outermost layer of grains that contains fiber (primarily insoluble), some protein, and trace minerals. The germ is the embryo of the seed that contains B vitamins and trace minerals. Because the germ has a fat content of 10%, it may reduce shelf-life. Thus, it is separated to ensure longer shelf life of the flour. In contrast to enriched flour, whole wheat flour contains both the bran and the germ. The remaining and largest portion of the seed is the endosperm. It acts as a nutrient reservoir for the developing embryo. The endosperm contains a large amount of carbohydrates, protein, iron, B vitamins (niacin and riboflavin), and soluble fiber. Once the endosperm is isolated, it is ground into a fine powder and sifted to remove any remaining fragments of bran or germ. Next, a chemical bleaching process is used to give the flour a whiter color. This bleaching step, usually with chlorine or benzoyl peroxide, destroys many of the original nutrients that were present in the flour. The final flour product contains a smaller portion of the original nutrients that were present in the seed prior to processing. Enrichment ensures that these important nutrients are restored to improve the quality of the flour.  Enrichment requirements  According to the U.S. FDA, a pound of enriched flour must have the following quantities of nutrients to qualify: 2.9 milligrams of thiamin, 1.8 milligrams of riboflavin, 24 milligrams of niacin, 0.7 milligrams of folic acid, and 20 milligrams of iron. The first four nutrients are B vitamins. Calcium also may be added; this must be to a minimum level of 960 milligrams per pound if calcium is mentioned in the labeling. Other countries also have flour enrichment programs. See also * Iodised salt - which might be called \\"Fortified salt\\".

Although it could theoretically describe any mathematical model, it was originally created with the Physiome Project in mind, and hence used primarily to describe models relevant to the field of biology. This is reflected in its name CellML, although this is simply a name, not an abbreviation. CellML is growing in popularity as a portable description format for computational models, and groups throughout the world are using CellML for modelling or developing software tools based on CellML. CellML is similar to Systems Biology Markup Language SBML but provides greater scope for model modularity and reuse, and is not specific to descriptions of biochemistry.  History  The CellML language grew from a need to share models of cardiac cell dynamics among researchers at a number of sites across the world. The original working group formed in 1998 consisted of David Bullivant, Warren Hedley, and Poul Nielsen; all three were at that time members of the Department of Engineering Science at the University of Auckland. The language was an application of the XML specification developed by the World Wide Web Consortium – the decision to use XML was based on late 1998 recommendations from Warren Hedley and André (David) Nickerson. Existing XML-based languages were leveraged to describe the mathematics (content MathML), metadata (RDF), and links between resources (XLink). The CellML working group first became aware of the SBML effort in late 2000, when Warren Hedley attended the 2nd workshop on Software Platforms for Systems Biology in Tokyo. The working group collaborated with a number of researchers at Physiome Sciences Inc. (particularly Melanie Nelson, Scott Lett, Mark Grehlinger, Prasad Ramakrishna, Jeremy Rice, Adam Muzikant, and Kam-Chuen Jim) to draft the initial CellML 1.0 specification, which was published on the 11th of August 2001. This first draft was followed by specifications for CellML Metadata and an update to CellML to accommodate structured nesting of models with the addition of the element. Physiome Sciences Inc. also produced the first CellML capable software. The National Resource for Cell Analysis and Modeling (NRCAM) at the University of Connecticut Health Center also produced early CellML capable software called Virtual Cell. In 2002 the CellML 1.1 specification was written, in which imports were added. Imports provide the ability to incorporate external components into a model, enabling modular modelling. This specification was frozen in early 2006. Work has continued on metadata and other specifications. In July 2009 the CellML website was completely revamped, and an initial version of the new CellML repository software (PMR2) was released.  The structure of a CellML model  A CellML model consists of a number of components, each described in their own component element. A component can be an entirely conceptual entity created for modelling convenience, or it can have some real physical interpretation (for example, it could represent the cell membrane). Each component contains a number of variables, which must be declared by placing a variable element inside the component. For example, a component representing a cell membrane may have a variable called V representing the potential difference (voltage) across the cell membrane. Mathematical relationships between variables are expressed within components, using MathML. MathML is used to make declarative expressions (as opposed to procedural statements as in a computer programming language). However, most CellML processing software will only accept a limited of range of mathematics (for example, some processing software requires equations with a single variable on one side of an equality). The choice of MathML makes CellML particularly suited for describing models containing differential equations. There is no mechanism for the expression of stochastic models or any other form of randomness. Components can be connected in other components using a connection element, which describes the name of two components to be connected, and the variables in the first component which are mapped to variables in the second component. Such connections are a statement that the variable in one component is equivalent to another variable in another component. CellML models also allow relationships between components to be expressed. The CellML specification defines two types of relationship, encapsulation and containment, however more can be defined by the user. The containment relationship is used to express that one component is physically within another. The encapsulation relationship is special because it is the only relationship that affects the interpretation of the rest of the model. The effect of encapsulation is that components encapsulated beneath other components are private and cannot be accessed except by the component directly above in the encapsulation tree. The modeller is free to use encapsulation as a conceptual tool, and it does not necessarily have any physical interpretation.  Specifications  CellML is defined by core specifications as well as additional specifications for metadata, used to annotate models and specify simulations. = CellML 1.0 = CellML 1.0 was the first final specification, and is used to describe many of the models in the CellML Model Repository. CellML 1.0 has some biochemistry specific elements for describing the role of variables in a reaction model. = CellML 1.1 = CellML 1.1 introduced the ability to import components and units. In order to fully support this feature, variables in CellML 1.1 accept variable names as initial values. = Metadata specifications = CellML has several metadata specifications, used to annotate models or provide information for running and/or visualizing simulations of models. * The metadata 1.0 specification is used to annotate models with a variety of information; relevant references, authorship information, the species the model is relevant to, and so on. * Simulation metadata provides the information required to reproduce specific simulations using a CellML model. * Graphing metadata provides information to specify particular visualizations of simulation output, for example to reproduce a particular graph from a paper.  CellML.org  CellML.org aims to provide a focal point for the CellML community. Members can submit, review, and update models and receive feedback and help from the community. A CellML discussion mailing list can be found at CellML-discussion mailing list. The scope of this mailing list includes everything related to the development and use of CellML. A repository of several hundred biological models encoded into CellML can be found on the CellML community website at CellML Model Repository. These models are actively undergoing a curation process aiming to provide annotations with biological ontologies such as Gene Ontology and to validate the models against standards of unit balance and biophysical constrains such as conservation of mass, charge, energy etc. References  External links  *CellML homepage *IUPS Physiome Project *Physiome JAPAN Project *Interactive cell models Java versions of many of CellmL cardiac models.

Modern versions often consist of flexible metal or composite materials (fiberglass or carbon fiber).  Applications  =Traditional= Reed valves, normally a leather flap covering a hole, are amongst the earliest form of automatic flow control for liquids and gases. They have been used for thousands of years in water pumps and for hundreds of years in bellows for high-temperature forges and musical instruments such as church organs and accordions. In nature, heart valves operate in a somewhat similar fashion. =Pumps= Reed valves are used in some reciprocating compressor designs, and in the pumping element of some musical instruments, large and small. =Two-stroke engines= A pair of Malossi reed valve blades made from carbon fibre Reed valves are commonly used in high-performance versions of the two-stroke engine, where they control the fuel-air mixture admitted to the cylinder. As the piston rises in the cylinder a vacuum is created in the crankcase beneath the piston. The resulting pressure differential opens the valve and the fuel-air mixture flows into the crankcase. As the piston descends, it raises the crankcase pressure causing the valve to close to retain the mixture and pressurize it for its eventual transfer through to the combustion chamber.Motorcycle Mechanics Institute,The Complete Guide to Motorcycle Mechanics, 1984, p. 79-80, Prentice-Hall, Inc., The Swedish motorcycle company Husqvarna produced a two-stroke, 500 cc displacement single cylinder engine with a reed-valve controlled intake, one of the biggest in using this arrangement. Reed valves in two-stroke engines have been placed in the intake ports and also in controlling the intake to the crankshaft space. Composite materials are preferred in racing engines, especially in kart racing, because the stiffness of the petals can be easily tuned and they are relatively safe in failure. High-speed impact takes its toll on all reed valves, with metal valves suffering in fatigue. The physical inertia of reed valves means that they are not as entirely precise in action as rotary valves, a rotary valve engine may run better than a reed valve engine at a small rpm range but the reed valve engine often runs better over a wider rpm range. More sophisticated designs partly address this by creating multi-stage reeds with smaller, more responsive reeds within larger ones that provide more volume later in the cycle. Nevertheless, current technology favors reed valves almost to the exclusion of rotary valves due to their simplicity and low implementation costs and less rotational mass. =Wankel rotary combustion engines= Yanmar Diesel, a Japanese engine maker, was pioneer in introducing reed valves for flow control at intake ports of its small Wankel engines, showing an improvement in torque and performances at low rpm and under partial load of the engine. Toyota discovered the benefits of injecting fresh air into the Wankel RCE exhaust port, and also used a reed valve in prototypes where they tested the SCRE concept (Stratified Charge Rotary Engine). However, this kind of intake port arrangement never reached the production line for automobile size RCEs. According to David W. Garside, who developed the Norton line of Wankel-powered motorcycles, data from other RCE producers pointed that reed valves do improve performances at low rpm and under partial load, but reduce the high speed power output of the engine, a feature considered inconvenient for motorcycle engines. =Pulse jets= Reed valves are used in the cheap but inefficient pulse jet engine, such as the one used by the Argus As 014 engine in the German V-1 (flying bomb). The valves at the front of the cylindrical engine are opened by the low pressure in the combustion chamber caused by the resonance of the air column in the engine, fuel is squirted into the combustion chamber and ignited by the hot combustion gases of the previous cycle. Once the charge has expanded and mostly left the engine, pressure inside drops again to below-atmospheric values and the reed valve allows fresh air to enter and the cycle be repeated. Some ram-air pressure due to forward motion helps scavenging and filling the combustion chamber with the new, fresh air charge, thus improving the power of the engine at higher speeds.  Design and modelling  Reed valves are designed considering the pressure gradient and mass flow.Gordon P. Blair,The Basic Design of Two Stroke Engines, 1990, Society of Automotive Engineers Inc., The pressure gradient is used to evaluate the valve lift during open condition; the lift and overall component geometry (considering also a pressure loss coefficient) are then used to calculate the mass flow. For high speed applications (compressors and engines) the dynamic response has to be considered. A simple approach consists in the evaluation of first eigenvalue that is compared with exciting frequency. Design of reed valves can be refined using simulations. The dynamic of petals can be studied neglecting the coupling between fluid and structure: in this case the evolution of the structural part are simulated using lumped parameters models or FEM models, discharge coefficients at various valve lift are evaluated with experiments or CFD simulations. The study of the complete system needs an integrated Fluid- structure interaction model.

He is famous for the winged keel design applied to Australia II which, in 1983, became the first non-American yacht to win the prestigious America's Cup in 132 years. Early life Born in the small town of Boggabri, New South Wales on 19 March 1936. After his parents, labourer Edward William Miller and Ethel Doreen, née Green abandoned him as a child he stayed briefly at Boys’ Town, Engadine, before going to his grandfather at Newcastle. He left school at age 14 to pursue a locomotive mechanic's apprenticeship but soon found his attention turning to sailboats. At 16, he designed his first sailboat The Comet with his friend William Bennett in Hamilton, NSW, and began to make a name for himself in local competition. Miller did his sailmaking apprenticeship with Norman Wright in Queensland. Miller's designs were highly innovative. His entry, \\"Taipan\\" in the 1960JJ Giltinan International Trophy 18Footer World Championship started the modern era of the class and Miller won the World Championship in 1961JJ Giltinan International Trophy with the successor, \\"Venom\\". With friend Craig Whitworth, he founded a boat-building, sail-making and ship-chandlery firm (Miller and Whitworth) and designed boats part-time as well. One of his lasting early successes was the design that became the International Contender. It was selected in 1967, in multi boat trials, as a potential Olympic successor to the Finn dinghy. The Contender was awarded International status in 1968 and now has fleets in more than twelve countries throughout the world. His keelboat designs of the early 1970s featured clean, easily driven hulls and relatively small sail area. He had great success with a series of these designs starting with the innovative \\"Ginkgo\\".http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lexcen-benjamin-ben-14154 Miller competed in the 1972 Munich Olympics representing Australia in sailing with Denis O'Neil and Ken Berkeley as fellow crew members. America's Cup Miller was commissioned by Alan Bond to build Apollo,http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lexcen-benjamin-ben-14154 an ocean racer. This partnership continued when Bond first challenged for the America's Cup in 1974 with the Miller-designed 12-metre class yacht Southern Cross, named for the southern hemisphere constellation. Their challenge for the Cup was unsuccessful but Miller was kept on as the designer for future yachts, all of them designed to the 12-metre class rules as used for America's Cup competition at the time. During the first years of his partnership with Bond, Miller withdrew his partnership from his sail-making company but the company retained its name of Miller and Whitworth. Soon after the 1974 Cup challenge, Miller changed his name to avoid confusion with his former company. Keen to prevent the possibility of there being any confusion surrounding his name and business interests in the future, he asked a friend who worked for Reader's Digest to find out the least-used surname within their membership. The result was Lexcen. \\"Ben\\" was the name of his dog. Bond challenged for the 1977 America's Cup using the Lexcen and Johan Valentijn designed 12M Australia against media mogul Ted Turner and again with a Lexcen modified Australia in 1980 against Dennis Connor, losing both times. The winged keel of Australia II After the 1980 challenge Lexcen realised that to win against the defenders, with their 100+ years of America's Cup experience, they would need a superior boat. His next design featured a host of advanced design features, not the least of which was a revolutionary winged keel, intended to lower the drag and to make the boat more stable and maneuverable in the water. The keel design reduced tip vortex, a turbulence resulting in conventional keels from the pressure differential between the windward (low pressure) and leeward (high pressure) sides. Australia II's design was to prove highly controversial, protested because some part of the design was done before and during the testing of the keel by Netherlands tank testing facility. Australia II was a revolutionary design approach with her winged keel and hull design comprising the shortest waterline length ever measured on a 12-metre. To yachtsmen accustomed to seeing racing yachts out of the water, Australia II is striking. Its conventional long slim topsides flare down to a short waterline hinting at the dramatic, minimal, slippery underwater hull shape which was fast to turn as well as easily driven and quick to accelerate. Ben often remarked that Australia II is a whole boat, not just a keel. The New York Yacht Club, holders of the Cup, formally protested both that Australia II was not a legal 12 Metre, and that the design itself was not of Australian origin. The ruling arrived at on the boat confirmed that Australia II complied with both the 12-metre class and the America's Cup rules. The questions on her design origin were not formally answered at the time, but the controversy re-emerged in 2009 (see Later claims of Dutch Design for details). Claims that Peter van Oossanen was the designer of the Australia II's keel instead of by Ben have been strongly rejected by John Bertrand and by John Longley, a key member of the Australia II team using documentary evidence.> The 1983 America's Cup saw Lexcen's Australia II, with John Bertrand at the helm, take on the NYYC skipper Dennis Conner and the defender yacht, Liberty. The Australians were sure they had a fast boat. Australia II had dominated the challenger eliminations just as Liberty had dominated the closer defender trials, honing her tuning and performance. But mechanical failures on Australia II and skillful sailing by the defenders caused Australia II to fall behind, losing the first two races. Australia II stormed back to take three of the next four. Dennis Conner had creatively registered three different configurations (sail area, spar length and ballast) for Liberty and he successfully called for lay days to choose advantageous weather to suit his most competitive versions of the boat. This was the first time in history that the series depended on the result of the last race, and the pressure of defending the Cup was now firmly on Liberty. In the deciding race on 26 September, Conner prepared Liberty in her very competitive light weather configuration with big sail area and low weight. Australia II won the start and held an early lead but was overtaken by Liberty which built up a substantial margin. At the start of the penultimate leg (a square run) the breeze was very light and Liberty was vulnerable. Liberty chose a starboard tack leg and declined to cover Australia II which allowed them to run deeper and faster assisted by breeze and windshifts allowing Australia II to overtake the Americans by the leeward mark. Liberty then engaged Australia in a spectacular tacking duel with nearly 50 tacks and a number of faked \\"dummy\\" tacks trying to break the Australians' cover. Australia II held on till both boats reached the starboard layline in amongst the spectator fleet and tacked several boat lengths ahead of Liberty and sailed to the finish to take the race. Australia II became the first challenger to wrest the Cup from the United States since its inception in 1870. Lexcen was made a Member of the Order of Australia for his contributions to the winning design. Lexcen was commissioned by Bond once again in 1986 to design a defender for the 1987 America's Cup. He designed Australia III and Australia IV for Bond's two boat defense program. Australia IV was ultimately defeated by the Iain Murray designed and skippered Kookaburra III in the Defender Trials. Steve Ward (builder of all four \\"Australias\\" maintains that Lexen's design was not at fault but that Australia IV was uncompetitive due to last minute design modifications ordered by the upper echelons of Bond Corporation. Australia IV was originally designed to be longer on the waterline with less sail area similar to Conner's winning design. Australia competed in the Cup without a Lexcen designed boat for the first time in ten years. Kookaburra III lost in the finals to Dennis Conner and his American challenger, Stars & Stripes 87, 4 races to nil. Death Lexcen died suddenly in Manly, New South Wales on 1 May 1988, of a heart attack at 52 years of age. He is buried at Frenchs Forest Cemetery located in Davidson, New South Wales. Legacy In 1988, the Toyota Lexcen was released by Toyota Australia in Ben Lexcen's honour. The car was a rebadged Holden VN Commodore and was built in Australia under the Button Plan. Production lasted until 1997. In 1988 the University of New South Wales named its newly created sports scholarships the Ben Lexcen Sports Scholarships. These scholarships were the first sports scholarships to be offered by an Australian university.https://www.recordkeeping.unsw.edu.au/historicalresources/onlineexhibitions/unitimelineexhibition/1980s.html#1987 In 2006, Lexcen was posthumously inducted into the America's Cup Hall of Fame.

Construction and commissioning Pilotfish was laid down by the Portsmouth Navy Yard, in Kittery, Maine, 15 May 1943; launched 30 August 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Martha Szolmeczka Scheutz; and commissioned 16 December 1943, Lieutenant Commander Robert H. Close in command. Operational history After underway trials, training, and shakedown in the Portsmouth area, Pilotfish departed New London 29 March 1944 for the Pacific via the Panama Canal. She reported to Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet 10 April and joined Submarine Division 202, Submarine Squadron 20. On 16 May, Pilotfish departed on her first patrol in company with and . This patrol was begun in the area west of the Mariana Islands. After a week the group sailed to an area south of Formosa and patrolled across a probable route of reinforcement or retirement of the Japanese forced engaged in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. This proved fruitless and Pilotfish set course for Majuro Atoll, Marshall Islands, arriving 4 July. Pilotfish departed on her second war patrol in the Bonin Islands area 27 July. She performed lifeguard duty in addition to offensive patrol. She returned via Midway to Pearl Harbor, 14 September. Pilotfish departed 14 October via Midway Island on her third war patrol, again in the Bonins area. On 31 October she torpedoed and damaged a 4,000-ton cargo ship. On 2 November Pilotfish proceeded to the Nansei Shoto area for the balance of the patrol. After 57 days of patrol, she returned to Midway Island, arriving 10 December. On 20 January 1945 Pilotfish departed on her fourth war patrol, in company with and . The group proceeded via Saipan to the East China Sea area, where a long patrol brought no contacts but a hospital ship and small craft. Pilotfish returned to Pearl Harbor, 25 March. On 21 May Pilotfish departed for her fifth patrol. She spent fifteen days on lifeguard duty off Marcus Island, then proceeded to Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. On 20 June Pilotfish left for the second half of her lifeguard patrol in the vicinity of the Japanese Home Islands. Pilotfish arrived Apra Harbor, Guam, 14 July. On 9 August Pilotfish departed on her sixth patrol, again to lifeguard duty. Only two days had been spent in the patrol area, southeast of Japan, when on 15 August the “Cease Firing” order arrived. Pilotfish remained on station off Kii Suido for continued lifeguard duty, and neutrality patrol. On 31 August Pilotfish rendezvoused with other ships and proceeded to Tokyo Kaiwan in order to participate in the initial occupation of Japan and the formal surrender ceremonies. The afternoon of 31 August all submarines of the formation moored alongside in Yokosuka Naval Basin. On 3 September, Pilotfish got underway for Pearl Harbor and San Francisco. Disposal By a directive dated 1 July 1946, Pilotfish was selected for disposal by use as a target for Operation Crossroads atomic bomb tests at Bikini Atoll. Moored 363 yards (332 meters) from \\"surface zero,\\" she was sunk by the Test Baker underwater atomic bomb explosion on 25 July 1946, the explosion′s pressure waves compressing her hull and forcing her hatches open, completely flooding her.Delgado, James P., Silent Killers: Submarines and Underwater Warfare, Osprey Publishing, 2012, p. 193. She was decommissioned on 29 August 1946 and was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947. Many sources claim that the wreck of Pilotfish was refloated, towed to Eniwetok Atoll, again used as an atomic bomb test target there during Operation Sandstone in 1948, and resunk off Eniwetok as a target on 16 October 1948. However, in 1991 the U.S. National Park Service reported that this narrative is incorrect, and that Pilotfish′s wreck was not salvaged after her 1946 sinking and remains on the bottom of the lagoon at Bikini Atoll.Delgado, James, P., Daniel J.

The subspace topology and product topology constructions are both special cases of initial topologies. Indeed, the initial topology construction can be viewed as a generalization of these. The dual notion is the final topology, which for a given family of functions mapping to a set X is the finest topology on X that makes those functions continuous. Definition Given a set X and an indexed family (Yi)i∈I of topological spaces with functions :f_i: X to Y_i, the initial topology tau on X is the coarsest topology on X such that each :f_i: (X,tau) to Y_i is continuous. Explicitly, the initial topology is the collection of open sets generated by all sets of the form f_i^{-1}(U), where U is an open set in Y_i for some i ∈ I, under finite intersections and arbitrary unions. The sets f_i^{-1}(U) are often called cylinder sets. If I contains exactly one element, all the open sets of (X,tau) are cylinder sets. Examples Several topological constructions can be regarded as special cases of the initial topology. * The subspace topology is the initial topology on the subspace with respect to the inclusion map. * The product topology is the initial topology with respect to the family of projection maps. * The inverse limit of any inverse system of spaces and continuous maps is the set-theoretic inverse limit together with the initial topology determined by the canonical morphisms. * The weak topology on a locally convex space is the initial topology with respect to the continuous linear forms of its dual space. * Given a family of topologies {τi} on a fixed set X the initial topology on X with respect to the functions idi : X -> (X, τi) is the supremum (or join) of the topologies {τi} in the lattice of topologies on X. That is, the initial topology τ is the topology generated by the union of the topologies {τi}. * A topological space is completely regular if and only if it has the initial topology with respect to its family of (bounded) real-valued continuous functions. * Every topological space X has the initial topology with respect to the family of continuous functions from X to the Sierpiński space. Properties =Characteristic property= The initial topology on X can be characterized by the following characteristic property: A function g from some space Z to X is continuous if and only if f_i circ g is continuous for each i ∈ I. Characteristic property of the initial topology Note that, despite looking quite similar, this is not a universal property. A categorical description is given below. =Evaluation= By the universal property of the product topology, we know that any family of continuous maps f_icolon Xto Y_i determines a unique continuous map :fcolon X to prod_i Y_i,. This map is known as the evaluation map. A family of maps {f_icolon Xto Y_i} is said to separate points in X if for all x e y in X there exists some i such that f_i(x) e f_i(y). Clearly, the family {f_i} separates points if and only if the associated evaluation map f is injective. The evaluation map f will be a topological embedding if and only if X has the initial topology determined by the maps {f_i} and this family of maps separates points in X. =Separating points from closed sets= If a space X comes equipped with a topology, it is often useful to know whether or not the topology on X is the initial topology induced by some family of maps on X. This section gives a sufficient (but not necessary) condition. A family of maps {fi: X -> Yi} separates points from closed sets in X if for all closed sets A in X and all x not in A, there exists some i such that :f_i(x) otin operatorname{cl}(f_i(A)) where cl denotes the closure operator. :Theorem. A family of continuous maps {fi: X -> Yi} separates points from closed sets if and only if the cylinder sets f_i^{-1}(U), for U open in Yi, form a base for the topology on X. It follows that whenever {fi} separates points from closed sets, the space X has the initial topology induced by the maps {fi}. The converse fails, since generally the cylinder sets will only form a subbase (and not a base) for the initial topology. If the space X is a T0 space, then any collection of maps {fi} that separates points from closed sets in X must also separate points. In this case, the evaluation map will be an embedding.  Categorical description  In the language of category theory, the initial topology construction can be described as follows. Let Y be the functor from a discrete category J to the category of topological spaces mathrm{Top} which maps jmapsto Y_j. Let U be the usual forgetful functor from mathrm{Top} to mathrm{Set}. The maps f_j:Xto Y_j can then be thought of as a cone from X to UY. That is, (X,f) is an object of mathrm{Cone}(UY):=(Deltadownarrow{UY})--the category of cones to UY. More precisely, this cone (X,f) defines a U-structured cosink in mathrm{Set}. The forgetful functor U:mathrm{Top}tomathrm{Set} induces a functor bar{U} : mathrm{Cone}(Y) to mathrm{Cone}(UY). The characteristic property of the initial topology is equivalent to the statement that there exists a universal morphism from bar{U} to (X,f), i.e.: a terminal object in the category (bar{U}downarrow(X,f)). Explicitly, this consists of an object I(X,f) in mathrm{Cone}(Y) together with a morphism varepsilon:bar{U}I(X,f)to(X,f) such that for any object (Z,g) in mathrm{Cone}(Y) and morphism varphi:bar{U}(Z,g)to(X,f) there exists a unique morphism zeta:(Z,g)to I(X,f) such that the following diagram commutes: center The assignment (X,f)mapsto I(X,f) placing the initial topology on X extends to a functor I:mathrm{Cone}(UY)tomathrm{Cone}(Y) which is right adjoint to the forgetful functor bar{U}.

Naval career  Kuper, whose ancestry was German, joined the navy in 1823 as a midshipman.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography On 20 February 1830 he became a lieutenant. On 17 October 1831 he was appointed a lieutenant in Savage, commanded by Lord Edward Russell, on the Irish station. On 9 April 1832, he followed Russell to Nimrod, off the coast of Spain. On 27 August 1833, John Macdougall succeeded Russell, still on the Spain–Portugal station. From 30 March 1836, he was a lieutenant in Minden, commanded by Alexander Renton Sharpe, at Lisbon. Then on 10 July 1837 he moved to Alligator, commanded by James John Gordon Bremer, at Australia, who was involved in founding the settlement at Port Essington. From 27 July 1839, he was a lieutenant and acting captain of Pelorous. While he was captain Pelorus wrecked on 25 November by a cyclone at Port Essington. There were no casualties and eventually she was refloated. In December 1840 he was promoted to commander, retroactive to when he took command of Pelorus. On 5 March 1840 he became Acting Captain in Alligator, and with her he participated in the First Opium War (1840–1842). On 8 June 1841 he received a promotion to captain, and on 14 June he took command of Calliope and participated in the operations that led to the capitulation of Canton, China (now Guangzhou). On 21 January 1842 he was made a Companion of the Bath (CB). From 3 July 1850 to February 1854 he was captain in Thetis from her commissioning at Plymouth. He sailed her to the south-east coast of America and then the Pacific. Kuper Island in the Strait of Georgia, off the east coast of Vancouver Island, is named for him after he surveyed the area from 1851 to 1853. From 13 August 1855 to 24 January 1856 he was a captain in HMS London in the Mediterranean. In 1861 he was promoted to rear-admiral and in 1862 he succeeded Admiral Sir James Hope as Commander-in-Chief, East Indies and China Station. His tenure coincided with the later stages of British involvement in the Taiping Rebellion. To achieve parity with the French navy, whose local commander-in- chief was a Vice-Admiral, Kuper was given temporary promotion to Vice-Admiral. In August 1863 he hoisted his flag in the wooden screw-frigate Euryalus and led a British squadron of seven warships to Kagoshima to coerce the daimyō of Satsuma into paying the £25,000 demanded by the British Government as reparation to the British victims of the Namamugi Incident. During the Bombardment of Kagoshima the captain of Euryalus, John James Steven Josling, was killed, as was his second-in-command, Commander Wilmot, both decapitated by the same cannonball. In 1864 Kuper was in command of the International fleet at the Shimonoseki Expedition, Japan, the action fought to reopen the Inland Sea and the Straits of Shimonoseki. His interpreter at Shimonoseki was Ernest Satow. Kuper was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) on 25 February 1864 'in acknowledgement of his services at Kagoshima'. In due course, i.e., on 2 June 1869, he became a Knight Grand Cross of the Bath (GCB) and promoted to the rank of vice-admiral in 1866 and to admiral in 1872.

Founded by Herbert Ingram, it appeared weekly until 1971, then less frequently thereafter, and ceased publication in 2003. The company continues today as Illustrated London News Ltd, a publishing, content, and digital agency in London, which holds the publication and business archives of the magazine. History =1842–1860: Herbert Ingram= Front cover of 1 October 1892 issue, showing a scene from Sydney Grundy and Arthur Sullivan's Haddon Hall created by M. Browne and Herbert Railton The Illustrated London News founder Herbert Ingram was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, in 1811, and opened a printing, newsagent, and bookselling business in Nottingham around 1834 in partnership with his brother-in-law, Nathaniel Cooke.Isabel Bailey, \\"Ingram, Herbert (1811–1860)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 17 September 2014] As a newsagent, Ingram was struck by the reliable increase in newspaper sales when they featured pictures and shocking stories. Ingram began to plan a weekly newspaper that would contain pictures in every edition. Ingram rented an office, recruited artists and reporters, and employed as his editor Frederick William Naylor Bayley (1808–1853), formerly editor of the National Omnibus. The first issue of The Illustrated London News appeared on Saturday, 14 May 1842, timed to report on the young Queen Victoria's first masquerade ball.James Bishop, \\"The Story of the ILN\\", Illustrated London News 150th anniversary issue, Vol. 280, No. 7106. Its 16 pages and 32 wood engravings covered topics such as the war in Afghanistan, the Versailles rail accident, a survey of the candidates for the US presidential election, extensive crime reports, theatre and book reviews, and a list of births, marriages, and deaths. Ingram hired 200 men to carry placards through the streets of London promoting the first edition of his new newspaper. Jumbo's Journey to the Docks (The Illustrated London News, 1 April 1882) Costing sixpence, the first issue sold 26,000 copies. Despite this initial success, sales of the second and subsequent editions were disappointing. However, Ingram was determined to make his newspaper a success, and sent every clergyman in the country a copy of the edition that contained illustrations of the installation of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and by this means secured a great many new subscribers. Its circulation soon increased to 40,000, and by the end of its first year was 60,000. In 1851, after the newspaper published Joseph Paxton's designs for the Crystal Palace before even Prince Albert had seen them, the circulation rose to 130,000. In 1852, when it produced a special edition covering the funeral of the Duke of Wellington, sales increased to 150,000; and in 1855, mainly due to the newspaper reproducing some of Roger Fenton's pioneering photographs of the Crimean War (and also due to the abolition of the Stamp Act that taxed newspapers), it sold 200,000 copies per week. Competitors soon began to appear; Lloyd’s Illustrated Paper was founded later that year, while Reynold's Newspaper opened in 1850; both were successful Victorian publications, albeit less successful than The Illustrated London News. Andrew Spottiswoode's Pictorial Times lost £20,000 before it was sold to Ingram by Henry Vizetelly, who had left the ILN to found it. Ingram folded it into another purchase, The Lady's Newspaper, which became The Lady's Newspaper and Pictorial Times. Vizetelly was also behind a later competitor, Illustrated Times in 1855, which was similarly bought out by Ingram in 1859. Ingram's other early collaborators left the business in the 1850s. Nathanial Cooke, his business partner and brother-in-law, found himself in a subordinate role in the business and parted on bad terms around 1854. The departure of William Little was in 1858; in addition to providing a loan of £10,000, he was the printer and publisher of the paper for 15 years. Little's relationship with Ingram deteriorated over Ingram's harassment of their mutual sister-in-law. Herbert Ingram died on 8 September 1860 in a paddle-steamer accident on Lake Michigan, and he was succeeded as proprietor by his youngest son, William, who in turn was succeeded by his son, Sir Bruce Ingram (1877–1963) in 1900, who remained as editor until his death. =1860–1900: William and Charles Ingram= By 1863, The Illustrated London News was selling more than 300,000 copies every week, enormous figures in comparison to other British newspapers of the time. The death of Herbert and his eldest son left the company without a director and manager. Control passed to Ingram's widow Ann, and his friend Sir Edward William Watkin, who managed the business for 12 years. Once Ingram's two younger sons, William and Charles, were old enough, they took over as managing directors, although William took the lead. This was also a period of expansion and increased competition for the ILN. As reading habits and the illustrated news market changed, the ILN bought or established a number of new publications, evolving from a single newspaper to a larger-scale publishing business. As with Herbert Ingram's purchases in the 1850s, this expansion was also an effective way of managing competition – dominating markets and buying out competing ventures. As with the acquisitions of the 1850s, several similar illustrated publications were established in this period by former employees of The Illustrated London News. Serious competition for the ILN appeared in 1869, with the establishment of The Graphic, a weekly illustrated paper founded by W. L. Thomas. Thomas was a former wood engraver for The Illustrated London News, and brought his expertise in illustrated publishing to his new magazine. The Graphic was highly popular, particularly for its coverage of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, and was well regarded among artists; Vincent van Gogh was a particular admirer.Mark Bills, \\"Thomas, William Luson (1830–1900)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004. William Ingram became chief proprietor of The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News (est. 1874), and The Lady's Pictorial, which may have been a later title of The Lady's Newspaper and Pictorial Times. The Penny Illustrated Paper, aimed at a working-class readership, was established by the news company shortly after Ingram's death in 1861 in response to the abolition of stamp and paper taxes, which made cheaper publications possible. The Penny Illustrated Paper ran until 1913.Morning Bulletin (Rockhampton, Qld), 17 March 1900. In 1893, the ILN established The Sketch, a sister publication that covered lighter news and society events with the same focus on illustration. From this point, the name of the company changed to the Illustrated London News and Sketch Ltd. In 1899, ILN editor Clement Shorter left the paper to found his own publication, The Sphere, which published its first issue on 27 January 1900. Ingram and The Illustrated London News responded by establishing a competing magazine, The Spear, which appeared two days before The Sphere on 25 January 1900. The name was deliberately chosen to confuse and siphon off readers, and advertisements for The Sphere emphasised the difference between the magazines: \\"S-P-H-E-R-E… you may be offered something else you don't want\\" While editor of the ILN, Clement Shorter had been instrumental in the establishment and publication of The Sketch. In 1903, he established The Tatler as a similar sister publication for The Sphere, with a similar focus on illustrated culture and society news. With the departure of Shorter, the role of editor of the ILN was taken over by Bruce Ingram, the 23-year-old grandson of the paper's founder. =1900–1963: Bruce Ingram= Cover of 20 February 1915 issue Bruce Ingram was editor of The Illustrated London News and (from 1905) The Sketch, and ran the company for the next 63 years, presiding over some significant changes in the newspaper and the publishing business as a whole. Photographic and printing techniques were advancing in the later years of the 19th century, and The Illustrated London News began to introduce photos and artwork into its depictions of weekly events. From about 1890, The Illustrated London News made increasing use of photography. The tradition of graphic illustrations continued, however, until the end of World War I. Often, rough sketches of distant events with handwritten explanations were supplied by observers and then worked on by artists in London to produce polished end products for publication. This was particularly the case where popular subjects such as colonial or foreign military campaigns did not lend themselves to clear illustration using the limited camera technology of the period. By the 1920s and 1930s, the pictures that dominated each issue of the magazine were almost exclusively photographic,\\"The Death of King George V.\\" special issue , from 25 January 1936. although artists might still be used to illustrate in pictorial form topics such as budgetry expenditure or the layout of coal mines.The Illustrated London News – Marching to War 1933–1939, In 1928, a major business merger had Illustrated London News move to new headquarters at Inveresk House, 1 Aldwych, (also known as 364 Strand), London, where The Illustrated London News and The Sketch were united with six of their former competitors under the parent company, Illustrated News Ltd. As eight of the largest titles in illustrated news, these were newly dubbed the 'Great Eight' publications. The Illustrated London News, the flagship publication, was supported by sister publications The Sketch, The Sphere, The Tatler, The Graphic, The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, The Bystander, and Eve.The Illustrated London News, issue 6, October 1928. With the exception of The Tatler, these publications remained as part of Illustrated News Ltd. until their closure at various times in the 20th century. The centenary of The Illustrated London News in 1942 was muted due to wartime conditions, including restrictions on the use of paper. The occasion was marked in the paper with a set of specially commissioned colour photographs of the royal family, including the future Queen Elizabeth.The Illustrated London News centenary issue, 16 May 1942. By the time of his death in 1963, Ingram was a major figure in the newspaper industry, and the longest-standing editor of his day. =1963–present= In the postwar period, print publications were gradually displaced from their central position in reporting news events, and circulation began to fall for all the illustrated weeklies. Many of the Great Eight publications were closed down after the Second World War; The Sketch, The Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, and The Sphere all ceased publication in these years. In 1961, Illustrated Newspapers Ltd was bought by International Thomson, headed by Roy Thomson, a Canadian newspaper mogul. The Sphere ceased publication in 1964, while The Tatler was sold in 1968 (it was later to be revived and relaunched in 1977). With circulation figures continuing to fall, The Illustrated London News switched from weekly to monthly publication in 1971, with a new focus on in-depth reporting and selective coverage of world events. This strategy continued into the late 1980s, when the paper reduced its frequency to four issues a year. In 1985, The Illustrated London News and the archives of the Great Eight publications were sold to Sea Containers, an international transport corporation headed by James Sherwood. Along with the Illustrated London News Group, Sea Containers operated the Orient Express and Great North-Eastern Railways, and a range of luxury hotels. As part of this activity, Illustrated London News Group launched a luxury travel and lifestyle magazine, Orient Express. In 1994, publication of The Illustrated London News was reduced further to two issues a year, and the publishing activity of the Illustrated London News Group focused increasingly on the Orient Express magazine. After publishing its last Christmas number in 2001, The Illustrated London News was relaunched in 2003 under the editorship of Mark Palmer, which ran for one issue before finally ceasing publication for good. The Illustrated London News Group underwent a management buy-out in 2007, and was re-established as Illustrated London News Ltd. From 2007, it has continued its activity as an independent content and creative agency. In 2007, the former Orient Express magazine was relaunched as Sphere, a luxury lifestyle and travel magazine. In addition to its independent publications, Illustrated London News Ltd now acts as a content agency for various other luxury and heritage organisations. Illustrated London News Ltd also manages and curates the newspaper and business archive of The Illustrated London News and the Great Eight publications, publishing short books and magazines of historical content from the Great Eight publication archives. In 2010, the company digitised the entire back catalogue of The Illustrated London News, and in 2014 began digitalizing the remaining seven publications in the Great Eight. To mark the centenary of the First World War in July 2014, ILN Ltd launched illustratedfirstworldwar.com, a free historical resource funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. The entire run of the Great Eight publications between 1914 and 1918 is available on this site. The company operates at 46–48 East Smithfield Street.

World War I He is unusual in having gained both the DCM and VC, and in quick succession, during the Hundred Days Offensive. =Distinguished Conduct Medal= On 10 August 1918, then a Corporal with the 1/5th Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, he was leading a daylight patrol near Hébuterne in the Somme Area of France to examine points in the German lines where information was required. As the patrol was about to retire, Ned Smith saw a party of about 40 Germans about to take up outpost duty. Despite being heavily outnumbered by the German soldiers, Corporal Smith led his small party of men and engaged the enemy, breaking up the German party and causing severe casualties. As well as receiving the Distinguished Conduct Medal for this action, Ned Smith was promoted to the rank of Lance Sergeant. =Victoria Cross= Only 11 days later, during the period 21/23 August 1918, east of Serre, France, Lance-Sergeant Smith while in command of a platoon, personally took a machine-gun post at The Lozenge (Hill 140),Frederick P.

The enemy on seeing him coming, scattered to throw hand grenades at him, but heedless of all danger and almost without halting in his rush, this NCO shot at least six of them. Later, seeing another platoon needing assistance, he led his men to them, took command and captured the objective. During an enemy counter-attack the following day he led a section forward and restored a portion of the line. According to the London Gazette Supplement of 18 October 1918: :\\"His personal bravery, skill and initiative were outstanding, and his conduct throughout an inspiring example to all.\\" Interwar According to \\"The Whitehaven News\\", a local West Cumbrian newspaper, when he returned to his home town of Maryport after the Great War in 1919, he was greeted by a cheering crowd of 6,000 people, equivalent to the town's total population at the time. Another local newspaper described Ned Smith in the following terms: :\\"Sergeant Smith is not only a VC but looks it. He is a British soldier every inch of him. He is an A1 man from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet. .... He has not only won the VC but he has a chest on which to display it.\\" He continued serving, from 1918–38, in China, Malaya and Ireland, before retiring with an Army pension having attained the rank of Regimental Sergeant Major. He then joined the Corps of Commissionaires in London for about a year. In 1921, he attended a Garden Party held at Buckingham Palace by King George V of England for Victoria Cross holders, as the youngest recipient present. He never married. World War II As war loomed in summer 1939, he re-enlisted with his former Regiment, the Lancashire Fusiliers and was among the first contingent of the British Expeditionary Force to sail for France. He was a Lieutenant and quartermaster when he died in France from a gunshot wound in the head on 12 January 1940, five months before the start of the Battle of France in May.The Times (London, England), Tuesday, 16 Jan 1940; p. 6; Issue 48514 Smith is buried at the Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemetery of Beuvry Communal Cemetery Extension.CWGC entry Notes References *Monuments to Courage (David Harvey, 1999) *The Register of the Victoria Cross (This England, 1997) External links * 1940 deaths 1898 births British Army personnel of World War I British World War I recipients of the Victoria Cross Lancashire Fusiliers soldiers Lancashire Fusiliers officers British Army personnel of World War II British military personnel killed in World War II Recipients of the Distinguished Conduct Medal People from Maryport British Army recipients of the Victoria Cross ","title":"Edward Smith (VC)"},{"id":"1197172","text":"Portrait of Hatano Hideharu Honmaru compound of Yakami Castle Hatano Hideharu (波多野 秀治 Hatano Hideharu, 1541 - June 25, 1579) was the eldest son of Hatano Harumichi and the head of Hatano clan. He was a son of Harumichi, but for an unknown reason, he was adopted as a son by Hatano Motohide. The Hatano clan had, from the time of Hideharu's grandfather Hatano Tanemichi, been retainers to the powerful Miyoshi clan and its leader Miyoshi Nagayoshi. Following tradition Hideharu had been the Miyoshi's retainer as well. The reason that such a minor clan as his had attended the Emperor Ōgimachi's coronation is believed to be due to the influence of Nagayoshi. Hideharu became independent in 1565 after Nagayoshi died capturing Yakami Castle which Hideharu took as his place of residence. The Hatano clan's land, however, was situated in the way of Oda Nobunaga's passage to Kyoto and after several battles, Hideharu surrendered to Nobunaga's general Akechi Mitsuhide. In 1576, Hideharu declared independence and turned against Nobunaga. Infuriated, Nobunaga again ordered Mitsuhide to invade Tanba Province, but Hideharu remained in the castle and held together a resistance for three years. The leader of the Hatano Clan's retainers, the Akai clan, Akai Naomasa, also known as Hatano Naomasa, died defending the Hatano stronghold of Kuroi Castle against Akechi Mitsuhide at the start of the resistance in 1576. According to a record kept by Oda clan, Mitsuhide offered his mother as a hostage to allow to Hideharu surrender with dignity. Hideharu complied knowing that he could not hold out indefinitely. However, after arriving at Azuchi Castle to offer an apology, Hideharu was executed by Nobunaga. His troops in Yakami Castle, hearing that Hideharu had been executed, killed Mitsuhide's mother. This incident strained the relationship between Nobunaga and Mitsuhide, eventually culminating in Mitsuhide killing Nobunaga at Honnō-ji in 1582. However, there is little evidence that these events actually happened and it is unlikely Mitsuhide would offer such questionable truce. After Hideharu's death, no one rose to hold together the Hatano clan and it disappeared completely.

Get Me Out of Here!. Pasquale overcame competition from butler Paul Burrell and nightclub owner Fran Cosgrave. During his time in the jungle, Pasquale had a relationship with the two emus and became famous for his use of the term \\"Jacobs\\" (for Jacobs Crackers: a rhyming slang term for testicles). He was the first celebrity to earn full stars in a bushtucker trial. The special trial involved Pasquale climbing out of an airborne helicopter and climbing down a ladder recovering the stars as he went. Later on in the show, Pasquale found himself being buried underground for five minutes with rats in a trial called Danger Down Under. Before doing the show, Pasquale made his worries about doing the show clear. He insisted it wouldn't be the bushtucker trials that worried him, rather the other 'celebrities'. He claimed to be terrible and shy when it came to meeting new people and was worried about them not liking him. For the 16-day duration of the show, Pasquale was the bookies' favourite to win. In January 2013, Pasqaule became one of twelve celebrities participating in the eighth series of Dancing on Ice, with skating partner Vicky Ogden. They were eliminated on 10 February, claiming sixth place. In January 2014, the final series of Dancing on Ice began airing on ITV. To celebrate this it was confirmed that the series was to be an \\"All-Stars\\" series, bringing back some of the past contestants including Pasquale who has been partnered with professional skater Robin Johnstone.

The production is a new take on the nativity story and was released in time for Christmas 2005. During 2005, Pasquale toured the United Kingdom with his summer tour, Does He Really Talk Like That?! which is the name of his autobiography which released in September 2006. The DVD of Pasquale's 2005 tour was released in time for Christmas 2005. Pasquale toured during 2006 with a new show The Return of the Love Monkey that was filmed in Southend, Essex, for a new DVD and that was shown on ITV in 2007. In late 2010, Joe took to the road again for his \\"Extra Sensory Pasquale\\" live show. =Allegations of plagiarism= In 2005, Stewart Lee accused Joe Pasquale of stealing the opening line of his Royal Variety performance from Michael Redmond. Lee further alleged that Pasquale sent his writers to the performances of alternative comedians to copy their jokes. Lee incorporated his criticisms of Pasquale into his 90s Comedian stage show.Youtube - Stewart Lee Joe Pasquale Joke Frank Skinner also accused Pasquale of plagiarism in 2010, in using a routine about a rollercoaster prank from one of Skinner's DVD performances.Chortle - Skinner Squeals on Joke Thief Pasquale =Other work= Pasquale wrote the musical stage version of Rentaghost which toured the UK in 2006.

The campaign, which was run by Cancer Research UK, aimed to alert men to the dangers of being overweight and to encourage exercise. The main danger highlighted by the campaign was that obesity and physical inactivity can cause cancer in men, and that the cancer caused by obesity may be prevented by a healthy diet and regular exercise. Pasquale has also supported other charities including Diabetes UK. Personal life Pasquale has overcome his fear of flying, and has now gained a pilot's licence.

The Towers offer some of the largest cliffs and most challenging rock climbing in the world, and every year a number of expeditions from all corners of the globe visit Karakoram to climb the difficult granite.http://www.pakistanalpine.com/trangotowers They are located north of Baltoro Glacier, and are part of the Baltoro Muztagh, a sub-range of the Karakoram range. The highest point in the group is the summit of Great Trango Tower at 6,286 m (20,623 ft), the east face of which features the world's greatest nearly vertical drop. Structure of the group All of the Trango Towers lie on a ridge, roughly northwest-southeast, between the Trango Glacier on the west and the Dunge Glacier on the east. Great Trango itself is a large massif, with four identifiable summits: Main (), South or Southwest (), East (), and West (). It is a complex combination of steep snow/ice gullies, steeper rock faces, and vertical to overhanging headwalls, topped by a snowy ridge system. Just northwest of Great Trango is the Trango Tower (), often called \\"Nameless Tower\\". This is a very large, pointed, rather symmetrical spire which juts out of the ridgeline. North of Trango Tower is a smaller rock spire known as \\"Trango Monk.\\" To the north of this feature, the ridge becomes less rocky and loses the large granite walls that distinguish the Trango Towers group and make them so attractive to climbers; however the summits do get higher. These summits are not usually considered part of the Trango Towers group, though they share the Trango name. Trango II () lies northwest of the Monk, and the highest summit on the ridge, Trango Ri (), lies northwest of Trango II. Just southeast of Great Trango (really a part of its southeast ridge) is the Trango Pulpit (), whose walls present similar climbing challenges to those of Great Trango itself. Further, to the south is Trango Castle (), the last large peak along the ridge before the Baltoro Glacier. Climbing history Overall, the Trango Towers group has seen some of the most difficult and significant climbs ever accomplished, due to the combination of altitude, total height of the routes, and the steepness of the rock.American Alpine Journal, 2000, pp. 86–114 All of the routes are highly technical climbs. Great Trango Tower =Great Trango= Great Trango was first climbed in 1977 by Galen Rowell, John Roskelley, Kim Schmitz, Jim Morrissey and Dennis Hennek by a route which started from the west side (Trango Glacier), and climbed a combination of ice ramps and gullies with rock faces, finishing on the upper South Face. Another long alpine route on Great Trango is on the Northwest Face, and was climbed in 1984 by Andy Selters and Scott Woolums. This is a long technical alpine climb with extensive rock and ice climbing. Big Walls: The east face of Great Trango was first climbed (to the East Summit) in 1984 by the Norwegians Hans Christian Doseth and Finn Dæhli, who both died on the descent. The first successful climb of and return from the East Summit was in 1992, by Xaver Bongard and John Middendorf, via \\"The Grand Voyage\\", a route parallel to that of the ill-fated Norwegians, and the only route ever completed up the 1,340m east-southeast headwall. These two climbs have been called \\"perhaps the hardest big-wall climbs in the world.\\"Andy Fanshawe and Stephen Venables, Himalaya Alpine Style, Hodder and Stoughton, 1995, p. 43. =Trango (Nameless) Tower= Trango (Nameless) Tower was first climbed in 1976 by the British climber Joe Brown, along with Mo Anthoine, Martin Boysen, and Malcolm Howells. There are at least eight separate routes to the summit. Trango Tower on alpinist.com After several unsuccessful attempts, the second and third ascents were achieved in 1987, with the opening of two new routes: The Slovenian Route, better known as the Yugoslav Route, a pure, clean, logical crack route on the south-southeast face, by Slavko Cankar, and Bojan Šrot, and the Great Overhanging Dihedral Route, a spectacular and technical ascent on the western pillar, by Swiss/French team Michel \\"Tchouky\\" Fauquet, Patrick Delale, Michel Piola and Stephane Schaffter. The first route that was freed (using fixed lines to return to a base each night), in 1988, was the Yugoslav Route by German team Kurt Albert, Wolfgang Güllich and Hartmut Munchenbach. Another notable route is Eternal Flame (named after a Bangles song), first climbed on 20 September 1989 by Kurt Albert, Wolfgang Güllich, Milan Sykora and Christoph Stiegler. This route ascends the South-East Face of the Tower, and was climbed almost entirely free. These climbs inaugurated an era of pure rock-climbing techniques and aesthetics on high-altitude peaks. The first female ascent, on 6 September 1990, was achieved in free climbing style, again on the Yugoslav Route, by Catherine Destivelle (with Jeff Lowe, and David Breashears filming).Catherine Destivelle and Gérard Kosicki, Rocs Nature, Denoël, 1991, p. 52. In summer 2009, Franz Hinterbrandner, Mario Walder and Alexander and Thomas Huber did the first free ascent of Eternal Flame. =Other summits= The West summit of Great Trango and the Trango Pulpit were both first climbed in 1999. The West summit was climbed by two separate teams, one American and one Russian, almost simultaneously, by parallel routes. The American team of Alex Lowe, Jared Ogden, and Mark Synnott climbed a long, bold, highly technical line which they called \\"Parallel Worlds.\\" They reported difficulties up to 5.11 and A4. The Russian team of Igor Potan'kin, Alexandr Odintsov, Ivan Samoilenko and Yuri Koshelenko climbed an equally proud route (Eclissi) and encountered similar technical challenges. Both climbs were nominated for the prestigious Piolet d'or award in 1999. The north east face on the Pulpit was climbed by a Norwegian team (\\"Norwegian Direct\\", Robert Caspersen, Gunnar Karlsen, Per L. Skjerven, and Einar Wold) over a total of 38 days on the wall. The team reported of difficulties up to A4/5.11. Other route over Trango Pulpit is More Czech Less Slovak route VII 7-UIAA A2 (Southeast Ridge). It was climbed 1999 Czechoslovak team (Ivo Wondracek, Tomas Rinn, Pavel Weisser, Jaro Dutka, and Michal Drasar). =BASE jump= On 26 August 1992, Australians Nic Feteris and Glenn Singleman climbed Great Trango and then BASE jumped from an elevation of 5,955 metres (19,537 ft) from the Northeast Face (on the other side of the Norwegian Pillar from the 1,340 metre East Face wall), landing on the northern side of the Dunge Glacier at an altitude of 4,200 metres (13,779 ft). This was the highest starting elevation for a BASE jump on record. The world record for a BASE jump starting elevation is held by Valery Rozov for the jump from a point 7,220m (23,680 ft) from Everest on 28 May 2013. Glenn Singleman and partner Heather Swan previously held the record, for their jump from 6604 meters (21,667 ft) from Meru Peak in northern India on 23 May 2006. On 10 August 2013 Andrey Lebedev and Vladimir Murzaev performed a base jump from the same location as Feteris and Singleman on a low budget and with little fanfare. =Recent ascents= Some more recent ascents on Great Trango have focused on the longer routes found on the west and south sides. In particular, in 2004 Josh Wharton and Kelly Cordes completed a new, very long (2,256 metre/7,400 ft) route on the Southwest Ridge, or Azeem Ridge, to the Southwest Summit. Though not as extremely technical as the East Face routes, the climb was notable for the extremely lightweight and fast (5 days) style in which it was done.American Alpine Journal, 2005. Over 7 days in August 2005, two Slovak climbers, Gabo Cmarik and Jozef Kopold, climbed a new route, which they termed Assalam Alaikum, to the right of the Wharton/Cordes line on the south face of Great Trango. The climb comprised around 90 pitches, up to 5.11d A2. They used a lightweight style similar to that of Wharton and Cordes.Cmarik/Kopold route on alpinist.com In the same month, Samuel Johnson, Jonathon Clearwater and Jeremy Frimer made the first ascent of the southwest ridge of Trango II, which they termed Severance Ridge. The route involved 1,600 m of climbing over five days, with rock climbing up to 5.11 A2 and ice and mixed climbing up to AI3 M5. Trango II route on alpinist.com Also in August 2005, a South African team, composed of Peter Lazarus, Marianne Pretorius, James Pitman and Andreas Kiefer, climbed to the summit via the Slovenian route. Pretorius was the third woman to reach the summit.South Africans take Trango Tower - SouthAfrica.info During May/June 2008, the Norwegian route on the east face of Great Trango (1984) was repeated by the four Norwegian climbers Rolf Bae, Bjarte Bø, Sigurd Felde and Stein-Ivar Gravdal, spending 27 days in the wall to reach the summit, and three more days for the descent. This is reportedly the first repetition of the route, and thus also the first successful ascent and return.Norwegians repeat historic Trango route - Climbing magazine Rolf Bae died later that summer. He was one of 11 climbers who were killed in the 2008 K2 disaster. In mid August 2009, Alexander and Thomas Huber managed to make an all free ascent of \\"Eternal Flame\\" on Nameless Tower, with climbing up to French grade 7c+. In popular culture The Trango Towers were mentioned in the 2015 Hollywood movie Point Break as one of the possible locations for a task by extreme poly athletes as part of Ozaki 8, a list of eight extreme ordeals to honor the forces of nature in their bid to achieve Nirvana.

It differs from a natural language argument in that it is rigorous, unambiguous and mechanically checkable. If the set of assumptions is empty, then the last sentence in a formal proof is called a theorem of the formal system. The notion of theorem is not in general effective, therefore there may be no method by which we can always find a proof of a given sentence or determine that none exists. The concepts of Fitch-style proof, sequent calculus and natural deduction are generalizations of the concept of proof.The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, deduction The theorem is a syntactic consequence of all the well-formed formulas preceding it in the proof. For a well-formed formula to qualify as part of a proof, it must be the result of applying a rule of the deductive apparatus (of some formal system) to the previous well-formed formulas in the proof sequence. Formal proofs often are constructed with the help of computers in interactive theorem proving (e.g., through the use of proof checker and automated theorem prover). Significantly, these proofs can be checked automatically, also by computer. Checking formal proofs is usually simple, while the problem of finding proofs (automated theorem proving) is usually computationally intractable and/or only semi-decidable, depending upon the formal system in use.  Background  = Formal language = A formal language is a set of finite sequences of symbols. Such a language can be defined without reference to any meanings of any of its expressions; it can exist before any interpretation is assigned to it - that is, before it has any meaning. Formal proofs are expressed in some formal languages. = Formal grammar = A formal grammar (also called formation rules) is a precise description of the well- formed formulas of a formal language. It is synonymous with the set of strings over the alphabet of the formal language which constitute well formed formulas. However, it does not describe their semantics (i.e. what they mean). = Formal systems = A formal system (also called a logical calculus, or a logical system) consists of a formal language together with a deductive apparatus (also called a deductive system). The deductive apparatus may consist of a set of transformation rules (also called inference rules) or a set of axioms, or have both. A formal system is used to derive one expression from one or more other expressions. = Interpretations = An interpretation of a formal system is the assignment of meanings to the symbols, and truth values to the sentences of a formal system. The study of interpretations is called formal semantics. Giving an interpretation is synonymous with constructing a model.

Early life and career Born in Dublin on 18 November 1826, Smith was commissioned as an ensign into the 1st Regiment of Foot (Royal Scots) on 1 January 1849. He was promoted to lieutenant on 30 April 1852. He saw action during the Crimean War at Alma, Inkerman and Sebastopol and was promoted to captain on 30 March 1855. He later transferred to the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot.Findagrave Victoria Cross Smith was 37 years old, and a captain in the 43rd (Monmouthshire) Regiment of Foot (later the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry), during the Waikato-Hauhau Maori War in New Zealand. The 68th (Durham) Regiment of Foot (Light Infantry) with a detachment of the 43rd commanded by Smith was deployed to attack an entrenchment held by the Māori. The following deed took place during the attack on 21 June 1864 at Tauranga for which he was awarded the VC.Ireland's VCs (Dept of Economic Development, 1995) In the charge he was struck by a bullet which lodged in the upper part of his leg. He continued to lead his men and was the first man into the entrenchment. Following fierce fighting, the Māori having sustained heavy casualties were driven from their position. In the attack Smith killed one of the Māori Chiefs and took possession of his baton known as a Mere. The Chief's family subsequently offered substantial sums of money to retrieve the Mere. After Smith's death the Mere was eventually returned to a museum in New Zealand; a relic of the British Army's wars in that country. He was also mentioned in despatches. Later career He later achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel.

Early life William Henry Quilliam was born at 22 Eliot Street, Liverpool, on 10 April 1856, to a wealthy local family. He spent most of his childhood on the Isle of Man and was brought up as a Methodist. He was educated at the Liverpool Institute and the Manx King William's College. He became a solicitor in 1878, specialising in criminal law, and practising at 28 Church Street, Liverpool. He defended suspects in many high-profile murder cases. In 1879 he married Hannah Johnstone. At this time, Quilliam was a Wesleyan and a proponent of the temperance movement in the United Kingdom. Conversion to Islam 8 Brougham Terrace, home of the Liverpool Muslim Institute Quilliam converted to Islam in 1887 after visiting Morocco to recover from an illness. Quilliam purchased numbers 8, 11 and 12 Brougham Terrace, Liverpool, following his conversion, thanks to a donation from Nasrullah Khan, Crown Prince of Afghanistan. 8 Brougham Terrace became the Liverpool Muslim Institute, the first functioning mosque in Britain; it opened on Christmas Day, 1889. Quilliam also opened a boarding school for boys and a day school for girls, as well as an orphanage, Medina House, for non-Muslim parents who were unable to look after their children and agreed for them to be brought up as Muslims. In addition, the Institute hosted educational classes covering a wide range of subjects, and included a museum and science laboratory. In 1889, he first published The Faith of Islam, which was concerned with dawah to Islam and its key principles. Initially, 2000 copies were published, but a further 3000 copies were produced in 1890. Quilliam also published The Crescent, a weekly account of Muslims in Britain, and Islamic World, a monthly publication with a worldwide audience. In 1890, Quilliam orchestrated protests against the showing of Hall Caine's play, Mahomet. The first public Muslim burial in Liverpool was of Michael Hall, a former Methodist preacher who had converted to Islam, in 1891. A number of notables converted to Islam as a result of Quilliam's preaching. They included professors Nasrullah Warren and Haschem Wilde, as well as Robert Stanley, JP and former mayor of Stalybridge. It is estimated that around 600 people converted to Islam in Britain as a direct result of Quilliam's work. Quilliam's unmarked grave is in this small area of the Muslim Section of Brookwood Cemetery He travelled extensively and received many honours from the leaders of the Islamic world. Abdul Hamid II, the 26th Ottoman Caliph, granted Quilliam the title of Shaykh al-Islām for the British Isles. The Emir of Afghanistan recognised him as the Sheikh of Muslims in Britain and he was appointed as Persian Vice Consul in Liverpool by the Shah. He had contact with English-speaking West African Muslims and toured the region's coastal cities on his way to Lagos to attend the consecration of the Shitta Bey Mosque in 1894.Singleton, Brent D. (September 2009) \\"'That Ye May Know Each Other': Late Victorian Interactions between British and West African Muslims,\\" Journal of Muslim Minority Affairs vol. 29, issue 3, pp. 387–403. Quilliam's work in Liverpool stopped when he left England in 1908 in advance of being struck off the Roll of Solicitors for unprofessional conduct as a solicitor.Straits Times 1 July 1932 \\"The statutory committee of the Law Society found that when he was acting for a woman who was petitioning for a divorce on the grounds of cruelty and adultery, Quilliam instigated and connived at the act of a man who induced the husband to commit adultery and presented to the court a case which he knew to be false.\\" gives details of the divorce case of Martha May & Enoch Griffiths Thompson His son swiftly disposed of the property that had been used as a mosque and Islamic centre. Without Quilliam's influence and funding, the Muslim community in Liverpool dispersed. He returned to the UK before December 1914 under the name of H. M. Leon.http://www.wokingmuslim.org/work/bm-soc1.htm (a Henri Mustapha Leon, aged 55, living in St Pancras, London, appears in the Census of April 1911) He spent much of his time at Onchan on the Isle of Man. He died in Taviton Street, Bloomsbury, London in 1932, and was buried in an unmarked grave at Brookwood Cemetery near Woking. The prominent Anglo-Muslims Abdullah Yusuf Ali, Muhammad Marmaduke Pickthall (who each translated the Qur'an), and Lord Headley were later buried near him. Political views Quilliam argued that Muslims should not fight Muslims on behalf of European powers. He denounced British foreign policy in Sudan.In the name of God, Most Compassionate, Most Merciful! Peace be to all True-Believers to whom this shall come! Know ye, O Muslims, that the British Government has decided to commence military and warlike operations against the Muslims of the Soudan, who have taken up arms to defend their country and their faith. And it is in contemplation to employ Muslim soldiers to fight against these Muslims of the Soudan. For any True Believer to take up arms and fight against another Muslim is contrary to the Shariat, and against the law of God and his holy prophet. I warn every True- Believer that if he gives the slightest assistance in this projected expedition against the Muslims of the Soudan, even to the extent of carrying a parcel, or giving a bite of bread to eat or a drink of water to any person taking part in the expedition against these Muslims that he thereby helps the Giaour against the Muslim, and his name will be unworthy to be continued upon the roll of the faithful.

Direct digital synthesis (DDS) is a method employed by frequency synthesizers used for creating arbitrary waveforms from a single, fixed-frequency reference clock. DDS is used in applications such as signal generation, local oscillators in communication systems, function generators, mixers, modulators, sound synthesizers and as part of a digital phase-locked loop. Overview Figure 1 - Direct Digital Synthesizer block diagram A basic Direct Digital Synthesizer consists of a frequency reference (often a crystal or SAW oscillator), a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) and a digital- to-analog converter (DAC) as shown in Figure 1. The reference oscillator provides a stable time base for the system and determines the frequency accuracy of the DDS. It provides the clock to the NCO, which produces at its output a discrete-time, quantized version of the desired output waveform (often a sinusoid) whose period is controlled by the digital word contained in the Frequency Control Register. The sampled, digital waveform is converted to an analog waveform by the DAC. The output reconstruction filter rejects the spectral replicas produced by the zero-order hold inherent in the analog conversion process.  Performance  A DDS has many advantages over its analog counterpart, the phase-locked loop (PLL), including much better frequency agility, improved phase noise, and precise control of the output phase across frequency switching transitions. Disadvantages include spurious responses mainly due to truncation effects in the NCO, crossing spurs resulting from high order (>1) Nyquist images, and a higher noise floor at large frequency offsets due mainly to the digital-to-analog converter. Because a DDS is a sampled system, in addition to the desired waveform at output frequency Fout, Nyquist images are also generated (the primary image is at Fclk-Fout, where Fclk is the reference clock frequency). In order to reject these undesired images, a DDS is generally used in conjunction with an analog reconstruction lowpass filter as shown in Figure 1.Kroupa,Venceslav F.,Direct Digital Frequency Synthesizers, IEEE Press, 1999, = Frequency agility = The output frequency of a DDS is determined by the value stored in the frequency control register (FCR) (see Fig.1), which in turn controls the NCO's phase accumulator step size. Because the NCO operates in the discrete-time domain, it changes frequency instantaneously at the clock edge coincident with a change in the value stored in the FCR. The DDS output frequency settling time is determined mainly by the phase response of the reconstruction filter. An ideal reconstruction filter with a linear phase response (meaning the output is simply a delayed version of the input signal) would allow instantaneous frequency response at its output because a linear system can not create frequencies not present at its input. = Phase noise and jitter = The superior close-in phase noise performance of a DDS stems from the fact that it is a feed-forward system. In a traditional phase locked loop (PLL), the frequency divider in the feedback path acts to multiply the phase noise of the reference oscillator and, within the PLL loop bandwidth, impresses this excess noise onto the VCO output. A DDS on the other hand, reduces the reference clock phase noise by the ratio f_{clk}/f_o because its output is derived by fractional division of the clock. Reference clock jitter translates directly to the output, but this jitter is a smaller percentage of the output period (by the ratio above). Since the maximum output frequency is limited to f_{clk}/2, the output phase noise at close-in offsets is always at least 6dB below the reference clock phase-noise. At offsets far removed from the carrier, the phase-noise floor of a DDS is determined by the power sum of the DAC quantization noise floor and the reference clock phase noise floor.

He was born in October, 1819, at Branford, Connecticut, and entered the railroad service in 1844, serving as express messenger on the Hartford and New Haven Railroad until 1853, during which time he had entire charge of the express business of that road. He went south in 1853 and established express lines on various southern railways, and in 1861 organized the Southern Express Co., and became its president. In 1879 he purchased, with others, the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad of Georgia, and later reorganized the Savannah, Florida and Western Railroad, of which he became president. He purchased and rebuilt, in 1880, the Savannah and Charleston Railroad, now Charleston and Savannah. Not long after this he organized the Plant Investment Co., to control these railroads and advance their interests generally, and later established a steamboat line on the St. John's river, in Florida. From 1853 until 1860 he was general superintendent of the southern division of the Adams Express Co., and in 1867 became president of the Texas Express Co. In the 1880s, most of his accumulated railroad and steamship lines were combined into the Plant System, which later became part of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. Plant is particularly known for connecting the previously isolated Tampa Bay area and southwest Florida to the nation's railroad system and establishing regular steamship service between Tampa, Cuba, and Key West, helping to spark tremendous population and economic growth in the region. To promote passenger traffic, Plant built the large Tampa Bay Hotel resort along his rail line through Tampa and several smaller hotels further south, starting the area's tourist industry. His semi-friendly rival, Henry Flagler, similarly sparked growth along Florida's opposite coast by building the Florida East Coast Railroad along with several resorts along its route. Early life Henry Bradley Plant was founder of the Plant System of railroads and steamboats. He was born in Branford, Conn., the son of Betsey (Bradley) and Anderson Plant, a farmer in good circumstances. He was the descendant of John Plant who probably emigrated from England and settled at Hartford, Conn., about 1639. When the boy was six, his father and younger sister died of typhus. Several years later his mother married again and took him to live first at Martinsburg, N.Y., and later at New Haven, Conn., where he attended a private school. His grandmother, Betsy Plant, who hoped to make a clergyman of him, offered him an education at Yale College, but, impatient to begin an active career, he got a job as captain's boy, deck hand, and man-of-all-work on a steamboat, The New York, plying between New Haven and New York City. Pre Civil War Among his various duties was the care of express parcels. This line of business, hitherto neglected, he organized effectively. After marrying Ellen Blackstone in 1843, Plant decided to stay ashore and took a position with Beecher and Company, an express company located in New Haven which was taken over by the Adams Express Company. Plant was transferred from steamboats to railroads. After a few years he was put in charge of the old York office of the company. In 1853 his wife, Ellen Elizabeth (Blackstone) Plant was ordered South for her health. After a journey of eight days, the Plants arrived in Jacksonville in March and spent several months at a private home near Jacksonville, then a tiny hamlet. Plant was impressed with the possibilities of the future development of Florida. The next year, after it became necessary for his wife to again travel south for her health, he requested and obtained the responsibility for all Adams Express Company's interests in the territory south of the Potomac and Ohio rivers. In the face of great difficulties, he successfully organized and extended express service across this region, where transportation facilities, although rapidly growing, were still deficient and uncoordinated. At the approach of the Civil War the directors of Adams Express, fearing the confiscation of their Southern properties, decided to sell them to Plant for his promissory note of $500,000. With Southern stockholders of the company he organized in 1861 the Southern Express Company, a Georgia corporation, and named himself president. Because he had built a reputation for providing reliable and efficient express service, President Davis's cabinet made Plant's company the agent for the Confederacy in collecting tariffs and transferring funds. In 1863, claiming a serious illness, he left his home in Augusta with a safe passage document signed by Jefferson Davis and sailed to Bermuda. After spending a month there, he traveled to Canada, Connecticut, and then England. When in France, he was informed that his Confederate passport was not valid. After some discussion with French authorities, an unusual resolution was reached as he was issued a French passport declaring him a U.S. citizen residing in Georgia which allowed him to travel extensively across Europe and later re-enter the United States when he returned to New York by way of Canada. Post Civil War After the war, Plant returned to the South in February, 1865 to reclaim his business interests, primarily the Southern Express. The railroads of the South had been practically ruined and many railroads went bankrupt in the depression of 1873. In this situation, he found his opportunity. Convinced of the eventual economic revival of the South, he bought at foreclosure sales in 1879 and 1880 the Atlantic and Gulf Railroad and the Charleston and Savannah Railroad. With these as a nucleus he began building along the southern Atlantic seaboard a transportation system that twenty years later included fourteen railway companies with 2,100 miles of track, several steamship lines, and a number of important hotels. In 1882 he organized, with the assistance of Northern capitalists (among whom were M. K. Jesup, W. T. Walters, and Henry Morrison Flagler, who himself would be instrumental in the development of Florida's east coast) the Plant Investment Company, a holding company for the joint management of the various properties under his control. He reconstructed and extended several small railroads so as to provide continuous service across the state, and by providing better connections with through lines to the North he gave Florida orange growers quicker and cheaper access to Northern markets. In 1887, Plant built the PICO Hotel in Sanford for the accommodation of his railroad and steamship passengers to Central Florida.Jim Robison, Pico, Welaka Buildings, Orlando Sentinel, January 29, 2006 accessed May 4, 2013 Subsequently, he either built or purchased the Hotel Punta Gorda (1887), Inn at Port Tampa (1888), Hotel Kissimmee (1890), Seminole Hotel (1891), The Ocala House (1883), and the Fort Myers Hotel (1898). Tampa, then a village of a few hundred inhabitants, was made the terminus of his southern Florida railroad and also the home port for a new line of steamships to Havana. For the accommodation of winter visitors he built in Tampa, in the style of a Moorish palace, an enormous hotel costing over $3,000,000 and covering 6 acres situated on 150 acres. It was the first in Florida to have an elevator, electric lights, and a telephone in each room. The hotel was called the Tampa Bay Hotel and was famous for its fanciful Moorish and Victorian architecture. The hotel now serves as the main building for the University of Tampa and houses the Henry B. Plant Museum. In 1898, this hotel gained international fame as the stateside military headquarters for the U.S. invasion force during the Spanish–American War. Another large, Victorian-style hotel established by Plant during the 1890s was the Belleview Biltmore near Clearwater, Florida. The subsequent growth in wealth and population of Florida and other states tributary to the Plant System made its founder one of the richest and most powerful men in the South. A good physical inheritance, preserved by temperate habits, made it possible for Henry Plant to keep working until almost eighty years of age. Later life His first wife died in February 1861, and in 1873 he married Margaret Josephine Loughman, the daughter of Martin Loughman of New York City, who with one of his two sons survived him. He was honored at the Cotton States and International Exhibition in 1895 in Atlanta, GA with his own, Henry Plant Day. Henry Plant built or bought eight hotels, including several in Tampa, Florida and the new town of Port Tampa, which he built at the end of his rail line. His most prized hotel was the Tampa Bay Hotel, a lavish resort built right across the Hillsborough River from Tampa. Built at a cost of $3 million, it was said to be an attempt to compete with fellow industrialist Henry M. Flagler, who was developing Florida's east coast. In his will he attempted to prevent the partition of his properties to the value of about $10,000,000 by forming a trust for the benefit of his grandson, Henry Plant II (born 1895), but the will was contested by his widow and son and declared invalid under the laws of the state of New York. This decision made possible the consolidation of his railroads with other properties to form the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad, today a key portion of the Florida operations of CSX Transportation. Plant's son, Morton Freeman Plant (1852–1918), was vice- president of the Plant Investment Company from 1884 to 1902 and attained distinction as a yachtsman. He was part owner of the Philadelphia baseball club in the National League, and sole owner of the New London club in the Eastern League. Of the younger Plant's many gifts to hospitals and other institutions the most notable were the three dormitories and the unrestricted gift of $1,000,000 to the Connecticut College for Women. His former 1905 mansion on Fifth Avenue in New York City is now the home of Cartier. Honors *Henry B. Plant High School in Tampa, Florida and Plant City, Florida are named after him. *The Henry B.

History  Originally, hardly any other jewelry than circular earrings were used in modern Western body piercing. As the body piercing became more of a fashion, a vast amount of specially crafted jewelry became available to the public. Common types of body jewelry that are sold often in modern days include barbells, captive bead rings, labrets, navel rings, plugs, spirals, and various other types of piercing jewelry. Materials used for production have grown from traditional gold and silver to widespread use of surgical steel as well as titanium, niobium, glass, several kinds of plastics (PTFE, tygon, bioplast, nylon). Wood, horn, amber, stone, bamboo, silicone, fossilized ivories, tusks, bones, and porcelain can also be used to craft body piercing jewelry. With so many different materials being used, body piercing jewelry can be as modest or as adventurous as the wearer pleases.

The slight draft of the Amazon meant she was able to get close under the shore batteries; however this in turn led to the Amazon receiving a high volume of damage, the result of which was that all the higher-ranking officers were killed, leaving Quilliam in command. Quilliam's gallantry and calmness under fire following the death of Captain Edward Riou and all the senior officers of the Amazon, quickly came to the attention of Lord Nelson who appointed him first lieutenant on HMS Victory when she was commissioned as Nelson's flagship a period during which he was to become an accomplished officer. Battle of Trafalgar Quilliam was the senior lieutenant on the Victory being responsible for safety, part of this remit seeing him develop an emergency system in order to steer the ship. He assisted in steering Victory into action at Trafalgar, his system coming into effect early in the battle, when having sustained damage to her steering gear Victory required all Quilliam's experience in order for her to continue to remain seaworthy.

The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 992. The village is on the B4031 road about above sea level, on the south side of an east–west ridge. The parish is wide east–west and wide north–south. Its southern boundary is Ockley Brook, which also forms part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. Ockley Brook is a tributary of the River Cherwell. Croughton is Northamptonshire's second most southerly village, second only to neighbouring Aynho. Place-name No single pronunciation of the place-name predominates. Residents pronounce its first syllable to rhyme with either \\"thou\\" or \\"crow\\" (i.e. or ). The Domesday Book of 1086 records the name as Creveltone and Criweltone. 12th-century versions include Crouelton, followed by Craulton and Crewelton in a pipe roll of 1198, and Croulton in an Assize Roll of 1202. It is derived from Old English. Crawil or krawil may mean \\"fork\\". Two streams flow either side of the village, converging just southwest of it and then joining Ockley Brook. Hence \\"Croughton\\" may mean \\"town in the fork of a river\\". Archaeology About north of the village is the site of a Roman settlement. It is a scheduled monument. Parish church The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints are 12th-century Norman. They include the arch of the west tower and the three-bay north arcade. The south arcade, also of three bays, is 13th-century Early English Gothic. In the 14th century new windows were inserted, the clerestory and north and south porches were added. The font was Romanesque but was re-cut in the 14th or 15th century. The pulpit is 17th- century. All Saints is a Grade I listed building. In the 14th century a series of murals was painted inside the church including numerous scenes from the life of Jesus and a Doom painting. The wall paintings were painted over during the Reformation in the 16th century, but were rediscovered in 1921 and restored in 1960. The west tower of All Saints has a ring of five bells. All were cast and hung by John Taylor & Co of Loughborough in 1923. In All Saints' churchyard southeast of the chancel are the base and broken shaft of a Medieval stone cross. An historic elm reputedly stood in the churchyard for 800 years. It is believed to have died of Dutch elm disease in the 1970s, but its demise was in the early 1900s.

Initial printing took place from 1 May 1840, and in all 6,460,000 were printed from two plates until 29 August. Officially the stamps were valid for postage from 6 May but were only available from 8 May. It was first sold to the public at the London Inland revenue office on 6 May 1840. Except for its denomination, the design is exactly the same as the penny black and was struck from the same die. It was originally intended that the 2d blue be issued at the same time as the 1d black; the earliest postmark seen on one of these is 6 May 1840. The first issues of this value (intended for double rate letters), were printed from plates 1 and 2. The printing plates were destroyed in 1843. Copies of the stamp are now significantly rarer and more expensive than the Penny Black. Later when the colours of the stamps were being revised, the inks chosen were red-brown for the penny value and a new blue ink for the two pence value. As the printed stamps in the new ink looked the same as the original issue, it was decided to add a horizontal line at the top and bottom of the label so as the newer printings could be easily identified. Printing of the revised stamps began on 27 February 1841 and were placed on sale in March. These are referred to as the white lines added issue, as pictured right. They are more common than the original 1840 printing.

Dakhla Oasis lies in the New Valley Governorate, 350 km (220 mi.) from the Nile and between the oases of Farafra and Kharga. It measures approximately 80 km (50 mi) from east to west and 25 km (16 mi) from north to south.  History  = Prehistory = The human history of this oasis started during the Pleistocene, when nomadic tribes settled sometimes there, in a time when the Sahara climate was wetter and where humans could have access to lakes and marshes. But about 6,000 years ago, the entire Sahara became drier, changing progressively into a hyper-arid desert (with less than 50 mm of rain per year). However, specialists think that nomadic hunter- gatherers began to settle almost permanently in the oasis of Dakhleh in the period of the Holocene (about 12,000 years ago), during new, but rare episodes of wetter times. In fact, the drier climate didn't mean that there was more water than today in what is now known as the Western Desert. The south of the Libyan Desert has the most important supply of subterranean water in the world through the Nubian Aquifer, and the first inhabitants of the Dakhla Oasis had access to surface water sources. In the third millennium BC the probably nomadic people of the Sheikh Muftah culture lived here. = Pharaonic period = The first contacts between the pharaonic power and the oases started around 2550 BCE. During the late 6th Dynasty, hieratic script was sometimes incised into clay tablets with a stylus, similar to cuneiform. About five hundred such tablets have been discovered in the governor's palace at Ayn Asil (Balat) in the Dakhla Oasis.Scribes and craftsmen: the noble art of writing on clay. Feb 29, 2012; UCL Institute of ArchaeologyPosener-Kriéger 1992; Pantalacci 1998.

In the 1950s, detailed studies began, first by Dr. Ahmed Fakhry, and in the late 1970s, an expedition of the Institut Français d'Archéologie Orientale and the Dakhla Oasis Project each began detailed studies in the oasis.  Geography  Dakhla Oasis consists of several communities, along a string of sub-oases. The main settlements are Mut (more fully Mut el-Kharab and anciently called Mothis), El-Masara, Al-Qasr, together with several smaller villages. Climate Dakhla Oasis has a hot desert climate (Köppen climate classification BWh), typical of much of Egypt. Dakhleh Oasis Project The Dakhleh Oasis Project (DOP) is a long-term study project of the Dakhleh Oasis and the surrounding palaeoasis, initiated in 1978 when the Royal Ontario Museum and the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiquities were awarded a joint concession for part of the Oasis. In 1979, the Centre for Archaeology and Ancient History at Monash University began to cooperate in the project. The DOP studies the interaction between environmental changes and human activity in the Dakhleh Oasis.The excavations at Ismant el-Kharab (ancient Kellis), Mut el-Kharab (ancient Mothis), Deir Abu Metta and Muzawwaqa were undertaken with the cooperation of Monash University. The DOP has also excavated at 'Ain el-Gazzareen, El Qasr el-Dakhil, Deir el Hagar and Ain Birbiyeh. In 1985, the Petroglyph Unit of the Dakhleh Oasis Project was created by Lech Krzyżaniak, then director of the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, under the auspices of the Polish Centre of Mediterranean Archaeology University of Warsaw. At first, the studies of the petroglyphs focused on the eastern part of the oasis, where rock carvings had been documented by archaeologists already before World War II (Herbert Winlock and Hans Alexander Winkler). The expedition created systematic documentation of both the depictions mentioned earlier in the literature and the newly- discovered ones. Aerial photographs proved helpful in this work. Then, under the direction of Michał Kobusiewicz from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnology of the Polish Academy of Sciences, attention was turned to the area of the Central Oasis where 270 new petroglyph sites were recorded. The current director of The Petroglyph Unit, Paweł Polkowski from the Archaeological Museum in Poznań, extended the area of prospection and created a map showing the distribution of more than 1,300 panels with rock art. The depictions date from the Prehistory to the Islamic period and include images of animals and people (often pregnant women), hieroglyphs, and Beduin markings. In addition, excavations were undertaken at Amheida and Balat under the auspices of the IFAO.IFAOIn 2018, the fossilized remains of a large dinosaur were discovered here. In 2019, two ancient tombs were discovered at Ber El-Shaghala archaeological site, that date back to Roman Egypt. Dakhleh Trust The Dakhleh Trust was formed in 1999 and is a registered charity in Britain. Its declared aim is to advance understanding of the history of the environment and cultural evolution throughout the Quaternary period in the eastern Sahara, and particularly in the Dakhla Oasis. To this end, the present trustees have committed themselves to supporting the DOP.The Dakhleh Trust Retrieved May 1, 2020.

For the French musician, see Hector Zazou 200px The zazous were a subculture in France during World War II. They were young people expressing their individuality by wearing big or garish clothing (similar to the zoot suit fashion in America a few years before) and dancing wildly to swing jazz and bebop. Men wore large striped lumber jackets, while women wore short skirts, striped stockings and heavy shoes, and often carried umbrellas. Origins of the movement During the German occupation of France, the Vichy regime collaborated with the Nazi occupiers. Young people expressed their resistance and nonconformity through aggressive dance competitions, sometimes against soldiers from the occupying forces. The Zazous were to be found throughout France, but were most concentrated in Paris. The two most important meeting places of the Zazous were the terrace of the Pam Pam cafe on the Champs-Élysées and the Boul’Mich (the Boulevard Saint-Michel near the Sorbonne). The Zazous of the Champs Elysées came from a more middle- class background and were older than the Zazous of the Latin Quarter. The Champs Elysées Zazous were easily recognisable on the terrace of the Pam Pam and took afternoon bike rides in the Bois de Boulogne. In the Latin Quarter, the Zazous met in the cellar clubs of Dupont-Latin or the Capoulade. Characteristics The male Zazous wore extra large jackets, which hung down to their knees and which were fitted out with many pockets and often several half-belts. The amount of material used was a direct comment on government decrees on the rationing of clothing material. Their trousers were narrow, gathered at the waist, and so were their ties, which were cotton or heavy wool. The shirt collars were high and kept in place by a horizontal pin. They liked thick-soled suede shoes, with white or brightly coloured socks. Their hairstyles were greased and long. Many Zazous liked to dress in the style anglais with umbrellas (seen as a symbol of Britishness in France) a popular fashion accessory and their hair done up à la mode d'Oxford, had a fondness for speaking to each other in English as it was more \\"cool\\" and loved British and American popular music.Willett, Ralph \\"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49\\" pages 157-163 from Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989 page 159. The French writer Simone de Beauvoir described the Zazou look in 1942 as \\"the young men wore dirty drape suits with \\"drainpipe\\" trousers under their sheep-skinned lined jackets and brillianted liberally their long hair, the girls favored tight roll-collar sweaters with short flared skirts and wooden platform shoes, sported dark glasses with big lenses, put on heavy make-up and went bare-headed to show their dyed hair, set off by a lock of a different hue\\".Willett, Ralph \\"Hot Swing and the Dissolute Life: Youth, Style and Popular Music in Europe 1939-49\\" pages 157-163 from Popular Music, Volume 8, No. 2, May 1989 page 159 Female Zazous wore their hair in curls falling down to their shoulders, or in braids. Blonde was the favourite colour, and they wore bright red lipstick, as well as sunglasses, also favoured by some male Zazous. They wore jackets with extremely wide shoulders and short, pleated skirts. Their stockings were striped or sometimes net, and they wore shoes with thick wooden soles. In his autobiography, Christian Dior wrote of the style: \\"Hats were far too large, skirts far too short, jackets far too long, shoes far too heavy... I have no doubt that this zazou style originated in a desire to defy the forces of occupation and the austerity of Vichy. For lack of other materials, feathers and veils, promoted to the dignity of flags, floated through Paris like revolutionary banners. But as a fashion I found it repellent.\\"Christian Dior, \\"Dior By Dior\\" The Zazous were fans of checkered patterns, on jacket, skirt or umbrellas. They started appearing in the vegetarian restaurants and developed a passion for grated carrot salad. They usually drank fruit juice or beer with grenadine syrup. The Zazous were numbered in the hundreds rather than thousands and were generally between 17 and 20. There were Zazous from all classes, races, and both sexes but with apparently similar outlooks. Working class Zazous used theft of cloth and black market activities to get their outfits, sometimes stitching their own clothes. Some of the more bohemian Zazous in the Latin Quarter varied the outfit, with sheepskin jackets and multicoloured scarves. It was their ironic and sarcastic comments on the Nazi/Vichy rulers, their dandyism and hedonism, their suspicion of the work ethic and their love of \\"decadent\\" jazz that distinguished them as one of the prototype youth movements questioning society. While they did not suffer like their contemporaries in Germany, the Hamburg and Berlin based Swingjugend (many of whom were imprisoned in concentration camps) and the working class, mostly Cologne based Edelweiss Pirates (some of whom were hanged by the Nazis), the Zazou subculture represented an important dissident minority in a society of widespread complicity and acquiescence. \\"Syncopated\\" One fascist magazine commented on the male Zazou, \\"Here is the specimen of Ultra Swing 1941: hair hanging down to the neck, teased up into an untidy quiff, little moustache à la Clark Gable... shoes with too-thick soles, syncopated walk.\\" The Zazous were directly inspired by jazz and swing music. A healthy black jazz scene had sprung up in Montmartre in the inter-war years. Black Americans felt freer in Paris than they did back home, and the home-grown jazz scene was greatly reinforced by this immigration. Manouche Gypsy musicians like Django Reinhardt started playing swinging jazz music in the Paris clubs. The Zazous probably got their name from a line in a song – Zah Zuh Zah by the black jazz musician Cab Calloway, famous for his Minnie the Moocher. Johnny Hess, a French crooner popular with the Zazous, released Je suis swing in early 1942, in which he sang the lines \\"Za zou, za zou, za zou, za zou ze\\", selling more units than any previously released record in France. An associate of the Zazous, the anarchist singer/songwriter, jazz trumpeter, poet and novelist Boris Vian was also extremely fond of z words in his work. The long drape jacket was also copied from zoot suits worn by the likes of Calloway. \\"The Zazous were very obviously detested by the Nazis, who on the other side of the Rhine, had [for] a long time decimated the German cultural avant garde, forbidden jazz and all visible signs of...degenerations of Germanic culture…\\" (Pierre Seel, who, as a young Zazou, was deported to a German concentration camp because of his homosexuality.) When the yellow star was forced on Jews, non-Jews who objected began to wear yellow stars with \\"Zazu\\", \\"Goy\\" (Gentile) or \\"Swing\\". Antagonism during the War Vichy had started \\"Youth Worksites\\" in July 1940, in what Zazous perceived as an attempt to indoctrinate French youth. As in 1870-1871, France reacted to her shattering defeat by reforming existing institutions and creating new ones. The Vichy regime was very concerned about the education, moral fibre and productivity of French youth. In 1940 a Ministry of Youth was established. They saw the Zazous as a rival and dangerous influence on youth. In 1940, 78 anti-Zazou articles were published in the press, a further nine in 1941 and 38 in 1943. The Vichy papers deplored the moral turpitude and decadence that was affecting French morality. Zazous were seen as work-shy, egotistical and Judeo-Gaullist shirkers. By 1942 the Vichy regime realised that the national revival that they hoped would be carried out by young people under their guidance was seriously affected by widespread rejection of the patriotism, work ethic, self-denial, asceticism and masculinity this called for. Soon, round-ups began in bars and Zazous were beaten on the street. They became Enemy Number One of the fascist youth organisations, Jeunesse Populaire Française. \\"Scalp the Zazous!\\" became their slogan. Squads of young JPF fascists armed with hairclippers attacked Zazous. Many were arrested and sent to the countryside to work on the harvest. At this point the Zazous went underground, holing up in their dance halls and basement clubs. The Zazous were suspected by the official Communist resistance of having an apathetic, even flippant attitude to the war in general.

Possible causes are biological alterations in the brain due to the earlier drug and similar attitudes of users across different drugs (common liability to addiction).  Sequence of first-time use  = General concept = The concept of gateway drug is based on observations that the sequence of first-time use of different drugs is not random but shows trends. On the basis of established techniques of longitudinal studies such trends can be described precisely in terms of statistical probability. As to the interpretation of the observed trends, it is important to note the difference between sequence and causation. Both may – but need not – be coupled, a question which is subject of further research, e.g., by physiological experiments.D. B. Kandel (Ed.): Stages and Pathways of Drug Involvement: Examining the Gateway Hypothesis, Cambridge University Press, 2002, , pp. 3-10. = Examples of trends = From a sample of 6,624 people who had not used other illegal drugs before their cannabis consumption the overall probability of later use of other illegal drugs was estimated to be 44.7%. Subgroup analyses showed that personal and social conditions, such as gender, age, marital status, mental disorders, family history of substance abuse, overlapping illegal drug distribution channels, alcohol use disorder, nicotine dependence, ethnicity, urbanicity, and educational attainment influenced the height of probability. A study of drug use of 14,577 US 12th graders showed that alcohol consumption was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco, cannabis, and other illegal drugs. Adolescents who smoked cigarettes before age 15 were up to 80 times more likely to use illegal drugs. Studies indicate vaping serves as a gateway to traditional cigarettes and cannabis use. Large-scale longitudinal studies in the UK and New Zealand from 2015 and 2017 showed an association between cannabis use and an increased probability of later disorders in the use of other drugs. Students who regularly consume caffeinated energy drinks have a greater risk of alcohol use disorder, cocaine use and misuse of prescription stimulants. The elevated risk remains after accounting for prior substance use and other risk factors. A meta-analysis of 2018 came to the conclusion that the use of electronic cigarettes increases the risk of later use of conventional cigarettes.  Associations aside from first-time use  The role of cannabis use in regard to alcohol use and Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is not fully understood. Some studies suggest better alcohol treatment completion for those who use cannabis while other studies find the opposite. A recent review of 39 studies which examined the relation between cannabis use and alcohol use found that 16 studies support the idea that cannabis and alcohol are substitutes for each other, 10 studies found that they are complements, 12 found that they are neither complementary nor substitutes, and one found that they are both. A study involving self-reported data from a sample of 27,461 people examined the relationship of cannabis use and AUD. These respondents had no prior diagnosis of AUD. Of the 27,461 people, 160 had reported cannabis use within the past year. At the end of a three year period it found that those who had previously reported cannabis use were associated with a five times greater odds of being diagnosed with AUD than those who had not. After adjustment for select confounders (age, race, marital status, income, and education), these odds were reduced to 2 times greater risk. Another sample of self-reported data from 2,121 persons included only those who had already been diagnosed with AUD. In this sample it was found that those who had reported cannabis use in the past year (416 people) were associated with 1.7 greater odds of AUD persistence three years later. After adjustment for the same confounders as before, these odds were reduced to 1.3.  Causes  Because a sequence of first-time use can only indicate the possibility – but not the fact – of an underlying causal relation, different theories concerning the observed trends were developed. The scientific discussion (state of 2016) is dominated by two concepts, which appear to cover almost all possible causal connections if appropriately combined. These are the theories of biological alterations in the brain due to an earlier drug use and the theory of similar attitudes across different drugs. (Review). = Alterations in the brain = Adolescent rats repeatedly injected with tetrahydrocannabinol increased the self-administration of heroin (results based on 11 male rats and >50 male rats ), morphine (study based on 12 male rats) and also nicotine (34 rats). There were direct indications that the alteration consisted of lasting anatomical changes in the reward system of the brain. Because the reward system is anatomically, physiologically, and functionally almost identical across the class of mammals, the importance of the findings from animal studies for the reward system in the human brain in relation to the liability to the use of further drugs has been pointed out in several reviews. (Review)., PDF (Review)., PDF (Review). In mice, nicotine increased the probability of later consumption of cocaine, and the experiments permitted concrete conclusions on the underlying molecular biological alteration in the brain. The biological changes in mice correspond to the epidemiological observations in humans that nicotine consumption is coupled to an increased probability of later use of cannabis and cocaine, as well as other drugs. In rats alcohol increased the probability of later addiction to cocaine and again relevant alterations in the reward system were identified. These observations thus correspond to the epidemiological findings that the consumption of alcohol in humans is coupled to a later increased risk of a transition from cocaine use to cocaine addiction. Controlled animal and human studies showed that caffeine (energy drinks) in combination with alcohol increased the craving for more alcohol more strongly than alcohol alone. These findings correspond to epidemiological data that users of energy drinks generally showed an increased tendency to take alcohol and other drugs. = Personal, social and genetic factors = According to the concept of similar attitudes across different drugs (common liability to addiction), a number of personal, social, genetic and environmental factors can lead to a generally increased interest in various drugs. The sequence of first-time use would then depend on these factors. Violations of the typical sequence of first-time drug usage give credit to this theory. For example, in Japan, where cannabis use is uncommon, 83.2% of the users of illicit drugs did not use cannabis first. The concept received additional support from a large-scale genetic analysis that showed a genetic basis for the connection of the prevalence of cigarette smoking and cannabis use during the life of a person. The results of a twin study presented indications that familial genetic and familial environmental factors do not fully explain these associations, and are possibly only relevant for sequences of some drugs. In 219 same-sex Dutch identical and non-identical twin pairs, one co-twin had reported cannabis use before the age of 18 whereas the other had not. In the cannabis group the lifetime prevalence of later reported use of party drugs was four times higher and the lifetime prevalence of later reported use of hard drugs was seven times higher than in the non-cannabis group. The authors concluded that at least family influences – both genetic and social ones – could not explain the differences. The study noted that, besides a potential causal role of cannabis use, non shared environment factors could play a role in the association such as differing peer affiliations that preceded the cannabis use., PDF (Review). Another twin study (of 510 same sex twin pairs) also examined the association of earlier cannabis use and later hard drug use. Like other studies it examined later drug use differences between siblings where one sibling had used cannabis early and the other had not. The study examined identical twins (who share approximately 100% of their genes) and non-identical twins (who share approximately 50% of their genes) separately and adjusted for additional confounders such as peer drug use. It found, after confounder adjustment, that the associations with later hard drug use existed only for non-identical twins. This suggests a significant genetic factor in the likelihood of later hard drug usage. The study suggested that a causal role of cannabis use in later hard drug usage is minimal, if it exists at all, and that cannabis use and hard drug use share the same influencing factors such as genetics and environment.  History  While the phrase gateway drug was first popularized by anti-drug activists such as Robert DuPont in the 1980s, the underlying ideas had already been discussed since the 1930s by using the phrases stepping-stone theory, escalation hypothesis, or progression hypothesis.D.

Marketplace on Place Notre-Dame. History At the end of the Albigensian Crusade from the northern \\"barons\\" against the southern Occitania on a religious pretext (fighting the Cathar heresy), the Count of Toulouse was defeated and concluded the treaty of Paris in 1229. With this, the Count gave the Rouergue county to his daughter. She married Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of Saint Louis, King of France. Alphonse founded Villefranche on the place of an old village called La Peyrade in 1252. In 1348 it was so flourishing that sumptuary laws were passed. Soon afterwards the town fell into the hands of Edward the Black Prince, but was the first place in Guyenne to rise against the English. New privileges were granted to the town by Charles V, but these were taken away by Louis XI. In 1588 the inhabitants repulsed the forces of the Hanseatic League, and afterwards murdered a governor sent by Henry IV. The town was ravaged by plague in 1463, 1558 and 1628, and in 1643 a revolt was cruelly repressed. . During World War II, while occupied by Nazi Germany, Villefranche received a large 13th Waffen SS Handschar (1st Croatian) division. Led by Ferid Džanić, Eduard Matutinović, Božo Jelinek and Nikola Vukelić, one battalion staged a rebellion against the Nazis on 17 September 1943, (Villefranche-de-Rouergue uprising) but were soon suppressed and mostly executed on site. The few that escaped inspired the French resistance in Aveyron that had not been formed until then. After the war, an avenue in Villefranche was named Avenue des Croates (Avenue of the Croats) in honour of the uprising. Buildings One of the principal thoroughfares passes beneath the porch of Notre-Dame, the principal church of Villefranche. Notre-Dame was built from 1260 to 1581, the massive tower which surmounts its porch being of late Gothic architecture. The woodwork in the choir dates from the 15th century. A Carthusian monastery overlooking the town from the left bank of the Aveyron derives much interest from the completeness and fine preservation of its buildings, which date from the 15th century. They include a chapel, a vestibule, a chapter house, a refectory, an exhibition room and two cloisters, the smaller of which is a masterpiece of the late Gothic style.

The launch of H-IIA Flight 11 rocket at the Tanegashima Space Center, 2006. The (TNSC) is the largest rocket-launch complex in Japan with a total area of about 9.7 square kilometers. It is located on the southeast coast of Tanegashima, an island approximately south of Kyushu. It was established in 1969 when the National Space Development Agency of Japan (NASDA) was formed, and is now run by JAXA. The activities that take place at TNSC include assembly, testing, launching, and tracking satellites, as well as rocket engine firing tests. Facilities On-site main facilities include: * Yoshinobu Launch Complex is a launch site for launch vehicles like the H-IIA * Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) * Second Spacecraft Test and Assembly Building * Takesaki Range Control Center Those facilities are used for performing operations from assembling launch vehicles, maintenance, inspections, final checks of satellites, loading satellites onto launch vehicles, rocket launches, and tracking launch vehicles after liftoff. The TNSC plays a pivotal role in satellite launches among Japan’s space development activities. Orbital launches of the H-IIA rockets take place from the Yoshinobu Launch Complex, lifting off from one of its two launch pads. The H-IIA first stage engine, the LE-7A, is test-fired at the Yoshinobu Firing Test Stand. Auxiliary buildings are in place for the assembly of new spacecraft and for radar and optical tracking of launched spacecraft. The older Osaki Launch Complex was retired in 1992. It was used for the launch and development of N-I, N-II, and H-I space rockets. The Space Science and Technology Museum is near TNSC. It offers an intricate view of rocket history and technology in Japan. Though most of the displays are in Japanese, there are English tour pamphlets available.

In fiction In Empire Earth: The Art of Conquest, in the Asian Campaign, the Tanegashima Space Center is an important location, pivotal in the story to the United Federation of Asian Republics reaching Mars before the Americans or Europeans. The spaceport was completely destroyed in a nuclear bombing raid by Novaya Russia but was rebuilt by the UFAR at the request of their ally, Japan. Episode 2 of the Japanese animated film 5 Centimeters per Second features a rocket launch from Tanegashima Space Center. In the Robotics;Notes visual novel, Tanegashima Space Center is one of the major settings found in the game. It is also featured in the anime. In Captain Earth, Tanegashima Space Center is now controlled by Globe and serves as one of their bases. In the Japanese animated television series Aldnoah.Zero, Tanegashima is the crash landing site of some Martian technology. The video games Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire, along with their remakes, feature the fictional Mossdeep Space Center, which is modeled on the Tanegashima Space Center. In season 2, episode 19 of the Japanese animated television series Assassination Classroom, the students of class 3-E of Kunugigaoka Junior High School infiltrate a space center that is based on Tanegashima Space Center. In the Japanese animated series Shingu: Secret of the Stellar Wars, Tanegashima figures very prominently in the later episodes.

Directed by Mick Garris from King's teleplay, it is the second adaptation of King's book after the 1980 film by Stanley Kubrick and was written and produced by King based on his dissatisfaction with Kubrick's version. ABC was quick to offer King the ability to write his script for the adaptation of his book thanks to the previous success of King's miniseries, The Stand (1994), which was also directed by Garris. The miniseries was shot at The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado, King's inspiration for the novel, in March 1997. The 1997 adaptation stars Steven Weber as Jack Torrance; Rebecca De Mornay as Jack's wife Wendy; Courtland Mead and Wil Horneff as different-aged versions of Danny Torrance; and Melvin Van Peebles as Dick Hallorann. Actors such as Pat Hingle, Elliott Gould, John Durbin, Stanley Anderson, Lisa Thornhill, and Garris' wife Cynthia appear in supporting roles; and several notable writers and filmmakers who work in the horror genre also cameo in the miniseries' ballroom scene, King himself appearing as an orchestra conductor. Originally airing from April 27 to May 1, 1997 on ABC, The Shining enjoyed a favorable reception when it first aired. It was a ratings hit, being in the top 20 of daily viewership numbers for all three episodes; acclaimed by critics for its careful pacing, makeup, depth, sound editing and creepy atmosphere; and won two Primetime Emmy and two Saturn Awards. However, retrospective critics have viewed the miniseries less fondly, comparing it unfavorably to Kubrick's film version. Plot Jack Torrance's alcoholism and explosive temper have cost him his teaching job at Stovington, a respectable prep school. He is also on the verge of losing his family, after assaulting his young son Danny in a drunken rage just a year earlier. Horrified by what he has become, Jack tells his wife Wendy that should he ever start drinking again, he will leave them one way or another, implying that he would rather commit suicide than continue living as an alcoholic. Now, nursing a life of sobriety and pulling in work as a writer, Jack takes on the job of looking after the Overlook Hotel, a large colonial building in a picturesque valley in the Colorado Rockies. Jack believes that the job will provide desperately needed funds and give him the time to complete his first play. Upon entering the Overlook and meeting its head cook, Dick Hallorann, Danny discovers that his psychic powers grant him a form of telepathy. Danny has an adult mentor named Tony who talks to him in his visions and shows him the future. Hallorann tells Danny that he too \\"shines\\", and that Danny can contact him telepathically anytime he needs assistance. The Torrances are given a tour of the Overlook before being left alone in the hotel for the winter. It gradually becomes evident that there is a malevolent force within the hotel that seems determined to use Danny for an unknown, possibly sinister purpose. This force manifests itself with flickering lamps and spectral voices and eventually a full-on masked ball from the Overlook's past. Danny is the first to fully notice the darker character of the hotel, having experienced visions and warnings that foreshadow what he and his parents will encounter over the winter. The ghosts also appear to Jack, led by Delbert Grady, the Overlook's former steward who murdered his entire family and killed himself at the hotel's command. Grady and the other spirits tell Jack that Wendy and Danny are turning against him, and that his only option is to kill them. They also supply him with an open bar, and he begins drinking again. As Jack's sanity deteriorates, Wendy begins to fear for her and Danny's safety. Hallorann, whom Danny had contacted telepathically, travels from Florida to Colorado, only to be assaulted by Jack with a croquet mallet and left for dead. Danny telepathically communicates with his father, who momentarily breaks free of the ghosts' grip, and then tells him that the old boiler has been neglected. Danny, Wendy, and Hallorann (who had only been stunned by the attack) escape to safety. Jack sacrifices himself to prevent the ghosts from repossessing him and allows the boiler to explode and destroy the Overlook. Ten years later, Danny graduates from high school, showing that Tony was Danny's adult incarnate self. Wendy and Halloran are present at the ceremony. Jack's spirit is also present, looking on Danny with pride. Back in Colorado, the Overlook is being rebuilt as a resort for the summer, as the ghosts of the original hotel await potential victims.

Sam Raimi also briefly appears as a gas station attendant. Production =Development= The creation of this miniseries is attributed to Stephen King's dissatisfaction with director Stanley Kubrick's 1980 film of the same name.King, Kubrick & The Shining In order to receive Kubrick's approval to re-adapt The Shining into a program closer to the original story, King had to agree in writing to eschew his frequent public criticism of Kubrick's film, save for the sole commentary that he was disappointed with Jack Nicholson's portrayal of Jack Torrance as though he had been insane before his arrival at the Overlook Hotel.\\"Stephen King: America's Best-Loved Boogeyman\\" by George BeahmThe Playboy Interview: Stephen King (1983) ABC's success with previous miniseries adaptations of King's work, such as It (1990), The Tommyknockers (1993), and The Stand (1994), made them more than willing to offer the author to work on the screenplay for The Shining miniseries with small Broadcast Standards and Practices enforced. Steven Weber was finally cast as Jack Torrance after the casting team went through a rough time finding an actor for the character. The casting team had a very difficult time finding an actor for the role of Jack Torrance as most of the considerations who rejected the role worried about being compared to Nicholson's performance in the Kubrick version. Two of the many actors considered included Tim Daly and Gary Sinise. King got very impatient, threatening to \\"wait another 18 years\\" if the role for Jack Torrance wasn't booked. Finally, via a suggestion from Rebecca De Mornay, Weber was chosen for the role four days before filming began. Weber accepted the offer because he was a fan of the Mick Garris-directed miniseries for The Stand and found the script he read to be \\"multi-layered\\" and relatable. King was the one who chose De Mornay for the role of Wendy. The producers approached her in 1994, and she accepted the role, enjoying the script for being more \\"scary,\\" \\"disturbing,\\" \\"entertaining,\\" and closer to the novel than the Kubrick version. =Filming= The miniseries was filmed at The Stanley Hotel, the source material's inspiration. Aside from the motive behind the creation of the miniseries, the 1997 rendition featured an important set piece that helped to inspire the original story: The Stanley Hotel in Estes Park, Colorado. King used the hotel that inspired him to write the book as the miniseries' location, with some interior shots in stages also in Denver. Garris tried to make the hotel feel as \\"enclosed\\" as possible to add a vibe of claustrophobia when in a closed hotel; the crew did this by emphasizing the \\"darkness\\" of the hotel, painting some of Stanley's areas that had recently been painted white brown. The production team began shooting at the Stanley Hotel in March 1996, the date chosen as it was Denver's snowiest month. However, on the day filming began, they realized the hotel as well as most of Estes Park was in a \\"snow shadow,\\" meaning it garnered the least amount of snow out of all Denver areas. As a result, they spent $100,000 in snowmaking machines sent from Los Angeles while lucking out on \\"three or four\\" shooting days with actual snow falling on Estes. Producer Mark Carliner attributed the lucky snowfalls to a Ute shaman doing a ritual at the highest peak of the Rocky Mountains. The cast and crew, such as Cynthia Garris, Mick Garris' wife who plays the woman in Room 217; and Dawn Jeffrey-Nelson, Courtland Mead's acting coach claimed paranormal experiences occurring at the hotel during shooting. Some of the cast enjoyed working on The Shining. Mead \\"wasn't scared\\" as he had acted previously in horror films like Hellraiser: Bloodline (1996); John Durbin enjoyed the \\"madness\\" he got to portray with his character of Horace Derwent; and Stanley Anderson, who accepted the part of Delbert Grady based on his disappointment with the Kubrick version, tried to play the character \\"real\\" but with \\"a sense of distance to [his] view of the other and the world, so it comes out as irony or wryness.\\" However, it was tough for Weber to play his character; because the scenes were not shot in chronological order, it was very difficult to master the character's mental state deterioration, due to it occurring gradually as the story progresses. =Effects= Steve Johnson and his XFX team handled the effects of The Shining. Steve Johnson and his XFX team were responsible for the effects of The Shining. When it came to the moving topiary animals, both live static and computer-animated versions of them were made; however, only the CGI animals made the cut. For the more-than-80 dead extra characters in the ballroom, Bill Corso came up with the idea to add black marks on their cheeks and foreheads to make them look dead. A special-effects- predominant ballroom sequence wasn't in the final version, where Gage Creed and his orchestra \\"run like tallow,\\" in King's words. Garris' reason was that it slowed down the miniseries' pacing and wasn't as \\"close[] to the real world\\" as the other scenes. For the makeup of the woman in Room 217, thin shells of Saran Wrap were first glued on to certain areas of the actress' body via K-Y jelly. Then, \\"some really milky-looking flesh tones\\" were added over the wrap and purple tones under it, before thin latex was covered over the entire body with certain areas ripped off. Foam latex was also used to slightly alleviate how \\"creepy\\" the woman's make-up looked. As Johnson explained what the effects team were going for with the dead lady, \\"the idea was to try to do something that was different, that would look cool, play in the scene and be allowed on TV.\\" Reception The first part of The Shining garnered 19.8 million viewers, becoming the twelfth-highest viewed program with a rating of 12.5 and a market share of 19. The second part also ranked number twelve in the amount of viewings, with 18.3 million watching the program that resulted it to be have a 12.1 rating and a market share of 20. The third part was the fourteenth-most-viewed airing, receiving 18.2 million viewers, a rating of 11.9 and a market share of 16. The Shining opened to overwhelming praise from critics when it aired in 1997, which included a ten- out-of-ten review from TV Guide. The miniseries' \\"carefully\\" and \\"masterfully crafted\\" pacing was highlighted by several reviewers, including Ray Richmond of Variety, who also noted its \\"edge-of-your-seat creepiness\\" and \\"surprising emotional complexity and depth.\\" The depth and creepiness was also praised by Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly. However, Tom Shales of The Washington Post advised his readers to \\"avoid [the miniseries] like the plague, because it is the plague.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 42% of critics have given the miniseries a positive review based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"Stephen King's televisual adaption of his own novel is more faithful than its cinematic counterpart, but unfortunately this miniseries is hobbled by a drab literalism of the text and cheesy effects that diminish the scares.\\" Drew Grant of The New York Observer, in 2014, ranked the miniseries as the worst made-for-TV King adaptation. Accolades The Shining won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Makeup and Outstanding Sound Editing for a Miniseries or a Special. It was also nominated for Outstanding Miniseries but lost to Prime Suspect 5: Errors of Judgement in the category. It also won two Saturn Awards for Best Single Genre Television Presentation and Best Genre TV Actor (Steven Weber). Courtland Mead was nominated for a Young Artist Award for Best Performance in a TV Movie / Pilot / Mini-Series: Young Actor Age 10 or Under.

Located about east of New York City and about west of Lisbon, Portugal; the base sits in a strategic location midway between North America and Europe in the north Atlantic Ocean. History The origin of the Lajes Field dates back to 1928, when Portuguese Army Lieutenant colonel Eduardo Gomes da Silva wrote a report on the possible construction of an airfield in the plainland of Lajes, for that branch's aviation service (). However, the location of Achada on the island of São Miguel was chosen instead at the time for the construction of the field. In 1934, the Achada airfield was condemned due to its inadequate dimensions and adverse weather conditions, resulting in the construction of a landing strip of packed earth and a small group of support facilities by the Portuguese military at Lajes. =World War II= During World War II, the designation of the airfield was changed to Air Base No.4 and the Portuguese government expanded the runway, sending troops and equipment to Terceira, including Gloster Gladiator fighters. The military activities in the Azores grew in 1942, as the Gladiators began to be used to support allied convoys, in reconnaissance missions and on meteorological flights. In addition, the first Portuguese Junkers Ju 52 arrived in July 1942 to fly cargo missions. A Vickers Wellington Mk XIV, No. 172 Squadron RAF undergoing servicing at Lajes airfield during 1944 By 1943, the British and American armed forces were allowed basing rights in Portugal. Within a month of disembarking on Terceira in October 1943, the Royal Air Force had laid pierced steel planking to lengthen the runway at Lajes Field, allowing the Royal Air Force to begin patrols. The first attack on a German U-boat was conducted in November, sinking the submarine; this attack was followed by a dozen more attacks on U-boats by the end of February 1944, after which German forces stayed clear of the British and American patrol areas. The Azores enabled British and American airmen to protect Allied shipping in the area. On 1 December 1943, British and U.S. military representatives at RAF Lajes Field signed a joint agreement outlining the roles and responsibilities for the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and United States Navy (USN) at Lajes Field. The agreement established guidelines and limitations for the ferrying of aircraft and the transport aircraft to Europe via Lajes Field. In return, the US agreed to assist the British in improving and extending existing facilities at Lajes. Air Transport Command transport planes began landing at Lajes Field immediately after the agreement was signed. By the end of June 1944, more than 1,900 American airplanes had passed through this Azorean base. Using Lajes Field, the flying time relative to the usual transatlantic route between Brazil and West Africa was nearly cut in half from 70 to 40 hours. Lajes Air Base Diagram Lajes Field was one of the two stopover and refueling bases for the first transatlantic crossing of non-rigid airships (blimps) in 1944. The USN sent six Goodyear-built K-ships from Naval Air Station South Weymouth in Massachusetts to their first stopover base at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland and then on to Lajes Field in the Azores before flying to their final destination at Port Lyautey (Kenitra), French Morocco. From their base with Fleet Air Wing 15 at Port Lyautey, the blimps of USN Blimp Squadron 14 (ZP-14 or Blimpron 14) conducted night-time anti-submarine warfare (ASW) to search for German U-boats around the Strait of Gibraltar using magnetic anomaly detection (MAD). In 1945, two ZP-14 replacement blimps were sent from Weeksville, North Carolina to the Bermudas and Lajes before going on to Craw Field (Kenitra Air Base) at Port Lyautey. =Post-War= The United States and the United Kingdom transferred control of Lajes back to Portugal in 1946. The Portuguese redesignated Lajes as Air Base No. 4 and assigned it to the air branch of the Portuguese Army. However, talks between the U.S. and Portugal began about extending the American stay in the Azores. A temporary agreement was reached between the U.S. and Portuguese governments giving the U.S. military rights to Lajes Field for an additional 18 months: the relationship between the Portuguese and American governments continues to this day, where the U.S. military resides under a tenancy status, and the Portuguese government retaining rights of ownership to the land and infrastructure. Lajes Field remains Portuguese Air Base 4 under the direction of Headquarters Azores Air Zone commanded by Portuguese Air Force brigadeiro (equal to a U.S. two-star general). In 1947, the Portuguese Esquadra 41 started to operate from Lajes, equipped with Boeing SB-17, Grumman HU-16 Albatross, Douglas C-54 Skymaster and, later Sikorsky H-19 helicopters. In 1952, the U.S. Air Force activated the 57th Air Rescue Squadron at Lajes Field, where it was based until inactivated in 1972. These units were responsible for the search and rescue (SAR) operations in the Atlantic between Europe and North America.Mais Alto 348, p. 37 In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance was established. Portugal, the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and various (other) western European countries were charter members of NATO. By reason of the NATO alliance, Lajes was available for use by those countries, and the use of Lajes was one of Portugal's primary contributions to the alliance. However, use of Lajes Field by the United States military is secured by a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) outside the NATO SOFA. In 1953, Lynde D. McCormick, the Commander-in-Chief of United States Atlantic Command organized a subordinate unified command in the Azores called U.S. Forces Azores (USFORAZ). A small staff of United States Army, United States Air Force, and United States Marine Corps personnel composed the joint staff of USFORAZ, serving as the liaison between the U.S. and the Portuguese in the Azores. In the late 1950s, USAF air refueling/tanker aircraft were stationed at Lajes to provide inflight refueling for U.S. aircraft transiting the Atlantic Ocean. Some of the tanker units left Lajes by 1965, but others returned later, especially the USAF KC-135 Stratotanker. This transfer, coupled with the introduction of newer long-range aircraft, resulted in a gradual decline in Lajes traffic. The Military Air Transport Service (MATS) and its successor, the Military Airlift Command (MAC), became responsible for USAF activities at the base, and for a while the 1605th Military Airlift Support Wing acted as USAF host unit. Lajes Field also played a crucial role in Cold War politics. From 1932 to 1968, Portugal was under the dictatorship of António de Oliveira Salazar, yet the U.S. Government maintained friendly relations with the Estado Novo regime, especially after 1943. With rising postwar tensions between the East and the West, the United States understood the strategic importance of Lajes Field and continued its close friendship with the Salazar Government in Portugal. In 1961, the Portuguese Air Force EICAP (heavy aircraft advanced training unit) was transferred to Lajes, operating Douglas C-47, Douglas C-54 and later CASA C-212 Aviocar. During the Portuguese Colonial War, from 1961 to 1975, the Air Force Hospital at Lajes operated as the main centre for treatment and rehabilitation of mutilated and heavy burned soldiers of the three services of the Portuguese Armed Forces. During the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Lajes Field also supported Operation Nickel Grass U.S. airlift missions to Israel, highlighting the importance of the U.S. Air Force base at Lajes. Another important Cold War operation at Lajes was the U.S. Navy's Naval Air Facility Lajes (NAF Lajes), a tenant activity at the air base. NAF Lajes, and its associated Tactical Support Center (TSC)/Antisubmarine Warfare Operations Center (ASWOC), supported rotational detachments of U.S. Navy P-2 Neptune and later P-3 Orion maritime patrol aircraft that would track Soviet attack, guided missile, and ballistic missile submarines in the region. With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, and end of the Cold War, P-3 operations at Lajes declined, and the Naval Air Facility was inactivated in the late 1990s. =Post-Carnation Revolution= The British Prime Minister Tony Blair and Portuguese Prime Minister José Manuel Durão Barroso at Lajes Airfield, 16 March 2003. José Manuel Durão Barroso, Tony Blair, US President George W. Bush and Spanish Prime Minister José María Aznar at Lajes for a one-day emergency summit to discuss the possibilities of war with Iraq, 16 March 2003. Following the Portuguese Air Force reorganization of 1978, Lajes Air Base comes to have two resident flying units: Squadron 503 - equipped with CASA C-212 aircraft and Squadron 752 - equipped with Aérospatiale SA 330 Puma helicopters. In 1980, a detachment of Squadron 301 - equipped with Fiat G.91 fighter-bombers - starts to be based at Lajes, this being augmented and becoming Squadron 303 \\"Jaguares\\" in 1981. The Azores Islands earthquake affected Terceira Island. Damage to Lajes Field was minimal, but Portuguese communities throughout the island suffered extensive damage. Military personnel responded with food, shelter, equipment, and manpower. In the summer of 1984, Lajes undertook a new mission known as \\"SILK PURSE.\\" Boeing EC-135s began operating out of Lajes Field as an airborne command post for the U.S. Commander-in-Chief, Europe. Along with the aircraft came the U.S. European Command battle staff and flight crews from United States Air Forces in Europe. This mission was ended in late August 1991. In 1990, Squadron 303 was disbanded. Lajes supported the large airlift during the Gulf War. On the first day of the deployment over 90 aircraft transited Lajes. Strategic Air Command (SAC) created a provisional tanker wing, the 802nd Air Refueling Wing (P) Provisional, at Lajes to support the airlift. At the height of the operation a peak of 33 tanker aircraft and 600 troops deployed to Lajes. Soon after the Gulf War ended, Lajes command changed from Air Mobility Command, to Air Combat Command. In 1993, squadrons 503 and 752 are merged in a single mixed unit operating both C-212 and Aérospatiale Puma, theis being the 711 Squadron \\"Albatrozes\\" (Albatrosses). The resident Portuguese 711 Squadron was deactivated on 30 November 2006. With this act the long-serving Aerospatiale Puma was retired from service.The deactivation resulted in the storage of one unit at Lajes, one at the Museum at Sintra and the remaining eight helicopters placed in storage at Air Base No.º11 in Beja The Puma helicopters were replaced by the modern AgustaWestland AW101 Merlin: the Portuguese government purchased twelve units for SAR, CSAR and Fisheries enforcement. Air Base No.4 received three Merlins on permanent detachment from Esquadra 751 \\"Pumas\\" from Air Base No.6 at Montijo, near Lisbon. They saw immediate service starting 1 December 2006. However, maintenance problems developed in the next coming months which, coupled with a shortage of spare parts from the manufacturer, led to such a low serviceble rate forcing the Portuguese Air Force to pull the Merlin from service in the Azores. The last Merlin flew back to Montijo on 19 March 2009. In order not to compromise the SAR mission, the Portuguese Air Force decided to reactivate the Puma fleet: in July 2008 a formation of four Puma helicopters made the trans- Atlantic crossing from Beja to Lajes via Porto Santo Airport on Porto Santo Island and Santa Maria Airport on Santa Maria Island. The Portuguese Air Force continues to operate one SAR unit Squadron 752 \\"Pumas\\" operating five ubiquitous and reliable Aerospatiale Pumas to fly patients among the islands, from ships during SAR missions and during other transport duties. The entire Merlin fleet is expected to return to full operational status eventually, giving way to the definitive retirement of the Puma helicopters. There is also a long-standing CASA C-212 Aviocar detachment from mainland Squadron 401 \\"Cientistas\\". In 2009 Lajes provided rescue support of shipping lanes across the Atlantic, a safe haven for medical or mechanical emergency situations in aircraft crossing the Atlantic, and support for the USAF's continuing campaigns in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fighter, tanker and transport planes frequently stopped there, either east or westbound. The next decade expects to see a rise in the number of U.S. Department of Defense aircraft to transit Lajes supporting the newly created AFRICOM. The base also supports other NATO and non-NATO armed forces assets crossing the Atlantic for transport, VIP, exercise, relief or humanitarian duties. The civilian terminal also plays an important role in support of passenger and cargo airliners, executive, corporate and private jets flying to the island or beyond as the central location in the Azores group of islands makes it an ideal spot for refuelling or stopover. In the past five years, large Antonov An-124 and An-225 aircraft have been seen frequently transporting outsized cargo for destinations in North and South America. Civilian operators may use Terceira Airport/Lajes Air Base after requesting a landing permit according to the rules inscribed in the AIP (Aeronautical Information Publication) for Portugal, issued by the Portuguese Directorate of Civilian Aviation (INAC).A copy can be read off at eAIP Portugal - Home . Current status Lajes Field flightline with USAF KC-10As, KC-135Rs and USMC F/A-18Ds. An Indian Air Force Il-78MKI landing in Lajes Field. Lajes provides support to 15,000 aircraft, including fighters from the US and 20 other allied nations each. The geographic position has made this airbase strategically important to both the United States and NATO's war fighting capability. In addition, a small commercial aviation terminal handles scheduled and chartered flights from North America and Europe, especially mainland Portugal. It also supervises commercial air traffic with the other islands in the Azorean archipelago and trans-Atlantic refuelling and stopovers for commercial airlines, executive and corporate jets, air cargo haulers, small private aircraft, governmental flights, humanitarian missions, and other flights. Today, Lajes continues to support transiting aircraft. Beginning in 1997, large scale fighter aircraft movements under the new USAF operating concept known as the Air Expeditionary Force (AEF) filled the Lajes flightline. Lajes also has hosted B-52 Stratofortress and B-1 Lancer bomber aircraft on global air missions, and also supported many routine NATO exercises, such as the biennial Northern Viking exercise. Lajes Field services aircraft from various nations, including Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, India, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Poland, Qatar, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela. The airfield was an alternative landing site for the NASA Space Shuttle orbiter and also now plays as the number one diversion airport for medical or mechanical emergency diversion situations for all types of aircraft. An annual average of 50 aircraft of all types divert to Lajes as a mid Atlantic safe haven. In August 2006, Portuguese news agencies reported that both governments were in discussions for a new agreement that could allow the use of Lajes for the training of a permanent F-22 Raptor squadron. Since 1943, the use of Lajes by the U.S. military has allowed Portugal to strengthen diplomatic relations with the U.S. as well as obtain military equipment for the Portuguese Armed Forces, including two A-7P Corsair II squadrons and the co-finance of F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft under the Peace Atlantis I program. In August 2010, Portuguese news agencies advised for the termination of the F-22 Raptor plan to use Lajes as a platform for DACT training over the Atlantic Ocean. DoD sources were cited as the plan cancelled due to budgetary constraints. This was regarded locally as a setback for the military environment at Lajes, as well as raising doubts from regional political forces who have concerns regarding the base future as well as the safety of the Azorean employed workforce. Despite NATO and non-NATO fighter and transport planes which continue to use Lajes on a regular basis, the US DoD movements are now at an all-time low. With more and more airplanes making use of air-to- air refueling, Lajes has been for some periods of time, ranging from weeks to months, almost deserted except for the occasional C-130 or KC-135. Portugal has explored contingencies in the event the United States military eventually abandons Lajes, including the possibility of entering an agreement with the People's Republic of China. On June 27, 2012, an airplane carrying Premier Wen Jiabao made a four-hour stop at Lajes during which time he toured the island.\\"Red Flag Over the Atlantic: China is angling to take over a U.S. airbase in the Azores\\", National Review Online, 5 November 2012 On 13 December 2012, the US Department of Defense announced, as part of a larger Air Force effort to shape the force, that Lajes Field will transition from an air base wing to an air base group with a reduction of more than 400 military personnel and 500 family members by the end of fiscal year 2014. This force reduction is estimated to garner a cost savings of $35 million annually.

He and his eponymous company are synonymous with geometric prints in a kaleidoscope of colors. Early life Pucci was born in Naples in 1914 to one of Florence's oldest noble families, and he lived and worked in the Pucci Palace in Florence for much of his life. He was a keen sportsman who swam, skied, fenced, played tennis and raced cars. At the age of 17, Pucci traveled to Lake Placid, New York, as part of the Italian team at the 1932 Winter Olympics, but he did not compete. After two years at the University of Milan, he studied agriculture at the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia, where he became a member of the Demosthenian Literary Society. In 1935, he was given a full scholarship to Reed College in Oregon in return for developing a college ski team. He earned an MA in social science from Reed College in 1937, and was awarded his doctorate (laurea) in political science from the University of Florence the same year. World War II In 1938, Pucci joined the Italian Air Force, and served as an SM.79 torpedo bomber pilot during World War II, rising to the rank of captain and receiving decorations for valour. During the war he became a confidant of Benito Mussolini's eldest daughter, Edda, and played a key role in a plan to save the life of her husband, Mussolini's former Foreign Minister, Count Galeazzo Ciano, who was on trial for his part in the removal of Mussolini from power in 1943. The plan involved delivering some of Ciano's papers (which were highly critical of Mussolini) to the Gestapo so that they could be bartered for Ciano's life. After Hitler vetoed the scheme, Pucci drove Edda to the Swiss border on 9 January 1944 and ensured her escape. Before departing, Edda wrote last pleas to Hitler, Mussolini, and General Wilhelm Harster, the SD commander in Italy, and Pucci delivered these letters to an intermediary. He then attempted to flee to Switzerland himself, but he was arrested and transported to San Vittore prison in Milan, where he was tortured by the Gestapo in a futile attempt to extract information. Pucci then managed to escape and reach Switzerland, where he remained until the end of the war. Fashion career The first clothes designed by Pucci were for the Reed College skiing team. His designs came to wider attention in 1947, when he was on leave in Zermatt, Switzerland. Skiwear that he had designed for a female friend was photographed by Toni Frissell, a photographer working for Harper's Bazaar. Frissell's editor asked Pucci to design skiwear for a story on European Winter Fashion, which ran in the winter 1948 issue of the Bazaar. Pucci was the first person to design a one-piece ski suit.The history of the one piece ski suit Although there had been some experiments with stretch fabrics in Europe before the war, Pucci's sleek designs caused a sensation, and he received several offers from American manufacturers to produce them. Instead, he left the Air Force and set up an haute couture house in the fashionable resort of Canzone del Mare on the Isle of Capri. Initially, he used his knowledge of stretch fabrics to produce a swimwear line in 1949, but he soon moved onto other items such as brightly coloured, boldly patterned silk scarves. Stanley Marcus of Neiman Marcus encouraged him to use the designs in blouses and then a popular line of wrinkle-free printed silk dresses. Pucci presented his collection in the first fashion shows in Italy in 1950. Pucci added a boutique in Rome as business thrived, helped by Capri's role as a destination for the international jet set. By the early 1950s, Pucci was achieving international recognition, receiving the Neiman-Marcus Award in Dallas and the Burdine's Sunshine Award in Miami. By the 1960s Pucci was further thrust into greater status when Marilyn Monroe became a fan. She was photographed by George Barris in a number of his items in what would be some of her final photographs. 1970s Emilio Pucci cocktail dress sold at Frederick & Nelson in Seattle. As the decade progressed his designs were worn by everyone from Sophia Loren to Jackie Kennedy. And latter day pop icons such as Madonna in the early 1990s. In fashion history, especially during the period of the 1950s and 1960s, Pucci was a perfect transition example between luxurious couture and ready-to-wear in Europe and the North America. In 1959, Pucci decided to create a lingerie line. His atelier in Rome advised him to develop the line abroad, avoiding the difficulties of a decade earlier in matching available fabrics to the patterns of his first swimwear line. As a result, Pucci came to Chicago giving the lingerie contract to Formfit-Rogers mills. The venture proved to be successful, and Pucci was made vice president in charge of design and merchandising for the company a year later. In February 1959, he married Cristina Nannini from Rome about whom he later remarked, \\"I married a Botticelli\\". They had two children, Alessandro and Laudomia. Alessandro died in a car crash in 1998, six years after his father. Braniff Airways and NASA In 1965, New York ad agency Jack Tinker and Associates was hired by Braniff International Airways to update their image. The agency's Mary Wells hired Alexander Girard to remodel the terminals, and Pucci to design new clothes for the hostesses. As the ads put it, it was \\"The End of the Plain Plane\\". Pucci would end up designing six complete collections for Braniff hostesses, pilots and ground crew between 1965 and 1974. A mark of his impact was that by 1968 Barbie had versions of all of his first four uniforms. These avant-garde creations were designed as individual components to be added or removed as weather dictated. The uniforms included turtlenecks, T-shirts, crop jackets, and culottes. Among the more unusual innovations was a \\"bubble helmet\\" – a clear plastic hood worn by flight attendants between terminal building and aircraft to protect their hairdos from rain and the blast of jet engines. There were two designs of the \\"bubble helmet\\" that was dubbed RainDome by Braniff and Bola and Space Helmet by Emilio Pucci. The first edition, called a Bola, was a zippered version that ran down the center of the helmet and the second was a snap together version in place of the zipper called Space Helmet. Pucci incorporated Girard's \\"BI\\" logo into some of his prints. right Pucci's influence extended to the Moon. He suggested the three bird motif for the design of the Apollo 15 mission patch, although the crew replaced his blues and greens with a more patriotic red, white, and blue, according to Apollo astronaut and retired U.S. Air Force Col. Al Worden at a presentation,\\"Apollo 11: Behind the Scene\\", at the Whalehead Club in Corolla, NC, 18 July 2019. Political career In addition to his work in fashion, Pucci contested the Florence–Pistoia district for the Italian Liberal Party in the Italian election of April 1963. He came second on their slate with 2,780 votes behind Vittorio Fossombroni, but the party only won one seat. However he succeeded Fossombroni in the Italian Chamber of Deputies in August of that year. He retained his seat in the 1968 election, but lost it in the 1972 election, despite being the district's top PLI candidate with 4,231 votes. Pucci label Pucci skirt and dress, 2007. The colourful style of prints associated with Emilio Pucci designs are often called \\"Pucci prints\\". After Emilio Pucci's death in 1992, his daughter, Laudomia Pucci, continued to design under the Pucci name. The French LVMH luxury goods empire acquired 67% of Pucci in 2000. Laudomia became Image Director, while LVMH brought in major designers such as Christian Lacroix (creative director 2002-05), and in October 2005, Matthew Williamson, and Peter Dundas from 2009. Other designers who have worked for the label include Stephan Janson and Julio Espada. Laudomia Pucci has created a talent centre in the family estate in Granaiolo and every year she invites students from Polimoda (Florence), ECAL (Lausanne) and Central Saint Martins (London) to see the Emilio Pucci archives and inspired by those, come up with new ideas. Emilio Pucci clothes and accessories are sold through Emilio Pucci and Rossignol boutiques worldwide, and in high-end department stores designed by . The items mostly feature the designer's original brightly coloured, often swirly, prints or new designs in his original distinct style. The fashion house produces ready-to-wear clothes and accessories for women, in addition to a small range of men's accessories. In the past, the house has produced a more comprehensive range of men's wear, including a line in partnership with Ermenegildo Zegna, which included men's jackets lined with Pucci printed fabric, especially for American department store Saks Fifth Avenue. A limited-edition Pucci carrying case for the PlayStation Portable handheld gaming system was marketed by Sony as a high-end accessory on their PlayStation Signature line. Pucci boutiques in the U.S., all designed by the Brazilian , are located in New York City, Las Vegas, Bal Harbour, Palm Beach, Beverly Hills, Boston, South Coast Plaza, East Hampton, New York, Miami and coming soon to Dallas. The newest of the stores just opened at 855 Monroe Ave. in New York City. Clients include Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway, singer Kylie Minogue and presenter Alexa Chung. Pucci also designed the costumes for Rita Ora's Radioactive Tour. In March 2014, Alessandra Carra stepped down as CEO of Pucci.

The classification by role was used primarily during the developmental stage of the national armoured forces, and referred to the doctrinal and force structure utility of the tanks based on design emphasis. The weight classification is used in the same way truck classification is used, and is intended to accommodate logistic requirements of the tanks. Many classification systems have been used over a hundred years of tank history. An early division in the definition of roles was between infantry tanks intended to focus on supporting infantry in the assault, and cruiser tanks intended for classic cavalry missions of exploitation, screening and reconnaissance. As World War II progressed, the separation of \\"infantry\\" and \\"cruiser\\" roles generally disappeared and the \\"universal tank\\" started to take over. Classification has always been determined by the prevailing theories of armoured warfare, which have been altered in turn by rapid advances in technology. No one classification system works across all periods or all nations; in particular, weight-based classification was inconsistent between countries and eras. With the worldwide adoption of the modern main battle tank designs, which favour a modular universal design, these sorts of classifications are mostly eliminated from modern terminology. All main battle tanks are typically armed with weapons with similar characteristics but some may be armoured more than others. These are complemented with light tanks, typically in the role of (armed) reconnaissance. Development of tank classification schemes Development of a tank classification system started in World War I, when tanks were separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy tanks were required to be large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium tanks were smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light tanks were much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on lorries (trucks).In the Wake of the Tank - The first eighteen years of mechanisation in the British Army; Lieut.-Col. G. Le Q. Martel; Revised and enlarged 2nd Edition, 1936 These tanks started to be used in different roles based on armour and mobility. Light tanks could provide mobile machine gun support for infantry, medium tanks could be used to react and exploit situational advantages, heavy tanks could be used for the main advance. As tank doctrine developed, the role of tanks started to be defined. Initially based on naval ideas, in late 1916 Captain Giffard Le Quesne Martel (later Major General Sir) proposed a tank army formed of Destroyer tanks, Battle tanks (of Heavy, Medium and Light types), Torpedo tanks (utilising large trench mortars), Engineer tanks, Supply tanks and Ambulance tanksA Tank Army; November 1916; G. Le Q. Martel, Captain G.S. During the inter-war years, British tank doctrine evolved through experimental trials and the works of J.F.C. Fuller, P.C.S. Hobart and B.H. Liddell-Hart. By 1936, these settled on the roles of light tanks for reconnaissance, infantry tanks to support an advance, and cruiser tanks in the cavalry role, using mobility to exploit situational advantages. The works were further explored by Heinz Guderian in the development of German tank doctrine and Blitzkrieg for the opening stages of World War II. Other nations continued to use the light, medium and heavy designations. US and Soviet forces also incorporated the tank destroyer concept, allowing their light, medium, and heavy tanks to prioritise works with the infantry. Soviet forces added the concept of the flame tank, armed with a flamethrower. During the course of the war, German forces added command tanks, specialised to the task of co- ordinating tank formations. This idea caught on with other nations. Development of British doctrine added howitzer-armed close support tanks, similar to the older torpedo tank role. These soon became critical to launching smoke, and post-war smoke dischargers became common on tanks. Both command and close support tanks were typically based on the type of tank they were supporting, so may not be considered a completely separate classification. With the fall of France, the need for infantry tanks to advance with troops started to be replaced with a need for Assault tanks, a new class with heavier frontal armour to take on battlefield defences. Infantry tanks proved capable in this new role however, and the designation was rarely applied outside of experimental production. The term saw limited use with both British and US forces in joint development. Hobart would later return to Martel's idea of Engineer tanks in the 1944 run-up to D-Day with Hobarts Funnies, and specialised tanks became a core component of the modern battlefield. Towards the end of the war, increases in tank engine power started to create the possibility of multi-role vehicles. British light tanks had largely been replaced with armoured cars and carriers, and engineers proposed a new Universal tank coupling Cruiser tank mobility with Infantry tank armour. The concept became redundant when Cruiser tank armour increased anyway, rendering the infantry tank obsolete. Post-war the light, medium, and heavy designations remained prevalent until the multi-role concept evolved into the Main Battle Tank, rendering the earlier medium and heavy designations obsolete. Heavy tanks were largely withdrawn from service as medium multi-role vehicles offered similar capability with less of the weight-based constraints. Light tanks remained in use for flexibility, such as with air-portable use. Size classifications Tanks are often referred to by weight-based classifications such as 'light', 'medium' or 'heavy', and by extension the role that this size of tank was suitable for. There were many names given to different tank types, and similar names did not assure similar design goals. Some light tanks were relatively slow, and some were fast. Some heavy tanks had large-calibre, low-velocity, anti-infantry bunker-busters, and some had high-velocity anti-tank guns. Furthermore, expected weights for a given tank type vary over time; a medium tank of 1939 could weigh less than a light tank of 1945. While originally based on weight, the light, medium, and heavy classifications expanded based on tactical use. They now have other meanings than just weight, including relation to gun size, the amount of armour, and, most importantly, tactical role. Post-war in 1948 France, Canada, and the United States agreed to classify tanks as light gun, medium gun, or heavy gun. After World War II, less expensive armoured cars and more specialised tracked vehicles gradually took over the roles of light tanks. Heavy tanks were shown to be incapable of keeping up with mobile warfare, but advances in engine, weapon, and armour technology allowed medium tanks to acquire the best characteristics of heavy tanks, allowing them to fulfil multiple roles on the battlefield. The ultimate in mobility, firepower, and protection were rolled into the main battle tank (MBT). In 1957, the Fourth Tripartite Armour Conference recommended to replace medium and heavy tanks with a single class — Main Battle Tanks. p.123 =World War I= In World War I, the first tank, the British Mark I, was designed for supporting infantry by crossing trenches and attacking machine-gun posts. This became known as a heavy tank alongside other, lighter, types. A lighter British tank introduced into service in 1918, at and armed with machine guns only was given the designation \\"Tank, Medium Mark A\\" and known as the \\"Whippet\\". The two-man French Renault FT was known as a light tank. Super-heavy breakthrough tanks such as the Char 2C () or the K-Wagen () were nearly completed before the war ended. In comparison, the current British MBT, the Challenger 2, weighs some . =Interbellum= British tank designs in the immediate post-World War I era were developments along the same design as the Mark A and were named as Mediums being around . The first tank to enter service that broke with the design was known as the \\"Vickers Light Tank\\" (it weighed about ). It was renamed as the Medium Mark I in 1924 as the earlier heavy and medium tanks went out of service and lighter tanks – or less – came into service.B. T. White, \\"British tanks 1915–1945\\", p. 35 =World War II= The BT-2 tank of 1932 was the first Soviet improvement of J. Walter Christie's design. In World War 2, Light, Medium and Heavy tank application to different roles was incorporated into doctrine. In the US, light tanks were expected to be used ahead of the main force, medium tanks to accompany the main thrust of attack, and by-their-nature slower heavy tanks being brought up to deal with any more significant opposition. In practice, US heavy tanks saw limited use due to the capacity limits of most dockyard equipment, preventing their delivery to the theatres of operation. This left a role-based classification, the tank destroyer, to evolve from the need to move artillery pieces and set ambushes for axis tanks. The British retained some light tanks from the interbellum period, but otherwise moved to a new role based classification scheme. Other countries started to move to a more role- based approach, for example cruiser tank, breakthrough tank, fast tank. The tanks themselves were still often referred to by light, medium and heavy weights based on the actual weight or the equivalent role (for example, a cruiser tank may be light weight but is used in a similar role to a medium). This continued until multi-role vehicles became available. =Modern= Light tanks, such as the PT-76, continue to play an important role in tank warfare, however many are being replaced with IFVs and armoured cars. The light tank is still more used than main battle tanks in many armies for various reasons: financial, terrain-related (muddy terrain, jungle), or doctrinal dependence on airborne divisions. Many light vehicles, such as the British Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) series (FV101 Scorpion, FV107 Scimitar) are used primarily for reconnaissance, but retain the tank capabilities. Medium and Heavy tanks were used in the early stages of the cold war, but have gradually been phased out by the multi-role Main Battle Tank. Heavy tanks grew to the point of being logistically problematic, such as the Conqueror and IS-3, while the MBT became capable of filling their battlefield role in a comparatively Medium form-factor. In most cases, the Heavy tanks grew so large that they could not be transported by rail, and could not be supported by common bridges. Role classifications Many types are also described by their tactical role, which depends on contemporary military doctrine. For instance, 'infantry' and 'cruiser' tanks are British classifications of the 1930s and '40s; 'infantry', 'fast', and 'breakthrough' are Soviet types of the same time period. British and Soviet tacticians up to the time of the Second World War classified tanks into three major roles: infantry, light, and cavalry. Infantry tanks supported infantry units, to integrally support dismounted infantry actions. Light tanks performed the traditional cavalry role of scouting and screening. Cavalry or \\"cruiser\\" tank units were meant to exploit breakthroughs and fight other armoured formations. As role based classifications evolved, the role of light tanks was overtaken by other vehicles, such as carriers and scout cars. The infantry and cruiser tank roles were combined in British use late in the war to form the Universal tank concept. This was made possible as increased engine power provided the capability to sufficiently armour a cruiser tank, the Centurion, to undertake both roles. Centurion entered service just as the war came to an end. Post- war, tanks were similarly made capable of fulfilling multiple roles on the battlefield, resulting in the designation Main Battle Tank. =World War I= Initially on the very first tanks, two types with two roles were provided: the 'males', armed with two naval 6 pounder (57 mm) guns and machine guns, and 'females', armed with only machine guns that supported the 'males'. Later tanks armed with a single gun in one side sponson and machine guns on the other were named \\"hermaphrodites\\". = World War II = Tank models were developed before and during World War II according to different philosophies, with different combinations of armour, mobility, and armament. Each major nation developed its own doctrine of tank use, and therefore different tank models to suit. New doctrines explored the role of the tank as a fast-striking unit. Tank doctrine in the UK declared that one group of tanks would accompany infantry in a similar role to World War I, while another group of 'cruiser' tanks would then exploit a breakthrough, in a role similar to light cavalry. In the USSR, 1930s tank doctrine specified three groups of tanks: one 'breakthrough' tank in the infantry support role, one tactical breakthrough tank to clear the combat area, and a 'fast tank' for operational maneuver. In Germany, the ideas of Heinz Guderian established the need for unified tank formations, but with a mixture of armaments for differing roles. In the United States, doctrine evolved so that the main purpose of the tank was to provide infantry support and exploitation of breakthroughs. The antitank role was given to tank destroyers. There was no analog to the cruiser tank in pre-war US doctrine. There were those within the US Army which advocated a more modern force with tanks in the cavalry role, but their suggestions were not put into place by the time of the US's entry into World War II. Infantry tank Matilda tank displaying a captured Italian flag The idea for this tank was developed during World War I by the British and French. The infantry tank was designed to work in concert with infantry in the assault, moving mostly at a walking pace, which required it to carry heavy armour to survive defensive fire. Its main purpose would have been to clear the battlefield of obstacles, suppress or destroy defenders, and protect the infantry on their advance into and through enemy lines by giving mobile overwatch and cover. The British came back to the concept in the pre-Second World War era. The infantry tank did not need to be fast so it could carry more armour. One of the best-known infantry tanks was the Matilda II of World War II. Cruiser tank Cromwell tank. A cruiser tank, or cavalry tank, was designed to move fast and exploit penetrations of the enemy front. The idea originated in \\"Plan 1919\\", a British plan to break the trench deadlock of World War I in part via the use of high- speed tanks. This concept was later implemented in the \\"fast tanks\\" pioneered by J. Walter Christie. They were used by the United Kingdom during World War II. Cruiser tanks were designed to complement infantry tanks, exploiting gains made by the latter to attack and disrupt the enemy rear areas. In order to give them the required speed, cruiser designs sacrificed armour compared to the infantry tanks. The Soviet fast tank (bistrokhodniy tank, or BT tank) classification also came out of the infantry/cavalry concept of armoured warfare and formed the basis for the British cruisers after 1936. The T-34 was a development of this line of tanks as well, though their armament, armour, and all-round capability places them firmly in the medium tank category.  Flame tank  Churchill Crocodile flame tank A flame tank is a tank equipped with a flamethrower, most commonly used to supplement combined arms attacks against fortifications, confined spaces, or other obstacles. The type only reached significant use in the Second World War, during which the United States, Soviet Union, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom (including members of the British Commonwealth) all produced flamethrower-equipped tanks. A number of production methods were used. The flamethrowers used were either modified versions of existing infantry flame weapons (Flammpanzer I and II) or specially designed (Flammpanzer III). They were mounted externally (Flammpanzer II), replaced existing machine gun mounts, or replaced the tank's main armament (Flammpanzer III). Fuel for the flame weapon was either carried inside the tank, in armoured external storage, or in some cases in a special trailer behind the tank (Churchill Crocodile). Flame tanks have been superseded by thermobaric weapons such as the Russian TOS-1. =Modern= Main battle tank Advances in tank design, armour, and engine technology allowed tank designers to increase the capabilities of tanks significantly, allowing vehicles to undertake multiple roles on the battlefield. This could be accomplished without always resorting to heavier designs, although weights did gradually increase. High explosive anti-tank (HEAT) ammunition was a threat to tanks and could penetrate steel armour thicker than was practical to put on a tank. Advances such as the British- designed Chobham armour limit the effectiveness of weaker HEAT rounds, but the vulnerability still remained. On 7 November 1950, the US Ordnance Committee Minutes (OCM), order #33476, ceased utilizing the terms heavy, medium, and light tanks and redesignated tanks by the gun system, e.g. 90 mm Gun Tank M48 Patton, etc.Hunnicutt with heavy gun tanks (), medium gun tanks (), and light gun tanks (), although these gun terms were often still shortened to simply heavy, medium, and light tanks. The term \\"main battle tank\\" (MBT), in the US, was first generally applied in 1960 to an all-purpose tank, armed and protected as a heavy tank, but with the mobility of the medium tank (the introduction of M60 Patton). The MBT would form the backbone of modern ground forces. United States Army M1A2 Abrams main battle tank, fitted with reactive armor, as per the recent TUSK refit. Many Cold War MBTs evolved more or less directly from late World War II medium tank designs. However, in the 1960s and 1970s, a generation of purpose-designed main battle tanks appeared, starting with the British Chieftain tank. These vehicles are less obviously influenced by wartime templates (the Chieftain, for example), weighing as much as a World War II heavy tank and possessing far greater firepower and armour, while retaining the mobility of the previous Centurion design. Similarly, the US M1 Abrams series, the German Leopard 2, the British Challenger 1, French Leclerc and Russian T-90 tanks are all main battle tanks. The defining feature of the main battle tank type is neither its weight, mobility, nor firepower, but instead the idea that only one type of tracked armoured vehicle is required to carry out the roles of breakthrough, exploitation and infantry support.  Specialist tank  An M60A1 Armored Vehicle Launched Bridge (AVLB), deploying its scissors-type bridge. Tanks have often been modified for special purposes. The most common is armoured recovery vehicles, used during combat for recovery or repair of battle-damaged and inoperable armoured fighting vehicles. Another common use is to provide armoured capability for combat engineers. These include tanks carrying large-calibre demolition guns, with flails or ploughs for mine-clearing, or flame tanks armed with flamethrowers. The tank occasionally may lose its weapons and the chassis alone may be used, as in bridge-laying tanks. Another important modification was the amphibious tank. These designs were modified with waterproofing and propulsion systems, to be able to traverse open water. Many specialist tank roles have been assigned to other vehicle types, though many tank chassis are still used for a wide variety of vehicles, ranging from anti-aircraft roles to bridge layers. Unmodified tanks can be fitted with equipment, such as mine-clearing ploughs, to give them ancillary roles. Hobart's Funnies were a group of various specialist tanks used in World War II, named after Major General Percy Hobart. Tank generations Tanks are sometimes classified as belonging to a particular generation, although the actual definition and membership in these generations is not clearly defined. Soviet and Russian military planners organise tanks into a generation of tanks up to 1945, and four generations of main battle tanks,\\"The Soviets saw tank generations in this manner: 1920–1945, first generation; 1946–1960, second generation; 1961–1980, third generation; and 1981–present, fourth generation. Since the last really new tank design, the T-80, came out in 1976, they feel that they have not produced a true Fourth Generation Tank Design. In comparison, they count the M1 Abrams, Challenger, and Leopard 2 as Fourth Generation and the LeClerc as Fifth Generation\\". —Sewell 1988, note 1. while Canadian strategists organise main battle tanks into three generations.\\"The Canadian Directorate of Land Strategic Concept defines three generations of Main Battle Tanks. The first generation of post World War II Main Battle Tanks includes the U.S. M48/M60, the German Leopard 1 and the British Centurion and Chieftain. The second generation includes most of the Main Battle Tanks such as the American M1A1, the German Leopard 2 and the British Challenger. As for the third generation Main Battle Tank, they include the latest 'digital' tank such as the French Leclerc and perhaps the American M1A2 and the German Leopard 2A5\\". —Lamontagne 2003, pp 7–8. The military of the People's Republic of China also recognises three generations of its own tanks.

It produces networking hardware for consumers, businesses, and service providers. The company operates in three business segments: retail, commercial, and as a service provider. Netgear's products cover a variety of widely used technologies such as wireless (WiFi and LTE), Ethernet and powerline, with a focus on reliability and ease-of-use. The products include wired and wireless devices for broadband access and network connectivity, and are available in multiple configurations to address the needs of the end-users in each geographic region and sector in which the company's products are sold. Netgear products are sold in approximately 30,000 retail locations around the globe, and through approximately 25,000 value-added resellers, as well as multiple major cable, mobile and wireline service providers around the world.  History  Netgear was founded by Patrick Lo, a migrant from Hong Kong to the United States, in 1996. Lo graduated from Brown University with a degree in electronic engineering. Prior to founding Netgear, Lo was a manager at Hewlett-Packard. Netgear received initial funding from Bay Networks. The company was listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange in 2003.

Netgear also markets network appliances for the business sector, including managed switches and wired and wireless VPN firewalls. In 2016, Netgear released its Orbi mesh Wi- Fi System, with models for business as well as household use. The system uses a Tri-band architecture, similar to the traditional dual-band, but with a dedicated 5 GHz connection between the router and a provided satellite. The addition of a second 5 GHz channel allows the network to distribute its traffic, easing congestion caused by the increasing number of 5 GHz compatible wireless devices present in many household networks. In September 2017, Netgear exited the VPN firewall product category. = Network-attached storage = Netgear sells premium NAS devices to small businesses and consumers under the product name ReadyNAS. With this storage hardware line, Netgear vies with competitors like Buffalo, Zyxel and HP. Netgear entered the storage market in May 2007 when it acquired Infrant (originator of the ReadyNAS line). In March 2009, Netgear began to offer an integrated online backup solution called the ReadyNAS Vault. = Network security cameras = Netgear created home security camera brand Arlo, which was spun out into a separate company in August 2018. Arlo is now publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange.  Manufacturing  Netgear outsources all manufacturing to other electronics companies, including Askey Computer Corporation, Cameo Communications, Delta Networks, Flex, Foxconn, Taicang T&W; Electronics, Pegatron Corporation, SerComm, Wistron Neweb Corporation and USI Electronics (Shenzhen). Netgear Inc., primarily founded in San Jose, California, United States of America on January 8, 1996 has its offices in about 25 other countries. Manufacturing occurs primarily in mainland China and Vietnam, with pilot and low-volume manufacturing in Taiwan on a select basis. To maintain quality standards, Netgear have established their own product quality organization based in Hong Kong and mainland China. They are responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of ODMs and JDMs (Joint Development Manufacturers). Netgear was unaffected by US President Donald Trump's 25% tariffs on Chinese imports. Because all manufacturing is outsourced, the company was able to shift its production lines from China to Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia.  Security concerns  Various Netgear products that were manufactured by SerComm were found to contain a backdoor that allowed unauthorized remote access to the affected devices. Netgear, along with other companies with products manufactured by SerComm that were affected by the aforementioned backdoor, issued firmware updates for some affected products. However, it was shortly found that the updates merely hid the backdoor but did not remove it. A backdoor also existed on the DG834 series. Any person who can access the router using a web browser, can enable \\"debug\\" mode using and then connect via Telnet directly to the router's embedded Linux system as 'root', which gives unfettered access to the router's operating system via its Busybox functionality.Netgear DG834G telnetDG834G Embedded Linux Additionally, a 'hidden' URL also allows unfettered access (on a v5 model a username and password are requested).

The Kabra khurd is a beautiful place on the banks of the Son river, primarily due to its picnic spots. Course Sonemuda, origin of Sone River Babur crossing the Son River. Sone or Son River is called 'सोन / सोने' in Hindi, but called 'शोण' in Sanskrit, a rare instance of an Indian river having masculine name. Damodar and Brahmaputr also have masculine name. The Sone originates near Amarkantak in Anuppur district of Madhya Pradesh, just east of the headwater of the Narmada River, and flows north-northwest through Shahdol district in Madhya Pradesh state before turning sharply eastward where it encounters the southwest-northeast-Kaimur Range. The Sone parallels the Kaimur hills, flowing east-northeast through Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar states to join the Ganges just west of Patna. Geologically, the lower valley of the Son is an extension of the Narmada Valley, and the Kaimur Range an extension of the Vindhya Range. Anuppur, Chopan, Deori, Rohtasgarh, Dehri, Sonbhadra and Bihta are the major cities situated on Sone River. The Sone river which is long, is one of the longest Indian rivers. Its chief tributaries are the Rihand,Kanhar and the North Koel. The Son has a steep gradient (35–55 cm per km) with quick run-off and ephemeral regimes, becoming a roaring river with the rain-waters in the catchment area but turning quickly into a fordable stream. The Son, being wide and shallow, leaves disconnected pools of water in the remaining parts of the year. The channel of the Son is very wide (about 5 km at Dehri) but the floodplain is narrow, only wide. The meeting point with North Koel the width of Sone River is . In the past, the Son has been notorious for changing course. As it is traceable from several old beds near its east bank, the river changed its course more than 5 times. In modern times this tendency has been checked with the anicut at Dehri, and now more so with the Indrapuri Barrage. In Bihar, this river forms the border line between the Bhojpuri- and Magahi- speaking regions. Sir John Houlton, the British administrator, described the Son as follows, \\"After passing the steep escarpments of the Kaimur range, it flows straight across the plain to the Ganges. For much of this distance it is over two miles wide, and at one point, opposite Tilothu three miles wide. In the dry weather there is a vast expanse of sand, with a stream not more than a hundred yards wide, and the hot west winds pile up the sand on the east bank, making natural embankments. After heavy rain in the hills even this wide bed cannot carry the waters of the Son and disastrous floods in Shahabad, Gaya, and Patna are not uncommon.\\"Houlton, Sir John, Bihar, the Heart of India, pp. 47–48, Orient Longmans, 1949. Dams The first dam on the Son was built in 1873–74 at Dehri. The Indrapuri Barrage was constructed, upstream, and commissioned in 1968. The Bansagar Dam in Madhya Pradesh was commissioned in 2008. Bridges The 1440-metre rail and road lattice-girder concrete and steel Abdul Bari Bridge (previously but widely still called the Koilwar Bridge and before that the Son Bridge) near Arrah was completed in 1862. It remained the longest bridge in India, until the Nehru Setu bridge at Dehri was opened in 1900. After Nehru Setu bridge at Dehri, Railway Bridges are present on Sone River near Chopan, Vijay Sota & Anuppur. The modern Son bridge built in Deolond, Shahdol district of Madhya Pradesh was inaugurated by Motilal Vora and Pandit Ram Kishore Shukla then Chief Minister and Finance Minister of Madhya Pradesh on 13 February 1986. The Government of Bihar sanctioned in 2008 a bridge across the Son River connecting Arwal and Sahar in Bhojpur district. A four-lane road bridge, carrying NH 30, parallel to the existing rail and road Koilwar Bridge, has been planned.

Emigre: Graphic Design into the Digital Realm. London: Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1994. The first font she created on a computer was a Greek alphabet for her father.Sherin, Aaris. \\"Emigre Inc..\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 7 Oct. 2016. <http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T2021626>. When she started her university education, her goal was to earn a degree in architecture, but she changed to a visual studies major because she felt architecture was too much like business school. While at Berkeley, Licko took a calligraphy class, but struggled with it because she was forced to write with her right hand even though she was left handed. This experience influenced her in rejecting many of the traditions of type design when she started to explore the macintosh computer. In an interview featured in Eye, Licko described her creative relationship with her husband Rudy VanderLans: Emigre In the mid-1980s, Licko and VanderLans founded Emigre, also known as Emigre Graphics. The magazine, Emigre, was created in 1984. This magazine Emigre Magazine designed and distributed original fonts under the direction of VanderLans, its editor. Licko was responsible for many successful Emigre fonts. Licko was initially exposed to Macintosh computers with the first release in 1984. Apart from adding new typefaces as a form of content, Emigre was also created as a way to share the typefaces with other designers that liked and wanted to use Licko's creations. As technology advanced, Licko moved from bitmap fonts to high resolution designs and based the newer designs on the ones initially created for dot matrix printers.The Font Feed.Stephen Coles, September 29, 2005. http://fontfeed.com/archives/an-interview-with- zuzana-licko/ In the mid-1990s, Licko worked on two notable revivals: Mrs Eaves, based on Baskerville, and Filosofia, based on Bodoni. Both are Licko's personal interpretations of their historical models and each features extensive ligatures. Mrs Eaves was named after John Baskerville's lover; it is a somewhat stylized revival of the Baskerville typeface. Along with ligatures, Licko stylized Baskerville through the use of small caps or \\"petite caps\\".http://typophile.com/node/12166. Filosofia Because of her admiration for the Didone serif typeface Bodoni, she designed and came up with several variations of Bodoni, in the form of digital font for computer type and some forms were also used for text. Before working with computers, Licko's favorite typeface was Bodoni with its \\"clean lines and geometric shapes and the variety of headline style choices.\\" Licko avoided using Bodoni for long texts, \\"as the extreme contrast made it difficult to read at small sizes.’\\"Cees W. De Jong, Alston W. Purvis, and Friedrich Friedl. 2005. Creative Type: A Sourcebook of Classical and Contemporary Letterforms. Thames & Hudson. (223) Bodoni influenced Licko’s work on Filosofia, one of her typefaces. Like other revivals of typefaces, Licko’s revival of Bodoni focused on geometry and symmetry. She also incorporated details like slightly rounded serif endings. Licko’s Filosofia was designed to be modified for use either in print or on a computer. There is a \\"Regular\\" version of the Filosofia family which is designed to be used in print. The Filosofia Grand is designed for display applications and is described as more refined and delicate. To create Filosofia, Licko studied different styles of Bodoni, including the original print work and recent revivals, such as ITC Bodoni. Although the samples of Bodoni did have an influence on her work, Licko instead recreated Bodoni with her mind, judging by eye to keep the original measurements. Mrs. Eaves Specimen of Licko's typeface Mrs. Eaves In Texts on Type, Licko writes about her take on Baskerville and what Mrs. Eaves meant to her: \\"In my rendition of this classic typeface, I have addressed the highly criticized feature of sharp contrast. To a great degree, the critics were wrong; it did not prevent Baskerville from becoming assimilated as a highly legible text face, and in fact, the high contrast between stems and hairlines became quite desirable, as is apparent in typefaces such as Baskerville, which followed in the lineage.Heller, Steven, and Philip B. Meggs. Texts on Type: Critical Writings on Typography. New York: Allworth, 2001. Print. Awards Licko and her husband Rudy VanderLans won the Chrysler Design Award in 1994. Apart from winning this award, their work on Émigré also won the Publish magazine Impact Award in 1996. A year later, they got an American Institute for Graphic Arts Gold Medal Award. Soon after, in 1998 they were awarded the Charles Nyples Award in Innovation in Typography.http://www.chrysler.com/design/design_influences/design_awards/1994/zlicko.html# The Society of Typographic Aficionados awarded Licko the 2013 SOTA Typography Award, citing her \\"intellectual, highly-structured approach to type design\\" and her contributions to the digital typography industry.

(; born June 3, 1947) is an American special effects artist, pioneer in the development of the use of computers in filmmaking and recipient of three Academy Awards, among many other awards and prizes. He was one of the original founders of Industrial Light & Magic, the special effects and computer graphics division of Lucasfilm. He is well known as the special effects lead on the original Star Wars, helping bring the original visuals for lightsabers, space battles between X-wings and TIE fighters, and Force powers to the screen. He also led special effects on many other movies, including Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, Stuart Little, X-Men: First Class, Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Education and early career Dykstra was born in Long Beach, California. After studying industrial design at California State University, Long Beach (where he was a member of Phi Kappa Tau fraternity), in 1971 he landed a job working with Douglas Trumbull on Silent Running filming model effects, when Trumbull hired recent college graduates due to the film's low budget. Star Wars In 1975, when George Lucas was recruiting people for the special effects work on Star Wars, he approached Douglas Trumbull, but he was unavailable as he was about to start working on Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Trumbull pointed Lucas towards Dykstra. Lucas formed his own special effects company, Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), based in warehouse premises in Van Nuys, and appointed Dykstra to supervise the new team. This led to the development of the Dykstraflex motion-controlled camera, which enabled many of the film's groundbreaking effects to be produced. The system was made possible by the availability of off-the-shelf integrated-circuit RAM at relatively low cost and secondhand VistaVision cameras. However, tensions arose between Dykstra and Lucas, the latter complaining that too much time and money was spent on developing the digital camera systems and that the effects team did not deliver all the shots that he had wanted causing the production to run behind schedule. These tensions would reportedly culminate with Dykstra's dismissal from ILM following Lucas' return from principal photography in London. Regardless, following the release of Star Wars, Dykstra and his team won Academy Awards for best special effects and special technical achievement. Battlestar Galactica After Star Wars, Dykstra began working on Battlestar Galactica for Universal Studios. Supervising the special effects for the three-hour pilot episode (which was also released theatrically), Dykstra formed his own effects company called Apogee, Inc. which included several ILM employees who had worked on Star Wars. Dykstra was also given a Producer credit for the pilot of the television series. As Universal then opted to make Galactica into a weekly series, many of Dykstra's effects shots were recycled and used repeatedly throughout the show's single season run. After Galactica aired, Lucas and 20th Century Fox began legal proceedings against Universal claiming that they had plagiarised Star Wars, a matter not helped by the similar effects and design styles (artist Ralph McQuarrie had also contributed to Galactica). Lucas was also reportedly unhappy about Dykstra using the equipment (that had been developed and paid for from the Star Wars budget) on a production that was essentially a competitor. When Lucas relocated ILM to San Francisco from Van Nuys to commence work on The Empire Strikes Back, several members of the Apogee team (including Richard Edlund and Dennis Muren) would return to ILM but Dykstra was not invited to join them. He continued to work under his Apogee brand name and subsequently went to work on the effects for Avalanche Express and Star Trek: The Motion Picture (on which he was reunited with Douglas Trumbull). Firefox and the 1980s Dykstra's next major achievement was the effects work on Firefox in 1982. Here, he took on the same challenge that Lucas had set with The Empire Strikes Back of combining miniature effects with actual backgrounds and matte work on white backgrounds using reverse bluescreen. The film secured further awards but was only a modest box office hit. In 1985, Dykstra produced the special effects for the sci-fi horror film Lifeforce which was made in England. He followed with work on the 1986 remake of Invaders from Mars and My Stepmother Is an Alien (1988). In the late 1980s Dykstra was asked by Nissan Motor Company of Japan to work on special effects for a commercial for the introduction of the Nissan R32 Skyline. He stated in an interview that ran before the commercial that he got out his \\"Special Effects Atlas\\" to provide a world that \\"not only looked different\\" but also had some \\"very unusual inhabitants\\"; the \\"Space Fish\\". The Space Fish can be seen following and then examining the new Skyline during the ad.Video on Youtube of the Dykstra R32 Skyline commercial Comic book films In the mid-1990s, Dykstra was supervisor for the special effects of Batman Forever and Batman and Robin. He was also Senior Visual Effects Supervisor for Stuart Little. Dykstra was Visual Effects Designer on the first two Spider-Man films, and was rewarded with an Oscar for Best Visual Effects for his efforts on Spider-Man 2. He also acted as Visual Effects Designer on X-Men: First Class, ensuring the six effects companies involved delivered all the shots required despite the tight schedule. Video games In 1987, Dykstra directed the full-motion video game Sewer Shark, originally intended for Hasbro's VHS-based NEMO console. When Hasbro abandoned the project, the system's creator Tom Zito acquired the rights to the game. In 1992, Sewer Shark was converted to the Sega CD by Zito's Digital Pictures, and released as a launch title for the system.

The lake is revered as a sacred place in four religions: Bön, Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism.  Etymology  The Sanskrit word \\"Manasarovar\\" (मानसरोवर) is a combination of two Sanskrit words; \\"Mānas\\" (मानस्) meaning \\"mind (in its widest sense as applied to all the mental powers), intellect, intelligence, understanding, perception, sense, conscience\\" while \\"sarovara\\" (सरोवर) means \\"a lake or a large pond\\".  Geography  Mount Naimona'nyi (Gurla Mandhata) and Lake Manasarovar Map of the region Lake Manasarovar lies at above mean sea level, a relatively high elevation for a large fresh water lake on the mostly saline lake-studded Tibetan Plateau. Lake Manasarovar is relatively round in shape with the circumference of . Its depth reaches a maximum depth of and its surface area is . It is connected to nearby Lake Rakshastal by the natural Ganga Chhu channel. Lake Manasarovar is near the source of the Sutlej, which is the easternmost large tributary of the Indus. Nearby are the sources of the Brahmaputra River, the Indus River, and the Karnali, an important tributary of the Ganges. Lake Manasarovar overflows into Lake Rakshastal which is a salt- water endorheic lake. When the level of Lake Rakshastal matched that of Lake Manasarovar, these (very narrowly) combined lakes overflowed into the Sutlej basin. Stranded beaches around Lake Rakshastal at 4586 meter would indicate that decrease in inflow and/or increase in evaporation are the cause of this lost connection to the Indus basin rather than tectonic activity. In May 2020, India inaugurated a new 80 km long motorable road from Dharchula to Lipulekh Pass on India-China border [under geostrategic India-China Border Roads project] to the Kailas-Manasarovar in Tibet.Suhasini Haidar, New road to Kailash Mansarovar runs into diplomatic trouble, The Hindu, 9 May 2020. Climate  Religious significance  View from Chiu Gompa Monastery Satellite view of lakes Manasarovar (right) and Rakshastal with Mount Kailash in the background = In Hinduism = According to Hinduism, the lake was first created in the mind of the Lord Brahma after which it manifested on Earth.Charles Allen. (1999). The Search for Shangri-la: A Journey into Tibetan History, p. 10. Little, Brown and Company. Reprint: Abacus, London. 2000. . In Hinduism, Lake Manasarovar is a personification of purity, and one who drinks water from the lake will go to the abode of Shiva after death. He or she is believed to be cleansed of all their sins committed over even a hundred lifetimes. Like Mount Kailash, Lake Manasarovar is a place of pilgrimage, attracting religious people from India, Nepal, Tibet and neighboring countries. Bathing in Manasarovar and drinking its water is believed by Hindus to cleanse all sins. Pilgrimage tours are organized regularly, especially from India, the most famous of which is the yearly \\"Kailash Manasarovar Yatra\\". Pilgrims come to take ceremonial baths in the waters of the lake. Lake Manasarovar has long been viewed by the pilgrims as being nearby to the sources of four great rivers of Asia, namely the Brahmaputra, Ghaghara, Indus and Sutlej, thus it is an axial point which has been thronged to by pilgrims for thousands of years. The region was closed to pilgrims from the outside following the Battle of Chamdo; no foreigners were allowed between 1951 and 1980. After the 1980s it has again become a part of the Indian pilgrim trail.In Search of Myths & Heroes By Michael Wood According to the Hinduism, the lake was first created in the mind of Brahma after which it manifested on Earth. Hence it is called \\"Manasa sarovaram\\", which is a combination of the Sanskrit words for \\"mind\\" and \\"lake\\". The lake is also supposed to be the summer abode of the hamsa. Considered to be sacred, the hamsa is an important element in the symbology of the subcontinent, representing wisdom and beauty.Eckard Schleberger, Die Indische Götterwelt. Eugen Diederich Verlag. 1997 According to Hindu theology, there are five sacred lakes; collectively called Panch-Sarovar; Mansarovar, Bindu Sarovar, Narayan Sarovar, Pampa Sarovar and Pushkar Sarovar. They are also mentioned in Shrimad Bhagavata Purana. Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India, Volume 2 By Manohar Sajnani The People who belong to this region are called Manasarovariya. Most of those who follow Hinduism here belong to the Koli tribe called Manasarovariya Patels or Mandhata Patels and they claim that their tribe are descendants of the ancient King Mandhata of Suryavansha or Ikshvaku dynasty. There is a mountain nearby named after him. It is called Gurla Mandhata and is the highest peak of the Nalakankar Himal. = In the Bon religion = The Bon religion is also associated with the holy place of Zhang Zhung Meri sacred deity. When Tonpa Shenrab, the founder of the Bon religion, visited Tibet for the first time – from Tagzig Wolmo Lungring – he bathed in the lake. = In Buddhism = Prayer flags on the shore Buddhists associate the lake with the legendary lake Anavatapta (Sanskrit; Pali Anotatta) where Maya is believed to have conceived the Buddha. The lake has a few monasteries on its shores, the most notable of which is the ancient Chiu Monastery built on a steep hill, looking as if it has been carved right out of the rock. The lake is very popular in Buddhist literature and associated with many teachings and stories. The Buddha, it is reported, stayed and meditated near this lake on several occasions. Lake Manasarovar is also the subject of the meditative Tibetan tradition, \\"The Jewel of Tibet\\". A modern narration and description of the meditation was made popular by Robert Thurman.The Jewel Tree of Tibet – Robert Thurman. Soundstrue.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-18. = In Jainism = In Jainism, Lake Manasarovar is associated with the first Tirthankara, Rishabha. As per Jain scriptures, the first Tirthankar, Bhagwan Rishabhdev, had attained nirvana on the Ashtapad Mountain. The son of Bhagwan Rishabhdev, Chakravati Bharat, had built a palace adorned with gems on the Ashtapad Mountain located in the serene Himalayas. There are many stories related to Ashtapad Maha Tirth like Kumar and Sagar's sons, Tapas Kher Parna, Ravan and Mandodri Bhakti, among many others.

During 2003, the price rose above $30, reached $60 by 11 August 2005, and peaked at $147.30 in July 2008. Commentators attributed these price increases to many factors, including Middle East tension, soaring demand from China, the falling value of the U.S. dollar, reports showing a decline in petroleum reserves, worries over peak oil, and financial speculation. For a time, geopolitical events and natural disasters had strong short-term effects on oil prices, such as North Korean missile tests, the 2006 conflict between Israel and Lebanon, worries over Iranian nuclear plans in 2006, Hurricane Katrina, and various other factors. By 2008, such pressures appeared to have an insignificant impact on oil prices given the onset of the global recession. The recession caused demand for energy to shrink in late 2008, with oil prices collapsing from the July 2008 high of $147 to a December 2008 low of $32. However, it has been disputed that the laws of supply and demand of oil could have been responsible for an almost 80% drop in the oil price within a 6-month period. Oil prices stabilized by August 2009 and generally remained in a broad trading range between $70 and $120 through November 2014, before returning to 2003 pre-crisis levels by early 2016, as US production increased dramatically. The United States went on to become the largest oil producer by 2018.https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37053 New inflation- adjusted peaks The price of crude oil in 2003 traded in a range between $20–$30/bbl. Between 2003 and July 2008, prices steadily rose, reaching $100/bbl in late 2007, coming close to the previous inflation-adjusted peak set in 1980. A steep rise in the price of oil in 2008 – also mirrored by other commodities – culminated in an all-time high of $147.27 during trading on 11 July 2008, more than a third above the previous inflation-adjusted high. High oil prices and economic weakness contributed to a demand contraction in 2007–2008. In the United States, gasoline consumption declined by 0.4% in 2007, then fell by 0.5% in the first two months of 2008 alone. Record-setting oil prices in the first half of 2008 and economic weakness in the second half of the year prompted a /day contraction in US consumption of petroleum products, representing 5.8% of total US consumption, the largest annual decline since 1980 at the climax of the 1979 energy crisis. Possible causes =Demand= World crude oil demand grew an average of 1.76% per year from 1994 to 2006, with a high of 3.4% in 2003–2004. World demand for oil is projected to increase 37% over 2006 levels by 2030, according to the 2007 U.S. Energy Information Administration's (EIA) annual report. In 2007, the EIA expected demand to reach an ultimate high of , from 2006's , driven in large part by the transportation sector. A 2008 report from the International Energy Agency (IEA) predicted that although drops in petroleum demand due to high prices have been observed in developed countries and are expected to continue, a 3.7 percent rise in demand by 2013 is predicted in developing countries. This is projected to cause a net rise in global petroleum demand during that period. Transportation consumes the largest proportion of energy, and has seen the largest growth in demand in recent decades. This growth has largely come from new demand for cars and other personal-use vehicles powered by internal combustion engines. This sector also has the highest consumption rates, accounting for approximately 55% of oil use worldwide as documented in the Hirsch report and 68.9% of the oil used in the United States in 2006. Cars and trucks are predicted to cause almost 75% of the increase in oil consumption by India and China between 2001 and 2025. In 2008, auto sales in China were expected to grow by as much as 15–20 percent, resulting in part from economic growth rates of over 10 percent for five years in a row. Demand growth is highest in the developing world, but the United States is the world's largest consumer of petroleum. Between 1995 and 2005, US consumption grew from a day to a day, an increase of a day. China, by comparison, increased consumption from a day to a day, an increase of a day, in the same time frame. Per capita, annual consumption is by people in the US,20.7 Mbpd divided by the population of 304 million times 365 days/year in China,6.5 Mbpd divided by the population of 1,325 million people times 365 days/year (figures from the CIA Factbook ) and in India.2.45 Mbpd divided by the population of 1,136 million people times 365 days/year (figures from the CIA Factbook ) As countries develop, industry, rapid urbanization and higher living standards drive up energy use, most often of oil. Thriving economies such as China and India are quickly becoming large oil consumers.Oil price 'may hit $200 a barrel' , BBC News, 7 May 2008. China has seen oil consumption grow by 8% yearly since 2002, doubling from 1996–2006. Although swift continued growth in China is often predicted, others predict that China's export-dominated economy will not continue such growth trends due to wage and price inflation and reduced demand from the US. India's oil imports are expected to more than triple from 2005 levels by 2020, rising to . Another large factor on petroleum demand has been human population growth. Because world population grew faster than oil production, production per capita peaked in 1979 (preceded by a plateau during the period of 1973–1979). The world’s population in 2030 is expected to be double that of 1980. Role of fuel subsidies State fuel subsidies shielded consumers in many nations from higher market prices, but many of these subsidies were reduced or removed as the governmental cost rose. In June 2008, AFP reported that: In the same month, Reuters reported that: The Economist reported: \\"Half of the world's population enjoys fuel subsidies. This estimate, from Morgan Stanley, implies that almost a quarter of the world's petrol is sold at less than the market price.\\" U.S. Secretary of Energy Samuel Bodman stated that around of oil consumption (over a third of the global total) was subsidized. =Supply= An important contributor to the price increase was the slowdown in oil supply growth, which has been a general trend since oil production surpassed new discoveries in 1980. The likelihood that global oil production will decline at some point, leading to lower supply, is a long-term fundamental cause of rising prices. Although there is contention about the exact time at which global production will peak, a majority of industry participants acknowledge that the concept of a production peak is valid. However, some commentators argued that global warming awareness and new energy sources would limit demand before the effects of supply could, suggesting that reserve depletion would be a non-issue. A large factor in the lower supply growth of petroleum has been that oil's historically high ratio of Energy Returned on Energy Invested is in significant decline. Petroleum is a limited resource, and the remaining accessible reserves are consumed more rapidly each year. Remaining reserves are increasingly difficult to extract and therefore more expensive. Eventually, reserves will only be economically feasible to extract at extremely high prices. Even if total oil supply does not decline, increasing numbers of experts believe the easily accessible sources of light sweet crude are almost exhausted and in the future the world will depend on more-expensive unconventional oil reserves and heavy crude oil, as well as renewable energy sources. It is thought by many, including energy economists such as Matthew Simmons, that prices could continue to rise indefinitely until a new market equilibrium is reached at which point supply satisfies worldwide demand. Timothy Kailing, in a 2008 Journal of Energy Security article, pointed out the difficulty of increasing production in mature petroleum regions, even with vastly increased investment in exploration and production. By looking at the historical response of production to variation in drilling effort, he claimed that very little increase of production could be attributed to increased drilling. This was due to a tight quantitative relationship of diminishing returns with increasing drilling effort: As drilling effort increased, the energy obtained per active drill rig was reduced according to a severely diminishing power law. This analysis suggested that even an enormous increase of drilling effort was unlikely to lead to significantly increased oil and gas production in a mature petroleum region like the United States. A prominent example of investment in non-conventional sources is seen in the Canadian oil sands. They are a far less cost-efficient source of heavy, low- grade oil than conventional crude; but when oil trades above $60/bbl, the tar sands become attractive to exploration and production companies. While Canada's oil sands region is estimated to contain as much \\"heavy\\" oil as all the world's reserves of \\"conventional\\" oil, efforts to economically exploit these resources lag behind the increasing demand of recent years. Until 2008, CERA (a consulting company wholly owned by energy consultants IHS Energy) did not believe this would be such an immediate problem. However, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Daniel Yergin, previously known for his quotes that the price of oil would soon return down to \\"normal\\", amended the company's position on 7 May 2008 to predict that oil would reach $150 during 2008, due to tightness of supply. This reversal of opinion was significant, as CERA, among other consultancies, provided price projections that were used by many official bodies to plan long-term strategy in respect of energy mix and price. Other major energy organisations, such as the International Energy Agency (IEA), had already been much less optimistic in their assessments for some time. Interview with Fatih Birol. In 2008, the IEA drastically accelerated its prediction of production decline for existing oilfields, from 3.7% a year to 6.7% a year, based largely on better accounting methods, including actual research of individual oil field production throughout the world.George Monbiot asks Fatih Birol, chief economist of IEA, when will the oil run out? , The Guardian, Terrorist and insurgent groups have increasingly targeted oil and gas installations, and succeeded in stopping a substantial volume of exports during the 2003–2008 height of the American occupation of Iraq. Such attacks are sometimes perpetrated by militias in regions where oil wealth has produced few tangible benefits for the local citizenry, as is the case in the Niger Delta. Many factors have resulted in possible and/or actual concerns about the reduced supply of oil. The post-9/11 war on terror, labor strikes, hurricane threats to oil platforms, fires and terrorist threats at refineries, and other short-lived problems are not solely responsible for the higher prices. Such problems do push prices higher temporarily, but have not historically been fundamental to long-term price increases. =Investment/speculation demand= Investment demand for oil occurs when investors purchase futures contracts to buy a commodity at a set price for future delivery. \\"Speculators are not buying any actual crude. ... When [the] contracts mature, they either settle them with a cash payment or sell them on to genuine consumers.\\" Several claims have been made implicating financial speculation as a major cause of the price increases. In May 2008 the transport chief for Germany's Social Democrats estimated that 25 percent of the rise to $135 a barrel had nothing to do with underlying supply and demand. Testimony was given to a U.S. Senate committee in May indicating that \\"demand shock\\" from \\"institutional investors\\" had increased by over the previous five years, almost as much as the increased physical demand from China (). The influence of institutional investors, such as sovereign wealth funds, was also discussed in June 2008, when Lehman Brothers suggested that price increases were related to increases in exposure to commodities by such investors. It claimed that \\"for every $100 million in new inflows, the price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, increased by 1.6%.\\" Also in May 2008, an article in The Economist pointed out that oil futures transactions on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), nearly mirrored the price of oil increases for a several- year period; however, the article conceded that the increased investment might be following rising prices, rather than causing them, and that the nickel commodity market had halved in value between May 2007 and May 2008 despite significant speculative interest. It also reminded readers that \\"Investment can flood into the oil market without driving up prices because speculators are not buying any actual crude... no oil is hoarded or somehow kept off the market,\\" and that prices of some commodities which are not openly traded have actually risen faster than oil prices. In June 2008, OPEC's Secretary General Abdallah Salem el-Badri stated that current world consumption of oil at 87 million bpd was far exceeded by the \\"paper market\\" for oil, which equaled about 1.36 billion bpd, or more than 15 times the actual market demand. An interagency task force on commodities markets was formed in the U.S. government to investigate the claims of speculators' influence on the petroleum market. The task force concluded in July 2008 that \\"market fundamentals\\" such as supply and demand provided the best explanations for oil price increases, and that increased speculation was not statistically correlated with the increases. The report also noted that increased prices with an elastic supply would cause increases in petroleum inventories. As inventories actually declined, the task force concluded that market pressures were most likely to blame. Other commodities that were not subject to market speculation (such as coal, steel, and onions) saw similar price increases over the same time period. In June 2008 U.S. energy secretary Samuel Bodman said that insufficient oil production, not financial speculation, was driving rising crude prices. He said that oil production had not kept pace with growing demand. \\"In the absence of any additional crude supply, for every 1% of crude demand, we will expect a 20% increase in price in order to balance the market,\\" Bodman said. This contradicted earlier statements by Iranian OPEC governor Mohammad-Ali Khatibi indicating that the oil market was saturated and that an increase in production announced by Saudi Arabia was \\"wrong\\". OPEC itself had also previously stated that the oil market was well supplied and that high prices were a result of speculation and a weak U.S. dollar. In September 2008, Masters Capital Management released a study of the oil market, concluding that speculation did significantly impact the price. The study stated that over $60 billion was invested in oil during the first six months of 2008, helping drive the price per barrel from $95 to $147, and that by the beginning of September, $39 billion had been withdrawn by speculators, causing prices to fall. Effects There is debate over what the effects of the 2000s energy crisis will be over the long term. Some speculated that an oil-price spike could create a recession comparable to those that followed the 1973 and 1979 energy crises or a potentially worse situation such as a global oil crash. Increased petroleum prices are reflected in a vast number of products derived from petroleum, as well as those transported using petroleum fuels.Gas costs are reflected in nearly everything you buy, The Dallas Morning News, 15 June 2008. Political scientist George Friedman has postulated that if high prices for oil and food persist, they will define the fourth distinct geopolitical regime since the end of World War II, the previous three being the Cold War, the 1989–2001 period in which economic globalization was primary, and the post-9/11 \\"war on terror\\". In addition to high oil prices, from year 2000 volatility in the price of oil has increased notably and this volatility has been suggested to be a factor in the financial crisis which began in 2008. The perceived increase in oil price differs internationally according to currency market fluctuations and the purchasing power of currencies. For example, excluding changes in relative purchasing power of various currencies, from 1 January 2002 to 1 January 2008:To see table and sources : Talk:Oil price increases since 2003#World view * In US$, oil price rose from $20.37 to nearly $100, about 4.91 times as expensive; * In the same period, the Taiwanese dollar gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Taiwan 4.53 times as expensive; * In the same period, the Japanese Yen gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in Japan 4.10 times as expensive; * In the same period, the Euro gained value over the U.S. dollar to make oil in the Eurozone 2.94 times as expensive. On average, oil prices roughly quadrupled for these areas, triggering widespread protest activities. A similar price surge for petroleum-based fertilizers contributed to the 2007–08 world food price crisis and further unrest. In 2008, a report by Cambridge Energy Research Associates stated that 2007 had been the year of peak gasoline usage in the United States, and that record energy prices would cause an \\"enduring shift\\" in energy consumption practices. According to the report, in April gas consumption had been lower than a year before for the sixth straight month, suggesting 2008 would be the first year U.S. gasoline usage declined in 17 years. The total miles driven in the U.S. began declining in 2006. In the United States, oil prices contributed to inflation averaging 3.3% in 2005–2006, significantly above the average of 2.5% in the preceding 10-year period. As a result, during this period the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to curb inflation. High oil prices typically affect less- affluent countries first, particularly the developing world with less discretionary income. There are fewer vehicles per capita, and oil is often used for electricity generation as well as private transport. The World Bank has looked more deeply at the effect of oil prices in the developing countries. One analysis found that in South Africa a 125 percent increase in the price of crude oil and refined petroleum reduces employment and GDP by approximately 2 percent, and reduces household consumption by approximately 7 percent, affecting mainly the poor.Economy-wide and distributional impacts of an oil price shock on the South African economy, Vol. 1 of 1 World Bank, Policy Research working paper ; no. WPS 4354: Economy-wide and distributional impacts of an oil price shock on the South African economy (2007/09/18) OPEC's annual oil export revenue surged to a new record in 2008, estimated around US$800 billion. Forecasted prices and trends According to informed observers, OPEC, meeting in early December 2007, seemed to desire a high but stable price that would deliver substantial needed income to the oil-producing states, but avoid prices so high that they would negatively impact the economies of the oil-consuming nations. A range of US$70–80 per barrel was suggested by some analysts to be OPEC's goal. In November 2008, as prices fell below $60 a barrel, the IEA warned that falling prices could lead to both a lack of investment in new sources of oil and a fall in production of more- expensive unconventional reserves such as the oil sands of Canada. The IEA's chief economist warned, \\"Oil supplies in the future will come more and more from smaller and more-difficult fields,\\" meaning that future production requires more investment every year. A lack of new investment in such projects, which had already been observed, could eventually cause new and more-severe supply issues than had been experienced in the early 2000s according to the IEA. Because the sharpest production declines had been seen in developed countries, the IEA warned that the greatest growth in production was expected to come from smaller projects in OPEC states, raising their world production share from 44% in 2008 to a projected 51% in 2030. The IEA also pointed out that demand from the developed world may have also peaked, so that future demand growth was likely to come from developing nations such as China, contributing 43%, and India and the Middle East, each about 20%.IEA warns of new oil supply crunch (Subscription Required).

By Margot Habiby and Alexander Kwiatkowski. Bloomberg L.P. Published 10 September 2008. On 10 September, the International Energy Agency (IEA) lowered its 2009 demand forecast by to a day. As many countries throughout the world entered an economic recession in the third quarter of 2008 and the global banking system came under severe strain, oil prices continued to slide. In November and December, global demand growth fell, and U.S. oil demand fell an estimated 10% overall from early October to early November 2008 (accompanying a significant drop in auto sales).Well Prepared . The Economist. Published 6 November 2008. In their December meeting, OPEC members agreed to reduce their production by per day, and said their resolution to reduce production in October had an 85% compliance rate.OPEC Cut Has Little Zing. By Parmy Olson. Forbes.com Published 18 December 2008. Petroleum prices fell below $35 in February 2009, but by May 2009 had risen back to mid-November 2008 levels around $55. The global economic downturn left oil-storage facilities with more oil than in any year since 1990, when Iraq's invasion of Kuwait upset the market. In early 2011, crude oil rebounded above US$100/bbl due to the Arab Spring protests in the Middle East and North Africa, including the 2011 Egyptian revolution, the 2011 Libyan civil war, and steadily tightening international sanctions against Iran. The oil price fluctuated around $100 through early 2014. By 2014–2015, the world oil market was again steadily oversupplied, led by an unexpected near-doubling in U.S. oil production from 2008 levels due to substantial improvements in shale \\"fracking\\" technology. By January 2016, the OPEC Reference Basket fell to US$22.48/bbl – less than one-sixth of its record from July 2008 ($140.73), and back below the April 2003 starting point ($23.27) of its historic run-up. OPEC production was poised to rise further with the lifting of Iranian sanctions, at a time when markets already appeared to be oversupplied by at least 2 million barrels per day. Possible mitigations Attempts to mitigate the impacts of oil price increases include: * Increasing the supply of petroleum * Finding substitutes for petroleum * Decreasing the demand for petroleum * Attempting to reduce the impact of rising prices on petroleum consumers * Better urban planning with more emphasis on bike lanes, public transit, and high dense residential zoning. In mainstream economic theory, a free market rations an increasingly scarce commodity by increasing its price. A higher price should stimulate producers to produce more, and consumers to consume less, while possibly shifting to substitutes. The first three mitigation strategies in the above list are, therefore, in keeping with mainstream economic theory, as government policies can affect the supply and demand for petroleum as well as the availability of substitutes. In contrast, the last type of strategy in the list (attempting to shield consumers from rising prices) would seem to work against classical economic theory, by encouraging consumers to overconsume the scarce quantity, thus making it even scarcer. To avoid creating outright shortages, attempts at price control may require some sort of rationing scheme. =Alternative propulsion= Alternative fuels Economists say that the substitution effect will spur demand for alternate fossil fuels, such as coal or liquefied natural gas and for renewable energy, such as solar power, wind power, and advanced biofuels. For example, China and India are currently heavily investing in natural gas and coal liquefaction facilities. Nigeria is working on burning natural gas to produce electricity instead of simply flaring the gas, where all non-emergency gas flaring will be forbidden after 2008. Outside the U.S., more than 50% of oil is consumed for stationary, non-transportation purposes such as electricity production where it is relatively easy to substitute natural gas for oil. Oil companies including the supermajors have begun to fund research into alternative fuel. BP has invested half a billion dollars for research over the next several years. The motivations behind such moves are to acquire the patent rights as well as understanding the technology so vertical integration of the future industry could be achieved. Electric propulsion The rise in oil prices caused renewed interest in electric cars, with several new models hitting the market, both hybrid and purely electric. The most successful among the former being the Toyota Prius and among the latter the cars of companies like Tesla. Several countries also incentivized the use of electric cars through tax-breaks or subsidies or by building charging stations. High speed rail In a similar vein as the original TGV that was switched from gas turbine to electric propulsion after the 1973 oil crisis, several countries have renewed and increased their efforts for electric propulsion in their rail systems, specifically high-speed rail. In the time since 2003, the global High speed rail network almost doubled and there are plans globally that amount to the network being doubled again within the next ten to twenty years, based on current constructions. China in particular went from having no High speed rail whatsoever in 2003 to the longest network in the world in 2015. =Bioplastics and bioasphalt= Another major factor in petroleum demand is the widespread use of petroleum products such as plastic. These could be partially replaced by bioplastics, which are derived from renewable plant feedstocks such as vegetable oil, cornstarch, pea starch, or microbiota. They are used either as a direct replacement for traditional plastics or as blends with traditional plastics. The most common end use market is for packaging materials. Japan has also been a pioneer in bioplastics, incorporating them into electronics and automobiles. Bioasphalt can also be used as a replacement of petroleum asphalt. =United States Strategic Fuel Reserve= The United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve could, on its own, supply current U.S. demand for about a month in the event of an emergency, unless it were also destroyed or inaccessible in the emergency. This could potentially be the case if a major storm were to hit the Gulf of Mexico, where the reserve is located. While total consumption has increased, the western economies are less reliant on oil than they were twenty-five years ago, due both to substantial growth in productivity and the growth of sectors of the economy with little oil dependence such as finance and banking, retail, etc. The decline of heavy industry and manufacturing in most developed countries has reduced the amount of oil per unit GDP; however, since these items are imported anyway, there is less change in the oil dependence of industrialized countries than the direct consumption statistics indicate. =Fuel taxes= One recourse used and discussed in the past to avoid the negative impacts of oil shocks in the many developed countries which have high fuel taxes has been to temporarily or permanently suspend these taxes as fuel costs rise. France, Italy, and the Netherlands lowered taxes in 2000 in response to protests over high prices, but other European nations resisted this option because public service finance is partly based on energy taxes. The issue came up again in 2004, when oil reached $40 a barrel causing a meeting of 25 EU finance ministers to lower economic growth forecasts for that year. Because of budget deficits in several countries, they decided to pressure OPEC to lower prices instead of lowering taxes. In 2007, European truckers, farmers, and fishermen again raised concerns over record oil prices cutting into their earnings, hoping to have taxes lowered. In the United Kingdom, where fuel taxes were raised in October and were scheduled to rise again in April 2008, there was talk of protests and roadblocks if the tax issue was not addressed. On 1 April 2008, a 25 yen per liter fuel tax in Japan was allowed to lapse temporarily. This method of softening price shocks is even less viable to countries with much lower gas taxes, such as the United States. Locally decreasing fuel tax can decrease fuel prices, but globally prices are set by supply and demand, and therefore fuel tax decreases may have no effect on fuel prices, and fuel tax increases might actually decrease fuel prices by reducing demand.Why Are Gasoline Prices High (And What Can Be Done About It)? But this depends on the price elasticity of demand for fuel which is -0.09 to -0.31, meaning that fuel is a relatively inelastic commodity, i.e. increasing or decreasing prices have overall only a small effect on demand and therefore price change. =Demand management= Transportation demand management has the potential to be an effective policy response to fuel shortagesGueret, Thomas Travel Demand Management Insights IEA conference 2005 or price increases and has a greater probability of long term benefits than other mitigation options.Litman, Todd \\"Appropriate Response to Rising Fuel Prices\\" Victoria Transport Policy Institute There are major differences in energy consumption for private transport between cities; an average U.S. urban dweller uses 24 times more energy annually for private transport as a Chinese urban resident. These differences cannot be explained by wealth alone but are closely linked to the rates of walking, cycling, and public transport use and to enduring features of the city including urban density and urban design.Kenworthy, J R Transport Energy Use and Greenhouse Emissions in Urban Passenger Transport Systems : A Study of 84 Global Cities Murdoch University For individuals, telecommuting provides alternatives to daily commuting and long-distance air travel for business. Technologies for telecommuting, such as videoconferencing, e-mail, and corporate wikis, continue to improve, in keeping with the overall improvement in information technologies ascribed to Moore's law. As the cost of moving human workers continues to rise, while the cost of moving information electronically continues to fall, presumably market forces should cause more people to substitute virtual travel for physical travel. Matthew Simmons explicitly calls for \\"liberating the workforce\\" by changing the corporate mindset from paying people to show up physically to work every day, to paying them instead for the work they do, from any location. This would allow many more information workers to work from home either part-time or full-time, or from satellite offices or Internet cafes near to where they live, freeing them from long daily commutes to central offices. However, even full adoption of telecommuting by all eligible workers might only decrease energy consumption by about 1% (with present energy savings estimated at 0.01–0.04%). By comparison, a 20% increase in automobile fuel economy would save 5.4%. =Political action against market speculation= The price rises of mid-2008 led to a variety of proposals to change the rules governing energy markets and energy futures markets, in order to prevent rises due to market speculation. On 26 July 2008, the United States House of Representatives passed the Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008 (H.R. 6377),Energy Markets Emergency Act of 2008 , Opencongress.org which directs the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \\"to utilize all its authority, including its emergency powers, to curb immediately the role of excessive speculation in any contract market within the jurisdiction and control of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, on or through which energy futures or swaps are traded, and to eliminate excessive speculation, price distortion, sudden or unreasonable fluctuations or unwarranted changes in prices, or other unlawful activity causing major market disturbances that prevent the market from accurately reflecting the forces of supply and demand for energy commodities.\\" Notes External links * U.S. DOE EIA energy chronology and analysis * Oil Price History and Analysis 2000s economic history History of the petroleum industry Economic bubbles Peak oil Petroleum economics Presidency of Barack Obama Presidency of George W.

Early life and education Leonor Michaelis was born in Berlin, Germany on January 16, 1875 and graduated from the humanistic Koellnisches Gymnasium in 1893 after passing the Abiturienten Examen. He was Jewish.https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/leonor-michaelis-and- maud-leonora-menten It was here that Michaelis’ interest in physics and chemistry was first sparked as he was encouraged by his teachers to utilize the relatively unused laboratories at his school. With concerns about the financial stability of a pure scientist, he commenced his study of medicine at Berlin University in 1893. Among his instructors were Emil du Bois-Reymond for physiology, Emil Fischer for chemistry, and Oscar Hertwig for histology and embryology. During his time at Berlin University, Michaelis worked in the lab of Oscar Hertwig, even receiving prize for a paper on the histology of milk secretion. Michaelis’s doctoral thesis work on cleavage determination in frog eggs led him to write a textbook on embryology. Through his work at Hertwig’s lab, Michaelis came to know Paul Ehrlich and his work on blood cytology; he worked as Ehrlich’s private research assistant from 1898 to 1899. He passed his physician’s examination in 1896 in Freiburg, and then moved to Berlin, where he received his doctorate in 1897. After receiving his medical degree, Michaelis worked as a private research assistant to Moritz Litten (1899-1902) and for Ernst Viktor von Leyden (1902-1906).Leonor Michaelis 1875-1949 A Biographical Memoir by L.Michaelis, D.A.MacInnes and S.Granick J Life and work From 1900 to 1904, Michaelis continued his study of clinical medicine at a municipal hospital in Berlin, where he found time to establish a chemical laboratory. He attained the position of Privatdocent at the University of Berlin in 1903. In 1905 he accepted a position as director of the bacteriology lab in the Klinikum Am Urban, becoming Professor extraordinary at Berlin University in 1908. In 1914 he published a paper suggesting that Emil Abderhalden's notorious pregnancy tests could not be reproduced, a paper which fatally compromised Michaelis' position as an academic in Germany (L. Michaelis, L von Lagermark, Deutsche Med. Wochenschr. 1914, 7, 316–319). In 1922, Michaelis moved to the Medical School of the University of Nagoya (Japan) as Professor of biochemistry, becoming one of the first foreign professors at a Japanese university, bringing with him several documents, apparatuses and chemicals from Germany. His research in Japan focused on potentiometric measurements and the cellular membrane. In 1926, he moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore as resident lecturer in medical research and in 1929 to the Rockefeller Institute of Medical Research in New York City, where he retired in 1941. Michael is mostly remembered for the formulation of the Michaelis–Menten equation v = frac{Va}{K_mathrm{m} + a} for a steady- state rate v in terms of the substrate concentration a and constants V and K_mathrm{m} (written with modern symbols). Michaelis became the leading world expert on pH and buffers, and his book was the major reference on the subject for decades. In his later career he worked extensively on quinones, and discovered Janus green as a supravital stain for mitochondria and the Michaelis–Gutmann body in urinary tract infections (1902). He found that thioglycolic acid could dissolve keratin, a discovery that would come to have several implications in the cosmetic industry, including the permanent wave (\\"perm\\").

The Bloomsbury group in London was one example, providing a place where the diverse talents of people like Virginia Woolf, Leonard Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, and E.M. Forster could interact. Other pre-World War I subcultures were smaller social groupings of hobbyists or a matter of style and philosophy amongst artists and bohemian poets. In Germany, from 1896, there developed a movement of young men (and later young women) which focused on freedom and natural environments. Called Wandervogel (translated as \\"hikers\\", \\"ramblers\\" or, more precisely, \\"migratory birds\\"), they wanted to throw off the strict rules of society and be more open and natural. The first known organized club for nudists, Freilichtpark (Free-Light Park), was opened near Hamburg, Germany, in 1903. In Italy, a popular art movement and philosophy called Futurism championed change, speed, violence and machines. =World War I= After the First World War (1914–18) hair styles changed: the wartime trenches were infested with lice and fleas, so soldiers were forced to shave their heads. Consequently, men with short hair appeared to have been at the front in the war, while men with longer hair might be thought of as pacifists and cowards, even suspected of desertion. Some artists managed to avoid the war by sitting it out in neutral Switzerland. A group of artists in Zürich invented Dadaism as an anti-war, anti-art, art movement, and a parody of the pro-violent attitudes of Futurism. =1920s= Jazz music, previously restricted to mainly poor African-Americans, broke out as the musical craze of the 1920s. In the 1920s, American jazz music and motor cars were at the centre of a European subculture which began to break the rules of social etiquette and the class system (See also Swing Kids and Flappers). In America, the same \\"flaming youth\\" subculture was \\"running wild\\" but with the added complication of alcohol prohibition. Canada had prohibition in some areas, but for the most part, thirsty Americans coming over the border found an oasis. As a result, smuggling escalated as crime gangs became organized. In the southern United States, Mexico and Cuba were popular with drinkers. Thus, a drinking subculture grew in size and a crime subculture grew along with it. Other drugs were used as alternatives to alcohol. When prohibition ended, the subculture of drink, drugs and jazz did not disappear, and neither did the gangsters. =1930s= The German nudist movement gained prominence in the 1920s, but was suppressed during the Nazi Gleichschaltung after Adolf Hitler came to power. Social nudism in the form of private clubs and campgrounds first appeared in the United States in the 1930s. In Canada, it first appeared in British Columbia about 1939 and in Ontario nine years later. In the art world, Surrealism was attempting to shock the world with their games and bizarre behavior. The Surrealists were at one and the same time a serious art movement and a parody of other art forms and political movements. Surrealism had been developed by André Breton and others from the Dada movement. Based in several European countries, Surrealism was destined for trouble when the Nazis came to power. Subcultures and \\"degenerate art\\" were almost completely stamped out and replaced by the Hitler Youth. In North America, the Great Depression caused widespread unemployment and poverty, and a consequent malaise among adolescents that found its expression in urban youth gangs—the so-called \\"dead end kids.\\" The dead end kid phenomenon was fictionalized on the stage and screen where it became a popular image with which people could identify. Films featuring the Dead End Kids, East Side Kids, Little Tough Guys etc. were popular from the 1930s to the 1950s. The genre also found its expression in the kid gang comic book stories of Jack Kirby and Joe Simon, including the Boy Commandos and Newsboy Legion features. The Dust bowl disaster forced large numbers of rural Americans from Oklahoma and elsewhere to move their entire families to survive. They were labeled as \\"Okies\\" and treated poorly by the authorities in other states. Their refugee status was recorded in folk songs (including many by Woody Guthrie), as well as John Steinbeck's novel, The Grapes of Wrath, and the film adaptation starring Henry Fonda. =1940s= Avant-garde artists like Max Ernst, Marcel Duchamp and Marc Chagall fled Europe following the outbreak of World War II. These artists arrived in the United States, where a subculture of surrealism and avant-garde experimentation developed in New York City, becoming the new centre of the art world. American fashion remained gangster orientated, with gangs gravitating around immigrant and racial cultures. In California, Hispanic youth developed the distinctive zoot suit fashion, such as the black widows, women who dressed in black. The zoot suiters use of language involved rhyming and pig Latin (also known as backslang). This style, collectively known as Swing or Jive talk (see: Dictionary of Swing), included Afro-American, Cuban, Mexican and South American elements, as well as bits introduced by Slim Gaillard (see 'McVouty oreeney). The entry of the United States into World War II was heralded by new legislation making zoot suits illegal due to the extra cloth required. In June 1943, white American servicemen stationed in Los Angeles rampaged through Mexican American neighborhoods, attacking young people wearing the suits and often stripping them, in what has become known as the Zoot Suit Riots. The riots in Los Angeles were part of a nationwide phenomenon of urban disturbances arising out of wartime tensions exacerbating longstanding racial discrimination in America. The Zoot Suit Riots were unique in that the fashions of the largely Mexican American (and some white and African-American) victims made them the target of white servicemen stationed in the city, many of whom were from southern white towns. In Europe, black- marketeers prospered under rationing. Clothing styles depended on what could be begged or acquired by some means, not necessarily legal; There were restrictions everywhere. When the Americans arrived in Britain, black- marketeers, (called Wide boys or Spivs) made deals with GIs for stockings, chocolate, etc. Inevitably, subculture continued to have an image of criminality and the brave, the daring, the milieu, the resistance, etc. The black market in drugs thrived just about anywhere. After the second war, the zoot suit craze spread to France in the form of the Zazou youths. Meanwhile, the intellectuals in France were forming an existentialist subculture around Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus in Paris cafe culture. In post-war America, folk songs and cowboy songs (also known, in those days, as hillbilly music) were beginning to be more popular with a wider audience. A subculture of rural jazz and blues fans had mixed elements of jazz and blues into traditional cowboy and folk song styles to produce a crossover called western swing. Thanks to the prevalence of radio, this music spread across the United States in the 1940s. Radio was the first almost instantaneous mass media with the power to create large subcultures by spreading the ideas of small subcultures across a wide area. Bebop, a new jazz subculture, formed from the rebellion against the melodic stylings of swing; Notable players included Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker. In turn, bebop spawned the hipster and beat generation subculture. In 1947, Jack Kerouac made an epic journey across America, which he would later describe in his novel, On the Road. In the same year, there was an incident involving a motorcycle gang at Hollister, California, and Harper's Magazine, published a story about it. In 1948, the Hells Angels formed in Fontana, California. The Hells Angels began as a motorcycle club looking for excitement in the dull times after the end of the war and became notorious as time passed. Motorcycle gangs in general began to hit the headlines. In 1953, the film, The Wild One, was released starring Marlon Brando. =1950s= The Existentialists had a profound influence upon subcultural development. Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus transferred their French resistance underground campaign to the context of a cultural revolution and the American beat scene joined the movement. The emphasis on freedom of the individual influenced the beats in America and Britain and this version of existential bohemianism continued through the 1950s and into the 1960s under the guise of the beat generation. Beards and longer hair returned in another attempt at returning to the image of peacetime man and the normality which had existed before the two wars. At the same time, as a result of American post- war prosperity, a new identity emerged for youth subculture: the teenager. Jazz culture was transformed, by way of Rhythm and Blues into Rock and Roll culture. There are various suggested candidates for which record might have been the First rock and roll record. At the same time, jazz culture itself continued but changed into a more respected form, no longer necessarily associated with wild behaviour and criminality. From the 1950s onward society noticed an increase in street gang culture, random vandalism and graffiti. Sociologists, psychologists, social workers and judges all had theories as to what was causing the increase to urban trouble, but it was later accepted that it developed in protest to the older generation's pro-white supremacy views. The consensus has generally tended to be that the modern urban environment offers all the bright lights and benefits of the modern world but often provides working class youths with little in reality. This theory and others were parodied in the musical West Side Story (based on Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet) in song lyrics such as Jet Song, America, and Gee, Officer Krupke. Moral panics surrounding the advent of teenager subcultures and a perceived rise in adolescent criminality led to several attempts to investigate and legislate youth behavior, such as the Senate Subcommittee on Juvenile Delinquency. One of the many subcultures that was based around street violence was the greaser, a working class subculture that was a part of and influenced the biker subculture. As American rock and roll arrived in the United Kingdom, a subculture grew around it. Some of the British post-war street youths hanging around bombsites in urban areas and getting drawn into petty crime began to dress in a variation of the zoot suit style called a drape suit, with a country style bootlace tie, winklepicker shoes, drainpipe trousers, and Elvis Presley style slicked hair. These youths were called Teddy boys. For a night out dancing at the palais, their girlfriends would usually wear the same sort of poodle skirts and crinolines their counterparts in America would wear. For day-to-day wear there was a trend toward girls wearing slacks or jeans. At the time, the idea of girls wearing trousers and boys taking time over their hairstyles was socially shocking to many people. British youth divided into factions. There were the modern jazz kids, the trad jazz kids, the rock and roll teenagers and the skiffle craze. Coffee bars were a meeting place for all the types of youth and the coolest ones were said to be in Soho, London. In Britain, the political side of the Beat Generation was the anti-nuclear movement led by CND. Ban the Bomb marches became a very successful British social phenomenon. Teenage music and subculture was parodied in the 1957 play (and 1962 movie) The Music Man, particularly in the song \\"Ya Got Trouble\\". In the United States and Australia, Hawaiian-influenced Surfing was the new youth sport. A whole subculture grew around the sport and the associated parties, clothes, speech patterns and music. During the same time-frame skateboard riding developed as a parallel lifestyle to wave riding. Both forms of board riding continued throughout the remainder of the century and into the next. From these two sports young people learned to provide their own social structure within which they could display skills and excellence. In the Congo Free State (now known as the Democratic Republic of the Congo), a youth subculture known as the Bills flourished, taking Western movies and cowboys as their main influence. In the Netherlands, two youth groups evolved in big cities like Amsterdam, Rotterdam and Utrecht. One group, the Nozems, similar to the British Teds, and another called the Artistiekelingen, who can be compared to the bohemian artists of pre-world-war France. The Nozems spent their time listening to rock and roll music, driving motorcycles through town and picking up ladies while the Artistiekelingen would discuss philosophy, paint, draw and listen to jazz music. =1960s= In the 1960s, the beats (AKA beatniks) grew to be an even larger subculture, spreading around the world. Other 1960s subcultures included radicals, mods, rockers, bikers, hippies and the freak scene. One of the main transitional features between the beat scene and the hippies was the Merry Pranksters' journey across the United States with Neal Cassady and Ken Kesey, in a psychedelically-painted school bus named Further. In the US, the hippies' big year was 1967, the so-called summer of love. The rude boy culture originated in the ghettos of Jamaica, coinciding with the popular rise of rocksteady music, dancehall celebrations and sound system dances. Rude boys dressed in the latest fashions, and many were involved with gangs and violence. This subculture then spread to the United Kingdom and other countries. The mod subculture began with a few cliques of trendy teenage boys in London, England in the late 1950s, but was at its most popular during the early 1960s. Mods were obsessed with new fashions such as slim-cut suits; and music styles such as modern jazz, rhythm and blues, soul, ska, and some beat music. Many of them rode scooters. The mod and rude boy cultures both influenced the skinhead subculture of the late 1960s. The skinheads were a harder, more working class version of mods who wore basic clean-cut clothing styles and favoured ska, rocksteady, soul and early reggae music. The disco scene originated in the 1960s, with discothèques such as the Whiskey A Go Go and Studio 54. Subcultures were often based on socializing and wild behaviour, but some of them were centred around politics. In the United States, these included the Black Panthers and the Yippies. Allen Ginsberg took part in several protest movements, including those for gay rights and those against the Vietnam War and nuclear weapons. In Paris, France in May 1968, there was a university student uprising, supported by Jean-Paul Sartre and 121 other intellectuals who signed a statement asserting \\"the right to disobedience.\\" The uprising brought the country to a standstill, and caused the government to call a general election rather than run the risk of being toppled from power. The Hacker culture was beginning to form in the 1960s, due to the increased usage of computers at colleges and universities. Students who were fascinated by the possible uses of computers and other technologies began figuring out ways to make technology more freely accessible. The international Happening and Fluxus movements also had its beginnings in the 1960s, evolving out of the Beat subculture. =1970s= In the 1970s, the hippie, mod and rocker subcultures were in a process of transformation, which temporarily took on the name of freaks (openly embracing the image of strangeness). A growing awareness of identity politics combined with the legalisation of homosexuality and a huge amount of interest in science fiction and fantasy forms of speculative writing produced the freak scene. Bands on the freak circuit cultivated an anti-capitalist, communal lifestyle. Freak bands like The Edgar Broughton Band or The Pink Fairies played at free festivals, spurning mainstream venues. The music/fashion subculture that became a commercial alternative to the freaks was glam rock. It was a continuation of the trendies of the 1960s mod culture, appealing to the androgynous trend of the 1970s. At some point, some in the hacker/computer subculture took on the derogatory word geek with pride, in the same way the freaks had done. Computer usage was still a very inaccessible secret world to most people in those days, but many people were interested in computers because of their appearance in science fiction. The dream of one day owning a computer was a popular fantasy amongst science fiction fandom, which had grown from a minor subculture in the first half of the 20th century to a quite large contingent by the 1970s, along with horror fandom, comics fandom and fantasy freaks. The skinhead subculture from the late 1960s continued into the 1970s, and some skinheads became influenced by the punk subculture. These skinheads became associated with the Oi! genre, and some skinheads became involved with far right politics, creating the white power skinhead scene (despite the fact that the original 1960s skinheads were influenced by black culture). Disco, which had begun in gay dance clubs, became a significant from about 1975 onward. In some sectors, particularly in the New York City area, where disco had seemingly \\"taken over\\" all aspects of youth life, an aggressive counter-disco movement was born. New York area rock radio stations such as WPLJ and WPIX encouraged their listeners to destroy disco records and embrace rock and roll. Musically and lyrically, punk rock was the intentional antithesis of the disco scene, the progressive rock genre and the hippie subculture. Early punks played aggressive, quick-paced three- chord rock and roll songs. Within the decay of the hippie subculture, some of the remaining branches of bikers progressively turned in metalheads with succeeding aesthetics of horror and violence of late 1960s that influenced progressive rock (hard rock) in the more obscure form of early heavy metal. Metalheads preserved the instituted use of long hairs, took garnments from leather culture of late 1970s and formed a culture on separatism and orthodoxy against mainstream. In 1976, a hit song \\"Convoy\\" by C.W. McCall arrived in the pop charts and romanticised the Trucker and CB radio subculture. In 1978, the song inspired a film \\"Convoy\\" directed by Sam Peckinpah, and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw, Ernest Borgnine, and Burt Young. The word \\"convoy\\" and quotes from the song lyrics became part of a popular cultural image of people standing up for their freedom. Gradually, from the 1960s, 1970s and through into the 1980s, the cultural influences of the Merry Pranksters, the freak scene, the New Age movement and the Convoy idea seem to have coalesced into what became New age travellers. Beginning around 1976, the anarcho-punk scene in the UK developed the band Crass and related bands, including The Poison Girls. The Crass Records label was an independent operation, enabling bands with an extremely raw sound to put out records when the major labels might not have bothered with them. Crass also organised gigs around the country for themselves and other bands, and campaigned politically for the anti-nuclear movement other causes. Mods made a comeback in the late 1970s as a post-punk mod revival, inspired by The Jam and the British film Quadrophenia. In 1979, Usenet was created as a medium of communication over the, still very primitive, Internet of the time. The Usenet and the Bulletin board system (BBS) subculture would become increasingly significant over the next few decades. Also in 1979, Papa Wemba, a Rumba star in Zaire/Democratic Republic of the Congo, Africa began to be the leader of the Sapeur ('Société des Ambianceurs et des Personnes d'Élégance' thus 'SAPE' for short), which he promoted as a youth cult.CBC Radio Dispatches, \\"Revellers and Elegant People\\", February 10, 2011 Papa Wemba's music has been influenced by previous stars of Rumba music in Zaire (such as Papa Wendo) and also by his visits to Europe and by the appearance, in 1974, of James Brown at the Rumble in the Jungle. Wemba said: > The Sapeur cult promoted high standards of personal cleanliness, hygiene and > smart dress, to a whole generation of youth across Zaire. When I say well- > groomed, well-shaven, well-perfumed, it's a propriety that I am insisting on > among the young. I don't care about their education, since education always > comes first of all from the family. =1980s= At the beginning of the 1980s, some of the followers of punk rock became bored with it and wanted to make it more stylish and introduce elements of glam. By 1981, this trend resulted in the development of the New Romantics, a group whose preferred music was synthesiser electropop. New Romantics tended to be slightly campy and fey, and visually there was an androgynous vibe to the subculture, regardless of the individual's sexual orientation. Clothing styles demonstrated a return to the freak scene's roleplay of fashions from previous eras or imagined future ones in order to use fashion to create a time warp. According to the music press at the time, the New Romantics identified themselves using a number of alternative terms including \\"Futurists\\" and \\"the cult with no name.\\" Other punk rock followers took the genre and culture further underground, where it evolved into a faster, harder genre coined as hardcore punk. Along with the hardcore scene came the straight edge subculture. Straight edge is a lifestyle that advocates abstinence in relation to tobacco, alcohol and recreational drug use (especially psychoactive and stimulant drug use), and for some people, in relation to promiscuous sexual behavior. Other former punks searching for a new direction around 1979 eventually developed into the nucleus of what became the goth subculture. The goths are a subculture of dark dress and gloomy romanticism. Unlike the New Romantics, goth has lasted into the 21st century. In the UK, goth reached its popular peak in the late 1980s. In American urban environments, a form of street culture using freeform and semi-staccato poetry, combined with athletic break dancing, was developing as the Hip hop and Rap subculture. In jazz jargon, the word rap had always meant speech and conversation. The new meaning signified a change in the status of poetry from an elitist artform to a community sport. Rappers could attempt to outdo each other with their skillful rhymes. Rapping is also known as MCing, which is one of the four main elements of Hip hop: MCing, DJing, graffiti art, and breakdancing. From the early to mid-1980s, poetry culture in a broader sense caught the same kind of energy as rap and so began the first of the poetry slams. Poetry slamming became an irregular focus for the latest wave of poetry aficionados. In 1985, Stonehenge Free Festival was disrupted by a massive police presence attempting to prevent the festival and break up the Peace Convoy. The resulting Battle of the Beanfield was the largest mass civil arrest in English history. Free parties and raves began from the mid-80s and became a flourishing subculture. The music embraced by this subculture was electronic dance music which developed from Techno, pioneered in Detroit and Chicago by people like Juan Atkins, Derrick May, and Kevin Saunderson, as well as electronic music, pioneered by Karlheinz Stockhausen, John Cage and others, taken by way of progressive rock bands like Hawkwind, filtered through the sounds of dub-reggae and the electropop bands like Kraftwerk and Depeche Mode and given a different twist via Art of Noise and early hip hop and recycled psychedelia. Towards the end of the 80s rave culture had diversified into different forms connected to music such as Acid House and Acid Jazz and would continue to diversify into the 90s. Rave culture thrived from the mid-80s to the end of the century and beyond. The Usenet and BBS subculture had developed a subculture which involved its own forms of etiquette and behaviour patterns both social and anti-social and the phenomena of trolling, spamming, flaming etc. The computer subculture was also influenced by fictional subcultures in cyberpunk literature. =1990s= The term Generation X or Gen X, popularized by Douglas Coupland's novel Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was used to describe the generation that followed the Baby Boom Generation, or those who came to adulthood in the late 1980s and early 1990s. In the UK, the Britpop scene arose in the 1990s, influenced by the 1960s mods, the 1970s/1980s mod revival, and other British rock music and subcultural styles. On the West Coast of the United States became popular a style of alternative rock known as Grunge, pioneered by bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden and Mudhoney, which developed his associated subculture. One of the main technological developments of the 1990s was the World Wide Web. Running on the older infrastructure of the Internet, the web allowed small subcultures to grow into large global online communities. Online game communities, forums, chat rooms and Internet cafes became popular. The 1990s saw the rise of the anti- globalization movement. This was a response to the increased impact of globalisation and global capitalism. The anti-globalisation protest movement was accompanied by the fair trade movement. 21st century Named in relation to Generation X, Generation Y or \\"Echo Boomers\\" (a reference to the fact that many of the parents of this generation had belonged to the Baby boomer generation) consisted of individuals that had come to adulthood during the 2000s. Subcultures that emerged or became popular in the first decade of the 21st century included Emo, Scene and Chav. The Emo subculture, rooted in the Post Hardcore genre of hardcore punk, changed over the years becoming more mainstream, following the commercial success in early '2000s. The contemporary hipster became prominent in the 2010s. On March 20, 2014, Alexis Petridis, a journalist for the British newspaper The Guardian, claimed that subcultures were rapidly declining, with only Emos and metalheads having any visual significance. Throughout the mid to late 2010s, subcultures splintered and merged due to the widespread accessibility of the internet and social media platforms. Many 2010s subcultures drew from previously existing groups - the popular 'e-girl' subculture is seen as a modern spin on mid-2000s scene fashion. As part of their retrospective series on the 2010s, Dazed magazine described the impact of technology on subcultures; \\"But [the internet] also gave us more; it gave us dozens upon dozens of scenes and movements, only recognisable to the highly trained eye. And the rules became less rigid: you could dress one way, and listen to totally different music.\\" Modern subcultures include e-girls, Koreaboos, art hoes, hypebeasts, Instagram baddies, soft boys, skaters, and revivals of 1970s-1990s subcultures such as hippies, goths, punks, and grunge.

The Sutlej River (also known by the Tibetan name Langqen Zangbo in this area) originates at Rakshastal's northwestern tip. Despite its close proximity to Lake Manasarovar (about ), Lake Rakshastal does not share the historic religious significance of its eastern neighbor. Etymology The name of the lake literally means \\"lake of the demon\\" in Sanskrit. It is also known as Ravan Tal, as it is considered to be the place of severe penance by Ravan, the demon-like King of Lanka in Hindu theology. In Buddhism, Lake Manasarovar, which is round like the sun, and Rakshastal, shaped as a crescent, are respectively regarded as \\"brightness\\" and \\"darkness\\". Rakshastal is a saline lake. There is a short river named Ganga Chhu, which connects Lake Manasarovar with Rakshastal, believed to be created by rishis to add pure water from Manasarovar. There are four islands in Rakshastal, named Topserma (Dose), Dola (the two biggest), Lachato (Nadzhado), and Dosharba. The islands are used by local people as winter pastures for their yaks. In the Tibetan language, the lake is known as Lagngar Cho or Lhanag Tso, which means \\"the dark lake of poison\\". Mythology According to Hindu scriptures, Rakshastal was created by Ravana for the express purpose of garnering superpowers through acts of devotion and meditation to the god, Shiva, who resided on Mount Kailash. It was upon the banks of a special island in this lake that he would make a daily offering with one of his ten heads as a sacrifice to please Shiva. Finally, on the tenth day, Shiva was moved enough by his devotion to grant Ravana his wish to obtain superpowers. As there are no plants or wildlife around the lake, its lifeless surroundings caused the Tibetans to refer it as \\"the Ghost Lake\\". Visitors who approach the lake must be respectful to avoid inauspicious mishaps.Lhanag Tso(The Ghost Lake), Ngari Tourist Sights, Tibet Travel.Info Geography Rakshastal covers a total area of , at an altitude of .

Louvre Museum Hugh IV (1293×96 – 10 October 1359) was King of Cyprus from 31 March 1324 to his abdication, on 24 November 1358 and, nominally, King of Jerusalem, as Hugh II, until his death. The son of Guy, Constable of Cyprus (son of Hugh III of Cyprus), and Eschiva of Ibelin, Hugh succeeded his father as Constable of Cyprus in 1318, and later succeeded to the throne of Cyprus on the death of his uncle Henry II, since Henry II had no son. He was a member of the House of Poitiers-Lusignan. History Hugh appears to have been content to rule Cyprus, as he prevented his son, Peter I, from going to Western Europe to recruit support for a new crusade to recover their Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1344, he joined a league with Venice and the Knights Hospitaller which burnt a Turkish fleet in Smyrna and captured the city. In 1347 the allies defeated the Turks at Imbros by land and sea, but Hugh could see little benefit for his kingdom in these endeavors and withdrew from the league. He was crowned as King of Cyprus at Saint Sophia Cathedral, Nicosia, on 15 April or 25 April 1324. In the same year, on 13 May, he was crowned at Saint Nicholas Cathedral, Famagusta as King of Jerusalem. As a leader, King Hugh signed an agreement with Venice, which had to do with the activities of the Venician merchants who were settling in Cyprus. That caused problems with the Republic of Genoa who were rivals of the Venetians; however he negotiated with them and had agreement in 1329. The Genoese demanded that Hugh pay the debit of his uncle Henry II. He died in Nicosia. During his reign, he was strict about issues relating to justice. When his two sons left without his permission for a trip in Europe, he arrested the man who helped them to leave the island, he imprisoned and tortured him, and he cut off a hand and a foot before he hanged him in April 1349. He managed to bring back his two sons and he imprisoned them. Other sources show that he was well educated and had an interest in art, literature, and philosophy and had much knowledge of Latin literature. He owned a summer villa in Lapithos and organised philosophical meetings. The Italian writer Boccaccio, wrote Genealogia Deorum Gentilium at the request of Hugh IV. Hugh resigned the crown to his son, Peter I (rather than his grandson Hugh) in 1358, and died on 10 October 1359 in Nicosia. Family Hugh was married twice, both times to ladies of the House of Ibelin, whose fathers were both named \\"Guy of Ibelin\\", one being Count of Jaffa and the other Seneschal of Cyprus. * Hugh's first marriage was in 1307/1310 to Marie d'Ibelin (1294 – before 30 June 1318), daughter of Guy of Ibelin (1250–1304), Count of Jaffa, and wife and cousin Marie d'Ibelin, Lady of Askalon and Naumachia. They had: ** Guy of Lusignan (c. 1316 or 1315–1316 – soon before 24 September 1343 and buried in Nicosia), Constable of Cyprus (1336–1338) and titular Prince of Galilee ca. 1320. He married by proxy at the Château de Bourbon on 29 November 1328 and in person at Santa Sophia, Nicosia on 15–30 January 1330 Marie of Bourbon (1315–1387 in Naples and buried there), Princess of Achaia. Guy and Marie had: *** Hugh of Lusignan (1335–1385/1386 in Cyprus), who succeeded his father as titular Prince of Galilee in 1343, Senator of Rome on 12 August 1360 and Lord of Arnecha and Leondaki in January 1365. He married after Autumn 1365 Marie de Morphou (d. after 1383), dau.of Sir Jean de Morphou, Comte de Roucha, without issue. * His second marriage took place on 18 June 1318, to Alix of Ibelin (1304/1306 – after 6 August 1386 and buried at Saint Dominic's, Nicosia), daughter of Guy of Ibelin by his wife and cousin Isabelle d'Ibelin. Children with Alice were: ** Eschiva of Lusignan (c. 1323 or 1322–1324 – of the plague, 1363 and buried in Nicosia), married after 5 March 1337/1339, separated since 22 April 1341, Ferdinand of Majorca (March/April, 1317 – ca. 1343/1347), Viscount of Aumelàs. ** Peter I of Lusignan (1328–1369), succeeded him as King of Cyprus and Jerusalem. ** John of Lusignan (c. 1329 or 1329/1330–1375), Regent of Cyprus and Titular Prince of Antioch, murdered, married twice, firstly in 1343 to Constance, daughter of Frederick III of Sicily and Eleanor of Anjou, without issue, and secondly in 1350 to Alice of Ibelin (d. after 1373), by whom he had issue ** James I of Lusignan (1334–1398), succeeded his nephew Peter II of Cyprus.

In 2005, he retired from the SETI Institute. Early life and education Cullers was born 1949 in El Reno, Oklahoma, the son of an oil field engineer. His birth was premature and to save his life he was placed in an incubator filled with pure oxygen. The excess oxygen damaged his retinas, leaving him totally blind. His father, a physicist, read astronomy books to Cullers as a child, influencing the boy's later aspirations. He grew up in Temple City, California, where he was a highly ranked student. He first studied psychology at nearby Pomona College, but against great resistance changed his major to physics midway through college. He received his Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley in 1980. He is the first totally blind physicist in the United States, and is believed to be the first astronomer who was blind from birth (although some astronomers have become blind in their old age, most notably Galileo Galilei). Career Kent Cullers worked for NASA's Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program upon graduating from Berkeley. From 1985 to 1990, he was the Targeted Search Signal Detection Team Leader with the SETI Institute. He developed advanced computer algorithms for detection of continuous and pulsed signals originating from distant Earth-like planets. From 1990 to March 1994, he was the signal detection subsystem manager for the High Resolution Microwave Survey (HRMS) Project at NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, California. He supervised the development of hardware and software for signal detection for HRMS. From 1993 to March 1994, Cullers led the SETI Research & Technology effort and managed the upgrading and replication of all the digital data processing equipment for HRMS. NASA's HRMS Project was cancelled by the United States Congress in October 1993, but Cullers still participated in Project Phoenix, the SETI Institute's continuation of the Targeted Search portion of HRMS. He resigned from NASA in October 1995, and rejoined the SETI Institute as a senior scientist and project manager for Project Phoenix. Dr. Cullers retired from the SETI Institute in 2005. In popular culture Kent Cullers was the subject of a short documentary film produced by his wife, photographer Lisa Powers. In 1997, he was portrayed by actor William Fichtner as the fictional character Kent Clark in the movie Contact.

Spring-powered ballistic knives first appeared in books and press reports on Soviet and Eastern Bloc armed forces in the late 1970s. Commercially-produced ballistic knives briefly gained notoriety in the United States in the mid-1980s after they were marketed and sold in the United States and other Western countries. Since then, the marketing and sale of ballistic knives to civilians has been restricted or prohibited by law in several nations. Usage In its spring- propelled form, the blade of a ballistic knife is theoretically capable of being fired to an effective range of around 5 meters (about 16 feet) at a speed of 63 km/h (39 mph). Ballistic knives using compressed air or gas propulsion to fire the blade can be made somewhat more powerful, and do not suffer from spring fatigue over time. In addition to spring, air, or gas propulsion, the blade of a ballistic knife may also be propelled by an explosive charge, such as a blank pistol cartridge. Development, usage, and laws =Soviet Union= The first press reports of what became known as the ballistic knife appeared in the late 1970s in connection with Soviet Union's special operations forces. In his book Inside The Aquarium, Viktor Suvorov described a ballistic knife as part of a Soviet spetsnaz trooper's equipment., Suvorov, Viktor, Inside The Aquarium: The Making of A Top Soviet Spy, New York: MacMillan & Co. (1986), , p. 41: \\"He [spetsnaz soldier] carries on his right calf a huge knife . . . and on his left calf four spare blades. The Spetsnaz knife is no ordinary knife. It has a powerful spring in it so that when you remove the safety catch and press the release button the knife blade shoots out with a terrible hiss . . . the blade can carry 25 meters. If It lands in a tree it is not always possible to pull it out\\" An NRS-2 combination knife/gun was designed and developed during the 1970s at the order of the Russian Ministry of Defence and KGB of the USSR.http://englishrussia.com/2015/04/06/special-soviet-shooting-knife/ However, the NRS-2 was not in fact a ballistic knife, but a gun hybrid (instead of launching the blade, a small barrel aligned with the blade fires a non-standard 7.62mm bullet). =United States= Commercial versions of the ballistic knife first appeared in the US market in the mid-1980s. After hearing uncorroborated testimony from a congressional witness that ballistic knives could be used to defeat body armor typically worn by police officers, and witnessing a staged demonstration against a wood-backed target,Mills, Doug, Police Officer Firing \\"Ballistic Knife\\" Across Room, Bettman Archive May 13, 1986, image © Bettmann/CORBIS Senator Alphonse D'Amato of New York introduced the Ballistic Knife Prohibition Act, a bill to ban sale or possession of ballistic knives. The bill eventually failed. However, after gaining the support of Senators Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona,Library of Congress Bills, Resolutions: S.2411, Ballistic Knife Prohibition Act, List of Sponsors (69) congressional support for a ban on import or possession of ballistic knives quickly gained traction. In September 1986 senators supporting the ballistic knife ban attached their bill to popular legislation designed to eradicate drug crops in foreign countries and halt international drug trafficking operations. The bill was subsequently enacted into law. The new federal statute prohibited future importation or possession of such knives in interstate commerce. Some individual states following the example set by the federal law and passed even tighter restrictions, sometimes banning ownership of the knives outright within their state. Similar to conventional automatic knives, federal law makes ballistic knives with a spring-operated bladeUSC Title 15, Ch. 29, Sec. 1245(d): \\"As used in this section, the term \\"ballistic knife\\" means a knife with a detachable blade that is propelled by a spring-operated mechanism.\\" illegal to possess, manufacture, sell, or import \\"in or affecting interstate commerce.\\" This means they are illegal to import from outside the United States, as well as buy or sell over state lines, including possessing or making them with intent to sell over state lines. The federal law also makes it a separate crime to use or possess a ballistic knife during the commission of a federal crime of violence, with a minimum sentence of 5 years in a federal prison. Federal law does not prohibit the possession, manufacture, or sale of a ballistic knife within a state's boundaries, and the individual laws of each state or territory must be consulted to determine whether possession, manufacture, or sale within a given state is legal (many states have statutes that regulate or prohibit the acquisition or possession of ballistic knives, and penalties vary from state to state). Like the federal switchblade law, an exception is made for sale to the United States Armed Forces within the confines of a contract, as well as possession by duly-authorized members of the Armed Forces in performance of their duty.15 U.S.C. 1245, paragraph (c) (referring to 15 U.S.C. 1244, paragraphs 1,2, and 3) Wayback Machine archive, 17 March 2012 A ballistic knife with a blade propelled by an explosive charge falls outside the Federal law pertaining to these devices, but still may be restricted as this makes it a firearm subject to the Any Other Weapons (AOW) category of the National Firearms Act. =United Kingdom= The legal status of ballistic knives or pilum knives is doubtful under current legislation in the United Kingdom, particularly given the degree of discretion granted to Crown prosecutors and the police with regard to classifying knives of an arguably offensive nature as prohibited items. Prosecutors are encouraged by the government to charge defendants under more than one Act where applicable.Crown Prosecution Service, Offensive Weapons, Knives, Bladed and Pointed Articles, updated April 16, 2010, retrieved September 11, 2011: \\"There is a strong public interest in deterring the carrying and use of knives and other offensive weapons. Accordingly, where there is sufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction, the public interest will normally require a prosecution.\\" Furthermore, in the UK it is customary for the Metropolitan Police, not a barrister, to be consulted as legal experts on a question of whether a given knife is to be considered illegal under existing UK knife laws,Behagg, Zoe, Illegal Knives Sold On eBay, BBC Watchdog, retrieved December 15, 2011: In a BBC 'sting' investigation of an auction site, the reporter brought several knives to the Metropolitan Police, including two knives described as \\"flick knives\\" that used thumb pressure on a blade protrusion to manually (not automatically) rotate the blade into the open position using one hand. These so-called \\"flick\\" knives were immediately seized and classified by an ordinary police sergeant as illegal flick knives even though the blades of the knives did not \\"open automatically\\" per Chapter 37, Section (1)(a) of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, as amended by Ch. 22, Sect. 1 of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1961. Wayback Machine archive, 12 February 2009 and this has resulted in a tendency to interpret any bladed object of questionable status as falling within the definition of a prohibited knife. Whilst \\"ballistic knives\\" are not specifically mentioned in any legislation, the marketing, sale, transfer, or possession in a public place of a ballistic knife could be construed to be illegal under the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, the Knives Act 1997, the Criminal Justice Act 1988, and the Prevention of Crime Act 1953. The Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 imposes criminal penalties for anyone who manufactures, sells or hires, or offers for sale or hire, or lends or gives to any other person \\"any knife which has a blade which opens automatically by hand pressure applied to a button, spring or other device in or attached to the handle of the knife.\\"Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959, May 14, 1959, Chapter 37-7 and 8 Eliz 2 The Knives Act 1997 prohibits the marketing of knives as offensive weapons, while the Criminal Justice Act 1988 prohibits the carrying of blades or sharply pointed objects in a public place without \\"good reason or lawful authority\\". Finally, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in any public place of an offensive weapon without \\"lawful authority or reasonable excuse.\\" The term \\"offensive weapon\\" is defined under the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 as: \\"any article made or adapted for use to causing injury to the person, or intended by the person having it with him for such use\\". Under the Prevention of Crime Act, knives otherwise 'exempt' from penalty under the Criminal Justice Act 1988 when carried for \\"good reason or lawful authority\\" may still be deemed illegal if authorities conclude the knife is being carried as an \\"offensive weapon\\" without \\"lawful authority or reasonable excuse\\".Bryan v. Mott, 62 Cr App R 71 (1976) 'Lawful authority’ means those occasions where people from time to time are required to carry weapons as a matter of governmental duty, such as police officers or members of the armed forces, not private persons, hence the 'lawful authority' language cannot be relied upon to establish an exemption from prosecution of private individuals.R. v. Spanner, Poulter and Ward, 1 Crim. L.R. 704 (1973): An offensive weapon carried by a private security guard was not exempt under the \\"lawful authority\\" provision of the Prevention of Crime Act 1953).

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 Census was 3,454. Education There are many pre-school facilities in the village including playgroups and nurseries. Primary education in the village is provided by Moulton Primary School, although it is not uncommon for children to attend other primary schools in the local area, for example Overstone, Pitsford or Parklands primary schools. Moulton School and Science College is a comprehensive school providing education for 11- to 18-year-olds, not only to those from Moulton but also to students from the surrounding villages. Moulton is home to Moulton College, an agricultural and trade orientated college. Church The Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Peter and St Paul. It is within the Conservative Evangelical tradition of the Church of England, and it has passed resolutions to reject the ordination of women. Notable residents John Sanderson (1578/9-c.1653) was living at Moulton in 1606/7. He purchased a substantial quantity of land in the parish in 1629 and apparently remained there for much if not all of the rest of his life. The village was the 18th-century home of William Carey. The church where he ministered, and the cottage in which he lived, are located at the west end of West Street. The village also has links with John Jeyes (of Jeyes Fluid fame) as Holly Lodge is found on the road from Moulton to Boughton (a building associated with the family). Holly Lodge has the 'Implement gate' (c. 1955), which is iconic of the rural beginnings of Moulton. Amenities The stone-built Gothic Revival style Methodist Chapel of 1835 with arched windows is next to the old school of 1878, now used by the Moulton Theatre. Moulton hosts an annual village festival (held in May) and is home to the Moulton Morris Dancers. The Moulton Sports Complex is also home to the Village Hall and is the current site of the Northampton Saints Hockey Club, The centre of Moulton houses the parish church and some shops and a post office. The local Co-op store was run by the Moulton Co-operative Society, an independent society and one of Britain's smallest until its merger with Midlands Co- operative Society in 2009. Moulton is home to a number of pubs including the iconic Cardigan Arms, The Telegraph, The Artichoke, a working men's club. Moulton also contains, on its fringe, the Northampton Fire and Rescue Service Headquarters. Geology The geology of Moulton is based on sedimentary rocks known as Oolite. Cornbrash, Inferior and Great Oolite rocks have dictated that the soils of Moulton are predominantly sands and clays, but small quantities of ironstone may be found.Martin, R.A. & Osborn, G. 1976. An Outline of the Geology of Northamptonshire, Northamptonshire Natural History Society and Field Club. This ironstone was used extensively for construction of buildings in and outside of Moulton. Moulton's elevation lies at 400–600 ft above sea level and the nature of the soil means that it is relatively free of flooding and drains well without becoming too dry. The alluvial nature of the soil means that it is fertile and can be used to grow a wide range of plants. Geography Moulton has a population of over 3,000. It is situated about north of central Northampton. Moulton has been affected by the expansion of Northampton yet retains a village identity. It is thought that the village has its origins in Saxon times, although the main features of the present church are Norman or later. Moulton is a village of narrow winding lanes, lined by stone-built cottages and houses, nowadays with traffic calming and one-way systems. In the area of Moulton Leys in the south, the Kettering Road takes residents from Moulton to Northampton town centre. The boundaries of Moulton extend from Pitsford reservoir in the north to Moulton Lane in the south. In the east, the A43 (Kettering Road) is the border, with a small quantity of land that adjoins the east side of the A43 near Ashley Lane. The western fringe corresponds with all land east of Spectacle Lane. The topography of Moulton is generally flat, but the gradient of land runs from a higher southern elevation in towards lower parts, in the village centre, and then elevates again in a northern direction. At the northern boundary the lower elevations of the reservoir are separated from the village by a strip of high ground. In the village centre, a tributary of the Nene river flows from the east of the village in a westerly direction where it joins the Nene near Chapel Brampton. Medieval fish ponds in the village were fed from this tributary. Crowfields Meadow is part of Moulton village and boasts a range of wildlife and plants. Boughton Lane Pocket Park on the Southern end of Moulton is another source of animal and plant biodiversity. The A43 Moulton Bypass provisionally opened on 6 February 2020, removing through traffic from the village.

Weisstein, Concise Encyclopedia of Mathematics CD-ROM, Bipolar Coordinates, CD-ROM edition 1.0, May 20, 1999 Confusingly, the same term is also sometimes used for two-center bipolar coordinates. There is also a third system, based on two poles (biangular coordinates). The term \\"bipolar\\" is further used on occasion to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses, hyperbolas, and Cassini ovals. However, the term bipolar coordinates is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used for systems associated with those other curves, such as elliptic coordinates. Geometric interpretation of the bipolar coordinates. The angle σ is formed by the two foci and the point P, whereas τ is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci. The corresponding circles of constant σ and τ are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.  Definition  The system is based on two foci F1 and F2. Referring to the figure at right, the σ-coordinate of a point P equals the angle F1 P F2, and the τ-coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d1 and d2: : tau = ln frac{d_1}{d_2}. If, in the Cartesian system, the foci are taken to lie at (−a, 0) and (a, 0), the coordinates of the point P are : x = a  frac{sinh tau}{cosh tau - cos sigma}, qquad y = a  frac{sin sigma}{cosh tau - cos sigma}. The coordinate τ ranges from -infty (for points close to F1) to infty (for points close to F2). The coordinate σ is only defined modulo 2π, and is best taken to range from -π to π, by taking it as the negative of the acute angle F1 P F2 if P is in the lower half plane.  Proof that coordinate system is orthogonal  The equations for x and y can be combined to give : x + i y = a i cotleft( frac{sigma + i tau}{2}right). This equation shows that σ and τ are the real and imaginary parts of an analytic function of x+iy (with logarithmic branch points at the foci), which in turn proves (by appeal to the general theory of conformal mapping) that the curves of σ and τ intersect at right angles, i.e., that the coordinate system is orthogonal. This can be proven by first differentiating x and y with respect to sigma and tau and thenreversing the logic of the section below for finding the scale factors.  Curves of constant σ and τ  280px 280px The curves of constant σ correspond to non-concentric circles : x^2 + left( y - a cot sigma right)^2 = frac{a^{2}}{sin^2 sigma} that intersect at the two foci. The centers of the constant-σ circles lie on the y-axis. Circles of positive σ are centered above the x-axis, whereas those of negative σ lie below the axis. As the magnitude σ- π/2 decreases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0, 0), which is reached when σ = π/2. (From elementary geometry, all triangles on a circle with 2 vertices on opposite ends of a diameter are right triangles.) The curves of constant tau are non- intersecting circles of different radii : y^2 + left( x - a coth tau right)^2 = frac{a^2}{sinh^2 tau} that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant-τ circles lie on the x-axis. The circles of positive τ lie in the right-hand side of the plane (x > 0), whereas the circles of negative τ lie in the left-hand side of the plane (x < 0). The τ = 0 curve corresponds to the y-axis (x = 0). As the magnitude of τ increases, the radius of the circles decreases and their centers approach the foci. Reciprocal relations The passage from the Cartesian coordinates towards the bipolar coordinates can be done via the following formulas: : tau = frac{1}{2} ln frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2} and : pi - sigma = 2 arctan frac{2ay}{a^2 - x^2 - y^2 + sqrt{(a^2 - x^2 - y^2)^2 + 4 a^2 y^2} }. The coordinates also have the identities: : tanh tau = frac{2 a x}{x^2 + y^2 + a^2} and : tan sigma = frac{2 a y}{x^2 + y^2 - a^2}. which is the limit one would get a x = 0 from the definition in the section above. And all the limits look quite ordinary at x =0.  Scale factors  To obtain the scale factors for bipolar coordinates, we take the differential of the equation for x + iy , which gives : dx + i, dy = frac{-ia}{sin^2bigl(tfrac{1}{2}(sigma + i tau)bigr)}(dsigma +i,dtau). Multiplying this equation with its complex conjugate yields : (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = frac{a^2}{bigl[2sintfrac{1}{2}bigl(sigma + itaubigr) sintfrac{1}{2}bigl(sigma - itaubigr)bigr]^2} bigl((dsigma)^2 + (dtau)^2bigr). Employing the trigonometric identities for products of sines and cosines, we obtain : 2sintfrac{1}{2}bigl(sigma + itaubigr) sintfrac{1}{2}bigl(sigma - itaubigr) = cossigma - coshtau, from which it follows that : (dx)^2 + (dy)^2 = frac{a^2}{(cosh tau - cossigma)^2} bigl((dsigma)^2 + (dtau)^2bigr). Hence the scale factors for σ and τ are equal, and given by : h_sigma = h_tau = frac{a}{cosh tau - cossigma}. Many results now follow in quick succession from the general formulae for orthogonal coordinates. Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals : dA = frac{a^2}{left( cosh tau - cossigma right)^2} , dsigma, dtau, and the Laplacian is given by : abla^2 Phi = frac{1}{a^2} left( cosh tau - cossigma right)^2 left( frac{partial^2 Phi}{partial sigma^2} + frac{partial^2 Phi}{partial tau^2} right). Expressions for abla f, abla cdot mathbf{F}, and abla times mathbf{F} can be expressed obtained by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates. Applications The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables. An example is the electric field surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors with unequal diameters. Polar plotters use bipolar coordinates to describe the drawing paths required to draw a target image. Extension to 3-dimensions Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates. *The bipolar cylindrical coordinates are produced by translating the bipolar coordinates along the z-axis, i.e., the out-of-plane axis. *The bispherical coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the x-axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci. *The toroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the y-axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.

It was formerly known as Macharadze or Makharadze (named in honor of Filipp Makharadze). It is a regional center of tea and hazelnut processing. History Ozurgeti in 1878. Ozurgeti was founded in the late Middle Ages, and is first mentioned by name in 1578 in the New Georgian Chronicles (ახალი ქართლის ცხოვრობა, akhali qartlis tskhovroba).ქართლის ცხოვრება, წიგნი II (Kartuli Tskhovreba, Book II) — Tbilisi, 1959 (in Georgian) It became the centre of Guria soon after, serving as an important centre for trade and the home of the rulers of the Principality of Guria. The later discovery of a hoard of 270 silver coins under the city, the \\"Ozurgeti Treasure,\\" is testament to this. On December 14, 1846 Ozurgeti was designated as a city.Mr. Zardialishvili, \\"საქ. სსრ ეკონომიკური დარაიონება (The Economic Zoning of the Georgian SSR), p. 46 (Tbilisi, 1970) (in Georgian). At that time there were just over 300 residents, though the population grew as the city gained importance: by 1865 it had grown to over 700. It served as a strategic place for the course of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–78). It was the fourth city in Georgia to have a legal printing press, which began in 1891. On December 26, 1923 a rail line had been established, connecting Ozurgeti with the rest of the country. It was renamed \\"Makharadze\\" on July 9, 1934, in honour of the Georgian Bolshevik Filipp Makharadze. It would revert to its original name on May 15, 1989. Culture Ozurgeti Dramatic Theatre Theater The Ozurgeti Dramatic Theatre overlooks the city's central square. It is named in honor of Alexander Tsutsunava, whose statue stands in an adjoining park. It was founded in 1868, and the first production was a performance by local amateur actors. A new theater building was constructed in 1914. In 1933, another new building was constructed. In 1962, the theater was moved to yet another building, the five-storey Soviet Neoclassical-style structure in which it currently resides. It is one of the largest theaters in Georgia. In 1968, a large centennial celebration was held in the building and the theater was named after Tsutsunava. In 2005, the Ministry of Culture and the Theater Workers’ Union declared the Ozurgeti Dramatic Theater to be the best regional theater in Georgia. History Museum Ozurgeti History Museum The Ozurgeti History Museum was founded in 1936, moved to Gurieli Palace in 1974, and relocated to its current site in 1991. The museum contains over 6,000 artifacts, and it currently includes archaeological, numismatic, ethnographic, heraldic, sphragistic, and historical exhibits, and perhaps most prominently displayed among them is a sword that allegedly belonged to Napoleon Bonaparte. It also houses a collection of old printed books. Sport Ozurgeti has rugby and football clubs. There are two stadia in the city: Friendship Stadium belongs to the municipality and is used by the football club; Zvani Stadium is used by the rugby club. In 2007, a “sport palace,” containing a space that can be converted into a miniature football stadium, a volleyball court, a basketball court, and a wrestling ring, was built. The city operates a municipal sports school including a tae kwon do club, a basketball club, a tennis club, a boxing club, a track club, a judo club, a weightlifting club, a freestyle wrestling club, and a hockey club. Education The first school in the city was established on February 21, 1850. At various times, Simon Gugunava, Niko Mari, and Ekvtime Takaishvili attended the school. On July 1, 1874 the school came under municipal administration. Interest in education and literacy was increasing at this time. Due to widespread political activism among the student population, the school was briefly closed on the order of the Transcaucasia Governorate near the end of the 19th Century. In the beginning of the 20th century, Constantine Leselidze and Porfiry Chanchibadze also attended the school. In 1918, the city school introduced elementary-level education. In 1922, due to increasing attendance, a new school, thereafter called School #2, was opened. Both schools offered education to the 7th grade. There are now five public schools, two parochial schools, nine kindergartens, and one art school in Ozurgeti. , the total number of students enrolled in primary and secondary schools was roughly 2,850, and there were 236 teachers. There is also a vocational college with some 500 students and 30 instructors. Public life Ozurgeti city center There are 15 NGOs in Ozurgeti, most of which focus on the city’s youth, civil society, democracy, women’s rights, and agronomy. There is a branch of the Georgian Young Lawyers’ Association in the city. The television station Guria TV, which broadcasts to the entire region, is also based in the city. The city has three newspapers, some of which serve the entire region. Several other cultural organizations exist in the city: A city library, a children’s theater, and a modern art gallery. Notable structures An ancient Byzantine-era bathhouse was recently discovered in central Ozurgeti and the ruins are under excavation. It is a two storey- structure. The lower, subterranean floor was the fire chamber which heated an upper floor that containing public baths. Gurieli Palace, constructed in 1873, is also near the city center. It currently serves as the seat of the Shemokmedi Orthodox Bishopric. Demographics According to the 2014 Census, the city had a population of 14,785. In 2010, the population was estimated to be 20,636. The city is 94% ethnic Georgian, 4% Armenian, and 1.5% Russian. According to official statistics, 10% of the population lives below the poverty line and the unemployment rate is 15%. Geography Ozurgeti is above sea level. Most of the town is located between the Bzhuzhi and Natanebi rivers. The Natanebi is a subterranean river in Ozurgeti, with a good deal of the city built on top of it, while the Bzhuzhi flows above ground. The city is bounded by hills in the north and south. Ozurgeti sits on a slope that was leveled into three broad terraces: The market district, containing bazaars and small shops, as well as a plaza overlooked by a statue of a mermaid, is on the lowermost level. Most of the city’s public buildings—including municipal buildings, the cinema, the theater, and museums—as well as parks, are on the middle terrace. The highest level contains mostly private housing. Climate The city has a humid subtropical climate, and experiences significant rainfall throughout the year. January is the coldest month and August is the hottest. Snow is rare and occurs primarily in January, February, and early March.

Juggling, p.14. Siddall, Jeremy; illustrations. Courage. . The four-ball pattern is exactly the same as the three-ball pattern, except that the balls are thrown higher or faster. This is unlike a cascade pattern for odd numbers of props, which must be juggled as a fountain if another prop is added. The easiest shower is the two-ball shower which many people often define as juggling. Asked to demonstrate juggling with two objects the average person is likely to throw one in the air, pass across the other, and catch the first in the other hand. Performed continuously, this is a two-ball shower. However this two object shower is not defined as toss juggling which is most usually defined as the manipulation of more objects than the number of hands doing the manipulation. A three-ball shower is significantly more difficult for a beginner than a three-ball cascade, due to the height, speed, and asymmetry of the two throws. However, once mastered it is easy to perform for long periods, or to combine with other tricks. \\"The shower is more complicated than the cascade, but some people find that the movement comes naturally to them.\\" References Juggling patterns and tricks Period 2 juggling patterns ","title":"Shower (juggling)"},{"id":"1197441","text":"Nathan Smith may refer to: Sports *Nathan Smith (Irish cricketer) (born 1995), Irish cricketer *Nathan Smith (New Zealand cricketer) (born 1998), New Zealand cricketer *Nathan Smith (rugby league, born 1983), Australian rugby league player for Penrith Panthers *Nathan Smith (rugby league, born 1988), Australian rugby league footballer for the Parramatta Eels *Nathan Smith (footballer, born 1987), English-born Jamaican football player *Nathan Smith (soccer, born 1994), American soccer player *Nathan Smith (footballer, born 1996), English football player *Nathan Smith (golfer) (born 1978), American amateur golfer *Nate Smith (golfer) (born 1983), American professional golfer on the Nationwide Tour *Nathan Smith (ice hockey) (born 1982), NHL player *Nathan Smith (biathlete) (born 1985), Canadian biathlete Others *Nathan Smith (senator) (1770–1835), U.S. Senator *Nathan Lloyd Smith (1975–2002), Canadian soldier, killed in Afghanistan *Nathan Smith (physician) (1762–1829), founder of several U.S. medical schools *Nathan Ryno Smith (1797–1877), U.S. physician, professor at University of Maryland See also *Nathaniel Smith (disambiguation) *Nate Smith (disambiguation) ","title":"Nathan Smith"},{"id":"1197442","text":"This is a list researchers in the physics field of loop quantum gravity who have Wikipedia articles. * Abhay Ashtekar, Pennsylvania State University, United States * John Baez, University of California, Riverside, United States * Aurélien Barrau, Université Grenoble Alpes, Grenoble, France * John W.

Life and career  Taylor was born in Portland, Oregon and studied engineering at the University of Washington. After graduation, he was accepted into the United States Navy as a pilot during World War II, and spent much of the war working on the Navy's Gorgon missile program, for which he was awarded the Legion of Merit medal. Shortly after the war, he designed his first flying car, the Aerocar, and founded Aerocar International in Longview, Washington, to develop, manufacture and market the aircraft. To date, it remains the closest that any such design came to actual mass production, but eventually only six were built. Although Taylor continued to push for the viability of the flying car throughout the rest of his life, he also designed a number of only slightly more conventional designs for the homebuilt aircraft market, including the Taylor Coot amphibian and the Aerocar IMP family of light sport planes (which consists of the Mini, Micro and Ultra IMP). In a 1979 article about the future of flight past the year 2000, Taylor somewhat inaccurately predicted widespread use of flying autos and pusher configurations, however he did accurately predict the mainstream use of carbon materials for lightweight spars and wing ribs. He also gave frequent help and advice to the Klapmeier brothers throughout the 1980s on their first design, the pusher-propeller homebuilt Cirrus VK-30.  Awards and honors  He was awarded the Edward Longstreth Medal from the Franklin Institute in 1960. In 1975, he received the Experimental Aircraft Association (EAA) Dr. August Raspet Memorial Award for \\"significant advancements in the field of light aircraft design\\".

The sisters were better known as members of the girl group All Saints. Biography Natalie and Nicole Appleton were born in 1973 and 1974 respectively to their British mother Mary and their Canadian Jewish father, Ken. They also have two elder sisters, Lori and Lee. Their parents divorced in the late 1970s, and so the sisters switched frequently between their mother's native United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. Both attended Ellenville High School in upstate New York. They stayed in Britain eventually, and became students at the Sylvia Young Theatre School in North London, which was to tutor their fellow All Saints colleague and Nic's schoolmate, Melanie Blatt as well as Denise van Outen, Emma Bunton, Letitia Dean and Samantha Janus. The sisters were back in the UK in 1994, and, together with Shaznay Lewis, joined with former schoolmate Melanie Blatt to form All Saints. In 2000, both sisters appeared in the poorly received film Honest, directed by ex-Eurythmics member Dave Stewart. In 2001, All Saints disbanded. Natalie and Nicole formed the band Appleton, and in September 2002, issued their first Appleton single \\"Fantasy\\", written with Andy Hayman and Gareth Young, which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. Their autobiography, Together, came out in October 2002. David Slade has announced he will direct the autobiographical book into a film. In 2003, they had two more hits with \\"Don't Worry\\" and \\"Everything Eventually\\" and the album, Everything's Eventual which went gold in the UK after just two months. They decided to sign a deal with Concept Music in late 2004 because of differences with their previous label, Polydor.

It has a population of 7,145 (Census 2011). History =Prehistory= Although the current village of Sawston has only existed as anything more than a hamlet for 400 to 600 years, there is evidence for a settlement in the vicinity dating back to the early Bronze Age almost 5000 years ago. The northern high-ground in Sawston would have been the only vantage point from which to view the ancient Hill figures discovered in the Wandlebury section of the Wheatsheaf Duford =Domesday Book= In the Domesday Book, Sawston is recorded as being in the hundred of Whittlesford and the county of Cambridgeshire. It is recorded to have 38 households, placing it in the top 20% of settlements in terms of population. It has 3 listed owners: Count Robert of Mortain, Geoffrey de Mandeville and Eudo the Steward. One of the overlords in 1066 was reportedly Edward the Confessor. =Sawston Hall= Sawston HallSawston Hall is a Grade I listed Tudor manor house dating from the 16th century. The hall boasts many fine features, such as the magnificent Great Hall complete with Elizabethan panelling and a large Tudor fireplace with fireback dated 1571. The hall also has its own private chapel which is also panelled and has an 18th-century decorated plaster ceiling and wonderful stained glass windows. On the first floor the Long gallery and the bedroom where Queen Mary I was rumoured to have slept are also key features with original wide oak floorboards and exposed Brick wall The hall is surrounded by almost of grounds which includes a Site of Special Scientific Interest protected by Natural England due to the presence of Cambridge Milk Parsley, a rare English native plant. The ground also include a number of naturally fed springs, woodland walks, a half moat and a number of smaller landscaped gardens. The Sawston estate was held by the Huddleston family from 1517 until the 1980s. The Hall was thrust into the history books in 1553 when Mary Tudor (soon to be Mary I of England), fleeing imprisonment by the Duke of Northumberland, spent the night at Sawston Hall. Northumberland's soldiers followed Mary to Sawston forcing her to flee the next morning disguised as a dairymaid. As she fled, the soldiers put flame to the medieval manor destroying a large portion of the hall. The Hall was re-built by Sir John and Edmund Huddleston between 1557–1584 with the help of a licence granted by Queen Mary to use stone from Cambridge Castle. During the re-building Mary died and was succeeded by Elizabeth I. This resulted in the inclusion of a number of priest holes in the building, allowing the Huddleston family to continue their practice of the Catholic faith. The priest's hole at the top of the spiral staircase at Sawston Hall is noted as one of the finest examples in the country. During the Second World War Sawston Hall, still under the ownership of the Huddlestons, was the headquarters of the 66th Fighter Wing, part of the USAAF Eighth Air Force. An air raid shelter still remains in the grounds, and on the top floor war-time graffiti still adorns the walls. In 1982 the Huddleston family sold the hall which became a language school until the present owner purchased the property in 2010. Sawston Hall sits adjacent to the, earlier, Norman styled St Mary's church. Sawston Hall was the location used for the 1971 Michael Winner film \\"The Nightcomers\\". It was featured extensively including many scenes providing interior shots of the house throughout. =Sawston Cross= Until 1815 the village of Sawston had an ancient cross, possibly erected by the Knights Templar. The cross had many purposes, even as a location where public officers administered justice during the 13th century. It survived the rage of the Puritans in the civil wars, but was torn down between the summer of 1815 and autumn of 1816, along with the surrounding amphitheatre-like enclosure, the stocks and ancient sycamore tree, and sold by greedy village elders to make way for redevelopment. William Hone's Table-book includes a contributor's description when he stumbled across the villagers discussing whether or not to tear down the cross.Sawston Cross, in: The Every-day Book and Table Book; or, Everlasting Calendar of Popular Amusements, Sports, Pastimes, Ceremonies, Manners, Customs, and Events, Each of the Three Hundred and Sixty-Five Days, in Past and Present Times; Forming a Complete History of the Year, Months, and Seasons, and a Perpetual Key to the Almanac, Including Accounts of the Weather, Rules for Health and Conduct, Remarkable and Important Anecdotes, Facts, and Notices, in Chronology, Antiquities, Topography, Biography, Natural History, Art, Science, and General Literature; Derived from the Most Authentic Sources, and Valuable Original Communication, with Poetical Elucidations, for Daily Use and Diversion., ed. William Hone, (London: 1827) p 81-82. Retrieved on 3 July 2008. A poem comparing Sawstonites to the Jews, which would today appear to be highly controversial and antisemitic, was subsequently penned, and published in the 1827 journal: > The Jews of old, as we've been told—— > And Scriptures pure disclose—— > With harden'd hearts drew lots for parts > Of our Salvator's clothes. > > The modern Jews ——the Sawstonites—— > As harden'd as the Israelites—— > In ignorance still more gross—— > Thinking they could no longer thrive > By Christian means, did means contrive—— > Draw lots, and sold the cross! =Recent history= Sawston has seen substantial development since the end of the Second World War and, more recently, a number of large housing estates have been constructed, most notably to the north-west and south of the village. This development has led to the area of Sawston spreading into the small nearby village of Pampisford. Sawston has been earmarked for development to meet Cambridgeshire's ever-growing housing needs, including in the 2013 Local Plan from South Cambridgeshire District Council currently under review by the Planning Inspectorate.https://www.scambs.gov.uk/localplan Work on a new Community Hub, which will be a flexible meeting place and re-home the Library (in temporary buildings following the 2012 fire at the Walnut Gallery, SVC), was due to commence during 2016 but as of April 2018 has still not started. It will be located adjacent to the Marven Centre on New Road.http://www.sawston.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Full-minutes- March-2016.pdf As well as housing developments on either side of the Babraham Road, approval has been given for the building of a 3,000 capacity football stadium to house Cambridge City F.C.https://www.scambs.gov.uk/sawston%20football%20stadium Geology The underground structure of Sawston is the same as that of the region – permeable chalk and impermeable clay. The low-lying nature of the village is indicative of a former flood plain which still tends towards the moist, although comparatively recent dredging of the local ditches and rivers has alleviated the general flooding problem. The chalky nature of the local geology provides for a clean, if hard, water supply as it is drawn from artesian wells in the area. The chalk and clay in the area contains a large quantity of flint that often finds its way into older local construction. There is a hill, Huckeridge Hill, to the north west of the village. At 32 m it is a good viewpoint for Little Trees Hill (itself the highest point of Magog Down in the Gog Magog Hills) across the valley of the Granta. Industry For the last couple of hundred years, the two principal industries in Sawston's environs have been Paper & Printing and Leather. The original paper mill in Sawston is on the current Spicers site, named after the family who owned the mill in the last century. This complex is located at the north-west corner of the parish. There are two sites in Sawston which support or have formerly supported Tanning facilities. The site south of the village centre and backing onto the grounds of the Sawston manor house – Sawston Hall – is the Hutchins and Harding site. The other site is on the southern border of the village, crossing over into neighbouring Pampisford, the Eastern Counties Leather site which has now been mostly converted into a general industrial estate. These industries were introduced into Sawston to take advantage of the clean water supply. Examination reveals that both sites are located on bore holes or streams. A further large industrial estate exists in the north of the village adjacent to Babraham Road. Sawston today =Local government= Sawston Parish Council has a nominal 19 seats, so at the May 2016 elections 15 Councillors were elected unapposed, for a period of two years.http://scambs.moderngov.co.uk/mgElectionAreaResults.aspx?XXR=0&ID;=813&RPID;=1002363673 The Council moved to a new office building on Link Road in 2011. This incorporates an office for the village History Society. Sawston Parish Council is active in many aspects of village life, including village facilities (recreation grounds, community buildings etc.) and organising events (such as annual bonfire nights).Sawston Parish Council – About Us Sawston is a two- seat Ward within the South Cambridgeshire District Council local government area.

As of 2005 it has 1,085 pupils in 5-year groups and approximately 50 teaching staff. The Principal, as of 2018, is Jonathan Russell. In addition to this the village also has The Bellbird Primary School (previously the John Falkner Infant and the John Paxton Junior Schools), Icknield Primary School, and a number of nursery and preschool groups. Social events in the village take place in the village's three churches, community hall or four pubs, or on the Sawston Village College site, which incorporates a youth centre (including theatre/cinema), an Assembly Hall which is also fitted out as a show venue and a new Arts Centre. The Village College site also has a new, large sports centre which was built in 2004 with two large halls, a swimming pool, and a gym. On 6 September 2012, just a couple of days into the new term, the school was devastated by a blaze that gutted the wing of the school containing the Walnut Gallery (a community meeting room) and the Public Library. There were no casualties caused by what was believed to be an accident caused by the use of a blowtorch on window frames that were being repainted as part of ongoing refurbishment of the Walnut Gallery. The wing has been rebuilt to include the Walnut Gallery and a new school reception in the rooms which formerly hosted the local library. The library has since been housed in a temporary structure on the far side of the school grounds pending the building of the Community Hub (see above). =Churches= The village has four churches, Sawston Free Church, Sawston Free Church the parish church for the village of Sawston, Saint Mary's ChurchSt Mary's Church (There are some pictures and a description at the Cambridgeshire Churches websiteThis church's page at the Cambridgeshire Churches website), Christ Church South CambsChrist Church South Cambs also Church of England,A Church Near You: CCSC and Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church,Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church now under joint Parish leadership with Our Lady and the English Martyrs, Cambridge. =Youth and charity= Due to its size the village hosts a large number of youth groups and clubs, as well as some organised by the village college.

The community magazine Sawston Scene was started by a group of volunteers in 1970, with the first issue printed in April of that year. It has been published every two months ever since, celebrating its fortieth anniversary in April–May 2010. The magazine includes reports from county, district and parish councils as well as local groups and societies, a diary of local events, and a directory of local information.Sawston Scene website The Sawston Facebook page has gone from strength to strength to rekindle community spirit with its 2.1k (07/11/16) strong membership. Many village issues are aired and resolved including the Grass Verge fiasco of 2016, the Cows escaping in 2015 and the impending growth of the village with the arrival of the Cambridge City F.C. Super-dome. All in all like the Sawston Scene set a trend in 1970, so has the Sawston Facebook page, even hitting the news when it helped foil the card cloning scam originating in the USA hitting Cambridge Building Societies nationwide (22/03/16). =Sport= The village has a variety of sports clubs. Sawston Rovers Football Club, who play their home fixtures at Mill Lane, compete in Kershaw Senior B with their reserve team in Mead Plant and Grab Division 4A.

This usage is a holdover from feudalism, which still forms the basis of property law in many common law jurisdictions, in which the monarch alone owned the allodial title to all the land within his kingdom. Under feudalism, land itself was never privately \\"owned\\" but rather was \\"held\\" by a tenant (from Latin teneo \\"to hold\\") as a fee, being merely a legal right over land known in modern law as an estate in land. This was held from a superior overlord, ( a mesne lord), or from the crown itself in which case the holder was termed a tenant-in-chief, upon some manner of service under one of a variety of feudal land tenures. The thing held is called a tenement, the holder is called a tenant, the manner of his holding is called a tenure, and the superior is called the landlord, or lord of the fee. These forms are still preserved in law, even though feudalism itself is extinct, because all real estate law has developed from them over centuries. Feudal land tenure existed in many varieties. The sole surviving form in the United States is that species of freehold known as free socage. Here the service to be performed is known and fixed, and not of a base or servile nature; the \\"lord of the fee\\" is the State itself, and the service due to this \\"lord\\" is payment of the taxes upon the real estate. The major consequences, in the modern world, of this feudal approach, as distinguished from ownership, are, first, the forfeiture of the tenement upon failure to perform the service (that is, non-payment of taxes), and second, the doctrine of eminent domain, whereby the \\"lord of the fee\\" might take back the estate, provided he make just compensation. Also existing in a vestigial form is the concept of escheat, under which an estate of a holder without heirs returns to the ownership of the state. An interesting side effect of this is that government entities do not pay real estate taxes to other government entities since government entities own the land rather than hold the land. Localities that depend on real estate taxes to provide services are often put at a disadvantage when the state or federal government acquires a piece of land. Sometimes, to mollify local public opinion, the state or federal government may volunteer to make payments in lieu of taxes (PILOT or PILT programs) to local governments.

Marston Trussell was first recorded as 'Mersitone', meaning marsh settlement. The parish includes Thorpe Lubenham. At the time of the 2001 census, its population was 163 people,Office for National Statistics: Marston Trussell CP: Parish headcounts. Retrieved 14 November 2009 reducing slightly to 157 at the 2011 census but including Lubenham. The manor house in the village, Marston Trussell Hall, dates from circa 1606 and is an Elizabethan-style mansion with fine wood panelling interiors in the drawing room; in later years the existing house was dwarfed by a Victorian extension which no longer exists. A priesthole was discovered in the mid-1950s. The grounds of the hall have gardens and a newly added sunken Italian garden. Also of note are the 10 Wellingtonia trees. Richard Trussell was lord of the manor in 1233. The Trussells of Marston died out in the 14th century and the hall was eventually re-established as the seat of the Barwell-Ewins Bennett family. There is a hatchment in the parish church of Henry Barwell who died in 1763. The River Welland was in flood at the time of the Battle of Naseby in 1645 which led to a massacre of retreating Royalists who were trapped between the river and the church; this area is known locally as Slaughterford field. The late 17th century wrought-iron carriage gates of Marston Trussell Hall were originally made for the house of Erasmus Norwich at Brampton Ash. They were moved to the entrance of the hall in the mid-1700s. Some of the original wrought-iron railings are still used to partition fields at the hall. However, during the First World War, like many country houses, a lot of the wrought- iron was removed and used in the war effort for the manufacture of arms and munitions. There are around 60 houses, St Nicholas Church and a village hall. The village has a lake, two minutes walk to the west, which primarily stocks roach, perch and pike. Alongside the lake resides the cricket pitch. The cricket team was started in the mid-1980s, predominantly playing friendlies on a Sunday. The team at one point could field five sets of brothers, Daniel (now at Wokingham Cricket Club) and Oliver Reddyhough, David and John Reddyhough, Simon and Sam Smith (now Gumley Cricket Club), Charles and Robert Mathew and Shaun and Ashley Burbery. The village holds an annual Beer Festival, over a weekend in mid-June. The Victorian village hall becomes The Rising Sun (the old village pub, The Sun Inn, closed some time ago), complete with pub sign, hand pumps and a variety of real ales, and ciders, including some from the local Welland Valley vineyard. The village is now (2017) enabled for high speed ultrafast (over 100Mbit/s) broadband via Zippynet.

Computers were manufactured at the Artronix facility in suburban St. Louis, Missouri. The instruction set architecture was adapted from the LINC, the only significant change was to expand addressable memory to 4K, which required addition of an origin register. It was an accumulator machine with 12-bit addresses to manipulate 12-bit data. Later versions included \\"origin registers\\" that were used to extend the addressability of memory. Arithmetic was one's complement. For mass storage it had a LINCtape dual unit. It also used a Tektronix screen with tube memory and an ADC/DAC to capture and display images. There was an optional plotter to draw the results. To speed up the calculations it had a separate floating point unit that interfaced like any other peripheral. It ran an operating system LAP6-PC with support for assembly language and Fortran programming and usually came with end user software for Radiation Treatment Planning (RTP), for use by a radiation therapist or radiation oncologist, and Hospital Patient Records. Software for implant dosimetry was available for the PC12. With extended hardware it became a multiuser system running MUMPS. Latter additions included an 8\\" floppy disk and hard disk of larger capacity. The PC12 initially controlled the Artronix brain scanner (computed axial tomography), but this was for prototyping. The PC12 was also the core of an ultrasound system and a gamma camera system.

In addition to his many paintings, he wrote a number of books concerning art. He taught for many years in the city of Milan. Biography Carrà was born in Quargnento, near Alessandria (Piedmont). At the age of 12 he left home in order to work as a mural decorator. In 1899–1900, Carrà was in Paris decorating pavilions at the Exposition Universelle, where he became acquainted with contemporary French art. He then spent a few months in London in contact with exiled Italian anarchists, and returned to Milan in 1901. In 1906, he enrolled at Brera Academy (Accademia di Brera) in the city, and studied under Cesare Tallone. In 1910 he signed, along with Umberto Boccioni, Luigi Russolo and Giacomo Balla the Manifesto of Futurist Painters, and began a phase of painting that became his most popular and influential. Carlo Carrà, 1912, Woman on the Balcony, (Simultaneità, La donna al balcone), Collezione R. Jucker, Milan, Italy Carrà's Futurist phase ended around the time World War I began. His work, while still using some Futurist concepts, began to deal more clearly with form and stillness, rather than motion and feeling. Inspired by Trecento painting, children's art, and the work of Henri Rousseau, Carrà soon began creating still lifes in a simplified style that emphasized the reality of ordinary objects.Cowling and Mundy pp. 52–53. In 1917 he met Giorgio de Chirico in Ferrara, and worked with him there for several weeks. Influenced by de Chirico, Carrà began including mannequin imagery in his paintings.Cowling and Mundy p. 52. The two artists were the innovators of a style they called \\"metaphysical painting\\". By 1919, Carrà's metaphysical phase was giving way to an archaicism inspired by the works of Giotto, whom he admired as \\"the artist whose forms are closest to our manner of conceiving the construction of bodies in space.\\"Cowling and Mundy p. 56. Carrà's painting The Daughters of Lot (1919) exemplifies the new direction of his work. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, he concentrated mainly on landscape painting and developed a more atmospheric style.Cowling and Mundy p. 57. An example from this period is his 1928 Morning by the Sea. He is best known for his 1911 Futurist work, The Funeral of the Anarchist Galli. Carrà was indeed an anarchist as a young man but, along with many other Futurists, later held more reactionary political views, becoming ultranationalist and irredentist before and during the war. He supported fascism after 1918.

The phrase may sometimes be used of a private order by an employer or other institution. Uses of gag orders include keeping trade secrets of a company, protecting the integrity of ongoing police or military operations, and protecting the privacy of victims or minors. Conversely, as their downside, they may be abused as a useful tool for those of financial means to intimidate witnesses and prevent release of information, using the legal system rather than other methods of intimidation. Strategic lawsuit against public participation (SLAPP) orders may potentially be abused in this way. Gag orders are sometimes used in an attempt to assure a fair trial by preventing prejudicial pre-trial publicity, although their use for this purpose is controversial since they are a potentially unconstitutional prior restraint that can lead to the press's using less reliable sources such as off-the- record statements and second- or third-hand accounts. In a similar manner, a \\"gag law\\" may limit freedom of the press, by instituting censorship or restricting access to information. Examples =Australia= In the summer of 2014, WikiLeaks revealed the existence of an Australia-wide gagging order, issued 19 June by the Supreme Court of Victoria, to block reporting of bribery allegations involving several international political leaders in the region. In December 2018, International news sources have reported that Cardinal George Pell's conviction on child-molestation charges is subject to a gag order issued by Victoria, Australia court Judge Peter Kidd, suppressing coverage of the conviction by Australian media companies. In early February 2019, Victoria's DPP, Kerri Judd QC, wrote to around 50 Australian news publishers, editors, broadcasters, reporters and subeditors, accusing them of breaking the gag order. Peter Kidd told a closed court that some of the breaches were serious and editors faced jail. =India= After the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which live streaming of the event was broadcast, the Indian government proposed a draft law that would gag media outlets broadcasting live pictures during a terrorist event or war, to ensure the safety of any hostages and to protect security operations from hindrance. This has been opposed by Indian media who argue that they have adopted 'self-regulation' during such events and refrain from doing so anyway. It is uncertain if the draft law will be passed. In 2017 Justice Karnan was a retiring high court judge of Kolkata, he was accused of disrespecting supreme court of India. Hence supreme court of India ordered the arrest of Justice Karnan and also a GAG order has been released and his press release was not published.Needs verification and sources. =Israel= In late 2009, Israel issued a gag order against the Israeli media reporting on facts surrounding the Anat Kamm–Uri Blau affair. The gag order was ultimately subject to widespread criticism and publicity as the details of the case were reported overseas. The scandal centered around leaked documents from the Israeli Defense Force which suggested the military had engaged in extrajudicial killings. A gag order concerning the Prisoner X affair prevented Israeli coverage of the topic for more than two years. After numerous foreign media outlets revealed the prisoner's identity and other key facts in February 2013, a court partially lifted the gag order, allowing Israeli media to quote foreign press reports but offer no original reporting. On 13 November 2013 a gag order concerning a famous Israeli singer suspected of sex with girls below the age of consent was issued. While the traditional media did not advertise the name of the singer, social media platforms users like Facebook published the singer name and incriminating photos. On 20 November Eyal Golan released a press statement announcing he was the suspected singer. In August 2017, Israeli court issued a month-old gag order on a state witness deal regarding the ongoing criminal investigations of the Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. =Malaysia= There was speculation that a gag order may be imposed by the MCA on their press statements before they are released to the public to \\"ensure maximum effectiveness\\". Such releases would have to be approved by the president.Order To Endorse Press Statements To Maximise Effectiveness, Says Tee Keat, Bernama, 8 January 2009. These claims in the media were later denied.Tee Keat: No gag order on MCA bureau chiefs, The Sun Daily, 8 January 2009. =Europe= United Kingdom A gag order, or anonymity order, is sometimes issued by courts in the United Kingdom to protect privacy, prevent harm to suspects, prisoners, witnesses, victims, or to protect national security. In the Allan Chappelow murder case, the trial was held mostly in camera and media were prevented from speculating on the case. The order was imposed after a \\"compelling case\\" made by prosecutors, despite overwhelming media opposition brought by a legal challenge to the ruling. This criminal case has been thought to be the first in which a gagging order was imposed. According to WikiLeaks, \\"the Guardian [has] been served with 10 secret gag orders —so-called 'super-injunctions'— [between January and September 2009]. In 2008, the paper was served with six. In 2007, five.\\" In 2011, gagging orders that applied to themselves, or \\"super-injunctions\\" as they were called, were being referred to almost daily in the United Kingdom after a number of high-profile public figures, including celebrities and politicians, censored the British media from revealing information about their personal lives, such as affairs and dealings with prostitutes. Gag orders protecting the privacy of convicted child murderers such as Mary Bell, Jon Venables and David McGreavy, in order to protect them from revenge attacks, have also been controversial because of public concerns about the inability to avoid such persons and protect victims' families and other children from being harmed by them. The Netherlands In The Netherlands, ethologist Gerrit van Putten was given two separate gag orders by the Minister of Agriculture to protect intensive farming. The first gag order was issued after Van Putten had published a report on tail biting in pigs in 1972, and had advocated that the pig's tail is a thermometer of animal welfare, which was discarded when the \\"temperature\\" became too high, i.e. the tails were docked rather than that housing conditions were improved. The second gag order was issued in 1989 by Minister Braks, who did not want to hear about the adverse effects of confined housing of pigs. In 2015, a Dutch court issued a gag order on writer Edwin Giltay, banning his non-fiction thriller The Cover-up General and prohibiting him to promote it. The suppression order denied Edwin Giltay to disclose the contents of the book, which delineates an espionage scandal within Dutch military intelligence that he witnessed first-hand, about obscuring evidence of war crimes in Srebrenica. In 2016, the Court of Appeal in The Hague revoked the gag order and the book ban. =United States= A national security letter (), an administrative subpoena used by the FBI, has an attached gag order which restricts the recipient from ever saying anything about being served with one. The government has issued hundreds of thousands of such NSLs accompanied with gag orders. The gag orders have been upheld in court. Suspicious activity reports (; the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 / Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act, , § 1517(b), ) require that \\"If a financial institution or any director, officer, employee, or agent of any financial institution [...] reports a suspicious transaction to a government agency—neither the financial institution, director, officer, employee, or agent of such institution (whether or not any such person is still employed by the institution) [...] may notify any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported; and no current or former officer or employee of or contractor for the Federal Government or of or for any State, local, tribal, or territorial government within the United States, who has any knowledge that such report was made may disclose to any person involved in the transaction that the transaction has been reported\\". (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 / Stored Communications Act) also provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a order to refrain from disclosing the existence of the order or the investigation.In Re: Application of the United States of America for an Order Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(d) of 25 January 2013, p. 4, from the Wikileaks-related Twitter subpoenas (the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986) also provides for gag orders which direct the recipient of a pen register or trap and trace device order not to disclose the existence of the pen/trap or the investigation.In Re: Sealing and Non-disclosure of Pen/Trap/2703(d) Orders of 30 May 2008, p. 5 In the United States, a court can order parties to a case not to comment on it but has no authority to stop unrelated reporters from reporting on a case. Thus, information concerning a case is often leaked to the media, and the media often chooses to publicly report this leaked information after receiving it. Most statutes which restrict what may be reported have generally been found unconstitutional and void. However, the gag provisions of the WIPO Copyright and Performances and Phonograms Treaties Implementation Act have been upheld. The trials of Guantanamo Bay suspects have also been subjected to a gag order, which has hindered public scrutiny. Likewise, as part of a plea bargain John Walker Lindh consented to a gag order to not talk to the press or others. Also, Judge Howard Shore from San Diego put a gag order on activist Jeff Olson. Gag orders can be part of a settlement agreement between two parties. In the state of Pennsylvania in 2011, a lifetime gag order on the discussion of fracking was agreed to by a family as part of their agreement with the oil and gas drilling company Range Resources. An attorney for Range Resources claimed in court that the gag order covered not only the adults in the family, but also the children, then aged seven and ten years old, and that the company intended to enforce it. Some U.S. states, the first of which was Florida, have enacted so-called \\"physician gag laws\\" limiting doctors' ability to talk to their patients about their gun ownership. California In 2017, California enacted the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act, adjusting California Penal Code 1546, including Section 1546.2 (b) (1), a provision which allows that in certain cases, a court can issue \\"an order delaying notification and prohibiting any party providing information from notifying any other party\\" that an electronic search warrant has been requested by a government entity. Puerto Rico On May 21, 1948, a bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and Nationalist movements on the archipelago, which was a colony of the United States at the time. The Senate, controlled by the Partido Popular Democrático (PPD), approved the bill that day.\\"La obra jurídica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintrón This bill, which resembled the anti-communist Smith Act passed in the United States in 1940, became known as the Ley de la Mordaza (Gag Law, technically \\"Law 53 of 1948\\") when the U.S.-appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jesús T. Piñero, signed it into law on June 10, 1948. Under this new law it became a crime to print, publish, sell, or exhibit any material intended to paralyze or destroy the insular government; or to organize any society, group or assembly of people with a similar destructive intent. It made it illegal to sing a patriotic song, and reinforced the 1898 law that had made it illegal to display the Flag of Puerto Rico, with anyone found guilty of disobeying the law in any way being subject to a sentence of up to ten years imprisonment, a fine of up to US$10,000 (), or both. According to Leopoldo Figueroa, the lone non-PPD member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, Law 53 was repressive and was in violation of the First Amendment of the US Constitution which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.La Gobernación de Jesús T.

The film is based on Raymond Chandler's 1940 novel Farewell, My Lovely. It was the first film to feature Chandler's primary character, the hard-boiled private detective Philip Marlowe.Mller, Frank and Feaster, Felicia (ndg) \\"Why 'Murder, My Sweet' Is Essential\\" (article) TCM.com Murder, My Sweet is, along with Double Indemnity, one of the first films noir, and a key influence in the development of the genre. Plot Temporarily blinded with his eyes bandaged, private detective Philip Marlowe (Dick Powell) is interrogated by police lieutenant Randall (Don Douglas) about two murders. Marlowe tells how he was hired by Moose Malloy (Mike Mazurki) to locate Velma Valento, a former girlfriend Moose had lost track of while he was serving eight years in prison. They go to \\"Florian's\\", the nightclub where Velma last worked as a singer, but the owner died years earlier, and no one remembers her. Marlowe tracks down Jessie Florian (Esther Howard), the alcoholic widow of the nightclub's former owner, who claims not to know what's become of Velma. However, Marlowe finds a photo of Velma that Jessie hid from him, and she drunkenly blurts out that Velma is dead. Later, from outside, Marlowe observes a clearly disturbed (and suddenly no longer inebriated) Jessie make a phone call. The next morning, Lindsay Marriott (Douglas Walton) turns up at Marlowe's office, offering $100 if Marlowe will act as his bodyguard when he acts as a go-between in a secluded canyon at midnight to pay a ransom for some stolen jewels. In the canyon, Marlowe is knocked unconscious. When Marlowe comes to, he sees a young woman shine a flashlight on his face and then run away. The money is gone, and Marriott has been viciously killed by an amateur, with repeated blows from a blackjack. When Marlowe reports the murder, the police ask him if he knows a Jules Amthor, and warn him not to interfere in the case. Posing as a reporter, Ann Grayle (Anne Shirley) tries to pry information out of Marlowe about the murder. She mentions that the jewels were jade, and he sees through her disguise. She introduces him to her weak, elderly and wealthy father, Leuwen Grayle (Miles Mander) and his seductive second wife, Helen (Claire Trevor). Grayle collects rare jade and was attempting to recover a necklace worth $100,000, stolen from Helen while she was out dancing with Marriott. Jules Amthor (Otto Kruger), a psychic healer who treated both Helen and Marriott, shows up just as Marlowe is leaving. Helen retains Marlowe to try to recover the jade, but Ann tries bribing him to keep out of it. Moose Malloy forces Marlowe to go with him to \\"meet a guy\\", who turns out to be Amthor. Marlowe suspects that Amthor and Marriott were in league, setting up Helen to get the jade, but something went wrong with the plot. Amthor has duped Moose into thinking that Marlowe knows where Velma is, or is hiding her, so that Moose will do his dirty work. Amthor has Moose strangle Marlowe, and has Dr. Sonderberg (Ralf Harolde) drug him for three days and hold the detective in his sanatorium, all in an attempt to learn where the jade is - which Marlowe doesn't know. Marlowe escapes and tells Moose how he has been tricked. Marlowe goes to Ann and realizes she was the young woman who shone the light on his face after he was knocked out in the canyon. They find a mutual attraction in each other. When Marlowe learns that the police had asked Ann's father about the family beach house, which Marriott rented, Marlowe and Ann go there, where they find Helen hiding from the police. Ann leaves to tell her father where his missing wife is. Marlowe deduces that she hired him only to set him up for Amthor's interrogations and that Ann was trying to save him from the set-up with her bribe. Helen attempts to entice Marlowe into helping her murder Amthor, who is blackmailing her, by luring him back to the beach house the next night for the necklace. Marlowe seems to go along with her plan, but finds Amthor dead, his neck snapped by a strong pair of hands. Moose is waiting for Marlowe at his office. Marlowe shows Moose the photo of \\"Velma\\" he took from Jessie, and as he suspected, it is a fake intended to throw anyone looking for Velma off the track. Marlowe tells Moose to lie low until the next night when he will take Moose to Velma. At the beach house, Marlowe has Moose wait outside while he meets with Helen - who is actually Velma - to find out what happened to the necklace, but she pulls a gun on him. She faked the robbery and the ransom to kill Marlowe after being tipped off by Jessie Florian that he was looking for Velma. Helen killed Marriott while Marlowe went down into the canyon, and was about to kill Marlowe when Ann came along, worried that her jealous father might be trying to kill Marriott. In the beach house, as Helen is about to shoot Marlowe, a lovesick Grayle shows up with Ann. He takes Marlowe's gun and kills Helen. Moose hears the shot and finds his Velma dead. Grayle admits to shooting Helen, and Moose, enraged, lunges for Grayle, who shoots him. Marlowe attempts to intercede as the gun goes off and is blinded by the flash. Three more shots are fired. His story concluded, the blinded private eye is told that Moose and Grayle shot each other in a struggle for Marlowe's gun. Marlowe is escorted out of the building by Detective Nulty (Paul Phillips), with Ann - who has been in the interrogation room all along - following them and overhearing every word. Marlowe expresses his attraction for Ann to the detective. In the back seat of a taxi cab, the bandaged Marlowe recognizes her perfume, and they kiss. Cast The film's opening scene: Marlow, Det.

Another of Chandler's novels had been purchased as well, but in 1944 no studio had yet to use Chandler's antihero private detective Philip Marlowe, as the protagonist of a film. RKO's studio boss, Charles Koerner, recognized the value of the character and of Chandler's style, and decided to use the rights RKO already owned to make a true adaptation of the novel. He was able to convince RKO's management to make a new version of the book so soon after the previous one by pointing out that the book did not need a great deal of adapting to create a screenplay. For Murder, My Sweet Koerner assembled a creative staff who were ready to make the move up from B-movies, specifically producer Adrian Scott and director Edward Dmytryk; for Scott, the film was his first as producer. Koerner also revitalized the career of Claire Trevor - who was making Westerns in which she had fourth or fifth billing - and intended the film to be a showcase for the actress, who played a femme fatale.Muller, Eddie (January 19. 2019) Intro to the Noir Alley presentation of Murder, My Sweet on Turner Classic Movies At one point, the studio had considered Ann Dvorak for one of the female leads. Both Shirley and Trevor tried to convince the studio that they should both play \\"against type\\", with perennial good girl Shirley cast as the femme fatale Helen, and Trevor cast as the nice girl, Ann, but their pressure did not convince the studio. Koerner was also responsible for Dick Powell's transformation from a crooner to playing hard-boiled characters. Powell had been known in the 1930s and early 1940s for light comedies and musicals, but for ten years he had been trying to break away from that typecasting, which he felt he was too old for; he had wanted to play Fred MacMurray's part in Double Indemnity. Koerner wanted Powell under contract to RKO to do musicals, but Powell would only sign if he was allowed to do other kinds of roles, so he offered Powell the opportunity he wanted. However, producer Scott and director Dmytryk were strongly opposed to casting Powell (as was Chandler) - Dmytryk later wrote \\"The idea of the man who had sung 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' playing a tough private eye was beyond our imaginations.\\" - Powell had to make a screen test, as a result of which Koerner offered the actor a multi-picture contract with the studio. After the success of the film, and considering the quality of Powell's performance, Koerner dropped the idea of casting Powell in musicals, and cast him instead as other tough guy characters and in action films. Powell's performance as Philip Marlowe is much debated by fans of Chandler and film noir; some think it too light and comic; while others consider it the best interpretation of Marlowe on film. Chandler himself - who at first had objected to casting Powell - said he was very fond of it, but after seeing Marlowe played by Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep, changed his allegiance to Bogart.Muller, Eddie (January 19. 2019) Outro to the Noir Alley presentation of Murder, My Sweet on Turner Classic Movies Another actor who had to audition to get the role he played was former pro-wrestler-turned-actor Mike Mazurki. Dmytryk wanted a true actor to play the part, but was convinced by Mazurki in a studio commissary discussion to give him a chance; Powell assisted him in his efforts. The film's screenwriter, John Paxton - a former reporter and publicist whose only previous full-length feature was My Pal Wolf, a girl-and-her-dog film - closely followed Chandler's novel, as well as Chandler's advice: \\"When your plot hits a snag, have somebody come through the door with a gun.\\" Some aspects of Chandler's plot had to be underplayed because of the Production Code, such as Marriott's homosexuality, or the fact that Amthor and Sonderborg were providing drugs to the elites of Los Angeles. Other parts of the novel, such as a plot thread involving a fleet of gambling boats off the L.A. coast, were dropped completely, but not because of the Code: in real life mobster Anthony Cornero ran such a fleet outside the three- mile limit, and hosted many of Hollywood's movers and shakers, and there was concern about drawing unwanted attention to him. Finally, Florian's, the club Moose first brings Marlowe to in his search for Velma, was originally a club with an exclusively African-American clientele located on Central Avenue in the heart of L.A.'s black district. Making the change meant that the scenes in the club, and with Jessie Florian, would not have to be cut when the film was distributed in Southern states. Another change made in the adaptation from the book to the film was in the character of Ann Grayle. She was originally the daughter of an honest cop, but changing her to the step-daughter of Trevor's seductress helped to show the differences between the two types of women. It was producer Scott's idea to shoot the film as an extended flashback, which kept the book's first-person narrative style. Production on Murder, My Sweet took place from May 8 to July 1, 1944. Shooting on the first day was so hectic that Claire Trevor was being sewn into her dress while the first scene was being set up. A makeup person was left off of the call, so Trevor did her makeup herself. During breaks between scenes, Dick Powell would entertain the other actors with imitations of himself as a singer earlier in his film career. Night location shooting took place in the Hollywood Hills. Release and title change The film was first screened on December 18, 1944 in Minneapolis, Minnesota with the title Farewell, My Lovely, and also played in previews in New England with that title. A survey by Audience Research Inc. indicated that viewers thought that the title suggested a Dick Powell musical, so the film's name was changed, delaying its release. It opened in New York City on March 8, 1945 as Murder, My Sweet.Silver, Alain and Elizabeth Ward, eds.

According to film critics Ellen Keneshea and Carl Macek, the picture takes Chandler's novel and transforms it into a \\"film with a dark ambiance unknown at [the] time\\". Dmytryk was able to transcend the tough dialogue and mystery film conventions by creating a \\"cynical vision of society\\". As such, the film enters the world of film noir. When the film was released, Bosley Crowther, the film critic for The New York Times, appreciated the adaptation of Chandler's novel and lauded the acting and writing: > Practically all of the supporting roles are exceptionally well played, > particularly by Mike Mazurki, the former wrestler, as the brutish Moose > Malloy; Otto Kruger as Jules Amthor, quack-psychologist and insidious > blackmailer; Anne Shirley as an innocent among the wolf pack, and Don > Douglas as the police lieutenant.

The staff at Variety magazine also gave the film kudos, writing: > Murder, My Sweet, a taut thriller about a private detective enmeshed with a > gang of blackmailers, is as smart as it is gripping ... Performances are on > a par with the production. Dick Powell is a surprise as the hard-boiled > copper. The portrayal is potent and convincing.

The series was filmed from November to December 2001. It ran for six episodes, averaging 3.4 million viewers and a 15% audience share in its Sunday night timeslot. The low ratings meant it was not recommissioned for a second series, leaving an unresolved cliffhanger. Nicholls had written four episodes of the unmade second series before discovering Rescue Me had been cancelled. As a result, he took a break from screenwriting to concentrate on his debut novel Starter for Ten. A cover version of \\"Rescue Me\\", performed by Oliver Darley, is the series theme tune.

These devices are commonly marketed as being beneficial to allergy sufferers and asthmatics, and at reducing or eliminating second-hand tobacco smoke. The commercially graded air purifiers are manufactured as either small stand-alone units or larger units that can be affixed to an air handler unit (AHU) or to an HVAC unit found in the medical, industrial, and commercial industries. Air purifiers may also be used in industry to remove impurities from air before processing. Pressure swing adsorbers or other adsorption techniques are typically used for this. History In 1830, a patent was awarded to Charles Anthony Deane for a device comprising a copper helmet with an attached flexible collar and garment. A long leather hose attached to the rear of the helmet was to be used to supply air, the original concept being that it would be pumped using a double bellows. A short pipe allowed breathed air to escape. The garment was to be constructed from leather or airtight cloth, secured by straps. In the 1860s, John Stenhouse filed two patents applying the absorbent properties of wood charcoal to air purification (patents 19 July 1860 and 21 May 1867), thereby creating the first practical respirator. A few years later, John Tyndall invented an improvement to the fireman's respirator, a hood that filtered smoke and noxious gas from air (1871, 1874).Ian Taggart History of air-purifying type gas-masks in the 19th-century . John Tyndall (1871), Fireman's Respirator, and In the 1950s, HEPA filters were commercialized as highly efficient air filters, after being put to use in the 1940s in the United States' Manhattan Project to control airborne radioactive contaminants. The first residential HEPA filter was reportedly sold in 1963 by brothers Manfred and Klaus Hammes in Germany, who created the Incen Air Corporation which was the precursor to the IQAir corporation. Use and benefits of purifiers Dust, pollen, pet dander, mold spores, and dust mite feces can act as allergens, triggering allergies in sensitive people. Smoke particles and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can pose a risk to health. Exposure to various components such as VOCs increases the likelihood of experiencing symptoms of sick building syndrome. Joseph Allen, director of the Healthy Buildings program at Harvard's School of Public Health, recommends that school classrooms use an air purifier with a HEPA filter as a way to reduce transmission of COVID-19 virus, saying \\"Portables with a high-efficiency HEPA filter and sized for the appropriate room can capture 99.97 percent of airborne particles.\\" Purifying techniques An air purifier placed under a table There are two types of air purifying technologies, active and passive. Active air purifiers release negatively charged ions into the air, causing pollutants to stick to surfaces, while passive air purification units use air filters to remove pollutants. Passive purifiers are more efficient since all the dust and particulate matter is permanently removed from the air and collected in the filters. Several different processes of varying effectiveness can be used to purify air. As of 2005, the most common methods were high- efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI). = Filtration = Air filter purification traps airborne particles by size exclusion. Air is forced through a filter and particles are physically captured by the filter. Various filters exist notably including: * High-efficiency particulate arrestance (HEPA) filters remove at least 99.97% of 0.3-micrometer particles and are usually more effective at removing larger particles. HEPA purifiers, which filter all the air going into a clean room, must be arranged so that no air bypasses the HEPA filter. In dusty environments, a HEPA filter may follow an easily cleaned conventional filter (prefilter) which removes coarser impurities so that the HEPA filter needs cleaning or replacing less frequently. HEPA filters do not generate ozone or harmful byproducts in the course of operation. * Filter HVAC at MERV 14 or above are rated to remove airborne particles of 0.3 micrometers or larger. A high-efficiency MERV 14 filter has a capture rate of at least 75% for particles between 0.3 and 1.0 micrometers. Although the capture rate of a MERV filter is lower than that of a HEPA filter, a central air system can move significantly more air in the same period of time. Using a high-grade MERV filter can be more effective than using a high-powered HEPA machine at a fraction of the initial capital expenditure. Unfortunately, most furnace filters are slid in place without an airtight seal, which allows air to pass around the filters. This problem is worse for the higher-efficiency MERV filters because of the increase in air resistance. Higher-efficiency MERV filters are usually denser and increase air resistance in the central system, requiring a greater air pressure drop and consequently increasing energy costs. = Other methods = *Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation - UVGI can be used to sterilize air that passes UV lamps via forced air. Air purification UVGI systems can be freestanding units with shielded UV lamps that use a fan to force air past the UV light. Other systems are installed in forced air systems so that the circulation for the premises moves micro-organisms past the lamps. Key to this form of sterilization is the placement of the UV lamps and a good filtration system to remove the dead micro-organisms. For example, forced air systems by design impede line-of-sight, thus creating areas of the environment that will be shaded from the UV light. However, a UV lamp placed at the coils and drain pan of the cooling system will keep micro-organisms from forming in these naturally damp places. The most effective method for treating the air rather than the coils is in-line duct systems, these systems are placed in the center of the duct and parallel to the airflow. *Activated carbon is a porous material that can adsorb volatile chemicals on a molecular basis, but does not remove larger particles. The adsorption process when using activated carbon must reach equilibrium thus it may be difficult to completely remove contaminants. Activated carbon is merely a process of changing contaminants from a gaseous phase to a solid phase, when aggravated or disturbed contaminants can be regenerated in indoor air sources. Activated carbon can be used at room temperature and has a long history of commercial use. It is normally used in conjunction with other filter technology, especially with HEPA. Other materials can also absorb chemicals but at a higher cost. *Polarized-media electronic air cleaners use active electronically enhanced media to combine elements of both electronic air cleaners and passive mechanical filters. Most polarized-media electronic air cleaners use safe 24-volt DC voltage to establish the polarizing electric field. Most airborne particles have a charge and many are even bi-polar. As airborne particles pass through the electric field the polarized field re- orients the particle to adhere to a disposable fiber media pad. Ultra-fine particles (UFPs) that are not collected on their initial pass through the media pad are polarized and agglomerate to other particles, odor and VOC molecules and are collected on subsequent passes. The efficiency of polarized- media electronic air cleaners increases as they load, providing high- efficiency filtration, with air resistance typically equal to or less than passive filters. Polarized-media technology is non-ionizing, which means no ozone is produced. *Photocatalytic oxidation (PCO) is an emerging technology in the HVAC industry. In addition to the prospect of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) benefits, it has the added potential for limiting the introduction of unconditioned air to the building space, thereby presenting an opportunity to achieve energy savings over previous prescriptive designs. As of May 2009 there was no more disputable concern raised by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory data that PCO may significantly increase the amount of formaldehyde in real indoor environments. As with other advanced technologies, sound engineering principles and practices should be employed by the HVAC designer to ensure proper application of the technology. Photocatalytic oxidation systems are able to completely oxidize and degrade organic contaminants. For example, Volatile Organic Compounds found low concentrations within a few hundred ppmv or less are the most likely to be completely oxidized.W.A. Zeltner, D.T. Tompkins. (2005). \\"Shedding light on photocatalysis\\". ASHRAE Transactions 3: 523-534.(PCO) uses short-wave ultraviolet light (UVC), commonly used for sterilization, to energize the catalyst (usually titanium dioxide (TiO2)) and oxidize bacteria and viruses. PCO in-duct units can be mounted to an existing forced-air HVAC system. PCO is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. It is sometimes coupled with other filtering technologies for air purification. UV sterilization bulbs must be replaced about once a year; manufacturers may require periodic replacement as a condition of warranty. Photocatalytic Oxidation systems often have high commercial costs. :A related technology relevant to air purification is photoelectrochemical oxidation (PECO) Photoelectrochemical oxidation. While technically a type of PCO, PECO involves electrochemical interactions among the catalyst material and reactive species (e.g., through emplacement of cathodic materials) to improve quantum efficiency; in this way, it is possible to use lower energy UVA radiation as the light source and yet achieve improved effectiveness. *Ionizer purifiers use charged electrical surfaces or needles to generate electrically charged air or gas ions. These ions attach to airborne particles which are then electrostatically attracted to a charged collector plate. This mechanism produces trace amounts of ozone and other oxidants as by-products. Most ionizers produce less than 0.05 ppm of ozone, an industrial safety standard. There are two major subdivisions: the fanless ionizer and fan-based ionizer. Fanless ionizers are noiseless and use little power, but are less efficient at air purification. Fan-based ionizers clean and distribute air much faster. Permanently mounted home and industrial ionizer purifiers are called electrostatic precipitators. *Immobilized cell technology removes microfine particulate matter from the air by attracting charged particulates to a bio-reactive mass, or bioreactor, which enzymatically renders them inert. *Ozone generators are designed to produce ozone and are sometimes sold as whole-house air cleaners. Unlike ionizers, ozone generators are intended to produce significant amounts of ozone, a strong oxidant gas which can oxidize many other chemicals. The only safe use of ozone generators is in unoccupied rooms, utilising \\"shock treatment\\" commercial ozone generators that produce over 3000 mg of ozone per hour. Restoration contractors use these types of ozone generators to remove smoke odors after fire damage, musty smells after flooding, mold (including toxic molds), and the stench caused by decaying flesh which cannot be removed by bleach or anything else except for ozone. However, it is not healthy to breathe ozone gas, and one should use extreme caution when buying a room air purifier that also produces ozone. *Titanium dioxide (TiO2) technology - nanoparticles of TiO2, together with calcium carbonate to neutralize any acidic gasses that may be adsorbed, is mixed into slightly porous paint. Photocatalysis initiates the decomposition of airborne contaminants at the surface. *Thermodynamic sterilization (TSS) - This technology uses heat sterilization via a ceramic core with microcapillaries, which are heated to . It is claimed that 99.9% of microbiological particles - bacteria, viruses, dust mite allergens, mold and fungus spores - are incinerated. The air passes through the ceramic core by the natural process of air convection, and is then cooled using heat transfer plates and released. TSS is not a filtering technology, as it does not trap or remove particles. TSS is claimed not to emit harmful by-products (although the byproducts of partial thermal decomposition are not addressed) and also reduces the concentration of ozone in the atmosphere. Consumer concerns Other aspects of air cleaners are hazardous gaseous by-products, noise level, frequency of filter replacement, electrical consumption, and visual appeal. Ozone production is typical for air ionizing purifiers. Although a high concentration of ozone is dangerous, most air ionizers produce low amounts (< 0.05 ppm). The noise level of a purifier can be obtained through a customer service department and is usually reported in decibels (dB). The noise levels for most purifiers are low compared to many other home appliances. Frequency of filter replacement and electrical consumption are the major operation costs for any purifier. There are many types of filters; some can be cleaned by water, by hand or by vacuum cleaner, while others need to be replaced every few months or years. In the United States, some purifiers are certified as Energy Star and are energy efficient. HEPA technology is used in portable air purifiers as it removes common airborne allergens. The US Department of Energy has requirements manufacturers must pass to meet HEPA requirements. The HEPA specification requires removal of at least 99.97% of 0.3 micrometers airborne pollutants. Products that claim to be \\"HEPA-type\\", \\"HEPA-like\\", or \\"99% HEPA\\" do not satisfy these requirements and may not have been tested in independent laboratories. Air purifiers may be rated on a variety of factors, including Clean Air Delivery Rate (which determines how well air has been purified); efficient area coverage; air changes per hour; energy usage; and the cost of the replacement filters. Two other important factors to consider are the length that the filters are expected to last (measured in months or years) and the noise produced (measured in decibels) by the various settings that the purifier runs on. This information is available from most manufacturers. Potential ozone hazards As with other health-related appliances, there is controversy surrounding the claims of certain companies, especially involving ionic air purifiers. Many air purifiers generate some ozone, an energetic allotrope of three oxygen atoms, and in the presence of humidity, small amounts of NOx. Because of the nature of the ionization process, ionic air purifiers tend to generate the most ozone. This is a serious concern because ozone is a criteria air pollutant regulated by health-related US federal and state standards. In a controlled experiment, in many cases, ozone concentrations were well in excess of public and/or industrial safety levels established by US Environmental Protection Agency, particularly in poorly ventilated rooms. Ozone can damage the lungs, causing chest pain, coughing, shortness of breath and throat irritation. It can also worsen chronic respiratory diseases such as asthma and compromise the ability of the body to fight respiratory infections—even in healthy people. People who have asthma and allergy are most prone to the adverse effects of high levels of ozone. For example, increasing ozone concentrations to unsafe levels can increase the risk of asthma attacks. Due to the below average performance and potential health risks, Consumer Reports has advised against using ozone producing air purifiers. IQAir, the educational partner of the American Lung Association, has been a leading industry voice against ozone-producing air cleaning technology. Ozone generators used for shock treatments (unoccupied rooms) which are needed by smoke, mold, and odor remediation contractors as well as crime scene cleanup companies to oxidize and permanently remove smoke, mold, and odor damage are considered a valuable and effective tool when used correctly for commercial and industrial purposes. However, there is a growing body of evidence that these machines can produce undesirable by-products. In September 2007, the California Air Resources Board announced a ban of indoor air cleaning devices which produce ozone above a legal limit. This law, which took effect in 2010, requires testing and certification of all types of indoor air cleaning devices to verify that they do not emit excessive ozone.  Industry and markets  As of 2015, the United States residential air purifier total addressable market was estimated at around $2 billion per year.

Born in Loudonville, Ohio, Bacher obtained his undergraduate degree and doctorate from the University of Michigan, writing his 1930 doctoral thesis under the supervision of Samuel Goudsmit on the Zeeman effect of the hyperfine structure of atomic levels. After graduate work at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), he accepted a job at Columbia University. In 1935 he accepted an offer from Hans Bethe to work with him at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, It was there that Bacher collaborated with Bethe on his book Nuclear Physics. A: Stationary States of Nuclei (1936), the first of three books that would become known as the \\"Bethe Bible\\". In December 1940, Bacher joined the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, although he did not immediately cease his research at Cornell into the neutron cross section of cadmium. The Radiation Laboratory was organized into two sections, one for incoming radar signals, and one for outgoing radar signals. Bacher was appointed to handle the incoming signals section. Here he gained valuable experience in administration, coordinating not just the efforts of his scientists, but also those of General Electric and RCA. In 1942, Bacher was approached by Robert Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at its new laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. It was at Bacher's insistence that Los Alamos became a civilian rather than a military laboratory. At Los Alamos, Bacher headed the project's P (Physics) Division, and later its G (Gadget) Division. Bacher worked closely with Oppenheimer, and the two men discussed the project's progress on a daily basis. After the war, Bacher became director of the Laboratory of Nuclear Studies at Cornell. He also served on the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency that replaced the wartime Manhattan Project, and in 1947 he became one of its inaugural commissioners. He left in 1949 to become head Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. He was appointed a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) in 1958. In 1962, he became Caltech's vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He died in 2004 at the age of 99.  Early life and career  Bacher was born in Loudonville, Ohio, on August 31, 1905, the only child of Harry and Byrl Fox Bacher. In 1908, the family moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Harry worked as a banker and Byrl as a voice teacher on the University of Michigan faculty. Bacher attended the W. S. Perry School, and later Ann Arbor High School. While there he met Professor Harrison M. Randall, the head of the physics department at the University of Michigan, who encouraged him to study physics. Bacher entered the University of Michigan, where he joined the Kappa Sigma fraternity and lived in the frat house. He became the house manager in his sophomore year, but moved back home in his junior year to concentrate on physics. At Randall's suggestion he applied to the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, which he entered in 1926 to study for his doctorate. His fees were paid by his family, but his father had a heart attack and could no longer afford them, so in 1927 Bacher moved back to Ann Arbor, where he lived at home, and attended the University of Michigan. He received a Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowship from General Electric. To build up the theoretical physics department at the University of Michigan, Randall recruited four distinguished young physicists to work at Ann Arbor in 1927: Otto Laporte, George Uhlenbeck, Samuel Goudsmit, and David M. Dennison. The University of Michigan was no longer a backwater in theoretical physics. Bacher immediately signed up for Goudsmit's course on atomic structure. With Goudsmit he investigated the Zeeman effect of hyperfine structure of atomic levels, which became the subject of his 1930 PhD thesis. On May 30, 1930, Bacher married Jean Dow. His mother gave them a Ford Model A and the use of the family's lakeside holiday house, where they entertained guests including Paul Ehrenfest and Enrico Fermi. In 1931, with a National Research Council Fellowship, he spent a year at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) because Ira Bowen taught there. At Caltech Bacher attended lectures by Robert Oppenheimer, but spent most of his time at the Mt. Wilson Observatory, which had a better library. Bacher decided to create a work listing the energy, coupling constant, parity and electron configurations of all the known atoms and ions, working with Goudsmit back in Ann Arbor. The result was a book, Atomic Energy States as Derived from the Analysis of Optical Spectra (1932), which they dedicated to Randall. In the second year of his National Research Council Fellowship, Bacher moved across the country to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to work with John C. Slater, who had taught Bacher at Harvard. While there, Slater asked him to conduct a seminar on John Chadwick's recent discovery of the neutron. Reading Chadwick's paper, he realized that anomalies in then- current theory would be resolved if the spin of the neutron was ½. This became the subject of a letter he submitted to the Physical Review with visiting scholar Edward Condon. A year later, Bacher became the first to suggest the neutron had a magnetic moment equal to about minus one nuclear magneton, based on the unusually small magnetic moment of nitrogen determined from its hyperfine structure. Afterwards Bacher returned to the University of Michigan on an Alfred H. Lloyd Fellowship. Jobs were hard to find at this time due to the Great Depression, and in 1934 he accepted a job at Columbia University, where he worked with Isidor Isaac Rabi, Jerrold Zacharias, Jerome Kellogg and Sid Millman. However it was difficult living in New York on his salary, and Jean gave birth to their first child, Martha, in December 1935. A second child, Andrew, was born in 1938. Bacher therefore accepted an offer from Hans Bethe to work with him at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. Ithaca was a university town similar to Ann Arbor, where Bacher and Jean had been raised. At Cornell Bacher worked with Bethe on his book Nuclear Physics. A: Stationary States of Nuclei (1936), the first of three books that would become known as the \\"Bethe Bible\\".  World War II  = Radiation Laboratory = In December 1940 Bacher joined the Radiation Laboratory at MIT, but did not immediately cease his research. He reached an arrangement with its director, Lee Alvin DuBridge, to return to Cornell for four days every three weeks until it was completed. He was researching the neutron cross section of cadmium, a topic of interest to Enrico Fermi, who was attempting to build a nuclear reactor, but whose figures did not agree with Bacher's. Bacher carefully checked his results, and Fermi, convinced of their correctness, urged Bacher to publish them. Bacher submitted a paper to the Physical Review with instructions to withhold publication until after the war, and the paper was not published until 1946. DuBridge organized the Radiation Laboratory into two sections, one for incoming radar signals, and one for outgoing radar signals. Bacher was appointed to handle the incoming signals section. Here he gained valuable experience in administration, coordinating not just the efforts of his scientists, but also those of General Electric and RCA. He later recalled: = Manhattan Project = In 1942, Bacher and Rabi, the Radiation Laboratory's assistant director, were approached by Oppenheimer to join the Manhattan Project at its new laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico. They convinced Oppenheimer that the plan for a military laboratory would not work, since a scientific effort would need to be a civilian affair. The plan was modified, and the new laboratory would be a civilian one, run by the University of California under contract from the War Department. Bacher felt that this was his first contribution to the success of the project. He met with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos in April 1943, but was not convinced that he was needed. Oppenheimer wrote to him that: Bacher is awarded the alt= Two men in suits, with medals pinned on the left breast. One shakes hands with a fat man in an Army uniform. Bacher then accepted the job at Los Alamos, moving there in May 1943 with his family to become the head of the Experimental Physics Division (P Division). His wife Jean was also hired to work as a human computer in the Theoretical Division (T Division). For his seven group leaders he had John H. Williams, Robert R. Wilson, John H. Manley, Darol K. Froman, Emilio G. Segrè, Bruno B. Rossi and Donald W. Kerst. Bacher worked closely with Oppenheimer, and the two men discussed the project's progress on a daily basis. In July 1944, Oppenheimer reorganized the laboratory to focus on the problem of building an implosion-type nuclear weapon, which was necessary because the gun-type design would not work with plutonium. P Division was broken up, and Bacher became the head of the G (for Gadget) Division. This much larger division contained eleven groups headed by leaders who included William Higinbotham, Seth Neddermeyer, Edwin McMillan, Luis Alvarez and Otto Frisch. While George Kistiakowsky's Explosives Division (X Division) developed the explosive lenses, G Division designed the rest of the weapon. There were numerous difficulties to overcome, not the least of which was devising a means of detonating the lenses with the required speed. Robert F. Christy's solid core design was chosen as the most likely design to succeed. To coordinate the efforts of the laboratory, Oppenheimer created the \\"Cowpuncher Committee\\", so- called because they were to \\"ride herd\\" on the implosion effort and coordinate all the efforts of the laboratory. It included Bacher, along with Samuel Allison, George Kistiakowsky, Deak Parsons, Charles Lauritsen and Hartley Rowe. Three days before the day the bomb was to be test detonated in the New Mexico desert, Bacher was part of the pit assembly team, which assembled the nuclear capsule (a cylindrical section of the uranium tamper, containing the plutonium core and initiator) in an old farmhouse near the Alamogordo testing site. When the capsule was driven to the shot tower and inserted into the spherical tamper, inside the explosive assembly, it stuck. Bacher recognized that expansion of the capsule due to the heat given off by the plutonium core was causing the jam, and that leaving the two parts in contact would equalize temperatures and allow the capsule to be inserted fully. After watching the test, his reaction was merely \\"Well, it works.\\" Bacher was packaging the third core for shipment to Tinian on August 12 at the Ice House at Los Alamos when he received word that the Japanese had initiated surrender negotiations. He had already set G Division the task of designing and building new types of cores and assemblies, and he co-authored a report with Robert Wilson urging the development of Edward Teller's Super bomb. He served on a committee chaired by Richard Tolman that looked into declassifying documents produced by the Manhattan Project, and one chaired by Manson Benedict that investigated the technical feasibility of international control of nuclear energy. For his services to the Manhattan Project Bacher was awarded the Medal for Merit on January 12, 1946.  Post-World War II  = Atomic Energy Commission = After the war, Bacher returned to Ithaca to head Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies. He agreed with Bethe that what Cornell needed to become a major player in high energy nuclear physics was a new synchrotron, but first he needed to find somewhere to put it. However, in 1946 Bacher was appointed to the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee of the new United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, along with fellow United States representatives Tolman and Oppenheimer. Bacher therefore had to divide his time between Ithaca and New York City. The five Atomic Energy Commissioners at Los Alamos. Left to right: Bacher, alt=Five men in suits with hats and coats. In October 1946 David Lilienthal asked Bacher to become one of the inaugural commissioners of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the civilian agency that was being formed to replace the wartime Manhattan Project. As a Republican, Bacher was easily confirmed by the Senate members of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy by an 8–0 vote. As he was the only one of the five commissioners who was a scientist—an important factor in his decision to accept the post—he played a leading role in the selection of the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee to which nine scientists were appointed: James Conant, Lee DuBridge, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenheimer, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hartley Rowe, Glenn Seaborg, Cyril Stanley Smith and Hood Worthington. Bacher and fellow commissioner Sumner Pike began with an inspection of Los Alamos and the Hanford Site, and conducted an inventory of the fissionable material at Los Alamos with Norris Bradbury, who had succeeded Oppenheimer as its director. He found that only nine atomic bombs had been built in 1946; only four would be in 1947, primarily due to production problems with the reactors at Hanford. These problems were on their way to resolution when Bacher observed the Operation Sandstone nuclear tests at Enewetak Atoll in 1948 as the Atomic Energy Commission's representative. Bacher's original two-year term would have expired on January 1, 1949, but President Harry Truman convinced him to stay on. Bacher resigned in May 1949, and this time the President was unable to dissuade him. Bacher wished to return to academia, but Robert Wilson was now the head of Cornell's Laboratory for Nuclear Studies, and Bacher felt that it would be awkward working for someone who was one of his group leaders at Los Alamos. He therefore accepted an offer from Lee DuBridge of the chair of the Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy at Caltech. However the work at the Atomic Energy Commission was not so easily left behind. Senator Bourke Hickenlooper charged the commission with mismanagement, specifically cost overruns at Hanford, awarding a scholarship to a communist, and the loss of of uranium from the Argonne National Laboratory. Bacher felt obligated to return to Washington to testify on Lilienthal's behalf before the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. Another crisis broke in September 1949 when the Air Force picked up signs of the Soviet Union's RDS-1 nuclear test. Bacher joined Oppenheimer, Parsons, General Hoyt Vandenberg, the Atomic Energy Commissioners and a British delegation under William Penney to discuss what to do. The recent devaluation of the British pound had already triggered a financial crisis, and there was concern about how the markets would react to the news. Oppenheimer and Bacher saw the evidence of a nuclear test as conclusive, and Bacher in particular came down strongly on the side of making a public announcement, as the number of people who already knew made a leak almost inevitable. Truman made the announcement a few days later. = Caltech = The division chair that Bacher now occupied at Caltech had been vacant since Robert A. Millikan had retired in 1945. Although nominally a professorship, it was primarily an administrative post. In 1949 there were 17 professors in the department, of whom nine were physicists, two were astrophysicists, and the remaining six were mathematicians. There were two world class research laboratories funded by the Office of Naval Research, the Cosmic Ray Laboratory that had been founded by Millikan, which was now directed by Carl Anderson, and the W. K. Kellogg Radiation Laboratory which was directed by Charles Lauritsen. But there were no facilities for high energy physics; these would have to be created from scratch. In moving into high energy physics Bacher had the full support not just of DuBridge, but of Anderson and Lauritsen as well. Lauritsen had already hired Robert Langmuir to begin designing a new 600 MeV synchrotron, and Bacher found a large building to house it that had originally been used for grinding and polishing the Palomar Observatory's mirror, but which had been empty since 1948. He arranged for Atomic Energy Commission and Office of Naval Research grants worth $1 million to build it and the other required facilities, and $300,000 a year to run it. Facilities were not enough; Bacher needed physicists. Lauritsen had made a start on this too, by hiring Robert Christy. Bacher hired experimental physicists Alvin V. Tollestrup, Robert M. Walker and Matthew Sands. The physicist that Bacher decided he wanted most, though, was Richard Feynman. To get him, Bacher offered a large salary, and agreed to pay for Feynman's 1950–1951 sabbatical in Brazil. Feynman would go on to win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965. In 1955 Bacher hired Murray Gell-Mann, who would win the Nobel Prize in 1969. The relatively new field of radio astronomy sparked Bacher's interest, and he hired John Bolton and Gordon Stanley from the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in 1955. A grant from the Office of Naval Research allowed Bolton to build the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, which became an important center for the study of quasars. Caltech did not spell an end to Bacher's service in Washington. He served two terms as a member of the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC) under President Dwight D. Eisenhower, from November 18, 1953, to June 30, 1955, and from December 9, 1957, to December 31, 1959. During his first term he testified on behalf of his old friend at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954. During his second, he worked with James L. Fisk and Ernest Lawrence to examine how a Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty could be monitored. Bacher remained chair of the division of physics, mathematics and astronomy at Caltech until 1962, when he was appointed as vice president and provost. He stepped down from the post of provost in 1970 at the age of 65, and became a professor emeritus in 1976. He still did some research at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and visited Caltech from time to time. In 1983 he was master of ceremonies at Los Alamos for events commemorating the 40th anniversary of the founding of the laboratory in 1943. Bacher died on November 18, 2004, at a retirement home in Montecito, California. He was survived by his daughter, Martha Bacher Eaton, and son, Andrew Dow Bacher, a nuclear physicist working at Indiana University, his wife Jean having died on May 28, 1994. His papers are in the California Institute of Technology Archives.

It may have been a partial creole language based on Zeelandic and West Flemish Dutch dialects with English and possibly some elements of Lenape. Jersey Dutch was spoken by the descendants of Dutch settlers in New Jersey, who began to arrive at Bergen in 1630, and by their black slaves and free people of color also residing in that region, as well as the mixed race people known as the Ramapough Mountain Indians. Negro Dutch A variety of this dialect, referred to by Jersey Dutch speakers as neger-dauts (\\"Negro Dutch\\", not to be confused with the Dutch creole Negerhollands) was spoken only by the Black population. It was distinguished from Jersey Dutch by pronunciation and grammar, reflecting African linguistic retentions: an overall decline in inflection, apparently including a loss of past tense verb forms because of isolation from other Dutch speakers and contact with English- speaking settlers.

Note her broken back, with smoke pouring from amidships. Minesweeping is the practice of the removal of explosive naval mines, usually by a specially designed ship called a minesweeper using various measures to either capture or detonate the mines, but sometimes also with an aircraft made for that purpose. Minesweeping has been practiced since the advent of naval mining in 1855 in the Crimean War. The first minesweepers date to that war and consisted of British rowboats trailing grapnels to snag the mines.Howard S. Levie, Mine Warfare at Sea (1992), p. 119. By ship A sweep is either a contact sweep, a wire dragged through the water by one or two ships to cut the mooring wire of floating mines, or a distance sweep that mimics a ship to detonate the mines. The sweeps are dragged by minesweepers, either purpose-built military ships or converted trawlers. Each run covers between , and the ships must move slowly in a straight line, making them vulnerable to enemy fire. This was exploited by the Turkish army in the Battle of Gallipoli in 1915, when mobile howitzer batteries prevented the British and French from clearing a way through minefields. If a contact sweep hits a mine, the wire of the sweep rubs against the mooring wire until it is cut. Sometimes \\"cutters\\", explosive devices to cut the mine's wire, are used to lessen the strain on the sweeping wire. Mines cut free are recorded and collected for research or shot with a deck gun. Before World War I, the Imperial Russian Navy officer Pyotr Kitkin invented \\"mine protectors\\" to break a sweeping wire before it could cut the mine's mooring wire. Minesweepers protect themselves with an oropesa or paravane instead of a second minesweeper. These are torpedo-shaped towed bodies, similar in shape to a Harvey Torpedo, that are streamed from the sweeping vessel thus keeping the sweep at a determined depth and position. Some large warships were routinely equipped with paravane sweeps near the bows in case they inadvertently sailed into minefields—the mine would be deflected towards the paravane by the wire instead of towards the ship by its wake. More recently, heavy-lift helicopters have dragged minesweeping sleds, as in the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The distance sweep mimics the sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater drums. It is the only sweep effective against bottom mines. During the Second World War, RAF Coastal Command used Vickers Wellington bombers Wellington DW.Mk I fitted with degaussing coils to trigger magnetic mines. Modern influence mines are designed to discriminate against false inputs and are therefore much harder to sweep. They often contain inherent anti-sweeping mechanisms. For example, they may be programmed to respond to the unique noise of a particular ship-type, its associated magnetic signature and the typical pressure displacement of such a vessel. As a result, a mine-sweeper must accurately guess and mimic the required target signature in order to trigger detonation. The task is complicated by the fact that an influence mine may have one or more of a hundred different potential target signatures programmed into it. Slide 34 of 81. Hosted by Federation of American Scientists. Another anti-sweeping mechanism is a ship-counter in the mine fuze. When enabled, this allows detonation only after the mine fuze has been triggered a pre-set number of times. To further complicate matters, influence mines may be programmed to arm themselves (or disarm automatically—known as self-sterilization) after a pre-set time. During the pre-set arming delay (which could last days or even weeks) the mine would remain dormant and ignore any target stimulus, whether genuine or faked. When influence mines are laid in an ocean minefield, they may have various combinations of fuze settings configured. For example, some mines (with the acoustic sensor enabled) may become active within three hours of being laid, others (with the acoustic and magnetic sensors enabled) may become active after two weeks but have the ship-counter mechanism set to ignore the first two trigger events, and still others in the same minefield (with the magnetic and pressure sensors enabled) may not become armed until three weeks have passed. Groups of mines within this mine-field may have different target signatures which may or may not overlap. The fuzes on influence mines allow many different permutations, which complicates the clearance process. Mines with ship-counters, arming delays and highly specific target signatures in mine fuses can falsely convince a belligerent that a particular area is clear of mines or has been swept effectively because a succession of vessels have already passed through safely. By aircraft MH-53E of the United States Navy towing an MK105 mine sweeping sled. Aircraft can also be used for minesweeping. During World War II, fifteen British Vickers Wellington bombers were modified to carry a large magnetic induction loop and an electrical generator. The 'Directional Wireless Installation' (DWI), a cover story for the true purpose of the magnetic loop, was used successfully on May 10, 1940 to sweep a path for the escape of the Dutch Royal Family to the UK. The DWI was used most successfully in the Mediterranean theatre, particularly over the Suez Canal and Alexandria Harbour. Their use revealed the limitations of the technique, in that it only works effectively in very shallow water (such as canals and harbours). From about 1943, German Junkers Ju 52 transports were similarly converted. Blohm & Voss BV 138 MS tri-engine flying boats were also used for this purpose. The MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter is used primarily by the United States Navy to tow several types of mine hunting or mine sweeping gear through the water. It replaced the earlier, RH-53A and RH-53D variants of the Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. Other examples of minesweeping helicopters include the RH-3A variant of the Sikorsky SH-3 Sea King, as well as the Mi-14BT variant of the Mil Mi-14 and the MCH-101 variant of the Augusta Westland AW101.

He was one of the pioneers of the idea of a space elevator. The February issue of the ISEC Newsletter Yuri Artsutanov obituary is devoted to his life and place in history and features reminisces and photographs from his colleagues in the West, including his attendance at the 2010 ISEC Space Elevator conference. Biography Artsutanov was a graduate of Leningrad Technological Institute. In 1960, he wrote an article \\"V Kosmos na Electrovoze (en. Into space with the help of an electric locomotive)\\", where he discussed the concept of the space elevator as an economic, safe and convenient way to access orbit and facilitate space exploration. Artsutanov developed his idea independently from Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, who in 1895 proposed an idea of building an orbital tower. Artsutanov's concept was based on the linking of geosynchronous satellites to the ground with a cable. He suggested using the satellite as the base from which to construct the tower since a geosynchronous satellite will remain over a fixed point on the equator.The Navigator Quarterly News Letter (September 2002) By using a counterweight, a cable would be lowered from the geosynchronous orbit to the surface of Earth while the counterweight was extended from the satellite away from Earth, keeping the center of mass of the cable at the same height above the Earth. The ideas of Tsiolkovsky's compression-structure concept and Artsutanov's tension-structure concept differ in that a compression structure is well outside conceivable future capabilities, while the tension-structure is much easier to build and maintain, and is considered possible with near-future technologies. Artsutanov later went on to propose other concepts involving space tethers, including the lunar space elevator, and using rotating tethers for space transportation.J.

(Note that beginning in mid-2010, the people formerly known as “Saramaka” began identifying themselves, in their official documents in English, as \\"Saamaka,\\" to conform to their own pronunciation.) In 2007, the Saramaka won a ruling by the Inter-American Court for Human Rights supporting their land rights in Suriname for lands they have historically occupied, over national government claims. It was a landmark decision for indigenous peoples in the world. They have received compensation for damages and control this fund for their own development goals. The word \\"Maroon\\" comes from the Spanish cimarrón, which was derived from an Arawakan root. Since 1990 especially, some of the Saramaka have migrated to French Guiana due to extended civil war in Suriname. By the early 16th century, the term \\"maroon\\" (cimarron) was used throughout the Americas to designate slaves who had escaped from slavery and set up independent communities beyond colonists' control. Together with five other Maroon tribes in Suriname and French Guiana, the Saramaka form the largest group in the world of Maroon peoples of African descent.  Setting and language  The 90,000 Saramaka in Suriname (some of whom live in neighboring French Guiana) are one minority within this multi-ethnic nation. The Saramaka, together with the other Maroons in Suriname and French Guiana: the Ndyuka (90,000), and the Matawai, Paramaka, Aluku, and Kwinti (who together number some 25,000), constitute by far the world's largest surviving population of Maroons of African descent. Since their escape from slavery in the 17th and 18th centuries, the Saramaka have lived chiefly along the upper Suriname River and its tributaries, the Gaánlío and the Pikílío. Since the 1960s, they also live along the lower Suriname River in villages constructed by the colonial government and Alcoa, a major aluminum company. They were relocated to allow flooding of approximately half their tribal territory for a hydroelectric project built to supply electricity for an aluminum smelter. Today, about one-third of the Saramaka live in French Guiana, most having migrated there since 1990 after warfare in Suriname. The Saramaka and the Matawai (in central Suriname) speak variants of a creole language called Saramaccan. The Ndyuka, Paramaka, and Aluku, (in eastern Suriname), as well as the several hundred Kwinti, speak variants of another creole language, Ndyuka. Both languages are historically related to Sranan Tongo, the creole language of coastal Suriname. About 50 percent of the Saramaccan lexicon derives from various West and Central African languages, 20 percent from English (the language of the original colonists in Suriname), 20 percent from Portuguese (the language of the overseers and slave masters on many Suriname plantations), and the remaining 10 percent from Amerindian languages and Dutch (the latter were later colonists).Richard Price, Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2008, p. 436. Although lexically different, the grammar resembles that of the other Atlantic creoles and derives from West African models.  History  The ancestors of the Saramaka were among those Africans sold as plantation slaves to Europeans in Suriname in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Coming from a variety of West and Central African peoples speaking many different languages, they escaped into the dense rainforest – individually, in small groups, and sometimes in great collective rebellions. For nearly 100 years, they fought from the rainforest for their independence. They were so feared that late 18th century maps showed the defensive fortifications in the European colony intended to protect against their raids. In 1762, a full century before the general emancipation of slaves in Suriname, the Maroons won their freedom and signed a treaty with the Dutch Crown to acknowledge their territorial rights and trading privileges. The Saramaka have a keen interest in the history of their formative years; they preserve their very rich oral tradition. Innovative scholarly research since the late 20th century has brought together oral and archival accounts in new histories. Like the other Suriname Maroons, the Saramaka lived almost as a state-within-a-state until the mid-20th century, when the pace of outside encroachments increased. During the late 1980s, a civil war between Maroons and the military government of Suriname caused considerable hardship to the Saramaka and other Maroons. By mid-1989 approximately 3,000 Saramaka and 8,000 Ndyuka were living as temporary refugees in French Guiana. Access to the outside world was severely restricted for many Saramaka in their homeland. The end of the war in the mid-1990s initiated a period in which the national government largely neglected the needs of Saramaka and other Maroons while granting large timber and mining concessions to foreign multinationals (Chinese, Indonesian, Malaysian, and others) in traditional Saramaka territory. They did not consult the Saramaka authorities. In addition, during this period there were numerous social changes, both on the coast of Suriname and in Saramaka territory. United States Peace Corps volunteers lived and worked in Saramaka villages, and Brazilian gold-miners arrived on the Suriname river. Such economic activities as prostitution, casino gambling, and drug smuggling became major industries in coastal Suriname and accompanied the miners to the interior. In the mid-1990s, the Association of Saramaka Authorities filed a complaint before the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights to protect their land rights. In November 2007, the Inter-American Court for Human Rights ruled in favor of the Saramaka people against the government of Suriname. In this landmark decision, which establishes a precedent for all Maroon and indigenous peoples in the Americas, the Saramaka were granted collective rights to the lands on which their ancestors had lived since the early 18th century, including rights to decide about the exploitation of natural resources such as timber and gold within that territory. In addition, they were granted compensation from the government for damages caused by previous timber grants made to Chinese companies. This was paid into a special development fund, which is now managed by the Saramaka.  Subsistence, economy, and the arts  Example of art by the Saramaka folk Traditional villages, which average 100 to 200 residents, consist of a core of matrilineal kin plus some wives and children of lineage men. Always located near a river, for water, transportation and fishing, they are constructed of an irregular arrangement of small houses, open-sided structures, domesticated trees, occasional chicken houses, various shrines, and scattered patches of bush. (In contrast, the so- called transmigration villages, built to house the 6,000 Saramaka displaced by the hydroelectric project, range up to 2,000 people. They are laid out in a European-style grid pattern, used throughout larger South American cities. In many cases they have been located far from the riverside, making life difficult for the occupants.) Horticultural camps, which include permanent houses and shrines, are located several hours by canoe from each village. They are exploited by small groups of women related through matrilineal ties. Due to their matrilineal ties, many women have a house in their own birth village, another in their horticultural camp, and a third in their husband's village. Men divide their time among several different houses, built at various times for themselves and for their wives. Traditional Saramaka houses are compact, wide enough to tie a hammock and not much longer from front to back; with walls of planks and woven palm fronds, and traditionally roofs of thatch or, increasingly, of corrugated metal. They do not have windows but often have elaborately carved facades. Since the Suriname civil war, the Saramaka have built an increasing number of houses in coastal, Western style. They use concrete as well as wood, and feature windows and more expansive floor plans. For more than two centuries, the economy has been based on full exploitation of the forest environment and on periodic work trips by men to the coast to bring back Western goods. For subsistence, the Saramaka depend on shifting (swidden) horticulture done mostly by women, with hunting and fishing done by men, supplemented by the women gathering wild forest products, such as palm nuts. They imported a few key items, such as salt. Rice is the most cultivated crop, in dry (hillside) technique. Other crops include cassava, taro, okra, maize, plantains, bananas, sugarcane, and peanuts. Domesticated trees, such as coconut, orange, breadfruit, papaya, and calabash are mainly cultivated in the villages. There are no markets. Until the late 20th century, the Saramaka produced most of their material culture, much of it embellished with decorative detail. Women sewed patchwork and embroidered clothing, and carved calabash bowls. Some men also produced baskets, and some women made pottery. Men built the houses and canoes. In addition, they carved a wide range of wooden objects for domestic use, such as stools, paddles, winnowing trays, cooking utensils, and combs. Today, an increasing number of items, including clothing, are imported from the coast. Body cicatrization, practiced by virtually all Saramaka women as late as the 1970s and 1980s, had become relatively uncommon by the start of the 21st century. Numerous genres of singing, dance, drumming, and tale telling continue to be a vibrant part of Saramaka culture.For examples of popular songs, work songs, finger piano pieces, children's riddles, drum language on the apínti talking drum, and more, see Once the men have cleared and burned the fields, horticulture is mainly women's work. Women cultivate and process a variety of crops, choosing which to develop to continue preferred qualities. They process the food for meals and storage of foods such as peanuts. They use parts of plants to make some needed goods. The men conduct hunting of game with shotguns; they also do most of the fishing as well. Men have long devoted a large portion of their adult years to earning money in work in coastal Suriname or French Guiana. This allows them to buy the Western goods considered essential to life in their home villages, such as shotguns and powder, tools, pots, cloth, hammocks, soap, kerosene, and rum. During the second half of the 20th century, small stores were established in many villages, making more goods available. Outboard motors, transistor radios, and tape recorders became common consumer items. Today, cell phones are ubiquitous; both men and women have greatly increased communication with Paramaribo. New economic opportunities in the gold industry – mining for men, prostitution for women – are being exploited.  Social organization  Saramaka society is firmly based on a matrilineal kinship system. A clan (lo) – often several thousand individuals – consists of the matrilineal descendants of an original band of escaped slaves. Children are considered born into this clan. It is subdivided into lineages (bee) – usually 50 to 150 people – descended from a more recent ancestress. Several lineages from a single clan constitute the core of every village. The matrilineal clans (lo) own land, based on claims staked out in the early 18th century as the original Maroons fled southward to freedom. Hunting and gathering rights belong to clan members collectively. Within the clan, temporary rights to land use for farming are negotiated by village headmen. The establishment of transmigration villages in the 1960s led to land shortages in certain regions. The success of the Saramakas in their lawsuit against the government of Suriname will now permit them to manage their lands with less outside interference. Complex marriage prohibitions (including bee exogamy) and preferences are negotiated through divination. Demographic imbalance, owing to labor migration, permits widespread polygyny. Although co- wives hold equal status, relations between them are expected to be adversarial. The Saramaka treat marriage as an ongoing courtship, with frequent exchanges of gifts such as men's woodcarving and women's decorative sewing. Although many women live primarily in their husband's village, men never spend more than a few days at a time in the matrilineal (home) village of a wife. Each house belongs to an individual man or woman, but most social interaction occurs outdoors. The men in each cluster of several houses, whether bee members or temporary visitors, eat meals together. The women of these same clusters, whether bee members or resident wives of bee men, spend a great deal of time in each other's company, often farming together as well. Matrilineal principles, mediated by divination, determine the inheritance of material and spiritual possessions as well as political offices. Before death, however, men often pass on specialized ritual knowledge (and occasionally a shotgun) to a son. Each child, after spending its first several years with its mother, is raised by an individual man or woman (not a couple) designated by the bee, girls typically are raised by women, and boys by men. Although children spend most of their time with matrilineal kin, father-child relations are warm and strong. Gender identity is established early, with children taking on responsibility for gender-typed adult tasks as soon as they are physically able. Girls often marry by age 15, whereas boys are more often in their twenties when they take their first wife. A woman is required to go into seclusion during her menstrual cycle. The cycle is considered a time of transgression and destructive of village order. Women are not allowed to perform many of the village's functions and face other restrictions during their menstrual cycle. The Saramaka expression \\"to be in menstrual seclusion\\" is the same as \\"to be in mourning.\\"  Political organization and social control  The Saramaka people, like the other Maroon groups, are politically and formally run by men. The 2007 ruling of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights helps define the spheres of influence in which the national government and Saramaka authorities hold sway. Saramaka society is egalitarian, with kinship forming the backbone of social organization. No social or occupational classes are distinguished. Elders are accorded special respect and ancestors are consulted, through divination, on a daily basis. Protestant missionary schools have existed in some villages since the 18th century. State elementary schools came to most villages only in the 1960s. Schools ceased to function completely during the Suriname civil war of the late 1980s and have been rebuilt only partially since. Since the 18th-century treaty, the Saramaka have had a government-approved paramount chief (gaamá), as well as a series of headmen (kabiteni) and assistant headmen (basiá). Traditionally, the role of these officials in political and social control was exercised in a context replete with oracles, spirit possession, and other forms of divination. As the national government is intervening more frequently in Saramaka affairs (and paying political officials nominal salaries), the sacred base of these officials’ power is gradually being eroded. These political offices are historically controlled and the property of clans (lo). Political activity is strongly dominated by men. Council meetings (kuútu) and divination sessions provide complementary arenas for the resolution of social problems. Palavers may involve the men of a lineage, a village, or all Saramaka. They treat problems ranging from conflicts concerning marriage or fosterage to land disputes, political succession, or major crimes. These same problems, in addition to illness and other kinds of misfortune, are routinely interpreted through various kinds of divination as well. In all cases, consensus is found through negotiation, often with a strong role being played by gods and ancestors. In a type of reconciliation justice, guilty parties are usually required to pay for their misdeeds with material offerings to the lineage of the offended person. In the 18th century people found guilty of witchcraft were sometimes burned at the stake. Today, men caught in flagrante delicto with the wife of another man are either beaten by the woman's kinsmen or made to pay them a fine. Aside from adultery disputes, which sometimes mobilize a full canoe-load of men seeking revenge in a public fistfight, intra-Saramaka conflict rarely surpasses the level of personal relations. The civil war that began in 1986, pitting Maroons against the national army of Suriname, brought major changes to the villages of the interior. Members of the \\"Jungle Commando\\" rebel army, almost all Ndyuka and Saramaka, learned to use automatic weapons. They became accustomed to a state of war and plunder. Their reintegration into Saramaka (and Ndyuka) society has been difficult, though their migration to the coast and French Guiana has provided a safety valve, if not for the receiving areas.  Belief system  Every aspect of Saramaka life is based in various religious beliefs.Richard Price, Travels with Tooy: History, Memory, and the African American Imagination, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 2008. Such decisions as where to clear a garden or build a house, whether to undertake a trip, or how to deal with theft or adultery are made in consultation with village deities, ancestors, forest spirits, and snake gods. The means of communication with these powers vary from spirit possession and the consultation of oracle-bundles, to the interpretation of dreams. Gods and spirits, which are a constant presence in daily life, are also honored through frequent prayers, libations, feasts, and dances. The rituals surrounding birth, death, and other life passages are extensive, as are those relating to more mundane activities, from hunting a tapir to planting a rice field. Today about 25 per cent of Saramaka are nominal Christians – mainly Moravian (some since the mid-18th century), but others Roman Catholic. Increasingly some are converted to Evangelicalism of one or another kind. The Saramaka world is populated by a wide range of supernatural beings, from localized forest spirits and gods that reside in the bodies of snakes, vultures, jaguars, and other animals, to ancestors, river gods, and warrior spirits. Within these categories, each supernatural being is named, individualized, and given specific relationships to living people. Intimately involved in the ongoing events of daily life, these beings communicate to humans mainly through divination and spirit possession. Kúnus are the avenging spirits of people or gods who were wronged during their lifetime and who pledge themselves to eternally tormenting the matrilineal descendants and close matrilineal kinsmen of their offender. Much of Saramaka ritual life is devoted to their appeasement. The Saramaka believe that all evil originates in human action; not only does each misfortune, illness, or death stem from a specific past misdeed, but every offense, whether against people or gods, has eventual consequences. The ignoble acts of the dead intrude daily on the lives of the living; any illness or misfortune calls for divination, which quickly reveals the specific past act that caused it. Through the performance of rites, the ancestors speak, the gods dance, and the world is again made right. Individual specialists who supervise rites oversee the major village- and clan-owned shrines that serve large numbers of clients, as well as the various categories of possession gods, and various kinds of minor divination. These specialists generally pass on their knowledge to selected individuals before death. A large proportion of Saramaka have some kind of specialized ritual expertise, which they occasionally exercise. They are paid in cloth, rum, or, increasingly, cash. Saramaka ceremonial life is not determined by the calendar, but rather regulated by the occurrence of particular misfortunes, interpreted through divination. The most important ceremonies include those surrounding funerals and the appeasement of ancestors, public curing rites, rituals in honor of kúnus (in particular snake gods and forest spirits), and the installation of political officials. Every case of illness is believed to have a specific cause that can be determined only through divination. The causes revealed vary from a lineage kúnu to sorcery, from a broken taboo to an ancestor's displeasure. Once the cause is known, rites are carried out to appease the offended god or ancestor (or otherwise right the social imbalance). Since the 1960s, Western mission clinics and hospitals have been used by most Saramaka as a supplement to their own healing practices. During the Suriname Civil War of the 1980s and 1990s, most of these facilities were destroyed. They have only been very partially restored since. The dead play an active role in the lives of the living. Ancestor shrines – several to a village – are the site of frequent prayers and libations, as the dead are consulted about ongoing village problems. A death occasions a series of complex rituals that lasts about a year, culminating in the final passage of the deceased to the status of ancestor. The initial rites, which are carried out over a period of one week to three months, depending on the importance of the deceased, end with the burial of the corpse in an elaborately constructed coffin filled with personal belongings. These rites include divination with the coffin (to consult the spirit of the deceased) by carrying it on the heads of two men, feasts for the ancestors, all-night drum/song/dance performances, and the telling of folktales. Some months later, a \\"second funeral\\" is conducted to mark the end of the mourning period and to chase the ghost of the deceased from the village forever. These rites involve the largest public gatherings in Saramaka and also include all-night drum/song/dance performances. At their conclusion, the deceased has passed out of the realm of the living into that of the ancestors.  Isolation  The Saramaka people beyond Gaan Lio lived in relative isolation and as an uncontacted people group from the time of their ancestor's escape from slavery in the eighteenth century. In the latter part of 1993, a local, independent missionary by the name of Steve Groseclose and a small group of Saramaka men from other less remote villages ventured beyond the main barrier point called Tapa Wata Sula, translated as Shut Off Rapids. This initial excursion led to subsequent trips and began the gradual influx of increasing outside influence throughout the following years. A local Saramaka man named Pompeia had left one of the uncontacted villages to visit the capital city of Paramaribo earlier that year. His knowledge of the villages beyond Tapa Wata Sula made him an invaluable guide on the first trips into the area.  Ethnographic studies  Ethnography among the Saramaka was first conducted by Americans Melville and Frances Herskovits (during two summers in 1928 and 1929). Americans Richard and Sally Price have also studied the people (intermittently between 1966 and the present: in Suriname until 1986, and in French Guiana thereafter). This late-20th century fieldwork complements the modern fieldwork carried out among other groups of Suriname Maroons, such as the Ndyuka ethnography of Dutch scholars Bonno Thoden van Velzen and his partner Ineke van Wetering. Edward C. Green, an American medical anthropologist, conducted fieldwork among the Matawais between 1970–73, with intermittent visits since. His doctoral dissertation focused on changes underway then in the matrilineal kinship and indigenous spiritual belief systems. He has become known for his work on processes related to AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases, especially in African nations, and making use of indigenous healers.

It has the slide mechanism of a standard trombone and the valve mechanism of a valve trombone. Larry Ramirez of the Holton instrument company built the model TR 395 Superbone in the 1970s in collaboration with Maynard Ferguson.http://www.instrumentpro.com/P-HOLTR395.html Similar trombones combining valves and a slide were mass-produced in the early 20th century, some by C.G. Conn. The best-known of these was the valide trombone—the name is a portmanteau of 'valve' and 'slide'—invented by jazz trombonist and reed player Brad Gowans. (Google Books) Gowans played one from the 1920s through the 1950s, including with Jimmy Dorsey. The Superbone has a different design, including a slide that locks. It became a staple for Ferguson and Don Ellis. A Superbone has three pieces: bell, slide and valve unit. The valide trombone has only a bell and a valve/slide unit which does not lock. Ferguson used the Superbone on the recording \\"Superbone Meets the Bad Man\\" from the Chameleon album. Ashley Alexander's recording \\"Spring Can Really Hang You up the Most\\", on his Secret Love album, demonstrates the instrument's flexibility. Alexander played a Superbone (Alexander referred to the horn as a 'double trombone') and authored the most comprehensive manual on the instrument \\"The Double Trombone,\\" published by G. Leblanc Corporation c.1980. The Superbone has a fully functioning tenor trombone slide with 7 positions. It also has three valves placed just before the slide, with the valves arranged in the same manner as on other three-valved instruments. The player grips the valve section with the left hand, which supports the weight of the instrument while the right arm operates the slide.  Superbone technique  The Superbone can be played as a slide trombone, a valve trombone, or in combination. Extending the slide in order to transpose pitches downward causes tuning problems with the valves. Using the valves in this manner requires slide positions to be adjusted, just as when using the trigger of an F-trigger or bass trombone. Alternative slide positions are available when valves are depressed. See also *Firebird, a trumpet with both valves and slide.

The star is located fairly close to the Solar System: according to astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos astrometry satellite, it exhibits a parallax of 71.11 milliarcseconds, corresponding to a distance of 45.913 light-years. With an apparent magnitude of +5.03, it is visible to the naked eye and its absolute magnitude of +4.29 implies a visual luminosity around 60% greater than the Sun. A solar analog, with a spectral type of G1V, it has a similar mass to that of the Sun but is slightly hotter at around 5,882 K. and slightly more metal-rich with around 110% of the solar abundance of iron. Like the Sun, 47 Ursae Majoris is on the main sequence, converting hydrogen to helium in its core by nuclear fusion. Based on its chromospheric activity, the star may be around 6,000 million years old, though evolutionary models suggest an older age of around 8,700 million years. Other studies have yielded estimates of 4,400 and 7,000 million years for the star.  Nomenclature  47 Ursae Majoris is the Flamsteed designation. On their discoveries the planets were successively designated 47 Ursae Majoris b, c and d. In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning names were Chalawan for this star and Taphao Thong and Taphao Kaew for two of the planets (b and c, respectively).Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The winning names were submitted by the Thai Astronomical Society, Thailand. Chalawan ( ) is a mythological crocodile king from the Thai folktale Krai Thong and Taphaothong and Taphaokaeo are two sisters associated with the tale.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names ('Chalawan' is also the name given to an extinct genus of crocodylian. It contains a single species, Chalawan thailandicus.) In 2016, the IAU organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. In its first bulletin of July 2016, the WGSN explicitly recognized the names of exoplanets and their host stars approved by the Executive Committee Working Group Public Naming of Planets and Planetary Satellites, including the names of stars adopted during the 2015 NameExoWorlds campaign. This star is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names.  Planetary system  In 1996 an exoplanet (47 UMa b) was announced in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding to changes in the star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If it were to be located in the Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. Orbits of the planets in the 47 Ursae Majoris system. The orbit of 47 UMa d is currently quite uncertain; both it and that of 47 UMa c may be circular. In 2001, preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos probe suggested the orbit of 47 UMa b is inclined at an angle of 63.1° to the plane of the sky, implying the planet's true mass is around 2.9 times that of Jupiter. However, subsequent analysis suggested the Hipparcos measurements were not precise enough to accurately determine the orbits of substellar companions, and the inclination and true mass remain unknown. A second planet (47 UMa c) was announced in 2002 by Debra Fischer, Geoffrey Marcy, and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made using the same radial velocity method. According to Fischer et al., the planet takes around 2,391 days or 6.55 years to complete an orbit. This configuration is similar to the configuration of Jupiter and Saturn in the Solar System, with the orbital ratio (close to 5:2), and mass ratio roughly similar. Subsequent measurements failed to confirm the existence of the second planet, and it was noted that the dataset used to determine its existence left the planet's parameters \\"almost unconstrained\\". Analysis of a longer dataset spanning over 6,900 days suggests that while a second planet in the system is likely, periods near 2,500 days have a high false alarm probability, and the best fit model gives an orbital period of 7,586 days at a distance of 7.73 AU from the star. Nevertheless, the parameters of the second planet are still highly uncertain. On the other hand, the Catalog of Nearby Exoplanets gives a period of 2,190 days, which would put the planets close to a 2:1 ratio of orbital periods, though the reference for these parameters is uncertain: the original Fischer et al. paper is cited as a reference in spite of the fact that it gives different parameters, though this solution has been adopted by the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. In 2010, the discovery of a third planet (47 UMa d) was made by using the Bayesian Kepler Periodogram. Using this model of this planetary system it was determined that it is 100,000 times more likely to have three planets than two planets. This discovery was announced by Debra Fischer and P.C. Gregory. This planet has an orbital period of 14,002 days or 38.33 years and a semi-major axis of 11.6 AU with a moderate eccentricity of 0.16. It would be the longest- period planet discovered by the radial velocity method, although longer-period planets had previously been discovered by direct imaging and pulsar timing. Simulations suggest that the inner part of the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris could host a terrestrial planet in a stable orbit, though the outer regions of the habitable zone would be disrupted by the gravitational influence of the planet 47 UMa b. However, the presence of a giant planet within 2.5 AU of the star may have disrupted planet formation in the inner system, and reduced the amount of water delivered to inner planets during accretion. This may mean any terrestrial planets orbiting in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry. , there have been two METI messages sent to 47 Ursae Majoris. Both were transmitted from Eurasia's largest radar — 70-meter (230-foot) Eupatoria Planetary Radar. The first message, the Teen Age Message, was sent on September 3, 2001, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in July 2047. The second message, Cosmic Call 2, was sent on July 6, 2003, and it will arrive at 47 Ursae Majoris in May 2049. Because of its planetary system, 47 Ursae Majoris was listed as one of the top 100 target stars for NASA's former Terrestrial Planet Finder mission.

The main industries are transportation and logistics, shipbuilding, petrochemicals and other heavy industries, and oil palm storage and distribution, which is located in Johor Port and Tanjung Langsat. History Established in 1918, Pasir Gudang, which was formerly known as Kampung Pasir Udang, was founded by Long Abu who is believed to have originated from Riau, Indonesia. Four more villages were established by the expanded population of about 83 families. *Kampung Pasir Gudang Baru. (known as Kampung Pasir Gudang Lama located at TNB Sultan Iskandar Power Station) *Kampung Sungai Perembi. (currently the Pasir Gudang Police Station) *Kampung Ulu (currently MSE dockyard) *Kampung Tengah (currently the Tenaga Nasional area) *Kampung Hilir. In 1920, 4 more villages were established : *Kampung Air Biru (now the port). *Kampung Pasir Merah (now the port). *Kampung Pasir Puteh, which is still in existence today. *Kampung Pulau Tekong, now the territory of Singapore. The name Pasir Gudang originated from the existence of a sand mine at Kampung Ulu. Sand or 'pasir' in Malay are dug and stocked in sand pits/stores or 'gudang' in Malay, to be exported to Singapore, hence the name 'Pasir Gudang'. The surrounding areas further inland were developed in the mid-19th century by Chinese travellers of the Teochew clan. Issuance of the 'river deed' by the Sultan of Johore allowed them to develop the Kangkar Masai, Kangkar Plentong and Kangkar Lunchu areas under riverheads known as 'kangchus'. It was on these riverbeds that they cultivated catechu and black pepper. Falling catechu and black pepper prices forced some estate owners to cultivate pineapples. The introduction of rubber into Malaysia in the early 20th century resulted in the opening of big estates by the British and Singaporean cultivators. Up till 1916, six estates covering an area of 15,000 acres (61 km²) were opened in the Mukim of Plentong. In 1916, Kampung Pasir Gudang became the centre for Police, Customs and opium-control besides being a centre for the 'penghulu' of the Mukim of Pasir Gudang. The formation of estates had also resulted in influx of labourers from China and India. The Japanese occupation during the Second World War and guerrilla movements after the war did not have much effect on the agricultural activities here. Under the Emergency Law in the 1950s, new villages were set up at Plentong, Masai, Johor and Pasir Gudang. The estate labourers were either placed in these new villages or at guarded estate barracks. Land schemes under the FELDA scheme were founded in Ban Foo, Plentong Baru and Felda Cahaya Baru after 1969. To further develop Johor, the State Government further took the estate lands to be converted into industrial and housing areas to the develop Pasir Gudang into an industrial area. Establishment of the Johore Port in 1977 was seen as a reaction to counter the entrepôt hub in Singapore. Government Pasir Gudang Municipal Council Pasir Gudang is administered by the Pasir Gudang Local Authority, or Pihak Berkuasa Tempatan Pasir Gudang, a subsidiary of Johor Corporation. It is the first local authority in Malaysia that was privatised, although Johor Corporation is the investment arm of the Johor State Government. On 1 July 2008, this agency was granted municipal status and changed its name to Pasir Gudang Municipal Council. At 2015, the administration zone of Pasir Gudang Municipal Council was increase from 29,459.9ha to 31,732.24ha following the re-delineation exercise. This brought Masai and Bandar Seri Alam become a part of Pasir Gudang. Education Pasir Gudang Community College The Politeknik Ibrahim Sultan (PIS), Pasir Gudang Community College, Institut Latihan Perindustrian Pasir Gudang and Johor Skills Development Centre (PUSPATRI) are the major higher institutes located at Pasir Gudang. Not only that, the “City of Knowledge”－Bandar Seri Alam houses a number of higher institutions including Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) campus, Universiti Kuala Lumpur (UniKL) campus, the Masterskill University College of Health Sciences campus and other international schools. The Foon Yew High School second branch (Bandar Seri Alam Campus) and the Lee Chong Wei Badminton Academy are still construction. Infrastructures =Energy= It is the site of one of two major power stations in the state of Johor, the Sultan Iskandar Power Station. =Healthcare= There are 3 hospital in the area which is KPJ Pasir Gudang Specialist Hospital, Hospital Penawar Pasir Gudang and Regency Specialist Hospital. Tourist attraction Kite Hill Pasir Gudang Kite Museum is located here, on top of Kite Hill. It is the first kite museum in Malaysia and has a unique working windmill whose mechanism works to generate enough electricity to supply the daily needs of the museum. It also hosts the annual Pasir Gudang International Kite Festival since 1995. Sports Pasir Gudang Corporation Stadium Pasir Gudang Corporation Stadium is a multi-use stadium and it has both an indoor stadium within its compound. The outdoor stadium can hold a maximum of 15,000 people and is currently used mostly for football matches, serving as the home stadium to Johor in the Malaysia Premier League, President Cup, Malaysia and Harimau Muda B in the S. League. The 3.86 km Johor Racing Circuit is located here, which formerly hosted one of the legs of the World Motorcycle Championship, being one of only two legs held in Asia. Pasir Gudang has one golf course, the Tanjung Puteri Golf Resort. It has an area of 8.3 km² and 3 courses named Plantation, Village and Straits. Transportation Pasir Gudang Bus and Taxi Terminal =Sea= The town consists of two ports, which are Tanjung Langsat Port and Johor Port. Johor Port is one of the country's most important seaports for commodities and mineral resources shipping, as Johor is home to a large number of major commercial plantations. The port is also the location of the majority of Malaysia's resources refineries. The Pasir Gudang Ferry Terminal is also located in Pasir Gudang and has passenger ferry services to Batam in the Riau Islands Province of Indonesia. =Road= Pasir Gudang is connected by the 4 lane Pasir Gudang Highway, a trunk road, and a railway line to Kempas Bahru railway station. The Senai-Desaru Expressway also through here and the interchange was at Cahaya Baru and Pasir Gudang Highway. The public bus service also available here.

The film, which is based on a 1959 play with the same name, by Willis Hall, takes place in 1942 during the Malayan Campaign. The title comes from the second line of the First World War song \\"Bless 'Em All\\", which became very popular during the Second World War following recordings from singers such as Vera Lynn  Plot  During the Japanese invasion of Burma in 1942, a seven-strong British sonic deception unit on a short jungle exercise hides from the rain in a hut at an abandoned tin mine. The men constantly bicker, often provoked by the bullying Corporal Johnstone or the forever mocking Bamforth. While Sergeant Mitchem and Corporal Johnstone are reconnoitering, Lance-Corporal Macleish (\\"Mac\\"), provoked, beats up Bamforth. Tension rises as they fail to make radio contact with their base and pick up a Japanese broadcast, indicating that they are nearby. A Japanese scout appears: Johnstone grabs him and tells Taff to stab him. Taff cannot kill him in cold blood and, before Bamforth does, the returning Mitchem says they must take him back for interrogation. Mitchem places Bamforth in charge of the prisoner, who Bamforth names Tojo. Bamforth realises Tojo is just another soldier, bonding over pictures of Tojo's family. Johnstone, enraged, tries to destroy the pictures but Bamforth, his frustrations boiling over, beats him up, risking a court martial. Mitchem sends Mac and Smudge to reconnoiter. They see a small patrol sending two soldiers to find Tojo. Knowing this endangers their patrol, Mac kills one but the other escapes. Mac and Smudge return to warn the patrol which tries to radio base to warn them, even though it may reveal their position. A taunting Japanese broadcast accelerates their decision to flee for their base. They head for home. Mitchem now realises that the prisoner is a liability rather than as asset and Johnstone keeps offering to kill him. The group, temporararily blocked by a flash flood, take a break in the mine canyons and Bamforth is sent to keep watch. Johnstone spots Mac and Tojo enjoying a cigarette and cruelly points out that they are British and Tojo must have stolen them from a British soldier he had killed. This affects the men who turn on Tojo. Johnstone rips up his cherished family photos and Mac searches and slaps him. Upon hearing the commotion, Bamforth returns and explains he gave Tojo the cigarettes. The men are ashamed and try to make amends by gathering and returning Tojo's possessions. Johnstone maliciously says that Tojo's cigarette case was made in Birmingham. As the men again grow hostile, Bamford responds that Tojo could have traded for it, forcing the youngest member (Whittaker) to admit that he does this. The flood is receding and Mitchem asks Whittaker to make a last attempt to contact base before they leave. They plan to abandon the mules, blow up the special equipment and kill the prisoner. Bamforth protests at this and appeals for support from the other men without success. The radio responds to Whittaker's efforts but only a Japanese message can be heard. Tojo approaches him, trying in Japanese to explain the message. Panicking about the Japanese broadcast and ashamed from his unveiling as a looter, Whittaker mistakes Tojo's movements and shoots him dead. The radio crackles into life again and a Japanese accented English announces that the patrol is surrounded and demands their surrender. Whittaker's firing will have further alerted the Japanese. Mitchem with Bamforth forms a rear guard to allow the others led by Johnstone to escape. The rear guard are soon defending against the main Japanese force. As the main group emerge, a Japanese sniper dispatches Taff and Mac. Although Whittaker is cut off, Johnstone tells Smudge they must return to Mitchem. As they flee, Smudge is also killed. Mitchem is shocked to see the superficially injured Johnstone back alone but is shot by a sniper. As the Japanese close in, Johnstone implores Bamforth to surrender. Bamforth however shoots at the explosives. The explosion kills many attackers but also causes a rockfall, killing Bamforth. Johnstone strides forward and, taking a white scarf from a dead Japanese soldier, surrenders. Whittaker is also taken by the Japanese and is shouted at and mocked just as the British treated Tojo.

The film was shot at Elstree Studios in 1960, where Richard Todd had starred in The Dam Busters a few years earlier. Todd loathed making this film, as he didn't get along with Laurence Harvey, In an interview many years later, he said, \\"I didn't enjoy working with Laurence Harvey... I took it for granted that they would cast Peter O'Toole, who was marvellous on stage, but they said they wanted a 'name'\\".The Independent, 5 December 2009, obituaries: Richard Todd: D-Day veteran and actor celebrated for his role as Guy Gibson in 'The Dam Busters' Linked 2013-08-15 Richard Harris later claimed Todd would stand on top of mounds of dirt to seem as tall as his co-stars. Leslie Norman was also unhappy he had to cast Laurence Harvey instead of Peter O'Toole. He felt Laurence Harvey and Richard Harris \\"let the film down... Harris because he resented Laurence Harvey, despised him and they didn't get on with Richard Todd\\". Norman says \\"I was very pleased with my side of the film in the end.

The Viking revival was a movement reflecting new interest in, and appreciation for Viking medieval history and culture. Interest was reawakened in the late 18th and 19th centuries, often with added heroic overtones typical of that Romantic era. The revival began earlier with historical discoveries and early modern publications dealing with Old Norse culture. The first printed edition of the 13th century Gesta Danorum or the Legend of the Danes by Saxo Grammaticus, came out in 1514 just as book printing began become more practical and printing trade was quickly spreading. In 1555, the Historia de gentibus septentrionalibus, or \\"History of the northern peoples\\", by Olaus Magnus was produced. The pace of publication increased during the 17th century with Latin translations of the famous Edda, notably Peder Resen's Edda Islandorum of 1665. The Edda consisted of two 13th century Medieval Icelandic literary works on Norse mythology, written down in the 13th century, but certainly from older oral sources: they are the Prose Edda, and an older collection of poems without an original title now known as the Poetic Edda. (The term historically referred only to the Prose Edda, but this since has fallen out of use because of the confusion with the other work.) The books are the main sources of medieval skaldic tradition of poetry and storytelling in Iceland and Norse mythology. The word Viking is not medieval term; it was only introduced into Modern English during the 18th century. At that point in the Romantic Era, Viking exploits were aggregated, and tended to be falsely subsumed under a single category and subsequently romanticized as heroic adventure. Etymologists frequently trace the word \\"Viking\\" to writers who are referring to those who set about to raid and pillage. The word Viking in the sense in which it is commonly used is derived from the Old Norse víkingr signifying a sea-rover or pirate.The Syntax of Old Norse by Jan Terje Faarlund (Oxford University Press: 2004)The Principles of English Etymology by Walter W. Skeat (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1887) Thus, our understanding of \\"Viking\\" history is shaped by the views of the people of the Romantic era, who studied and wrote about \\"the Vikings\\", as seen from their point of view. Norway The rediscovery of the Viking past began in Norway during the 19th century when Norway saw a rise in nationalism. Having been in a personal union with Denmark under the Danish king for 400 years and subsequently in the union between Sweden and Norway under the Swedish king, Norwegians started looking back to their Viking era kings and sagas. In 1867, the first Viking ship to be unearthed, the Tune ship, was excavated in Østfold, Norway. The ship provided new knowledge about the Vikings and their culture. The excavation of other ships and artifacts led to a higher consciousness about the Viking past in Norway. For example, the only complete Viking helmet, the Gjermundbu helmet, ever to be found was also excavated in Buskerud, Norway. Denmark Danish antiquarian Carl Christian Rafn was noted for his early advocacy of the theory that the Vikings had explored North America centuries before Christopher Columbus's and John Cabot's voyages. Rafn published much of his work in 1837 in the Antiquitates Americanæ, considered the first scholarly exposition of the Old Norse exploration period.Rafn, Carl Christian (Dansk biografisk Lexikon) Sweden The term Viking was popularized with positive connotations by Erik Gustaf Geijer at the beginning of the 19th century. His poem The Viking (Vikingen) appeared in the first issue of the Swedish periodical, Iduna. The word Viking was taken to refer to romanticized, heroic, idealized Norse seafarers and warriors. This renewed interest of the Romanticism of a historic past had political implications. The Geatish Society, of which Geijer was a member, popularized this ideal to a great extent. Another author who had great influence on the perception of the Vikings was Esaias Tegnér, another member of the Geatish Society who wrote a modern version of Frithiofs Saga, which became widely popular in the Nordic countries, England, the United States, and Germany. Germany The German composer Richard Wagner is said to have strong influences of the Nordic mythology in his musical pieces. His Nordic influences further enhanced the Romanticism of the Viking era during that time. Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen, commonly referred to as the Ring cycle, is a set of four operas based loosely on figures and elements of Germanic mythology—particularly from the later Norse mythology—notably the Old Norse Poetic Edda and Volsunga Saga, and the epic poem Nibelungenlied.Opera and Drama by Richard Wagner (The Wagner Library. translated by William Ashton Ellis) Britain English authors from the 16th century had been aware of the Viking impact on the countryside, though the numerous placenames of Danes CampThe Iron Age hill fort of Berry Mound in Worcestershire, for example, was previously known as Danes camp field and Danes bury field. is better explained as a modification of dene, or hollow.Richard Hall, Viking Archaeology (series Shire Archaeology), 2010:7. Following the 17th-century first flowering of Anglo-Saxon studies, there was a similar wave of enthusiasm for Northern culture in Britain, identifying as Viking remains Iron Age hill forts and even Stonehenge and exemplified by the antiquarian interests of George Hickes, who published a Linguarum veterum septentrionalium thesaurus grammatico-criticus et archæologicus\\"Grammatical-critical and archaeological thesaurus of the old northern tongues\\" in 1703–05. In the 1780s, Denmark offered to cede Iceland to Britain in exchange for Crab Island (now Vieques, Puerto Rico), and in the 1860s Iceland was considered for compensation for the British support of Denmark in the Schleswig-Holstein conflicts.The Vikings and the Victorians: Inventing the Old North in 19th Century Britain by Andrew Wawn (D.S. Brewers: 2000) During this time, British interest and enthusiasm for Iceland and Nordic culture grew dramatically, expressed in original English poems extolling Viking virtues, such as Thomas Warton's \\"Runic Odes\\" of 1748: :Yes – 'tis decreed my Sword no more :Shall smoke and blush with hostile gore :To my great Father's Feasts I go, :Where luscious Wines for ever flow. :Which from the hollow ScullsSkull cups are widely reported: see Vikings#Use of skulls as drinking vessels. we drain :Of Kings in furious Combat slain. United States Rasmus B. Anderson, the founding head of the Department of Scandinavian Studies at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, also founded a publication company, The Norrœna Society, which focused on republishing translations of texts devoted to the history and romance of Northern Europe. Anderson was the author of a number of books with Scandinavian themes. He brought to the American popular attention the idea that Viking explorers discovered the New World and was the originator of Leif Erikson Day.Rasmus B.

Stained glass window in the priory church History The Priory was founded by Stephen la Leye on a site to the south of the present church between 1147 and 1151 in the reign of Henry II. In 1253 the Augustinians were granted a licence to dig the Norwell, which still exists north of the present church, to supply water to the priory. In 1537 after the Dissolution of the Monasteries the Crown granted the priory and its estates to Sir Francis Bryan, a close ally of Henry VIII. Bryan held the estate for only about a year before selling it in 1538 to Sir John Cope, a wealthy Banbury lawyer. Sir John's daughter Elizabeth inherited what is thought to have been the priory farmhouse [wrong – Wilkyns farm was part of John Dryden's inheritance. Copes Ashbie – across the road – was inherited by Elizabeth's brother, who died early leaving his sons as Wards of the Dryden family] . In 1551 she married John Dryden, who extended the building to form the earliest parts of Canons Ashby House. Part of the building survives: the Church of England parish church of St Mary dates from about 1250 and this, together with Canons Ashby House, is now owned by the National Trust. Its power and size can be judged by its outlying buildings which cover a large area of the surrounding countryside. The remains of the priory's hospitalium survive as the monastic building centred on the parish church of Maidford, about away.

A common use is heat dissipation, in which the TIM is inserted between a heat-producing device (e.g. an integrated circuit) and a heat- dissipating device (e.g. a heat sink). There are several kind of TIM with different target applications: *Thermal paste: Mostly used in the electronics industry, it provides a very thin bond line and therefore a very small thermal resistance. It has no mechanical strength (other than the surface tension of the paste and the resulting adhesive effect) and will need an external mechanical fixation mechanism. Because it does not cure, it is used only where the material can be contained or in thin application where the viscosity of the paste will allow it to stay in position during use. *Thermal adhesive: As with the thermal paste, it provides a very thin bond line, but provides some additional mechanical strength to the bond after curing. Thermal glue allows thicker bond line than the thermal paste, as it cures. *Thermal gap filler: It could be described as \\"curing thermal paste\\" or \\"non-adhesive thermal glue\\". It provides thicker bond lines than the thermal paste as it cures while still allowing an easy disassembly thanks to limited adhesiveness. *Thermally conductive pad: As opposed to previous TIM, a thermal pad does not come in liquid or paste form, but in a solid state (albeit often soft). Mostly made of silicone or silicone-like material, it has the advantage to be easy to apply. It provides thicker bond lines, but will usually need higher force to press the heat sink on the heat source so that the thermal pad conforms to the bonded surfaces. *Thermal tape: It adheres to surface, requires no curing time and is easy to apply. It is essentially a thermal pad with adhesive properties. *Phase-change materials (PCM): Naturally sticky materials, used in place of thermal pastes. Its application is similar to solid pads. After achieving a melting point of - 55-60 degrees, it changes to a half liquid status and fills all gaps between the heat source and the heat sink. *Metal thermal interface materials (metal TIMs): Metallic materials offer substantially higher thermal conductivity as well as the lowest thermal interface resistance. This high conductivity translates to less sensitivity to bondline thicknesses and coplanarity issues than polymeric TIMs. (Full Metal TIMs, authored by Robert N. Jarrtett, Jordan P. Ross, and Ross Berntson, published in Power Systems Design Europe, September 2007) See also *Heat sink *Heat spreader Computer hardware cooling Heat exchangers Heat transfer Materials science ","title":"Thermal interface material"},{"id":"1197777","text":"This list includes any stately home, historic house, museum or other property in the care of the autonomous state and territory branches of the National Trust of Australia.

Transportation across the Straits Kanmonkyo Bridge from the Moji side The Kanmon Straits can be crossed in a number of ways, the oldest of which are the ferries. There is a car ferry between Nishiminato (Kokura) and Hikinoshima (Shimonoseki) which takes about ten minutes, and a passenger ferry from Moji-ko to Shimonoseki (Karato wharf). There is also a bridge which carries an expressway. By far the most used method is a number of Kanmon Tunnels which carry the Sanyō Shinkansen, trains, cars, and even one for pedestrians at the narrowest point. The first railway tunnel was opened on November 15, 1942. The highway tunnel was opened on March 9, 1958. The Kanmonkyo Bridge (see photo) was opened to vehicles on November 14, 1973.

Biography Born in Canning Town, London, Dennis Stratton showed early promise as a footballer and was briefly on the books at West Ham United until age 16, when he took up guitar. A keen fan of the London East End music scene, he joined his first band Harvest (later known as Wedgewood) in 1973. Two years later, Stratton formed the band Remus Down Boulevard, which toured in support of Rory Gallagher and Status Quo, and recorded a live album with music producer Jonathan King. In December 1979, Steve Harris invited Stratton to join Iron Maiden after witnessing a Remus Down Boulevard performance. The band was also in need of a new drummer, and recruited Clive Burr on Stratton's recommendation. Stratton played on the group's first studio album, Iron Maiden, which was released in April 1980, and on the non-album single \\"Women in Uniform\\". Stratton also appeared in the home video recording \\"Live at the Ruskin\\" (recorded in 1980 and released in 2004 as part of The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days DVD set), and in the band's first British television appearance, when they performed \\"Running Free\\" on Top of the Pops. Stratton was with the band during their first European tour, supporting Kiss. Dennis Stratton left Iron Maiden in October 1980, and has stated that he left due to conflicts with Steve Harris and band manager Rod Smallwood. Officially, the band stated \\"musical differences\\" as the reason for Stratton's departure. He was replaced by Adrian Smith. After his departure from Iron Maiden, Stratton played with bands such as Lionheart and Praying Mantis, with which he recorded nine studio albums from 1990 to 2003. He officially left Praying Mantis in 2006. In 1995 he formed a project called The Original Iron Men with another former Iron Maiden member, singer Paul Di'Anno. The duo released three albums. More recently, Stratton still performs locally in the East London area, sometimes with a reformed version of Remus Down Boulevard, and occasionally tours Europe with various cover bands that play classic Iron Maiden songs. Stratton is endorsed by Caparison Guitars, from his tenure with Praying Mantis.

It is adjacent to the county boundary with Berkshire and about south-west of Reading. Silchester is most notable for the archaeological site and Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum, an Iron Age and later Atrebates Celtic settlement first occupied by the Romans in about AD 45, and which includes what is considered the best-preserved Roman wall in Great Britain and the remains of what might be one of the oldest Christian churches. Location The present village is centred on Silchester Common. It is about west of the Church of England parish church and former manor house (now Manor Farm), which are in the eastern part of the former Roman town. Local government Silchester is a civil parish with an elected parish council. Silchester parish is in the ward of Pamber and Silchester, part of Basingstoke and Deane District Council and of Hampshire County Council and all three councils are responsible for different aspects of local government. The ward returns two councillors to the borough council. The 2011 census recorded a parish population of 921. Transport Silchester Common is served (as of October 2017) by bus route 14 between Basingstoke, Chineham Shopping Centre, Bramley, Little London, Silchester Common and Tadley, operated by Stagecoach on Monday to Saturday. Manor Silcester was recorded in the 11th century, when one Alestan held a manor here with King Edward the Confessor as his overlord and one Cheping held another manor with Earl Harold Godwinson as his overlord.Page, 1911, pages 51–56 The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded that the Normans William De Ow and Ralph de Mortimer possessed Alestan's and Cheping's manors respectively. The book assessed Alestan's manor at five hides and Mortimer's at three hides. De Mortimer's tenant was another Norman, Ralph Bluet. In 1204 he or a later Ralph Bluet gave a palfrey horse in exchange for a licence to enclose an area of land south-east of the former Roman town as a deer park. Today parts of the earthwork park pale survive and parts of the former park remain wooded. Forms of the toponym included Ciltestere and Cilcestre in the 13th century, Scilchestre in the 14th century and Sylkchester in the 18th century before it reached its current spelling. The Irish peer Murrough Boyle, 1st Viscount Blesington (1685–1718) bought the manor in 1704 and it remained with his hereditary heirs until the death of William Stewart, 1st Earl of Blessington in 1769. In 1778 it was inherited jointly by Thomas Vesey, 1st Viscount de Vesci and Edward Pakenham, 2nd Baron Longford. In 1806 Baron Longford's daughter The Hon. Catherine Pakenham married Arthur Wellesley, who in 1814 was created Duke of Wellington. In 1821 Catherine's brother Thomas Pakenham, 2nd Earl of Longford was created Baron Silchester, but in 1828 he and John, 2nd Viscount de Vesci sold the manor of Silchester to the Duke. In the first decade of the 20th century Arthur Wellesley, 4th Duke of Wellington still owned the manor of Silchester. Church and chapel Parish church of St Mary the Virgin behind the Roman town wall The Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin is just within the walls of the former Roman town, possibly on the site of a Roman temple. The building may contain some re-used Roman materials.Aston & Bond, 1976, page 53 The building dates from the late 12th or early 13th century.Pevsner & Lloyd, 1967, page 505 It has a north and south aisle, each of two bays. There is no chancel arch, and the chancel is longer than the nave. The wall of the south aisle was rebuilt in about 1325–50, incorporating an ogee-arched tomb recess containing the effigy of a lady wearing a wimple. Two new windows were added to the church in the 14th century, and two more including the Perpendicular Gothic east window of the chancel in the 15th century. The church has a Perpendicular Gothic rood screen. The pulpit was made early in the 18th century but its tester is dated 1639. There is also a carved memorial cartouche to the Irish peer Viscount Ikerrin (died 1712). The bell-turret has a ring of five bells. Four were cast by John Stares of Aldbourne, Wiltshire in 1744. The other was cast by William Taylor of Oxford in 1848. There is a Primitive Methodist chapel on Silchester Common. Iron Age & Roman town Site plan Calleva Atrebatum was an Iron Age oppidum and subsequently a town in the Roman province of Britannia and the civitas capital of the Atrebates tribe. Its ruins are beneath and to the west of the parish church, which is itself just within the town wall and about to the east of the modern village. The site covers an area of over within a polygonal earthwork. The earthworks and extensive ruined walls are still visible. The remains of the amphitheatre,Silchester amphitheatre added about AD 70–80 and situated outside the city walls, can also be clearly seen. The area inside the walls is now largely farmland with no visible distinguishing features, other than the enclosing earthworks and walls, with the church and old manor house in one corner. The bronze Silchester eagle was discovered in the Basilica at Calleva in 1866. It can now be seen in Reading Museum. During excavations carried out in 1893, the Silchester Ogham stone was located. Dated c. 500 AD, it is one of very few found in England. It is now held in storage at Reading Museum. Calleva was finally abandoned in the 7th century, which is unusually late compared to other deserted Roman settlement.Roman colonies in Subroman Britain Amenities Silchester's sole public house is the Calleva Arms,Calleva Arms named after the former Roman town of Calleva Atrebatum that lies within the village boundary.

The star is slightly larger and more massive than the Sun, with an estimated age of seven billion years. It has two known extrasolar planets. Properties The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 7.42, making it too faint to be viewed by the naked eye even under ideal viewing conditions. However, it can be readily observed using a small telescope with an aperture of or more. Parallax measurements of HD 12661 place it at a distance of about from the Earth, with a margin of error of ±0.2 light years. It has a stellar classification of G6 V, indicating that it is a main sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 5,754 K, giving it the characteristic yellow hue of a G-type star. Based on stellar models, estimates of the radius of this star range from 107% to 112% times Sun's radius, while the mass is likely in the range from 107% to 110% of the Sun's mass. As a star ages it slows its rotation and diminishes the amount of magnetic activity in its chromosphere. Hence the measured emission from the chromosphere can be used to estimate the age of a star, particularly for F and G-type dwarf stars with an age of less than two billion years. However, this technique becomes less accurate for ages beyond about 5.6 billion years. Based upon the chromosphere emission of HD 12661, it is older than the Sun with an estimated age of roughly seven billion years. It has a low projected rotational velocity of 1.20 km/s, consistent with it being an older star. The age of a star can also be estimated by the abundance of lithium, as this element is destroyed through thermonuclear fusion at the core. However, this is less accurate technique. For HD 12661, the lithium abundance gives an age estimate of 4.4 billion years. The abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium, what astronomers term the metallicity, is unusually high in this star when compared to the Sun. High metallicity has been found to be statistically correlated with the presence of a multi-planet system around a star. It is possible that a planet in this system may have been scattered and ended up being accreted by the star, which may account for the large surface metallicity. Planetary system The first planet was discovered in 2001 from the Lick and Keck observatories using precision measurements of the star's radial velocity variations. The periodicity in this variation allowed astronomers to extract information about the planet's orbit and minimum mass. A second planet was discovered by the same team two years later. Both planets are greater in mass than Jupiter. The system is dynamically unstable. \\"Either this system is being observed during a relatively rare state, or additional planets are affecting the observed radial velocities and/or the system’s secular eccentricity evolution.\\" See also *List of extrasolar planets References External links  Extrasolar Planet Interactions by Rory Barnes & Richard Greenberg, Lunar and Planetary Lab, University of Arizona * Local Sky Map 009683 Aries (constellation) 012661 G-type main-sequence stars Planetary systems with two confirmed planets Durchmusterung objects ","title":"HD 12661"},{"id":"1197808","text":"Sleep-learning (also known as hypnopædia, or hypnopedia) is an attempt to convey information to a sleeping person, typically by playing a sound recording to them while they sleep. Although often used in pop culture as a way to introduce new information (see 'In Fiction'), sleep is considered an important period for memory consolidation. Although learning new information during sleep has not been considered possible, at least to the extent it is used in fiction, the term hypnopedia has also been used to refer to the technique of exposing someone to sounds or odors during sleep in attempts to boost memory for previously learned information. Hypnopedia, in this sense, is related to a technique now known as Targeted Memory Reactivation (TMR). Unlike the pop-culture idea of sleep-learning, or learning new information during sleep, TMR pairs newly acquired information with sounds that can later be played, or cued, during electroencephalography (EEG) verified sleep to strengthen memory. This type of sleep reactivation in humans has been found successful in strengthening memory in a number of different paradigms including language learning, motor-skill learning, and spatial memory. Research in TMR has shown that cueing sounds that are associated with previously learned material over a period of sleep is more beneficial to memory than a similar period of wake. Likewise, cued material is also better preserved than material that is not cued during sleep. History In 1927, Alois Benjamin Saliger invented the Psycho-Phone for sleep learning, stating that \\"It has been proven that natural sleep is identical with hypnotic sleep and that during natural sleep the unconscious mind is most receptive to suggestions.\\" Since the electroencephalography studies by Charles W. Simon and William H. Emmons in 1956, learning by sleep has not been taken seriously. The researchers concluded that learning during sleep was \\"impractical and probably impossible\\". They reported that stimulus material presented during sleep was not recalled later when the subject awoke unless alpha wave activity occurred at the same time the stimulus material was given. p. 78 Referring to Charles W. Simon and William H. Emmons EEG, Consciousness, and Sleep , Science, 1956, 124, 1066-1069. Page 125 The idea of reactivating memories in humans to improve memory began with the finding that neurons active in the hippocampus in rodents were found to fire together during subsequent sleep. In 2012, research from the Weizmann Institute of Science indicated that classical conditioning can occur during sleep by using odor recognition. \\"During sleep, humans can strengthen previously acquired memories, but whether they can acquire entirely new information remains unknown. The nonverbal nature of the olfactory sniff response, in which pleasant odors drive stronger sniffs and unpleasant odors drive weaker sniffs, allowed us to test learning in humans during sleep.\\" In fiction The idea of sleep-learning is found in influential science fiction and other literature. The following examples are listed chronologically by publication or original air date, when known. * In Hugo Gernsback's 1911 story Ralph 124C 41+, one finds the Hypnobioscope, a sleep learning device. * In Aldous Huxley's 1932 novel Brave New World, it is used for the conditioning of children into the novel's fictional future culture. In the novel, sleep-learning was discovered by accident when a Polish boy named Reuben Rabinovitch was able to recite an entire radio broadcast in English after a radio receiver was left on in his sleep. The boy was unable to comprehend what he had heard via hypnopædia, but it was soon realized that hypnopædia could be used to effectively make suggestions about morality. * In Robert Heinlein's 1948 novel Space Cadet, the character Matt Dodson is taught to speak Venutian (the language of the planet Venus) while under drug-aided hypnosis. He surprises his Venus-born friend Oscar by spontaneously reproving him when Oscar utters a curse in Venutian. (Later in the novel Matt appears to have forgotten what he learned and relies on Oscar for translation.) * In the BBC Radio series Journey into Space (1953–1958), during the second and third parts of the trilogy, there were said to be Martians abducting people from the Earth and conditioning them to obey instructions or to make them believe things that were not true. The inception of this conditioning involved putting the subject into a hypnotic sleep and appraising them of a certain situation; once they awoke they would believe it, regardless of the validity. * In a 1961 episode of My Three Sons, \\"A Lesson In Any Language\\", Mike connects a phonograph to an automatic timer to play Spanish lessons while he sleeps. Steve and Bub ultimately end up sleeping in the room and are able to speak fluent Spanish the following day. * In Anthony Burgess's 1962 novel A Clockwork Orange, it is used to reverse the effects of the Ludovico Technique, a form of classical conditioning, which was used on the main character Alex to make him incapable of violent behavior. The conditioning was a new technique which was supposed to rehabilitate violent criminals in a short period of time, but which resulted in Alex attempting to commit suicide. This reflected very badly on the government, which had sanctioned the experiment, so hypnopædia was used to undo the conditioning. * In 1954 Günter Spang wrote a children's book called Lohengrin schwant etwas, meaning Lohengrin has a good idea, in which a bunch of schoolchildren take an easy way out of studying by learning in their sleep. * In a 1963 episode of The Patty Duke Show, \\"The Conquering Hero\\", Cathy tries to help a failing basketball player pass a quiz. She suggests that the latest scientific method of \\"subconscious learning\\" will help. She records the lessons on a tape which plays repeatedly while he is asleep. He passes the quiz after the answers \\"come to him\\" while looking at the questions. * In the 1965 episode of \\"I Spy\\" titled Chrysanthemum, the assigned partner of Bill Cosby and Robert Culp's characters, Maximilian de Broget claims to have learned Mandarin Chinese in his sleep. * In the 1965 movie The Monkey's Uncle, a college student connects a phonograph to an automatic timer, which plays to sleeping students the voice of a girl reading their lessons aloud. This backfires in class, however—when asked to give an oral report, the students speak, but in the girl's voice. * In the 1966 novel Flowers for Algernon, an intellectually disabled 37-year-old, Charlie Gordon, has an operation to increase his intelligence. Professor Nemur and Dr. Strauss then give Charlie a \\"teeching mashine that werks like T.V.\\" Charlie explains to Professor Nemur that . *In the 1968 hungarian show ˝A Mézga család˝, in the 30 century pepole learn by ˝dio diódás bátáplálás hipnoaudoidiótikus módszerrel˝ translated to ˝dio diotic intake with hipnoaudoidotic method˝ * The 1976 film Logan's Run contains a scene where Logan 5 (Michael York) chastises his friend Francis 7 (Richard Jordan) for his rigidly orthodox opinions, \\"You sound like a sleep-teacher with a stuck tape\\". * In a 1988 episode of the BBC2 sitcom Red Dwarf, \\"Me2\\", Arnold Rimmer uses sleep-learning tapes such as Learn Esperanto While You Sleep and Learn Quantum Theory While You Sleep, to the dismay of his bunkmate Dave Lister. * In the 1990 movie Dragon Ball Z: The Tree of Might, Chi-Chi packs for her son Gohan a tape recorder so he can learn while he sleeps on a camping trip. * In a 1992 episode of The Simpsons, \\"Bart's Friend Falls in Love\\", Homer orders hypnosis tapes which are supposed to induce weight loss.

Most inscriptions containing these symbols are extremely short, making it difficult to judge whether or not these symbols constituted a script used to record a language, or even symbolise a writing system. In spite of many attempts,(Possehl, 1996) the 'script' has not yet been deciphered, but efforts are ongoing. There is no known bilingual inscription to help decipher the script, and the script shows no significant changes over time. However, some of the syntax (if that is what it may be termed) varies depending upon location. The first publication of a seal with Harappan symbols dates to 1875, in a drawing by Alexander Cunningham. Since then, over 4,000 inscribed objects have been discovered, some as far afield as Mesopotamia, as a consequence of ancient Indus-Mesopotamia relations. In the early 1970s, Iravatham Mahadevan published a corpus and concordance of Indus inscriptions listing 3,700 seals and 417 distinct signs in specific patterns. He also found that the average inscription contained five symbols and that the longest inscription contained only 26 symbols. Some scholars, such as G.R. Hunter, S. R. Rao, John Newberry\\"Indus script monographs - Volumes 1-7\\", p.10-20, 1980, John Newberry and Krishna Rao\\"An Encyclopaedia of Indian Archaeology\\", Amalananda Ghosh, p.362, 1990 have argued that the Brāhmī script has some connection with the Indus system. F. Raymond Allchin has somewhat cautiously supported the possibility of the Brahmi script being influenced by the Indus script. Another possibility for continuity of the Indus tradition is in the megalithic culture graffiti symbols of southern and central India (and Sri Lanka), which probably do not constitute a linguistic script but may have some overlap with the Indus symbol inventory. Linguists such as Iravatham Mahadevan, Kamil Zvelebil and Asko Parpola have argued that the script had a relation to a Dravidian language. Corpus A few tablets with Indus script. Early examples of the symbol system are found in an Early Harappan and Indus civilisation context, dated to possibly as early as the 35th century BCE. In the Mature Harappan period, from about 2600 BCE to 1900 BCE, strings of Indus signs are commonly found on flat, rectangular stamp seals as well as many other objects including tools, tablets, ornaments and pottery. The signs were written in many ways, including carving, chiseling, painting and embossing, on objects made of many different materials, such as soapstone, bone, shell, terracotta, sandstone, copper, silver and gold. Often, animals such as bulls, elephants, rhinoceros, water buffaloes and the mythical unicorn accompanied the text on seals to help the illiterate identify the origin of a particular seal. =Late Harappan= Bet Dwarka During an underwater excavation at the Late Harappan site of Bet Dwarka, a seven sign inscription was discovered inscribed on a pottery jar. The inscription is dated to 1528 BCE and consists of linear signs, as compared to the logographic Indus script. According to S.R Rao, four out of the seven signs show similarities with the Brahmi letters cha, ya, ja, pa or sa respectively. The script is also written from left to right, as is the case with Brahmi. Jhukar Phase, Sindh Jhukar phase is the late Harappan phase in the present province of Sindh, Pakistan which followed the mature urbanized Harappan phase. Although seals from this phase lack the Indus script which characterized the preceding phase of the civilization, some potsherd inscriptions have been noted.Singh (2008) Daimabad, Maharashtra Indus inscribed seals and potsherds have been noted at Daimabad in its late Harappan and Daimabad phase dated 2200-1600 BC.  Characteristics  According to some historians the Indus script was probably written from right to left . The characters are largely pictorial but include many abstract signs. The inscriptions are thought to have been written mostly from right-to-left (because there are several instances of the symbols being compressed on the left side, as if the writer is running out of space at the end of the row there), but they sometimes follow a boustrophedonic style. The number of principal signs is about 400. Since that is considered too large a number for each character to be a phonogram, the script is generally believed to instead be logo-syllabic. However, as almost all these signs are used on seals, which create mirror image impression on the clay or ceramic on which the seal is affixed, the writing on the seal has to be reverse, like AMBULANCE. Hence, it cannot be deduced that the language itself was written from right to left. Also writing in jars have been left to right, supports this.  Decipherability question  Indus script tablet recovered from Khirasara, Indus Valley Civilization Ten Indus script from the northern gate of Dholavira, dubbed the Dholavira Signboard, one of the longest known sequences of Indus characters. An opposing hypothesis that has been offered by Michael Witzel and Steve Farmer, is that these symbols are nonlinguistic signs, which symbolise families, clans, gods, and religious concepts and are similar to components of coats of arms or totem poles.Farmer et al. (2004) In a 2004 article, Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel presented a number of arguments stating that the Indus script is nonlinguistic. The main ones are the extreme brevity of the inscriptions, the existence of too many rare signs (which increase over the 700-year period of the Mature Harappan civilization) and the lack of the random-looking sign repetition that is typical of language. Asko Parpola, reviewing the Farmer, Sproat, and Witzel thesis in 2005, stated that their arguments \\"can be easily controverted\\".(Parpola, 2005, p. 37) He cited the presence of a large number of rare signs in Chinese and emphasised that there was \\"little reason for sign repetition in short seal texts written in an early logo-syllabic script\\". Revisiting the question in a 2007 lecture,(Parpola, 2008). Parpola took on each of the 10 main arguments of Farmer et al., presenting counterarguments for each. A 2009 paper published by Rajesh P N Rao, Iravatham Mahadevan and others in the journal Science also challenged the argument that the Indus script might have been a nonlinguistic symbol system. The paper concluded that the conditional entropy of Indus inscriptions closely matched those of linguistic systems like the Sumerian logo-syllabic system, Rig Vedic Sanskrit etc., but they are careful to stress that by itself does not imply that the script is linguistic. A follow-up study presented further evidence in terms of entropies of longer sequences of symbols beyond pairs. However, Sproat claimed that there existed a number of misunderstandings in Rao et al., including a lack of discriminative power in their model, and argued that applying their model to known non-linguistic systems such as Mesopotamian deity symbols produced similar results to the Indus script. Rao et al.'s argument against Sproat's claims and Sproat's reply were published in Computational Linguistics in December 2010.Computational Linguistics, Volume 36, Issue 4, December 2010. The June 2014 issue of Language carries a paper by Sproat that provides further evidence that the methodology of Rao et al. is flawed.R. Sproat, 2014, \\"A Statistical Comparison of Written Language and Nonlinguistic Symbol Systems\\". Language, Volume 90, Issue 2, June 2014.

Attempts at decipherment  Over the years, numerous decipherments have been proposed, but there is no established scholarly consensus. The few points on which there exists scholarly consensus are the right-to-left direction of the majority of the inscriptions, numerical nature of certain stroke-like signs, functional homogeneity of certain terminal signs, and some generally adopted techniques of segmenting the inscriptions into initial, medial and terminal clusters. The following factors are usually regarded as the biggest obstacles for a successful decipherment: * The underlying language has not been identified, though some 300 loanwords in the Rigveda are a good starting point for comparison.FBJ Kuiper, Aryans in the Rigveda, Amsterdam/Atlanta 1991M. Witzel underlines the prefixing nature of these words and calls them Para-Munda, a language related to but not belonging to Proto-Munda; see: Witzel, M. Substrate Languages in Old Indo-Aryan (Ṛgvedic, Middle and Late Vedic), EJVS Vol. 5,1, 1999, 1-67 * The average length of the inscriptions is less than five signs, the longest being only 26 signs long, although recent findings have revealed copper plates belonging to the mature Harappan period, one of them having 34 characters inscribed onto it.Shinde, V. & Willis, R.J., (2014). A New Type of Inscribed Copper Plate from Indus Valley (Harappan) Civilisation . Ancient Asia . 5, p . Art. 1 . DOI: http://doi.org/10.5334/aa.12317 * No bilingual texts (like a Rosetta Stone) have been found. The topic is popular among amateur researchers, and there have been various (mutually exclusive) decipherment claims.see e.g. Egbert Richter and N. S. Rajaram for examples. = Dravidian hypothesis = Brahmi and Indus scripts, made in the 19th century by Alexander Cunningham. The Russian scholar Yuri Knorozov suggested, based on computer analysis, a Dravidian language as the most likely candidate for the underlying language of the script.(Knorozov 1965) Knorozov's suggestion was preceded by the work of Henry Heras, who also suggested several readings of signs based on a proto- Dravidian assumption.(Heras, 1953) The Finnish scholar Asko Parpola wrote that the Indus script and Harappan language \\"most likely belonged to the Dravidian family\\". Parpola led a Finnish team in the 1960s-80s that, like Knorozov's Soviet team, worked towards investigating the inscriptions using computer analysis. Based on a proto-Dravidian assumption, the teams proposed readings of many signs. A number of people agreed with the suggested readings of Heras and Knorozov. One such reading was legitimised when the Dravidian word for both 'fish' and 'star', \\"min\\" was hinted at through drawings of both the things together on Harappan seals. A comprehensive description of Parpola's work until 1994 is given in his book Deciphering the Indus Script.(Parpola, 1994) Iravatham Mahadevan, another scholar who supported the Dravidian hypothesis, said \\"we may hopefully find that the proto-Dravidian roots of the Harappan language and South Indian Dravidian languages are similar. This is a hypothesis [...] But I have no illusions that I will decipher the Indus script, nor do I have any regret\\". Commenting on his 2014 publication Dravidian Proof of the Indus Script via The Rig Veda: A Case Study, Mahadevan claimed to have made significant progress in deciphering the script as Dravidian. According to Mahadevan, a stone celt discovered in Mayiladuthurai (Tamil Nadu) has the same markings as that of the symbols of the Indus script. The celt dates to early 2nd millennium BCE, post-dating Harappan decline. Mahadevan considered this as evidence of the same language being used by the neolithic people of south India and the late Harappans.(Subramanium 2006; see also A Note on the Muruku Sign of the Indus Script in light of the Mayiladuthurai Stone Axe Discovery by I. Mahadevan (2006) This hypothesis was also supported by Rajesh P. N. Rao In May 2007, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department found pots with arrow-head symbols during an excavation in Melaperumpallam near Poompuhar. These symbols are claimed to have a striking resemblance to seals unearthed in Mohenjo-daro in present-day Pakistan in the 1920s. In Sembiyankandiyur a stone axe was found, claimed to be containing Indus symbols. In 2014, a cave in Kerala was discovered with 19 pictograph symbols claimed to be containing Indus writing. In 2019, excavations at the Keezhadi site near present-day Madurai unearthed potsherds with graffiti.https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keeladi-findings- traceable-to-6th-century-bce-report/article29461583.ece. In a report, the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department (TNAD) dated the potsherds to 580 BCE and said the graffiti bore numerous similarities to known Harappan symbols, so it could be a transitional script between Indus Valley script and the Tamil Brahmi script used during the Sangam Period.. However, other Indian archaeologists have contested https://science.thewire.in/society/history/keeladi-settlement-tamil-nadu- department-of-archaeology-tamil-brahmi-script-indus-valley-civilisation/ the TNAD report's claims, because the report does not say if the sherds with the Tamil-Brahmi script had been taken from the same layers as the samples that had been dated to the sixth century BC. As for the report's claim that the Keezhadi potsherds bore a script that bridged the gap between the Indus script and Tamil Brahmi, G.R.Hunter Hunter, G.R., Ph. D thesis, The Script of Harappa and Mohenjadaro, Oxford University, U.K., 1934, https://ufdc.ufl.edu/AA00013642/00001 pointed out the similarities between the Indus and Brahmi scripts, in 1934, long before the Keezhadi site was discovered. =Sanskritic hypothesis= Indian archaeologist Shikaripura Ranganatha Rao claimed to have deciphered the Indus script. He compared it to the Phoenician alphabet, and assigned sound values based on this comparison. His decipherment results in a \\"Sanskritic\\" reading, including the numerals aeka, dwi, tra, chatus, panta, happta/sapta, dasa, dvadasa, sata (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 12, 100). He also noted a number of striking similarities in shape and form between the late Harappan characters and the Phoenician letters, arguing that the Phoenician script evolved from the Harappan script, and not, as the classical theory suggests from the Proto-Sinaitic script.Robinson, Andrew. Lost Languages: The Enigma of the World's Undeciphered Scripts. 2002 John E. Mitchiner dismissed some of these attempts at decipherment. Mitchiner mentioned that \\"a more soundly-based but still greatly subjective and unconvincing attempt to discern an Indo-European basis in the script has been that of Rao\\".J.E. Mitchiner: Studies in the Indus Valley Inscriptions, p.5, with reference to S.R. Rao: Lothal and the Indus Civilisation (ch.10), Bombay 1978. =Miscellaneous hypotheses = There have been several hypotheses regarding the language pertaining to the Indus Script. One of the most common ones has been that the script belongs to the Indo-Aryan language. However, there are many problems with this hypothesis. A major one includes: Since the people belonging to the Indo-European cultures were always on the move, horses played a very important role in their lives or as Parpola put it, \\"There is no escape from the fact that the horse played a central role in the Vedic and Iranian cultures...\\" (Parpola, 1986). Impression of an Indus cylinder seal discovered in Susa (modern Iran), in strata dated to 2600-1700 BCE, an example of ancient Indus-Mesopotamia relations. Louvre Museum, reference Sb 2425. Numbering convention for the Indus script by Asko Parpola.Also, for another numbering scheme: A second, though not as popular hypothesis is that the Indus script belongs to the Munda family of languages. The Munda family of languages is spoken largely in Eastern India, and is related to some and Southeast Asian languages. However, much like the Indo-Aryan language, the reconstructed vocabulary of early Munda does not reflect the Harappan culture. Therefore, its candidacy for being the language of the Indus Civilization is dim. Similarities with Linear Elamite Scholars have also compared the Indus valley script with the Linear Elamite writing system used in Elam, an ancient Pre-Iranian civilization that was contemporaneous with the Indus Valley civilization. The two languages were contemporary to each other. Scholars gained knowledge of the Elamite language from a bilingual monument called the \\"Table of the Lion\\" in the Louvre museum. On comparing this ancient language to the Indus script, a number of similar symbols have been found. Encoding The Indus symbols have been assigned the ISO 15924 code \\"Inds\\". The script was proposed for encoding in Unicode's Supplementary Multilingual Plane in 1999; however, the Unicode Consortium still lists the proposal in pending status. and http://unicode.org/pending/pending.html At the International Conference on Mohenjodaro and Indus Valley Civilisation 2017 it was noted that two language engineers, Amar Fayaz Buriro and Shabir Kumbhar have engineered all 1839 signs of Indus script and presented a developed Indus script font.

The term is also used for bird deaths resulting from collisions with structures such as power lines, towers and wind turbines (see Bird–skyscraper collisions and Towerkill). Bird strikes are a significant threat to flight safety, and have caused a number of accidents with human casualties. There are over 13,000 bird strikes annually in the US alone. However, the number of major accidents involving civil aircraft is quite low and it has been estimated that there is only about 1 accident resulting in human death in one billion (109) flying hours. The majority of bird strikes (65%) cause little damage to the aircraft; however the collision is usually fatal to the bird(s) involved. Particularly, the Canada goose has been ranked as the third most hazardous wildlife species to aircraft with approximately 240 goose-aircraft collisions in the United States each year. 80% of all bird strikes go unreported. Most accidents occur when a bird (or birds) collides with the windscreen or is sucked into the engine of jet aircraft. These cause annual damages that have been estimated at $400 million within the United States alone and up to $1.2 billion to commercial aircraft worldwide. In addition to property damage, collisions between man-made structures and conveyances and birds is a contributing factor, among many others, to the worldwide decline of many avian species. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) received 65,139 bird strike reports for 2011–14, and the Federal Aviation Authority counted 177,269 wildlife strike reports on civil aircraft between 1990 and 2015, growing 38% in seven years from 2009 to 2015. Birds accounted for 97%. Event description View of fan blades of Pratt & Whitney JT8D jet engine after a bird strike Inside of a jet engine after a bird strike An ICE 3 high speed train after hitting a bird A bird control vehicle belonging to Copenhagen Airport Kastrup, equipped with various tools Bird strikes happen most often during takeoff or landing, or during low altitude flight. However, bird strikes have also been reported at high altitudes, some as high as above the ground. Bar-headed geese have been seen flying as high as above sea level. An aircraft over the Ivory Coast collided with a Rüppell's vulture at the altitude of , the current record avian height.Thomas Alerstam, David A. Christie, Astrid Ulfstrand. Bird Migration (1990). Page 276. The majority of bird collisions occur near or at airports (90%, according to the ICAO) during takeoff, landing and associated phases. According to the FAA wildlife hazard management manual for 2005, less than 8% of strikes occur above and 61% occur at less than . The point of impact is usually any forward-facing edge of the vehicle such as a wing leading edge, nose cone, jet engine cowling or engine inlet. Jet engine ingestion is extremely serious due to the rotation speed of the engine fan and engine design. As the bird strikes a fan blade, that blade can be displaced into another blade and so forth, causing a cascading failure. Jet engines are particularly vulnerable during the takeoff phase when the engine is turning at a very high speed and the plane is at a low altitude where birds are more commonly found. The force of the impact on an aircraft depends on the weight of the animal and the speed difference and direction at the point of impact. The energy of the impact increases with the square of the speed difference. High-speed impacts, as with jet aircraft, can cause considerable damage and even catastrophic failure to the vehicle. The energy of a bird moving at a relative velocity of approximately equals the energy of a weight dropped from a height of .Note however that the momentum (as distinct from the kinetic energy) of the bird in this example is considerably less than that of the tonne weight, and therefore the force required to deflect it is also considerably less. However, according to the FAA only 15% of strikes (ICAO 11%) actually result in damage to the aircraft. Bird strikes can damage vehicle components, or injure passengers. Flocks of birds are especially dangerous and can lead to multiple strikes, with corresponding damage. Depending on the damage, aircraft at low altitudes or during take-off and landing often cannot recover in time. US Airways Flight 1549 is a classic example of this. The engines on the Airbus A320 used on that flight were torn apart by multiple bird strikes at low altitude. There was no time to make a safe landing at an airport, forcing a water landing in the Hudson River. Remains of the bird, termed snarge, are sent to identification centers where forensic techniques may be used to identify the species involved. These samples need to be taken carefully by trained personnel to ensure proper analysis and reduce the risks of infection (zoonoses). Species Most bird strikes involve large birds with big populations, particularly geese and gulls in the United States. In parts of the US, Canada geese and migratory snow geese populations have risen significantly while feral Canada geese and greylag geese have increased in parts of Europe, increasing the risk of these large birds to aircraft. In other parts of the world, large birds of prey such as Gyps vultures and Milvus kites are often involved. In the US, reported strikes are mainly from waterfowl (30%), gulls (22%), raptors (20%), and pigeons and doves (7%). The Smithsonian Institution's Feather Identification Laboratory has identified turkey vultures as the most damaging birds, followed by Canada geese and white pelicans, all of which are very large birds. In terms of frequency, the laboratory most commonly finds mourning doves and horned larks involved in the strike. The largest numbers of strikes happen during the spring and fall migrations. Bird strikes above altitude are about 7 times more common at night than during the day during the bird migration season. Large land animals, such as deer, can also be a problem to aircraft during takeoff and landing. Between 1990 and 2013, civil aircraft experienced more than 1,000 collisions with deer and 440 with coyotes. An animal hazard reported from London Stansted Airport in England is rabbits: they get run over by ground vehicles and planes, and they pass large amounts of droppings, which attract mice, which in turn attract owls, which then become another birdstrike hazard.Television program \\"Stansted: the Inside Story\\", 6 to 7 pm, Sunday 6 March 2011, Fiver (TV channel) Countermeasures There are three approaches to reduce the effect of bird strikes. The vehicles can be designed to be more bird resistant, the birds can be moved out of the way of the vehicle, or the vehicle can be moved out of the way of the birds. =Vehicle design= Most large commercial jet engines include design features that ensure they can shut-down after \\"ingesting\\" a bird weighing up to . The engine does not have to survive the ingestion, just be safely shut down. This is a 'stand-alone' requirement, i.e., the engine, not the aircraft, must pass the test. Multiple strikes (from hitting a bird flock) on twin-engine jet aircraft are very serious events because they can disable multiple aircraft systems, requiring emergency action to land the aircraft, as in the January 15, 2009 forced ditching of US Airways Flight 1549. Modern jet aircraft structures must be able to withstand one collision; the empennage (tail) must withstand one bird collision. Cockpit windows on jet aircraft must be able to withstand one bird collision without yielding or spalling. At first, bird strike testing by manufacturers involved firing a bird carcass from a gas cannon and sabot system into the tested unit. The carcass was soon replaced with suitable density blocks, often gelatin, to ease testing. Current testing is mainly conducted with computer simulation,V. Bheemreddy et al., \\"Study of Bird Strikes Using Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics and Stochastic Parametric Evaluation,\\" Journal of Aircraft, Vol. 49, pp. 1513–1520, 2012. although final testing usually involves some physical experiments (see birdstrike simulator). Based on US NTSB recommendation following the 2009 US Airways Flight 1549, the EASA in 2017, followed a year after by the FAA, proposed that engines should sustain a bird strike not only on takeoff where turbofans are turning at their fastest, but also in climb and descent when they turn more slowly; new regulations could apply for the Boeing NMA engines. =Wildlife management= An Airbus A330 of China Eastern behind a flock of birds at London Heathrow Though there are many methods available to wildlife managers at airports, no single method will work in all instances and with all species. Wildlife management in the airport environment can be grouped into two broad categories: non-lethal and lethal. Integration of multiple non-lethal methods with lethal methods results in the most effective airfield wildlife management strategy. Non-lethal Non-lethal management can be further broken down into habitat manipulation, exclusion, visual, auditory, tactile, or chemical repellents, and relocation. Habitat manipulation One of the primary reasons that wildlife is seen in airports is an abundance of food. Food resources on airports can be either removed or made less desirable. One of the most abundant food resources found on airports is turfgrass. This grass is planted to reduce runoff, control erosion, absorb jet wash, allow passage of emergency vehicles, and to be aesthetically pleasing (DeVault et al. 2013T. L. DeVault, B. F. Blackwell, and J. L. Belant, editors. 2013. Wildlife in airport environments: preventing animal–aircraft collisions through science-based management. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore, Maryland, USA.) However, turfgrass is a preferred food source for species of birds that pose a serious risk to aircraft, chiefly the Canada goose (Branta canadensis). Turfgrass planted at airports should be a species that geese do not prefer (e.g. St. Augustine grass) and should be managed in such a way that reduces its attractiveness to other wildlife such as small rodents and raptors (Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010,Commander, Naval Installations Command, Air Operations Program Director. 2010. Bird/animal aircraft strike hazard (BASH) manual. Department of the Navy. Washington D.C., USA. DeVault et al. 2013). It has been recommended that turfgrass be maintained at a height of 7–14 inches through regular mowing and fertilization (U.S. Air Force 2004U.S. Air Force. 2004. Air Force pamphlet 91–212: Bird/wildlife aircraft strike hazard (BASH) management techniques. Washington D.C., USA.). Wetlands are another major attractant of wildlife in the airport environment. They are of particular concern because they attract waterfowl which have a high potential to damage aircraft (Federal Aviation Administration 2013Federal Aviation Administration. 2013. Wildlife strikes to civil aircraft in the United States: 1990–2012. National Wildlife Strike Database Serial Report Number 19. Washington D.C., USA.). With large areas of impervious surfaces, airports must employ methods to collect runoff and reduce its flow velocity. These best management practices often involve temporarily ponding runoff. Short of redesigning existing runoff control systems to include non-accessible water such as subsurface flow wetlands (DeVault et al. 2013), frequent drawdowns and covering of exposed water with floating covers and wire grids should be employed (International Civil Aviation Organization 1991International Civil Aviation Organization. 1991. Bird control and reduction. Airport services manual, Document 9137-AN/898, Part 3. Montreal, Quebec, Canada.). The implementation of covers and wire grids must not hinder emergency services. Exclusion Though excluding birds from the entire airport environment is virtually impossible, it is possible to exclude deer and other mammals that constitute a small percentage of wildlife strikes. Three-meter high fences made of chain link or woven wire, with barbed wire outriggers, are the most effective. When used as a perimeter fence, these fences also serve to keep unauthorized people off of the airport (Seamans 2001Seamans, T. W., 2001. A review of deer control devices intended for use on airports. Proceedings of the 3rd joint annual meeting. Bird Strike Committee-USA/Canada, 27–30 August 2001, Calgary, Alberta, Canada.). Realistically every fence must have gates. Gates that are left open allow deer and other mammals onto the airport. 4.6 meter long cattle guards have been shown to be effective at deterring deer up to 98% of the time (Belant et al. 1998Belant, J. L., T. W. Seamans, and C. P. Dwyer. 1998. Cattle guards reduce white-tailed deer crossings through fence openings. International Journal of Pest Management 44:247–249.). Hangars with open superstructures often attract birds to nest and roost in. Hangar doors are often left open to increase ventilation, especially in the evenings. Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements. Strip curtains and door netting may also be used but are subject to improper use (e.g. tying the strips to the side of the door) by those working in the hangar. (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010). Visual repellents There have been a variety of visual repellent and harassment techniques used in airport wildlife management. They include using birds of prey and dogs, effigies, landing lights, and lasers. Birds of prey have been used with great effectiveness at landfills where there were large populations of feeding gulls (Cook et al. 2008Cook, A., S. Rushton, J. Allen, and A. Baxter. 2008. An evaluation of techniques to control problem bird species on landfill sites. Environmental Management 41: 834–843.). Dogs have also been used with success as visual deterrents and means of harassment for birds at airfields (DeVault et al. 2013). However, airport wildlife managers must consider the risk of knowingly releasing animals in the airport environment. Both birds of prey and dogs must be monitored by a handler when deployed and must be cared for, when not deployed. Airport wildlife managers must consider the economics of these methods (Seamans 2001). Effigies of both predators and conspecifics have been used with success to disperse gulls and vultures. The effigies of conspecifics are often placed in unnatural positions where they can freely move with the wind. Effigies have been found to be the most effective in situations where the nuisance birds have other options (e.g. other forage, loafing, and roosting areas) available. Time to habituation varies. (Seamans et al. 2007,Seamans, T. W., C. R. Hicks, and J. P. Kenneth. 2007. Dead bird effigies: a nightmare for gulls? Proceedings of the 9th joint annual meeting. Bird Strike Committee-USA/Canada, Kingston, Ontario, Canada. DeVault et al. 2013). Lasers have been used with success to disperse several species of birds. However, lasers are species-specific as certain species will only react to certain wavelengths. Lasers become more effective as ambient light levels decrease, thereby limiting effectiveness during daylight hours. Some species show a very short time to habituation (Airport Cooperative Research Program, 2011Airport Cooperative Research Program. 2011. Bird harassment, repellent, and deterrent techniques for use on and near airports. Transportation Research Board. Washington D.C., USA.). The risks of lasers to aircrews must be evaluated when determining whether or not to deploy lasers on airfields.FAA Order JO 7400.2L, Procedures for Handling Airspace Matters, effective 2017-10-12 (with changes), accessed 2017-12-04 Southampton Airport utilizes a laser device which disables the laser past a certain elevation, eliminating the risk of the beam being shone directly at aircraft and air traffic control tower (Southampton Airport 2014).Southampton Airport. 2014. Southampton Airport brings in the next generation of bird control lasers. < http://www.southamptonairport.com/news/news-press/2014/07/09/southampton- airport-brings-in-next-generation-of-bird-control-lasers/ >. Accessed 11 Oct 2016. Auditory repellents Auditory repellents are commonly used in both agricultural and aviation contexts. Devices such as propane exploders (cannons), pyrotechnics, and bioacoustics are frequently deployed on airports. Propane exploders are capable of creating noises of approximately 130 decibels (Wildlife Control SuppliesWildlife Control Supplies. 2013. M4 Single Bang Propane Cannon. < http://www.wildlifecontrolsupplies.com/animal/NWS2501/WCSRJM4.html>. Accessed 26 Oct 2013.). They can be programmed to fire at designated intervals, can be remote controlled, or motion activated. Due to their stationary and often predictable nature, wildlife quickly becomes habituated to propane cannons. Lethal control may be used to extend the effectiveness of propane exploders (Washburn et al. 2006). Wireless specialized launcher mounted in an airport vehicle Pyrotechnics utilizing either an exploding shell or a screamer can effectively scare birds away from runways. They are commonly launched from a 12 gauge shotgun or a flare pistol, or from a wireless specialized launcher and as such, can be aimed to allow control personnel to \\"steer\\" the species that is being harassed. Birds show varying degrees of habituation to pyrotechnics. Studies have shown that lethal reinforcement of pyrotechnic harassment has extended its usefulness (Baxter and Allen 2008Baxter, A. T., and J. R. Allan, 2008. Use of lethal control to reduce habituation to blank rounds by scavenging birds. Journal of Wildlife Management 72:1653–1657.). Screamer type cartridges are still intact at the end of their flight (as opposed to exploding shells that destroy themselves) constituting a foreign object damage hazard and must be picked up. The use of pyrotechnics is considered \\"take\\" by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) and USFWS must be consulted if federally threatened or endangered species could be affected. Pyrotechnics are a potential fire hazard and must be deployed judiciously in dry conditions (Commander, Naval Installations Command, 2010, Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011). Bioacoustics, or the playing of conspecific distress or predator calls to frighten animals, is widely used. This method relies on the animal's evolutionary danger response (Airport Cooperative Research Program 2011).However, bioacoustics are species-specific and birds may quickly become habituated to them and they should not be used as a primary means of control (U.S. Air Force 2004, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010). In 2012, operators at Gloucestershire Airport in the United Kingdom revealed that songs by the American-Swiss singer Tina Turner were more effective than animal noises for scaring birds from its runways. Tactile repellents Sharpened spikes to deter perching and loafing are commonly used. Generally, large birds require different applications than small birds do (DeVault et al. 2013). Chemical repellents There are only two chemical bird repellents registered for use in the United States. They are methyl anthranilate and anthraquinone. Methyl anthranilate is a primary repellent that produces an immediate unpleasant sensation that is reflexive and does not have to be learned. As such it is most effective for transient populations of birds (DeVault et al. 2013). Methyl anthranilate has been used with great success at rapidly dispersing birds from flight lines at Homestead Air Reserve Station (Engeman et al. 2002Engeman, R. M., J. Peterla, and B. Constantin. 2002. Methyl anthranilate aerosol for dispersing birds from the flight lines at Homestead Air Reserve Station. USDA National Wildlife Research Center-Staff Publications.). Anthraquinone is a secondary repellent that has a laxative effect that is not instantaneous. Because of this it is most effective on resident populations of wildlife that will have time to learn an aversive response (Izhaki 2002, DeVault et al. 2013). Relocation Relocation of raptors from airports is often considered preferable to lethal control methods by both biologists and the public. There are complex legal issues surrounding the capture and relocation of species protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 and the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act of 1940. Prior to capture, proper permits must be obtained and the high mortality rates as well as the risk of disease transmission associated with relocation must be weighed. Between 2008 and 2010, U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel relocated 606 red-tailed hawks from airports in the United States after the failure of multiple harassment attempts. The return rate of these hawks was 6%; however the relocation mortality rate for these hawks was never determined (DeVault et al. 2013). Lethal Lethal wildlife control on airports falls into two categories: reinforcement of other non-lethal methods and population control. Reinforcement The premise of effigies, pyrotechnics, and propane exploders is that there be a perceived immediate danger to the species to be dispersed. Initially, the sight of an unnaturally positioned effigy or the sound of pyrotechnics or exploders is enough to elicit a danger response from wildlife. As wildlife become habituated to non-lethal methods the culling of small numbers of wildlife in the presence of conspecifics can restore the danger response (Baxter and Allan 2008, Cook et al. 2008, Commander, Naval Installations Command 2010, DeVault et al. 2013). Population control Under certain circumstances, lethal wildlife control is needed to control the population of a species. This control can be localized or regional. Localized population control is often used to control species that are residents of the airfield such as deer that have bypassed the perimeter fence. In this instance sharpshooting would be highly effective, such as is seen at Chicago O'Hare International Airport (DeVault et al. 2013). Regional population control has been used on species that cannot be excluded from the airport environment. A nesting colony of laughing gulls at Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge contributed to 98–315 bird strikes per year, in 1979–1992, at adjacent John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK). Though JFK had an active bird management program that precluded birds from feeding and loafing on the airport, it did not stop them from overflying the airport to other feeding sites. U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services personnel began shooting all gulls that flew over the airport, hypothesizing that eventually, the gulls would alter their flight patterns. They shot 28,352 gulls in two years (approximately half of the population at Jamaica Bay and 5–6% of the nationwide population per year). Strikes with laughing gulls decreased by 89% by 1992. However this was more a function of the population reduction than the gulls altering their flight pattern (Dolbeer et al. 1993, Dolbeer et al. 2003,Dolbeer, R. A., R. B. Chipman, A. L. Gosser, and S. C. Barras. 2003. Does shooting alter flight patterns of gulls: a case study at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Proceedings of the International Bird Strike Committee 26:49–67. DeVault et al. 2013). =Flight path= Pilots should not take off or land in the presence of wildlife and should avoid migratory routes, wildlife reserves, estuaries and other sites where birds may congregate. When operating in the presence of bird flocks, pilots should seek to climb above as rapidly as possible as most bird strikes occur below . Additionally, pilots should slow down their aircraft when confronted with birds. The energy that must be dissipated in the collision is approximately the relative kinetic energy (E_{k}) of the bird, defined by the equation E_{k} = frac{1}{2} m v^{2} where m is the mass of the bird and v is the relative velocity (the difference of the velocities of the bird and the plane, resulting in a lower absolute value if they are flying in the same direction and higher absolute value if they are flying in opposite directions). Therefore, the speed of the aircraft is much more important than the size of the bird when it comes to reducing energy transfer in a collision. The same can be said for jet engines: the slower the rotation of the engine, the less energy which will be imparted onto the engine at collision. The body density of the bird is also a parameter that influences the amount of damage caused. The US Military Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS) uses near real-time data from the 148 CONUS based National Weather Service Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD or WSR 88-D) system to provide current bird hazard conditions for published military low-level routes, ranges, and military operating areas (MOAs). Additionally, AHAS incorporates weather forecast data with the Bird Avoidance Model (BAM) to predict soaring bird activity within the next 24 hours and then defaults to the BAM for planning purposes when activity is scheduled outside the 24-hour window. The BAM is a static historical hazard model based on many years of bird distribution data from Christmas Bird Counts (CBC), Breeding Bird Surveys (BBS), and National Wildlife Refuge Data. The BAM also incorporates potentially hazardous bird attractions such as landfills and golf courses. AHAS is now an integral part of military low-level mission planning, aircrew being able to access the current bird hazard conditions at www.usahas.com. AHAS will provide relative risk assessments for the planned mission and give aircrew the opportunity to select a less hazardous route should the planned route be rated severe or moderate. Prior to 2003, the US Air Force BASH Team bird strike database indicated that approximately 25% of all strikes were associated with low-level routes and bombing ranges. More importantly, these strikes accounted for more than 50% of all of the reported damage costs. After a decade of using AHAS for avoiding routes with severe ratings, the strike percentage associated with low-level flight operations has been reduced to 12% and associated costs cut in half. Avian radarBeason, Robert C., et al., \\"Beware the Boojum: caveats and strengths of avian radar\\" , Human-Wildlife Interactions, Spring 2013 is an important tool for aiding in bird strike mitigation as part of overall safety management systems at civilian and military airfields. Properly designed and equipped avian radars can track thousands of birds simultaneously in real-time, night and day, through 360° of coverage, out to ranges of 10 km and beyond for flocks, updating every target's position (longitude, latitude, altitude), speed, heading, and size every 2–3 seconds. Data from these systems can be used to generate information products ranging from real-time threat alerts to historical analyses of bird activity patterns in both time and space. The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the United States Department of Defense (DOD) have conducted extensive science-based field testing and validation of commercial avian radar systems for civil and military applications, respectively. The FAA used evaluations of commercial 3D avian radar systems developed and marketed by Accipiter Radar\\"Accipiter Radar: Bird Strike Prevention Applications\\" as the basis for FAA Advisory Circular 150/5220-25\\"Airport Avian Radar Systems\\" and a guidance letter\\"Program Guidance Letter 12-04\\" on using Airport Improvement Program funds to acquire avian radar systems at Part 139 airports.\\"Part 139 Airport Certification\\" Similarly, the DOD-sponsored Integration and Validation of Avian Radars (IVAR)\\"Validation and Integration of Networked Avian Radars: RC-200723\\" project evaluated the functional and performance characteristics of Accipiter® avian radars under operational conditions at Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force airfields. Accipiter avian radar systems operating at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Chicago O'Hare International Airport, and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point made significant contributions to the evaluations carried out in the aforementioned FAA and DoD initiatives. Additional scientific and technical papers on avian radar systems are listed below,Nohara, Tim J., \\"Reducing Bird Strikes – new Radar Networks Can Help Make Skies Safer\\", Journal of Air Traffic Control, Summer 2009Klope, Matthew W., et al., \\"Role of near-miss bird strikes in assessing hazards.\\", Human-Wildlife Interactions, Fall 2009Nohara, Tim J., et al., \\"Avian Stakeholder Management of Bird Strike Risks – Enhancing Communication Processes To Pilots and Air Traffic Controllers for Information Derived From Avian Radar, Summer 2012 and on the Accipiter Radar web site.\\"Accipiter Radar: Avian Scientific Papers\\" A US company, DeTect, in 2003, developed the only production model bird radar in operational use for real-time, tactical bird-aircraft strike avoidance by air traffic controllers. These systems are operational at both commercial airports and military airfields. The system has widely used technology available for bird–aircraft strike hazard (BASH) management and for real-time detection, tracking and alerting of hazardous bird activity at commercial airports, military airfields, and military training and bombing ranges. After extensive evaluation and on-site testing, MERLIN technology was chosen by NASA and was ultimately used for detecting and tracking dangerous vulture activity during the 22 space shuttle launches from 2006 to the conclusion of the program in 2011. The US Air Force has contracted DeTect since 2003 to provide the Avian Hazard Advisory System (AHAS)previously mentioned. TNO, a Dutch R&D; Institute, has developed the successful ROBIN (Radar Observation of Bird Intensity) for the Royal Netherlands Airforce. ROBIN is a near real-time monitoring system for flight movements of birds. ROBIN identifies flocks of birds within the signals of large radar systems. This information is used to give Air Force pilots warning during landing and take-off. Years of observation of bird migration with ROBIN have also provided a better insight into bird migration behavior, which has had an influence on averting collisions with birds, and therefore on flight safety. Since the implementation of the ROBIN system at the Royal Netherlands Airforce the number of collisions between birds and aircraft in the vicinity of military airbases has decreased by more than 50%. There are no civil aviation counterparts to the above military strategies. Some experimentation with small portable radar units has taken place at some airports. However, no standard has been adopted for radar warning nor has any governmental policy regarding warnings been implemented.  History of incidents  Eugene Gilbert in Bleriot XI attacked by eagle over Pyrenees in 1911 depicted in this painting Fw 190D-9 of 10./JG 54 Grünherz, pilot (Leutnant Theo Nibel), downed by a partridge which flew into the nose radiator near Brussels on 1 January 1945 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates bird strikes cost US aviation 400 million dollars annually and have resulted in over 200 worldwide deaths since 1988. In the United Kingdom, the Central Science Laboratory estimates that worldwide, the cost of birdstrikes to airlines is around US$1.2 billion annually. This cost includes direct repair cost and lost revenue opportunities while the damaged aircraft is out of service. Estimating that 80% of bird strikes are unreported, there were 4,300 bird strikes listed by the United States Air Force and 5,900 by US civil aircraft in 2003. The first reported bird strike was by Orville Wright in 1905. According to the Wright Brothers' diaries, \\"Orville [...] flew 4,751 meters in 4 minutes 45 seconds, four complete circles. Twice passed over the fence into Beard's cornfield. Chased flock of birds for two rounds and killed one which fell on top of the upper surface and after a time fell off when swinging a sharp curve.\\" During the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race, French pilot Eugene Gilbert encountered an angry mother eagle over the Pyrenees. Gilbert, flying an open-cockpit Bleriot XI, was able to ward off the large bird by firing pistol shots at it but did not kill it.The Pathfinders c. 1980 by David Nevin for Time-Life booksLa Domenica del Corriere, cover painting depicting Gilbert's encounter with an eagle, 4 July 1911 The first recorded bird strike fatality was reported in 1912 when aero-pioneer Cal Rodgers collided with a gull which became jammed in his aircraft control cables. He crashed at Long Beach, California, was pinned under the wreckage, and drowned. During the 1952 edition of the Carrera Panamericana, eventual race winners Karl Kling and Hans Klenk suffered a bird strike incident when the Mercedes-Benz W194 was struck by a vulture in the windscreen. During a long right-hand bend in the opening stage taken at almost , Kling failed to spot vultures sitting by the side of the road. When the vultures were scattered after hearing the virtually unsilenced W194 coming towards them, one vulture impacted through the windscreen on the passenger side. The impact was enough to briefly knock Klenk unconscious. Despite bleeding badly from facial injuries caused by the shattered windscreen, Klenk ordered Kling to maintain speed, and held on until a tire change almost later to clean himself and the car up. For extra protection, eight vertical steel bars were bolted over the new windscreen. Kling and Klenk also discussed the species and size of the dead bird, agreeing that had had a minimum wingspan and weighed as much as five fattened geese. A Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk after a collision with a common crane (bird), and resulting failure of the windshield The same UH-60, as seen from the inside Alan Stacey's fatal accident during the 1960 Belgian Grand Prix was caused when a bird hit him in the face on lap 25, causing his Lotus 18-Climax to crash at the fast, sweeping right hand Burnenville curve. According to fellow driver Innes Ireland's testimony in a mid-1980s edition of Road & Track magazine, Ireland stated that some spectators claimed that a bird had flown into Stacey's face while he was approaching the curve, possibly knocking him unconscious, or even possibly killing him by breaking his neck or inflicting a fatal head injury, before the car crashed.Thomas O'Keefe, Clark and Gurney, The Best of Both Worlds, Atlas F1, Volume 7, Issue 5. The greatest loss of life directly linked to a bird strike was on October 4, 1960, when a Lockheed L-188 Electra, flying from Boston as Eastern Air Lines Flight 375, flew through a flock of common starlings during take-off, damaging all four engines. The aircraft crashed into Boston harbor shortly after takeoff, with 62 fatalities out of 72 passengers. Subsequently, minimum bird ingestion standards for jet engines were developed by the FAA. NASA astronaut Theodore Freeman was killed in 1964 when a goose shattered the plexiglass cockpit canopy of his Northrop T-38 Talon. Shards were ingested by the engines, leading to a fatal crash. In 1988, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 604 sucked pigeons into both engines during takeoff and then crashed, killing 35 passengers. In 1995, a Dassault Falcon 20 crashed at a Paris airport during an emergency landing attempt after sucking lapwings into an engine, which caused an engine failure and a fire in the airplane's fuselage; all 10 people on board were killed.Transport Canada – Wildlife- strike Costs and Legal Liability On September 22, 1995, a U.S. Air Force Boeing E-3 Sentry AWACS aircraft (Callsign Yukla 27, serial number 77-0354), crashed shortly after takeoff from Elmendorf AFB. The aircraft lost power in both port side engines after these engines ingested several Canada geese during takeoff. It crashed about from the runway, killing all 24 crew members on board. On March 30, 1999, during the inaugural run of the hypercoaster Apollo's Chariot in Virginia, passenger Fabio Lanzoni suffered a bird strike by a goose and required three stitches to his face. The roller coaster has a height of over 200 feet and reaches speeds over 70 miles per hour. On November 28, 2004, the nose landing gear of KLM Flight 1673, a Boeing 737-400, struck a bird during takeoff at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol. The incident was reported to air traffic control, the landing gear was raised normally, and the flight continued normally to its destination. Upon touching down at Barcelona International Airport, the aircraft started deviating to the left of the runway centreline. The crew applied right rudder, braking, and the nose wheel steering tiller but could not keep the aircraft on the runway. After it veered off the paved surface of the runway at about 100 knots, the jet went through an area of soft sand. The nose landing gear leg collapsed and the left main landing gear leg detached from its fittings shortly before the aircraft came to a stop perched over the edge of a drainage canal. All 140 passengers and six crew evacuated safely, but the aircraft itself had to be written off. The cause was discovered to be a broken cable in the nose wheel steering system caused by the bird collision. Contributing to the snapped cable was the improper application of grease during routine maintenance which led to severe wear of the cable. In April 2007, a Thomsonfly Boeing 757 from Manchester Airport to Lanzarote Airport suffered a bird strike when at least one bird, supposedly a crow, was ingested by the starboard engine. The plane landed safely back at Manchester Airport a while later. The incident was captured by two plane spotters on opposite sides of the airport, as well as the emergency calls picked up by a plane spotter's radio. The Space Shuttle Discovery also hit a bird (a vulture) during the launch of STS-114 on July 26, 2005, although the collision occurred soon after lift-off and at low speed, with no obvious damage to the shuttle. On November 10, 2008, Ryanair Flight 4102 from Frankfurt to Rome made an emergency landing at Ciampino Airport after multiple bird strikes caused both engines to fail. After touchdown, the left main landing gear collapsed, and the aircraft briefly veered off the runway. Passengers and crew were evacuated through the starboard emergency exits. On January 4, 2009, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter hit a red-tailed hawk in Louisiana. The hawk hit the helicopter just above the windscreen. The impact forced the activation of the engine fire suppression control handles, retarding the throttles and causing the engines to lose power. Eight of the nine people on board died in the subsequent crash; the survivor, a passenger, was seriously injured. On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte/Douglas International Airport ditched into the Hudson River after experiencing a loss of both turbines. It is suspected that the engine failure was caused by running into a flock of geese at an altitude of about , shortly after takeoff. All 150 passengers and 5 crew members were safely evacuated after a successful water landing.US Airways Plane Crashes Into Hudson River On May 28, 2010, the NTSB published its final report into the accident. On August 15, 2019, Ural Airlines Flight 178 from Moscow–Zhukovsky to Simferopol, Crimea, suffered a bird strike after taking off from Zhukovsky and crash landed in a cornfield 5 kilometers past the airport. About 70 people were injured, all with minor injuries. Bug strikes Flying insect strikes, like bird strikes, have been encountered by pilots since aircraft were invented. Future United States Air Force general Henry H. Arnold, as a young officer, nearly lost control of his Wright Model B in 1911 after a bug flew into his eye while he was not wearing goggles, distracting him. In 1986, a Boeing B-52 Stratofortress on a low-level training mission entered a swarm of locusts. The insects' impacts on the aircraft's windscreens rendered the crew unable to see, forcing them to abort the mission and fly using the aircraft's instruments alone. The aircraft eventually landed safely. In 2010, the Australian Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) issued a warning to pilots about the potential dangers of flying through a locust swarm. CASA warned that the insects could cause loss of engine power and loss of visibility, and blocking of an aircraft's pitot tubes, causing inaccurate airspeed readings. Bug strikes can also affect the operation of machinery on the ground, especially motorcycles. The team on the US TV show MythBusters – in a 2010 episode entitled \\"Bug Special\\" – concluded that death could occur if a motorist were hit by a flying insect of sufficient mass in a vulnerable part of the body. Anecdotal evidence from motorcyclists supports pain, bruising, soreness, stings, and loss of seat caused by collision with an insect at speed.

Raymond-Roger lived in the Château Comtal in the fortified hill town of Carcassonne. The château was built by his ancestors in the 11th century. Raymond-Roger was not a Cathar, although many of his subjects were. He adopted a laissez-faire attitude to Catharism – and to other cultures and religions. He relied strongly on Jews to run Béziers, his second seat of power. By mid-1209, at the beginning of the Albigensian Crusade, around 10,000 crusaders had gathered in Lyon and began to march south. In June, Raymond of Toulouse, recognizing the potential disaster at hand, promised to act against the Cathars, and his excommunication was lifted. The crusaders headed towards Montpellier and the lands of Raymond-Roger de Trencavel, aiming for the Cathar communities around Albi and Carcassonne. Like Raymond VI of Toulouse, Raymond-Roger de Trencavel sought an accommodation with the crusaders, but Raymond-Roger was refused a meeting and raced back to Carcassonne to prepare his defences. The city of Béziers was sacked in July and its population massacred. The town of Carcassonne was well fortified, but vulnerable and over-populated with refugees. The crusaders, led by a papal legate, Arnaud Amaury, Abbot of Cîteaux, arrived outside the town on August 1, 1209. As vassal of King Peter II of Aragon, Raymond-Roger had hoped for protection, but Peter was powerless to oppose Pope Innocent III's army and could act only as a mediator. The siege did not last long. By August 7 the crusaders had cut the town's access to water. Raymond-Roger accepted a safe- conduct to negotiate terms of surrender in the Crusader camp. At the conclusion of these negotiations he was taken prisoner while still under safe conduct, and imprisoned in his own dungeon, where he died, possibly of dysentery, though there were suspicions of poisoning. The town of Carcassonne had surrendered on August 15. The inhabitants were not massacred but were forced to leave the town. Simon de Montfort was granted control of the area encompassing Carcassonne, Albi, and Béziers. Raymond-Roger's dispossessed son, Raymond II (1204-1263), formally ceded his rights to Louis IX of France in 1247, after several failed attempts to recover his patrimony. Portrayals in Fiction Some authors have identified Raymond Roger with Percival of legend. Some claim this identification was exposed, albeit esoterically, by Wolfram von Eschenbach in his Parzival in the middle of the thirteenth century. This identification has been favoured in more recent years by Otto Rahn in his Crusade Against the Grail, Peter Berling in various works in his series The Children of the Grail, Jean Blum in Mystère et message des Cathares, and Joaquín Javaloys in his historical novel Yo, Parsifal: el mítico caballero del Grial. His appearance in film, so far, has been limited to the mini-series adaption of Kate Mosse's Labyrinth, in which he was portrayed by Tom Felton, who plays him as a fair, even-minded lord with compassion for those of the minority Albigensian (or Cathar) religious sect.

Continuing the policy set by its predecessor You Can All Join In, the album presented tracks from the latest albums by established artists including Free, Traffic, and Jethro Tull, and introduced tasters from newer signings to the label, notably Nick Drake and King Crimson. The inclusion of the Nick Drake track, \\"Time Has Told Me\\", has been credited with providing the first opportunity for many record buyers to hear Drake's music.Patrick Humphries, Nick Drake, Bloomsbury Publishing, 1998, p.111 It was priced as low as 14 shillings and 6 pence (£0.72), less than half of the standard album price at the time. The album is described at Allmusic.com as a \\"somewhat incoherent sampler of folk-rock, prog rock, and prog-tinged hard rock\\", but with a \\"stellar artist lineup\\".

It was one of a number of Führer Headquarters throughout Europe, and the most easterly ever used by Hitler in person.  Naming  The name is derived from Werwolf or Wehrwolf in German, which can be translated as werewolf. The Nazis also used the term Werwolf as a codename for clandestine resistance groups which were intended to carry out guerrilla attacks against the occupying forces towards the end of World War II. The naming scheme is in accord with other code-names given to Führerhauptquartiere during the Second World War, such as Wolfsschanze. Several were named for Hitler himself, whose nickname was Wolf. The site was also the easternmost Wehrmacht headquarters. Headquarters  The complex was located in a pine forest, about north of Vinnytsia in Ukraine, between the villages of Stryzhavka and Kolo-Mikhailovka on the Kyiv highway. It was built between December 1941 and June 1942 under top secret conditions by Soviet prisoners of war. The location may have been influenced by the Nazis' proposed trans-European highway to the Crimean Peninsula, which would have connected with the site. The Wehrmacht had its regional headquarters in Vinnytsia, and the Luftwaffe had a strong presence at their airbase in Kalinovka, about 20 km away. Hitler's accommodation at Werwolf (the Führerhaus) consisted of a modest log cabin built around a private courtyard with its own concrete bunker. The rest of the complex consisted of about 20 wooden cottages and barracks and up to three \\"B\\" class bunkers, surrounded by ring of barbed wire and ground defensive positions connected by tunnels. A couple of observation points were set up on platforms in the oak trees surrounding the pine forest. The area was surrounded by a defensive strip of bunkers, anti-aircraft guns and tanks, as well as anti-tank ditches and minefields. There was a tea house, a barber shop, a bathhouse, a sauna, a cinema and a swimming pool, primarily intended for Hitler who never used it. The facility also contained a large vegetable garden organised by the German horticultural company Zeidenspiner to provide Hitler with a secure supply of food. Hitler's personal chef selected his vegetables and the food was chemically analyzed before being tried by a taster because of Hitler's fear of poisoning. Oxygen tanks were also available at Hitler's insistence. Water for the site was provided by artesian wells while power was provided by a generator. Some historians, including Lloyd Clark, indicate that some buildings were connected by tunnels. The bunkers were constructed by Organisation Todt using some local Ukrainian workers, forced labour but mainly Soviet prisoners of war. The code name for the secret construction project was Anlage Eichenhain (Camp Oak Grove). The complex was served by a daily three- hour flight connection from Berlin to the airfield in Kalinovka 20km from the compound. There was also a regular train connection from Berlin-Charlottenburg to \\"Eichenbein\\" station at Werwolf. The journey took 34 hours. During his Eastern campaign, Adolf Hitler lived mainly at FHQ Wolfsschanze (near Rastenburg, East Prussia) but he stayed at FHQ Werwolf three times: * 16 July to 30 October 1942. The weather was hot, up to 45 °C, and the bunkers were humid. Hitler caught severe influenza, with a temperature running up to 40 °C. In this condition he gave his fateful Führer Directive 45, splitting Army Group South into two parts, trying to reach both Stalingrad and the Caucasus oil fields simultaneously. * 19 February to 13 March 1943, to observe Field Marshal Erich von Manstein's Kharkhov offensive in the wake of Germany's defeat at Stalingrad. * 27 August to 15 September 1943, to observe the unsuccessful defense of Kharkhov. History The Nazis destroyed the site, including mining access to the underground complex, on abandoning the region. The site was examined after the Nazi departure in March 1944 under the orders of Joseph Stalin, but no documentation was found. The Soviet Union took steps to permanently seal the underground parts of the complex. Today only the swimming pool and concrete fragments remain visible on the site, which is an open recreation area.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=luMXkT-YslY The site can be visited but plans to create a full-fledged museum had not come to fruition as of August 2018. Nearby is a memorial to the thousands of labourers and others buried by the Nazis in gravepits at Stryzhavka.

It is considered one of the quintessential handbooks of Jewish thought. The text covers a vast gamut of philosophical topics in the vast spectrum of classical Judaism's outlook on the world. These topics include: The purpose of creation, the Creator, human responsibility, the spiritual realms, providence, Israel and the nations, astrology, the human soul, theurgy, prophecy, the study of Torah, prayer, and the function of mitzvah observance. All these are brought in a clear flowing structure that builds on previous topics.  Principles  The text systematizes the basic principles of Jewish belief regarding the existence of God, God's purpose in creation, and the logical consequence of other concepts in Judaism. The reader is led from thought to idea, from idea to a logical whole of the structure of Jewish belief. One of its core assertions is that man was created for the purpose of earning closeness to the creator by struggling against evil inclinations. According to Luzzatto, the world calls for mesiras nefesh in order to retain sanctity and overcome evil. This is the concept interpreted as the \\"devotion to Hashem to the extent of total self- negation\\". It, therefore, outlines ideals concerning daily living. For instance, it maintains that hashem increases self-esteem whereas dependence on others for sustenance diminishes it. Presented from a Kabbalistic perspective, yet presupposing no prior knowledge and without the use of Kabbalistic terminology, this work provides a foundation for understanding the worldview and ideas found in the throughout Jewish works on these topics. The book is organized into four main sections: the general basis of all existence, God's Divine Providence and interface with Creation, prophecy and the Human soul, and practical religious observance.

It was officially founded by the disaffected Silla general Gyeon Hwon in 900, and fell to Wang Geon's Goryeo army in 936. Its capital was at Jeonju, in present-day North Jeolla province. Most of information now available about the kingdom comes from the accounts found in the Samguk Yusa and Samguk Sagi, which largely coincide.  Background  When it began with his attack on Mujinju in 892, Gyeon Hwon's rebellion was only one among numerous rebellions which sprouted up against the weak Silla rulers in the late 9th century. Many of these rebellions were initially triggered by the Silla decision to use force to collect taxes on the peasantry in 889 (Lee, 1984, p. 98). At this time most of the power on the peninsula was held by local gentry, who lacked strong loyalty to the central government. It was thus fairly easy for rebellions led by disaffected military officials to gain steam. In its name, Hubaekje sought to establish itself as the legitimate successor to the ancient kingdom of Baekje which had ruled the southwestern Korean peninsula until conquered by Silla in 660.  Internal affairs  For all but the last year of its existence, Hubaekje was ruled by Gyeon Hwon, and his personal style of rule played a key role in the kingdom's fate. After declaring himself king, Gyeon Hwon took numerous wives, and is said to have had 10 sons by them in addition to the eight borne by his first wife. This laid the groundwork for the strife which ended the kingdom's existence. In 935, Gyeon Hwon chose his fourth son Geumgang over the elder sons as the crown prince of Hubaekje. At this the eldest son, Singeom, conspiring with his brothers, had his father confined to Geumsansa in Gimje. Singeom killed Prince Geumgang and took the throne for himself. However, Gyeon Hwon escaped to Goryeo.  Military affairs  For much of its existence, Hubaekje was troubled by Wang Geon's naval raids in Naju region. These worked to disrupt trade and diplomatic ties with Southern Chinese kingdoms. Hubaekje possessed considerable military strength, and Lee (1984, p. 99) writes of Gyeon Hwon that \\"Had Gung Ye and Wang Geon not stood in his way, he surely would have had little difficulty in toppling Silla.\\" Hubaekje showed its greatest strength in 927. In that year its armies attacked and pillaged the Silla capital at Gyeongju, slaying King Gyeongae and establishing King Gyeongsun as the ruler. Before the attack, Silla had sent for aid from Goryeo, and Wang Geon arrived with a large army shortly after Gyeongju was taken. The two armies met near Palgong Mountain in present-day Daegu. Wang Geon's forces in the battle reportedly numbered 10,000 men. Hubaekje triumphed, and Wang Geon himself only escaped through the daring self-sacrifice of his general Shin Sung-gyeom and Kim Nak. However, when the two armies met again at the Battle of Gochang near Andong in 930, Goryeo scored a decisive victory. Hubaekje was pushed back into its heartland, and there suffered a further crippling defeat at Hongseong in 934.  Diplomatic ties  As Wang Geon sought to maintain legitimacy through diplomatic ties with northern China, Gyeon Hwon strove to do the same by maintaining ties with the rulers of southern China, particularly Wuyue. However, because Hubaekje's existence largely coincided with the turbulent Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period in China, neither side was able to parlay these ties into military support.  Fall  After he was deposed by his sons in 935 and fled to Goryeo, Gyeon Hwon himself came to lead the armies against Hubaekje. Together with Wang Geon, the Samguk Yusa reports that he led an army of 100,000 against his former kingdom.Il-yeon: Samguk Yusa: Legends and History of the Three Kingdoms of Ancient Korea, translated by Tae-Hung Ha and Grafton K. Mintz. Book Two, page 135f. Silk Pagoda (2006). The Goryeo and Hubaekje armies met at Seonsan, today part of Gumi in North Gyeongsang province, and the Hubaekje forces were destroyed. Hubaekje thus finally fell in 936, one year after King Gyeongsun had surrendered Silla to Wanggeon. The battle of Seonsan thus marked the end of the Later Three Kingdoms period. In his own characteristically open-handed style, Wang Geon conferred a title upon the defeated leader Singeom. Singeom's younger brothers Yanggeom and Yonggeom, who were judged to have been to blame for the coup d'etat, were sent into exile.

Along with the Presidency armies, later the Indian Army, and from 1932 the Indian Air Force, it was one of the Armed Forces of British India. From its origins in 1612 as the East India Company's Marine, the Navy underwent various changes, including changes to its name. Over time it was named the Bombay Marine (1686), the Bombay Marine Corps (1829), the Indian Navy (1830), Her Majesty's Indian Navy (1858), the Bombay and Bengal Marine (1863), the Indian Defence Force (1871), Her Majesty's Indian Marine (1877) and the Royal Indian Marine (1892). It was finally named the Royal Indian Navy in 1934. However, it remained a relatively small force until the Second World War, when it was greatly expanded. After the partition of India into two independent states in 1947, the Navy was split between Pakistan and India. One-third of the assets and personnel were assigned to Royal Pakistan Navy. Approximately two thirds of the fleet remained with the Union of India, as did all land assets within its territory. This force, still under the name of \\"Royal Indian Navy\\", became the navy of the Dominion of India until the country became a republic on 26 January 1950. It was then renamed the Indian Navy.

This led the Company to build a port and to establish a small navy based at Suvali, in Surat, Gujarat, to protect its trade routes. The Company named the force the 'Honourable East India Company's Marine', and the first fighting ships arrived on 5 September 1612.Harbans Singh Bhatia, Military History of British India, 1607-1947 (1977), p. 15 This force protected merchant shipping off the Gulf of Cambay and the rivers Tapti and Narmada. The ships also helped map the coastlines of India, Persia and Arabia.Charles Rathbone Low, History of the Indian Navy: (1613-1863) (R. Bentley & Son, 1877) During the 17th century, the small naval fleet consisted of a few English warships and a large number of locally built gunboats of two types, ghurabs and gallivats, crewed by local fishermen. The larger ghurabs were heavy, shallow-draft gunboats of 300 tons (bm) each, and carried six 9 to 12-pounder guns; the smaller gallivats were about 70 tons (bm) each and carried six 2 to 4-pounder guns.Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950 (1986), p. 36 In 1635, the East India Company established a shipyard at Surat, where they built four pinnaces and a few larger vessels to supplement their fleet.Singh 1986, p. 40 In 1686, with most of the English commerce moving to Bombay, the force was renamed the \\"Bombay Marine\\". This force fought the Marathas and the Sidis and took part in the Anglo-Burmese Wars. While it recruited Indian sailors extensively, it had no Indian commissioned officers. Commodore William James was appointed to command the Marine in 1751. On 2 April 1755, commanding the Bombay Marine's ship Protector, he attacked the Maratha fortress of Tulaji Angre at Severndroog between Bombay and Goa. James had instructions only to blockade the stronghold, but he was able to get close enough to bombard and destroy it. In February 1756, the Marine supported the capture of Gheriah (Vijaydurg Fort) by Robert Clive and Admiral Watson, and was active in skirmishes against the French, helping to consolidate the British position in India. In 1809, a fleet of 12 ships of the Marine bombarded the city of Ras al-Khaimah, a pirate stronghold, in an unsuccessful attempt to quell Arab piracy. A subsequent mission in 1819 with 11 vessels proved successful in blockading the city for four days, after which the tribal chieftain surrendered. In 1829, the \\"Bombay Marine\\" received the additional name of \\"Corps\\", and also received its first steam-powered vessel in that year, , of 411 tons. Steaming from Bombay on 20 March 1830, Hugh Lindsay reached Suez after 21 days under steam (plus coaling stops at Aden, Mocha, and Jeddah), at an average speed of six knots.Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950 (1986), p. 40-41 Between 1830 and 1854 the Indian Navy was responsible for maintaining mail service on the Bombay and Suez leg of the \\"overland route\\" (England–Alexandria. Alexandria–Suez overland, and Suez–Bombay). 1830–1858 In 1830, the Bombay Marine was renamed the \\"Indian Navy\\". The British capture of Aden in the Aden Expedition increased its commitments, leading to the creation of the \\"Indus Flotilla\\". The Navy then took part in the First Opium War of 1840. By 1845, the Indian Navy had completed the conversion from sail to steam. In 1848, an Indian Navy contingent of 100 ratings and seven officers took part in the Siege of Multan during the Anglo-Sikh War.Rear Admiral Satyindra Singh AVSM, Under Two Ensigns: The Indian Navy 1945-1950 (1986), p. 42 In 1852, at the outset of the Second Anglo-Burmese War, ships of Her Majesty's Indian Navy joined a Royal Navy force under the command of Admiral Charles Austen to assist General Godwin in the capture of Martaban and Rangoon.Edmund Burke, ed., The Annual Register of the Year 1852 (Longmans, Green, 1853), p. 283 =Direct British rule in India= After the end of Company rule in India following the Indian rebellion of 1857, the force came under the command of the British government of India and was formally named \\"Her Majesty's Indian Navy\\". 1858–1934 Her Majesty's Indian Navy resumed the name \\"Bombay Marine\\" from 1863 to 1877, when it was renamed \\"Her Majesty's Indian Marine\\" (HMIM). The Marine then had two divisions; an Eastern Division at Calcutta and a Western Division at Bombay. In recognition of its fighting services, HMIM was given the title of \\"Royal Indian Marine\\" in 1892. By this time it consisted of over fifty vessels.Genesis at indiannavy.nic.in In 1905, the service was described as having \\"Government vessels engaged in troop-ship, surveying, police or revenue duties in the East Indies\\".Archibald Greig Cowie, The sea services of the empire as fields for employment (1905), p. 246 When mines were detected off the coasts of Bombay and Aden, during the First World War, the Royal Indian Marine went into action with a fleet of minesweepers, patrol vessels and troop carriers. Besides patrolling, the Marine ferried troops and carried war stores from India to Mesopotamia (now Iraq), Egypt and East Africa. The first Indian to be granted a commission was Engineer Sub-Lieutenant D. N. Mukherji, who joined the Royal Indian Marine as an officer on 6 January 1923.D. J. E. Collins, The Royal Indian Navy, 1939-45, vol. 1 (Bombay, 1964), p. 8 1934–1945 In 1934 the Royal Indian Marine changed its name, with the enactment of the Indian Navy (Discipline) Act of 1934. The Royal Indian Navy was formally inaugurated on 2 October 1934, at Bombay.Bhatia (1977), p. 28 Its ships carried the prefix HMIS, for His Majesty's Indian Ship.D. J. E. Collins, The Royal Indian Navy, 1939-45, vol. 1 (Bombay, 1964) At the start of the Second World War, the Royal Indian Navy was small, with only eight warships. The onset of the war led to an expansion in vessels and personnel described by one writer as \\"phenomenal\\". By 1943 the strength of the RIN had reached twenty thousand. During the War, the Women's Royal Indian Naval Service was established, for the first time giving women a role in the navy, although they did not serve on board its ships. The sloops and played a role in Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily.Inmed Mutiny of 1946 In February 1946, Indian sailors launched the Royal Indian Navy Mutiny on board more than fifty ships and in shore establishments, protesting about alleged discrimination against Indian sailors and officers by the British during the war.Christopher M. Bell, Bruce A. Elleman, Naval mutinies of the twentieth century: an international perspective (2003), p. 6: \\"The first navy to experience a major mutiny after the Second World War was the Royal Indian Navy. For five days in February 1946, Indian sailors rose up against their predominantly British officer corps: approximately 56 ships...\\" The mutiny found widespread support and spread all over India, including elements in the Army and the Air Force. A total of seventy-eight ships, twenty shore establishments and 20,000 sailors were involved in this mutiny. =Independence and Partition of India, 1947= On 1 March 1947, the designation of \\"Flag Officer Commanding, Royal Indian Navy\\" was replaced with that of \\"Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.\\" Following India's independence in 1947 and the ensuing partition, the Royal Indian Navy was divided between the newly independent Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, and the Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee divided the ships and men of the Royal Indian Navy between India and Pakistan. The division of the ships was on the basis of two-thirds of the fleet to India, one third to Pakistan.Bhatia (1977), p. 28: \\"Consequent on the partition of the country on 15 August 1947, two thirds of the undivided fleet and associated assets came to India.\\" The committee allocated to the Royal Pakistan Navy (RPN) three of the seven active sloops, , and , four of the ten serviceable minesweepers, two frigates, two naval trawlers, four harbour launches and a number of Harbour Defence Motor Launches. 358 personnel, and 180 officers, most of whom were Muslims or Europeans, volunteered to transfer to the RPN. India retained the remainder of the RIN's assets and personnel, and many British officers opted to continue serving in the RIN. On 21 June 1948, the additional designation of \\"Chief of the Naval Staff\\" was added before that of \\"Commander-in-Chief, Royal Indian Navy.\\" On 26 January 1950, when India adopted its current constitution and became a republic, the Royal Indian Navy was renamed the Indian Navy. The Union Jack in the canton of the White Ensign was replaced with the Flag of India. Its vessels were redesignated as \\"Indian Naval Ships\\", and the \\"HMIS\\" ship prefix for existing vessels was changed to 'INS'.Indian and Foreign Review, vol 3 (Indian Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Publications Division, 1965), p. 65: \\"The residual part which continued as the Royal Indian Navy had to face many problems, specially regarding personnel.

This helped him to act as a skilled diplomat, dealing with the Ashikaga shogunate and deputies of the emperor. In 1533, a well-known regent Yamashina Tokitsugu visited Owari Province the domain of the Oda clan. Finding the reception prepared by Masahide superb, Tokitsugu praised Masahide's knowledge highly. Other signs of his importance as a diplomat can be found in the fact that he paid a visit to Kyoto in the name of Nobuhide to offer the funds needed to repair the Emperor's residence . When Nobuhide's son Nobunaga was born in 1534, Masahide became the second highest ranking Karō as well as the tutor of the newborn heir. In 1547 Nobunaga finished his coming-of-age ceremony, and on the occasion of his first battle, Masahide served beside him. The next year, he exerted himself to establish peace between Nobuhide and his agelong rival Saitō Dōsan of Mino Province, and to arrange the marriage between Nobunaga and Dōsan's daughter Nōhime. This move made it possible for the Oda clan to concentrate on the fight against the Imagawa clan. Masahide served the Oda family faithfully in many ways, but he was also deeply troubled by Nobunaga's eccentricity. After Nobuhide's death, discord in the clan increased and so did Masahide's concern about the future of his master. Masahide committed (kanshi) to startle Nobunaga into his obligations.

He is known as the captain of the vessel that rescued marooned Alexander Selkirk, whose plight is generally believed to have inspired Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe. Rogers came from an affluent seafaring family, grew up in Poole and Bristol, and served a marine apprenticeship to a Bristol sea captain. His father held shares in many ships, but he died when Rogers was in his mid-twenties, leaving Rogers in control of the family shipping business. In 1707, Rogers was approached by Captain William Dampier, who sought support for a privateering voyage against the Spanish, with whom the British were at war. Rogers led the expedition, which consisted of two well-armed ships, Duke and Duchess, and was the captain of Duke. In three years, Rogers and his men went around the world, capturing several ships in the Pacific Ocean. En route, the expedition rescued Selkirk, finding him on Juan Fernández Island on 1 February 1709. When the expedition returned to England in October 1711, Rogers had circumnavigated the globe, while retaining his original ships and most of his men, and the investors in the expedition doubled their money. The expedition made Rogers a national hero, but his brother was killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew on the grounds that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book A Cruising Voyage Round the World, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue. Rogers was twice appointed Governor of the Bahamas, where he succeeded in warding off threats from the Spanish, and in ridding the colony of pirates. His first term as governor was financially ruinous, and on his return to England, he was imprisoned for debt. During his second term as governor, Rogers died in Nassau at the age of about 53. Early life Woodes Rogers was the eldest son and heir of Woods Rogers, a successful merchant captain. Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. At 18, Rogers was somewhat old to be starting a seven-year apprenticeship. His biographer, Brian Little, suggests that this might have been a way for the newcomers to become part of Bristol maritime society, as well as making it possible for Woodes Rogers to become a freeman, or voting citizen, of the city. Little also suggests that it is likely that Rogers gained his maritime experience with Yeamans' ship on the Newfoundland fleet. Rogers completed his apprenticeship in November 1704. =Marriage and family= The following January Rogers married Sarah Whetstone, daughter of Rear Admiral Sir William Whetstone, who was a neighbour and close family friend. Rogers became a freeman of Bristol because of his marriage into the prominent Whetstone family. In 1706, Captain Rogers died at sea, leaving his ships and business to his son Woodes. Between 1706 and the end of 1708, Woodes and Sarah Rogers had a son and two daughters. Privateering expedition =Preparation and the early voyage= William Dampier The War of the Spanish Succession started in 1702, during which England's main maritime foes were France and Spain, and a number of Bristol ships were given letters of marque, allowing them to strike against enemy shipping. At least four vessels in which Rogers had an ownership interest were granted the letters. One, Whetstone Galley, named for Rogers' father in law, received the letters before being sent to Africa to begin a voyage in the slave trade. It did not reach Africa, but was captured by the French. Rogers suffered other losses against the French, although he does not record their extent in his book. He turned to privateering as a means of recouping these losses. In late 1707, Rogers was approached by William Dampier, a navigator and friend of Rogers' father, who proposed a privateering expedition against the Spanish. This was a desperate move on the part of Captain Dampier to save his career. Dampier had recently returned from leading a two-ship privateering expedition into the Pacific, which culminated in a series of mutinies before both ships finally sank due to Dampier's error in not having the hulls properly protected against worms before leaving port. Unaware of this, Rogers agreed. Financing was provided by many in the Bristol community, including Thomas Goldney II of the Quaker Goldney family and Thomas Dover, who would become president of the voyage council and Rogers' father in law. Commanding two frigates, Duke and Duchess, and captaining the first, Rogers spent three years circumnavigating the globe. The ships departed Bristol on 1 August 1708. Dampier was aboard as Rogers' sailing master. Rogers encountered various problems along the way. Forty of the Bristol crew deserted or were dismissed, and he spent a month in Ireland recruiting replacements and having the vessels prepared for sea. Many crew members were Dutch, Danish, or other foreigners. Some of the crew mutinied after Rogers refused to let them plunder a neutral Swedish vessel. When the mutiny was put down, he had the leader flogged, put in irons, and sent to England aboard another ship. The less culpable mutineers were given lighter punishments, such as reduced rations. The ships intended to force the chilly Drake Passage off the tip of South America, but expedition leaders soon realised that they were short of warm clothing and alcohol, which was then believed to warm those exposed to cold. Considering the latter the more important problem, the expedition made a stop at Tenerife to stock up on the local wine, and later sewed the ships' blankets into cold weather gear. The ships experienced a difficult inter- oceanic passage; they were forced to almost 62° South latitude, which, according to Rogers, \\"for ought we know is the furthest that any one has yet been to the southward\\". At their furthest south, they were closer to as-yet- undiscovered Antarctica than to South America. =Rescue of Selkirk and raids on the Spanish= Rogers' men search Spanish ladies for their jewels in Guayaquil Rogers stocked his ships with limes to fend off scurvy, a practice not universally accepted at that time. After the ships reached the Pacific Ocean, their provisions of limes were exhausted and seven men died of the vitamin deficiency disease. Dampier was able to guide the ships to little- known Juan Fernández Island to replenish supplies of fresh produce. On 1 February 1709, as they neared the island, the sailors spotted a fire ashore and feared that it might be a shore party from a Spanish vessel. The next morning Rogers sent a party ashore and discovered that the fire was from Scottish sailor Alexander Selkirk, who had been stranded there four years previously. Selkirk was to become an inspiration for the classic novel Robinson Crusoe, written by Rogers' friend, Daniel Defoe. Rogers found Selkirk to be \\"wild-looking\\" and \\"wearing goatskins\\", noting in his journal, \\"He had with him his clothes and bedding, with a firelock, some powder, bullets and tobacco, a hatchet, a knife, a kettle, a Bible and books.\\" Selkirk, who had been part of the ship's crew that abandoned Dampier after losing confidence in his leadership, was now more than willing to join a flotilla that included his old commodore as ship's pilot. Selkirk served as a mate aboard the Duke, and was later given command of one of the prize ships taken by the expedition. After leaving Juan Fernández on 14 February 1709, the expedition captured and looted a number of small vessels, and launched an attack on the town of Guayaquil, today located in Ecuador. When Rogers attempted to negotiate with the governor, the townsfolk secreted their valuables. Rogers was able to get a modest ransom for the town, but some crew members were so dissatisfied that they dug up the recently dead hoping to find items of value. This led to sickness on board ship, of which six men died. The expedition lost contact with one of the captured ships, which was under the command of Simon Hatley. The other vessels searched for Hatley's ship, but to no avail—Hatley and his men were captured by the Spanish. On a subsequent voyage to the Pacific, Hatley would emulate Selkirk by becoming the centre of an event which would be immortalised in literature. His ship beset by storms, Hatley shot an albatross in the hope of better winds, an episode memorialised by Samuel Taylor Coleridge. The crew of the vessels became increasingly discontented, and Rogers and his officers feared another mutiny. This tension was dispelled by the expedition's capture of a rich prize off the coast of Mexico: the Spanish vessel Nuestra Señora de la Encarnación y Desengaño. Rogers sustained a wound to the face in the battle. While Duke and Duchess were successful in capturing that vessel, they failed to capture Encarnación companion, a well-armed galleon, Nuestra Señora de Begoña, which made its escape after damaging both vessels. Rogers only reluctantly agreed to giving the inexperienced Captain Dover command of Encarnación, a decision that may have been eased by naming Selkirk as its sailing master. The privateers, accompanied by their two prizes, limped across the Pacific Ocean. The expedition was able to resupply at Guam, which, though governed by the Spanish, extended a cordial welcome to the privateers. =Homeward voyage= The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the River Thames on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company £6,000 (about £ at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained £1,600 (now worth perhaps £) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. The long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive. After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe. While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose—to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \\"such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \\"within the limits of the South Sea Company\\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke. Governor and later life =Financial difficulties and the Bahamas proposal= Statue of Woodes Rogers outside the Hilton British Colonial Hotel, Nassau Rogers encountered financial problems on his return. Sir William Whetstone had died, and Rogers, having failed to recoup his business losses through privateering, was forced to sell his Bristol home to support his family. He was successfully sued by a group of over 200 of his crew, who stated that they had not received their fair share of the expedition profits. The profits from his book were not enough to overcome these setbacks, and he was forced into bankruptcy. His wife gave birth to their fourth child a year after his return—a boy who died in infancy—and Woodes and Sarah Rogers soon permanently separated. Rogers decided the way out of his financial difficulty was to lead another expedition, this time against pirates. In 1713, Rogers led what was ostensibly an expedition to purchase slaves in Madagascar and take them to the Dutch East Indies, this time with the permission of the British East India Company. Rogers' secondary purpose was to gather details on the pirates of Madagascar, hoping to destroy or reform them, and colonise Madagascar on a future trip. Rogers collected information regarding pirates and their vessels near the island. Finding that a large number of the pirates had gone native, he persuaded many of them to sign a petition to Queen Anne asking her for clemency. While Rogers' expedition was profitable, when it returned to London in 1715, the British East India Company vetoed the idea of a colonial expedition to Madagascar, believing a colony was a greater threat to its monopoly than a few pirates. Accordingly, Rogers turned his sights from Madagascar to the West Indies. His connections included several of the advisers to the new king, George I, who had succeeded Queen Anne in 1714, and Rogers was able to forge an agreement for a company to manage the Bahamas, which were infested with pirates, in exchange for a share of the colony's profits. At the time, according to the Governor of Bermuda, the Bahamas were \\"without any face or form of Government\\" and the colony was a \\"sink or nest of infamous rascals\\". Until Rogers obtained his commission, the islands had been nominally governed by absentee Lords Proprietor, who did little except appoint a new, powerless governor when the position fell vacant. Under the agreement that underlay Rogers' commission, the Lords Proprietor leased their rights for a token sum to Rogers' company for twenty-one years. On 5 January 1718, a proclamation was issued announcing clemency for all piratical offences, provided that those seeking what became known as the \\"King's Pardon\\" surrendered not later than 5 September 1718. Colonial governors and deputy governors were authorised to grant the pardon. Rogers was officially appointed \\"Captain General and Governor in Chief\\" by George I on 6 January 1718. He did not leave immediately for his new bailiwick, but spent several months preparing the expedition, which included seven ships, 100 soldiers, 130 colonists, and supplies ranging from food for the expedition members and ships' crews to religious pamphlets to give to the pirates, whom Rogers believed would respond to spiritual teachings. On 22 April 1718, the expedition, accompanied by three Royal Navy vessels, sailed out of the Thames. =First term= The expedition arrived on 22 July 1718, surprising and trapping a ship commanded by pirate Charles Vane. After negotiations failed, Vane used a captured French vessel as a fireship in an attempt to ram the naval vessels. The attempt failed, but the naval vessels were forced out of the west end of Nassau harbour, giving Vane's crew an opportunity to raid the town and secure the best local pilot. Vane and his men then escaped in a small sloop via the harbour's narrow east entrance. The pirates had evaded the trap, but Nassau and New Providence Island were in Rogers' hands. Charles Vane At the time, the island's population consisted of about two hundred former pirates and several hundred fugitives who had escaped from nearby Spanish colonies. Rogers organised a government, granted the King's Pardon to those former pirates on the island who had not yet accepted it, and started to rebuild the island's fortifications, which had fallen into decrepitude under pirate domination. Less than a month into his residence on New Providence, Rogers was faced with a double threat: Vane wrote, threatening to join with Edward Teach (better known as Blackbeard) to retake the island, and Rogers learned that the Spanish also planned to drive the British out of the Bahamas. Rogers' expedition suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed almost a hundred of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor there never arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise he had no intention of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work. On 14 September 1718, Rogers received word that Vane was at Green Turtle Cay near Abaco, about north of Nassau. Some of the pardoned pirates on New Providence took boats to join Vane, and Rogers decided to send two ex-pirate captains, Benjamin Hornigold and John Cockram, with a crew to gather intelligence, and, if possible, to bring Vane to battle. As the weeks passed, and hopes of their return dimmed, Rogers declared martial law and set all inhabitants to work on rebuilding the island's fortifications. Finally, the former pirates returned. They had failed to find an opportunity to kill Vane or bring him to battle, but had captured one ship and a number of pirate captives. Captain Hornigold was then sent to recapture the ships and crews who had gone pirate en route to Havana. He returned with ten prisoners, including captain John Auger, and three corpses. On 9 December 1718, Rogers brought the ten men captured by Hornigold to trial. Nine were convicted, and Rogers had eight hanged three days later, reprieving the ninth on hearing he was of good family. One of the condemned, Thomas Morris, quipped as he climbed the gallows, \\"We have a good governor, but a harsh one.\\" The executions so cowed the populace that when, shortly after Christmas, several residents plotted to overthrow Rogers and restore the island to piracy, the conspirators attracted little support. Rogers had them flogged, then released as harmless. On 16 March 1719 Rogers learned that Spain and Britain were at war again. He redoubled his efforts to repair the island's fortifications, buying vital supplies on credit in the hope of later being reimbursed by the expedition's investors. The Spanish sent an assault fleet against Nassau in May, but when the fleet's commodore learned that the French (now Britain's ally) had captured Pensacola, he directed the fleet there instead. This gave Rogers time to continue to fortify and supply New Providence, and in February 1720 the Spaniards finally arrived in Nassau. Two alert ex-slave sentries, the presence of the Delicia of 32-guns and the frigate HMS Flamborough of 24-guns under Captain Johnathan Hildesley and 500 ready waiting militia, many of them ex-pirates helped cause the Spanish withdrawal. The year 1720 brought an end to external threats to Rogers' rule. With Spain and Britain at peace again, the Spanish made no further move against the Bahamas. Vane never returned, having been shipwrecked and captured in the Bay Islands—a year later, he was hanged in Jamaica. This did not end Rogers' problems as governor. Overextended from financing New Providence's defences, he received no assistance from Britain, and merchants refused to give him further credit. His health suffered, and he spent six weeks in Charleston, South Carolina, hoping to recuperate. Instead, he was wounded in a duel with Captain John Hildesley of HMS Flamborough, a duel caused by disputes between the two on New Providence. Troubled by the lack of support and communication from London, Rogers set sail for Britain in March 1721. He arrived three months later to find that a new governor had been appointed, and his company had been liquidated. Personally liable for the obligations he had contracted at Nassau, he was imprisoned for debt. =Activities in England, second term and death= Plaque on the site of Rogers' Bristol residence, 35 Queen Square With both the government and his former partners refusing to honour his debts, Rogers was released from debtor's prison only when his creditors took pity on him and absolved him of his debts. Even so, Rogers wrote that he was \\"perplexed with the melancholy prospect of [his] affairs\\". In 1722 or 1723, Rogers was approached by a man writing a history of piracy, and supplied him with information. The resulting work, A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the Most Notorious Pyrates, published under the pseudonym Captain Charles Johnson, was an enormous hit on both sides of the Atlantic, and catapulted Rogers for the second time to the status of a national hero. With public attention focused on him again, Rogers was successful in 1726 in petitioning the king for financial redress. Not only did King George I grant him a pension, retroactive to 1721, but the king's son and successor, George II, reappointed him as governor on 22 October 1728. The Bahamas did not come under external threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went to Charleston in early 1731 in an attempt to recover his health. Though he returned in July 1731, he never truly regained his health, and died in Nassau on 15 July 1732. A harbour-side street in Nassau is named for Rogers. \\"Piracy expelled, commerce restored\\" remained the motto of the Bahamas until the islands gained independence in 1973.

Initially developed by Macromedia and then acquired by Adobe Systems, Adobe donated Flex to the Apache Software Foundation in 2011 and it was promoted to a top-level project in December 2012. The Flex 3 SDK was released under the open source Mozilla Public License in 2008. Consequently, Flex applications can be developed using standard Integrated development environments (IDEs), such as IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, the free and open source IDE FlashDevelop, as well as the proprietary Adobe Flash Builder. The latest version of the SDK is version 4.16.1. It is released under version 2 of the Apache License. In 2014, the Apache Software Foundation started a new project called FlexJS to cross-compile ActionScript 3 to JavaScript to enable it to run on browsers that do not support Adobe Flash Player and on devices that do not support the Adobe AIR runtime.https://www.slideshare.net/bigosmallm/flexjs-an- introductionhttps://twitter.com/ApacheFlex/status/988051215392149505 In 2017, FlexJS was renamed to Apache Royale.https://discuss.as3lang.org/t/flexjs-is- now-apache-royale/882http://apache-flex- development.2333347.n4.nabble.com/DISCUSS-Name-of-the-FlexJS-Fork- td64199i80.html#a64338 The Apache Software Foundation describes the current iteration of Apache Royale as an open-source frontend technology that allows a developer to code in ActionScript 3 and MXML and target web, mobile devices and desktop devices on Apache Cordova all at once.https://royale.apache.org/ Apache Royale is currently in beta development stage.https://royale.apache.org/apache-royale-v0-9-2-released/  Overview  Flex uses MXML to define UI layout and other non-visual static aspects, ActionScript to address dynamic aspects and as code-behind, and requires Adobe AIR or Flash Player at runtime to run the application.  Versions  = Macromedia Flex 1.0 and 1.5 = Macromedia targeted the enterprise application development market with its initial releases of Flex 1.0 and 1.5. The company offered the technology at a price around US$15,000 per CPU. Required for deployment, the Java EE application server compiled MXML and ActionScript on- the-fly into Flash applications (binary SWF files). Each server license included 5 licenses for the Flex Builder IDE. = Adobe Flex 2 = Adobe significantly changed the licensing model for the Flex product line with the release of Flex 2. The core Flex 2 SDK, consisting of the command-line compilers and the complete class library of user interface components and utilities, was made available as a free download. Complete Flex applications can be built and deployed solely with the Flex 2 SDK, which contains no limitations or restrictions compared to the same SDK included with the Flex Builder IDE. Adobe based the new version of Flex Builder on the open source Eclipse platform. The company released two versions of Flex Builder 2, Standard and Professional. The Professional version includes the Flex Charting Components library. Enterprise-oriented services remain available through Flex Data Services 2. This server component provides data synchronization, data push, publish-subscribe and automated testing. Unlike Flex 1.0 and 1.5, Flex Data Services is not required for the deployment of Flex applications. Coinciding with the release of Flex 2, Adobe introduced a new version of the ActionScript programming language, known as Actionscript 3, reflecting the latest ECMAScript specification. The use of ActionScript 3 and Flex 2 requires version 9 or later of the Flash Player runtime. Flash Player 9 incorporated a new and more robust virtual machine for running the new ActionScript 3. Flex was the first Macromedia product to be re-branded under the Adobe name. = Adobe Flex 3 = On April 26, 2007 Adobe announced their intent to release the Flex 3 SDK (which excludes the Flex Builder IDE and the LiveCycle Data Services) under the terms of the Mozilla Public License. Adobe released the first beta of Flex 3, codenamed Moxie, in June 2007. Major enhancements include integration with the new versions of Adobe's Creative Suite products, support for AIR (Adobe's new desktop application runtime), and the addition of profiling and refactoring tools to the Flex Builder IDE. = Adobe Flash Builder and Flex 4 = Adobe released Flex 4.0 (code named Gumbo) on March 22, 2010. The Flex 4 development environment is called Adobe Flash Builder, formerly known as Adobe Flex Builder. Some themes that have been mentioned by Adobe and have been incorporated into Flex 4 are as follows: * Design in Mind: The framework has been designed for continuous collaboration between designers and developers. * Accelerated Development: Be able to take application development from conception to reality quickly. * Horizontal Platform Improvements: Compiler performance, language enhancements, BiDirectional components, enhanced text (Flex 4 includes the new Text Layout Framework). * Full Support for Adobe Flash Player 10 and above. * Broadening Horizons: Finding ways to make a framework lighter, supporting more deployment runtimes, runtime MXML. * Simpler skinning than the previous versions. * Integration with Adobe Flash Catalyst. * Custom templates Flash Builder is available in two versions: Standard and Premium, the premium adds the following features; * Testing tools * Memory and performance profilers * An automated testing harness to connect to all the leading testing tools * FlexUnit support * command-line build capability = Adobe Flash Builder 4.5 and Flex 4.5 = May 3, 2011, Adobe shipped Flash Builder 4.5 copying Flex 4.5 (SDK only) which delivers full support for building Flex and ActionScript applications for Google Android, as well as support for building ActionScript applications for BlackBerry Tablet OS and Apple iOS.

The building housed the New Zealand branch of the magical order the Stella Matutina. It was designed and the construction overseen by one of New Zealand's most famous architects, and a senior member of the Order, James Walter Chapman-Taylor. Whare Ra was one of the last surviving Temples that could trace its lineage back to the original Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn. It was the only Temple to operate in a permanent, purpose-built building. Early preparations Cover of The Forerunner, No. 16, October 1913. The foundations for the Order in New Zealand were laid by Reginald Gardiner (1872-1959). Born in New South Wales, Australia, he was the son of an Anglican vicar and brother of the Anglican vicar of St Luke's Church, Havelock North, New Zealand, where he finally settled in 1907. He formed about him an artistic, cultural and spiritual group whose activities became known as the \\"Havelock Work\\", and produced a publication called “The Forerunner”. The Havelock Work grew and in time the group became known as the Society of the Southern Cross. In 1910, Revd. Father J. Fitzgerald travelled to New Zealand on Church business, and was introduced to the group. He was suitably impressed, and prior to his return to Britain, promised to stay in touch and to do what he could to help. One of the last G.H. Chiefs of the Order later recollected: :\\"‘Needless to say, this visit filled the group with hope and expectation. They kept in touch with the priest after he returned to England and conducted their meetings as he instructed them’.\\" In due course he wrote that if further progress were to be made, that certain people of his acquaintance would need to come out from England. In 1912 Dr. Robert Felkin, Chief of the Order of the Stella Matutina arrived, assisted by his appointment as Inspector of the Australasian Colleges of the Societas Rosicruciana in Anglia by William Wynn Westcott, one of the original Chiefs of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Supreme Magus of the S.R.I.A. Founding of the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No 49 The South side of Whare Ra. Travelling with his wife and daughter, he initiated a group of twenty-four members into the Order, twelve of whom were advanced to the \\"Second Order\\". A sizeable piece of land on Tauroa Road in Havelock North was donated, and a home for the Order constructed, which they named “Whare Ra”, or House of the Sun. It was in the basement of this house that the large Temple was built. :\\"Whare Ra is a large 3,000 sq. ft. building with the upper floor having the same footprint as the Temple below. The reinforced concrete construction was an innovative choice at the time when there was still strong resistance to any building material other than timber. But 'Whare Ra' was to be a very different building from a domestic home and the advantages of fire resistance, low maintenance, permanence and durability appealed. Also, the monolithic quality could not be ignored and it was desirable that the Temple should be of one continuous form. The reinforced walls were six inches thick and were poured by sections at a time into boxing of around a metre in height.\\" During their three-month stay, sufficient members had been initiated to make a beginning, and the building commissioned and sufficiently advanced to enable its Consecration. Before leaving New Zealand to return to England, a Warrant was issued establishing the Smaragdum Thallasses Temple No. 49 of the Order of the Stella Matutina. The three Chiefs that appeared on the Warrant were Reginald Gardiner, Mason Chambers, and probably Harold Large (or possibly Thomas Chambers). A trust had been set up to manage the monetary affairs of the Order, with the trustees being Mason Chambers, his wife Margaret Chambers, the younger John Chambers, and Reginald Gardiner. The trust deed stated that the group was formed: :\\"For the purpose of instituting carrying on or developing such scientific, religious charitable and similar work as the trustees shall in this discretion deem expedient and also for the purpose of aiding and assisting the carrying out or developing of literary work in all its branches and crafts work and similar or analogous work of which the trustees may in their absolute discretion approve or for such one or more or all of the above purposes as the trustees may from time to time determine.\\" John von Dadelszen, who spent most of his adult life in the Order, and who had been a Temple Warden and one of its last Chiefs, stated that the Order: :\\"...used a threefold system of training, i.e. ceremonial, meditation and personal study. The ceremonial involved a series of grades, with an appropriate ritual for each grade; rather on the lines of Masonic degrees, but based on the symbolism of the Tree of Life, which is the Hebrew Qabalah. There was also a special ceremony, of a more cosmic nature, to mark the vernal and autumnal equinoxes.\\" The North side of Whare Ra. A contemporary of John von Dadelszen, and fellow Chief Archie Shaw, wrote of the role of the three Chiefs, in his 1960 address to members: :\\"The three Chiefs are responsible for the conduct of the whole Order, under the guidance of the Divine Powers Who direct the Order. :\\"Each Chief brings to his office his own particular talents. Together they form an equilateral triangle - a balanced and harmonious whole, and should be regarded as equal in all respects. :\\"The Chiefs should act in harmony and speak as one in all matters pertaining to the rule of the Order. They have the responsibility of ensuring that the true traditions of the Order are preserved, no matter what changes may come about in the future. They will consult as necessity arises, with the Council of the Order, composed of senior members, and may possibly delegate certain duties to senior members from time to time. :\\"The three Wardens also form a triangle, and are responsible, as deputies of the three Chiefs, for the running of the Outer Order. In practice they should be regarded as equal with one another in their office as Warden, notwithstanding that they may possibly be of different Grades. :\\"The Chiefs will meet with the Wardens at regular intervals, and generally maintain such contact as is necessary for the smooth functioning of the whole.\\" The temple prospers In 1916, at the invitation of the members of the New Zealand branch, and with the offer of life tenancy of “Whare Ra”, Dr Felkin and his family returned to New Zealand for good. He issued a new constitution for the Order of the Stella Matutina in the same year, informing members that the Mother Temple of the Order was now in New Zealand. The Order, governed by three ruling Chiefs, prospered under their leadership. By the time of the death of Dr Felkin in 1926, it had a very active membership and was well established – its membership included two Anglican Bishops, General Sir Arthur Russell, Lord Jellicoe, Governor General of New Zealand, members of Parliament, and local dignitaries and officials. Entrance to the Temple, by the candidate for initiation, was via a secret staircase behind a wardrobe, located in Dr Felkin's surgery. :“Halfway down the stairs, where the candidate was required to await further instructions, was a landing, known as “the Cave”, lined with hessian curtains on which Egyptian figures were worked in light blue. After an interval of time the candidate was met by two Temple officers dressed in robes and Egyptian headdresses, blind-folded by one of them, and then led into the Temple where the ceremony of initiation began.” Felkin's grave inscription. In 1931 a devastating earthquake hit the area, and many buildings were levelled or damaged. With its fortress like construction, Whare Ra was unscathed. :\\"The big earthquake of 1931 did no damage whatsoever. Except that the Black Pillar, being top-heavy fell on the paw of the black sphinx on the north side of the steps to the dais in the Temple below the house.\\" Mr Gardiner replaced Dr Felkin as a Greatly Honoured Chief of the Order, and with Mrs and Miss Felkin, ruled for a further stable period of 33 years. In its heyday during the 1930s, it has been estimated that its membership numbered some 300 men and woman, and during its 60-plus-year history that approximately 400–500 people had been initiated. It was during this time that the Temple distanced itself from the affairs of the Stella Matutina in Britain, and renamed itself simply the Order of Smaragdum Thallasses. In 1949, in the last issue of The Lantern, Mrs. Felkin stated: :\\"Perhaps, before very long. someone else will take up the torch that I lay down and endeavour to carry the light a little further. Put as briefly as I can express it, I think it is the conviction of the reality of a spiritual world, not beyond or above our ordinary, everyday world, but interwoven with it here and now.\\" In the Annual Report for year ending 31 December 1959, the Order's Cancellarius reported that: :\\"During the past year 18 Ceremonies were held and the number of members advanced to the higher grades will add greatly to the strength of the Order. Four new members were admitted and we welcome them. It may be said that four new members in one year is not many, but we must remember that the Path of Initiation is only for the few. The Order does not actively seek members, but those who are ready are inevitably drawn to the Light\\". In 1959 Mr Gardiner and Mrs Felkin died, followed by Miss Felkin three years later. During the late 1960s, Frater Albertus of the Paracelsus Research Society visited Whare Ra. He reported this visit to members of the society in one of their bulletins. :\\"In the heart of the north island--New Zealand has two main islands-- is an interesting spot where much activity centers about the ancient wisdom. Not only are the Maories custodians of this ancient wisdom, but the later settlers brought much with them from Europe that they know how to perpetuate. Dr. Felkin was one of them. Under the Maori name \\"Whare Ra\\" (house of the sun) the Order of the Golden Dawn has its present quarters and underground temple in a beautiful, secluded and heavily landscaped place. :\\"The \\"chiefs\\" as they are called, heading Whare Ra, Messrs. von Dadelszen and Salt and Mrs. Jones, whom we met proved to be very fine people with a fervent interest in perpetuating the work of the Golden Dawn, brought to New Zealand by Dr. Felkin before the first World War.\\" Decline However, by 1978 it was clear that Whare Ra was a spent force. On 24 August 1978 a letter was circulated to members announcing the closure: :\\"Dear Fratres and Sorores, :This letter is addressed to all members of the Order of S.T., including members of the Second Order. :It is with great great regret that we write to inform you that the Temple is closing and there will be no Vernal Equinox Ceremony. :Those of you who have been present at recent Equinox Ceremonies will surely have been aware, not only of the lack of numbers, but also the lack of power, in the Temple. Those who have read their annual reports can scarcely have failed to notice that no new members have been admitted since 1975. Indeed there have been no grade ceremonies at all for the last two years or more. ...\\" Much to the regret of many esoteric historians they burnt most of the group's regalia, Temple furnishings and records. Fortunately some things survived, including the Temple's pillars, the two sphinxes which flanked either side of the dais steps, and many copies of the rituals and lectures were passed on and preserved. Whare Ra is now in private hands, and has been registered as a Category I protected building by the New Zealand Historic Places Trust.

Crystals of manganite are prismatic and deeply striated parallel to their length; they are often grouped together in bundles. The color is dark steel-grey to iron-black, and the luster brilliant and submetallic. The streak is dark reddish brown. The hardness is 4, and the specific gravity is 4.3. There is a perfect cleavage parallel to the brachypinacoid, and less-perfect cleavage parallel to the prism faces. Twinned crystals are not infrequent. The mineral contains 89.7% manganese sesquioxide; it dissolves in hydrochloric acid with evolution of chlorine. Occurrence Manganite crystal group Manganite occurs with other manganese oxides in deposits formed by circulating meteoric water in the weathering environment in clay deposits and laterites. It forms by low temperature hydrothermal action in veins in association with calcite, barite, and siderite. Often associated with pyrolusite, braunite, hausmannite and goethite. Manganite occurs in specimens exhibiting good crystal form at Ilfeld in the Harz Mountains of Germany, where the mineral occurs with calcite and barite in veins traversing porphyry. Crystals have also been found at Ilmenau in Thuringia, Neukirch near Sélestat in Alsace (newkirkite), Granam near Towie in Aberdeenshire, and in Upton Pyne near Exeter, UK and Negaunee, Michigan, United States, and in the Pilbara of Western Australia. Good crystals have also been found at Atikokan, Ontario and Nova Scotia, Canada. As an ore of manganese it is much less abundant than pyrolusite or psilomelane. Although described with various other names as early as 1772, the name manganite was first applied in a publication by W. Haidinger in 1827.Palache, Charles, Harry Berman and Clifford Frondel, The System of Mineralogy V.1, p. 646, Wiley, 7th ed., 1944 Crystal structure of manganite Applications The mineral was used in prehistoric times as a pigment, by humans, and as a fire starter by Neanderthalers. Manganite is believed to have been used in prehistoric times to start a wood fire. Manganite lowers the combustion temperature of wood from 350 degrees Celsius to 250 degrees Celsius. Manganite powder has been a common find in Neanderthal archaeological sites.

It was the second significant UK contemporary music sampler release in the period. Transatlantic, founded in 1961, was a prototype for many of the UK independent labels that followed it. It established the UK folk-rock market, first by importing American records, and then by recording British artists. With the advent of psychedelia and flower power, the Transatlantic stable of artists achieved increasing popularity, culminating in the formation of the supergroup Pentangle. Meanwhile, Transatlantic had been extending its eclecticism, recording such as the eccentric audio collageist Ron Geesin, and The Purple Gang, whose \\"Granny Takes A Trip\\" was banned by the BBC in 1967. CBS had released the extremely successful contemporary music budget sampler with The Rock Machine Turns You On in 1967. Before CBS could follow up, Transatlantic released Listen Here! early in 1968. Like Rock Machine the record was priced at 14/11d (£0.75), but Transatlantic took promotion one stage further by not only printing the track listing on the front, but also the price. The record was designed to preview not only the forthcoming Pentangle double album, but solo records by members Bert Jansch and John Renbourn.

The complementary process that involves increases of such components is called upregulation. An example of downregulation is the cellular decrease in the expression of a specific receptor in response to its increased activation by a molecule, such as a hormone or neurotransmitter, which reduces the cell's sensitivity to the molecule. This is an example of a locally acting (negative feedback) mechanism. An example of upregulation is the response of liver cells exposed to such xenobiotic molecules as dioxin. In this situation, the cells increase their production of cytochrome P450 enzymes, which in turn increases degradation of these molecules. Downregulation or upregulation of an RNA or protein may also arise by an epigenetic alteration. An epigenetic alteration can be permanent or semi-permanent in a somatic cell lineage. Such an epigenetic alteration can cause expression of the RNA or protein to no longer respond to an external stimulus. This occurs, for instance, during drug addiction or progression to cancer.  Downregulation and upregulation of receptors All living cells have the ability to receive and process signals that originate outside their membranes, which they do by means of proteins called receptors, often located at the cell's surface imbedded in the plasma membrane. When such signals interact with a receptor, they effectively direct the cell to do something, such as dividing, dying, or allowing substances to be created, or to enter or exit the cell. A cell's ability to respond to a chemical message depends on the presence of receptors tuned to that message. The more receptors a cell has that are tuned to the message, the more the cell will respond to it. Receptors are created, or expressed, from instructions in the DNA of the cell, and they can be increased, or upregulated, when the signal is weak, or decreased, or downregulated, when it is strong. Their level can also be up or down regulated by modulation of systems that degrade receptors when they are no longer required by the cell. Downregulation of receptors can also occur when receptors have been chronically exposed to an excessive amount of a ligand, either from endogenous mediators or from exogenous drugs. This results in ligand-induced desensitization or internalization of that receptor. This is typically seen in animal hormone receptors. Upregulation of receptors, on the other hand, can result in super- sensitized cells especially after repeated exposure to an antagonistic drug or prolonged absence of the ligand. Some receptor agonists may cause downregulation of their respective receptors, while most receptor antagonists temporarily upregulate their respective receptors. The disequilibrium caused by these changes often causes withdrawal when the long-term use of a drug is discontinued. However, the use of certain receptor antagonists may also damage receptors Upregulation and downregulation can also happen as a response to toxins or hormones. An example of upregulation in pregnancy is hormones that cause cells in the uterus to become more sensitive to oxytocin.  Example: Insulin receptor downregulation  Elevated levels of the hormone insulin in the blood trigger downregulation of the associated receptors. When insulin binds to its receptors on the surface of a cell, the hormone receptor complex undergoes endocytosis and is subsequently attacked by intracellular lysosomal enzymes. The internalization of the insulin molecules provides a pathway for degradation of the hormone as well as for regulation of the number of sites that are available for binding on the cell surface. At high plasma concentrations, the number of surface receptors for insulin is gradually reduced by the accelerated rate of receptor internalization and degradation brought about by increased hormonal binding. The rate of synthesis of new receptors within the endoplasmic reticulum and their insertion in the plasma membrane do not keep pace with their rate of destruction. Over time, this self-induced loss of target cell receptors for insulin reduces the target cell's sensitivity to the elevated hormone concentration. This process is illustrated by the insulin receptor sites on target cells, e.g. liver cells, in a person with type 2 diabetes. Due to the elevated levels of blood glucose in an overweight individual, the β-cells (islets of Langerhans) in the pancreas must release more insulin than normal to meet the demand and return the blood to homeostatic levels. The near-constant increase in blood insulin levels results from an effort to match the increase in blood glucose, which will cause receptor sites on the liver cells to downregulate and decrease the number of receptors for insulin, increasing the subject's resistance by decreasing sensitivity to this hormone. There is also a hepatic decrease in sensitivity to insulin. This can be seen in the continuing gluconeogenesis in the liver even when blood glucose levels are elevated. This is the more common process of insulin resistance, which leads to adult-onset diabetes. Another example can be seen in diabetes insipidus, in which the kidneys become insensitive to arginine vasopressin. Downregulation and upregulation in drug addiction Family-based, adoption, and twin studies have indicated that there is a strong ( 50%) heritable component to vulnerability to substance abuse addiction. Especially among genetically vulnerable individuals, repeated exposure to a drug of abuse in adolescence or adulthood causes addiction by inducing stable downregulation or upregulation in expression of specific genes and microRNAs through epigenetic alterations. Such downregulation or upregulation has been shown to occur in the brain's reward regions, such as the nucleus accumbens. (See, for example, Epigenetics of cocaine addiction.) Downregulation and upregulation in cancer DNA damage appears to be the primary underlying cause of cancer. If accurate DNA repair is deficient, DNA damages tend to accumulate. Unrepaired DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer (see malignant neoplasms). Thus, epigenetic downregulation or upregulation of DNA genes that were repaired is likely central to progression to cancer. As described in Regulation of transcription in cancer, epigenetic downregulation of the DNA repair gene MGMT occurs in 93% of bladder cancers, 88% of stomach cancers, 74% of thyroid cancers, 40%-90% of colorectal cancers and 50% of brain cancers. Similarly, epigenetic downregulation of LIG4 occurs in 82% of colorectal cancers and epigenetic downregulation of NEIL1 occurs in 62% of head and neck cancers and in 42% of non-small-cell lung cancers. Epigenetic upregulation of the DNA repair genes PARP1 and FEN1 occurs in numerous cancers (see Regulation of transcription in cancer). PARP1 and FEN1 are essential genes in the error-prone and mutagenic DNA repair pathway microhomology- mediated end joining. If this pathway is upregulated, the excess mutations it causes can lead to cancer. PARP1 is over-expressed in tyrosine kinase- activated leukemias, in neuroblastoma, in testicular and other germ cell tumors, and in Ewing's sarcoma. FEN1 is upregulated in the majority of cancers of the breast, prostate, stomach, neuroblastomas, pancreas, and lung.

PHP-GTK provides an object-oriented interface to GTK+ classes and functions. While PHP-GTK partially supports GTK2, GTK3 is not supported at all.  History PHP-GTK was originally conceived by Andrei Zmievski, who is also actively involved in the development of PHP and the Zend Engine. The idea was received well by the PHP community, and more people started to get involved with the project. James Moore and Steph Fox were among the first to join in, contributing a great deal to PHP- GTK through their documentation efforts, and Frank Kromann - also from the PHP development team - supplied Windows binaries for the project. The first version of PHP-GTK was released in March 2001. More people began to get involved, and several extensions were contributed introducing new widgets, such as Scintilla and GtkHTML. PHP-GTK 1.0 was released in October 2003 alongside several extensions -- including a wrapper for libglade, which allowed the cross-platform Glade UI builder to be used in creating PHP-GTK applications.  Present  Zmievski and Fox are still working on the project, with Fox now maintaining PHP-GTK for Windows. The planned next major release, PHP-GTK 2 fully utilizes PHP 5's powerful object model support, and brings the improved portability of GTK 2.6 as well as its new set of widgets. The project also has support for GtkSourceView, which provides a source code editor widget. Around half the classes have been fully documented. Scott Mattocks, an active member of the PHP-GTK documentation group, has also written a book on the subject of PHP-GTK programming. The project is only compatible with GTK 2, not version 3. WxPHP (WxWidgets for PHP) exists as an alternative to develop GTK PHP applications.  Example  right set_title('Hello World!'); $window->connect_simple('destroy', array('Gtk', 'main_quit')); $button->connect_simple('clicked', 'pressed'); $button1->connect_simple('clicked', 'pressed'); $window->add($button); $window->show_all(); Gtk::main(); ?> The sample PHP-GTK 2 program instantiates a \`GtkWindow\` widget with the title \\"Hello World!\\", containing a \`GtkButton\` labelled \\"Click Me.\\" When the button is pressed, the message \\"Hello again - The button was pressed!\\" is displayed on the console via the callback \`pressed\`.  Deployment  Several tools have sprung up that assist the simple deployment of PHP-GTK applications. PHP compilers such as PriadoBlender and Roadsend PHP (Currently only compatible with PHP-GTK 1, while latest snapshot includes PHP-GTK 2) enable the compilation of applications written in PHP-GTK to a standalone binary executable. Alan Knowles' PECL package, bcompiler, also allows compilation of PHP into bytecode to hide the source code.

He was also known as . His court title was Sado no Kami. The Hayashi family, a branch of the Inaba clan, originated from the village of Oki in the Kasugai District of Owari Province. Michikatsu, born in the early decades of the 16th century, served the Oda clan, first under Oda Nobuhide, and then under the young Oda Nobunaga, upon Nobunaga's assignment to Nagoya Castle. Hidesada was the head karō; together with Hirate Masahide, he served as Nobunaga's guardian. In 1546, he assisted at Nobunaga's genpuku ceremony. Soon after Nobuhide's death in 1551, Hidesada became concerned about Nobunaga's erratic behavior, and secretly supported Oda Nobuyuki, Nobunaga's brother, as successor to the family headship. In 1555, Nobunaga killed Oda Nobutomo and captured Kiyosu Castle; Hidesada was made to defend Nagoya Castle. Nobunaga unified the Oda clan by defeating all opponents, and took control of Owari Province. However, Hidesada was still deeply dissatisfied with Nobunaga. In 1556, Hidesada together with Shibata Katsuie gathered troops to oust Nobunaga and replace him with Oda Nobuyuki. They lost in the Battle of Inō and a temporary truce was brokered by Nobunaga, who did not want to continue a fight that might draw an invasion from neighboring daimyōs. Hidesada and Katsuie were both pardoned and retained their positions to work for Oda clan. Two years later, Nobuyuki was tricked again by Nobunaga; this time, he was killed. On November 1575, after He decided to retire, to have Oda Nobutada be the head of the clan, Hidesada was made to take care of Nobutada. In August 1580, Nobunaga suddenly decided to banish Hidesada from all positions for having supported Nobuyuki in the past. The reason seems to be highly trivial and it is most likely that Nobunaga decided that Hidesada had outlived his usefulness and decided to trim down the number of retainers. He probably lived in Kyoto from here but died in few years.

The route covered by the service was historically part of the Midland Railway. According to SELRAP, the Airedale line is the most heavily used passenger route outside the South East of England.  The route and its history  The first section, between Leeds and Bradford (Forster Square station), was opened by the Leeds and Bradford Railway on 1 July 1846. A number of the intermediate stations were closed in March 1965 (as a result of the Beeching Axe), however the line and its major stations remained open. Some of the closed stations, such as , were re-opened during the 1980s. In 1994 under Regional Railways, the line was electrified at 25 kV AC overhead between Leeds and Skipton, and new British Rail Class 333 trains were introduced in the early 2000s. Investment in the line has seen passenger numbers grow, and now overcrowding on trains is a problem. New stock and longer trains are to be introduced by the new Northern Rail franchisee Arriva Rail North by December 2018 to tackle this issue.\\"CAF to deliver 281 rail vehicles for Northern rail franchise in UK\\"Rail Technology; Retrieved 27 January 2016 The route is described below.

Because of the difficulty of lengthening platforms at Shipley, it will be hard to introduce longer trains (i.e. 5 or 6 carriages) as is being proposed on the neighbouring Wharfedale line. It is therefore proposed to run more trains per hour between Leeds and Keighley, with a new platform at Keighley to accommodate this. New stations were opened at Apperley Bridge in December 2015 and Kirkstall Forge in June 2016 London North Eastern Railway currently operate a small number of daily services on the line, between Skipton/Bradford and London King's Cross. These are operated by InterCity 225's. East Coast, Virgin Trains East Coast's predecessor, wanted to run more frequent services from December 2009 but to do so the line would need more capacity. A recent report by Modern Railways claimed that a solid hourly service would operate on the line as far as Long Preston, but would serve Carlisle and Lancaster alternately. It may also become a freight artery to improve capacity on the West Coast Main Line. Network Rail's own latest plans involve new signalling and other improvements for the sections of the line beyond Skipton. Carlisle services will be increased to a basic two-hour pattern with extra services to 'fill in the gaps' at peak times during the day to give a 1 train/h frequency. Lancaster services will also be made more frequent, however it has been suggested they will be terminated at Skipton in future, rather than continuing through to Leeds as at present. All of these plans are still dependent on getting enough government funding.

It was first observed in the 15th century at Tolfa, near Rome, where it was mined for the manufacture of alum. First called aluminilite by J.C. Delamétherie in 1797, this name was contracted by François Beudant three decades later to alunite. Alunite from Slovakia Alunite crystals morphologically are rhombohedra with interfacial angles of 90° 50', causing them to resemble cubes. Crystal symmetry is trigonal. Minute glistening crystals have also been found loose in cavities in altered rhyolite. Alunite varies in color from white to yellow gray. The hardness on the Mohs scale is 4 and the specific gravity is between 2.6 and 2.8. It is insoluble in water or weak acids, but soluble in sulfuric acid. Alunite from Marysvale, Utah Sodium can substitute for potassium in the mineral, and when the sodium content is high, is called natroalunite. Crystal structure of alunite Alunite is an analog of jarosite, where aluminium replaces Fe3+. Alunite occurs as a secondary mineral on iron sulfate ores. Alunite occurs as veins and replacement masses in trachyte, rhyolite, and similar potassium rich volcanic rocks. It is formed by the action of sulfuric acid bearing solutions on these rocks during the oxidation and leaching of metal sulfide deposits. Alunite also is found near volcanic fumaroles. The white, finely granular masses closely resemble finely granular limestone, dolomite, anhydrite, and magnesite in appearance. The more compact kinds from Hungary are so hard and tough that they have been used for millstones. Historically extensive deposits were mined in Tuscany and Hungary, and at Bulahdelah, New South Wales, Australia. It is currently mined at Tolfa, Italy. In the United States it is found in the San Juan district of Colorado; Goldfield, Nevada; the ghost town of Alunite, Utah near Marysvale; and Red Mountain near Patagonia, Arizona. The Arizona occurrence lies appropriately above a canyon named Alum Gulch. Alunite is mined as an ore of both potassium and aluminium at Marysvale. Some of the ore deposits were located by airborne and satellite multispectral imaging. An article in the May/June 2019 issue of Archaeology magazine states that in China, in Henan province, an assortment of ceramic objects and jars were found, dating back 2000 years. In one of the jars, a mixture of alunite and potassium nitrate was found. The mixture was then thought to be a \\"mixture of immortality\\" mentioned in ancient Chinese texts.

Szkoła Główna Handlowa w Warszawie.) is the oldest business school in Poland. Building C on Aleja Niepodległości SGH Warsaw School of Economics was founded in 1906 as a private school under the name August Zieliński Private Trade Courses for Men. On 30 July 1919 it became a separate legal entity and was granted the status of an institution of higher education. The school was renamed Szkoła Główna Handlowa (SGH) in 1933. Following World War II SGH was nationalized and its name changed to Szkoła Główna Planowania i Statystyki (Main School of Planning and Statistics) with an abbreviation of SGPiS. The school regained its pre-war name after the fall of communism in 1991. SGH Warsaw School of Economics offers courses leading to bachelor's or master's degrees to both full-time and extramural students. It also offers programs for doctoral and postgraduate degrees. Its Finance and Accounting program was ranked among the Top 40 European Masters in Management by the Financial Times, 2008. SGH Warsaw School of Economics cooperates with around 200 higher education institutions around the world within student and staff exchange areas. It is also a member of the CEMS, the LLP Erasmus, the Partnership in International Management network (PIM) and the European University Association EUA. It is located at the northern edge of the Mokotów district of Warsaw. Bus and tram stops as well as the Pole Mokotowskie metro station are nearby.  Organizational structure  SGH Warsaw School of Economics abandoned the traditional departmental structure segregating students on the basis of their major. Professors as well as research and teaching programmes are grouped in five Colleges (Collegiums) as well as a number of extra-collegial units, such as the foreign language teaching center. Courses offered SGH is a university with no departments. Within full-time and part-time studies, they are conducted in two levels. Bachelor studies, which last for six semesters, lead to a Bachelor's professional title. Holders of such a title may apply for a place and begin Master studies which last for four semesters. To obtain a diploma (as well as credit terms) it is necessary to gather the required minimum points. Individual subjects are divided into mandatory sections for particular fields, optional for those subjects, additional items which help develop the knowledge unrelated to specific subjects, and objects of education common to all economists. Different subjects can have different minimum points for each of these types of items. SGH full-time students are offered the following fields of study in Polish: * Economics, * European Master in Law and Economics, * European Studies, * Finance and Accounting, * Quantitative Methods in Economics and Information Systems, * Management (Business Administration), * Public Sector Economics (Public Administration), * Social Policy, * Spatial Economic Policy, * International Economics, * Big Data. From 2006/2007 Academic Year SGH Studies are divided into: * Bachelor's Studies (undergraduate) – 6-semester * Master's Studies (graduate) – 4-semester * Doctoral Studies – 6-semester * System based on ECTS credits All SGH students study basic macro- and micro- economics, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, social science, law, history, geography, and languages during the first three semesters. After having passed the required examinations for the first three semesters, they then must register for one out of the six offered areas of studies. The BA degree is granted after completing a required number of credits (about six semesters of studies) and the MA (MSc) degree is granted after completing about eight to ten semesters (including six semesters for the BA) which is the maximum period of tuition free study at SGH. It is worth mentioning that students do not have to get the BA before applying for the master's degree, and the time span required for the degree in the given specialisation(s) depends mostly on students themselves, due to the free choice of courses (some limitations apply), professors, and the maximum work load per semester. International cooperation SGH is currently working with over 250 foreign universities, as well as with many international organizations.

It is used as the basis to prove the security of many cryptographic protocols, most notably the ElGamal and Cramer–Shoup cryptosystems. Definition Consider a (multiplicative) cyclic group G of order q, and with generator g. The DDH assumption states that, given g^a and g^b for uniformly and independently chosen a,b in mathbb{Z}_q, the value g^{ab} \\"looks like\\" a random element in G. This intuitive notion can be formally stated by saying that the following two probability distributions are computationally indistinguishable (in the security parameter, n=log(q)): * (g^a,g^b,g^{ab}), where a and b are randomly and independently chosen from mathbb{Z}_q. * (g^a,g^b,g^c), where a,b,c are randomly and independently chosen from mathbb{Z}_q. Triples of the first kind are often called DDH triplet or DDH tuples. Relation to other assumptions The DDH assumption is related to the discrete log assumption. If it were possible to efficiently compute discrete logs in G, then the DDH assumption would not hold in G. Given (g^a,g^b,z), one could efficiently decide whether z=g^{ab} by first taking the discrete log_g of g^a, and then comparing z with (g^b)^a. DDH is considered to be a stronger assumption than the discrete logarithm assumption, because there are groups for which computing discrete logs is believed to be hard (And thus the DL Assumption is believed to be true), but detecting DDH tuples is easy (And thus DDH is false). Because of this, requiring that the DDH assumption holds in a group is believed to be a more restrictive requirement than DL. The DDH assumption is also related to the computational Diffie–Hellman assumption (CDH). If it were possible to efficiently compute g^{ab} from (g^a,g^b), then one could easily distinguish the two probability distributions above. Similar to the above, DDH is considered to be a stronger assumption than CDH. Other properties The problem of detecting DDH tuples is random self-reducible, meaning, roughly, that if it is hard for even a small fraction of inputs, it is hard for almost all inputs; if it is easy for even a small fraction of inputs, it is easy for almost all inputs. Groups for which DDH is assumed to hold When using a cryptographic protocol whose security depends on the DDH assumption, it is important that the protocol is implemented using groups where DDH is believed to hold: * The subgroup of kth residues modulo a prime p, where (p-1)/k is also a large prime (also called a Schnorr group). For the case of k=2, this corresponds to the group of quadratic residues modulo a safe prime. * A prime-order elliptic curve E over the field GF(p), where p is prime, provided E has large embedding degree. * A Jacobian of a hyper-elliptic curve over the field GF(p) with a prime number of reduced divisors, where p is prime, provided the Jacobian has large embedding degree. Importantly, the DDH assumption does not hold in the multiplicative group mathbb{Z}^*_p, where p is prime. This is because if g is a generator of mathbb{Z}^*_p, then the Legendre symbol of g^a reveals if a is even or odd. Given g^a, g^b and g^{ab}, one can thus efficiently compute and compare the least significant bit of a, b and ab, respectively, which provides a probabilistic method to distinguish g^{ab} from a random group element. The DDH assumption does not hold on elliptic curves over GF(p) with small embedding degree (say, less than log^2(p)), a class which includes supersingular elliptic curves. This is because the Weil pairing or Tate pairing can be used to solve the problem directly as follows: given P,aP,bP,cP on such a curve, one can compute e(P,cP) and e(aP,bP). By the bilinearity of the pairings, the two expressions are equal if and only if ab=c modulo the order of P. If the embedding degree is large (say around the size of p) then the DDH assumption will still hold because the pairing cannot be computed. Even if the embedding degree is small, there are some subgroups of the curve in which the DDH assumption is believed to hold.

Jackson. Jackson plays U.S. Marine Colonel Terry Childers, who is brought to court-martial after men under Childers' orders kill many civilians outside the U.S. embassy in Yemen. Plot In 1968 during the Vietnam War, a disastrous American advance leaves U.S. Marine Lieutenant Hayes Hodges wounded and his men dead. His squadmate Lieutenant Terry Childers executes a North Vietnamese prisoner to intimidate a captive officer into calling off a mortar attack on Hodges’ position; sparing the officer’s life, Childers rescues Hodges. In 1996, Hodges, now a colonel, is set to retire after 28 years as a JAG officer. At his pre-retirement party at the Camp Lejeune Officers Club, he is honored by his old friend, Colonel Terry Childers, now the commanding officer of a Marine Expeditionary Unit. Childers and his unit are deployed to Southwest Asia as part of an Amphibious Readiness Group, called to evacuate the U.S. Ambassador to Yemen when a routine anti-American demonstration at the embassy erupts in rock-throwing, Molotov cocktails, and gunfire. Escorting Ambassador Mourain and his family safely to a helicopter, Childers retrieves the embassy's American flag. Under heavy fire from snipers on nearby rooftops, three Marines are killed, and Childers orders his men to open fire on the crowd, resulting in the deaths of 83 irregular Yemeni soldiers and civilians, including children; the remaining Marines and embassy staff are saved. U.S. National Security Advisor Bill Sokal pressures the military to court-martial Childers, hoping to salvage American relations in the Middle East by placing all blame for the incident on the colonel. Childers asks Hodges to serve as his defense attorney, and he reluctantly accepts. Hodges rejects a plea deal from the prosecutor, Major Biggs, who is convinced of Childers’ guilt but privately refuses to consider the death penalty. With little time to prepare a defense, Hodges goes to Yemen, where witnesses and police claim that the Marines fired first on the unarmed crowd. Visiting the abandoned embassy and some of the wounded, he notices an undamaged security camera and scattered audio cassette tapes. Returning to the U.S., Hodges confronts Childers about the complete lack of evidence to support his version of events, resulting in a fistfight. Sokal burns a videotape revealing the crowd was armed and fired on the Marines, and forces Mourain to lie on the stand that the crowd was peaceful, and that Childers ignored his orders and was violent and disrespectful to him and his family. Hodges meets with Mourain’s wife, who admits Childers acted valiantly but refuses to testify. Captain Lee, who hesitated to follow Childers’ order, is unable to testify to having seen gunfire from the crowd. A Yemeni doctor testifies that the tapes Hodges found are propaganda inciting violence against Americans, but declares the protest was peaceful. With Sokal on the stand, Hodges presents a shipping manifest proving that the tape from the undamaged camera – the tape Sokal burned – was delivered to Sokal's office but disappeared, with footage that would likely have exonerated Childers. Taking the stand, Childers explains that he was the only surviving Marine able to see the crowd was armed. On cross-examination, Biggs goads Childers into admitting to his poor choice of words when giving his order. Childers loses his temper, declaring that he would not sacrifice the lives of his men to appease the likes of Biggs, to Hodges’ dismay. The prosecution presents Colonel Binh Le Cao, the Vietnamese officer whose life he spared, as a rebuttal witness, testifying that Childers executed an unarmed prisoner of war. During Hodges’ cross-examination, Cao agrees that Childers took action to save American lives, and that if circumstances were reversed, Cao would have done the same. After the trial, Hodges confronts Sokal about the missing tape, vowing to uncover the truth. Childers is found guilty of the minor charge of breach of peace, but cleared of conduct unbecoming an officer, and murder; Biggs approaches Hodges about investigating Childers’ actions in Vietnam, but Hodges declines to testify. Leaving the courthouse, Cao and Childers salute each other. An epilogue reveals that Sokal was found guilty of destroying evidence and Mourain of perjury, both losing their jobs, while Childers retired honorably.

William Friedkin was hired to direct, but had trouble collaborating with Webb on script rewrites. Rudin passed the project over to Richard Zanuck, who then hired Stephen Gaghan to work on the screenplay. Webb hated Gaghan's work and frustrated the filmmaker's attempts to receive cooperation from the Department of Defense, which was eventually obtained nonetheless. Location shooting took place in Morocco, Nokesville, Virginia, Warrenton, Virginia (military base scenes), Hunting Island, South Carolina (Vietnam scenes), and Mount Washington, Virginia (Gen. Hodges' estate scenes).Friedkin pp. 430–431 Reception  =Critical response= The film received mixed reviews upon release, with Rotten Tomatoes giving it 36%. Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film two and a half stars out of five, praising its \\"expert melodrama\\" while complaining about an \\"infuriating screenplay\\".Roger Ebert: April 2000, Rules of Engagement Conversely Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian complained that the film was \\"lazily plotted, grotesquely dishonest, and dripping with a creepy strain of Islamophobia\\".Peter Bradshaw: August 2000, Rules of Engagement Charles Gittins, writing from a legal perspective for CNN, wrote that \\"the movie succeeds in capturing the details of a successful military operation and showing the possible political fallout from such an operation. The drama lags, however, once it enters the courtroom where Rules of Engagement is neither accurate nor compelling.\\"Charles Gittins: CNN: April 2000, Rules of Engagement The American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee described it as \\"probably the most racist film ever made against Arabs by Hollywood\\", comparing it with Birth of a Nation and The Eternal Jew.Whitaker, Brian. \\"The 'towel-heads' take on Hollywood\\", The Guardian. Friday August 11, 2000.
