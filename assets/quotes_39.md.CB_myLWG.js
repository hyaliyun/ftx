The forces of the Australian colonies and the early forces of the Commonwealth post-Federation in 1901 closely followed the uniforms of the British Army. Since then it has continued to be influenced by British but also US styles, as well as including some distinctly Australian designs, reflecting local conditions and trends. Overview Many of the Australian Army's customs and traditions have been inherited from the British Army, due to the nation's history as a former British colony and the Army's origins in the forces raised by the each of the Australian colonies. While soldiers originally only wore a single uniform for all occasions‚Äîincluding ceremonial parades, work parties or in the field‚Äîlater they were issued with two types of uniform, one for day-to-day working and fighting in, known as \\"service\\" or \\"battle-dress\\", and another for parades and ceremony, or \\"full-dress\\" uniform. Military uniforms have undergone gradual, yet almost constant, change since the 19th century, moving away from bright colours to more drab camouflage designs. This has occurred mostly for tactical reasons, in response to developments in weapons and operational methods, as well as reflecting changes in the area in which military forces have been required to operate, and the prevailing environment, terrain and vegetation. Other influences have included specific national characteristics, military tradition and alliances, as well as civilian fashion trends. Australian Army uniforms have mostly tended to be functional with only limited accoutrements, even to the point of being described as \\"bland\\", a trend which has been ascribed in part to a traditional mistrust of authority in Australian society. Yet despite changes, even in the early 21st century the uniforms and accoutrements worn remain similar to those adopted or modified from those of the British Army. History =Colonial forces= Prior to Federation each of the Australian colonies had maintained their own military forces made up pre-dominantly of volunteers or militia, and the uniforms they adopted generally followed colour and design of the part- time British territorial forces, being mostly green and grey as opposed to the red of the British regular forces, although this was worn by some units. Ranks also followed the British pattern. A number of \\"Scottish\\" corps were raised in the colonies, many of which wore highland dress, while there were also several \\"Irish' units which wore green, and several local \\"English\\" regiments which continued to wear red. Members of the New South Wales Contingent sent to Sudan in 1885 initially wore red for infantry and blue for artillery, along with white sun helmet and equipment; however, on arrival their uniforms were replaced by khaki. Meanwhile, in the 1890s the uniforms worn in the Australian colonies began to reflect local trends, becoming more suited to the conditions. These were mostly a drab khaki with coloured regimental facings, worn with a wide-brimmed hat, while regimental badges often included uniquely Australian flora or fauna or other national symbols. The wide-brimmed slouch hat was first worn during this time. Initially worn by the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1885, it was adopted by the New South Wales Reserve Rifle Companies soon after and by some infantry regiments which wore it \\"for shooting purposes\\". Considered sensible and practical for local conditions its popularity grew and its use became widespread. While Victorian and Tasmanian units initially wore the brim turned up on the right after Federation all units adopted the practice of doing so on the left. Forces of the Australian colonies deployed to South Africa during the Second Anglo-Boer War wore khaki uniforms‚Äîissued due to the increased range and accuracy of small arms‚Äîinstead of their more colourful regimental dress.

Image:AWM P00220 South Australian Mounted Rifles 1900.jpgSouth Australian Mounted Rifles training near Adelaide prior to deploying to South Africa, c. 1900. =Post- Federation= On 1 March 1901 the Australian Army was formed following the transfer of colonial forces. Universal service dress was introduced in 1902 and was worn at all times, including in the field, except for formal occasions requiring full dress. This uniform included a peaked cap, tunic, and trousers, with officers wearing a Sam Browne belt. Officers of the mounted arm wore breeches and boots, while the rest worn puttees. The different arms and corps were distinguished by the colour of the braid trimming on the shoulder straps. A wide-brimmed slouch hat was worn with one side turned up by troops overseas. The rising sun badge was first worn at this time by battalions of the Australian Commonwealth Horse on active service in South Africa, while some Queensland units wore emu plumes in their hats. During this period it remained common to follow the British system, with the uniform subsequently adopted by the Commonwealth consisting of a General Service Dress which, in order to achieve financial savings, could be converted into Full Dress for ceremonial occasions simply by the addition of a number of lace accoutrements, including aiguillettes, as well as breast-lines and girdles. The uniform consisted of a khaki serge jacket, with slouch hat and breeches. Cloth collar patches were worn, as well as coloured piping on the jacket, with rosettes or plumes on the hat, and regimental badges. The introduction of universal service in 1912 resulted in the adoption of a number of changes due to the need to economise following the rapid expansion of the Army. The uniform provide for at this time was relatively simple, consisting of a hat, heavy woollen khaki shirt, cord breeches and boots. To distinguish between units and corps a coloured cloth hat band with a metal numeral was worn. Officers kept their jackets, and later approval was given to wear open collars with shirt and tie.

Peak caps were initially also worn by the infantry, while light horsemen often wore a distinctive emu plume in their slouch hats. A standard khaki puggaree was worn by all arms. From 1916 the British steel Brodie helmet was issued for use by infantry on the Western Front. A loose- fitting four-pocket service dress jacket was worn, along with baggy knee breeches, puttees, and tan ankle-boots. A heavy woollen greatcoat was worn during cold weather. The uniform was a drab \\"pea soup\\" or khaki colour, while all buttons and badges were oxidised to prevent shine. All personnel wore a shoulder title bearing the word \\"Australia\\". Rank insignia followed the British Army pattern and were worn on the upper arms (or shoulders for officers). Identical hat and collar badges were worn by all units, which were initially only distinguished by small metal numerals and letters on the shoulder straps (or collars for officers). However, in 1915 a system of Unit Colour Patches was adopted, worn on the upper arm of a soldier's jacket. Uniforms worn by the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) were similar to those of the rest of the AIF, although some officers wore a double-breasted \\"maternity jacket\\". AFC \\"wings\\" were worn on the left breast, while an AFC colour patch and standard rising sun badges were also worn.

However, in the 1930s a range of new uniforms, believed to be more \\"attractive\\", were issued to the Militia in an attempt to increase recruitment. Mostly these were blue or khaki, and included \\"distinctive\\" coloured collars and piping which indicated corps. Meanwhile, it was decided to retain unit-colour patches, whilst regimental and corps badges were also adopted at this time. The uniforms of the various local \\"Scottish\\" units were considered to be particularly colourful.

The woollen service dress of the previous war was re-issued, although trousers replaced breeches and cloth anklets were adopted instead of puttees. For summer or warm climates khaki drill-cotton clothing was issued. Units wore the shoulder patch of the corresponding unit of the 1st AIF, with a grey border to distinguish the unit from the Militia unit wearing the same patch. The shape of the grey indicated the division, which sometimes differed from that of the coloured part. Later, AIF personnel in Militia units were authorised to wear the grey border, resulting in some units wearing the same patches. The 9th Division replaced all its patches with a new type in the shape of a \\"T\\". As there were more units in the Second AIF than the First, many units wore patches of a new design.Glyde, Distinguishing Colour Patches of the Australian Military Forces 1915‚Äì1951: A Reference Guide, pp. 17‚Äì23 File:17th_Battalion_AIF_Unit_Colour_Patch.PNG17th Battalion 1921‚Äì1944 File:2-17th Battalion original colour patch.jpg2/17th Battalion 1940‚Äì1942 file:2 17th Battalion Australia Unit Colour Patch.PNG2/17th Battalion 1942‚Äì1946 Over-time the pre-war uniforms of the militia were replaced with khaki service dress and in 1942 regimental badges were universally replaced by the Rising Sun, with UCPs being the main distinction between troops of the Militia and AIF. Some minor changes to the appearance of the service dress jack occurred mid-war, while cloth anklets were also later by webbing gaiters. Meanwhile, during the course of the war uniform colour was changed to jungle green following the transfer of the bulk of Australian forces from the Middle East to the Pacific to fight against the Japanese in 1942. Troops hastily sent to New Guinea in the early stages of the campaign had to dye a lot of their existing khaki clothing green, although this tended to run in the heavy tropical rain. The British steel Brodie helmet continued to be used, including the Mark II model of 1940 and the Mark III model from 1944. Steel helmets were unpopular with the soldiers in the jungle climate. Some items of American equipment were adopted, such as long canvas gaiters. Eventually a range of equipment suitable for jungle conditions was specifically developed in order to meet the requirements of providing both suitable camouflage, as well protection against the mosquitos, fungal growth / mould, and mud prevalent in the tropical environment. This included studded boots, canvas gaiters, and cloth berets, in addition to other items of personal equipment. The establishment of a number of women's services by the Army during the war resulted in the development of a number of distinct uniforms, although these were mostly similar in colour and style to the uniform of the male services, including the wearing of trousers when in the field. Despite this the Australian Army Nursing Service opted to retain the grey serge that had been worn by nurses since before the previous war.

Meanwhile, the use of unit colour patches was discontinued with the raising of the Australian Regular Army in 1947, with units and corps instead distinguished by badges, many of which were similar to those worn by their British counterparts. Being a period of transition, in the early part of the Korean War troops usually wore the old service dress, while later they wore the new battle-dress. Regardless, troops in Korea often adopted a mix of whatever British or American equipment was available out of necessity, with an example being cold- weather equipment. Following this time the uniform of the Australian Army underwent a number of changes, mostly with a trend to increasing \\"drabness\\" due to an emphasis on camouflage in combat dress, as well as a reduction in the range of different types of uniform.

A cloth bush hat (also known as a \\"giggle-hat\\") was also worn when in the field. In situations where there was a higher risk of head injuries, such as when operating inside a Fire support base or travelling by APC the U.S M1 helmet was sometimes worn, often with flak jacket. In 1969 the shirt was updated with pockets added to the upper sleeves and the breast pockets became slanted, similar to the blouse pockets of the U.S. jungle fatigues worn in Vietnam. These new JGs were nicknamed the \\"pixie suit\\" (for the slant of the breast pockets resembling pixie ears.) To preserve professionalism and uniformity 1st Australian Task Force Command forbade the wearing of American jungle fatigues by Australian and New Zealand troops in Vietnam. However, due to supply deficiencies by their own government New Zealand soldiers and artillery men often personally acquired and wore U.S fatigues, despite these rules. In Vietnam elements of the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR) wore a variety of uniforms including the indigenous \\"tiger-stripe\\" (locally acquired), but more commonly the U.S ERDL Camouflage Tropical Combat Uniform. Personnel posted to South Vietnamese units, such as the Australian Army Training Team (AATTV), also often wore local uniforms.

This was later followed by an Australian version of the British Army service dress which consisted of a coat and trousers. In the early 1970s dress for servicewomen changed to the Australian-style, while in the 1980s they adopted the polyester uniform worn by servicemen (with a skirt added). The distinct Australian slouch hat continued to be worn. Meanwhile, in the 1970s and 1980s the Australian Army continued to mostly use the same field clothing and equipment that they had in Vietnam. Mess dress worn by officers also followed the pattern of that worn by the British Army, and included separate styles for summer and winter. =1980s to Present= The Army's jungle green uniform was replaced in the late 1980s by the Disruptive Pattern Camouflage Uniform (DPCU) which was specifically designed by the Defence Science and Technology Organisation and optimised for wear in the semi-arid bush of the Australian mainland. DPCU consists of five-tones with a greenish sand coloured background with randomly arranged spots of orange-brown, mid- brown, leaf-green and very dark green overlaid. At this time brown leather boots also replaced the wear of the black leather general purpose boot when in the field. Later, as a result of operations in the arid terrain of Iraq and Afghanistan in the 2000s a Disruptive Pattern Desert Uniform (DPDU) was introduced in 2006. Further changes later resulted in the adoption of the Australian Multicam Camouflage Uniform (AMCU), also known as \\"Multicam\\" (and similar to that worn by the US Army and British), from 2014. Using a hybrid pattern and colour palette it is intended to be able to be used in a wide range of terrain and will replace DPCU, DPDU, and other interim uniforms for operational and field use as the Army's only camouflage uniform. Current Australian Army orders of dress include ceremonial, general duties (polyesters), safari suit, DPCU, and mess dress (corps specific, worn by officers and senior NCOs for formal dining occasions), in addition to specific dress for armoured fighting vehicle crewmen, working / protective dress, maternity dress, and aircrew. DPCU is generally worn as dress of the day in barracks, and when in the field or on operations (although this is presently being replaced by AMCU). The current ceremonial uniform is known as \\"Service Dress\\". Changes to this uniform in 2016 have seen a return to a more traditional brown khaki worn prior to and during both World Wars, from the light olive drab khaki that was adopted in the 1990s as other items of dress were phased out. Darker than the previous uniform, it more closely matches the colour of the slouch hat. Ceremonial dress has also included the \\"Patrol Blue\\" and \\"White Jacket\\" orders of dress, although these were mostly worn at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In 2010, the Army discontinued the wear of \\"Patrol Blues\\", with cadets at Duntroon exclusively wearing \\"White Jacket\\" order of dress for ceremonial occasions such as graduation parade; however, this was later restored in 2017 with the \\"White Jacket\\" order of dress coming under the \\"Patrol Blue\\" order of dress. From 2013 soldiers have been issued elastic-sided R. M. Williams boots to be worn with general duty and ceremonial dress. Although the uniforms worn by the Australian Army have changed significantly over the past century, the accoutrements worn over this period have remained relatively similar. In the British Army regiments have traditionally often worn their own distinctive uniforms. However, in contrast there is very little practical difference between the dress of each unit in the Australian Army, with the majority of personnel wearing the same basic uniform (although there are some minor exceptions, worn on general duties and ceremonial uniforms‚Äîbut not DPCU when worn as dress of the day or in the field‚Äîfor instance with some units wearing black badges of rank, unit badges and other accoutrements, instead of the usual gold and yellow or silver and white worn respectively by all corps, while a number of \\"Scottish\\" companies and pipes and drum bands wear distinctive tartans and other items of traditional dress, including headdress, highland dress jacket, kilt, sporran, hose-top socks, and gaiters). Instead, the main uniform distinctions between corps and units include corps and regimental badges, berets, lanyards, and unit colour patches. Corps and regimental badges include both hat and collar badges (usually smaller versions of the hat badge). The majority of corps badges in the Australian Army are copied from the badges of the equivalent corps in the British Army. Berets colours include dark blue (worn by service corps and others not eligible to wear a special-to-corps or unit beret), black (armoured corps), rifle green (Royal Australian Regiment), fawn (SASR), sherwood green (commandos), dull cherry (airborne), scarlet (military police), slate grey (nursing corps), light blue (aviation), UN blue (personnel on service with the United Nations) and terracotta (Multinational Force and Observers contingents). Lanyards vary in colour by corps and unit are mostly worn on the right shoulder, although units of the infantry corps wear them on the left, as do some members of the artillery, and the Australian Federation Guard. Different colours and designs are allocated to each corps and many units. Unit colour patches were re-introduced in 1987 for units that could trace their lineage back to units of either the 1st or 2nd AIF, while the current Series II colour patch was adopted in 1995, introducing a system of patches designed for all units and organisations of the Army. At this time the practice of wearing patches on the shoulder ceased, and they were worn on the right-hand side of the puggaree on the slouch hat instead. Other accoutrements worn include: the rising sun badge (cloth version worn on left shoulder of all uniforms including DPCU, and metal badge worn on upturned side of slouch hat when worn on ceremonial occasions), aiguillettes (senior officers), emu plumes and bandoliers (both worn by armoured units), the Sam Browne belt (worn by officers and warrant officers), mostly of brown leather although the armoured, aviation and nursing corps wear black leather), infantry scarlet sash, gorget patches (senior officers), pace sticks (regimental sergeant majors), canes / swagger sticks, lances (armoured units on parade), bayonets, dirks (\\"Scottish\\" units), stiletto daggers (commandos), swords (Mameluke for general officers, also cavalry sabres, artillery swords, and infantry swords respectively, while the claymore is carried by officers in \\"Scottish\\" units). Headdress consists of the slouch hat or beret for general duties, although bonnets are also worn by \\"Scottish\\" units and pipes and drum bands (glengarry and balmoral for units, and feather for bands). The khaki service cap is no longer an optional headdress for officers, warrant officers and officer/staff cadets which could be worn with the service uniform on non-ceremonial occasions (the khaki service cap could be worn until September 2010), however the blue service cap is still worn mainly with the \\"Patrol Blue\\" order of dress by all ranks. Bush hats are worn in the field, while armoured corps and members of RFSUs often wear kepi hats.

Function This gene encodes a multipass transmembrane protein that functions as a key metabolic enzyme. The encoded protein catalyzes the conversion of diacylglycerol and fatty acyl CoA to triacylglycerol. This enzyme can also transfer acyl CoA to retinol. Activity of this protein may be associated with obesity and other metabolic diseases. This enzyme is essential for lactation in mice, and mutations in this gene affect the composition and volume of milk produced by both cattle and goats. Without this gene activity, infants who have a mutation in this gene are incapable of breaking down fat. This lack of capability to break down fat causes diarrhea and vomiting which eventually causes FTT (Failure to Thrive) and need of TPN (Total Parenteral Nutrition) if not given correct formula.

However, Labor had its majority in Drysdale redistributed away in 2008. However, by the time the writs were dropped for the 2016 election, the CLP's support in Palmerston had collapsed. One poll had the CLP on only 37 percent support in an area that had been a CLP stronghold for the better part of four decades. On election night, the CLP's primary vote collapsed by over 20 percent, and Lawler took the seat on a swing of over 16 percent. On 11 September 2016, Lawler was named to cabinet as Minister for Education. She was reelected in 2020 with a small swing in her favour, becoming the first Labor MP to win a second term in a Palmerston-based seat.

The marine park contains Dongjiyu, Xijiyu, Dongyupingyu, Xiyupingyu, and many smaller islands. It is governed by the Marine National Park Headquarters of Taiwan. There were 8403 visitors in 2017. History There were once thousands of people living on the islands. Because the area has little transportation and few jobs, the population has decreased, and there are now only about 50 people. In 2008, cold weather in Penghu killed a lot of marine life. The southern part of Penghu was less affected because it is at a lower latitude and was warmer. One of the reasons that the national park was established was that it could support a lot of marine life and become a \\"germplasm bank\\" of Penghu. The Penghu Columnar Basalt Nature Reserve Nanhai, containing Dongjiyu, Xijiyu and a few smaller islands, was established in 2008. South Penghu Marine National Park was established on 8 June 2014 and opened on 18 October 2014. Fishing is restricted in parts of the park. Some fishermen are concerned that the restrictions will affect fishing. The Marine National Park Headquarters says that the restrictions will make the fishing more sustainable. Description South Penghu Marine National Park is between 23¬∞14' and 23¬∞17' N, and between 119¬∞30' and 119¬∞40' E. It is in Wangan Township. Its total area is about 358.44 km2, with 354.73 km2 of water and 3.70 km2 of land. The islands have basalt landforms, including columnar basalt. There are abandoned houses and a few temples on the islands. There are also walls built of stone, called \\"cai zhai\\", that were used to protect vegetables from strong winds. There is a lighthouse on Dongjiyu. The \\"Blue Cave\\" is a sea cave on Xijiyu. Ecology Many species of migratory birds, such as terns, visit the islands.

There are 154 species of coral. There are also aquatic plants. Part of the warm Kuroshio Current flows to Penghu, supporting the marine life. Since 2010, the Marine National Park Headquarters and some other organizations have inspected the coral reefs and removed crown-of-thorns starfish, which eat coral. No large populations of crown-of-thorns starfish were found in 2014 and 2015. It is unclear if this was caused by the removal of the crown-of-thorns starfish or the life cycle of the starfish.

Politics Sievers ran in the 2016 Territory election as Labor's candidate in Brennan, held by CLP member and former Deputy Chief Minister Peter Chandler. On paper, Sievers faced long odds. Brennan was located in a particularly conservative area of Palmerston, and Sievers needed a 14-percent swing to win it‚Äîa daunting task under normal conditions. Labor had only taken the seat once, when opposition leader Denis Burke was famously defeated in his own seat in 2005.

Thirteen people were killed, including seven university students, one policeman, three security guards at the university, and a university professor (Naqib Ahmad Khpulwak). Fifty to at least 53 people were injured, some critically. Three of the attackers were killed by Afghan Special Forces. This was the first direct attack on the university, although two professors were kidnapped just outside the university a few weeks prior.  Background  Afghanistan had been experiencing a significant amount of terror attacks during the War in Afghanistan, including the large July 2016 Kabul bombing. In the past, incidents related to employees at the American University of Afghanistan include a terror attack on a restaurant in which around 21 people were killed, including two AUAF employees, and a kidnapping of two foreign professors by men dressed in Afghan National Police uniforms on August 7.Manila Bulletin, (19 January 2014) \\"IMF, UN Officials among 21 Killed in Kabul Suicide Attack\\" https://www.questia.com/read/1G1-355969463Seiff, Kevin, Washington Post, Washington, D.C.

The American University of Afghanistan was chartered in 2004 and established in 2006. It is an \\"Independent, self-governing, not-for-profit university operating on the US liberal arts model\\". It is Afghanistan's \\"top institution for higher education\\" with many foreign employees. It was started by Dr. Sharif Fayez and is supported by many prominent U.S. politicians.  Attack  The attack began at 19:03 during the evening classes at the university, when around 700 students were in attendance. The university was surrounded by a fortified wall. A truck filled with explosives was driven up to the wall and blown up, leaving a large hole in the wall. Two assailants then entered the compound, prompting employees and students to panic while fleeing and hiding. A nearly ten-hour-long siege then ensued, which lasted overnight. Hundreds of trapped students \\"pleaded for help\\" as an explosion followed gunshots, some sending messages on Twitter. Students used furniture in the classroom to barricade doors, with others making a \\"mad scramble to escape through windows\\" while pushing each other out, some from dangerous heights. Afghan National Army troops belonging to an elite unit led operations to secure the campus while exchanging gunfire with the assailants. United States led military coalition foreign troops assisted in the operations, including mentors from the Norwegian Special forces group Marinejegerkommandoen to rescue the 200 students trapped inside the school. Associated Press and Agence France-Presse photographer Massoud Hossaini was stuck and wounded inside the university and tweeted updates, along with other reporters such as CBS producer Ahmad Mukhtar. During the chaos, seven university students, one policeman, three security guards at the university, and one university professor were killed. A guard from a neighboring vocational school for visually impaired people was also killed. Most people were killed from bullets that traveled through windows. At least 50 to at least 53 people were also injured. Aftermath The Taliban was suspected to be behind the attack but has not yet claimed responsibility. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant is also a suspect. Laura Bush, a major supporter of the university, denounced the attack along with the U.S. State Department and offered her condolences. She also issued a statement. The American University of Afghanistan temporarily closed indefinitely \\"in the wake of the despicable terrorist attack on the university\\". University President Mark English was interviewed on the American National Public Radio. The university also issued a statement: AUAF English professor Raj Chandarlapaty reflected on the challenging plight of the university: The university reopened in March 2017.

It based on the 1970 novel of the same name by Whit Masterson. The movie appeared on the ABC Movie of the Week on October 26, 1971.pp. 107 Karol, Michael The ABC Movie of the Week Companion: A Loving Tribute to the Classic Series iUniverse, 2008 Plot Edward Young lives in Middletown, seemingly an idyllic 1950s small town. On returning home, he finds a letter that his unit has been activated, so he says a farewell to his girlfriend, Alice. He packs and leaves the town, which is revealed as a KGB training facility for sleeper agents. He has one final debriefing from Robert Barnes, his KGB superior. He spends the following years in the United States, rising to the position of newspaper publisher in Redwood Beach, California under the name Paul Towers. Preparing to visit his brother- in-law, Paul goes diving for abalone but is nearly killed when his SCUBA tank starts feeding him carbon dioxide instead of oxygen. His wife Sibby dives in to save him. Edward's brother-in-law, Hank Keller, is the head of a defense contractor where an executive's recent suicide has drawn the attention of the FBI. Vandamm, the victim, was homosexual and was being blackmailed by the Soviets for plans to a secret sonar system. Hank wants Paul to fill the vacant position. FBI agent Joe Chalk questions him harshly at the dinner and promises to thoroughly investigate his background for his security clearance, which concerns Paul. At a formal dinner party, Paul is called away due to problems with the newspaper presses. As he gets into his car, he is taken by surprise by a KGB agent, Nylec, in the back seat. The agent promises, \\"This time, the obituary will be real.\\" Paul manages to overcome Nylec, knocking him off the pier. But he can't bring himself to shoot the agent in the water. He returns home, where Sybil believes he's keeping secrets from her and runs out of the room. He finds a pregnancy test which is positive. Deciding to come clean, he visits Joe Chalk's hotel room and confesses his true identity and how he assumed Paul Towers' identity after he decided to defect and failed to board a plane that crashed with no survivors. Chalk is skeptical of his story but Paul bargains, offering to identify Barnes, whom he believes was Vandamm's KGB contact. Paul returns home where he still keeps the truth from Sibby but tells her he will accept the job. Paul contacts an attorney who can put him in touch with Barnes. He's told to go to a street corner, which he recognizes as the model for Middletown. Alice is there. They bargain for the plans and reminisce. Afterward, Chalk arranges to give certain sheets of plans to trap Barnes with. Paul gets a notice on his car to go to an old mine. A helicopter intercepts him on a dirt road and Barnes gets out of it. He explains that he saw Paul's picture under an editorial and recognized him, hence the attempts to kill him. Paul gives him the sheets but Barnes is unsatisfied. He has a plan for Paul to photograph the most critical sheets. One day at lunch, Nylec sets fire to a car to distract Chalk so Paul can copy the plans. Paul and Chalk make plans for Paul to identify Barnes for arrest as he leaves their meeting. At a restaurant, Barnes appears, identifying himself as Dr. Shevlin, Sibby's boss. He hints that he's holding Sibby hostage and her safety depends on his own continued freedom. Paul identifies an innocent bystander to Chalk and goes to Sibby's workplace, where he finds her unconscious. Alice confronts him at gunpoint as he pleads for Sibby's life. Nylec enters to kill Paul. Alice shoots Nylec to save Paul, who in turn shoots both Paul and Alice. Chalk stages Paul's funeral and they watch from a helicopter. He tells Paul that with Barnes still on the loose, Sibby cannot be safe if anyone suspects Paul is still alive. Paul, again a man who does not legally exist, reluctantly agrees to help the FBI track down the other sleeper agents, who have all adopted new covers. Cast * Doug McClure ...

Tel Aviv-Yafo Municipality handles such municipal affairs as education, culture, social welfare, infrastructure, urban planning and sanitation. The current head of the municipality is Ron Huldai. History Meir Dizengoff was appointed head of the town planning in 1911. When Tel Aviv was recognized as a city, Dizengoff was elected mayor, remaining in office until his death. The Tel Aviv municipality was initially located on Rothschild Boulevard. When more office space was needed, the municipality rented a hotel on Bialik Street, near the home of national poet Chaim Nachman Bialik, which had been built by the Skura family in 1924. The hotel had opened for business in 1925 but closed due to the lack of tourists. In 1928, the municipality bought the hotel. A new city hall was designed in the 1950s by architect Menachem Cohen, in the Brutalist style. The large plaza, Rabin Square, at the foot of the building was designed as a central area for public events and ceremonies. It is located on Ibn Gabirol Street. In 1972, the old building was converted into a museum for the history of Tel Aviv. Administration The municipality is governed by a 31-member council elected by proportional representation every five years. Parties represented include One Tel Aviv Labour/Kadima faction, the Senior Citizens faction, the New Movement-Meretz and the Greens, the Likud and a number of religious parties such as Shas. Tel Aviv mayor Roni Milo of Likud was governing with a broad coalition of parties. He was defeated by Huldai in the municipal elections of November 1998. In 2003, Huldai was re-elected by a wide margin. He replaced the system of administration in which municipal divisions were headed by aldermen representing different coalition factions with a centralized system in which divisions are headed by top civil servants who report to him.

Description  The prickly shrub typically grows to a height of and has non- glaucous branchlets. It has simple, dissected, subpinnatisect leaves with a blade that is . It blooms from May to September and produces a terminal raceme irregular inflorescence with green or yellow flowers and orange styles. Later it forms red-brown simple hairy oblong to ovoid fruit that is long. The plant has papery bark that in sheds minni ritchi style in long strips. It regenerates from seed only. G. spinosa is similar to Grevillea pteridifolia and Grevillea eriostachya, both of which have longer, non-pungent, pliable leaf lobes. Grevillea spinosa is found around Wiluna from the Canning Stock Route to the Little Sandy Desert and as far south as Yeelirrie Station. It grows on stony ridges and in gravelly, sandy or loamy soils often over sandstone. The plant is used in gardens as an informal screen, informal hedge or barrier that is able to tolerate dry soils and light frosts.

She tended to foreigners who were admitted into these hospitals such as Russian and British people and was hailed as an \\"Angel of Love\\" due to her affectionate care of the patients under her care. Her cause for sainthood was initiated under Pope Paul VI on 9 January 1976 and she was titled as a Servant of God before Pope John Paul II named her as Venerable on 1 September 1988 and later beatified her on 7 October 2001. Life Emma √úffing was born in the German Empire on 8 April 1914 as the ninth of eleven children to August √úffing (1868 - 8 December 1932) and Maria Schmidt (1878-1975) - her father's second marriage. √úffing received her baptism mere hours later in the parish church of Halverde. She had at least five sisters and four brothers. In October 1915 she contracted some form of rickets that stunted her growth as a result and also left her in the shadow of poor health for the remainder of her life. √úffing made her First Communion on 27 April 1924 and received her Confirmation on 3 September 1924 from Bishop Johannes Poggenburg. In her childhood she worked on her parents' farm (until she turned seventeen) and felt called to the religious life in her adolescence in 1928. She then commenced a period of apprenticeship in the field of housekeeping management at the hospital of Saint Ann in Hopsten on 1 November 1931 and concluded this period of education in May 1933. During this period she came to know the Clemens Sisters and met the superior Euthymia Linnenk√§mper who appreciated her attitude of constant service to others. She returned home in December 1932 to tend to her ailing father though he later died not long after she returned on 8 December 1932. On 25 March 1934 - with the explicit permission of her mother - she sent a letter to the motherhouse of the Clemens Sister in M√ºnster asking to be admitted into the order though the superiors were hesitant due to her frail health; the superiors later relented and approved of her request to be admitted and she became one of 47 other postulants. √úffing entered the Clemens Sisters on 23 July 1933 and at once assumed her new religious name in honor of the nun she once knew with the same name. She took her initial vows on 11 October 1936 and made her full solemn profession on 15 September 1940. After she made her initial vows she sent a letter to her mother in which she said: \\"I found Him who my heart loves; I want to hold Him and never let him go\\". In October 1936 she was assigned to work at Saint Vincent's Hospital in Dinslaken and she graduated from her nursing program with special distinctions on 3 September 1939 - not long after the start of World War II with the Polish invasion. The nun worked as a nurse during the conflict and in 1943 was assigned to nurse prisoners of war and foreign workers who had infectious diseases and she tended to the likes of British and Ukrainian people though Polish and Russian foreigners would later flood in. One of her P.O.W. patients - Father Emile Esche - said: \\"Sister Euthymia's life was a canticle of hope in the midst of the war\\". The conclusion of the war in 1945 saw her assigned to the washrooms of the Dinslaken hospital and later on 14 January 1948 saw her sent to work in her order's motherhouse and the Saint Raphael Clinic in M√ºnster. She was ill for a brief period of time after contracting a high fever on 24 March 1945 while working. On 8 July 1955 she was diagnosed with bowel cancer after she experienced a sudden collapse while at work in the washhouse. At the end of August 1955 she suffered an extreme fever and was confined to her bed - she also requested for the Anointing of the Sick. √úffing died at 7:30am on 9 September 1955 from bowel cancer; she had received her final Communion at 6:00am. During her viewing - before her funeral - a fellow sister went to her remains asking for her intercession in healing a hand she had burned in an ironing accident, of which she was later healed. Her remains were exhumed in 1985 and were reburied. Beatification Chapel containing her tomb. The beatification process commenced under Pope Paul VI on 9 January 1976 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" ('nothing against') to the cause and titled her as a Servant of God. The cognitional process was then held in M√ºnster and received validation from the C.C.S. on 14 December 1981. The submission of the official Positio dossier to the C.C.S. in 1986 allowed for a board of theologians to voice their approval to the cause's merits in their meeting of 12 January 1988 while the cardinal and bishop members of the C.C.S. themselves also granted their approval to the cause on 26 April 1988. This in turn allowed for Pope John Paul II to issue his final approval and name √úffing as Venerable on 1 September 1988 after confirming that the late nun had in fact lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle required for her beatification was investigated in the German diocese of its origin and after the process received the validation of the C.C.S. on 10 July 1992 which allowed for a special medical board to evaluate the documents presented to them and approve the cause on 4 March 1999. A board of theologians likewise approved the healing to be a legitimate miracle in their meeting of 22 October 1999 while the C.C.S. issued their own approval on 7 March 2000. John Paul II issued his final approval to the miracle on 1 July 2000 and beatified √úffing on 7 October 2001 in Saint Peter's Square. The current postulator assigned to this cause is Dr. Andrea Ambrosi.

A County of Thurgau (Landgrafschaft Thurgau) existed from the 13th century until 1798. Parts of Thurgau were acquired by the Old Swiss Confederacy during the early 15th century, and the entire county passed to the Confederacy as a condominium in 1460. The county became the Canton of Thurgau within the Helvetic Republic in 1798, and with the Act of Mediation of 1803 a canton of the restored Confederacy.  Alamannic pagus  The Turgowe pagus within Alamannia was named for the Thur, and it included the entire Alamannic territory between Upper Rhine and Reuss. With the Alamannic settlement of Central Switzerland in the 6th to 8th centuries, Turgowe included most of what is now Northeastern and Central Switzerland. Odilo, son of duke Gotfrid, was count of Turgowe between 709 and 736 (when he acceded as duke of Bavaria). After the Council of Cannstatt, a Frankish nobleman named Warin is recorded as count in Thurgau for the year 754.J. Fleckenstein, Die Grafen Alemanniens in merowingischer und karolingischer Zeit (1986), 229-236. In the 9th century, Z√ºrichgau was detached from Thurgau, so that Thurgau was now bounded to the west by the T√∂ss basin. (the Allmen range west of the T√∂ss), corresponding in area to what is now Thurgau, Appenzell, parts of St. Gallen (F√ºrstenland and Toggenburg), and the parts of Z√ºrich east of the T√∂ss. Hunfriding counts of Thurgau in the 9th to 10th centuries include Adalbert II (854, 894), Udalrich (912, 917) and Burchard III (920).J. Bergmann in: Denkschriften der Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften 4 (1853), facing p. 71. With the Battle of Winterthur (919), Burchard II, Duke of Swabia asserted his control over the Thurgau against the claims of Rudolph II of Burgundy. The most important cities of Thurgovia in the early medieval period were Constance as the seat of the bishop, and St. Gallen for its abbey. County of Thurgau Destruction of Ittingen Charterhouse in the Swiss Reformation 1524 (Heinrich Thomann, c. 1605) The dukes of Z√§hringen and the counts of Kyburg took over much of the land in the High Middle Ages. With the extinction of the counts of Kyburg in 1264, control of the Thurgau reverted to the Habsburgs. The Old Swiss Confederacy allied with ten freed bailiwicks of the former Toggenburg seized the lands of the Thurgau from the Habsburgs in 1460, and it became a subject territory of seven Swiss cantons (Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug and Glarus). During the Protestant Reformation in Switzerland, both the Catholic and emerging Reformed parties sought to swing the subject territories, such as the Thurgau, to their side. In 1524, in an incident that resonated across Switzerland, local peasants occupied the cloister of Ittingen in the Thurgau, driving out the monks, destroying documents, and devastating the wine-cellar. Between 1526 and 1531, most of the Thurgau's population adopted the new Reformed faith spreading from Zurich; Zurich's defeat in the War of Kappel (1531) ended Reformed predominance. Instead, the First Peace of Kappel protected both Catholic and Reformed worship, though the provisions of the treaty generally favored the Catholics, who also made up a majority among the seven ruling cantons. Religious tensions over the Thurgau were an important background to the First War of Villmergen (1656), during which Zurich briefly occupied the Thurgau.  Modern history  Coat of arms of Thurgau (1803).based on the coat of arms of the House of Kyburg which ruled the Thurgau in the 13th century, changing the background to green-and-white, at the time considered \\"revolutionary\\" colours (c.f. tricolour); as the placement of a yellow (or) charge on white (argent) is a violation of heraldic principles, there have been suggestions to modify the design, including a 1938 suggestion to use a solid green field divided by a diagonal white line, but they were not successful. Thurgau became an administrative unit of the Helvetic Republic in April 1798. It acceded the Swiss Confederacy as a full canton with the Act of Mediation of 1803. A new, liberal cantonal constitution was drawn up in 1831. Thurgau sided with the anti-Catholic party in the Kulturkampf in Switzerland, dissolving its monasteries in 1848. The electorate supported the Swiss Constitution of 1848 and its revision in 1874. A new constitution of 1869 strengthened elements of direct democracy introducing the popular referendum and the direct election of the cantonal executive. The cantonal current constitution dates to 1987.  References  * . * . * Gn√§dinger, Beat (ed.): Abbruch ‚Äì Umbruch ‚Äì Aufbruch: zur Helvetik im Thurgau.

This effect is typical, for example, for relative frequencies (empirical probabilities) of mass events and averages. This phenomenon is widespread and so can be regarded as a fundamental natural phenomenon. The physical nature of the statistical stability phenomenon is revealed by observing the mass events. Currently two theories are known that describe this phenomenon. They are the classical probability theory, which has a long history of development, and the theory of hyper-random phenomena, created in recent decades.  History  The first to draw attention to the phenomenon of statistical stability was the cloth merchant J. Graunt (1620‚Äì1674) Graunt, J.: Natural and Political Observations Made Upon the Bills of Mortality. Baltimore (1939) in 1662. Information about research on statistical stability is fragmentary for the period from the end of the seventeenth century to the end of the nineteenth century, e.g., by Jacob Bernoulli (1654‚Äì1705), Simeon Denis Poisson (1781‚Äì1840), Irenee-Jules Bienayme (1796‚Äì1878), Antoine Augustin Cournot (1801‚Äì1877), Adolphe Quetelet (1796‚Äì1874), John Venn (1834‚Äì1923), etc.Scheinin, O.B.: Teoriya Veroyatnostey.

Centre for System Research, Institute of the History of Nature and Technique of the RAS, Moscow (2004) Systematic study of statistical stability began at the end of the nineteenth century. In 1879, the German statistician Wilhelm Lexis (1837‚Äì1914) made the first attempt to link the concept of statistical stability of the relative frequency with the dispersion. At the turn of the century and in the early twentieth century, statistical stability was studied by Karl Pearson (1857‚Äì1936), Alexander Alexandrovich Chuprov (1874‚Äì1926), Ladislaus Bortkiewicz (1868‚Äì1931), Andrey Markov (1856‚Äì1922), Richard von Mises (1883‚Äì1953), and others. A new stage of experimental research began in the late twentieth century. Additional studies became necessary due to the new applied tasks and the detection of a number of phenomena that cannot be satisfactorily explained and described within the framework of the classical probability theory. The new tasks are, in particular, the ultra-precise measurement of physical quantities and ultra- precise forecasting of developments over large intervals of observation. The relatively new phenomena are, for instance, an unpredictable measurement progressive (drift) error,Sergeev, A.G., Krokhin, V.V.: Metrologiya (Metrology).

Statistical stability of the relative frequencies of events  Many well‚Äìknown scientists led experimental investigations of the statistical stability phenomenon. It is known, for example, that coin-tossing experiments were studied by P.S. de Laplace (1749‚Äì1827), Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707‚Äì1788), Karl Pearson, Nobel Prize Laureate Richard Feynman (1918‚Äì1988), Augustus de Morgan (1806‚Äì1871), William Stanley Jevons (1835‚Äì1882), Vsevolod Ivanovich Romanovsky (1879‚Äì1954), William Feller (1906‚Äì1970), and others.

Results of coin-tossing experiments carried out by different scientists Mosteller et al. 1961) Experimental studies of other real physical events show that for a high number of experiments the relative frequencies of events are stabilized; that shows the fundamental nature of the phenomenon of statistical stability.  Stability of statistics  The phenomenon of statistical stability is manifested not only in the stability of the relative frequency of mass events, but also in the stability of the average of the process, or its sample mean. The phenomenon of statistical stability is manifested in the case of averaging of fluctuations that are of different types, in particular, of the stochastic, determinate, and actual physical processes. Example 1. In Fig. 1a and Fig. 1c the realization of noise with a uniform power spectral density (white noise) and a determinate period process are presented. In Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d the dependencies of the averages on the averaging interval are shown. As can be seen from Fig. 1b and Fig. 1d, when the averaging interval increases, fluctuations in the sample mean decrease and the average value gradually stabilizes. Fig. 1. Realization of white Gaussian noise (a) and harmonic oscillation (c), together with the dependencies of the corresponding sample mean on the averaging interval (b, d) Example 2. Fig. 2a and Fig. 2b show how the mains voltage in a city fluctuates quickly, while the average changes slowly. As the averaging interval increases from zero to one hour, the average voltage stabilizes (Fig. 2 b). Fig. 2. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 1.8 hours The phenomenon of statistical stability is observed in the calculation also other statistics, in particular, sample moments.  Properties of statistical stability  = Emergence = The statistical stability of the relative frequency is a property of mass (multiple) events. This property is not inherent in a single event, but is inherent in their collection. Similarly, the statistical stability of statistics is a property inherent to the set of samples. Therefore, the statistical stability of relative frequency or statistical stability of statistics can be regarded as an emergent property. = Hypothesis of perfect statistical stability = At first glance, it seems quite plausible that the sequence of relative frequencies p_1(A), p_2(A), \\\\ldots of any real event A should tend to a certain value P(A) (probability), and the sequence of the sample averages y_1,y_2,\\\\ldots of discrete samples of any real process should have a limit m, viz. \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}p_n=P(A) , \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty} y_n=m . This is the hypothesis of perfect (ideal) statistical stability. Probability theory is based on this hypothesis. = Criticism of the hypothesis of perfect statistical stability = For many years, the hypothesis of ideal statistical stability was not in doubt, although some scholars (even Andrey Kolmogorov (1903‚Äì1987) Kolmogorov, A. N.: Teoriya veroyatnostey (Probability theory). In: Matematika, ee Metody i Znachenie (Mathematics, its Methods and Importance) 2, pp. 252‚Äì284 (1956) Kolmogorov, A. N.

N.: Teoriya Veroyatnostey (Probability Theory). Moskovskiy universitet, Moscow (1972)), and others) noticed that, in the real world, this hypothesis is valid only with certain reservations. = The hypothesis of imperfect statistical stability = The possibility of adequate description of relative frequencies of actual events and sample averages of actual discrete samples by the expressions \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}p_n=P(A) , \\\\lim_{n \\\\to \\\\infty}y_n=m is only a hypothesis. It does not follow from any experiments and any logical inferences. It is easy to demonstrate that not all processes, even oscillatory type, have the property of perfect statistical stability. Example 3. In Fig. 3a and Fig. 3c two determinate oscillations are presented and in Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d are shown according to their averages. It is clear from Fig. 3b and Fig. 3d that in both cases, the average does not have a limit, i.e., both processes are statistically unstable. Fig. 3. Statistically unstable oscillations (a, c) and corresponding averages (b, d) Experimental studies of various processes of different physical nature over broad observation intervals show that the hypothesis of perfect statistical stability is not confirmed'. The real world is continuously changing, and changes occur at all levels, including the statistical level. Statistical assessments formed on the basis of relatively small observation intervals are relatively stable. Their stability is manifested through a decrease in the fluctuation of statistical estimators when the volume of statistical data grows. This creates an illusion of perfect statistical stability. However, beyond a certain critical volume, the level of fluctuations remains practically unchanged (and sometimes even grows) when the amount of the data is increased. This indicates that the statistical stability is not perfect. Example 4. Non-perfect statistical stability is illustrated Fig. 4 ,Gorban, I.I.: Phenomenon of statistical stability. Technical Physics 59(3), 333‚Äì340 (2014) which presents mains voltage fluctuations over 2.5 days. Note the fluctuation in Fig. 2a shows beginning part of the fluctuation presented in Fig 4a. As can be seen from Fig. 4b, the sample average does not stabilize, even for very long averaging intervals. Fig. 4. Dependence of the mains voltage (a) and the corresponding average (b) on time over 60 hours  Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability  = Hilbert‚Äôs sixth problem = Until the end of the nineteenth century probability theory was regarded as a physical discipline. At the Second International Congress of mathematicians (1900) David Hilbert (1862‚Äì1943) gave a speech entitled ‚ÄòMathematical problems‚Äô.Aleksandrov, P.S. (ed.): Problemy Hilberta (Hilbert‚Äôs Problems). Nauka, Moscow (1969) Here he formulated what he considered to be the twenty three most important problems whose study could significantly stimulate the further development of science. The sixth problem was the mathematical description of the axioms of physics. In the part of his presentation relating to this problem, Hilbert noted that, in parallel with research on the foundations of geometry, one could approach the problem of an axiomatic construction, along the same lines, of the physical sciences in which mathematics played an exclusive role, and in particular, probability theory and mechanics. Many scientists have responded to Hilbert‚Äôs appeal. Among them were Richard von Mises, who considered the problem from the standpoint of natural science, and Andrey Kolmogorov, who proposed in 1929 the solution based on set theory and measure theory. The axiomatic approach proposed by A. N. Kolmogorov Kolmogorov, A. N. Osnovnye Ponyatiya Teorii Veroyatnostey (Fundamentals of Probability Theory). ONTI, Moscow (1974) is now favoured in probability theory. This approach has even been elevated to the rank of a standard.ISO 3534‚Äì1: Statistics. Vocabulary and symbols. Part I: General statistical terms and terms used in probability (2006) = Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability in the framework of probability theory = Kolmogorov‚Äôs probability theory is a typical mathematical discipline. In it, the subject matter is an abstract probability space and the scope of research is the mathematical relationships between its elements. The physical phenomenon of statistical stability of the relative frequency of events which constitutes the foundation of this discipline formally would not then appear to play any role. This phenomenon is taken into account in an idealized form by accepting the axiom of countable additivity, which is equivalent to acceptance of the hypothesis of perfect statistical stability. = Description of the phenomenon of statistical stability in the framework of the theory of hyper-random phenomena = In contrast to the classical mathematical probability theory, the theory of hyper-random phenomena is physical-mathematical one. Its subject matter is phenomenon of statistical stability and the scope of research is adequate description of it by so-called hyper-random models (hyper-random phenomena) taking into account the violation of statistical stability.Gorban, I.I. The Statistical Stability Phenomenon ‚Äî Springer, 2017. ‚Äî 361 p. ‚Äî The theory of hyper-random phenomena does not erase the achievements of probability theory and classical mathematical statistics, but complements them, extending the statements of these disciplines to a sphere in which they had not yet been considered where there is no convergence of statistics.  Parameters of statistical stability  There are a number of parameters characterizing the statistical stability, in particular, the parameters of statistical instability with respect to the average, the parameters of statistical instability with respect to the standard deviation, intervals of statistical stability with respect to the average, standard deviation, and other statistics, and so forth. The mathematically correct determination of these parameters and the development of a methodology for their estimation in case of unlimited and limited sample sizes are studied within the framework of the theory of hyper-random phenomena.  The areas of effective use of various approaches for description of the statistical stability phenomenon  The main parameters defining the bounds of the effective using of classical probability theory and the theory of hyper-random phenomena are intervals of statistical stability with respect to various statistics. Within these intervals the violations of statistical stability are negligible and therefore the use of probability theory is possible and reasonable. Outside these intervals the violations of statistical stability are essential and therefore it is necessary to use the methods that take into account these violations, in particular, the methods of the theory of hyper-random phenomena. The limitations of statistical stability become apparent for large sample sizes and in the passage to the limit. Sample sizes are often small and therefore many practical tasks can be solved with acceptable accuracy using random (stochastic) models. Such models are usually simpler than the hyper-random models, so are preferred for not very large sample sizes. However, the hyper-random models have obvious advantages over the stochastic and other simpler models in cases when the limited statistical character of statistical stability becomes apparent, usually for long observation intervals and large sample sizes. Therefore, the primary application of the hyper-random models is to statistically analyze various physical processes (electrical, magnetic, electromagnetic, acoustic, hydroacoustic, seismic-acoustic, meteorological, and others) of long duration, as well as high precision measurements of various physical quantities and the forecasting of physical processes by statistical processing of large data sets. Twenty first century research shows that hyper-random models can be useful for solving other tasks too, for instance, in designing of radio electronic equipment.Uvarov, B.M.: Methods for representing the characteristics of radioelectronic equipment on the basis of the hyper-random phenomena theory.

Distribution This species can be found throughout Europe as far west as Great Britain, North Africa and the Middle East and eastwards to Mongolia.

Habitat and ecology Adult wasps run on wet stones exposed in gravel stream beds, flying between them and the stream banks, and can also be found at the margins of pools formed in sand and gravel pits. The flight period is from June to September in Britain. In the northern German lowlands there may be two generations per year. A. concinnus overwinters in the last larval stage and the males appear from the end of May. The males often break into cells to mate with newly emerged females. The prey of A. concinnus consist of spiders of the family Lycosidae. The wasps search for the spiders under stones. In sand pit pools, females prey on spiders that run over the surface of the very shallow water near the edges. Females excavate multiple cells beneath stones which are stocked with spiders. In north-west Germany, A. concinnus has been found nesting in urban areas between paving stones; nests may be as deep as 9 cm and contain up to seven cells. Spiders, which are captured after the cells have been excavated, are placed one in each cell. Females may rob each other's cells, and fighting may occur. Anoplius infuscatus has been recorded kleptoparasiting A. concinnus in Italy: female A. infuscatus may enter the nest of A. concinnus and destroy the egg already laid on the prey before placing one of its own.

He spent most of his life in England. Biography Core grew up in New Orleans, the son of a well-to-do family. At just seven he won the Vieux Carr√© Open Artists Competition. He was sent to a military academy, and from 1963 to the Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts. He attended Harvard University, where he won a number of art and literature prizes. As a schoolboy he self-published a booklet of drawings Palm Fronde Alphabet. An interest in Aubrey Beardsley and fin de si√®cle artists and writers, led to him spending time in Paris working with Philippe Jullian on his book The Symbolists, before returning to Harvard to complete an honours thesis on Belgian symbolist Fernand Khnopff. He graduated in 1973. Under the pseudonym F√©llipp√© Fecit, he produced a series of erotic drawings for the poet John Glassco for his book Squire Hardman, and in 1968 in the Japanese style for The Temple of Pederasty, a free adaption by Glassco of a work by Japanese expatriate writer Ken Sato. Of this time, George Melly wrote of Core: \\"an exaggerated child of that extraordinary decade, he made experimental films, bought and designed for a New York boutique, illustrated rather outr√© books published in limited editions, and worked on an extreme persona. He was untypical only in his lack of interest in drugs. As someone for whom hallucinatory powers were already part of his armoury, and for whom work is of primary importance, chemical stimulae appeared not only unnecessary, but a threat to creation.\\"Core, Philip; Melly, George Philip Core: Paintings 1975-1985, Gay Mens Press, London 1985 Following Harvard he attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art in Oxford, and then the Accademia di Belle Arti di Firenze in Florence. In 1975, in his mid-twenties, he settled permanently in London, living in a flat in Elephant and Castle that was painted completely black. It was an economically depressed period in the UK, but Core managed to gain some income contributing art work to gay magazines, and via private commissions. These included a mural for the Ritz hotel depicting a range of guests over the 75-year history of the hotel. He became the photography critic for The Independent, and wrote also number of obituaries for the newspaper, including those for Robert Mapplethorpe and Jean-Michel Basquiat. 1984 saw the publication by him of two books: Camp: The Lie That Tells The Truth, and The Original Eye: arbiters of twentieth-century taste. His encyclopaedic knowledge of lesser-known figures in nineteenth and twentieth century culture led to him becoming a commentator on the BBC Radio 4 programme Kaleidoscope. Core died of AIDS November 1989 at the Westminster Hospital in London. In a catalogue of an exhibition of his work, Core wrote: \\"I am not a great artist, only someone who loves painting, drawing and making things with his hands above all else; someone who has, by some curious gift of heredity, become possessed of articulacy and intransigence in equal degree; someone who knows what they love and feels no shame about it.\\"Core, Philip Claustrophobia: Painting and Sculpture by Philip Core, Watermans Art Center, Brentford, 1988 His work is in the collection of the Arts Council of Great Britain.

It was originally headquartered in San Antonio but later moved its offices to Houston. It was initially a daily publication, but the frequency later changed to weekly. By 2014 it was no longer in print and became online-only. History It was established in 2004 by Colombia-born Edward Schumacher Matos and Jonathan Friedland. Both men both formerly worked for The Wall Street Journal, the former as an editor and the latter as the Los Angeles bureau chief, and Schumacher also formerly worked for The New York Times as a foreign correspondent. The Spanish company Recoletos spent $16.5 million to develop Rumbo. The company Meximerica Media launched the newspaper, which initially had a daily frequency. the daily circulation was 100,000, and there were 86 editorial staff originating from various countries. Regular contributors to the newspaper included Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa, two writers. As a result of the establishment of El Rumbo, English language newspapers in Texas acquired smaller Spanish language papers and/or established their own Spanish language divisions in order to compete with Rumbo. In 2006 Rumbo laid off about 25% of the employees who worked at the San Antonio headquarters. It was previously distributed in the Austin metropolitan area, but in April 2006 Austin distribution ended. By 2007 the paper was a weekly, not daily, publication. In 2007 ImpreMedia LLC had acquired Rumbo. The paper, initially headquartered in San Antonio, later relocated its offices to Houston. Eventually the San Antonio and Valley editions ceased, so only the Houston edition remained. Until circa January 2014 Jes√∫s del Toro was the Rumbo editor and general manager. By then he was promoted to ImpreMedia's editorial director for all weekly publications. Around that time Rumbo, which was using freelance writers, received a new local editor. The final print edition of El Rumbo was on May 30, 2014. On June 6 of that year the paper announced that there would be no more print versions, with online versions remaining, due to reduction of costs.

It was founded in January 2015, when the governance of the sport transferred from the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association (CPISRA) to the IFCPF. It is a member organization, with members from five different continental zones. The IFCPF has relationships with other international association football sporting bodies. It organizes tournaments for the sport, and is in charge of Paralympic Games inclusion and participation. The IFCPF is a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) signatory, and international footballers may be subject to out-of- competition doping controls.  History  From 1978 to 2014, cerebral palsy football was governed by the CPISRA. In January 2015, governance of the sport was taken over by the newly created International Federation of Cerebral Palsy Football.  Governance  The President of IFCPF is Jan-Hein Evers of Netherlands. The organisation's Secretary General is Sam Turner of England.  Members  The IFCPF is organized zonally, with members belonging to one of five continental zones. These zones are Africa, the Americas, Asia, Europe and Oceania. These members are often either national cerebral palsy football associations, national cerebral palsy sports federations, national Paralympic committees, or national football associations. The type of member in the IFCPF varies by country.  Relationships  The IFCPF has been trying to establish relationships with other international football organizations. In 2016, it signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Asian Football Confederation. Part of this involved the AFC supporting an AFC Youth CP Football Tournament in 2017. In 2014, 2015 and 2016, IFCPF was getting financial support from UEFA.  Activities  Among the activities the organization does is to organize international tournaments for cerebral palsy football. This includes the qualification tournament for the IFCPF World Championships, and the IFCPF World Championships themselves. The IFCPF is in charge of the sport's Paralympic efforts. They set the team qualifying criteria for the Paralympic Games. They were also involved in the request to keep cerebral palsy football on the program for the 2020 Summer Paralympics. The sports removal came as a surprise to the organization.  Anti-Doping  The IFCPF is a WADA signatory. In 2016, after getting an endorsement by the World AntiDoping Agency (WADA), the IFCPF Anti-Doping Code was formally amended to allow for out of competition testing. This was done through a WADA approved Whereabouts Programme managed through ADAMS. Drawing from players in a Registered Testing Pool, 10 players from 9 countries were initially included ahead of the 2016 Summer Paralympics in Rio. These countries included Netherlands, Japan, Russia, Iran, Argentina, Ireland, Ukraine, England, and Brazil.  Rankings  The IFCPF ranks national teams. Rankings are based on tournament placement, with a factoring done to give additional weight to the Paralympic Games and IFCPF World Championships.  World wide participation  Cerebral palsy football has world-wide reach, and is played on all five continents. Many countries have IFCPF recognized national championships and national leagues. In 2010, there were 12 countries with IFCPF recognized competitions. The number grew to 21 by 2015. { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\"; width=1000px - ! rowspan=2 style=\\"width: 5%;\\"  ! rowspan=2 style=\\"width:15%;\\" Federation Federation refers only to IFCPF recognized federations who is a member of the IFCPF.

The nun studied foreign languages and literature before the outbreak that turned into World War II in which her convent was turned into a field hospital for prisoners of war as well as a place to do forced labor for the Nazi soldiers. The sainthood cause commenced under Pope Paul VI on 24 March 1968 after she became titled as a Servant of God and Pope John Paul II later named her as Venerable - upon the confirmation of her heroic virtue - on 18 December 2000 while presiding over her beatification in Poland not long after on 18 August 2002. Life Statue. Janina Szymkowiak was born in Poland in 1910 as the last of five children to Augustine Szymkowiak and Maria Duchalska as their sole daughter. She was baptized not long after in the month of her birth. One brother was a priest named Eric. Her initial education in a school lasted from 1916 until 1919 and the family relocated in 1921 after her parents bought a house in another city. Following the successful completion of her high school education in 1929 (after passing her examinations in May 1928) she studied several languages in addition to foreign languages at college in Pozna≈Ñ. She became a member of the \\"Sodality of Mary\\", where she became well known amongst its members for her personal interest in aiding the poor and in aiding those who were suffering from personal problems to which she found the time to help them with. In summer 1934 she undertook a pilgrimage to Lourdes in France where she began to experience the call to the religious life and decided to entrust herself while there to the Blessed Virgin Mary. Until 1935 she spent time with the Congregation of the Oblate Sisters of the Sacred Heart at Montlu√ßon and then returned home in 1936. On 27 June 1936 she became a member of the Daughters of the Sorrowful Mother of God and assumed the religious name of \\"Sancja\\" on 29 July 1937. Her mother had once tried to dissuade her daughter from joining the religious life and failed to have her son dissuade her. She became noted for her strong and strict adherence to the rule of the order. Szymkowiak made her initial vows on 30 July 1938 and worked until 1939 in a nursery school where she began to study pharmacology though the outbreak of World War II stopped this. The Nazi forces invaded Poland on 1 September 1939 and when the town she was in was occupied the invaders ordered them to care for German soldiers in addition to the English and French prisoners of war. Due to her language studies she served as a translator for these prisoners and did all the other forced labor work that the Germans ordered her and the other nuns to do. In February 1940 she was granted permission to go back to her family for a brief visit but she decided instead to remain with her fellow religious. The nun contracted tuberculosis due to this work but managed to make her solemn profession on 6 July 1942 weeks before she died due to her ailment. She died in the morning of 29 August 1942 after receiving the Eucharist as she requested of her superior. Beatification Grave site. The beatification process commenced under Pope Paul VI after the late nun was titled as a Servant of God and Archbishop Antoni Baraniak inaugurated the informative process on 24 March 1968 - the archbishop's successor Jerzy Stroba closed the process on 23 January 1979. The Congregation for the Causes of Saints later validated this process about a decade later on 10 June 1988 and received the official Positio dossier from the postulation in 1992. Theologians met and approved the cause on 16 March 2000 while the members of the C.C.S. followed suit on 17 October 2000. On 18 December 2000 she was named as Venerable after Pope John Paul II confirmed her life of heroic virtue. The miracle needed for her beatification was scrutinized in a diocesan process that received C.C.S. validation on 15 June 2001 and the approval of a board of medical experts on 11 April 2002. Theologians followed suit on 6 June 2002 and the C.C.S. also approved it on 25 June 2002. The pope issued his final stamp of approval on 5 July 2002 and beatified Szymkowiak on his visit to the capital of Krak√≥w on 18 August 2002.

The authority is based on the description by Achille Costa and Oronzio Costa, although earlier work grants this to Fabricius 1798., though the commonest species, M. abdominalis, bears the authority of Fabricius.  Description  Adults: Head and thorax are black, with some yellow parts including mouthparts. Legs and abdomen mainly yellow, wings suffused with brown. Eggs: Smooth, white and oblong measuring 1 mm by 4 mm. Larvae: Caterpillar-like, growing from 2‚Äì4 mm to 16‚Äì21 mm. Pupae: Shorter and fatter measuring 8 mm in length, and become increasingly melanized.  Taxonomy  Species often include only M. abdominalis but some authorities describe up to four species, including; * Monostegia abdominalis A. Costa 1859 (Fabricius 1798) \\\\- Tiny yellow sawfly * Monostegia analis Konow 1887 * Monostegia cingula Konow 1891 * Monostegia nigra Konow 1896  Distribution  Distribution is holarctic, from Europe to Asia Minor and the Caucasus in the south, through to Siberia. Though it was only introduced to North America from Europe in the 1950s, where it naturalised, its range continues to expand. In 1979 its North American distribution was from Quebec to New Jersey, and west to Ontario and Ohio but was detected as far west as Washington state in 2016 in the United States and in Canada from Alberta in the west to the Maritimes in the east.  Economic importance  Head of larva Sawflys are folivore phytophages (plant eating). Monostegia's economic importance lies in the destructive habits of its caterpillar-like larvae which feed on the leaves of plants of the family Primulaceae, principally Lysimachia (such as yellow loosestrife, (Lysimachia terrestris)), and Anagallis (pimpernel). Original reports in North America involved Lysimachia nummularia as the host plant, but L. terrestris was identified in the 1960s.  Life cycle  Two (bivoltine) to three (multivoltine) generations per year occur, depending on the length of the summer season, with some larvae over wintering, otherwise the larvae mature in July, emerging from the soil as adults in August. Larvae that winter in the soil pupate in the spring to emerge in June. Adults are thelyotokous, females being produced from unfertilised eggs, and males are rare. The emerging female alights the underside of leaves at the top of the host plant, and contain 30‚Äì70 eggs, which they deposit over the space of about a week, and live for about a further week. the female penetrates the leaf with her ovipositor, depositing the eggs into the cavity, usually two at a time, moving from the distal leaf towards the stem, forming an egg cluster of between 6 and 16 eggs. The eggs are laid on the leaves of the host plant, and the immature larvae ( first instar) remain with the clusters of eggs for a day before dispersing and feeding on the underside of the leaves. One larva can consume a whole plant, migrating to a new plant after total defoliation. The mature larva (sixth instar) stops feeding and drops to the soil where it burrows and pupates.

History The family originate in Wittislingen, with archaeological evidence of grave goods suggesting the presence of Alamannic nobility from at least the 7th century. They acquired substantial territory west of the Danube, between Gundelfingen and Donauw√∂rth, by the second half of the 8th century. The founder of the dynasty was Hucpald I (d. 910), whose son Dietpald I died in the Battle of Lechfeld in 955. Dietpald's son Richwin was given the inheritance of his father as comitatus (i.e. with the rank of comes \\"count\\") by Otto the Great. The Hupalding counts built Dillingen castle in the late 9th or early 10th century, and Dillingen had become their main seat by the late 10th century.Gerhard von Augsburg: Vita sancti Uodalrici: die √§lteste Lebensbeschreibung des heiligen Ulrich. Universit√§tsverlag C. Winter (Editiones Heidelbergenses; 24), Heidelberg 1993, Their title is recorded as comites de Dilinga in 1111. The castle was expanded and fortified in the 12th century, mentioned as castrum Dilingin in 1220. Hartmann I, son of Hupald IV (d. 1074) was born c. 1040 and in 1065 married Adelheid, daughter of the count of Winterthur. The male line of the counts of Winterthur had been extinct in 1053, and Hartmann I via his wife inherited the County of Kyburg. Hartmann I founded Neresheim Abbey in 1095, shortly before departing for the First Crusade. Hartmann I retired to Neresheim Abbey for his old age, and he died there in 1121. Hartmann's younger son Ulrich I became bishop of Constance (r. 1111-1127) while his elder brothers Hartmann II and Adalbert I expanded the territory held by the family. Hartmann II also retired to Neresheim Abbey and died in 1134, probably without a male heir. Adalbert I acquired further territory in the Thurgau by marriage, and participated in the feud between the Welfs and Staufer. Adalbert is named count of Kyburg in documents, suggesting that he administered the family's southern possessions while his brother was still alive, but after the death of Hartmann II, Adalbert unified the family territory until his own death in 1151. Adalbert is the ancestor of the two comital lines of Dillingen and Kyburg. Hartmann III of Dillingen acquired territory from the inheritance of the Counts of Lenzburg in 1173. He founded the cities of Diessenhofen (1178), Winterthur (1180) and possibly Frauenfeld. After the death of his brother Adalbert II in 1170 he again unified the family territories until his own death in 1080. After 1080, the counties of Dillingen and Kyburg remained separate. His son Adalbert III continues the Dillingen line and his son Ulrich the Kyburg line. Adalbert III participated in the Third Crusade, and he sided with Philip of Swabia in the feud against Wittelsbach. He is succeeded by his son Hartmann IV, who in 1246 sides with \\"anti-king\\" Henry Raspe. In reaction, Conrad IV invades Dillingen in 1246, 1247 and again in 1249 Adalbert IV, son of Hartmann IV, was the last count of Dillingen. He is mentioned as illustris nunc comes de Dilingen in 1255. He died without an heir in 1257, and the fief reverted to the empire, and was given to Louis II, Duke of Bavaria by Richard of Cornwall in 1261.

They are named for the Alemannic settlement at Vitudurum, but their rule predates the foundation of the city of Winterthur in 1180. The first count of Winterthur was Liutfried II (fl.970s), third son of Udalrich VI of Bregenz (d. 955). This Liutfried likely built the first Kyburg castle in the later 10th century. He was succeeded by his son Adalbert I (d. 8 September 1030). Liutfried's younger son Werner of Kyburg (d. 17 August 1030, not to be confused with his grandson Werner I of Winterthur) was a friend of Ernest II, Duke of Swabia, who after his failed against emperor Conrad II sought refuge in Kyburg castle. Conrad besieged and destroyed the castle and both Ernest and Werner managed to flee to Falkenstein castle in Schramberg, where they were killed by troops of Warmann, bishop of Constance. Adalbert's son Werner I (c. 990-1040) (de) was appointed landgrave in Hessengau (Maden) by Conrad II in 1027 before succeeding his father as count in 1030. Werner was bearer of the Reichsfahne (imperial flag) under Conrad II and Henry III and he died in the battle at Br≈Ødek against Bretislav I.

The memorial was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens with sculpture by Sir George Frampton and closely resembles Hove War Memorial in East Sussex, which was also a collaboration between Lutyens and Frampton. It was unveiled in 1921 and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Fordam's memorial is unusual among Lutyens' works in that it features a bronze statue of Saint George, a feature shared only with Hove War Memorial in East Sussex. As in many places, a war memorial committee was established in Fordham in June 1919 to decide on commemoration of the village's dead. The committee initially favoured a proposal for a memorial portico at the entrance to the village cemetery, which would contain tablets engraved with the names of the dead. This proposal was shelved when a Mrs Dunn-Gardner from Fordham Abbey donated a five-acre plot of land in a central area of the village for use as a park and a setting for a war memorial, and the committee commissioned Lutyens to design a monument to fit the space. While many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated from friends or former clients in the area, it does not appear that the architect had any prior connection to Fordham.Skelton, p. 83. History and design Close-up of the fibreglass replacement statue; the bronze original was stolen in 1991. Lutyens designed a Doric column in Portland stone surmounted by a bronze statue of Saint George, sculpted by Sir George Frampton. At the bottom of the column is a plinth of two square blocks and a base of two further square blocks, taking the memorial to a total height of . The upper section of the plinth contains the memorial's dedication: \\"OUR GLORIOUS DEAD\\" on the south side and the dates of the First World War in Roman numerals on the west and east. The names of the village's dead are inscribed on all four sections of the lower plinth, to which the names of the dead from the Second World War were added at a later date.Skelton, p. 168. The construction work was undertaken by Frank Johnson, a local builder and stonemason. It was unveiled by Mrs Dunn-Gardner on 7 August 1921. In June 1991 the memorial was severely damaged by thieves, who partially demolished the column and stole the bronze statue in what author Tim Skelton described as \\"the most wanton act of vandalism to a Lutyens war memorial\\". The thieves were never caught and the community raised ¬£4,750 for repair of the column and a replacement statue, made from fibreglass by artist Robert Donaldson based on photographs of the original.Skelton, p. 159. Lutyens adapted the design for a proposal for a war memorial in Shere in Surrey, but the memorial committee there opted for a different architect and design.Skelton, p. 148. Fordham War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 31 January 1984. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

Life Grekoff was born in Saratov, in the province of the Don, the son of a railway engineer. During the Russian Revolution he drifted with his family across Russia, according to the ebb and flow of combat. They stayed for a time in a family property near Sevastopol, but in 1920 took refuge in Turkey. In Constantinople and its surroundings, life became for exiles became increasingly difficult. From the age of ten, Elie had to work. He was unable to attend a school for Russian immigrants for more than a year, although he managed to spend a few months, at the end of his stay in Turkey, at the American School. In 1928, when he was fourteen, the family decided to settle in France. Grekoff, his father, and one of his brothers, at first became farmworkers in the south, before working in the \\"Hutchinson\\" factories in Chalette close to Montargis. After a year they moved to Paris, continuing to work in the \\"Hutchinson\\"-owned factory. Grekoff undertook a TSF night school course and joined his older brother in a small radio factory. In 1935, as a result of a chance encounter, Grekoff destiny changed. Ever since he had been a child, Grekoff had dreamed of being a painter, and in 1935 a friend recommended him to an architect who was willing to welcome him into his office. Grekoff felt architecture was not his calling, and soon abandoned it to enter the Fernand L√©ger Academy. Very quickly, L√©ger recognized his potential. In 1937 Grekoff executed his first wall mural. For the International Exhibition in Paris, he was in charge of decorating a large roof panel. With the outbreak of World War II, Grekoff was mobilized, captured in 1940, and spent six months in captivity in Laval. In then spent another six months as a nurse-paramedic in the Val de Grace. It was during his captivity that he met the owner of Editions de Cluny, who, immediately after their release, commissioned him to illustrate several luxury edition books, including \\"Les fleurs du mal\\" by Baudelaire (etchings); \\"The blind clairvoyant\\" by Father Bruckberger (etchings); and \\"Hell\\" by Patrice Tower Pine (lithographs). The result such a success that the publisher of Crezevault Adressat commissioned seventy-two lithographs from him for an edition of \\"Crime and Punishment\\", which took Grekoff two years to complete. His Russian heredity and hard work resulted in a work that was considered to be in profound harmony with that of Dostoevsky. In 1949 he illustrated Po√®mes. Les Stupra. Album dit Zutique (extraits) by Arthur Rimbaud, providing 17 homoerotic engravings for a luxury edition of just thirty copies, a few of which were hand-colored. In 1954 he illustrated Tir√©sias by Marcel Jouhandeau, for an edition of 120, providing 20 wood engravings, 15 of which were published in the book and 5 in a separate slipcase as refus√©es prints. Sold \\"under the counter\\", and condemned by a court in 1964, it is now considered a masterpiece of homoerotic publishing. In 1959, with the assistance of Peter Monteret, he painted frescos for the hall of a girls high school hall in Compi√®gne. After the war Grekoff became noted for his work in the tapestry: almost all Grekoff tapestries were woven in Aubusson workshops. Until 1962, Grekoff compositions consisted in large measure of human themes: somewhat melancholic young men, girls, and children, in arcadian settings. In 1962, Grekoff left Paris for the quiet of the Anjou countryside. People no longer appeared in works; replaced by nature ‚Äì trees, insects, birds, and skies.

History of Hearthstone competition =2014= The first Hearthstone tournament was held at BlizzCon on 2013-11-8, only a few months after the release of the game's closed beta and several months before the official release of the game on 2014-03-11. Blizzard selected eight prominent Hearthstone players to compete at what they titled the \\"Hearthstone Innkeeper's Invitational\\". The tournament was won by Artosis, who was subsequently crowned the \\"Grandmaster of the Hearth\\". After the official release of the game, more Hearthstone tournaments followed, including events at EGX Rezzed and DreamHack Bucharest. BlizzCon 2014 featured a Hearthstone tournament with a $250,000 USD prize pool, the largest up to that point, and players from the Americas, Europe, and Asia qualified for the event through winning regional tournaments. In June 2014, the organization of Assembly Summer 2014, a Finnish qualifying tournament for the International e-Sports Federation's (IeSF) World Championship, sparked controversy when it was announced that tournament would be open for men only. The cause was that the World Championship was also slated to have an all-male line-up, and its qualifying events were subject to the same rules. According to the IeSF, the rule was set in place in order to \\"secure traditional sports status\\" for esports. The forced gender division was abolished a few days after it was announced for Assembly Summer when the IeSF switched to an \\"open for all\\" format. June also saw a cheating scandal when Radu \\"Rdu\\" Dima won first prize and US$10,000 at DreamHack Summer. During Rdu's final match against AmazHS, he got a Battle.net message stating the content of AmazHS' hand. Though the information was no longer relevant in the game, Rdu was upset about the unsolicited help and tournament organizers called for a 20-minute break in which Rdu's \\"friend list\\" was deleted, though they decided the round was won fairly. Though AmazHS gave his support to Rdu afterward, he stated that DreamHack should have been better at organizing the tournament and implored Blizzard to implement game modes in which such forms of cheating are not possible. In Hearthstones first year, a total of 52 tournaments and series awarded US$1,000 or more to individual players. Over the year, over US$1,000,000 worth of prize money was awarded during 2014, large tournaments being the World Championships and the World Cyber Arena. James \\"Firebat\\" Kostesich was the most successful tournament player, winning a total of US$105,650.

Four players per region eventually qualified for the World Championship by improving their regional rankings in Europe, North and Latin America, China, and Asia-Pacific. This World Championship was the first to be held with the Conquest format with a ban. Swedish player Sebastian \\"Ostkaka\\" Engwall defeated Canadian player Dylan \\"Hotform\\" Mullins to earn US$100,000 and the title of World Champion. =2016= Hearthstone competition \\"Throne of Cards IV\\" in Vienna, Austria In November 2015, Blizzard announced a change in the Hearthstone season structure, where the game's esports calendar would be split into Summer, Fall, Winter, and Spring seasons, each running for three months. Players have to earn enough HCT points in order to qualify for major tournaments at the end of each season which are held in three of the game's regions. Companies like Kyoto esports, StriveWire, and Zotac host tournaments that give players points to qualify for the seasonal major tournaments. The winners of each tournament qualified automatically for the World Championship. Through this setup, 12 players qualify for the event, while Blizzard appoints four players from China in some other manner. The 2016 Hearthstone World Tour featured over US$1,900,000 in prize money. The third Hearthstone World Championship was held at BlizzCon 2016 on November 5 with the Conquest format and a prize pool of US$1,000,000, four times as much as in 2015. It was played in a Swiss tournament format and one class could be banned from use by one's opponent.

If a player wins with a deck, then the next match another deck must be played. If a player loses, then they can replay the deck.'Hearthstone' Dumps One-Hero Specialist Card Format In Esports Competitions July 30, 2019. In October 2019, Blizzard announced it would ban a player for one year from competing and forfeited all of his winnings earned during Season 2 because he spoke in support of the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests during a tournament interview, which violated the rule against promoting a political stance during a broadcast. A few days later, Blizzard revised its decision so it gave back the prize money and reduced the suspension to six months. The sixth Hearthstone World Championship winner was Chinese Xiaomeng \\"VKLiooon\\" Li that received $200,000; VKLiooon was also the first woman to win a Hearthstone world championship and to win a BlizzCon tournament. Streaming For many professional Hearthstone players, rather than tournament earnings, livestreaming is their main source of income. In 2014, Kinguin project coordinator Giovanni Varriale stated that Hearthstone was one of the most popular games on Twitch, with \\"thousands of people spend[ing] hours watching the best players in action.\\" Game design Hearthstone is a digital and online card game, comparable to traditional collectible card games such as Magic: The Gathering. =Expansions= The game features a large amount of inherent randomness as calculated through a random number generator (a property referred to as \\"RNG\\"). Some cards may have excessively random effects and may be able to completely sway a game through RNG. Various fans are worried about the future of the game's competitive scene due to unbalanced cards being introduced in new expansions. In an interview with Polygon, Hearthstone associate designer Dean Ayala stated that newly introduced cards can add to the strategy of the game, and that expanding Hearthstone is \\"all about finding the balance with what is ok and what isn't ok.\\" Ayala explained that a large part of adding new cards to the game is trying to view each card through the lens of each possible type of player and how the card may be used. Culture The practice of \\"win trading\\", where players forfeit games in order to help other players gain in ranking, can be used to reach Legend ranking with less effort. However, win trading is considered cheating, and Blizzard gives out permanent bans for people who indulge in the practice. In 2014, professional coaching services became popular, where high-level players discuss strategies with their clients and give tips for improvement. Nathan 'ThatsAdmirable' Zamora stated that the work is his main source of income, and that the service is useful for players that have plateaued and are unsure on how to change their play style. In August 2014, competitive Hearthstone player Ryan \\"Realz\\" Masterson was hired by Blizzard in order to help with the balancing of the game.  Controversy  During a GrandMasters Season 2 match on October 6, 2019, player Chung \\"Blitzchung\\" Ng Wai made statements in support of the ongoing protests in Hong Kong. During a post-match interview on the official Taiwanese broadcast, Blitzchung wore ski goggles and a respirator mask similarly to the protesters, and used the popular pro-democracy slogan \\"Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our time\\". Blizzard considered the gesture to be a violation of rules forbidding players from engaging in conduct that \\"brings [the player] into public disrepute, offends a portion or group of the public or otherwise damages\\" the reputation of the company. As a result, Blizzard removed Blitzchung from the tournament, rescinded his Season 2 prize winnings, and banned him from Hearthstone competitions for one year. Blizzard also terminated its contract with the two casters involved in the broadcast. Blizzard stated that while it \\"[stands] by one's right to express individual thoughts and opinions\\", players were still subject to their official rules and regulations during competition. The removal of Blitzchung led to criticism of Blizzard and calls for a boycott of the company. As coverage of the protests have been subject to censorship in mainland China, critics considered the decision to be an act of self-censorship intended to appease Chinese investors and stakeholders. Chinese conglomerate Tencent owns a minority stake in Activision Blizzard. Comparisons were also drawn with a recent controversy involving Daryl Morey, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team, over a Twitter posting that similarly pledged support for the protests. The developers of the similar game Gods Unchained invited Blitzchung to its own tournament, offering to also repay the winnings that Blizzard had rescinded.

The McKiernan lands of Tullyhunco were on the border between the O‚ÄôRourke and O‚ÄôReilly lands and both of those clans were attempting to claim overlordship of the McKiernans.

Biwanka or Piwonka are German spellings of Czech Pivo≈àka, now the name of a minor river rising near Pivo≈à, a tributary of ƒåern√Ω potok, in turn a tributary of Radbuza. Ign√°c Cornova, Briefe an einen kleinen Liebhaber der Vaterl√§ndischen Geschichte: Geschichte B√∂hmens unter dem Pr≈æemislischen Herrscherstamm (1796), p. 68.) was a battle fought between Henry III, King of the Romans, and B≈ôetislav I, Duke of Bohemia, on 22/23 August 1040. The battle took place in the Upper Palatine Forest in what is now the Doma≈ælice District of Plze≈à Region, Czech Republic.the site associated with the battle in Czech tradition, Br≈Ødek in V≈°eruby (Doma≈ælice District) municipality, at V≈°erubsk√Ω pr≈Øsmyk (Neumarker Pass), is some 20 km to the east-southeast of Stockau (Pivo≈à, Mnichov municipality) given as the site in 18th-century German tradition. As this was not a single field battle but a series of clashes between separate contingents of the two armies taking place over the span of two days, the two locations are not mutually exclusive. B≈ôetislav was leading a campaign against Poland in 1039, and after he conquered Gniezno, he removed the relics of Adalbert of Prague to Prague, intended as a move to establish a separate archbishopric there, in order to secede from the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Mainz. Archbishop Bardo complained about this to Henry, who was already unhappy with B≈ôetislav's war against Poland, as both Bohemia and Poland were nominally vassals of the empire. B≈ôetislav agreed to send his son Spytihnƒõv as a hostage to the court of the king, however because he refused the payment of a tribute requested by Henry, the king moved against Bohemia with two armies. B≈ôetislav had won a respite by offering his son as hostage, which he used to gain the support of Peter, King of Hungary, who sent 3,000 support troops. B≈ôetislav also fortified the passes of the Bohemian Forest and intended to ambush Henry, who was anticipating the attack and moved in several detachments. When Henry located the intended ambush, he sent a vanguard of 1,000 men into a side valley of the Chamb in order to enclose the enemy. This vanguard, led by Werner I of Maden, count of Winterthur, the bearer of the imperial banner, was caught up in the prepared sconces and almost completely destroyed. Henry's second wing, led by margrave Otto of Schweinfurt, was forced to retreat with heavy losses the following day. Henry was forced to retreat, and sent Gunther of Bohemia with orders to Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen, who was leading a Saxon force invading Bohemia from the north, to do likewise. Eckard negotiated a retreat some two weeks after. Henry requested a truce, but was answered with the demand for unconditional surrender, so the king planned a second campaign for the following year. This turned out to be more successful, Henry succeeded in meeting with the Saxon forces before Prague on 8 September and B≈ôetislav was forced to surrender on 29 September 1041. An inscription found in the church at Valt√≠≈ôov, Nov√Ω Kramol√≠n mentions Henry III as founder of Stockau Abbey in 1041. A legend of the 18th century connects the name of Stockau to a tree stump (Stock) on which the king supposedly rested during the battle. The altar of the abbey's church was supposed to correspond to the location of this tree stump. The chapel of St. Wenceslas in Br≈Ødek, V≈°eruby municipality is said to have been built by B≈ôetislav in 1047 to commemorate the battle.Josef Franti≈°ek, Jaroslav Schaller, Topographie des K√∂nigreichs B√∂hmen vol. 12 (1789), p. 80.

A school master in holy orders, he was a minor English poet and imitator of Alexander Pope. Life The old front of Tonbridge School where Cawthorn taught James Cawthorn was the son of a Sheffield upholsterer and cabinet-maker. He was first educated at Sheffield Grammar School, and then in 1735 was sent to school at Kirkby Lonsdale, where he began writing poetry. No copy remains of the first of his poems to be published, ‚ÄúThe Perjured Lover or tragical adventures of Alexis and Boroina, in heroic verse, from the story of Inkle and Yarico‚Äù (Sheffield 1736). That year too he was employed as a teaching assistant in Rotherham. Although he matriculated at Clare College, Cambridge, in 1738, he does not seem to have stayed there and is next heard of as an assistant to Martin Clare, head of an academy at 8 Soho Square,British History online whose daughter Mary he married. In 1743 Cawthorn was made head master of Tonbridge School, by which time he had taken holy orders and sometime later was styling himself M.A. The lasting memorial of his incumbency there was the library that he persuaded the Governors to build at the south end of the school in 1756, which survives today as the Headmaster's house and the Skinners' Library. A few poems and sermons of his now began to be published; principally, however, his poems were declaimed on the annual visitation days from the Worshipful Company of Skinners, who were the school‚Äôs patrons. The poet Robert Southey facetiously remarked in his brief notes on Cawthorn that ‚ÄúHe was fond of riding other horses besides that which he borrowed of the Muses,‚ÄùSpecimens of the Later English Poets, London, 1807, Vol.2, p.284 and it was remembered of him that, as an admirer of concerts and operas, he had been known to ride to London in order to be present at a musical performance, returning in time for the start of school at seven next morning.Alexander Chalmers, ‚ÄúLife of Cawthorn‚Äù, The Works of the English Poets (1810), p.230 Eventually he died after being thrown from his horse in April, 1761. His grave in Tonbridge church is marked by a Latin epitaph on a marble tablet. Poetry It was not until 1771 that Cawthorn‚Äôs poems were collected and printed by subscription. They were for the most part ethical epistles and moral poems in the manner of Alexander Pope. Sometimes, it was noted in Alexander Chalmers' General Biographical Dictionary, \\"his imitations are so close as to appear the effect rather of memory than of judgment\\".Online text. Echoes of Pope‚Äôs \\"Eloisa to Abelard\\" might be expected in Cawthorn‚Äôs reply, \\"Abelard to Eloisa\\" (1747). However, his other attempt at an Ovidian heroic epistle, \\"Lady Jane Grey to Lord Guildford Dudley\\" (1753), suggests the influence of his real model in its very first line: \\"From these dark cells in sable pomp arrayed\\", which echoes that of Pope‚Äôs epistle, \\"In these deep solitudes and awful cells\\". Yet another echo from the same source occurs in Cawthorn‚Äôs \\"On Taste\\" (1756), where the line \\"In the pure sunshine of the soul divine\\" seems a half-memory of Pope‚Äôs \\"The eternal sunshine of the spotless mind\\". Though his poem \\"On Taste\\" takes the fourth of Pope‚Äôs \\"Moral Essays\\" as its starting point, the examples he gives make original fun of the contemporary fad for chinoiserie: ::Of late, ‚Äòtis true, quite sick of Rome and Greece, ::We fetch our models from the wise Chinese‚Ä¶ ::Form‚Äôd on his plans, our farms and seats begin ::To match the boasted villas of Pekin, ::On every hill a spire-crown‚Äôd temple swells, ::Hung round with serpents and a fringe of bells‚Ä¶ ::In Tartar huts our cows and horses lie, ::Our hogs are fatten‚Äôd in an Indian stye‚Ä¶ ::While o‚Äôer our cabinets Confucius nods ::‚ÄòMidst porcelain elephants and China gods. The independent observation there has been quoted by later critics as acute evidence of the change in fashion since the Classicism of Pope‚Äôs day.Patricia Laurence, Lily Briscoe's Chinese Eyes, University of South Carolina 2013, pp.314-15; The Vision of China in the English Literature of the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, ed. Adrian Hsia Chinese University Press 1998, p.284 Another critic has remarked on the original way Cawthorn‚Äôs verse essays mediate to a later middle class audience the \\"aristocratic ethics\\" originally propounded by the Earl of Shaftesbury.H.N. Fairchild, Religious Trends in English Poetry Volume 2, p.298 Though Cawthorn‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbelard and Eloisa‚Äù followed in the train of the earlier imitations of Pope that were written immediately on its publication, there had been none since 1730. His poem of 1747 not only heads a new wave of them but seems to have been the most continuously reprinted. Before his posthumous 1771 collection, it had reappeared in The Poetical Calendar (1763) and George Pearch‚Äôs Collection of Poems in Two Volumes (1768).The New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature, Volume 2, column 646 By 1781 it had joined Pope‚Äôs original in John Hughes‚Äô The Letters of Abelard and Heloise: with a particular account of their lives, amours, and misfortune,p. 182 a work that, with later additions, continued in print not only in Britain but in Europe and the United States well into the 19th century. Besides subsequent reprints of Cawthorn‚Äôs collected poems in one format or another, there was one other popular source for the poem, or its opening lines at least. These had been set as \\"Abelard: a sacred glee\\" by John Wall Callcott and the words alone appeared in The poetry of various glees, songs, &c; (London, 1798),p.87 of which there were many later reproductions. As late as 1843, both words and music were included in The British Minstrel.p.124 Despite the caviling of critics that the poem fell short of its original model, the conclusion to be drawn from its persistence for a century after its original appearance is of a popularity outlasting his other works.

Life Elias Tozer was born on 21 November 1825 in Exeter. For many years he was a reporter for the Western Times, an Exeter paper. Later he bought the newspaper Chambers' Exeter Journal. His paper was merged into the Devon Weekly Times, and Tozer became joint owner of this newspaper. Elias Tozer died on 13 December 1873. Work Tozer wrote many articles on Devonshire country life, and delighted in reproducing dialect. For example, he wrote of a visit to the village of Drewsteignton when the bells were being rung, They be often ringing, sir,' observed an old man to me; and he continued: 'The ringers be vurry fond of the bells, and sometimes they ring vor vurry little. T'other day Varmer Dadd killed a peg, and gied the natlins to the poor of the parish. Darned if the ringers didden ring vor a whole hour, as they zed, to cillebrate the hayvent. Tozer could write in a more serious vein. Thus he describes a ritual that until recently had been observed in the village of Buckland-in-the-Moor on Midsummer Day in which the youth of the village would sacrifice a sheep on the block of granite and sprinkle themselves with the blood. He could not find what the significance of the ritual was,but says it was thought to have pre-Christian Celtic origins. Tozer's Devonshire & Other Original Poems, originally published in 1873 under the nom-de-plume of \\"Tickler\\", was very popular. Most of the poems had been published in the Devon Weekly Times or the Evening Express.

He was educated at St Egbert's College, Chingford, and Chingford County High School to Higher School Certificate level, and was unusual in that his subsequent scientific career was achieved despite his never having obtained a University degree. He joined the London Natural History Society at the age of 13 and served his National Service as a radiographer and medical photographer in the Royal Army Medical Corps in both the United Kingdom and Jamaica, where he joined the Natural History Society of Jamaica. On leaving the army he applied to the British Museum (Natural History) for a post as an Assistant in the Department of Zoology, starting on 1 June 1950 as an assistant in the Fish Section. He spent his whole career in the Natural History Museum, retiring in 1989. His two main specialisms were the taxonomy of European fish and studies of historical collections of taxonomic importance. He produced over a hundred different scientific publications and his most important work was The fishes of the British Isles and north-west Europe which was published in 1969 and became the standard, modern British ichthyology text. Other important publications included Key to the Fishes of Northern Europe in 1978, Fishes of the World in 1975 and The World Encyclopedia of Fishes in 1985. He was also a central figure in the monitoring of the clean up of the River Thames and the return of life to the river and he produced The Tidal Thames; The History of a River and its Fishes in 1979 to document this. Wyn Wheeler was a founding member of the Fisheries Society of the British Isles (FSBI). As well as scientific publications Wheeler wrote columns in the more popular angling press giving biological information to anglers. He also adjudicated many rod caught records and in 1997 he announced that the many of the largest specimens of Crucian carp Carassius carassius were invalid as they referred to wild goldfish Carassius auratus. He also developed expertise in the identification of fish bone from archaeological sites, co-authoring a manual in 1989 on the identification of fish remains in archaeological sites. He was an editor of, and helped to develop, the Journal of the Society for the Bibliography of Natural History (now called Archives of Natural History). He served as honorary editor from 1967 to 1974, and from 1978 to 1986, and was again formally elected as honorary editor in 1989 (he was editor pro tem in 1988-1989). Wheeler finally retired in 1999 after the publication of volume 26 (part 1). He retired from the Natural History Museum in 1989. After retirement he worked at Epping Forest Conservation Centre and continued his association with the Museum in his capacity as an official Scientific Associate. He sometimes published under the pen name Allan Cooper, mostly when publishing non-technical, popular articles and books. In 1992 he published A list of the common and scientific names of fishes of the British Isles, this was being revised when he contracted Alzheimer's disease and was completed by Nigel Merrett (his successor at the Museum) and Declan Quigley, being published in 2004. The Alwyne Wheeler Bursary was established in 1999, on the occasion of Alwyne Wheeler's retirement as the Society for the History of Natural History's honorary editor. The bursary was established to facilitate original contributions to the study of the history of natural history by young scholars (under the age of 30). The name of the African goby genus Wheelerigobius honours Wheeler's contribution to ichthyology. Following his passing in June 2005, and in recognition of this role as a founding member of the FSBI as well as his post-retirement research activity, the FSBI established the Wyn Wheeler Research Grant in December 2005 to provide retired members of the FSBI with financial support for continued activity in fish biology.

It was produced by Signal.MD, written and directed by Kenji Kamiyama, and stars Mitsuki Takahata. It was released in Japan by Warner Bros. Pictures Japan on March 18, 2017. An English dubbed version was released in the United Kingdom on August 16, 2017, and in the United States a month later. Plot Napping Princess takes place in two concurrent settings: a near-future Japan, and Heartland, a fantastical realm. The main character, Kokone Morikawa, has strange dreams of Heartland while taking naps. In these dreams, Heartland is a society entirely revolving around cars; the King's castle is a car factory, and his subjects all come to it to make a constant stream of new cars. His daughter, Ancien (who appears as a younger Kokone), has a \\"magic tablet\\" computer she uses to give life to various machines: notably, a blue toy bear named Joy, and a motorcycle named Heart. The king disapproves of this, however, and orders Ancien confined to her tower. Additionally, the society of Heartland is under threat from a gigantic monster of molten metal called the Colossus. The king builds giant robots to face the Colossus. Ancien, spying a motorcycle-driving subject of the king's named Peach, decides to ally with him and seek to defeat the Colossus together with him, while the king's chief adviser Bewan plots against the king and Ancien alike. In normal Japan, Kokone is finishing up her school term, considering where to go to college, and reconnecting with old friend Morio who has returned from Tokyo from his first year in college. Kokone lives with her single father Momotar≈ç; her mother perished in an accident while Kokone was still young, and Kokone complains that her father never told her much about her mother. Momotar≈ç is an eccentric car mechanic and has a jacket similar to Peach's, a blue bear doll, a motorcycle, and a cracked tablet, all similar to the ones seen in Kokone's dreams. The situation takes a turn for the worse when Momotar≈ç is unceremoniously arrested three days prior to the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and accused of stealing the car company Shijima Motors' secrets. A suited figure who looks identical to the Heartland king's evil adviser visits the Morikawa home, and is overheard to be searching for both the tablet and Kokone. Via text message from jail, Momotar≈ç warns his daughter not to trust the adviser, who is named Watanabe. The message includes a picture of a younger Momotar≈ç, his wife, and Watanabe. With Morio's help, Kokone evades Watanabe and his men and recovers the stolen tablet and bear doll, driving away in the family's motorcycle. They also discover a business card for Isshin Shijima, the chairman of Shijima Motors, and consider visiting him for help after Kokone is told that her mother, Ikumi, was the daughter of the Chairman. The two take a nap in the motorcycle, visit Heartland where they dream of the motorcycle soaring through the sky, and are surprised to find on waking up that the motorcycle has driven itself to Osaka overnight before running out of gas. Kokone's attempts to contact her father via the tablet seemingly fail, but surprisingly enough, the \\"magic\\" seems to work in the real world when a request to the tablet's e-Heart chat for train tickets results in an attendant giving them paid-for Shinkansen tickets to Tokyo. There, Kokone seeks an audience with the Chairman, while Morio learns that mechanics from Shijima Motors were the ones who saw Kokone's message and had bought the tickets for the pair. The mechanics explain that after the chairman's daughter had a falling out with her father and eloped with Momotar≈ç, they used this chat to keep in contact with Momotar≈ç, who had been continuing his wife's self-driving car programming and research. Ikumi had run a project researching self-driving car technology years ago, but Ikumi's father, as chairman, refused her proposal at the time. Kokone has a final dream of Ancien and Peach's adventures, but unlike earlier dreams, Kokone appears as a separate bystander rather than as Ancien. Ancien seeks to empower one of the giant robots with her magic tablet over the objections of the captain. While the empowered robot engages with the Colossus, the captain turns off the engines. Ancien frantically attempts to reignite the engines, but falls off the robot. Peach keeps her in his grip, but she loses her grasp. Appearing now as Ikumi (rather than a young Kokone), she swears to help out Peach one last time, then falls to her death and cracks the tablet's glass. Kokone understands that the bedtime stories she was told as a young girl of \\"Ancien and the Magic Tablet\\" by her father that she has been dreaming of were actually stories of her mother. Now, Shijima Motors has changed course and wants to use the once ignored technology to impress the world during the Olympics with self-driving cars, hence Watanabe's frantic hunt for the tablet. Kokone, prominently carrying Ikumi's old bear doll Joy, finds Chairman Shijima, who talks of his regrets. The action shifts to Heartland, where Bewan/Watanabe detains Kokone. He describes his plan to overthrow the King via letting the King's giant robots fail, and then to prominently save the kingdom with his own giant robot. The King orders Watanabe arrested, while Peach enters the remaining robot to do battle with the Colossus, which Kokone empowers with the tablet. Watanabe manages to emit a \\"curse\\" from his cell phone to sabotage the robot, and the kingdom is briefly engulfed in flames. Regardless, Peach and Kokone are able to prevail over the Colossus, albeit via flying into space and crashing back to Heartland. In the real world, Kokone and her father Momotar≈ç are now stuck in the rafters of the building while Watanabe is carried off, and Momotar≈ç is holding onto Kokone just as Peach once had for Ancien. The people beneath, and the self-driving motorcycle Heart, in seeming fulfillment of Ikumi's claim to be there for the family one more time when it is most needed, are able to drag a giant balloon into place; as the family falls, they hit every banner to slow their descent, and survive the fall thanks to the balloon. A safe Kokone, seeing the company's motto on the banners explains that her name must have been based on the company's motto, a combination of \\"heart\\" (kokoro) and \\"wing\\" (hane). During the credits, scenes of Momotar≈ç and Ikumi's courtship, and the original tests of her software, are shown. Cast { class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" style=\\"text-align:center;\\" - ! Character !

Bred and owned by Hamdan Al Maktoum he was trained throughout his racing career in England by John Dunlop. As a two-year- old in 1998 Mujahid won three of his four races and was rated the best of his generation in Europe after recording an upset win in the Dewhurst Stakes. He never won another race although he did finish third in the 2000 Guineas in 1999. After his retirement from racing he became a successful breeding stallion. Background Mujahid is a bay horse with a white blaze and three white socks bred in Kentucky by his owner, Hamdan Al Maktoum's Shadwell Farm. The colt was sent to race in Europe and was trained throughout his racing career by John Dunlop at Arundel in West Sussex. He was ridden i all of his races by Richard Hills. His sire Danzig, who ran only three times before his career was ended by injury, was a highly successful stallion who sired the winners of more than fifty Grade I/Group One races. His offspring include the champions Chief's Crown, Dayjur and Lure as well as the important stallion Danehill. Mujahid was the first foal of his dam Elrafa Ah, successful racemare who won the Dragon Stakes in 1993 and the Bentinck Stakes in 1994. She was a descendant of the American broodmare Sunday Evening who was the female-line ancestor of several major winners including Henrythenavigator, Indian Skimmer, Saffron Walden (Irish 2,000 Guineas) and Dark Mirage. Racing career =1998: two-year-old season= Mujahid began his racing career in a six furlong novice race (for horses with no more than one previous win) at Newmarket Racecourse on 8 July and started the 6/1 second favourite behind the odds-on favourite Belasco. After starting slowly, Mujahid began to make progress in the last quarter mile, took the lead from Compatriot inside the final furlong and held off a late challenge from Belasco to win by a head. Two weeks later at Salisbury Racecourse Mujahid started 2/5 favourite for the Trinity Stakes against two opponents. After tracking the leader Boomerang Blade, Mujahid took the lead at half way and drew away to win \\"very easily\\" by six lengths from Sunny Fact. The colt was then stepped up in class for the Group Two Gimcrack Stakes at York Racecourse on 19 August and was made the 13/8 favourite ahead of Bertolini (winner of the July Stakes) and Rosselli (Norfolk Stakes). After tracking the leaders, Mujahid struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight and finished fifth of the eight runners behind Josr Algarhoud, Sailing Shoes, Thunder Dragon and Bertolini. John Dunlop later said that thecolt had been unsuited by the firm ground. Despite his defeat at York, Mujahid was moved up in class and distance to contest Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-olds, the Group One Dewhurst Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 17 October. The joint-favourites were Stravinsky and Enrique (Somerville Tattersall Stakes) whilst Mujahid started a 25/1 outsider. The other four runners were Lujain, Auction House (Champagne Stakes), Raise A Grand (Solario Stakes) and the French challenger Indian Danehill. Mujahid tracked the leader Auction House but appeared outpaced when Enrique went to the front two furlongs out. He rallied when switched to the right by Richard Hills, took the lead inside the final furlong and won by two lengths and a neck from Auction House and Stravinsky. When interviewed after the race John Dunlop told journalists \\"You pundits always get it wrong\\" but admitted that he did not think that Mujahid would be \\"good enough against these cracks\\". =1999: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old Mujahid started odds-on favourite for the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over one mile at Newmarket on 15 April. He ran unaccountably badly and finished fifth of the seven runners behind Compton Admiral. Mujahid's groom Steve Gill later commented \\"We were gobsmacked after Newmarket. We couldn't find anything wrong with him and everyone was gutted. The guv'nor said that, after 33 years of training, he had never been so surprised by a result\\". Despite his poor performance Mujahid contested the 2000 Guineas on 1 May and started the 9/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Orpen, Enrique, Auction House and Commander Collins. As the Rowley Mile course was being redeveloped the race was run on the July, or Summer course. After tracking the leaders in the early stages he moved up to dispute the lead two furlongs out and kept on at the same pace to finish third behind Island Sands and Enrique. Two weeks later the colt was sent to France for the Poule d'Essai des Poulains over 1600 metres at Longchamp Racecourse and finished fifth behind Sendawar. In the St James's Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot in June the colt finished seventh behind Sendawar, who won by one and a quarter lengths from Aljabr. After a break of over four months, Mujahid returned in the Group Two Challenge Stakes over seven furlongs at Newmarket on 16 October and finished fourth behind Susu, Lend A Hand and Josr Algharoud. On his final appearance of the season Mujahid contested the James Seymour Stakes over ten furlongs at Newmarket and finished second by a length to Little Rock. =2000: four-year-old season= Mujahid remained in training as a four-year-old, beginning his third season in the Earl of Sefton Stakes over nine furlongs at Newmarket on 19 April. He finished third of the eleven runners behind Indian Lodge and Fairy Godmother. Nine days later Mujahid was brought back in distance for the Sandown Mile and finished fifth behind Indian Lodge. Assessment In the official International Classification on European two- year-old Mujahid was rated the best juvenile of 1998, one pound ahead of Lujain and four pounds ahead of the Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt Aljabr. Stud record Mujahid stood as a breeding stallion at the Beech House stud in England and was also \\"shuttled\\" to tand at the Widden Stud in Australia. He was later exported to Italy. The best of his offspring have included Danleigh (Manikato Stakes, George Ryder Stakes, All Aged Stakes, Chipping Norton Stakes), Balius (Jebel Hatta), Tashelka (Prix de la Nonette), Cheyenne Star (Ridgewood Pearl Stakes), Khyber Kim (Aintree Hurdle), Mind Your Head (Rubiton Stakes), Baddam (Queen Alexandra Stakes), Cleo Fan (Premio Presidente della Repubblica) and Starlarks (San Clemente Handicap). Pedigree * Mujahid was inbred 2 √ó 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the second and the fourth generations of his pedigree.

Built in 1864 for a Congregationalist church, it has since served as a community clubhouse and town-owned meeting hall, and is a fine local example of vernacular Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Ripton Community House stands at the center of the rural village center of Ripton, on the north side of Vermont Route 125 among other civic buildings. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and foundation of stone and concrete. Paneled pilasters rise at the building corners to support a full entablature, with a fully pedimented gable above the front facade. A two-stage square tower, topped by a flared roof, rises above the roof ridge. The upper stage houses the belfry, with louvered openings and narrow corner pilasters. The main facade has a central recess in which the main entrance is found. The recess is flanked by paneled pilasters and has two fluted columns. The interior, originally a single story with gallery, was converted into two stories in the 1920s by extending the gallery level. with The structure was built in 1864 for the local Congregationalist church, on land donated by Silvester Fisher. It remained in their hands until 1920, when it was sold to a Methodist church group. In 1928 the building was deeded to the Ripton Community Club, which adapted the building for use as a community meeting hall, hosting social events, dances, and other community events. In 1968 the club folded, and the town took over the building, which continues to serve the community not just for social events, but town meetings as well.

The app was developed through a partnership with entrepreneur Andrey Andreev. Following a soft launch in 2015, the app was officially launched in July 2016.  History  Founders Stina Sanders (left) and Valerie Stark (right) Founders Stina Sanders and Valerie Stark met after Stark moved from Moscow to London and was using Instagram geolocation data to try and meet people that hung out where she did. They decided to create an app inspired by how they met. Sanders and Stark took the idea to Andrey Andreev, the tech entrepreneur that backed Bumble, a feminist dating app, and founded dating app Badoo. The app took six months to build and had a soft launch in 2015. The app officially launched in July 2016 and was available globally the following October. The app was available for iOS, Android and Windows Phone at its release. An updated version was released June 2017. By September 2017, over 45 million locations had been logged on the app. A survey of 1,500 people conducted by Huggle in 2016 showed that dating apps that match people solely on appearance have a negative impact on people's self-esteem. 62 percent of those surveyed reported that dating apps make them feel self-conscious or depressed about their appearance and over 80 percent of the women surveyed admitted to editing photographs they have uploaded. In February 2018, Huggle turned off its dating mode for 24 hours in an attempt to combat the pressure to find a date for Valentine's Day. In March 2018, it was announced that Badoo had acquired Huggle as a subsidiary.  Operation  The app was originally designed as a way to make friends by connecting with people who share mutual interests, though a dating element was added in response to users looking for romantic matches. To verify a profile, users must take multiple selfies which are then approved by a team of 5,000 moderators. The actual profile is generated with information from other social media sites including Facebook, Foursquare and Instagram. The user chooses whether they are looking for a date or a friend as well as ideal age range and how many places their matches must have in contact before they can contact the user. When two users check in to the same place, they can view each other's profiles. The app automatically checks a user in at locations they visit and adds the location to their list of places. Users can then match with other people who visit that location. Huggle includes a \\"visitors\\" feature that allows users to see people who view their profile. = Safety = The first safety feature users encounter on Huggle is a one-minute photo verification through which Huggle asks users to take selfies by copying different gestures on the screen which are first compared to uploaded pictures using 160 points on the face then verified and approved by the moderators to filter fake profiles. Users can also be verified by their phone number, Gmail account, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn. Huggle uses hyperlocal technology to avoid fake check-ins. To check-in at a certain location, users have to be physically present at the place. A user's list of favourite places is never shared. A person's location is only visible when both users go to the same place. Users can decide how many places they want to have in common with other users to enable them to message.

Description and history The Larkinn Covered Bridge stands a short way north of the village center of North Tunbridge, on Larkin Road a short way east of its junction with Vermont Route 110. It is a single-span multiple kingpost truss structure, long and wide, with a roadway (one lane). It rests on abutments of stone and concrete, and is covered by a metal roof. Its side walls are made of vertical board siding and have no openings. The portal ends and the interiors of the portals are also finished in vertical board siding. Although the trusses are set to form a rectangle, the portals are slightly skewed, giving the bridge a parallelogram shape on the outside. with The bridge was built in 1902, and is one of only two documented early 20th-century bridges in the state; the other is the Kingsbury Covered Bridge in nearby Randolph, built in 1904. The bridge is one of five in Tunbridge, which, when combined with one in Chelsea, form a remarkably dense concentration of covered bridges across a single waterway in the state.

Playing career Gurr began his career at Arsenal as a young player, initially as a forward player,http://www.fansnetwork.co.uk/football/southampton/news/17407/saints- legends-you-have-never-heard-of-part-10 in 1962 before moving to join QPR's academy in 1963. While at QPR, Gurr had trials at other league clubs including Leicester City and Northampton Town. After leaving QPR he joined Guilford City in late 1963. While playing for Guilford he was spotted by Southampton and handed a trial in January 1964. This trial proved successful and he joined Southampton as a pro later that year. However it was to be another three years before Gurr made his debut for Southampton against Leicester City at The Dell on 14 January 1967 in a 4‚Äì4 draw. In this game the then 20-year-old Gurr saved a penalty. His performance in this game despite conceding four times was good with manager Ted Bates promising the young 'keeper that he would keep his place. However an injury meant he missed out and on his return in a reserves friendly against local rivals Portsmouth he again performed well, but not well enough to stop manager Bates signing Eric Martin from Dunfermline Athletic. It would be 20 months before Gurr got a chance in the First Division again. Gurr's performances over the 1968‚Äì69 season and at the beginning of the 1969‚Äì70 season were significant enough for some suggestions that he should receive a call-up to the England side; however injury would again provide a cruel blow with a shoulder injury effectively ending his Southampton career and international hopes. Gurr made 49 appearances in all competitions for Southampton, with 42 of those in the league. After Southampton, Gurr was persuaded to move to Fourth Division Aldershot Town, then managed by former Southampton teammate Jimmy Melia. He played 55 league games in the Fourth Division under Melia before ending his football career in 1972. After football Gurr had always been an accomplished musician having played the guitar since the age of 8 and while at Southampton had assembled a band called 'The Sunsets' with teammates Mick Judd and Dave Paton.

She has been a member of the National Academy of Sciences since 2006 and is the laureate for the 2017 Garvan‚ÄìOlin Medal. In 2016 she co-chaired the National Academy of Science report \\"The Future of Atmospheric Chemistry Research\\" Finlayson-Pitts investigates the chemistry of the upper and lower atmosphere and ways in which chemical reactions in the atmosphere are involved in air pollution and climate change. She and her team work to develop a molecular-level understanding of gaseous reactions of particles in different layers of the atmosphere, and at the interfaces between layers. They also study the interface between air and water. She emphasizes the \\"urgency for addressing climate change at all levels of government in the U.S. and globally\\".  Education  Finlayson-Pitts received a Bachelor of Science from Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario, in 1970. She earned her Masters and PhD in chemistry from the University of California, Riverside in 1971 and 1973, respectively. After completing a postdoctoral fellowship at UC Riverside, she worked as a professor of chemistry at California State University, Fullerton from 1974-1994. In 1994, she joined the chemistry department of the University of California, Irvine.  Research  Finlayson-Pitts' research focuses on developing a molecular- level understanding of the fundamental kinetics, mechanisms, and photochemistry of gaseous reactions of particles. She is particularly interested in how reactions occur in different layers of the atmosphere, and at the interfaces of different layers. In addition to her work on the troposphere and stratosphere, she studies interactions at the interface between air and water, where gases meet liquids. Reactions that occur at the surface between layers may differ from the reactions that occur within each layer. In the atmosphere, emitted gases and particles may react further to form new chemical species. Some compounds may not react within the troposphere, but will break down and participate in further transformations in the higher stratosphere. The inorganic chemistry of oxides of nitrogen and sulfur in the gas phase are better understood than the interactions of nitrogen and sulfur oxides with organic compounds. Finlayson-Pitts and her colleagues have done important work on understanding the chemistry of the troposphere, in particular, the conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrogen dioxide (NO2) in air and the subsequent formation of ozone, nitric acid, and organic nitrates. Finlayson-Pitts served as the lead author of a 2009 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that found that burning fossil fuels releases nitrogen oxides, which interact with gaseous hydrogen chloride to form smog-forming compounds. The study also found water vapor enhances the reaction. Finlayson-Pitts and her team examined reactions between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and dinitrogen pentoxide(N2O5), two common compounds created from fossil fuel combustion prevalent in the atmosphere, and gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl), which has reached concentrations of a few parts per billion in polluted air. The authors of the study proposed N2O5 exists as an asymmetric dimer, NO2+NO3‚àí. They also hypothesized water molecules promote the ionization of N2O5 to NO2+NO3‚àí.When NO2 reacts with HCl (in the form of NO2+NO3‚àí), it creates ClO and HNO3, and when N2O5 reacts with HCl, it forms ClNO2 and HNO3. The team said the creation of the chlorine nitrogen compounds could have negative implications for the reliability and lifetime of electronics that are susceptible to corrosion when the reaction takes place in doors. Light absorption crosses into section in near ultraviolet and overlaps strongly not only with solar radiation but also with that from fluorescent lights, causing smog. The chlorine-containing molecules also react with nitrogen monoxide (NO) to produce ozone. In a 2010 paper, Finlayson-Pitts detailed the role of halogens in reactions of the lower atmosphere. She found that chlorine ions in the air help ozone formation, while bromine ions aide ozone destruction. Both ions are common in the troposphere due to cycles between seawater and gaseous phases. Chloride, which is many times more abundant than bromine, reacts with nitrogen and oxygen- containing compounds in both the aqueous and gas phases to form a variety of molecules that scatter light, including HCl, Cl2, ClNO2, ClO, and OClO. Finlayson-Pitts also helped author a 2012 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences which concluded that new models may be needed to address secondary organic aerosols. Finlayson-Pitts worked with scientists from UCI and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington to research the processes leading to secondary organic aerosol formation. More specifically, they studied particle formation under the simultaneous oxidation Œ±-pinene by ozone and NO3 radicals using an aerosol flow system. Œ±-Pinene is are emitted by vegetation in varying quantities, depending on temperature and light conditions. The reaction of Œ±-pinene with NO3 radicals in the atmosphere creates low-volatility particles, generating secondary organic aerosols. These particles were previously thought to condense into tiny droplets of liquid and then dissipate as those drops of liquid evaporate. Finlayson-Pitts and the team she worked with found that secondary organic aerosols actually attach themselves more tightly to organic particles in the air. Because of this, previous models underestimate the amount of fine particles, which are linked to both lung and heart disease, in the air. Her research group has received funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. They are a part of Atmospheric Integrated Research for Understanding Chemistry at Interfaces (AirUCI), a collaboration from across the University of California-Irvine. AirUCI examines how air quality and climate change are affected by processes that occur at the atmosphere's air-water interface, and focuses on the impacts of energy use, air pollution, and air quality on human health.  Personal life  Barbara J. Finlayson-Pitts married James Pitts (1921‚Äì2014) in 1970. James Pitts was also a chemist. He followed her to the University of California, Irvine in 1994, where the two collaborated on research and co-authored books and other publications.

Henry IV urgently wanted to defend the Anglo-Scottish border, and to overcome his predecessor's legacy of failed military campaigns. A large army was assembled slowly and marched into Scotland. Not only was no pitched battle ever attempted, but the king did not try and besiege Scotland's capital, Edinburgh. Henry's army left at the end of the summer after only a brief stay, mostly camped near Leith (near Edinburgh) where it could maintain contact with its supply fleet. The campaign ultimately accomplished little except to further deplete the king's coffers, and is historically notable only for being the last one led by an English king on Scottish soil. Background Henry IV of England (painted 1597-1618) War with Scotland had started under Edward I, cross-border raids and fighting had been the norm in Anglo-Scottish relations since the 1370s, generally in the form of Scottish incursions over the border and English attempts to repel them. The 1399 revolution, which eventually deposed Richard II, created further opportunity for Scotland to regain the land between the River Tweed and the Solway Firth. As Historian Chris Given-Wilson has put it, 'England's confusion was Scotland's opportunity,' and in May 1399 Wark Castle was destroyed by a Scottish raid. The invasion, then, started being planned almost as soon as Henry took the throne. At least one historian has noted a tradition, by then, of newly crowned kings of England launching military campaigns at the beginning of their reigns. Edward III had done so the same year his reign commenced; Richard II immediately on reaching his majority, and Henry V would do so within three years. These campaigns have been summarised as \\"enforcing....royal will and testing loyalty towards a newly established regime\\" as well as for established strategic goals. Although it has been suggested that Henry 'hoped to maintain peaceful relations' with the Scots, elements among the English nobility were not averse to a pre-emptive strike, either. In particular the Percys ‚Äì the Earl of Northumberland and his son Henry Percy (called 'Hotspur') ‚Äì who were Wardens of the East and West March, saw a Scottish war as an opportunity for their own dynastic aggrandisement. Indeed, some contemporaries believed that the invasion was actually instigated by them; the King was forced to deny it, in person, to the sitting parliament in November 1399. A.L. Brown has suggested that this indicates the personal interest the King felt in the affair: that this was in fact his own personal plan, and 'that it meant a lot to him, and that it had met with criticism.' He pledged to fulfil this vow before god. At almost the same time, Henry had received a letter from the Scottish king in which Henry was referred to as duke of Lancaster rather than king of England; this, it has been suggested, fuelled his martial enthusiasm towards Scotland. Perhaps even more persuasive to Henry than the wishes of his northern nobility were the visible divisions within the Scottish nobility. George Dunbar, Earl of March had felt that he had been betrayed by the then regent of Scotland, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany, over the proposed marriage of Dunbar's daughter to David Stewart, Earl of Carrick, heir to the Scottish throne, and Albany's nephew. This marriage never came to pass, however; Carrick married Mary Douglas, the daughter of Dunbar's rival on the march, the earl of Douglas. Dunbar, in his 'outraged honour,' appealed to Henry IV for assistance. Already known as 'one of the finest soldiers of his age [and] until now an implacable enemy' of England, Dunbar travelled to London and pledged allegiance to Henry IV. When Henry invaded Scotland, he was accompanied by Dunbar. Dunbar was not only an example of the divisions within the Scottish nobility, but one of Scotland's own greatest military commanders. The campaign Arms of George Dunbar, Earl of March Although Henry had announced his plans at the November 1399 parliament, he did not attempt a winter campaign, but continued to hold quasi-negotiations 'in which he must have felt the Scots were profoundly irritating.' At the same time, it appears that the House of Commons was not keen on the forthcoming war, and, since extravagance had been a major complaint against Henry's predecessor, Henry was probably constrained in requesting a subsidy. At this point, parliament was clearly still opposed to a Scottish war, and may eve have believed a possible French invasion the imperative issue. In June 1400, the king summonsed his Duchy of Lancaster retainers to muster at York, and they in turn brought their personal feudal retinues. At this point, with the invasion being obvious to all, the Scots attempted to re-open negotiations. Although Scottish ambassadors arrived at York to meet the king around 26 June, they returned to Scotland within two weeks. Although the army was summoned to assemble at York on 24 June, it did not approach Scotland until mid-August. This was due to the gradual arrival of army supplies (in some cases, with much delay ‚Äî the King's own tents, for example, were not despatched from Westminster until halfway through July). Brown suggests that Henry was well aware of the delays these preparations would cause the campaign. At some point before the army left for Scotland, the muster was met by the Constable of England, Henry Percy, Earl of Northumberland, and the Earl Marshal, Ralph Neville, Earl of Westmorland. Individual leaders of each retinue present were then paid a lump sum to later distribute in wages to their troops: Men-at-arms received one shilling a day, archers half that, but captains and leaders do not appear to have been paid at a higher rate. The army left York on 25 July and reached Newcastle-upon-Tyne four days later; it was plagued by shortages of supplies, particularly food, of which more had had to be requested before even leaving York. As the campaign progressed, bad weather exacerbated the problem of food shortages, and Brown has speculated that this was an important consideration in the short duration of the expedition. It has been estimated that Henry's army was around 13,000 men, A.J., Border Bloodshed (East Lothian, 2000), 75. of which 800 men-at-arms and 2000 archers came directly from the Royal Household. This was \\"one of the largest raised in late medieval England;\\" Brown notes that whilst it was smaller than the massive army assembled in 1345 (that would fight the Battle of Cr√©cy), it was larger than most that were mustered for French service. The English fleet also patrolled the east coast of Scotland in order to besiege Scottish trade and to resupply the army when required. At least three convoys were sent from London and the Humber, the first of which delivered 100 tonnes of flour and ten tonnes of sea salt to Henry's army in Scotland. Henry crossed the border in mid-August. Given-Wilson has noted the care Henry took not to ravage or pillage the countryside on their march through Berwickshire and Lothian. This was in marked contrast to previous expeditions, and Given-Wilson compares it specifically to the 'devastation wreacked' in last such campaign, by Richard II in 1385. This he puts this down to the presence in the English army of the earl of Dunbar, whose lands they were. Brown has suggested the king 'envisaged ... a punitive expedition' with either a confrontation or such a chevauch√©e that the Scots would be eager to negotiate. In the event, they offered no resistance as the English army marched through Haddington. However, Henry's army never progressed further than Leith; there the army could keep in physical contact with the supporting fleet. Henry took a personal interest in his convoys, at one point even verbally instructing that two Scottish fishermen fishing in the Firth of Forth were to be paid ¬£2 for their (unspecified) assistance. However, Henry never besieged Edinburgh Castle where the Duke of Rothsay was ensconced. By now, Brown says, Henry's campaign had been reduced to a 'war of words.' By 29 August, the English army had returned to the other side of the border. Aftermath John Sadler has described this expedition as 'like so many of its predecessors, fail[ing] to yield any significant results,' neither forcing the Scots onto a battlefield nor making any major territorial gains. Brown too has described the campaign as 'utterly futile.' Sadler has ascribed the Scottish success in part to their reliance on a Fabian strategy to wear out the English whilst avoiding direct confrontation. Henry's lacklustre campaign was condemned by contemporary observers, with Welsh chronicler Adam of Usk saying that the Scots did more damage to the English than had been done to them. Likewise, the Scotichronicon suggested that 'nothing worthy of remembrance was done' by their enemies. The king had been 'desperately short of money' in February, before the campaign had begun; by the time it was over, he was left even shorter. The campaign had cost at least ¬£10,000, but had yielded nothing in booty or ransom. Henry still needed to pay his army's wages ‚Äì the merchant sailors' wages alone were ¬£500 ‚Äì and with the crown now a few thousand pounds further in debt, a parliament was summoned for York. Before either finances or parliament had been resolved, the Glynd≈µr Rising, which continued for the rest of Henry's reign, had begun in Wales. Henry IV's campaign into Scotland in June 1400 was to be the last one ever led by an English king in person.

She served as the First Lady of Zambia from 1991 until her separation from her former husband, President Frederick Chiluba, in 2001. In 2006, she made her political comeback by being elected to the National Assembly of Zambia from Kasenengwa constituency. Biography Tembo was married to Frederick Chiluba, with whom she had nine children, for thirty-three years, until he announced their separation in 2000. Chiluba became President of Zambia in 1991, making Tembo the country's First Lady from 1991 until their divorce. Tembo left the State House, the presidential residence, shortly after Chiluba's announcement and moved in with family in Ndola. Their divorce became final on September 25, 2001, when an annulment was granted by a local court in Ndola after thirty-three years of marriage. Vera Tembo described the circumstances of her separation and divorce from Chiluba as \\"humiliating.\\" She campaigned during the 2001 general election by urging Zambian women to vote in the election. She also signaled her intention to enter politics. Chiluba left office in December 2001 after failing to win support for a third presidential term, which was banned by the country's Constitution. Former President Frederick Chiluba married his girlfriend, Regina Mwanza, in 2002, a few months after his divorce from Tembo was finalized. By early 2002, Zambian newspapers reported that Tembo was living in poverty after Chiluba had allegedly frozen her bank account. She filed a $2.5 U.S. dollar lawsuit against Chiluba as part of the divorce settlement. The Zambian government offered Tembo financial assistance in May 2002 after she listed her personal possessions in an auction. In 2006, Tembo ran for the Kasenengwa constituency seat in the Zambia as a Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) candidate. She won the election and became the first woman to represent Kasenengwa, a largely rural seat in her home Eastern Province, in the National Assembly. In October 2006, shortly after the election, President Levy Mwanawasa appointed Tembo as Deputy Minister of Tourism, Environment and Natural Resources in his cabinet. Vera Tembo, who was re-appointed as Deputy Minister by Mwanawasa's successor, President Rupiah Banda, held the ministry portfolio from 2006 until 2011, when she left the National Assembly. In 2010, Tembo oversaw the relocation of black rhinoceroses to North Luangwa National Park and other natural areas of Zambia, citing the program as a boost to both the country's environment and the tourism industry. In March 2015, Vera Tembo announced that she had become a Christian pastor and had founded a new church called the Healing International Ministry.

This conference has become one of the leading conferences regarding monetary policy in the world. He has served as co-editor of the Journal of Business and the Journal of Political Economy.  Research  His PhD dissertation included one of the first papers to analyze firm-level transactions prices. Using data from mail order retailers he studied the way prices are set finding that they change about once a year, the size of price change is very irregular for a given item, the last digit of the price influences the probability that the price will change and the same item often will have some periods when the price may be constant for more than a year and at other times may change by only one or two percent. These findings contradict the predictions of the simplest ‚Äúmenu cost‚Äù pricing models that suppose that prices are only changed when the benefit of doing so exceeds a fixed given cost of changing them (because the presence of both small changes and long period of no changes imply that sometime this cost must be small and other times must be larger.) They have subsequently been confirmed in numerous other studies using larger data sets from other time periods and other countries. His dissertation also included research with Takeo Hoshi and David Scharfstein that was among the first to use the unique institutional features of the Japanese economy to test a number of theories about financial markets. They observed that groups of firms in Japan that are members of the same keiretsu coordinate some activities, most notably sharing funding from a group bank implying that the banking relationships within these groups help overcome problems that are present in more arms-length funding arrangements. One example would be providing assistance to firms that are temporarily distressed. Normally, firms with transient low profitability would not be able to convince a lender to forbear on upcoming payments because the lender might fear that doing so would only allow other creditors to be repaid and the lender may never recover its funds if the borrower's fortunes do not improve. Within groups, however, the banks have incentives to take a long-term view and to assist the borrower, recognizing that when the borrower recovers they can recoup their assistance. Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein found that this pattern was present empirically: group-affiliated firms were able to invest and sell more when they were in trouble than unaffiliated firms. A second example is the prediction that many firms might have trouble obtaining funding because lenders could not fully judge their investment prospects and ability to repay. These borrowing constraints could force firms to grow more slowly than otherwise if these information problems were not present. Within a group these problems should be less of an issue because of the repeated interactions and other information sharing arrangements practiced by the groups. Hoshi, Kashyap and Scharfstein tested this prediction by examining whether the keiretsu banks supported the keiretsu firms by allowing them to invest irrespective of whether the firms had cash-on-hand to pay for the investment. They found that the investment of the group firms was less sensitive to the resources inside these firms compared to similar firms that were not group members. This pair of papers not only provided early evidence in favor of theories that emphasized the importance of information problems in hampering the performance of firms, but also spurred other economists to look for institutional arrangements that might provide novel ways to test these theories. Around the time that these papers were published, Japan deregulated its financial system and that changed the way the keiretsu operated. Hoshi and Kashyap went on to continue studying the evolution of the Japanese financial system in the wake of the deregulation. They wrote on the history of the Japanese financial system‚Äîone of the first papers on the Japanese banking crisis, and winner of the 45th Nikkei Prize for Excellent Books in Economic Science. Later, with Ricardo Caballero, they popularized the idea that the ongoing financial problems were creating \\"zombie firms.\\". Their notion of a zombie is a firm that was insolvent or virtually so, but was protected from bankruptcy because their banks were hesitant to foreclose upon them for fear of having to recognize the losses. These weak banks would engage in sham loan restructurings to present the appearance that the firms were viable, hoping that the firms might eventually recover. Caballero, Hoshi and Kashyap find that the presence of the zombie firms contributed to the slow growth in Japan after its acute financial crisis in 1997. Just after finishing graduate school, Kashyap and Jeremy Stein began a long collaboration that examined the role of banks in transmission of monetary policy. They explored whether central bank open-market operations have special effects because the central bank's counterparties were banks who require central bank reserves to operate. In traditional analyses, monetary operations that change reserves matter because they affect the amount of deposits that banks can offer and because deposits are a form of money, this changes the volume of transactions in the economy. Kashyap and Stein noted that reserve changes also have implications for the other side of the banks‚Äô balance sheet. They investigated whether the expansion in loans that comes when bank reserves increase, which they dubbed the ‚Äúbank lending channel,‚Äù had a separate effect on the economy. They first tested this conjecture using aggregate U.S. data in a paper with David Wilcox and found that when the Federal Reserve tightened policy, bank lending fell and the lending reduction caused a drop in spending. Subsequently, Kashyap and Stein used bank level data to show that lending by banks that were more dependent on central bank funding was more responsive to central bank policy. Kashyap and Stein then collaborated with Raghuram Rajan on two noteworthy papers on financial intermediation. The first, winner of the 2002 Brattle Distinguished Paper Prize and published in the Journal of Finance, proposed a theory for why banks have debt which is demandable and loans which are longer term. They conjectured that there is a synergy between offering sight deposits (aka checking accounts, or demandable debt) and loan commitments (the antecedents to loans). Both checking accounts and loan commitments require the institution offering them to have a pool of liquidity. The liquidity can be used to honor a deposit withdrawal or the takedown of a commitment (after which it is converted into a loan). The link between these two goes back all the way to medieval money changers; Kashyap et al. presented empirical evidence showing that banks which had more loan commitments tended to also have more checking accounts, and they showed why this is optimal for imperfectly correlated withdrawals and commitment takedowns because of the cost savings from accommodating both with a common pool of liquidity. These authors subsequently proposed a debt contract that would convert into equity when a bank is distressed. This suggestion was dubbed by the New York Times as one of the best ideas of 2008, although other variants of this suggestion existed before their paper. Banks that have issued these kinds of securities, commonly called contingent, convertible securities (CoCos) have been allowed to count them towards capital requirements after the global financial crisis.  Popular writings  Kashyap, Rajan, and Stein joined the Squam Lake Group, along with David Scharfstein, Douglas Diamond, Hyun Song Shin (the latter two are also co-authors with Kashyap) and a number of other distinguished scholars. This group of \\"...fifteen of the world's leading economists-- representing the broadest spectrum of economic opinion\\" wrote a number of policy memos detailing how financial regulation after the global financial crisis should be amended. Their book that compiled and extended the recommendations was widely acclaimed. Kashyap also has written several op-eds and blog posts since the beginning of the global financial crisis that have been prescient or recognized as offering excellent contemporaneous summaries of current events. Kashyap and Shin, shortly after the collapse of Bear Stearns, called for a mandate that banks suspend dividends in a Financial Times comment. Subsequent analysis has indicated that if banks had been held to this standard their capital positions would have been much stronger. Kashyap, writing also in the Financial Times, was one of the first proponents to argue that banks should be required to file ‚Äúliving wills‚Äù that describe how they could be closed without cost to the taxpayer. Globally systemically important financial institutions are now required to file such documents. Diamond and Kashyap wrote a blog post] for the New York Times the day after the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy that was one the most widely read descriptions of the bankruptcy and its aftermath. Kashyap wrote a primer on the Greek financial crisis in 2015 that continues to be widely read.  External awards and activities  Kashyap's research has won him numerous awards. In December 2017 he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun 3rd class Gold Rays with Neck Ribbon \\"for playing a vital role in promoting and disseminating high-quality research on the Japanese financial system and Japan's economic policies\\" as well as bringing together Japanese and American economic researchers. Other awards include a Sloan Research Fellowship, the Nikkei Prize for Excellent Books in Economic Sciences, and a Senior Houblon-Norman Fellowship from the Bank of England (twice). He was appointed to the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) as a faculty research fellow in 1993 and as a research associate in 1996. On behalf of the NBER he founded the Japan Project Meeting that is a prominent conference organized around the Japanese economy. He was elected to the American Economic Association Executive Committee and on behalf of the AEA has served on and chaired several committees. Kashyap has also held a number of advisory or consulting positions with public sector organizations. These appointments include assignments at the Federal Reserve Banks of Chicago and New York, the Congressional Budget Office, the International Monetary Fund, the Office of Financial Research, the European Central Bank, and Central Banks of Finland and Sweden, the Japanese External Trade Organization, and the Economic and Social Research Institute of Japanese Cabinet Office. He served on the Board of Directors of the Bank of Italy's Einuadi Institute of Economics and Finance and is a member of the Squam Lake Group. He has been a Research Fellow for the Centre for Economic Policy Research since 2017. On September 1, 2016 Kashyap was appointed to the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee for a term of three years beginning October 1, 2016, and reappointed in 2019. https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/news/2019/april/professor-anil-kashyap-and- michael-saunders-reappointed-to-boe-policy-committees  Personal  His parents are Tapeshwar Singh Kashyap and Janice M.

It supports about 200 families engaged in extraction of forest products, small-scale farming and animal husbandry. Location The Rio Greg√≥rio Extractive Reserve is divided between the municipalities of Ipixuna (58.76%) and Eirunep√© (41.22%) in the state of Amazonas. It has an area of . To the north it is bounded by the Kulina do M√©dio Juru√° Indigenous Territory. The border with the state of Acre defines the southern limit of the reserve. The reserve adjoins the Rio Greg√≥rio State Forest and the Mogno State Forest in Acre. The reserve is south of the Juru√° River, and southeast of the town of Ipixuna. The Greg√≥rio River runs through the reserve from Acre in a northeast direction. The Greg√≥rio River is a tributary of the middle section of the Juru√° River. The reserve protects 80% of the sources of the river. The reserve may be reached by float plane or by river. History The Rio Greg√≥rio Extractive Reserve was created by Amazonas state decree 26.586 of 25 April 2007 with an area of . The Instituto Nacional de Coloniza√ß√£o e Reforma Agr√°ria (INCRA, National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform) recognised the reserve on 12 November 2007 as supporting 157 families of small farmers, who would qualify for PRONAF assistance. This was adjusted to 200 families on 12 November 2008. When created the reserve included an area of territory disputed between the states of Acre and Amazonas. The supreme court of Brazil settled the case in favour of Acre in 2008, and the reserve was reduced to about . The deliberative council was created on 28 January 2009. The management plan was approved on 13 May 2013. On 15 December 2014 an area of privately-owned property of was alienated by the state. The land had been owned by R. Pereira & Cia. since the early 20th century, but had not been identified in the 2010 management plan. The state did not have the money to pay compensation for the property. On 11 March 2016 the limits of the reserve were altered to now encompass . of the R. Pereira & Cia. land was excluded from the reserve, but over of land to the west was added. On 24 February and 3 March 2015 about 270 inhabitants of the reserve participated in a major event led by the Amazonas Sustainable Foundation promoting health, education and citizenship. This included pre-registration of 425 elementary school children and distribution of almost 4,000 sachets for purifying water on the reserve. In the next three weeks the number of cases of diarrhea dropped to zero, compared to four or five cases per week before. It was expected that 19 teachers would give lessons in 15 schools in the reserve built or renovated by the Bolsa Floresta over the previous four years. As of 2016 the reserve was covered by the Amazon Region Protected Areas Program. On 21‚Äì22 May 2016 a meeting of 126 ribeirinhos (river people) from 27 locations in the reserve elected a new board for the Rio Greg√≥rio Extractive Reserve Association of Agroextractive Residents (Amarge). This is the main institution representing the people of the reserve, a partner of the Bolsa Floresta Program. The meeting was supported by the Amazonas Sustainable Foundation, Bradesco and the Amazonia Fund/Brazilian Development Bank. Environment The reserve is about 77% covered by open rainforest and the remainder is covered by dense rainforest. The original forest is very well preserved, with only about modified by the settlements and their gardens. There is a wide range of extractive products such as rubber, copaiba oil, buriti fruit, tagua seed, vines, and the acai, andiroba and patau√° fruits. Initial studies show that the reserve is an ecologically interesting area, with 13 species of monkeys. The Rio Tapaj√≥s saki (Pithecia irrorata vanzolini), emperor tamarin (Saguinus imperator subgriscenses), brown-mantled tamarin (Saguinus fuscicollis melanoleucus) and bald uakari (Cacajao calvus novaesi) are endemic to this area of the Amazon. The region was exploited for rubber from the end of the 19th century. After the rubber boom ended there were 19 communities descended from the pioneer rubber tappers, who still extract forest products. The rubber tappers form small communities along the Greg√≥rio River. They are also engaged in agriculture, hunting, fishing and animal husbandry. The management plan allows no more than 5% of the total area to be used for farming or pasturage. Threats include possible release of buffalo, pigs and other exotic species that threaten the ecosystems, over-fishing, trade in wildlife and domestic livestock, and illegal logging.

The organization maintains a historic art gallery located at 90 Lyme Street in Old Lyme, Connecticut, located in the Old Lyme Historic District. The gallery was built in 1921 and designed by famed architect and artist Charles A. Platt. Exhibitions are held throughout the year by member artists as well as visiting artists. The building also has a north-light studio where classes are conducted year-round. Origins 1902 Exhibition announcement Henry Ward Ranger The LAA is an outgrowth of the Old Lyme Art Colony, an art colony established by Henry Ward Ranger, a leading tonalist painter from New York. After discovering the town of Old Lyme in 1899, Ranger returned with like-minded tonalist painters in 1900. Boarding at the house of Florence Griswold, now the Florence Griswold Museum, the artists painted the local countryside. In the summer of 1902, the village library committee asked the artists to hold a two-day exhibition at the Phoebe Griffin Noyes Library. Proceeds from the exhibition were to benefit the library. Sales from the exhibition were high, with art enthusiasts travelling to the show from New York and Boston. The show, consisting entirely of landscapes depicting the local countryside, featured Tonalist artists Henry Ward Ranger, Allen Butler Talcott, Clark Voorhees, Frank DuMond, William Henry Howe, Gifford Beal, Walter Griffin, Louis Paul Dessar, Arthur Dawson, and Lewis Cohen. Each summer, large crowds would travel to the annual exhibitions, travelling by train to see the work at the library. In 1903, Childe Hassam was the sole Impressionist among the tonalist exhibition, and his presence marked a turning point among the painters toward a more impressionist style. In 1905, the Impressionist painter Willard Metcalf exhibited two works at the library. In subsequent years, artists such as Bruce Crane, Henry Rankin Poore, Robert Vonnoh, Bessie Potter Vonnoh, Matilda Browne, Lawton S. Parker, Everett Warner, Ivan Olinsky, George Henry Bogert, Wilson Irvine, Edward Volkert, Carleton Wiggins, Guy C. Wiggins, Harry L. Hoffman, Edward F. Rook, Lydia Longacre, Clifford Grayson, Lawton S. Parker, William S. Robinson, Frank Bicknell and Will Howe Foote would exhibit in the annual shows. The group incorporates By 1913, the artists began to discuss building a permanent art gallery in town. Poor lighting was an issue in the library. Also, as many as forty artists were exhibiting in the summer shows, and adequate gallery space was needed. In April 1914, the artists held an exhibition in the Francis Building in New York City to raise money for a building fund. The artists donated their works at reduced prices, and Florence Griswold managed the exhibition. On Friday, June 26, 1914, the artists and local townspeople held a meeting at the home of Florence Griswold. Judge Walter C. Noyes drew up articles of incorporation for the group, which were approved and accepted at the meeting, now called the Lyme Art Association. Judge Noyes was also elected the first President of the new association. In July 1914, the group filed a certificate of incorporation with the State of CT, signed by Noyes, Joseph S. Huntington, and artists Lewis Cohen, William S. Robinson, and Frank Bicknell. The organization was attempting to raise $40,000 for the building fund of a permanent art gallery in Old Lyme. Florence Griswold Site Option for Lyme Art Association, 1914 They sought to build, as one newspaper put it: \\"...the long dreamed of Temple of Art, home of the association and the center to be, of an artistique manifestation that will have a greater national influence than ever.\\" Building the gallery Initially in 1914, plans for an art gallery were drawn up by New York architect Richard A. Walker, for a building to cost $14,000. The organization at this time was deciding between the purchase a portion of Florence Griswold's property, and a larger property further down the street. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, plans for raising funds for the building of the gallery were delayed. In 1917, Lyme Art Association purchased land on Lyme Street just south of the home of Florence Griswold. This was land she deeded to LAA for a final selling price of $1,000. In July 1919, the LAA voted to unite with the town of Old Lyme to build a Memorial Town Hall, with the agreement that the artists could hold their annual exhibition in the memorial building for one month each summer. LAA designated their building fund for this project, but withdrew it in December 1919 as the town objected to any group having exclusive use of the town hall. Charles A. Platt plan for Lyme Art Association 1920 In 1920, American Renaissance architect Charles A. Platt had designed the gallery of the LAA, a service he donated to the group. Due to the fact the artists were self-funding and the resources were limited, the artists asked him to lower the skylights of his initial design, which he reluctantly agreed to do. New London-based contractors Canning & Leary were awarded the contract to construct Platt's final design, for a building cost of $20,000. Artist Lawton S. Parker chaired the building committee for LAA working with Charles Platt. Work on the construction of the gallery began in September 1920. Lyme Art Association in 1922 On August 6, 1921, the Lyme Art Association Gallery was unveiled. The building measured 25'x88' with a wing 25'x32' and one high story. The gallery was built in a T-shape, with trellises wrapping around the back of the structure, which were ready to collect the vines that were beginning to grow. The building featured \\"white-dipped\\" shingles. The New York Times wrote about the unveiling: \\"Greater appropriateness, beauty of proportions and refinement of taste could hardly be found. The building belongs to the location as completely as a Connecticut wildflower to the countryside...to come upon it in the pleasant landscape is recognize it immediately as an embodiment of art in harmony with its natural surroundings\\" Lyme Art Association Gallery inaugural exhibition August 1921 Skylights at Lyme Art Association Inside, the walls were \\"dusky-blue\\" with \\"a faint suggestion of gold\\". The lighting from the skylights was considered perfect, with an even distribution of natural light on the walls. This was made possible by a translucent ceiling of white muslin lay-lights below the skylights. Inside the gallery, four large pillars stand, which can be removed to create one hall. Florence Griswold was the first gallery manager of the new building. Goodman Gallery 1922 painting of Honorary Lyme Art Association President William O. Goodman by Oliver Dennett Grover On June 11, 1938 the Lyme Art Association unveiled an additional wing, which it named the Goodman Gallery. Funds for the gallery were given by Erna Sawyer Goodman in memory of her husband, lumber tycoon William O. Goodman, who had been an honorary president of the association and a sponsor of many of its prizes. The builder of the new gallery, L.H. Tiffany, copied Platt's original design for the new gallery, but built it several steps lower, with two French doors leading out to a balcony that once overlooked a lily pond. Art studio In 1975 sculptor Elisabeth Gordon Chandler was elected president of LAA. In 1976, she founded a separate institution, now called the Lyme Academy College of Fine Arts, and made extensive alterations to accommodate it. Portrait Class in Lyme Art Association studio In 1978, she completed a two- story art studio, and transformed the basement to accommodate a library, offices, and storage rooms. Artists such as Robert Brackman, Deane G. Keller, and Lou Bonamarte, along with Chandler, taught in the space leased by the Academy. In June 1982, an historic flood hit Old Lyme. A brook running behind the association was blocked with debris, causing five feet of water to fill the studio and downstairs offices occupied by the Academy. Nevertheless, the academy continued to hold classes at the LAA until 1996 when its twenty-year lease expired. Exhibitions and events Alpheaus P. Cole Gallery at Lyme Art Association Lyme Art Association members serving tea during Centennial Exhibition in 2002 In 1921, during the 20th annual exhibition, Wilson Irvine was awarded the William S. Eaton Purchase Prize for his painting \\"Lingering Snow\\". The 20th annual exhibition in the new gallery had a paid attendance of over 5,000, with sales of artwork exceeding $10,000. In the 21st Annual Exhibition in 1922 Ivan Olinsky was awarded the first award under the Museum Purchase Plan, a program instituted to place LAA member work in associate museum members. Olinsky's painting \\"Leonore in a Russian Blouse\\" was allotted to the Dayton Art Institute. 1933 saw Lyme Art Association extend the exhibition season with their First Annual Autumn Exhibition. In October 1971, Lyme Art Association was included in the Old Lyme Historic District which was named to the National Register of Historic Places. This process was carried out by Mrs. John Crosby Brown, then President of the Lyme Historical Society- Florence Griswold Association. In 1972, heating was installed in the LAA gallery, allowing exhibitions to take place during the colder months. In 1996, a major retrospective at LAA was held to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the gallery. Works by Henry Ward Ranger, Bruce Crane, Robert Vonnoh, Willard Metcalf, Childe Hassam, Carleton Wiggins, Guy C. Wiggins and William Chadwick were featured. Artwork by Ornithologist Roger Tory Peterson was also on display. Also featured was the Goodman Presentation Case, consisting of 35 small works by early Lyme artists, which were originally presented to LAA honorary President William O. Goodman. In 1997, a footbridge linking Florence Griswold Museum and LAA was built, a project proposed by the museum. In 2002 LAA held a centennial exhibition to commemorate the first exhibition at the Phoebe Griffin Noyes Library in 1902. 130 early works of 76 of the early members were displayed along with work by current members. During the exhibition, Lieutenant Governor Jodi Rell visited the gallery and declared July 8 \\"Lyme Art Association Day\\" to honor the centennial. Additionally, LAA featured a retrospective of the work of Deane G. Keller, entitled \\"Go Figure\\", concurrent with the Centennial Exhibition. In 2005, the gallery held a retrospective exhibition of the architect of Lyme Art Association, Charles A. Platt, featuring many of his paintings and etchings. In 2010, a flood sent two feet of water into the basement of LAA, causing more than $60,000 worth of damage, and the loss of archival material. In 2014, the widow of artist and teacher Foster Caddell gave a generous gift to LAA's endowment. The south gallery was renamed Caddell Gallery during the 94th Annual Elected Artist Exhibition the following year. LAA is embarking on a Second Century Campaign, to restore the historic gallery building. In 2018, Laurie Pavlos was named executive director of the organization. During March 2020, LAA made the decision to cancel the opening reception to \\"Yin and Yang\\" show, and close the gallery until the end of the month due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The gallery officially reopened to the public on June 26, 2020 with two new exhibitions. Association presidents Presidents of Lyme Art Association: * Walter C.

He soon raised $160,000 with many dharma friends and when looking for charitable relief organizations he was dismayed to discover a dearth of Buddhist organizations. Three years later, Bodhi authored an article in Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly entitled \\"A Challenge to Buddhists\\" which urged American Buddhists to be more socially engaged. Inspired by the article, Bodhi with some of his students formally established Buddhist Global Relief in June 2008 and had it registered the corporation in New Jersey.

He is also notable as one of Belgium's highest ranking soldiers of Jewish origin. Biography Louis Bernheim was born into a Jewish family in Saint-Josse-ten-Noode, Brussels in Belgium on 1 September 1861. His parents had emigrated to Belgium from Nancy, France in 1858. Entering the √âcole Militaire in 1878, he joined the Regiment of Grenadiers as a second lieutenant at the age of 19. He later taught at the Royal Military Academy in Brussels and rose through the ranks rapidly. By the time of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914, Bernheim was serving as a lieutenant-colonel in the 7th Regiment of the Line. Bernheim was promoted to command the 3rd Brigade during the Siege of Antwerp in September 1914 and commanded his unit during the fighting around the Nete. He was promoted to major-general in November and, in 1915, was given command of the 1st Army Division in the Steenstrate section of the Yser Front. During an inspection of his troops at the front in September 1915, he was severely wounded by an enemy artillery shell but returned to service after just two months' convalescence. In March 1916, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-general. His command of the 1st Army Division coincided with the emergence of the Frontbeweging in 1917, a Flemish Movement group which agitated against perceived discrimination in the army. Bernheim was attacked by Flamingant soldiers for his attempts to suppress it. In September 1918, he was placed in command of a group of three army divisions on the Yser during the Belgian advance in the Hundred Days' Offensive. Berheim's units were notably involved in the capture of the important forest at Houthulst. After the end of the war, he was promoted to Inspector General of the Infantry and he officially retired from the army in 1926. Among the awards received by Bernheim during his career was the L√©gion d'honneur and the Order of the Bath. Bernheim died in 1931 while visiting his daughter in Paris, France. As a freethinker, he had demanded to be cremated at his death and, because Belgian law did not permit it at the time, was cremated in France. His funeral was attended by King Albert I and the former prime minister, Charles de Broqueville. Bernheim is memorialised by an avenue in Etterbeek and by a public statue by Edmond de Val√©riola on the Square Marie-Louise, both in Brussels.

TV broadcasting began on 1 September 2016 at 8:00 p.m. on most TV operators (Bouygues Telecom, Orange, SFR, Numericable...), and on the TNT (Digital Terrestrial Television). As for and Canalsat, it began on 6 September. France Info involves France T√©l√©visions, Radio France, France M√©dias Monde (with France 24) and the Institut national de l'audiovisuel (INA). It shares its name with a global news service which gathers the TV channel itself, the radio channel France Info and the website www.francetvinfo.fr. France Info broadcasts from 06:00 seven days a week until 00:00 and simulcasts France 24 overnight. France Info can be watched live on YouTube (with a 12-hour rewind availability) and web.  Background  After LCI, CNEWS and BFMTV (available on free national DTT), and France 24 (worldwide and in √éle-de-France only), France Info is the fifth rolling news channel in France. The goal of France Info is to distance itself from the competition by focusing heavily on straight news coverage, hoping to offer a higher-quality news service. The channel's music was produced by French composer, Jean-Michel Jarre. France Info is supported by France T√©l√©visions, in particular France 2 and 3. The channel has 204 employees (176 at France T√©l√©visions, 28 at Radio France), as well as 3,000 journalists distributed among the editorial teams of France 2, France 3 R√©gions, R√©seau Outre-Mer premi√®re, Franceinfo, France Inter and France 24. Its total budget is 15 million euros for France T√©l√©visions and 3.5 million euros for Radio France. It includes the characteristic elements of rolling news channels (live bulletins, distinctive daypart-separated blocks) and debate and analysis programs. The sister radio station provides headline reminders three times each hour at :20, :40 and :50 past (four times an hour at :10, :20, :40 and :50 past between September 2016 and mid-January 2017), France 24 fills in the overnight programming (that would otherwise be filled in by continuous repeats of the day's last live newscast), and Ina offers magazines on \\"the news seen through a historical eye\\". France Info thus becomes a global public-service news offering that brings together radio and television and makes use of the experience of the public service as a whole in terms of information. This is the first major collaboration between public radio and television since 1975; at that time France Inter supplied the footage in the bulletins of the 3e cha√Æne couleur de l'ORTF (now France 3).  Programs  Unlike other news channels, France Info can be watched without sound, thanks to some reports being text-heavy. Journalists can explain the stories using an interactive touchscreen. The cameraman moves along with the journalists, with a mobile device accompanied. The tone is mostly offbeat, without forgetting to be serious if required. The presentation - done in a studio integrated directly into the newsroom by an anchorman and/or anchorwoman, serving as both news anchors and segment introducers - as well as the interactivity with the \\"Le Live\\" thread seen on the channel's website, are other distinctive differences. * France 24 - world news in simulcast with France 24 * franceinfo: et tout est plus clair - flagship banner for weekday afternoon and weekend rolling news block * 6h30:8h30 - breakfast rolling news block with Samuel √âtienne and Johanna Ghiglia *10h30:13h - morning rolling news block with Louis Laforge and Marianne Th√©oleyre *14h:17h - afternoon rolling news block with Sophie Le Saint *17h:19h - evening rolling news block with Djamel Mazi and Lucie Chaumette *21h:23h - late night rolling news block before Le 23h *Le 23h - final bulletin prior to overnight France 24 simulcast, introduced to help replace Soir 3 which previously aired on France 3 with Patricia Loison (Monday-Friday) and Sorya Khaldoun (Saturday and Sunday/Friday(Replacement)) * Le journal - hourly live news bulletins, last 12 minutes * :l'info - live headlines at :20, :40 and :50 every hour, simulcast with Franceinfo Radio * l'essentiel de l'info - bottom-of-the-hour headlines between 9am and 6pm * Les inform√©s de Franceinfo - nightly news debates, simulcast with Franceinfo Radio * Questions politiques - Sunday political interview, simulcast with France Inter  Presenters  = Studio Gilles Jacquier (from France T√©l√©visions) =  Main presenters  * Samuel √âtienne (6:30-9:30) *Djamel Mazi (9:30-13:30) * Louis Laforge (17:00-20:00) *Julien Benedetto (21:00-0:00)  Newsreaders  * Cl√©mence de la Baume (21:00-0:00) * Sorya Khaldoun (17:00-20:00) * Camille Grenu (weekends 18:00-0:00) * Christophe Gascard * Djamel Mazi * Karine Baste-R√©gis (6:30-9:30) * S√©bastien Thomas * Marine Demazure * Fr√©d√©rique H√©nault * Marianne Th√©oleyre * Alexandra Uzan = Studio \\"L'Info\\" (from Maison de la Radio) = Staff present live headlines every 10 minutes on TV and radio: * Agathe Mahuet * L√©o Chapuis * Bintily Diallo * Yasmina Adila * Pierrick Bonno * Edwige Coupez * David Dauba * Diane Ferchit * Gilles Halais * Victor Matet * St√©phane Milhomme * Lorrain S√©n√©chal = Studio 221 (from Maison de la Radio) = Radio presenters whose their shows are also simulcast on TV: * 8H30 Aphatie: Jean-Michel Aphatie, Guy Birenbaum, Fabienne Sintes and Gilles Bornstein * Les Inform√©s de Franceinfo: J√©r√¥me Cadet (Sunday) and Jean-Mathieu Pernin (weekday) * Le Clasico: Matteu Maestracci and Nicolas Demorand (weekday) and J√©r√¥me Cadet (Saturday) * 8H30 Politique: Ya√´l Goosz and Jules Lavie  References   External links  * Official Site * France T√©l√©visions Corporate site * Radio France site * France M√©dias Monde site * Institut national de l'audiovisuel site France T√©l√©visions France M√©dias Monde Radio France Television channels and stations established in 2016 Television stations in France 24-hour television news channels in France 2016 establishments in France French-language television stations ","title":"France Info (TV channel)"},{"id":"51444183","text":"Nebet Tepe is one of the hills of Plovdiv where the ancient town was founded.

As the town expanded, Nebet Tepe became the citadel of the town's acropolis. There are remains of a fortress walls, towers, and a postern from the time of Justinian leading down to the Maritsa river. Today, the archeological complex on the hill is one of the most popular tourist sights in Plovdiv and a cultural monument of national significance. Name The name \\"Nebet\\" comes from the Turkish words nevbet (meaning \\"guard\\") and tepe (meaning \\"hill\\") or \\"The hill of the guards\\". It is assumed that in ancient times the garrison that guarded the city was located on the hill. The hill has another name in ancient times - \\"The hill of Musaeus\\", which is associated with the Thracian Musaeus who was the most talented student of Orpheus. History Painting of the three hills (1885) Archeology The remains of fortress walls, towers and ancient buildings were found during the excavations on Nebet Tepe. The oldest part of the fortress on the hill was built with large syenite blocks roughly fitted together with minimal clearance between adjacent stones and no use of mortar, typical for the cyclopean masonry. archeologybg.weebly.com (in Bulgarian) The remains of the Western wall with the imposing quadrangular tower and its entrance are evidence of the Hellenistic period when the ancient town expanded and the fortress on Nebet Tepe became the citadel of the town's acropolis. There are also thick stone walls from latter periods and other ancient buildings. One of the most interesting excavations is the unique postern with staircase from Roman times - a secret tunnel in the rocks under the North wall built in the 6th century AD during the reign of Justinian. Some historians say that Apostle Paul walked through this tunnel. The postern is thought to have led to the banks of the Maritsa river. Water reservoirs used during enemy sieges were also located on the hill. A large rectangular water reservoir with a volume of 350 cum.m is preserved in the Southern part of Nebet Tepe. It was built of alternating layers of stones and bricks while the inner walls and the floor were treated with hydrophobic coating.

Coming from the rock scene at first, he later came to electronic music, starting Anoraak beside his drummer position. His music is related to the retro-synth and 80's inspired scenes recently highlighted by the movie Drive's soundtrack. His sound is described as \\"dreamy synth-filled tracks that fall somewhere on the spectrum between disco and new wave\\", \\"contemporary but retro-tinged\\" or \\"easy, breezy [...] chugging along on airy synthesizers like a weekend train to the beachside town of Nantes\\". Anoraak has collaborated with artists such as the former Swedish Italo Disco outfit Sally Shapiro, American singer Slow Shiver, French producer College, Danish singer Lydmor, and has also remixed numerous artists such as Neon Indian, Mika, Junkie XL, Wild Belle, Julian Perretta, among others.  Career  Rivi√®re started Anoraak circa 2008, when he released his debut album Nightdrive With You, first limited to 1000 copies, then reissued in Japan and Australia. The title track \\"Nightdrive with You\\" touched the entire blogosphere, and got highlighted on the Myspace US homepage. He first started to perform in France, and eventually made it to the USA early 2009 with a first show at Webster Hall in New York. Anoraak's second album Wherever The Sun Sets launched in 2011. UK's Clash Magazine review lauded Anoraak's mix of italo-disco, indie rock, and 80s pop, writing \\"he does it so well it‚Äôs as if these sounds were born to be together despite being totally disparate\\". Anoraak then grew up to a 3 piece band, playing renowned France's Festival des Inrocks, SXSW festival in Austin, Texas, Noise Music Festival in Monterrey, Mexico before embarking on The Drive Tour in 2012 with College and Electric Youth in USA and Canada. In 2013, his third album Chronotropic came out, \\"lead[ing] the way in sunset-inspired dance pop\\" according to Nest HQ and described as \\"new wave vocals on disco\\" by French magazine Tsugi, quickly followed by the EP Reworks, alternative versions of tracks from the album, whose track Guest Star (Rework) was premiered on Rolling Stone. Back as a solo act, he keeps performing mostly stateside. After releasing in 2015 the single Odds Are Good on the Belgian label Eskimo Recordings, he came back in 2016 with the EP Figure, out on his own imprint Endless Summer Music. The title track's video was premiered on British trendsetting site Nowness, and Brooklyn based online publication Vehllingo stated that this EP \\"embod[ies] the different personality traits of Anoraak‚Äôs various experiments over the years\\". The same year he teamed up with Anglo French duo Loframes for the track \\"Since You've Gone\\" released on Los Angeles based label Midnight in Paris In June 2017, Anoraak released Black Gold Sun, described by Australian webzine Acid Stag as \\"Italo-disco, retro-synth, electro-pop goodness\\". The video for the track Last Call was premiered on major online French media Konbini. He's on the bill for the 2018 edition of Electric Daisy Carnival in Mexico. In November 2019, Anoraak premiered a more nu-disco sound with \\"Panarea\\" on the Vehlinggo Presents: 5 Years compilation.

The game was released worldwide on September 8, 2016, through online digital distribution platforms, primarily Steam and GOG.com, and has received generally positive reviews. The game has spawned five DLC packs, which provided additional gameplay features and content.  Reception  The game was fairly well received on release garnering a 7 out of 10 review score from IGN, and an 8 out of 10 from IGN Germany. IGN praised Project Highrise for being able to quickly and easily craft a smooth, self-sufficient system from the ground up thanks to a welcoming and fast-paced simplicity, and Rock, Paper, Shotgun called the ability for the player to easily understand what was going on, despite the deep levels of complexity, the game's biggest achievement. Despite the praise, Project Highrise was also criticized for its lack of personality due to its artistic style and color palette. The way how each room looked was thought to be too similar and as such, larger skyscrapers could look monotonous. Project Highrise has a score of 73/100 on Metacritic.

He specialized in making clothed women of glamour, grace and beauty look like they were wearing virtually nothing. His style was popular with fashion and women's magazines, as well as with advertisers. Early life John La Gatta was born in Naples, Italy, the son of an educated father and a mother from an old and well-connected family which traced their origins back to the Count of Anjou, brother of King Louis IX of France.Illustration magazine, volume 13 issue number 52, 2016, \\"John La Gatta\\" by Daniel Zimmer, pg 5 La Gatta was a sickly child. Around the age of four his mother died in childbirth. His father, a jewelry designer, left Italy and eventually emigrated to the United States. Growing up in New York city's rough lower east side, La Gatta showed an early talent for art. In the fall of 1909, the 15-year-old enrolled in the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts (now Parsons School of Design)Le Gatta Fine Art (http://lagattafineart.com/) where he excelled at charcoal draftsman and the portrayal of form and motion. He studied under artists Kenneth Hayes Miller and Frank Alvah Parsons. La Gatta was selling sketches to Life magazine to pay for his formal education and after graduation he continued working for Life and doing advertising illustrations for N. W. Ayer, one of the nation's early and largest advertising agencies. His work from this period often showed everyday working life. Early career In 1914, La Gatta moved to Philadelphia to design film posters for Lubian Film Company. On the way to Chicago by train in 1916 to pursue a well-paying job, the 22-year-old got off on an impulse in Cleveland to meet with Nelson Amsden, who had been recruiting La Gatta. Amsden offered him a job at his advertising art studio on the spot and La Gatta immediately accepted. In Cleveland, he met and married Amsden's cousin, beautiful Florence Eugenia Olds, an art student at the Cleveland School of Art.100 Years of Illustration, John La Gatta, by Paul Giambarba (http://giam.typepad.com/100_years_of_illustration/john_la_gatta_18941977/page/2/) John and Florence were married just short of 60 years. They eventually had two children, son John Hawley Olds La Gatta, and daughter Jeanne Mehit (ne LaGatta). As the La Gattas prepared to leave on a honeymoon, they learned that Amsden's business had failed and La Gatta's accumulated wages were gone. An assignment from N. W. Ayer advertising agency of Philadelphia brought La Gatta back to New York City. During this period, he did illustrations for Society Brand men's work clothes, Blue Buckle overalls, and General Motors. La Gatta was concerned that he was considered an illustrator of working men when he wanted to paint beautiful women. He resigned from N. W. Ayer and spent six months creating a portfolio of paintings of women using his wife as the model. Later career When he showed these to art directors, all the paintings sold and he was flooded with new commissions. Fellow illustrator Frederick R. Gruger, upon seeing La Gatta's images of women, said he painted, \\"chrome- plated women.\\"Illustration magazine, volume 13 issue number 52, 2016, \\"John La Gatta\\" by Daniel Zimmer, pg 12 La Gatta's advertising clients included Resinol soap, International Silver Company, Ajax Rubber Company, Laros Lingerie, Hoover vacuum cleaners, Paramount Pictures, Campbell's Soup, Ivory Soap, Kellogg's, Johnson & Johnson, Spaulding Swimwear, and Chase and Sanborn Coffee. He did work for many of America's most prominent magazines including Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan, Woman's Home Companion, Redbook, McCall's, and Harper's Bazaar. He eventually painted twenty-two Saturday Evening Post covers. According to a post on The Saturday Evening Post web site, \\"His art was a window into a world of cool elegance most readers would not otherwise be aware of.\\"Classic Art: John La Gatta, by Diana Denny, posted December 9, 2011, The Saturday Evening Post web site (http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2011/12/09/art-entertainment/elegant-art- john-lagatta.html) La Gatta jointed the Guild of Freelance Artists, its membership also included Norman Rockwell, Charles Dana Gibson and Neysa McMein. He was a member of the Society of Illustrators from 1922 to 1939. And was the interim president in 1927. Lavish lifestyle During the 1930s, when the average income was $2,000 to $4,000 a year, La Gatta earned over $100,000 a year. He had so many commissions, he frequently had to turn away work. Though the Depression he earned more than the President of the United States.The Saturday Evening Post web site, cover artists, John La Gatta (http://www.saturdayeveningpost.com/2015/01/21/art-entertainment/cover- artists-art-entertainment/john-lagatta.html) His images of sophisticated, upper-class men and women appeared in advertising into the 1940s and made him a sought-after illustrators. He lived a lavish lifestyle that mirrored the images he created. In addition to a studio in Manhattan, he bought a house in Sands Point, New York, on the north shore of Long Island, and a home in Woodstock, New York. To get from Long Island to Manhattan, the handsome and dapper artist bought a forty-five-foot yacht and drove custom-made Packard Phaeton. The La Gattas kept servants, belonged to prestigious clubs and traveled in style. During the Great Depression his paintings of glamorous, elegant women in rich, romanticized settings provided viewers an escape from reality. When the stock market crashed, LaGatta's assets were protected since he invested almost exclusively in real estate.Illustration magazine, volume 13 issue number 52, 2016, \\"John La Gatta\\" by Daniel Zimmer, pg 17 In 1937 John La Gatta appeared in the Jack Benny movie Artists & Models along with fellow illustrators McClelland Barclay and Arthur William Brown, and cartoonists Peter Arno and Rube Goldberg.IMDb web site, John La Gatta (https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0481163/bio) Illustration technique At the peak of his career in the 1930s, La Gatta could produce an illustration a day. W. Thornton \\"Pete\\" Martin, editor of The Saturday Evening Post, once commented, \\"I don't see how it is humanly possible for you to deliver six pictures at once and still keep the quality of your work at its stratospheric La Gatta high.\\"Illustration magazine, volume 13 issue number 52, 2016, \\"John La Gatta\\" by Daniel Zimmer, pg 19 He worked almost exclusively on illustration board, drawing with charcoal. He then sprayed the drawing with fixative and over-painted with thin oil paint which allowed the charcoal lines to show through. He often finished a painting by adding color using a palette knife to build texture. La Gatta carefully selected his models and worked directly from life when he could, eschewing photography. He was a frequent judge of the Miss America pageant and found models there, as well as from model agencies, the theater, and women he met. He favored brunette; but was known for using a brunette, a blond, and a redhead in the same illustration.National Museum of American Illustration web site, John La Gatta (http://www.americanillustation.org/project/john-lagatta/) Once he found a model who met his standards of beauty, he often painted her for years. La Gatta would often have three models posing for different illustrations at the same time. As one would rest, he moved on to another. Move to California By the 1940s, La Gatta's depictions of haute couture were no longer in demand. National magazines and advertisers began to use more photography. He rented out the Sands Point house and moved to Woodstock. Tiring of the cold winters, he decided to create a daily comic strip, Sally Forth, with California screenwriter Borden Chase. La Gatta moved his family to California in 1941. The strip was syndicated but La Gatta found it too time consuming and dropped the project. In California he continued his advertising commissions. He created illustrations for Woodbury Soap and Largos Silk Lingerie. However, the income was not enough and La Gatta sold his yacht and turned to portrait painting. He was plagued with health problems (he eventually has 17 stomach surgeries) and struggled financially. In 1956 Edward A. \\"Tink\\" Adams, the founder of what is now the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California, hired La Gatta as an instructor. La Gatta was a demanding but popular taskmaster and many of his pupils went on to careers in illustration; including Bob Peak, Bart Forbes, Mark English, Charles McVicker, and Don Shaeffer the head of the famous Charles E. Cooper Studio. Death and legacy Since the college was a State of California institution, there was a mandatory retirement age of 75. John La Gatta taught his last art class in 1968, and was awarded an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Fine Arts. He continued to paint for shows and galleries but found the art market was increasing dominated by abstract art. He died on January 21, 1977, in Santa Monica, California. His wife Florence died in 1992. In 1984 the Society of Illustrators posthumously inducted John La Gatta into its Illustrators Hall of Fame and in 2011 honored him as a Distinguished Educator in the Arts. La Gatta's son, John Hawley Olds La Gatta, graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and moved to New York City to start a financial career. In 1970 he founded Olds Securities Corporation (Olds was his mother's maiden name). He moved to San Francisco, California, in 1990, then to Reno, Nevada, in 1996; where he founded the non- profit Catamount Fund the following year. John H.O. La Gatta died in Reno in 2015.John H.O.

The law creates a new chapter in the Code of Internal Security aimed at regulating the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies, in particular those of the DGSI (domestic intelligence) and the DGSE (foreign intelligence). History The Intelligence Bill was introduced to the Parliament on 19 March 2015 by French Prime Minister Manuel Valls and presented as the government's reaction to the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Despite widespread mobilization, the Bill was adopted with 438 votes in favor, 86 against and 42 abstentions at the National Assembly and 252 for, 67 against and 26 abstentions at the Senate. It was made into law on 24 July 2015. Although framed by the government as a response to the Paris attacks of January 2015, the passage of the Intelligence Act was actually long in the making. The previous law providing a framework for the surveillance programs of French intelligence agencies was the Wiretapping Act of 1991, aimed at regulating telephone wiretaps. Many surveillance programs developed in the 2000s‚Äîespecially to monitor Internet communications‚Äîwere rolled out outside of any legal framework.Tr√©guer, F√©lix. \\"From Deep State Illegality to Law of the Land: The Case of Internet Surveillance in France,\\" April 2016. https://halshs.archives- ouvertes.fr/halshs-01306332/document. As early as 2008, the French government's White Paper of Defense and National Security stressed that \\"intelligence activities do not have the benefit of a clear and sufficient legal framework\\", and said that \\"legislative adjustments\\" were necessary. Main provisions This section summarizes the main provisions of the Intelligence Act.A rough translation of the Act is available at: https://wiki.laquadrature.net/French_Intelligence_Laws =Scope= Through article L. 811-3, the Act extended the number of objectives that can justify extrajudicial surveillance. These include: * national independence, territorial integrity and national defense; * major interests in foreign policy, implementation of European and international obligations of France and prevention of all forms of foreign interference; * major economic, industrial and scientific interests of France; * prevention of terrorism; * prevention of: a) attacks on the republican nature of institutions; b) actions towards continuation or reconstitution of groups disbanded (article L. 212-1 of criminal code); c) collective violence likely to cause serious harm to public peace; * prevention of organized crime and delinquency; * prevention of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These surveillance powers can also be used by law enforcement agencies that are not part of the official \\"intelligence community\\" and whose combined staff is well over 45,000. =Oversight= The existing oversight commission, the Commission nationale de contr√¥le des interceptions de s√©curit√©, was replaced by a new oversight body called the \\"National Oversight Commission for Intelligence-Gathering Techniques\\" (Commission nationale de contr√¥le des techniques de renseignement, or CNCTR). It is composed of: * four members of Parliament designated by the Presidents of both chambers of Parliament; * two administrative judges and two judicial judges designated respectively by the Council of State and the Cour de Cassation; * one technical expert designated by the telecom National Regulatory Authority (the addition of a commissioner with technical expertise was the main innovation). The CNCTR has 24 hours to issue its ex ante non- binding opinion regarding the surveillance authorizations delivered by the Prime Minister before surveillance begins, except in cases of \\"absolute emergency\\" where it is simply notified of the surveillance measure within 24 hours upon deliverance (article L. 821-3). For ex post oversight, the CNCTR has \\"permanent, comprehensive and direct access to records, logs, collected intelligence, transcripts and extractions\\" of collected data. It is able to conduct both planned and in the premises where these documents are centralized (article L. 833-2-2). If an irregularity is found, it can send to the Prime Minister a \\"recommendation\\" so that she can put an end to it. One hugely significant exception to the CNCTR's oversight powers are the bulk of data obtained through data-sharing with foreign intelligence agencies (article L. 833-2-3). =Wiretaps and access to metadata= Techniques of communications surveillance covered by the Act include telephone or Internet wiretaps (L. 852-1), access to identifying data and other metadata (L. 851-1), geotagging (L. 851-4) and computer network exploitation (L. 853-2), all of which are subject to authorization of a renewable duration of 4 months. =Black boxes and real-time access to metadata= The Act authorizes the use of scanning device (nicknamed \\"black boxes\\") to be installed on the infrastructures of telecom operators and hosting providers. Article L. 851-3 of the Code of Internal Security provides that, \\"for the sole purpose of preventing terrorism, automated processing techniques may be imposed on the networks of [telecom operators and hosting providers] in order to detect, according to selectors specified in the authorisation, communications that are likely to reveal a terrorist threat. Another provision limited to anti-terrorism allows for the real-time collection of metadata (article L. 851-3, for terrorism only and for a 4 months period). Initially, the provision targeted only individuals \\"identified as a [terrorist] threat\\". After the 2016 Nice Attack, it was extended by a Bill of the state of emergency to cover individuals \\"likely to be related to a threat\\" or who simply belong to \\"the entourage\\" of individuals \\"likely related to a threat\\". According to La Quadrature du Net, this means that the provision can now potentially cover \\"hundreds or even thousands of persons (...) rather than just the 11 700 individuals\\" reported to be on the French terrorism watchlist.La Quadrature du Net, \\"French State of Emergency: Overbidding Mass Surveillance\\", 21 July 2016. Available at: https://www.laquadrature.net/en/french-state-of-emergency-overbidding-mass- surveillance. =Computer Network Exploitation= The Act authorizes computer network exploitation, or computer hacking, as a method for intelligence gathering. Article L. 853-2 allows for: * access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data stored in a computer system; * access, collection, retention and transmission of computer data, as it is displayed on a user's computer screen, as it is entered by keystrokes, or as received and transmitted by audiovisual peripheral devices. Considering the intrusiveness of computer hacking, the law provides that these techniques are authorized for a duration of 30 days, and only \\"when intelligence cannot be collected by any other legally authorized mean.\\" The Act also grants blanket immunity to intelligence officers who carry on computer crimes into computer systems located abroad (article 323-8 of the Criminal Code). =International surveillance= The Act also provides chapter on the \\"surveillance of international communications\\", particularly relevant for the DGSE's surveillance programs. International communications are defined as \\"communications emitted from or received abroad\\" (article L. 854-1 and following). They can be intercepted and exploited in bulk on the French territory with reduced oversight. Safeguards in terms of bulk exploitation and data retention are lessened for foreigners (though the definition of foreigners is technical, i.e. people using non-French \\"technical identifiers\\"). =Data retention periods= For national surveillance measures, once communications data are collected by intelligence agencies, retention periods are the following: * Content (correspondances): 1 month after collection (for encrypted content, period starts after decryption, within the limit of 6 years after initial collection); * Metadata: 4 years (compared to a 3-year period before the adoption of the Act). For international surveillance, retention periods depend on whether one end of the communication uses a \\"technical identifiers traceable to the national territory\\" or not, in which case the \\"national\\" retention periods are applicable, but they start after the first exploitation and no later than six months after collection (article L. 854-8). If both ends of the communication are foreign, the following periods apply: * Content: 1 year after first exploitation, within the limit of 4 years after collection (for encrypted content, periods starts after decryption, within the limit of 8 years after collection); * Metadata: 6 years The law fails to provide any framework to limit staff access to collected intelligence once it is stored by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. =Redress mechanism= The Act reorganizes redress procedures against secret surveillance, establishing the possibility to introduce a legal challenge before the Council of State after having unsuccessfully thought redress before the CNCTR. Criticism and legal challenges During the Parliamentary debate, the bill faced severe criticism from several organizations including National Commission on Informatics and Liberty (CNIL), National Digital Council, Mediapart, La Quadrature du Net.http://www.laquadrature.net/en/press-release The implementation decrees of the French Intelligence Act are currently undergoing a series of legal challenges by French civil society organizations La Quadrature du Net, French Data Network and F√©d√©ration FFDN before the Council of State.La Quadrature du Net, 11 May 2016, \\"Legal Action against the French Surveillance Law\\".

The New Yorker has praised the \\"refreshing clarity and modesty\\" of his work. Early life Born and raised in Vermont, Atwood is a graduate of Harvard University, where he studied economics. He later earned an MPhil from Cambridge University. Atwood has lived in Paris, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and currently resides in New York City. Atwood worked several years as an advertising executive before turning full-time to commercial and fine art photography. As a photographer, Atwood is largely self-taught, developing many of his techniques through trial and error. According to Atwood, various cultural influences‚Äîincluding theater, painting, architecture, and psychology‚Äîhave informed his photographic style. Atwood is particularly known for combining and balancing the genres of portraiture and architectural photography, so that neither the subject nor his or her surroundings predominate in the final image. Memorable early portraits include astronaut Buzz Aldrin and actresses Hilary Swank and Julie Newmar. Atwood and his work have won many awards: in 2009 he was named Photographer of the Year at the Worldwide Photography Gala Awards, earning first place in the portraiture category. Kings in Their Castles Atwood was widely acclaimed for Kings in Their Castles (University of Wisconsin Press, 2005), a collection of 71 photographs which featured gay urban American men, mainly New Yorkers, photographed in their domestic environments. Atwood worked for four years on the project, relying on word-of-mouth among New York friends to help find compelling subjects and to convince prominent cultural figures to participate. \\"I like photos chock-full of visual information,\\" Atwood has said, adding that he prefers to capture individuals doing everyday activities and \\"in spaces that are built up over time, where everything has meaning to the person.\\" Subjects included the playwright Edward Albee, photographed in his New York City living room playing a miniature piano, filmmaker John Waters, photographed packing plastic food into a suitcase, fashion designer Todd Oldham in his Pennsylvania treehouse, and drag queen Mother Flawless Sabrina (Jack Doroshow) using duct tape to give herself a facelift. Artists Ross Bleckner, Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt and Tobi Wong, choreographer Tommy Tune, creative director Simon Doonan, composers David del Tredici and Ned Rorem, club DJ Junior Vasquez, director Joel Schumacher, drag queen Hedda Lettuce (Steven Polito), U.S. Representative Sean Patrick Maloney, and writers John Ashbery, Michael Cunningham, Richard Howard, Andrew Solomon and Edmund White also figure in the collection. Charles Kaiser contributed the book's introductory essay. \\"The art books I had seen about gay men were all nudes on the beach or romping through the forest,\\" Atwood told The Los Angeles Times. \\"I wanted this to be more about people as human beings, their idiosyncrasies, their daily lives.\\" Kings & Queens in Their Castles Atwood's forthcoming book, Kings & Queens in Their Castles, will be published in 2017 by art book publisher Damiani. Called \\"the most ambitious photo series ever\\" of LGBTQ subjects, the book expands on Atwood's earlier concept to include new portraits of some 160 lesbians and gay men, as well as members of the bisexual and transgender community, of whom about 60 are well-known figures. Lesser- known individuals include baristas, lawyers, and drag queens. Subjects were photographed in 30 different U.S. states.

Composed of the Venetian element pozzo- \\"well\\" and the Cimbrian element er- \\"from\\"/\\"of the\\". Derives from Fugazzer and Brandeller, being a mix of Venetian language and Cimbrian language. History The territories of Valli del Pasubio, as evidenced by the primary names in the oldest documents, were frequented and perhaps permanently inhabited by Romance language populations before the arrival of the Bavarians. Though the immigration of German settlers have begun around 1100 (the imperial vassals between the X and XII demanded that unsafe areas were colonized and protected), the oldest document certifying the residence of the German settlers is from 1216, for Trentino territory. A document from 1225 attests that Jacopo da Lizzana, a Trentino squire, assigns 12 farms in the territory of Vallarsa (near Valli) to German-born settlers. In 1279 we find the first settlement (25 farms) documented for Valli‚Äôs area. According to the documents, in 1400 the majority of the population speaks German. This is to say that the names and terms in German Cimbrian and Venetian language were often mixed, or used at the same time (this is the case of Brandeller, Fugazzer and Pozzer). The official use of surnames, was born in 1564 with the requirement for parish priests to keep a register of births. Dalla Pozza, Dal Pozzo, Pozzani, Pozzati were preexisting Venetian surnames and Pozzer derives from a Cimbrian version of a pre-existent Venetian surname, maybe Dal Pozzo.

The episode was written by series creators Jim Kouf and David Greenwalt, and was directed by Rob Bailey. Plot Opening quote: \\"Come back in the evening, I'll have the door locked to keep out the wild huntsmen.\\" After dinner in a restaurant, Monroe (Silas Weir Mitchell) shows Rosalee (Bree Turner) something in the clock: an engagement ring. He proposes to Rosalee and she accepts. Meanwhile, a police officer pursues a car in a chase and finally catches up with it but the driver is nowhere to be found and the officer is scalped by a creature. Monroe and Rosalee begin discussing telling Monroe's parents about their engagement, something which worries Monroe as he didn't tell them she is a Fuchsbau. Reception =Viewers= The episode was viewed by 5.88 million people, earning a 1.5/5 in the 18-49 rating demographics on the Nielson ratings scale, ranking second on its timeslot and fourth for the night in the 18-49 demographics, behind Bones, 20/20, and Shark Tank. This was a 2% increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 5.71 million viewers with a 1.5/5. This means that 1.5 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 5 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.

The A.V. Club's Kevin McFarland gave the episode a \\"B\\" grade and wrote, \\"Well, that certainly wasn't the kind of cliffhanger I was expecting heading into the Olympics hiatus. Grimm has used a playful, comedic title card immediately after a cliffhanger before. I remember at least one of the season finales doing the same thing. The gleefully shocked reaction on the title card ‚Äî 'OH %&$*,' basically ‚Äî suited the situation in the last 30 seconds of the episode, with Monroe's parents going full woge to attack Nick and Monroe trying to peacefully intervene. But that shift clashed dramatically with the lengthy and excruciating confrontation between Rosalee and Monroe's parents. Last week, Monrosalee visited the Fuchsbau side in supporting plot, but tonight, the couple is the main focus, leading to a few squeal-worthy moments and then one painfully overwrought climactic event.\\" Nick McHatton from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.0 star rating out of 5, stating: \\"As all good Grimm episodes are likely to do, Grimm Season 3 Episode 12 ended with the 'To be continued...' card. The biggest development was Monroe finally popping the question to Rosalee! It was quite adorable and imaginative - proposing with a cuckoo clock - and it fit Monroe's character so well.\\" MaryAnn Sleasman from TV.com, wrote, \\"For a season that has reveled in contrasting the Wesen world with the human world and the modern Wesen world with the traditional one, I'm delighted to bring one of our main couples into the forefront of that storyline. At the end of the day, I fall into Monroe's mindset, where it's really none of Mom and Dad's *&^%$#@! business, but in the meantime, exploring Wesen culture and family dynamics on such a personal level has the potential to be really great.\\" References External links Grimm (season 3) episodes 2014 American television episodes ","title":"The Wild Hunt (Grimm)"},{"id":"51444630","text":"Cheng I-ching (; born 15 February 1992) is a Taiwanese table tennis player.

On January 11, 2018, the season became available at Hulu. Plot Following Splinter's death and the Super Shredder's destruction at the hands of Leonardo, the Turtles, April O'Neil, Casey Jones and Karai have all moved on with their daily lives. Leo takes on even more responsibility as sensei. However, Tiger Claw and an underground cult dedicated to the Foot Clan have plans to bring back the Shredder, with the help of a Demodragon named Kavaxas. Raphael's Salamandrian girlfriend, Mona Lisa, and their friend, Sal Commander, arrive on Earth asking the Turtles for help finding the Newtralizer, who seeks to destroy the Utroms. It is later revealed that the Newtralizer is working with Lord Dregg, who has cheated death and sworn revenge on the Turtles. In another dimension inhabited by anthropomorphic animals in Feudal Japan, a lone rabbit ronin named Miyamoto Usagi has been tasked with protecting an unpleasant Pug named Kintaro, the \\"Golden Child\\" of the Sky Buddha. Meanwhile, the gray wolf wizard Jei transports the turtles into his reality to serve as mind-controlled hitmen, in order to prevent Usagi from ever reaching the Temple of the Sky Buddha. A flashback (prequel) shows how Splinter and the four Turtles, as babies, found their underground lair while being pursued by the Kraang. Splinter realizes he has been given a second chance at fatherhood, and names the infant Turtles after his favorite Italian artists of the Renaissance. In an alternate post-apocalyptic future (set half a century later), humanity and most of mutantkind (the Mighty Mutanimals, April O'Neil- who was somehow unable to shield herself from the blast with her strong psionic powers- Casey Jones, snake-mutant Karai, and Shinigami) have all been wiped out by an extremely powerful and destructive mutagen bomb triggered by an unknown adversary. An elderly, weathered version of Raphael and a robot containing Donatello's consciousness scour a wasteland that was once their home of New York City. They encounter a meerkat named Mira who is hunted by a honey badger named Verminator Rex and his gang of bikers. Mira reveals a map imprinted on her arm that leads to a haven called \\"the Green Paradise\\" or \\"Oasis\\". During Halloween, the Turtles and their time-traveling ally, Renet, are reunited with their enemy, Savanti Romero as he plans to turn all of New York City into a monster-filled dystopia, while sending them back in time at Transylvania, during the age of Dracula and 1810s Central Europe, with Frankenstein. In the series finale, the Turtles once again meet their counterparts from the 1987 series. The 1987 versions of the Shredder and Krang have fled to the 2012 reality and seek help from the 2012 versions of Bebop and Rocksteady as they plan to conquer both dimensions. The Mighty Mutanimals are later enlisted by the Turtles to help stop the villains. Production On July 10, 2015, Nickelodeon ordered a fifth season of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The first four episodes were released to DVD on March 21, 2017, two days after the TV-premiere. On March 2, 2017, Nickelodeon announced that season five would be the show's final season. It was renamed Tales of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles for this last season, and its opening titles were changed. \\"The Wasteland Warrior, \\"The Impossible Desert\\", and \\"Carmageddon!\\" are typically presented as a television movie, \\"Raphael: Mutant Apocalypse\\". Although these episodes were not the last to air, and not officially considered canon by Nickelodeon, they were the last episodes produced. In an interview, executive producer Ciro Nieli revealed that he intended for these episodes to be the series finale in order to prevent any alteration of the timeline that he and the rest of the crew had built, despite the episodes' contradictions to previously established canon (most notably Renet's description of the future from the Season 3 episode \\"Turtles in Time\\"). However, Nickelodeon chose to air those episodes on Nicktoons in the middle of the season, and declared \\"Wanted: Bebop and Rocksteady\\" the finale instead. On threads from the official TMNT twitter, the company indicated that \\"Raphael: Mutant Apocalypse\\" is non-canon, and a press release for the DVD refers to the special as \\"another dimension\\".

After a seemingly successful surgical abortion performed by Dr. John Hallowell, Grosvenor became sick. She died on September 14, 1742 in her hometown of Pomfret, Connecticut after surgical complications. Grosvenor's case has been argued as one of the most well known surgical abortion cases in colonial America. Early life and romantic relationship Sarah Grosvenor was the daughter of Mary and Leicester Grosvenor. Her family owned farmland, and her father held a high position within the local offices. Grosvenor developed a secret relationship at age 19 with 27-year-old Amasa Sessions. Both came from valued families within their village, indicating that had they married, their marriage would have been accepted by both families. Pregnancy and termination Grosvenor became pregnant from sex with Amasa. After coercion, she eventually began \\"taking the trade\\", an abortifacient, in an attempt to abort the fetus. Abortifacients were common in colonial America and were considered an acceptable method of aborting a fetus in the early stages of pregnancy. Only when quickening occurred did it become unacceptable for a mother to abort the fetus, as this was when both the court and the church identified a fetus as a living individual. Some argue that Grosvenor primarily attempted to abort the fetus due to Amasa's lack of interest in her as a potential bride. The abortifacient did not succeed, so Amasa enlisted Dr. John Hallowell to perform a surgical abortion. Two days later, Grosvenor had a miscarriage. Ten days after the operation, she became sick and died, most likely from infection due to the use of dirty tools in an unsanitary environment. Court hearing Three years after Grosvenor's death, her case was taken to court. Historians believe the incident came to the attention of the court after years of gossip and rumors. Zerviah and Sarah's friend Abigail Nightingale testified in court, recounting what Grosvenor had confessed to both of them separately from her death bed. The court identified her physician, John Hallowell, and her lover, Amasa Sessions, as responsible for her murder. The court charged the individuals for both putting Sarah into bad health and the attempted abortion, as it was done in an attempt to conceal her pregnancy. The court hearing ended in Amasa's innocence and the conviction of Hallowell with a misdemeanor. The court case did not acknowledge Grosvenor's abortion as murder of the fetus, even though Zerviah had testified that Grosvenor had felt the child move from within her. It has been understood by historians that Amasa was deemed innocent as he had lost his lover and had not performed the operation that resulted in her death.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2004. History Oak Hill Cemetery traces its roots to 12 August 1850, when the Evansville City Council appointed a committee to search for a new cemetery to replace the first public burying grounds located on the southeast edge of town at Mulberry and Fifth Streets. Within two years they selected a plot of land, then known as \\"Lost Hill,\\" which was 56-acres of undeveloped land about a mile and half from the then city limits. By February 1853 lots were offered for sale. By February 1853 lots were offered for sale and the cemetery saw its first burial, Ellen Johnson who died at age 2 on 18 February 1853, just 10 days after the City Council selected ‚ÄúOak Hill‚Äù as the site's official name. Burials from the city's previous cemetery. Later land purchases (up until 1924) gave the Cemetery its present acreage. The current appearance of the cemetery landscape ‚Äî particularly its plantings ‚Äî was primarily nurtured over an 80-year period (1853-1932) during the tenure of two superintendents. For the first four decades of the cemetery's existence (1853-1897), the beautification of the grounds was the responsibility of John S. Goodge. In his obituary (June 1897), he was credited with the \\"work of making the beautiful place the Oak Hill now is.\\" Some of the more mature plantings are very likely the result of Goodge's endeavors. His successor, William Halbrook (1898-1932), brought to his position his knowledge and experience gained as a florist, and a large portion of Oak Hill's verdancy was the result of his handiwork. Since 1932, some planting has occurred, but not on the scale of the preceding 80 years. Design and landscape The cemetery includes the French Renaissance style Administration Building (1899, 1917, 1999); Entry Gate (1901); and classical revival style Receiving Vault (1911) designed by Clifford Shopbell of Harris & Shopbell. The cemetery has a number of notable landscape features in keeping with the 19th century rural cemetery movement including a variety of tree species. Bordering the site on its western side is Highway 41; on other sides are low-scale, modern-era residential and commercial neighborhoods. In spite of this encroachment, the cemetery has preserved its original pastoral tranquility. The site selected for the cemetery was, according to a contemporary newspaper account, a ‚Äúhillock, a wilderness of underbrush and briars, and called at that with a mantle of loess, underlain by sandstone.\\" A 1927 topographical map showing the cemetery tract depicted the land of the original 1852 purchase as gradually ascending on the south from the floodplain level of 390 feet to a height of 430 feet. On the north end, there was a sharp drop-off. In profile, as viewed particularly from the east, the contour of the hill looked like the back of a two-humped Bactrian camel with a central Erosional vale. The early burials took place on the southern slope, close to the ridge. Today, interment sites not only blanket the entire prominence, but also cover the flat lands at the foot of the hill on three sides. Although the Cemetery comprises 175 acres, less than 120 have been platted and made available for interments. A tract of about 55 acres across the northern part of the Cemetery bordering Morgan Avenue has been farm- leased. An intricate tracery of crossing and curving pathways (now asphalted, one-lane drives) formed a lacy network which conjoined with the site's hill and vale topography and natural arborous properties created a picturesque setting for \\"the sleeping place of our dead,\\" as one 19th century journalist characterized Oak Hill. The collection of trees comprised native Indiana and American specimens as well as ornamental exotics. In addition to these distinctive plantings and walks, Oak Hill was enhanced by a number of other landscape features. The seclusion which characterizes this burial ground was furthered by the enclosure of its land on three sides by a brick wall and by a single entrance gate located on the south side of the Cemetery. The approach to the main gate was by a 365-foot-long drive which begun at Virginia Street and was bordered on each side by a continuation of the wall. The Mission Revival gateway was also designed by architects Harris and Shopbell in 1901. The overhanging hipped roof was clad with red barrel tiles, and the soffit was coffered. Extensions of the gateway are connected with the brick wall. Within the cemetery there were two man-made bodies of water‚Äîreflecting pools. To the left of the gateway, in the Western Addition, the central attraction was an oblong lake fed by the city water system and containing a small island. Spaced upon the banks of the lake were temple-style mausoleums of stone erected by some of the city's most prominent citizens. The island, connected to the mainland by a stone bridge, was the interment area for the Johnson family whose patriarch, Edward Mead Johnson, founded Johnson & Johnson and later Mead Johnson Nutrition Company, and whose remains were also interred on the island. The round, colonnaded monument of granite was erected for Johnson in 1934. The other pool, also fed artificially, was situated directly behind the administration building and was part of the improvement program undertaken in 1899 which saw the construction of this primary building. Notable interments The cemetery is now the resting place for countless notable Evansville residents, as well as an American Civil War burial ground with over 500 Union troops, 24 Confederate soldiers, and 94 civilians who died during Civil War conflicts. In 1868, the city began efforts to secure designation of the Union veterans‚Äô areas as federal property, eventually succeeding with a Congressional appropriation and recognition in 1898. Several years later, in about 1903, the Fitzhugh Lee Chapter of the Daughters of the Confederacy erected a monument in remembrance of the 24 soldiers who died for the South. A larger memorial for local Union dead was added in 1909. The 24 Confederate soldiers buried here were prisoners of war who died in Evansville. Records indicate the King and Queen of a tribe of Romany Gypsies are buried at the cemetery. Elizabeth Harrison, Queen of the Gypsies, died in November 1895 and her husband Isaac followed on Christmas Eve in 1900.

Built about 1810, it is a fine local example of a district schoolhouse. It was used as a school until 1926, and as a clubhouse for a time thereafter. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. Description and history The Spencer Hollow School stands in a rural area of eastern Springfield, on the west side of Spencer Hollow Road just south of its junction with Vermont Route 143. It is a small single- storye brick building with a gabled slate roof and a stone foundation. A small gabled wood-frame ell extends to the south to which is attached a shed-roofed extension housing a woodshed and privy. The street-facing front facade has two sash windows, while the building entrance, once on the south facade (in an opening now bricked over), is now in the ell. The interior of the ell houses a small kitchen area, while the main chamber retains original features, including an old blackboard and benches built into the walls. with The school was built about 1810-20, on land belonging to Simeon Spencer, an early settler of the area. Its construction date is uncertain, as a school (possibly also built of brick) may have been standing on the site as early as the 1780s. The building is probably the oldest surviving brick schoolhouse in the state; the Eureka Schoolhouse, built in 1785, is the state's oldest documented schoolhouse, but it is wood-framed, and has been moved from its original site (it is now a state historic site). This school remained in operation until 1926, and in 1931 it was taken over by the Spencer Hollow Club, which used it as a social venue, hosting dances and other events. By the early 2000s it had been abandoned and extensively vandalized. It has since undergone restoration.

The Hong Kong Baptist University honored Professor Fang with the President's Award for Outstanding Performance in Scholarly Work in 2001. Fang and Zhang's book Generalized multivariate analysis was honored as a \\"most excellent book in China\\"Loie describes the award as only \\"most excellent book\\", without the indefinite article \\"a\\", which here is inserted (in accordance with standard written English). by the Government Information and Publication Administration.  Biography  Fang's early life is described in by Agnes Loie in a volume published on his 65th birthday. Fang was born in 1940 in Taizhou in the province of Jiangsu in China. He graduated from Jiangsu's Yangzhou High School. = University studies and the Cultural Revolution = In 1957 he studied mathematics at Peking University, after which he entered the graduate program at the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Beijing. His doctoral supervisor was Pao-Lu Hsu, who suggested that Fang provide a multivariate generalization and correction of a univariate result, which had been given an incomplete proof in a Russian paper. With two weeks' work, Fang's submitted his extensions, which were declared by Hsu to suffice for his dissertation. Unfortunately, this paper remained unpublished for 19 years because the Cultural Revolution destroyed academic publishing in China.According to , Fang's thesis was published as (with details from zbMath): Fang reported that his studies were halted for the ten years of the Cultural Revolution, which lasted from 1966 to 1976. After graduating from Peking University, he undertook postgraduate studies at the Institute of Mathematics of Academia Sinica, which had less \\"political chaos\\" than Peking University, according to Fang. There, as a postgraduate researcher, Fang was supervised by Minyi Yue. In 1965, he was assigned to the Anshan Steel and Iron Company, where he gave lectures to engineers and worked on nonlinear regression, before being sent to a rural village to work as a laborer for the rest of 1965 and 1966. In 1972 Fang and other staff at the Academy of Sciences promoted the use of experimental design to improve Tsingtao Beer. = Revival of academic life = Fang was successively appointed to be Assistant Researcher and Assistant Professor in 1978. He then joined the Institute of Applied Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and he became Associate Professor in 1980 and Associate Director of the Institute in 1984. He was appointed Full Professor in 1986.  Multivariate analysis  Fang has contributed to the theory of elliptical distributions, like bivariate normal distribution (pictured), which have elliptical contours. In mathematical statistics, Fang has published textbooks and monographs in multivariate analysis. In particular, his books have extended classical multivariate analysis beyond the multivariate normal distribution to a generalized multivariate analysis using more general elliptical distributions, which have elliptically contoured distributions. His book on Generalized multivariate analysis (with Zhang) has extensive results on multivariate analysis for elliptical distributions, to which T. W. Anderson refers readers of his An introduction to multivariate statistical analysis (3rd ed., 2003).: The Fang and Zhang monograph used matrix differential calculus. One of Generalized multivariate analysis's innovations was its extensive use of the multilinear algebra, particularly of the Kronecker product and of vectorization, according to Kollo and von Rosen.: Fang and Zhang's Generalized multivariate analysis was honored as a \\"most excellent book in China\\" by the Government Information and Publication Administration.  Combinatorial design and experiments: uniform designs  Fang also has conducted research in the design of experiments. In 1972, he worked with the Tsingdao Beer factory and other factories. He and other mathematical statisticians at the Chinese Academy of Sciences promoted the industrial use of orthogonal designs. Orthogonal designs are discussed in the books and papers of Fang on \\"uniform designs\\" and also by other authors. Fang recognized that high-dimensional combinatorial designs, which had been used for numerical integration on the unit cube by Hua Luogeng and Wang Yuan, could be used to study interaction, for example, in factorial experiments and response surface methodology. Collaborating with Wang led to Fang's uniform designs, which have been used also in computer simulations.:  References    Further reading  A collection of tributes by T. W.

It is located centrally at the intersection of Via delle Terme and dei Termini, about two blocks Northwest of the Piazza del Campo. History The Piazza was only formalized in the 19th century with the addition of a tall loggia (1887) designed by Archimede Vestri. Behind the loggia is screened the medieval Palazzo Ballati with its tall crenelated tower. In number 15 Piazza Indipendenza is the Teatro dei Rozzi designed in 1816 by Alessandro Doveri and enlarged in 1874. The piazza itself was enlarged in the early 19th century by demolition of the church of San Pellegrino; hence it was previously called Piazza San Pellegrino. In 1875, a monument for the fallen in the wars of Italian Independence was commissioned by the Province of Siena from Tito Sarrochi to stand in front of the Loggia. The completed statue depicts an allegory of Italy as a woman holding a scepter in the left arm and a wreath in the right, about to lay the wreath upon a dying lion at its feet, with a crown strewn on the ground. The base of the statue states ‚ÄúAi prodi senesi per me caduti‚Äù and was inaugurated in 1879. The statue was contentious since its installation, in part because the dying lion was felt to be inauspicious for a nascent nation, or perhaps anti-royal or anti-Florentine inferences could be drawn from the elements of the fallen lion and crown. Ultimately, after extensive debate, the statue was moved to a small forlorn park in San Prospero between via Fruschelli and via Pannilunghi.

Duffy was created by Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin as one of the serial's ten original characters. Shipton received her audition just as she was thinking of giving up her acting career. She thought her chances of being cast were slim, as she had on bandages following a fall, however, producer Geraint Morris was fascinated by the incident and asked her about her time in the hospital. Shipton was initially considered for the role of receptionist Susie Mercier, before being cast as Duffy. She made her debut in the pilot episode of the first series, broadcast on 6 September 1986. Duffy is characterised as a \\"tough\\" and \\"carefree\\" nurse. She has a distinct style with her hair pinned up and wears neatly ironed uniforms. Shipton has stated that Duffy became more confident as the years progressed. The character has been used to portray various issue led stories. First, she became the victim of sexual assault, which caused her to lose her \\"happy go lucky\\" persona. Shipton later recalled that it was her most harrowing story. Next, she had an HIV scare following the break down of her relationship with Peter Tranter (Eric Deacon). In her later years on the show, Duffy battled depression and anxiety, and in 2018, producers created a story arc in which she is diagnosed with vascular dementia. Her stories have also been focused on her many relationship woes via her three marriages. The first with Registrar Andrew Bower (William Gaminara; Philip Bretherton), and the second with Ryan Johnson (Russell Boulter), a hospital security guard. Writers created her third marriage with Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson), following a \\"will they?, wont they?\\" relationship that spanned thirty years. Shipton has left and rejoined the cast of Casualty numerous times. The actress first chose to leave the serial in 1993 and Duffy left Holby to start a family with Andrew. She returned in 1998 and remained until 2002 when she departed with Ryan. She also returned in 2006 for two special episodes set in Cambodia. Shipton reprised the role in 2015 for the show's thirtieth anniversary and was soon tempted back on a permanent basis. The actress announced her departure from the series in October 2019, and Duffy made her final appearance on 1 February 2020. The character has been well received by television critics, with a reporter from The Daily Telegraph listing Duffy as one of the top ten best ever Casualty characters. Shipton received a nomination for Best Drama Star at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards. Casting Duffy is one of ten original characters conceived by the creators of Casualty Jeremy Brock and Paul Unwin. Cathy Shipton was working as an aerobics instructor and thinking of giving up her acting career when she received an audition for the show. The audition for the role was held on 11 January 1986. Not wanting to appear in her instructor's outfit, she borrowed some clothes and ran across London to get to the audition on time. Shipton had been teaching an aerobics class the day prior to the audition and fell over. She went to an accident and emergency department where they treated her for a sprained ankle and placed bandages on her. The actress was convinced that this would ruin her chances with casting directors. But Casualty producer Geraint Morris was fascinated by the incident and quizzed Shipton about her time at the hospital. She explained that an angry nurse had treated her and acted out part of the procedure. This intrigued Morris and his team of writers who decided to hire her.Kingsley 1995, p.74. She was surprised when she received the part of Duffy and it only sank in when she was being fitted for her costume. Shipton admitted that she was nervous during her first day on set and did not think her Bristol accent sounded right, likening it to \\"a demented Pam Ayres\\". She was later asked to tone down her accent, so it was easier for viewers to understand what she was saying. Shipton was originally considered for the role of Susie Mercier (later played by Debbie Roza), a character who filled the role of the emergency department's receptionist. Development =Characterisation= When Duffy was introduced into Casualty she was played as a \\"carefree\\" character with a \\"tough\\" and \\"determined\\" side. Writers gave her hobbies including dieting, astrology and gossiping. Duffy has a distinct appearance and style - her hair is tightly pinned up and she wears a neatly crisp ironed uniform. Shipton often carries her with a serious facial expression that \\"inspires confidence\\". The actress has stated that Duffy is a \\"real\\" middle-aged and \\"hard-working\\" mother who female viewers could relate to. Duffy does not always make the right life choices and viewers responded well to this. Shipton wanted Duffy to appear as authentic as possible. She always did her own suturing in scenes and this also made her feel like a nurse, which added to the realism on-screen.Kingsley 1995, p.76. In the first series the character was shown not taking her job seriously. She would gossip with Susie about her colleagues personal lives. She filled her time practicing for her driving test and trying out diets. She also protested against a local cinema showing adult films about nurses and succeeded at having them removed. But Duffy's behaviour was soon changed. Shipton felt that various incidents have transformed the character. She described Duffy in her early episodes as \\"a kidney bowl carrier, a blue flash, little more.\\" Following being sexually assaulted Duffy dropped her \\"cheeky girl\\" mentality and gained an \\"emotional life\\". Pregnancy made the character more determined and career driven. Shipton explained that Duffy \\"became a sister, there was another gear change. I think lots of women who juggle a job and bringing up a child identified with her. I had the chance to show that Nurses are professionals, not dogsbodies or angels or girls desperate to find a doctor to marry them.\\"Kingsley 1995, p.75. By 2006, Shipton viewed Duffy differently because of her life choices. She told Kris Green from Digital Spy that Duffy had moved on and made different choices. She appears a \\"lot lighter of spirit\\" which Shipton enjoyed playing. She added that \\"there's something quite vital and buzzy about her that you don't often see or haven't seen much of in the past.\\" Shipton believed that in the seventeenth series of Casualty her character had been given a \\"new-found confidence and lease of life.\\" She also develops a better sense of humour and \\"quality of survival\\". The actress explained that Duffy has the ability to \\"pick herself up\\" and move on, adding \\"she seems to live on the motto 'Hope springs eternal'\\". The nurse is also portrayed as \\"defensive in order to conceal her vulnerability\\" and can make rash decisions. =Sexual assault= One of Duffy's earliest storylines saw her attacked and raped. The storyline began playing out on-screen when Duffy, who lived alone in a flat, ventures out on her way to work on a dark night. When she travels down a back street she is set upon and raped. Duffy decides not to report the incident to the police and later regrets her decision. She struggles to deal with the attack and confides in Susie, Megan Roach (Brenda Fricker) and Ewart Plimmer (Bernard Gallagher) who all help her to recover. Duffy then finds another way to deal with the emotional trauma by helping patients who are admitted following sexual assaults.Kingsley 1995, p.72. Duffy is later faced with her attacker when he is admitted to the ward, but he dies shortly after. The effects of the assault changed the normally \\"chirpy, cheery\\" Duffy, and the viewers shared her pain as the story progressed over four years. Duffy eventually loses her \\"happy go lucky\\" persona because of the assault. After she finished shooting the scenes, Shipton took a two-week break to be with friends and she found herself wanting to stay inside and read. She admitted that getting into Duffy's mindset during the storyline was \\"quite difficult to deal with.\\" The story highlighted a problem in society of people not having anyone to confide in following such attacks. Shipton told a BBC reporter Alan Ayres that she had received numerous letters from viewers who had been in similar situations to Duffy. The actress was concerned and wrote back to some victims who had no one to speak to. She offered them information on the Rape Crisis Centre so they could receive help. In 2003, Shipton named Duffy's rape as her most harrowing storyline. =HIV scare= Duffy became the subject of an HIV scare when writers decided to explore the issue. They introduced the character's first love interest, a salesman named Peter Tranter (Eric Deacon). Their relationship progresses quickly and he asks her to move the United States with him. Peter then discovers that has contracted HIV and may have passed it on to Duffy. She gets tested and the results later come back negative. Peter moves away, becomes a recluse and Duffy later learns that he has died following complications with AIDS. Writers included a positive outcome for Duffy which began following a promotion to Staff Nurse which prompted her to research the virus. She then offers support to HIV positive patients because she understands their plight. =Relationship with Andrew Bower= In 1989, producers paired the character with Registrar Andrew Bower (William Gaminara; Philip Bretherton). Andrew was more concerned with his career than their relationship. In the book Casualty: The Inside Story, Hilary Kingsley noted that their relationship was one of convenience for Andrew. When Duffy discovers that she is pregnant, Andrew expects her to sacrifice her career to bring the child up. He refuses to do the same and they have a bitter separation, with him moving away. Duffy gives birth to a son named Peter and brings him up alone. She has to rely on babysitters who often let her down and she is forced to take Peter into work with her. Duffy's selfish mother Kate Duffin (Doreen Mantle) disapproves of her choice to remain at work. She initially refuses to care for Peter, but later changes her stance and helps out. Duffy meets businessmen Paul Slater (William Armstrong) and they begin dating. He helps out with childcare and Duffy moves in with him. But he develops a vendetta against the hospital and orders Duffy to quit her job. She responds by ending their relationship and moves out.Kingsley 1995, p.73. In 1992, following Duffy's cancer scare Andrew is reintroduced into the show. Duffy fears that Peter will need Andrew should she die and contacts him. She is shocked to learn that Andrew was already returning to Holby City hospital, taking a job as a locum Consultant. Writers made changes to Andrew's personality and he behaved more mature. Kingsley commented that the character was now \\"worthy\\" of Duffy's love. He was happy to see his son for the first time and remained in their lives. At the end of series seven Duffy and Andrew decide to give their relationship another try.Kingsley 1995, p.106. They later planned to marry and opted for a \\"quiet wedding\\". But the night before the ceremony a riot breaks out at the hospital and the department is set on fire. When the character returned to the show in 1998, she was still married to Andrew. Their marriage had become difficult and Duffy suspected that he was having an affair. She confides in Charlie that she thinks Andrew has become bored of their relationship and wants to move on. Andrew later gets a job at the hospital and he and Duffy work alongside each other. When Duffy finds out she is pregnant again, Andrew \\"reacts badly to the news\\". Duffy collapses after they argue, but Andrew eventually accepts that he is going to be a father again. However, in 2001 Andrew was killed-off when he is pushed down some stairs by Tom Harvey (Kieron Forsyth). Charlie has to inform a heavily pregnant Duffy that her husband is dead. =Departure (1993)= In 1991, Shipton went on holiday to the Maldives and realised she did not want to play the character forever. She decided that she would stay an additional year before announcing her intention to leave. In 1992, she heard rumours that the show would be airing twice a week and she began thinking about her future again. She decided to quit Casualty and filmed her final scenes in October 1993. The actress had already been pondering a departure because she wanted to play different roles. Shipton's departure left Thomson the last remaining original cast member. Shipton had difficulty looking at Thomson on her last day, as she kept crying. She told Inside Soap's Richard Arnold that she would be happy to return to the show for guest appearances. At the time she released a statement reading \\"Duffy won't meet a grisly end or anything like that, so she could always come back.\\" The character became pregnant with her second child before she left. Duffy made a \\"low key\\" departure from the show. After her husband is given a new job away from Holby, she decides to leave and start a family with him. =Return (1998)= In 1998, Shipton agreed to return to the role. The actress felt strange being back on the show because the cast and the show's humour had changed. She told author Rachel Silver that \\"I did feel a bit left out at first but I soon got back into the swing of it.\\"Silver 1998, p.102. Duffy returns to the hospital because \\"she loved it\\" and \\"knows she's good at it\\", she also has \\"enormous enthusiasm\\" to resume her career. She arrives to attend Charlie and Baz Hayes' (Julia Watson) wedding, as part of a two-episode special edition of Casualty. Alongside Shipton former cast members Brenda Fricker, Clive Mantle and Patrick Robinson all reprised their roles as Megan Roach, Mike Barratt and Martin Ashford respectively. The cast filmed on location for the episodes and Shipton told Steve Clark from Inside Soap that she had to learn all about the new characters and stories because she had avoided watching the show since her departure. Unlike the other returnees Duffy's return becomes permanent and she takes a job at the hospital as an F Grade nurse. She then finds it difficult to see Eve Montgomery (Barbara Marten) doing her old job. While off-screen Duffy had been raising her second child whilst Andrew had been working. But with him now at school, Duffy is free to return to work. She had done agency nursing to keep her skills up to date during her absence. Despite the temporary work Duffy soon realises she needs to work hard to be on par with her new colleagues. Towards the end of 1999, Duffy has an affair with consultant Max Gallagher (Robert Gwilym). Their relationship begins with them almost having sex on Max's desk, a scene that Shipton found embarrassing to film. She explained, \\"We had to do the whole smooching thing, the clinch and then I led him by the tie to the desk. The director kept saying, 'Can we have some noise', when we were kissing, which was funny. But you don't want to start laughing because it's better to get sexy scenes over with as soon as possible.\\" Shipton also made an appearance as Duffy in Casualty's sister show Holby City on 23 December 1999. In 2000, writers planned for Duffy to fall pregnant with Charlie's baby, before suffering a miscarriage. However, Shipton became pregnant in real life and the storyline had to be changed for one with a happier outcome. Duffy then fell pregnant with her husband Andrew's baby. =Relationship with Ryan Johnson and departure= Duffy developed a relationship with hospital security guard Ryan Johnson (Russell Boulter), after he provided her with sympathy over her mother's death. Boulter told Steve Hendry of the Sunday Mail, \\"Ryan's wife died of cancer, too, so they started off comforting each other and it all goes from there. And it goes very nicely, I have to say. I think the writers decided Duffy had had a bit of a rough ride and deserved a bit of fun ‚Äì so that's my job.\\" Shipton felt that the relationship had revitalised her character. She told a BBC reporter that \\"as a result she becomes quite glamorous and up-beat and it really is a new stage in her life.\\" Duffy is devastated when Ryan steals all of her money and disappears. He later returns and reveals that he has set up a new life for Duffy and her family in New Zealand. She is left with the dilemma of whether or not to trust him and emigrate. The actress told a reporter from Inside Soap that Duffy is unsure what to do. She explained \\"Duffy is furious with Ryan for leaving ‚Äì but she still loves him.\\" The story sparked debate on-set because some of Shipton's colleagues were in favour of her leaving with Ryan and some were not. In October 2002, it was announced that Shipton was leaving the role once again, with Ryan's return forming Duffy's departure storyline from the series. Shipton believed it was a good time to leave because \\"Duffy had great storylines\\" and it was \\"satisfying\\" that she leaves on \\"a high note\\". =Return (2006)= In 2006, Shipton agreed to reprise the role of Duffy for two episodes. Duffy's return was centric to two special episodes set in Cambodia, which were created to commemorate Casualty's twentieth anniversary. Shipton was hesitant to return because it meant being apart from her young daughter for a month. She considered taking her to Cambodia but felt it was too risky. Producers needed a quick decision from Shipton because the episodes were centric to Duffy. She told she told a Daily Mirror journalist that \\"the pressure was on because they needed to write the script around my character and I had to make a decision.\\" She conversed with cast members and decided to return, partly because Duffy would not be in a nurses uniform and she had become a different character in her absence. Shipton later told Kris Green from Digital Spy that she did not view her return as traditional return to the medical drama. She explained that the story \\"holds its own over two episodes and it's really exciting because Duffy's out in Cambodia idealistically setting up a free clinic for people living on the poverty line in a very impoverished country, so that's quite a challenge.\\" On-screen Duffy is in the country on a medical mission and Charlie, alongside his colleagues Comfort Jones (Martina Laird), Abs Denham (James Redmond) and Guppy Sandhu (Elyes Gabel), come out to help her. The cast and crew travelled to the country to film at various locations spots. They were forced to contend with high temperatures and rainy weather that became dangerous. Laird told Steve Hendry from the Sunday Mail that they worked in \\"extreme conditions\\" with sparse facilities. The high temperatures were problematic and the rainy season saw them caught up in a flood risk zone. Filming ceased and an evacuation took place. Shipton revealed that the crew needed to cram in as much filming during daylight hours as possible. This meant 4.30 AM starts and long days on set. Shipton told Green that the extreme heat \\"you feel like you were going to explode.\\" =Reintroduction (2015)= In 2015, Shipton reprised the role to help launch the thirtieth series of Casualty, opening with \\"tearjerking episodes\\". The actress was happy to return because one of the show's original creators, Paul Unwin was writing and directing the episodes. She felt proud to play Duffy again due to her \\"real and lasting connection with the public.\\" When she was in character wearing the hospital uniform, Shipton became emotional and felt that \\"it was as if time had stood still and within a couple of hours it was business as usual.\\" The scenes featured Charlie suffering a heart-attack and his colleagues coming together in an effort to save his life. Shipton later signed up to return to the role on a permanent basis and Duffy returned during the 1000th episode. The actress revealed that she had a positive response to her earlier return and it made a full-time return possible. Shipton said that the character had a \\"very exciting\\" future both \\"professionally and personally\\". Casualty's Executive Producer, Oliver Kent, said that he found it \\"completely thrilling\\" to have the character back. She believed that the show had regained its \\"dream team of Charlie and Duffy.\\" Upon her return Duffy reveals that she has left her life and family in New Zealand. She is working in an agency nurse new role within the obstetrics and gynaecology department. Shipton told Neela Debnath of the Daily Express that \\"she's got her own story going on, which is slightly complicated, as to why she's not in New Zealand.\\" Duffy forms a friendship with Consultant Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Shipton described it as \\"really interesting\\", as Elle is higher up the hierarchy than Duffy. However, when Elle struggles with treating a pregnant patient, Duffy is comfortable in her role as a midwife, and feels she can \\"speak her mind assertively. She's grown up and now on terra firma.\\" Shipton stated that Duffy and Elle's friendship was not initially written that way during development of her character, but the producers liked the pairing. She hoped it would be touched upon more in the future, as she thought it was a good idea to show strong female relationships. Shipton also confirmed that Duffy would continue her friendship with fellow nurse Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka), saying that as Duffy mentors her, they develop a \\"mother/daughter\\" relationship. =Relationship with Charlie Fairhead= Duffy and Charlie Fairhead (Derek Thompson) have shared a \\"will they?, wont they?\\" type of relationship spanning thirty years. Shipton told Elaine Reilly from What's on TV that they have \\"awful\\" timing because both characters already had a partner when a relationship between the two became a possibility. She noted that when Duffy became a single parent a relationship seemed likely, but Charlie married Baz. Then Charlie became jealous when Duffy had a relationship with Mike Hornsey (John Bowe). Shipton observed \\"lingering looks\\" and moments where a Duffy and Charlie romance almost \\"could-have-been\\". Despite these scenes, writers had never developed anything further between them. In 1992, Duffy neglects her health in favour of her career. She stops going for regular smear tests and Charlie becomes critical of her behaviour. Shipton explained that Duffy is \\"the bread winner\\" and single mother, so her health comes second. Charlie offers Duffy his advice but she is not impressed by his approach. Shipton said that it put their friendship into jeopardy because he is unsure of how to deal with the issue. She added that Charlie \\"says the kind of trite, nursey things that he trots out to patients everyday. But for Duffy that is no good.\\" That same year, Charlie and Duffy share a kiss under the mistletoe. She later turns to Charlie for comfort when the ED is set on fire ahead of her wedding, but she ultimately marries Andrew. In 2000, when Charlie suffered heart problems he relied on Duffy to help his recovery because his wife and son had moved away. When he returned to work he felt vulnerable and unsure of his future in nursing. Shipton told Allison Maund from Inside Soap that \\"there are moments that Charlie really needs to lean on Duffy.\\" At this point they had shared fifteen year friendship. Shipton believed that her own long-term friendship with Thompson contributed to the strength of the on- screen one. When their marriages both begin to fail, Charlie accepts that his is over. He urges Duffy to attempt to save her marriage to Andrew. The actress believed that Charlie made himself available to Duffy and the story always leaves them questioning a romantic relationship. Following the character reintroduction in 2016, writers finally had Duffy and Charlie acknowledge their feelings for one another with a kiss. Shipton quipped \\"Duffy and Charlie are behaving like teenagers, and they're actually really enjoying that.\\" They choose to keep their romance a secret from their colleagues, as Duffy is still married to Ryan. However, Duffy accidentally reveals that they are together during the staff Christmas party. Shipton pointed out that Duffy would not go and work in another country, if she was happy in her marriage. She also thought her character had empty nest syndrome and was looking for the next chapter of her life, which meant it was time to pursue a romance with Charlie. Duffy and Charlie's relationship is soon tested by the sudden arrival of Ryan, who has received divorce papers from Duffy. Ryan wants to fight for their marriage and he attempts to emotionally blackmail Duffy by bringing her youngest son Paul (Roly Botha) with him. Shipton told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Duffy is \\"guilt-tripped\\" into having a family Christmas, while Charlie is pressuring her to tell Ryan about their relationship. Things get worse for Duffy when Ryan is brought into the ED. He plays up his injuries and fakes a collapse to keep Duffy's attention on him. Duffy later agrees to go to dinner with Ryan, and Shipton assured fans that all Duffy wants to do is end her marriage. Ryan finally signs the divorce papers and Duffy returns to the hospital, where she proposes to Charlie. Shipton added that Duffy and Charlie had earned happiness. Duffy and Charlie's thirty year love story culminated in their wedding in early 2017. Shipton has some initial concerns about the development, saying \\"When something is unrequited, then you sort of keep it on the back-burner ‚Äì it's that whole, 'will-they-won't-they?' thing. That's the perennial tease! But as time has gone on, it's got to the point where it just feels right, and it feels really positive.\\" Shipton thought that viewers would not get the sense that the couple would be divorcing in the near future. On the day of the wedding, Duffy has to work due to a staff shortage, while Charlie is in Barry Island, where his stag do took place. As Duffy continues to make wedding preparations, she begins to worry when she has trouble contacting Charlie. Shipton explained to Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis that Duffy thinks that Charlie has had second thoughts about marrying her, having decided that he has been on his own for all this time, he does not want to change that. Duffy's colleagues throw her an impromptu hen do in the staffroom, before they go to the chapel to wait for Charlie. Duffy's maid of honour Robyn Miller (Amanda Henderson) assures her that Charlie will turn up, but Duffy is aware that Robyn was jilted by her fianc√© in the same place. Shipton said Duffy is left wondering if the same thing is going to happen to her. The actress added that the viewers had \\"as much trepidation\\" about the wedding as her character does, as they have seen other Casualty weddings go very wrong. Producers gave the couple a happy ending, as Charlie eventually turns up and he and Duffy are finally married. Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy described the scenes as \\"emotional\\" and assured fans that the couple would not be departing the show, after they were seen leaving for their honeymoon. =Depression and dementia= In late September 2018, Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy reported that the character would be the focus of a new mental health storyline that would also affect her marriage to Charlie. Duffy attends an appointment with her GP, who diagnoses her with clinical depression and anxiety, and prescribes her some anti-depressants. Shipton commented that Duffy is not sure about the GP's diagnosis and because of her stoic nature, she thinks she might be able to get herself through it. Duffy has a difficult shift at the hospital, where she gets involved in the treatment of Rachel Crowthers (Jennifer Hulman), whose father is Duffy's friend and childhood sweetheart Bill Crowthers (Clive Wood). As she continues to treat Rachel, Duffy gets in the way of her feud with her father, and as a result Duffy suffers a panic attack. Bill helps her out and she opens up to him about being diagnosed with depression. However, Duffy struggles to speak to Charlie and cannot find the right words to express what is happening to her. What's on TV's Elaine Reilly observed that Duffy had been \\"a lonely figure\\", and Shipton replied that Charlie's recent promotion has left him with more work, so he is spending less time with her and their family. Duffy does not want to worry Charlie with her diagnosis. Shipton said, \\"It may also be because they've gone beyond the honeymoon period of their marriage. They're not looking after each other as best they could because of the pressures of work.\\" Duffy meets up with Bill again and they have a one- night stand in a hotel. Duffy is \\"distraught\\" when she wakes up and tells Bill they have made a big mistake. After saying they should not see each other again, Duffy tries to leave the hotel, but ends up helping out when an accident occurs. She accompanies the patients to the hospital, where a \\"suspicious\\" Charlie is waiting. Shipton struggled to film the affair scenes and the aftermath, in which Duffy lies and keeps the truth from Charlie, calling it \\"grim, old stuff.\\" Shipton also said she had a \\"dual response\\" to the storyline, as she knew it would be good for her as an actor, but felt that it was a case of building the characters up \\"just to break them down\\". Duffy's secret is revealed when Bill is admitted to the hospital's ED. He tells Charlie about their night together, unaware that Charlie is Duffy's husband. Duffy is heartbroken when she realises that Bill has spoken to Charlie, as she has just made a decision to forget about it and work on her marriage. She is not sure how Charlie is going to react to the news. Speaking to Allison Jones of Inside Soap, Shipton stated that Duffy feels like her \\"whole world is falling apart\\". The character's next issue lead story focused on her diagnosis of vascular dementia. The story was planned months in advance and on-screen Duffy had been forgetting things long before her diagnosis. The production worked with the charity Dementia UK to ensure the illness was handled accurately and that they were sensitive to people affected by it. Producer Simon Harper said that stories like Duffy's need to be told \\"authentically and sensitively, which is why we are always so grateful to fantastic charities like Dementia UK who do incredible work and give us invaluable advice.\\" He added that he wanted to raise awareness of how cruel the disease can be. Harper also praised Shipton's portrayal, adding \\"Cathy is knocking it out of the park with her heartbreaking performance, she feels incredibly passionate about the story and feels a great sense of responsibility in telling it.\\" Katie Baillie from Metro reported that Duffy would feel alone through her diagnosis because of her break-up with Charlie. The story began to play out in December 2018, when Duffy has a fall and is taken into hospital. She plays down her symptoms and searches the internet for a self-diagnosis. She is shocked when her symptoms, including her depression, indicate that she is suffering from the early on-set of dementia. In March 2019 episodes, Duffy gets an official diagnosis and she is pressured to inform her employer about it. Duffy has to confide in Charlie because he is her line manager. He is upset by the news but takes a practical approach in dealing with the issue. He decides to release her from difficult duties including night shifts, which make her feel isolated. He also decides not to inform her colleagues of her illness. Duffy eventually decides to tell her colleagues about her diagnosis and she asks Charlie to let her resume her regular duties. During a shift, the father of Duffy's patient learns of her dementia and Charlie comes to her defence, which Duffy does not appreciate. However, it does lead to the couple reconciling and vowing to support each other. Duffy tells Charlie that she wants to be his wife again and face their problems together. Shipton commented that they \\"make their peace with each other\\". The couple, with help from David Hide (Jason Durr) and their other colleagues, renew their vows. Shipton called it a \\"spontaneous\\" moment. Duffy and Charlie go off to the place where Charlie realised he loved her, and they share a private moment together. Shipton explained that viewers were not happy that the writers split the couple up in the first place, but she thought that they had to test the characters. She also said that they had to get the couple back together now, as they would be facing a \\"bumpier ride\\" in the future. The actress added that viewers are invested in Duffy, so her dementia storyline would take a lot of time to play out, and hopefully show what people in real life are going through. She hoped the cast and crew were showing that if people receive a dementia diagnosis, they keep going and working. =Departure (2020)= On 9 October 2019, it was confirmed that Duffy would leave the series at the conclusion of her dementia storyline in 2020. Shipton filmed her final scenes that month. Executive producer Simon Harper thanked Shipton for her contribution to the show and \\"the British Television Drama landscape\\", and credited her with creating \\"a comforting Saturday night icon, the caring, ideal NHS nurse millions grew up with\\". Shipton expressed her delight at portraying the character and added, \\"with sadness, but a sense of completion, I say goodbye\\". As Duffy's dementia storyline progresses, she moves into a residential care home, as Charlie struggles to look after her and deal with her increasing violent behaviour. A show spokesperson told Inside Soap's Sarah Ellis that it is the last thing the couple wants, as Duffy worked in a home and did not like the conditions. She told Charlie that she never wanted to be admitted to a place like that, so he feels guilty leaving her there. Duffy's final episode was broadcast on 1 February 2020. A \\"disorientated\\" Duffy leaves her home in the middle of the night and tries to help an unconscious woman, however, recent snowfall and cold weather leaves her with hypothermia. Reception Shipton was nominated for Best Drama Star at the 2017 Inside Soap Awards, while Charlie and Duffy's wedding was nominated for Best Drama Storyline. The following year, Duffy and Charlie were nominated for Best Soap Couple at the Digital Spy Reader Awards. In 2020, Shipton was nominated for Best Drama Star at the Inside Soap Awards. A reporter for The Daily Telegraph named Duffy as one of the 10 best Casualty characters. They said, \\"Reliable, super-efficient Duffy (Cathy Shipton) featured in the original cast when the medical drama launched in 1986 and is one of Casualty's most iconic and longest-serving characters\\". Shaun Kitchener of the Daily Express named Duffy as one of Casualty's \\"most iconic characters\\". He also reported how viewers had expressed their happiness over Duffy's return in 2016. Sharon Marshall writing for the Daily Mirror praised Shipton, Thompson and Bleasdale's \\"sterling performance\\" during the 30th anniversary episode. She added that one particular scene with all three made her cry, adding that it was like \\"saluting our NHS heroes\\". Sean Marland of What's on TV compared Duffy and Charlie's long-running \\"Will they? Won‚Äôt they?\\" relationship to the one between Ross Geller and Rachel Green, two characters from the US sitcom Friends. Their colleague Elaine Reilly added that she was hoping for romance between \\"Chuffy\\" because it had been \\"building for decades\\". Alison Graham of the Radio Times commented, \\"The pair have been secretly in love for 30 years, the whole of Casualty's lifetime, so surely they need just to get on with it.\\" Sarah Moolla of The People criticised the character, saying \\"Has no home, no job, no money and no pride after being conned by the good-looking, smooth-talking Ryan she'd known for just a few months. A Casualty of love or her own stupidity? Duffy's definitely a divvy.\\" A What's on TV reporter said that following her affair with Bill, Duffy \\"has fallen from grace in the eyes of many Casualty viewers.\\" Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy praised the decision to have Duffy and Charlie at the forefront of storylines in 2019. She found that Duffy's dementia storyline had \\"a slower, more frustrating, build-up, but has continuously tugged at our heartstrings all the same.\\" She also thought Shipton finally had the right story arc to show off her acting skills for the first time since Duffy's reintroduction.

AIDS memorabilia that later would be, after its founding, displayed in the World AIDS Museum and Educational Center were first exhibited here. In 2015, Pride Center Florida generated more than $2 million in annual revenues, primarily from grants and government contracts of $1.2 million and $527,000 in annual members' dues and contributions. Net assets exceeded $6.2 million, including property and equipment valued at more than $5.3 million. Programs are supported by a diverse group of local and national sponsors, such as Wells Fargo, JetBlue, Whole Foods, Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Ketel One, Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention and Visitors Bureau, and AHF AIDS Healthcare Foundation. SAGE, the country's largest and oldest organization dedicated to improving the lives of LGBT older adults, is one of the center's most popular programs, including 398 active members with 175 LGBT seniors attending weekly get-togethers. In August 2016, SAGE estimated there are 43,000 LGBT older adults in Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. The agency organizes an annual Tropical Plant Fair each spring, including several dozen vendor booths. Alan Schubert The Pride Center grew out of the initial vision of founder Alan Schubert, one of the earliest public leaders of Fort Lauderdale's gay and lesbian community. Schubert died of cancer on June 1, 2016. He was 70 years old. Schubert's legacy includes the Pride Center where the main building bears his name and a long history of financial support and bringing community resources together on behalf of causes that included the Broward Gay and Lesbian Youth Group, the Child Care Connection, the Jewish AIDS Network, Broward Public Library, Human Rights Campaign, Center One and Tuesday's Angels. Upon his death, The Pride Center said: Housing for LGBT Seniors In August 2016, a partnership between the Pride Center and Carrfour Supportive Housing secured financing to develop, build and operate South Florida's first supportive housing community that will significantly serve gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender seniors. Carrfour's competitive application for tax credits won funding from Florida Housing Finance Corporation for housing credit and gap financing for affordable housing developments for persons with a disabling condition, providing the financing needed to begin construction of The Residences at Equality Park as an initial 48-unit apartment complex on the Pride Center's campus at North Dixie Highway and Northeast 20th Drive in Wilton Manors, Florida. The effort to create affordable, supportive housing in Wilton Manors began in 2012 when City Commissioner Tom Green proposed development of affordable housing for the community's primarily LGBT seniors. Three years later, the proposal won unanimous support from the City Commission to create12,346 square feet of retail space and 130 affordable housing units within The Pride Center's five-acre campus. \\\\- Pride Center Florida Official Website. Pride Center formally partnered with Carrfour to pursue funding, develop and operate the housing complex. Public Outreach Since 2010, Pride Center Florida has published a quarterly newsletter, known as the Pride Center Voice. The newsletter is distributed in print and electronically. The organization also maintains an active social media presence, including on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

He played college football at Ohio State, where he won the Rimington Trophy as a senior in 2016. Elflein was drafted by the Vikings in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft. Early years Born in Pickerington, a suburb of Columbus, Ohio, Elflein attended Pickerington High School North. A four-year football letterman and a two-time football team captain, Elflein earned 12 letters in his high school career, four each in the sports of football, wrestling and track and field. He was named in football to All-Ohio Capital Conference, All-Central District and to the Dispatch's All-Metro teams. He was the 2011 wrestler of the year in the OCC as he qualified for both the state and national tournament. Elflein also excelled on the track and field team; as an eighth grader, he won a division title in the shot put, and his best throw was 50'11\\" (15.52 meters). Ranked as the No. 22 guard prospect in the nation by ESPN and No. 31 by Scout.com, Elflein didn't wrestle with his decision about which school to attend once he received a scholarship offer from the Ohio State University, committing on July 14, 2011. As a result, the Buckeyes' recruiting class secured two of the 2011 Associated Press (AP) first-team Division I all-state offensive linemen in Elflein and Jacoby Boren (from cross-town school Pickerington High School Central). College career Elflein redshirted his first year at Ohio State in 2012 due to a foot injury. Elflein was one of only two starters returning in 2015 and served as a captain for the 2016 season, his senior season in which he won the Rimington Trophy and was a finalist for the Outland Trophy. He graduated with a communications degree and finished his career as a graduate student, and prior to receiving his degree, he earned three OSU Scholar-Athlete awards and one Academic All-Big Ten Conference honor. He was a first-team All-Big Ten in each of his final three seasons. =Freshman season (2013)= As a redshirt freshman in 2013, Elflein earned his first varsity letter playing in all 14 games as a reserve offensive lineman when Corey Linsley was the Buckeyes‚Äô senior center. On September 21, he played 57 snaps on offense in the Buckeyes' overwhelming win over Florida A&M; and then had several series worth of offensive snaps against Penn State and Purdue before being called in to play three quarters against Michigan in week 12. His play against the Wolverines in the one-point win earned him the start in the Big Ten championship game against Michigan State. =Sophomore season (2014)= Elflein earned the first of his three first-team All-Big Ten seasons as a sophomore, starting all 15 games including the 2015 College Football Playoff National Championship. He opened the season at left guard and started the first three games there, but moved to right guard for the final 12 games, helping lead the Buckeyes to a Top 10 national ranking in rushing with just over 264 yards per game as he and his offensive line teammates paved the way for Ezekiel Elliott to become the first running back in school history to rush for 200 yards in consecutive games. The offense was outstanding all around, with school records for touchdowns (90), points scored (637), passing yards (3,707) and passing touchdowns (42) as well. =Junior season (2015)= In his junior campaign, Elflein started all 13 games at the right guard spot for a Buckeye squad that finished 12-1 and capped their season with a 44‚Äì28 win over Notre Dame in the Fiesta Bowl. He received second-team All-American status by the Associated Press (AP) and Sports Illustrated for his dominant play. He was also named first-team All-Big Ten Conference for the second consecutive year by the league's head coaches and also by the media as he helped pave the way for Ohio State to lead the Big Ten in rushing at 245.2 yards per game and finish second in the conference in scoring and third in total offense. =Senior season (2016)= Prior to his senior year in 2016, Elflein handled a position switch, moving from guard to the center position as a fifth-year senior, with aplomb, starting all 13 games for the Buckeyes. He ended up garnering the Rimington Trophy as the nation's top center and helping Ohio State make the College Football Playoff semifinals. Elflein also was one of three finalists for the Outland Trophy and won the Pace Big Ten Offensive Linemen of the Year. Elflein was named the Rimington‚ÄìPace Offensive Lineman of the Year and was a First Team All-Big Ten selection in 2016. Along with Malik Hooker, they became the first pair of Buckeye teammates to be named consensus All-Americans in the same year since Orlando Pace and Eddie George back in 1995. Professional career Prior to his senior season, Elflein was regarded as one of the best guards in the country and a likely first-round selection. Following his senior season, in which he had transitioned to center, an NFC West scout declared to NFL.com: \\"In Elflein, you are getting a guy who will be great for your locker room and will get the rest of the offensive line on board. I think he could have the same fast impact on a team's running game that Zach Martin had with the Dallas Cowboys. Safe draft pick to me.\\" During the pre-draft evaluations, Elflein was widely viewed as the best center in the class and was often compared to Corey Linsley, who was Elflein's teammate at Ohio State, and Cowboys' Pro Bowl center Travis Frederick. Elflein was drafted by the Minnesota Vikings with the 70th overall pick in the third round of the 2017 NFL Draft. The Vikings traded up for the second time on Friday night, sending No. 79 and a fifth-round pick to the New York Jets in order to acquire the 70th overall selection. The day after the Draft, the Vikings announced Elflein will wear No. 65, the same number he wore at Ohio State. Elflein entered his rookie season as the Vikings starting center, starting 14 games and missing two due to a shoulder injury. Following an impressive rookie season, he was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. After undergoing shoulder and ankle surgeries, Elflein missed the first three games of the 2018 season. He returned to the starting lineup in Week 4 at center, and remained there the rest of the season. In 2019, Elflein was moved to left guard after the Vikings drafted Garrett Bradbury in the first round of the 2019 draft to play center. In 2020, Elflein was moved over to right guard. He suffered a thumb injury in practice and was placed on injured reserve on September 17, 2020.

Early and personal life Ariel was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. His father, the son of a rabbi, was born in Poland in 1904, and made aliyah (moved to Israel, then known as Palestine) in 1922, and ultimately became a hotel manager and then head of customs at the Jaffa port, as well as a member of the Stern Gang. His mother worked as the secretary to the Mayor of Tel Aviv. His parents divorced when he was ten years old. At the age of 11, he moved to a kibbutz. He served three years in the Israel Defense Forces. He studied at the Wingate Institute in Israel, and later attended the University of Wyoming on an athletic scholarship, beginning in 1963 and graduating in 1966. Ariel obtained a master's degree from the University of Massachusetts Amherst in Exercise Science. He completed his graduate and post-doctoral work at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he received a Ph.D. in Exercise and Computer Science. Ariel and his former wife Yael Tzabar had a child, Geffen Olympia. He lived in Amherst, Massachusetts and Coto de Caza, California. He has three more daughters: Tova, Nomi, and Ilana Ariel.  Discus and shot put  Gideon Ariel bearing the Israeli flagWhen Ariel competed in the Olympics, he was 6 ft (184 cm) tall, and weighed 220 lbs (100 kg). Ariel competed for Israel at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, at the age of 21, in the Men's Shot Put, and came in 22nd with a distance of 14.65 meters. He was also the flag bearer for Israel at the 1960 Olympics. Ariel competed for Israel at the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, at the age of 25, in the Men's Discus Throw, and came in 26th with a distance of 46.12 meters. He was again the flag bearer for Israel at the 1964 Olympics. His personal best in the discus throw was 55.22 meters, in 1964. Ariel's personal best in the shot put was 16.27 meters, in 1966.  Scientific career  = Anabolic steroids = Ariel performed research in the use of anabolic steroids, technically known as anabolic-androgen steroids (AAS) or colloquially as \\"steroids\\" (or even \\"roids\\"), which are drugs that mimic the effects of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone in the body. Uses of anabolic steroids in sports are controversial because of their adverse effects and the potential to gain an advantage conventionally considered \\"cheating.\\" = Biomechanical performance optimization = Gideon Ariel at the Mexico Olympics 1968Ariel developed a business of biomechanical services, ranging from physical rehabilitation to personalized athletic instruction, working with athletes including Olympic champion discus thrower Al Oerter‚Äîwho after working with Ariel, at age 43 threw a discus 27 feet farther than his best gold medal performance. Another of those athletes was Mac Wilkins. In 1975, the USOC had gathered 12 of America's best discus throwers to be filmed in action with high speed cameras. The footage was sent to Ariel's laboratory where he conducted his analysis on their performances. Wilkins commented on Ariel's assessment of his technique: \\"He pointed out that my front leg was absorbing energy that could go into the throw. I had to begin to change my whole conception of throwing I used to think I had to put as much of my speed in the direction of the throw.\\" Ariel's analysis had shown that Mac was generating speeds up to 30 percent faster in one segment of the throw than anyone else, but it was dissipating it at the end. According to Ariel, the computer \\"found that with a perfectly timed summation of his forces, Wilkins could throw the discus 250 feet.\\" After implementing Gideon's advice, Mac Wilkins went on to break the world record and win the Olympic gold medal at the 1976 games in Montreal, Canada. He founded the Olympic Training Center in Squaw Valley and Colorado Springs and became chairman of the U.S. Olympic Biomechanical Committee. In San Diego, he founded Ariel Dynamics to apply biomechanical concepts to sports performance.  Patents and inventions  = Variable resistance exercising device = Variable resistance exercising device, 1976An improved exercising device for exercising the legs of a user includes a frame member with a lever arm having one end pivotably attached thereto. The lever arm extends downwardly from the portion of the frame member to which it is pivotably connected, and a pair of foot-engaging force transferring members are mounted on the lower end of the lever arm. A cable has one end pivotably connected near the lower end of the lever arm, passes around an eccentrically mounted pulley and has its other end connected to weights. As the user lifts the lower portions of his legs, the lever arm is pivoted to pull the cable and the weights attached thereto, thereby strengthening the knee muscles of the user. The eccentrically mounted pulley varies the resistance to movement of the user's lower legs initially increasing the resistance and then decreasing the resistance in a sinusoidal manner as the lower legs are lifted to pivot the lever arm and lift the weights. Patent US 4256302 A, 1981. = Exerciser = An exerciser bar is supported for rotation and acts against an hydraulic cylinder with the angle of the bar and the pressure in the cylinder measured and fed to a micro computer which, using this input data, controls the cylinder pressure in accordance with a selected exercise program, the micro computer also providing outputs to displays so that the person exercising can monitor his progress. Patent US 4354676 A, 1982. = Passive programmable resistance device = Passive programmable resistance device, 1985A passive programmable resistance device uses a closed loop feedback for controlling resistance to rotational or translational motion of an object. One or more actual parameters, such as force or position, are measured and compared with desired parameters. The differences are used to provide a control signal which controls the resistance to the movement of the object. Patent US 4544154 A, 1985. = Related patents = * Exerciser.

Schuster was instrumental in the creation of Pocket Books, and the mass paperback industry, along with Richard L. Simon, Robert F. DeGraff and Leon Shimkin. Schuster published many famous works of history and philosophy including the Story of Civilization series of books by Will Durant and Ariel Durant. Biography =Early life= Schuster was born to a Jewish familyTimes of Israel: \\"The Good Old Days Of The Future Of Publishing\\" by Susan Reimer December 16, 2012 on March 2, 1897 in Ka≈Çusz, then Austria- Hungary, today Ukraine. His parents, Barnet and Esther Stieglitz Schuster, were American citizens and brought Schuster to America at age six weeks. Barnet Schuster ran a stationery and cigar store in Washington Heights, and it was there that Max attended DeWitt Clinton High School. While in high school, Max Schuster adopted \\"Lincoln\\" as his middle name to honor his interest in President Abraham Lincoln. Schuster entered college at age 16, and attended the Pulitzer Graduate School of Journalism at Columbia University and received a degree in 1917. =Early career= Schuster's first job in publishing was as a copy boy for the New York Evening World in 1913. During his time at Columbia University, he was a correspondent for the Boston Evening Transcript, the United Press and he also contributed to various magazines. He later became a member of the United Press Washington staff. During World War I, Schuster was the chief of publicity for the Bureau of War Risk Insurance at the Treasury Department and an aide to Admiral T. J. Cowle, paymaster general of the Navy. His job was to write pamphlets to support the country's war bond drive. = Simon & Schuster = Schuster co-founded Simon & Schuster in 1921 and over the years served as President, Editor-in-Chief, and Chairman of the Board. Schuster met Richard L. Simon in 1921 while Schuster was editing a trade magazine and Simon was a piano salesman but would soon join publisher Boni & Liveright as a salesman. They founded Simon & Schuster together in 1924 with an investment of $3,000 each. At the time, crossword puzzles were popular in newspapers, and Simon's aunt suggested that they publish a book of them so she could have more to work on. They took her advice, opened up an office in Manhattan (at 37 West Fifty-Seventh Street) with two desks facing each other, and hired Margaret Farrar to compile The First Cross Word Puzzle BookThe Crossword Obsession, by Coral Amende, published 2001 by Berkeley Publishing with a print run of 3,600 copies. They advertised the book in newspapers right next to the newspaper's crossword puzzle ‚Äî although, since they were uncertain as to the book's success, they credited it to \\"Plaza Publishing\\" so as to not be associated with a potential failure. Within three months, they had sold more than 100,000 copies. By 1925, they had sold over one million books and had made appearances on the Publishers Weekly's bestseller list. Schuster had a liking for both academic subjects and populist subject-matter. He championed works of philosophy, history and great literature. Schuster was responsible for the publication of the Will and Ariel Durant series on the Story of Civilization. Schuster discovered Durant's work in a series of pamphlets called Little Blue Books published by Haldeman-Julius and sold for ten cents a copy. He convinced Durant to write the Story of Philosophy which became a bestseller in 1927. This relationship turned into a 50-year undertaking by Will and his wife Ariel to write the Story of Civilization. Schuster also edited A Treasury of the World's Great Letters, From Ancient Times to Our Own Time. Schuster began collecting and copying letters after reading Beethoven's letters to his \\"immortal beloved.\\" His background in journalism also gave Schuster what biographer Al Silverman described as a \\"populist bent.\\" In the New York Herald, reviewer Lewis Gannet wrote, \\"You have been, you are, you always will be, a newspaperman in the book publishing business.\\" In his memoir, Another Life: A Memoir of Other People, Michael Korda described how Max Schuster worked. Korda said that Schuster rose early every morning and breakfasted at the Oak Room of the Plaza Hotel, where he would clip articles from the morning newspapers looking for ideas for books. Schuster's style impacted both the style and look for Simon & Schuster. Schuster's prose, Korda wrote, \\"was unmistakable and over the years became the S&S; house style, a heady, oracular mash of superlatives, puns, and one-liners that most people at S&S; could write by the yard but that only Max actually spoke.\\" Korda also described how Schuster, \\"understood, as very few people in publishing have, the power of simple ideas. Nobody was better at inventing books that filled a need, or at describing them with the kind of enthusiasm that sold them in quantity, or at breaking down the reasons for buying them into one-line sentences.\\" Schuster showcased his prose by writing (with Simon) an advertising column called the Inner Sanctum. Schuster also chose Jean-Fran√ßois Millet's the Sower to be the logo for Simon & Schuster as a representation of disseminating knowledge. Schuster was described by Al Silverman as someone who wore thick glasses, severe clothes and \\"tended to be uncomfortable in the presence of the other people.\\" In 1966, Schuster retired and sold his interest in Simon & Schuster to Leon Shimkin for around $2 million. As part of an agreement, Schuster was excluded from publishing for two years. At the end of the two years, Schuster formed an editorial partnership with his wife, Ray Schuster, but Schuster died within four years of retirement. Personal life Schuster was married to Ray Haskell who had three daughters from a previous marriage. Services were held at Temple Emanu-El in Manhattan.

Attributed to Ogata Kenzan (1663-1743), Edo period, c. 1725 is a type of Japanese pottery traditionally from Kyoto. It is therefore also known as Kyoto ware.  History  Pottery in Kyoto dates back to the late 5th century. In the 17th century, Nonomura Ninsei set up a kiln opposite the Ninna-ji. He established a specific style of Ky≈ç ware. Clay that was suitable for the production of porcelain was not easily available in the region. The potters of Kyoto therefore had to concentrate on developing elegant forms and originality. In the 17th century, Ky≈ç ware and Japanese tea ceremony had a close relationship. The use of China instead of earthenware became more popular. In 1771 Kiyomizu Rokubei I opened his own studio in the Goj≈çzaka district of Kyoto, near Kiyomizu-dera. The Goj≈çzaka district near Kiyomizu has a large Chinaware market with around 400 shops, which makes it one of the largest in Japan. Every summer a large market is held which sells Ky≈ç ware. A contemporary artist is Nanzan Ito.  Characteristics  The term Ky≈ç ware is more of an umbrella term to describe a wide variety of styles that were produced in Kyoto. One of the more known styles is the one with distinctive design and flamboyant colouring. The pigments contain large amounts of glass. The colours are vivid and seem transparent. Not a wide range of colours are used for one vessel, but the aim is to use the right one to suit the design. The pieces are then fired in the kiln at a low temperature. There is one kind of Ky≈ç ware which is very delicate and fine and less than a millimetre thick, which makes it translucent against light. Kiyomizu ware is a subcategory and refers to products traditionally made in the direct vicinity of Kiyomizu temple. Rengetsu ware in contrast has a very rustic look, is however also considered a subcategory of Ky≈ç ware.

It stars Isabelle Huppert and Jean-Louis Trintignant, who had also played daughter and father in Haneke's 2012 film Amour. It was selected to compete for the Palme d'Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. It was released in the United States on 22 December 2017 by Sony Pictures Classics. It was selected as the Austrian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Huppert and Trintignant were nominated for European Film Awards for Best Actress and Best Actor respectively. Synopsis The film starts with clips secretly filmed with a smartphone by Eve Laurent, a teenager, showing her mother and overlaid with text messages from Eve saying that her mother is selfish and uncaring. The last clip shows Eve's mother unconscious and Eve admitting that she poisoned her with sedatives. The next scene shows security camera video depicting an accident at a construction site. The site's construction firm is owned by Anne Laurent, Eve's aunt. Anne is then shown having dinner with her father, Georges Laurent, who suffers from dementia, as well as her son Pierre, who works for the construction company and has a drinking problem, her brother, Thomas Laurent, who is a surgeon, and his wife Ana√Øs. They all live together in a large mansion in Calais. We learn that the accident injured one of the construction workers and he will probably not survive his injuries. Eve comes to live with her father's family while her mother is in the hospital, and begins to have suspicions that her father is having an affair. One day at the beach she overhears Thomas talking on his cellphone to a woman, and she asks him if he still loves Ana√Øs. Pierre goes to an apartment building in the banlieue where he is confronted and badly beaten by a young man, who is later identified as the son of the construction worker injured in the accident. Pierre then flees the mansion and hides in an empty apartment, where he is found by Anne. They have an argument during which she asks him why he started drinking, accuses him of not taking his job in the construction firm seriously, and tells him that had he gone to the police after being beaten up, their chances in their legal dispute with the family of the construction worker would be much better. We later see her and her lawyer talking with the family, offering some money and trying to dissuade them from suing by threatening to press charges for the physical assault on Pierre by the worker's son. Pierre is later shown trying to embarrass his mother by calling one of the housemaids a \\"slave\\" in front of a large gathering during a party at the mansion. After Eve's mother falls into a coma as a result of the poisoning, which everyone believes was a suicide attempt, Eve is taken in by Thomas, her estranged father. She hacks into his computer and finds many e-mails and chat messages which show that he has a sadomasochistic sexual relationship with a female musician. Eve tries to commit suicide by taking the rest of the sedatives which she had pocketed. She survives and when her father asks her at her hospital bed why she did it, she confronts him with her knowledge of his affair and accuses him of not being able to love anyone, neither her mother, Ana√Øs, nor herself. Thomas is left speechless. A short time later, Eve's mother dies from the poisoning. Georges Laurent, depressed because of his dementia and frailty, had already tried to commit suicide before and is shown late at night driving off in a car which he steers directly into a tree in another suicide attempt. Now using a wheelchair due to bone fractures from the car crash, he asks his longtime hairdresser to help obtain a gun or medication for another suicide attempt, but the hairdresser refuses. After Eve's own attempt, Thomas asks Georges to talk to her and he asks her why she took the sedatives. When she does not answer, Georges tells her the story of how, when his wife became ill, she suffered so terribly that he finally smothered her and killed her (also the story of Haneke's previous film Amour). Eve now tells him the story of when she was a young child shortly after her father left her mother and she was sent to a youth camp where she was prescribed sedatives. She did not take the medication herself but slipped it to another girl in the camp whom she did not like. When the poisoning was detected Eve was sent home. When Georges asks her if she regrets doing it she confirms she did. At a large party at a beach restaurant in honour of Anne's engagement, Pierre arrives late with several refugees from the Calais Jungle in tow. When he starts presenting them to the party crowd, Anne breaks his finger to make him stop. While this is happening, Georges asks Eve to wheel him outside. Leaving the party unnoticed, he asks her to push him down a slipway into the sea. They go to the edge of the water where he proceeds to wheel himself into the water up to his neck. As Eve starts recording her grandfather with her smartphone, the last scene of the film seen through the lens of the phone shows Georges almost fully submerged in the water just as Thomas and Anne run after him with Anne casting a shocked look back at Eve.

On 12 February 2016, Haneke's longtime producer Margaret M√©n√©goz confirmed that the project would begin filming in northern France in the summer of 2016. On 27 June 2016, Happy End began filming in Calais, with Mathieu Kassovitz also joining the cast. It was reported that French production company Les Films du Losange had secured distribution deals in a number of countries. Release In November 2016, Sony Pictures Classics acquired U.S and Latin American distribution rights to the film. Reception =Cannes premiere= After the film's initial screening at the Cannes Film Festival, some critics acclaimed Happy End while several others \\"complained that Haneke [...] was retreading old ground.\\" In a five-star review for The Guardian, Peter Bradshaw called the film \\"as stark, brilliant and unforgiving as a halogen light\\", praising Haneke's visual composition and noting how the narrative \\"sometimes takes insidious little leaps forward, allowing us to register with a lurch the awful things that have been passed over.\\" Eric Kohn of IndieWire was also highly positive, arguing that \\"rather than smothering the material in bad vibes, the filmmaker uses them to gradually reveal a fascinating world in which anger and resentment becomes the only weapon any of these people know how to wield.\\" Conversely, Tim Robey wrote in The Telegraph that the film felt \\"shockingly familiar\\", stating, \\"Haneke‚Äôs style is less cumulative and more detached than ever. The film steadfastly refuses to coalesce, as thesis, thriller, winking satire on European wealth, despairing family soap opera, or any of the modes it suggests.\\" =Critical response= On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 69% based on 150 reviews, with an average rating of 6.93/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Happy End is far from Haneke's best work, yet it still succeeds in forcing audiences to confront‚Äîand uncomfortably consider‚Äîthe dark side of human nature.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 30 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\".

She served as president of the National Council of Women in St. Kitts and was the first and then three-time president of the Caribbean Women‚Äôs Association. She headed several programs to develop women's entrepreneurial skills and then served as the first president of the Federation of Labour Women, a political affiliation of the Saint Kitts and Nevis Labour Party to help women gain leadership and communication skills. Early life Anne Eliza Martin was born on 12 December 1920 in Antigua to Alice Maude (n√©e Cornelius) and Jacob Martin. Her mother, a staunch supporter of education, was a laundress and her father engaged in farming. They were related to the Bird family, which had members who served as Prime Ministers in the country. Martin completed her schooling in Antigua and after high school passed her Senior Cambridge Examination, allowing her to teach. At the age of 17, Martin gave birth to her first son, Clarence Fitzroy Bryant, who would later serve as St. Kitt's Minister of Education and Attorney General. Fitzroy was followed by sons Ronan and Tyrone. Career Martin found work in a printing company and during the war years met a Nevisian army reservist, Clement Liburd, whom she married in 1944. Two years after her marriage, Liburd and her family, which now included a fourth son, Karl, moved to St. Kitts. She began teaching at Trinity School, riding her bicycle daily from her home in Basseterre to the school in the Trinity Parish. During this time, she had two more children, a son, Clement Juni Liburd, Jr. who would become Director of Broadcasting for the St. Kitts Nevis Information Service, and a daughter, Marcella, who later became the Minister of Health, Social Services, Community Development, Culture and Gender Affairs. Liburd soon joined the worker's movement providing training for poor women to learn both parenting skills and employment training, guiding them in opening and operating their own businesses. After teaching for several years, she became a civil servant working in the areas of finance and administration. In the 1960s and 1970s, she worked to help develop education policies to improve the opportunities of all children to receive education. Liburd was the first president of the Caribbean Women‚Äôs Association (CARIWA), an umbrella organization formed in 1970 to collectively mobilize and unite women and women's organizations throughout the region, and was re-elected to the office three times. During the same period, she served as president of the National Council of Women in St. Kitts and during her tenure launched the \\"Learn to Earn\\" program which gained acclaim throughout the Caribbean and Canada. The program taught entrepreneurial skills to help women gain economic independence. In 1974, when the Labour Party created the Federation of Labour Women, Liburd was elected as its first president. The following year, she founded the Toast Mistress Club of St. Kitts and Nevis to train women in effective communication skills. Throughout the 1970s, Liburd represented the Labour Women at numerous international conferences sponsored by the United Nations. She attended the inaugural conference for the Decade for Women held in Mexico City, the mid- decade conference held in 1985 in Copenhagen; and was also a representative at the 1990 conference of Nairobi. She kept a black board updated with local events at the Masses House, in an age devoid of talk radio. The board was vandalized and removed many times, but always returned so that Liburd could exercise her right to free speech. Between 1982 and 1985, Liburd helped anchor the Trade Union Education Institute and University of the West Indies (UWI) interdisciplinary project to provide training and leadership capacity and teach the history of women‚Äôs contributions to society as citizens, activists, laborers, and leaders. From 1985 to 1986, she served as one of the policy makers during the Caribbean Women for Democracy conferences held in The Bahamas, Dominica, and Jamaica. Liburd was an executive member of the St. Kitts and Nevis Trade and Labour Union, traveling abroad to numerous training events as its representative. In 1996, she received membership in the Order of the British Empire for her community service work. Upon retirement from the civil service, Liburd used her bonus to open a specialty shop where she sold clothing, toiletries, ginger beer, and mauby, as well as her own baked goods. She used her shop to sell local products and provide income for the women of her community who made the goods. In 2004, Liburd was honored with a \\"Woman of Great Esteem\\" award by the organization of the same name of New York, for her contributions to the development of women's opportunities in St. Kitts and Nevis. Death and legacy Liburd died 13 September 2007 in Basseterre, St. Kitts and was buried in the Springfield Cemetery in Basseterre on 25 September 2007. News of her death led lecturers from UWI to create a series of lectures called Forever Indebted to Women to highlight the contributions of Caribbean trade women to the history of their countries. The first lecture Annstory began in St. Kitts and traveled to twelve countries throughout the region, beginning at the end of 2007. In 2011, Liburd was featured in an exhibit promoted by various departments of the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis to highlight prominent women's accomplishments.

Saint Patern The church's tower The church stands in Vannes's rue de la Fontaine and rue Saint-Patern. The church was built on the existing foundations of a much older church which held the relics of Saint Patern (the first bishop at Vannes). The original church had been built in the 11th-century and had replaced the another church which had suffered damage at the hands of Norman invaders at the turn of the 9th and 10th-centuries. It was in 1721 when a furious storm badly damaged the tower of the church. On 9 May 1726 another storm hit the town and sent the rest of the tower tumbling, crushing half of the nave and part of the choir. The building, therefore, required a major reconstruction and this reconstruction was started in 1727 under the direction of the architect Olivier Delourme (or de Lourme) and the mason Guillo. Good progress was made with the first stone being laid on the 18 September 1727 and ten years later inauguration of the major part of the cathedral was possible. By 1769, the nave foundations were completed although the spire of the tower was not completed until 1826 following a successful appeal for funds organised by the rector Gu√©nanten. The building The apse or chevet The building comprises a nave with two narrow aisles giving access to three side chapels, these furnished with six altarpieces. On the north side chapels the altarpieces are dedicated to the Immaculate conception, sainte-Th√©r√®se d'Avila and the \\"Vraie-Croix\\" whilst on the south side the dedications are to saint Roch, saint Fiacre and Notre-Dame de D√©livrance. The north transept has an altarpiece dedicated to the Sainte- Parent√© and the South transept has an altarpiece dedicated to saint Isidore. The transept also holds a further two altarpieces in white marble each with four columns. The painting which is part of the altarpiece in the south transept depicts \\"Christ aux outrages\\", whilst that in the north transept depicts the \\"Presentation in the temple\\". The altarpiece entitled the \\"R√©surrection du Christ\\" in the choir area dates to 1744, the sides of this altarpiece holding statues of saint Patern and the Virgin Mary. The choir area comprises three crossings, a painting, columns of black marble supporting a curvilinear corniche above which is another niche. The main altar shaped like a tomb in white marble and dating to the 19th-century is surmounted on each side by adoring angels. In this area, wooden niches hold statues of saint Peter and saint Paul. The pulpit This dates to 1813 and on it are carved the name of the rector No√´l Pasco and several of the church officials involved in its erection. The chapel of Notre-Dame de D√©livrance In this chapel is a reliquary in the form of a cross and made in cast iron as well as a stone statue dating to the 18th-century of \\"Notre-Dame de D√©livrance\\". Painting of saint Roch The church has an oil painting by Lhermitais of saint Roch which dates to 1747. Stained glass windows The stained glass windows in the choir area date to 1737 and were replaced in 1882 and again in 1918. The window by the church's north door dates to 1923 and depicts \\"Le Christ entour√© de huit enfants\\" (Christ surrounded by eight children). It was a gift to the church from the Mitier family of L√©h√©lec. Stalls During the church's restoration of 2006/2007 some 17th-century stalls were brought into the church as well as the statue \\"l'Enfant J√©sus de Prague\\". Tro Breizh Given the presence in the church of some bone fragments of Saint Patern, a visit to the church was one of the seven stages of this pilgrimage so popular in the Middle Ages, the task for the pilgrim was to visit the tombs of the seven founding saints of Brittany, the ancient bishops Brieuc, Malo, Samson, Corentin, Pol, Tugwal and Patern in Vannes. Discontinued at the end of the Middle Ages, the \\"Tro Breiz\\" has recently regained some popularity and pilgrims, hikers and enthusiasts of Breton history are again seeking out the old pilgrim pathways. The transept The transept walls are decorated with various paintings including one entitled \\"L'Assomption de la Vierge\\" by Alexandre Evariste Fragonard, son of the famous Jean-Honor√© Fragonard. The painting dates to 1837.

As with Nabeshima ware, the Matsura lords used the kilns to order \\"presentation ware\\" of the highest quality for them to use themselves and give as politically important presents to the sh≈çgun, emperor, and other daimy≈ç families. Sanoj≈ç's son, Imamura Ajibe is recorded as making sets of porcelains for the presentation to the sh≈çgun in 1664, and the emperor in 1699.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 16 However, these 17th-century wares are similar to some contemporary Imari ware, with a grayish tint to the porcelain body,Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 19 and very different from the style that was to make Hirado famous. A crucial development came in 1712, when a potter from the Hirado villages discovered a better source of kaolin on the Amakusa islands off the coast. This produced the superior white and hard porcelain for which Hirado wares became famous.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 17 In the years following this, painters from the Tosa and Kan≈ç schools were brought in, the former for detailed plant subjects and the latter for animal, figure and landscape subjects. They oriented the style of decoration towards a painterly \\"Japanese design vocabulary\\". The range of shapes was also greatly expanded, from being mainly vessels for food and drink to include a variety of boxes, equipment for the scholar's desk such as brush rests, and some accessories for clothing such as netsuke.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 19, 37 Paperweight with chrysanthemums and plum blossoms, blue and brown underglaze, 19th-century A motif of \\"Chinese boys\\" (karako) chasing butterflies with landscape details in the background became a distinctive feature of Hirado. Initially the number of boys shown was strictly graded, with seven depicted on pieces for presentation to the emperor or sh≈çgun, five for daimy≈ç and high officials, and three for others.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 19‚Äì21 Later similar boys appeared modelled as figures. Sculptural vessels with the form of animals began to appear, as well as designs including relief and small okimono figurines that were purely decorative. These trends were in place before the explosive growth in exports following the reopening of Japan in the 1850s, and were to be taken to further extremes in the subsequent period.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 21‚Äì22 Much Hirado ware was vessels for tea-drinking, but mostly for the less formal drinking of sencha rather than the Japanese tea ceremony, where the type of tea bowl (chawan) favoured by the tea-masters were typically more traditional non-porcelain types, that were more characterful to the touch. But Hirado ware was popular for the water jars used to hold the cold water for the tea ceremony.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 26‚Äì27 The very fine shaping and finish of Hirado ware was regarded as suitable for the many types of small pieces categorized as belonging to the \\"scholar's desk\\", such as brush rests, water droppers, paperweights, and desk screens.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 34‚Äì35 Though underglaze blue on white wares were the main products after the better kaolin was found in 1712, there were always some other types of decoration used, either for details or as the main colouring. These included the use of unglazed biscuit porcelain, an underglaze celadon and other colours, and overglaze enamels.Singer and Goodall-Cristante, 37, 43‚Äì44 By the 19th century the kilns were also imitating Nabeshima ware,Impey, 80 and even Worcester porcelain.

The Northern Nevada Veterans Cemetery is funded by the State of Nevada and the National Cemetery Association. The cemetery is 35 miles east of Reno and is adjacent to Interstate 80, in Fernley, Nevada. History In 1978, Congress established the State Cemetery Grants Program (Public Law 95-476) to aid States and U.S. territories in the establishment, expansion and improvement of veterans cemeteries. In 1987, The Nevada State Legislature approved funding for two cemeteries, one located in Northern Nevada and one located in Southern Nevada (Southern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery). Both Nevada Cemeteries opened in 1990 under the administration of the Nevada Commission for Veterans Affairs, and both are funded by the State of Nevada. As of December 2014, a total of 42,964 veterans and family members have been interred at one of the two Nevada's Veterans Memorial Cemeteries in either Boulder City or Fernley Nevada. , the Veterans Affairs Cemetery Administration is conducting one of the largest expansions of military cemeteries since the American Civil War. On September 13, 2006, Nevada's Governor, Kenny Guinn, put forward that the State had jurisdiction over state veterans' cemeteries. The Northern Nevada Veterans Memorial Cemetery was involved in the debate over the use of non-traditional graphics on government-furnished headstones and markers. The grave site of Sergeant Patrick Dana Stewart located at the Northern Nevada site became the first veterans cemetery to display the Wiccan symbol. Eventually the symbol was added to the list of emblems allowed in national cemeteries throughout the United States including VA-issued headstones, markers, and plaques. A ceremony honoring fallen soldiers is held in the cemetery each year on Memorial Day.\\"Thousands gather in Fernley for Memorial Day ceremony\\" Reno Gazette- Journal, Seth A.

Subject, predicate and object This format enables knowledge to be represented in a machine-readable way. Particularly, every part of an RDF triple is individually addressable via unique URIs ‚Äî for example, the statement \\"Bob knows John\\" might be represented in RDF as: \`http://example.name#BobSmith12 http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows http://example.name#JohnDoe34\`. Given this precise representation, semantic data can be unambiguously queried and reasoned about. The basic semantic triple model.The components of a triple, such as the statement \\"The sky has the color blue\\", consist of a subject (\\"the sky\\"), a predicate (\\"has the color\\"), and an object (\\"blue\\"). This is similar to the classical notation of an entity‚Äìattribute‚Äìvalue model within object-oriented design, where this example would be expressed as an entity (sky), an attribute (color) and a value (blue). From this basic structure, triples can be composed into more complex models, by using triples as objects or subjects of other triples ‚Äî for example, \`Mike ‚Üí said ‚Üí (triples ‚Üí can be ‚Üí objects)\`. Given their particular, consistent structure, a collection of triples is often stored in purpose-built databases called Triplestores. Difference to relational databases A relational database is the classical form for information storage. It's working with different tables which consist of rows. The well known SQL- language is able to retrieve information from a database. In contrast, the RDF triple storage is working with logical predicates. No tables nor rows are needed but the information is stored in a text file. A RDF-triple storage can be converted into a SQL database and the other way around. If the knowledge is highly unstructured and dedicated tables aren't flexible enough, semantic triples are used over classical SQL storage. In contrast to a traditional SQL database, the RDF triple storage isn't created with table editors but the preferred tool is a knowledge editor, for example Protege. Prot√©g√© looks similar to an object-oriented modeling application used for software engineering, but it's focused on natural language information. The RDF triples are aggregated into a knowledge base which allows external parser to run requests. Possible applications are located within video games for the creation of non player characters. Limitations An easy to solve concern about triple storage is the missing Database scalability towards larger datasets. The problem has become visible if not only a few information but millions of triples are stored and retrieved in a database. The seek time is larger than for classical SQL based databases. A bit harder to fix is the missing ability to predict future situation with a given knowledge model. Even if all the information are available as logical predicates, the model fails in answering what-if questions. For example, suppose in the RDF-format the world of a robot is described very well. The robot knows what the location of the table is, is aware of the distance to the table in centimeter and knows also that a table is a furniture. Before the robot can plan the next action he needs temporal reasoning capabilities. That means, the knowledge model should answer hypothetical questions in advance before an action was taken.

It was not ordered by the French Navy and only one CAMS 52 was completed. It first flew in the summer of 1930. Design and development The CAMS 52 was a French Navy torpedo-bomber floatplane prototype. The proposed production version would have been the CAMS 60 and at least one early source refers to the prototype by this name. It was a large twin-engined high wing aircraft of mixed construction. Each half-wing was in two parts, with a centre-section which mounted the engine at its extremity and sweep-back on its leading edge to improve the downward view from the cockpit. The centre-section was entirely plywood covered; since the wing thickened towards the engine, it carried significant anhedral. The outer wings had constant chord out to about two- thirds span and carried light dihedral. Beyond, the wing was straight-tapered to blunted tips. The whole trailing edge of each outer wing was occupied by narrow-chord ailerons, divided into three sections. These outer wings had a wooden structure, with two parallel box spars and I-section ribs and were braced to the lower fuselage by pairs of parallel struts from about two-thirds span, via the float. Their leading edges were ply-covered over the whole span but the rear surfaces were dural skinned. The CAMS 52 was powered by two uncowled nine-cylinder radial Gnome-Rh√¥ne 9Akx Jupiter engines, their steel tube frames mounted on the wing underside from the forward spar and fixed to the rear spar with a cone of tubes. Two fuel tanks were contained in the wing centre-section with another of the same capacity under the forward pilot's seat. Below each engine three steel struts, two in an inverted V and one vertical, joined the float centreline. Another vertical strut joined the float to the rear spar and two more ran obliquely from the lower fuselage to the engine frames. The floats were long, with hard chine and a single step. They were plywood skinned and were subdivided internally into watertight compartments. Though the CAMS 52 was designed as a floatplane, it could be adapted to use wheeled landing gear. Its fuselage had three sections; the all- metal central part was the major structural unit, taking wing and engine loads, and was joined to the others just beyond the leading and trailing wing edges. All were flat-sided and built on girders based on four steel tube longerons. The forward and central sections were mostly ply covered but the rear covering was entirely fabric. The single-curvature nose, semi-circular in plan, contained a position for the observer/bomb aimer and was equipped with twin Lewis guns on a flexible mount. Behind him there was a separate open viewing platform for the navigator/bomber, accessed from his windowed cabin below which contained a sighting compass and map table. Aft, the upper surface rose towards the wing leading edge, where there were separate starboard-side tandem open cockpits for two pilots. On the port-side, adjacent to the first pilot, was an observer's post. This central section of the fuselage held vertically mounted bombs and externally mounted torpedoes; details of the intended armament and bomb loads are given below. It also contained a sound- proofed cabin for the wireless operator. The third section, accessed via a port side door, contained dorsal and ventral gun positions, a flexible camera mounting and a hatch in the floor used during mooring. The CAMS 52 had a conventional, fabric covered tail, with a broad, near-triangular fin and a rectangular, wire-braced tailplane. The elevators and rudder, the latter reaching down to the keel, were narrow, straight-edged and balanced. Both rudder and elevators had inflight-adjustible trimming surfaces along their entire trailing edges. The sole CAMS 52 was first flown in June 1930 from Sartrouville but the Navy did not choose it for production. Variants ;CAMS 52: prototype, registered F-AKAH ;CAMS 60: production model.

Fuller also did research for the Pikes Peak expedition. From 1914 to 1919, Douglas served in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he attained the rank of temporary lieutenant-colonel. After the gas attacks at Wulverghem in the Second Battle of Ypres, John Scott Haldane and Douglas were rushed to a central laboratory at the British General Headquarters in Ypres. During World War I, Joseph Barcroft, John Scott Haldane, and Douglas were among the leading technical experts on gas warfare. At Oxford, Douglas became in 1919 demonstrator in general metabolism, reader in 1937, and professor in 1942, retiring as professor in 1949 at the mandatory retirement age. However, he accepted the position of demonstrator so that he could continue teaching and retired as demonstrator in 1953. After 1920 the work of Douglas and his research students dealt mainly with the effects of exercise on respiration, metabolism, and the circulatory system. One of his last three research students was Roger Bannister. After 1920 Douglas also devoted more time to government committee work. C. Gordon Douglas died unmarried. His older brother James Sholto Cameron Douglas was appointed to the Joseph Hunter chair of pathology at the University of Sheffield.

The Tombs is a now defunct society founded in 1903 whose members were known to tie bells around their ankles. Details regarding its purpose, selection of members and the importance of the bells are still unknown.[27] Order of the Red Friars Two of the most well-known societies were the Order of the Red Friars and the Order of the White Duchy. Order of the Red Friars was founded in 1913 with an initial purpose to promote school spirit. Later, the group declared a change of mission to focus more on fostering loyalty to Duke University. The Order, as it was colloquially-known, was semi-secret. This is because the selection of new members, known as tapping, was held on the steps of the Duke Chapel in broad daylight. As the years went on, the rites of tapping became more elaborate; in the final and most traditional form of the rite, a red-hooded and robed figure publicly tapped new men into membership on the steps of the chapel. Some notable members of the Order were former President of the United States Richard M. Nixon, William P. Few, and Rex Adams. Order of the White Duchy The Order of the White Duchy was founded in May 1925 by the Order of the Red Friars. The Red Friars chose what they considered the seven outstanding female members of the Class of 1925 to organize a similar organization, although it was not to be a sister organization. From 1925 on, new members were tapped into the order by the seven members of the White Duchy from the previous year. Members were known by the white carnation they wore on specific days of the year. Throughout the 1960s, both societies faced charges of elitism and struggled to tap students at an increasingly hostile university. In 1968, the White Duchy disbanded and in 1971, the Order of the Red Friars was disbanded by alumni who determined that the group had outlived its usefulness.[28] However, rumors surrounding its continued, albeit modified, form exist today. Two current secret societies - the Trident Society and the Old Trinity Club - are both thought to have been founded in the wake of the disbanding of the Order of the Red Friars. The Old Trinity Club is rumored to have started when an Editor-in-Chief of the Duke Chronicle was passed up for membership and decided to create his own, rival society. Old Trinity Club The Old Trinity Club is the most visible society on campus today, as its members are seen walking around campus wearing black graduation gowns and sunglasses on certain days of the year. They follow a set pattern, holding their arms in symbols in the air and routinely stopping and shouting \\"Eruditio et Religio.\\", the motto of Duke University which translates from Latin as \\"Erudition and Religion\\". A November 2007 edition of Rival Magazine quoted Associate Vice President for Student Affairs and Dean of Students, Sue Wasiolek T'76, claiming that \\"the Old Trinity Club has died, or at least in terms of its original manifestation. The way it manifests today is very different than when it was at its finest.\\" It is said that students do not take the society seriously, viewing it more as a social fraternity than a secret society. Trident Society The Trident Society is an undergraduate secret society at Duke which is rumored to have inherited the mission of the Order of the Red Friars. Only recently has it come to light that \\"TS\\" stands for \\"Trident Society.\\" The society keeps strict silence, except for two instances in which its activity came to be known. The first involved a November 2007 edition of the Rival Magazine which explained the group's philosophy. According to a \\"cryptic letter sealed with wax,\\" the society is \\"rooted in ideals that stretch back to the university's founding.\\" The letter continued: \\"Our founders recognized that similar institutions existed at other top universities (Skull and Bones at Yale, The Sevens at UVA, Quill and Dagger at Cornell) and saw a void to fill Duke\\" As such, its members are not typically public about their membership in the society. They \\"do not join to gain fame\\" or recognition. Members are or were Rhodes Scholars, Truman Scholars, commencement speakers, players for Coach Krzyzweski, Phi Beta Kappas, A.B. & B.N. Duke Scholars, and leaders of the most influential groups on campus. The secrecy around this group drove Samantha Lachman to investigate the society in 2013.[29] Her subsequent article, \\"Trasked with Secrecy,\\" revealed some information about the group. She discovered the names of several prominent members, that the red roses and white carnations sometimes found at the base of the James B. Duke statue on West Campus are their calling card, and even that they have uninhibited access to the Duke University Chapel for Initiation Rites.[30] References Duke University American secret societies ","title":"Secret societies at Duke University"},{"id":"51445897","text":"The Organization of Black Designers is an organization founded in 1990 with a focus on interior, fashion, architectural, and graphic designers.

The Trident Society is rumored to have inherited the mission of The Order of the Red Friars and The Order of the White Duchy (the female version of the Friars). The Society seeks to give back to Duke University. History The origin of the group remains shrouded in mystery. Frederick Wilson Neu claims to have been a member in 1934, whereas others believe the group came about in the wake of the dissolution of the Order of the Red Friars and Order of the White Duchy. Only recently has it come to light that \\"TS\\" stands for \\"Trident Society.\\" The men and women of the society maintain strict silence about their membership and the group's mission. A November 2007 edition of the Rival Magazine explained the group's philosophy. According to a \\"cryptic letter sealed with wax,\\" the society is \\"rooted in ideals that stretch back to the university's founding.\\" The letter continued: \\"Our founders recognized that similar institutions existed at other top universities (Skull and Bones at Yale, The Sevens at the University of Virginia, Quill and Dagger at Cornell) and saw a void to fill at Duke.\\" As such, on-campus members are not typically public about their membership in the Society, and do not join for recognition. Members of the society are or were recipients of the Rhodes Scholarship, Marshall Scholarship, Truman Scholarship, Angier B. Duke Scholarship, Benjamin Newton Duke Scholarship, players for Coach Mike Krzyzewski, and leaders of influential campus organizations. The secrecy around this group drove Samantha Lachman to investigate the society in the Duke Chronicle. Her subsequent article, \\"Trasked with Secrecy,\\" revealed information including the names of several prominent members, that the group places red roses and white carnations at the base of the James Buchanan Duke statue as their calling card, and that the group maintains uninhibited access to the Duke Chapel for their Initiation Rites. Activities The Trident Society annually writes and frames a letter of recognition to select faculty and staff at the University who exceptionally impact the lives of students, maintains support for undergraduate scholarships, and makes philanthropic gifts. The organization also writes an annual letter, which is usually found on the steps of Lilly or Marketplace during the first few weeks of every school year, welcoming freshmen to the campus. Signs of the Trident Society appear frequently on Duke's campus, and such notes are sometimes accompanied by a rose.Kulshrestha, Ashwin (October 14, 2019). \\"Chronquiry: What‚Äôs up with all the weird guys in robes?

Freund continued his studies in philosophy at Heidelberg University, where he received his doctorate in 1892. Freund served as rabbi in smaller congregations in Czarnikau, and then Ostrowo, where he met and married Minna Feilchenfeld.

Eckart, looking to spread the calumny that Jews had not contributed to the German war effort during World War I, offered a prize of 1,000 marks for proof that even a single Jewish family had sent three sons into the army to fight for more than three weeks. \\"Rabbi Freund of Hannover immediately gave him a list of twenty families in his own community who sent three sons into the trenches for three weeks and more.

Ordered by a German court to pay 1,000 marks to the Jewish veterans group, Eckart complied. Landrabbiner In 1924, while continuing his work as a local rabbi, Samuel Freund became Landrabbiner of Hannover. Landrabbiners were elected by the communities they represented, but they were officers of the state and could not be removed from office without the consent of the German government. Specifically, the Landrabbiner of Hannover was charged with supervising all publicly funded employees working in synagogues, Jewish schools, and Jewish charitable institutions throughout the German state of Lower Saxony.Encyclopedia Judaica: Landrabbiner, http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0012_0_11843.html Samuel Freund was the last to ever hold the office of Hannover Landrabbiner and remained Landrabbiner until his death.

Liberal Judaism, German Patriotism, and Zionism  Zionist recruitment poster, 1930: 'Defense - Security - Construction' Freund was a rabbi in the Liberal Jewish tradition. By the end of the 19th Century, most Jews in Germany were members of Liberal or Neo-Orthodox congregations. Liberal Judaism in Germany was an evolving form of Jewish observance, distinguished from German Neo-Orthodox Judaism by the use of Cantors, mixed (male/female) seating, German-language segments of the service, and a common text used by the congregation for prayers. Furthermore, Liberal Judaism rejected (while the Neo-Orthodox accepted) the supremacy of rabbinical courts over the secular laws of Germany. Many Liberal Jews fought for Germany in the first World War, and they emphasized the compatibility of Judaism with German patriotism. Liberal Jews also tended to dress like other German citizens. Both traditions emphasized the religious and cultural aspects of Judaism while rejecting any claims about Jewish nationalism (also known as Zionism). 'The Jews in Weimar Germany', Donald L. Niewyk, Louisiana State University Press, 1980 Samuel Freund, as a patriotic German, opposed the Zionist movement, which was gaining strength in Germany in the 1920s. German Zionists saw Judaism as a national identity first and foremost, albeit one with no physical country to call home. According to German Zionist leaders, it was not possible logically, and psychologically, to be both a Jew and a true member of any other nation. They viewed emigration to Palestine, and the establishment of a Jewish state there, as the only long-term solution to anti- Semitism and the only way for Jews to truly belong to a nation.The Jews in Weimar Germany, Donald L. Niewyk, Louisiana State University Press, 1980, p.126 Opinions differed within the Freund family as well. Two of Samuel Freund's three adult children - Eduard and Lisa - moved to Palestine in the mid-1930s (Julius, the youngest sibling, moved 1938 to southern California). Samuel Freund visited his children in Palestine on two occasions, the last time in 1937. Each time, Freund chose to return to his congregation in Germany.

German authorities later presented Freund's office with a bill for 26,000 reichsmarks (the current equivalent of $150,000 US) for the synagogue's demolition and clean-up costs.Destroyed German Synagogues and Communities: Hannover, http://germansynagogues.com/index.php/about-us Samuel Freund spent the last six months of his life tending to his congregation and trying to secure passage out of Germany for his wife and himself. Freund's health was poor, and in late June 1939 he died of heart failure, and was buried in the Jewish cemetery on the Strangriede in Hannover. In December 1941, the Nazis began, in earnest, to move all of Hannover's Jews to concentration camps.Encyclopedia Judaica: Hanover, http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08378.html Samuel Freund's wife, Minna, was sent to Theresienstadt on July 23, 1942.

By the end of 1951, eight new sleeping cars and six new sitting cars had entered service. Additions to the fleet continued until 1972; in all, 44 carriages were built. Around 8 were still in service in March 2020 on The Overland operated by Journey Beyond, however funding may not be renewed after the COVID 19 restrictions end. Other carriages have been transferred to different services or sold. Design From 1949 The Overland moved into the modern era, with new air-conditioned corten steel carriages gradually entering service, in maroon with a fluted stainless steel panel on each side and a black roof. The construction style had previously been introduced with the Cafeteria Car, built in 1947 for the Port Pirie region's East-West Express. The maroon livery remained until the 1990s. The sitting cars were all organised as eight compartments linked to a side corridor, with different fittings as suited to the type. The first-class cars seated 48, and the second-class cars seated 64. The sleeping cars each held 20 passengers, either in ten compartments for two each, connected to a side corridor; or ten compartments either side of a central corridor. Construction =Phase one= Six sleeping carriages had been built by the end of 1950; 1951 saw two first-class sitting carriages and a further two sleeping cars entering service, and four second-class sitting cars entered service the following year, for a fleet total of fourteen cars. =Phase two= To respond to growing patronage, a further two sleeping cars were built in each of 1955, 1956, 1957 and 1958. 1960 saw a further two second-class sitting cars constructed, and in 1962 a third first-class sitting car was constructed, to replace composite sitting car 3ABS which was returned to the Victorian Railways fleet. =Phase three= Construction picked up again in 1966, with two more second-class sitting cars built to a slightly modified design, replacing 1ABS and 2ABS which were returned to the VR fleet. The next year saw two further sleeping cars added, then the final two second-class sitting cars entered service in 1968. =Phase four= From 1970 the train underwent significant changes. The last of the E type timber carriages were withdrawn from joint-stock service and split between the South Australian and the Victorian Railways. To replace them, two Luggage Vans (CO), three Club Cars, and four Power Vans (PCO) were built for the train; and the remaining rollingstock was converted away from axle-mounted generator sets to instead take power from the generators fitted to the PCO. Shortly afterwards, the first three second-class sitting cars (1BJ, 2BJ and 3BJ) had some compartments modified to provide on-train buffet facilities. These were reclassed RBJ. Also around the same time, the Victorian Railways (VR) purchased the South Australian Railways' (SAR) share in the first four Sleeping cars for their use on The Vinelander; these were replaced by 1972 with four new cars, taking on the old identities. Operations =V & SAR era 1949-1975= Following World War II, the VR and SAR agreed that a major upgrade of The Overland service was needed. At the time, the train was formed using a handful of E type carriages, perhaps with the occasional air-conditioned carriage taken from Victoria's fleet. To provide for the upgrade, a new design of steel carriages was developed, to replace the worst of the E type sleeping carriages. The first car, Allambi, entered service in 1949 as a roomette sleeper with a central corridor and ten sleeping compartments either side, with room for 20 passengers. The car was fitted with airconditioning and electric lighting, powered by axle-driven generators.\\"New Sleeping Cars to be Named\\" Railway Gazette 23 December 1949 page 729 When the carriage was deemed successful, and additional three Roomette sleepers (Tantini, Mururi and Chalaki), and two Twinette sleepers with a side corridor and ten two-berth compartments. These five entered service in 1950, and with Allambi they displaced some of the E Type carriages which were split between the VR and SAR fleets. Two further sleeping and six sitting cars were added to the fleet over the next few years, for a total of 14 carriages by the end of 1952. *Fit HEP 1970 *RBJ 1, 2, 3 *Club Cars could've been RAJ =V & ANR era 1975-1997= In 1975, Australian National (AN) took over the South Australian Railways, and the former SAR share of the carriages was transferred across to AN. In 1986 ANR introduced a new computerised rollingstock tracking system, with the carriages awarded check letters following the first four letters of their names as the class; for example Yanni was officially known as YANN, with check letter K generated by the algorithm. In 1987 the names were removed and the carriages were reclassed. The sleepers were split into four groups; JRA and JRB for first and second class roomette carriages, and JTA and JTB for first and second class twinette carriages. First Class carriages were from the original batch built 1949-1958, and Second Class from the 1967-1972 batch. Between 1987 and 1993, the deployment was thus:- Shared between V/Line and AN *AJ cars 1, 2 and 3 *RBJ cars 1, 2 and 3 *BJ cars 4-10 *Club Cars 1, 2 and 3 *Luggage Vans CO 1 and 2 *Power Vans PCO 1 through 4 *JRA cars 1 through 6 were Mururi, Chalaki, Nankuri, Purpawi, Juki and Tarkinji *JRB cars 1 and 2 were Allambi 2nd and Tantini 2nd *JTA cars 1 through 6 were Nomuldi, Mokai, Malkari, Paiti (later renamed Sir Hans Heysen), Yanni (later renamed Sir John Forrest) and Kuldalai *JTB cars 1 through 4 were Tawarri, Yankai, Weroni 2nd and Dorai 2nd With V/Line for The Vinelander *Sleeping Cars 11, 13 were Allambi 1st and Tantini 1st; later SJ281, SJ283. *Sleeping Cars 12, 14 were Dorai 1st and Weroni 1st; later SJ282, SJ284. With the pending gauge conversion of the Adelaide to Melbourne line in 1994-1996 and falling patronage in any case, the oldest cars were withdrawn from service and onsold. The remaining fleet - the sitting cars and the newest of the sleepers - were converted to standard gauge - Sitting cars AJ 1, 2 and 3, Roomettes JRB 1 and 2, and Twinettes JTB 1, 2, 3 and 4. In 1993 The Vinelander was withdrawn and the V/Line carriages were placed into storage at Newport Workshops, when V/Line was split into Passenger and Freight divisions in 1995, the cars were retained by the Victorian State Government rather than being allocated to either group. Dispersal 1995 In 1995 the CO, JRA and JTA cars and power van PCO2 were removed from AN's rolling stock register, marked as withdrawn and scrapped. In actuality they were sold to International Development Services, who onsold the fleet over the next few years. At the same time, power vans PCO1 and PCO3 and Club Car No.1 were sold to V/Line. The latter was renamed Victoria. It is thought that 1CO was successfully sold, but it has been sitting at Islington Railway Workshops for over a decade. In 1997, JTA4 and JTA5 were sold to Blue Bird Rail, then to Grand Corporate Rail. At some point they were converted to luxury cars, with some bedrooms retained and others converted to an open lounge and dining area; under this form the two became BMC1 and BMC2 respectively. Grand Corporate Rail was forced to stop operating due to the insurance crisis of 2003, so the cars were sold to Great Southern Railway and renamed Sir Hans Heyson and Sir John Forrest in 2003. In 1998, JTA6 was privately purchased, and is now under restoration as a static display on private property. Also in 1998, West Coast Railway purchased cars PCO 2, CO 2, JRA 1, 3 and 4, and JTA 1 and 3. They were transferred to Melbourne on standard gauge bogies, then railed to Ballarat North Workshops for reconditioning and use on excursion trips. When West Coast Railway folded in 2004 the cars were dispersed by the Australian Loco & Railway Carriage Company. PCO2 was immediately sold to V/Line; in 2009 it was reconditioned and renumbered PCJ493, and it now operates with PCJ491 and 492 (ex PCO 1 and 3) on the standard gauge service from Melbourne to Albury. After PCO2, the next two sold were JTA1 and JRA3, also in 2004. JTA1 was sold privately, then again in 2012 and is now under restoration on private property in Kyneton. CO2 and JRA3 were sold to Rail Experience and held at South Geelong yard, then moved to Newport Workshops in 2012. In 2007, JRA1, JRA4 and JTA3 were sold by the Australian Loco & Railway Carriage Company to Bluebird Rail Operations. Around the same time, Bluebird acquired JRA2. All four were refurbished as crew cars, and they re-entered service in the period 2008-2010 as, respectively, RZEY 1, 4 and 3, and QCAY 2; the latter for Queensland Rail. Not much information is available for JRA5 or JTA2 immediately following their purchase by Bluebird Rail. At some point JTA2 was sold to Genesee & Wyoming Australia, and JRA5 was sold to Queensland Rail as QCAY5. =GSR era 1997-2010= On 1 November 1997, the remaining passenger services operated by Australian National were sold to Great Southern Rail (GSR).Great Southern Railway Consortium completes acquisition of Australian National Railways Passenger Business Serco Group 31 October 1997 The sale included the standard gauge Overland passenger fleet - two roomette, four twinette sleepers; three first-class and six second-class sitting cars, three composite second-class sitting with buffet cars and two club cars. Power van PCO4 was also included in the sale, but at the time it was on broad gauge for the short-lived Explorer train, in a dark blue livery with wide yellow bands. It was converted to standard gauge in 1998 and given quick coat of grey paint. In 1999 the carriages were refurbished and repainted to a plain grey scheme at Keswick, and most of the cars had names applied, recycled from the sleeping carriages. Respectively, 5BJ through 10BJ became Mururu, Nankuri, Purpawi (sic), Chalaki and Tarkinji, and PCO 4 became Paite (sic). The three RBJ cars were all named Kookaburra Club Car; the Club Cars 2 and 3 were classed CCL and named Nomuldi and Malkari. AJ1, 2 and 3, RBJ1, RBJ3 and 4BJ were not named following their refurbishment; and shortly afterwards Chalaki was renamed Kildalai (sic). In 2003 Purpawi was corrected to Purwapi. Then, in 2002-2003, the fleet was sold to a third party consortium and leased back for operational purposes. A second refurbishment was undertaken in 2006-2007, applicable mainly to the second- class sitting cars. Retention toilets were fitted, with the male toilets shifted to the former ladies' toilet, and the latter shifted into the former powder room. The original male toilets were converted into showers, allowing the cars to be used on The Ghan and Indian Pacific services if and as necessary. At this time RBJ3 was refitted again, this time named Cafe 828. Similarly, CCL2 \\"Nomuldi\\" was upgraded to the \\"Charles Sturt\\" Outback Explorer lounge car, re-entering service in 2008; and PCO4 had its name removed, along with door replacements and a general overhaul. In 2010, GSR was looking at selling parts of the fleet for use as crew cars by other operators. =Current status= In 2011, 8BJ \\"Mokai\\", CCL3 \\"Malkari\\", RBJ1 and RBJ2 and JRB2 were sold to Genesee & Wyoming Australia and converted to crew cars ADFY1 through 5. JRB1 was sold to Pacific National and renumbered RZEY2, slotting between RZEY1, 3 and 4. The original RZEY gap was left for Aurizon's QCAY2. AJ1-3 were also sold though their current ownership is unclear. As of 2016, the V/Line Passenger Network Service Plan Addendahttps://corporate.vline.com.au/getattachment/16cd1a7a-2973-4631-80fc-b6218b9ef990/Addenda lists these vehicles as accredited for operation in Victoria: *Great Southern Rail: BJ4-10, BMC2, CCL2, JTB1-4, PCO4 & RBJ3, all Standard Gauge only. *Seymour Railway Heritage Centre, leased to V/Line & 707 Operations: JTA6 \\"Kuldalai\\" *Steamrail Victoria, leased to V/Line: SJ283.

The interiors of these new cars were of a more modern design than the older cars. The roomette cars had a zigzag corridor instead of a straight one, and the compartments had the shape of a trapezium. This enabled the use of the toilet and washbasin units while the bed was still down, not possible in the older roomettes. In 1949 the classleader, Allambi, entered service, followed by Tantini, Weroni, Dorai, Mururi and Chalaki in 1950 and Nomuldi and Mokai in 1951. Of those, Allambi, Tantini, Mururi and Chalaki were roomette cars with zigzag corridors; the other four were standard compartment-style twinette cars. The sleeping cars were of two types. Twinette cars had two-berth compartments (as had the E and Mann cars before them), but each compartment had an adjoining toilet and shower room; roomette cars had single-berth compartments either side of a central aisle, and a shower room at the end of the car.Commonwealth Railways had showers in some sleeping cars from 1919 The new cars were not numbered, but instead given names based on Aboriginal words related to sleep or dreams. Additional carriages were built a few years later, with Roomettes Nankuri and Purpawi in 1955, Twinettes Tolkini (later Malkari) and Tandeni (later Paiti) in 1956, Twinettes Yanni and Kuldalai in 1957 and Roomettes Juki and Tarkinji in 1958. Two further cars were built in 1967, Twinettes Tawarri and Yankai,Tawarri ‚Äì V&SAR; Joint Stock Steel Sleeping Car Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesYankai ‚Äì V&SAR; Joint Stock Steel Sleeping Car Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages for a total fleet of eighteen. These last two had a slightly different interior layout. In 1971, the SAR's share in roomette cars Allambi and Tantini and twinette cars Dorai and WeroniAllambi Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesTantini Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesDorai Chris' Commonwealth Railways PagesWeroni Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages was sold to the Victorian Railways for use on The Vinelander to Mildura. They were repainted dark blue and their names removed; these names were then applied to the same type of new cars built to replace them. The new sleepers, Weroni and Dorai (1971) and Allambi and Tantini (1972) were built with the altered interior matching the 1967 batch (though Allambi and Tantini were still roomettes).Comrails: Steel V&SAR; Joint Stock Carriages Chris' Commonwealth Railways Pages Under Victorian Railways, the cars had blue painted where maroon had previously been used, with Vinelander nameplates on the carriage sides in place of the names. The cars were numbered as Sleepers Nos 11 to 14, previously Allambi, Tantini, Weroni and Dorai. The New Deal in 1983 saw the four Victorian Railways Sleeper carriages renumbered to SJ 281 to 284, and the carriages were repainted again, this time with orange replacing the blue, with V/Line logos on plates fitted to the left ends. Under Australian National the vehicles were allocated classes, with Mururi, Chalaki, Nankuri, Purpawi, Juki and Tarkinji becoming JRA1-6, Nomuldi, Mokai, Tolkini, Tandeni, Yanni and Kuldalai JTA1-6, and Tawarri and Yankai JTB1-2. The second Allambi and Tantini became JRB1-2, and the second Weroni and Dorai JTB3-4. \\"R\\" was for Roomette and \\"T\\" for Twinette, with \\"A\\" or \\"B\\" respectively indicating first class for the pre-1967 fleet, or second class for the post-1967 fleet.http://www.comrails.com/sar_carriages/a0203_sj.html Therefore it is safe to assume that if the four carriages passed to the Victorian Railways had been retained, they would have been classed as further JRA and JTA units. =Power vans= V/Line liveried van PCJ 493 Southern Cross station In the early 1970s The Overland required head end power for air conditioning and lighting. Prior to this time, all electrical power had been supplied by axle-driven generators. As a result, the two railways between them built four PCO vans, numbered 1 - 4, in 1970. They were Joint Stock vehicles owned and maintained jointly by the VR and SAR, and their later, respective incarnations of VicRail and V/Line (VR), and Australian National (SAR). Each had two diesel generators and could carry of luggage. In 1990 the V/Line N class locomotives, which had their own head end power units, took over hauling the Overland and the PCO vans were put into storage. In 1995, V/Line and Australian National took full ownership of two vans each. V/Line took PCOs 1 and 3, which it renumbered PCJ 491 and 492 respectively, and AN took PCOs 2 and 4. PCO 2 remained in storage until was purchased by West Coast Railway in 1998. When West Coast Railway ceased operation in 2004 it was acquired by V/Line and in 2009 was refurbished and renumbered to PCJ 493. All three PCJ vans were converted to standard gauge in 2011 for use on the V/Line Albury service. Australian National used PCO4 on the short-lived Explorer tour train in South Australia and converted to standard gauge for use again on The Overland. It was completely refurbished in 2007 with new diesel generator sets. =Luggage vans= In 1970 two Joint Stock guards vans were built for the Melbourne to Adelaide The Overland service. They were coded CO, and remained in use until 1994, when they were transferred to Australian National. Both vans were written off of the shared V/Line and Australian National rollingstock register in 1995. 2CO was sold to West Coast Railway in 1998 and transferred to Melbourne in early December of that year. However, there is no evidence that it was ever restored or utilised by that group. In 2004, when West Coast Railway shut down, the carriage was sold to Australian Loco & Railway Carriage Company for the Murraylander service, but quickly passed on to the Geelong-based group Rail Experience. Model railways =HO Scale= Lima Lima produced approximations of these carriages. Trainbuilder Trainbuilder has produced a brass range of The Overland carriages. The first series were released as parts of complete The Overland trains. In 2016/17, a new batch included pairs of Sleepers 11/13 or 12/14 in Vinelander Blue with silver, or SJ281/283 or SJ282/S84 in V/Line Orange and Grey. Pairs of cars sell for $950/pack.

United States Professional sports leagues as known today evolved during the decades between the Civil War and World War II, when the railroad was the main means of intercity transportation. As a result, virtually all major league teams were concentrated in the northeastern quarter of the United States, within roughly the radius of a day-long train ride. No MLB teams existed south or west of St. Louis, the NFL was confined to the Great Lakes and the Northeast, and the NBA's 1946 launch spanned only from St. Louis to Boston. The NHL remained confined to six cities in the Northeast, Great Lakes and eastern Canada until 1967, though in the 1910s and 1920s, teams from its predecessor league had contested the Stanley Cup at season's end with teams from western Canada and the Pacific Northwest. College, minor league and amateur teams existed from coast to coast in all four sports, but rarely played outside of their home region for regular season games. Early professional soccer activity was concentrated almost entirely on an East Coast corridor from Baltimore to Boston, though a series of leagues located solely within the St. Louis metropolitan area also served as de facto major leagues for periods. As travel and settlement patterns changed, so did the geography of professional sports. With the arguable exception of the western hockey teams which competed for the Stanley Cup in the early 20th century and the independent Los Angeles Bulldogs football team of the 1930s and 1940s, there were no major league teams in the far west until after World War II. The first west coast major-league franchise was the NFL's Los Angeles Rams, who moved from Cleveland in 1946. The same year, the All-America Football Conference began play, with teams in Los Angeles and San Francisco, and the Miami Seahawks, who became the only southern-based major league franchise, although Louisville, Kentucky had previously had short-lived baseball and football teams. The San Francisco franchise would be one of three AAFC teams admitted to the NFL after the AAFC's demise in 1949. Baseball would not extend west until 1958 in the move of both New York-based National League franchises, the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants. The NBA would follow in 1960 with the move of the Minneapolis Lakers to Los Angeles, while the NHL would not have a west coast presence until it doubled in size in 1967. With the exception of the Los Angeles Kings, the NHL's initial franchises in the Southern and Western United States were ultimately unsuccessful‚Äîteams in Oakland, Atlanta, Kansas City and Denver all relocated. From 1982 until 1991, the Kings were the only U.S.-based NHL franchise south of St. Louis and/or west of the Twin Cities, and even the St. Louis Blues required league action to prevent being relocated to Saskatchewan. Since then, as newer, fast-growing Sunbelt areas such as Phoenix, Tampa, and Dallas became prominent, the major sports leagues have expanded or franchises have relocated to service these communities. The NHL's national footprint is a relatively recent situation. Historically, the league was concentrated in the northeast, with no teams south of New York City or west of Chicago from 1935 until 1967. The league expanded its footprint westward in a 1967 expansion but, other than the unsuccessful Atlanta Flames, avoided the South until making a major expansion into the territory in the 1990s. The CFL had a total of six teams in the United States over a three-year period between 1993 and 1995, all in medium-sized markets that lacked an NFL team at the time (of the six markets, three had other major league franchises at the time), and played occasional games in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s. Canada =NHL= The National Hockey League was established in 1917 in Canada with four hockey clubs in three Canadian cities (Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa). The first American club, based in Boston, joined the league in 1924, but American hockey clubs had existed before the NHL expanded into the United States. The first US-based club to compete for the Stanley Cup was the Portland Rosebuds of the Pacific Coast Hockey League, who lost the 1916 series to the Montreal Canadiens (then of the National Hockey Association). The next year, the PCHA's Seattle Metropolitans took the Cup away from the Canadiens. The Boston Bruins are the oldest US-based franchise in the NHL, having played in the league since 1924. When the WHA and NHL merged, the NHL inherited teams in three Canadian cities, Edmonton, Winnipeg and Quebec City. However, of these three teams, only the Edmonton Oilers remain in their original city, or in Canada‚Äîthe other two teams relocated to the U.S. in the 1990s. (Winnipeg's current NHL team was originally based in Atlanta before moving north in 2011.) The NHL has been the dominant professional sports league in Canada, and was first established in Canada in 1917. Some US-based leagues, like MLB, MLS, and the NBA, have awarded franchises to Canadian cities, though outside of Toronto most teams have been unsuccessful. The NHL was initially based entirely in eastern Canada, with teams in Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Hamilton and Quebec City; by 1925, Hamilton and Quebec City no longer had NHL teams, while Ottawa would leave in 1934, by which point American teams were slowly being added. The first Canadian expansion team would come in 1970 with a team in Vancouver; the NHL later added teams in Edmonton, Winnipeg and Quebec City (through absorption of WHA franchises), Calgary (via relocation from Atlanta) and Ottawa (via expansion) to go with the still-extant Toronto and Montreal teams. The distinctive place hockey holds in Canadian culture allowed these franchises to compete with teams in larger cities for some time. However, the teams in Winnipeg and Quebec City were eventually moved to larger media markets in the U.S., respectively Phoenix and Denver. The NHL's Canadian teams benefited greatly from the rise of the Canadian dollar to parity with its U.S. counterpart in the early 2010s, mainly because they collect most of their revenues in Canadian dollars but pay their player salaries in U.S. dollars. As a result, the NHL returned to Winnipeg for the 2011‚Äì12 season, with the Atlanta Thrashers relocating to become the newest version of the Winnipeg Jets. Since then, however, the Canadian dollar has weakened considerably against the U.S. dollar. There has been discussion of potential relocation to Quebec and, at least on a part-time basis, to Saskatoon in the future; while there have been efforts to bring an NHL team to Hamilton or suburban Toronto, the league currently opposes those efforts and has actively blocked efforts to relocate teams to Hamilton. In addition to full-time teams, the NHL, through its Kraft Hockeyville promotion, hosts a preseason game in a select small town each year. =CFL= The Canadian Football League has teams in all seven current NHL markets, in addition to Hamilton, Ontario, and Regina, Saskatchewan. Regina is considered a regional franchise and also represents Saskatoon as well as the rest of the province of Saskatchewan. At least eight of these nine markets have hosted CFL teams every year since the league's officially listed inception in 1958, and no other Canadian market has ever had a CFL team of its own. The CFL has broadened its footprint through one-off games. Regular season games were held in Canada's maritime provinces, under the name Touchdown Atlantic, from 2010 to 2013; the league had awarded the Atlantic Schooners in the early 1980s to an ownership group in Halifax, but the team could not secure a large enough stadium to field a CFL team, and the expansion was canceled. All of the regular-season Touchdown Atlantic games were held at Moncton Stadium in Moncton, New Brunswick, the largest stadium in the Maritimes but one of marginal CFL capacity; preseason games have previously been held at the smaller Canada Games Stadium in Saint John and Huskies Stadium in Halifax. The CFL is the only major league that has ever had a presence in the Maritimes; it suspended its maritime operations after 2013 because of declining attendance. In 2015, the CFL commenced Northern Kickoff, originally slated to be one preseason game and later expanded to a regular- season game as well, both of which were played in Fort McMurray, an oil sands boomtown with a metro area population of less than 70,000, by far the smallest market to host major professional football in the modern era. (Fort McMurray is in close proximity to Edmonton, which, in a similar manner to the Green Bay Packers in the United States, was expected to boost attendance, but the Northern Kickoff was largely a failure, with fewer than 5,000 fans attending the regular-season game.) =NFL= The NFL is the only one of the major leagues to not have any teams based in any Canadian city; the closest teams to Canada are the Buffalo Bills, whose stadium is located south of the Canada‚ÄìUS border, and the Detroit Lions, whose stadium is located from Windsor, Ontario. Both border teams consider portions of Southern Ontario part of their markets, with the Lions drawing from Southwestern Ontario and the Bills from the Golden Horseshoe, which includes Toronto and Hamilton. In the 1950s and 1960s, selected NFL teams would travel north to Canada to play a CFL team in pre- season interleague games (as did the Bills, at the time in the American Football League). From 2008‚Äì13 the Bills played one regular-season game each year and sporadic pre-season games in Toronto. The Bills were drawing about 15,000 Canadian fans per game during the time the Toronto Series ran, and the Bills' then-owner, Ralph Wilson, saw Toronto's corporate market as key to securing the franchise's future; the Bills have effectively maxed out their revenue potential in the economically struggling Western New York region. (Wilson's successor, Terry Pegula, canceled the Bills' Toronto games.) The league also has agreements with the CFL that date to the 1990s regarding the honoring of player contracts. =Other leagues= The first Major League Baseball team in Canada was the Montreal Expos who began play in 1969. In 2005, they moved to Washington, D.C. and became the Washington Nationals. The Toronto Blue Jays, who began play in 1977, became the first team outside the United States to win the World Series in 1992 and 1993. MLS's first was Toronto FC, which was added in 2007; it was soon followed by the Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps. The Toronto Huskies were a charter member of the Basketball Association of America (the forerunner of the NBA), but they only played in the league's inaugural 1946‚Äì47 season, folding during the 1947 offseason. The NBA returned to Toronto in 1995 when the Raptors joined the league. That same year, the Vancouver Grizzlies began play, but moved to Memphis in 2001. International expansion Some of the Big Four sports leagues have looked to expand their revenues by playing overseas games in attempt to develop a wider international fan base. =NFL= American football is the member of the top four major league sports with the least international exposure. The NFL has attempted to promote its game worldwide by scheduling selected pre-season games since 1976 in Mexico, Europe, Australia, and Japan. The NFL had promoted the game abroad through NFL Europe, but that league was never profitable and ceased operations in 2007. In 2005, the NFL held its first regular-season game outside the United States. The matchup in Mexico City between the San Francisco 49ers and Arizona Cardinals drew a crowd of over 103,000 to Azteca Stadium (a 1994 crowd of over 112,000 at Azteca Stadium is the largest to attend a pre-season game). The NFL then began its International Series, holding at least one regular-season game at Wembley Stadium in London every year since 2007. Preliminary talks to expand the NFL season with each team playing one game overseas was curtailed because the expansion was not approved in labor negotiations. The 2013 season was the first of four years in which the Jacksonville Jaguars played one home game at Wembley Stadium, and the league held a second game that did not involve the Jaguars at Wembley in 2013. Jaguars owner Shahid Khan purchased London-based soccer club Fulham, at the time in the Premier League, in July 2013. In October 2013, the NFL announced that three games would be played at Wembley in the 2014 season, with the Atlanta Falcons and Oakland Raiders joining the Jaguars in taking a home game to London. The league openly acknowledged \\"that all three franchises are dissatisfied with their current stadium situations\\", although it noted that the Falcons were preparing to build a new stadium in Atlanta. There has been talk of expanding the International Series to Ireland, where the owner of the Pittsburgh Steelers is currently serving as US ambassador. =Other leagues= There has been increasing cooperation between the NBA and the Euroleague. In 2005, the two bodies agreed to organize a summer competition known as the NBA Europe Live Tour featuring four NBA teams and four Euroleague clubs, with the first competition taking place in 2006.

He entered the Army in 1805 as an ensign in the Scots Fusilier Guards, now known as the Scots Guards. He accompanied the regiment when it was posted to the Peninsular and was present at the passage of the Douro, the capture of Oporto and the pursuit of General Soult's army. He was later present at the Battle of Talavera in July 1809, where he was wounded through the body. Left behind in hospital when the Army retreated, he was made prisoner by the enemy. In 1811, he was promoted to Lieutenant and Captain in the Scots Fusilier Guards, in 1815 to Captain and Lieutenant-Colonel, in 1837 Brevet-Colonel in the army and in 1837 to Major and Colonel in the regiment. From 1841 to 1844 he was appointed to the command of the regiment, after which he was placed on half- pay. He was made Major-General in 1846 and Lieutenant-General in 1854. In 1854 he was given the colonelcy of the 36th (Herefordshire) Regiment of Foot, a position he held until his death, and advanced to the rank of full General on 23 March 1861.

Specifications  She had a 580 tonne displacement and was 49.21 m long along the waterline and 55.47 m long in total. At her widest point she was 9.72 m and across her wheel arches she was 17.1 m wide. Her maximum draught was 3.96 m and her propulsion were two paddle wheels driven by two horizontal single-cylinder reciprocating steam engines manufactured by Miller Ravenhill, a London firm. The engine produced about 950 PSi and gave her a speed of 9 knots. Each wheel had twelve blades and a diameter of 5.79 m. The engines supplied three boilers generating around 1 atm steam pressure, housed with the engines themselves in a 16.15 m long engine room. She carried 200 tonnes of coal to power the engines, but was also rigged as a two-masted schooner. Her armament was six 68-pounder guns and her crew was five officers and 145 NCOs and men.Gr√∂ner, Erich: Die deutschen Kriegsschiffe 1815‚Äì1945. Bd. 1, S. 108.

She was launched as Cora in 1848 - the exact date is unknown. She cost 150,000 taler. Under a British flag she sailed to Bremerhaven, where she was transferred to the German Confederation and renamed Ernst Augustus, entering service in October 1848. According to L√ºder Arenhold, she was \\"a very nice model\\" (\\"ein sehr h√ºbsches Modell\\") and according to several contemporary sources the most beautiful ship in the German fleet. She is said to have reached 11 knots during her proving trials.L√ºder Arenhold: Die deutsche Reichsflotte 1848-1852, Berlin 1906 On 12 December 1852 she was auctioned at Brake, Lower Saxony and bought by the London-based General Steam Navigation Company, which renamed her Edinburgh and from March 1853 used her for voyages to Europe. In March 1855 she travelled to Varna, Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire, where she was lost under unknown circumstances. Varna was then a logistics centre for Turkey, France and Britain whilst they fought the Crimean War and so Edinburgh seems to have been serving as a transport ship.

As an athlete he specialises in the long jump, but also competes in sprint events. Personal career J√∏rgensen was born in Vejle, Denmark in 1993. As a youth he was a keen sportsman and took up both snowboarding and gymnastics. In 2008, whilst attempting a double front flip on a trampoline at a gymnastic show he landed badly and dislocated his knee. In the resulting surgery, doctors were forced to amputate his leg. Athletics career As sprinting was part of his old gymnastics training, J√∏rgensen found he had a talent for running as a disability athlete, taking up disability athletics in 2010. Classified as a T42 athlete, J√∏rgensen first represented Denmark at an international level when he was chosen for the national team at the 2011 IPC Athletics World Championships in Christchurch, New Zealand. In Christchurch he took part in the 100m and 200m sprints but failed to make a podium finish in either events. The following year he was part of the Denmark team that travelled to London to take part in the 2012 Summer Paralympics. There he entered three events, the 100m and 200m sprint, and the long jump, in which he finished third, to claim his first international medal. In 2013 J√∏rgensen attended his second World Championship, held in Lyon, where as well as the sprints, he entered the long jump, finishing just outside the medals in fourth place. The following year he attended the 2014 IPC Athletics European Championships in Swansea where he took three medals, a bronze in the 200m and two silvers in the 100m and long jump. J√∏rgensen showed continual improvement in the buildup to the Rio Paralympics, by winning medals in all three of his events at the 2015 World Championships in Doha. The following year, J√∏rgensen took gold in the long jump at the 2016 European Championships with a distance of 6.70 metres. This led to a season of tournaments which saw J√∏rgensen and German rival Heinrich Popow exchange the World record distance on several occasions. Snowboarding career J√∏rgensen began snowboarding while a child and continued to enjoy the sport after his accident. Classified as an SB-LL boarder, he represented Denmark at the 2015 Snowboarding World Championships in La Molina. He entered two events, the snowboard cross and the banked slalom, winning a bronze medal in the latter.

Their services include routes to Sandakan, Malaysia and over Dapitan City to Dumaguete City. They also ship cargo from Zamboanga City to Manila with twelve of their container carriers. History The company was founded on October 1, 1976, and its first vessel MV Estrella del Mar transported passengers and cargo, mainly rice, to the neighboring islands. In 1980, the company acquired its first cargo vessel, thus the debut of MV Aleson. The company expanded in the 1980s with more cargo ships, along with voyages to Singapore for trade and commerce purposes. During the 1990s the company concentrated on the passenger and roll-on/roll-off ferry sector. Additional vessels were added to carry more passengers and travel on more routes. In 1994, a new route between Zamboanga Port and Sandakan Port, Malaysia was opened in response to the development of BIMP-EAGA routes. Aleson's MV Danica Joy was one of the first vessels that sailed on this route. In 1999, the company expanded into containerizing cargo, with the addition of new container carriers. The first fast craft of the corporation was bought on 2004 and was named MV Seajet. At present, Aleson operates a fleet of 36 vessels and is the largest shipping operator in Western Mindanao.

Akhtar is Honorary Fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies (ISAS), a research institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS). Political struggle =People's Rights Movement (PRM)= Akhtar was a coordinator of the People's Rights Movement (PRM) from 2002 to 2012; PRM was a left-wing confederation of working-class movements in Pakistan. As a representative of PRM, Akhtar was a strong supporter of Okara's peasant movement and Anjuman Mazarain Punjab, (AMP). He organised rallies under the banner of PRM along with memebrs of different trade unions against anti-worker policies and privatization of public utilities. In November 2007, he was arrested in Lahore with seventy other civil society activists for participating in an anti-government meeting held at the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan during the Pakistani state of emergency, 2007. In February 2010, PRM merged with the National Workers Party and the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party to form the Workers Party Pakistan. =Workers Party Pakistan= Akhtar was associated with Workers Party Pakistan (WPP) from February 2010 to November 2012. =Awami Workers Party= Akhtar is among the founders of Awami Workers Party. On November 11, 2012, the Workers Party Pakistan merged with two other left-wing parties, Awami Party and Labour Party to form the Awami Workers Party. He was member of the first federel committee, later on December 16, 2012, he was elected as general secretary of AWP Punjab. On March 16, 2014, Akhtar was elected as President of AWP Punjab in AWP Punjab Congress held in Lahore. While serving as the president of AWP Punjab he took part actively in organising the slum dwellers of the capital territory of Islamabad against forced evictions and moved a petition against Capital Development Authority (CDA) to stop evictions from slums. Akhtar served as chairman of the All-Pakistan Alliance for Katchi Abadis (informal settlements or slums) which was an association of slum-dwellers from across Pakistan, formed in 1999 to protect the rights of the millions of slum residents across the country, against forced evictions and homelessness and to speak for the need for low-income housing in Pakistan. In 2001, under Pervez Musharraf‚Äôs era according to the Katchi Abadi Policy 2001, kachi abadis were given orders to provide urban squatters security through re-settlement and regularization. Despite this policy, forced evictions of residents from katchi abadis continued which led to protests and demonstrations by the All Pakistan Katchi Abadi Alliance. In 2002, residents of four abadis were alloted plots in Alipur Farash under ‚ÄòModern Shelter Urban Programme‚Äô, according to which out of the total 41 Katchi Abadis of the capital, only 11 have been recognized by the CDA, the rest were to be demolished without providing alternative shelter for the residents. Despite having pledged to transform Alipur Farash into a ‚Äúmodel town‚Äù for the working class, the CDA failed to provide even basic amenities for its residents, development has remained incomplete for years. Female members of All Pakistan Katchi Abadi Alliance from Alipur Farash protested many times for provision of basic facilities. In 2014, hundreds of kachi abadis' residents along with All-Pakistan Alliance for Katchi Abadis, held protests against the Capital Development Authority‚Äôs (CDA) plans to bulldoze katchi abadis in Islamabad. On July 30, 2015, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) along with rangers, police and local administration demolished dozens of houses in informal settlement of I-11/1,Islamabad which were built 30 years ago. On August 2, 2015, to stop these forced evictions and to find ways for urban housing crisis in informal settlements of I-11/1, Akhtar along with residents from Kachi Abadis, filed a petition in the Supreme Court for the case on the right to housing. The petition requested that the court declare the residents of katchi abadis of the capital territory entitled to the benefits conferred under Articles 9, 10A and 25 of the Constitution and the state is bound to provide the residents of katchi abadis shelter and other amenities as per the Constitution and the National Housing Policy 2001.

Photo by R.W. Poultney 1986 The WA70 experiment was a collaboration between the Universities of Geneva, Glasgow, Liverpool, Milan and Neuchatel using the facilities of the OMEGA spectrometer at CERN. The purpose of the experiment was to study direct photons produced in proton-proton and proton-pion collisions within a fixed target of liquid hydrogen at the CERN SPS. The experiment was proposed on 6 August 1980 and formally approved on 22 October 1981. Preliminary data was taken in 1983 with physics runs in 1984, 1985 and 1986. A novel feature of the experiment was a liquid scintillator calorimeter, which was built in quadrants and designed to measure the energy of direct photons and other particles produced by the collisions. This was situated downstream of the liquid hydrogen target. Results were presented at scientific conferences and published in scientific journals. The measured cross section for direct photon production was in agreement with predictions from perturbative QCD. The spokesperson for the experiment was Professor Michel Martin, and participants included Dr. Fabiola Gianotti (who went on to become CERN's first woman Director General).

The memorial, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, was unveiled in 1921 and is today a grade II listed building. Background In the aftermath of the First World War and its unprecedented casualties, thousands of war memorials were built across Britain. Amongst the most prominent designers of memorials was the architect Sir Edwin Lutyens, described by Historic England as \\"the leading English architect of his generation\\". Lutyens designed the Cenotaph on Whitehall in London, which became the focus for the national Remembrance Sunday commemorations, as well as the Thiepval Memorial to the Missing‚Äîthe largest British war memorial anywhere in the world‚Äîand the Stone of Remembrance which appears in all large Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries and in several of Lutyens's civic war memorials. Many of Lutyens' commissions for war memorials originated from friends or pre-war clients in the area. In Lower Swell it appears the commission was made through Mark Fenwick, a regular client for whom Lutyens renovated his nearby house, Abbotswood in the early 1900s.Skelton, p. 83.Skelton, p. 172. History and design The memorial consists of a sculpture of a flaming, bulbous urn, which stands on a square pedestal and base of three shallow steps, all in limestone ashlar. It stands on a green in the centre of the village. The south-west side of the pedestal is inscribed: IN MEMORY OF THE MEN OF NETHER SWELL WHO GAVE THEIR LIVES IN THE GREAT WARS\\". The south-east and north-west sides bear the dates of the First and Second World Wars in Roman numerals: MCMXIV ‚Äì MCMXIX and MCMXXXIX ‚Äì MCMXLV respectively. On the north-east side are the names of the fallen. The inscriptions relating to the Second World War and the \\"s\\" in \\"Great Wars\\" were added at a later date, one of a variety of ways in which First World War memorials were adapted to take account of the casualties from the Second World War. The memorial was unveiled on 31 July 1921 by Colonel Brooke, DSO, of the Grenadier Guards. Lower Swell War Memorial was designated a grade II listed building on 25 August 1960. In March 2015, as part of commemorations for the centenary of the First World War, Lutyens' war memorials were recognised as a \\"national collection\\" and all of his free- standing memorials in England were listed or had their listing status reviewed and their National Heritage List for England list entries were updated and expanded.

Singapore Permanent Residents (PRs) have most of the rights, privileges, obligations, and responsibilities that citizens do, including National Service obligations (waived for most adult applicants but not for their male children) and compulsory Singapore Central Provident Fund contributions. Notable exceptions include not being able to vote or to hold public office, more limited public benefits such as medical and housing benefits, lower public (government supported) school placement priority, and some limits on driving for transport services. Singapore PRs are permitted to live, work, study, and retire in Singapore without any time limit. PR status is robust in practice but not absolute. PRs are subject to Re-Entry Permit (REP) requirements if they wish to leave Singapore for any length of time for any reason. If a PR leaves Singapore without a valid REP, or if a PR is outside Singapore when his/her REP expires, that individual's PR status automatically and, with rare exceptions, irrevocably ends. Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) generally renews REPs for 5 years, subject to PRs demonstrating some actual residence, and economic or other relevant activity, in Singapore. Starting in 2010, Singapore has set an approximately 30,000 annual cap on the number of individuals being granted Permanent Residence. There is a relatively stable population of just over 500,000 PRs in Singapore. Individuals eligible to apply for Singapore PR include: * spouses and unmarried children (below 21 years old) of Singapore citizens or permanent residents * aged parents and legal guardians of Singapore citizens * foreign workers in Singapore possessing valid work passes (Employment Pass, S-Pass), and their dependents (with some exceptions) * students studying in Singapore * investors and entrepreneurs Singapore's Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) processes PR applications in three different schemes: Family Ties, Professionals/Technical Personnel and Skilled Workers (PTS), and the Global Investor Programme (GIP). ICA receives applications through an online system, and applicants must pay a nonrefundable processing fee. Nobody has an automatic legal right to PR status; the government's PR decisions are entirely discretionary. The government does not disclose its evaluation criteria or decision processes beyond broad generalities, such as long-term citizen population-related goals. One of the government's stated public policy goals is to maintain relative stability in Singapore's racial and ethnic population proportions in order (in the government's view) to promote and maintain racial harmony. Consequently a PR applicant's race influences ICA's decisions. PR status is central to Singapore nationality law since naturalization as a Singaporean citizen requires that the applicant first be granted PR status. PRs can apply for citizenship if at least two years have passed since being granted PR. PRs (age 15 and older) are issued blue colored National Registration Identity Cards (NRICs).

The location had previously been a hotel with 9 bedrooms, but under Blunos, these were reduced to 4, and a 34-seat restaurant and an 8-seat private dining room were installed. Blunos closed the restaurant after 13 years, with a drop in advanced bookings from the United States blamed due to both the foot-and-mouth outbreak and the September 11 attacks. After the closure of Lettonie in September 2001, Blunos opened Blinis in Bath, two months later. This held two Michelin stars for a single edition of the guide in 2002. Menu The menu served at Lettonie was predominantly French in nature, although featured elements of Latvian cuisine. Dishes include a pork belly served with morels and a celeriac puree; at the time pork belly was an unusual dish to be served in a fine-dining restaurant. Blunos explained that he had originally had a pork tenderloin as well, but since diners preferred the belly dish, the fillet was dropped. The signature dish of the restaurant was scrambled duck egg, which was flamb√©ed tableside with vodka. This was then topped with Sevruga caviar, and served with both buckwheat and plain blinis as well as chilled vodka. A second dish which Blunos became well known for at Lettonie was one which appeared to be boiled egg and toast soldiers. It was however, a hollowed out egg filled with vanilla cream and mango coulis. This was then served with shortbread that had been sprinkled with sugar and grated chocolate. Reception Lettonie was first awarded a Michelin star in 1992 while located in Bristol. It was awarded a second star in 1994, and retained those when the restaurant moved to Bath in 1998 until it was permanently closed in 2001. In 1999, Harden's restaurant guide listed Lettonie as among the best in the country.

It is also closely affiliated with the Illinois School of Architecture.  History & mission  Illinois Solar Decathlon was formed in 2007 after the University's involvement in three past Solar Decathlon competitions. Starting in 2002, the US Department of Energy sponsors a biannual competition where twenty Universities from around the world design and construct an innovative and efficient net-zero home. They are transported to a central location and over the course of a week the homes are judged in ten different criteria including energy balance, architecture, communications, and market appeal to name a few. With ISD's increasing involvement in the Solar Decathlon's competition, Europe began having their own Solar Decathlon competitions in 2007, with China joining in a few years later in 2013. The RSO works to recruit future team members, maintain sponsor relations, and help maintain the three past homes that are near campus. ISD also aims to educate the campus and community about the importance of sustainable energy efficient homes and hope to provide a strong foundation for future Illinois Decathlon teams. ISD has focused on interdisciplinary teamwork and collaboration, with students in architecture, engineering and like disciplines working together on various projects. ISD is constantly searching for new members and there are many opportunities for involvement including working on past homes, marketing efforts, or even being part of the next design team.  Projects - Solar Decathlon Competitions  The Solar Decathlon competitions are intended to be a ‚Äúresearch goal of reducing the cost of solar-powered homes and advancing solar technology,‚Äù according to the Solar Decathlon 2007 (SD07). Illinois Solar Decathlon began its involvement with the Solar Decathlon competitions in the 2007 competition. = 2007 Illinois Solar Decathlon Project - ElementHouse = The 2007 Solar Decathlon Competition is the third competition held and the first time the University of Illinois competed in. The concept for the University of Illinois' Solar Decathlon Team's 2007 house is a flexible modular system that can provide utility- independent housing for temporary or seasonal use. Beyond the goal of winning the competition, Illinois hopes that its final product can serve as a model for emergency housing situations such as those experienced by citizens of the Gulf Coast as a result of Hurricane Katrina in 2005. = 2009 Illinois Solar Decathlon Project - Gable Home = Immediately following success in the 2007 competition, ISD began work on the 2009 competition entry. The primary concept of ISD's 2009 entry, named Gable Home, is to create a synthesis between innovative technology and vernacular Midwestern architecture. This synthesis results in a synergetic relationship between the two, creating an environmentally sustainable home of the future. The design exhibits a strong preference for reused/reclaimed materials over the production of new material. The siding of the house was reclaimed from a barn being deconstructed in Rockford, Illinois. The decking material was salvaged from a demolished grain silo in Champaign, Illinois. Restoring and repurposing material from farm structures strengthened the overall design emphasis on local vernacular architecture. = 2011 Illinois Solar Decathlon Project - Re_Home = For the 2011 Solar Decathlon competition, Team Illinois has designed the Re_home. For rapid assembly after a natural disaster, the solar powered home will demonstrate how environmentally aware living can be brought to the forefront of a community-led recovery effort. Through a carefully thought out process the Re_home can be pre-constructed and quickly deployed immediately following a natural disaster. When called upon, the house mobilizes quickly from its constructed location towards new communities. Upon arrival the house is assembled within several hours. Once sealed, the home becomes a livable space the day it arrives, providing new shelter for disaster victims. During the days following delivery the rest of the house can be assembled by members of the community. Pre-installed adjustable solar panels provide renewable energy quickly, and prefabricated modular decks, planters, and canopies ease installation of all exterior elements of the home. The 2011 competition team was led by Dr. Xinlei Wang, Ph.D. and Mark Taylor, AIA. To complement the leadership, members from the College of Agriculture, Consumer, and Environmental Sciences (ACES) joined the team, including David Weightman, James Anderson, Joe Harper, Sarah Taylor Lovell. = 2013 Illinois Solar Decathlon Project - Etho = The 2013 Solar Decathlon Competition featured the first ever Solar Decathlon competition held in China. For the 2013 competition, Illinois Solar Decathlon from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign designed their project in collaboration with Peking University in Beijing. The international team hopes that their house will increase public awareness for solar technology and promote low-carbon development. Etho is centered around a feeling of solace; an urban oasis. It meets the Chinese market‚Äôs need for a refuge from overcrowded cities and inspires the Chinese public to see the potential in a high-quality sustainability. Ethos‚Äôs design philosophy is centered on creating a better future, creating a link to China‚Äôs rich past, and sculpting a home perfectly suited to meet the needs of its inhabitants. Designed for the next generation of young families as a sustainable getaway, this solar-powered home will demonstrate how educating one influential demographic can help to spread awareness of environmental sustainability and energy. Its design emphasizes natural daylighting and maximizing solar gains on the PV arrays. Similar to the 2011 competition, the 2013 competition team was also led by Dr. Xinlei Wang, Ph.D. and Mark Taylor, AIA. Mike McCully, a professor at the Illinois School of Architecture, joined the leadership and assisted in the architectural aspects of the project. = 2017 Illinois Solar Decathlon Project - TBD = The 2017 Solar Decathlon Project will be led by Ryan Christiansen, Assoc.

One of the founders of Betar, he was a close associate of revisionist leader Ze'ev Jabotinsky, but later became a member of the labour party, Mapai. Binyamin Lubotzky was born in Riga, Governorate of Livonia, Russian Empire, and immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1925. His memoirs, Zikhronot min hayamin (Memories of the Right) describe his ideological shift to the left. According to the memoirs' editor Danny Rubinstein, Eliav could have been a rising star in Israeli politics, but failed due to his inability to deal with political intrigue. As a diplomat, he served as Israel's First Secretary in Buenos Aires and subsequently as Consul General in New York. He was also an editor of the Encyclopaedia Judaica.

George was descended from wool manufacturers who had risen to the lower ranks of the landed gentry,Tucker, \\"Jane Austen's Family\\", in . and Cassandra was a member of the aristocratic Leigh family. They married on 26 April 1764 at Walcot Church in Bath.Fergus, \\"Biography\\", in .Greene, \\"Jane Austen and the Peerage\\", in Watt, Jane Austen: A Collection of Critical Essays, 156‚Äì157. From 1765 to 1801 (for much of Jane's life), George was a rector of Anglican parishes in Steventon, Hampshire and a nearby village. Irene Collins estimates that when George Austen took up his duties as rector in 1764, Steventon comprised no more than about thirty families.Collins, 86. From 1773 to 1796, he supplemented his income by farming and teaching three or four boys at a time (who boarded at his home). Austen's immediate family was large‚Äîsix brothers and one sister: * James (1765‚Äì1819) * George (1766‚Äì1838) * Edward (1768‚Äì1852) * Henry Thomas (1771‚Äì1850) * Cassandra Elizabeth (1773‚Äì1845) * Francis William (Frank) (1774‚Äì1865) * Charles John (1779‚Äì1852) Her sister Cassandra was an artist, and like Jane, did not marry. She was Austen's closest friend and confidante throughout her life.Fergus, \\"Biography\\", in . James (matriculated 1779, BA 1783, MA 1788) and Henry (matriculated 1788, BA 1792, MA 1796) were both educated at St John's College, Oxford, as their father had been. Together they edited a literary magazine, The Loiterer. An accomplished poet, James was ordained as an Anglican clergyman, succeeding his father as rector of Steventon. Of her brothers Austen felt closest to Henry, who became a soldier, then a banker, then (after his bank failed) an Anglican clergyman. Henry was also his sister's literary agent. Henry's large circle of friends and acquaintances in London included bankers, merchants, publishers, painters and actors and he provided Austen with a view of social worlds not normally visible from a small parish in rural Hampshire. He married their first cousin (and Jane's close friend), Eliza de Feuillide. George was sent to live with a local family at a young age because, according to Austen biographer Le Faye, he was \\"mentally abnormal and subject to fits\\"; he may also have been deaf and mute. Charles and Frank served in the navy, both rising to the rank of admiral. Edward was adopted by his fourth cousin, Thomas Knight, inheriting Knight's estate and taking his name in 1812.Tucker, \\"Jane Austen's Family\\", in .
