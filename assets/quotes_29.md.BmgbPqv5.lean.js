Battle of Ourique There is no certainty about the exact location of the battle of Ourique, although it is typically said to have taken place in the countryside between the towns of Castro Verde and Ourique. Five Muslim kings allied their forces against the Portuguese army, but after a terrible and lengthy fight, the allied forces were scattered was lost in the Alentejo plains. This would later be considered by the Portuguese to have been a divine miracle, forever forming part of the legend of Castro Verde.A History of Portugal, pp. 64, 65. According to most accounts of the legend, Afonso Henriques was visited before the battle by an old man who saw in a dream that Henriques would be victorious because God would intervene to help him. The old man advised the Henriques to leave the encampment alone when he heard the bell of the local chapel. Riding off, Henriques was surprised by a ray of light that showed him (in one interpretation) the sign of the cross and Jesus Christ on a crucifix. He knelt in its presence and heard the voice of Jesus Christ telling him he would defeat the Moors. The following day, he succeeded in routing the Moors (through his own courage and faith, as the stories go) and was almost immediately declared the king of Portugal. He would include five shields in his coat of arms, representing the five defeated kingdoms. To honor the outstanding victory, then-King D. Sebasti√£o later ordered the construction of St. Peter of the Heads Chapel.

In 2011, the population was 7,274,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of approximately : it is the sixth-largest municipality in Portugal. Meanwhile, it is the second-lowest population centre by density with approximately 5.62 persons/ (second to the adjacent Alcoutim). The seat of the municipality is the town of M√©rtola, which has around 2800 inhabitants (2011), located on a hill over the Guadiana River. Its strategic location made it an important fluvial commercial port in Classical Antiquity, through the period of Umayyad conquest of Hispania: M√©rtola's main church (the Church of Nossa Senhora da Anuncia√ß√£o) was the only medieval mosque to have survived the period in Portugal. In 2017 M√©rtola started the process to become a UNESCO World Heritage site. History M√©rtola castle, M√©rtola, Portugal View of M√©rtola, over the Guadiana River. The main church (igreja matriz), originally a mosque, is in the foreground. During Classical Antiquity, M√©rtola was inhabited by Phoenicians, Carthaginians and finally the Romans, who called it Myrtilis Iulia. The strategic location of M√©rtola, on a hill by the northernmost navigable part of the Guadiana river, was crucial in its early development. Agricultural products grown in the villae nearby and valuable minerals (silver, gold and tin) obtained from the lower Alentejo region were sent from the fluvial port of M√©rtola via the Guadiana to Southern Hispania and the Mediterranean. Between 1st and 2nd century, Myrtilis, was part of the larger Pacensis region (under the capital Beja/Pax Julia), acquired a great importance, as a dynamic commercial centre, permitting it to mint its own coin. The town was raised to the status of a Municipium in times of Emperor Augustus and was connected to important Roman cities (Beja, √âvora) through a road system. During the Migration Period, M√©rtola was invaded by Germanic tribes of the Sueves and the Visigoths. In this period (5th-8th centuries) commerce was reduced but still active, as evidenced by Greek tombstones from the 6th-7th centuries found in M√©rtola which suggest the presence of Byzantine merchants in the town. =Moors= Around the year 711, Hispania was invaded by the Moors from the Maghreb, inaugurating a period of great influence of Islamic culture in the Alentejo region that would last over 400 years. M√©rtola - then called Martulah - and its port played an important economic role in the commerce of agricultural and mineral goods between the Alentejo and other parts of Al-Andalus (Arab Hispania) and Northern Africa. M√©rtola had a wall dating from Roman times, but the Muslims built new fortifications and, eventually, a castle to protect it from rival Muslim and Christian states. After the fall of the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba, in 1031, M√©rtola became an independent taifa state, until it was conquered by the taifa of Seville in 1044-1045. Between 1144 and 1150 the town was again seat of an independent state led by Ibn Qasi, a mystic and skilled military leader who unified Southern Portugal and fought the power of the Almoravides. The independence of the region, however, was soon ended by an invading Almohad army. The most important remnant from the Islamic period in Portugal is M√©rtola's ancient mosque, built in the second half of the 12th century and later turned into a church, but where many of its original architectural characteristics were preserved. =Reconquista= In 1238, in the context of the Reconquista, the town was conquered by Portuguese King Sancho II, putting an end on several centuries of Islamic rule in the M√©rtola region. The town was donated to the Knights of the Order of Santiago, a Military Order that played a vital role in the Christian conquest of Southern Portugal. The seat of the Order was established in M√©rtola until 1316. From the Reconquista time date most of the castle, including its mighty keep, and a letter of feudal rights (foral), granted in 1254.The economic importance of M√©rtola and the Guadiana faded after the Reconquista. In the 15th-16th centuries, when the Portuguese conquered several cities in the Maghreb, M√©rtola experienced a brief revival in its economic relevance, supplying Portuguese troops in Northern Africa with cereals. King Manuel I granted a new foral to the town in 1512. =Modern= After a long period of economic stagnation, the discovery of copper in the S. Domingos mines led to a new wave of development that would end abruptly in 1965, when the mine was exhausted. In the next decades, the municipality lost much of its population, who emigrated to richer parts of Portugal and other European countries. Starting in the 1980s, a series of archaeological surveys brought to light various remnants of past periods of M√©rtola, and the town became an important cultural touristic site. Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Administratively, the municipality is divided into 7 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alcaria Ruiva * Corte do Pinto * Esp√≠rito Santo * M√©rtola * Santana de Cambas * S√£o Jo√£o dos Caldeireiros * S√£o Miguel do Pinheiro, S√£o Pedro de Solis e S√£o Sebasti√£o dos Carros Culture =Main sights= * The castle of M√©rtola, located on the highest point of the town. The current building dates from a reconstruction carried out by the knights of the Order of Saint James of the Sword after the town was taken by the Christians. The most notable feature of the castle is its 30-metre-high keep tower, finished around 1292, which has an inner hall covered with Gothic vaulting. The defences include a city wall, which still encircles the town. * Main church (the Matriz), originally a mosque built between the 12th and 13th centuries. After the Christian conquest of the town, in 1238, the mosque was turned into a church, but its architectonic structure was left unaltered. In the 16th century the church was partially remodelled, gaining Manueline vaulting with a new roof and a new main portal in Renaissance style. Nevertheless, the inner arrangement of the naves of the church, with four naves and several columns, strongly resembles that of the original mosque, and the interior of the church still has the mihrab, the decorated niche that indicates the direction of the Mecca. Outside, the church has four portals with horseshoe arches, typical of Islamic architecture. * The museum of M√©rtola, consisting mostly of archaeological findings and excavations, with collections distributed all over the town. The nucleus of Islamic art in the museum is the most important in Portugal. It consists of various objects (pottery, glassware, metalwork, coins) dating from that period. The collection is housed in the old cellars of the noblemen of the House of Braganza. Other exhibits include remnants of an ancient Christian church, of the basilica type, with an active cult lasting from the 5th to the 8th century. It has a large collection of palaeochristian tombstones with inscriptions; and excavations of a Roman house found under the Municipality building. =Festivals= * Festival Isl√¢mico de M√©rtola - Celebrating the Islamic cultural connection between Islam and Mertola.

The population in 2011 was 7,276,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 569.44 km2. Castro Verde is situated in the Baixo Alentejo subregion, within a territory known locally as the Campo Branco (). The municipality can be recognized by the local municipal markers along its borders, that appear within its borders to denote its reference as A Window on the Plains; municipal markers appear as stylized house profiles, with an exaggerated window that allows the visitor to see through into the panorama.  History  Syllabary of Espan√ßa, an ancient stone with evidence of Phoenician influences in the region 'D. Afonso Henriques', azulejo of the monarch in the Royal Basilica of Castro Verde dedicated to the Battle of Orique The 1510 Charter of the town of Castro Verde promulgated by Manuel I of Portugal The pre-History of the Baixo Alentejo Subregion dates back to 200,000 B.C. when the territory was crossed by migratory Neanderthal peoples from the north of Europe in the Lower Paleolithic period. Until their extinction, around 28,000 B.C., Neanderthal man hunted and foraged in present-day Portugal. Later, the area was home to several cultures due to the abundance of minerals and its commercial and strategic place along the Mediterranean. The earliest settlements began with Celtiberians, from the central Iberian Peninsula around the 6th Century B.C., and were followed by the Celts. From the 3rd Century, tribal clans were replaced by organized oppidum, a fortified organized city with a defined territory that included many castro villages constructed from large boulders or earthworks. The first evidence of early cultures in the area of Castro Verde was the discovery of the 'Syllabary of Espan√ßa', which was found near the village of Neves-Corvo in the civil parish of Santa B√°rbara de Padr√µes. This archaeological stone contains a Southwest Paleohispanic script, using Tartessian script and language, identified as being the most ancient paleohispanic script; related to the Phoenician alphabet, it is the closest European connection to the Phoenician culture. The Tartessian culture was the precursors of the Turdetani peoples of the Roman period. Growth of settlements during the classic period were likely associated with the strategic importance of the Iberian Pyrite zone. Castro Verde lies along a transport route linking the mines of Aljustrel (20 km to the north) with the port city of M√©rtola (40 km to the east) situated on tributaries of the Guadiana river. During the Roman occupation, the extensive mining and warehousing of minerals required protective fortifications and mineral warehouses: in the Castro Verde territory there are remains of more than 20 such small structures. Along with mining activities, the area became a vast area of grain production and cattle/sheep-grazing. The richness and abundance of these combined 'base economies' grew to such extent that Castro Verde became a regional centre of commerce and thus a crossroad of cultures within the Mediterranean area. The name origin of Castro Verde dates back to this early period, with two interpretations cited for its name. One postulates that the name was derived from the Roman Castra Castrorum and combined the verde (meaning \\"green\\") to indicate new. A more consistent interpretation is that the name was derived from Castrum Veteris, meaning the oldest castro, to differentiate it from another castro that existed on a small plateau (where the Chapel of S√£o Martinho exists) and was abandoned during the Middle Ages. The term castro derived from the Latin castrum refers to a small military encampment or fortification, built of large rocks. Roman occupation spanned four centuries and was followed by the migration of the Visigoths (300-700 A.C.) their expulsion by the Moors (in 711), and in turn, their expulsion from the area during the Christian Reconquista. The Battle of Ourique, where Afonso I triumphed over five Moorish Kings occurred in S√£o Pedro das Cabe√ßas, approximately five kilometres from the village of Castro Verde, and paved the way for the creation of the Kingdom of Portugal (in the Treaty of Zamora in 1143). As the legend of the Battle describes, the battle lasted two days (between 24‚Äì25 July 1139) and was so excessively bloody that the waters of Ribeira de Cobres flowed the color of red. Afonso Henriques who was declared Prince of Portugal, after the Battle of S√£o Mamede, defeated the Moorish kings (at the Battle of Ourique), and was then proclaimed King upon the victory. But, although King Afonso was able to triumph, the region was never definitely secured by the Portuguese until the regin of King Sancho II, around 1234, when the Castle of Aljustrel was captured. Later, the Royal Basilica of Castro Verde was commissioned by King Sebastian of Portugal in 1573 to mark the Christian victory over the Moors, with the walls of the central nave covered in azulejos immortalizing the famous battle. The region of Castro Verde passed into the possession of the priory of the Comenda de Santiago, and its donat√°rios, the Dukes of Aveiro. Castro Verde continued to operate as the central administrative centre and municipal seat, while Cas√©vel and Entradas won administrative autonomy.The other centres pertain to other municipalities: Santa B√°rbara de Padr√µes belongs to the municipality of Padr√µes and S√£o Marcos da Atabueira pertains to M√©rtola. While mineral extraction continued to drive the economy, herding assumed a fundamental part of the regions economy as well. During the 16th and 17th Century, the Campos de Ourique became the destination for many herds from Castela and Serra da Estrela, creating a new economic, social and cultural dimension to the municipality. Although the human ecology of this territory has been marked by the settlement of many civilizations all based on mining, cereal cultivation and cattle/sheep grazing, it was only in the beginning of the 14th century that territories became organized as distinct economic entities within the new kingdom. During this post-reconquista era, the vast pasture-lands of the Castro Verde area were granted to nobility by King Denis (the Farmer King) which resulted in the management of thousands of hectares under rotational cultivation to become the bread basket of Portugal and the most important pastureland of the country. Over the centuries, the territory has been continually influenced by a transhumance which has left a unique cultural identity in the form of architecture, arts, music, song, and poetry expressing the daily activities of a people living on the land. In the middle of the 19th century, the surrounding municipal districts were reorganized and Castro Verde was formalized within its current boundaries: it had received its town charter (Foral) in 1510 by King Manuel I of Portugal. The municipality of Castro Verde developed its own particular cultural identity based on millenniums of interchange between cultural groups. From roots in mining and agricultural, the community has transformed into a city, with future plans focused on the integration of Roman and Islamic architecture in modern eco-architecture. Cultural tourism has resurged to keep alive traditional art, music and poetry indigenous to the territory. The year 2010 marked year-long festivities to celebrate the 500th anniversary of the town charters of Castro Verde and Cas√©vel. Geography =Physical geography= thumb thumb The Castro Verde area is made up of extensive areas of rolling hills, geomorphological structures referred to as a peneplains, which vary in altitude from 300 to 900 ft (100‚Äì300 m.) above sea level. The area has planar relief, with a medium altitude of approximately 200 metres; the lowest point is about 110 metres, in the civil parish of S√£o Marcos da Atabueira, near the Ribeira de Cobres (in northeast frontier with the municipality of Beja). The highest point, at 299 metres, is located at a geodesic marker (Urza) on the Cerro da Bandeira, within the civil parish of Castro Verde. Slopes in this area are between 0-2% grade, although pronounced (15%) along the ravines of Cobres and Maria Delgada, and the vicinity of Ribeira de Oeiras (near the border with Almod√¥var). In addition to these rivers, the municipality is crossed by other ribeiras (English: ravines or rivers): Ribeira de Alvacar, Ribeira da Fontinha, Ribeira de Terges, Ribeira da Chada, Ribeira da Sete and Ribeira da Gata. The soils within the municipality are considered poor, having a reduced capacity to support agriculture, and thus limiting its productive use historically. The subsoils are made-up of essentially granular schists, greywacke, sandstone, and in some areas quartzite, as well as rare volcanic metamorphic particulates with reduced permeability. Further, the municipality of Castro Verde is crossed by the Iberian Pyrite Belt, composed of a massive volcanogenic sulfide deposit (VMS) associated with the polymetallic flanks of volcanic cones in the form of pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena and cassiterite, that begins in Aljustrel, spreads through the lower Alentejo and extends into southern Spain.D. Mellado, et al. (2006) At a time when Portugal was separated by the sea from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula, a series of events connected to active and hydrothermal volcanism, lead to the formation of the volcano-sedimentary Pyrite complex (when the landmass of Portugal collided into the Iberian peninsula). Castro Verde lies on one of the most important extractive deposits in Europe, that is responsible for sustaining the economy of the region, albeit an area with elevated risk of erosion. Mining activity, as a consequence, dates back thousands of years, with the remains of Roman mining structures identifying the importance of this area to the expansion of Roman metallurgy. In addition to sulfide ore, this southern area of Lusitania, was an abundant source of other minerals, such as gold, silver, copper, tin, lead and iron. = Ecoregions/protected areas = A large part of the municipality is covered by the European Union's Natura 2000 project; it is denoted as a Special Protection Area (SPA) for endangered species of steppe birds such as the great bustard and lesser kestrel.Nuno Sarmento, 2000 = Climate = The Atlantic Ocean has little influence in this area where rain falls mainly in autumn and winter, typical of a Mediterranean climate, Csa under the K√∂ppen-Geiger climate classification system, sub-humid, with hot dry summers and mild humid winters. The medium annual temperature falls normally between 15.5 and 16 ¬∞C. During the warmer months (June and September) that maximum temperature can reach or exceed 43 ¬∞C; during the winter, temperature can fall to 10 ¬∞C (between December and March). Medium precipitation levels range around 500 mm, primarily between November and March (the rainy season), while July and August are driest. =Human geography= Castro Verde Municipality is situated within an area commonly known as ‚ÄúCampo Branco‚Äù, within the plains of the Alentejo that front the Serra do Caldeir√£o.Agro.Ges, 2005, p.7 It is located in the district of Beja, and limited to the north by the municipalities of Beja and Aljustrel, south by the municipality of Almod√¥var, east by the municipality of M√©rtola and west by the municipality of Ourique. Over the past few decades, the population has generally concentrated in the larger urban communities. In 1970, the population of the municipality was 9004 inhabitants, decreasing to 7472 by 1981. Ten years later, it had grown slowly to 7786 residents, although the recent census (2001) indicated a small decrease (fixed at 7603 inhabitants). The literacy rates are relatively high, although 15.7% are considered illiterate.I.S.S. I.P - CDSS Beja, ed, 2008, p.4 This is accentuated by 70% of the resident population having attained only a primary school level of education. Parishes Castro Verde Municipality, showing the constituent parts (freguesias) More than 50% of these residents live in the town of Castro Verde (4820 residents); the remaining towns account for the rest: Cas√©vel, 365 inhabitants; Entradas, 774 inhabitants; Santa B√°rbara dos Padr√µes, 1271 inhabitants; and S√£o Marcos da Atabueira, 373 inhabitants. With an area 567.2 km2, these communities are scattered in various medium to small localities divided into four civil parishes (Portuguese: freguesias): * Castro Verde e Cas√©vel * Entradas * Santa B√°rbara de Padr√µes * S√£o Marcos da Ataboeira Economy Population growth has primarily been the result developments with the mining industry, and in particular the Neves-Corvo mining complex. Its activities, and related services, civil construction and public works have seen reciprocal growth in municipal services and population. There has also been a parallel growth in mining jobs related to this development, since 1979. There is a hierarchical distribution of the active workforce: 11.12% are employed in the primary sector, 32.7% in secondary industries, while a majority (56.18%) are employed in tertiary services.I.S.S. I.P - CDSS Beja, ed, 2008, p.3 This distribution is generally maintained in all communities in the municipality, except Santa B√°rbara dos Padr√µes, where the Neves-Corvo mine is the main employer, and Entradas, where some agriculture and ranching occur. Transport Castro Verde is located in a privileged location along a corridor that connects the northern districts to the Algarve, and fundamental access to communication lines: The airports in Faro (100 km), Lisbon (190 km) and Sevilha (270 km) and the maritime port of Sines (95 km) are conveniently located to access other major centres. Connections to other locations within the country are made through the road network: to the Litoral Alentejo through Ourique (E.N. 123); to the coastal Algarve (along the A2 and I.C.1); to Lisbon via the A2; to M√©rtola (on the E.N. 123); to Almod√¥var (along the E.N.2); and to Beja and √âvora (on the I.P.2). Within the municipality, public transport connects all localities by at least one service (except on the weekends), and a national Express service connects Castro Verde communities to stations in Beja, √âvora, Lisbon and Algarve, in addition to Tomar, Coimbra, Porto, Braga and Elvas.

It had, around 9 May 1792, been modified to include a medallion with the image of Queen Maria II, whose bust was affixed under the words \\"...of the glorious apparition of Christ Our Father to our first monarch D. Afonso Henriques\\". During a hurricane, on the evening of the 7‚Äì8 December 1803, the monument was damaged at its narrowest point, but reconstructed. It was moved to the civic square in 1960, after being ruined by a lightning strike, wherein only the original staircase, base and the medallion survived the incident; * Source of Miracle of Saint Michael (), is a temple enclosing a water well, located outside of Castro Verde is situated on the property Herdade do Mour√£o and dates from 1714, having been built during the same period as the Chapel of S√£o Miguel. The Chapel is situated nearby on higher ground, but both were originally constructed over pre-existing structures of unconfirmed dates. In 1982, historian Ab√≠lio Pereira de Carvalho, appointed by his regent in Lisbon to research local history (and teach at the local high school), discovered more than 230 manuscripts under the main altar of the Basilica Real of Castro Verde. His study of the manuscripts revealed information relating the history of the Fonte de Milagre and Chapel of S√£o Miguel, leading him to write a 174-page book, all of which relate to the two sites and the healing activities carried out there for centuries. Published in 1989, by the municipal authority of Castro Verde, the factual material found in the manuscripts details the connection between the two locales and the healing properties of the 'Fonte' (noting regular visits by pilgrims from around the Iberian peninsula). The site's curative effects were of such significance that King John V (1706-1750) was compelled to become directly involved in the administration of the site.Ab√≠lio Pereira de Carvalho \\"Hist√≥ria de Uma Confraria (1677-1855)\\" (1989), Edi√ß√£o da C√¢mara Municipal de Castro Verde (1989),pgs. 15-16 The administration relationship between the \\"Chapel\\" and \\"Fonte\\" no longer exists and the rich heritage has been hidden from recent history, laying dormant for more than 150 years. However the chapel has been classified by IGESPAR as a Property of Public Interest; and in 2008, the Associa√ß√£o de S.

The first document relating to him is dated 3 December 1353, when he purchased the freedom of London. In February 1356 he was sufficiently well known as a mason that he was chosen as one of a commission of six cutting masons who were to inform the mayor and aldermen about the acts and articles of the craft. Career His first connection with royal building works was probably when he was contracted from March 1357 to September 1359 to remodel the Black Prince's manor at Kennington, at the cost of ¬£221 4s. 7d. On 23 June 1360, he was appointed \\"disposer\\" of the royal works at the Palace of Westminster and the Tower of London. For this he was paid 1s. per day, although he continued undertaking other, non-royal, commissions. At the Palace of Westminster, Yevele was responsible for refacing Westminster Hall, and for two essentially utilitarian buildings, the Jewel Tower in the Privy Palace (1365‚Äì6) and the clock tower (now destroyed), which stood opposite the north door of Westminster Hall and regulated the sittings of the royal courts of justice there (1366‚Äì7). At the Tower of London, Yevele was responsible for the Bloody Tower, while several minor works, including the vaulting of the thirteenth-century watergate, were performed by Henry's brother, Robert. The real focus of activity in the king's works at this time, however, was Windsor Castle. The master mason there, John Sponlee (d. 1382?), walked in the funeral procession of Queen Philippa in 1369 as an esquire of greater estate, whereas Yevele ranked only as a lesser esquire. During Edward III's reign Yevele's strictly architectural work for the crown was, with one minor exception, confined to London, but he supplied materials to numerous royal building sites in Kent and Surrey as well as in London. The most significant of Yevele's remaining works are the naves of Westminster Abbey (1362) and Canterbury Cathedral (1377‚Äì1400), the latter completed in an early Perpendicular Gothic style. Yevele advised on repairs and new works at the castles of Southampton (1378‚Äì9), Carisbrooke (1380‚Äì85), Winchester (1390‚Äì1400), and Portchester (1384‚Äì5), and on the town walls of Canterbury (1385‚Äì6), but it is uncertain to what extent this involved him in major design work. In 1381, 1389, and 1393 Yevele's advice was sought by William of Wykeham, bishop of Winchester, who had been clerk of works at Windsor Castle from 1356 to 1361. On 29 August 1390 Yevele was made exempt from jury and other forms of service on account of his official duties and \\"great age\\". Yevele's work for other lay patrons belonged to the 1370s and 1380s. For John of Gaunt he carried out in 1375 unspecified works at the Savoy Palace in London and, together with another mason, Thomas Wrek, he contracted for the duke's large and very sumptuous canopied tomb in Old St Paul's Cathedral. For John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham, he furnished the design (\\"devyse\\") for a new south aisle at the London parish church of St Dunstan-in-the-East, although he did not take charge of its building. From 1368 he served as one of the two wardens of London Bridge. Although the wardenships were purely administrative, it is highly likely that he was the designer of the two-storeyed apsidal chapel of St Thomas, which projected eastwards from the middle of the bridge and which was under construction between 1384 and 1397. The chapel possessed a \\"table\\" or handboard containing a summary history of the bridge, which was the source of the statement by the 16th-century antiquary John Leland that \\"a mason beinge master of the bridge howse\\", built the chapel at his own expense. This notice can refer only to Yevele, whose name presumably meant nothing to Leland. Death Yevele died in 1400 and was buried at the church of St Magnus the Martyr by London Bridge. His monument was extant in John Stow's time (the late 16th century), but was probably destroyed by the Great Fire of London.Wilson 2004. Work Works that can be attributed to Yevele with a reasonable level of certainty include: * Kennington Manor (part, 1358, destroyed) * Bloody Tower of the Tower of London (1361) * Abbot's House and College Hall, Westminster Abbey (1362) * Nave and west cloister, Westminster Abbey (1362) * Palace of Westminster clock tower (1365, destroyed) * Parts of old London Bridge (destroyed) * London Charterhouse (1371) *The high altar screen of Durham Cathedral (1372‚Äì80), shipped in boxes from London to Newcastle * Savoy Palace (part, 1376, destroyed) * West Gate, Canterbury (1378) * The east and south walks of the cloister of St Albans Abbey (probably begun c.1380) (not mentioned by Harvey) *The south transept fa√ßade of Old St Paul's Cathedral (1381‚Äì8) (not mentioned by Harvey) * Old St Dunstan-in-the- East (part, 1381, destroyed) * Rochester bridge (1383, destroyed) * Canterbury city walls (1385) * Nave and south cloister of Canterbury Cathedral (1377‚Äì1400) * Westminster Hall (1395) *The tombs of **Cardinal Simon Langham (d. 1376) in Westminster Abbey (1389) **Edward III in Westminster Abbey (after 1386) **Richard II in Westminster Abbey (1395) **Edward, the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral (1376) **Archbishop Simon Sudbury in Canterbury Cathedral (begun mid-1380s?

Written by Doug Petrie and directed by James A. Contner, it originally aired on November 16, 1999 on the WB network. In \\"The Initiative\\", Spike is imprisoned in an underground demon-research facility, and Riley realizes he has a crush on Buffy.  Plot Riley and a couple of friends, Forrest and Graham, watch Buffy as she manages to make a mess of the soda machine and yogurt machine. They comment on what a catch she is, and how interested they all are, but Riley is reluctant to make fun. Giles and Xander discover the commando guys are human and that their help will not be needed, again. Buffy arrives and while Giles tells her to patrol, she says she's going to party with Willow and hopefully cheer her up. Giles and Xander decided to patrol for her. Spike, having been knocked out by a Taser at the beginning of the previous episode, wakes up in a facility where various types of demons are held captive behind electrically charged barriers. A packet of blood drops from the ceiling into Spike's cell but before he drinks it, a vampire in the next cell - Tom, captured in \\"The Freshman\\" - warns him that doctors starve the vampires and then feed them drugged blood before doing experiments on them. Spike is quick to blame the Slayer for his misfortune. In class, Willow asks about Oz but Riley says he dropped out. After Willow tries to tell him that Oz will return, Professor Walsh informs her that he won't be back to her class, whereupon Willow abruptly leaves, saddened. Buffy approaches the professor, and tells her off, prompting Walsh to comment to Riley that she likes her. Forrest asks Parker about Buffy, and when Parker vulgarly brags about having sex with her, Riley punches him. Riley then realizes he likes Buffy. He visits Willow and asks her advice in wooing Buffy; Willow, still emotionally distressed, questions his motives, but eventually relents, listing some of Buffy's likes and interests. Spike lies on the floor of his cell, pretending to have drunk the drugged blood, and when the doctors come to get him he attacks. He escapes the Initiative and returns to Harmony's lair, telling her he's \\"back for good\\" - then immediately leaves to kill the Slayer. Xander later discovers Harmony crying, burning some of Spike's things. The two get into an inept slap-fight, and then mutually agree to stop. Harmony lets Xander know that Spike is back. At the party, Willow tries to help Riley flirt with Buffy, but his attempts are thwarted when Xander arrives to inform Buffy that Spike has returned. Riley is also called away; he and Forrest break away from the party and, after passing through several electronic checkpoints, go down a hidden elevator to the underground facility where Spike had been held. The operation's head, Professor Walsh, informs them that \\"Hostile 17\\" (Spike) has escaped, and the guys suit up. Riley gives orders to three teams that he sends out all over Sunnydale to find Spike. Riley's team spots Buffy sitting on a bench. Riley refuses to allow the team to use her as bait and goes out to get rid of her. Each unaware of the other's secret identity, Riley and Buffy try to send each other out of harm's way. Meanwhile, Spike has found Buffy's dorm through the school computer system. Willow, moping in her room, hears a knock on the door and invites the person in without thinking. Spike swaggers through the door and attempts to bite Willow, but is stopped by an intense pain in his head. After a short, calm dialogue with multiple metaphorical references to impotence (ex: \\"I know I'm not the kind of girl vamps like to sink their teeth into. It's always like 'Ooh, you're like a sister to me,' or 'Oh, you're such a good friend.'\\" \\"Don't be ridiculous. I'd bite you in a heartbeat.\\"), Willow hits him with a lamp and runs out just as Riley and friends cut the power and then work their way up to the dorm room. They capture Spike but, while they consider whether to take Willow or not, Spike breaks free. Buffy arrives and fights Riley and his friends while Spike manages to escape through a window. Unable to make out the identity of their attacker, Riley orders them to retreat. Professor Walsh is not happy with what happened or with Riley's report on the event. It is revealed that Spike cannot harm a human without feeling pain in his head thanks to an implant they placed there. Riley catches up with Buffy and they talk. Buffy tells him he's a little peculiar, a term used by Riley before he realized he liked Buffy, and he responds that he can \\"live with that\\". Production details The vast set for the Initiative, revealed for the first time in this episode, was filmed at a Skunk Works facility, in a location where stealth aircraft have previously been manufactured. When describing the set, writer Doug Petrie said he was told by Whedon to \\"go big. Use your imagination. Do it, go there. This is a big budget movie.\\" In the commentary for this episode, Douglas Petrie reveals that after Spike attacks Willow in her dorm room and the scene immediately cuts to commercial after a fleeting glimpse of the corridor outside with people who fail to hear Willow's screams, he wanted viewers to believe that Willow had actually been killed. Actress Mercedes McNab says the hair-pulling, shin-kicking fight with Xander was \\"actually one of my favorite on-screen fights.\\" When asked if she had a stunt double, she responded \\"No, it was all me\\", but \\"we wore knee pads and shin guards... which was kind of ridiculous seeing it was just such a cheesy fight.\\" Cultural references * Both Spike and Riley saying that they \\"Had to see about a girl\\" may be a reference to the final line of Good Will Hunting. * When Xander sees Harmony burning Spike's belongings, one of the items is a Sex Pistols CD. * Buffy, holding a flare gun, imitates the \\"Dodge this\\" scene from The Matrix, which was released earlier that year. * While Buffy & Riley are talking in the park, she says, \\"Who died and made you John Wayne?\\" * While getting ready to go on patrol with Giles, Xander says, \\"I put the semper in semper fi.\\" Semper fi is the motto of the U.S. Marine Corps Continuity *While captive, Spike asks a fellow prisoner who their captors are, specifically asking if \\"the government\\" or \\"the Nazis\\" are involved. It is later revealed in \\"Why We Fight\\" that during World War II Spike was captured by Nazis who intended to make an army of vampire slaves to win the war.

The name means 'buffalo lizard', in a combination of Blackfeet Indian eini and Latinized Ancient Greek sauros; the specific name (procurvicornis) means 'with a forward-curving horn' in Latin. History of discovery =The Landslide Butte expeditions= Einiosaurus is an exclusively Montanan dinosaur, and all of its known remains are currently held at the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman, Montana. At least fifteen individuals of varying ages are represented by three adult skulls and hundreds of other bones from two low-diversity, monospecific (one species) bonebeds, which were discovered by Jack Horner in 1985 and excavated from 1985 to 1989 by Museum of the Rockies field crews. Jack Horner Horner had not been searching for horned dinosaurs. In the spring of 1985 he had been informed by landowner Jim Peebles that he would no longer be allowed access to the Willow Creek \\"Egg Mountain\\" site where during six years a nesting colony of Maiasaura had been excavated. This forced Horner to find an alternative site because supplies had already been bought for a new summer season and fourteen volunteers and students expected to be employed by him. He investigated two sites, Devil's Pocket and Red Rocks, that however proved to contain too few fossils. For some years, since 1982, Horner had requested from the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council access to the Landslide Butte site. The field notes of Charles Whitney Gilmore from the 1920s indicated that dinosaur eggs could be found there. The council had consistently turned down his requests because they feared widespread disturbance of the reservation. However, one of its members, Marvin Weatherwax, had earlier in 1985 observed that an excavation by Horner of a mosasaurid in the Four Horns Lake had caused only limited damage to the landscape. In early July, the council granted Horner access to the entire reservation. Early in August, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered the Dino Ridge Quarry, containing extensive ceratopid remains, on the land of farmer Ricky Reagan. Continual rainfall hampered operations that year. On 20 June 1986, a crew of sixteen returned to reopen the quarry. A large and dense concentration of bones, a bonebed, was excavated, with up to forty bones per square metre being present. This was interpreted as representing an entire herd that had perished. In late August 1986, Horner and preparator Carrie Ancell on the land of Gloria Sundquist discovered a second horned dinosaur site, at one mile distance from the first, called the Canyon Bone Bed, in which two relatively complete skulls were dug up. The skulls had to be removed from a rather steep cliff and weighed about half a tonne when plastered. They were airlifted by a Bell UH-1 Iroquois of the United States Army National Guard into trucks to be transported. The aberrant build of these skulls first suggested to Horner that they might represent an unknown taxon. Unexpectedly benefiting from a grant of $204,000 by the MacArthur Fellows Program, Horner was able to reopen the two bonebed quarries in 1987. That year almost all fossils were removed that could be accessed without using mechanised earth- moving equipment. Also, an additional horned dinosaur skull was excavated from a somewhat younger layer. In 1988, more ceratopid material was found in a more southern site, the Blacktail Creek North. In the second week of June 1989, student Scott Donald Sampson in the context of his doctoral research with a small crew reopened the Canyon Bone Bed, while Patrick Leiggi that summer with a limited number of workers restarted excavating the Dino Ridge Quarry. The same year, Horner himself found more horned dinosaur fossils at the Blacktail Creek North. In 1990, the expeditions were ended because the reservation allowed access to commercial fossil hunters who quickly strip-mined sites with bulldozers, through a lack of proper documentation greatly diminishing the scientific value of the discoveries. =Identification problems= At the time of the expeditions, it was assumed that all horned dinosaur fossils found in the reservation belonged to a single species, especially as they came from a limited geological time period, its duration estimated at about half a million years. In the 1920s, George Freyer Sternberg had already found ceratopid bones there, that were named as a second species of Styracosaurus: Styracosaurus ovatus. The material had been rather limited and the validity of this species had been doubted, some considering it a nomen dubium.Dodson, P.; Forster, C.A.; Sampson, S.D., 2004, \\"Ceratopsidae\\", in: Weishampel, D.B.; Dodson, P.; Osm√≥lska, H., The Dinosauria, Second Edition, Berkeley: University of California Press, pp. 494‚Äì513 The abundant new remains seemed to prove that the species was real, also because it clearly differed from the type species of Styracosaurus, Styracosaurus albertensis. The comprehensive taphonomic study by Raymond Robert Rogers from 1990 however, did not commit itself fully to this identification, merely mentioning a Styracosaurus sp. Rogers had joined the expedition in 1987. This reflected the fact that the expedition members had started to take the possibility into account that the species was completely new to science, informally referring to it as \\"Styracosaurus makeli\\" in honour of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident in June 1987. In 1990, this name, as an invalid nomen nudum because it lacked a description, appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas. Postorbital bones Horner was an expert on the Hadrosauridae, several sites of which had also been discovered in Landslide Butte, including the juveniles and eggs that were the focus of his research. He had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, to resolve the Styracosaurus question, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis. Horner had gradually changed his mind on the subject. While still thinking that a single population of horned dinosaurs had been present, he began to see it as a chronospecies, an evolutionary series of taxa. In 1992, he described them in an article as three \\"transitional taxa\\" that had spanned the gap between the older Styracosaurus and the later Pachyrhinosaurus. He deliberately declined to name these three taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \\"Transitional Taxon A\\", mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \\"Taxon B\\" ‚Äì the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \\"Taxon C\\", represented by skull MOR 485 found in 1987 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek North. =Sampson names Einiosaurus= In 1994, Sampson, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, named Horner's \\"Taxon B\\" as a new genus and species, Einiosaurus procurvicornis. Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, making the name valid, it did not yet identify by inventory number a holotype, a name-bearing specimen. The same abstract named Type C as Achelousaurus horneri.Sampson, S. D. 1994. \\"Two new horned dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation, Montana, USA\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 14(3, supplement): 44A In 1995, Sampson published a larger article, indicating the holotype. The generic name Einiosaurus is derived from the Blackfeet eini, \\"American bison\\", and Latinised Greek saurus, \\"lizard\\". The name was chosen to honour the Blackfeet tribe but also to reflect the fact that ceratopids were, in Sampson's words, \\"the buffalo of the Cretaceous\\", living in herds and having a complex life. According to Sampson, the name should be pronounced as \\"eye-knee-o-saurus\\". The specific name is derived from Latin procurvus, \\"bent forwards\\", and cornu, \\"horn\\", referring to the forwards curving nasal horn. The holotype, MOR 456-8-9-6-1, was found in a layer of the Two Medicine Formation dating from the late Campanian. It consists of a partial skull, including the nasal horn, the supraorbital area and part of the parietal bone of the skull frill. The skull represents an adult individual. Sampson referred many other specimens to the species. He indicated that additional fossil material from the Canyon Bone Bed had been subsumed under the inventory number MOR 456. This included two further adult skulls and single cranial and postcranial bones from individuals of varying age classes. Furthermore, the fossils from the Dino Ridge Quarry were referred. They had been catalogued within number MOR 373. They consisted of about two hundred non-articulated bones, again from animals of different ages. In 2010, Paul renamed E. procurvicornis into Centrosaurus procurvicornis, but this has found no acceptance, subsequent research invariably referring to the taxon as Einiosaurus. Description =Size and distinguishing traits= Size comparison with human Einiosaurus was a herbivorous dinosaur. It is generally as large as Achelousaurus, though far less robust. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul estimated the body length of Einiosaurus at , its weight at .Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 262 Both taxa fall within the typical size range of the Centrosaurinae. Restoration In 1995, Sampson indicated several distinguishing traits. The nasal horn has a base that is long from front to rear, is transversely flattened, and is strongly curved forwards in some adult specimens. The supraorbital \\"brow\\" horns as far as they are present are low and rounded with a convex surface on the inner side. The parietal parts of the rear edge of the skull frill together bear a single pair of large curved spikes sticking out to behind. Einiosaurus differs from all other known Centrosaurinae by a longer-based and more procurved nasal horn and by a supraorbital horn that is longer-based and more rounded in side view. It differs from Achelousaurus in particular in having large parietal spikes that are not directed sideways to some extent. As a centrosaurine, Einiosaurus walked on all fours, had a large head with a beak, a moderately large skull frill, a short powerful neck, heavily muscled forelimbs, a high torso, powerful hindlimbs and a relatively short tail. =Skeleton= In 1995, Sampson only described the skull, not the postcrania, the parts behind the skull. This was motivated by the fact that in centrosaurines the postcranial skeleton is \\"conservative\\", i.e. differs only slightly among species. Sampson could not find traits in which Einiosaurus differed from a generalised centrosaurine. Nasal bones of younger individuals in the top row and older individuals in the bottom row The holotype skull is the largest known and has a total length of . The snout is relatively narrow and pointed. The top of the snout is formed by the paired nasal bones. Their top surfaces together bear the core of the nasal horn. In 1995, apart from the skulls eight nasal horns from both bonebeds were referred to Einiosaurus. Two of these were from subadults. These show how the horn developed during the growth of the animal. The initially separated core halves fused from the tip downwards and joined into a single structure on the midline. In the subadult stage, the core still showed a suture, however. The subadult cores were transversely flattened and relatively small, not higher than . Six cores were of adults. They showed two distinctive types. Two cores were small and erect, i.e. vertically directed. The four others were large and procurved, strongly curving to the front. The adult horns resembled the subadult ones in being transversely compressed and having a long base from front to rear. To behind they nearly reached the frontal bones. Sampson compared the nasal horn of Einiosaurus with the horns of two related species, Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus. From large bonebeds, numerous nasal horns of Centrosaurus are known, presenting a considerable range of morphologies. Despite all this variation, Einiosaurus horns can be clearly distinguished from them. They are more laterally compressed, unlike the more oval cross-section of Centrosaurus horns. The adult horns are also much more procurved than any nasal horn found in Centrosaurus beds. Styracosaurus horncores are much longer than those of Einiosaurus, up to half a metre in length, and erect or slightly recurved to the rear. Apart from a horn on the snout, centrosaurines also had horns above the eye sockets, supraorbital horncores. These cores were formed by a fusion of the postorbital bone with the much smaller palpebral bone in front of it. Nine subadult or adult \\"brow horns\\" were found. They all shared the same build in being low, long and rounded. This differs from the usual pointed horns with an oval base seen in typical centrosaurines. It is also unlike the supraorbital bosses seen in Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. Nevertheless, some Einiosaurus horns seemed to approach bosses. Three older individuals featured a total of five instances in which the horn as such was replaced by a low rounded mass, sometimes with a large pit in the usual location of the horn point. The large holotype has a rounded mass above the left eye socket but a pit, eighty-five millimetres long and sixty-four millimetres wide, on the right side. According to Sampson, this reflects a general trend with centrosaurines to re-absorb the brow horns in later life. All known specimens of Styracosaurus e.g. have a pitted region instead of true horns. The Einiosaurus holotype additionally has a rough bone mass at the rear postorbital region on the left side. In all centrosaurines, the frontal bones re folded in such a way that a \\"double\\" roof is formed with a \\"supracranial cavity\\" in between. A fontanelle pierces the upper layer. In Einiosaurus, this cavity runs sideways, continuing to below into the brow horn. With Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus these passages are more narrow and do not reach the horns but Pachyrhinosaurus shows a comparable extension. Sampson in 1995 also expounded his general views on such skull roofs, which are not easy to interpret due to fusion. According to him, the frontal bones always extended to the parietals, so that the paired postorbitals never contacted. The parietal bone made only a small contribution to the fontanelle. The floor of the cavity is, at the frontal-parietal suture, pierced by a large foramen into the braincase, the function of this \\"pineal opening\\" being unknown. Its snout is narrow and very pointed. It is typically portrayed with a low, strongly forward and downward curving nasal horn that resembles a bottle opener, though this may only occur in some adults. The supraorbital (over-the-eye) horns are low, short and triangular in top view if present at all, as opposed to the chasmosaurines, such as Triceratops, which have prominent supraorbital horns. A pair of large spikes, the third epiparietals, projects backwards from the relatively small frill. Smaller osteoderms adorn the frill edge. The first epiparietals are largely absent. Classification The placement of Einiosaurus within Centrosaurinae is problematic due to the transitional nature of several of its skull characters, and its closest relatives are either Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus or Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. The latter hypothesis is supported by Horner and colleagues, where Einiosaurus is the earliest of an evolutionary series in which the nasal horns gradually change to rough bosses, as in Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus which are the second and third in this series. The frills also grow in complexity. Regardless of which hypothesis is correct, Einiosaurus appears to occupy an intermediate position with respect to the evolution of the centrosaurines. Parietal frill bones including holotype (A) The cladogram presented below follows a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba et al. (2017): Paleobiology Low-diversity and single-species bonebeds are thought to represent herds that may have died in catastrophic events, such as during a drought or flood. This is evidence that Einiosaurus, as well as other centrosaurine ceratopsians such as Pachyrhinosaurus and Centrosaurus, were herding animals similar in behavior to modern-day bison or wildebeest. In contrast, ceratopsine ceratopsids, such as Triceratops and Torosaurus, are typically found singly, implying that they may have been somewhat solitary in life, though fossilized footprints may provide evidence to the contrary. In 2010, a study by Julie Reizner of the individuals excavated at the Dino Ridge site concluded that Einiosaurus grew quickly until its third to fifth year of life after which growth slowed, probably at the onset of sexual maturity.Reizner, J., 2010, An ontogenetic series and population histology of the ceratopsid dinosaur Einiosaurus procurvicornis. Montana State University master's thesis, pp 97 Like all ceratopsids, Einiosaurus had a complex dental battery capable of processing even the toughest plants. Einiosaurus lived in an inland habitat.

In 1964‚Äì65 Maldon won the League Cup and the following season they were Premier Division champions. The club then moved up to the Eastern Counties League. They finished in the bottom half of the Eastern Counties League every season until leaving to join the Essex Senior League in 1972. The club won the Essex Senior League in the 1984‚Äì85 on goal difference. In 1996 they rejoined the Eastern Counties League, becoming members of Division One. In the 1997‚Äì98 season the club were runners-up and were promoted to the Premier Division. Maldon reached the semi-finals of the FA Vase in 2002‚Äì03, losing 3‚Äì0 on aggregate to AFC Sudbury, with the home leg attracting a record Wallace Binder Ground crowd of 1,163. The 2003‚Äì04 season saw the club finish as runners-up in the Premier Division, earning promotion to the Eastern Division of the Southern League. A third-place finish the following season led to them qualifying for the promotion play-offs; after beating Barking & East Ham United 3‚Äì2 on penalties in the semi-finals, they defeated Uxbridge in the final by the same scoreline and were promoted to the Premier Division of the Isthmian League. However, the club's first season in the division saw them finish in the bottom three, resulting in relegation to Division One North.

The MAP can be used to obtain a point estimate of an unobserved quantity on the basis of empirical data. It is closely related to the method of maximum likelihood (ML) estimation, but employs an augmented optimization objective which incorporates a prior distribution (that quantifies the additional information available through prior knowledge of a related event) over the quantity one wants to estimate. MAP estimation can therefore be seen as a regularization of maximum likelihood estimation. Description Assume that we want to estimate an unobserved population parameter \\\\theta on the basis of observations x. Let f be the sampling distribution of x, so that f(x\\\\mid\\\\theta) is the probability of x when the underlying population parameter is \\\\theta. Then the function: :\\\\theta \\\\mapsto f(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\\\\\! is known as the likelihood function and the estimate: :\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\mathrm{MLE}}(x) = \\\\underset{\\\\theta}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}} \\\\ f(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\\\\\! is the maximum likelihood estimate of \\\\theta. Now assume that a prior distribution g over \\\\theta exists. This allows us to treat \\\\theta as a random variable as in Bayesian statistics. We can calculate the posterior distribution of \\\\theta using Bayes' theorem: :\\\\theta \\\\mapsto f(\\\\theta \\\\mid x) = \\\\frac{f(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\, g(\\\\theta)}{\\\\displaystyle\\\\int_{\\\\Theta} f(x \\\\mid \\\\vartheta) \\\\, g(\\\\vartheta) \\\\, d\\\\vartheta} \\\\\\\\! where g is density function of \\\\theta, \\\\Theta is the domain of g. The method of maximum a posteriori estimation then estimates \\\\theta as the mode of the posterior distribution of this random variable: :\\\\hat{\\\\theta}_{\\\\mathrm{MAP}}(x) = \\\\underset{\\\\theta}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}} \\\\ f(\\\\theta \\\\mid x) = \\\\underset{\\\\theta}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}} \\\\ \\\\frac{f(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\, g(\\\\theta)} {\\\\displaystyle\\\\int_{\\\\Theta} f(x \\\\mid \\\\vartheta) \\\\, g(\\\\vartheta) \\\\, d\\\\vartheta} = \\\\underset{\\\\theta}{\\\\operatorname{arg\\\\,max}} \\\\ f(x \\\\mid \\\\theta) \\\\, g(\\\\theta). \\\\\\\\! The denominator of the posterior distribution (so-called marginal likelihood) is always positive and does not depend on \\\\theta and therefore plays no role in the optimization. Observe that the MAP estimate of \\\\theta coincides with the ML estimate when the prior g is uniform (that is, a constant function). When the loss function is of the form : L(\\\\theta, a) = \\\\begin{cases} 0, & \\\\text{if } a-\\\\theta as c goes to 0, the Bayes estimator approaches the MAP estimator, provided that the distribution of \\\\theta is quasi-concave. But generally a MAP estimator is not a Bayes estimator unless \\\\theta is discrete.  Computation  MAP estimates can be computed in several ways: # Analytically, when the mode(s) of the posterior distribution can be given in closed form. This is the case when conjugate priors are used. # Via numerical optimization such as the conjugate gradient method or Newton's method. This usually requires first or second derivatives, which have to be evaluated analytically or numerically. # Via a modification of an expectation- maximization algorithm. This does not require derivatives of the posterior density. # Via a Monte Carlo method using simulated annealing Limitations While only mild conditions are required for MAP estimation to be a limiting case of Bayes estimation (under the 0‚Äì1 loss function), it is not very representative of Bayesian methods in general. This is because MAP estimates are point estimates, whereas Bayesian methods are characterized by the use of distributions to summarize data and draw inferences: thus, Bayesian methods tend to report the posterior mean or median instead, together with credible intervals. This is both because these estimators are optimal under squared- error and linear-error loss respectively‚Äîwhich are more representative of typical loss functions‚Äîand for a continuous posterior distribution there is no loss function which suggests the MAP is the optimal point estimator. In addition, the posterior distribution may often not have a simple analytic form: in this case, the distribution can be simulated using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques, while optimization to find its mode(s) may be difficult or impossible. An example of a density of a bimodal distribution in which the highest mode is uncharacteristic of the majority of the distribution In many types of models, such as mixture models, the posterior may be multi-modal. In such a case, the usual recommendation is that one should choose the highest mode: this is not always feasible (global optimization is a difficult problem), nor in some cases even possible (such as when identifiability issues arise). Furthermore, the highest mode may be uncharacteristic of the majority of the posterior. Finally, unlike ML estimators, the MAP estimate is not invariant under reparameterization. Switching from one parameterization to another involves introducing a Jacobian that impacts on the location of the maximum. As an example of the difference between Bayes estimators mentioned above (mean and median estimators) and using a MAP estimate, consider the case where there is a need to classify inputs x as either positive or negative (for example, loans as risky or safe). Suppose there are just three possible hypotheses about the correct method of classification h_1, h_2 and h_3 with posteriors 0.4, 0.3 and 0.3 respectively. Suppose given a new instance, x, h_1 classifies it as positive, whereas the other two classify it as negative. Using the MAP estimate for the correct classifier h_1, x is classified as positive, whereas the Bayes estimators would average over all hypotheses and classify x as negative. Example Suppose that we are given a sequence (x_1, \\\\dots, x_n) of IID N(\\\\mu,\\\\sigma_v^2 ) random variables and a priori distribution of \\\\mu is given by N(\\\\mu_0,\\\\sigma_m^2 ). We wish to find the MAP estimate of \\\\mu. Note that the normal distribution is its own conjugate prior, so we will be able to find a closed-form solution analytically. The function to be maximized is then given by :f(\\\\mu) f(x \\\\mid \\\\mu)=\\\\pi(\\\\mu) L(\\\\mu) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\sigma_m} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu-\\\\mu_0}{\\\\sigma_m}\\\\right)^2\\\\right) \\\\prod_{j=1}^n \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2 \\\\pi} \\\\sigma_v} \\\\exp\\\\left(-\\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_j - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma_v}\\\\right)^2\\\\right), which is equivalent to minimizing the following function of \\\\mu: : \\\\sum_{j=1}^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{x_j - \\\\mu}{\\\\sigma_v}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\mu-\\\\mu_0}{\\\\sigma_m}\\\\right)^2. Thus, we see that the MAP estimator for Œº is given by :\\\\hat{\\\\mu}_\\\\mathrm{MAP} = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_m^2\\\\,n}{\\\\sigma_m^2 \\\\,n+ \\\\sigma_v^2 } \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{n} \\\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j \\\\right) + \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_v^2}{\\\\sigma_m^2 \\\\,n+ \\\\sigma_v^2 } \\\\,\\\\mu_0 =\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_m^2\\\\left(\\\\sum_{j=1}^n x_j\\\\right) + \\\\sigma_v^2 \\\\,\\\\mu_0}{\\\\sigma_m^2\\\\,n + \\\\sigma_v^2 }. which turns out to be a linear interpolation between the prior mean and the sample mean weighted by their respective covariances. The case of \\\\sigma_m \\\\to \\\\infty is called a non- informative prior and leads to an ill-defined a priori probability distribution; in this case \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_\\\\mathrm{MAP} \\\\to \\\\hat{\\\\mu}_\\\\mathrm{ML}.

It states that auction houses have an incentive to pre-commit to revealing all available information about each lot, positive or negative. The linkage principle is seen in the art market with the age-old tradition of auctioneers hiring art experts to examine each lot and pre-commit to provide a truthful estimate of its value. The discovery of the linkage principle was most useful in determining optimal strategy for countries in the process of auctioning off drilling rights (as well as other natural resources, such as logging rights in Canada). An independent assessment of the land in question is now a standard feature of most auctions, even if the seller country may believe that the assessment is likely to lower the value of the land rather than confirm or raise a pre- existing valuation. Failure to reveal information leads to the winning bidder incurring the discovery costs himself and lowering his maximum bid due to the expenses incurred in acquiring information. If he is not able to get an independent assessment, then his bids will take into account the possibility of downside risk. Both scenarios can be shown to lower the expected revenue of the seller. The expected sale price is raised by lowering these discovery costs of the winning bidder, and instead providing information to all bidders for free. Use in FCC auction In the words of Evan Kwerel, \\"In the end, the FCC chose an ascending bid mechanism, largely because we believed that providing bidders with more information would likely increase efficiency and, as shown by Paul Milgrom and Robert J.

It provided a theoretical foundation for the intuition driving the major design choice by the FCC between an ascending bid and sealed bid auction.

Reny (1999), On the Failure of the Linkage Principle in Multi-Unit Auctions, Econometrica 67(4), 895-900. > The linkage principle has come to be considered one of the fundamental > lessons provided by auction theory.

As stated by Milgrom and Weber (1982, p.1095), \\"One explanation of this inequality is that when bidders are uncertain about their valuations, they can acquire useful information by scrutinizing the bidding behavior of their competitors during the course of an [ascending-bid] auction. That extra information weakens the winner's curse and leads to more aggressive bidding in the [ascending-bid] auction, which accounts for the higher expected price.\\" The linkage principle also implies that the auctioneer maximizes the expected price by always fully revealing all information it has regarding the object being sold completely. In the words of Milgrom and Weber (1982,p. 1096), \\"Honesty is the best policy.\\" In order to provide a statement of the linkage principle, we follow the presentation of Krishna, Krishna, Vijay (2002), Auction Theory, New York: Academic Press. which notes that the linkage principle \\"was first set forth and used by Milgrom and Weber (1982).\\" (Krishna, 2002, p. 11) We begin by defining the necessary concepts and notation required to state the linkage principle. Define a standard auction format to be one in which the high bidder wins. Suppose that each bidder, receives a signal regarding the value of the object. We assume the valuation to each bidder depends on its own observed signal and symmetrically upon the unobserved signals of the other bidders (so that the signals of the other bidders can be interchanged without affecting a given bidder's value). More specifically, assume all signals are drawn from the interval and that for all we can write the value of bidder as v_{i}(\\\\mathbf{X})=u(X_{i},\\\\mathbf{X}_{-i}), where the function is symmetric in the last components. We now define other random variables and mappings with respect to bidder 1, but because of the assumed symmetry, they are the same for all bidders. Define random variables Y_1, \\\\cdots, Y_{N-1} to be the largest, second largest, etc., from among X_2, \\\\cdots, X_{N}. Let G(\\\\cdot \\\\mid x) denote the distribution of Y_{1} conditional on X_{1}=x, i.e., G(z\\\\mid x)\\\\equiv \\\\Pr \\\\left( Y_{1}, and let g(\\\\cdot \\\\mid x) be the associated density. We let :v(x,y)=E \\\\left [ V_1 \\\\mid X_1 =x, Y_1 =y\\\\right ] be the expectation of the value to a bidder when the signal he receives is and the highest signal among the other bidders, is . We assume that is nondecreasing in and strictly increasing in and that . For each standard auction format , suppose that the auction has a symmetric and increasing equilibrium , which is a mapping from a bidder's observed signal to its bid. Let W^{A}(z,x) denote the expected payment by a bidder if he is the winning bidder when he receives a signal but bids as if their signal were , i.e., he bids . Let W_{1}^{A}(x,z) denote the derivative of with respect to its first argument and W_{2}^{A}(x,z) the derivative with respect to its second argument, evaluated at . For specific examples, in a first-price sealed-bid auction, labeled , where the high bidder wins and pays the amount of their bid, we have W^{I}(z,x)=\\\\beta^{I}(z), and in a second-price auction, labeled , where the high bidder wins and pays the amount of the second-highest bid, we have :W^{II}(z,x)=E\\\\left[ \\\\beta^{II}(Y_{1})\\\\mid X_{1}=x,Y_{1} Now we may state: :Linkage Principle. (Krishna, 2002, Proposition 7.1) Let and be two standard auctions, each having a symmetric and increasing equilibrium such that ::(i) for all , W_{2}^{A}(x,x)\\\\geq W_{2}^{B}(x,x); ::(ii) :Then the expected revenue in is at least as large as the expected revenue in . Proof: The expected payoff of a bidder with signal who bids is :\\\\int_{-\\\\infty }^{z}v(x,y)g(y\\\\mid x)dy-G(z\\\\mid x)W^{A}(z,x). In equilibrium, it is optimal to choose and the resulting first- order conditions imply that :v(x,x)g(x\\\\mid x)-g(x\\\\mid x)W^{A}(x,x)+G(x\\\\mid x)W_{1}^{A}(x,x)=0, which we can rewrite as :W_{1}^{A}(x,x)=\\\\frac{g(x\\\\mid x)}{G(x\\\\mid x)}v(x,x)-\\\\frac{g(x\\\\mid x)}{G(x\\\\mid x)}W^{A}(x,x). Letting :\\\\Delta (x)=W^{A}(x,x)-W^{B}(x,x), we conclude that :\\\\Delta ^{\\\\prime }(x)=-\\\\frac{g(x\\\\mid x)}{G(x\\\\mid x)}\\\\Delta (x)+\\\\left(W_{2}^{A}(x,x)-W_{2}^{B}(x,x)\\\\right). By hypothesis (i), the second term is positive, and by hypothesis (ii), which implies , it follows that and cannot be of different signs, implying that for all , . Q.E.D. To use this proposition to rank, for example, the second-price and first-price auctions, we need to assume that the bidders signals are affiliated (see Milgrom and Weber, 1982, Appendix on Affiliation, pp. 1118‚Äì1121), which implies that G(z\\\\mid \\\\cdot ) is decreasing and that W_{2}^{II}(x,x)\\\\geq 0. Note that W_{2}^{I}(x,x)=0. Thus, under the assumption of affiliation, W_{2}^{II}(x,x)\\\\geq W_{2}^{I}(x,x). In addition, so the Linkage Principle implies that expected revenue from a second-price auction is at least as great as that from a first-price auction. To use this proposition to show that expected revenue is greater when public information is made available, consider the first-price auction. Let be a random variable denoting the information available to the seller and suppose a symmetric equilibrium strategy \\\\widehat{\\\\beta}(S,X_{1}) that is increasing in both variables. Then let :\\\\widehat{W}^{I}(z,x)=E\\\\left[ \\\\widehat{\\\\beta} (S,z)\\\\big X_{1}=x\\\\right] be the expected payment of a winning bidder when he receives signal but bids as if it were z. Assuming and are affiliated, so that :\\\\widehat{W}_{2}^{I}(z,x)\\\\geq 0, then :\\\\widehat{W}_{2}^{I}(x,x)\\\\geq W_{2}^{I}(x,x) and the linkage principle implies that expected revenue is at least as great when information is revealed as when it is not. To see that an ascending-bid auction has greater expected revenue than a second-price auction, note that in an ascending-bid auction, the observed points at which other bidders cease to be active provide additional signals that are also affiliated with and so the logic for information revelation increases expected revenue applies. Although it has been shown that the linkage principle need not hold in more complex auction environments (see Perry and Reny (1999) on the failure of the linkage principle in multi-unit auctions), as argued by Loertscher, Marx, and Wilkening (2013),Loertscher, Simon, Leslie M. Marx, and Tom Wilkening (2013), A Long Way Coming: Designing Centralized Markets with Privately Informed Buyers and Sellers, Working Paper, University of Melbourne. the intuition provided by the linkage principle for the potential benefits of open over closed auction formats, and the benefits of information revelation generally, will likely continue to influence practical auction design far into the future.

Details of Kubuna It consists of the provinces of Tailevu, Naitasiri, Lomaiviti, and parts of the western provinces of Ba and Ra. Most of Kubuna is located in the northern part of Fiji's Central Division. The capital of this confederacy is Bau Island in Tailevu Province. Paramount Titles of Kubuna The Paramount Chief of Kubuna, who is generally considered to be the highest-ranked chief in Fiji, is the Vunivalu of Bau. This position has been vacant since the death of Ratu Sir George Cakobau, a former Governor General, in 1989. Succession is not necessarily from father to son, although there is a hereditary element. Currently, there are three eligible contenders, namely Ratu George Cakobau, Jr., his brother Ratu Epenisa Cakobau and their cousin Ratu George Kadavulevu Naulivou. It is thought that clan politics is part of the reason why none of these candidates has, of yet, been installed. It is said that the nomination of Ratu George Kadavulevu Naulivou has been disqualified based on the basis that his father was born out of wedlock. Also listed as a possible candidate is Fiji's former President, Ratu Epeli Nailatikau; however he too is considered by some to be disqualified as he is only connected through maternal links being a descendant of Ratu Edward Tuivanuavou Tugi Cakobau, a product of an extra-marital liaison by Cakobau's granddaughter Adi Litia Cakobau with (the then married) King George Tupou II of Tonga. Another high chief from Kubuna is the Roko Tui Bau, most recently Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi, the former Vice-President of Fiji who died in 2016. According to sources within the Great Council of Chiefs (a traditional body which, among other things, used to function as an electoral college to choose the President and Vice-President), he was chosen for the Vice- Presidency because it was thought that as President Ratu Josefa Iloilo was from the Burebasaga and his predecessor, Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara from Tovata, the new Vice-President should be from Kubuna. On 6 December 2006 he was ousted from office by coup leader Voreqe Bainimarama and the office of Vice-President has been suspended ever since.

H. The Chemistry of Oxazoles. Chem. Rev. 1945, 37, 401. () This method was discovered by Emil Fischer in 1896.Fischer, E. Ber. 1896, 29, 205. The cyanohydrin itself is derived from a separate aldehyde. The reactants of the oxazole synthesis itself, the cyanohydrin of an aldehyde and the other aldehyde itself, are usually present in equimolar amounts.Li, J. J. Fischer Oxazole Synthesis. In Name Reactions: A Collection of Detailed Mechanisms and Synthetic Applications, 4th ed.; Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg: New York, 2003, 229-230. (Review). () Both reactants usually have an aromatic group, which appear at specific positions on the resulting heterocycle. Fischer Oxazole Synthesis A more specific example of Fischer oxazole synthesis involves reacting mandelic acid nitrile with benzaldehyde to give 2,5-diphenyl-oxazole.Maklad, N. Name Reactions in Heterocyclic Chemistry II; Li, J.J.; Wiley & Sons; Hoboken, NJ, 2011, 225-232. () Overall Fischer Oxazole Synthesis History Fischer developed the Fischer oxazole synthesis during his time at Berlin University. The Fischer oxazole synthesis was one of the first syntheses developed to produce 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles. Mechanism The Fischer oxazole synthesis is a type of dehydration reaction which can occur under mild conditions in a rearrangement of the groups that would not seem possible. The reaction occurs by dissolving the reactants in dry ether and passing through the solution dry, gaseous hydrogen chloride. The product, which is the 2,5-disubstituted oxazole, precipitates as the hydrochloride and can be converted to the free base by the addition of water or by boiling with alcohol. The cyanohydrins and aldehydes used for the synthesis are usually aromatic, however there have been instances where aliphatic compounds have been used. The first step of the mechanism is the addition of gaseous HCl to the cyanohydrin 1. The cyanohydrin abstracts the hydrogen from HCl while the chloride ion attacks the carbon in the cyano group. This first step results in the formation of an iminochloride intermediate 2, probably as the hydrochloride salt. This intermediate then reacts with the aldehyde; the hydroxyl group of 2 abstracts a hydrogen from the nitrogen, while the lone pair of the nitrogen attacks the electrophilic carbonyl carbon on the aldehyde. The following step results in an SN2 attack followed by the loss water to give a chloro-oxazoline intermediate 4. Next is the tautomerization of the a ring proton. The last step involves an elimination and the loss of an HCl molecule to form the product 6, which is the 2,5-diaryloxazole. Electron Flow Mechanism Applications Diarylazoles are common structural motifs in both natural products and drug candidates, however they are difficult to synthesize. Diaryloxazoles are generally prepared through the Fischer oxazole synthesis or Robinson-Gabriel synthesis, where the oxazole ring is constructed via either synthesis.Strotman, N. A.; Chobanian, H. R.; He, J.; Guo, Y.; Dormer, P. G.; Jones, C. M.; Steves, J. E. Catalyst-Controlled Regioselective Suzuki Couplings at Both Positions of Dihaloimadozles, Dihalooxazoles, and Dihalothiazoles. J. Org. Chem. 2010, 75, 1733-1739. () The Fischer oxazole synthesis has also been useful in the synthesis of 2-(4-Bromophenyl)5-phenyloxazole starting with benzaldehyde cyanohydrin and 4-bromobenzaldehyde. However, oxazole ring chlorination occurs to give 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-chlorooxazole 7 along with 2,5-bis(4-bromophenyl)-4-oxazolidinone 8. The latter compound is in general a by-product.Turchi, I. J. Oxazole Chemistry: A Review of Recent Advances. Ind. Eng. Che. Prod. Res. Dev. 1981, 20, 32-76. () (Review). Example of a Fischer Oxazole Synthesis Another useful example is the one pot two-step synthesis of halfordinol, a parent compound for Rutaceae alkaloids. The initial steps follow the Fischer oxazole synthesis, although the acid-catalyzed cyclization occurs in two steps rather than one, which ensures the formation of the di- chloro intermediate, preventing formation of the regioisomer. Harfordinal In recent research, a reconsideration of the Fischer oxazole synthesis has led to the synthesis of 2,5-disubstituted oxazoles from aldehydes and Œ±-hydroxy- amides. However, unlike the Fischer oxazole synthesis, the new method is not limited to diaryloxazoles.Cornforth, J.W.; Cornforth, R. H. 218. Mechanism and Extension of the Fischer Oxazole Synthesis. J. Am.

The first fossils of Achelousaurus were collected in Montana in 1987, by a team led by Jack Horner, with more finds made in 1989. In 1994, Achelousaurus horneri was described and named by Scott D. Sampson; the generic name means \\"Achelous lizard\\", in reference to a Greek mythological figure, and the specific name refers to Horner. The genus is known from a few specimens consisting mainly of skull material from individuals, ranging from juveniles to adults. A large centrosaurine, Achelousaurus was about long, with a weight of about . As a ceratopsian, it walked on all fours, had a short tail and a large head with a hooked beak. It had a bony neck-frill at the rear of the skull, which sported a pair of long spikes, which curved towards the outside. Adult Achelousaurus had rough bosses (roundish protuberances) above the eyes and on the snout where other centrosaurines often had horns in the same positions. These bosses were covered by a thick layer of keratin, but their exact shape in life is uncertain. According to some scientists the bosses were used in fights, with the animals butting each other's heads, and for display. Within the Ceratopsia, Achelousaurus lies within the clade Pachyrostra (or \\"thick-snouts\\"). It has been suggested that it was the direct descendant of the similar genus Einiosaurus (which had spikes but no bosses) and the direct ancestor of Pachyrhinosaurus (which had larger bosses). The first two genera would be transitional forms, evolving through anagenesis from Styracosaurus. There has been debate about this theory, with later discoveries showing that Achelousaurus is closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus in the group Pachyrhinosaurini. Achelousaurus is known from the Two Medicine Formation and lived in the island continent of Laramidia. As a ceratopsian, Achelousaurus would have been a herbivore and it appears to have had a high metabolic rate, though lower than that of modern mammals and birds. History of discovery =Horner's expeditions to Landslide Butte= Jack Horner led the team that discovered Achelousaurus. A. horneri was named after him All known Achelousaurus specimens were recovered from the Two Medicine Formation in Glacier County, Montana during excavations conducted by the Museum of the Rockies, which still houses the specimens. The discoveries came about by an accidental chain of events. In the spring of 1985, paleontologist John \\"Jack\\" R. Horner was informed that he would no longer be allowed to exploit the Willow Creek site, where he had studied the Maiasaura Egg Mountain nesting colony for six years. Having already made extensive arrangements for a new field season, he was suddenly forced to seek an alternative site. Horner had always been intrigued by the field diaries of Charles Whitney Gilmore who had reported the discovery of dinosaur eggs at Landslide Butte in 1928, but never published on them. In this locality, Gilmore had employed George Fryer Sternberg to excavate skeletons of the horned dinosaurs Brachyceratops and Styracosaurus ovatus. That summer, Horner obtained the permission of the Blackfeet Indian Tribal Council to prospect for fossils on Landslide Butte, which is part of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation; it was the first paleontological investigation there since the 1920s. In August 1985, Horner's associate Bob Makela discovered a rich fossil site on the land of the farmer Ricky Reagan, which was called the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and contained fossils of horned dinosaurs. On 20 June 1986, Horner and Makela returned to the Blackfeet Indian Reservation and resumed work on the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry, which proved to contain, apart from eggs, more than a dozen skeletons of a horned dinosaur later named Einiosaurus. In August 1986, at a nearby site ‚Äì the Canyon Bone Bed on the land of Gloria Sundquist, east of the Milk River ‚Äì Horner's team discovered another Einiosaurus bone bed. Part of the discoveries made on this occasion was an additional horned dinosaur skull, specimen MOR 492, that later would be referred to (i.e., formally assigned to) Rubeosaurus, the genus name in 2010 given to Styracosaurus ovatus. During the field season of 1987 (early July), volunteer Sidney M. Hostetter located another horned dinosaur skull near the Canyon Bone Bed, specimen MOR 485. By the end of August, it had been secured and was driven on a grain truck to the Museum of the Rockies in Bozeman. On 23 June 1988, another site was discovered in the vicinity ‚Äì the Blacktail Creek North. In the summer of 1989, graduate student Scott D. Sampson joined the team, wanting to study the function of the frill display structures in horned dinosaurs. At the end of June 1989, Horner, his son Jason and his head preparator Carrie Ancell discovered horned dinosaur specimen MOR 591 near the Blacktail Creek. =Interpretation of the collected fossils= Holotype skull MOR 485 in front view It was initially assumed that all the horned dinosaur material recovered by the expeditions could be assigned to a single \\"styracosaur\\" species distinct from Styracosaurus albertensis, as the fossils represented a limited geological time period, then estimated at about half a million years. Raymond Robert Rogers, who was studying the stratigraphy of the bone beds, referred to it as a Styracosaurus sp. (of undetermined species) in 1989. Styracosaurus ovatus ‚Äì though sometimes considered an invalid nomen dubium ‚Äì had already been found in the area by G. F. Sternberg and was an obvious candidate. But also the possibility was taken into account that the finds were of a species new to science. This species was informally named \\"Styracosaurus makeli\\" in honor of Bob Makela, who had died in a traffic accident just days before the discovery of specimen MOR 485. In 1990, this name, as an invalid nomen nudum, appeared in a photo caption in a book by Stephen Czerkas. Horner, an expert on the Hadrosauridae family, had less affinity for other kinds of dinosaurs. In 1987 and 1989, horned dinosaur specialist Peter Dodson was invited to investigate the new ceratopsian finds. In 1990, the fossil material was seen by Dodson as strengthening the case for the validity of a separate Styracosaurus ovatus, to be distinguished from Styracosaurus albertensis. Meanwhile, Horner had come to a more complex view of the situation. He still thought that the fossil material had been part of a single population but concluded that this had developed over time as a chronospecies evolving into a series of subsequent taxa. In 1992, Horner, David Varricchio and Mark Goodwin published an article in Nature based on the six-year field study of sediments and dinosaurs from Montana. They proposed that the expeditions had uncovered three \\"transitional taxa\\" spanning the gap between the already known Styracosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. For the moment, they declined to name these taxa. The oldest form was indicated as \\"Transitional Taxon A,\\" mainly represented by skull MOR 492. Then came \\"Taxon B\\" ‚Äì the many skeletons of the Dinosaur Ridge Quarry and the Canyon Bone Bed. The youngest was \\"Taxon C,\\" represented by skull MOR 485 and the horned dinosaur fossils of the Blacktail Creek. =Sampson names Achelousaurus= Achelous loses his horn to Hercules on an Attic krater Sampson had continued his studies of the material since 1989. In 1994, in a talk during the annual meeting of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he named \\"Taxon C\\" as a new genus and species, Achelousaurus horneri. Although an abstract was published containing a sufficient description, it did not identify a holotype, a name- bearing specimen.Sampson, S. D. 1994. \\"Two new horned dinosaurs (Ornithischia: Ceratopsidae) from the Upper Cretaceous Two Medicine Formation, Montana, USA\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 14(3, supplement): 44A In 1995, in a subsequent article, Sampson indicated specimen MOR 485 as the holotype specimen of Achelousaurus horneri. The generic name consists of the words Achelous, the name of a Greek mythological figure, and saurus, which is Latinized Greek for lizard. Achelous (·ºàœáŒµŒª·ø∑ŒøœÇ) is a Greek river deity and a shapeshifter who was able to transform himself into anything. During a fight with Hercules, the mythical hero, Achelous took the form of a bull, but lost the battle when one of his horns was removed. This allusion is a reference to the supposedly transitional traits of the dinosaur and the characteristic loss of horns through ontogenetic and phylogenetic development, and thus through individual change and evolution. Dodson, in 1996, praised the generic name for being original and intelligent. The specific name honors Jack Horner, for his research on the dinosaurs of the Two Medicine Formation in Montana. Sampson also named \\"Taxon B\\" as the genus Einiosaurus in the same article wherein Achelousaurus was described. He said paleontologists needed to be cautious when naming new ceratopsian genera because their intraspecific variation (i.e., variation within a species) might be mistaken for interspecific differences (between species). Until 1995, only one new genus of centrosaurine dinosaur had been named since Pachyrhinosaurus in 1950, namely Avaceratops in 1986. Achelousaurus thus holds particular importance for being one of the few ceratopsid genera named in the late twentieth century. The holotype specimen MOR 485 was collected by Hostetter and Ray Rogers from the Landslide Butte Field Area about northwest of Cut Bank. In 1995 Sampson described it as the partial skull of an adult animal including the nasal and supraorbital (region above the eye socket) bosses (roundish protuberances instead of horns), and the parietal bones. Additionally, MOR 485 preserves some bones of the skull rear and sides, which in 2009 were listed by Tracy L. Ford as a right squamosal bone, the left squamosal, both maxillae, both lacrimal bones, both quadrate bones, both palatine bones, the braincase and the basioccipital bone. In 2015, Leonardo Maiorino reported that as part of the same specimen a fragmentary lower jaw has been catalogued as MOR 485-7-12-87-4. A right squamosal bone from another adult individual was recovered from the same Canyon Bone Bed site as MOR 485 (and catalogued under the same number), but only reported in 2010. Two other specimens were collected on the Blacktail Creek, to the south of Cut Bank and referred to Achelousaurus by Sampson in 1995. Specimen MOR 591 is a partial skull and an about 60% complete skeleton of a sub-adult specimen that includes the vertebral column, pelvis, sacrum and a femur. It also includes lower jaws, catalogued as MOR 591-7-15-89-1. Both skull and lower jaws are nearly complete, lacking only the braincase and occipital region. MOR 591 is smaller than the holotype with a skull base length of about . Specimen MOR 571 includes a partial skull and lower jaws with associated ribs and vertebrae of an adult. The skull consists of only the parietals, and the lower jaws are limited to their upper rear bones, the surangulars and articulars. A fifth specimen is MOR 456.1, a subadult. None of the specimens were of an advanced individual age. According to Andrew McDonald and colleagues, the Achelousaurus finds represented single individuals, not bone beds. =Possible Achelousaurus finds= TMP 2002.76.1, which may be a specimen of Achelousaurus, Pachyrhinosaurus, or a new taxon, in the Royal Tyrrell Museum In addition to fossils that have been unequivocally assigned to Achelousaurus, some other material has been found of which the identity is uncertain. A centrosaurine ceratopsid specimen with bosses from the Dinosaur Park Formation (specimen TMP 2002.76.1) found in 1996 was suggested to belong to a new taxon in 2006, but may instead belong to Achelousaurus or Pachyrhinosaurus. Since it is missing the parietal bones, which are used to diagnose centrosaurines, it is not possible to assign it to any genus with confidence. In 2006, it was also proposed that Monoclonius lowei, a dubious species based on a skull (specimen CMN 8790) from the Dinosaur Park Formation, could be a sub-adult specimen of Styracosaurus, Achelousaurus or Einiosaurus, with which it is roughly contemporaneous. In addition, some indeterminate specimens from the Two Medicine Formation ‚Äì such as fragmentary skull MOR 464 or snout MOR 449 ‚Äì may belong to Achelousaurus or the two other roughly contemporary ceratopsids Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus. Description =General build= Size compared to a human Achelousaurus is estimated to have been long with a weight of . The skull of an adult individual (holotype specimen MOR 485) was estimated to have been long. This puts it in the same size-range as other members of the Centrosaurinae subgroup of ceratopsians that lived during the Campanian age. It was about as large as its close relative Einiosaurus, but with a much heavier build. Achelousaurus approached the robustness of one of the largest and most heavily built horned dinosaurs known ‚Äì Triceratops. As a ceratopsid, Achelousaurus would have been a quadrupedal animal with hoofed digits and a shortened, downwards swept tail. Its very large head, which would have rested on a straight neck, had a hooked upper beak, very large nasal openings and long tooth rows developed into dental batteries that contained hundreds of appressed and stacked individual teeth. In the tooth sockets, new teeth grew under the old ones, each position housing a column of teeth posed on top of each other. Achelousaurus had 25 to 28 such tooth positions in each maxilla (upper jaw bone). =Distinguishing traits= Life restoration In 1995, when describing the species, Sampson gave a formal list of four traits that distinguish Achelousaurus from its centrosaurine relatives. Firstly, adult individuals have nasal bones with a boss on top that is relatively small and thin, and heavily covered with pits; secondly, adult individuals do not have true horns above the eye sockets but relatively large bosses with high ridges; thirdly, not yet fully grown individuals, or subadults, have true horncores (the bony part of the horns) above the eye sockets with the inward facing surface being concave; and fourthly, the parietal bones of the neck shield have a single pair of curved spikes sticking out from the rear margin to behind and to the outside. Besides these unique characteristics, Sampson pointed out additional differences with two very closely related forms. The frill spikes of Achelousaurus are more outwards oriented than the spikes of Einiosaurus, which are medially curved; the spikes of Achelousaurus are nevertheless less directed to the outside than the comparable spikes of Pachyrhinosaurus. Achelousaurus also differs from Pachyrhinosaurus in its smaller nasal boss that does not reach the frontal bones at its rear. Apart from the skull, no features of the skeleton are known that distinguish Achelousaurus from other members of the Centrosaurinae. =Skull= Holotype skull in right side view Horned dinosaurs mainly differ from each other in their horns, which are located on the snout and above the eyes, and in the large skull frill, which covers the neck like a shield. Achelousaurus exhibited the build of derived (\\"advanced\\") centrosaurines, which are typified by short brow horns or bosses, combined with elaborate frill spikes. The general frill proportions are typically centrosaurine, with a wide rounded squamosal bone at the side, which expanded towards the rear. It also shares the typical frill curvature with a top surface that is convex from side to side and concave from front to rear. Adult Achelousaurus skulls had a rugose, heavily pitted boss on the snout or nasal region, where many other ceratopsids had a horn. Such a boss is often called \\"pachyostotic\\", i.e. consisting of thickened bone. But describing it as a thick \\"boss\\" can be misleading: in fact it forms a wide depression with a thin bone floor and irregular excavations, though it is less depressed than with Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal boss covered about two-thirds of the top surface of the nasal bones. The boss was similar to that seen in the related genus Pachyrhinosaurus, though narrower, shorter, and less high. It covered 27% of the total skull length, was 30% longer than the nostril-eye socket distance and was about twice as long as the eye socket. Its rear edge did not reach the level of the eye socket. The nasal boss extended forward, where it fused onto the nasal and premaxilla bones (of the upper jaw) at the front of the snout, though the nasal bone itself did not fuse with the premaxilla. The boss of specimen MOR 485 furthermore had an excavation (or cavity) at its front end. The horn core that formed the boss may have developed by either becoming procurved (i.e. bent forward) during growth, like the horn of the related Einiosaurus, until it fused onto the nasal bone; or from a simple, erect horn, which later extended its base forward over the snout region, as in Pachyrhinosaurus. The nasal bone formed the top of a large bony nostril. From the rear edge of that nostril a sharp process stuck out to the front. The snout was ‚Äì compared to that of Einiosaurus ‚Äì relatively wide at the level of the rear nostrils. The lacrimal bone, in front of the eye socket, was thickened, mainly on the inner surface while the outer surface was featureless apart from a crater-like excavation. Diagram of the skull Adult skulls also possess large, rugose, and oval bosses on the supraorbital region above the eyes, instead of the horns of other ceratopsids. The supraorbital bosses extended from the postorbital bone forward to incorporate the triangular palpebral and prefrontal bones, and had high transverse ridges around the middle, which were thick at their base and thin towards their top. The palpebral bones strongly stood out, forming an \\"antorbital buttress\\". The fused prefrontals did not reach the nasal boss, forming a distinctive transverse saddle-shaped groove separating the nasal boss from the supraorbital bosses. This groove extended backwards, separating the supraorbital bosses from each other and forming a T-shape in top view. These bosses were similar to those of Pachyrhinosaurus, but with taller ridges and more pronounced rugosities. The long and low supraorbital horncores of the sub-adult specimen MOR 591 were similar to those of sub-adult Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. They had a concave surface on the inner side as with Pachyrhinosaurus; ridges on the postorbital bones were present that may indicate a beginning transition to bosses. The skull roof of Achelousaurus had a midline cavity, with an opening at the top called the frontal fontanelle, a feature found in all ceratopsids, which have a \\"double\\" skull roof formed by the frontal bones folding towards each other between the brow horn bases. This cavity formed sinuses that extended below the supraorbital bosses, which were therefore relatively thin internally, being thick from the outside to the cavity roof. This cavity appears to have partially closed over as an animal aged, with only the rear part of the fontanelle being open in the adult specimen MOR 485. Parietosquamosal frill bones of three skulls; MOR 485, 571 and 591 Like that of all other ceratopsids, the skull of Achelousaurus had a parietosquamosal frill or \\"neck shield\\", which was formed by the parietal bones at the rear and the squamosal bones at the sides. The parietal is one of the main bones used to distinguish centrosaurine taxa from each other and resolve relationships between them, whereas the squamosal is very similar across taxa. In Achelousaurus, the squamosal bone was much shorter than the parietal. Of its inner margin the rear portion formed a step in relation to the front part, with the suture between the squamosal and the parietal showing a kink to behind at the level of the rear supratemporal fenestra, a typical centrosaurine trait. The squamosal and the jugal bone, by touching each other, excluded the quadratojugal from the edge of the lateral temporal fenestra, i.e. the opening at the rear of the skull side. The frill of Achelousaurus had two conspicuous large spikes that were directed backwards and curved to the sides away from each other. During the 1990s, it was increasingly understood that such spikes on the parietals were not random growths but specific traits that could be used to determine the evolution of horned dinosaurs, if only it could be analyzed how they corresponded among species. Sampson, in the paper describing Achelousaurus in 1995, therefore introduced a generalized numbering system for such parietal processes, counting them from the midline to the side of the frill. This was applied to the Centrosaurinae as a whole in 1997. The large spikes of Achelousaurus correspond to \\"Process 3\\" spikes of other centrosaurines and were similar to those of Einiosaurus, though curved more to the sides, similar to Pachyrhinosaurus. They were shorter and thinner than the corresponding spikes of Styracosaurus. Between these spikes, on both sides of the central frill notch, were two small tab-like processes (\\"Process 2\\") that were directed towards the midline. Innermost \\"Process 1\\" spikes, as present in Centrosaurus, are lacking with Achelousaurus. The frill had two large paired openings, the parietal fenestrae, with a midline parietal bar between them. A linear row of rounded swellings ran along the top of the parietal bar, which may be homologous to the spikes and horns in the same area of some Pachyrhinosaurus specimens. A row of relatively small processes ran along the parietal shield margin from the \\"Process 3\\" spikes outwards, for a total per side of seven. They were largely equal in size, causing the P4 process to be reduced in comparison to the P3. These lower processes appear to have been capped by epoccipitals, bones that lined the frills of ceratopsids. In Achelousaurus these epoccipitals, which start as separate skin ossifications or osteoderms, fuse with the underlying frill bone to form spikes, at least in the third position. In 2020, it was denied that these processes were separate ossifications. In the most mature individuals, the front-most P6 and P7 processes would be less imbricated relative to each other, rotated around their longitudinal axes. Keratin sheaths Snout regions of MOR 591 and 485 The bosses on the skull of Achelousaurus may have been covered in a keratinous sheath in life, but their shape in a living animal is uncertain. In 2009, the paleontologist Tobin L. Hieronymus and colleagues examined correlations between skull morphology, horn, and skin features of modern horned animals, and examined the skull of centrosaurine dinosaurs for the same correlates. They proposed that the rugose bosses of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were covered by thick pads of cornified (or keratinized) skin, similar to the boss of modern muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus). The nasal horncore of adult Achelousaurus had an upward slant and its upper surface had correlates for a thick epidermal (outer layer of skin) pad that graded into correlates for a cornified sheath on the sides. A thick pad of epidermis may have grown from the V-shaped pitted notch at the tip of the nasal horncore. The growth direction of the nasal pad would have been towards the front. The supraorbital bosses may have had a thick pad of epidermis, which grew at a sideways angle similar to the curved horncores of Coronosaurus, as indicated by the orientation of the \\"fins\\" or ridges on the bosses. That the supraorbital bosses lacked a sulcus (or furrow) at their bases indicates that their horn pads stopped at the wrinkled edges of the bosses. The pitting might indicate a softer growing layer connecting the hard inner bone with the hard horn sheath. In addition, correlates for a rostral scale in front of the nasal boss and scale rows along the parietal midline and supraorbital-squamosal region were identified. Evolution =Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis= Diagram showing evolutionary lineage proposed by Horner et al., 1992 In 1992, the study by Horner et al. tried to account for the fact that within a limited geological period of time (about half a million years) there had been a quick succession of animal communities in the upper Two Medicine Formation. Normally, this would be interpreted as a series of invasions, with the new animal types replacing the old ones. But Horner noted that the newer forms often had a strong similarity to the previous types. This suggested to him that he had discovered a rare proof of evolution in action: the later fauna was basically the old one but at a more evolved stage. The various types found were not distinct species but transitional forms developed within a process of anagenesis. This conformed to the assumption, prevalent at the time, that a species should last about two to three million years. A further indication, according to Horner, was the failure to identify true autapomorphies ‚Äì unique traits that prove a taxon is a separate species. The fossils instead showed a gradual change from basal (or ancestral) into more derived characters. Reconstructed skull of Einiosaurus, the direct ancestor of Achelousaurus according to Horner, in the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles The horned dinosaurs discovered by Horner exemplified this phenomenon. In the lowest layers of the Two Medicine Formation, below the overlaying Bearpaw Formation, \\"Transitional Taxon A\\" was present. It seemed to be identical to Styracosaurus albertensis, differing from it only in the possession of just a single pair of parietal spikes. The middle layers, below the Bearpaw, contained \\"Transitional Taxon B\\" that also had a single spike pair but differed in the form of its nasal horn that curved to the front over the anterior branches of the nasal bones. In the upper strata, below the Bearpaw, \\"Transitional Taxon C\\" had been excavated. It too had a spike pair but now the nasal horn was fused with the front branches. The upper surface of the horn was elevated and very rough. The orbital horns showed coarse ridges. Subsequently, \\"Taxon A\\" was named Stellasaurus, \\"Taxon B\\" became Einiosaurus, while \\"Taxon C\\" became Achelousaurus. In 1992, Horner et al. did not name these as species for the explicit reason that the entire evolutionary sequence was seen as representing a grade of transitional ceratopsians between Styracosaurus albertensis, known from the Judith River Formation, and the derived, hornless Pachyrhinosaurus from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, which had the spike pair and bosses on the nose and above the eyes, as well as additional frill ornamentation. In 1997, Horner referred to the three taxa as \\"centrosaurine 1.,\\" \\"centrosaurine 2.,\\" and \\"centrosaurine 3..\\" Horner thought he had found the mechanism driving this evolution, elaborating on ideas he had developed even before he had investigated Landslide Butte. The animals were living on a narrow strip on the east-coast of Laramidia, bordering the Western Interior Seaway and constrained in the west by the high proto-Rocky Mountains. During the Bearpaw Transgression sea levels were rising, steadily reducing the width of their coastal habitat from about to . This led to stronger selection pressures, the severest for Achelousaurus which lived during the phase that the coastal strip was at its narrowest. The lower number of individuals that the smaller habitat could have sustained constituted a population bottleneck, making rapid evolution possible. Increased sexual selection would have induced changes in the sexual ornamentation such as spikes, horns and bosses. A reduced environmental stress by lower sea levels on the other hand, would be typified by adaptive radiation. That sexual selection had indeed been the main mechanism would be proven by the fact that young individuals of all three populations were very similar: they all had two frill spikes, a small nasal horn pointing to the front, and orbital horns in the form of slightly elevated knobs. Only in the adult phase did they begin to differ. According to Horner, this also showed that the populations were very closely related. Skull cast of Pachyrhinosaurus, a descendant of Achelousaurus according to Horner, at the Museum of Natural Sciences of Belgium Horner did not perform an exact cladistic analysis determining the relationship between the three populations. Such an analysis calculates which evolutionary tree implies the lowest number of evolutionary changes and therefore is the most likely. He assumed that this would result in a tree in which the types were successive branches. Such a tree would, as a consequence of the method used, never show a direct ancestor- descendant relationship. Many scientists believed such a relation could never be proven anyway. Horner disagreed: he saw the gradual morphological changes as clear proof that, in this case, the evolution of one taxon into another, without a splitting of the populations, could be directly observed. Evolutionists in general would be too hesitant to recognize this. Such a transition is called anagenesis; he posited that, if the opposite, cladogenesis, could not be proven, a scientist was free to assume an anagenetic process. Basing himself on revised data, Sampson in 1995 estimated that the layers investigated represented a longer period of time than the initially assumed 500,000 years: after the deposition of Gilmore's Brachyceratops quarry, 860,000 years would have passed, and after the Einiosaurus beds 640,000 years, until the maximal extent of the Bearpaw transgression. He did not adopt Horner's hypothesis of anagenesis but assumed speciation took place, with the populations splitting. These time intervals were still short enough to indicate that the rate of speciation must have been high, which might have been true of all centrosaurines of the late Campanian. Stratigraphic and temporal relationship of taxa hypothesized as representing an anagenetic lineage by Wilson et al., 2020 In 1996, Dodson raised two objections to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, the possession of just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested to him that the Einiosaurus‚ÄìAchelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological time interval between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria. In 2010, Horner admitted that specimen TMP 2002.76.1 seemed to indicate that Achelousaurus was not descended from Einiosaurus, as it preceded both in age, and yet had a nasal boss. But he stressed that even if the lineages split off, its ancestor might have resembled Einiosaurus. Furthermore, it might still be possible that Einiosaurus was a direct descendant of Rubeosaurus. Also, the process of rapid displacements and extinctions of species could in his opinion still be elegantly explained by a westward expansion of the Bearpaw Sea. The process of anagenesis was affirmed by John Wilson and Jack Scannella in 2016, who studied the ontogenetic changes in horned dinosaurs. They compared a small Einiosaurus specimen, MOR 456 8-8-87-1, with Achelousaurus specimen MOR 591\\\\. Both proved to be quite similar, with the main differences being a longer face in MOR 456 8-8-87-1, and a sharper supraorbital horncore in MOR 591\\\\. They concluded that Achelousaurus was likely the direct descendant of Einiosaurus. The more adult Einiosaurus individuals approached the Achelousaurus morphology. The differences between the two taxa would have been caused by heterochrony ‚Äì differential changes in the speed the various traits developed during the lifetime of an individual. Since Wilson and colleagues found in 2020 that Stellasaurus (Horner's \\"Taxon A\\") was intermediate between Styracosaurus and Einiosaurus in morphology and stratigraphy, they could not discount that it was a transitional taxon within an anagenetic lineage. =Classification= In 1995, Sampson formally placed Achelousaurus in the Ceratopsidae, more precisely the Centrosaurinae. In all analyses, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are part of the clade Pachyrhinosaurini. By definition, Achelousaurus is a member of the clade Pachyrostra (or \\"thick-snouts\\"), in which it is united with Pachyrhinosaurus. In 2010, Gregory S. Paul assigned A. horneri to the genus Centrosaurus, as C. horneri. This has found no acceptance among other researchers, with subsequent taxonomic assessments invariably keeping the generic name Achelousaurus. =Phylogeny= Phylogenetic analyses have varied in the closeness of the relationship between Achelousaurus and Styracosaurus; here, a skull at the American Museum of Natural History Sampson felt, in 1995, that there was not enough evidence to conclude that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis. Subsequent studies have sought to determine the precise relationships within this part of the evolutionary tree, with conflicting results regarding the question whether Styracosaurus albertensis or Einiosaurus might have been in the direct line of ascent to Achelousaurus. In 2005, an analysis by Michael Ryan and Anthony Russell found Styracosaurus more closely related to Achelousaurus than to Centrosaurus. This was confirmed by analyses by Ryan in 2007, Nicholas Longrich in 2010, and Xu et al. in 2010. The same year Horner and Andrew T. McDonald moved Styracosaurus ovatus to its own genus, Rubeosaurus, finding it a sister species of Einiosaurus, while Styracosaurus albertensis was again located on the Centrosaurus branch. They also assigned specimen MOR 492, the basis of \\"Taxon A\\", to Rubeosaurus. In 2011, a subsequent study by Andrew T. McDonald in this respect replicated the outcome of his previous one, as did a publication by Andre Farke et al. In 2017, J.P. Wilson and Ryan further complicated the issue, concluding that MOR 492 (\\"Taxon A\\") was not referable to Rubeosaurus and announcing that yet another genus would be named for it. Wilson and colleagues moved MOR 492 to the new genus Stellasaurus in 2020, which therefore corresponds to \\"Taxon A\\". Their study found Rubeosaurus ovatus to be the sister species of Styracosaurus albertensis, and concluded Rubeosaurus to be synonymous with Styracosaurus. Before Achelousaurus was described, Pachyrhinosaurus canadensis had been considered a solitary aberrant form among centrosaurines, set apart from them by its unusual bosses. Achelousaurus gave evolutionary context to the Canadian species, while expanding the temporal and geographical range for what came to be seen as \\"pachyrhinosaurs.\\" In all analyses, Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus were sister groups. In 2008, another closely related species was named, Pachyrhinosaurus lakustai. In that study, the term \\"Pachyrhinosaurs\\" was used for the clade consisting of Achelousaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus. When Pachyrhinosaurus perotorum was described in 2012, the clade name Pachyrostra was coined, uniting the two genera; Achelousaurus is the basalmost pachyrostran. Shared derived traits (or synapomorphies) of the group are an enlarged nasal ornamentation and a change of the nasal and brow horns into bosses. At the end of the Campanian, there seems to have been a trend of pachyrostrans replacing other centrosaurines. Also in 2012, the clade Pachyrhinosaurini was named, consisting of species more closely related to Pachyrhinosaurus or Achelousaurus than to Centrosaurus. Apart from Einiosaurus and Rubeosaurus, this included Sinoceratops and Xenoceratops, according to a 2013 study. Cladistic analyses develop gradually, reflecting new discoveries and insights. Their results can be shown in a cladogram, with the relationships found ordered in an evolutionary tree. The cladogram below shows the phylogenetic position of Achelousaurus in a cladogram from Wilson and colleagues, 2020. Nasal horn of Stellasaurus, the possible ancestor of Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus Ceratopsid skull casts positioned in a phylogenetic tree, in the Natural History Museum of Utah, with Achelousaurus (cast of MOR 485) third from the upper left row (number 03) Paleobiology =Function of skull ornamentation= display value In 1995, Sampson noted that earlier studies had found that the horns and frills of ceratopsians most likely had a function in intraspecific display and combat, and that these features would therefore have resulted from sexual selection for successful mating. Likewise, in 1997 Horner concluded that such ornamentation was used by males to establish dominance and that females would have preferred well- equipped males as their offspring would then inherit these traits, conferring a reproduction benefit. Dodson thought that in the Centrosaurinae in general the display value of the frill had been reduced compared to the nasal and supraorbital ornamentation. Sampson in 1995 rejected the possibility that the difference in skull ornamentation between Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus represented sexual dimorphism, for three reasons. Firstly, the extensive Einiosaurus bone beds did not contain any specimens with bosses, as would have been expected if one of the sexes had them. Secondly, Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus are found in strata of a different age. Thirdly, in a situation of sexual dimorphism usually only one of the sexes shows exaggerated secondary sexual characters. Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus however, each have developed a distinct set of such traits. Hieronymus, in 2009, concluded that the nasal and supraorbital bosses were used for butting or ramming the head or the flank of a rival. The bone structure indicates that the bosses were covered by cornified pads as in modern muskoxen, suggesting dominance fights similar to those of members of the Caprinae subfamily. In the latter group, an evolutionary transition can be observed, where the originally straight horns become more robust, padded, and increasingly curved downwards. The evolution from horncores into bosses in Centrosaurinae would likewise have reflected a change in fighting technique, from clashing to high-energy head-butting. Head- butting would have been an expensive and risky behavior. Opponents would have engaged this way only after assessing each other's strengths visually. For this reason, Hieronymus considered it unlikely that the bosses served for species recognition as this was already guaranteed by the innate species- specific display rituals preceding a real ‚Äì instead of a ritual ‚Äì fight. The bosses would have evolved for actual combat, part of a social selection in which individuals competed for scarce resources such as mates, food and breeding grounds. Restoration of Achelousaurus, Einiosaurus, and a tyrannosaur Previously it had been suggested that the fusion of the first three neck vertebrae, such as seen in the mature specimen MOR 571, might have been a paleopathology, an instance of the disease spondyloarthropathy, but in 1997 it was concluded that it was more likely a normal ontogenetic trait, the vertebrae growing together to form a so-called \\"syncervical\\" to support the heavy head. All three main known specimens have syncervicals consisting of three fused neck vertebrae; the trait could have been inherited from a smaller ancestor using a stiffer neck for burrowing or food acquisition. =Social behavior= It has been claimed that ceratopsian dinosaurs were herding animals, due to the large number of known bone beds containing multiple members of the same ceratopsian species. In 2010, Hunt and Farke pointed out that this was mainly true for centrosaurine ceratopsians. Horner assumed that the horned dinosaurs at Landslide Butte lived in herds which had been killed by drought or disease. Dodson concluded that the fact that the Achelousaurus bone beds were monospecific (containing only one species) confirmed the existence of herds. =Metabolism= There has long been debate about the thermoregulation of dinosaurs, centered around whether they were ectotherms (\\"cold-blooded\\") or endotherms (\\"warm-blooded\\"). Mammals and birds are homeothermic endotherms, which generate their own body heat and have a high metabolism, whereas reptiles are heterothermic ectotherms, which receive their body heat from their surroundings. A 1996 study examined the oxygen isotopes from bone phosphates of animals from the Two Medicine Formation, including the juvenile Achelousaurus specimen MOR 591\\\\. Œ¥18O values of phosphate in vertebrate bones depend on the Œ¥18O values in their body water and the temperature when the bones were deposited, making it possible to measure fluctuations in temperature for each bone of an individual when they were deposited. The study analyzed seasonal variations in the body temperature and differences in temperature between skeletal regions, to determine whether the dinosaurs maintained their temperature seasonally. A varanid lizard fossil sampled for the study showed isotopic variation consistent with it being an heterothermic ectotherm. The variation of the dinosaurs, including Achelousaurus, was consistent with them being homeothermic endotherms. The metabolic rate of these dinosaurs was likely not as high as that of modern mammals and birds, and they may have been intermediate endotherms. Paleoenvironment Laramidia, where Achelousaurus lived, was a separate subcontinent during the Campanian age Achelousaurus is known from the Two Medicine Formation, which preserves coastal sediments dating from the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, between 83 and 74 million years ago. Achelousaurus specimens are found in the highest levels of the formation, probably closer to the end of that timeframe, 74 million years ago. The Two Medicine Formation is typified by a warm semiarid climate. Its layers were deposed on the east coast of the Laramidia island continent (which consisted of western North America). The high cordillera in the west, combined with predominantly western winds, would have caused a rain shadow, limiting annual rainfall. Rain would mainly have fallen during the summer, when convection storms flooded the landscape. The climate would thus also have been very seasonal, with a long dry season and a short wet season. Vegetation would have been sparse and little varied. In such conditions, horned dinosaurs would have been dependent on oxbow lakes for a continuous supply of water and food ‚Äì the main river channels tending to run dry earlier ‚Äì and perished in them during severe droughts when the animals concentrated around the last watering holes, causing bone beds to form. The brown paleosol in which the horned dinosaurs were found ‚Äì a mixture of clay and coalified wood fragments ‚Äì resembles that of modern seasonally dry swamps. The surrounding vegetation might have consisted of about high conifer trees. Achelousaurus ate much smaller plants, though: a 2013 study determined that ceratopsid herbivores on Laramidia were restricted to feeding on vegetation with a height of or lower. More or less contemporary dinosaur genera of the area included Prosaurolophus, Scolosaurus, Hypacrosaurus, Einiosaurus and tyrannosaurids of uncertain classification. As proven by tooth marks, horned dinosaur fossils in the Landslide Butte Field Area had been scavenged by a large theropod predator, which Rogers suggested were Albertosaurus. Biogeography of centrosaurine dinosaurs during the Campanian The exact composition of the fauna Achelousaurus was part of is uncertain, as its fossils have not been discovered in direct association with other taxa. Its intermediate anagenetic position suggests that Achelousaurus shared its habitat with forms roughly found in the middle or at the end of the time range of its formation. As with horned dinosaurs, Horner assumed he had found transitional taxa in other dinosaur groups of the Two Medicine Formation. One of these was a form in between Lambeosaurus and Hypacrosaurus; in 1994 he would name it Hypacrosaurus stebingeri. Today, Hypacrosaurus stebingeri is no longer seen as having evolved through anagenesis because autapomorphies of the species have been identified. Horner saw some pachycephalosaur skulls as indicative for a taxon in between Stegoceras and Pachycephalosaurus; these have not been consistently referred to a new genus. Finally, Horner thought there was a taxon present that was transitional between Daspletosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. In 2017, tyrannosaurid remains from the Two Medicine Formation were named as a new species of Daspletosaurus: Daspletosaurus horneri. The 2017 study considered it plausible that D. horneri was a direct descendant of D. torosus in a process of anagenesis, but rejected the possibility that D. horneri was the ancestor of Tyrannosaurus. Other ceratopsians from the Two Medicine Formation include Einiosaurus and Stellasaurus. In addition, remains of other indeterminate and dubious centrosaurines, including Brachyceratops, are known from the formation and though they may represent younger stages of the three valid genera, this is not possible to demonstrate. Whereas Horner assumed that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were separate in time, in 2010 Donald M. Henderson considered it possible that at least their descendants or ancestors were overlapping or sympatric and thus would have competed for food sources unless there had been niche partitioning. The skull of Achelousaurus was more than twice as strong than that of Einiosaurus in its bending strength and torsion resistance. This might have indicated a difference in diet to avoid competition. The bite strength of Achelousaurus, measured as an ultimate tensile strength, was 30.5 newtons per square millimeter (N/mm¬≤) at the maxillary tooth row and 18 N/mm¬≤ at the beak. Wilson and colleagues found that since the Two Medicine centrosaurines were separated stratigraphically, they were therefore possibly not contemporaneous. The indeterminate specimen TMP 2002.76.1 is from the Dinosaur Park Formation and, if it belongs to Achelousaurus, the genus would be the stratigraphically oldest known pachyrhinosaurine taxon. Achelousaurus would then also be the only Campanian ceratopsid known from more than one formation. Both animals occur right below the marine shales of the Bearpaw Formation, but due to longitudinal differences, TMP 2002.76.1 is about 500,000 years older than the Achelousaurus fossils from the Two Medicine Formation.

Putnam had been involved in research around the G7 summits between 1976 and 1979. However at the fourth summit, held in Bonn in 1978, he observed a qualitative shift in how the negotiations worked. The model views international negotiations between states as consisting of simultaneous negotiations at both the intranational level (i.e. domestic) and the international level (i.e. between governments). Over domestic negotiations, the chief negotiator absorbs the concern of societal actors and builds coalitions with them; at the international level, the chief negotiator seeks an agreement that is amongst the possible \\"wins\\" in his state's \\"win- set\\". Win-sets are the possible outcomes that are likely to be accepted by the domestic interest groups who either must ratify the agreement or provide some other form of government backing. International agreements occur when there is an overlap between the win-sets of the states involved in the international negotiations.

In 2003, it was extended north by sharing a common alignment with Highway 2 for until it splits to Deerfoot Trail (Highway 2) Macleod Trail (Highway 2A) and ends in the City of Calgary at Highway 22X (Spruce Meadows Trail) / Highway 201 (Stoney Trail). Macleod Trail continues north into downtown Calgary but does not carry a highway designation. Near De Winton, Highway 2A splits to the southwest, connecting Calgary to Okotoks. = Major intersections =  Central Alberta  Highway 2A runs adjacent to the Queen Elizabeth II Highway between Calgary and Edmonton, although it does not enter either city. Highway 2A generally runs parallel to the Canadian Pacific Railway Calgary-Edmonton line, which runs to the west of Highway 2 between Crossfield and Red Deer, and to the east of Highway 2 between Red Deer and Leduc. Highway 2A is divided into two subsections with a gap between Bowden and Innisfail. The first subsection of Highway 2A starts at the Highway 2 / Highway 72 interchange (Exit 295) and passes through the town of Crossfield, town of Carstairs, and by the town of Didsbury before entering the town of Olds along 46 Avenue and intersects Highway 27 (46 Street). The highway continues north to the town of Bowden before terminating at Highway 587, just west of Highway 2 (Exit 357). The second subsection begins in the town of Innisfail at Highway 590 (50 Street), just west of Highway 2 (Exit 368), along 42 Avenue. The highway continues north and passes through the town of Penhold before entering the city of Red Deer along Taylor Drive. The highway turns east along 19 Street and then north along Gaetz Avenue. Highway 2A splits into one-way couplets through downtown Red Deer, with northbound traffic following 49 Avenue and southbound traffic following portions of Gaetz Avenue and 51 Avenue. After crossing the Red Deer River, the one-way streets rejoin and intersect Highway 11 (67 Street) and Highway 11A, which forms Red Deer's northern city limit.

A number of tributaries of the river, including its largest, the West Branch Lac qui Parle River, also flow in eastern South Dakota. Via the Minnesota River, the Lac qui Parle River is part of the watershed of the Mississippi River, draining an area of in an agricultural region. Slightly more than two-thirds of the Lac qui Parle watershed is in Minnesota. Lac qui parle means \\"the lake which speaks\\" in the French language, and was a translation of the Sioux name for Lac qui Parle, a lake on the Minnesota River upstream of the mouth of the Lac qui Parle River. The source of the river is Lake Hendricks on the boundary of Lincoln County, Minnesota, and Brookings County, South Dakota. It issues from the lake in Hendricks, Minnesota, and flows northeastwardly through northwestern Lincoln County as an intermittent stream on the Coteau des Prairies, a morainic plateau dividing the Mississippi and Missouri River watersheds, into western Yellow Medicine County, where it flows off the Coteau, dropping 250 feet (76 m) in eight miles (13 km). Continuing northeastwardly through flat till plains with occasional willows and cottonwoods along its banks, the river flows into eastern Lac qui Parle County, passing to the east of Dawson.

The altarpiece (13.5 √ó 6.6 metres, depicting the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary, by Girolamo Michelangelo Grigoletti) is the largest painting in the world painted on a single piece of canvas. The basilica is also known for Bak√≥cz Chapel (named after Tam√°s Bak√≥cz), built by Italian masters between 1506-1507 out of red marble of S√ºtt≈ë, its walls adorned with Tuscan Renaissance motifs. It is the most precious remaining example of Renaissance art in Hungary. The huge crypt, built in Old Egyptian style in 1831, is today the resting place of late archbishops, among others, J√≥zsef Mindszenty, famous for his opposition to both Nazi and Communist rule. History The building of the present church took place on the foundation of several earlier churches. The first was built by Stephen I of Hungary between 1001‚Äì1010 (as the original Saint Adalbert church), the first cathedral in Hungary, which was burned down at the end of the 12th century. It was rebuilt, and even survived the Mongol invasion of Hungary. However, in 1304, Wenceslaus III, a probable candidate for the Hungarian throne, sacked the castle and the church. It was repaired in the following years. The archbishops of the 14th and 15th century made the church more ornate and added a huge library, the second most significant one in the country. It was ruined again under Turkish rule, in 1543. In 1820, the Archdiocese was restored and archbishop S√°ndor Rudnay decided to restore Esztergom's status as mother church of the country. The church maintains the relics of Catholic martyr and saint Marko Krizin. One of the Basilica's arches. The architect was P√°l K√ºhnel and the lead contractor was J√°nos Packh. The foundation-stone was laid and work began in 1822. The Bak√≥cz chapel was carefully disassembled (into about 1,600 pieces) and was moved 20 metres away from its original location and attached to the new basilica. In 1838 Packh was murdered, so J√≥zsef Hild was placed in charge of construction. He completed it in Classicistic style. Under the next archbishop, J√°nos Scitovszky, the upper church was completed and dedicated on August 31, 1856. The 1856 consecration ceremonies featured the premiere of the Missa solennis zur Einweihung der Basilika in Gran (Gran Mass), composed and conducted by Franz Liszt, and featuring the organist Alexander Winterberger. The final completion of the cathedral took place twelve years later in 1869.

Summer Olympics"},{"id":"1792566","text":"In entertainment, a virtual band (also called a virtual idol, virtual group, cartoon group, or cartoon band) is a fictional band or music group whose members are not depicted as corporeal musicians, but animated characters. Although the characters are fictional, the band itself exists outside a television and film universe, in reality. The music is recorded (and, in the case of concerts, performed) by human musicians and producers, while any media related to the virtual band, including albums, video clips and the visual component of stage performances, feature the animated line-up; in many cases the virtual band members have been credited as the writers and performers of the songs. Live performances can become rather complex, requiring perfect synchronization between the visual and audio components of the show. The term virtual band was popularised with Gorillaz in 2000, though the concept of the virtual band was first demonstrated by Alvin and the Chipmunks in 1958, when their creator, Ross Bagdasarian, accelerated recordings of his own voice to achieve the 'chipmunk voice'. There have since been numerous virtual bands that have recorded material. Computer animation, traditional animation, and vocal mixing and manipulation are common features. The term virtual idol originates from Japan, where it dates back to the 1980s and has roots in anime and Japanese idol culture. Popular virtual idols include the Vocaloid singer Hatsune Miku and the virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI. The term has also come to be used for music groups who collaborate using the Internet, no longer requiring the members to be present in the same place.  Members  The members of virtual groups are depicted as animated characters, with their own personality, voice, history, and playing style. For example, Alvin, the leader of the Chipmunks, is considered mischievous, and Skeleton Staff's Guitarist Stanton is a party-going underachiever. Furthermore, Freen in Green's bassist Sparky is sluggish and has been described as egotistical and pretentious, while Murdoc of Gorillaz is a middle-aged satanic bass player. Another example is Hatsune Miku who does not have a definite personality; because her way of being depends on the fans, her personality changes in each song made by the users of Vocaloid. The style of animation used for depicting the characters varies. Some groups, like The Archies, Gorillaz, Dethklok, The Banana Splits, One-T and Alvin and the Chipmunks, are hand-drawn characters, and much of their media uses traditional animation and cartooning techniques. Others, such as Hatsune Miku, JuJu Eyeballs, Crazy Frog, Genki Rockets, Gummib%C3%A4r, Pinocchio and The Bots, are computer-generated. Some people consider puppetry as a form of animation; this consideration means groups like Dr. Teeth and the Electric Mayhem, can be considered virtual bands.  Production  = In studio = The recording of the music is done by the human musicians and artists, whom the virtual artists are depicted to emulate. In some cases, the singing is done by machines or synthesizer applications, like the Hatsune Miku vocaloid. This is done using the normal in-studio recording process; see Sound recording for a detailed explanation. In some instances, most notably The Chipmunks, manipulation of voices may be employed, either to achieve a desired vocal effect, or to make it dissimilar to the voice of the actual singer. The manipulation is done by either modifying the playback speed of the vocal track or by putting it through a synthesizer (Vocoding). Writing and production credits may be assigned to either the virtual band characters, or the human writers and artists involved. = On stage = One of two methods can be employed for live performances. The first involves animating the entire set, with little or no allowance for audience interaction, then 'performing' it as is. The major pitfall with this method is the lack of audience interaction, which can be vital during concerts. This is best suited to short performances, where audience response can be predicted. The second, and more complex, method differs from the first in that allowance is made for a variety of responses and interaction. This means having a wide range of animated sequences ready to play, with matching spoken lines, in response to different reactions. In both cases, extensive rehearsal is required to synchronize spoken lines and instrumentation with animated action. This can be eliminated by using pre- recorded music and speech; however, doing so also weakens the actual 'live' experience. (Some non-virtual artists and groups have employed a similar technique on some concert tours and performances. DJ Shadow, for example, on his In Tune and On Time tour, had pre-animated sequences, which were played on giant screens behind him while he performed the set. Again, a large amount of pre-tour planning and synchronisation rehearsal was required beforehand.Detailed in a behind-the-tour interview with DJ Shadow on the Live! In Tune and On Time DVD)  History  = Early history = While the term had not been coined at the time, Alvin and the Chipmunks were the first virtual band to appear. Centered on Alvin, his two brothers Simon and Theodore, and their manager/father Dave Seville, their voices were created by Ross Bagdasarian, Sr., who accelerated the recording of his voice to create the distinctive sound; the process earned him two Grammys in 1959 for engineering. The success of the Chipmunks spurred on another group, the Nutty Squirrels, to join the ranks. A scat-singing version of Bagdasarian's creation, they made the American Top 40 with their song \\"Uh-Oh\\". Their success, however, was short-lived. = Television = The Archies were the first virtual band to appear in worldwide pop charts. During this time, other television programs, such as Josie and the Pussycats and The Muppet Show, began to include bands as part of the format (in the case of Josie and the Pussycats, the eponymous band was the show's focus). Some of the groups that appeared on these shows released mainstream recordings. Some bands, however, would 'break up' after the end of the show's run. After The Archies, produced by Filmation, became a huge pop hit, Hanna-Barbera started releasing several cartoon TV shows with the adventures of rock bands, such as Josie and the Pussycats, The Cattanooga Cats, The Impossibles, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kids, Jabberjaw, and others. During the 1980s, Hasbro released Jem, an animated TV series featuring two enemy bands with a music video in each episode. Virtual bands still appear in television: the Chipmunks appeared in their own television show for much of the 1990s, and the Adult Swim show Metalocalypse features the virtual melodic death metal band Dethklok. = Japanese virtual idols = Virtual idols originate from Japan, with roots in anime and Japanese idol culture, and dating back to the 1980s, starting with the Macross mecha anime franchise (adapted into the Robotech franchise in North America). The first virtual idol was Lynn Minmay, a fictional singer who is one of the main characters in the anime television series Super Dimension Fortress Macross (1982) and the animated film adaptation Macross: Do You Remember Love? (1984). Voiced by Mari Iijima, Lynn Minmay became the first fictional idol singer to garner major real-world success. The theme song \\"Do You Remember Love?\\" (from the film Macross: Do You Remember Love?) reached number seven on the Oricon music charts in Japan, and the song has since been covered numerous times over the next several decades. The Japanese cyberpunk anime Megazone 23 (1985) took the virtual idol concept further with EVE, who is depicted as a computer-based artificial intelligence (AI) who takes the form of a virtual idol within a proto-Matrix-like virtual reality. Megazone 23 was a success in Japan partly due to the appeal of EVE, and it was later adapted into Robotech: The Movie (1986) in North America. A similar concept later appeared in Macross Plus (1994) with the virtual idol Sharon Apple, a computer program who takes the form of an intergalactic pop star. The same year, the fictional Japanese rock band Fire Bomber from Macross 7 (1994) became a commercial success, spawning multiple CDs released in Japan. The Japanese talent agency Horipro created the first real-life AI virtual idol, Kyoko Date, in 1995. Her creation was inspired by the success of the Macross franchise and dating sim games such as Tokimeki Memorial (1994), along with advances in computer graphics. Her initial announcement drew headlines, both in Japan and internationally, before she debuted as a CGI idol in 1996. However, she failed to gain commercial success, largely due to technical limitations leading to issues such as unnatural movement (an issue known as the uncanny valley). Despite her failure, she provided the template for later virtual idols who gained commercial success in the early 21st century, such as the Vocaloid singer Hatsune Miku and the virtual YouTuber Kizuna AI. In 2007, Crypton Future Media and Yamaha launched Vocaloid 2, with the voice bank of Hatsune Miku. In 2009, Hatsune Miku had her first concert. Other Vocaloids include Meiko, Kaito, Kagamine Rin and Len, and Megurine Luka. Virtual bands can also originate from video games, as proven by the 2015 Wii U game Splatoon, which features songs credited to various virtual bands, the most notable being a pop duo called the Squid Sisters, who have performed several real world concerts as holograms. The game's 2017 Nintendo Switch sequel, Splatoon 2, introduces more virtual bands, most notably Off the Hook, a duo similar to the Squid Sisters. The two duos have performed together as holograms. Prior to it, Nintendo had already made a virtual band composed of characters from Pikmin called Strawberry Flower, to promote the games. Their first single, Ai no Uta, was a massive success in Japan, reaching #2 on the Weekly Oricon Top 200 Singles chart. = Western virtual bands = Britain's Gorillaz was formed by Blur's Damon Albarn and Tank Girls Jamie Hewlett in 1998 and produced by Deltron 3030's Dan the Automator. The group brought virtual bands to the musical fore again, with their scoring numerous Top 20 positions around the world. The band has since released six studio albums: their self-titled debut album Gorillaz, Demon Days, Plastic Beach, The Fall, Humanz, and The Now Now, in addition to two B-sides albums and two EPs. One-T was a similar French virtual band concept created by Eddy Gronfier and Thomas Pieds that centred around a fictional animated hip-hop group. It saw brief success in the early 2000s with the hit singles Music Is the One-T ODC and The Magic Key but since then only showed little activity. Dethklok is an animated heavy metal band that originates from the Adult Swim animated television series Metalocalypse. They have released three albums so far. K/DA is a virtual K-pop girl group consisting of four themed versions of League of Legends characters, which unveiled at the 2018 League of Legends World Championship with an augmented reality live performance of their first song, \\"Pop/Stars\\".

He was a powerful shaman and sachem (chief) of the Pennacook, eventually becoming bashaba (chief of chiefs) of a multi-tribal confederation that drew together for mutual protection against the Mohawk Nation. In his old age Passaconaway relinquished his positions of authority to travel among the tribes and settlers in the New Hampshire-Massachusetts-Maine area. He was revered by both Native Americans and European settlers. His native name was \\"Papisse Conewa\\", meaning, Child of the Bear, or Son of the Bear, but white settlers anglicized the name as Passaconaway. In his later years he was sometimes referred to as St. Aspenquid. Legend holds that Passaconaway was a giant, genius, and possessed magical powers, such as making water burn, and trees and rocks dance. According to folklore, he could make dried up leaves turn green and make living snakes out of dead snake skin. It was said that he could become invisible and create thunderstorms at will. Even before the Pilgrims' 1620 landing on the Massachusetts coast, a European ship's captain reported seeing a huge native standing atop a coastal cliff, surmising he was probably the native often referred to as Conway. European history records that Passaconaway lived at the top of the Pawtucket Falls at what is now Lowell, Massachusetts; a marker was placed there in 1935. Local New Hampshire history says that he lived and moved seasonally among various fishing and planting spots, including the Merrimack River falls in present-day Manchester, fertile islands in the river, coastal spots along the seashore, and other places along the Merrimack such as present-day Horseshoe Pond. Another legend indicates that Passaconaway was summoned to the Plymouth area of Massachusetts by the Wampanoag sachem Massasoit, asking Passaconaway to use his supernatural powers to rid the land of the Pilgrims who were building a village on the shore. At Massasoit's village, says the folklore, Passaconaway was for the first time in his life unable to bring up a storm. After conversing with the Great Spirit, Passaconaway declared that the Great Spirit had commanded him to live the rest of his life in peace with the white-faced tribes. From this time on, Passaconaway would not allow his sons or his tribe to fight with any European settlers, and counseled peace to all his native associates. Passaconaway was one of the first native chieftains to lease land to English settlers in New England. His second son Wonalancet eventually became sachem of the Pennacook, and his oldest son Nanamocomuck became sachem of the neighboring Wachusett. His daughter Wanunchus married Montowampate, the sagamore (chief) of the Saugus tribe north of what is now Boston (their marriage was the topic of John Greenleaf Whittier's poem \\"The Bridal of Penacook\\"), and daughter Nobhow married the sachem of the Pawtucket people. Historical records show that when each of Passaconaway's two oldest sons was arrested and jailed by a local white council, the Bashaba worked out with the white governor a peaceful settlement of the false charges and a release for each of his sons. On one occasion white settlers tried to arrest Passaconaway himself, but a sudden thunderstorm arose, slowing the posse, and the native emperor disappeared into the forest. Local New Hampshire history says that in 1647 a white preacher, John Elliot, attempted to speak with Passaconaway but was refused audience again and again before he was finally allowed to talk with the Bashaba. Eventually the minister was invited to live with the Pennacook people and teach the elderly sachem about Christianity. Legend says that after the preacher died suddenly from an illness, Passaconaway eventually decided to step down from his position of authority, announcing before an enormous crowd at the yearly native gathering that his son Wonalancet was now sachem of the Pennacook. After this, Passaconaway spent much of his time traveling from village to village for the Great Spirit, counseling prayer and peace to all who would open their homes to him. In October 1665, Passaconaway's daughter, Bess, wife of Nobb How, sold the land called Augumtoocooke (present-day Dracut, Massachusetts) to Captain John Evered, for the sum of four yards of \\"Duffill\\" and one pound of tobacco. Capt. Evered in turn sold tracts of the land to European families.History of Dracut, Massachusetts, called by the Indians Augumtoocooke and before incorporation, the wildernesse north of the Merrimac. First permanent settlement in 1669 and incorporated as a town in 1701. Silas Roger Coburn (1922) Legends of Passaconaway's death say that his body was buried in a cave in the sacred native mountain Agamenticus in southern Maine, and that at least one member of his people saw his spirit carried up to the Great Spirit's earthly abode of Agiocochook (Mount Washington) atop a sled pulled by wolves and covered with hundreds of animal skins given to him by his people and his fellow sachems. There he burst into flame and was carried up to the heavens to live with the Great Spirit. (Chief Passaconaway has often been confused with St. Aspinquid.) The present-day Kancamagus Highway, a scenic two-lane highway through the White Mountains of New Hampshire, bears the name of Passaconaway's grandson, Kancamagus.  Village  The Kancamagus Highway passes the former village of Passaconaway, much of which is now part of the White Mountain National Forest. The village of Passaconaway once contained a sawmill, hotel and post office, as well as several farms and homes. For a few years a logging railroad ran through the area.Beals, Charles Edward, Jr., Passaconaway in the White Mountains (Boston: Richard G. Badger, 1916). The author was a summer resident of the village, and later a ranger in the White Mountain National Forest. The title of the book refers to the village, not to the Pennacook leader (who had no known connection to the White Mountains). The short-lived Passaconaway Mountain Club was based there. The former settlement is located in the incorporated town of Albany, New Hampshire. Today the area is noted for its hiking and cross- country skiing trails. The U.S. Forest Service maintains the Passaconaway Campground and the Jigger Johnson Campground in this area, as well as the historic Russell-Colbath House and adjacent cemetery.WMNF official website Mountain Mount Passaconaway, a summit in the Sandwich Range of the White Mountains lying between the village of Wonalancet and the Kancamagus Highway, bears the sachem's name. Legacy The Daniel Webster Council of the Boy Scouts of America, which serves most of New Hampshire, honors Passaconaway by naming their Order of the Arrow lodge for the sachem.

Its ruins are situated in the Fier County, next to the village of Pojani (Polina), in modern-day Albania. Apollonia was founded in 588 BC by Greek colonists from Corfu and Corinth. on a site where native Illyrian tribes; . lived, and was perhaps the most important of the several classical towns known as Apollonia. Apollonia flourished in the Roman period and was home to a renowned school of philosophy, but began to decline in the 3rd century AD when its harbor started silting up as a result of an earthquake. It was abandoned by the end of Late Antiquity. The name of the city is mentioned among the modern bishoprics of the Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania (Apollonia and Fier). Apollonia is also a titular see of the Latin Church.  History  Apollonia in antiquity. The site of Apollonia lay on the territory of the Taulantii, a cluster of Illyrian tribes that remained closely involved with the settlement for centuries and lived alongside the Greek colonists.. The city was said to have originally been named Gylakeia after its founder, Gylax,. but the name was later changed to honor the god Apollo. This wasn't the only city named for the god Apollo. There were 24 other cities named Apollonia, but Illyria's Apollonia was the most important and played a major role as a trading intermediary between the Hellenists and the Illyrians. It is estimated that the city had about 60,000 inhabitants. It is mentioned by Strabo in his Geographica as \\"an exceedingly well-governed city\\",Strabo. Geographica, 7.8.316. with a fountain, gymnasium,Strabo. Geographica,Book IX, Chapter 3, 16 etc. Aristotle considered Apollonia an important example of an oligarchic system, as the descendants of the Greek colonists controlled the city and helped Illyrians to learn how to govern. The city grew rich on the slave trade and local agriculture, as well as its large harbour, said to have been able to hold a hundred ships at a time. The city also benefited from the local supply of asphalt which was a valuable commodity in ancient times, for example for caulking ships. The remains of a late sixth-century temple, located just outside the city, were reported in 2006; it is only the fifth known stone temple found in present-day Albania. Apollonia, like Dyrrachium further north, was an important port on the Illyrian coast as the most convenient link between Brundusium and northern Greece, and as one of the western starting points of the Via Egnatia leading east to Thessaloniki and Byzantium in Thrace. It had its own mint, stamping coins showing a cow suckling her calf on the obverse and a double stellate pattern on the reverse, which have been found as far away as the basin of the Danube. The city was for a time included among the dominions of Pyrrhus of Epirus. In 229 BC, it came under the control of the Roman Republic, to which it was firmly loyal; it was rewarded in 168 BC with booty seized from Gentius, the defeated king of Illyria. In 148 BC, Apollonia became part of the Roman province of Macedonia, specifically of Epirus Nova.. In the Roman Civil War between Pompey and Julius Caesar, it supported the latter, but fell to Marcus Junius Brutus in 48 BC. The later Roman emperor Augustus studied in Apollonia in 44 BC under the tutelage of Athenodorus of Tarsus; it was there that he received news of Caesar's murder. Apollonia flourished under Roman rule and was noted by Cicero in his Philippicae as magna urbs et gravis, a great and important city. Christianity was established in the city at an early stage, and bishops from Apollonia were present during the First Council of Ephesus (431) and the Council of Chalcedon (451). Its decline, however, began in the 3rd century AD, when an earthquake changed the path of the Ao√∂s, causing the harbour to silt up and the inland area to become a malaria-ridden swamp. The city became increasingly uninhabitable as the inland swamp expanded, and the nearby settlement of Avlona (modern-day Vlor√´) became dominant. By the end of antiquity, the city was largely depopulated, hosting only a small Christian community. This community (which probably is part of the site of the old city) built on a nearby hill the church of the Dormition of the Theotokos, (), part of the Ardenica Monastery. In 2020, part of the site was vandalized by unknown individuals. Two columns were knocked down, resulting in the complete collapse of the Nymphaeum. According to the site's director, the damage is \\"irreparable\\" and likely occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown. The incident was condemned by Albanian archeologists and the President of Albania, Ilir Meta.https://www.skai.gr/news/world/alvania-vandalismos-sto-nymfaio-tis- arxaioellinikis-apollonias  Discovery and excavation results  Capital of Monument of Agonothetes The city seems to have sunk with the rise of Vlora. It was \\"rediscovered\\" by European classicists in the 18th century, though it was not until the Austrian occupation of 1916‚Äì1918 that the site was investigated by archaeologists. Their work was continued by a French team between 1924‚Äì1938. Parts of the site were damaged during the Second World War. After the war, an Albanian team undertook further work from 1948 onwards, although much of the site remains unexcavated to this day. Some of the team's archeological discoveries are on display within the monastery, known as the Museum of Apollonia (opened in 1958) and other artifacts from Apollonia are in the capital Tirana. Unfortunately, during the anarchy that followed the collapse of the communist party in 1990 and reversion to capitalism, the archeological collection was plundered and the museum was temporarily closed. The ruins were also frequently dug up by plunderers for relics to be sold to collectors abroad. In December 2011, a new museum opened, under the directorship of Marin Haxhimihali. It replaced an older museum dating from 1985, and was funded by UNESCO's MDG-F Joint Programme ‚ÄùCulture and Heritage for Social and Economic Development‚Äù. In 2006, archaeologists discovered a Greek temple which dates back to the 6th century BC just outside of the Apollonia. In August 2010, a French-Albanian team of archaeologists unearthed a bust of a Roman soldier, 50 years after the discoveries of other full body statues in the 1958‚Äì1960 period expeditions, led by Albanian scholar Selim Islami and Russian Professor Blavatski. A German-Albanian team has been working on the Hellenistic theatre at Albania, throwing light on the development of Greek theatres and also local variants  Episcopal history  290px A bishopric was founded there circa 400 AD but suppressed around 599. One of the participants in the Council of Ephesus in 431 was a Felix who signed once as Bishop of Apollonia and Byllis, at another time as Bishop of Apollonia. Some assume that the two towns formed a single episcopal see, others suppose he was, strictly speaking, Bishop only of Apollonia, but was temporarily in charge also of Byllis during a vacancy of that see (apostolic administrator). One of the participants at a council held in Constantinople in 448 signed as Paulus Episcopus Apolloniada al. Apolloniatarum, civitatis sanctae ecclesiae, but it is uncertain whether he was associated with this Apollonia. At the Council of Chalcedon in 451, Eusebius subscribed simply as Bishop of Apollonia. In the letter of the bishops of Epirus Nova to the Byzantine Emperor Leo I in 458, Philocharis subscribes as Bishop of what the manuscripts call \\"Vallidus\\", and which editors think should be corrected to \\"Byllis\\". Whether Philocharis is to be considered Bishop also of Apollonia depends on the interpretation of the position of Felix in 431.Daniele Farlati- Jacopo Coleti, Illyricum Sacrum, vol.

For the Sienese he built new fortifications for the city and designed (though did not build) a remarkable dam on the Bruna River near Giuncarico. He seems to have moved back to Rome permanently by 1535. He died there the following year and was buried in the Rotunda of the Pantheon, near Raphael.The History of Painting, Sculpture, Architecture, Graving, and of Those who have Excelled in them, Book III, by P. Monier, pages 139-141. He was a painter of frescoes in the Cappella San Giovanni (Chapel of St John the Baptist) in the Duomo of Siena. His son Giovanni Sallustio was also an architect. Another son, Onorio, learned painting from his father, then became a Dominican priest in the convent of Santa Maria Sopra Minerva in Rome. He then stopped painting until requested by his superiors at San Romano di Lucca to paint the organ doors of the church.Memorie dei pi√π insigni pittori, scultori e architetti Dominicani, Volume 1, by P. Vincenzo Marchese, pages 337-337. Design and decoration of Villa Farnesina Almost all art critics ascribe the design of the Villa Chigi in Rome, now known more commonly as the Villa Farnesina, to Peruzzi. In this villa, two wings branch off from a central hall with a simple arrangement of pilasters, and a decorative frieze on the exterior of the building . Some of the frescoed paintings which adorn the interior rooms are by Peruzzi. One example is the Sala delle Prospettive, in which Peruzzi revived the perspective schemes of Melozzo da Forli and Mantegna, possibly under the influence of both. The walls of the room are painted so that when one stands toward the left, one has the illusion that one is standing in an open-air terrace, lined by pillars, looking out over a continuous landscape. The decoration of the fa√ßade, the work of Peruzzi, has almost entirely vanished, but it is documented by an anonymous French artist in a drawing, now held by the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art . To decorate this villa on the Tiber many artists were employed, and just as the style of the villa in no wise recalls the old castellated type of country-house, so the paintings in harmony with the pleasure-loving spirits of the time were thoroughly antique and uninspired by Christian ideas. Raphael designed the composition of the story of Amor and Psyche as a continuation of the Galatea. On a plate-glass vault Peruzzi painted the firmament, with the zodiacal signs, the planets, and other heavenly bodies. The interior room has a striking use of illusionistic perspective Bust and Epitaph in the Rotunda of the Pantheon, Rome, Italy. Other work Fa√ßade of Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne. Peruzzi had produced a mosaic ceiling for the church of Santa Croce in Gerusalemme, Rome; the mosaic depicts the Saviour. Other paintings ascribed to him are to be found in Sant'Onofrio and San Pietro in Montorio. That Peruzzi improved as time went on is evident in his later works, e.g., the \\"Madonna with Saints\\" in Santa Maria della Pace at Rome, and the fresco of Augustus and the Tiburtine Sibyl in Santa Maria in Portico a Fontegiusta at Siena. As our master interested himself in the decorative art also, he exercised a strong influence in this direction, not only by his own decorative paintings but also by furnishing designs for craftsmen of various kinds. While primarily known as an architect, one of his great loves was drawing. His extraordinary pen and ink drawings for the basilica of St. Peter's are preserved in the Prints and Drawings Collection of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence.Ann C.

He decided to adopt a religious life at the age of 22. Early life and career St Francis Caracciolo was born in Villa Santa Maria in the Abruzzo region, in the Kingdom of Naples. He belonged to the Pisquizio branch of the Caracciolo family and received in baptism the name of Ascanio. From a young age, he had a reputation for gentleness and uprightness. When he was 22, he was attacked by one of the several skin complaints collectively described as \\"leprosy\\" in those days. So serious was this attack that he was considered hopeless. With death so near, he made a vow that if he regained his health, he would spend the rest of his life in the service of God and his fellow men. He recovered so quickly after this vow, that his cure was considered miraculous. Eager to fulfil his promise to God, he went to Naples to study for the priesthood. In 1587 he was ordained priest and joined the confraternity of the Bianchi della Giustizia (The White Robes of Justice), whose object was to assist condemned criminals to die holy deaths. Congregation of Minor Clerics Regular (Adorno Fathers) Five years after he went to Naples, a letter from Venerable Fr. Giovanni Agostino Adorno of Genoa to another Caracciolo, Fabrizio, begging him to take part in founding a new religious institute, was delivered by mistake to the newly ordained priest, and he saw in this circumstance an assurance of the Divine Will towards him (1588). He assisted in drawing up rules for the new congregation, which was approved by Pope Sixtus V, July 1, 1588, and confirmed by Pope Gregory XIV on February 18, 1591, and reconfirmed by Pope Clement VIII on June 1, 1592. The institute founded thereby, named the Congregation of the Clerics Regular Minor (the \\"Adorno Fathers\\"), is both contemplative and active. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is one of the pillars of their life.\\"St. Francis Caracciolo\\", Catholic News Agency To the three usual vows a fourth is added, namely, that its members must not aspire to ecclesiastical dignities outside the order nor seek them within it. Perpetual adoration of the Blessed Sacrament is kept up by rotation, and self-mortification is practised. The motto of the order \\"Ad majorem Resurgentis gloriam\\" (\\"to the greater glory of the Risen One\\") was chosen because Francis and Augustine Adorno made their profession at Naples on Low Sunday, April 9, 1589. Upon making his profession, Caracciolo took the name Francis in honor of the saint of Assisi. The new Congregation of the Clerics Regular Minor thus established was one of considerable severity. The Clerics bound themselves to various practices of daily penance. It was decided that each day one brother should fast on bread and water, another would take the discipline, and a third would wear the hair shirt. Later (under the direction of St. Francis) it was further decreed that everyone should spend an hour a day in prayer before the Blessed Sacrament. Superior General, 1593-1601 The Order's principal founder, Giovanni Adorno, died in early 1593, and despite his refusal, Francis Caracciolo was chosen general on March 9, 1593, in the first house of the congregation in Naples, called St. Mary Major or Pietrasanta, given to the congregation by Sixtus V. Even in his capacity as superior of the Order, he insisted on sharing simple tasks: sweeping rooms, making beds, washing dishes. As a priest Francis spent many hours in the confessional. Here he was enriched with the gifts of prophecy and the reading of hearts.The Roman Breviary for June 4, ed. 1963 He also begged in the streets for the poor and gave away most of his possessions to the needy.Foley O.F.M., Leonard, \\"Saint of the Day\\" (rev. Pat McCloskey O.F.M.) But it was his devotion to the Blessed Sacrament for which St. Francis Caracciolo is most noted and remembered. Such was his love for the Real Presence of Christ in the Holy Eucharist, that he would spend almost the entire night in adoration.The Roman Breviary, ed. 1963 The little sleep he allowed himself was often spent on one of the altar steps.Butler's Lives of the Saints, revised edition by Herbert Thurston, S.J. and Donald Attwater, published 1956 He made three journeys to Spain to establish foundations under the protection of kings Philip II and Philip III. He opened the house of the Holy Ghost at Madrid on January 20, 1599, that of Our Lady of the Annunciation at Valladolid on September 9, 1601, and that of St. Joseph at Alcal√° sometime in 1601, for teaching science. In Rome he obtained possession of St. Leonard's Church, which he afterwards exchanged for that of Sant'Agnese in Agone, September 18, 1598, and later he secured for the institute the church of San Lorenzo in Lucina (June 11, 1606) which was made over to him by a papal bull of Pope Paul V, (which was, however, annulled by the bull \\"Susceptum\\" of Pope Pius X, November 9, 1906). St Francis Caracciolo was the author of \\"Le sette stazioni sopra la Passione di N.S. Ges√π Christo\\" (The Seven Stations of the Passion of Our Lord, Rome, 1710). He loved the poor. Like Saint Thomas Aquinas, a relative on his mother's side, his purity was angelic, according to the Catholic Encyclopedia. Pope Paul V desired to confer an important bishopric on him, but he steadfastly refused it. Latter years, 1601‚Äì1608 Remaining general superior for seven years, Francis at last obtained permission from Pope Clement VIII to resign. The position had been a severe strain upon him, not only because of his delicate health, but also because in establishing and extending the order, he found himself and his brethren faced with opposition, misrepresentation, and sometimes by malicious calumnies. Francis was then named prior of Santa Maria Maggiore and novice- master. He carried on his apostolic work in the confessional and in the pulpit, discoursing so constantly and movingly on the divine goodness to man that he was called \\"The Preacher of the Love of God\\". We are also told that with the sign of the cross he restored health to many sick persons. In presence of his divine Lord, the face of St. Francis usually emitted brilliant rays of light; and he often bathed the ground with his tears when he prayed, according to his custom, prostrate on his face before the tabernacle, and constantly repeating from psalm 68,Psalm 69 in the modern, generally accepted numbering. as one devoured by internal fire,\\"Zelus domus tuae comedit me\\", \\"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up.\\" Invited by the Oratorians at Agnone, in the Molise region, to convert their house into a college for his congregation, St. Francis set out to help with the new foundation. On his way he visited Loreto, where he was granted the favor of spending the night in prayer in the chapel of the Holy House, the Basilica della Santa Casa. As he was invoking Our Lady's help on behalf of his brethren, Giovanni Adorno appeared to him in a dream or a vision, and announced his approaching death. He arrived at Agnone apparently in good health, but he himself was under no illusion. On the first day of June, 1608, he was seized with a fever which rapidly increased, and he dictated a fervent letter urging the members of the society to remain faithful to the rule. On the Vigil of Corpus Christi, Wednesday, June 4, 1608, he seemed absorbed in meditation until an hour before sunset when he suddenly cried out, \\"Let us go, Let us go to heaven!\\" Scarcely had these words been uttered when his wish was realized and he passed to his reward. He was forty-four years of age. Veneration When his body was opened after death, St. Francis' heart was found as it were burnt up, and these words imprinted around it: \\"Zelus domus Tu√¶ comedit me\\"‚Äî\\"The zeal of Thy house hath eaten me up.\\" St. Francis Caracciolo was beatified by Pope Clement XIV on June 4, 1769, and canonized by Pope Pius VII on May 24, 1807.Capetola C.R.M., Fr. Nicholas, \\"History\\", Adorno Fathers His liturgical feast day is June 4. In 1838 he was chosen as a patron saint of Naples, where his body lies. At first he was buried in Basilica of St. Mary Major, but his remains were afterwards translated to the church of Santa Maria di Monteverginella, which was given in exchange to the Clerics Regular Minor (1823) after their suppression at the time of the French Revolution. St Francis is also the patron of Italian cooks.

Central Alentejo region. It is located above sea level, northeast of √âvora and southeast of Estremoz. The population in 2011 was 5,843,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 542.68 km¬≤. History The historical castle walls and the classical parochial church With the completion of the castle in 1298, by Louren√ßo Afonso (9th Master of the Order of Aviz), the noble fulfilled his obligation to King Denis of Portugal to expand the territory that would form Alandroal. By 1359, the church of Alandroal was incorporated under the commander of the Order of Avis, but it was only a century later (1486) that John II would issue a foral (charter) for the town.CIMAC (2012), p.1 Alandroal was elevated to town at this time, while only including the parish of Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o. A second foral was conceded in 1514 by his successor, Manuel I of Portugal. Alandroal's historic importance include the medieval structures during the early period of Christian conquest, including the Castle of Alandroal (whose main gate was flanked by two towers); the Castle of Terena, consisting of wall-enclosed courtyard, keep and towers; the fortress of Juromenha, whose balusters were constructed later during the Portuguese Restoration War, but whose proximity to the Guadiana frontier provided a natural buttress to Castilian influence in the region. The lands at the time, flowered with Nerium oleander shrubs and trees, whose wood was used by local artisans. Its Portuguese toponomy oleandro gave rise to the name aloendros or alandros, eventually alandroal. The sanctuary of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o da Boa Nova, apart from its religious importance, is of national importance.CIMAC (2012), p.2 In 1340, the Moors had invaded from Andaluzia, resulting in an alliance between Alfonso XI of Castile and his father-in-law, Afonso IV of Portugal, that culminated in the Battle of R√≠o Salado. In honor of their assistance during the Marinid invasion, Maria of Portugal, Queen of Castile ordered the construction of the Gothic church to commemorate their victory. In the 16th century the old Gothic church was substituted but the current parochial church in Alandroal. At the same time, the hermitage of Nossa Senhora das Neves, in the older lands of Mata, then known as Nossa Senhora das Hervas, received annual festivals on 5 August. Similarly, the brotherhood of the Miserc√≥rdia was probably established this century, constructing the primitive temple for those religious services. On 14 January 1659, a gunpowder warehouse exploded, causing the deaths of various residents, but primarily university students from √âvora (under the authority of Father Francisco Soares), who were dispatched to Alandroal while the main Portuguese army fought in the Battle of the Lines of Elvas. The effects of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake resulted in destruction of various buildings. By the second half of the 18th century, a decision of the Council of State to King Joseph I permitted the construction of a new municipal building for Alandroal, for which were acquired furniture from local and awnings for the market. During the 19th Century territories of the older municipalities of Terena and Juromenha where annexed to Alandroal. The community of Villarreal, situated in the municipality of Oliven√ßa was once a part of the antique administration of Juromenha. Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The municipality is delimited in the north by Vila Vi√ßosa, east by the Guadiana River and Spanish border, south by Mour√£o and Reguengos de Monsaraz, and west by the municipality of Redondo. Alandroal is one of three towns defined within the municipality of the same name, and includes the vilas of Terena and Juromenha. The morphology of Alandroal is marked by a gently rolling relief with a minimum of altitude, with exceptions to this including Patinhas, and Castelo mountain . The Alqueva Dam, along the Guadiana River, is located in this territory, with major confluences including the Ribeira de Alcalate and Ribeira do Alandroal just the principal water resources. The climate of Alandroal is a markedly Mediterranean temperament, characterized by a dry climate that is accentuated in the summer. Precipitation in the region hovers between between October and March, and , during the dry season, which is irregular. The municipality covers approximately and has 6585 inhabitants (based on the 2001 census). =Parishes= The municipality is subdivided into four civil parishes: * Alandroal (Nossa Senhora da Concei√ß√£o), S√£o Br√°s dos Matos (Mina do Bugalho) e Juromenha (Nossa Senhora do Loreto) * Capelins (Santo Ant√≥nio) * Santiago Maior * Terena (S√£o Pedro) The city of Alandroal is one of three towns in the municipality, along with Terena and Juromenha. Economy The municipality's economic activities are connected to the primary and secondary sectors primarily. Agriculture continues to be important, with the cultivation of cereals, foraging and industrial plants, such as olive orchards dominating the rural landscape. The raising of livestock, namely poultry, swine and cattle, also draws on local resources, while 36.3% (or 1711 hectares) of the territory is covered in forests, allowing a nascent saw-milling and carpentry industry. Architecture =Prehistoric= * Castro of Castelo Velho (), a fortified settlement situated over the Rio Lucefecit associated with metallurgical activities during the Chalolithic era, that includes several structures and short wall. The site had human settlement since the Bronze Age until the Moorish occupation, but little information on events leading to its abandon. * Fortified settlement/sanctuary of Endov√©lico () =Civic= The baroque-style fountain of Pra√ßa * Farmers Guild of Alandroal () * Fountain of Pra√ßa () * Great Mill of S√£o Br√°s dos Matos () * Mill of Azenhas d'el Rei () * Municipal Hall of Alandroal () * Municipal Hall of Terena () * Old Bridge of Terena (over the Ribeira de Lucef√©cit) () * Pillory of Alandroal () * Pillory of Juromenha () * Pillory of Terena () * Spring of the Miseric√≥rdia () =Military= The fortified walls of the castle of Terena * Castle of Alandroal (), is a castle constructed during the reign of King D.

A total of 250 cars were built, arranged as single units. Two versions were manufactured: Westinghouse (WH)-powered cars and General Electric (GE)-powered cars. The first R21s entered service on November 7, 1956. The R21s were replaced by the R62As in the 1980s, and the final train of R21s ran on December 30, 1987. Four R21 cars were preserved, while the rest were scrapped. Description The R21s were numbered 7050-7299\\\\. They were similar to the R17s, except that they featured windows of a slightly different design. The cab doors were mounted the same way as the newer R62 and R62A subway cars; however, this was not repeated on the next order for R22 subway cars, which reverted to the normally mounted cab doors. There were two versions of the R21: Westinghouse Electric-powered cars (7050-7174) and General Electric-powered cars (7175-7299). History The first set of R21s was placed in service on the train on November 7, 1956, replacing most of the IRT \\"high voltage\\" type cars. They ran in service for most of their service lives on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, but some cars were sent to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line in later years. =Retirement= Car 0R714 on display at the New York Transit Museum Car 7203, rebuilt for use in the film Money Train and numbered 51050 The R62A fleet started replacing the R21s in the 1980s, and their final day in revenue service was on December 30, 1987. The majority of the fleet was scrapped, but some R21s have been set aside for preservation over the years, including: * 7194 - converted to R95 revenue collection car 0R714. The car was retired in 2006 and is now preserved by the New York Transit Museum. This car is currently the only operating R21 on MTA property. * 7203 - rebuilt as the \\"money train\\" in the 1995 American crime thriller film Money Train by Columbia Pictures, and given the car number designation 51050. After production, this car was donated to the New York Transit Museum. It is currently in storage at the Coney Island Complex. As of 2016, two other R21s survive as work cars, including: * 7121 - converted to R71 hose reach car P7121 and overhauled under the R159 program. * 7287 - converted to R71 de-icer car RD345 and overhauled under the R159 program. This car is currently located at the Westchester Yard. Car 7267 (renumbered G7267) is currently at Concourse Yard coupled up to R17 6895 (renumbered 36895) and is classified as a garbage motor. The mechanical condition of 7267 is unknown, and both cars have not been moved since 2002. In 2009, the car was stripped of parts, such as sash windows and rollsigns. Both cars are now awaiting scrapping. Cars 7055, 7210, 7211, 7243, 7278, 7289, and 7296 were converted to R123 continuous welded rail holder cars for set CCR and overhauled under the R128 program. They have since been retired. Cars 7234, 7241, 7269, 7276, and 7287 were converted to R71 rider cars after retirement, but were replaced with R161s (R33s converted to rider cars) in the mid-2000s and eventually reefed.

It is an example of a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution. The Sandmeyer reaction provides a method through which one can perform unique transformations on benzene, such as halogenation, cyanation, trifluoromethylation, and hydroxylation. :300x300px The reaction was discovered in 1884 by Swiss chemist Traugott Sandmeyer, when he attempted to synthesize phenylacetylene from benzenediazonium chloride and cuprous acetylide. Instead, the main product he isolated was phenyl chloride. In modern times, the Sandmeyer reaction refers to any method for substitution of an aromatic amino group via preparation of its diazonium salt followed by its displacement with a nucleophile in the presence of catalytic copper(I) salts. (Due to the low cost of copper salts, a stoichiometric amount is often employed for better reactivity even when catalysis is possible.) The most commonly employed Sandmeyer reactions are the chlorination, bromination, cyanation, and hydroxylation reactions using CuCl, CuBr, CuCN, and Cu2O, respectively. More recently, trifluoromethylation of diazonium salts has been developed and is referred to as a 'Sandmeyer-type' reaction. Diazonium salts also react with boronates, iodide, thiols, water, hypophosphorous acid and others, and fluorination can be carried out using tetrafluoroborate anions (Balz‚ÄìSchiemann reaction). However, since these processes do not require a metal catalyst, they are not usually referred to as Sandmeyer reactions. In numerous variants that have been developed, other transition metal salts, including copper(II), iron(III) and cobalt(III) have also been employed. Due to its wide synthetic applicability, the Sandmeyer reaction, along with other transformations of diazonium compounds, is complementary to electrophilic aromatic substitution. Reaction conditions and mechanism The nitrous acid is typically prepared in situ from sodium nitrite and acid. Following two protonation steps, one equivalent of water is lost to form the nitrosonium ion. The nitrosonium ion then acts as an electrophile in a reaction with an aromatic (or heterocyclic) amine, such as aniline, to form a diazonium salt, proceeding through a nitrosamine intermediate. Typical reaction conditions are as follows: Chlorination: ArN2+Cl‚Äì, CuCl, HCl (36% aq.), 50 ‚Äì 100 ¬∞C; bromination: ArN2+HSO4‚Äì, CuBr, HBr (48% aq.), 50 ‚Äì 100 ¬∞C; cyanation: ArN2+Cl‚Äì, CuCN, KCN, H2O, benzene, 0 ¬∞C; hydroxylation: Cu2O, Cu(NO3)2, H2O, 25 ¬∞C. The Sandmeyer reaction is an example of a radical-nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SRNAr). The radical mechanism of the Sandmeyer reaction is supported by the detection of biaryl byproducts. The substitution of the aromatic diazo group with a halogen or pseudohalogen is initiated by a one- electron transfer mechanism catalyzed by copper(I) to form an aryl radical with loss of nitrogen gas. The substituted arene is possibly formed by direct transfer of Cl, Br, CN, or OH from a copper(II) species to the aryl radical to produce the substituted arene and regenerate the copper(I) catalyst. In an alternative proposal, a transient copper(III) intermediate, formed from coupling of the aryl radical with the copper(II) species, undergoes rapid reductive elimination to afford the product and regenerate copper(I). However, evidence for such an organocopper intermediate is weak and mostly circumstantial, and the exact pathway may depend on the substrate and reaction conditions. These possibilities are shown below. =Formation of the nitrosonium ion= 800px =Formation of the benzenediazonium ion= :500x500px =Single electron transfer= alt= Synthetic applications Variations on the Sandmeyer reaction have been developed to fit multiple synthetic applications. These reactions typically proceed through the formation of an aryl diazonium salt followed by a reaction with a copper(I) salt to yield a substituted arene according to the scheme below. 300x300px Some examples of the synthetic applications of the Sandmeyer reaction are provided below. =Halogenation= One of the most important uses of the Sandmeyer reaction is the formation of aryl halides. The solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl iodides is diiodomethane, while for the synthesis of aryl bromides, bromoform is used. For the synthesis of aryl chlorides, chloroform is the solvent of choice. The synthesis of (+)-curcuphenol, a bioactive compound that displays antifungal and anticancer activity, employs the Sandmeyer reaction to substitute an amine group by a bromo group. 500x500px One bromination protocol employs a Cu(I)/Cu(II) mixture with additional amounts of the bidentate ligand phenanthroline and phase-transfer catalyst dibenzo-18-crown-6 to convert an aryl diazonium tetrafluoroborate salt to an aryl bromide. :300x300px The Balz‚ÄìSchiemann reaction uses tetrafluoroborate and delivers the halide-substituted product, fluorobenzene, which is not obtained by the use of copper fluorides. This reaction displays motifs characteristic of the Sandmeyer reaction. =Cyanation= Another use of the Sandmeyer reaction is for cyanation which allows for the formation of benzonitriles, an important class of organic compounds. A key intermediate in the synthesis of the anti-psychotic drug, Fluanxol, is synthesized by a cyanation through the Sandmeyer reaction. 400x400px The Sandmeyer reaction has also been employed in the synthesis of neoamphimedine, a compound that is suggested to target topoisomerase II as an anti-cancer drug. 500x500px =Trifluoromethylation= It has been demonstrated that Sandmeyer-type reactions can be used to generate aryl compounds functionalized by trifluoromethyl substituent groups. This process of trifluoromethylation provides unique chemical properties with a wide variety of practical applications. Particularly, pharmaceuticals with CF3 groups have enhanced metabolic stability, lipophilicity, and bioavailability. Sandmeyer-type trifluoromethylation reactions feature mild reaction conditions and greater functional group tolerance relative to earlier methods of trifluoromethylation. An example of a Sandmeyer-type trifluoromethylation reaction is presented below. 500x500px =Hydroxylation= The Sandmeyer reaction can also be used to convert aryl amines to phenols proceeding through the formation of an aryl diazonium salt as shown below. In the presence of copper catalyst, this reaction takes place readily at room temperature. The procedure reported by Cohen and coworkers calls for cuprous oxide together with an excess of cupric nitrate in neutral water. This is in contrast to the classical procedure (known by the German name Verkochung, Verkochung), which calls for boiling the diazonium salt in aqueous acid, a process that is believed to involve the aryl cation instead of radical and is known to generate other nucleophilic addition side products in addition to the desired hydroxylation product. 500x500px =Triazene= Treatment with a second equivalent of aniline would give a triazene. Compare for example, Diminazene (Berenil), and Isometamidium chloride.

The 40th overall episode and the final part of The Meteor Shower Trilogy, the episode describes what happens to Kyle and Kenny as they attend a Jewish Scouting camp on the night of the meteor shower. The episode satirizes Jewish stereotypes and originally aired on July 28, 1999. Plot Sheila and Gerald Broflovski are getting ready to go to Mr. Mackey's meteor shower party. Kyle and his brother Ike are preparing to go to Jewbilee camp: a Boy-Scout-esque camp for Jewish boys with separate programs called \\"Jew Scouts\\" and \\"Squirts\\". When Kenny arrives at Kyle's house to hang out, Kyle invites him to go with him to Jewbilee, so it would not \\"suck so hard.\\" Kyle's parents explain to Kenny that because he is not Jewish, he might not be accepted at Jewbilee. Kyle tells his parents that \\"Kenny will believe whatever you tell him to\\" and asks his parents if they can take Kenny with them. They then grant Kenny permission and explain to him the basic tenets of Judaism on the car ride to Jewbilee. Once they arrive, Sheila tells the boys to have fun and advises Kenny to \\"act Jewish\\". She and Gerald then leave for Mr. Mackey's party. Kenny then becomes initiated, despite not being Jewish. Meanwhile, Ike is assigned to go with the other tots to the Squirts camp, which is a Cub- Scout-esque camp. After the initiation ceremonies, the boys make soap sculptures to honor their god Moses who demands arts-and-crafts-like things, including macaroni pictures that the Squirts were supposed to make, and popcorn necklaces. Kenny is then identified as not being Jewish and is banished from the camp. As he tries to reach home, the ATF and a couple of police cars are seen driving by, away from Mr. Mackey's house, where they thought a cult was residing. He then returns to the camp where Garth, the elder of the \\"Anti-Semitic Jews\\" sect, has captured Moses in a conch shell and has locked everyone else in a cabin at gunpoint while he tries to summon Haman to be the new leader. Meanwhile, the Squirts master, Shlomo, wants to capture the bear the Broflovskis saw earlier in the episode, but only so he can get his chutzpah badge and therefore become a master Scouts rather than Squirts. The bear kidnaps the Squirts one by one, and Shlomo continues to devise plans that ultimately fail. Soon, the bear captures all the Squirts and Shlomo has to go to the Warden, but is shot in the shoulder by Garth, when he tries to release Moses from the conch shell in which he is trapped. Kenny gets captured by the bear only to find that the bear was not killing the Squirts but was finding friends for her cub, who was celebrating his birthday. Kenny gets the Squirts and they make their way back to Shlomo and they head back to camp to find everyone else in trouble. The Squirts stand on top of one another to reach the keys and unlock everyone from the cabin, as Kenny saves the day by smashing his head against the conch shell to free Moses, and Haman is defeated. Moses then kills Garth, and as everyone discovers Kenny died smashing open the conch shell, Moses declares the Jews shall meet every year on that day to celebrate Kenny by making soap sculptures, macaroni pictures and paper plate bean shakers decorated with glue and glitter. Production The writing process of \\"Jewbilee\\" helped South Park co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone realize the approach to writing most suited for the show. The episode had to be aired about a month after the film South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was released, at which time Parker and Stone could take a break from their intensive work. They were pleased with their work on both the show and the film and decided not to care about how good the episode was, and \\"just make it dumb and weird.\\" Eventually, they came to believe that \\"Jewbilee\\" was then one of the best episodes of the show, which helped them realize that they should not try to think of the plots for too long, but \\"just be stupid and have fun.\\" Cultural and religious references The Moses character is Parker's favorite aspect of the episode. His appearance is patterned after the Master Control Program from the film Tron. Reception John Sinnott of DVD Talk stated that the episode is one of the third season's \\"strange shows that worked very well.\\" In an article about Isaac Hayes' departure controversy, The Seattle Times referred to \\"Jewbilee\\" as one of the show's most outrageous episodes.

The Pride of the Southland in the Power T. The Pride of the Southland Band is the official name of the University of Tennessee's marching band. History The Pride of the Southland Marching Band has been performing at halftime for more than 110 years, but has existed since 1869 when it was founded as part of the Military Department, forerunner to the school's ROTC program. It is one of the oldest collegiate band programs in the country. Its instrumentation in 1883 was entirely made up of cornets. The band continued to grow to between thirteen and seventeen members, and in 1892, it was reorganized under Ernest H. Garratt. The band wore West Point-style uniforms like the rest of the cadets in the Military Department and had a more varied repertoire of instruments, including a clarinet. At the turn of the twentieth century, William A. Knabe was appointed as band director. He was the first ‚Äúfull-time‚Äù band director; Garratt had also served as an organist, choirmaster, musical director, and director of the Glee Club. UT won the first (documented) game at which the band performed in 1902. By 1917, the band had changed to World War I style uniforms and doubled in size. The band grew along with the military units on campus. By 1935, the band boasted eighty-five members, but remained all male due to the band‚Äôs continued association with the Military Department. In 1937, an all-female contingent called the \\"Volettes\\" began performing with the band. Its membership ranged from fifty to ninety. The 1940s brought women into the band. Two of the first women to play with the band were Martha Carroll, who played the lyre, and Marjorie Abbott, a marimba player. By 1946, women outnumbered the male members of the band, due to World War II and the death of male students. By 1949, the band was once again all male, but retained female majorettes. Major Walter Ryba was properties master for the Army and Air Force ROTC at Knoxville and also for the Army ROTC at the UT-Martin campus. The name \\"Pride of the Southland\\" was a group decision of the band members themselves, on the morning of October 15, 1949, as they stood around on the sidelines at Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama awaiting a chance to practice for the afternoon game. They were waiting for Alabama's Million Dollar Band, under the direction of \\"Colonel\\" Butler, to finish its practice. That afternoon as the band came out on the field and paused for introduction, for the first time \\"Presenting The University of Tennessee's Pride of the Southland Band under the direction of 'Major' Walter M. Ryba\\" was heard over the loudspeakers by the 44,000 fans present and listeners on the radio. It was generally felt that Ryba did not know ahead of time that he was receiving a \\"commission\\". In 1961, Tennessee native W J Julian (1922-2015) was hired as an associate professor and director of the UT bands. Under Julian's leadership the band grew in size, prestige, and reputation. The band was then removed from the ROTC department and placed under the Music Education Department. Julian designed the band‚Äôs black, orange, white, and creme-colored uniforms, which paid homage to the band‚Äôs military past and are still in use to this day. Some of the many traditions established under Julian's direction are: the band's signature \\"Big Orange Sound\\"; its pregame formations; forming the T for the team to run through; Rocky Top; and Circle Drills, a geometric and kaleidoscopic drill concept from which many drills were derived through his and his immediate successors' tenures. Although Julian retired in 1993, the band still upholds the tradition of excellence he set. Besides representing the State of Tennessee in 13 presidential inaugurations, the band has appeared at the many bowl games the Vol football team has traveled to throughout the nation. Additionally, due to Julian's influence, the Pride is one of only two SEC bands with a strutting Big Ten-style drum major. In March 2007, The Pride traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to play at various concerts and in the St. Patrick's Day Parade. Director of Bands Gary Sousa was removed from his post October 14, 2013, and placed on administrative leave by the university after a public confrontation with the UT Athletic Department. Donald Ryder was then appointed interim Director of Bands, and Michael Stewart was appointed interim Associate Director. On January 29, 2015 it was announced that Ryder would permanently serve as Director of Bands and W J Julian Professor of Music, and Stewart would permanently serve as Associate Director of Bands. Traditions =Personnel and field presence= The UT Marching Band is an entirely mobile unit; its halftime complement usually includes around 200 wind instruments (necessitated by the optimal number of people to create the geometry of circle drills); a line of non-pitched and indefinite pitched percussion (pitched percussion instruments like bells and xylophones are never utilized, nor is sideline or \\"pit\\" percussion); 24 or 32 color guard; 10 majorettes; and one drum major. The UT band customarily enters the field live, playing music from the initial step-off from the sideline; it also exits the field live, most often to the music of the \\"Tennessee Waltz March.\\" =Pregame= The Pride of the Southland opening the famous T. The Pride's pregame show was designed by Julian with musical arrangements by Warren Clark and Barry McDonald. This six minute and forty-five second show has remained largely unchanged since the 1960s. It begins with the drumline starting off a cadence as the band marches onto the field. Then, part of the \\"Tennessee Waltz March,\\" a march version of the \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" in common time, is played as the band forms a block formation. The band then plays the National Anthem in this formation. Then the full version of the \\"Tennessee Waltz March\\" followed by, starting in the 2007 season, a march version of Alabama's \\"Tennessee River\\", then the \\"Alma Mater March\\". As they march back playing the \\"Alma Mater March,\\" they spell out VOLS. Then the visiting team's fight song is played in the direction of the opposing team's band and student section. After this, the band forms the traditional interlocking \\"U\\" and \\"T\\" and marches this across the majority of the field accompanied by \\"Rocky Top\\". Then the \\"Power T\\" is formed while \\"Spirit of the Hill\\" is played. Once the \\"Power T\\" is formed, all the Vols fans are asked to join in the Volunteer Wave and the crowd spells out \\"V-O- L-S\\" and chant \\"Go Vols Go!\\" Then the Pride of the Southland's Drum Major runs through the middle of this formation. The band then marches across the field until it reaches the opposite end zone. At this point, \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\" is played and the band forms a large \\"USA\\" to the visiting sideline, then inverts the form to face the front sideline. The band then plays \\"Fight Vols Fight\\" as they form the giant T formation which then opens up as the football team runs through while \\"Down the Field\\" is played. The band then turns and marches off the field to \\"Fight Vols Fight\\" while keeping the T formation. Although the T formation is used almost exclusively at UT home games in Neyland Stadium, it has been done at other venues, most notably at the 1986 and 1991 Sugar Bowl. =Rocky Top= 5 min video of UT Pregame Julian introduced \\"Rocky Top\\" in a halftime show in 1972, after which it made its way to the stands. The song has become so closely identified with the Vols that many believe it to be the school's official fight song. Indeed, an early version of the SEC's Web site included a recording of \\"Rocky Top\\" as Tennessee's fight song. However, Tennessee's official fight song is \\"Down the Field.\\" Rocky Top was written by Felice and Boudleaux Bryant in 1967 and recorded by The Osborne Brothers that same year. The song celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017. =Spirit of the Hill= The oldest tradition of the Pride of the Southland comes at the end of every home halftime show where the Pride plays Spirit of the Hill and forms an interlocking UT with the year 1794 or, more recently, on one side of the field a U and on the other side a T, on the field from 2010 to 2015. The year 1794 returned in 2016. This is the longest lasting tradition of the band dating back more than one hundred years. =Alma Mater= After forming the interlocking UT at the end of every home halftime show, the Pride plays the Alma Mater. UT's Alma Mater was officially adopted in 1928 after a yearlong contest sponsored by the school's musical organizations. A Chattanoogan, Mary Fleming Meek, won the $50 prize with her song entitled \\"On a Hallowed Hill.\\" Although Mrs. Meek was not an alumna of UT, both her husband, John Lamar Meek, and her son were graduates, and her father was a former trustee of the university. Another tradition of the Pride is to interlock arms and sing the Alma Mater prior to marching to the stadium for every home football game. =Salute to the Hill= Pride's Salute to the Hill. At every home game, the Pride performs the \\"March to the Stadium\\", which includes a parade sequence and climaxes when the Band stops at the bottom of \\"The Hill\\" (the oldest section of campus which resides upon the tallest hill right next to Neyland Stadium) and performs the \\"Salute to The Hill\\", a homage to the history and legacy of the University. The parade begins an hour and forty minutes before kickoff. You can watch the Salute to \\"The Hill\\" on YouTube. =Presidential inaugurations= With the exception of 2013, Pride of the Southland has represented the state of Tennessee for all Presidential Inaugurations since 1953, the most of any non-military band. =150th Anniversary= The 2019 football season marked the 150th anniversary of the Pride of the Southland Band. Custom drum heads with the logo shown were placed in the bass drums for all 2019 shows, and a gala was held on Homecoming weekend at the Knoxville Convention Center for alumni and family, with special appearances by Lee Greenwood and the 2019 Pride of the Southland Marching Band. .

A Combo television unit, or a TV/VCR combo, sometimes known as a televideo, is a television with a VCR, DVD player, or sometimes both, built into a single unit. These converged devices have the advantages (compared to a separate TV and VCR) of saving space and increasing portability. Such units entered the market during the mid-to-late 1980s when VCRs had become ubiquitous household devices. By this time, the VHS format had become standard; thus the vast majority of TV/VCR combos are VHS-based. Most combo units have composite inputs on the front and/or back to connect a home video game console, a second VCR, a DVD player, or a camcorder. Some units may also include a headphone jack or S-Video inputs. Though nearly all TV/VCR combination sets have monaural (mono) sound though with stereo soundtrack compatibility, there are a large number of TV/VCR combos with a stereo TV tuner, but a mono VCR (some may even include a mono sound input alongside a composite video input. Some models from Panasonic also included an FM tuner. When DVDs were released, brands such as Toshiba introduced a TV/DVD/VCR combo. However, many of these units turned out to have unreliable DVD players and never had a large place in the TV market. Modern televisions tend to be mostly composed of solid state components, while VCRs require physical movement for both the inner workings of the VCR and the actual viewing of a VHS tape. VCRs also tend to require occasional service to upkeep the VCR, including things like cleaning the heads, capstan, and pinch rollers. For this reason, it is not uncommon for the included VCR to cease functioning or to become unreliable years before a similar fate befalls the television component due to lack of easy maintenance. As late as 2006, flat- panel TVs with integrated DVD players appeared on the market, and integrated TV/DVD sets started overtaking the TV/VCR market. This is due to both the low price and overwhelming availability of DVDs and more compact form factor, as opposed to the increasingly rare video cassettes and near-extinction of cathode ray tube displays in the consumer market. Types =TV/VCR combos= History Some of the earliest combo TVs with a built-in video playback device were ones that supported Cartrivision. Cartrivision-equipped TVs date back before even the introduction of VHS or stand-alone video playback devices in the consumer market (but with the exception of some open reel video playback devices that could be connected to TVs back in the 1960s), which the majority of combo TVs had in the late 1980s and 1990s. Special features During the era of their popularity, many of these units displayed product videos in stores or for other commercial displays. The main reason reason for this was unlike most low-end, standalone VCRs, many included an automatic rewind feature. After the tape came to an end, the tape would automatically rewind and then play from the beginning of the tape again. This made it useful for product demonstrations to be replayed over and over without an employee continually having to manually rewind the tape. =TV/Computer combos= :See also: Smart TV Some fully functional computer systems or game consoles have been built into some models of TVs over time. Hewlett-Packard currently has a version of their TouchSmart line of computers with a built-in TV tuner, and even has a built-in DVR; also making it a TV/DVR combo which is a relatively rare concept. As of late 2006, Samsung introduced an LED TV with a proprietary operating system with Internet access to websites like Facebook, YouTube, Hulu, Netflix, and other sites. Other TV/Computer combo equipment can simply just be flatscreen TVs with USB ports which allows USB flash drives and external hard drives to be connected to allow for audio and video playback, in which it can give a streamlined, fully solid-state profile. Almost every modern day TV sets have simplified CPUs and memory chips for basic functions such as channels and video settings, and video timing for LCD flat panels; however these examples are not sophisticated enough to qualify as significant examples. Other computer parts are used for real-time playback of DVDs on combo TVs with DVD player (and Blu-ray Disc for more high-end models) functionality; however these dedicated functions alone don't qualify as significant examples either. In the modern day, the distinction between a combo TV and an all-in-one PC have blurred with the modern smart TV concept. In 2010, Sony introduced a TV with a built-in Playstation 2. Past In the past, other attempts have been made to integrate computer functionality in CRT or display enclosures. However, prior to the concept of TVs with built-in computer motherboards, early portable computers had monitors of their own, but no TV tuner since it was a cost-prohibitive feature in the late 1970s/early 1980s. The Compucolor (followed by the Compucolor II of the 1970s was one of the first computer systems to be contained entirely within the casing of a video screen. Instead of being a functional computer system for hobbyist programming with a TV tuner, the tuner was removed from the casing of an RCA brand TV (GE for the Compucolor II) since such a feature during the 1970s would have been too costly for such an application. But such a device would be pulled off the market due to FCC concerns over a lack of radiation shielding from the CRT. As a notable example, but without a built-in TV tuner, The first model of the well-known Macintosh line of computers had a built-in monitor. In the mid-1980s, Sharp introduced the C1 NES TV which was capable of playing NES and Famicom games and the first one to also have a TV tuner. Years later, in the mid-1990s, Apple Computer introduced the Macintosh TV (not to be confused with the current-day Apple TV set-top box) which was capable of capturing still images of TV broadcasts to the hard drive since hard drives at the time were not big enough for practical DVR use even though experimental use of hard drives for video capture only captured less than a minute of video back in the 1960s. Handheld game consoles such as the Game Gear had a full-color display housed with a CPU, but wasn't a true TV-computer combo unit since a modular TV tuner peripheral was required. Recent models like Sony's TV/computer combo system in its VAIO line of computers was discontinued due to being overpriced and underpowered for today's respective PC and TV markets. TVs might have a store built in which allows users to download internet browser and any apps like Netflix.

Born in 850 CE in Shamistiyan, in the province of Balkh, Khorasan (in modern-day Afghanistan), he was a disciple of al-Kindi. He was also the founder the \\"Balkhƒ´ school\\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. Works Of the many books ascribed to him in the al-Fihrist by Ibn al-Nadim, one can note the excellency of mathematics; on certitude in astrology. His Figures of the Climates (Suwar al-aqalim) consisted chiefly of geographical maps. He also wrote the medical and psychological work, Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus (Sustenance for Body and Soul). A modern scholar describes the bulk of his works as \\"more than sixty books and manuscripts, meticulously researching disciplines as varied in scope as geography, medicine, theology, politics, philosophy, poetry, literature, Arabic grammar, astrology, astronomy, mathematics, biography, ethics, sociology as well as others.\\"Malik Badri, Abu Zayd al-Balkhi‚Äôs Sustenance of the Soul: The Cognitive Behavior Therapy of a Ninth Century Physician, International Institute of Islamic Thought (IIIT) (2013), p. 1 Figures of the Regions His Figures of the Regions (Suwar al-aqalim) consisted chiefly of geographical maps. It led to him founding the \\"Balkhƒ´ school\\" of terrestrial mapping in Baghdad. The geographers of this school also wrote extensively of the peoples, products, and customs of areas in the Muslim world, with little interest in the non-Muslim realms.E. Edson and Emilie Savage-Smith, Medieval Views of the Cosmos, pp. 61-3, Bodleian Library, University of Oxford Sustenance for Body and Soul =Mental health and mental illness= In Islamic psychology, the concepts of mental health and \\"mental hygiene\\" were introduced by Abu Zayd al-Balkhi, who often related it to spiritual health. In his Masalih al-Abdan wa al-Anfus (Sustenance for Body and Soul), he was the first to successfully discuss diseases related to both the body and the soul. He used the term al-Tibb al-Ruhani to describe spiritual and psychological health, and the term Tibb al-Qalb to describe mental medicine. He criticized many medical doctors in his time for placing too much emphasis on physical illnesses and neglecting the psychological or mental illnesses of patients, and argued that \\"since man‚Äôs construction is from both his soul and his body, therefore, human existence cannot be healthy without the ishtibak [interweaving or entangling] of soul and body.\\" He further argued that \\"if the body gets sick, the nafs [psyche] loses much of its cognitive and comprehensive ability and fails to enjoy the desirous aspects of life\\" and that \\"if the nafs gets sick, the body may also find no joy in life and may eventually develop a physical illness.\\" Al-Balkhi traced back his ideas on mental health to verses of the Qur'an and hadiths attributed to Muhammad, such as:Nurdeen Deuraseh and Mansor Abu Talib (2005), \\"Mental health in Islamic medical tradition\\", The International Medical Journal 4 (2), p. 76-79. =Cognitive and medical psychology and cognitive therapy= Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was the first to differentiate between neurosis and psychosis, and the first to classify neurotic disorders and pioneer cognitive therapy in order to treat each of these classified disorders. He classified neurosis into four emotional disorders: fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsession. He further classified three types of depression: normal depression or sadness (huzn), endogenous depression originating from within the body, and reactive clinical depression originating from outside the body. He also wrote that a healthy individual should always keep healthy thoughts and feelings in his mind in the case of unexpected emotional outbursts in the same way drugs and First Aid medicine are kept nearby for unexpected physical emergencies. He stated that a balance between the mind and body is required for good health and that an imbalance between the two can cause sickness. Al-Balkhi also introduced the concept of reciprocal inhibition (al-ilaj bi al-did), which was re-introduced over a thousand years later by Joseph Wolpe in 1969.Amber Haque (2004), \\"Psychology from Islamic Perspective: Contributions of Early Muslim Scholars and Challenges to Contemporary Muslim Psychologists\\", Journal of Religion and Health 43 (4): 357-377 [362] =Psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine= The Muslim physician Abu Zayd al-Balkhi was a pioneer of psychotherapy, psychophysiology and psychosomatic medicine. He recognized that the body and the soul can be healthy or sick, or \\"balanced or imbalanced\\", and that mental illness can have both psychological and/or physiological causes. He wrote that imbalance of the body can result in fever, headaches and other physical illnesses, while imbalance of the soul can result in anger, anxiety, sadness and other mental symptoms. He recognized two types of depression: one caused by known reasons such as loss or failure, which can be treated psychologically through both external methods (such as persuasive talking, preaching and advising) and internal methods (such as the \\"development of inner thoughts and cognitions which help the person get rid of his depressive condition\\"); and the other caused by unknown reasons such as a \\"sudden affliction of sorrow and distress, which persists all the time, preventing the afflicted person from any physical activity or from showing any happiness or enjoying any of the pleasures\\" which may be caused by physiological reasons (such as impurity of the blood) and can be treated through physical medicine. He also wrote comparisons between physical disorders with mental disorders, and showed how psychosomatic disorders can be caused by certain interactions between them.

Their remains have been found in the Dinosaur Park Formation, dating from 76.5 to 75.5 million years ago.  Discovery and naming  Life restoration The first Centrosaurus remains were discovered and named by paleontologist Lawrence Lambe in strata along the Red Deer River in Alberta, Canada. The name Centrosaurus means \\"pointed lizard\\" (from Greek kentron, Œ∫Œ≠ŒΩœÑœÅŒøŒΩ, \\"point or prickle\\" and sauros, œÉŒ±·ø¶œÅŒøœÇ, \\"lizard\\"), and refers to the series of small hornlets placed along the margin of their frills, not to the nasal horns (which were unknown when the dinosaur was named). The genus is not to be confused with the stegosaur Kentrosaurus, the name of which is derived from the same Greek word. Later, vast bonebeds of Centrosaurus were found in Dinosaur Provincial Park, also in Alberta. Some of these beds extend for hundreds of meters and contain thousands of individuals of all ages and all levels of completion. Scientists have speculated that the high density and number of individuals would be explained if they had perished while trying to cross a flooded river. A discovery of thousands of Centrosaurus fossils near the town of Hilda, Alberta, is believed to be the largest bed of dinosaur bones ever discovered. The area is now known as the Hilda mega- bonebed.Scientists find dino deathbed, signs of carnage. Edmonton Sun. http://www.edmontonsun.com/news/canada/2010/06/18/14439211.html retrieved 18 06 2010 Because of the variation between species and even individual specimens of centrosaurines, there has been much debate over which genera and species are valid, particularly whether Centrosaurus and/or Monoclonius are valid genera, undiagnosable, or possibly members of the opposite sex. In 1996, Peter Dodson found enough variation between Centrosaurus, Styracosaurus, and Monoclonius to warrant separate genera, and that Styracosaurus resembled Centrosaurus more closely than either resembled Monoclonius. The \\"Monoclonius nasicornus\\" skeleton Dodson believed one species of Monoclonius, M. nasicornus, may actually have been a female Styracosaurus.Dodson, P. (1996). The Horned Dinosaurs: A Natural History. Princeton University Press: Princeton, New Jersey, pp. 197‚Äì199. . His assessments have been partially followed, with other researchers not accepting Monoclonius nasicornus as a female Styracosaurus, or Monoclonius as a valid genus. While sexual dimorphism has been proposed for a more basal ceratopsian, Protoceratops, there is no firm evidence for sexual dimorphism in any ceratopsid.Forster, C. A. (1990). The cranial morphology and systematics of Triceratops, with a preliminary analysis of ceratopsian phylogeny. Ph.D. Dissertation. University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. 227 pp. Others have synonymized C. nasicornus with C. apertus,M.J. Ryan and D.C. Evans, 2005, \\"Ornithischian dinosaurs\\". In: P.J. Currie and E.B. Koppelhus (eds.), Dinosaur Provincial Park: A Spectacular Ancient Ecosystem Revealed. Indiana University Press, Bloomington pp 312-348 or considered it a separate Centrosaurus species: Centrosaurus nasicornus. It has also been suggested as the direct ancestor of Styracosaurus albertensis.Paul, G.S., 2010, The Princeton Field Guide to Dinosaurs, Princeton University Press p. 261 A 2014 study of changes during growth in Centrosaurus concluded that C. nasicornus is a junior synonym of C. apertus, representing a middle growth stage. The species C. brinkmani, which was described in 2005, was moved to the new genus Coronosaurus in 2012.  Description  Size comparison with human The massive bodies of Centrosaurus were borne by stocky limbs, although at up to they were not particularly large dinosaurs. Like other centrosaurines, Centrosaurus bore single large horns over their noses. These horns curved forwards or backwards depending on the specimen. Skull ornamentation was reduced as animals aged. The frill was relatively short compared to the total skull length, and could grow to over half a meter (68.8 cm) long in the oldest and largest adults. Centrosaurus is distinguished by having two large hornlets which hook forwards over the frill. A pair of small upwards directed horns is also found over the eyes. The frills of Centrosaurus were moderately long, with fairly large fenestrae and small hornlets along the outer edges.  Classification  A large hook from the back of a Centrosaurus frill. These hooks are diagnostic of the genus. Complete skulls arranged in ontogenetic order The genus Centrosaurus gives its name to the Centrosaurinae subfamily. Its closest relatives appear to be Styracosaurus and Monoclonius. It so closely resembles the latter of these that some paleontologists have considered them to represent the same animal. Other members of the Centrosaurinae clade include Pachyrhinosaurus, Avaceratops, Einiosaurus, Albertaceratops, and Achelousaurus. The cladogram presented below represents a phylogenetic analysis by Chiba et al. (2017):  Paleobiology  Cast of AMNH 5427, Museum of Victoria Like other ceratopsids, the jaws of Centrosaurus were adapted to shear through tough plant material. The discovery of gigantic bone beds of Centrosaurus in Canada suggest that they were gregarious animals and could have traveled in large herds.\\"Centrosaurus.\\" In: Dodson, Peter & Britt, Brooks & Carpenter, Kenneth & Forster, Catherine A. & Gillette, David D. & Norell, Mark A. & Olshevsky, George & Parrish, J. Michael & Weishampel, David B. The Age of Dinosaurs. Publications International, LTD. p. 135. . A bone bed composed of Centrosaurus and Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation in what is now Alberta. The mass deaths may have been caused by otherwise non-herding animals gathering around a waterhole during a drought. Centrosaurus is found lower in the formation than Styracosaurus, indicating that Centrosaurus was displaced by Styracosaurus as the environment changed over time. mega- bonebeds The large frills and nasal horns of the ceratopsians are among the most distinctive facial adornments of all dinosaurs. Their function has been the subject of debate since the first horned dinosaurs were discovered. Common theories concerning the function of ceratopsian frills and horns include defense from predators, combat within the species, and visual display. A 2009 study of Triceratops and Centrosaurus skull lesions found that bone injuries on the skulls were more likely caused by intraspecific combat (horn-to-horn combat) rather than predatory attacks. The frills of Centrosaurus were too thin to be used for defense against predators, although the thicker, solid frills of Triceratops might have evolved to protect their necks. The frills of Centrosaurus were most likely used \\"for species recognition and/or other forms of visual display\\". =Paleopathology= A specimen of Centrosaurus apertus recovered from Dinosaur Provincial Park in 1989 was discovered to have crippling osteosarcoma in its right fibula. Examination of the cancerous lesions in the bone suggest the cancer had reached an aggressive stage. The cancer would have resulted in a severe limp that would have made the ceratopsian more vulnerable to predation. However, the fact that it was part of a herd allowed the Centrosaurus to survive much longer than would be expected for an animal infected with such severe disease. The individual itself is believed to have died from drowning in the flash flood that created the Centrosaurus bone bed where it was found. The specimen remains one of the few dinosaur specimens found with severe cancer.  Paleobiogeography  Skin impression of AMNH 5427 Thomas M. Lehman has observed that Centrosaurus fossils haven't been found outside of southern Alberta even though they are among the most abundant Judithian dinosaurs in the region. Large herbivores like the ceratopsians living in North America during the Late Cretaceous had \\"remarkably small geographic ranges\\" despite their large body size and high mobility. This restricted distribution strongly contrasts with modern mammalian faunas whose large herbivores' ranges \\"typical[ly] ... span much of a continent.\\"Lehman, T.

Bagha Purana was a small village till the early 70s primarily consisting of three pattis namely Bagha Patti, Purana Patti and Mughlu Patti. This small village located on the intersection of Moga-Kotkapura road and Mudki-Nihal Singh Wala road got prominence after a Government Polytechnic was established, a few kilometers away. Thereafter it became a trade center of the villages around it and developed into a small town. The village got a status of town when a Nagar Panchayat (smallest form of urban local self-government unit) was formed in 1974 which was upgraded to a Municipal Council, a few years ago. In 2000, it got the status of a sub-division headquarters which facilitated the establishment of all tehsil-level offices of the Government. Earlier, the majority of the population thrived on agriculture, as such most of the other economic activity is driven by agriculture like agro based industry (rice-mills, cold stores etc.), commission agents etc. The tertiary activities include the transport and related businesses like finance etc. Many banks have opened their branches due to enhanced economic activity over the years, as well as the needs of the non-resident Indian community from this region, especially in Canada & Australia. The town also boasts of being the home-town of some of the great personalities. To name a few, Major Malkit SIngh Brar, who was awarded the Mahavir Chakra (posthumously) in 1948 was born in Alam Wala (a small and first village near Bagha Purana) and He got educated here. He laid down his life fighting for the country in Poonch sector during the Indo-Pak war in 1948 and was the first in erstwhile Punjab (comprising present Punjab, Haryana, H.P and Delhi) and second in the country to be honored with Mahavir Chakra (the highest decoration award of the country).

The Martin Dam powerhouse is used to generate hydroelectric power for the Alabama Power Company. Construction on Martin Dam began in 1923 and was completed in 1926, creating what was at that time the largest man-made body of water in the world. Originally known as Cherokee Bluffs for the geological formation upon which it was built, the dam was renamed in 1936 in honor of Thomas Martin, the then-president of Alabama Power Company.\\"Lake Martin\\" , Alabama Power Company Alabama Power and Russell Lands own the majority of the shoreline. Tourism One of the largest man made lakes in the United States, Lake Martin is a popular recreation area for swimming, boating, water skiing, camping, and golfing. The Dixie Sailing Club operates on Lake Martin. Many waterfront neighborhoods and luxury homes are located on Lake Martin. The cities of Alexander City, Dadeville, Jacksons Gap, and Eclectic are nearby. Lake Martin hosts many events throughout the year, including fishing tournaments, an Independence Day fireworks show, and the Alexander City Jazz Festival, an annual event every June in downtown Alexander City and at the Lake Martin Amphitheater. In 2009-11, the lake hosted AquaPalooza. Lake Martin includes many popular attractions, including eagles nests, sand beaches, restaurants, camping areas and popular islands. The lake has several landmarks, such as the Smith Mountain Fire Tower,http://toureastalabama.com/attraction/smith-mountain-fire-tower/ Kowaliga Bridge, and several marinas, but perhaps the most recognized landmark on the lake is Chimney Rock, a large rock formation that resembles a chimney. Though Chimney Rock is located several hundred yards away, the formation which most people call Chimney Rock is Acapulco Rock. The area was the Tallapoosa River gorge before Martin Dam was built, and the water is more than deep. The spot is visited by thousands of boaters yearly, who park in front of \\"The Rock\\" to watch people climb up and jump off into the water. In July 2006, a teenager died after his jump from the rock.https://www.alexcityoutlook.com/2006/07/10/what-lies-beneath/ Lake Martin has become a weekend getaway for many families from around the South. Many exclusive multimillion-dollar residences are located on the lake; among the best-known is that of Richard M.

Islands on Lake Martin Small islands are popular spots on Lake Martin: *Cemetery Island - A small county graveyard from before the construction of Martin Dam is located on what is now a tiny island in Lake Martin. About 30 by around, it is in the Bay Pine area. *Chimney Rock Island - Chimney Rock Island has long been a famous landmark on Lake Martin. Its name came from a tall rock resembling a chimney that protrudes from the top of the island. *Acapulco Rock Island - Acapulco Rock Island is adjacent to Chimney Rock Island at the Tallapoosa River Gorge. It is often mistaken for Chimney Rock. *Deer Island - A small island located less than half a mile northwest of Kowaliga Marina. At low water levels, it is connected to the mainland by a land bridge. Deer often cross to the island during the winter when the water levels are lowest and become trapped when the water level rises. Its shore has wide banks of fine grain sand and thus many residents dock boats on the islands. *Doctor's Island - So named because a group of doctors used the island as a base camp to fish. *Goat Island - Goat Island is north of Martin Dam. It has become the residence for a family of goats. *Real Island - Not an island or distinct community, residents named it for \\"Real Island Road,\\" which runs through it, and a nearby marina. *Sand Island - Sand Island is a small island located between Willow Point and Kowaliga Marina. Over the years erosion has taken its toll on the island, but rocks have recently been placed around the island to prevent it from being completed washed away. Boats frequently park on its sandy shallow beach. It is likely the smallest island on the lake. *Young's Island - The Young residence (of Young's ferry) was here and was destroyed by fire in the early 1990s. The foundation remains and there are historic markers for the graves of the family's children. *Weed Hill Island - Weed Hill is a small island almost directly across from the Pleasure Point Marina boat ramp. Although at one time it was much larger, erosion has reduced the landmass. *Wood's Island - Wood's Island is a larger island, connected to the mainland by a land bridge during low water times. It has several trails for hiking. It can be found at the end of Young's Ferry Rd on the West side of the lake. *Wilmarth's Island- only inhabited island on the lake. Lake Martin tornado On April 27, 2011, an EF4 tornado ripped across Lake Martin. Several valuable houses and businesses were completely destroyed along its path. Some vehicles were carried over 100 yards. The tornado resulted in seven deaths across the region. Its path through Elmore, Tallapoosa, and Chambers counties was long.

Creation of Boiler Room  Each \\"girl\\" was assigned a regional desk, divided by regions of the country, and was responsible for daily communication in and out of the Washington campaign headquarters to each state director in their region. At the end of the day, a decision book was compiled and sent to Kennedy and his campaign manager, Stephen Smith. Each decision book was composed by the boiler room team. The team of women also kept track of Kennedy's delegate count against Democratic primary contenders Eugene McCarthy and Hubert Humphrey. Just before the 1968 Democratic National Convention, the boiler room team was moved to a temporary office adjoining the convention floor where the same delegate officers met with the same state leaders. Following the assassination of United States Senator Robert F. Kennedy on June 5, 1968, the team was responsible for finishing the campaign coordination work assigned at the beginning. They eventually dispersed to work in other offices on Capitol Hill or elsewhere in Washington. The Boiler Room Girls were variously described as \\"frighteningly intelligent, politically astute, capable as all get-out\\"Cadden, Vivian (August 1974). \\"What Happened at Chappaquiddick\\". McCall's. Vol. 102. p. 80. ISSN 1060-1201. as well as \\"uniformly bright, efficient, fascinated by politics\\". Robert Kennedy speaking at a rally \\"Girls\\" of the Boiler Room = Mary Jo Kopechne = After graduating in the 1962 class of Caldwell College for Women, Mary Jo moved to Alabama where she taught at Montgomery Catholic School. She joined the staff of Senator George A. Smathers of Florida in 1963 as a secretary. One year later she became a speech writer for Joseph Dolan, one of Robert Kennedy's political advisors. After Robert Kennedy's assassination, she joined Matt Reese Associates. She became a member of Senator Edward Kennedy's office. After Chappaquiddick, reports of the incident captioned Mary as ‚ÄúCopachni‚Äù by the New Bedford Standard-Times, and ‚ÄúPalporki‚Äù by the FBI, and even ‚ÄúTED SAFE; BLONDE DIES‚Äù by another wire service. = Mary Ellen Lyons = Mary Ellen Lyons was a graduate of Regis College in Weston, Massachusetts. Her sister, Nance Lyons, worked on Robert Kennedy's campaign staff as well. She worked for State Senator Beryl Cohen of Massachusetts. = Nance Lyons = In January 1967, Nance began \\"working in case\\", assisting with constituents, federal agencies, etc. for Robert Kennedy's office. One of her most notable projects was the legislation for Massachusetts, and getting the appropriations for the National Seashore or for the Lexington Concord National Park. After Nixon was elected as the 37th president, she left the government. She received a call from the Senator's office about working for Senator Edward Kennedy. She responded by agreeing to come back under the condition that she receive a legislative assistant job, as she was already doing the work. Legislative assistants wrote the legislation on national issues, as well as the committee work and hearings. In the office, all male legislative assistants had secretaries, who aided them in their work. Nance had to write everything, type it, and mimeograph it by herself. During her time in the government she worked on the economic conversion bill and national transportation trust fund. = Esther N. Newberg = In 1968, Esther joined Robert Kennedy's Presidential campaign where she served as an aide. After, she was known to work at the Urban Institute in Washington.

Lowenstein, Nassau County Democrat. = Rosemary \\"Crickett\\" Keough = Rosemary Keough was an alumna from Manhattanville College and graduated from Boston University Law School. She was a former administrative assistant to Senator Robert F. Kennedy who also worked for the Children's Foundation in Washington. During the Chappaquiddick incident, Keough's purse was in the backseat of the sunken car. She married Paul Redmond, one of the attorneys that Kennedy hired to look after the Boiler Room Girls after the incident and up through the inquest.  1969 Reunion at Chappaquiddick  Bridge that Mary Jo Kopechne and Teddy Kennedy drove over in Chappaquiddick Island On July 18, 1969 the Boiler Room Girls attended a gathering at Chappaquiddick Island with Edward M. Kennedy. He was accompanied by three lawyers, Joseph F. Gargan, Paul Markham, and Charles Tretter, as well as John B. Crimsons, Mr. Kennedy's driver, and family friend, Raymond S. La Rosa. That night, Edward Kennedy and Mary Jo Kopechne went for a drive where they crashed over a bridge into Pocha Pond on Chappaquiddick Island.  Media Portrayals of Boiler Room  In 2017, John Curran directed a movie portrayal of Chappaquiddick, written by Taylor Allen and Andrew Logan. The movie depicts Edward (Ted) Kennedy attempting to persuade Mary Jo Kopechne to join his presidential campaign. In the film, Mary Jo is seen as a political strategist and victim to the car crash. Aside from mentioning Robert (Bobby) Kennedy's campaign, the Boiler Room Girls' other political work is not mentioned.

The BNMC was founded in 2001 by a consortium (including the University at Buffalo School of Medicine and Roswell Park Cancer Institute). This project comprises one of the five \\"Strategic Investment Areas\\" that make up Buffalo, NY's Queen City Hub Plan, the city's strategic plan for urban redevelopment. History The Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus, Inc. (BNMC, Inc.) is the umbrella organization created in 2001 by the institutions within the Medical Campus in Buffalo, New York. Since then, the campus has grown to over seven institutions, including the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo General Hospital and the University at Buffalo School of Medicine. The not- for-profit organization was created to foster conversation and collaboration among member institutions, their employees, and the community. It also coordinates activities related to sustainable planning, development and enhancement of the 120-acre space which includes working to create a distinct, innovative environment that provides opportunities for entrepreneurship and active and healthy living. The Medical Campus encompasses 6.5 million square feet of existing clinical, research, and support space today. There is more than two million square feet under construction totaling an investment of more than $750 million in private and public funding. Some 12,000 people work on the Medical Campus today, and that number is expected to rise to nearly 17,000 by 2017. On an annual basis, more than 1.5 million patients and visitors go through BNMC's doors. In January 2016, The Buffalo News reported the Buffalo- Niagara region's unemployment in December 2015 was only 4.9 percent, the lowest level in nine years according to the New York State Department of Labor. The low unemployment was attributed to large building projects such as SolarCity and the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus which fueled a hiring boom for construction workers with job growth running at an average pace of 1.6 percent which is more than double the rate of hiring during 2014 and nearly three times stronger than the employment gains during both 2012 and 2013. As of the beginning of February 2016, minority and women-owned businesses have been awarded more than $55 million in contracts for work on the UB Medical School building under construction on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus. =Future= It is estimated that by 2017, combined with the initiatives of Roswell Park Cancer Institute and UB 2020, employment on the Buffalo Niagara Medical Campus could exceed 17,000, close to that of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, NY before its closure. With the completion of John R. Oishei Children's Hospital and the Jacobs School of Medicine, the next building planned for the campus is 33 High Street, an 11-story, 300,000 square foot building by Ciminelli Real Estate. A pedestrian bridge linking the Conventus office building with the Jacobs School of Medicine is scheduled to open in 2018. This bridge will provide the Medical Campus with coatless access to the Allen/Medical Campus station of the Buffalo Metro Rail.

Set in Los Angeles, the film follows six Indian men who are detained without evidence by the police. Feeling wronged and vengeful, they team up to plot a bank heist that would leave the Los Angeles Police Department penniless. However, once things go out of hand, they start suspecting each other's identities, resulting in violence and chaos. Kaante was heavily inspired by Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) as well as the film that inspired it, Ringo Lam's City on Fire (1987). According to Tarantino, Kaante is his favorite among the many films that were heavily inspired by his work. Kaante was released theatrically on 20 December 2002. The film was a success at the box office, with first-week earnings of ¬£1.8million in India, nearly $1million in the United States, and ¬£268,507 in Britain. The film's final worldwide gross was 430million ($9million), including 331.2million in India and $2.05 million overseas.  Plot  In Los Angeles, six men of Indian origin, with criminal record, are detained by the Police, and interrogated about stealing a truck full of laptops and it's whereabouts. Their deep antipathy towards the police for arresting them without any evidence, just because the witnesses had seen an Indian at the crime scene, grows into a daring plot. Sparked off by \\"Ajju\\" (Sanjay Dutt) and seconded by \\"Major\\" (Amitabh Bachchan), they all hatch a plan to rob the bank in which lies the funding for the Los Angeles Police Department. In return, Ajju reveals that he stole the truck and splits the steal with everyone else. Marc (Suniel Shetty) is a bouncer who hates that his girlfriend has to work as a club-dancer and wants to rescue her from the club owner Cyrus (Gulshan Grover), by paying him the required money. He also has an ongoing spat with Ajju about his girlfriend. Major has a sick wife who he has to look after by supplying her with medicines and injections. Andy (Kumar Gaurav) is a software engineer having divorce and custody troubles, as his wife won't let him meet their child. He is also jobless and has financial troubles. Bali (Mahesh Manjrekar) and Mak (Lucky Ali) are two drug-peddlers who live off the street selling and buying illicit drugs under a drug lord. They meet when Bali is being chased by some drug dealers and meets Mak in an alley where he is adjusting something in his car. He agrees to save him only if he splits his loot. They agree to work thereafter. After the six guys get released from jail, they meet up again to discuss the bank robbery. Andy believes the loot from the truck Ajju stole earlier would be enough to gain custody of his son but when his lawyer tells him that the money is insufficient he again goes back to the gang. On a hotel roof top they start planning the robbery in which they familiarise themselves with the bank and get cars, weapons and gadgets to do this. Soon they establish their hideout in a warehouse where Major reveals that the bank will be looted the next day instead of the day after as previously planned, to thwart anyone's hidden agendas. The robbery proceeds as planned, but they find a SWAT team waiting for them outside the bank. They are engaged in gunfight and Mak is hit by a bullet while saving Major. They all escape and meet at their hideout. Mak, who was hit, is not allowed to be taken to the hospital, and Major treats his wound with some Whiskey. They all have verbal scuffles after which, Ajju, reveals that he has kidnapped the Police Chief. They interrogate him and learn that one of them is an undercover cop. This strikes suspicion among them and they decide to bring the stolen amount to their hideout. Major learns that his wife has died. Ajju befriends Marc and tells him to elope with his girlfriend where he also reveals that he actually knows English and was purposefully talking nonsense to the cops. When they return, they find Bali dead, killed by Mak for being inhuman in his interrogation of the Police Chief. Ajju reasons that Mak is the undercover cop, but Major disagrees because he believes Mak saved him during the gunfight at the bank. Marc backs up Ajju and points his gun at Major. They all arrive at a Mexican stand-off, as Andy retreats and runs away with the money. The four of them shoot each other, after which Major apologizes to Mak for not saving him. In reply, Mak apologizes saying he was just doing his duty as he is the undercover cop, and that he was the one who buzzed the cops at the bank to arrive. Major realises his mistake and shoots the already dying Mak in the head. Marc's girlfriend is shown waiting for him at the airport and Andy is shown at the end driving off the highway pursued by a police helicopter, with Mak's voice narrating the story, leaving the end to the discretion of the audience followed by ending credits.

Akshaye Khanna opted out of the project subsequently and was replaced by Lucky Ali, while Malaika Arora stepped in Lisa Ray's shoes and Namrata Singh Gujral was cast opposite Kumar Gaurav in lieu of Shilpa Shetty. The character of Renu Mathur (played by Namrata Singh Gujral) was the only role cast in Hollywood from the entire principal cast. All other principals including Amitabh Bachchan were flown in from Mumbai for the Hollywood shoot. Sunny Deol was also offered Kumar Gaurav's role at one point. The film was the first Bollywood film to be completely shot in Los Angeles. The film's production team used Hollywood technicians. The filming was completed in 31 days. Rohit Roy (from Shootout at Lokhandwala and a popular television actor) makes an appearance in the song \\"Ishq Samandar\\".  Reception  Kaante holds an 83% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a website that rates films based on published reviews by critics, averaging a score of 6.4 out of 10 from 6 reviews. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave the film three and a half stars out of five and stated, \\"Kaante takes a step forward in terms of content and technique. An apt example of progressive cinema that breaks the shackles of stereotype, the film has everything to woo the cinegoer: an impressive cast, grandiose look, an excellent second half, well executed stunts, popular music and eroticism in plenty\\". Prem Panicker of Rediff criticized the film saying \\"A more taut script, a little less of indulgence in directing, a tad more ruthlessness in editing, and this film could have pulled off a badly needed box office heist.\\" A reviewer at Sify awarded the film three and a half stars out of five and wrote, \\"A film far ahead of its time in terms of execution, Kaante is a visual delight. And combined with good performances and superb action, it's a must- see this season.\\" Derek Elley of Variety praised the direction and performances of the lead cast saying, \\"From the protags‚Äô initial meeting, heavy on closeups, Gupta directs the film primarily as a character piece, with Bachchan, Dutt and semi-comic relief Manjrekar driving the drama with richly characterized roles. Shetty, a tightly wound actor at the best of times, strikes few sparks as the nightclub bouncer, and his scenes with Arora as the chanteuse are flat.\\" Dave Kehr of The New York Times reviewed the film writing, \\"A delirious Bollywood reimagining of Reservoir Dogs, complete with musical numbers, Sanjay Gupta's Kaante shifts as fluidly between cinematic idioms as it does between Hindi and English.\\" Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times said, \\"there is a steadfast earnestness in director Sanjay Gupta's deluded attempt to equal or even better Hollywood on its own ground that is rather touching -- but not to the degree that it sustains the film's many tedious stretches.\\" Quentin Tarantino cited Kaante as his favourite among the many films that were heavily inspired by his work. He praised the film's character-building for going beyond what he was able to do with Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino stated: \\"Here I am, watching a film that I've directed and then it goes into each character's background. And I'm like, 'Whoa'. For, I always write backgrounds and stuff and it always gets chopped off during the edit. And so I was amazed on seeing this. I felt, this isn't Reservoir Dogs. But then it goes into the warehouse scene and I am like, 'Wow, it's back to Reservoir Dogs'. Isn't it amazing!\\" He also praised Amitabh Bachchan's performance. Tarantino later screened Kaante at his New Beverly Cinema alongside Reservoir Dogs and City on Fire.  Soundtrack  A. R. Rahman was initially roped in to compose music for the film. But Rahman opted out of the film, due to reasons unknown after which, the Kaante became a multi-composer soundtrack featuring music composed by Anand Raj Anand, Vishal-Shekhar and Lucky Ali. Lyrics are penned by Dev Kohli and Vishal Dadlani. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 18,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack addalbum was the year's fourth highest-selling. Tracks like 'Maahi ve' and 'Rama re' are still popular. The song \\"Ishq Samundar\\", was re- made for the Film Teraa Surroor which was sung by Himesh Reshammiya and Kanika Kapoor. The song Maahi Ve was recreated by Gourav-Roshin in the voice of Neha Kakkar for the film Wajah Tum Ho. = Track listing =  References   External links   * Cult of Kumar Indian films 2002 films 2000s Hindi-language films 2000s heist films Indian action thriller films Films scored by Anand Raj Anand 2002 action thriller films Films set in Los Angeles Films set in the United States Indian heist films Films shot in Los Angeles Films scored by Vishal‚ÄìShekhar Fictional portrayals of the Los Angeles Police Department Indian remakes of American films Films featuring an item number Films directed by Sanjay Gupta ","title":"Kaante"},{"id":"1792744","text":"American Jobs is a 2004 independent film, documentary, written, produced and directed by Greg Spotts. The film is about the loss of American jobs to low- wage foreign competition, covering the phenomenon of outsourcing in manufacturing and high-paying white-collar jobs. The filmmaker visited 19 cities and towns throughout the United States interviewing recently laid-off workers, focusing on three industries: textiles, commercial aircraft and information technology. It also contains interviews with a number of members of Congress, including: Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), Rosa DeLauro (D-Connecticut), Robin Hayes (R-North Carolina), Donald Manzullo (R-Illinois), and Hilda Solis (D-California), and includes an extended section of clips from the 1993 congressional debate on NAFTA. (North American Free Trade Agreement). Spotts self-released the film on DVD via a website on Labor Day, 2004. The CNN program Lou Dobbs Tonight featured excerpts from American Jobs on seven consecutive weeknights in September 2004, exposure which attracted a distribution deal. The Disinformation Company, publisher of Robert Greenwald's series of documentary DVDs, released American Jobs on DVD in February 2005, along with a companion book penned by Spotts, CAFTA and Free Trade: What Every American Should Know. The book was used as a lobbying tool by the AFL-CIO and members of the US Congress during the summer of 2005 when Congress was debating ratification of the Central American Free Trade Agreement.

He is known for his unorthodox interpretation of the Bible and his theatrical, accusatory style of preaching. He will often argue vehemently with other, more moderate Christians, who often accuse him of misrepresenting the Christian faith and driving people away from it with his extremism. Birdsong, known to his audience as the New Quad Preacher (at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte), Pit Preacher (at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill), the Brickyard Preacher (at North Carolina State University), the Sanford Mall Preacher (at Appalachian State University), and the Joyner Steps Preacher (at East Carolina University) has a large repertoire of subjects on which he preaches, ranging from the standards of heaven and hell, to drug use, premarital sex, homosexuality, Islam, atheism, feminism, communism, masturbation, rock and rap music, abortion, evolution, tolerance, politics, war, fashion, witchcraft, racism, and demonic possession.  Preaching style and repertoire  Birdsong uses a theatrical, accusatory style of preaching because he believes \\"getting people angry is his most effective method of preaching.\\" He often offends students with his fundamentalist views, such as his belief that \\"white folks are different, black folks are different and when you start mixing them up there's a lot of confusion,\\" and his opinion on feminism is that \\"it ain't in the Bible.\\" His views frequently result in heated debates with students, though he says it is not until \\"folks get attitudes that I get attitude.\\" When asked by a student interviewer his opinion on UNC being a liberal university, he responded, \\"This University is the most stupidest place I have ever been.\\" He called the administration \\"wicked people,\\" and said, \\"they've perverted the First Amendment -- the state was told not to interfere with the First Amendment, the freedom to practice religion. Well, just look at what religion they're talking about! It's Christianity -- look at the founding fathers!\\" His nickname for the university is \\"Homo Hill,\\" his view on homosexuality being that it is \\"an abomination to God.\\"  Students' reactions  UNC-Chapel Hill students providing a musical ambush of BirdsongthumbOn March 8, 2007, Birdsong was removed from The Pit by Campus Police following an incident. According to reports, members of the UNC outdoor recreation program Carolina Adventures had reserved half of The Pit to promote their programs. Shortly after they set up their materials, Birdsong entered The Pit near their table and began to preach. They asked him to move away from their table, and Birdsong moved to the other side of The Pit. The representatives for Carolina Adventures did not feel this was sufficient and subsequently summoned UNC Police to remove Birdsong from the area. After refusing to move further away, he was removed to loud jeers directed at the police from the crowd that had gathered to watch him preach. A similar incident occurred in the 1980s resulting in his arrest. Birdsong was issued a trespass warning that prohibited him from entering The Pit for two years. Following the incident, he returned to preach, initially in front of Davis Library, about 100 feet from The Pit, and later about 200 feet away, in front of Wilson Library on Polk Place, which he referred to as \\"the Homo Zone.\\" During this dislocation, he was sometimes referred to as the \\"adjacent to the Pit preacher\\". In March 2009, Gary's two year banishment from The Pit expired and he once again returned to preach in The Pit. Some students were glad to see him return to this popular spot after his extended absence, but the overall reaction was mixed. Some disagree with his beliefs but feel he has a right to be there. Others just find him entertaining. Backstory Birdsong professes to be an ex-Hells Angel, citing that fact multiple times when he is preaching of forgiveness. He claims that his \\"calling\\" came to him in the middle of 40 Hells Angels in Durham County in North Carolina.

Located in the south of the province, it has about 157,000 inhabitants () and is an important commercial and agricultural hub. Overview The R√≠o Cuarto River flows through the province of C√≥rdoba; its central location in the Humid Pampas favored the city's development as a transport hub for much of the surrounding agriculture, and a number of slaughterhouses and food processing plants opened in R√≠o Cuarto during the twentieth century. R√≠o Cuarto was founded on November 11, 1786, as Villa de la Concepci√≥n del R√≠o Cuarto, by the colonial Governor Rafael de Sobremonte. Its first rail connection was by way of the former Andean Railway in 1870, after which the village grew rapidly with the influx of Italian and Spanish immigrants (mainly as tenant farmers). The municipal government charter establishing the modern system of elected mayors and city council was enacted in 1883; the city's first elected mayor was Moys√©s Irusta. Father Antonio Cardarelli commissioned the construction of the city's principal Roman Catholic church, the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception, built between 1883 and 1886. The National University of R√≠o Cuarto, established in 1971, is located here. The city's football teams include Estudiantes and Atenas. R√≠o Cuarto hosted the International Biology Olympiad in 2006. The city is served by National Routes 8, 36, and 158; as well as Las Higueras Airport, inaugurated in 1954. The cable-stayed Bicentennial Bridge, was inaugurated in 2010. Some of the city's principal tourist draws include the R√≠o Cuarto Racetrack, which hosts Turismo Carretera touring car racing events; and Estancia El Durazno, an estate built in 1917 belonging to former Governor Ambrosio Olmos. The R√≠o Cuarto craters, a group of geologically unusual impact craters, are located nearby. The city's UN/LOCODE is ARRCU. University of R√≠o Cuarto The National University of R√≠o Cuarto was created on 1 May 1971 by a decree signed by President Alejandro Lanusse in accordance with the Taquini Plan enacted the previous year to provide greater access to university education in Argentina. The University of R√≠o Cuarto had an enrollment of 14,000 students in 2013, and employs 2,000 teaching staff. By its nature a multidisciplinary center in its scope a wide variety of activities, the university hosts frequent conferences, congresses, seminars, and graduate courses. Through the operation of 42 graduate and fourth-level racing term (PhD, Masters and Professional), the university provides a diversified curriculum and contributes to the scientific and technical training, vocational training, scientific research, and development of cultural life. Climate The climate is temperate, typical of the humid Pampas, with four marked seasons. Summers are warm with frequent thunderstorms; however, the heat is often \\"cut\\" by periods of southerly winds, so that the average high is a comfortable 29 ¬∞C, despite the fact that it can reach 38 ¬∞C. Fall arrives slowly in March, and winter arrives in May with the first frosts. During the very dry winters, temperatures vary according to wind patterns: northwesterly, downsloping winds can bring temperatures of 25 ¬∞C (but with cool nights) even in midwinter, whereas southerly winds can leave daytime highs around 6 ¬∞C. Temperatures descend to -5 ¬∞C sometimes, and snow is uncommon, but not extremely so: in 2007, over 15 cm of snow covered the city, and temperatures plummeted to -11 ¬∞C, reaching highs of only 0 ¬∞C on one occasion. Spring brings violent thunderstorms and wide temperature swings, with heat waves followed by frost or cool periods. On some years, the normal winter drought extends into the spring, posing a threat to agriculture; however, at 846 mm, Rio Cuarto¬¥s climate is generally favourable for crops. Transportation Rio Cuarto is served by Las Higueras Airport with one commercial airline flying to it. References External links * Municipality of R√≠o Cuarto - Official website.

Before the year is out, the one millionth visitor to the exhibit is recorded.\\" http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1980.html was the former tenant of the Transportation pavilion at Epcot at the Walt Disney World Resort. It was an opening day attraction at EPCOT Center in 1982 and it closed in 1996 to make way for Test Track, a new thrill ride through a GM testing facility. Visitors would board moving four to six person Omnimover vehicles, and would be taken through scenes that were populated with Audio-Animatronic figures and also projection effects. It was a whimsical look at the history and achievements in transportation, showing scenes from the invention of the wheel right up to the present day and beyond. The grand finale of the attraction attempted to predict a real future for transportation, with CenterCore, a sparkling metropolis that seemed to be in perpetual motion, and Pepper's Ghost illusions putting guests into futuristic vehicles. At the ride's conclusion, visitors disembarked into the TransCenter, an interactive area about new products in development by GM. World of Motion closed in 1996. GM has continued its sponsorship in World of Motion's replacement attraction, Test Track, since its opening in 1999. Since that attraction's 2012 overhaul, GM has sponsored the attraction through its Chevrolet division. History The premise of the ride was to be a humorous look into the history of transportation, from the ancient days of foot power, through time into the future. General Motors signed a 10-year sponsorship deal for the ride, in a move to compete with Ford (which had sponsored a Disney-created attraction at the 1964 New York World's Fair). The pavilion's construction was a part of the initial construction of EPCOT Center itself. The attraction was ready for grand opening with the park on October 1, 1982, and was in EPCOT Center's \\"opening cast\\". The pavilion was given a specific opening ceremony with GM executives a few days later. The ride was designed by the legendary Ward Kimball. This was the only attraction the animator ever worked on. His humor was evident in such gags as a used-chariot sale, and the world's first traffic jam. The ride The ride began with a modern u-turn up a portico that was situated directly in the entrance into the building. The Omnimovers would then bring riders to a simple caveman cave. However, it would head into the first means of transportation: footpower, where a caveman and cavewoman are seen blowing on their hot feet. The second scene presented into the earliest means of over water transportation, people traveling on projected boats and a man fast asleep on a raft floating while a crocodile lunges at him. The next scene showed the first time animal power was introduced. It showed an Assyrian tableau with a person trying to control animals from camels to zebras. This scene also shown a man holding a crystal ball on a flying carpet. The next scene showed the invention of the wheel at Babylon. A gag showed men holding a square object, a triangle object, a pentagonal object, and the award-winning circle object that won the king‚Äôs Laughter. Before exiting, riders passed a wheel factory, into a part called trade and commerce where it shows many useful ideas using wheels from different lands. There were examples such as a rickshaw and a chariot. The next scene was a used chariot dealership where everything including the Trojan Horse, was trying to be sold. Ships were introduced next as explores run into a sea serpent. The next scenes were the \\"Age of Flight\\". It began with Leonardo da Vinci and his many attempts to fly and next to him was a clearly upset Mona Lisa. The following scene was a man looking over London in a hot air balloon. The next scenes were the evolution of steam. It started out with a Mississippi Riverboat with the never ending stream of stagecoaches and such for the Western Expansion. The steam locomotive was the next evolution of steam travel, which in turn showed an authentic steam locomotive‚Äîand an authentic railroad robbery while a sheriff with a gleaming badge protects us on our way to the next scene. The scene shifted over to one of the most photographed and most remembered scenes: the world's first traffic jam. The chaos included items such as an upset horse, a spilling ice truck, and kids screaming during the 1900s. Guests then traveled past the open road scenes which include a man who crashed a bicycle, a family picnic, and early 40s and 50s cars and a Suspicious policeman. And addition a picture is taken with a flying ace and a woman, the wind and the airplanes makes it hard to take a picture. And then scenes are shown with all the modern forms of cars. The following areas were \\"speed tunnels\\" which paid homage to the tunnels in the Magic Kingdom\\"s \\"If You Had Wings\\". The Omnimover traveled through these bullet-shaped tunnels while images were played on the screens. Some included crop-dusting, rafting, and traveling down a snowmobile trail. The tunnels led to the final exhibit: CenterCore, the amazing city of the future. Just before unloading, riders were asked to \\"help shape tomorrow's mobility\\" with a similar effect as The Hitchhiking Ghosts from the Haunted Mansion, the riders in their Omnimovers appeared to be a simulated car of the future. TransCenter Riders left their Omnimover vehicles and went to the TransCenter, which was full of exhibits and showed about transportation and the things surrounding it. It took an Innoventions-style feel to all of it. The TransCenter portion of World of Motion, designed by award-winning experience designer Bob Rogers (designer) and the design team BRC Imagination Arts, offered educational attractions which included prototype cars such as the Lean Machine in the Dreamer's Workshop and a show called The Water Engine, which pitted nine animated characters associated with various and alternate fuel-systems in a debate over which motor design should be used to power cars. There was a replica of America's only wind-tunnel on display. The ever-popular show \\"The Bird and the Robot\\", starring a toucan, Bird, and an assembly-line robot, Tiger, entertained people with acts (and Bird's signature bad jokes) about the importance of the GM assembly line. A computer-generated display showed GM's car 'torture' test without actually performing it. Concept 2000 showed the process of creating prototype cars for GM. The prototype concept cars at the TransCenter were once the most photographed spot in Walt Disney World. An exhibit called Aerotest educated people about air-flow on auto concepts and fuel economy. Another exhibit featured stylings of clothes with GM's advanced polyester production styles. Closure Business slumped with General Motors after the second sponsorship deal ended for World of Motion in 1992, and as a result, GM started signing 1-year contracts for the ride. However, a suggested idea to gut the building and turn it into a new attraction stuck with Disney representatives and GM businessmen. It would take World of Motion, close it down, and refurbish it into a new ride that focused only on cars. Thus, World of Motion was shut down to the public while a new attraction, called Test Track, was taking its place. Scheduled to open 19 months after World of Motion's closing, this new ride would put guests in a test car against vehicle tests that were needed to deem the car safe for road travel.\\"General Motors and the Walt Disney Company sign a new contract that ensures GM's presence at the Walt Disney World Resort in Florida until the 21st century. The contract extends the partnership at Epcot until 2007 and provides for a complete redesign of the existing GM World of Motion pavilion.\\" http://www.gm.com/company/corp_info/history/gmhis1990.html However, nothing went as planned, and the new ride opened significantly later than the scheduled opening date. The closing of World of Motion forced the reopening of Horizons, another Disney attraction which focused on the future of the family. It was closed in 1999.  Sponsor Pavilion sponsor General Motors signed a 10-year sponsorship contract in December 1977. When the second contract finished in 1992, and with a slumping economy GM agreed only to one-year contracts and wanted Disney Imagineering to work on a new attraction. GM insisted that the new ride would focus only on cars, as opposed to the general concept of transportation. The marketing department wanted to strongly promote their cars. GM was the sponsor for the whole run of the attraction. Soundtrack The theme song for the ride was \\"It's Fun to Be Free\\", written by X Atencio (\\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\" from Pirates of the Caribbean and \\"Grim Grinning Ghosts\\" from The Haunted Mansion), and Buddy Baker, another legendary Disney composer. The song was played throughout the ride (and queue area) with music changing to reflect the different time periods as the ride progressed through the various scenes. The song can be found on The Official Album of Disneyland and Walt Disney World (1991) and Official Album: The Happiest Celebration on Earth ‚Äì Walt Disney World Resort Album.

Protesting students invoking stakeholder theory at Shimer College in 2010 The stakeholder theory is a theory of organizational management and business ethics that accounts for multiple constituencies impacted by business entities like employees, suppliers, local communities, creditors, and others. Lin, Tom C. W., Incorporating Social Activism (December 1, 2018). 98 Boston University Law Review 1535 (2018) It addresses morals and values in managing an organization, such as those related to corporate social responsibility, market economy, and social contract theory. The stakeholder view of strategy integrates a resource-based view and a market-based view, and adds a socio-political level. One common version of stakeholder theory seeks to define the specific stakeholders of a company (the normative theory of stakeholder identification) and then examine the conditions under which managers treat these parties as stakeholders (the descriptive theory of stakeholder salience). In fields such as law, management, and human resources, stakeholder theory succeeded in challenging the usual analysis frameworks, by suggesting that stakeholders' needs should be put at the beginning of any action.Harrison, Wicks, Parmar and De Colle, Stakeholder Theory, State of the Art, Cambridge University Press, 2010 Some authors such as Geoffroy Murat tried to apply stakeholder's theory to irregular warfare.Connelley and Tripodi, Aspects of leadership, Ethics, law and Spirituality, Marines Corps University Press, 2012, pp. 39‚Äì59  History  Concepts similar to modern stakeholder theory can be traced back to longstanding philosophical views about the nature of civil society itself and the relations between individuals. The word \\"stakeholder\\" in its current use first appeared in an internal memorandumR. F. Stewart, J. K. Allen, J. M Cavender: The Strategic Plan, LRPS report no. 168.

Graaf: Contagious ideas and cognitive artefacts: the SWOT Analysis evolution in business. BAM2017 Conference Proceedings, 2017. Subsequently, a \\"plethora\\" of stakeholder definitions and theories were developed.Bidhan L. Parmar, R. Edward Freeman, Jeffrey S. Harrison, Andrew C. Wicks, Simone de Colle, Lauren Purnell: Stakeholder theory: the state of the Art. The Academy of Management Annals, June 2010, doi:10.1080/19416520.2010.495581.Alex Murdock: Stakeholders. In: Helmut K. Anheier, Stefan Toepler (eds.): International Encyclopedia of Civil Society. doi:10.1007/978-0-387-93996-4_154. In 1971, Hein Kroos and Klaus Schwab published the German book Moderne Unternehmensf√ºhrung im Maschinenbau (Modern Enterprise Management in Mechanical Engineering) argueing that the management of a modern enterprise must serve not only shareholders but all stakeholders (die Interessenten) to achieve long-term growth and prosperity. US authors followed, for example, In 1983, Ian Mitroff published \\"Stakeholders of the Organizational Mind\\" in San Francisco. R. Edward Freeman had an article on Stakeholder theory in the California Management Review in early 1983, but makes no reference to Mitroff's work, attributing the development of the concept to internal discussion in the Stanford Research Institute. He followed this article with a book Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach. This book identifies and models the groups which are stakeholders of a corporation, and both describes and recommends methods by which management can give due regard to the interests of those groups. In short, it attempts to address the \\"principle of who or what really counts. In the traditional view of a company, the shareholder view, only the owners or shareholders of the company are important, and the company has a binding fiduciary duty to put their needs first, to increase value for them. Stakeholder theory instead argues that there are other parties involved, including employees, customers, suppliers, financiers, communities, governmental bodies, political groups, trade associations, and trade unions. Even competitors are sometimes counted as stakeholders ‚Äì their status being derived from their capacity to affect the firm and its stakeholders. The nature of what constitutes a stakeholder is highly contested (Miles, 2012), with hundreds of definitions existing in the academic literature (Miles, 2011).  Development  Numerous articles and books written on stakeholder theory generally credit Freeman as the \\"father of stakeholder theory.\\" Freeman's Strategic Management: A Stakeholder Approach is widely cited in the field as being the foundation of stakeholder theory, although Freeman himself credits several bodies of literature in the development of his approach, including strategic management, corporate planning, systems theory, organization theory, and corporate social responsibility. A related field of research examines the concept of stakeholders and stakeholder salience, or the importance of various stakeholder groups to a specific firm. An anticipation of such concepts, as part of Corporate Social Responsibility, appear in a publication that appeared in 1968 by the Italian economist Giancarlo Pallavicini, creator of \\"the decomposition method of the parameters\\" to calculate the results are not directly economic activity of enterprise, regarding ethical issues , moral, social, cultural and environmental. \\"Integrated structures in the Italian distribution system,\\" Giuffre Editore, Milan, 1968, pp. VIII / 351 ^ \\"Universal Biographical Encyclopedia\\" Treccani, 2007 Edition, Vol. 14, p. 617; \\"Treccani - Portal\\", Social Sciences / economists / Biographies; Annual Meeting Bancoper, Bologna, 15.11.2008, Prefect Angelo Tranfaglia, \\"Profit and social responsibility\\", p. 12; \\"Finanza e Mercati\\", February 3, 2009, p. 11, Mara Consoli, \\"When ethics become a bargain\\"; New Chronicles, CNEL, Rome, 12.01.2009, Adelaide Mochi, \\"Socialis Prize and corporate social responsibility\\" More recent scholarly works on the topic of stakeholder theory that exemplify research and theorizing in this area include Donaldson and Preston (1995), Mitchell, Agle, and Wood (1997), Friedman and Miles (2002), and Phillips (2003). Donaldson and Preston argue that the theory has multiple distinct aspects that are mutually supportive: descriptive, instrumental, and normative. The descriptive approach is used in research to describe and explain the characteristics and behaviors of firms, including how companies are managed, how the board of directors considers corporate constituencies, the way that managers think about managing, and the nature of the firm itself. The instrumental approach uses empirical data to identify the connections that exist between the management of stakeholder groups and the achievement of corporate goals (most commonly profitability and efficiency goals). The normative approach, identified as the core of the theory by Donaldson and Preston, examines the function of the corporation and identifies the \\"moral or philosophical guidelines for the operation and management of the corporation.\\" Since the publication of this article in 1995, it has served as a foundational reference for researchers in the field, having been cited over 1,100 times. Mitchell, et al. derive a typology of stakeholders based on the attributes of power (the extent a party has means to impose its will in a relationship), legitimacy (socially accepted and expected structures or behaviors), and urgency (time sensitivity or criticality of the stakeholder's claims). By examining the combination of these attributes in a binary manner, 8 types of stakeholders are derived along with their implications for the organization. Friedman and Miles explore the implications of contentious relationships between stakeholders and organizations by introducing compatible/incompatible interests and necessary/contingent connections as additional attributes with which to examine the configuration of these relationships. Robert Allen Phillips distinguishes between normatively legitimate stakeholders (those to whom an organization holds a moral obligation) and derivatively legitimate stakeholders (those whose stakeholder status is derived from their ability to affect the organization or its normatively legitimate stakeholders).  Implementation in other fields  Stakeholder theory succeeds in becoming famous not only in the business ethics fields. It is used as one of the frameworks in corporate social responsibility methods. For example, ISO 26000 and GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) involve stakeholder analysis. In the field of business ethics, Weiss, J.W. (2014) illustrates how stakeholder analysis can be complemented with issues management approaches to examine societal, organizational, and individual dilemmas. Several case studies are offered to illustrated uses of these methods. Stakeholder theory has seen growing uptake in higher education in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. One influential definition defines a stakeholder in the context of higher education as anyone with a legitimate interest in education who thereby acquires a right to intervene. Studies of higher education first began to recognize students as stakeholders in 1975. External stakeholders may include employers. In Europe, the rise of stakeholder regimes has arisen from the shift of higher education from a government-run bureaucracy to modern system in which the government's role involves more monitoring than direct control.  Criticism  The political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized stakeholder theory for assuming that the interests of the various stakeholders can be, at best, compromised or balanced against each other. Blattberg argues that this is a product of its emphasis on negotiation as the chief mode of dialogue for dealing with conflicts between stakeholder interests. He recommends conversation instead and this leads him to defend what he calls a 'patriotic' conception of the corporation as an alternative to that associated with stakeholder theory. According to Mansell (2013), by applying the political concept of a 'social contract' to the corporation, stakeholder theory undermines the principles on which a market economy is based.Mansell, S.

The Aspen Skiing Company operates the Aspen/Snowmass resort complex, comprising four ski areas: Aspen Mountain, Aspen Highlands, Buttermilk, and Snowmass. History The Company was founded in 1946 by Friedl Pfeifer, an Austrian ski instructor and racing champion, Walter Paepcke, a successful Chicago industrialist, Judge William E. Doyle, James J. Johnston, and H. F. Klock. Paepcke also founded cultural institutions in the city, such as the Aspen Institute and the Aspen Music Festival. The Aspen Skiing Company established the Aspen Mountain ski resort on Aspen Mountain above the town of Aspen, Colorado. The first chair lift, Lift-1, opened on December 14, 1946, and was the world's longest chairlift at the time. In 1950, the company hosted the FIS World Alpine Championships, the first international skiing competition in the United States. In the following decades, the company opened Buttermilk in 1958 and the Snowmass (originally the Snowmass-at-Aspen Ski Area) in 1967. In 1993 the company assumed ownership and operation of Aspen Highlands, which was founded in 1958 by Colorado Ski Hall of Famer: Whip Jones. Previously, Jones successfully sued Aspen Skiing before the Supreme Court for antitrust violations in Aspen Skiing Co. v. Aspen Highlands Skiing Corp. The company didn't pay dividends until it was bought by Twentieth Century Fox in 1977, which is when the ticket prices began to increase. In the 1970s, ticket prices were just over 10 dollars a day; now, they are more reflective of industry averages. In 2012, the Aspen Skiing Company built a 3-megawatt methane-to- electricity plant in Somerset, Colorado, at Oxbow Carbon's Elk Creek Mine. In addition to managing and operating four ski areas, the company operates and owns hotels including The Little Nell and The Limelight, both in Aspen. The company also operates on-mountain and off-mountain restaurants and operates a skiing and snowboard school, The Ski and Snowboard Schools of Aspen/Snowmass. The school provides group and private lessons at all four mountains and teaches all level of student from beginner to expert. The managing director of the ski school is Jonathan Ballou who was appointed in spring 2017, succeeding Katie Ertl. The ski season typically runs from Thanksgiving Day to mid-April, depending on weather and snow conditions. The Aspen Skiing Company is currently owned by the Crown family of Chicago. The Crowns also own significant holdings in General Dynamics and Wall Street's JP Morgan Chase. The President and CEO of the company is Mike Kaplan, who succeeded Pat O'Donnell. Lobbying The Aspen Skiing Company supported the Water Rights Protection Act. The bill would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. In 2012, a court ruled \\"in favor of the ski companies... that seizing the privately held water rights usurped state water law.\\" However, the United States Forest Service decided to pursue a \\"new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands.\\" The Colorado ski industry supported the Water Rights Protection Act because it believed the legislation was \\"needed to block a water extortion scheme by the Forest Service to withhold government permits unless the companies relinquish their valuable water rights.\\" Vice President of the Aspen Skiing Company David Corbin testified to the House Natural Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power that the company would go out of business without the water.

Deaths of some of Patel's patients led to widespread publicity in 2005. In June 2010, he was convicted of three counts of manslaughter and one case of grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to seven years' imprisonment.. In August 2012, all convictions were quashed by the full bench of the High Court of Australia and a retrial was ordered due to \\"highly emotive and prejudicial evidence that was irrelevant to the case\\" laid before the jury.. A retrial for one of the manslaughter counts resulted in acquittal and led to a plea deal where Patel pleaded guilty to fraud and the remaining charges were dropped. On 15 May 2015, he was barred from practising medicine in Australia. Early life and education Jayant Patel was born in Jamnagar in the Indian state of Gujarat. Initially, he studied surgery at the M. P. Shah Medical College at the Saurashtra University, obtaining a master's degree. He then moved to the United States where he received further surgical training at the University of Rochester School of Medicine as a surgical intern and a resident in surgery. Career =Buffalo, New York, US= In 1984 in Buffalo, New York, health officials cited Patel for failing to examine patients before surgery. He was fined US$5,000 and was placed on three years' clinical probation. In April 2001, New York State health officials withdrew Patel's license. =Portland, Oregon, US= In 1989, Patel moved to the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Portland, Oregon. In 1995, the hospital named him a \\"Distinguished Physician of the Year.\\" By this time, Patel had been involved in a string of problem cases, eight of which had prompted or would later lead to malpractice or wrongful death lawsuits. Medical staff allege he performed surgery when not rostered to work, operated on other surgeons' patients, operated unnecessarily and caused serious injury and death. In 1998, Kaiser Permanente restricted Patel's practice; he was instructed not to operate on the liver or pancreas and to seek second opinions before performing other surgeries. In September 2000, after reviewing four cases involving the deaths of three patients, the Oregon Board of Medical Examiners made Patel's restriction statewide. Even though his medical license had been restricted, Patel still received glowing letters of recommendation from his colleagues at Kaiser Permanente. =Bundaberg, Queensland, Australia= In 2003, Patel moved to the position of Director of Surgery at the Bundaberg Base Hospital, where he was employed by Queensland Health under an \\"area of need\\" program where overseas trained doctors are employed in predominantly regional understaffed areas. He was appointed despite having no specialist surgical qualifications. Practice in Bundaberg Inadequacies in Patel's practice were identified. His surgery was described as \\"antiquated\\" and \\"sloppy\\". Nurses claimed they hid their patients from him when they knew he was in the hospital. He showed poor regard for hygiene. He attracted the nickname \\"Dr. Death\\". It is alleged he altered medical records, including death certificates to hide his inadequacies. Note: Temporarily Offline During Trial - 21 March 2010 Patel is linked to at least 87 deaths among the 1,202 patients he treated between 2003 and early 2005. Thirty patients died while under his care in Bundaberg. On 22 March 2005, Stuart Copeland, the Queensland Shadow Minister for Health, raised the issue of Patel's clinical practice during question time in Queensland Parliament. Copeland had been alerted to Patel's inadequacies by Toni Hoffman, a nurse at the Bundaberg Base Hospital. Two days later, Rob Messenger, the National Party MP for Burnett, also raised the matter in a speech to the Legislative Assembly and called for Patel's suspension. After Hedley Thomas, a journalist at the Brisbane Courier-Mail, published reports about Patel, the newspaper and other media outlets were flooded with claims of patients' injury or death caused by Patel's operations. On 2 April 2005, Patel departed Australia for Portland using a business-class airfare paid for by Queensland Health. His passport had not been withheld. On 22 November 2006, a magistrate issued a warrant for Patel's arrest and extradition to Australia. He was charged with three charges of manslaughter, five charges of causing grievous bodily harm, four of negligent acts causing harm and eight charges of fraud. He was extradited to Australia on 21 July 2008. Morris Inquiry In response to public discontent over Patel's performance at Bundaberg Base Hospital, the Beattie Government convened the \\"Bundaberg Hospital Commission of Inquiry\\". The Inquiry held similar judicial powers to a Royal Commission, and commenced hearings in Brisbane on 23 May 2005. It was led by Anthony Morris, a Queen's Counsel. On 10 June, Morris released an interim report that was tabled on the same day in State Parliament by Premier Beattie. The report recommended, among other things, that Patel be charged with murder or manslaughter in respect to one patient, with causing \\"a negligent act causing harm\\" to another patient, that he also be charged with fraud in relation to his registration at the Medical Board of Queensland to practice medicine and that extradition proceedings should begin. It also recommended changes to the Medical Practitioners Registration Act 2001. The Morris Inquiry began hearings in Bundaberg on 20 June. Nurses, local Queensland Health administrators and former patients of Patel were all expected to give evidence. Public hearings in Bundaberg concluded on 14 July. The Inquiry resumed public hearings in Brisbane on 25 July and also sat in Townsville from 2 to 4 August. During the course of the Morris Inquiry, two senior Queensland Health bureaucrats in the Bundaberg region, Darren Keating and Peter Leck, filed an application in the Supreme Court of Queensland calling for the inquiry to be shut down, alleging that Morris had shown apprehended bias against them. On 1 September, Justice Martin Moynihan of the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the applicants, finding that the Commission of Inquiry was contaminated with ostensible bias against Keating and Leck, and that evidence gathered from other witnesses was entangled with the evidence given by Keating and Leck.  Davies Inquiry  The new inquiry began on 8 September 2005 and was headed by former Supreme Court of Queensland judge Justice Geoffrey Davies QC. This inquiry, formally titled the Queensland Public Hospitals Commission of Inquiry, was widely known as the Davies Inquiry. The report of the Davies Inquiry was handed down on 30 November 2005. It recommended that charges of manslaughter and other criminal offenses be prosecuted against Patel. The report also apportioned much of the blame to two former Health Ministers, Gordon Nuttall and Wendy Edmond, as well as senior Queensland Health bureaucrats for allowing the existence of an organizational culture of secrecy and ostracizing of whistleblowers that allowed Patel's misdeeds to go unpunished for two years. An independent surgeon, Peter Woodruff, who was asked by Justice Davies to examine Patel's work believes that Patel negligently caused 13 deaths, and serious complications suffered by at least 31 others. Forster Inquiry The Forster Inquiry, also known as the Queensland Health Systems Review, was commissioned by the Queensland Government on 16 April 2005 as a non-judicial inquiry specifically due to the political and public sentiments following the practices of Dr Jayant Patel at Bundaberg Hospital with a broader focus on the practices, systems and processes of Queensland Health. Its report was issued in September 2005. Legal proceedings =Extradition= Patel was arrested 11 March 2008 by FBI agents. He appeared in court that day with a court- appointed attorney, telling Federal Magistrate Dennis Hubel that he was unable to afford a lawyer, after incurring significant pre-trial legal fees. In response, the Magistrate ordered Patel, who lives in a $900,000 house, to fill out a financial affidavit before an upcoming detention hearing. Following his arrest, Toni Hoffman, the nurse who took her complaints about Patel to a member of the Parliament of Australia, said that \\"I am relieved he's been arrested, but there's still a lot to go.\\" Patel denied the allegations. The extradition proceeding against Patel began April 2008. Patel was denied bail by Judge Hebel on 28 June 2008, with the judge warning Australian and US authorities that they must extradite Patel by 21 July 2008, or he would release Patel on bail. Patel was extradited: U.S. Marshals handed Patel over to two officers from the Queensland Police Service at Los Angeles International Airport on 19 July, who then escorted him on board Qantas flight QF 176. The flight arrived at Brisbane Airport on the morning of 21 July. Patel was taken immediately to the Brisbane watch-house and was granted bail by the Roma Street Magistrates Court the same day. =Trial= Patel was tried in the Queensland Supreme Court for the unlawful killing of three patients, and grievous bodily harm to a fourth. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. On 29 June 2010, Jayant Patel was found guilty of all four charges. On 1 July, he was sentenced to seven years' jail for his offences. Patel appealed his conviction and sentence to the Court of Appeal, and the prosecution also appealed sentence. Both appeals were dismissed. Appeal to High Court Patel then appealed the Court of Appeal's decision to the High Court of Australia, and was granted special leave to appeal. On 24 August 2012, the High Court unanimously allowed the appeal and quashed Patel's convictions on the ground that prejudicial evidence had likely influenced the jury. Patel argued that by the time prosecutors admitted 43 days into the trial that they could not prove Patel was guilty of incompetence, the jury had already heard testimony and evidence about his unusual behavior. The High Court granted Patel a new trial. Retrial The following year, a retrial was held for one of the manslaughter charges, and Patel was acquitted by the jury. This resulted in calls to have the remaining charges against Patel dropped. The remaining manslaughter and grievous bodily harm charges were later dropped in exchange for Patel pleading guilty to two counts related to him dishonestly gaining registration and two counts related to dishonestly gaining employment in Queensland. Patel was sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence for those fraud charges. Aftermath In a television documentary on the case aired by CNN in November 2010 as part of its \\"World's Untold Stories\\" series and entitled \\"They Called Him 'Dr. Death'\\", several of Patel's medical co-workers in Australia testified to having repeatedly blown a whistle on him only to be ignored by medical superiors and other authorities. Questions were also raised about the lack of due diligence by those involved in his appointment. In response to the case, Peter Beattie fired the Director General, Robert Stable and changes were made to funding, the operations of the medical board, and to how concerns raised by whistle blowers are handled. On 15 May 2015, the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal banned Patel from ever practising medicine in Australia again. The tribunal upheld the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency's contentions that Patel deceived authorities into granting him a medical licence, concealed matters related to his fitness to be a doctor, and performed surgeries that he knew he could not competently perform.Medical Board of Australia v Patel [2015 QCAT 133], Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal.

She was raised as a Catholic by her parents.Pitt, Helen. (10 April 2011). \\"Girl talk: Cover story\\". The Sun-Herald, Sydney. p. 12. Buttrose's father, Charles Oswald Buttrose, was a journalist and at one time the editor of The Daily Mirror in Sydney. By her own account she had decided on a career in journalism at the age of 11. Buttrose spent her first five years in New York City when her father was the New York correspondent for The Daily Mirror.Helen Pitt, \\"Ita Buttrose on kick-starting a sexual revolution\\", Brisbane Times, 11 April 2011 She has Jewish ancestry on her maternal side.https://www.sbs.com.au/programs/who-do-you-think-you- are/article/2016/08/30/most-surprising-celebrity-discoveries-made-who-do-you- think-you-are The family returned to Australia in 1949 and settled in the harbourside suburb of Vaucluse. Her parents divorced during her teens, after 25 years of marriage, and details of her father's private life were printed in the tabloid press, causing considerable anguish to her mother. Buttrose briefly attended a private school but because her father could not afford the fees she was then moved to a public school. She completed her secondary education at Dover Heights Home Science High School, leaving at 15 to begin her career. She started her career at Australian Consolidated Press, owned by the Packer family, working as a copy girl at The Australian Women's Weekly, then became a cadet journalist on The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph in Sydney. Her first byline came in 1959 when the 17-year-old covered the Australian tour by Princess Alexandra. Career At 21 years of age, Buttrose married architect Alasdair \\"Mac\\" Macdonald and had two children. She was appointed women's editor of the Telegraph at just 23 years old. In 1966 she won a racetrack fashion contest run by a rival newspaper, for which the first prize was an overseas trip, including a visit to Expo 67 in Montreal. Buttrose and her husband then stopped in England in 1967 where she worked for a time on the British national magazine Woman's Own before giving birth to her first child, a daughter, Kate. It was after her daughter's birth that she received a telegram from Sir Frank Packer, head of Australian Consolidated Press, offering her back her former job as women's editor at the Telegraph. The family then returned to Australia. In 1971 Buttrose was chosen as founding editor of a new Australian women's magazine.Australian of the Year 2013, www.australianoftheyear.org.au Retrieved on 24 March 2015 This was originally to have been an Australian edition of the renowned American magazine Cosmopolitan, but the deal fell through after Hearst Magazines sold the Cosmopolitan rights to longtime Packer rivals Fairfax, so Packer and Buttrose set about creating a new publication, dubbed Cleo, which they launched in 1972, several months ahead of its rival. Cleo was an instant hit, selling its entire original print run in just two days; the magazine broke new ground in Australian mainstream publishing, featuring the first nude male centrefold (actor Jack Thompson) and frank articles on female sexuality and other topics, leading to the inclusion of the first sealed section in an Australian magazine. During the early months of the magazine, Buttrose became pregnant with her second child, Ben, but with the grudging support of the Packers she worked through her pregnancy; an unusual feat for that time as it was still common for women to have to give up work permanently after they became pregnant. Buttrose edited Cleo until 1975, when she was appointed editor of the Packers' flagship magazine, The Australian Women's Weekly (1975‚Äì76), then she became editor-in-chief of both publications from 1976‚Äì78, before being appointed Publisher of Australian Consolidated Press Women's Division from 1978‚Äì81. In 1981 she left the Packers after their rival Rupert Murdoch offered her the job of Editor-in-Chief of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph in 1981, making her the first female editor of a major metropolitan newspaper in Australia, a position she held until 1984; she was also appointed to the board of News Limited. She made frequent appearances on radio and TV and in 1980, her media prominence led to her becoming the subject of the song \\"Ita\\", recorded by rock band Cold Chisel, which was included on their successful East album. Buttrose was the chairperson of the National Advisory Committee on AIDS (NACAIDS) from 1984 until 1988. On one occasion, she appeared personally in a nationwide TV campaign to explain that donating blood at a blood bank did not pose a risk of catching AIDS (the fear of which had caused a significant drop in donations). After her stint with News Limited, Buttrose founded her own publishing company, Capricorn Publishing, and launched her own magazine, Ita, but this eventually folded and she launched a new company, the Good Life Publishing Company, which in 2005 published bark!, a lifestyle magazine aimed at dog owners.

Matthews played guitar, double bass, and bass guitar. Biography Born in Nashville, Tennessee, as the son of Neal Matthews Sr., Matthews served with the United States Army during the Korean War and received a Bronze Star. Following his discharge in 1953, he became a member of the Nashville-based singing group, The Jordanaires. Matthews developed the Nashville Number System for chords in music that was instrumental in creating the Nashville sound. As a member of The Jordanaires, he worked with artists such as Patsy Cline, Red Foley, Johnny Horton, Ferlin Husky, Jim Reeves and George Jones. The group also served as backup vocalists for pop music artists such as Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Connie Francis and Julie Andrews. They are best known, however, as the backup vocalists for Elvis Presley for 15 years. Matthews and the group also toured extensively around the world and recorded a number of their own albums, winning a Grammy Award for Best Southern, Country, or Bluegrass Album. Matthews died of a heart attack at age 70 and was interred in the Woodlawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Nashville. He was survived by his wife (Charlsie Stewart Matthews), two children (Lisa Matthews Doster and Gregory Stewart Matthews), and two grandchildren (Matthew Thomas Doster and William Cole Doster). As part of The Jordanaires, in 2001 he was inducted posthumously into the Country Music Hall of Fame.

Details of Tovata It is located in the north east of the country, covering the provinces of Bua, Macuata and Cakaudrove on the northern island Vanua Levu, as well as the Lau Islands. Paramount Title of Tovata The Tovata Confederacy, (unlike the Kubuna and Burebasaga confederacies) is a recent invention. It was conceived in 14th February 1867 by Ma‚Äôafu as cited in the Na Mata as follows: A tauyavutaka na turaga ni Toga o Ma'afu ena nona via vakacokovatataka na vanua era vakarorogo vua, ena veirogorogoci kei ira na turaga ni vanua o Bua, Macuata, Cakaudrove kei Lau. The key word here is ‚Äúveirogorogoci‚Äù which denotes ‚Äúlistening to each other‚Äù. In other words, this confederacy's membership are equal in rank which is why during traditional oratures and discourses, it is referred to as ‚ÄúMatanitu Veiwekani. Seen another way, this is Fiji's equivalent of a United Nations of sorts, where each chief is of equal ranking with other chiefs in the Tovata jurisdiction. Kubuna and Burebasaga confederacies, on the other hand have layers upon layers of chief, vassal warlord, chieftain and ranks within ranks, underscoring its long alliances and relationships in-built into it. Tovata is not like that. It is more even and democratic in structure. It was conceived by Ma‚Äôafu and headed by the British consul in Levuka as its prime minister. There is no paramount chief in the Tovata Confederacy. Notable Fijians of Tovata Although the smallest of the three confederacies, Tovata has been the most politically influential. Ratu Sir Lala Sukuna, considered the father of modern Fiji, was from Tovata, as were Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, Fiji's longtime first prime minister and second president; Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the first president of Fiji. In addition, Sitiveni Rabuka, former prime minister, and Laisenia Qarase, the recently removed prime minister, are also from Tovata. Political and youth activist Roko Jonetani (a.k.a. Pita) Waqavonovono is also from Tovata. Other notable leaders are Tui Cakau Ratu Naiqama Lalabalavu and Ratu Epeli Ganilau, both of whom have been politically active. Business persons also from Tovata include Roko Matai of the Yatu Lau and Mere Samisoni, founder of the bakery chain Hot Bread Kitchen and a former Member of Parliament.

She was also regent of Eswatini from 1983 to 1986. She is the mother of King Mswati III. Early life and marriage Ntfombi was born in 1950. She married King Sobhuza II of Swaziland, with whom she had a son, Prince Makhosetive Dlamini. In 1982 King Sobhuza designated another of his wives, Queen Dzeliwe, as the Indlovukati to reign as joint sovereign with his future successor. Instead of recognizing one of her sons as his heir apparent, he indicated to his Loqoqo that he wanted Prince Makhosetive Dlamini to succeed him on the throne. In June 1982 he also extended the authority of the Loqoqo, empowering it to act as a \\"Supreme Council of State\\", free to appoint an \\"Authorised Person\\" to exercise the royal prerogative if a regent was deemed unable to do so properly. Regency of Queen Dzeliwe In the power vacuum that resulted from the death of Sobhuza II, Indlovukati Dzeliwe became Queen Regent during the minority of the designated heir to the throne, but the Loqoqo, consisting mostly of King Sobhuza's senior relatives, chiefs and advisors, usurped her authority and sacked Sobhuza's prime minister, Prince Mabandla Dlamini, whom Loqoqo members apparently feared would strip them of their new role.

It has a 25 acre man-made lake and of mixed prairie and deciduous forest. It is used for picnics, swimming, camping, hiking, horseback riding, and other outdoor recreation. It is noted for butterfly watching, as some rare species have been seen. It features a picnic shelter which dates to the Public Works Administration era. History Sometime in the late 1850s or early 1860s, Conrad Hambrecht settled in section 21 of Le Roy Township on the Upper Iowa River near the Old Village of Leroy. An earthen dam was later built on the river and Hambrecht's land sat along the small lake that was created. Hambrecht set aside this part of land for recreation and he later donated the land, then called Wildwood Park, to the city of Le Roy with the stipulation that it be used as a park. The original dam was washed away and the citizens of Le Roy rebuilt it and named the body of water \\"Lake Louise\\" for Hambrecht's sister. In 1961 local advocates arranged a visit by state park officials, who agreed that Wildwood Park could be expanded into a state park. The land was transferred to the state of Minnesota and in 1963 Lake Louise State Park was created by an act of the Minnesota Legislature. At that time it contained only the lake and . The boundaries have been expanded since, but usage remains primarily local. A 1971 internal study recommended that the park be remanded to the county as a regional recreation area, but no such action was ever taken. References *Meyer, Roy W.

There were around five of these when the war ended. *The Base Force or Ê†πÊã†Âú∞Èöä Konkyochi-tai and The Special Base Force or ÁâπÂà•Ê†πÊã†Âú∞Èöä Tokubetsu-konkyochi-tai provided a variety of services both administrative and tactical in areas outside Japan proper, Korea, and Formosa. The Japanese raised around fifty of these units which ranged in size from 250 to 1500 men depending on location and function. The Base Force could also include afloat units. *Defense Units or Èò≤ÂÇôÈöä B≈çbi-tai: units of from 250 to 2000 men organized for defense of naval installations and areas of strategic importance within Japan. Some Defense Units included artillery emplacements and some controlled the minefields in Japanese waters. *Guard Units or Ë≠¶ÂÇôÈöä Keibi-tai: 100 to 1500 men units responsible for ground defense of Imperial Japanese Navy facilities. They were frequently assigned to Base Forces and Special Base Forces. The Japanese raised around one hundred of these units. Many of these units played a notable part in the defense of Japanese held islands during the later stages of the war, such as the Iwo Jima Keibi-tai consisting of 1000 men led by Captain Samaji Inouye. *Anti-Aircraft Defense Units or Èò≤Á©∫Èöä B≈çk≈´-tai: Anti- aircraft artillery units of 200‚Äì350 men. There were three types which differed based on the number and kind of anti-aircraft weapons assigned. Type A includes AA artillery and machine-guns, Type B machine-guns only, and Type C machine-guns and machine- cannon.https://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/KYE/CINCPAC-11-45/index.html The Japanese formed over two hundred of these units which were primarily located in areas outside Japan, Formosa, and Korea. They were usually assigned to Base Forces, Special Base Forces, Special Naval Landing Forces, and Guard Forces. *Construction Battalions or Ë®≠Âñ∂Èöä Setsuei-tai built and repaired naval facilities of all kinds, including airstrips, barracks, ammunition bunkers, and fuel depots on remote islands as well as Japan's major naval bases. Most personnel were civilian employees and unarmed. The units also included naval engineers overseeing the operations and sailors guarding the unit, both being lightly armed for defense. The Construction Battalions often made use of local labor whose service was compulsory. *The Communications Units or ÈÄö‰ø°Èöä Ts≈´shin- tai of 100‚Äì2,000 men were stationed ashore to provide communications between Japan's widespread naval installations and to and from the fleets and ships at sea. *The Tokkeitai Navy military police units carried out ordinary military police functions in naval installations and occupied territories; they also worked with the Imperial Japanese Army's Kempeitai military police, the Keishi-ch≈ç civil police and Tokk≈ç secret units on matters concerning security, intelligence collection, and counter intelligence. *Anti Aircraft Artillery Batteries or È´òÂ∞ÑÁ†≤‰∏≠Èöä Koshaho Chutai were units of forty or fifty men organized for the air defense of important installations and were subordinate to Air Defense Sectors which in turn were subordinate to Defense Units. These batteries were separate from the previously mentioned Bobitai. Several hundred of them were in existence at the end of the war.

She was the first ship named for Benjamin F. Sands and his son, James H. Sands. Construction Sands was ordered from the New York Shipbuilding Corporation on 29 December 1917, and was laid down on 22 March 1919 at the New York Shipbuilding Corporation's, Camden, New Jersey shipyard.The Engineer 10 March 1920, p. 264. The ship was launched on 28 October 1919, sponsored by Miss Jane McCue Sands. Sands was commissioned on 10 November 1920, Ensign William D. Leahy, Jr. in temporary command. Service history =1920s= Following commissioning, Sands remained at Philadelphia to fit out for European duty. On 22 November, Lieutenant M. L. Sperry, Jr., relieved Ens. Leahy as temporary commanding officer; and, on 13 December, Commander Robert L. Ghormley assumed command. The next day, the destroyer departed from Philadelphia; steamed to Melville, Rhode Island, for torpedo outfit; then proceeded to New York. On 3 January 1921, she sailed for Europe. She arrived at Brest on the 16th and, for the next seven months, conducted runs between French and British ports. In mid- August, she steamed for the Baltic; called at various ports on that sea, despite the still present danger of mines, and returned to Cherbourg on 27 September. Three weeks later, she cleared the French coast and headed for the eastern Mediterranean-Black Sea area. There, fighting between Greeks and Turks in coastal Asia Minor; between Turks and Armenians on the Anatolian plateau; and between Red and White forces in Russia had created problems including disease, poverty, and famine. Assigned to provide dispatch service to support American Relief Committee efforts, and to protect American nationals and interests, Sands arrived at Allied-occupied istanbul on 11 November. Nine days later, she fueled at the Standard Oil docks at Selvi Bournu, then commenced her first cruise. Into late December, she steamed off Samsun and Trebizond, observing as Greeks were deported from those areas. After returning briefly to Istanbul, she steamed to Alexandretta, whence she continued on to Cilicia. There she called at Mersin, site of an American mission and relief distribution center, and remained through most of January 1922. On 3 February, she was back at Istanbul; and, on the 8th, she got underway for Novorossiysk. From the 8th to the 19th, she supported relief work in that city, then proceeded to Samsun where, with one interruption to retrieve a drifting barge near Inebole, she remained until 8 March. Two days later, she returned to Constantinople; and, on the 18th, she shifted to Selvi Bournu to assist in firefighting efforts in the oil storage area. With the fires under control, she put back into Istanbul and, on the 22d, got underway to again call at Mersin. By 7 April, she had retransited the Dardanelles and the Sea of Marmara. On 8 May, she passed through the Bosporus. From the 9th to the 22d, she was at Odessa, whence she shifted to Theodosia and then continued to Novorossisk. In early June, she was at Trabzon; and, on the 4th, she arrived at Samsun where, for several days, she steamed off the harbor entrance as Greek and Turkish forces exchanged fire. Sands returned to Istanbul on 9 July and soon afterward sailed for Gibraltar and the United States. From August into November, she underwent overhaul at Philadelphia. By late December, she had joined the Scouting Fleet at New York; and, on 3 January 1923, she departed from that city for winter maneuvers in the Caribbean. In February, she participated in Fleet Problem I, an exercise designed to test the defenses of the Panama Canal. During March and April, she conducted operations in the Greater Antilles; and, in May, she moved back to the east coast. In July, after overhaul, she headed north to the New England coast. In the autumn, she commenced operations off the mid-Atlantic seaboard; and, in January 1924, she again sailed south for winter maneuvers. =1930s= Through the decade and into the 1930s, Sands maintained a similar schedule. On 10 November 1930, however, after completing exercises off southern New England, she proceeded to Philadelphia, where she began inactivation. She was decommissioned on 13 February 1931 and was berthed at League Island until ordered activated in the summer of 1932. Recommissioned on 21 July, the destroyer moved to Norfolk, Virginia; and, in August, she sailed for the west coast. On 8 September, she arrived at her new base, San Diego, California, and commenced operations off the southern California coast. With the new year, 1933, she steamed to Hawaii for fleet exercises, and, in mid-February, returned to California. During the spring, she operated off the coast of Washington; and, in July, she resumed exercises out of San Diego. Three months later, she joined Rotating Destroyer Squadron 20 and remained in reserve through the winter. Activated in April 1934, she joined Destroyer Division 9 and got underway for the Caribbean and fleet exercises. By mid-November, she was back in southern California, where she remained, with one interruption ‚Äì Fleet Problem XVI in the North Pacific (May 1935) ‚Äì until April 1936. She then returned to the east coast; participated in exercises in the Caribbean and off New England; and steamed back to San Diego in October. For the next two years, she operated primarily in the southern California area, with exercises in the Hawaiian Islands during the spring and autumn of 1937 and the spring of 1938. On her return in April 1938, she operated locally into the summer, then prepared for inactivation. Sands was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 September 1938. Within a year, however, war broke out in Europe and the destroyer was ordered activated for Neutrality Patrol duty. Recommissioned on 26 September 1939, Sands departed the west coast on 13 November and, a little over a month later, took up patrol duty in the Caribbean. She remained there into the spring of 1940, then moved north for patrol and escort duty off the eastern seaboard from the Virginia Capes to the Maritime Provinces. Before the end of the year, she returned to the Pacific and resumed operations off California. =World War II= With the entry of the United States into World War II, Sands commenced coastal escort work, which continued into the spring of 1942. Then, as the Japanese moved into the western Aleutian Islands, she shifted to Alaska and, through the summer, escorted convoys and conducted patrols from the mainland to ports in the eastern Aleutians. By fall, the Allies were taking the offensive, and Sands was needed for a different mission. On 28 October, she sailed south. Two days later, she was redesignated APD-13; and, on 5 November, she arrived at San Francisco for conversion to a high speed transport. 1943 Townsville in May 1943. Sands departed from San Francisco on 21 December. Steaming west, she reached Pearl Harbor at the end of the year; conducted exercises into January 1943; and, on the 8th, resumed her Pacific crossing. On the 22d, she arrived at Espiritu Santo and, as a transport and as an escort, began moving reinforcements and supplies into the Guadalcanal-Tulagi area. On the 29th, she was detached from duties at Tulagi and ordered to accompany , toward Rennell Island to assist . Rendezvousing the next morning, the tug took the damaged cruiser in tow, and Sands joined Chicagos escort of five destroyers in a circular screen. The eight ships then began making their way to Tulagi. At 1620, the formation was attacked by Japanese torpedo planes. Navajo began evasive maneuvers. Antiaircraft guns on Sands and the destroyers were fired at the intruders, but Chicago was hit by another torpedo and, 20 minutes later, sank. Sands, with nine wounded by the explosion of a 20 millimeter shell, picked up over 300 survivors and steamed for Espiritu Santo. Arriving on 1 February, she conducted amphibious exercises from the 4th to the 10th; completed another escort run to Guadalcanal and back by the 14th; and, on the 15th, with more marines embarked, steamed back to the Solomon Islands. Five days later, she departed Tulagi; crossed over to Koli Point; and, on the 21st, moved on to the Russell Islands; that night, she landed her assault troops unopposed; then returned to Tulagi, from where she made two more transport runs to the assault area before the 26th. After the occupation of the Russells, Sands continued to carry troops and supplies and to escort convoys in the New Caledonia-New Hebrides-Solomons area. With spring, she was transferred to the 7th Amphibious Force. On 14 May, she departed the New Hebrides; and, on the 20th, she arrived at Townsville, Australia, with an LST convoy. Through the summer, she performed escort and patrol missions along the Queensland coast and completed numerous transport missions to move Allied forces up to, and along, the northern coast of the Papuan peninsula. By September, the forces were ready to move against Japanese positions on the Huon Peninsula and contest control of Vitiaz and Dampier Straits. On 2 September, Sands embarked units of the 9th Australian Division, veterans of the North African desert and, two days later, landed them east of Lae. On the 5th, she retired, returning a few days later to shell the Japanese garrison at Lae as Allied forces closed on that village from the jungle and from mangrove swamps. At mid-month, she resumed transport and escort duties along the coast; and, on the 22d, she landed troops just north of Finschhafen. Reinforcement- escort runs and amphibious exercises along the coast, from Port Moresby to the Huon Peninsula and between Papua and offshore islands, occupied October and November. In early December, at Goodenough Island, she loaded units of the 112th Cavalry Regiment for the assault on New Britain. On the 15th, she offloaded the troops into rubber landing boats which were to take them onto the Amalut Peninsula. The Japanese, however, opened fire before the boats reached the beach. Covering units, not knowing if the troops had landed, held their fire for fear of hitting the cavalrymen. Twelve of the 15 boats, riddled by Japanese fire, sank. Most surviving troops swam seaward. Sands and the escorting destroyer opened fire, silencing the coastal guns. The search for survivors began, and all but 16 were rescued. Eleven days later, Sands returned to New Britain for another assault landing. On the 26th, she landed marines on Cape Gloucester, provided gunfire support as they moved off the beaches, then retired to stage for her next target, Saidor. 1944 On 1 January 1944, the APD again departed Good-enough Island with assault troops embarked. A unit of Task Group 76.1, she transited Vitiaz Strait that night and, at 0735 on the 2nd, landed the troops on the beach at Saidor, 115 miles west of Finschhafen. By 0800, she was out of the transport area. In the afternoon, she returned to Buna roads and, until mid-month, made runs between there and Capes Cretin and Sudest. On the 18th, Sands arrived at Sydney for a brief respite. On the 28th, she got underway to return to New Guinea with cargo and personnel for Milne Bay, Buna, and Cape Sudest. From 6 to 24 February, she completed another run to Sydney; then, on the 27th, loaded troops at Cape Sudest for transport to the assault beaches at Los Negros Island, Admiralties. Sailing on the 29th, she crossed the Bismarck Sea; arrived off the assault area shortly after 0730 the next day; dispatched her loaded LCP(R)s to the departure line by 0742; then, as the first waves reached the shore, commenced gunfire support operations. At 0835, Sandss boats hit the beach with the 3rd assault wave. The intense crossfire which had caught earlier waves continued as they approached. Poor organization on the beach slowed offloading and assisted the accuracy of the Japanese defenders. Sands suffered two casualties, one killed, one seriously injured, from her boat crews and lost her no. 1 boat. In mid-afternoon, the APD departed the Los Negros-Manus area. Returning to Cape Sudest, she loaded much-needed reinforcements on 3 March and, the next day, disembarked them on the contested island and took on casualties. On the 5th, she was back at Cape Sudest, from where she resumed escort duty along the coast. In early April, Sands trained army units in amphibious exercises. On the 18th, she embarked units of the 162nd Infantry and got underway for Humboldt Bay. Steaming with TG 77.2, the Central Attack Group for the Hollandia operation, she arrived in the transport area early on the morning of the 22nd. At 0600, her boats were lowered and loaded. Five minutes later, they were en route to the departure line. At 0735, they returned and were hoisted on board. The APD then took up gunfire support duties. On the 24th, Sands returned to Cape Cretin, and from there proceeded to Cape Sudest for availability. In May, she resumed escort and transport runs but, at mid-month, interrupted them to return to California. After an overhaul at Alameda, Sands carried passengers to Pearl Harbor; embarked 126 men of the 81st Division Reconnaissance Company there, and arrived in the Solomons on 24 August to rehearse the Palau operation. Two weeks later, she steamed northwest, arriving in the transport area off Anguar Island on the 15th. Acting as reserve for the Peleliu Island assault, she remained off Anguar during the initial landings on the former island. At mid-morning, she shifted to Peleliu to support the forces ashore. On the 17th, she returned to Anguar and, on the 18th, landed the reconnaissance company on Red Beach. On the 19th, she went alongside ; embarked the 323nd Reconnaissance Company and then, with , proceeded to Ulithi. There until the 25th, she landed her troops without opposition, then got underway to return to Hollandia. Arriving on the 28th, she shifted to Manus on the 29th; equipped her boats with mine-sweeping gear, embarked minesweeping personnel, and, on 10 October, steamed for Leyte with units of Mine Squadron 2. Despite poor weather and two appendectomies which were performed aboard ship, Sands arrived in the approaches to Leyte Gulf on the 17th. On the 18th, she closed Suluan Island, took off reconnaissance troops landed previously by and transferred them to that ship. On the 19th, she moved up to the assault area and lowered her LCP(R)s to conduct shallow water minesweeping operations. From 1155 to 1410, she covered her boats as they swept the approaches to Red and White beaches near Tacloban. Straddled, but not hit, by Japanese batteries, the boats completed their mission and returned to the APD. Sands then shifted to the Dulag beaches, where her boats conducted further shallow water sweeps. During the night, Sands patrolled in Leyte Gulf. In the morning, she returned to the Tacloban area to provide gunfire support there. In the afternoon, she shifted to the Dulag area for the same purpose; and, on the 21st, she got underway to return to New Guinea. 1945 During November, the APD conducted a resupply and reinforcement run to Leyte and back, then prepared for the invasion of Luzon. On 27 December, she departed Hollandia for the Palaus and Leyte. On 2 January 1945, she cleared San Pedro Bay. On the 4th, Japanese aerial resistance began. The next day, her task group, 77.2, steamed up the Luzon coast. Land-based Japanese aircraft again attacked. On the 6th, the force arrived off Lingayen Gulf and, despite kamikaze accuracy; the ships entered the gulf and took up their stations. Sands, with other APDs, bombarded Santiago Island. On the 7th, she covered the YMSs as they conducted sweeps, and then closed Orange and Green beaches to cover underwater demolition teams as they removed obstacles from the landing area. On the 8th, she moved to the transport area where she remained, on patrol, until the 13th. She then got underway for Leyte and Ulithi. The APD arrived in the Western Carolines on the 24th and remained through February. On 1 March, she joined a convoy for Iwo Jima, arrived on the 3rd, patrolled through the 5th, and sailed for Saipan on the 6th, escorting retiring transports. From the Marianas, she sailed to the Solomons, New Caledonia, and the Admiralties, from where she returned to Ulithi to escort reinforcements to the Ryukyus. By mid-June, she had completed three runs to the Okinawa area and had begun her last Pacific crossing. On the 30th, she arrived at Pearl Harbor, and, on 11 July, she returned to San Diego. Sands remained on the west coast through the end of hostilities. On 29 August, she got underway for Philadelphia, where she was decommissioned on 10 October 1945. Struck from the Navy list on 1 November, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Metals Company the following spring. Awards Sands earned nine battle stars for her World War II service.

Liberal intergovernmentalism views states as the main actors, and sees the EU as an international institution that can be studied by viewing states as the main actors in a situation of anarchy, where each state achieves their goal through negotiations and bargaining. Liberal intergovernmentalism especially studies the process of these negotiations and bargaining between EU's member states.Cini M. & Perez N. (2015) European Union Politics. Oxford University Press. UK. Andrew Moravcsik in his book The Choice for Europe (1998) defines EU integration: \\"EU integration can best be understood as a series of rational choices made by national leaders. These choices responded to constraints and opportunities stemming from the economic interests relative power of powerful domestic constituents, the of states stemming from asymmetrical interdependence, and the role of institutions in bolstering the credibility of interstate commitments.\\"Moravcsik, A. (1998) The Choice for Europe. Social Purpose and State Power from Messina to Maastricht (Ithaca, NJ: Cornell University Press). Page 18. Liberal intergovernmentalism has demonstrated its usefulness with its methods of organizing and constructing empirical studies. However, liberal intergovernmentalism has also been heavily criticized.Cini M. & Perez N. (2015) European Union Politics. Oxford University Press. UK. A general criticism of liberal intergovernmentalism is that it focuses on the theory of grand bargaining and major decisions, and that it has no way of explaining everyday decision-making procedures. Many critics point out that liberal intergovernmentalism exclusively focuses on the treaty-amending moments and member-states economic interests, while it overlooks the everyday policy agendas that represent the majority of EU policies.Weiner A., Diez T. (2009) European Integration Theory. Oxford University Press. US. . Furthermore, Moravcsik's scholarship never put forward a detailed liberal intergovernmentalist account of the powers of the European Court of Justice, although a (modified) liberal intergovernmentalist account of European legal integration is certainly possible Phelan W.

It is generally considered a myth. Origins Like most folklore, it is impossible to trace the origins of keraunography. However, it seems to have attracted scientific and media attention in England in the early 19th century, and by Victorian times the term \\"keraunography\\" had been coined to describe numerous unconnected events. With increasing scientific understanding of electricity and the popularity of photography, the time was right in the 19th century for keraunography, which seems to combine both concepts, to enter the public consciousness. However, it is likely that anecdotal accounts of keraunography had existed long before there was a word for it. Relationship to other myths Lightning, being a dramatic and often-seen (yet mysterious and poorly understood) aspect of nature, has since ancient times been the subject of mythology and folklore regarding its origins, effects, and various ways to ward it off. As mentioned previously, the 19th century were a breeding ground for myths about electricity and photography. Sympsychography, by which brain waves are used to produce a photographic image, was a deliberate joke, but no less taken as truth by members of the public. Also possibly related to keraunography is the mistaken belief that the last image a dying person sees is burned into their retina, like a photograph taken at the time of death. Modern perception Although to some degree science has still not fully explained all the behaviours of lightning, very few people currently accept keraunography as truth. It is evident that lightning strikes do indeed produce burn marks, and like any basically random shape (clouds, birthmarks, inkblots, etc.) it is human nature to see shapes in them. The lightning often leaves skin marks in characteristic Lichtenberg figures, sometimes called lightning flowers; they may persist for hours or days, and are a useful indicator for medical examiners when trying to determine the cause of death. Although humans being struck by lightning is of course rare, it is nonetheless possible that over a wide period of time, certain cases of burn marks would exist which could be said to resemble objects nearby the point of the lightning strike. However, these cases are almost certainly the product of coincidence rather than evidence of any photographic property of lightning. No supposed case of keraunography has been investigated by modern science, and unless further evidence is presented, it remains a strange object of 19th-century British folklore.

In children, it is usually defined in terms of weight, and can be evaluated either by a low weight for the child's age, or by a low rate of increase in the weight. The term \\"failure to thrive\\" has been used vaguely and in different contexts to refer to different issues in pediatric growth. It is most commonly used to describe a failure to gain weight, but some providers have also used it to describe a failure to grow, or a failure to grow and to gain weight. As used by pediatricians, it covers poor physical growth of any cause. The term has been used in different ways, and different objective standards have been defined. FTT is suggested by a fall in one or more weight centile spaces on a World Health Organization (WHO) growth chart depending on birth weight or when weight is below the 2nd percentile of weight for age irrespective of birth weight. In children whose birth weight was between the 9th and 91st percentile FTT is indicated by a drop across 2 or more centile spaces. Weight loss after birth is normal and most babies return to their birth weight by three weeks of age. Clinical assessment for FTT is recommended for babies who lose more than 10% of their birth weight or do not return to their birth weight after three weeks. Failure to thrive is not a disease, but a sign of inadequate nutrition. In veterinary medicine it is also referred to as ill-thrift.  Signs and symptoms  Failure to thrive occurs in children whose nutritional intake is insufficient for supporting normal growth and weight gain. Failure to thrive typically presents before two years of age, when growth rates are highest. Parents may express concern about picky eating habits, poor weight gain, or smaller size compared relative to peers of similar age. Physicians often identify failure to thrive during routine office visits, when a child's growth parameters are not tracking appropriately on growth curves. Physicians look for many signs on physical exam that can indicate a potential cause of FTT. For example, findings such as scaling skin, spoon-shaped nails, cheilosis and neuropathy may indicate potential vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) has also been associated with FTT, and can present with characteristic findings including microcephaly, short palpebral fissures, a smooth philtrum and a thin vermillion border. Malabsorption, due to disorders like Crohn's disease and cystic fibrosis, can present with abdominal distention and hyperactive bowel sounds. It is also important to differentiate stunting from wasting, as they can indicate different causes of FTT. \\"Wasting\\" refers to a deceleration in stature more than 2 standard deviations from median weight-for-height, whereas \\"stunting\\" is a drop of more than 2 standard deviations from the median height-for-age. The characteristic pattern seen with children with inadequate nutritional intake is an initial deceleration in weight gain, followed several weeks to months later by a deceleration in stature, and finally a deceleration in head circumference. A decrease in length with a proportional drop in weight can be related to long-standing nutritional factors as well as genetic or endocrine causes. Head circumference, as well, can be an indicator for the etiology of FTT. If head circumference is affected initially in addition to weight or length, other factors are more likely causes than inadequate intake. Some of these include intrauterine infection, teratogens, and some congenital syndromes.  Cause  Traditionally, causes of FTT have been divided into endogenous and exogenous causes. These causes can be largely grouped into three categories: inadequate caloric intake, malabsorption/caloric retention defect, and increased metabolic demands. Initial investigation should consider prenatal history, postnatal history, past medical history, feeding history to assess overall caloric intake, developmental history, family history, and psychosocial history. ; Endogenous (or \\"organic\\"):Causes are due to physical or mental issues with the child itself. It can include various inborn errors of metabolism. Problems with the gastrointestinal system such as excessive gas and acid reflux are painful conditions which may make the child unwilling to take in sufficient nutrition. Cystic fibrosis, diarrhea, liver disease, anemia or iron deficiency, Crohn's disease, and coeliac disease make it more difficult for the body to absorb nutrition. Other causes include physical deformities such as cleft palate and tongue tie. Milk allergies can cause endogenous FTT. FAS has also been associated with failure to thrive. Also the metabolism may be raised by parasites, asthma, urinary tract infections, and other fever-inducing infections, hyperthyroidism or congenital heart disease, so that it becomes difficult to get in sufficient calories to meet the higher caloric demands. ; Exogenous (or \\"nonorganic\\"): Caused by caregiver's actions. Examples include physical inability to produce enough breastmilk, using only babies' cues to regulate breastfeeding so as to not offer a sufficient number of feeds (sleepy baby syndrome). A recent study on toddlers with exogenous FTT has found preliminary evidence suggesting that difficulty experienced during feeding times with this condition may in fact be impacted by preexisting sensory processing problems. Such difficulties with sensory processing are more commonly observed in toddlers who have a history of growth deficiency and feeding problems; however, further research is required in order to determine a causal relationship between sensory processing problems and nonorganic FTT. In developing countries, conflict settings and protracted emergencies, exogenous faltering may be caused by chronic food insecurity, lack of nutritional awareness, and other factors beyond the caregiver's control. As many as 90% of failure to thrive cases are non-organic. ; Mixed: However, to think of the terms as dichotomous can be misleading, since both endogenous and exogenous factors may co-exist. For instance a child who is not getting sufficient nutrition may act content so that caregivers do not offer feedings of sufficient frequency or volume, and a child with severe acid reflux who appears to be in pain while eating may make a caregiver hesitant to offer sufficient feedings. = Inadequate caloric intake = * Poverty/inadequate food supply ‚Äì number one risk factor for failure to thrive globally * Improper mixing of formula * Postpartum depression/maternal depression ‚Äì studies have shown that mothers with postpartum depression are at increased risk for experiencing breastfeeding difficulties * Child neglect ‚Äì prevalence of neglect in non-organic failure to thrive is estimated to be as high as 5‚Äì10% * Cleft lip and cleft palate ‚Äì impaired oral motor coordination/poor suck * Cerebral palsy/hypotonia * Gastroesophageal reflux disease ‚Äì symptoms of irritability, fussiness, and spitting up that occur shortly after feeding.

Next, a complete physical examination may be done, with special attention being paid to identifying possible organic sources of FTT. This could include looking for dysmorphic features, abnormal breathing sounds, and signs of specific vitamin and mineral deficiencies. The physical exam may also reveal signs of possible child neglect or abuse. Based on the information gained from the history and physical examination, a workup can then be conducted, in which possible sources of FTT can be further probed, through blood work, X-rays, or other tests. Laboratory workup should be directed by concerning history and physical examination findings, as it is estimated that the usefulness of laboratory investigations for children with failure to thrive is 1.4%. Initial bloodwork should be based on the clinical picture of the child. Common bloodwork should include a CBC with differential, a complete metabolic panel to look for electrolyte derangements, a thyroid function test, and a urinalysis. If indicated, anti-TTG IgA antibodies can be used to assess for Celiac's disease, and a sweat chloride test is used to screen for cystic fibrosis. If no cause is discovered, a stool examination could be indicated to look for fat or reducing substances. C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) can also be used look for signs of inflammation.  Treatment  Infants and children who have had unpleasant eating experiences (e.g. acid reflux or food intolerance) may be reluctant to eat their meals. Additionally, force feeding an infant or child can discourage proper self-feeding practices and in-turn cause undue stress on both the child and their parents. Psychosocial interventions can be targeted at encouraging the child to feed themselves during meals. Also, making mealtimes a positive, enjoyable experience through the use of positive reinforcement may improve eating habits in children who present with FTT. If behavioral issues persist and are affecting nutritional habits in children with FTT it is recommended that the child see a psychologist. If an underlying condition, such as inflammatory bowel disease, is identified as the cause of the child's failure to thrive then treatment is directed towards the underlying condition. Special care should be taken to avoid refeeding syndrome when initiating feeds in a malnourished patient. Refeeding syndrome is caused by a shift in fluid and electrolytes in a malnourished person as they receive artificial refeeding. It is potentially fatal, and can occur whether receiving enteral or parenteral nutrition. The most serious and common electrolyte abnormality is hypophosphatemia, although sodium abnormalities are common as well. It can also cause changes in glucose, protein, and fat metabolism. Incidence of refeeding syndrome is high, with one prospective cohort study showing 34% of ICU experienced hypophosphatemia soon after feeding was restarted.  Prognosis  Children with failure to thrive are at an increased risk for long-term growth, cognitive, and behavioral complications. Studies have shown that children with failure to thrive during infancy were shorter and lower weight at school-age than their peers. Failure to thrive may also result in children not achieving their growth potential, as estimated by mid-parental height. Longitudinal studies have also demonstrated lower IQs (3‚Äì5 points) and poorer arithmetic performance in children with a history failure to thrive, compared to peers receiving adequate nutrition as infants and toddlers. Early intervention and restoration of adequate nutrition has been shown to reduce the likelihood of long-term sequelae, however, studies have shown that failure to thrive may cause persistent behavioral problems, despite appropriate treatment.  Epidemiology  Failure to thrive is a common presenting problem in the pediatric population. Failure to thrive is very prevalent in the United States, representing 5‚Äì10% of children seen as outpatients by primary care physicians. Failure to thrive is more prevalent in children of lower socioeconomic status and is associated with lower parental education levels. Failure to thrive accounts for 3‚Äì5% of all hospital admissions for children under two years of age. Retrospective studies suggest that males are slightly more likely than females to be admitted to the hospital for failure to thrive (53.2% vs. 46.7%).  History  FTT was first introduced in the early 20th century to describe poor growth in orphan children but became associated with negative implications (such as maternal deprivation) that often incorrectly explained the underlying issues. Throughout the 20th century, FTT was expanded to include many different issues related to poor growth, which made it broadly applicable but non-specific. The current conceptualization of FTT acknowledges the complexity of faltering growth in children and has shed many of the negative stereotypes that plagued previous definitions.

Wallace, Mason Wiley, and Birnbach. It discusses an aspect of North American culture described as prepdom. In addition to insights on prep school and university life at socially acceptable schools, it illuminates many aspects of the conservative upper middle class, old money WASP society. Topics range from appropriate clothing for social events to choosing the correct college and major. The book addresses \\"preppy\\" life from birth to old age, lending understanding to the cultural aspects of \\"preppy\\" life. In general, elementary and secondary school, college, and the young adult years receive the most attention. Coverage lessens during the book's latter chapters. The book was first published in 1980 by Workman Publishing. The Official Preppy Handbook explains and satirizes what it takes to be a preppy person in the 1980s, parodying the lifestyle of the WASP elite. Birnbach reveals through an ironic tone where preps go to school, where they summer, what brands they wear, and how they decorate their homes. Birnbach divides The Official Preppy Handbook into 7 sections, each devoted to a different period of the preppy lifestyle. The Handbook begins by caricaturizing the childhood of a preppy person in 1980. Lisa Birnbach satirizes a prep‚Äôs ideal family lifestyle, and humorously advises readers how to pick, interview, and gain acceptance into a prep school. The book then wittily discusses ‚Äúthe best years of your life‚Äù- a prep‚Äôs college years. With tongue in cheek, Birnbach elucidates which college courses to take, how to design one‚Äôs dorm room, and how to party at college. In Chapters 5 and 6, the book explains the prep adult life as first a ‚Äúyoung executive‚Äù, and later as a retired adult in ‚Äúthe Country Club Years‚Äù. Birnbach jokingly educates readers on navigating a cocktail party, networking, and vacationing. The Official Preppy Handbook also teaches readers how to dress preppy. In chapter 4, Birnbach emphasizes the importance of appearing effortless, preppy and casual, writing, ‚Äúsocks are frequently not worn on sporting occasions or on social occasions for that matter. This provides a year round beachside look that is so desirable that comfort may be thrown aside‚Äù. By teaching readers on where to shop, what to wear, and ‚Äúthe merits of pink and green‚Äù, Birnbach makes preppy culture attainable to anyone ‚Äì contrary to the popular belief that one needs to be born into a preppy lifestyle, she makes prepdom something anyone can cultivate. Effect The book's reflections on young urban professional culture inspired Arthur Cinader, the founder of the J. Crew clothing line. Cinader hoped to capitalize on the book's success. The book also represented a resurgence of interest in preppy culture that aided the growth of retailer L.L. Bean, which the book describes as \\"nothing less than Prep mecca.\\" The book's expos√© of university life and the drug and sex culture at various schools had a significant impact on public thought about those schools. The book spawned many other \\"official\\" handbooks for other American subcultures. The Handbook exposed preppy culture to the masses, and helped to democratize the preppy subculture. Prior to the book, primarily only wealthy WASP elites adopted the preppy subculture. From the 1920s, WASPs dominated American universities, and preppy fashion was traditionally worn on university campuses. However, as universities became less exclusive as a result of economic and cultural shifts, preppiness as a subculture became less exclusive. Preppy fashion adopted new nuances, and preppy culture has become more inclusive. By writing The Official Preppy Handbook, Lisa Birnbach helped to further democratize preppy fashion and culture. Birnbach explained in her introduction that the handbook is not intended as an exclusive text describing preppiness as subculture reserved for ‚Äúan elite minority lucky enough to attend prestigious private schools‚Äù. Rather, the Handbook was written as a guidepost for the revival of the preppy style. It shared the secrets of the preppy code, making preppy seem ‚Äúneat, attractive, and suddenly attainable‚Äù.

Early life and education Newall resided in his family's Surrey home before leaving for Cairo upon his father's appointment as Air Officer Commanding Middle East. There he remained for four years, returning again to Surrey from 1935 to 1941, at which point he and his family were moved to New Zealand following Sir Cyril's appointment as Governor-General. Unlike the rest of his family, he only remained two years: in 1943, having matriculated at Eton, he returned home, residing there and with strangers and friends of his parents from then until the end of his father's term of office after the end of the war, in 1946. Military service Newall remained at Eton until 1948, when he volunteered for Army service and was accepted to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He remained there until successfully completing the course in the middle of 1950, at which point (following further gunnery training) he joined the 11th Hussars, then stationed with the British Army of the Rhine in Osnabr√ºck, Germany. He served there and at Wesendorf for three years, commanding an armoured cavalry troop and being promoted Lieutenant in 1952 before the 11th was transferred to British Malaya (now Singapore and peninsular Malaysia) in 1953 to combat the increasingly powerful Communist insurgency there (see Malayan Emergency). During his service there, he served in a variety of roles, including intelligence, domestic pacification, and aide-de-camp to General Sir Charles Loewen, Commander-in-Chief Far East Land Forces. In 1956 he was promoted Captain and returned to Britain as adjutant to the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars, and served in a variety of roles thereafter until his 1961 retirement following contraction of jaundice in Omagh, Northern Ireland. Business career At this point, Newall entered the business world. He joined Arthur Guinness & Son and subsequently helped found Harp Lager. During this time he acceded to the peerage following his father's death in 1963, assuming his seat in the House of Lords as the Lord Newall. He remained with Guinness until 1966, taking a position as public relations spokesmen for Schweppes USA, Ltd, during which time he took a home in Connecticut. He returned to the UK in 1972 as managing director for Neilson McCarthy Public Relations, a position he held until 1975. He has continued to be involved in business since, and presently serves as Chairman of Code Circus Ltd, a web application development company. At this time Lord Newall began to engage seriously in politics. He took his seat as a Conservative member of the Lords shortly following the return to power of Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, and served as an opposition spokesman and whip from 1976, his tenure ending upon the victory and accession to power of Margaret Thatcher. He continued dual involvement in both business and politics through 1983, at which time he entered continental politics as a delegate to the Council of Europe and Western European Union. He continued sitting in the Lords, holding his seat for a total of thirty-seven years and introducing six private members‚Äô bills ‚Äî four of which were passed ‚Äì as well as making hundreds of speeches. Since losing his seat on the expulsion of the hereditary peers in the House of Lords Act 1999 he has become Co-Chairman of the Hereditary Peerage Association. He has also acted as a representative of the British parliament and the WEU on several occasions: notably, during annual visits from 1986 through 1993 to Romania, which included private meetings with President Nicolae Ceau≈üescu and members of his government; and, more recently, in Azerbaijan. Lord Newall also takes active interests in both sports and charity work. He served for twelve years as chairman of the British Greyhound Racing Board and president of the World Greyhound Racing Association. He has been president of SPANA (Society for the Protection of Animals Abroad), chairman of the Lord Barnby Charitable Association and of the British Moroccan Society, and a committee member for the Not Forgotten Association, which works to provide services for disabled British servicepeople.

Issued on 23 August 1775, it declared elements of the American colonies in a state of \\"open and avowed rebellion\\". It ordered officials of the empire \\"to use their utmost endeavours to withstand and suppress such rebellion\\". The 1775 proclamation of rebellion also encouraged subjects throughout the empire, including those in Britain, to report anyone carrying on \\"traitorous correspondence\\" with the rebels to be punished.  Implementation  The Proclamation of Rebellion was drafted before Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth had been given a copy of the Second Continental Congress's Olive Branch Petition. Because King George III refused to receive the colonial petition, the Proclamation of Rebellion of 23 August 1775 effectively served as an answer to it.Pauline Maier, American Scripture (New York: Knopf, 1997), 24‚Äì25, 249‚Äì250. On 27 October, North's Cabinet expanded on the proclamation in the Speech from the Throne read by King George III at the opening of Parliament. The King's speech insisted that rebellion was being fomented by a \\"desperate conspiracy\\" of leaders whose claims of allegiance to the King were insincere; what the rebels really wanted, he said, was to create an \\"independent empire\\". The speech indicated that King George intended to deal with the crisis with armed force and was even considering \\"friendly offers of foreign assistance\\" to suppress the rebellion without pitting Briton against Briton. A pro- American minority of members within Parliament at the time warned the government was driving the colonists towards independence, something many colonial leaders insisted they did not desire.Maier, American Scripture, 25.  American response  On 6 December 1775, the Continental Congress issued a response to the Proclamation of Rebellion saying that, while they had always been loyal to the King, Parliament never had legitimate claim to authority over them, because the colonies were not democratically represented. Congress argued it was their duty to continue resisting Parliament's violations of the British Constitution, and that they would retaliate if any supporters in Great Britain were punished for \\"favouring, aiding, or abetting the cause of American liberty\\". America still hoped to avoid the \\"calamities\\" of a \\"civil war\\". The King's proclamation and the speech from the throne undermined moderates in Congress like John Dickinson, who had been arguing the King would find a way to resolve the dispute between colonies and Parliament. When it became clear George III was not inclined to act as a conciliator, attachment to empire was weakened, and a movement towards independence became a reality, culminating in America's Declaration of Independence on the 4th of July 1776.

It is her 17th studio album. The album won two Grammy Awards in 2001 for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album and Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s) for the song \\"Both Sides, Now\\" and a Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year. The album traces the progress of the modern relationship through Mitchell's orchestral renditions of classic jazz songs. Two of her own songs are included: \\"A Case of You\\" (1971) and \\"Both Sides, Now\\" (1969). The orchestra was arranged and conducted by Vince Mendoza. In the liner notes, co-producer Larry Klein describes the album as \\"a programmatic suite documenting a relationship from initial flirtation through optimistic consummation, metamorphosing into disillusionment, ironic despair, and finally resolving in the philosophical overview of acceptance and the probability of the cycle repeating itself\\". A limited run of copies was released on February 8, 2000, in chocolate box packaging for Valentine's Day with several lithographs of Mitchell paintings. A jewel-case edition was released on March 20, 2000. On tour, Mitchell performed the songs in the same sequence as the album, but she opened with the overture \\"Nuages\\", the first movement from Nocturnes, an orchestral suite composed by Claude Debussy. \\"Nuages\\" is the French word for \\"clouds\\". Although the music sets a romantic mood, the use of this piece can be seen as a pun since Clouds is the name of the album on which the song \\"Both Sides, Now\\" made its appearance.

She was named for Commander William Price Williamson. Williamson was laid down on 27 March 1919 and launched on 16 October 1919 by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, sponsored by Commander Williamson's widow, reclassified from Destroyer No. 244 to DD-244 in the Navy's fleet-wide assignment of alphanumeric hull numbers on 17 July 1920, and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 29 October 1920, Lieutenant Commander J. C. Cunningham in command. Service history =1920s= The new destroyer was partially fitted out at Philadelphia into mid-December. After calibrating compasses in Delaware Bay, she received the remainder of her torpedo equipment at the Naval Torpedo Station, Newport, Rhode Island, before her fitting-out was completed at the New York Navy Yard. Williamson departed New York on 3 January 1921, bound for Europe and, after proceeding via Bermuda, arrived at Brest, France, in company with , on 16 February. She remained in French and British waters - calling at Cherbourg, France; and Gravesend and Portsmouth, England - into the spring before sailing for the eastern Mediterranean on 23 May. Assigned to U.S. Naval Forces in Turkish waters, Williamson arrived at Ineboli (now Inebolu), Turkey, on 22 June. There, she landed passengers and investigated local political conditions. At intervals in the ensuing months, Williamson made cruises from Constantinople to Odessa, Russia; Ghelenjik Bay; Novorossiysk; and Theodosia, before returning to Constantinople. She made another cruise to Odessa on 22 June 1922, delivering passengers and serving for a time as station ship there. On 2 July, the destroyer departed that port, bound for Constantinople, and transferred stores en route to her relief, . Six days later, Williamson headed for Gibraltar on her way to the United States and arrived back at Philadelphia on 27 July. After joining the Atlantic Fleet at Hampton Roads, on 6 September, Williamson shifted to New York for exercises and gunnery drills before she returned to Hampton Roads on 28 September for further exercises off the Virginia Capes in the Southern Drill Grounds. The destroyer operated off the eastern seaboard and at Guant√°namo Bay, Cuba, participating in war games and routine battle practices into early 1923. She returned to the New York area in November of that year, engaging, at intervals, in more rehearsals and gunnery drills. She departed New York on 6 May 1924 for maneuvers with the Scouting Fleet. After returning to New York for voyage repairs, the destroyer sailed for the Southern Drill Grounds on 19 May and arrived at Hampton Roads on the 28th to conduct depth charge practices before she returned to Newport, Rhode Island to take part in high speed target and torpedo practice at the Naval Torpedo Station. Later, Williamson participated in the search for a life boat missing from the steamer and made a cruise to Guantanamo Bay in company with , , and before returning to New York on 8 December. Over the next few years, Williamsons routine remained fairly standard for vessels of her type in active service. She cruised off the east coast of the United States and into the Caribbean, operating at intervals out of Guantanamo Bay during the annual Fleet concentrations there. However, there were breaks in this routine. Although Williamson operated primarily with Destroyer Squadrons, Scouting Force, she spent a brief period in January and February 1927 in the Special Service Squadron operating off the east coast of Nicaragua during an outbreak of revolutionary violence. After returning to the New York Navy Yard on 30 June 1927, Williamson trained Naval Reserve units off the eastern seaboard. In 1928 it arrived in Havana harbour, as escort for USS Texas which had President Coolidge aboard as he was going to attend the Pan-American conference. Overhauled in the spring of 1928, the destroyer conducted additional reserve training cruises into 1930. Highlights in the ship's activities during that time were plane-guarding for in Guantanamo Bay in May 1930 and an extended reserve cruise that took her to Mayport, Florida, the Dry Tortugas, Key West, and Rebecca Shoals and Havana, Cuba. =1930s= Williamson continued operating off the East Coast into mid-1931 as part of Destroyer Division 9, Flotilla 1, Scouting Force, before she shifted to San Diego, California, in March 1932, to operate briefly off the West Coast in the spring before returning to the East Coast. Upon reaching Norfolk, Virginia on 17 December 1932, Williamson was placed in rotating reserve. She subsequently sailed on 1 July 1933 bound, via the Panama Canal Zone, for the West Coast; arriving at San Diego on 21 July, the ship plane-guarded for during the summer. Williamson returned to the East Coast in the spring of the following year and, in July 1934, was one of the escorts for while President Franklin D. Roosevelt was embarked in that heavy cruiser. The destroyer subsequently proceeded to the Washington Navy Yard on 19 July 1934. There, she received an early sonar installation before sailing for the West Coast, returning to San Diego in November. She later underwent a rotating reserve overhaul in the summer of 1935 before joining Destroyer Squadron 3. That summer, Williamson cruised to Alaska and, operating from Auke Bay, visited Portage Cove, Skagway, and Juneau, while patrolling coastal waters between 20 July and 31 July. Returning to San Diego on 9 August, Williamson conducted battle problems and local operations from that port with the other ships in her division into 1936. Sailing for Balboa on 9 May 1936 to participate in Fleet Problem XVII in June, Williamson later underwent an overhaul at the Norfolk Navy Yard. She subsequently operated in the Gulf of Mexico and proceeded thence via Mobile, Alabama, and the Panama Canal to San Diego, where she arrived on 30 October 1936. Williamson conducted local operations out of that port into the winter and plane-guarded for in February 1937, before shifting to Hawaiian waters in the spring. Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 25 April, Williamson operated in the Hawaiian Islands with other units of the Destroyer Force of the United States Fleet until she returned to the West Coast in June. She operated off the West Coast for the remainder of 1937 and returned to Pearl Harbor in January 1938 for an overhaul in the navy yard there. She then took part in Fleet Problem XIX and, upon the conclusion of those exercises, returned to San Diego on 28 April 1938. She then shifted to the East Coast, arriving at Philadelphia on 2 June for conversion to a new and special type of auxiliary vessel. With the increase in patrol plane forces in the Navy at that time, there arose in the Fleet's air wings an urgent need for tenders to support such aircraft. Accordingly, two flush-deck Clemson-class destroyers were chosen for conversion to light seaplane tenders: Williamson and . As the conversion work proceeded into the autumn, all torpedo gear was removed from both ships, as were two of each ship's 4-inch guns, the 3-inch antiaircraft gun, their depth charge tracks, and the forward two boilers. Additional deckhouse space was added forward. Internal arrangements were changed to accommodate the personnel of a 12-plane patrol plane (VP) squadron and a supply of aviation gasoline. A boat derrick was added to the existing searchlight tower structure to handle a pair of 30-foot motor launches to be used for tending the planes in the water. The ship retained her forward and aftermost 4-inch guns, and four .50-caliber machine guns were added for antiaircraft defense. As experimental vessels, Williamson and Childs ‚Äî simultaneously reclassified on 1 July 1938 to AVP-15 and AVP-14, respectively ‚Äî would soon prove successful. And, although more ships of their type were added to the Fleet prior to World War II, Williamson and Childs were the trailblazers. On the last day of 1938, the conversion was complete. Painted pale gray and wearing the hull number \\"15\\" and displaying the red-centered blue and white star which indicated her aviation affiliation, Williamson departed Philadelphia on 3 January 1939, bound for Norfolk. There she took on board men and material from Patrol Wing (PatWing) 5 and soon headed for the Florida Keys where she provided tender services to VP-15 before returning to Philadelphia on 11 March 1939 for a post-shakedown availability. After shifting briefly to Newport, Williamson sailed for the West Coast on 21 April. Proceeding via San Diego, the light seaplane tender made port at Seattle, Washington, and reported to Commander, PatWing 4 for temporary duty. She operated off the California coast from 26 May to 23 August before shifting to Kodiak, Alaska, to service two patrol squadrons, VP-41 and VP-42. While Williamson was tending PBY Catalinas in the Pacific Northwest, war broke out in Europe on 1 September 1939, when Germany invaded Poland. That autumn, Williamson operated out of Seattle and shifted to the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 5 February 1940 for an overhaul. She got underway for the Hawaiian Islands on 5 April and participated in Fleet Problem XXI before returning to Seattle on 21 May for a period of local operations and upkeep at Naval Air Station (NAS) Seattle. That summer, on 2 August 1940, she was again re-classified‚Äîthis time as AVD-2. On 4 March 1941, Williamson recovered three crew of a Douglas TBD-1 Devastator which ditched after engine failure, ~5 miles W of Mission Beach, California. The aviators successfully deployed a dinghy and were rescued after ~30 minutes by Williamson. This rare TBD was rediscovered in 1996, and in February 2011, the National Museum of Naval Aviation at NAS Pensacola, Florida, announced plans to recover and restore the rara avis. Before the entry of the United States into the war in December 1941, Williamson spent the last of her peacetime months engaged in valuable survey work between Acapulco, Mexico, and the Aleutian Islands. In the summer of 1941, the seaplane tenders and planes of PatWing 4, under the direction of Rear Admiral John S. McCain ‚Äî later to become the famed task force commander ‚Äî conducted an intensive survey of possible advance seaplane base sites in the Aleutians and along the Alaskan peninsula work that paid dividends within a year. =World War II= 7 December 1941, found Williamson under overhaul at the Puget Sound Navy Yard. After temporary duty with Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 82, she helped to escort into the Puget Sound Navy Yard on 30 December. The tender completed her repairs and took on stores in January 1942 and then shifted to the Aleutians to resume her duties as a tender for the PBY's of PatWing 4. 1942 During the early wartime period, the ship performed local escort missions and delivered war materials to Army and Navy bases at Cold Bay, Seattle, Dutch Harbor, and Kodiak. Williamson and her sister tenders also stocked emergency seaplane bases with vital necessities: buoys, gasoline, lubricating oil, ammunition, and bombs. Those temporary sites provided shelter for PBY's forced down by weather and proved valuable as alternate bases dispersed well enough to prevent a complete disaster if the Japanese attacked the established base sites. In addition, Williamson rescued and salvaged PBY's closed out of their havens by the \\"notorious Alaskan fog.\\" On 20 May, prior to the Japanese invasion of the Aleutians, Williamson rescued Brigadier General Simon Bolivar Buckner from Kiska, when the general and his party were stranded there by 60-knot winds that prevented seaplanes from taking off after completing an inspection tour of the Near and Rat Island groups. Early in June 1942, when the Japanese occupied Kiska and Attu in the Aleutians, as a diversion from the major Japanese thrust directed at the key atoll of Midway in the Central Pacific, Williamson lay at Umnak Pass, near the newly established Army airstrip there - the westernmost field in the Aleutian chain. Two Japanese planes from one of the carriers supporting the operation (either or ) strafed the ship and wounded six men. Fortunately, there were no fatalities. Williamson, in company with , later set up an advanced seaplane base at Chernofski and supported the PBY squadron assigned the mission of bombing the Japanese troops on Kiska Island until Army planes could take over the task. On 23 June, after having established the advanced site, the destroyer-seaplane tender left the Aleutians and steamed to Seattle for badly needed repairs. After returning to Dutch Harbor in August, she proceeded to sea on the 25th to attempt the rescue and salvage of a PBY down at sea in extremely rough weather. During the operation, Williamson was attempting to take the damaged Catalina in tow when a wave threw the PBY against one of the tender's propeller guards. The shock of the collision dislodged a pair of depth charges from the plane's wing shackles, and the resultant explosion wounded 16 men and blew one man over the side into the water. Efficient damage control, however, managed to localize the flooding aft, where the most severe damage was located. All hands bailed out the flooded spaces by an old-fashioned, but effective, method - the \\"bucket brigade.\\" While returning to Dutch Harbor, Williamson was shadowed by a Japanese patrol plane but made port without further incident. There, Seabees reinforced the damaged hull with \\"I\\" beams taken from a dismantled hangar. This enabled Williamson to creep back to Seattle on one engine at nine knots via Kodiak, Yakutat, and the scenic Alaskan Inside Passage. 1943 By the time Williamsons repairs had been completed, newer, more modern AVP's were entering the Fleet, and the need for Williamson's tending planes was lessening considerably. She was accordingly reclassified AVD-27 and, on 3 January 1943, was ordered to support the shakedown training of escort carriers. Williamson served as plane guard and escort for carriers operating in the Puget Sound and San Diego operating areas. Those carriers included , , , , , , , , , , , , and . During that time, Williamson picked 14 men from the water after accidental crashes. Relieved from that shakedown duty in the spring of 1943, Williamson supported the invasion and occupation of Kiska and Attu in April and May 1943. On 15 May 1943, four torpedo wakes passed close to the ship, her closest call of the campaign and, indeed, her last brush with the Japanese in the Aleutian theater. Returning to San Diego late in the spring of 1943, Williamson briefly trained with submarines and then resumed escorting and plane-guarding for carriers on their shakedown cruises. On 1 December 1943, Williamson was reclassified back to her original classification: DD-244. After repairs at the Mare Island Navy Yard in January 1944, Williamson sailed for the Hawaiian Islands on 24 January, arriving six days later. The destroyer departed Pearl Harbor on 7 February, bound for the South Pacific. She proceeded via American Samoa to Espiritu Santo and performed escort duties between Guadalcanal and Funafuti, in the Ellice Islands, until early April, when she joined Task Unit (TU) 34.6.4 for screening operations in the New Guinea area. Refueling areas included those between Truk, New Ireland, and the Admiralty Islands. Upon completion of that assignment, Williamson proceeded to Purvis Bay, Solomon Islands, where she reported to Commander, Group 3, 5th Amphibious Force (Rear Admiral Richard L. Conolly), on 7 May 1944. At that time, the erstwhile seaplane tender was again chosen for special duty. Gear was installed for underway fueling of scout observation planes from battleships and cruisers to enable the planes to spot gunfire for their parent ships without having to be recovered by them. Rehearsals in the Guadalcanal area proved that Williamsons new rig was suitable for fueling OS2U Kingfisher and SOC Seagull scout planes. With her new equipment thus tested, Williamson departed for Kwajalein, the final staging point for the Marianas operation, on 1 June. Nine days later, on the 10th, the destroyer got underway for the first operational test of the underway refueling concept which had been developed by Rear Admiral Walden L. Ainsworth. Upon her arrival at Saipan on 14 June, Williamson reported for duty to Admiral Ainsworth (Commander,Bombardment and Gunfire Support Force) and commenced refueling scout planes. Williamsons service enabled the ships on the bombardment lines to conduct almost uninterrupted gunfire support for the landings then in progress. On the 16th, she took up her duties fueling the spotter planes of the ships bombarding Japanese positions on Guam. Williamson soon returned to Saipan, however, as the approach of a Japanese Fleet made a consolidation of American forces desirable. The ensuing Battle of the Philippine Sea resulted in the withdrawal of the enemy force and freed the Americans to resume operations in the Marianas. On 17 June, while conducting screening duties, Williamson rescued a Japanese merchant seaman from the water two days after his ship had been sunk. After giving him a bath, medical attention, and food, Williamson transferred the man to . The destroyer departed Saipan on 25 June and arrived at Eniwetok on 3 July. Six days later, Williamson sailed once more for Guam and in ensuing days again operated as refueling unit for spotter planes during the invasion and occupation of Guam. Once the landings had been made, Williamson acted as a terminal vessel for mail and passenger seaplanes arriving from Eniwetok, until 16 August. During the Guam operation, Williamson had a brush with the Japanese when a shore battery near the town of Agat, on the west coast of the island, opened fire. However, as the ship's commanding officer reported, \\"getting underway and opening the range solved this problem.\\" Williamson departed Guam on 16 August and proceeded to Pearl Harbor, escorting a convoy. She was overhauled at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard before she operated as plane guard and carrier escort for Carrier Division 11. From the autumn of 1944 until 8 January 1945, the destroyer provided escort and plane guard services for , Saratoga, , Corregidor, and . During that time, Williamson rescued seven men while on plane guard station. 1945 On 10 January, Williamson joined the 5th Fleet and sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for the Carolines. After upkeep at Ulithi, Williamson took part in rehearsal operations at Saipan and Tinian for the impending invasion of Iwo Jima the target in the island-hopping campaign. Upon completion of those practice exercises in the Marianas, the Iwo Jima- bound task forces headed for their objective. Again, as at Saipan and Guam, Williamson performed her unique services for the bombardment phase of the Iwo Jima operation. In addition, she rescued the survivors of two carrier planes which had ditched nearby; provided medical and damage control assistance to a badly damaged LCI; rescued an LCM that had drifted 20 miles from Iwo Jima; kept watch on a damaged PBM Mariner (carrying members of the press) until the arrival of a seaplane tender group; and transferred one of her own crew to for an emergency appendectomy. With the completion of the bombardment phase on 26 February, Williamson headed for Saipan with a number of damaged landing craft. On some days making a \\"speed of advance\\" of only three knots to allow the landing craft to keep up, the destroyer ultimately reached her destination, where she parted company with the landing craft and proceeded independently to Ulithi where she prepared for the invasion of Okinawa. Reaching Okinawa on 25 March, Williamson operated as an antisubmarine screening vessel and spotting plane refueling unit with Fire Support Group 1. On the 28th, the destroyer rescued a fighter pilot whose aircraft had been damaged by antiaircraft fire and forced to ditch nearby. Once the invasion forces went ashore on 1 April, Williamson joined the Seaplane Base Unit in Kerama Retto and refueled ship- based, patrol, and transport float and seaplanes, as well as furnished aviation gasoline to battleship and cruiser aviation units. After three weeks in the forward area, during which time frequent air raid alerts became the routine, Williamson departed the Ry≈´ky≈´s and returned to Guam. She acted as a plane guard and an escort for carriers training in the Marianas. During that period, she made one escort trip to Ulithi and one to Leyte and Samar and provided her services to , , , , Velio, , , Makassar Strait, and Casablanca. While on plane guard station, she rescued three downed aviators. After operating in that capacity through the cessation of hostilities with Japan in mid-August 1945, Williamson headed via Pearl Harbor for the West Coast and arrived at San Diego on 25 September 1945. She transited the Panama Canal on 10 and 11 October and reached Philadelphia on the 16th. Decommissioned on 8 November 1945, the veteran destroyer was struck from the Navy List on 19 December 1945. Sold through the Navy Disposal Agency on 17 October 1946, her hulk was acquired by the North American Smelting Company, and removed from Navy custody on 30 October 1946. She was scrapped shortly thereafter. Awards Williamson earned four battle stars for her World War II service. As of 2012, no other ship has been named Williamson.

The sketch was originally broadcast as part of the television series and has subsequently been performed live by the group. It relies heavily on wordplay and dialogue, and has been used as an example of how language works. Plot After the episode's end credits have scrolled, a BBC voiceover announces that there will be \\"Five more minutes of Monty Python's Flying Circus.\\" In the ensuing sketch, an unnamed man portrayed by Michael Palin approaches a receptionist (Rita Davies) and says he would like to have an argument. She directs him to a Mr. Barnard (identified as Mr. Vibrating in episode transcripts), who occupies an office down the hall. Palin initially enters the wrong office, in which a man played by Graham Chapman hurls angry insults at him before clarifying that his office is dedicated to \\"abuse.\\" Even after sending Palin on his way, Chapman calls him a \\"stupid git.\\" Palin enters the next office, which contains Mr. Barnard/Vibrating, played by John Cleese. Palin asks if he is in the right office for an argument, to which Cleese responds that he has already told him he is. Palin disputes this, and the men begin an argumentative back-and-forth. Their exchange is a very shallow one, consisting mostly of petty and contradictory \\"is/isn't\\" responses, to the point that Palin feels he is not getting what he paid for. They then argue over the very definition of an argument until Cleese rings a bell and announces that Palin's paid time has concluded. Palin is dissatisfied, and tries to argue with Cleese over whether he really got as much time as he paid for, but Cleese insists he is not allowed to argue unless Palin pays for another session. When Palin finally relents and pays more money for additional arguing time, Cleese continues to insist he has not paid, and another argument breaks out over that issue. Palin believes he has caught Cleese in a contradiction‚Äîarguing without being paid‚Äîbut Cleese counters that he could be arguing in his spare time. Frustrated, Palin storms out of the room. The original broadcast version features Palin exploring other rooms in the clinic; he enters a room marked \\"Complaints\\" hoping to lodge a complaint, only to find that it is a complaint clinic in which Eric Idle is complaining about his shoes. The next office contains Terry Jones offering \\"being hit on the head lessons,\\" which a series of policemen interrupt as being too silly. Writing The sketch parodies modern consumer culture, implying that anything can be purchased, even absurd things such as arguing, abuse, or being hit over the head. The sketch was typical for Cleese's and Chapman's writing at the time, as it relied on verbal comedy. Python author Darl Larsen believes the sketch was influenced by music hall and radio comedy, particularly that of the Goons, and notes that there is little camera movement during the original television recording. One line in the middle of the sketch, \\"An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a definite proposition\\" was taken almost verbatim from the Oxford English Dictionary. Performances The sketch originally appeared in the 29th episode of the original television series, entitled \\"The Money Programme\\", and was released (in audio only) on the LP Monty Python's Previous Record, on Charisma Records in 1972. The sketch was subsequently performed live at the Hollywood Bowl in September 1980, which was filmed and released as Monty Python Live at the Hollywood Bowl. The sketch features the discussion with the receptionist (played here by Carol Cleveland), the abuse from Chapman, and most of the argument between Cleese and Palin. It is then ended abruptly by the entrance of Terry Gilliam, on wires, singing \\"I've Got Two Legs\\". A further live performance occurred in 1989 at the Secret Policeman's Ball, where Cleveland's and Chapman's roles were replaced by Dawn French and Chris Langham. This performance was subsequently released on DVD. The sketch was performed again in July 2014 during Monty Python Live (Mostly), with Terry Jones filling in for Chapman's role and Gilliam reprising \\"I've Got Two Legs\\". Cultural references The sketch has been frequently used as an example of how not to argue, because, as Palin's character notes, it contains little more than ad hominem attacks and contradiction, and does not contribute to critical thinking. It has also been described as a \\"classical case in point\\" of dialogue where two parties are unwilling to co-operate, and as an example of flawed logic, since Palin is attempting to argue that Cleese is not arguing with him. The text of the argument has been presented as a good example of the workings of English grammar, where sentences can be reduced to simple subject/verb pairs. It has been included as an example of analysing English in school textbooks. The sketch has become popular with philosophy students, who note that arguing is \\"all we are good at\\", and wonder about the intellectual exercise one could get from paying for a professional quality debate. The Python programming language has an internal-only module called \\"Argument Clinic\\" to pre-process Python files.https://docs.python.org/3/howto/clinic.htmlhttps://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0436/ See also *Ipse dixit References =Citations= =Sources= External links *Live performance at the Secret Policeman's Ball (from the official channel) *Transcription of the script Arguments Monty Python sketches 1972 in British television ","title":"Argument Clinic"},{"id":"1792950","text":"President Franklin D. Roosevelt announced the plan for a bill of social and economic rights in the State of the Union address of January 11, 1944. (filmed excerpt) The Second Bill of Rights was proposed by United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt during his State of the Union Address on Tuesday, January 11, 1944. In his address, Roosevelt suggested that the nation had come to recognise and should now implement, a second \\"bill of rights\\". Roosevelt argued that the \\"political rights\\" guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights had \\"proved inadequate to assure us equality in the pursuit of happiness\\". His remedy was to declare an \\"economic bill of rights\\" to guarantee these specific rights: * Employment (right to workThis \\"right to work\\" is not to be confused with the \\"right-to-work laws\\" to which this term usually alludes inside the United States.), food, clothing and leisure with enough income to support them * Farmers' rights to a fair income * Freedom from unfair competition and monopolies * Housing * Medical care * Social security * Education These rights have come to be known as economic rights. Roosevelt stated that having such rights would guarantee American security and that the United States' place in the world depended upon how far the rights had been carried into practice. This safety has been described as a state of physical welfare, as well as \\"economic security, social security, and moral security\\" by American legal scholar Cass Sunstein. The implementation of these ideals into a global context has been viewed as a continuation of the war effort, in which the success of these proposed values within the U.S were vital to securing global peace.  Background  In the runup to the Second World War, the United States had suffered through the Great Depression following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Roosevelt's election at the end of 1932 was based on a commitment to reform the economy and society through a \\"New Deal\\" program. The first indication of a commitment to government guarantees of social and economic rights came in an address to the Commonwealth Club on September 23, 1932 during his campaign. The speech was written with Adolf A. Berle, a professor of corporate law at Columbia University. A key passage read: Throughout Roosevelt's presidency, he returned to the same theme continually over the course of the New Deal. Also in the Atlantic Charter, an international commitment was made as the Allies thought about how to \\"win the peace\\" following victory in the Second World War. The U.S' commitment to non-interventionism in World War II ending with the 1941 Lend-Lease act, and later Pearl Harbour attacks resulted in the mobilisation of the war state. The generous terms of the act, in conjunction with the economic growth of the U.S were key in allowing the U.S to establish new global order with the help of Allied powers in the aftermath of war. This motivation to establish a new global order provided the infrastructure for the implementation of an international standard of human rights, seen with the Second Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Akira Iriye's proposition that the U.S desired to transform the post war Pacific after their own image is representative of the wider desire to raise global standards to that of the US, feeding into ideals of American Exceptionalism. The effect of wider democratisation and social reform is divulged upon in Francis Fukuyama's The End of History and the Last Man.  Roosevelt's speech  During Roosevelt's January 11, 1944 message to the Congress on the State of the Union, he said the following: Legacy The propositions made by Roosevelt have gone largely unfulfilled. An article featured in the Democratic Left academic journal titled \\"Corporations Are Destroying Our Economy, Our Environment, and Our Children's Future\\" provides insight onto how the significance of the bill is largely selective, and has been reduced through \\"unbridled capitalism\\". The commodification of education, health care and other areas fundamental to the realisation of Roosevelt's goals is described as being responsible for maintaining vast inequality pervasive within the U.S. This commodification could be representative of the prevalence of libertarian- ism as an ideology within the U.S. Prominent figures such as Friederich Hayek and Milton Friedman have become re-known for their aversion to increased government spending on social reform.  Found footage  Fireside chat on the State of the Union (January 11, 1944) Roosevelt presented the January 11, 1944 State of the Union address to the public on radio as a fireside chat from the White House: > Today I sent my Annual Message to the Congress, as required by the > Constitution. It has been my custom to deliver these Annual Messages in > person, and they have been broadcast to the Nation. I intended to follow > this same custom this year. But like a great many other people, I have had > the \\"flu\\", and although I am practically recovered, my doctor simply would > not let me leave the White House to go up to the Capitol. Only a few of the > newspapers of the United States can print the Message in full, and I am > anxious that the American people be given an opportunity to hear what I have > recommended to the Congress for this very fateful year in our history ‚Äî and > the reasons for those recommendations. Here is what I said ... He asked that newsreel cameras film the last portion of the address, concerning the Second Bill of Rights. This footage was believed lost until it was uncovered in 2008 in South Carolina by Michael Moore while researching the film Capitalism: A Love Story. The footage shows Roosevelt's Second Bill of Rights address in its entirety as well as a shot of the eight rights printed on a sheet of paper.

After World War I he served as the president of the St. John's Clinical Society and the Newfoundland Medical Association. Early life Cluny Macpherson was born in St. John's, Newfoundland to Campbell Macpherson and Emma Duder. He had a brother, Harold. Macpherson received his early education at Methodist College and at the McGill University Faculty of Medicine from 1897‚Äì1901 where he earned his degree in Medicine. He also volunteered with the Royal National Mission to Deep Sea Fishermen, which later became known as the Grenfell Mission. Macpherson began his medical career at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. In 1902 he returned to Newfoundland joining the Labrador Mission begun by Dr. Wilfred Grenfell and ran the hospital in Battle Harbour. Remaining there until 1904. He also served as a special constable and justice of the peace. Macpheron later became a director of the Newfoundland and the International Grenfell Associations. He later helped develop the Seamen's Institute (later called the King George V Institute), another Grenfell project. Returning to St. John's, Macpherson opened a private practice, and eventually became the leading practitioner in Newfoundland. Macpherson started the first St. John Ambulance Brigade in Newfoundland after working with the St. John Ambulance Association. The Brigade had three divisions in St. John's. When World War I broke out, members enlisted in the Newfoundland Regiment. Macpherson organized the volunteers into an Ambulance Unit, which continued throughout the war. World War I Macpherson in Egypt, September 1915 At the outset of World War I in August 1914 Macpherson was commissioned as a captain and Principal Medical Officer of the newly formed 1st Newfoundland Regiment. He served as the principal medical officer for the St. John Ambulance Brigade of the first Newfoundland Regiment during World War I. He saw on active service in Belgium and France, at Salonika and later at Gallipoli, and in Egypt. His work was mentioned in despatches twice. Cluny's gas mask, which came to be called the British Smoke Hood was used between June and September 1915, during which time some 2.5 million were produced The German army used poison gas for the first time against Allied troops at the Second Battle of Ypres, Belgium on April 22, 1915. As an immediate response, cotton wool wrapped in muslin was issued to the troops by 1 May and followed by the Black Veil Respirator, a cotton pad soaked in an absorbent solution which was secured over the mouth using black cotton veiling. Seeking to improve on the Black Veil respirator, Macpherson created a mask made of chemical absorbing fabric and which fitted over the entire head. A canvas hood treated with chlorine-absorbing chemicals, and fitted with a transparent mica eyepiece. Macpherson presented his idea to the War Office Anti-Gas Department on May 10, 1915, with prototypes being developed soon after. The design was adopted by the British Army and introduced as the British Smoke Hood in June 1915; Macpherson was appointed to the War Office Committee for Protection against Poisonous Gases. More elaborate sorbent compounds were added later to further iterations of his helmet (PH helmet), to defeat other respiratory poison gases used such as phosgene, diphosgene and chloropicrin. After suffering a war injury in Egypt, Macpherson returned to Newfoundland in October 1916. He served as the Director of Medical Services for the Militia. For his wartime services, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1918. He retired with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. Later life Following the war Macpherson had various medical roles including president of the St. John's Clinical Society and the Newfoundland Medical Association. In 1937 he was vice- president of the Newfoundland St. John Ambulance Association in 1937, and later became assistant commissioner of the St. John Ambulance Brigade overseas. Macpherson was also the Registrar of the Newfoundland Medical Board. During World War II he served in ship convoys in the North Atlantic. He was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 1st Company, Royal Canadian Army Medical Corps in 1957, and was awarded the Canadian Forces Decoration in 1964. At various times he was chairman of the Lunacy Commissioners, president of the St John Ambulance Council, and vice-president of the Newfoundland Division of the Canadian Red Cross Society. He was a member of the Medical Council of Canada from 1950 and its president in 1954‚Äì55. He was appointed a Knight of the British Order of St John of Jerusalem in 1913 and a Knight of Justice in 1955. He was chairman of the Clan Macpherson Association and president of its Canadian branch. Family Macpherson married Eleanora Barbara Macleod Thompson, daughter of William Macleod Thompson, of Northumberland County, Ontario on September 16, 1902. They had two children, Emma Allison (1903‚Äì1971) and Campbell Leonard (1907‚Äì1973). Eleanora was later created OBE and became a Dame of the Order of St John. She died in 1964. Their son, Campbell Leonard Macpherson (1907 ‚Äì 1973), became the third Lieutenant Governor of Newfoundland in 1957, and in 1965 served as president of the Macpherson family business, Royal Stores, Ltd., after the death of his uncle, Harold Macpherson (1884-1963), a breeder and world authority on Newfoundland dogs. Cluny Macpherson lived in St. John's until his death on November 16, 1966. The family home at 65 Rennie's Mill Road, where he served as secretary, treasurer and registrar for the Newfoundland Medical Society now has historic designation.

Benito de Soto was the most notorious of the last generation of pirates to plunder shipping in the Atlantic, one of those arising from the ending of the Napoleonic Wars. Turn to piracy De Soto served on a BrazilianPickering, David. \\"Pirates\\", p. 97. slave ship, the Defensor de Pedro. De Soto joined with the ship's mate and led a mutiny off the coast of Angola in 1827. When 18 of the crew declined to participate they were cast adrift off in an open boat. Having changed the name of the vessel from the Defensor de Pedro to the Burla Negra, de Soto crossed the Atlantic, where he sold stolen cargo of slaves in the Caribbean, and then sailed south, attacking English, American, Spanish and Portuguese ships along the South American coast. From 1830 the Burla Negra also ventured eastwards into the Atlantic to intercept vessels returning from India and the Far East. Atrocities He proved to be one of the most bloodthirsty pirates of any age, murdering crews who fell into his hands and sinking their ships. An illustration of the Burla Negra chasing the Morning Star The most infamous episode in de Soto's career came on 19 February 1828, when the Burla Negra happened upon the Morning Star en route from Ceylon to England. After killing some of the passengers and crew with cannon fire, de Soto murdered the captain and took possession of the ship. Many of the captured crew were killed, while women passengers were raped before de Soto's men locked them in the hold with the rest of the survivors. When de Soto heard that the survivors had been locked away and not murdered, he was furious, turned them around to try to find the sinking Morning Star to finish the job. He did not want any evidence of his guilt in the attack to reach the ears of the court. However, de Soto could not find the drifting Morning Star. Meanwhile, the imprisoned survivors had managed to escape and prevent the Morning Star from sinking. A passing merchant vessel rescued them the following day. According to Burla Negra crew member Nicholas Fernandez, \\"A few days after the capture and destruction of the English ship [Morning Star], we fell in with a richly laden American ship (the Topaz) bound from Calcutta to Boston, to the crew of which no more mercy was shewn than to that of the Morning Star - having laden our brig with a portion of the most valuable part of her cargo, the crew (with the exception of the captain and three hands, who were taken on board the brig) were all put to death, and the ship set on fire! and in a few days after, the captain and two of the three hands shared the fate of their companions! - we had now indeed from repeated instances, become so familiarized with the shedding of human blood, that the shrieks and groans of the devoted victims were about music to our ears! and the work of human butchery was performed as deliberately and with as much unconcern as the butcher would dispatch one of the brute animals of his flock!\\" By August of 1828 news spread in American papers about the murder of the Topaz crew. \\"The following is a list of the officers and crew of the ship Topaz of Boston, which vessel was taken by pirates, and destroyed, and the whole crew murdered.

Capture and death De Soto's crimes caught up with him after the Burla Negra struck a reef and was wrecked off Cadiz. He and his men headed for Gibraltar, but they were recognized and taken for trial in Cadiz. De Soto was hanged with his remaining crew.

Reception theory is generally referred to as audience reception in the analysis of communications models. In literary studies, reception theory originated from the work of Hans-Robert Jauss in the late 1960s, and the most influential work was produced during the 1970s and early 1980s in Germany and the US (Fortier 132), with some notable work done in other Western European countries. A form of reception theory has also been applied to the study of historiography. The cultural theorist Stuart Hall was one of the main proponents of reception theory, first developed in his 1973 essay 'Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'. His approach, called the encoding/decoding model of communication, is a form of textual analysis that focuses on the scope of \\"negotiation\\" and \\"opposition\\" by the audience. This means that a \\"text\\"‚Äîbe it a book, movie, or other creative work‚Äîis not simply passively accepted by the audience, but that the reader/viewer interprets the meanings of the text based on her or his individual cultural background and life experiences. In essence, the meaning of a text is not inherent within the text itself, but is created within the relationship between the text and the reader. Hall also developed a theory of encoding and decoding, Hall's theory, which focuses on the communication processes at play in texts that are in televisual form. Reception theory has since been extended to the spectators of performative events, focusing predominantly on the theatre. Susan Bennett is often credited with beginning this discourse. Reception theory has also been applied to the history and analysis of landscapes, through the work of the landscape historian John Dixon Hunt, as Hunt recognized that the survival of gardens and landscapes is largely related to their public reception. General A basic acceptance of the meaning of a specific text tends to occur when a group of readers have a shared cultural background and interpret the text in similar ways. It is likely that the less shared heritage a reader has with the artist, the less he or she will be able to recognise the artist's intended meaning, and it follows that if two readers have vastly different cultural and personal experiences, their reading of a text will vary greatly. Umberto Eco coined the term aberrant decoding to describe the case when the reader's interpretation differs from what the artist intended.  Landscape architecture  In literature, the interaction between text and reader occurs within a framework that controls and limits the interaction, through genre, tone, structure, and the social conditions of the reader and author, whereas in landscapes the interaction occurs through movement and viewing, framed by typology instead of genre and tone. Instead of an \\"implied reader\\", reception theory of landscapes assumes an \\"implied visitor\\", who is an abstracted concatenation of responses of many visitors at different times. The theory recognizes that there is no single reading of a landscape that fulfills its entire potential, and that it is important to examine the motives of visitors and the factors influencing their visits (whether they read guidebooks about the place before visiting, or had strong feelings about the place or the designer, for instance). One key difference between reception theory in literature and reception theory in landscape architecture is that while literary works are accessible only to the imagination, physical landscapes are accessible to the senses as well as to the imagination. Reception theoretical analysis of architecture differs from typical writing on the history and analysis of landscapes, which tends to focus on the intentions of the designers, the conditions leading to the creation of the design, and the building process. Reception theory also tends to de-emphasize commonly used terms of description like 'formal' and 'picturesque', unless those terms were known to have meaning to landscape visitors themselves. Reception history  According to Harold Marcuse,Harold Marcuse, University of California, Santa Barbara, Department of History Reception History: Definition and Quotations. reception history is \\"the history of the meanings that have been imputed to historical events. It traces the different ways in which participants, observers, historians and other retrospective interpreters have attempted to make sense of events both as they unfolded and over time since then, to make those events meaningful for the present in which they lived and live.\\" = Reception History and the Bible = One area of scholarship where reception history is being explored more deeply is the reception history of the Bible. In the context of the Bible, reception history comprises the manifold interpretations of the biblical text from the time that it was written until now. It aims to show how biblical interpretations have developed throughout the centuries. The field that predated the reception history of the Bible has been known as the ‚Äúhistory of interpretation‚Äù or ‚Äúhistory of exegesis.‚Äù The greatest difference between reception history and its predecessor approach is that reception history does not restrict its interpretations. It includes interpretations that are marginal and even unorthodox. Reception history does not restrict interpretations by medium either; it includes the use of art, music, poetry, and liturgy. In contrast, the history of interpretation is concerned with how biblical scholars have interpreted a text in only their commentaries and monographs. The reception of the Bible is founded on the interpretative framework of Hans-Georg Gadamer. Gadamer was concerned with displaying how all interpretive acts are contextualized. At the same time, however, Gadamer maintained the integrity of empirical knowledge. Gadamer saw the contextualized interpretation of scripture and the empirical knowledge about its development are best understood to be in a dialogical relationship with one another. In this sense, it is a diachronic approach to interpretation of the Bible. The individual contexts of interpreters in communication with the original text is the basis for reception history of the bible. One of the key issues surrounding biblical reception history is locating when it began. This issue is sometimes addressed by demarcating a shift from the original text and its reception. However, the distinction of an original text becomes difficult because of the various forms of the earlier biblical texts that were being used. Because of the various sources, traditions, and editions of the earliest biblical texts it is difficult to know what was considered original and was interpreted. Related to this issue of numerous source materials in biblical reception is the context of these source materials. If one wishes to try and read the original text, one is required to do so in its historical context lest it become detached and lose their meaning. The various contexts that are associated with each of the contributing texts does not allow for there to be a single context in which to read the text correctly. This again muddles the difference between original text and reception history of the Bible.

Located north of Lusaka, it stands on the Great North Road and is significant for the railway connection between Zambia Railways line from Kitwe to Lusaka and Livingstone and western terminal (New Kapiri Mposhi) of the Tanzania-Zambia Railway Authority from Dar es Salaam since 1976. History Geography The town lies in the middle of Zambia, next to the borders with Copperbelt Province. The homonym district borders with the ones of Chibombo, Chisamba, Kabwe, Luano, Masaiti, Mkushi, Mpongwe and Ngabwe. Furthur, geographically, Kapiri Mposhi is located in the Central Province north of the City of Lusaka. The district is approximately 60 km North of Kabwe and 140 km South of Ndola and is situated along the Great North Road. Kapiri Mposhi District covers an area measuring approximately 18,250 square kilometres. It is surrounded by 8 Districts, namely, Kabwe District to the South, Chisamba District to the South East, Luano District on the East and Mkushi District on the North East. Others are; Masaiti District on the North and Mpongwe District on the North West. Transport Kapiri Mposhi has two railways stations, a TAZARA Railway station that connects it to Dar-es-Salaam and a Zambia Railways stations that connects it to Lusaka and Livingstone. The TAZARA Railway station is considerably larger and more modern than the Zambia Railways station. Just north of the town, there is a major junction, with the road north to Mkushi, Serenje, and the Tanzanian border going north-eastwards, and the road to the Copperbelt heading to the north west. This, combined with the railway links, makes Kapiri Mposhi an important point in the regional freight network.

The festival, Kentucky's largest single annual event, first ran from 1935 to 1937, and restarted in 1956The Derby itself began in 1875 at Churchill Downs. and includes: * Thunder Over Louisville, the largest annual fireworks display in North America; * the Great Balloon Race; * The Great Steamboat Race, featuring the Belle of Louisville; * the Pegasus Parade, one of the largest parades in the United States; and * the Kentucky Derby Festival Marathon & miniMarathon. * the Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic History The Kentucky Derby Festival Association started the first week- long festival in 1935, including a parade, a riverfront regatta and an orchestral concert. The first director was Olympic gold medalist Arnold Jackson. In 1937, a Derby Festival king and queen were crowned, marking the start of this tradition. After the floods of 1937, the festival was discontinued and it was not until 1956 when the modern-day Kentucky Derby Festival was reborn. In 2020, the festival was cancelled due to COVID-19, the first such cancellation since 1938. Official events Events vary from year to year but always include numerous athletic events, including the miniMarathon and Marathon; concerts; fashion shows; wine tastings; luncheons and private parties ranging from backyard barbecues to lavish Derby Eve balls attended by entertainment stars, famed athletes and other persons of note. =The Royal Court= The Royal Court is among the oldest traditions of the Kentucky Derby Festival tradition, dating back to the 1950s by The Fillies, Inc. The Royal Court consists of a group of five young women chosen to preside over events related to the Kentucky Derby. These women officially represent both the Derby Festival and the city of Louisville. In January, a court of Derby Princesses is selected from a pool of more than 1000 applicants. Thirty finalists are selected and the pool is then reduced to five young women who make up the court. Criteria for the selection of the court members includes knowledge of the Derby Festival, poise, intelligence, personality, academic excellence and campus/community involvement. The court attends nearly 70 events during the two-week period leading up to the Kentucky Derby. The queen is selected by a spin of the wheel at the Annual Fillies Derby Ball. The festival saw this method of queen selections as the most fair way to select from their court and the tradition continues today. Each member of the court is awarded a $2000 scholarship, an entire wardrobe for the festival, VIP access to all events and a chauffeur for the entire two weeks of the official Kentucky Derby Festival. =Thunder Over Louisville= Fireworks at Thunder Over Louisville The festival's first major event is Thunder Over Louisville. Thunder kicks off with a day-long air show ranked as fifth-largest in the United States and the largest fireworks display in North America. The approximately 30 minute firework display begins at nightfall. Thunder Over Louisville's fireworks have been designed and performed by Zambelli Fireworks International since 1991. = Fest-a-Ville = During the festival, much of Waterfront Park is billed as \\"Fest-aVille\\". It hosts a number of events, including the Chow Wagon, rides, and concerts. = Poster = Each year, an official Derby Festival poster is unveiled and prints are sold to help finance festival events. Artists and photographers who have produced the prized posters include Peter Max and Michael Schwab. = Pegasus parade = The first event held by KDF was the 1956 Pegasus Parade. The parade is held annually on the Thursday before Derby. = Sports = Various sport competitions are held as part of the Festival. From 1973 to 2017, the Festival hosted the Kentucky Derby Festival Basketball Classic. Since 1974, a pro-am golf tournament has been held.  Races  The Great Balloon RaceA number of races take place in the festival. The Kentucky Derby Festival miniMarathon and Marathon occur the Saturday before the Kentucky Derby; USA Track and Field named the miniMarathon among the nation's top 50 races. The mini has been held since 1974. That same Saturday is typically also when the Great Balloon Race is held, the culmination of the hot air balloon-themed BalloonFest. Recognition is given to Louisville's restaurant employees with the Run for the Ros√©, where waiters and waitresses run an obstacle course while carrying trays of glasses filled with White Zinfandel Wine. Servers finishing with the best time and most wine remaining in the glasses win prizes. For the annual bed races, businesses create themed mobile beds that are paraded before being race on an indoor track with costumed employees. The Great Steamboat Race usually takes place in the week before Derby, where the Belle of Louisville typically takes on at least one challenger. = Miscellenous = Since 1997, a spelling bee has been held for the festival.  Pegasus pins  Since 1973, KDF has sold a plastic pin for the Kentucky Derby featuring a pegasus. The pin is used as proof of purchase for admission to a number of the KDF events. Derby cruising A controversial aspect of the Derby Festival is \\"Derby Cruising.\\" Though it is not an official or licensed event during Derby Festival, it takes place in the historically black areas of West Broadway on Derby day and the Friday before it. Cruising consists of motorcycles and cars (many elaborately modified) driving slowly down Broadway, pedestrians crowding the sidewalks, and several blocks closed for a festival with rides and street vendors. The gridlock associated with cruising made it difficult for police to respond to instances of violence during 2005 Derby cruising. In 2006, police made an effort to stop cruising, shutting down Broadway except to emergency vehicles, which resulted in suggestions of racial profiling and much public debate about the legitimacy of Broadway cruising as a free alternative to other festivities. In 2007, police announced similar plans, although slightly more of Broadway was to remain open, including access to Shawnee Park. The 2007 plan sparked a lawsuit by business owners and a civil rights foundation, claiming the shutdown of Broadway during Derby week violated their constitutional rights and cost them hundreds of thousands of dollars in business. A federal judge allowed the plans to proceed, citing concerns about \\"public safety and the free flow of traffic\\". In 2008, police again banned cruising, but with a new plan allowing traffic to flow but to have a high number of officers on hand to enforce the city's noise and cruising ordinances, the latter of which prevents vehicles from blocking a roadway. Police reported that arrests were down from 2007, although they did shut down a 10-block portion of Broadway for a short time on Derby evening after gridlock developed.

In contrast to laundry detergents, fabric softeners may be regarded as a kind of after-treatment laundry aid. A wrinkle releaser is a similar, more dilute preparation meant to be sprayed onto fabric directly.  Mechanism of action  Machine washing puts great mechanical stress on textiles, particularly natural fibers such as cotton and wool. The fibers at the fabric surface are squashed and frayed, and this condition hardens while drying the laundry in air, giving the laundry a harsh feel. Adding a liquid fabric softener to the final rinse (rinse-cycle softener) results in laundry that feels softer. In the US and UK laundry is mostly dried in mechanical dryers, and the tumbling of the laundry in the dryer has its own softening effect. Therefore, fabric softeners in the US and UK are used rather to impart antistatic properties and a pleasant smell to the laundry. Fabric softeners are usually either in the form of a liquid, which is added to the washing machine during the rinse cycle (either by the machine itself or through use of a dispensing ball); or as a dryer sheet which is added to the moist laundry at the beginning of the dryer cycle. Liquid fabric softeners can be added manually during the rinse cycle or automatically if the machine has a dispenser designed for this purpose. Fabric softeners coat the surface of a fabric with chemical compounds that are electrically charged, causing threads to \\"stand up\\" from the surface and thereby imparting a softer and fluffier texture. Cationic softeners bind by electrostatic attraction to the negatively charged groups on the surface of the fibers and neutralize their charge. The long aliphatic chains then line up towards the outside of the fiber, imparting lubricity. Fabric softeners impart antistatic properties to fabrics, and thus prevent the build-up of electrostatic charges on synthetic fibers, which in turn eliminates fabric cling during handling and wearing, crackling noises, and dust attraction. Also, fabric softeners make fabrics easier to iron and help reduce wrinkles in garments. In addition, they reduce drying times so that energy is saved when softened laundry is tumble- dried. Additionally, they can also impart a pleasant fragrance to the laundry.  Fabric softeners  Early cotton softeners were typically based on a water emulsion of soap and olive oil, corn oil, or tallow oil. Softening compounds differ in affinity to various fabrics. Some work better on cellulose-based fibers (i.e., cotton), others have higher affinity to hydrophobic materials like nylon, polyethylene terephthalate, polyacrylonitrile, etc. New silicone- based compounds, such as polydimethylsiloxane, work by lubricating the fibers. Manufacturers use derivatives with amine- or amide-containing functional groups as well. These groups improve the softener's binding to fabrics. As softeners are often hydrophobic, they commonly occur in the form of an emulsion. In the early formulations, manufactures used soaps as emulsifiers. The emulsions are usually opaque, milky fluids. However, there are also microemulsions, where the droplets of the hydrophobic phase are substantially smaller. Microemulsions provide the advantage of increased ability of smaller particles to penetrate into the fibers. Manufacturers often use a mixture of cationic and non-ionic surfactants as an emulsifier. Another approach is a polymeric network, an emulsion polymer. In addition to fabric softening chemicals, fabric softeners may include acids or bases to maintain optimal pH for absorption, silicone-based anti-foaming agents, emulsion stabilizers, fragrances, and colors. = Cationic fabric softeners = Rinse-cycle softeners usually contain cationic surfactants of the quaternary ammonium type as the main active ingredient. Cationic surfactants adhere well to natural fibers (wool, cotton), but less so to synthetic fibers. Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that the softener be added in the rinse cycle. Fabric softener reduces the absorbency of textiles, which adversely affects the function of towels and microfiber cloth. Formerly, the active material of most softeners in Europe, the United States, and Japan, was distearyldimethylammonium chloride (DSDMAC) or related quat salts. Due to their poor biodegradability, such tallow-derived compounds were replaced by the more labile ester-quats in the 1980s and 1990s. Conventional softeners, which contain 4‚Äì6% active material, have been partially replaced in many countries by softener concentrates having some 12‚Äì30 % active material. File:AltDiesterquatCl.pngDiethyl ester dimethyl ammonium chloride (DEEDMAC) File:Redrawn diesterquat salt (methanesulfonate anion) related to fabric softeners.pngTEAQ (triethanolamine quat) File:DiesterCl.pngHEQ (Hamburg esterquat) File:C18x2Me2Cl.pngDistearyldimethylammonium chloride (DSDMAC) = Anionic fabric softeners = Anionic softeners and antistatic agents can be, for example, salts of monoesters and diesters of phosphoric acid and the fatty alcohols. These are often used together with the conventional cationic softeners. Cationic softeners are incompatible with anionic surfactants in detergents because they combine with them to form a solid precipitate. This requires that they be added in the rinse cycle. Anionic softeners can combine with anionic surfactants directly. Other anionic softeners can be based on smectite clays. Some compounds, such as ethoxylated phosphate esters, have softening, anti-static, and surfactant properties.  Risks  As with soaps and detergents, fabric softeners may cause irritant dermatitis. Manufacturers produce some fabric softeners without dyes and perfumes to reduce the risk of skin irritation.

Static cling is the tendency for light objects to stick (cling) to other objects owing to static electricity. It is common in clothing, but occurs with other items, such as the tendency of dust to be attracted to, and stick to, plastic items. Cause and prevention In clothing, static cling occurs from static electricity. An electrostatic charge builds up on clothes due to the triboelectric effect when pieces of fabric rub against each other, as happens particularly in a clothes dryer. The separate positive and negatively charged surfaces attract each other. It is especially noticeable when humidity is low, allowing static electricity to build up. Certain substances can reduce static cling and are often included in fabric softener and dryer sheets. Antistatic agents, which make the surfaces slightly conductive, can be used on fabrics. =Electronic devices= Dust accumulation caused by static cling is a significant issue for computers and other electronic devices with heat generating components that need to be cooled by airflow. Dust is carried into the computer by the airflow created by case- and component fans. The accumulated dust covers metal surfaces and clogs the empty space between the fins of heatsinks, diminishing the dissipation of heat and interrupting the outward flow of warm air. Especially for critical components such as microprocessors and memory banks, this raises the risk of them overheating which can ultimately damage or destroy them. To compensate, automatically controlled fans will raise their speed, generating more noise and shortening their lifespan. An additional risk is the (small) electrical conductivity of dust which, given enough accumulation of dust, can cause critical damage to the device's internal components. Dust accumulation grows exponentially, since the accumulated dust creates new static surfaces and physical blockades for new dust to cling to. In advertising Advertisers in urban areas, eager to use guerilla marketing techniques, have turned to static cling as a distribution medium. In an advertising campaign for Microsoft's MSN 8 Internet service, on October 24, 2002, hundreds of decals of the MSN butterfly logo were affixed to surfaces in New York City and the New York Times reported that it was static cling that held them there,Dunlap, David W. \\"City Officials Tell Microsoft to Get Its Butterfly Decals Out of Town.\\" The New York Times. 2002-10-25. however it's more likely that the decals used are of the type held by surface tension against smooth surfaces like glass windows.

Origin The story is best known through the Brothers Grimm' rendition. The Grimm Brothers included it in their 1812 edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen, but there is an older moralistic version in the Grimms‚Äô handwritten √ñlenberg Manuscript from 1810. Jack Zipes noted in 2016 that the Grimms greatly treasured this tale, considering it to be one of the \\"oldest and most beautiful in German-speaking regions.\\" It has been postulated that parts may extend back until at least Roman times; an aspect of the story is referred to in Petronius's Satyricon, in which the character Trimalchio remarks that, \\"qui fuit rana nunc est rex\\" (\\"The man who was once a frog is now a king.\\"). Other scholars, however, argue that this may actually be a jab at the emperor Nero, who was often mockingly compared to a frog. Folkorist Stith Thompson suggests that the story of the Frog King in the German tradition began with a 13th century literary tale written in Latin.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. pp. 101-102, 179.  Plot  In the tale, a spoiled princess reluctantly befriends the Frog Prince, whom she met after dropping a gold ball into a pond, and he retrieves it for her in exchange for her friendship. The Frog Prince magically transforms into a handsome prince. In the original Grimm version of the story, the frog's spell was broken when the princess threw it against the wall, while in modern versions the transformation is triggered by the princess kissing the frog.Heidi Anne Heiner,\\"The Annotated Frog King\\" In other early versions, it was sufficient for the frog to spend the night on the princess' pillow.Thompson, Stith. The Folktale. University of California Press. 1977. p. 102. The frog prince also has a loyal servant named Henry (or Harry) who had three iron bands affixed around his heart to prevent it from breaking in his sadness over his master's curse. When the frog prince transforms into his human form Henry's overwhelming happiness causes all three bands to break, freeing his heart from its bonds.Lily Owens, ed. (1981).

Prince Ivan Tsarevitch discovers the enchanted female frog, who becomes Vasilisa the Wise, a sorceress. A possible parallel in Antiquity may be found in the story of Danaid Amymone, who went to fetch water in a jug, because of a drought season created by the gods. A satyr tried to force himself on her, but maritime deity Poseidon rescued her. It has been suggested that the amphibian suitor and the handsome prince may have been separate characters at first.Anderson, Graham. Fairytale in the Ancient World. Routledge. 2000. pp. 176-178.

Early life Egan was born in Coburg, Victoria, moving to the Northern Territory in 1949 at the age of 16 in search of work and adventure. In his early career with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs he was mainly in the bush and engaged in jobs such as stockwork and crocodile hunting while employed as a patrol officer and reserve superintendent. Later he was a teacher at bush schools. He was a member of the first National Reconciliation Council. Egan was the sole teacher at the Newcastle Waters Station in 1965 and was stranded at the property for six weeks when the creek flooded. During this time no supplies were able to be delivered so Egan had to hunt for animals, such as bush turkey for food. He later returned to the station in 2012 for the book launch of Middle of Everywhere about life in the area.  Music career  Egan began recording in 1969 with \\"Drinkers of the Northern Territory\\" and has released 28 albums, mostly themed around outback life, history and Aboriginal people. Egan wrote the \\"Gurindji Blues\\" in the 1969 with Vincent Lingiari, during the Wave Hill walk-off. Egan says he was moved to write \\"Gurindji Blues\\" after he heard Peter Nixon, then Minister for the Interior, say in parliament that if the Gurindji wanted land, they should save up and buy it, like any other Australian. Nixon also gets a mention in the song: In 1971 the song was recorded by in Sydney, with Egan singing along with Galarrwuy Yunupingu, a Yolngu man actively involved in land rights for his own people through the Yirrkala bark petitions and Gove land rights case (who also sings on the B-side). Lingiari speaks the introduction, first in Gurindji and then in English. His choice of instrument is an empty beer carton (aka Fosterphone or Victorphone) played by tapping with his hands and fingers. He has been a prolific writer and performer of contemporary folk songs.

Complex sales involve long sales cycles with multiple decision makers. Multiple stakeholders and stakeholder groups contribute to every complex sale. Description Any product or service may become a complex sale. In some instances, a complex sale occurs when the market is mature and the stakes are high enough to warrant attention from a variety of stakeholders in the buying organization. In other instances a complex sales process is needed when the buyer has never had experience with the vendor, technology being sold, or if the solution is business critical or impacts the buying organization on a strategic level. The series of filters, purchasing steps, and stakeholders involved are designed to reduce the risks associated with making the wrong buying decision. Often the need to have multiple stakeholders or buyers involved relates to the level of risk that is involved in the purchase or sale of goods and/or services. As the buyer or buying organization if the purchase only impacts a small group of people or component of the buying organization then often the decision is made by one buyer and the process tends to be quite transactional. If the purchase impacts the entire organization, affects the company strategically, or can change the buyer business process then often the sales person is required to have a set of skills that are more in line with a subject matter expert or consultant than a traditional sales person. This type of sales person can often be referred to as a Key Account Executive or Complex Sales Executive. Large or complex sales opportunities that are international in nature require an additional set of personal and sales skills. The need for cross-cultural awareness may add an additional layer of complexity in the sales process. The larger the purchase and the buyer risk the more trust and credibility required from the Vendor. As a Key Account Executive or Complex Sales Executive in addition to product knowledge and consultative selling skills top producing sales executives also have the ability to build strong client relationships and navigate and avoid the political pitfalls within client organizations. Forms of complex sales * Selling consulting engineering services * Facility Management bids including provision of soft and hard FM services * Enterprise technology sales such as CRM or POS solutions * Private data networks such as MPLS * Commercial insurance sales * Real Estate development * Large fleet vehicle sales * Mining equipment sales (e.g. Caterpillar tractors and large tunnel boring machines) * Scientific Solution Sales (Data analysis and management) * Government acquisition such as for military hardware and services * Building management systems * Security systems Sales controlling Due to the high costs of proposals in complex sales the hit rate i.e. the percentage of successful offers is a valuable indicator of the performance of the sales force. Limitation of complex sales By analysing the characteristics of 'stellar performers', Dixon and Adamson argued that building strong personal and professional relationships and advocates among customers was no longer the most important success factor for selling. On the contrary, nearly 40% of 'stellar performer's were sellers who pushed their thinking and were not afraid to share even controversial views with both their customers and bosses.Dixon, M and Adamson, B.

It is a classical type of organic acidemia. Symptoms and signs A characteristic feature of isovaleric acidemia is a distinctive odor of sweaty feet. This odor is caused by the buildup of a compound called isovaleric acid in affected individuals. In about half of cases, the signs and symptoms of this disorder become apparent within a few days after birth and include poor feeding, vomiting, seizures, and lack of energy that can progress to coma. These medical problems are typically severe and can be life-threatening. In the other half of cases, the signs and symptoms of the disorder appear during childhood and may come and go over time. They are often triggered by an infection or by eating an increased amount of protein-rich foods. Genetics Isovaleric acidemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. The disorder has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene - one from each parent - must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder. Mutations in both copies of the IVD gene result in isovaleric acidemia. Pathophysiology The enzyme encoded by IVD, isovaleric acid-CoA dehydrogenase (), plays an essential role in breaking down proteins from the diet. Specifically, the enzyme is responsible for the third step in processing leucine, an essential amino acid. If a mutation in the IVD gene reduces or eliminates the activity of this enzyme, the body is unable to break down leucine properly. As a result, isovaleric acid and related compounds build up to toxic levels, damaging the brain and nervous system. Diagnosis The urine of newborns can be screened for isovaleric acidemia using mass spectrometry, allowing for early diagnosis. Elevations of isovalerylglycine in urine and of isovalerylcarnitine in plasma are found. Screening On 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including isovaleric acidemia. Treatment Treatment consists of dietary protein restriction, particularly leucine. During acute episodes, glycine is sometimes given, which conjugates with isovalerate forming isovalerylglycine, or carnitine which has a similar effect. Elevated 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid is a clinical biomarker of biotin deficiency. Without biotin, leucine and isoleucine cannot be metabolized normally and results in elevated synthesis of isovaleric acid and consequently 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, isovalerylglycine, and other isovaleric acid metabolites as well. Elevated serum 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid concentrations can be caused by supplementation with 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, genetic conditions, or dietary deficiency of biotin. Some patients with isovaleric acidemia may benefit from supplemental biotin.http://www.ommbid.com/OMMBID/the_online_metabolic_and_molecular_bases_of_inherited_disease/b/abstract/part9/ch93 Biotin deficiency on its own can have severe physiological and cognitive consequences that closely resemble symptoms of organic acidemias.  Prognosis  A 2011 review of 176 cases found that diagnoses made early in life (within a few days of birth) were associated with more severe disease and a mortality of 33%. Children diagnosed later, and who had milder symptoms, showed a lower mortality rate of ~3%. Epidemiology Isovaleric acidemia is estimated to affect at least 1 in 250,000 births in the United States.

In the law of the United States, appellate courts remand cases to district courts for actions such as a new trial. Federal appellate courts, including the Supreme Court, have the power to \\"remand [a] cause and ... require such further proceedings to be had as may be just under the circumstances.\\". This includes the power to make summary \\"grant, vacate and remand\\" (GVR) orders.Lawrence v. Chater, (per curiam), p. 166. Appellate courts remand cases whose outcome they are unable to finally determine. For example, cases may be remanded when the appellate court decides that the trial judge committed a procedural error, excluded admissible evidence, or ruled improperly on a motion. In common law jurisdictions, remand refers to the adjournment (continuance) of criminal proceedings, when the accused is either remanded in custody or on bail. Appellate courts are said to remit matters to lower courts for further consideration. Details When the United States Supreme Court grants certiorari and reverses a decision of a state supreme court or a Federal appeals court, it may remand the case. Likewise, an appeals court may remand a case to a trial court. A remand may be a full remand, essentially ordering an entirely new trial; when an appellate court grants a full remand, the lower court's decision is \\"reversed and remanded.\\" Alternatively, it may be \\"with instructions\\" specifying, for example, that the lower court must use a different legal standard when considering facts already entered at trial. A partial remand occurs when an appellate court affirms a conviction while directing the lower court to revisit the sentencing phase of the trial. Finally, it may remand a case upon concluding that the lower court made a mistake and also did not adjudicate issues that must be considered. A federal court may also remand when a civil case is filed in a state court and the defendant removes the case to the local federal district court. If the federal court decides that the case was not one in which removal was permissible, it may remand the case to state court. Here, the federal court is not an appellate court as in the case above, and the case was remanded because the removal to the federal court was improper. In federal tribunals in the United States, it is possible for an Article III court to remand a case to an Article I court, if the case was originally decided by the Article I court and then appealed to the Article III court,Examples: - and -, pertaining to the remand of cases from the United States Federal courts to the Social Security Administration's Office of Disability Adjudication and Review. or for a higher-level administrative tribunal within an executive agency to remand a case to a lower-level tribunal within the same agency.Examples: and , pertaining to the remand of cases from the Appeals Council in the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review of the Social Security Administration to an administrative law judge of the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review in the Social Security Administration. While Article III courts are allowed to remand a case back to Article I courts, there is a recent trend towards divesting U.S. magistrate judges from the power to remand cases back to state court. The same statutory basis for divesting magistrate judges of their power to remand may logically be applied to Article I judges.

Dick. It was first broadcast in 1999 on the Canadian television channel CHCH-TV and later the same year on the American Showtime channel. It was later syndicated in the United States with some editing to remove scenes of nudity, violence and (in most cases) strong language. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario. It was a Canadian/German co-production. Only one season, consisting of 22 episodes, was produced. Production Total Recall 2070 was created by Art Monterastelli. The series is named after the 1990 film Total Recall, loosely based on Philip K. Dick's short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale\\", but it has been noted as sharing no major plot points or characters with it, other than the Rekall company and the concept of virtual vacations.http://retrophaseshift.com/2015/01/12/obscure-sf-primer- total-recall-2070/ Instead, a much larger influence in its plot elements and especially visual style has been recognized to be the 1982 film Blade Runner, itself a loose adaptation of Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?. Series creator Art Monterastelli has admitted the stronger influence of Blade Runner over Total Recall, and explained, he thought doing a paranoid psychological thriller with a strong visual background reminiscent of Blade Runner, would be a better use of their limited budget, provide more creative opportunities to the writers, and even be more in line with the spirit of Dick's antihero storylines as found in his body of work, compared to the Total Recall action film. Despite the influence of his works to the series production, Dick is not credited on the series main or end titles. Most of this series was filmed at the Downsview Park studio, at the location of a former Canadian Forces Base in north Toronto. The series futuristic cityscape was created by John Gajdecki and his company Gajdecki Visual Effects, blending computer-generated images with a live-action soundstage set. Two or three levels of entire futuristic environment were constructed for the production and later mixed with the CGI. Story Total Recall 2070 takes place in a dark, crowded, industrial and cosmopolitan setting, with a noir sci-fi aesthetic. The government bureaucracy is heavily influenced by a small number of extremely powerful companies called \\"the Consortium\\" (including computer memory and virtual-reality vacation provider Rekall and android manufacturer Uber Braun). David Hume is a senior detective for the Citizens Protection Bureau (CPB), a police agency focused on general public safety. After his partner is killed by self-aware androids, he is partnered against his wishes with Ian Farve, a naive officer new to the department, who is himself secretly an \\"Alpha Class\\" android‚Äîa model with a more complex psychological nature. Hume and the CPB often have conflicts with the Assessor's Office (the investigative agency that has sole jurisdiction over crimes related to the Consortium) and with the private security forces of Consortium companies. The main story arcs of the series concern the agendas of the Consortium, the mystery of Farve's origins, Hume's wife Olivia, whose memories have been tampered with, and the mysterious manufacturer of Alpha Class androids. Significant plot elements remain unresolved by the end of the series run, due to cancellation; a crucial story arc from the series was the suggestion that the memory expansion used on self-aware androids was part non-human DNA and that a material found by a remote base on Mars could create a hybrid of human and android DNA. =Main characters= * Michael Easton as David Hume: A CPB Detective whose original partner was killed by rogue androids. His initial highly antagonistic attitude towards androids changes once he gets to know his new partner. * Karl Pruner as Ian Farve: Hume's android partner. Farve is an Alpha-class prototype android, an advanced model based on synthetic cloning technology. Farve is polite and very formal. * Cynthia Preston as Olivia Hume: Hume's wife. In the episode \\"Paranoid\\", she discovers that false memories were implanted on her before she met her husband, which leads to their separation. * Michael Anthony Rawlins as Martin Ehrenthal: Hume's superior at the CPB. * Judith Krant as Olan Chang: CPB forensic pathologist and computer specialist. * Matthew Bennett as James Calley: A representative for the Assessors Office (a more invasive future version of Internal Affairs), who often butts heads with Hume and Farve. =The Consortium= Company Logos for Minacon and Uber Braun By the year 2070, Earth and Mars (as well as space stations) are ruled by a unified government known as the Interplanetary Council (IPC). However, much of the real power is held by the Consortium, composed of at least six multi-global companies that financed the colonization of Mars. The known six companies are: * Rekall, the information technology powerhouse of the 21st century. Rekall also provides the Operating Systems for the Androids manufactured by Uber Braun. * Minacon, the energy supply company, provides both the oil on Earth and the deuterium on Mars. * Tashimo-Pacific, the transport company, created \\"Johnny Cab.\\" * Uber Braun, the rocket and robotics corporation, build the service androids. * Variable Dynamics, the medical and bio-tech company, is interested in creating synthetic humans. * Tillman Heath advertising boards are around the city in the series. Tillman Heath is the agriculture and chemicals giant but its real purpose was not unveiled in the 1st series. Its slogan is \\"Bringing the world's food supply to you.\\" Episode list Distribution =DVD releases= In 1999, the complete series was released on DVD in Japan (in English and dubbed in Japanese). The 2-hour series pilot (\\"Machine Dreams\\") has been available on region 1 DVD and VHS (Canada and the United States) since 2000. The series was broadcasting in Italy as of 2010 on Fantasy channel (Sky pay-TV), dubbed in Italian language.

The text is published in Acta Apostolicae Sedis, 1974, pages 89‚Äì92.The text can also be found, accompanied by an Italian translation, in Enchiridion Vaticanum 5 (Centro Editoriale Dehoniano, Bologna, Italy 1979). Its applicability in cases of accusations and trials involving abuse of minors or vulnerable persons and in cases of possession of child pornography by clerics was removed on 17 December 2019.Hannah Brockhaus, \\"Pope Francis lifts pontifical secret from legal proceedings of abuse trials of clerics\\", Catholic News Agency, 17 December 2019] Its use in such cases had been condemned by German Cardinal Reinhard Marx at the Meeting on the Protection of Minors in the Church held in the Vatican from 21 to 24 February 2019. Matters covered by pontifical secret The instruction Secreta continere lists ten classes of matters covered by the pontifical secret: # Preparation of papal documents, if pontifical secrecy is expressly demanded # Information obtained officially by the Secretariat of State in connection with questions requiring pontifical secrecy # Notifications sent to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith about teachings and publications and the Congregation's examination of them. # Extrajudicial denunciations of crimes against the faith and morals or against the sacrament of Penance, while safeguarding the right of the person denounced to be informed of the denunciation, if his defence against it makes this necessary. The name of the person making the denunciation may be made known to him only if it is judged necessary to have a face-to-face confrontation between denouncer and denounced. # Reports by papal legates on matters covered by pontifical secrecy. # Information obtained officially with regard to the naming of cardinals # Information obtained officially with regard to the naming of bishops and papal legates and the relative inquiries. # Information obtained officially with regard to the naming of the chief officers of the Roman Curia. # All matters concerning cipher systems and enciphered messages. # Any matter that the Pope, a Cardinal in charge of a department of the Roman Curia, or a papal legate considers to be of such importance that it requires the protection of papal secrecy.Instruction Secreta continere, article I Matters excluded from the pontifical secret The canon law instruction \\"On the confidentiality of legal proceedings\\", of 17 December 2019, excluded from the pontifical secret the accusations, trials and decisions in canonical investigations and trial involving: # violence or abuse of authority in forcing sexual acts, # sexual abuse of minors or vulnerable persons, # paedophilia involving children under 18 years of age or with incapacitated subjects, # concealment of those conducts from ecclesiastical or civil inquiries. According to Archbishop Juan Ignacio Arrieta, Secretary of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, the purpose of the Rescript of 17 December 2019 was to: On its part, Prof. Giuseppe Dalla Torre, former president of the Vatican City State Tribunal, observed that the lifting of the Pontifical secret was due to the fact that: According to Archbishop Charles Scicluna, adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the abolition of pontifical secrecy means that: Sanctions for violation While violation of pontifical secrecy, if deliberate, is a grave sin, and while an automatic excommunication may sometimes be imposed for violation of secrecy on particular matters, the general rule is only that, if the violation becomes known outside of Confession, a penalty proportionate to the wrongdoing and the damage caused is to be inflicted.Instruction Secreta continere, article III An example of the imposition of automatic excommunication for violation of secrecy was found in the 1962 instruction Crimen sollicitationis (in force until replaced by new norms in 2001),Thomas Doyle, The 1922 Instruction and the 1962 Instruction Crimen sollicitationis , section 2 which imposed this penalty on members of a Church tribunal trying a priest accused of making sexual advances to a penitent in connection with the sacrament of Penance, if they violated secrecy about developments in the course of the ecclesiastical trial.Instruction Crimen sollicitationis, article 11 A person to whom such advances were made was, on the contrary, subjected to excommunication if that person failed to denounce the priest within at most one month.Instruction Crimen sollicitationis, article 18 Thus the procedures of the Church tribunal were covered by papal secrecy (called at that time secrecy of the Holy Office), but the crime of the priest was not: \\"These matters are confidential only to the procedures within the Church, but do not preclude in any way for these matters to be brought to civil authorities for proper legal adjudication. The Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People of June, 2002, approved by the Vatican, requires that credible allegations of sexual abuse of children be reported to legal authorities.\\"April 2005 statement by Joseph Fiorenza, then Archbishop of Galveston-Houston.

Even where the seal of confession does not strictly apply ‚Äì where there is no specific serious sin confessed for the purpose of receiving absolution ‚Äì priests have a serious obligation not to cause scandal by the way they speak. History =Ecumenical councils= Canon 21 of the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), binding on the whole church, laid down the obligation of secrecy in the following words: Gratian, who compiled the edicts of previous Catholic Ecumenical Councils and the principles of church law, published the Decretum about 1151. It includes the following declaration of the law as to the seal of confession: \\"Let the priest who dares to make known the sins of his penitent be deposed.\\" Gratian goes on to say that the violator of this law should be made a lifelong, ignominious wanderer.Secunda pars, dist. VI, c. II Notably, neither the Lateran canon nor the law of the Decretum purports to enact for the first time the secrecy of confession.Nolan, R. (1912), \\"The Law of the Seal of Confession\\" in the Catholic Encyclopedia. New York: Robert Appleton Company. Retrieved August 18, 2017 from New Advent: http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13649b.htm The 15th- century English canonist William Lyndwood speaks of two reasons why a priest is bound to keep secret a confession, the first being on account of the sacrament because it is almost (quasi) of the essence of the sacrament to keep secret the confession.Cf. also Jos. Mascardus, De probationibus, Frankfort, 1703, arg. 378. =Thomist theology= The Summa Theologiae devotes one article to the seal of confession, explaining that the seal may not be violated, including regarding matters that might indirectly lead to the seal's violation, not even violated by those who hear the confession. Thomas gives two reasons for the seal's inviolability: the seal is divinely instituted and the seal prevents scandal. =Catechisms= According to the Roman Catechism, \\"the faithful are to be admonished that there is no reason whatever to apprehend that what is made known in confession will ever be revealed by the priest to anyone, or that by it the penitent can at any time be brought into danger of any sort ... Let the priest, says the great Council of Lateran, take special care, neither by word or sign, nor by any other means whatever, to betray in the least degree the sinner.\\" Pope Pius X in his catechism taught that \\"the confessor is bound by the seal of confession under the gravest sin and under threat of the severest punishments both temporal and eternal.\\" The Catechism of the Catholic Church teaches in paragraph 1467: The Compendium of the Catechism of the Catholic Church elaborates that a confessor is bound to secrecy. =Apostolic Penitentiary= In Note on the importance of the internal forum and the inviolability of the Sacramental Seal, the Apostolic Penitentiary explained that the sacramental seal is universally and permanently inviolable as a matter of de fide dogma, and as part of freedom of religion and freedom of conscience, despite civil law.Vatican: Presentation of the Note of the Apostolic Penitentiary on the importance of the internal forum and the inviolability of the sacramental sealCatholic News Agency: Seal of confession is an 'intrinsic requirement,' Vatican saysReuters: Vatican defends confessional secret as sexual abuse crisis stingsKatv: Amid sex abuse scandals, Vatican upholds confession secrecyWSJ: Vatican Hits Back at Attempts to Break Confession SecrecyIrish Times: Efforts to force priests to divulge confession secrets ‚Äòunacceptable‚ÄôCBS: Vatican court rejects laws obligating priests to report sexual abuse revealed in confessions In practice According to Roman Catholic canon law, \\"The sacramental seal is inviolable; therefore it is absolutely forbidden for a confessor to betray in any way a penitent in words or in any manner and for any reason.\\" The confessor is always an ordained priest, because in the Catholic Church only ordained priests can absolve sins; lay confession is not recognized. Any person who overhears a confession is likewise bound by the seal.983 ¬ß1‚Äì2 Priests may not reveal what they have learned during confession to anyone, even under the threat of their own death or that of others. Punishment for breaking the seal of the confessional is conferred by the severity of the violation: \\"a person who violate directly violates the seal of the confessional (that is: explicitly connects a sin to a penitent) incurs a latae sententiae excommunication.\\" One who breaks the seal \\"indirectly\\" (that is: through their words and actions make known a particular penitent's sins and somehow connects those sins to the penitent) would be punished according to the \\"gravity of the delict\\".CIC c. 1388 ¬ß1 Both St. John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI made it a practice to attach a latae sentintiae excommunication to indirect violations of the seal. Those who are privy to another person's confession either as an interpreter or by accidental circumstance are likewise punished according to the gravity of their delict \\"not excluding excommunication\\".CIC c. 1388 ¬ß2 In the Early Modern period, some casuists (Thomas Sanchez, etc.) justified mental reservation, a form of deception which does not involve outright lying, in specific circumstances including when such an action is necessary to protect secrecy under the seal of the confessional. Other casuists considered \\"grey areas\\" in which it was unclear whether or not the seal was being violated. A priest who says \\"I do not know\\" is thus to be understood \\"I do not know with knowledge outside the Seal of the Confessional\\"; St. Thomas Aquinas goes even further and says that the priest knows the confession \\"not as man, but as God knows it\\".Supp. 11 I ad 2. It is permissible (though by no means necessary) for a priest to talk indirectly about some information he has or has not heard in confessions over the years as part of a homily or teaching lecture as long as he gives no information connecting this information to any specific person. For example, he could choose to mention \\"I've heard the confession of a murderer,\\" or \\"I've almost never heard anyone explicitly confess a failure to help to poor.\\" There are limited cases where portions of a confession may be revealed to others, but always with the penitent's permission and always without actually revealing the penitent's identity. This is the case, for example, with more serious offenses, as some excommunicable offenses are reserved to the Holy See and their permission to grant absolution must be obtained. In these cases, the priest hearing the confession asks the permission of the penitent to write a petition, using pseudonyms and containing the absolute minimum information necessary, to the bishop or to the Apostolic Penitentiary, the cardinal delegated by the Pope to handle such requests. This request may be forwarded, sealed, through the apostolic delegate or nuncio in a country (the Pope's ambassador), to be guarded by the privilege of a diplomatic pouch. Recognition by civil authorities The law of different jurisdictions in general requires people under certain circumstances to testify about facts known to them. In many cases, the rule of evidence of confessional privilege forbids judicial inquiry into communications made under the seal of confession. There may be conflict between the obligation of confidentiality of confession, and civil law. The Louisiana Supreme Court ruled in 2014 that a priest may be compelled to testify about what he was told in the confessional regarding a particular sexual abuse case, leaving the priest at risk of excommunication if he even confirms that a confession took place, or jail for contempt of court should he refuse to testify. However, the Court later ruled that a priest has no duty to report confidential information heard during a sacramental confession. Martyrs John of Nepomuk, Mateo Correa Magallanes, Fernando Olmedo Reguera and Pedro Marieluz Garces are martyrs of the seal of the confessional in the Catholic Church, choosing to die rather than violate the seal.

He was a prominent member of the School of Chartres. John of Salisbury, a bishop of Chartres and former student of William's, refers to William as the most talented grammarian after Bernard of Chartres. Life He was born in Conches, Normandy. His teaching activity extended from c. 1120 to 1154, and about the year 1145 he became the tutor of Henry Plantagenet. It is possible, but uncertain, that he was teaching at Chartres before that. Warned by a friend of the danger implied in his Platonic realism as he applied it to theology, he took up the study of Islamic philosophy and physical science. When and where he died is a matter of uncertainty. William devoted much attention to cosmology and psychology. Having been a student of Bernard of Chartres, he shows the characteristic Humanism, tendency towards Platonism, and taste for natural science which distinguish the \\"Chartrains\\". He is one of the first of the medieval Christian philosophers to take advantage of Islamic physical and physiological lore, to which he had access in the translations by Constantine the African. William of St. Thierry, who had encouraged Bernard of Clairvaux to prosecute Abelard, in another letter to Bernard attacked William's De philosophia mundi for having a modalist view of the Holy Trinity. William in consequence revised some controversial parts in the Dragmaticon. Works There is a good deal of discussion regarding the authorship of the works ascribed to William. It seems probable, however, that he wrote the encyclopedic De philosophia mundi (or Philosophia) and the related dialogue Dragmaticon, as well as glosses on Plato's Timaeus, on Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy, on Priscian's Institutiones grammaticae, and on Macrobius's Commentary on the Dream of Scipio. He was probably also the author of a lost treatise Magna de naturis philosophia. A work on ethics, the Moralium dogma philosophorum, was attributed to him in the 1920s, but his authorship is now rejected by most scholars. De philosophia mundi The De philosophia mundi is divided into four books, covering physics, astronomy, geography, meteorology and medicine. William explains the world as composed of elements (elementa), which he defines as \\"the simplest and minimum part[s] of any body‚Äîsimple in quality, minimum in quantity\\".\\"Elementum ergo, ut ait Constantinus in Pantegni, est simpla et minima pars alicuius corporis‚Äîsimpla ad qualitatem, minima ad quantitatem\\" (De philosophia mundi, Liber primus, capitulum XXII). He identifies the elements with the traditional four elements (fire, air, water, earth) but (following Constantine the African) not as they are perceived, since as such they are neither simple in quality nor minimum in quantity: earth, for example, contains something hot, something cold, something dry and something wet at the same time. Pure elements are not to be perceived, says William, but to be grasped by reason, through an abstract division of the sensible bodies.\\"Quae elementa numquam videntur, sed ratione divisionis intelliguntur\\" (Ibidem). Each of these pure elements has two of the four basic qualities: earth is cold and dry, water is cold and humid, air is hot and humid and fire is hot and dry. The perceivable elements, called elementata,\\"Si ergo illis digna velimus imponere nomina, particulas praedictas dicamus ¬´elementa¬ª, ista quae videntur ¬´elementata¬ª\\" (Ibidem). are made of pure elements: the sensible earth especially of pure earth, the sensible water especially of pure water, and so on. The discussion of meteorology includes a description of air becoming less dense and colder as the altitude increases, and William attempts to explain the circulation of the air in connection with the circulation of the oceans. The discussion of medicine deals chiefly with procreation and childbirth. This work influenced Jean de Meung, the author of the second part of the Roman de la Rose.

It is one type of organic acidemia. The condition gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine, particularly prior to diagnosis and during times of acute illness.  Classification  Maple syrup urine disease can be classified by its pattern of signs and symptoms, or by its genetic cause. The most common and severe form of this disease is the classic type, which appears soon after birth, and as long as it remains untreated, gives rise to progressive and unremitting symptoms. Variant forms of the disorder may become apparent only later in infancy or childhood, with typically less severe symptoms that may only appear during times of fasting, stress or illness, but still involve mental and physical problems if left untreated. Sub-divisions of MSUD: #Classic MSUD #Intermediate MSUD #Intermittent MSUD #Thiamine-responsive MSUD Generally, majority of patients will be classified into one of these four categories but some patients affected by MSUD do not fit the criteria for the listed sub- divisions and will be deemed unclassified MSUD. Signs and symptoms The disease is named for the presence of sweet-smelling urine, similar to maple syrup, when the person goes into metabolic crisis. Along with the smell being present in ear wax of an affected individual during metabolic crisis. In populations to whom maple syrup is unfamiliar, the aroma can be likened to fenugreek, and fenugreek ingestion may impart the aroma to urine. Symptoms of MSUD varies between patients and is greatly related to the amount of residual enzyme activity. = Classic MSUD= Infants with classic MSUD will display subtle symptoms within 2-3 days. Subtle symptoms include poor feeding, either bottle or breast, lethargy, and irritability. The infant will then experience increased focal neurologic signs. These neurologic signs include athetoid, hypertonia, spasticity, and opisthotonus that lead to convulsions and coma. If MSUD is left untreated, central neurologic function and respiratory failure will occur and lead to death. Although MSUD can be stabilized, there are still threats of metabolic decompensation and loss bone mass that can lead to osteoporosis, pancreatitis, and intracranial hypertension. Other signs and symptoms associated with classic MSUD include intellectual limitation and behavioral issues. = Intermediate MSUD = Intermediate MSUD has greater levels of residual enzyme activity than classic MSUD. The majority of children with intermediate MSUD are diagnosed between the ages of 5 months and 7 years. Symptoms associated with classic MSUD also appear in intermediate MSUD. = Intermittent MSUD = Contrary to classic and intermediate MSUD, intermittent MSUD individuals will have normal growth and intellectual development. Symptoms of lethargy and characterized odor of maple syrup will occur when the individual experiences stress, does not eat, or develops an infection. Metabolic crisis leading to seizures, coma, and brain damage is still a possibility. = Thiamine-response MSUD = Symptoms associated with thiamine- response MSUD are similar to intermediate MSUD. Newborns rarely present with symptoms. = Later onset = The symptoms of MSUD may also present later depending on the severity of the disease. Untreated in older individuals, and during times of metabolic crisis, symptoms of the condition include uncharacteristically inappropriate, extreme or erratic behaviour and moods, hallucinations, lack of appetite, weight loss, anemia, diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, oscillating hypertonia and hypotonia, ataxia, seizures, hypoglycaemia, ketoacidosis, opisthotonus, pancreatitis, rapid neurological decline, and coma. Death from cerebral edema will likely occur if there is no treatment. Additionally, MSUD patients experience an abnormal course of diseases in simple infections that can lead to permanent damage. Causes Maple syrup urine disease has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Mutations in the following genes cause maple syrup urine disease: * BCKDHA () * BCKDHB () * DBT () * DLD () These four genes produce proteins that work together as the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase complex. The complex is essential for breaking down the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. These are present in some quantity in almost all kinds of food, but in particular, protein-rich foods such as dairy products, meat, fish, soy, gluten, eggs, nuts, whole grains, seeds, avocados, algae, edible seaweed, beans, and pulses. Mutation in any of these genes reduces or eliminates the function of the enzyme complex, preventing the normal breakdown of isoleucine, leucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their by-products build up in the body. Because high levels of these substances are toxic to the brain and other organs, this accumulation leads to the serious medical problems associated with maple syrup urine disease. This condition has an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, which means the defective gene is located on an autosome, and two copies of the gene ‚Äì one from each parent ‚Äì must be inherited to be affected by the disorder. The parents of a child with an autosomal recessive disorder are carriers of one copy of the defective gene, but are usually not affected by the disorder.  Pathophysiology  MSUD is a metabolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the branched-chain alpha- keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKAD), leading to a buildup of the branched- chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine) and their toxic by- products (ketoacids) in the blood and urine.The buildup of these BCAAS will lead to the maple syrup odor that is associated with MSUD. The BCKAD complex begins by breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine through the use of branch-chain aminotransferase into their relevant Œ±-ketoacids. The second step involves the conversion of Œ±-ketoacids into acetoacetate, acetyl-CoA, and succunyl-CoA through oxidative decarboxylation of Œ±-ketoacids. The BCKAD complex consists of four subunits designated E1Œ±, E1Œ≤, E2, and E3. The E3 subunit is also a component of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. MSUD can result from mutations in any of the genes that code for these enzyme subunits, E1Œ±, E1Œ≤, E2, and E3. Mutations of these enzyme subunits will lead to the BCKAD complex unable to break down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. The levels of these branched chain amino acids will become elevated and lead to the symptoms associated with MSUD. Glutamate levels are maintained in the brain by BCAA metabolism functions and if not properly maintained can lead to neurological problems that are seen in MSUD individuals. High levels of leucine has also been shown to affect water homeostasis within subcortical gray matter leading to cerebral edema, which occurs in MSUD patients if left untreated.  Diagnosis  Prior to the easy availability of plasma amino acid measurement, diagnosis was commonly made based on suggestive symptoms and odor. Affected individuals are now often identified with characteristic elevations on plasma amino acids which do not have the characteristic odor. The compound responsible for the odor is sotolon (sometimes spelled sotolone). On 9 May 2014, the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) announced its recommendation to screen every newborn baby in the UK for four further genetic disorders as part of its NHS Newborn Blood Spot Screening programme, including maple syrup urine disease. The disease is estimated to affect 1 out of 185,000 infants worldwide and its frequency increases with certain heritages. Newborn screening for maple syrup urine disease involves analyzing the blood of 1‚Äì2 day-old newborns through tandem mass spectrometry. The blood concentration of leucine and isoleucine is measured relative to other amino acids to determine if the newborn has a high level of branched-chain amino acids. Once the newborn is 2‚Äì3 days old the blood concentration of branched-chain amino acids like leucine is greater than 1000 ¬µmol/L and alternative screening methods are used. Instead, the newborn's urine is analyzed for levels of branched-chain alpha-hydroxyacids and alpha- ketoacids. The amount and type of enzyme activity in an affected individual with MSUD will determine which classification the affected individual will identify with. Classic MSUD: Less than 2% of normal enzyme activity Intermediate MSUD: 3-8% normal enzyme activity Intermittent MSUD: 8-15% of normal enzyme activity Thiamine-Responsive MSUD: Large doses of thiamine will increase enzyme activity.  Prevention  There are no methods for preventing the manifestation of the pathology of MSUD in infants with two defective copies of the BCKD gene. However, genetic counselors may consult with couples to screen for the disease via DNA testing. DNA testing is also available to identify the disease in an unborn child in the womb. Treatment = Monitoring = Keeping MSUD under control requires careful monitoring of blood chemistry, both at home and in a hospital setting. DNPH or specialised dipsticks may be used to test the patient's urine for ketones (a sign of metabolic decompensation), when metabolic stress is likely or suspected. Fingerstick tests are performed regularly and sent to a laboratory to determine blood levels of leucine, isoleucine, and valine. Regular metabolic consultations, including blood-draws for full nutritional analysis, are recommended; especially during puberty and periods of rapid growth. MSUD management also involves a specially tailored metabolic formula, a modified diet, and lifestyle precautions such as avoiding fatigue and infections, as well as consuming regular, sufficient calories in proportion to physical stress and exertion. Without sufficient calories, catabolism of muscle protein will result in metabolic crisis. Those with MSUD must be hospitalised for intravenous infusion of sugars and nasogastric drip-feeding of formula, in the event of metabolic decompensation, or lack of appetite, diarrhea or vomiting. Food avoidance, rejection of formula and picky eating are all common problems with MSUD. Some patients may need to receive all or part of their daily nutrition through a feeding tube. = Diet control = A diet with carefully controlled levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine must be maintained at all times in order to prevent neurological damage. Since these three amino acids occur in all natural protein, and most natural foods contain some protein, any food intake must be closely monitored, and day-to-day protein intake calculated on a cumulative basis, to ensure individual tolerance levels are not exceeded at any time. As the MSUD diet is so protein- restricted, and adequate protein is a requirement for all humans, tailored metabolic formula containing all the other essential amino acids, as well as any vitamins, minerals, omega-3 fatty acids and trace elements (which may be lacking due to the limited range of permissible foods), are an essential aspect of MSUD management. These complement the MSUD patient's natural food intake to meet normal nutritional requirements without causing harm. If adequate calories cannot be obtained from natural food without exceeding protein tolerance, specialised low protein products such as starch-based baking mixtures, imitation rice and pasta may be prescribed, often alongside a protein-free carbohydrate powder added to food and/or drink, and increased at times of metabolic stress. MSUD patients with thiamine- responsive MSUD can have a higher protein intake diet with administration of high doses of thiamine, a cofactor of the enzyme that causes the condition. The typical dosage amount of thiamine-responsive MSUD depends on the enzyme activity present and can range from 10mg - 100mg daily. = Liver transplantation = Usually MSUD patients are monitored by a dietitian. Liver transplantation is another treatment option that can completely and permanently normalise metabolic function, enabling discontinuation of nutritional supplements and strict monitoring of biochemistry and caloric intake, relaxation of MSUD- related lifestyle precautions, and an unrestricted diet. This procedure is most successful when performed at a young age, and weaning from immunosuppressants may even be possible in the long run. However, the surgery is a major undertaking requiring extensive hospitalisation and rigorous adherence to a tapering regimen of medications. Following transplant, the risk of periodic rejection will always exist, as will the need for some degree of lifelong monitoring in this respect. Despite normalising clinical presentation, liver transplantation is not considered a cure for MSUD. The patient will still carry two copies of the mutated BKAD gene in each of their own cells, which will consequently still be unable to produce the missing enzyme. They will also still pass one mutated copy of the gene on to each of their biological children. As a major surgery the transplant procedure itself also carries standard risks, although the odds of its success are greatly elevated when the only indication for it is an inborn error of metabolism. In absence of a liver transplant, the MSUD diet must be adhered to strictly and permanently. However, in both treatment scenarios, with proper management, those afflicted are able to live healthy, normal lives without suffering the severe neurological damage associated with the disease. = Pregnancy = Control of metabolism is vital during pregnancy of women with MSUD. To prevent detrimental abnormalities in development of the embryo or fetus, dietary adjustments should be made and plasma amino acid concentrations of the mother should be observed carefully and frequently. Amino acid deficiency can be detected through fetal growth, making it essential to monitor development closely. Prognosis If left untreated, MSUD will lead to death due to central neurological function failure and respiratory failure. Early detection, diet low in branched-chain amino acids, and close monitoring of blood chemistry can lead to a good prognosis with little or no abnormal developments. Even with proper treatment, metabolic crisis is still likely to occur and can lead to death without immediate medical treatment. Epidemiology Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is a rare, inherited metabolic disorder. Its prevalence in the United States population is approximately 1 newborn out of 180,000 live births. However, in populations where there is a higher frequency of consanguinity, such as the Mennonites in Pennsylvania or the Amish, the frequency of MSUD is significantly higher at 1 newborn out of 176 live births. In Austria, 1 newborn out of 250,000 live births inherits MSUD. It also is believed to have a higher prevalence in certain populations due in part to the founder effect since MSUD has a much higher prevalence in children of Amish, Mennonite, and Jewish descent. Research directions =Gene therapy= Gene therapy to overcome genetic mutations cause MSUD has already been proven safe in animals studies with MSUD. The gene therapy involves a healthy copy of the gene causing MSUD is produced and inserted into a viral vector. The adeno-associated virus vector is delivered one-time to the patient intravenously. Hepatocytes will take up vector and functional copies of the affected gene is MSUD patients will be expressed. This will allow BCAA to be broken down properly and prevent toxic build up. =Phenylbutyrate therapy= Sodium phenylacetate/benzoate or sodium phenylbutyrate has been shown to reduce BCAA in a clinical trial done February 2011. Phenylbutyrate treatment reduced the blood concentration of BCAA and their corresponding BCKA in certain groups of MSUD patients and may be a possible adjunctive treatment.

It is a strong ion exchange resin, which means it can exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. The functional group of the anion exchange resin is a quaternary ammonium group attached to an inert styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. Colestyramine removes bile acids from the body by forming insoluble complexes with bile acids in the intestine, which are then excreted in the feces. As a result of this loss of bile acids, more plasma cholesterol is converted to bile acids in the liver to normalise levels.http://livertox.nih.gov/Cholestyramine.htm, United States National Institutes of Health (page visited on 22 June 2016). This conversion of cholesterol into bile acids lowers plasma cholesterol levels. Medical uses Bile acid sequestrants such as colestyramine were first used to treat hypercholesterolemia, but since the introduction of statins, now have only a minor role for this indication. They can also be used to treat the pruritus, or itching, that often occurs during liver failure and other types of cholestasis where the ability to eliminate bile acids is reduced. Colestyramine is commonly used to treat diarrhea resulting from bile acid malabsorption. It was first used for this in Crohn's disease patients who had undergone ileal resection. The terminal portion of the small bowel (ileum) is where bile acids are reabsorbed. When this section is removed, the bile acids pass into the large bowel and cause diarrhea due to stimulation of chloride/fluid secretion by the colonocytes resulting in a secretory diarrhea. Colestyramine prevents this increase in water by making the bile acids insoluble and osmotically inactive. Colestyramine is also used in the control of other types of bile acid diarrhea. The primary, idiopathic form of bile acid diarrhea is a common cause of chronic functional diarrhea, often misdiagnosed as diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), and most of these patients respond to colestyramine. It is beneficial in the treatment of postcholecystectomy syndrome chronic diarrhea. Colestyramine is also useful in treating post-vagotomy diarrhea. Colestyramine can be helpful in the treatment of Clostridium difficile infections, to absorb toxins A and B, and reduce the diarrhea and the other symptoms these toxins cause. However, because it is not an anti-infective, it is used in concert with vancomycin. It is also used in the \\"wash out\\" procedure in patients taking leflunomide or teriflunomide to aid drug elimination in the case of drug discontinuation due to severe side effects caused by leflunomide or teriflunomide. A case report suggests that colestyramine may be useful for cyanobacterial (microcystin) poisoning in dogs. Ointments containing colestyramine compounded with aquaphor have been used in topical treatment of diaper rash in infants and toddlers. Cholestyramine also binds with oxalate in the GI tract, ultimately reducing urine oxalate and calcium oxalate stone formation. Available forms Colestyramine is available as powder form, in 4-g packets, or in larger canisters. In the United States, it can be purchased either as a generic medicine, or as Questran or Questran Light (Bristol-Myers Squibb). Dosage A typical dose is 4 to 8 g once or twice daily, with a maximum dose of 24 g/d.  Side effects  These side effects have been noted: * Most frequent: constipation * Increased plasma triglycerides Intestinal obstruction has been reported in patients with previous bowel surgery who should use colestyramine cautiously. Cholestyramine-induced hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis has also been reported rarely. Patients with hypothyroidism, diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, dysproteinemia, obstructive liver disease, kidney disease, or alcoholism should consult their doctor before taking this medication. Other drugs should be taken at least one hour before or four to six hours after colestyramine to reduce possible interference with absorption. Patients with phenylketonuria should consult with a physician before taking Questran Light because that product contains phenylalanine.  Drug interactions  Interactions with these drugs have been noted: *Digitalis *Estrogens and progestins *Oral diabetes drugs *Penicillin G *Phenobarbital *Spironolactone *Tetracycline *Thiazide-type diuretic pills *Thyroid medication *Warfarin *Leflunomide Most interactions are due to the risk of decreased absorption of these drugs. The duration of treatment is not limited, but the prescribing physician should reassess at regular intervals if continued treatment is still necessary. The principal overdose risk is blockage of intestine or stomach. Colestyramine may interfere in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamins A, D, E, and K. No special considerations regarding alcohol consumption are made.

In 1231, he was made a member of the commission appointed by Gregory IX to examine Aristotle's writings on the natural sciences and to offer amendments where religiously necessary. Consequently, William was one of the first theologians to be influenced by Aristotle. His Summa Aurea shows a debt still to Peter Lombard, and it advances the ontological argument, but it also shows novelty and an intellectual awareness and insistence on the physical that had not been seen earlier.

He almost certainly studied at Oxford University and lectured on the Sentences of Peter Lombard there, but he is not listed among the Oxford masters. There is some evidence, but no certainty, that he also taught at the University of Paris, perhaps lecturing there too on the Sentences. He was known as the Doctor Fundatus (established doctor) and less commonly the Doctor Praeclarus (very clear doctor). Only one work can reliably be attributed to him, a commentary on the Sentences which survives in many manuscripts: only small parts have been edited, by the Franciscans of Quaracchi (1904), and by A. Daniels (1909, 1913), P. Muscat (1927), J.-M. Bissen (1927), and L. H√∂dl (1990). William does not try to discuss every distinction, but concentrates on the topics he finds most important, devoting over 100 questions to book 1 and just 129 to the remaining three books. Among the theologians whose views William discusses are Henry of Ghent, Godfrey of Fontaines, Giles of Rome, and Richard of Middleton. Traditionally William has been assumed to be the master of Duns Scotus. In a work on the immaculate conception (c. 1373) Thomas Rossy refers to William as the Magister Scoti, as does Bartolomeo da Pisa in his De conformitate vitae beati Francisci ad vitam domini Jesu of the late 1380s.

Niggli was born in Zofingen and studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich and the University of Zurich, where he obtained a doctorate. His 1919 book, Geometrische Kristallographie des Diskontinuums, played a seminal role in the refinement of space group theory. In this book, Niggli demonstrated that although X-ray reflection conditions do not always uniquely determine the space group to which a crystal belongs, they do reveal a small number of possible space groups to which it could belong. Niggli used morphological methods to account for internal structure and, in his 1928 Kristallographische und Strukturtheoretische Grundbegriffe, he took up what is essentially the reverse process, the task of establishing the connection between space lattices and external crystal morphology. The great aim of his life was to integrate the whole field of Earth sciences. In 1920, Niggli became the lead scientist at the ETH's Institut f√ºr Mineralogie und Petrographie, where he brought his systematic approach to the study of crystal morphologies using X-ray diffraction. In 1935, Niggli and his doctoral student Werner Nowacki (1909‚Äì1988) determined the 73 three-dimensional arithmetic crystal classes (symmorphic space groups). Niggli retired from the Institute in 1949. He was also professor of mineralogy at the Eidgen√∂ssische Technische Hochschule and at the University of Zurich. Niggli succeeded Paul Heinrich von Groth (1843‚Äì1927) as editor of Zeitschrift f√ºr Kristallographie. In 1948, Niggli was awarded the Roebling Medal of the Mineralogical Society of America. Since 1988 the Paul Niggli Foundation awards medals to outstanding Swiss mineral scientists below the age of 35 with a strong perspective for an academic career.

The main source for her life is the hagriographical work Vita Adelheidis.Translated by Bergen Dick, Madelyn, Mater spiritualis - The Life of Adelheid of Vilich. Toronto/Ontario 1994. Life Adelaide was born around 970, youngest daughter of Megengoz, Count of Geldern, and his wife Gerberga. As a child, she was given to the convent of St. Ursula in Cologne, probably before 977, where she was educated according to the Rule of St Jerome, and engaged in philosophical studies, according to her Vita. When her older brother Godfrey died in battle in 977, her parents began funding the construction of a church in his honour at Vilich (today part of Bonn-Beuel) and worked to establish a female monastic community following the rule of the observances of the canonesses. As part of this process they redeemed their daughter from St Ursula with a gift of land and established her as abbess of the newly founded community at Vilich. To determine Vilich's legal position in the empire, her parents appealed to emperor Otto III in 987 to obtain a charter granting Vilich the same legal status as the imperial convents of Gandersheim, Quedlinburg, and Essen. This charter was confirmed by a papal bull from Pope Gregory VI, dated 24 May 996. Due to the death of her mother Geberga in c.995, Adelaide was forced to lead the convent by herself. She used this position of power to change the rule of Vilich to the Rule of Saint Benedict despite some canonesses of the convent resisting this change and leaving Vilich. Three years after Gerberga's death, Adelaide's father Megengoz died as well. He was buried alongside his wife at Vilich. Adelaide inherited a large part of the family wealth. Some of it was used to buy land for the convent while the remaining funds were given to the poor in a charitable act. In c.1000, Adelaide's sister Bertrada, abbess of St Mary in the Capitol died. Archbishop Heribert of Cologne expressed wishes for Adelaide to assume responsibility for the abbey. Initially, Adelaide declined the offer allegedly due to the distance between Vilich and St Mary in the Capitol. Despite this, Archbishop Heribert of Cologne managed to enforce his wish by contacting the emperor in Aachen. It is not clear from the Vita Adelheidis if this had been emperor Otto III or Henry II. Adelaide was subsequently called to the court and confirmed as abbess of St Mary in the Capitol. Adelaide's new position lead to her charitable work in Vilich becoming well known in the city of Cologne. Her favourable reputation increased after bad harvests in the following years, during which Adelaide cared for the people in Cologne. While her relationship towards Archbishop Heribert is described by the vita as one of caritas, the sisters at Vilich are depicted as feeling neglected due to Adelaide spending time in Cologne. On 5 February of an unknown year, Adelaide died of a sore throat in the company of her friend Archbishop Heribert. Her sisters from Vilich did not believe a message describing Adelaide's illness and arrived after she had died. Archbishop Heribert wished for Adelaide to be buried in Cologne, but the sisters convinced him to have her buried in Vilich.  Sources  One of the main sources of Adelaide's life is the Vita Adelheidis virginis. The vita is a hagiographical source which also includes information on Adelaide's family and the convent of Vilich itself. It was written around 1057 by Bertha with the aid of contemporary witnesses. Bertha appears to have written the Vita before entering the convent of Vilich. The Vita is directed to Anno II, archbishop of Cologne (1056-1075). In the Vita of Bertha's brother, Wolfhelm, it is documented that Bertha wrote the Vita Adelheidis alongside other vitae. Much information from the vita is supported by different charters; mainly by a charter from 944, in which Otto I. restores Megingoz's property and by a charter from 987 by which Otto III. grants the Abbey of Vilich the status of Reichsstift (imperial convent). Veneration During her term of office, the region around Cologne was affected by famines. Therefore, she prayed for the poorest and as a result a source of water arose in the district of P√ºtzchen in modern-day Bonn. The source was transformed to a well and it became an important pilgrimage destination for the worship of Adelheid. This fountain has been preserved until today; every year in September, there is a pilgrimage in veneration of Adelheid. In 1641, her grave in the Vilicher Stiftskirche was opened and it was empty. After this discovery, the number of pilgrims fell sharply, but every year a few relics were and still are shown to the public.http://rheinische- geschichte.lvr.de/Persoenlichkeiten/adelheid-von- vilich/DE-2086/lido/56eb20df86ddb9.16056935 Beside this well, some other miracles have been recorded, which are supposed to have taken place at her grave. Adelaide was canonized by Pope Paul VI on 27 January 1966. As her day of death, the 5th of February was confirmed as the official day of her remembrance. Even today, several churches and monasteries in Bonn and Cologne, as well as several schools, are named after her. On 8 September 2008 Adelaide was proclaimed the third city patron saint of Bonn.

He died from injuries sustained when a massive bomb exploded on the Beirut seafront as he passed by in former Lebanese prime minister Rafik Hariri's motorcade on 14 February 2005. Early years and education Fleihan was born in Beirut on 10 September 1963. He attended International College. He received a bachelor of arts degree in economics from the American University of Beirut (AUB) in 1984. Then he obtained a master of arts degree in international and development economics from Yale University in 1985. He also held a PhD in economics from Columbia University in 1990. His PhD dissertation was entitled ‚ÄúCustoms Unions, Growth and Economic Diversification‚Äù. Career From 1988 to 1993, Fleihan worked at the International Monetary Fund in Washington DC. He worked there as an advisor and then senior advisor to the Saudi executive director. He also worked at the United Nations Development Programme. In 1993, he left his job and returned to Lebanon, where he had been asked to assist in the post-war rehabilitation of the ministry of finance. While working as an adviser at the ministry, from 1993 to 1999, Fleihan also taught economics at his old alma mater, the American University of Beirut (AUB). Fleihan was first elected to the Parliament of Lebanon in 2000, winning the Protestant seat in Beirut's first electoral district, and became the only Protestant member of the Parliament. He ran as a member of Hariri's \\"Dignity of Beirut\\" electoral list. In October 2000, he was appointed minister of economy and trade to the cabinet led by then prime minister Rafik Hariri. He held this position until 2003, and was replaced by Marwan Hamadeh. Fleihan played a role in the development of Lebanon's economic reform program, which was presented by Hariri to international donors at a Paris conference in November 2002. Donors pledged $4.3 billion in soft loans; the plan was never fully implemented, but Lebanon did ultimately receive $2.39 billion from the donors. Personal life Fleihan was a Protestant and a member of the National Evangelical Church of Beirut. Fleihan is survived by his wife, Yasma Fleihan, their children, Rayna (born 1999) and Rayan (born 2001), and his brother Ramsay and his family. Death and funeral The day before the Hariri assassination, Fleihan was in Geneva, Switzerland. Although his wife had tried to convince him to extend his stay in Europe, Fleihan insisted on returning to Lebanon for an extraordinary Parliamentary session scheduled for 14 February 2005. After the session, Fleihan joined Hariri in his motorcade to head back to the latter's mansion in West Beirut. About half-way through their journey, a one-ton truck bomb exploded as they passed through the city's upscale seafront hotel district. At least a dozen people‚Äîincluding Hariri and several of his bodyguards‚Äîwere killed instantly; the final death toll rose to 21. A United Nations investigation of the incident by Detlev Mehlis, released in October 2005, pointed the finger at Syrian and Lebanese officials. Despite being seated beside Hariri when the explosion occurred, Fleihan lived through the attack; however, severe burns covered over 95% of his body. Fleihan was firstly taken to the intensive care unit of the American University Hospital. Then he was airlifted to Percy Military Hospital in Clamart (suburb of Paris), where he survived for 64 days before finally succumbing to his injuries. He died on 18 April 2005. Fleihan's body was taken to Lebanon and funeral service was held at a Protestant church in Beirut. His body was buried in Tohwita, suburb of Beirut, on 22 April. Legacy His family established Basil Fuleihan Foundation in Lebanon after his death. The aim of the foundation is stated to be the provision of the basis for tomorrow‚Äôs Lebanon by promoting improvements in public policy and public service. In February 2006, the finance institute at Lebanese finance ministry was named the \\"Bassel Fleihan finance and economy institute\\", which Fleihan actively contributed its foundation in 1996.

Work Rosanoff studied both the physiological and genetic factors that lead to various psychosis, and is best known for his Theory of Personality, which broke down the human personality into seven scales: Normal, Hysteroid, Manic, Depressive, Autistic, Paranoid, and Epileptoid. These scales first modelled in the Humm-Wadsworth Temperament Scale personality test in 1935. These scales were used into the 1970s, notably by Chandler McLeod, who use a modified Humm system.

Mannix has served in both houses of the Oregon Legislative Assembly, as a Democrat and, later, a Republican. He is known for his advocacy of statewide ballot measures and as a candidate for the statewide offices of attorney general and governor.  Early political career  Mannix earned a bachelor's degree in liberal arts in 1971 from the University of Virginia.Jason Atkinson. Statesman Journal, April 23, 2006. In 1974, he earned his law degree from the University of Virginia School of Law. Prior to serving in the legislature, Mannix worked in several different capacities, including Assistant Attorney General of Oregon, Assistant Attorney General of Guam, and a law clerk to the Oregon Court of Appeals. Mannix was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives five times beginning in 1988.http://kevinmannix.com/election_history.php From 1989 through 1996, Mannix served in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat. In 1997, he became a Republican and was appointed to the Oregon State Senate. He was elected back into the Oregon House in November 1998 and served through 2000.  Ballot measure advocacy  Mannix is a driving force behind the effort to get tougher sentences for criminals. In 1994, he authored Ballot Measure 11, which established mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes, including murder, manslaughter, serious assault, kidnapping, rape, sodomy, unlawful sexual penetration, sexual abuse, and robbery. This measure has also now been used to set automatic sentencing on accidental deaths due to addiction issues. A companion measure, Measure 10, also passed, amending the Oregon Constitution to provide that any criminal sentence established by a vote of the people cannot be reduced by the legislature except with a two-thirds vote of both houses. A third successful Mannix measure, Measure 17, amended the Oregon Constitution to establish a new section which requires that state prison inmates work full-time in useful work. This also allowed work time to include education courses, counseling, and job training. In 1996, Mannix brought Ballot Measure 40 to the ballot. This contained several victims' rights and anti-crime provisions. The effects of these Measures is to set the primary locus of control in sentencing decisions with victims and prosecutors. Measure 40 passed by a margin of 59% to 41%, but was overturned by the Oregon Supreme Court in Armatta v. Kitzhaber, 327 Or. 250, 959 P.2d 49 (1998) on the grounds that it contained more than one amendment to the Oregon Constitution and should have been subject to separate votes on each provision. Measure 40 returned to voters by legislative referral (engineered by Representative Mannix) as Measures 69‚Äì75 in November 1999. Of the seven referral measures four were passed by voters, which granted crime victims the right to be present during trial, to be consulted regarding plea bargains and to be heard at sentencing; limited the pre-trial release of violent criminals by authorizing courts to consider the safety of victims and the public; required that any term of imprisonment imposed by a court to be fully served, with the exception of the governor's clemency power; and prohibited felons from serving on grand juries and criminal trial juries. In 2008, Mannix helped lead a citizen initiative effort for Measure 61 which would have created mandatory minimum prison sentences for certain theft, identity theft, forgery, drug and burglary crimes. This measure was trumped by Measure 57, a legislative referral which avoided mandatory minimum sentences in favor of increased sentences for drug trafficking, theft against the elderly, and certain repeat property and identity theft crimes. Another citizen initiative effort led by Mannix in 2010, Measure 73, was approved. This measure provided a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 25 years for repeat convictions of the worst sex crimes and required a minimum sentence of 90 days in jail, with costs reimbursed to the county by the state, for persons with a third DUII conviction within 10 years. In 2012, Measure 84, an effort to repeal Oregon's estate tax, was also supported by Mannix but was defeated. For the Oregon 2014 general election, Mannix, and Common Sense For Oregon, are supporting several initiatives including No Taxes on Family Giving and the Oregon Castle Doctrine.  Runs for statewide office  In 1996, Mannix ran for Oregon Attorney General as a Democrat.Law, Steve. Oregon governor's race party profile: Republicans. Statesman Journal, April 23, 2006. At the last minute, Hardy Myers was recruited by Democrats to run against Mannix in the Democratic primary, as some felt Mannix was too conservative for their party. Myers defeated Mannix in the primary 62.8% to 36.8%. Myers went on to easily defeat his Republican opponent in the November general election. Mannix changed his party affiliation to Republican the following year, 1997. He was appointed to the state Senate in 1998. In 2000, Mannix again ran for State Attorney General against Myers in a bitter campaign. Myers again defeated Mannix 49.8% to 46.2%. Libertarian candidate Tom Cox received 4.0%. There is the possibility that Cox siphoned off votes from Mannix, although it's far from certain that enough of them would have supported him to deny Myers victory. In 2002, Mannix ran for governor. In the Republican primary, he defeated former Labor Commissioner Jack Roberts and Portland attorney and school board chair Ron Saxton. He went on to run against Democrat Ted Kulongoski. Kulongoski won 49% of the vote versus 46% for Mannix. Libertarian candidate Tom Cox received 5% ‚Äì a margin which many observe could have swung the election, had those votes gone to Mannix. The defeat also marked the fifth time in a row the Republicans failed to gain control of the governor's mansion. Mannix became Oregon Republican Party Chair in January 2003, and stepped down in 2005. In 2006, Mannix ran again for the Republican nomination for governor. He finished second in the primary with 30% of the vote, behind Saxton, who won the nomination with 43%, and ahead of state senator Jason Atkinson, who received 22%. Mannix was opposed in the primary by the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, who spent $800,000 opposing the Columbia Gorge casino in the 2006 Democratic and Republican primaries. Saxton, widely considered more moderate than Mannix, went on to lose the general election in May to incumbent Kulongoski by an 8.1% margin. In 2008, Mannix ran for the United States House of Representatives in the U.S. House primary election for Oregon's 5th congressional district to succeed retiring Democrat Darlene Hooley. Mannix ran a vigorous campaign, but was narrowly defeated by Mike Erickson, who went on to lose to Kurt Schrader in the general election due in part to personal issues that Mannix brought up in the primary. Other accomplishments Mannix serves as president for several organizations, including the Oregon Anti-Crime Alliance, which he founded in 2008, and Common Sense For Oregon, which he founded in 2009. He is a member of the board of directors for the Salem Catholic Schools Foundation, a role he has served since 1985, and has been president of the foundation since 2000. Mannix was a founder and has served as chairman of the board of directors for Blanchet Catholic School in Salem since it opened in 1995, is a member of the Knights of Columbus and has been a member of Rotary International since 1982. Mannix has served on the national board of directors for Life Directions and the Salem Chamber of Commerce board of directors from 2007 to 2013. Mannix is also a board member, and vice president, of the Johann Strauss Society of America Foundation. This organization was founded in 2013 and is dedicated to supporting the music heritage of Johann Strauss. Funding Mannix's main financial donor in his political career is Loren Parks, a businessman who is currently a resident of Nevada.

Guillelmus Alaunovicanus, c. 1275 ‚Äì March 1333) was a Franciscan friar and theologian, and bishop of Giovinazzo, who took his name from Alnwick in Northumberland. Little is known of his early life. By 1303 he was a licensed doctor of theology at Paris, being then listed among the few foreign masters who sided with Philip IV, king of France, in his dispute with Pope Boniface VIII. Alnwick also lectured at other European centres of learning, including Montpellier, Bologna and Naples. He must have returned to England sometime in the second decade of the 14th century, as he is recorded as the forty-second Franciscan regent master at Oxford University, when Henry Harclay was chancellor of the university. Alnwick's manuscript marginalia show that he was part of the contemporary debate which spread all over Europe, and which included the ideas of men such as Thomas Aquinas, Bonaventure, Henry of Ghent, Peter Auriol, James of Ascoli, Godfrey of Fontaines, Henry Harclay and Thomas Wilton. His main collaborator, however, was Duns Scotus, and it is this that has saved him from obscurity. He worked with Scotus in the production of his Commentary on the Sentences (Ordinatio), took down one of his Collationes, and compiled the long additions (Additiones magnae) which were meant to fill the gaps in the Ordinatio. But although Alnwick based his philosophy and theology on the fundamental starting points of Scotus's teaching, he diverged from his colleague when he disagreed. Alnwick participated in the general chapter of the Franciscan order held at Perugia in 1322, where he joined the theologians who drew up and signed the decree De paupertate Christi attacking the position on the poverty of the church as promulgated by Pope John XXII. In the last section of his Determinationes he argued that Christ and his apostles possessed nothing either personally or in common. This opposition to the papal position caused John to initiate proceedings against Alnwick, who fled to Naples, where King Robert protected him. In 1330, Robert had him appointed bishop of Giovinazzo.

His widespread business interests gave him entree into domestic and international political affairs where he enjoyed privileged access to many influential power brokers at the top levels of government. His special arena of interest was Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Biography and diplomatic activity Crane was the eldest son of plumbing parts mogul, Chicago manufacturer, Richard T. Crane. As a young man, Crane traveled extensively with his friend Charles B. Cory, a leading ornithologist whom Crane had met while visiting Boston. Crane and Cory shared an interest in baseball, and from 1888 to 1892, the pair funded and played on the Hyannis town team in what is now the Cape Cod Baseball League. At Cory and Crane's expense, various well-known professional and amateur players were brought in to play alongside the Hyannis locals. When Cory lost his family's fortune in 1906, Crane purchased Cory's vast collection of bird specimens and donated it to Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History with the stipulation that the museum would employ Cory as permanent curator of the collection. In the 1900s, he brought Thomas Masaryk, Maksim Kovalevsky and Pavel Milyukov to lecture at the University of Chicago. After meeting Masaryk, he became interested in Slavic nationalism and sponsored The Slav Epic paintings by Alphonse MuchaAn Introduction to the Work of Alphonse Mucha and Art Nouveau, lecture by Ian Johnston of Malaspina University-College, Nanaimo, British Columbia (March 2004). When Mucha designed the Czechoslovak bills, he used a previous portrait of Josephine Crane Bradley as Slavia for the 100 koruna bill.

Crane (left) and James Farley stand behind Franklin D. Roosevelt in Warm Springs, Georgia, December 7, 1931. Crane contributed heavily to Woodrow Wilson's 1912 election campaign. Wilson rewarded Crane with appointments to the 1917 Special Diplomatic Commission to Russia, known as the Root Commission, as a member of the American Section of the Paris Peace Conference, and to the 1919 Inter-Allied Commission on Mandates in Turkey that became known as the King-Crane Commission. While the commission was originally proposed by the US to develop an international consensus on the future make up and status of postwar Middle East nations, the commission quickly became a US- only sponsored effort. With the appointment of Crane as co-head of the commission, it set about to issue a report to inform US policy makers. In respect to the creation of a Jewish state in the Middle East, the report cautioned \\"Not only you as president but the American people as a whole should realize that if the American government decided to support the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, they are committing the American people to the use of force in that area, since only by force can a Jewish state in Palestine be established or maintained.\\" Crane opposed the establishment of a Jewish state in the Middle East.F.W.

As the southeastern portion of the city, East Oakland takes up the largest portion of the city's land area. The area is a major hub of Northern California's black community, with over 50% of East Oakland's inhabitants being black. According to figures from a 2000 U.S. Census, over 87,000 people reside in the East Oakland area. Geography East Oakland stretches between Lake Merritt in the northwest and San Leandro in the southeast. It generally has a diagonal layout. East Oakland has numbered avenues (1st to 109th) that run northeast to southwest, and numbered streets (East 7th to East 38th) that run northwest to southeast. Interstates 580 and 880 also run northwest to southeast. Main northwest‚Äìsoutheast thoroughfares include East 14th Street (renamed International Blvd. in 1996 within the city of Oakland only), MacArthur Blvd., Foothill Blvd., Bancroft Avenue, and San Leandro Street (being the main one for commercial vehicles). Main northeast-southwest thoroughfares include Fruitvale Ave., 35th Ave., High St., Seminary Ave., 73rd Ave. (which becomes Hegenberger Road south of International Blvd. to Oakland International Airport), and 98th Ave. East Oakland is home to Holy Names University, Mills College, the Oakland Zoo, the Oakland Coliseum and Oakland Arena.US Navy painting crew at the East Oakland Youth Development Center, 2006 History East Oakland is a section of Oakland that has experienced many changes to its population as the West attracted immigrants in search of employment. Oakland was declared a city in 1852 where it was prominently populated by people who made it to the west during the Gold Rush. The dominant races that had relocated to the East Bay during the late 1840s were Caucasian, Chinese, Mexican, and African American. = East Oakland Culture-Early 1900s = By 1910, Oakland had the largest African American population in the East Bay because it tripled in the previous decade as a result of fires and earthquakes in the surrounding areas. Despite the new influx of African Americans, the East Oakland hills were known as ‚Äúthe Bible Belt‚Äù because of the white, Protestant community that occupied those houses. This area supported the Ku Klux Klan which shows that even in the East Bay there was racial tension and segregation. In the 1920s, East Oakland was restricted from ethnic minorities unless they worked as servants for the white. Those who did not work as servants were hit by the Great Depression in the late 1920s and early 1930s which caused employment to drop by 41 percent in three years. = Surrounding Roads = In the 19th century, the Oakland-San Leandro Road was a county road connecting Oakland with San Leandro. Along this road, small settlements developed such as Melrose, Elmhurst and Fitchburg. All these were annexed by the city of Oakland after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. After annexation, the Oakland-San Leandro Road was renamed East 14th Street which lasted for most of the 20th century, until it was renamed International Blvd. Both Foothill Boulevard and MacArthur Boulevard, which run through the heart of East Oakland, were a part of the Lincoln Highway, the first transcontinental highway, from 1913 until 1927. = Post WWII = In the spring of 1943, there was an increase of immigrants to the Bay Area as a result of World War II; this time is called ‚Äúthe Second Gold Rush‚Äù. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, the US government invested large sums of money on defense which created new jobs and opportunities on the coast and in the bay specifically. Because this was shortly after the great depression, many people were unemployed and looking for work, which was in abundance in the Oakland shipyard. Rather than an influx of whites, the new rush caused a surge of racial minorities which caused a restructuring of the demographics in the area. With the increase of workers, a housing crisis soon followed. In the city, there was push back from the Apartment House Owners Association and the Real Estate Board to build more housing so there were only five hundred public housing units built which also resulted in the destruction of other temporary housing units which displaced a large number of immigrants who had been living in them. Immigrants were forced to live in overcrowded quarters and even started sleeping on the streets because the housing that was being built was reserved for whites so minorities were pushed out of the city and forced to relocate to the outskirts of East Oakland. With the redistribution of living, this area, known as Brooklyn (until it was also annexed by the city in 1909) became the backbone of Oakland's African American community and caused an exodus of more prosperous whites to suburbs south and east of the city, such as San Leandro, Hayward and Walnut Creek. = Creation of the freeway = In the 1950s and 1960s, many areas of East Oakland still remained predominantly white. After the war, MacArthur Blvd., which was the main route from San Francisco, replaced by the MacArthur Freeway (580) which displaced many more African Americans living in the city and forced them to relocate to surrounding areas such as East Oakland where the African American population was now the predominant community in East Oakland. = Lack of property taxes = In 1969 the Economic Development Administration (EDA) declared that they would no longer fund large businesses or facilities but rather focus on creating jobs for the unemployed and poor, which in Oakland meant the ethnic minorities. A few years later, in 1978, California passes Proposition 13 which prevented African Americans from expanding their public zone with the property taxes, which caused the value of the area to significantly decline as the whites moved out. The mayor at the time, Lionel Wilson, who was the first African American mayor, elected the year prior in 1977, combatted the regulation on property taxes by using many public resources to create investment in downtown Oakland which increased the cost of living in the city and pushed more poor and marginalized populations to surrounding areas such as East Oakland. This is one example of gentrification that has occurred in the city and makes the cost of living higher in the city so the original residents are forced to relocate to the poor, underserved surrounding areas. With the new availability of jobs created by the EDA, between 1990 and 2000 more Latino and Asian (primarily Cambodian, Lao, and Chinese) immigrants moved to Oakland and specifically Central East Oakland because of how cheap the cost of living was compared to the city. A census on overcrowding showed an increase from 17 to 27 percent because of the new people who moved there. The majority of the new immigrants were Chicano/Latino who had a growth between 150 and 400 percent in that decade. That same time saw a decline in the African American population between 17 and 31 percent.  Demographics  Fruitvale has become the backbone of Oakland's Latino community, in which East Oakland had a rapid increase of 132% of Latinos between 1990 and 2000. Latinos make up 38% of the population of East Oakland. There is also a diverse Asian population, including Chinese, Vietnamese, Lao, and other southeast Asian ethnic groups generally inhabit the area of East Oakland closest to downtown, from Chinatown east to San Antonio. Asians make up a smatter percentage of only 4% of the population, but between 1990 and 2000 saw and increase of 13%. Between 1990 and 2000 both the white and black population of East Oakland saw a decrease in their populations by 24% and 16% respectively. Nonetheless, African Americans predominate in East Oakland, where they represent over 54% of East Oakland's residents. The deep east side has a population of roughly 15,000 residents and is 63% African American thus maintaining the highest concentration of African Americans in Northern California and the highest concentration of African Americans in California outside of Los Angeles. The Foothill Square neighborhood in East Oakland, located off of MacArthur Blvd., has the highest concentration of African American residents of any Oakland neighborhood, at 75.4%. Though the population of whites had decreased, they still made up 4% of the population. With the increase of the population between 1990 and 2000 the number of households in the area increased by 3.4%. The residents work in all kinds of job areas including service, sales, transportation, construction, and even management and professional positions while 9.1% of the population is unemployed. For the whites who stayed, it was often because they were too poor to relocate and saw an unemployment rate of 30%. In dominantly African American neighborhoods, such as Central East Oakland, between 40-70% of the population were without high school diplomas. The Latino population had 50-70% without high school diplomas and 5% with college degrees. Asians saw a smaller amount of the population without education with 39.3% without high school diplomas and 22.8% with bachelor's degrees.  Culture  East Oakland, together with West Oakland and portions of North Oakland, is a hub for Northern California's African American community. Hip hop culture is associated with East Oakland. It is known within the hip hop community as \\"Oaktown\\", \\"O-Town,\\" (old school names) or currently, \\"The Town\\". A number of East Bay rappers and singers such as Raphael Saadiq, Keak da Sneak, Dru Down, Too Short, Digital Underground, MC Hammer, Luniz, Hieroglyphics, Keyshia Cole, Philthy Rich, Db tha General, Shady Nate, Bobby Brackins, and Lil B originated there. The prostitution, violence and drug culture of the region spawned a new subgenre of hip hop by the late 1980s. Rappers like Too Short incorporated drugs, violence, prostitution and gang life into their music, in sharp contrast to much of the East Coast hip hop of the day. Too Short was also one of the first rap artists to promote and sell records independently and is one of the pioneers responsible for the birth of Northern California's independent hip hop scene; leading other artists to pursue success in the music industry without the assistance of a major record company. The sound of the music was different from East Coast hip hop, which is known for its technique of sampling and looping to create a song. Instead, funk and blues were infused with synthesizers and drum machines, giving birth to the Bay Area hip hop sound known as Mobb music. Today, mainstream hip-hop continues to lyrically and musically incorporate much of what was pioneered in East Oakland. Neighborhoods =Elmhurst= Elmhurst was originally a separate town, it was annexed by Oakland in 1909, and today is considered part of East Oakland. Although it was historically a white working-class neighborhood, it became predominantly African American after World War II, and today, Latinos now form about half of Elmhurst's population. Elmhurst was the site of one of the large carbarns for the Key System's streetcars, the Elmhurst Carhouse. Chevrolet opened an auto assembly plant in Elmhurst in 1915, which shut down in the 1960s. =Brookfield Village= Located near the Oakland International Airport. The main streets are 98th Avenue and Edes Avenue. The Brookfield District is located from 85th Avenue to 98th Avenue. Brookfield Village stops at the Union Pacific (formerly Southern Pacific) train tracks after Railroad Avenue. Brookfield Village was built during the early 1900s. It later had a home-building boom during World War II in response to the influx of workers needed for the war industries, on land which had been zoned for industrial uses. In the 1990s, the neighborhood held an annual summer get-together called the Never Worry Picnic as a contrast to a crime rate that is 191% higher than the national average. =Fruitvale= * Dimond District * Laurel * Peralta Hacienda * Jingle Town =Lower Hills District= * Crocker Highlands * Glenview * Grass Valley * Lakeshore * Lincoln Highlands * Tuxedo * Redwood Heights =Central/Deep East Oakland= * Arcadia ParkArcadia Park, Oakland, CA neighborhood  Nextdoor * Arroyo Viejo * Blandon/Glenly/Fontaine * Brookfield Village * Canyon Oaks * Castlemont * Castlewood/Flintridge * ColiseumColiseum, Oakland, CA neighborhood  Nextdoor * Columbia GardensColumbia Gardens, Oakland, CA neighborhood  Nextdoor * Cox * Durant Square * Eastmont, Oakland, California, the location of Eastmont Town Center, the last surviving indoor shopping mall in Oakland.

The vertical height of each bar depicts the 95% confidence interval. The difference between expected age at death in the top and bottom income percentiles is 10.1 years (95% CI, 9.9‚Äì10.3 years) for women and 14.6 years (95% CI, 14.4‚Äì14.8 years) for men. To control for differences in life expectancies across racial and ethnic groups, race and ethnicity adjustments were calculated using data from the National Longitudinal Mortality Survey and estimates were re-weighted so that each income percentile bin has the same fraction of black, Hispanic, and Asian adults. East Oakland experiences a lower life expectancy, relative to nearby neighborhoods like Alameda County, approximating 72 years. Amongst the heavily populated races present within Oakland, Hispanics lead in life expectancy, averaging 82 years. African Americans and Whites typically average 67‚Äì68 years within Oakland, while Asians live nearly 78 years. Conversely, there is a high all-cause mortality rate amongst the East Oakland community, leading in cancer, stroke, heart disease, and homicide death rates. It is found that communities and families of lower socioeconomic status typically experience higher mortality rates and lower survival rates compared to those from higher socioeconomic status. = Health Conditions = East Oakland displays a significantly higher rate of common health conditions, with residents cumulatively experiencing 32% obesity, compared to 21% amongst all of California. Nearly 32% of adults in the community is at fair or poor health, relative to Alameda County's 15% and California's 16%. Similar patterns are also prevalent in children ages 0‚Äì17, with approximately 48% of children diagnosed with obesity, compared to 29% within the state of California. 13% of children in East Oakland also experience fair or poor health, a rate much higher than that of California (7%) or Alameda County (5%). Amongst older adults, due to increases in disabilities (accounting for 42% of disabilities), there is a greater onset of chronic diseases, accounting for 64% of deaths primarily in cancer, heart diseases, Alzheimer's, stroke, and respiratory diseases. As an effort to improve these existing conditions, East Oakland has become one of 14 different site across the state of California to participate in a 10-year comprehensive community initiative dedicated to improving and supporting a healthy community through active collaborations among youths, residents, and community partners within three Action Teams: Health Happens in Schools, Health Happens in Neighborhoods and Health Happens through Culture, Arts, Storytelling & Healing. = Healthcare Access = Adults in East Oakland are more likely to visit emergency rooms than go to doctor's visits within the past year than many other counties in the Bay Area and in the entire state of California. In 2012, 35% of the community did not meet with their doctor, resulting in approximately 30% of residents taking advantage of the emergency room, relative to 13% in Alameda County and 18% in all of California. Amongst all ER visits, Blacks and Hispanics had the most frequent visits in 2011, with four times more visits compared to whites and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Furthermore, even when having healthcare coverage, Blacks continue to be the highest users of the emergency department, with 15% enrolled in governmental programs whilst consisting of 43% of frequent ER users. Amongst elderly adults, rising numbers in disabilities have resulted in increased hospital emergency visits. Heart disease, leading in chronic diseases amongst elders, accounts for over 19,500 hospitalizations each year. However, racial, linguistic, cultural, and cost barriers continue to influence level of access amongst the population. = Healthcare Coverage = East Oakland ranks amongst the lowest communities to provide healthcare coverage to adults and children. 52% of adults and 40% of children remain insured by private insurance companies, compared to 61% and 57% coverage throughout the state of California. East Oakland residents are one of the higher users of governmental health programs like Medi-Cal and Medicare, covering 27% of adults and 58% of children in the population, almost 30% higher than that of California. In the elderly population, 98% of older adults within the entire Alameda County have health insurance. However, due to rising costs in medical care in recent decades, the California Health Interview Survey observed that 48.5% of adults age 60+ let go of their insurance coverage. Amongst Hispanics, nearly 74% were enrolled in government health insurance, such as Medi-Cal and Healthy Families. Median income amongst enrolled Hispanic families is $16,800, whereas non-enrolled Hispanics receive a median annual income of $19,200. The average family household enrolled in health insurance amongst Hispanics is approximately 4-6 people.  Food and Liquor Stores  Along with the socioeconomic disparities that people in East Oakland face, is the issue of food scarcity. East Oakland is considered a food desert because of the lack of access to affordable, healthy, fresh food. Some studies have found that food was considered one of the highest priorities and came second to shelter. The participants claim that they knew how to eat healthy and about the importance of a nutritious diet, but the availability and cost of the food outweighed potential health outcomes. The people were more concerned about getting enough food that they would not starve rather than focusing on the nutrition of what they were eating. With the changes in state funding to housing and the movement of impoverished groups in the 1930s, East Oakland became an area where poorer people lived which also resulted in a major loss of industry as businesses and markets started to close down and relocate to more financially sustainable areas. As time went on, supermarkets and other businesses saw East Oakland as an ‚Äúundesirable place for residential and commercial investment‚Äù so few new stores opened up in place of the ones that left. The smaller commercial stores that did stick around were forced to raise the prices of their food and focus more on selling alcohol and tobacco products to stay afloat. In the flatlands of East Oakland there are only four supermarkets and over 40 liquor stores. Alcohol was easy to sell and made the stores more money, but the number of liquor stores is proportional to the levels of crime in violence in the area. Additionally, the majority of the population of East Oakland are Latinos and African Americans, both groups who have higher predisposition to alcohol-related diseases. As far as the stores that do sell food, a study by YPAR (Youth Participatory Action Research) 2.0 showed that the most available foods were chips, soda, and candy. Because it is cheap and available, these are the foods that people buy although they have little to no nutritional value and make people at a higher risk for diabetes, obesity, and other health problems. YPAR 2.0 is a method of conducting research done by the youth in the community to try and address the problems they and their families face. By going across East Oakland and classifying it as a food desert and critiquing the limited access to healthy food, they pushed for liquor and corner stores to have fresh produce and nutritious staple foods visible and affordable to the members of the community. As a result, stores responded and started to sell fresh produce from local farmers and receive deliveries twice a week for fresh produce.

Pope Pius XII named him cardinal in 1953. He served as Secretary of the Holy Office in the Roman Curia from 1959 to 1966 when that dicastery was reorganised as the Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith, of which he was Pro-Prefect until 1968. Ottaviani was a prominent figure in the Church during his time and was the leading conservative voice at the Second Vatican Council.  Early Life and education Ottaviani was born in Rome, where his father was a baker. He studied with the Brothers of the Christian Schools in Trastevere, then at the Pontifical Roman Seminary and the Pontifical Roman Athenaeum S. Apollinare, from where he received his doctorates in philosophy, theology, and canon law. He was ordained to the priesthood on 18 March 1916.  Holy Office/Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith  Arms of Ottaviani On 12 January 1953, he was both appointed Pro- Secretary of the Holy Office and created Cardinal-Deacon of Santa Maria in Domnica by Pope Pius XII. He participated as a cardinal-elector in the 1958 conclave which elected Pope John XXIII. On 7 November 1959, he was named the Vatican's chief doctrinal guardian as Secretary of the Holy Office. Ottaviani was appointed Titular Archbishop of Berrhoea on 5 April 1962, receiving his episcopal consecration on the following 19 April from Pope John XXIII himself, with Cardinals Giuseppe Pizzardo and Benedetto Aloisi Masella serving as co- consecrators. His episcopal motto Semper idem (\\"Always the same\\") reflected his conservative theology. He resigned his titular see in 1963. = Second Vatican Council = Ottaviani was the leader of the curial conservatives during the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965), despite being nearly blind throughout the entire course of the council. At the council Ottaviani worked with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre and others. During the last of the council's preparatory sessions, Ottaviani engaged in a heated debate with Cardinal Augustin Bea over the subject of religious liberty.SSPX. The Role of the Priestly Society of St. Pius X in the Heart of the Church January 1982 Ottaviani, while opposed to the separation of Church and State and granting equal rights to all religions, supported religious tolerance if public manifestations of non-Catholic religions were suppressed when possible. Their confrontation became so intense that Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini had to intervene, noting his disappointment at such a \\"serious discussion\\". Ottaviani also argued during the debates on the liturgyTime Magazine. The Cardinal's Setback November 23, 1962EWTN.

Council Reminiscences January 22, 2007 which are understood as Scripture and Tradition in Catholic theology. In 2000, John L. Allen wrote that the news media often went to Ottaviani during the council for colorful reactions to stormy working sessions: in one speech at the council, reacting to repeated mentions of \\"collegiality\\" of bishops, Ottaviani pointed out that the Bible records only one example of the apostles acting collegially, at the Garden of Gethsemane: \\"They all fled.\\"; republished as . Of this book, Allen later said: \\"If I were to write the book again today, I'm sure it would be more balanced, better informed, and less prone to veer off into judgment ahead of sober analysis\\"; and he accepted that the book had correctly been described as \\"Manichean journalism\\" (John L. Allen, Jr, \\"Pondering the first draft of history\\" in National Catholic Reporter, 26 April 2005). In 1985 Patrick R. Granfield had already recounted the same anecdote as something that \\"may well be apocryphal\\" and attributed it not to Ottaviani but to \\"one Council Father\\".Patrick R. Granfield, \\"\`Presidential Address: The Uncertain Future of Collegiality\\" (Proceedings of the Catholic Theological Society of America 40/1985, p. 97 According to Allen, Ottaviani was opposed in the movements for a rapid council by German Cardinal Josef Frings of Cologne. Frings often clashed with Ottaviani on which direction the council should take. In this, he was assisted by \\"a [then] progressive firebrand\\" who was \\"dissatisfied with many of the answers offered by the Church's official authorities\\", a young theological advisor named Joseph Ratzinger, who would later become prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and then Pope Benedict XVI. Frings had heard a lecture of the young Ratzinger on issues the upcoming council could address. It seemed to Frings that Ratzinger had set forth a complete agenda for the council that was exactly what Frings himself had in mind. Frings had Ratzinger prepare the text of a lecture that Frings was to give in Rome. After the lecture, which Pope John XXIII complimented warmly, Frings told the Pope that he did not deserve credit for the speech, as it was written by one of his priests. Pope John admitted that he too delegated much of his work. The key thing was to select the right person for the job. After this conversation, Ratzinger became Frings's lead assistant during the entire council and thereafter never left Frings's service.\\"My Brother, the Pope\\", Georg Ratzinger, pp. 190-1\\" The acrimony felt by such liberal members of the council against Ottaviani spilled out into international news in a dramatic incident on November 8, 1963, which Protestant observer Robert MacAfee Brown described as having \\"blown the dome off St. Peter's\\": in a working session of the council, Frings declared Ottaviani's dicastery a \\"source of scandal\\" to the whole world. With continued worldwide interest in Vatican II, another internal matter concerning the proceedings of the council concerning Ottaviani found its way into international news. During the October 30, 1962, session concerning changes to the Mass, he went beyond the 10-minute limit imposed on all speakers. Upon Ottaviani passing this mark Cardinal Eug√®ne Tisserant, Dean of the Council Presidents showed his watch to the council president for the day Cardinal Bernard Alfrink of Utrecht (whom the Associated Press described as \\"one of the most outspoken members...who want to see far-reaching changes inside the church.\\"). Ottaviani engrossed in his topic went on condemning the proposed changes, saying \\"Are we seeking to stir up wonder, or perhaps scandal, among the Christian people, by introducing changes in so venerable a rite, that has been approved for so many centuries and is now so familiar? The rite of Holy Mass should not be treated as if it were a piece of cloth to be refashioned according to the whim of each generation.\\" When he had reached fifteen minutes Alfrink rang a warning bell. When Ottaviani kept speaking, Alfrink signalled to a technician who switched off the microphone. After tapping the microphone to determine it was off, the half-blind Ottaviani stumbled back to his seat in humiliation while \\"there was scattered applause in the council hall\\" by members of the council fathers who held that he had gone on too long. Scandalized by the reaction of his fellow council fathers, Ottaviani boycotted the next six council working sessions. When Cardinal Ernesto Ruffini of Palermo presided over the 11 November session he announced that \\"Ottaviani had been grieved by the 30 October incident\\" and asked council fathers to refrain from voicing approval or disapproval with applause. The Associated Press noted that \\"Ironically, the incident...[was] favorably commented on by the non-Catholic observers attending the council, who were struck by the process and freedom of expression at the council\\". As he was president of the Theological Commission responsible for amending the schema on sources of religion, Ottaviani returned to the working session to champion the position of those the Associated Press called \\"the static traditionalists\\". = Papal conclave of 1963 = Ottaviani was one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 1963 papal conclave, which selected Giovanni Battista Montini as Pope Paul VI. He was also the Protodeacon (senior Cardinal-Deacon) during the conclave, and as such, he announced Montini's election and crowning him on 30 June with the triregnum. = Work and retirement from the Roman Curia = With the change of the name of the Holy Office to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1965, Ottaviani was named Pro-Prefect of the congregation; the pope held the title of \\"Prefect\\" until 1968. He was raised to the rank of Cardinal-Priest (with the same title) on 26 June 1967. As Pro- Prefect Ottaviani had described himself as a \\"policeman\\" who protected traditional doctrine. On 8 January 1968 Ottaviani resigned from the church's central administration. Pope Paul VI accepted the resignation and appointed Cardinal Franjo Seper of Yugoslavia to take his place as Pro-Prefect for the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. The event was seen as \\"a major turning point\\" by the Associated Press, noting he was being replaced \\"by a prelate from a Communist country that once imprisoned a Catholic cardinal...In dramatic fashion it signified the move of the half-billion-member church away from rigid conservatism toward new experiments in modernism and changing relations with Communist countries.\\" In 1970, when Paul VI restricted voting in papal conclaves to cardinals under the age of 80, Ottaviani, already 80, said the Pope's action was \\"an act committed in contempt of tradition that is centuries old\\" and that he was \\"throwing overboard the bulk of his expert and gifted counselors\\". Ottaviani died on 3 August 1979.  Impacts and influences  = Karl Rahner = At the beginning of 1962, Ottaviani notified the Jesuit superiors of theologian Karl Rahner that Rahner had been placed under Roman pre-censorship. That meant that the prolific theology professor could no longer publish or lecture without permission. A few months later, in November 1962, Pope John XXIII appointed Rahner to be peritus (an expert advisor) to and at the Second Vatican Council. Since Rahner accompanied the Cardinal Archbishop of Vienna, Franz K√∂nig, as a theological consultant, Ottaviani did not throw Rahner out of the council in spite of the earlier silencing.I Remember: An Autobiographical Interview With Meinold Krauss, Crossroad Publishing, 1985, pages 13 and 64. = \\"Ottaviani Intervention\\" = On 25 September 1969, Ottaviani and Cardinal Antonio Bacci wrote a letter to Paul VI in support of a study by a group of theologians who under the direction of Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre criticized the new Order of Mass (in Latin, novus Ordo Missae), and the new General Instruction (in Latin, Institutio Generalis), two sections (in not quite definitive form) of the revision of the Roman Missal that was promulgated on 3 April of that year but that actually appeared in full only in 1970. This letter became widely known as the \\"Ottaviani Intervention\\" and is often appealed to by Traditionalist Catholics as support for their opposition to the revision of the Roman Rite Mass.Text of the \\"Ottavani Intervention\\" = Ecclesiastical procedure in cases of solicitation = In 1962, as head, under the Pope, of the Holy Office, Ottaviani signed its document known by its incipit Crimen sollicitationis, which had as subtitle On the Manner of Proceeding in Cases of the Crime of Solicitation. It laid down detailed rules about the procedure for ecclesiastical tribunals to follow if a priest was accused of making sexual advances connected in any way with the sacrament of Confession.\\"Vel in actu sacramentalis confessionis; vel ante aut immediate post confessionem; vel occasione vel praetextu confessionis; vel etiam extra occasionem confessionis in confessionali sive in alio loco ad confessiones excipiendas destinato aut electo cum simulatione audiendi ibidem confessionem\\" (opening paragraph of the document). Judges and other officials of the tribunal (\\"each and everyone pertaining to the tribunal in any way\\") would be subject to automatic excommunication if they revealed anything about the conduct of the trial, even after the verdict had been declared and put into effect.Preliminaries 11 of the document This penalty did not apply to accusers and other witnesses;Preliminaries 13 of the document on the contrary, anyone with knowledge of the crime who failed to denounce it within one month was subject to automatic excommunication and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest or at least promising seriously to do so.Preliminaries 18 Violation of secrecy by the accused was also punished not by excommunication but by suspension.Preliminaries 13 In 2003, 24 years after Ottaviani's death, media reports presented this document as an attempt to \\"hide sexual abuse\\".The Age: \\"Hide sex abuse, secret Vatican paper instructs\\"1962 Vatican Document Some reported that even accusers were subjected to excommunication if they made their accusations known, and that the document was stored in the Vatican Secret Archives, where it was discovered by a lawyer pursuing cases on behalf of victims of abuse by Catholic priests.The GuardianCBS NewsManila Times In fact, the 69-page document was sent to \\"all Patriarchs, Archbishops, Bishops and other Local Ordinaries, including those of Eastern Rite\\" and was to be found, even if after forty years it was generally forgotten, among the papers in their successors' offices. While media reports also suggested that the ecclesiastical verdict was never to be made known, the document itself spoke of the verdict being \\"declared\\" and \\"put into effect\\",Section 11 of the document and the punishments laid down in canon law were: \\"He is to be suspended from celebrating Mass and hearing sacramental confessions and, if the gravity of the crime calls for it, he is to be declared unfit for hearing them; he is to be deprived of all benefices and ranks, of the right to vote or be voted for, and is to be declared unfit for all of them, and in more serious cases he is to be reduced to the lay state.\\"\\"Suspendatur a celebratione Missae et ab audiendis sacramentalibus confessionibus vel etiam pro delicti gravitate inhabilis ad ipsas excipiendas declaretur, privetur omnibus beneficiis, dignitatibus, voce activa et passiva, et inhabilis ad ea omnia declaretur, et in casibus gravioribus degradationi quoque subiiciatur\\" (Canon 2368). These punishments were of public character and not subject to secrecy. = Forbidden books = As Secretary of the Holy Office, Ottaviani was responsible for the banning of a number of books, which would accordingly have been included in any new edition of the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (Index of Prohibited Books). The Index, the last edition of which had been published in 1948, was abolished by Pope Paul VI in 1966.  Faustina Kowalska  On 6 March 1959, the Holy Office issued a notification that forbade circulation of \\"images and writings that promote devotion to Divine Mercy in the forms proposed by Sister Faustina\\" (emphasis in the original).Acta Apostolicae Sedis LI (1959), p. 271 Faustina Kowalska was a Polish nun who in her diary recounted conversations with Jesus Christ.Catherine M. Odell, Faustina (Our Sunday Visitor 1998) , p. 157 The negative judgement of the Holy Office was based on reasons that included its use of a faulty French or ItalianJohn L. Allen Jr, \\"A saint despite Vatican reservations\\" (National Catholic Reporter, 30 August 2002) translation of the diary. However, it was with Ottaviani's approval that Archbishop Karol Wojty≈Ça of Krak√≥w began in 1965 the informative process on Faustina's life and virtues, and the ban on her work was reversed by Pope Paul VI in 1978.  Maria Valtorta  Ottaviani was critical of the writings of the bed-ridden Italian mystic Maria Valtorta, who reported visions of Jesus and Mary. When the typed version of the 15,000 handwritten pages of Valtorta's notebooks was prepared by Romualdo Migliorini and Corrado Berti (both Servite priests), they sought Vatican guidance for procedural advice on presenting the reputed revelations to the proper ecclesiastical hierarchy, as the local bishop's (Fontevecchia) vision was fading. At the Vatican they encountered Monsignor Alphonso Carinci and Cardinal Augustin Bea, Pope Pius XII's confessor, who advised presenting the typed manuscript directly to Pope Pius XII, through a recommended intermediary, which was accomplished in 1947. Ten months later, Carinci and Bea facilitated a meeting between the Servite priests and Pope Pius XII and it was recorded in L'Osservatore Romano.L'Osservatore Romano, February 27, 1948. During the papal audience, Pope Pius XII reportedly said: \\"Publish this work as it is. There is no need to give an opinion about its origin, whether it be extraordinary or not. Who reads it, will understand.\\"Father Berti Events Berti signed an affidavit to this effect, stating that he had a verbal papal approval. However, once he approached the Vatican Press, he was summoned to the Holy Office, was seriously rebuked, and the Holy Office attempted to confiscate the original copies of Valtorta's writings.Valepic Valtorta's notebooks were published in 1950 by Michele Pisani as \\"Poem of the Man God\\". Ottaviani ordered Berti to silence. Augustin Bea, was a consultor of the Holy Office at the time it condemned the book, as was Dominican theologian Reginald Garrigou- Lagrange. A year after the death of Pius XII, Ottaviani placed the work among the list of books he presented to the newly appointed Pope John XXIII, who signed the decree banning all the books on the list.Fr. Berti's annotations to Maria Valtorta's Libro di Azaria (Book of Azaria), Edizioni Pisani, 1972.

He started his professional life as a tax attorney with the Internal Revenue Service. He has been the head of the White Sox and Bulls for over 35 years. He made his initial fortune in real estate, taking advantage of the Frank Lyon Co. v. United States decision by the United States Supreme Court which allowed economic owners of realty to sell property and lease it back, while transferring the tax deduction for depreciation to the title owner. As the owner and chairman of the Chicago Bulls since 1985, he oversaw the franchise turning into a lucrative business that won six NBA Championships in the 1990s (1991‚Äì1993 and 1996‚Äì1998). He is controversial for his involvement (along with Jerry Krause) in breaking up the championship team by not hiring back Phil Jackson. He hired Michael Jordan as a baseball player during his sabbatical from basketball. He also moved the Bulls from Chicago Stadium to the United Center. Since purchasing the White Sox in 1981, the franchise made the playoffs in 1983 for the first time since 1959, and won the World Series in 2005 for the first time since 1917. Reinsdorf moved the White Sox from Comiskey Park to New Comiskey Park in 1991 (now known as Guaranteed Rate Field). In both sporting endeavors, he has developed a reputation as an anti-labor union hardliner. Since the early 1990s, he has been considered one of the most, if not the most, influential basketball owners. He has been influential in instituting the salary cap and revenue sharing. On April 4, 2016, Reinsdorf was elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a contributor. Background Reinsdorf was born to a Jewish family in Brooklyn, New York.Jewish Telegraph Agency: \\"Forbes‚Äô billionaires list features new and old Jewish faces\\" By Gabe Friedman March 2, 2015 He attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn,\\"The Rumble: AN OFF-THE-BALL LOOK AT YOUR FAVORITE SPORTS CELEBRITIES\\" , New York Post, December 31, 2006. Accessed December 13, 2007. \\"The five Erasmus Hall of Fame legends include Raiders owner Al Davis, Bears quarterback Sid Luckman, Yankee pitching great Waite Hoyt, Billy Cunningham and Knicks founder Ned Irish. Other sports notables include Bulls/White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf, chess champion Bobby Fischer, ex-Browns head coach Sam Rutigliano, legendary NBA referee Norm Drucker and \\"Boys of Summer\\" author Roger Kahn.\\" and he was the son of a sewing machine salesman. A lifelong baseball fan who grew up in the shadows of Ebbets Field, Reinsdorf was in the stands the day Jackie Robinson debuted for the Brooklyn Dodgers, breaking the color barrier which prevented black players from serving on Major League teams. Reinsdorf earned a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in Washington, D.C. where he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi. He subsequently moved to Chicago in 1957. Reinsdorf became a CPA and lawyer as well as a registered mortgage underwriter and a certified review appraiser. He leveraged a full scholarship offer from the University of Chicago Law School into a scholarship from the Northwestern University School of Law. His first job after graduating from Northwestern in 1960 was a tax delinquency case of Bill Veeck who at the time owned the White Sox. In 1964, Reinsdorf went into private practice. He developed a specialty in real estate partnership tax shelters. He sold his business interests in the real estate partnership in 1973 and formed Balcor, which raised US$650 million to invest in buildings under construction. He sold Balcor in 1982 for $102 million to Shearson Lehman Brothers, the investment banking and brokerage arm of American Express. However, he continued to be President of the company for several years thereafter. Sports ownership =New purchases= In 1981 he was wealthy enough to purchase the White Sox for $19 million. The purchase was brokered by American National Bank who arranged for a limited partnership. He followed previous eccentric White Sox owners Charles Comiskey, who was known as a miser, and Veeck, who was known as a prankster who gutted the team by trading away promising prospects. Soon after buying the White Sox, he signed Greg Luzinski and Carlton Fisk. He also tripled the team promotional budget and increased the number of team scouts from 12 to 20. By the 1983 Major League Baseball season the White Sox made the playoffs with the best record in the Major Leagues. The team initially signed a television deal with the newly founded Sportsvision under the new leadership of Chairman Reinsdorf and Vice Chairman Eddie Einhorn, but that arrangement quickly fizzled. Einhorn continued as Vice Chairman of the White Sox until his death in 2016. In 1985, following in the footsteps of Einhorn who had purchased the United States Football League's Chicago Blitz franchise in 1984, he purchased the Chicago Bulls as part of a syndicate for US$16 million and quickly turned the team from one that averaged 6,365 fans per game at the 17,339-seat Chicago Stadium in 1985 into one with an 8,000-person season ticket waiting list. He did so by drafting Horace Grant and Scottie Pippen, and trading for Bill Cartwright to join John Paxson and Michael Jordan under the tutelage of head coach Doug Collins. In 1989, the team signed Phil Jackson as the final piece of the championship puzzle. From November 20, 1987 through Jordan's 1999 retirement, the Bulls sold out every game. In the months prior to the purchase, Milwaukee businessman Marvin Fishman had been awarded a $16.2 million judgment against the Bulls. Fishman had been illegally blocked from purchasing the team in 1972. Reinsdorf purchased the team from an ownership group that included Lamar Hunt, George Steinbrenner, Walter Shorenstein, Jonathan Kovler, Lester Crown, Philip Klutznick, and the estate of Arthur Wirtz, and he held a $9.2 million controlling interest in the team. Reinsdorf's share of 56.8% of the team was purchased from Klutznick, Steinbrenner, Shorenstein and the estate of Wirtz. His purchase ended an era in which the Bulls were managed by committee with decisions by conference call, verdicts by vote. Reinsdorf acquired his majority interests on March 11, 1985 and Kovler sold his 7% stake in the team on January 29, 1986, bringing Reinsdorf's interest to 63%. The following week Reinsdorf ousted Rod Thorn as general manager and replaced him with Jerry Krause. =Ownership history= The White Sox have won American League regular season Division Championships in 1983, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2008 under Reinsdorf and they won the 2005 World Series. In addition, they were in first place of the central division at the conclusion of the strike-shortened 1994 Major League Baseball season. The World Series victory made him only the third owner in the history of North American sports to win a championship in two different sports. The baseball championship boosted the value of the franchise to over $300 million. When Reinsdorf signed Jordan after Jordan's announcement that he wanted to play baseball, many thought Jordan's drawing power provided an ulterior motive. Reinsdorf, however, had tried to convince Jordan not to give up basketball, but he did not attempt to make Jordan the highest paid player in the game like some feel he should have. As a basketball owner, he has been described by Time as a \\"cheapskate\\", a reference they also use for his baseball persona. As of 1995, the time when Scottie Pippen was eager to either be traded or be rid of Krause, he had never renegotiated a contract. As a baseball owner, he has had a reputation as one of the most militant, anti- union, hard-line owners. Newsweek described him as \\"one of the hardest heads in the 1994 baseball strike\\". In the baseball offseason between the 1992 and 1993 seasons, he completely abstained from the free agent market. Reinsdorf was one of the last holdouts to the 1996 labor agreement that instituted the salary cap while retaining arbitration rights for the players. His 1996 signing of Albert Belle made news because of his widely publicized general opposition to spiraling player salaries. The $55 million signing was a turning point in the decision by the baseball owners to agree to revenue sharing. The signing also made Reinsdorf the employer of the highest paid Major League Baseball player and highest paid professional basketball player (Jordan) at the same time. Reinsdorf had just re-signed Jordan after the 1995‚Äì96 NBA season. However, Jordan had been underpaid most of his career, and Reinsdorf, who did not feel he could justify the $30 million salary from a business standpoint, immediately realized he was going to soon feel buyer's remorse. Even his most successful baseball team was not highly paid: when the White Sox won the 2005 World Series, Reinsdorf had the 13th highest payroll of the 30 Major League Baseball teams. After Reinsdorf purchased the team in 1981, the White Sox experienced erosion of fan and media support. He complained about old Comiskey Park with its foibles such as numerous obstructed view seats and threatened to move the White Sox. Among his threats was moving the team to Itasca or Addison, Illinois in DuPage County. Reinsdorf, through his real estate business, purchased in Addison. Chicago Mayor Harold Washington lobbied the Illinois legislature, and subsequently then-Illinois Governor James R. Thompson promoted a package of incentives to retain the team in Chicago. The state floated bonds to build New Comiskey Park and let Reinsdorf keep all parking and concession revenues, as well as the $5 million per year from 89 skyboxes. Reinsdorf and Chicago Blackhawks owner, William Wirtz contributed $175 million to fund the construction of the largest arena in the United States. When the United Center opened in 1994 all of the skyboxes were leased for up to eight years. As per the collective bargaining agreement, Reinsdorf was allowed to exclude 60% of luxury suite revenue from \\"basketball-related income\\" and thus it is not part of the revenue sharing income. Reinsdorf is a powerful baseball owner who in 1988 stopped the sale of the Texas Rangers and later influenced the sale of the Seattle Mariners. Edward Gaylord and Gaylord Entertainment Company had first attempted to buy the Rangers in 1985. Reinsdorf was also said to be largely responsible for the ousting of Fay Vincent as the Commissioner of Baseball in 1992. He had previously undermined Vincent by employing Richard Ravitch as the league's labor negotiator at a salary higher than Vincent's. By the early 1990s, Reinsdorf and acting Baseball commissioner (as well as Milwaukee Brewers owner) Bud Selig had assumed baseball's mantle of power from Atlanta Braves owner, Ted Turner, and New York Yankees owner, George Steinbrenner, who had in turn taken over the sport from Brooklyn/Los Angeles Dodgers owner, Walter O'Malley, St. Louis Cardinals owner, Gussie Busch, and Oakland Athletics owner, Charlie O. Finley. In the 1980s, Reinsdorf, Bud Selig and the American League President colluded to dissuade the Philadelphia Phillies from signing Lance Parrish who was a Detroit Tigers free agent. During the strike, Reinsdorf, who was an anti-union hard-liner, was so pessimistic that he did not expect baseball to resume until the 1996 Major League Baseball season. In the early 1990s he was able to get new stadiums (United Center and New Comiskey Park) for his teams. Some fans and columnists have accused Reinsdorf of breaking up the championship Bulls team after their third straight title and sixth in eight years, claiming the Bulls could have competed for more titles with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and good support from the rest of the team that in the eight-year span included Dennis Rodman, Horace Grant, Toni Kukoƒç, Ron Harper, BJ Armstrong, and coach Phil Jackson. Some accounts claim that because Jackson feuded with both Reinsdorf and Krause and because both Jordan and Pippen were linked to Jackson, the team was broken up. Forbes describes the scenario as an example of owner greed. Many note that Phil Jackson's decision not to return as coach and Jordan's retirement during the 1998‚Äì99 NBA season lockout impacted the decisions of several players on whether to return to Chicago. While Reinsdorf had held out hope that he could convince Jackson and Jordan to return and thus had introduced Tim Floyd as President of Chicago Bulls Basketball Operations instead of head coach, according to film footage from documentary series \\"The Last Dance,\\" Krause had made it clear to Jackson that he was not wanted back. alternate link (paid) Reinsdorf was one of two bidders for the Phoenix Coyotes that would commit to not relocating the team. On July 29, 2009 Reinsdorf and his group were approved for ownership of the Coyotes for $148 million. In August 2009, it was reported that Jerry Reinsdorf & Ice Edge LLC had dropped its bid for the Coyotes, leaving only Balsillie and the NHL as bidders for the team. The NHL bid ultimately prevailed, however the league stated it wished to re-sell the franchise as soon as possible. On March 24, 2010, it was reported that Reinsdorf was once again a possible buyer for the Phoenix Coyotes. Reinsdorf had been working out an arrangement to make the deal more feasible with the municipality of Glendale, Arizona. As late as August 2011, negotiations between Reinsdorf and the City of Glendale were still in process for the purchase of the Coyotes. However, in 2013, the Coyotes were sold to IceArizona, a group of investors that did not include Reinsdorf. =Legacy= Reinsdorf is largely responsible for the revenue sharing of the internet rights of Major League Baseball in which all teams have shared equally since Major League Baseball Advanced Media (known as BAM) was established in 2000. Reinsdorf also endeavored to sell the naming rights to the New Comiskey Park to U.S. Cellular in a $68 million 20-year deal that funded a 7-year $85 million overhaul of the stadium that ended prior to the 2008 Major League Baseball season. The overhaul included the removal of top rows of the upper deck, replacement of the baby blue seats with traditionally-colored green ones and dozens of other upgrades. Prior to the seven-year overhaul, the 2001 White Sox barely broke even financially with a $700,000 operating profit on revenues of $101.33 million. Reinsdorf won a major revenue sharing legal battle with other NBA owners over the Chicago Bulls broadcasts on WGN-TV. The 55 game schedule on the superstation for an audience of 35 million competed with the NBA broadcasts, but Reinsdorf was permitted to maintain the contract. As recently as 2004, the Bulls continued to be the NBAs most profitable team, earning $49 million in operating income and having an estimated valuation of $356 million. Reinsdorf feels that if Major League Baseball Players Association chief Donald Fehr had not opposed steroid testing, baseball would have taken a stand against steroid use much sooner. He feels that in the end this delayed action will cost some players election into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

In 1983, the Chiat/Day advertising agency held a casting call in London, on behalf of their client, Apple Computer, for what would prove to be a landmark television commercial. The vision of the agency and director Ridley Scott stipulated an actress capable of running up to a large video screen, spinning with a sledgehammer, and releasing it at the video screen. Most of the models and actresses tested struggled to do this; one errant throw nearly struck a passerby at the Hyde Park casting call. She won the role with her ability to handle the hammer convincingly. \\"1984\\" The commercial officially aired only twice on American television. It was first screened in December 1983, right before the 1:00 am sign-off on KMVT in Twin Falls, Idaho, so that it would be eligible for advertising industry awards for that year. In addition, starting on January 17, 1984 it was screened prior to previews in movie theaters for a few weeks. Its best-known appearance was just after half-time of Super Bowl XVIII on 22 January 1984. Even with these limited appearances, the ad created such a media frenzy that it gained many subsequent free TV airings and print mentions, as it was discussed in the media. Major later portrayed \\"Nikita\\" in the Elton John 1985 music video for his song of the same name. As a spin-off, she released a single named \\"Moscow Nights\\" using the name Anya, and with that name, in 1987, she released another song named \\"One Word\\". In 2006, Andy Hertzfeld of the Macintosh development team incorrectly stated that Major had died of breast cancer in 2000. As of 2009, she was living in England with her husband Kim Rajah and their three children.

Chronicler Leonti Mroveli mentions that after the conversion of the King Mirian III of Iberia and the Queen Nana into Christianity in the early 4th century, St. Nino continued to preach among Georgian highlanders (·Éõ·Éó·Éò·É£·Éö·Éú·Éò, mtiulni) including Pkhovi.Kartlis Cxovreba (The Life of Kartli) in Georgian Medieval Georgia was never able to establish a typical feudal system. The civil code of the community remained based on the ancient traditions and values. Children of the noble families and lords were brought up by the families of peasants (·Éí·Éö·Éî·ÉÆ·Éò, glekhi) who were known for their wisdom and human qualities. These people introduced youth to their culture, history, traditions and all aspects of human knowledge and experiences based on Christian Orthodox values. (See Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church) Historically, Georgian highlander communities enjoyed a degree of autonomy. Khevsurs never accepted local lords; they elected their leaders or Khevisberi (·ÉÆ·Éî·Éï·Éò·É°·Éë·Éî·É†·Éò, elder) and council of elders and submitted themselves only to the monarch (see List of the Kings of Georgia). They were exceptional warriors with traditional Georgian qualities of courage, openness and honesty, fraternity, independence and love of freedom,GEORGIAN HISTORY, Ethnographic Study who were often promoted as royal bodyguards. Kings regarded them as reliable guardians of the Caucasus Mountains and the northern border of the kingdom. In the battles Khevsurs wore flags adorned with crosses and considered themselves permanent members of the army of the sacred flags and guardians of Georgian Kings. Khevsur woman. Photo by D.A. Nikitin, 1881. right There was a suggestion by Russian serviceman and ethnographer Arnold Zisserman who spent 25 years (1842‚Äì67) during Russian expansion in the Caucasus (see Georgia within the Russian Empire), that these Georgian highlanders were descendants of the last European Crusaders because their folk culture ‚Äì the material, social, and religious practices ‚Äì resembled those of the Crusaders.The photos by Vakhtang Chikovani Although claiming to have arrived at the speculation himself, the meme appears in earlier sources and was a popular story among non-Georgians in Tbilisi.Sherman, Ryan Michael.

He was a peasant vassal of a landlord in Kakheti, and to escape punishment for some crime which he had committed, he found refuge in the Pshav village of Apsho. From his two sons, Arabuli and Chinchara, originated the family of Arabuli, consisting of 320 homes, and the family of Chincharauli, with 210 homes.' ZISSERMANN, A.L., Twenty-five Years in the Caucasus, St.Petersburg: 1879 Narikala Publications, 2018 American traveler Richard Halliburton (1900‚Äì1939) saw and recorded the customs of the Khevsur tribe in 1935.Sword and Buckler Fighting among the Lost Crusaders. Excerpts of Halliburton's observations. The Khevsur men, dressed in chain mail and armed with broadswords, wore garments full of decoration made up of crosses and icons, which served as a means of protection according to Christianity which Georgia adopted early in 4th century. Greek historian Herodotus ( ‚Äì BC) notes that the Caucasian highlanders of that time, were brilliant knitters and embroiders of their dress or Chokha, which wore out but never faded from frequent usage. Young girls started knitting at the age of 6-7, but men studying and military training, because according to their tradition women were deprived from education and higher social status. The suggestion that any historical evidence indicates that Khevsurs may have descended from crusaders has been thoroughly discredited, and Georgian scholars have universally derided the story.

Khevsur dances also preserved in the national dances as a warrior dance Khevsuruli. Religion The Abuletart Fortress near Kistani, south of Shatili Their religion is a unique mixture of Georgian Orthodox Christianity and pre-Christian cults. They worship sacred places locally known as jvari (‚Äúcross‚Äô), khati (‚Äúicon‚Äù) or salotsavi (‚Äúsanctuary‚Äù). Aside from their religious character, these were the sites where the locals discussed and decided common matters such as raids against enemies, peace-making, appeals of various characters, etc. Even during the Soviet period, with its harsh restrictions against any religious activities, each year the Georgian highlanders gathered with a group of elder priests and performed their traditional rituals. Historical population figures As of the 1873 census, Khevsureti had the population of 4,872. By 1926, the population shrank to 3,885. Figures from the Russian imperial census of 1873 given in Dr. Gustav Radde's Die Chews'uren und ihr Land ‚Äî ein monographischer Versuch untersucht im Sommer 1876 (published by Cassel in 1878) divide the villages of Khevsureti into eight communities:For detailed tables, go to this page on Batsav.com * the Barisakho community: 16 villages, 298 households, consisting of 723 men and 718 women, totalling 1,441 souls * the Guli community: 8 villages, 162 households, consisting of 335 men and 356 women, totalling 691 souls * the Roshka community: 7 villages, 145 households, consisting of 335 men and 315 women, totalling 648 souls * the Batsaligo community: 9 villages, 131 households, consisting of 296 men and 288 women, totalling 584 souls * the Akhieli community: 5 villages, 111 households, consisting of 273 men and 240 women, totalling 513 souls * the Shatili community: 5 villages, 121 households, consisting of 252 men and 272 women, totalling 524 souls * the Ardoti community: 3 villages, 86 households, consisting of 198 men and 249 women, totalling 447 souls * the Tolaant-Sopeli community: 8 villages, 197 households, consisting of 555 men and 593 women, totalling 1,148 souls 1873 TOTAL: 61 villages, 1,251 households, consisting of 2,967 men and 3,029 women, in all 5,996 souls. These figures can be compared with those given in Sergi Makalatia's Khevsureti (Komunistis Stamba, Tbilisi: 1935; in Georgian):For detailed tables, go to this page on Batsav.com * the Barisakho community: 14 villages, 241 households, consisting of 467 men and 539 women, totalling 1,006 souls * the Batsaligo community: 19 villages, 291 households, consisting of 547 men and 639 women, totalling 1,186 souls * the Shatili community: 12 villages, 233 households, consisting of 528 men and 572 women, totalling 1,100 souls * the Arkhoti (Akhieli) community: 3 villages, 78 households, consisting of 123 men and 133 women, totalling 256 souls 1935(?) TOTAL: 43 villages, 769 households, consisting of 1,492 men and 1,668 women, in all 3,160 souls. There are, of course, many reasons for which a comparison of these two censuses would be a tricky and to some extent pointless exercise. For what it is worth, however, such a comparison does confirm a process of rural exodus during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries whereby the Khevsurs seem to have abandoned isolated or higher-altitude settlements and moved down-valley to live in villages benefiting from more clement climatic conditions (or perhaps even to live in towns further afield). Although these figures must of course be taken with a pinch of salt (in the sense that they are based upon data whose reliability is unproven and debatable to say the least), a comparison between the two years (1873 and 1935) reveals * a 14 per cent drop in the average number of men per household; * an 8 per cent drop in the average number of women per household; * an 8 per cent drop in the average number of households (families) per village; * a 19 per cent drop in the average number of inhabitants per village; and * a 35 per cent decrease in the region's total population (with more isolated regions losing more inhabitants e.g. the Shatili community 42% and the Akhieli community 50% than the others lower down the valleys). Migration Some disobedience offered by the Khevsurs to the Soviet ideology was a reason for obligatory migration to the plain initiated by the government in 1951. As a result, many high-mountainous villages were deserted. Economic hardship of the last two decades also increased a tendency towards migration. Traditions The fortress village Shatili. The Lebaiskari fortress. Like other mountainous areas of Georgia, Khevsureti is characterized by a great diversity of traditions and customs. Khevsurs speak a local dialect of the Georgian language that resembles the literary Georgian of the Middle Ages and retain many of their ancient traditions including elements of folk ritual.The institution of the Blood feud was still alive in the twentieth century. Khevsur music also resembles that of Georgia in the Middle Ages. Khevsureti is famous for its Medieval ballads and folk music. The traditional costume of Khevsureti includes a male upper garment called the Perangi. While this bears some resemblance to the classic Georgian Chokha, it is shorter and trapezoidal in shape and features a more powerful color balance and a greater use of cruciform decorative motifs. The architecture of Khevsureti is mostly highly fortified and defensive in character,featuring a profusion of towers clinging to the mountainsides,signifying constant vigilance in the face of enemy attack. The Khevsurs were renowned for their warfare with the (mostly Muslim) peoples of the Northern Caucasus including the Chechens,the Kists, and the many peoples of Dagestan. Due to the geographic,ethnic and religious complexity and lack of industrialization in the Greater Caucasus,it was a common occurrence for the tribes of the North Caucasus to attack and rob mountain-dwelling Georgians. Well-known Georgian poet Vazha Pshavela described the warfare of the Khevsurs in his poems. One of the most famous of these is Aluda Ketelauri, the eponymous hero of which is a Khevsur youth, famous for his bravery and warrior skills. One day, after the Khevsur village of Shatili,where he lived, had been invaded by the Kists (historical name for the Nakh peoples), Aluda followed the invaders and killed both of the robbers. However,after killing the 'Kist' called Mussah, Aluda began to weep,mourning for the warrior, in recognition of his bravery and dedication to his Muslim faith. When Aluda returned to Shatili he confessed to the villagers his admiration for the 'Kist' hero who had proved such a worthy adversary,but they were shocked at this praising of a 'pagan' and ended by condemning Aluda and expelling him from the community. The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica reported in 1911 that many curious customs still prevailed among the Khevsurs, as for instance the imprisonment of the woman during childbirth in a lonely hut, round which the husband parades, firing off his musket at intervals. After delivery, food was surreptitiously brought to the mother, who was kept in her prison a month, after which the hut was burnt. One of the more striking features of the traditional cultures of Khevsureti was the premarital relationship known as sts‚Äôorproba (or ts'ats'loba as it is known in Pshavi). A young couple could lie together during the night with a sword placed between them. Sexual intercourse between the pair was strictly forbidden. Any man who breached this rule was condemned to death. Dozens of fortifications, sanctuaries and churches are scattered across the province. Chief of these are the Khakhmati fortress, Akhieli fortress, Lebaiskari fortress, Mutso fortress, Shatili fortifications, Gudani Cross, and the Anatori Cross.

Lower end of Nicollet Island in 2006 Nicollet Island is an island in the Mississippi River just north of Saint Anthony Falls in central Minneapolis, Minnesota. According to the United States Census Bureau the island has a land area of and a 2000 census population of 144 persons. The island makes up a large part of the city-designated Nicollet Island/East Bank neighborhood. The island is named for cartographer Joseph Nicollet, who mapped the Upper Mississippi in the 1830s. The island lies in the middle of the Mississippi, crossed by the Hennepin Avenue Bridge connecting Downtown and Northeast Minneapolis. The island is so near to Saint Anthony Falls that if the northward movement of the falls had not been stopped in the late 19th century, the island would no longer exist. In the early 19th century Nicollet Island was one of six islands near the falls, but all the others have been destroyed or joined to the east bank. The island was the site of the first bridge across the Mississippi River, opened in 1855, on the site of the present Hennepin Avenue Bridge. It is part of Saint Anthony Falls Historic District, listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  History  = Native American history = Before the arrival of European settlers, the Minneapolis region was inhabited by the Sioux (Dakota) and Ojibwe people, to whom Saint Anthony Falls was a sacred site. The Sioux used the island as a birthing place, and according to their oral tradition for ceremonies such as the vision quest and as a neutral meeting site. = Settlement = Franklin Griswold's house at 163 Nicollet Street The original bridge across the Mississippi Nicollet Island and the rest of the area of the falls were opened to settlement in 1838. Several settlers tried to obtain the best land near the falls, of whom Fort Snelling's sutler, Franklin Steele, took the best part of the east bank including Nicollet Island. He purchased the land for $1.25 per acre, which comes to about $60 for the island. After Steele obtained proper title to his land in 1848, he turned his energies to building a sawmill at Saint Anthony Falls to cut lumber from upriver, which began operations in September 1848. He built a dam on the east channel of the river between Nicollet Island and Hennepin Island. Steele platted the townsite of St. Anthony, which became a large city before merging with Minneapolis in 1872, on the east bank of the river. In 1848, Steele started a ferry across the river on the present site of the Hennepin Avenue Bridge. In 1849 the first house was built on the island, for John Wesley and Ann Loomis North. Over the 1850s and early 1860s, more houses were built on the island, including several built by Franklin C. Griswold (some of which are extant, Griswold's own at 163 Nicollet Street). The island remained thickly covered with trees, and was described as a picturesque location frequented by lovers. A bridge was built between Nicollet Island and the east bank, and in 1854, Minneapolis and St. Anthony decided to build a bridge across the river. The suspension bridge that was built was the first ever to cross the Mississippi, and it opened with festivities on 23 January 1855. It was a toll bridge, originally charging 5 cents per pedestrian and 25 cents per team. The bridge was unsound and had limited capacity: photographs show signs that warned of fines for crossing too fast. The bridge brought the two communities closer together, leading to St. Anthony's later merge with Minneapolis. = Late 19th century = The Grove Street Flats Extensive development of the island began after it was bought by William W. Eastman and John L. Merriam in 1865. In 1866, Eastman and Merriam tried to sell the island to the city of Minneapolis, to be a park, but the proposal was rejected in a referendum. Eastman and Merriam began building mills on the south side of the island and the Hennepin Island tunnel, and residential buildings on the north side. The Hennepin Island tunnel extended from Nicollet Island to the south end of Saint Anthony Falls via Hennepin Island. The tunnel collapsed in 1869, and almost destroyed Saint Anthony Falls, necessitating the building of an artificial apron for the waterfall. After the failure of the tunnel, Eastman built a system of turbines and cables to provide hydropower to factories on the south end of the island, including the Island Power Building (razed in 1937, it contained a variety of shops), a plant of the Cedar Lake Ice Company, and the Island Sash and Door Company (now the Nicollet Island Inn). Eastman had his relatives and friends build their houses on the island, and built the Eastman and Grove Street Flats. Eastman's efforts lead many of the city's Gilded Age wealthy to live on the island, in the later decades of the 19th century. In 1876, a replacement suspension bridge across the Mississippi was opened. In 1867 the first railway bridge across the Mississippi in Minneapolis was built, separating the industrial south of the island and the residential north, as the Minneapolis BNSF Rail Bridge (an 1893 replacement) still does. In 1893, northeast Minneapolis was devastated by one of the most damaging fires in Minneapolis history, which started on Nicollet Island. In 1900 Lasallian Brothers started DeLaSalle High School on the island. = 20th century = The Grain Belt Beer sign, erected in the 1940s Nicollet Island and the East Bank, ca. 1955 From the 1910s, Nicollet Island and the rest of the Gateway District declined, and the flats and houses on Nicollet Island were subdivided to create cheaper housing. The island became a poor neighbourhood, owned by a few landlords, who provided little maintaince to its residential buildings. The family of Morris Lerner came to own much of the island, and ran the Island Grocery there. The Lerners were described as generous by sometime tenants and ran their store at a loss, but were described as slumlords by disgruntled tenants and the city newspapers. During the 1960s, David Lerner entered into a long and public dispute with Nicollet Island residents who formed a tenants union. The tenants picketed outside his store and his home on Cedar Lake, and in response Lerner told a newspaper that his tenants were either \\"nice ones\\" or \\"pigs\\", citing the poor condition his tenants left his properties in. In the 1940s, the iconic Grain Belt Beer sign was erected on the island, at the time one of the largest neon signs in the country. DeLaSalle expanded over the 20th century, demolishing and building on the site of the Eastman Flats. It became a college preparatory school, and went coeducational in 1971 by absorbing a Catholic girls' school. = Redevelopment = Nicollet Island Inn Starting in the 1950s, northern downtown was redeveloped by the city and state government, which made numerous plans to redevelop the island. Most proposals involved razing the historic buildings of the island, and in many cases replacing them with new buildings such as high-rise apartments. In addition to various housing developments, proposals included a parking lot, an amusement park, a \\"historic village\\", and a conservation museum. City agencies favored using the island to increase recreational space near Downtown. Island residents resisted any change. In the 1970s, the island became a concern of preservationists and was included with the rest of the Saint Anthony Falls district on the National Register of Historic Places. In the 1970s the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board made plans to make most of the island into an open area, which initially called for razing the buildings on the island, citing the cost of restoration and the value of a larger park near Downtown. In 1979 the Park Board began acquiring large parts of the island with funds from the Metropolitan Council, with a plan that would keep only the houses on the west side of the island, making the east side an open space, and keeping only the Island Sash and Door Company among the island's other buildings. Because of the concerns of preservationists and residents, a further compromise redevelopment plan was made, and finalised in 1983. Following this plan, the Park Board restored the homes on the island and now owns them, but the previous residents were allowed to remain with 99-year leases despite the high cost of restoration. The controversies resurfaced when DeLaSalle tried to build a football field, which only went ahead after a ruling by the Minnesota Court of Appeals in 2007.  Architecture  27 Maple Place, one of the smaller houses on the island, which was built in the French Second Empire style, complete with a mansard, unusual for such a small house. DeLaSalle High School, a Catholic, preparatory high school, and the Nicollet Island Inn are located on the island, as well as three multi-family residential buildings and twenty-two restored Victorian-era houses on the north end of the island. The Inn was built in 1893 as the Island Sash and Door Company, and was a Salvation Army men's shelter from 1913 to the 1970s.

They released three albums, Sub-Vocal Theme Park (1996), 2020 (2000) and Frequencies Will Move Together (2003) before disbanding in 2003. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 B(if)tek were nominated as Best Dance Release for the track, \\"Bedrock\\" which appeared on their second album.Aria Awards 1999  History  In 1994 in Canberra Kate Crawford and Nicole Skeltys formed B(if)tek as an electronic music group, and began writing material for their first album, Sub-Vocal Theme Park (1996). Biftek comes from French le biftek, which is borrowed from the English \\"beefsteak\\", while the English \\"beef\\" is originally from the French le b≈ìuf. It was sourced from Jean-Luc Goddard's 1961 film, Une femme est une femme. According to the band's website the album was recorded by the duo during 1995 and 1996 in a local suburban garage and was released as a limited edition of 500 copies on the independent Geekgirl label. Blatant Propagandas reviewer felt that Sub-Vocal Theme Park showed \\"a range of cruisey analogue-synth based tracks... Trippy listening music, with lots of burbling bass, mellow grooves, occasional samples and spluttering filtered percussions.\\" B(if)tek had a close association with the Clan Analogue collective. By 2000 the duo were based in Melbourne, they had signed with the Murmur label, distributed by Sony Music Australia. For their 2003 album Frequencies will move together the band received a grant from the Federal Government to investigate the effects of low frequency sounds on people. After break-up After the split, Nicole Skeltys changed musical direction, forming the psychedelic folk band Dust and releasing the album Songs in 2007. In late 2007, she formed the band The Jilted Brides and released the album Larceny of Love. Since 2008, she has been based in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 2006, Kate Crawford began hosting an experimental music television show Set on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. She is also an author and academic and lives and works in Sydney. In 2019, Kate Crawford, as one half of a duo named Metric Systems, released an album on Best Effort Records, named People in the Dark. Metric Systems is a collaboration with Bo Daley of Dark Network. The eight songs that make up ‚ÄòPeople in the Dark‚Äô were recorded in studios across Sydney, Melbourne, Berlin and New York over a sixteen year span. The album draws from a large archive of recordings that move between minimal techno, modular downtempo, and more abstract electroacoustic experimentation.

He was first elected as a Member of Parliament of Hougang SMC during the 1991 general election and became secretary-general of the Workers' Party (WP) on 27 May 2001. He served as one of two opposition MPs alongside Singapore People's Party's Chiam See Tong between 2001 and 2011 and was the unofficial opposition leader from 2 November 2006 to 8 April 2018. During the 2011 general election, he led the party to a historic breakthrough when his team captured the first group representation constituency from the ruling People's Action Party. He became one of five elected opposition MPs of Aljunied GRC in the 13th Parliament and represented the Bedok Reservoir‚ÄìPunggol division from 7 May 2011 to 23 June 2020. As part of a leadership renewal, Low was succeeded by Pritam Singh as secretary general in 2018, and also stepped down as an MP prior to the 2020 general election, making him Singapore's longest serving opposition Member of Parliament with 29 years in service. He has indicated his desire to remain active in politics. Early life Low studied at Lik Teck Primary School and Chung Cheng High School before he attended Nanyang University, where he majored in Chinese language and literature, and government and public administration. In 1981, he completed a Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Chinese studies at the National University of Singapore. In 1982, he completed a diploma in education. He worked as a teacher for a few years before starting his own business. Political career Low joined the Workers' Party (WP) in 1982, and was subsequently appointed as its Organising Secretary. At the 1984 general election, he was the election agent for the party's secretary-general, J. B. Jeyaretnam, in his successful campaign to win Anson constituency. Low is well known for giving speeches in Teochew, which have won him much support from a large number of Teochew-speaking residents in Hougang Single Member Constituency. In the 2016 Workers' Party Central Executive Committee (CEC) elections, Low's position of secretary-general was contended by fellow Aljunied MP Chen Show Mao. This was the first time Low was challenged for the post since he took it up in 2001. Low retained his seat with 61 votes, to Chen's 45. Chen remains in the CEC as a member. Low announced at his party's 60th anniversary dinner that he would not be contesting for the post of secretary-general for the 2018 party elections and would step down to renew leadership in WP after being at its helm for 17 years. Low formally stepped down as WP chief on 8 April 2018. Chan Chun Sing, the Minister for Trade and Industry, subsequently praised Low at a Parliament sitting on 15 May 2018 for the role he played in Parliament, acknowledging him as \\"a fellow Singaporean and very much part of Team Singapore\\", and that while the PAP may not always agree with Low's perspectives or methods, the PAP nevertheless appreciate(d) his efforts to work together to build a better Singapore. =1988 General Election= In 1988, Low represented the WP in a televised debate with the PAP government on proposals to create an elected Presidency for Singapore, during which he engaged Ong Teng Cheong and Lee Hsien Loong, who later became the President and Prime Minister of Singapore respectively. In the general election later that year, Low, together with Gopalan Nair and Lim Lye Soon, contested the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) of Tiong Bahru against only the PAP and finished second with 42.2% of the vote. =1991 General Election= In 1991, Low, as the Workers' Party's assistant secretary-general, won the single-member constituency (SMC) of Hougang in the 1991 general election and entered Parliament. In 1992, Low was appointed by Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong as a member of the Cost Review Committee. After a year of intensive study, Low decided to produce his own independent report as he had a different perspective from the other members of the committee. =1997 General Election= Low was re-elected as the MP for Hougang SMC at the 1997 general election, his second election victory in Hougang. =2001 General Election= On 27 May 2001, Low became the secretary-general of the Workers' Party, replacing J. B. Jeyaretnam. He was re-elected again as the MP for Hougang at the 2001 general election. =2006 General Election= At the 2006 general elections, Low won his fourth straight term for the Hougang constituency. He received 13,987 of the votes cast, a 62.74 per cent victory margin which was an increase of 7.74% from the last general election in November 2001. His opponent from the People's Action Party, Eric Low, received 8,306 votes. =2011 General Election= Low Thia Khiang at a Workers' Party general election rally, Sengkang, Singapore Low Thia Khiang at a Workers' Party general election rally, Bedok Stadium, Singapore. Between 1997 and 2011, Low and Chiam See Tong were the only elected opposition Members of Parliament (MP) in Parliament. During the 2011 general election, Low and Chiam left their respective strongholds in Hougang and Potong Pasir SMC to challenge the ruling PAP in Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). Low would challenge the ruling PAP in Aljunied GRC, while Chiam would contest the Bishan‚ÄìToa Payoh GRC. In so doing, Low and Chiam risked a situation where there would be no elected opposition MPs in Parliament had they lost. Low's gambit paid off as he led the Workers' Party to a historic breakthrough in the election, with a victory in Aljunied GRC. The win marked the first time that an opposition party won a GRC. As a result of the victory, the Workers' Party had a total of six elected MPs in Parliament, including the seat in Hougang SMC (which was retained by Low's party member, Yaw Shin Leong). =2015 General Election= At the 2015 general election, Low and his team won and retained their seats in Aljunied GRC. However, the team's votes share decreased to 50.96%, a drop of 3.76%, with a narrow margin of 1.9% (2,626 votes). As the margin was within the 2% range, there was a recount. This was Low's sixth continuous win as an elected opposition MP (four in Hougang SMC and two in Aljunied GRC). He is one of few elected opposition MPs to successfully defend a GRC as an incumbent; he also tied with Chiam for electing the most number of times for an opposition candidate, with six terms. =2020: Post-political career= On 30 April 2020, Low was hospitalised at an intensive care unit in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital as a result of a head injury. On 4 May, Low was transferred to the general ward, and remained until he was discharged on 21 May. The fall affected his olfactory nerve centre, robbing him his sense of smell. While still recuperating, Workers' Party announced that Low, along with Chen Show Mao and Png Eng Huat would not contest in the 2020 Singaporean general election in a move to \\" to broaden its leadership base and also remain in touch with the ground as Singapore‚Äôs population changes\\". In interviews following the decision not to contest, Low stated that it is be unlikely he would make a political comeback in the future. Low felt that he had achieved his goals of securing a group representation constituency, which he did with the 2011 Singaporean general election, and to renew the party leadership. Low would remain involved with the party in a mentoring role, advising the present leadership when asked. Electoral record Personal life Low first met Han Mui Keow while they were students at Chung Cheng High School in 1973. They were married in 1982 and had two sons and a daughter. He is a Buddhist. On 30 April 2020, he suffered a head injury from a fall at his home and was hospitalised at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. He was discharged on 21 May.

It broadcasts free-to-air domestically and as a subscription network to 29 territories across Asia and Australia. CNA has the sixth-widest reach among television news channels covering content indigenous to Asia, according to the most recent Ipsos Affluent Survey. The network has been positioned since its launch as an alternative to Western-based international media in its presentation of news from \\"an Asian perspective\\". It is run by Mediacorp News Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of the Singapore media conglomerate Mediacorp Pte Ltd. CNA also produces news and current affairs content in Singapore's four official languages: English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil. Content is produced for Mediacorp's online platforms, with news bulletins made for and shown on the company's mass entertainment channels Suria, Channel 5, U, Channel 8 and Vasantham. CNA provides news broadcasts through its own domestic radio station. It also provides live streaming of world news through its official online portal, and its social media presence through Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter as well as apps for tablets and mobile devices to allow viewers to access content at any time.  History  Channel NewsAsia was launched on 1 March 1999, under the Television Corporation of Singapore (renamed Media Corporation of Singapore the same year). The network aired only in Singapore at the beginning, as it was only focused on news from that country. It started to be distributed in Southeast Asia on 28 September 2000. In 2002, CNA signed a news content deal with Metro TV, in which it allowed the latter to use its video footages on its own network in Indonesia. Several carriage deals were done in 2004, including an arrangement between Mediacorp and China International TV Corporation (CITV) for CNA to be made available in hotels in China from 2005. The deal was signed in May and announced in November. In July, a deal was struck between Mediacorp and the Thailand Cable TV Association for CNA's carriage in the country. A similar deal was made with Malaysian pay-TV operator MiTV the following month. In August 2012, CNA reached an agreement to be broadcast in Myanmar through satellite-TV operator Sky Net. CNA opened its Myanmar news bureau in the capital Yangon in October 2013 ‚Äì the bureau officially opened in January 2014 ‚Äì as only one of four foreign news organisations licensed to operate in the country at the time. The network's graphical package was rebranded on 21 January 2013, and began broadcasting 24 hours a day. The network's new city studio in the Marina Bay Financial Centre was unveiled. In July 2014, CNA opened its Vietnam bureau. Other bureaus the channel had opened at the time were Beijing, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Seoul and Tokyo; unofficial offices were also maintained in other cities such as Mumbai, New Delhi and Washington D.C. In September 2014, the channel announced plans to expand its studio in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, into a fully functional high- definition (HD) satellite office. On 26 May 2015, CNA began airing in HD. In July 2015, CNA's reach was placed at 58 million households in 26 countries. CNA began broadcasting in India on 19 November 2015, through satellite operator Tata Sky. The move extended the network's reach to 14 million households in India, Mediacorp and Tata Sky said in a joint press statement. Beginning April 2019, to commemorate the channel's 20th anniversary, Channel NewsAsia will be officially relaunched as CNA. The said rebrand will be in conjunction with the station's transformation as a transmedia news outlet, which will capture as many audience as possible across various platforms. Alongside its traditional television channel and online platforms, the renaming will mark the integration of radio station 938Now to the CNA brand (with the station taking the CNA938 brand, which will carry news and talk shows that complements that of the TV channel). Meanwhile, CNA will also launch a cross-platform program, Asia First, which will see a simulcast on CNA 938. Tell CNA will also be launched as a citizen journalism program of the network. Beginning 1 May 2019, CNA ceased its daytime simulcast on Channel 5, due to the merger of the latter channel and okto, which ceased its transmission on the same day.  Programming   Broadcast feeds  CNA's programs are transmitted into two separate broadcast feeds: * Domestic - the channel's official feed providing 24-hour news, talk and lifestyle coverage. The Domestic feed also contains Singapore-only content including local public service videos, Mediacorp promos, sports content limited by rights agreement with international sporting organisations, and (as in most international channels with domestic feeds) the national anthem Majulah Singapura every 06:00 SST. CNA Domestic is available to Singapore viewers via over-the-air, StarHub Cable, Singtel TV, and Mediacorp's over-the-top streaming service meWATCH. * International - almost identical to the Domestic feed, but also provides opt-outs during Domestic-only content and annual English commentary coverage of Singapore's National Day Parade every 9 August.

Biography  D'Amico was born in Mesagne, in the Italian province of Brindisi, and later lived in Milan. He was hired as a part-time office administrator for his first job. He met Gianni Versace in 1982, and the couple eventually embarked on a long-term relationship that lasted 15 years, until Versace's murder in 1997. During that time, he worked as designer for the Versace Sport line. D'Amico now runs his own fashion design company. Versace's will left D'Amico with a pension of 50 million lira a month for life, and the right to live in any of Versace's homes in Italy and the United States. However, since the properties that were left to D'Amico in Gianni's will actually belonged to the company, the homes belonged to Versace's sister Donatella, brother Santo, and his niece, Allegra after his death. After working out agreements with lawyers, D'Amico obtained a fraction of the pension and a restricted right to live in Gianni's properties. D'Amico's relations with the rest of the Versace family have not always been easy; Donatella said in March 1999, \\"My relationship with Antonio is exactly as it was when Gianni was alive. I respected him as the boyfriend of my brother, but I never liked him as a person. So the relationship stayed the same.\\"  In popular culture  D'Amico was portrayed by Oscar Torre in the film The Versace Murder (1998) and Ricky Martin in the miniseries The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story (2018).

The painting immediately became a huge success with critics and the public, and remains one of the best known paintings in the Neoclassical style. It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a seventh-century BC dispute between two warring cities, Rome and Alba Longa, and stresses the importance of patriotism and masculine self-sacrifice for one's country. Instead of the two cities sending their armies to war, they agree to choose three men from each city; the victor in that fight will be the victorious city. From Rome, three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from a family of Alba Longa, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of whom appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. Of the three Horatii brothers, only one shall survive the confrontation. However, it is the surviving brother who is able to kill the other three fighters from Alba Longa: he allows the three fighters to chase him, causing them to separate from each other, and then, in turn, kills each Curiatii brother. Aside from the three brothers depicted, David also represents, in the bottom right corner, a woman crying while sitting down. She is Camilla, a sister of the Horatii brothers, who is also betrothed to one of the Curiatii fighters, and thus she weeps in the realisation that, whatever happens, she will lose someone she loves. The principal sources for the story behind David's Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24‚Äì26) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities. However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention. The painting led to the popularization of the Roman salute. It grew to be considered a paragon of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to take on his own students.Jacques-Louis David: The Oath of the Horatii (from the Boston College website. Retrieved 2008-01-10.) Commissioning the work David's The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, 1789 In 1774, David won the Prix de Rome with his work √ârasistrate d√©couvrant la cause de la Maladie d‚ÄôAntiochius. This allowed him to stay five years (1775‚Äì1780) in Rome as a student from the French government. Upon his return to Paris, he exhibited his work, which Diderot greatly admired; the success was so resounding that King Louis XVI of France allowed him to stay in the Louvre, a privilege greatly desired by artists. There he met Pecoul, the contractor for the actual buildings, and Pecoul's daughter, whom he married. The king's assistant, Charles-Claude Flahaut de la Billaderie, commissioned Oath of the Horatii with the intention that it be an allegory about loyalty to the state and therefore to the king. Nevertheless, David departed from the agreed-upon scene, painting this scene instead. The painting was not completed in Paris, but rather in Rome, where David was visited by his pupil Jean-Germaine Drouais who had himself recently won the Prix de Rome. Ultimately, David's picture manifests a progressive outlook, deeply influenced by Enlightenment ideas, that eventually contributed to the overthrow of the monarchy. As the French Revolution approached, paintings increasingly referred to the loyalty to the state rather than the family or the church. Painted five years before the Revolution, the Oath of the Horatii reflects the political tensions of the period. In 1789, David painted The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, a picture that was also a royal commission. Shortly afterward, the king went up to the scaffold also accused of treason, as the sons of Brutus, and with the vote of the artist in the National Assembly, which supported the execution of Louis XVI. Symbolic theme Oath of the Horatii, a second smaller version painted in 1786 by David and his pupil Girodet, now in Toledo, Ohio The painting depicts the Roman Horatius family, who, according to Titus Livius' Ab Urbe Condita (From the Founding of the City) had been chosen for a ritual duel against three members of the Curiatii, a family from Alba Longa, in order to settle disputes between the Romans and the latter city. As revolution in France loomed, paintings urging loyalty to the state rather than to clan or clergy abounded. Although it was painted nearly four years before the revolution in France, The Oath of the Horatii became one of the defining images of the time. In the painting, the three brothers express their loyalty and solidarity with Rome before battle, wholly supported by their father. These are men willing to lay down their lives out of patriotic duty. With their resolute gaze and taut, outstretched limbs, they are citadels of patriotism. They are symbols of the highest virtues of Rome. Their clarity of purpose, mirrored by David's simple yet powerful use of tonal contrasts, lends the painting, and its message about the nobility of patriotic sacrifice, an electric intensity. This is all in contrast to the tender-hearted women who lie weeping and mourning, awaiting the results of the fighting. The mother and sisters are shown clothed in silken garments seemingly melting into tender expressions of sorrow. Their despair is partly due to the fact that one sister was engaged to one of the Curiatii and another is a sister of the Curiatii, married to one of the Horatii. Upon defeat of the Curiatii, the remaining Horatius journeyed home to find his sister cursing Rome over the death of her fianc√©. He killed her, horrified that Rome was being cursed. Originally David had intended to depict this episode, and a drawing survives showing the surviving Horatius raising his sword, with his sister lying dead. David later decided that this subject was too gruesome a way of sending the message of public duty overcoming private feeling, but his next major painting, The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons depicted a similar scene - Lucius Junius Brutus brooding as the bodies of his sons, whose executions for treason he had ordered, are returned home. This was a subject the tragedy Brutus by Voltaire had made familiar to the French. Study for Camilla, black chalk and white highlights The painting shows the three brothers on the left, the Horatii father in the center, and the three women along with two children on the right. The Horatii brothers are depicted swearing upon (saluting) their swords as they take their oath. The men show no sense of emotion. Even the father, who holds up three swords, shows no emotion. On the right, three women are weeping‚Äîone in the back and two up closer. The woman dressed in the white is a Horatius weeping for both her Curiatii fianc√© and her brother; the one dressed in brown is a Curiatius who weeps for her Horatii husband and her brother. The background woman in black holds two children‚Äîone of whom is the child of a Horatius male and his Curiatii wife. The younger daughter hides her face in her nanny's dress as the son refuses to have his eyes shielded. According to Thomas Le Claire: Compositional technique Schematic showing the convergence of many elements in the composition at the central point This painting shows the neoclassical art style, and employs various techniques that were typical of it: *The background is de-emphasized, while the figures in the foreground are emphasized. *Overlapping ranks of profile figures are a common motif in classical art, and that of other ancient Near Eastern cultures. *The central point of the hand clasping the swords is placed in front of the vanishing point of the perspective scheme, which is emphasized by the straight lines of the edges of the wall blocks and floor slabs of the architectural setting leading to it (see schematic). *The use of dull colors is to show the importance of the story behind the painting over the painting itself. *The picture is organized, depicting the symbolism of the number three and of the moment itself. *The focus on clear, hard details and the lack of use of the more wispy brushstrokes preferred by Rococo art. *The brushstrokes are invisible, and the painter's technique is not displayed as a distraction from the subject *The men are all depicted with straight lines mirroring the columns in the background signifying their rigidity and strength while the women are all curved like the arches which are held up by the columns. *The use of straight lines to depict strength is also demonstrated in the swords, two of which are curved while one is straight, perhaps foreshadowing that only one brother would survive the encounter. *The frozen quality of the painting is also intended to emphasize rationality, unlike the Rococo style. *That it depicts a morally uplifting story, promoting civic duty over the personal, reflects the values of the Age of Enlightenment and neoclassical idealism. =Comparisons= File:Lille PdBA david horaces.JPGStudy by David, drawing File:Assyrian archers.jpgAssyrian archers, from a relief of about 728 BC, British Museum File:Parthenon frieze north XLIII.JPGOverlapping riders in profile, from the Parthenon Frieze File:Gavin Hamilton - the oath of brutus.jpgGavin Hamilton, The oath of Brutus, 1763‚Äì64 File:Johann Heinrich F√ºssli 018.jpgJohann Heinrich F√ºssli, the R√ºtlischwur, an oath from medieval Swiss history, 1780 File:Macbeth and Banquo with the witches JHF.jpgJohann Heinrich F√ºssli, Macbeth and Banquo with the witches, 1793‚Äì64 File:El Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, from Prado thin black margin.jpgEl Tres de Mayo, by Francisco de Goya, making a very different use of a file of men in profile, 1814.

The painting was exhibited in the Salon of 1785, but it was delivered late. David's enemies at the Academy took advantage of the delay to exhibit the painting in a poor locale in the gallery. The public's dissatisfaction with the painting's poor viewing conditions obliged the gallery to move it to a more prominent location. David kept The Oath of the Horatii on exhibit for longer than expected to permit reporters to write about all of the paintings exhibited, not just his.

Although Puerto Rico has many small street 'gangs' claiming its poorer neighborhoods, √ëetas is by far the largest and most dominant, controlling the illegal drug trade in the island's prison system. History The √ëeta Association was founded by Carlos Torres Irriarte, also known as \\"La Sombra\\" (\\"The Shadow\\"). It began in the late 1970s when several pro- independence political prisoners were incarcerated in the maximum security prison called Oso Blanco located in Rio Piedras. They formed as a mutual protection group in the late 1970s, ostensibly to improve living conditions and defend inmates from abuses committed by guards and other prisoners, as well as to fight the prison gang \\"G'27\\" (\\"Group 27\\"), or the \\"Insects\\" (\\"Insectos\\"). The G27s called the √±etas \\"Worms\\" (\\"Gusanos\\"). In the early 1980s, the √ëetas became the least dominant gang in the Oso Blanco prison after fighting both opposing gangs and crooked correctional officers. The majority of the inmates were fascinated by Irriarte's way of thinking and assisted the Association. But the leader of the G'27s‚Äîalong with the help of paid-off authorities‚Äîplotted Irriarte's murder hoping to destabilize the √ëetas. They were to ambush him when he left the watchful eyes of his followers on his routine walk to and from the prison chapel. On the afternoon of March 30, 1981, Irriarte, who was accompanied by an officer who was in on the plot, was attacked on his return from the chapel, which was located just west of the Recreational Yard. He was stabbed in the chest, stomach and back and then shot in the abdomen by a .38 caliber pistol. He was pronounced dead sometime after sunset. During the investigation of the murder of Irriarte, the correctional authorities found that he was probably betrayed by his lieutenants. His lieutenants wanted to get into the business of drug-trafficking in the prisons, but Irriarte opposed this. After the burial of their leader, the √ëetas exploded into an all-out rampage and took over several wings of the prison compound. Rumor has it that the majority of the √ëetas were drug addicts and in the drug-trafficking business, so almost every riot would end with an assault on the prison's pharmacy where they stole narcotic medications. They first showed their power and brutal force when they retaliated against the G27's leader \\"Manota\\" in retaliation for \\"the hit\\" he helped plan against Irriarte. After a few days of digging and chiseling their ways through the prison walls with spoons and their bare hands, they broke through the wall of Manotas' prison cell and stabbed him over 150 times and cut his body into 84 pieces. There were rumors that certain parts of his body were mailed to selected people: a severed finger to his mother; his ankle and foot were sent to the warden of the institution; and his eyes were sent to G27's second-in- command. The rest of his body was never recovered. The news soared and the media depicted the story as a hostile takeover. Used to their advantage, they used the media coverage as a means to send out messages to other members in different prisons across the island. Their message was clear: They wanted justice and they meant business. They warned the administration that if their demands about improving the living conditions within the facilities weren't met, there would be bloodshed and an all-out war. By the middle of 1984, their numbers multiplied excessively. They took over seven major prison facilities across the island and ruled them with an iron fist. Today, they still control a good part of the prison system. They denounce and punish sexual offenders, pedophiles and abusers, and exile them to solitary confinement where they are not allowed to interact with the rest of the prison population. It became such a force that the Puerto Rico Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation physically segregated √ëetas and their rivals in separate buildings or facilities within the prisons. Reportedly in the late-1980s, the association was involved in the cult of the \\"Holy Death\\" and performed several ritualistic murders at the Oso Blanco State Prison. In 1988 they branched out and expanded into the east coast of the United States and the forefront of Canada. There they broke their roots to Puerto Rico and continued to branch out as far as South Florida. Forming into separate Factions or \\"Chapters\\", they were built into an almost Mafia-like umbrella, where there was a President, Vice President and lower hierarchy instated. In the late 1990s, there were confirmed reports that Joanna Pimentel, known as \\"La Madrina\\", had been appointed council and leader of the New York City chapters. In 2001, Pimentel was convicted in a federal court in Brooklyn, New York, of ordering a gang- related killing in 1995 and was sentenced to life in prison. She is currently being held at the Federal Correctional Institution, Danbury, a federal prison in Connecticut. Because of their structure they are usually in alliance with People Nation. Their rivals vary throughout territories. Crips and Folks are usually on top of the list, as well as Dominican Power (DP), Dominicans Don't Play (DDP), MS-13, Los S√≥lidos, Grupo 31, and their lifelong sworn enemy G27 (Grupo 27). History shows that in certain areas of New York City they were even at war with the Latin Kings where the rivalry spread as far as Ecuador and Spain. √ëetas and Latin Kings are considered like cousins in NYC since the 90s. When they meet up they connect their hands together to throw up a crown paying homage to NDC and ADR. The √ëeta and Latin King sign connect. When Bloods started dominating Rikers Island, they snuck a razor in to \\"buck fifty\\" the pretty boy Spanish guys in jail across their face. Bloods are a sworn enemy that has since been dominate from the mid 90s. A sharp decline in the √ëeta gang presence has remained. Reports also show the same for Spain, where the war between the √ëetas and Latin Kings claimed many lives in Madrid. One way to identify members of the √ëetas are by the beads they wear around their neck. Their rosary styled necklace usually embodies a cross and are worn with the colors white, black, red. Another way is their clothing: they wear mainly white or the colors of the Puerto Rican Flag (red, white and blue, where sometimes blue is replaced by black). A white bandanna is also a good way to identify members. It's usually represented as their \\"flag\\" They may also be identified by using the letters \\"√ëDC\\" (\\"√ëeta De Corazon\\"‚Äî√ëeta From The Heart). Organization The √ëeta have a hierarchy that includes a Maximum Leader and council that branch out to State Officials and council and then Chapter Officials and council. They fall in a Pyramid as President, Vice president, Counselor, Moderator, Secretary, Vocal. √ëetas refer to each other as \\"hermanitos\\" and \\"hermanitas\\" (brothers and sisters). Recent reports Robert Walker of the website GangsOrUs.com has said of the √ëetas, \\"they use the facade of a cultural organization and see themselves as oppressed people who are unwilling to be governed by the United States.\\" √ëeta identifies with the Los Macheteros and their revolutionary philosophy in providing independence for the home island of Puerto Rico. Today, √ëeta Associations can be found throughout the prison systems of Puerto Rico, the United States, and Ontario. In 2009 they were reported as having up to 6,000 members in the North East Coast of the U.S. alone and to almost 13,000 in South America and thousands more worldwide. The √ëetas mainly operate out of the Tri-state and Upstate area, although they have ties with Los Sangeros Nuestra familia, a Mob family that operates in Puerto Rico, of which the leader is El Don. On June 3, 2003, seven leaders of the √ëeta Association were arrested in Long Island, New York, for the stabbing and murder of two MS-13 members. On May 6, 2009, a √ëeta drug den was discovered and busted by the Drug Enforcement Administration, in the Queensbridge Housing Projects, located in Long Island City Queens. 156 kilograms of cocaine and 487 pounds of marijuana were found in the apartment complex located on 41st Street and Vernon Blvd. in 2009, √ëetas were reported to have major conflict with former allies, the Bloods, and a more severe conflict with the MS-13. In 2010, reports say √ëetas have been seen operating and connecting with the Bloods and Latin Kings. √ëetas are still having conflict and dangerous altercations with MS-13 and DDP. In 2014 The √ëetas have reached a peace treaty with almost if not all who claimed enemy to them. In many parts of not just the United States but other countries the √ëetas are rebuilding their image by becoming more involved in communities and politics. In Spain, membership of the √ëetas is predominantly Ecuadorian.Spain cracks down on deadly Latin crime gangs The Local (25 March 2014) The main rivals of the Spanish branch of the √ëetas is the Latin Kings.Spanish gangs: the royal, racketeering 'Latin Kings' Thibault Blin, caf√©babel (28 January 2009) On 11 May 2014, a brawl occurred in Madrid involving √ëetas and Trinitarios which resulted in two injuries and the arrests of twenty-six gang members.Dos heridos graves y 26 detenidos en una reyerta entre √ëetas y Trinitarios F.

At the age of five weeks, his family moved to Debrecen, Hungary, where he became a naturalized Hungarian. They later moved to Miskolc where, at the age of 16, he learned to play chess. Studying law in Kassa, he is said to have copied out the voluminous Handbuch des Schachspiels by hand, unable to afford his own copy. Despite the lack of competition in Kassa, he soon became a strong player, and also qualified as a lawyer. In 1893 he entered a correspondence tournament organised by the Budapest newspaper Pesti Hirlap, in which he eventually shared first place with another up and coming Hungarian master, Geza Maroczy. He joined the Budapest chess club, where he frequently played with Maroczy and Gyula Makovetz, and convincingly defeated Gyozo Exner in a match.Philip W. Sergeant, Charousek's Games of Chess, G.

He served as member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1980 to 1992, and was president of Florida State University from 2003 through 2009. Early life Born in Daytona Beach, Florida, to a well known Pioneer family of the Daytona Beach area. His father Thomas James Wetherell, was born in Holly Hill on Feb. 16, 1912. and his mother Mildred Juanita Kent Wetherell. His paternal great grandparents Thomas Wetherell ( 1845- 1921) and Margaret Wetherell who traveled to this country by schooner from Durham, England. arrived in the Daytona Beach area, in 1876 from Philadelphia on a boat that was heading for Miami. It stopped here instead when it ran into a tropical storm. The family had traveled to this country by schooner from Durham, England. It was his grandfather Thomas Wetherell (1867‚Äì1945) who was involved in many of the firsts in the area including helping build the Ponce de Leon Lighthouse. Wetherell attended Port Orange Elementary School and Mainland High School. He attended Florida State University (FSU) on a football scholarship and played from 1963 to 1967. While at FSU, Wetherell joined the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. He earned two academic degrees in social studies and education, in 1967 and 1968. In 1974, he received a doctorate in education administration from FSU. Political career  Wetherell, a Democrat, was a member of the Florida House of Representatives from 1980 to 1992, and Speaker of the House in 1991 and 1992. He served as chair of the house's Appropriations and Education committees.  Educational career Wetherell served as president of Tallahassee Community College (TCC) from 1995 to 2001; before that, he was president of the Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida. During his time as president of TCC, the school saw increased enrollment and a campus expansion. Wetherell also worked at Daytona Beach Community College and Florida Technological University. After he resigned from his post at TCC, Wetherell was a lobbyist for the Southern Strategy Group. The FSU Board of Trustees appointed Wetherell to be president on December 18, 2002. His salary was ranked among the top ten for public university presidents in the United States. Later, Lee Hinkle, joined Wetherell's administration as a Vice President for University Relations. In late 2006, he added his voice to efforts by Bernie Machen, president of the University of Florida to bring a play-off to Division I-A college football. Personal life After a divorce from his first wife, with whom he had a son, Wetherell married Virginia Bass Wetherell, a former Florida state government official and state legislator; he gained two stepdaughters from this marriage. Until early 2018, he maintained a 100-acre hunting lodge near Tallahassee and Thomasville, Georgia. He was a fan of hunting birds including turkey, dove and quail on the estate. At one point he had pledged the lodge and grounds to Florida State University upon his death but since 2012 or 2013 he changed his will to leave it to his family. Wetherell had been suffering from prostate cancer since 2002. Wetherell died from complications of cancer on December 16, 2018, six days before his 73rd birthday.

It assumes that cooperation is possible in the anarchic system of states, as regimes are, by definition, instances of international cooperation. Theoretical foundations While realism predicts that conflict should be the norm in international relations, regime theorists say that there is cooperation despite anarchy. Often they cite cooperation in trade, human rights, and collective security, among other issues. These instances of cooperation are regimes. The most commonly cited definition comes from Stephen Krasner, who defines regimes as \\"institutions possessing norms, decision rules, and procedures which facilitate a convergence of expectations\\".Krasner, Stephen D. (ed). 1983. International Regimes. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. Not all approaches to regime theory, however are liberal or neoliberal; some realist scholars like Joseph Grieco developed hybrid theories which take a realism-based approach to this fundamentally liberal theory. (Realists do not say cooperation never happens, just that it's not the norm‚Äîa difference of degree).  In international political economy  As stated above, a regime is defined by Stephen D. Krasner as a set of explicit or implicit \\"principles, norms, rules, and decision making procedures around which actor expectations converge in a given area of international relations\\". This definition is intentionally broad, and covers human interaction ranging from formal organizations (e.g., OPEC) to informal groups (e.g., major banks during the debt crisis). Note that a regime need not be composed of states. Within IPE there are three main approaches to regime theory: the dominant, liberal- derived interest-based approach, the realist critique of interest-based approaches, and finally knowledge-based approaches that come from the cognitivist school of thought.Hasenclever, Andreas, Peter Mayer, and Volker Rittberger. 1997. Theories of International Regimes. New York: Cambridge University Press. The first two are rationalist approaches while the third is sociological. Within regime theory, because regime theory is by definition a theory that explains international cooperation (i.e., it's a traditionally liberal concept) liberal approaches prevail within the literature. = Liberal approaches = Liberal interest-based approaches to regime theory argue that cooperation in anarchy is possible without a hegemon because there exists a \\"convergence of expectations\\". Regimes facilitate cooperation by establishing standards of behavior that signal to other members that they are in fact cooperating. When all states expect cooperation from the others, the probability of sustaining cooperation increases. Digvijay Mehra notes that regime theory lacks recognition of political parties and their role in altering the influence of international institutions, but Mehra's claims have generally been ignored in academic circles for their lack of evidentiary support and intellectual rigor. Neoliberals believe that realists neglect the degree to which countries share interests and the iterative nature of state relations. Realists err by implicitly modeling the world using the classic single-play prisoner's dilemma, in which the payoff structure makes defection a dominant strategy for both players. The difference between this model and reality is that states are not like prisoners, states must continually cooperate whereas prisoners will never see one another again. One's decisions today, then, have future consequences. Mutual cooperation is thus rational: the sum of relatively small cooperative payoffs over time can be greater than the gain from a single attempt to exploit your opponent followed by an endless series of mutual defectionsRobert Axelrod 1984. The Evolution of Cooperation. New York: Basic Books. In The Evolution of Cooperation, Robert Axelrod referred to single-shot exploitation as the behavior whereby states avoided \\"tit for tat\\". In the iterated prisoner's dilemma, the actors' behavior is determined by the following assumptions: * States are rational, unitary, gain- maximizing actors, living in anarchy and ridden by the security dilemma. * There are future consequences for present actions; the prisoner's dilemma is not a one-shot event. Thus; * It is in the interest of states to cooperate in the present because, in the future, other states will defect on them (tit-for- tat strategy). Thus; * The theory presupposes that states are concerned with absolute gains, that is, states do not consider the gains or losses of other states in their utility analysis. In contrast neorealists argue that states are concerned with relative gains. That is, states are concerned with the advantages they gain versus the advantages of other states in the anarchic system. Neoliberal IR theorist Robert Keohane argues that international regimes can increase the likelihood of cooperation by: * Providing information about the behavior of others by monitoring the behavior of members and reporting on compliance. **Regimes clearly define what constitutes a defection and often clearly prescribe punishments for defection. **This reduces the fear that the state is being exploited by other members of the regime and minimizes the chance for misunderstanding. Prescribing sanctions reduces the incentive to covertly defect. * Reducing transaction costs. **By institutionalizing cooperation, regimes can reduce the cost of future agreements. By reducing the cost of reaching an agreement, regimes increase the likelihood of future cooperation. For example, each round of GATT resolved many procedural problems that did not have to be revisited in subsequent rounds, making cooperation easier and more likely. * Generating the expectation of cooperation among members. **By creating iteration and the belief that interaction will continue for the foreseeable future, regimes increase the importance of reputation and allow for the employment of complex strategies. Other authors such as Kenneth A. Oye claim that regimes can provide incentives to cooperate and deterrents to defect by altering the payoff structure of the regime.Kenneth A. Oye, 1986. \\"Explaining Cooperation Under Anarchy: Hypotheses and Strategies\\" In Kenneth A. Oye (ed.) Cooperation Under Anarchy. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press. pp. 1‚Äì24. = Realist approaches = Realists such as Joseph Grieco propose power-based theories of regimes based on hegemonic stability theory. Regime theory may appear to counter hegemonic stability theory sometimes, but realists also apply it within regime theory in order to explain change. When used in this way, realists conclude that a strong hegemon is what makes for a successful‚Äîi.e., robust, resilient‚Äîregime. In brief, within regime theory, liberals and realists disagree on two things‚Äîthe nature of international cooperation and the role of international institutions. Liberals believe that international institutions at most bring about an environment conducive to the convergence of state interests, which facilitates regime cooperation; and at least, facilitate cooperation that might otherwise not have been able to occur in an anarchic world. On the other hand, realists believe that regimes merely reflect the distribution of power in the international system, and that any cooperation that occurs under a regime would have occurred anyway. (Powerful states create regimes to serve their security and economic interests; regimes have no independent power over states, especially great powers; as such, regimes are simply intervening variables between power, the real independent variable, and cooperation, the dependent variable).Krasner, Stephen D. 1982. \\"Structural Causes and Regime Consequences: Regimes as Intervening Variables.\\" International Organization 36/2 (Spring). Reprinted in Stephen D. Krasner, ed., International Regimes, Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1983. For example, realist Susan Strange argues that institutions such as the World Bank, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), IMF, and other organizations established after World War II are only tools of American grand strategy. = Cognitivist knowledge-based approaches= In contrast to the rationalist approaches above, cognitivists critique the rationalist theories on the grounds that liberals and realists both use flawed assumptions such as that nation-states are always and forever rational actors; that interests remain static, that different interpretations of interests and power are not possible. The cognitivists also argue that even when the rationalist theories employ iterated game theories where future consequences affect present decisions, they ignore a major implication of such iteration‚Äîlearning. Consequences from an iterated game look backwards to the past as well as forward to the future. So one's decisions today are not the same as one‚Äôs decisions tomorrow, not only because the actors are taking the future into account but because each is taking the past into account as well. Finally cognitivists use a post-positivist methodology which does not believe that social institutions or actors can be separated out of their surrounding socio- political context for analytical purposes. The cognitivist approach then, is sociological or post-positivist instead of rationalist. In sum, for the cognitivists, it‚Äôs not only interests or power that matters but perceptions and environment as well. An example of a useful application of this approach to the study of international regime theory, is exemplified in a doctoral dissertation by Edythe Weeks, wherein she demonstrates that we can apply this type of analysis to explain and highlight key actors, unfolding political dynamics and historical-ideological shifts, related to commercial activities concerning outer space and its resources.Weeks, Edythe E., Doctoral Dissertation, \\"The Politics of Space Law in a Post Cold War Era: Understanding Regime Change\\", Northern Arizona University, Department of Politics and International Affairs, 2006. = Alternative approaches= Alternative approaches to liberal or realist regime theory tend to treat the debates over the normative bases of cooperation or otherwise as epiphenomenal. They emphasize instead the complex intersection of social forces, including changing values, that gave rise to ongoing political and economic regimes of power in the first place. For example, they emphasize the rise of modern bureaucratic regimes of negotiation or the normalizing of the global system of nation-states and multinational corporations as key players on the global stage: See also *Hegemonic stability theory *International legal theory *International regime *International relations *International relations theory *Neoliberalism (international relations) *Neorealism (international relations)  References   Further reading  * Breitmeier, Helmut, Oran R.

In graph theory, a maximal independent set (MIS) or maximal stable set is an independent set that is not a subset of any other independent set. In other words, there is no vertex outside the independent set that may join it because it is maximal with respect to the independent set property. For example, in the graph P_3, a path with three vertices a, b, and c, and two edges ab and bc, the sets \\\\\\\\{b\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{a, c\\\\\\\\} are both maximally independent. The set \\\\\\\\{a\\\\\\\\} is independent, but is not maximal independent, because it is a subset of the larger independent set \\\\\\\\{a, c\\\\\\\\}. In this same graph, the maximal cliques are the sets \\\\\\\\{a, b\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{b, c\\\\\\\\}. A MIS is also a dominating set in the graph, and every dominating set that is independent must be maximal independent, so MISs are also called independent dominating sets. The top two P_3 graphs are maximal independent sets while the bottom two are independent sets, but not maximal. The maximum independent set is represented by the top left. A graph may have many MISs of widely varying sizes; shows that the number of different sizes of MISs in an n-vertex graph may be as large as n - log n - O(log log n) and is never larger than n - log n. the largest, or possibly several equally large, MISs of a graph is called a maximum independent set. The graphs in which all maximal independent sets have the same size are called well-covered graphs. The phrase \\"maximal independent set\\" is also used to describe maximal subsets of independent elements in mathematical structures other than graphs, and in particular in vector spaces and matroids. star graph S_{8} show how vastly different in size two maximal independent sets (the right being maximum) can be. Two algorithmic problems are associated with MISs: finding a single MIS in a given graph and listing all MISs in a given graph.  Definition  For a graph G = (V, E), an independent set S is a maximal independent set if for v \\\\in V, one of the following is true: # v \\\\in S # N(v) \\\\cap S eq \\\\emptyset where N(v) denotes the neighbors of v The above can be restated as a vertex either belongs to the independent set or has at least one neighbor vertex that belongs to the independent set. As a result, every edge of the graph has at least one endpoint not in S. However, it is not true that every edge of the graph has at least one, or even one endpoint in S Notice that any neighbor to a vertex in the independent set S cannot be in S because these vertices are disjoint by the independent set definition.  Related vertex sets  If S is a maximal independent set in some graph, it is a maximal clique or maximal complete subgraph in the complementary graph. A maximal clique is a set of vertices that induces a complete subgraph, and that is not a subset of the vertices of any larger complete subgraph. That is, it is a set S such that every pair of vertices in S is connected by an edge and every vertex not in S is missing an edge to at least one vertex in S. A graph may have many maximal cliques, of varying sizes; finding the largest of these is the maximum clique problem. Some authors include maximality as part of the definition of a clique, and refer to maximal cliques simply as cliques. Left is a maximal independent set. Middle is a clique, K_3, on the graph complement. Right is a vertex cover on the maximal independent set complement. The complement of a maximal independent set, that is, the set of vertices not belonging to the independent set, forms a minimal vertex cover. That is, the complement is a vertex cover, a set of vertices that includes at least one endpoint of each edge, and is minimal in the sense that none of its vertices can be removed while preserving the property that it is a cover. Minimal vertex covers have been studied in statistical mechanics in connection with the hard-sphere lattice gas model, a mathematical abstraction of fluid-solid state transitions.. Every maximal independent set is a dominating set, a set of vertices such that every vertex in the graph either belongs to the set or is adjacent to the set. A set of vertices is a maximal independent set if and only if it is an independent dominating set.  Graph family characterizations  Certain graph families have also been characterized in terms of their maximal cliques or maximal independent sets. Examples include the maximal- clique irreducible and hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs. A graph is said to be maximal-clique irreducible if every maximal clique has an edge that belongs to no other maximal clique, and hereditary maximal-clique irreducible if the same property is true for every induced subgraph.Information System on Graph Class Inclusions: maximal clique irreducible graphs and hereditary maximal clique irreducible graphs . Hereditary maximal-clique irreducible graphs include triangle-free graphs, bipartite graphs, and interval graphs. Cographs can be characterized as graphs in which every maximal clique intersects every maximal independent set, and in which the same property is true in all induced subgraphs.  Bounding the number of sets  showed that any graph with n vertices has at most 3n/3 maximal cliques. Complementarily, any graph with n vertices also has at most 3n/3 maximal independent sets. A graph with exactly 3n/3 maximal independent sets is easy to construct: simply take the disjoint union of n/3 triangle graphs. Any maximal independent set in this graph is formed by choosing one vertex from each triangle. The complementary graph, with exactly 3n/3 maximal cliques, is a special type of Tur√°n graph; because of their connection with Moon and Moser's bound, these graphs are also sometimes called Moon-Moser graphs. Tighter bounds are possible if one limits the size of the maximal independent sets: the number of maximal independent sets of size k in any n-vertex graph is at most :\\\\lfloor n/k \\\\rfloor^{k-(n\\\\bmod k)}\\\\lfloor n/k+1 \\\\rfloor^{n\\\\bmod k}. The graphs achieving this bound are again Tur√°n graphs.. For related earlier results see and . Certain families of graphs may, however, have much more restrictive bounds on the numbers of maximal independent sets or maximal cliques. If all n-vertex graphs in a family of graphs have O(n) edges, and if every subgraph of a graph in the family also belongs to the family, then each graph in the family can have at most O(n) maximal cliques, all of which have size O(1).. Chiba and Nishizeki express the condition of having O(n) edges equivalently, in terms of the arboricity of the graphs in the family being constant. For instance, these conditions are true for the planar graphs: every n-vertex planar graph has at most 3n ‚àí 6 edges, and a subgraph of a planar graph is always planar, from which it follows that each planar graph has O(n) maximal cliques (of size at most four). Interval graphs and chordal graphs also have at most n maximal cliques, even though they are not always sparse graphs. The number of maximal independent sets in n-vertex cycle graphs is given by the Perrin numbers, and the number of maximal independent sets in n-vertex path graphs is given by the Padovan sequence.; ; . Therefore, both numbers are proportional to powers of 1.324718, the plastic number.  Finding a single maximal independent set  = Sequential algorithm = Given a Graph G(V,E), it is easy to find a single MIS using the following algorithm: # Initialize I to an empty set. # While V is not empty: #* Choose a node v‚ààV; #* Add v to the set I; #* Remove from V the node v and all its neighbours. # Return I. The runtime is O(m) since in the worst case as we have to check all edges. O(m) is obviously the best possible runtime for a serial algorithm. But a parallel algorithm can solve the problem much faster. = Random-selection parallel algorithm [Luby's Algorithm] = The following algorithm finds a MIS in time O(log n).Luby‚Äôs Algorithm, in: Lecture Notes for Randomized Algorithms, Last Updated by Eric Vigoda on February 2, 2006 # Initialize I to an empty set. # While V is not empty: #* Choose a random set of vertices S ‚äÜ V, by selecting each vertex v independently with probability 1/(2d(v)), where d is the degree of v (the number of neighbours of v). #* For every edge in E, if both its endpoints are in the random set S, then remove from S the endpoint whose degree is lower (i.e. has fewer neighbours). Break ties arbitrarily, e.g. using a lexicographic order on the vertex names. #* Add the set S to I. #* Remove from V the set S and all the neighbours of nodes in S. # Return I. ANALYSIS: For each node v, divide its neighbours to lower neighbours (whose degree is lower than the degree of v) and higher neighbours (whose degree is higher than the degree of v), breaking ties as in the algorithm. Call a node v bad if more than 2/3 of its neighbors are higher neighbours. Call an edge bad if both its endpoints are bad; otherwise the edge is good. * At least 1/2 of all edges are always good. PROOF: Build a directed version of G by directing each edge to the node with the higher degree (breaking ties arbitrarily). So for every bad node, the number of out-going edges is more than 2 times the number of in-coming edges. So every bad edge, that enters a node v, can be matched to a distinct set of two edges that exit the node v. Hence the total number of edges is at least 2 times the number of bad edges. * For every good node u, the probability that a neighbour of u is selected to S is at least a certain positive constant. PROOF: the probability that NO neighbour of u is selected to S is at most the probability that none of u's lower neighbours is selected. For each lower-neighbour v, the probability that it is not selected is (1-1/2d(v)), which is at most (1-1/2d(u)) (since d(u)>d(v)). The number of such neighbours is at least d(u)/3, since u is good. Hence the probability that no lower-neighbour is selected is at most 1-exp(-1/6). * For every node u that is selected to S, the probability that u will be removed from S is at most 1/2. PROOF: This probability is at most the probability that a higher-neighbour of u is selected to S. For each higher-neighbour v, the probability that it is selected is at most 1/2d(v), which is at most 1/2d(u) (since d(v)>d(u)). By union bound, the probability that no higher-neighbour is selected is at most d(u)/2d(u) = 1/2. * Hence, for every good node u, the probability that a neighbour of u is selected to S and remains in S is a certain positive constant. Hence, the probability that u is removed, in each step, is at least a positive constant. * Hence, for every good edge e, the probability that e is removed, in each step, is at least a positive constant. So the number of good edges drops by at least a constant factor each step. * Since at least half the edges are good, the total number of edges also drops by a constant factor each step. * Hence, the number of steps is O(log m), where m is the number of edges. This is bounded by O(\\\\log(n)). A worst-case graph, in which the average number of steps is \\\\Theta(\\\\log(n)), is a graph made of n/2 connected components, each with 2 nodes. The degree of all nodes is 1, so each node is selected with probability 1/2, and with probability 1/4 both nodes in a component are not chosen. Hence, the number of nodes drops by a factor of 4 each step, and the expected number of steps is \\\\log_4(n). = Random-priority parallel algorithm = The following algorithm is better than the previous one in that at least one new node is always added in each connected component: # Initialize I to an empty set. # While V is not empty, each node v does the following: #* Selects a random number r(v) in [0,1] and sends it to its neighbours; #* If r(v) is smaller than the numbers of all neighbours of v, then v inserts itself into I, removes itself from V and tells its neighbours about this; #* If v heard that one of its neighbours got into I, then v removes itself from V. # Return I. Note that in every step, the node with the smallest number in each connected component always enters I, so there is always some progress. In particular, in the worst-case of the previous algorithm (n/2 connected components with 2 nodes each), a MIS will be found in a single step. ANALYSIS: * A node v has probability at least \\\\frac{1}{d(v)+d(w)} of being removed. PROOF: For each edge connecting a pair of nodes (v, w), replace it with two directed edges, one from (v, w) and the other (w, v). Notice that E is now twice as large. For every pair of directed edges (v, w), define two events: (v \\\\rightarrow w) and (w \\\\rightarrow v), v pre-emptively removes w and w pre-emptively removes v, respectively. The event (v \\\\rightarrow w) occurs when r(v) < r(w) and r(v) < r(x), where w is a neighbor of v and x is neighbor w. Recall that each node is given a random number in the same [0, 1] range. In a simple example with two disjoint nodes, each has probability \\\\frac{1}{2} of being smallest. If there are three disjoint nodes, each has probability \\\\frac{1}{3} of being smallest. In the case of v, it has probability at least \\\\frac{1}{d(v)+d(w)} of being smallest because it is possible that a neighbor of v is also the neighbor of w, so a node becomes double counted. Using the same logic, the event (w \\\\rightarrow v) also has probability at least \\\\frac{1}{d(w)+d(v)} of being removed. * When the events (v \\\\rightarrow w) and (w \\\\rightarrow v) occur, they remove d(w) and d(v) directed outgoing edges, respectively. PROOF: In the event (v \\\\rightarrow w), when v is removed, all neighboring nodes w are also removed. The number of outgoing directed edges from w removed is d(w). With the same logic, (w \\\\rightarrow v) removes d(v) directed outgoing edges. * In each iteration of step 2, in expectation, half the edges are removed. PROOF: If the event (v \\\\rightarrow w) happens then all neighbours of w are removed; hence the expected number of edges removed due to this event is at least \\\\frac{d(w)}{d(v)+d(w)}. The same is true for the reverse event (w \\\\rightarrow v), i.e. the expected number of edges removed is at least \\\\frac{d(v)}{d(w)+d(v)}. Hence, for every undirected edge (w, v), the expected number of edges removed due to one of these nodes having smallest value is \\\\frac{d(w)+d(v)}{d(w)+d(v)} = 1. Summing over all edges, \\\\sum_{{v,w}\\\\in E} 1= E, gives an expected number of E edges removed every step, but each edge is counted twice (once per direction), giving \\\\frac{E}{2} edges removed in expectation every step. * Hence, the expected run time of the algorithm is 3 \\\\log_{4/3}(m)+1 which is O(\\\\log(n)). = Random-permutation parallel algorithm [Blelloch's Algorithm] = Instead of randomizing in each step, it is possible to randomize once, at the beginning of the algorithm, by fixing a random ordering on the nodes. Given this fixed ordering, the following parallel algorithm achieves exactly the same MIS as the #Sequential algorithm (i.e. the result is deterministic): # Initialize I to an empty set. # While V is not empty: #* Let W be the set of vertices in V with no earlier neighbours (based on the fixed ordering); #* Add W to I; #* Remove from V the nodes in the set W and all their neighbours. # Return I. Between the totally sequential and the totally parallel algorithms, there is a continuum of algorithms that are partly sequential and partly parallel. Given a fixed ordering on the nodes and a factor Œ¥‚àà(0,1], the following algorithm returns the same MIS: # Initialize I to an empty set. # While V is not empty: #* Select a factor Œ¥‚àà(0,1]. #* Let P be the set of Œ¥n nodes that are first in the fixed ordering. #* Let W be a MIS on P using the totally parallel algorithm. #* Add W to I; #* Remove from V all the nodes in the prefix P, and all the neighbours of nodes in the set W. # Return I. Setting Œ¥=1/n gives the totally sequential algorithm; setting Œ¥=1 gives the totally parallel algorithm. ANALYSIS: With a proper selection of the parameter Œ¥ in the partially parallel algorithm, it is possible to guarantee that the it finishes after at most log(n) calls to the fully parallel algorithm, and the number of steps in each call is at most log(n). Hence the total run-time of the partially parallel algorithm is O(\\\\log^2(n)). Hence the run-time of the fully parallel algorithm is also at most O(\\\\log^2(n)). The main proof steps are: * If, in step i, we select \\\\delta = 2^i \\\\log{(n)} / D, where D is the maximum degree of a node in the graph, then WHP all nodes remaining after step i have degree at most D / 2^i. Thus, after log(D) steps, all remaining nodes have degree 0 (since D\\\\delta = C \\\\log{(n)}/d (for any constant C), then WHP the longest path in the directed graph determined by the fixed ordering has length O(\\\\log(n)). Hence the fully parallel algorithm takes at most O(\\\\log(n)) steps (since the longest path is a worst-case bound on the number of steps in that algorithm). * Combining these two facts gives that, if we select \\\\delta = 2^i \\\\log{(n)} / D, then WHP the run-time of the partially parallel algorithm is O(\\\\log(D)\\\\log(n)) = O(\\\\log^2(n)).  Listing all maximal independent sets  An algorithm for listing all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques in a graph can be used as a subroutine for solving many NP- complete graph problems. Most obviously, the solutions to the maximum independent set problem, the maximum clique problem, and the minimum independent dominating problem must all be maximal independent sets or maximal cliques, and can be found by an algorithm that lists all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques and retains the ones with the largest or smallest size. Similarly, the minimum vertex cover can be found as the complement of one of the maximal independent sets. observed that listing maximal independent sets can also be used to find 3-colorings of graphs: a graph can be 3-colored if and only if the complement of one of its maximal independent sets is bipartite. He used this approach not only for 3-coloring but as part of a more general graph coloring algorithm, and similar approaches to graph coloring have been refined by other authors since.; . Other more complex problems can also be modeled as finding a clique or independent set of a specific type. This motivates the algorithmic problem of listing all maximal independent sets (or equivalently, all maximal cliques) efficiently. It is straightforward to turn a proof of Moon and Moser's 3n/3 bound on the number of maximal independent sets into an algorithm that lists all such sets in time O(3n/3).. For a matching bound for the widely used Bron‚ÄìKerbosch algorithm, see . For graphs that have the largest possible number of maximal independent sets, this algorithm takes constant time per output set. However, an algorithm with this time bound can be highly inefficient for graphs with more limited numbers of independent sets. For this reason, many researchers have studied algorithms that list all maximal independent sets in polynomial time per output set.; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; ; . The time per maximal independent set is proportional to that for matrix multiplication in dense graphs, or faster in various classes of sparse graphs.; .  Parallelization of finding maximum independent sets  = History = The maximal independent set problem was originally thought to be non-trivial to parallelize due to the fact that the lexicographical maximal independent set proved to be P-Complete; however, it has been shown that a deterministic parallel solution could be given by an NC^1 reduction from either the maximum set packing or the maximal matching problem or by an NC^2 reduction from the 2-satisfiability problem. Typically, the structure of the algorithm given follows other parallel graph algorithms - that is they subdivide the graph into smaller local problems that are solvable in parallel by running an identical algorithm. Initial research into the maximal independent set problem started on the PRAM model and has since expanded to produce results for distributed algorithms on computer clusters. The many challenges of designing distributed parallel algorithms apply in equal to the maximum independent set problem. In particular, finding an algorithm that exhibits efficient runtime and is optimal in data communication for subdividing the graph and merging the independent set. = Complexity class = It was shown in 1984 by Karp et al. that a deterministic parallel solution on PRAM to the maximal independent set belonged in the Nick's Class complexity zoo of NC_4. That is to say, their algorithm finds a maximal independent set in O(\\\\log^4n) using O((n/\\\\log n)^3), where n is the vertex set size. In the same paper, a randomized parallel solution was also provided with a runtime of O(\\\\log^4n) using O(n^2) processors. Shortly after, Luby and Alon et al. independently improved on this result, bringing the maximal independent set problem into the realm of NC_2 with an O(\\\\log^2n) runtime using O(mn^2) processors, where m is the number of edges in the graph. In order to show that their algorithm is in NC_2, they initially presented a randomized algorithm that uses O(m) processors but could be derandomized with an additional O(n^2) processors. Today, it remains an open question as to if the maximal independent set problem is in NC_1. = Communication and data exchange = Distributed maximal independent set algorithms are strongly influenced by algorithms on the PRAM model. The original work by Luby and Alon et al. has led to several distributed algorithms. In terms of exchange of bits, these algorithms had a message size lower bound per round of O(\\\\log n) bits and would require additional characteristics of the graph. For example, the size of the graph would need to be known or the maximum degree of neighboring vertices for a given vertex could be queried. In 2010, M√©tivier et al. reduced the required message size per round to O(1), which is optimal and removed the need for any additional graph knowledge.

He was editor of The Times from 1919 to 1922. Early life Born in Long Melford, England, Steed was educated at Sudbury Grammar School and the universities of Jena, Berlin and Paris. While in Europe, he demonstrated an early interest in social democracy and met with a range of left-wing figures, including Friedrich Engels, Wilhelm Liebknecht, August Bebel, and Alexandre Millerand. His encounters formed the basis of his first book, The Socialist and Labour Movement in England, Germany & France (1894). Foreign correspondent Appointed by Joseph Pulitzer as Paris correspondent for the New York World, Steed joined The Times in 1896 as a foreign correspondent, working briefly out of Berlin before transferring successively to Rome (1897-1902) and then Vienna (1902-1913). In 1914, he moved to London to take over as foreign editor of The Times. During his time in Vienna he acquired a deep contempt for Austria-Hungary.Margaret Macmillan, Paris 1919, p. 114f. An anti-Semite and a Germanophobe, in an editorial published in The Times on 31 July 1914, Steed labelled efforts to stop the impending war as \\"a dirty German-Jewish international financial attempt to bully us into advocating neutrality\\".Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War, p. 32, 195. From 22 July 1914, Steed, in close agreement with The Times' proprietor, Lord Northcliffe, took a very bellicose line, and in editorials written on 29 and 31 July, Steed urged that the British Empire to enter the coming war.Niall Ferguson, The Pity of War, p. 217. Seen as a leading expert on Eastern Europe, Steed's views had much influence with decision-makers such as high-level bureaucrats and Cabinet politicians in the First World War and its aftermath. During the war, Steed befriended anti-Habsburg √©migr√©s such as Edvard Bene≈°, Ante Trumbiƒá, Tom√°≈° Masaryk and Roman Dmowski and advised the British government to seek the liquidation of Austria-Hungary as a war aim. In particular, Steed was a very strong advocate of uniting all of the South Slavic peoples, such as the Croats, the Serbs and the Slovenes, into a federation, to be called Yugoslavia. The British Ambassador to Italy claimed in a diplomatic dispatch that Steed's fondness for the Yugoslav concept derived from a relationship that he maintained for a number of years \\"filially I believe rather maritally\\" with a Slavic woman from the Balkans. In October 1918, Steed met with Serbian Prime Minister Nikola Pa≈°iƒá to gain his support for the Yugoslav concept but was deeply angered when he learned that Pa≈°iƒá saw the new state as merely as extension of Greater Serbia and had no intention of sharing power with the Croats or the Slovenes. Steed charged Pa≈°iƒá with being a new \\"sultan\\" and severed his friendship with him. Editor of The Times When the editor of The Times, Geoffrey Dawson, resigned from his post in February 1919, Steed was Northcliffe's first choice to succeed him. Steed had worked closely with Northcliffe during the war, becoming an adviser to him on foreign affairs. Steed was forced to contend with Northcliffe throughout most of his tenure as editor, as the press baron retained considerable control over the affairs of the newspaper. After the war, Steed strongly disapproved of the Bolshevik regime in Russia. In an editorial written in another Northcliffe paper, the Daily Mail on 28 March 1919, Steed accused the British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, whom Steed detested, of betraying the White Russians because of a plot by \\"international Jewish financiers\\" and the Germans to help the Bolsheviks stay in power.Margaret Macmillan, Paris 1919, p. 80. In 1920, Steed endorsed as genuine a notorious anti-Semitic forgery, The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, writing in an editorial in The Times in which he blamed the Jews for World War I and the Bolshevik regime and called them the greatest threat to the British Empire. However, he retracted his view on the Protocols in 1921, when his paper's Constantinople correspondent proved them to be a forgery.Andre Liebich: \\"The Antisemitism of Henry Steed\\", Patterns of Prejudice, Vol. 46, No. 2, 2002. Retrieved 21 December 2016. Steed was Northcliffe's personal choice for the editorship, but by 1922, the press baron was increasingly frustrated by Steed's failure to return The Times to profitability. After Northcliffe's death in August 1922, the new owners, John Jacob Astor and John Walter, dismissed Steed on 24 October and brought back Dawson as editor. Final years In 1923, Steed became editor of Review of Reviews (1923‚Äì30), the journal established by William Thomas Stead in 1890. In the early 1930s, he was one of the first English speakers to express alarm about the new German dictatorial chancellor, Adolf Hitler. In 1934, he caused sensation with an article claiming to have evidence of secret German experiments in airborne biological warfare.H. Wickham Steed, \\"Aerial warfare: secret German plans\\", Nineteenth Century and After 116 (1934), 1‚Äì15. The British government was sufficiently alarmed to start stockpiling vaccinesBrett Holman, Airminded: The Wickham Steed affair in popular culture, 17 February 2007 although a retrospective analysis by the epidemiologist Martin Hugh-Jones has suggested that Steed's evidence could not have amounted to much.Martin Hugh-Jones, 'Wickham Steed and German biological warfare research', Intelligence and National Security 7 (1992), 379‚Äì402. On the title page of his 1934 work, Hitler Whence and Whither?, Steed is described as a lecturer in Central European History at King's College London. He died in Wootton, West Oxfordshire. In popular culture Steed, played by actor Andrew Keir, appears in the 1974 miniseries Fall of Eagles, bringing a rumour of the impending Bosnian crisis to the attention of King Edward VII, Georges Clemenceau, and Alexander Izvolsky.

He was the first player selected by the-then Tampa Bay Devil Rays in the expansion draft. Career Saunders initially signed with the Florida Marlins' minor league system in 1992, a year before their expansion season. He required reconstructive surgery on his elbow in 1994. =Florida Marlins= Saunders joined the Marlins' opening day roster in 1997, and despite a knee injury which cost him seven weeks in the middle of the season finished with a 4‚Äì6 record in 22 starts, with his first three wins coming against the Atlanta Braves. The Marlins earned a wild card berth in the 1997 playoffs, and after being left off the Division Series roster, Saunders was placed on the LCS roster against the Braves. He started Game 3 of the series, which Liv√°n Hern√°ndez won in relief of Saunders. In the World Series, Saunders started Game 4 against the Cleveland Indians, but took the loss after giving up six earned runs in two innings pitched; nonetheless, he earned a World Series ring as the Marlins defeated Cleveland in seven games. =Tampa Bay Devil Rays= Saunders was one of many members of that team who left the Marlins following that season, joining the Rays for their inaugural season after being the first pick in the 1997 MLB Expansion Draft. Saunders was 9th in the American League in strikeouts, but also 1st in walks, as he struggled to a 6‚Äì15 record. Saunders' 1999 season was short-lived as he went 3‚Äì3 with a 6.43 ERA. On May 26, 1999, while pitching against the Texas Rangers, Saunders fractured his humerus bone on a 3-2 pitch to Juan Gonzalez; the sound of it breaking was heard throughout Tropicana Field. He subsequently collapsed on the mound, screaming in pain and smacking his right arm on the ground. Within moments, team trainer Jamie Reed and teammates John Flaherty and Kevin Stocker rushed to his side. Saunders had to be carted off the field, as the pain was too much for him to walk. In addition to the fracture, he also sustained torn ligaments, causing him to miss the remainder of the 1999 season. In 2000, Saunders broke his arm again in a rehab assignment, forcing him to retire at the age of 26. Saunders won the Tony Conigliaro Award in 2000. After baseball, Saunders worked as a stockbroker. In 2005, Saunders announced a comeback, signing a minor league contract with the Baltimore Orioles, and making their spring training roster. He pitched one inning against the St. Louis Cardinals before he was reassigned to the minor leagues. He remained listed on the Bowie Baysox roster for the whole 2005 season, but never pitched in a game, although he did appear in 9 games for the Mesa Miners of the Golden Baseball League.

He played a prominent role in defeating the Trung sisters' rebellion. He was a descendant of the Warring States period general Zhao She. Life and career Ma Yuan's statue in Hainan Fubo Temple in Zhuzhou County, Hunan Ma Yuan was a native of what is now Xingping, Shaanxi province. His family was descended from the State of Zhao. His military and political achievements included helping Emperor Guangwu unite the empire and putting down rebellions of the Trung Sisters (in Jiaozhi, modern Vietnam) and the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan). He fell ill during an expedition to modern Hunan in 49 AD, and died soon afterwards. Prior to that, Ma Yuan contributed to Emperor Guangwu's defeat of the warlord Wei Xiao (), who controlled the modern eastern Gansu region. He is considered one of the more famous generals in Chinese history, not only because of his military achievements, but also because he demonstrated perseverance and respect to his friends and subordinates. In addition to his military skills, his exhortations on personal discipline were also highly regarded. His daughter became Empress Ma of Emperor Ming of Han and was also highly respected. One of his greatest achievements was the subjugation of the territory of the Nanman regions. It was for this he earned his title \\"Queller of the Deep.\\" He was reportedly revered in that area (as was often the case of great warriors of that period), and his temple was established somewhere there. The territory he subjugated corresponds roughly with North Vietnam. Ma was placed in command of the campaign to suppress the Trung sisters' rebellion. He was given the title Fubo Jiangjun (‰ºèÊ≥¢Â∞áËªç; General who Calms the Waves). Ma Yuan and his staff began mobilizing a Han army in southern China. It comprised about 10,000 troops. From Guangdong, Ma Yuan dispatched a fleet of supply ships along the coast. He led the Han army through difficult terrain towards the Red River Delta, where they arrived in early 43 AD. The rebellion was brought under control by April or May. He also subjugated the Qiang. In 34 A.D., the Xianlian Qiang and a number of other tribes, raided Chinese positions in Jincheng and Longxi commanderies and were defeated by Han armies. A few months later, Lai Xi was killed on campaign against Gongsun Shu, but his assistant, Ma Yuan, Grand Administrator of Lonxi commandery, continued operations against the Qiang. In 35, the Xianlian tribe were again defeated, first at Lintao in Longxi and then along the Xining river in Jincheng commandery. In the two separate campaigns, Ma Yuan captured more than ten thousand head of horses, cattle and sheep, together with considerable stores of grain. He was wounded in the leg during one of the final engagements, and he did not completely destroy the enemy, but he did drive them away from the valley lands of Jincheng, and he was rewarded with Imperial commendation and several thousand of the animals he had captured. Though members of the Qiang had escaped across the borders, Ma Yuan's victories in 35 had broken the power of the Xianlian tribe and had made possible a restoration of Chinese positions on the old frontiers. In 49, Ma, while on expedition against the Wulin tribes (in modern eastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan), died during the campaign from a plague, which also killed a large number of his soldiers. After his death, Ma's deputy Geng Shu (), who had disagreed with Ma's strategy, and Emperor Guangwu's son-in-law Liang Song (), who had prior grudges against Ma, falsely accused Ma of many crimes. Two specific accusations that are known are that Ma, by the route he took against the Wulin tribes, was responsible for the plague, and that he had, while on campaigns, embezzled pearls and rhinoceros horns. The latter accusation was a misunderstanding in that one of Ma's favorite foods (which he considered capable of warding off plague) was Chinese pearl barley, produced in southern China and northern Vietnam, which Ma had transported in large quantities back to the capital Luoyang. Emperor Guangwu believed these false accusations and posthumously stripped Ma of his fief and title of marquess. His reputation was not restored until his daughter later became empress to Emperor Guangwu's son Emperor Ming upon his ascension to the throne in 57. Legends It is said that during Zhuge Liang's attempts to suppress Meng Huo and the barbarians, he was inspired by a statue of Ma Yuan which helped him to overcome one of Meng Huo's most difficult obstacles. Ma Yuan was the source of two Chinese chengyu idioms. One, \\"wrapping one's body with horse leather\\" (), refers to being dedicated to one's responsibilities that one is willing to die on the battlefield and have his body be wrapped in horse leather; Ma had given this phrase while talking to a friend as to why he wished to continue in military service. The other, \\"drawing a tiger improperly results in a dog\\" (), refers to his admonition to his nephews to be careful in their conduct and not to try to imitate a famed heroic figure of the time, Du Bao () -- in that if one tried to imitate Du but was not as heroic as he was, one would end up becoming a frivolous hoodlum. Memorials Ma Yuan is worshipped as a deity in numerous temples in China and Vietnam. The Fubo Temples of Zhuzhou County, Hunan and Heng County, Guangxi are among the best known. Mount Fubo and Fubo Park in Guilin, Guangxi are also named after him. In Hanoi there is a Ma Yuan temple names B·∫°ch M√£ ƒë·ªÅn was built and worshipped at least since the Han dynasty. The worshipping stopped at the temple when the Sino-Vietnamese War broke out in 1979; historians believe that it was local Kinh tradition until the government abolished it due to tensions with China.

They were under the direct command of the sh≈çgun and were in charge of undercover intelligence operations. In actuality, their work consisted more often of reporting any news about the city of Edo to the sh≈çgun or remaining incognito to inspect and report on the states of affairs in the countryside. Their activities were comparable to those of the inspectors and general inspectors of the shogunate albeit under the direct orders from the sh≈çgun. Most historical plays and novels of the era depicted them as spies or ninjas, a tradition that continues to this time in popular culture. Oniwaban were male servers in the inner palace of the sh≈çgun during the Edo shogunate where they served under the command of junior elders. They were the guards of the Edo castle who kept the security and checked every single thing for the sake of the Shogun's safety. There were restrictions placed on them regarding their contact with outsiders. They could only marry within their profession. The Oniwaban who originated as ninjas lost their utility following the establishment of the Edo shogunate. While relatively low in ranking, as they could directly communicate with the sh≈çgun, they were able to attain some power. Some among their ranks were able to become close advisors or sent as diplomatic envoys. The character \\"niwa\\" in their name, meaning garden or yard, refers to the rumor that they were quartered in the garden of Edo Castle.  History  During the Edo period, onmitsu (the term meaning a spy or an undercover detective) acted as secret agents in security and espionage functions, mainly intelligence and information gathering, sometimes with aid of kobushikata, small groups of lower-class agents posing as mobile manual laborers and working under Iga ninja supervisors. The oniwaban followed a strict set of regulations, which, in some cases, forbade them from socializing with the general public. Tokugawa Yoshimune established the Oniwaban as an elite cadre of originally about 20 handpicked onmitsu, providing him with information about daimy≈ç feudal lords and shogunate officials,John Whitney Hall, The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan, Cambridge University Press (p. 443) while also protecting high-ranking officials of the government and acting as security guards in the Edo Castle. They were possibly quartered in the garden of the castle, hence the name. According to some sources, during the tumultuous time of the Bakumatsu revolution the oniwaban were even sent to the United States to spy not only on the shogun's opposition, but on the Americans as well.Joel Levy, Ninja: The Shadow Warrior, Sterling Publishing Company (pp. 44‚Äì45)  In popular culture  The Oniwaban have been depicted as the main characters in the television series ≈åedo S≈çsam≈ç (an undercover group of secret agents, including Isaka J≈´z≈ç, J≈´monji Koyata, Konami and others) and Sh≈çgun no Onmitsu! Kage J≈´hachi (the group of Kan≈ç Ametar≈ç: Miki, Otojir≈ç and Inokichi, brought together by Tokugawa Munetada) and in the film Oniwaban (known in English as Demon Spies). They were also featured in the TV series Abarenb≈ç Sh≈çgun (being the spies and bodyguards for Yoshimune, including Akane, Ayame, Gor≈çta, Hayate, Osono, J≈´monji Hayato, Koyuki, Kaede, Nagisa, ≈åtsuki Hanz≈ç, Saiz≈ç, Satsuki and Sukehachi), as well as in the manga/anime series Ga-rei (Hattori Naizou, a member of the Judgement Day brigade, was an Oniwaban in life), Gin Tama (Ayame Sarutobi, Zenzo Hattori and Jiraia), Lone Wolf and Cub, Peace Maker (Shinsengumi member Yamazaki Ayumu), Samurai Champloo (Kariya Kagetoki), The Dagger of Kamui (the oniwaban monk Tenkai) and Yoshimune (the character Kunoichi, in love with the titular character). The first Shadow Warriors TV series has Oniwaban existing under Tokugawa Ietsuna, the fourth Tokugawa Shogun, but they are Kouga Ninja working against the Iga Ninja. The Oniwaban also appears in One Piece where they works for the Shogun Orochi. Some depictions feature the oniwaban in a time period following end of the shogunate, like the manga/anime series Rurouni Kenshin (featuring the now-unemployed Oniwaban group including Aoshi Shinomori, Beshimi, Han'nya, Hyottoko, Okina, Shikij≈ç and Makimachi Misao) and Yokuj≈ç Climax (Hayato); others take place in an altogether fictional alternative worlds, even in the futuristic science fiction setting, such as in the case of the anime Chou SD Sengokuden Bushin Kirahagane (Jyuuha Gundam), the video game Red Earth (Oniwaban leader Kenji), and the miniatures game Infinity. In the anime series Sailor Moon the name of the villain of the week Oniwabandana (renamed Ninjana in the English version) is also an obvious pun on the oniwaban.

It threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance to any country at war.  Background  News that Revolutionary France had declared war on Great Britain in February 1793, and with this declaration that France, by the country's own volition, was now at war with all of Europe, did not reach America until the first half of April of that year. President Washington was at Mount Vernon attending the funeral of a nephew when he was given the news. He hurried back to Pennsylvania and summoned a cabinet meeting on April 19. It was unanimously agreed to issue a proclamation \\"forbidding citizens to take part in any hostilities in the seas, on behalf of or against any of the belligerent powers.\\" Washington's members agreed that neutrality was essential; the nation was too young and its military was too small to risk any sort of engagement with either France or Britain. Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, in particular, saw in this question, the influence of the Federalists ‚Äî his political rivals; yet he too agreed a proclamation was in order, though perhaps not an official one. In a cabinet meeting of January 14th, Thomas Jefferson argued that while neutrality was a sine qua non, there was no real need to make a Proclamation of Neutrality either immediately or even officially; perhaps there might be no need for an official declaration at all. The United States could declare its neutrality for a price, Jefferson intimated, \\"Why not stall and make countries bid for [American] neutrality?\\" In response, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton declared that American neutrality was not negotiable. Jefferson eventually resigned from his duty as Secretary of State in disagreement with the Proclamation of Neutrality. Text of the proclamation  Debates  The proclamation started a war of pamphlets between Alexander Hamilton (writing for the Federalists), and James Madison (writing for the Democratic-Republicans) commonly known as the Pacificus‚ÄìHelvidius debates. In his seven essays, written under the nom de plume \\"Pacificus\\", Hamilton dealt with objections to the proclamation. Among his arguments were: * The decree was, in fact, constitutional; for while Congress has the sole right to declare war, it is \\"the duty of the executive to preserve peace till the war is declared.\\" * The Proclamation of Neutrality did not violate the United States' defensive alliance with France, as the Democratic-Republicans were claiming. The treaty, Hamilton pointed out, was a defensive alliance and did not apply to offensive wars, \\"and it was France that had declared war upon other European powers\\", not the other way around. * By siding with France the United States would have left itself open to attacks within American borders by the governments of Great Britain and Spain stirring up \\"numerous Indian tribes\\" influenced by these two governments. Thomas Jefferson (having read several of the \\"Pacificus\\" essays) encouraged James Madison to reply. Madison was initially hesitant. From his Virginia plantation, he offered Jefferson excuses as to why he could not write a reply, including that he didn't have the necessary books and papers to refute \\"Pacificus\\", that the summer heat was \\"oppressive\\", and that he had many house guests who were wearing out their welcome. Ultimately, Madison agreed to Jefferson's request, though afterward, he wrote to him, \\"I have forced myself in to the task of a reply. I can truly say I find it the most grating one I have ever experienced.\\" Writing under the name \\"Helvidius\\", Madison's five essays showed the animosity that had evolved with the two political factions. He attacked Federalists, and Hamilton in particular, and anyone who supported the Neutrality Proclamation as secret monarchists, declaring: \\"Several features with the signature of Pacificus were [as of] late published, which have been read with singular pleasure and applause by the foreigners and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our republican government and the French Revolution.\\" Madison brought to light the strict constructionist's view of both the Constitution and the Proclamation, demanding that Congress, not the president, had full authority over all foreign affairs except those areas specified in the Constitution.

Widely recognized for recording television commercials, infomercials, and interviews in colorful suits decorated with question marks, Lesko's signature fashion also extends into his daily attire and transportation, earning him the nickname Question Mark Guy. Life and career Lesko grew up in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. Lesko received his undergraduate degree from Marquette University in Milwaukee. Upon graduation he was commissioned as an officer in the Navy. In the Navy, he served as a navigator aboard the USS Oxford in the South China Sea during the Vietnam War.Triplett, William. \\"Matthew Lesko The 'Free Money' Man: Asking the Right Questions\\", Vietnam Veterans of America, The VVA Veteran Online magazine, May/June 2019. Retrieved 4 August 2019. When Lesko returned he earned a master's degree in business administration (MBA) from American University in Washington, D.C. In 1975, Lesko quit his job designing computerized information systems and co-founded Washington Researchers with his then-wife Leila K. Kight. After a slow start, Lesko hit upon the idea of sending out a professional newsletter telling people how to get free information. The newsletter started bringing in clients, and by 1979 Washington Researchers employed 30 people in its Washington, D.C. office. As side lines of business, Lesko began publishing directories for those who preferred to do their own research, such as the Researcher's Guide to Washington, and conducting seminars on the types of information then available from the government. Lesko was able to interest publisher Viking in his idea to publish a directory of government information sources in 1980. That book, Getting Yours: The Complete Guide to Government Money, was published by Viking's Penguin subsidiary in 1982. He claims to have researched government grants for over 25 years. Lesko lives in Kensington, Maryland, with his third wife Wendy Schaetzel Lesko and their two sons, Max and Morgan. Criticism Critics claim that Lesko is misleading in his advertisements. A 2004 report by the New York State Consumer Protection Board claimed that most of the grants mentioned in Lesko's books were actually public assistance programs that many people were not eligible for, and that Lesko misrepresented examples of people who had taken advantage of government programs. The New York Times criticized him for having implied a current association with the paper long after ending a 1992‚Äì1994 NYT column. \\"In August 2006, Lesko modified his credentials on his Web site, lesko.com, which described him (as his books did) as a columnist for Good Housekeeping Magazine and The New York Times Syndicate. He wrote the magazine column in the 1980s and the column for the syndicate from 1992 to 1994. Both organizations recently told him that these did not justify his suggestion of a current association.\\" In 2005, Lesko was named #99 in Bernard Goldberg's book 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America because, \\"He is a symbol for self-centered free-riders.\\" In an interview with the Washington Post in July 2007, Lesko admitted having assembled his books from government guides to grants and loans, quoting Lesko as saying of his first book \\"I plagiarized the whole thing\\" and \\"I didn't write a lick.\\" Lesko later added \\"I get stuff for free and I sell it for as much as I can get.\\" In popular culture Lesko visits the White House as a guest of his son, a White House staffer. * In the season four episode of The Venture Bros. titled \\"The Better Man\\", Jefferson Twilight trains with cardboard cut-outs of various villains.

Twisted projects variously support TCP, UDP, SSL/TLS, IP multicast, Unix domain sockets, many protocols (including HTTP, XMPP, NNTP, IMAP, SSH, IRC, FTP, and others), and much more. Twisted is based on the event-driven programming paradigm, which means that users of Twisted write short callbacks which are called by the framework. Core ideas =Separation of protocols and transports= Twisted is designed for complete separation between logical protocols (usually relying on stream-based connection semantics, such as HTTP or POP3) and physical transport layers supporting such stream-based semantics (such as files, sockets or SSL libraries). Connection between a logical protocol and a transport layer happens at the last possible moment ‚Äî just before information is passed into the logical protocol instance. The logical protocol is informed of the transport layer instance, and can use it to send messages back and to check for the peer's identity. Note that it is still possible, in protocol code, to deeply query the transport layer on transport issues (such as checking a client-side SSL certificate). Naturally, such protocol code will fail (raise an exception) if the transport layer does not support such semantics. =Deferreds= Central to the Twisted application model is the concept of a deferred (elsewhere called a future). A deferred is an instance of a class designed to receive and process a result which has not been computed yet, for example because it is based on data from a remote peer. Deferreds can be passed around, just like regular objects, but cannot be asked for their value. Each deferred supports a callback chain. When the deferred gets the value, it is passed to the functions on the callback chain, with the result of each callback becoming the input for the next. Deferreds make it possible to operate on the result of a function call before its value has become available. For example, if a deferred returns a string from a remote peer containing an IP address in quad format, a callback can be attached to translate it into a 32-bit number. Any user of the deferred can now treat it as a deferred returning a 32-bit number. This, and the related ability to define \\"errbacks\\" (callbacks which are called as error handlers), allows code to specify in advance what to do when an asynchronous event occurs, without stopping to wait for the event. In non-event-driven systems, for example using threads, the operating system incurs premature and additional overhead organizing threads each time a blocking call is made. =Thread support= Twisted supports an abstraction over raw threads ‚Äî using a thread as a deferred source. Thus, a deferred is returned immediately, which will receive a value when the thread finishes. Callbacks can be attached which will run in the main thread, thus alleviating the need for complex locking solutions. A prime example of such usage, which comes from Twisted's support libraries, is using this model to call into databases. The database call itself happens on a foreign thread, but the analysis of the result happens in the main thread. =Foreign loop support= Twisted can integrate with foreign event loops, such as those of GTK+, Qt and Cocoa (through PyObjC). This allows using Twisted as the network layer in graphical user interface (GUI) programs, using all of its libraries without adding a thread-per-socket overhead, as using Python's native library would. A full-fledged web server can be integrated in- process with a GUI program using this model, for example.

The character is introduced as the ordinary, working class boyfriend of Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London shopgirl who becomes a travelling companion to the Ninth and Tenth incarnations of an alien Time Lord known as the Doctor. Mickey first appears in the first episode of the 2005 revival, \\"Rose\\". Initially someone who struggles in the face of danger, Mickey nevertheless acts as an Earth-based ally to the Doctor and Rose. In the second series he joins the pair as a second companion of the Doctor's, though leaves during the 2006 series to pursue his own adventures. He returns to aid the Doctor and Rose in the series finale later that year, and then again for the 2008 finale \\"Journey's End,\\" as well as fleetingly in 2010 in the Tenth Doctor send-off \\"The End of Time\\". Executive producer Russell T Davies created the character alongside Rose's mother Jackie (Camille Coduri) in order to provide a home context for Rose. The character's dubious personality traits were made evident; both Davies and Clarke postulated that the character \\"deserved to lose his girlfriend\\". Though Clarke felt his character was initially \\"a clown\\" he enjoyed having the chance to mature Mickey into a more heroic character in his later appearances. Television commentators generally reacted positively to this character growth. In 2007 the entertainment and media news website Digital Spy highlighted him as a \\"Cult Spy Icon\\". Appearances =Television= Doctor Who Experience Mickey Smith is first introduced in the series' 2005 reboot premi√®re episode, \\"Rose\\". When Mickey's girlfriend Rose (Billie Piper) begins investigating a mysterious alien called the Doctor (Christopher Eccleston), Mickey is captured by the alien Nestene Consciousness, from which a living plastic facsimile of him (an 'auton') is created. Mickey, terrified by the revelation that alien life exists, fails to impress the Doctor, who only invites Rose to be his travelling companion in time and space. In the year since Rose absconded with the Doctor, Mickey has been the prime suspect for Rose's disappearance and has become distressed as a result. However, he assists the pair in defeating the Slitheen, a family of extraterrestrial criminals; using his computer hacking skills, he commandeers a military harpoon missile which he targets at 10 Downing Street to kill the Slitheen. Mickey then declines an invitation from the Doctor to join him and Rose in the TARDIS. A much younger Mickey, played by Casey Dyer, appears briefly when Rose attempts to alter her childhood in \\"Father's Day\\". In \\"Boom Town\\", Mickey later meets up with the Doctor, Rose and new companion Captain Jack (John Barrowman) in Cardiff, where he helps them foil a Slitheen plot. In the series' finale episode \\"The Parting of the Ways\\", when Rose becomes stranded at home at the Powell Estate, Mickey uses a recovery truck to crack open the TARDIS's console, through which Rose is able to absorb the time vortex and save the universe from an invasion of the hateful mutant alien Daleks. Having investigated a case of possible alien activity on Earth, Mickey alerts the Doctor and Rose to strange goings on at a school run by Headmaster Lucas Finch (Anthony Head) in \\"School Reunion\\". On meeting the Doctor's former companions, investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith (Elisabeth Sladen) and robot dog K-9, Mickey begins to see himself negatively as the K-9 to Rose's Sarah Jane: \\"the tin dog\\". In the episode's conclusion, the Doctor finally takes Mickey aboard as his companion. He appears in the next three episodes \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\" and two-parter \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\"/\\"The Age of Steel\\", where the trio end up in a parallel world where vicious, emotionless Cybermen have just been invented. There, Mickey is mistaken for his parallel universe doppelg√§nger \\"Ricky Smith\\", the leader of a human resistance group called the Preachers. In the story's conclusion, following Ricky's death, Mickey decides to stay behind in the parallel world to look after the parallel version of his grandmother (Mona Hammond) and fight the Cybermen; Mickey's grandmother is dead in his universe. However, Mickey makes a surprise reappearance in finale episodes \\"Army of Ghosts\\" and \\"Doomsday\\", wherein like the Cybermen, he and fellow Preacher Jake Simmonds (Andrew Hayden-Smith) are able to cross the Void into our world. There, they help the Doctor repel simultaneous Dalek and Cybermen invasions. In the episode's conclusion Mickey returns to the parallel world, this time with Rose who is now also trapped there. Mickey returns again in the series four finale episode \\"Journey's End\\" (2008), along with Jackie. Alongside many other recurring characters, they have come to help the Doctor defeat Davros (Julian Bleach), the creator of the Daleks. Mickey and Jackie save Sarah Jane from a Dalek attack, and the trio then surrenders to other Daleks in order to be taken to the Dalek headquarters, the spaceship Crucible. There they join forces with Captain Jack. After Donna (Catherine Tate) defeats Davros, Mickey is one of several former companions who pilot the TARDIS. In the episode's conclusion, Mickey declines to return to the parallel universe because, having both broken up with Rose and lost his \\"parallel\\" grandmother, he can find no reason to go back. Leaving the TARDIS, he follows after Jack and the Doctor's former companion, UNIT officer Martha Jones (Freema Agyeman). Mickey next makes a brief final appearance in the Tenth Doctor's final episode \\"The End of Time\\" (2010), when the dying Tenth Doctor visits all his companions and saves the now-married Mickey and Martha, \\"freelance alien hunters\\", from a Sontaran sniper. =Online media= Mickey appeared extensively in electronic literature and tie-in videos hosted by the BBC website. These websites are \\"in-universe\\", part of an alternate reality game set within the show. Concurrent with the 2005 series, Mickey ran the conspiracy theorist website \\"Who is Doctor Who?\\" (first featured in \\"Rose\\"). In the 2006 series, however, the website became \\"Defending the Earth\\". Both featured videos of Clarke as Mickey, informing the viewer of facts about the series, or introducing \\"missions\\" which would be played out in online Macromedia/Adobe Flash games. Several of Mickey's blog entries tied into the overarching Torchwood story arc, depicting interceptions by the Torchwood Institute. Games include tie-ins to the plots of 2006 series episodes, such as \\"Tooth and Claw\\" and \\"Fear Her\\". Clarke also starred as Mickey Smith and Ricky Smith in several online 'Tardisodes'; these were 60-second webisodes and mobisodes (available online and via mobile phone download), which only aired in 2006. For the \\"School Reunion\\" TARDISODE, Mickey is researching UFO sightings online when he is blocked by a notice referring to Torchwood, prompting him to call Rose to investigate. In the TARDISODE prequel to \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\", Ricky Smith is seen viewing a message sent to all the Preachers, again on his laptop. =Literature= Mickey appears in one New Series Adventures novel alongside the Doctor and Rose, Winner Takes All (2005), and two Tenth Doctor novels, The Stone Rose and The Feast of the Drowned. These novels are set before Mickey joins the Doctor and Rose as traveling companion in the episode \\"School Reunion\\". Mickey features as the centric character in the short story \\"Taking Mickey\\" from the Doctor Who Files series of hardbacks from BBC Children's Books. In Gareth Roberts' Doctor Who Magazine comic book story \\"The Lodger\\", the Tenth Doctor is forced to cohabit with Mickey; this story was later adapted into an Eleventh Doctor (Matt Smith) episode of the same name, with Mickey's role supplanted by that of Craig Owens (James Corden). In the comic book story \\"The Green-Eyed Monster\\", Rose becomes jealous when Mickey appears to suddenly have several Amazonian girlfriends. It is later revealed that these were actors hired by the Doctor in his bid to defeat a creature that feeds on jealousy which had possessed Rose. In the ongoing Ninth Doctor comic series, an unconventional storyline sees Mickey Smith, from a time after he has witnessed the Tenth Doctor depart for his regeneration, forced to deal with mysterious events in San Francisco with the aid of the Ninth Doctor. During this storyline, Mickey takes care to prevent himself being seen by Rose or the Ninth Doctor witnessing his wife Martha, with it being implied that this sight of what Mickey would become influenced the Tenth Doctor's higher opinion of Mickey after his regeneration. Development Clarke dressed as Mickey Smith on the Doctor Who set, March 2008. In accepting the role Noel Clarke comments that he \\"had to have a lot of faith\\" in executive producers Russell T Davies and Julie Gardner because he felt the series was not of high quality at the time of its previous cancellation. Mickey was created alongside Rose's mother Jackie in order to explore the question of who is left behind after a companion leaves earth to travel with the Doctor. Russell T Davies created the two characters and returned frequently to them in order to make Rose \\"real\\" and \\"give her a life\\". Whilst Billie Piper, who played Rose, felt that the character of Rose was \\"ruthless\\" in abandoning elements from her home life, Clarke commented that he felt anybody would do the same, stating \\"who can blame her really?\\" He felt that Rose's relationship with Mickey consisted of her \\"sitting on the couch, watching him watch football\\". Retrospectively viewing the episode \\"Rose\\" in 2009, Davies identifies Mickey's characterisation as \\"naturally selfish\\"‚Äîin the same vein he identifies many of his characters‚Äîdrawing into question his \\"mysterious emails\\" and the fact he \\"abandons Rose for the football down the pub\\". He suggests that the character \\"deserved to lose his girlfriend, right from the start\\". Clarke feels the character of Mickey wasn't widely liked in the first series, admitting that he also saw the part as a \\"kids‚Äô TV\\" role. Following the production of series one, Davies took Clarke and Coduri out for dinner to discuss their contracts for the second series. Davies reveals that Clarke was excited about Mickey's development in the second series, particularly having the chance to carry a large gun and be an action hero. Clarke noted that he was \\"amazed\\" by the scripts for the second series, as he felt Mickey had at times been written as a \\"buffoon\\". He felt that the character had gotten \\"progressively braver\\" throughout the series and that as an actor he found it fulfilling that people had gone from disliking the character to saying \\"how they love this guy now\\". Mickey's character arc sees him join the Doctor and Rose as a companion, becoming in turn the shows first ethnic minority companion. Billie Piper explained that this upsets Rose initially because she \\"likes to keep her life separate\\" and \\"wants The Doctor to herself because she's selfish like that\\". Tennant stated that through his actions, Mickey \\"earns his spot on board the TARDIS\\". Clarke stated that he didn't want to focus on his status as the show's first ethnic minority companion, stating \\"the fact that I happen to be a black actor is beside the point, I'm an actor first\\". However, he felt that it provided a positive effect in that young fans of ethnic origin would no longer have to be a monster or alien when role-playing characters from the series. \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" and its online Tardisode prequel, set in a parallel universe, featured Mickey's doppelg√§nger, Ricky Smith. Clarke stated that he enjoyed the chance to play a \\"macho, gruff version of the character\\" and also to play two different characters. However, he explained that the scenes which featured both Mickey and Ricky were difficult to film as they involved green screen work, and the necessity of Clarke filming each character's part separately. A deleted scene from \\"The Age of Steel\\", suggests that Ricky was originally intended to be in a gay relationship with his co- fighter Jake. The scene, included in the Series Two DVD release, shows Jake telling Mickey that he can't replace Ricky, as he will \\"never have another boyfriend like him.\\" More information from bbc.co.uk Following Mickey's appearance in \\"Journey's End\\" the production team had intended for Clarke to join spin-off show Torchwood for its third series in 2009, but his career led him elsewhere. Reflecting on his time on Doctor Who in 2010 Clarke stated that he was happy with his character's development during the series. He comments that over the course of his appearances, Mickey develops from \\"a clown\\" into \\"someone with a bit more edge and a bit more stubble.\\" Reception Charles McGrath of The New York Times described Mickey in \\"Rose\\" as Rose's \\"well- meaning but dopey boyfriend\\". In their review of the episodes \\"Aliens of London\\" and \\"World War Three\\" Graeme Burk and Robert Smith praised the character's development stating that \\"by the time he faces down a Slitheen in his apartment, armed only with a baseball bat... you want him to become a regular companion.\\" The authors felt that the character had \\"grown magnificently\\" by the time of his temporary departure in the second series, remarking favourably on his \\"zero to hero\\" arc in light of his status as the first ethnic minority companion in the televised series. By \\"Army of Ghosts\\"/\\"Doomsday\\" they contend that the character is \\"at last... flirtatious, smart and dashing\\". IGN's Ahsan Haque praised the addition of Mickey as a companion in \\"The Girl in the Fireplace\\", writing that he \\"adds a new sense of discovery to the show, as the audience can easily relate to his sense of awe and his infectious excitement about being onboard a spaceship\\". Haque was also positive about Mickey's development in \\"Rise of the Cybermen\\" when he finds his parallel universe counterpart and his grandmother alive in the parallel universe, as Haque felt that previously \\"he's always been treated as a tossed- aside comic relief character that has no bearing on the story\\". In a review for the follow-up, \\"The Age of Steel\\", Haque believed the episode was \\"worth watching\\" to see Mickey \\"finally [step] up and finds a purpose\\" and become a hero. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy highlighted Mickey as a \\"Cult Spy Icon\\", praising his development into a hero. In 2015 Michael Hogan of The Daily Telegraph criticised the general portrayal of male companion figures in Doctor Who. He described Mickey, alongside 2010-2012 character Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) and 2014 character Danny Pink (Samuel Anderson) as all \\"basically soppy, sappy, slightly annoying plus-ones to far superior females\\".

A Democrat, Bland served in the United States House of Representatives from 1873 to 1895 and from 1897 to 1899, representing at various times the Missouri 5th, 8th and 11th congressional districts. Nicknamed \\"Silver Dick\\" for his efforts to promote bimetallism, Bland is best known for the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act. Born in Kentucky, he established a legal practice in Utah Territory after working as a miner and schoolteacher. He served as the treasurer of Carson County from 1860 to 1864 during the peak years of the Comstock Lode mining rush. He settled in Missouri in 1865 and established a legal practice in Lebanon, Missouri. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1872 and quickly established himself as a leading advocate of the free silver movement. He sponsored the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act, which required the United States Department of the Treasury to buy a certain amount of silver and put it into circulation as silver dollars.Ari Arthur Hoogenboom, Rutherford B. Hayes: Warrior and President (1995) pp 96-98 He also established himself as an anti-imperialist. Bland lost re-election in the 1894 election but won his seat back in 1896. Bland was a leading candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1896, though he expressed reluctance about running for president. His marriage to a Catholic woman engendered opposition from the anti-Catholic elements of the party. Bland received the most votes on the first three ballots of the 1896 Democratic National Convention, but not enough to win the necessary majority. William Jennings Bryan, who also favored bimetallism, won the Democratic nomination on the fifth ballot and went on to lose to Republican William McKinley in the 1896 presidential election. After the convention, Bland served in the House from 1897 to his death in 1899. Early life and education Bland was born near Hartford, Ohio County, Kentucky to Stoughton Edward and Mary P. (Nall) Bland. His father was a descendant of one of the First Families of Virginia, including statesman and Continental Congress member Richard Bland. The Blands and Nalls were among the early families to emigrate from Virginia with Daniel Boone into the Kentucky wilderness. Despite the family pedigree and wealth in Virginia, Richard and his three siblings were raised in relative poverty on his parents' small farm. In 1842, when Richard Bland was seven years old, the situation was exacerbated by the unexpected death of his father. His mother's death followed in 1849, leaving the young teenager an orphan and forcing Bland to hire himself out as a farm laborer to survive. Despite growing up poor, he was able to attend Hartford College and graduate with a teacher's certificate. Bland then taught school in his hometown for two years before moving to Wayne County, Missouri at age 20, in 1855. His first time of residence in Missouri was brief, Bland teaching just one term at a school in Patterson, Missouri before heading further west to California. While there he began to study law. He then moved to the western portion of the Utah Territory, part of present- day western Nevada, where he taught school, and tried his hand at prospecting and mining. It appears, from a eulogy delivered in Congress, that while in the West Bland was also involved in conflict with Native Americans on multiple occasions, although few details are known. While teaching school he continued to study law and after passing the bar began practicing in Virginia City and Carson City. It was during his time in California and Nevada he developed a lifelong interest in mining, silver in particular. Political career Richard P. Bland's first elected office was treasurer of Carson County, Utah Territory from 1860 to 1864, the height of the Comstock Lode mining rush. Left without a job following Nevada's statehood and government reorganizing, in 1865 Bland returned to Missouri and began the practice of law with his brother Charles in the town of Rolla. The siblings remained in practice together until 1869 when he moved to Lebanon, Missouri, seeing the town as more commercially viable because a predecessor of the St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad had recently laid track through the town. In 1872, he was elected as a Democrat to the United States House of Representatives in the 43rd Congress. From the start of his tenure, silver would be an issue of great importance to Bland. The Panic of 1873 and Coinage Act of 1873 hit Missouri and other Midwestern farmers particularly hard, leading to foreclosures and closing of businesses dependent on agriculture.Irwin Unger, The Greenback Era: A Social and Political History of American Finance, 1865-1879 (1964) pp 356-65 In 1878, along with Iowa Republican William Allison he sponsored the Bland‚ÄìAllison Act. This act mandated the use of both gold and silver as U.S. currency and allowed silver to be purchased at market rates, metals to be minted into silver dollars, and required the US Treasury to purchase between $2 million and $4 million of silver each month from western mines.Acts, Bills, and Laws, 1878.U.S. History. March 14th Vetoed by President Rutherford Hayes, Congress voted again on the measure overriding the President. The act stood until President Grover Cleveland repealed the act in 1893.Our large change: The Denominations of the Currency. Quarterly Journal of Economics. 1918. Oxford University Press. JSTOR. March 14th 2011 Bland's nicknames -- \\"The Great Commoner\\" and \\"Silver Dick\\"‚Äî reflected his efforts to help both the common man and the silver miners. His 25-year campaign for a bimetallic standard made him a friend and advocate for agriculture and western miners. However, Bland was far more than a one-issue legislator. He frequently involved himself in debates on tariff issues, government bonds, and taxation of the citizenry. Bland strongly opposed Reconstruction Era electoral commissions and bitterly opposed the use of U.S. Marshals or Federal troops at polling places. In matters of foreign policy Bland was an anti-imperialist. He was re-elected to the House ten times, narrowly defeated in 1894, regained his seat in 1896, was re-elected in 1898, and died in office in 1899. While a member of the House he was chairman of the Committee on Mines and Mining in the 44th Congress. Bland was chairman of the Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures in the 48th Congress, 49th Congress, 50th Congress, 52nd Congress, and 53rd Congress. Former Washington, D.C. residence (center) of Richard P. Bland =Election of 1896= Richard Bland was a strong, if reluctant, candidate for United States President in 1896. He is quoted as saying \\"I have no desire in this direction. I have no ambition for this nomination and I am afraid my friends, thrusting my personality into this contest may confuse the greater question.\\". That question of course, like most tied to Bland, was currency and bimetalism. Rather than travel to the Democratic Convention in Chicago, Illinois Bland chose to remain on his 160-acre farm near Lebanon, Missouri as the political drama played out. At first the convention balloting seemed to be going Bland's way. He beat William Jennings Bryan 236 to 137 on the first ballot, 281 to 197 on the second, and 291 to 219 on the third. However, none were of the two- thirds margin to secure the nomination outright. By this time, the full impact of Bryan's Cross of Gold speech began to be felt and understood by the delegates. Bryan took the lead on the fourth ballot 280-241. Bland, not wishing to risk a split party, sent a telegram to his supporters in Chicago throwing his support behind Bryan saying \\"Put the cause above the man.\\" With that, the fifth ballot was a mere formality, with Bryan claiming a 652 to 11 victory. There still existed the possibility of Bland on the ticket as candidate for Vice-President. He trailed considerably behind on the first ballot, but gained steam to win the second and third balloting, although again by not enough margin to earn the nomination. Bland at this time, never enthralled with the idea in the first place, declined his name being considered in any further balloting, paving the way for Arthur Sewall to become Bryan's ticketmate. Death Richard P. Bland died at his home in Lebanon, Missouri on June 15, 1899. He had been in failing health for some years, and in the spring of 1899 returned to Lebanon from Washington, D.C. to recover from a severe throat infection, but his condition only worsened.Christensen, Lawrence O.,Dictionary of Missouri Biography, University of Missouri Press, 1999 He is buried in the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Lebanon, Missouri. A crowd of several thousand flocked to the small Missouri Ozarks town to attend Bland's funeral. Personal life Richard Bland married Virginia Elizabeth Mitchell of Rolla on December 19, 1873. Mrs. Bland was the daughter of Confederate General Ewing Young Mitchell. The couple had a total of nine children, six that were still living at the time of his death: Theodric, Ewing, Frances, John, George, and Virginia. The Blands marriage was somewhat unusual for the time period, he being Protestant and son of a trained Presbyterian minister, and she being Catholic. The children were raised in the Catholic faith, something which along with his marriage led to derision and bigotry by opponents during his 1896 bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination. Replying to critics, Bland stated \\"Yes my wife is a Roman Catholic and I am a Protestant, and shall live and die one; but my regret is that I am not half such a Christian as the woman who bears my name and is the mother of my children.\\" Bland was a Freemason, a member of Lodge 231 in Rolla, Missouri. One of his siblings, brother Charles C. Bland, was also involved with the legal profession, eventually serving as a judge in the Missouri 18th Judicial Circuit. Bland's brother-in-law Ewing Young Mitchell, Jr., with his help became a U.S. Senate page in 1886 and would remain in politics throughout his life, eventually becoming assistant Secretary of Commerce under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

It is a newer residential subdivision in the west/central part of Ottawa, developed from 1984 onwards, and is informally bounded by Baseline Road to the north, Woodroffe Avenue to the east, the CN railroad to the south, and the Briargreen subdivision and Forest Ridge Apartments to the west. The housing stock includes approximately 1,000 detached homes, with the remainder mostly townhomes (row houses) and terrace homes. According to the Canada 2016 Census, the neighbourhood had a total population of 7,245. Previously farmland, it was purchased by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, which let the land lay fallow for many years. It had been intended to be developed as a demonstration model of an \\"ideal community\\". After facing budget cuts, CMHC sold the land, with most being sold off to Ottawa's largest housing developer Minto Group, which built and sold off a wide range of homes from townhouses to large upscale houses. The neighbourhood was built to be Nepean's \\"downtown\\", with plans to build shops and offices and a civic square, to house Nepean's city hall. The neighbourhood was built as a \\"self-contained community\\" and was projected to cost $700 million. Its major attraction is Ben Franklin Place, named for the former mayor of Nepean, which houses the Centrepointe Branch of the Ottawa Public Library, the locally renowned Centrepointe Theatre, and the former Nepean City Hall (now housing satellite offices for the City of Ottawa). The neighbourhood has a significant Jewish population. The 2011 National Household Survey indicated that 13% of the neighbourhood's population was Jewish. The Centrepointe Community Association was formed on February 4, 2006 to represent and advance the interests of neighbourhood residents. A major issue confronting the association is the City of Ottawa's proposed development of the Centrepointe Town Centre concept, which could add up to two million square feet of high density residential and commercial space to the area. Residential construction in Centrepointe continues. In 2007, a former snowdump next to Centrepointe Park was converted into approximately 260 townhouses, terrace homes and low-rise apartments, which was completed in early 2011. The Centrepointe Community Association has not been very active as of late; however, it does advertise a community garage sale each spring. An Annual General Meeting at 7:00 PM on October 26, 2011 at Ben Franklin Place was held to discuss Richraft's new proposed development at the corner of Centrepointe Drive and Constellation Crescent. This particular piece of land was previously slated for development but the project never went ahead and is now under consideration by the builder, City of Ottawa and Community again. The easternmost portion of Centrepointe underwent major development. As of January 2012, construction had finished on three major projects: the City of Ottawa Archives at the corner of Tallwood Drive and Woodroffe Avenue, a new trades building for nearby Algonquin College, and expansion of Centrepointe Theatre at Ben Franklin Place. Baseline Station Portions of Constellation Boulevard were rerouted to accommodate the new buildings and as part of the City's long-term public transportation plan. Baseline Station is expected to be the terminus of Stage 2 of the LRT's Confederation Line, to be completed in 2023. Many school-aged children attend Briargreen, Manordale, Knoxdale (French Immersion), Greenbank Middle School and then Sir Robert Borden High School.

For a brief period starting 1992, the name was changed to Haigazian University College before the institution adopted the present name in 1996. It offers programs leading to Bachelor's degrees in the Arts and Sciences as well as Business Administration and Economics, in addition to Master's degrees in the Arts, Sciences and Business Administration. English is the main language of instruction, although some courses are offered in Armenian and Arabic. All degrees from Haigazian are recognized by the Lebanese government and the Association of International Colleges and Universities. It is supported by the Armenian Evangelical community, and was established primarily to meet the needs of the large Lebanese-Armenian population. However, the university is open to all students, regardless of race, nationality, or creed, and has professors and student body from all sections of Lebanese society.  History  =Beginnings= Haigazian University is named in honor of Dr. Armenag Haigazian (), former headmaster of the Jenanian Apostolic Institute of Konya, Turkey. Dr. Haigazian was a highly respected educator who received his Ph.D. from Yale University and returned to Turkey to serve his Armenian compatriots. When the genocide of the Armenians began, Dr. Haigazian had the opportunity to escape to the United States, but he chose to stay and continue his ministry. Later, he, along with many Armenian intellectuals, was rounded up to be driven into the Syrian desert. Dr. Haigazian died on the way in the prison of Kharpert in 1921 (New York Times article). Concurrently, eight Armenian colleges were also destroyed in Turkey. Although these aspects of education and service were brought to an end, the dream continued in the minds of Dr. Haigazian's descendants and others. The Mehagian family (Mary Mehagian and Florence Mehagian-Guertmenian) of Phoenix, Arizona, close relatives of Dr. Haigazian, donated capital through the AMAA and worked hand in hand with Stephen Philibosian to get Haigazian College started. The University was founded on October 17, 1955, by the Union of Armenian Evangelical Churches in the Near East (UAECNE) and the Armenian Missionary Association of America (AMAA) as a liberal arts college to assist in the preparation of teachers and pastors. Prior to this date, the Armenian Evangelical community of Beirut, to complement its high schools and the Teacher Training needs, had established two post-secondary educational programs: the Teacher's Training Institute, which was housed in the library of the Central High School and operated from 1948‚Äì51, and the Armenian Evangelical College, which held a Freshman Arts and Sciences program under the sponsorship of the First Armenian Evangelical Church of Beirut. These two entities merged in 1951 forming a Freshman Arts and Sciences plus a Sophomore Arts program, and they continued to serve the Armenian Community until 1955, when Haigazian College was established. =Haigazian College (1955-1992)= Haigazian College was originally designed to function as a junior college offering two years of university-level education. However, a demand for upper- division classes encouraged the institution to develop four year programs.

The society developed into the wider Lebanese space program and it produced the first rockets of the Arab World, which were capable of suborbital flight. In November 1960, a group of Haigazian College students got together under the guidance of Manoug Manougian (a Math and Physics instructor) to form the Haigazian College Rocket Society (HCRS). Aspects of the first single-stage rocket were assigned to each student. As a result of the lack of required equipment, the group was obliged to resort to flight testing without any fuel tests in the laboratories. After a number of failures, the project was crowned with success. In April 1961, a single-stage solid propellant rocket was Launched and reached an altitude of about one kilometer. With further improvements of the solid fuel system, a similar rocket called HCRS-3 was Launched all the way up to 2 000 m. The Lebanese President, Fouad Chehab, as a result of these experiments, met with the members of HCRS and granted financial assistance for the project (10 thousand LL for 1961 and 15 thousand LL for 1962). During the academic year 1961-1962, the society worked on two- stage rockets with further improvements of the separation system, solid fuel system, and vehicle design. On May 25, 1962, HCRS-7 Cedar was Launched up to 11,500 m, and the Lebanese Army was responsible for the security of the launch. In the summer of 1962, two more rockets, Cedar ll B and Cedar ll c, Were Launched to a distance of 20 km. Due to the successes of the HCRS new members joined and a new group was formed in 1962, it was called the Lebanese Rocket Society (LRS). The LRS was directed by a main committee of six members: Mr. M. Manougian of Haigazian College (Director), Dr. P. Mourad of AUB (advisor), Mr. Karamanougian of Haigazian college, Mr.J. Sfeir (Electronic engineer), Mr, E. Kai (Engineer geodesist), and an officer expert in ballistics (granted by the Army). Further tests were planned on design and construction of multistage rockets. Mr. Hart supervised the works of the HCRS while Mr. Manougian was in the U.S.A. Members of the HCRS at the College were: Hampartzum Karaguezian, Hrair Aintablian, Hrair Sahagian, Jirair Zenian, and Jean Jack Guvlekjian. On November 21, 1962 Cedar-3, a three-stage solid propellant rocket prepared by the Haigazian group was launched. It had a length of 6.80 m and weight of 1250 kg. After several other launchings, an accident occurred during the summer of 1964, which hospitalized 2 students, who later recovered. However, the launchings were ended then, and no \\"big bang\\" has taken place since. The outcome of these experiments was not a Haigazian student walking on the moon, but more students walking into Haigazian's admissions office. One has to realize that nowadays, after the Lebanese civil wars, the idea of a rocket is not very pleasing, but back in the 1960s when both the U.S.and the U.S.S.R. were trying to reach the moon, Haigazian College was also on track.

Education Seligman received his bachelor's degree in political science from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1971. He received his juris doctor degree from Harvard Law School in 1974. Career Before his service as the University of Rochester's president, Seligman served as the dean and Ethan A.H. Shepley University Professor at the Washington University School of Law. Prior to serving there, Seligman was the dean and Samuel M. Fegtly Professor of Law at the University of Arizona College of Law (1995‚Äì1999).

Early life Herbert Hollick-Kenyon was born in London, April 17, 1897. His mother, Annie Kate Kenyon, was the oldest child of James Harold Kenyon (1841-1891), founder of the prestigious London funeral directors, J.H.Kenyon. His father, Herbert Hollick by birth, was employed by the firm and by 1890 was a director. On his marriage to Annie Kenyon in September 1891 he appended 'Kenyon' to his name, becoming Herbert Hollick Kenyon. From 1892-1910 he was managing director. At an early age, Hollick-Kenyon, with his family, emigrated to Ewing's Landing in the province of British Columbia in Canada. He joined the Canadian army in 1914 as a trooper. He joined the Royal Flying Corps in 1917. In the spring of 1928 he joined Western Canada Airways in Winnipeg and commenced flying in Western Canada. He helped to pioneer the Prairie Air Mail routes and is credited with several \\"first flights\\". Polar search and rescue Prior to the start of World War II, Hollick-Kenyon participated as a pilot during several search-and-rescue missions for polar expeditions which had gone missing. These missions included searching for the MacAlpine Expedition in 1929 and Sigizmund Levanevsky who went missing during a trans-polar flight from Moscow to Alaska in 1937.

They flew 3500 km across the breadth of Antarctica, claiming of land for the United States of America. They were forced to land short of their goal due to the lack of fuel. They began walking, but due to the loss of their radio at the outset of the trip, had been assumed lost by the United States. They arrived at the Little America camp, where they remained for nearly two months.

The Montenegrin cap () is a cap traditionally worn in Montenegro by the Montenegrins and Serbs of Montenegro. Design and symbolism The cap is originally in the shape of a flat cylinder, having a red upper surface (called tepelak) not dissimilar to the Herzegovina and Lika caps. Prince-Bishop Petar II Petroviƒá Njego≈° wore it with a black rim (called derevija), and the definition given was as a sign of grief of occupied Kosovo. The Kosovo Myth was very popular in Montenegro. The enforcement of the cap upon the Montenegrin chieftains by Prince-Bishop Petar II was a mark of expression of then's dominating Serbian national identity. The national telling recorded the most often version of the cap as following: the black wrapper was a sign of grief for their once great Serbian Empire, the red the symbol of spilled blood at the Battle of Kosovo and the five small stripes on the top represent the remaining remains of the once great Serbian realm, which became increasingly popular amongst the common folk during the reign of Prince Danilo I Petroviƒá-Njego≈°. Within the stripes is angled a six star, representing the last free part, Montenegro, shining upon the fallen and conquered. During the Communist era in the second half of the 20th century instead of the Serb cross the Communist Red Star was implanted between the golden stripes, although it was not spread amongst the people and never accepted. Several years ago a new version appeared with a large modern (2004) Coat of Arms of Montenegro spread across the cap's red top, that is becoming increasingly popular as a sign of the Montenegrin nation's independence and sovereignty. A female version of the cap was introduced, so far worn almost exclusively by men. History Montenegrin cap has a history of three hundred years. Artwork from 1754 with portrait of Montenegrin from Pa≈°troviƒái is the oldest presentation of Montenegrin cap, only difference is that Pa≈°troviƒái cap is all in black color. It is assumed that the cap from Pa≈°troviƒái ie Montenegrin cap has pattern in Venetian cap.

At the 2011 census, the town had a population of 719. Cummins was named after William Patrick Cummins, a member of the South Australian House of Assembly from 1896 to 1907.Praite, R. and Tolley, J.C. (1970) Place Names of South Australia, p. 33. Adelaide: Rigby Limited. The town of Cummins was developed in 1910 a few years after the first settlers in the area arrived. The railway to Port Lincoln arrived in 1907. The bounded locality of Cummins includes the former railway sidings of Pillana (south of the town) and Wildeloo (north of it). The major industries are sheep farming and cereal grain growing. There is a junction of the narrow gauge Eyre Peninsula Railway within the town. The railway facilitates transfer of grain to the deep-water port at Port Lincoln, primarily for export. The Tod Highway and Bratten Way intersect at Cummins. A large grain storage and transshipment facility lies on the southern outskirts of town. Cummins is the headquarters of the District Council of Lower Eyre Peninsula. It is in the state electoral district of Flinders and the federal Division of Grey.

Its first duke was Federico II Gonzaga, member of the House of Gonzaga that ruled Mantua since 1328. The following year, the Duchy also acquired the March of Montferrat, thanks to the marriage between Gonzaga and Margaret Paleologa, Marchioness of Montferrat. The Duchy's historic power and influence under the Gonzaga family has made it one of the main artistic, cultural, and especially musical hubs of Northern Italy and the country as a whole. Mantua also had one of the most splendid courts of Italy and Europe in the fifteenth, sixteenth, and early seventeenth centuries. In 1708, after the death of Ferdinando Carlo Gonzaga, the last heir of the Gonzaga family, the Duchy ceased its existence. Their domains were divided between the House of Savoy, that obtained the remaining half of Montferrat, and the House of Habsburg, that obtained the city of Mantua itself. History Vincenzo II Gonzaga, by Peter Paul Rubens Ludovico III receiving the news of his son Francesco being elected cardinal, fresco by Andrea Mantegna in the Stanza degli Sposi of the Palazzo Ducale. = Background = After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Mantua was invaded by Byzantines, Lombards and Franks. In the 11th century it became a possession of Boniface of Canossa, marquis of Toscana. The last ruler of the family was the countess Matilde of Canossa (died 1115), who, according to legend, ordered the construction of the precious Rotonda di San Lorenzo (1082). After the death of Matilde of Canossa, Mantua became a free commune and strenuously defended itself from the Holy Roman Empire in the 12th and 13th centuries. During the Investiture Controversy, Pinamonte Bonacolsi took advantage of the chaotic situation to seize power‚Äîas Captain General of the People‚Äîin 1273. His family ruled Mantua for the next century, making it more prosperous and artistically beautiful. On 16 August 1328, the last Bonacolsi, Rinaldo, was overthrown in a revolt backed by the House of Gonzaga, a family of officials, namely the 60-year-old Luis and his sons Guy, Filippino and Feltrino. Ludovico, who had been podest√† of the city in 1318, was elected capitano del popolo (\\"people's captain\\"). The Gonzaga built new walls with five gates and renovated the architecture of the city in the 14th century, but the political situation in the city did not settle until Ludovico II eliminated his relatives, seizing power for himself in 1370. Through a payment of 120,000 golden florins in 1433, Gianfrancesco was appointed marquis of Mantua by Emperor Sigismund, whose niece Barbara of Brandenburg he married. In 1459 Pope Pius II held a diet in Mantua to proclaim a crusade against the Turks. = The Duchy = The first Duke of Mantua was Federico II, who acquired the title from Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in 1530. The following year, the family acquired the Marquisate of Montferrat through marriage. Federico commissioned Giulio Romano to build the famous Palazzo Te, in the periphery of the city, and profoundly improved the urbanistic assets of the city. In 1624, Ferdinando Gonzaga moved the ducal seat to a new residence, the Villa La Favorita, designed by the architect Nicol√≤ Sebregond, in Porto Mantovano. As many as eight hundred persons, including writers, artists, musicians, and even a troop of commedia dell'arte actors, enjoyed Gonzaga patronage in the early seventeenth century. In that time, the Gonzagas were patrons of the Flemish artist Peter Paul Rubens. The duchy also played a key role in the development of opera; Claudio Monteverdi lived there from about 1590 to 1612, and his Orfeo (1607) and other works were first presented there. In 1625 Ferdinando Gonzaga founded the University of Mantua, where Jesuits taught humanities and philosophy, while laymen taught law and medicine. However, in order to pay for their splendid court, the Gonzaga family sold some of its assets, in 1627 Vincenzo Gonzaga sold the family collection of Renaissance paintings, including works of Titian, Andrea Mantegna, Correggio and Raphael to Charles I of England. In 1627, the direct line of the Gonzaga family came to an end with the vicious and weak Vincenzo II, and the town slowly declined under the new rulers, the Gonzaga Nevers, a cadet French branch of the family. The War of the Mantuan Succession broke out, and in 1630 an Imperial army of 36,000 Landsknecht mercenaries besieged Mantua, bringing the plague with them. Mantua never recovered from this disaster. Duke Ferdinand Charles, an inept ruler whose only aim was to hold parties and theatrical representations, allied with France in the War of the Spanish Succession. After the latter's defeat, he was declared deposed by Emperor Joseph I and took refuge in Venice, carrying with him a thousand pictures. At his death, in 1708 his family lost Mantua forever in favour of the Habsburgs of Austria. Montferrat's territories were ceded to the Duke of Savoy, and the emperor compensated the Duke of Lorraine, heir in female line of the Gonzaga, for the loss of Montferrat by ceding him the Duchy of Teschen. The Gonzagas of the Duchy of Guastalla were passed over entirely despite having the strongest claim, themselves dying out in 1746, marking the end of the Gonzaga family. Mantua was briefly united with the Duchy of Milan by an edict of Emperor Joseph II on 26 September 1786 but later restored in its separated administration by Emperor Leopold II on 24 January 1791. Mantua was besieged by Napoleon's French army in 1796, before falling in 1797. With the Treaty of Campo Formio, Mantua was annexed to the Cisalpine Republic becoming the Department of Mincio.

Popular music journalism was uncommon in the country until about 1985 when the Karachi based tabloid The Star started printing reviews written by Farrukh Moriani who is also considered to be the country's first ever pop music critic. At the end of the 1980s and with the coming of the Liberal government of Benazir Bhutto in 1988, the once repressed and frowned upon (by the Islamist dictatorship of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq), Pakistani pop music emerged from the underground and started gaining mainstream popularity. With this came another pioneering Pakistani music and fashion critic Fifi Haroon who was amongst the first in the country to undertake full features on the growing local music scene. Another frontrunner in this regard was M. Ali Tim. The arrival of Nadeem F. Paracha in 1990 also helped boost music journalism in Pakistan. With Paracha was Farjad Nabi (at The News International) and Aysha Aslam (at the Herald). Instep, the entertainment section of The News, also began to do regular features on the Pakistani music industry and has extensively covered Pakistani releases and artists ever since, with journalists like Maheen Sabeeh and Sameen Amer writing about the music scene. Dawn newspaper's section Images also carries features on the music industry. The Express Tribune features writers such as Rafay Mehmood and Sher Khan writing about the industry. Nayha Jehangir Khan has written on the scene for Youlin Magazine. Ally Adnan is another name who contributes to many publications particularly Daily Times.

In recent times, it is increasingly often placed in the genus Turdus again,ffrench et al. (1991), Clement & Hathaway (2000), Hilty (2003), BLI (2009) however some taxonomists place this species in the genus Platycichla based on morphology. The South American Classification Committee of the American Ornithologists' Union places it in the genus Turdus, as does the International Ornithological Committee. Description This thrush is long and weighs . Both sexes have yellow legs and eye-ring. The male has a yellow bill and its plumage is usually black with a slate-grey back and lower underparts. However, the hue of the grey areas varies, and the male of one of the five subspecies, P. f. xanthoscelus of Tobago, is all-black, resembling the male Eurasian blackbird (Turdus merula). Females have a dull bill, warm brown upperparts and paler underparts. The juvenile male is brownish with black wings and tail, while the juvenile female resemble the adult female, but is duller, flecked with orange above and spotted and barred with dark brown below.ffrench et al. (1991), Clement & Hathaway (2000), Hilty (2003) The song of the male is musical phrases, sreep, sreee, sree, sreee, again somewhat resembling that of the Eurasian blackbird, but sometimes including some imitation of other birds songs. The typical call is a sharp srip and a peculiar seeet given in alarm. Distribution and ecology It has a highly disjunct distribution. One population breeds in northern Colombia, Venezuela, far northern Brazil, Trinidad, and Tobago, as well as parts of the Pakaraima Mountains in western Guyana (including as it seems Mount Roraima). A second population occurs in eastern Brazil, eastern Paraguay, and far northeastern Argentina. The Argentine subpopulation is partially migratory, being resident in the northern part, while southernmost breeders spend the Austral winter further north. Some populations in northern South America also take part in local movements, but these are not well understood.ffrench et al. (1991), Clement & Hathaway (2000), Hilty (2003), O'Shea et al. (2007) The habitat of this small thrush is rainforest, secondary woodland, and overgrown plantations. It is mainly a species of highlands up to ASL, but locally it occurs down to near sea level. The yellow-legged thrush mainly feeds in trees and bushes, infrequently on the ground, and mostly eats fruits and berries, e.g., Melastomataceae. It rarely if ever attends mixed-species feeding flocks, as its habit of keeping to the tree-tops makes it rarely worthwhile to join such conspicuous groups.Machado (1999), Clement & Hathaway (2000), Hilty (2003), Strewe & Navarro (2004), O'Shea et al. (2007) The nest is a lined shallow cup of twigs on a bank or amongst rocks. Two or three reddish-blotched green or blue eggs are laid.Clement & Hathaway (2000) It is fairly common in most of its range, and therefore listed as Least Concern by the IUCN. However, the yellow-legged thrush is a shy species, and the female in particular is difficult to see, since she does not sing and has a cryptic coloration.Clement & Hathaway (2000), BLI (2008) Footnotes References * Clement, Peter & Hathaway, Ren (2000): Thrushes.

A very small portion of Woodbine Avenue between North 63rd Street and the SEPTA regional rail tracks bounds Overbrook to the north while a very small portion of North 52nd Street between Lansdowne Avenue and the SEPTA regional rail tracks bounds Overbrook to the south. According to the Commission, the northern boundary of Overbrook Farms is City Avenue (US 1). The western boundary is North 66th Street between City Avenue and Woodcrest Avenue and Morris Park between Woodcrest Avenue and Malvern Avenue. The southern border is Malvern Avenue to Wynnewood Road, a small portion of Wynnewood Road, and Woodbine Avenue from Wynnewood Road to North 58th Street. The eastern boundary is North 58th Street between Woodbine Avenue and Overbrook Avenue, a small portion of Overbrook Avenue, and then Cardinal Avenue between Overbrook Avenue and City Avenue. Overbrook Farms borders Saint Joseph's University on its northeast corner. Although the Philadelphia City Planning Commission considers Malvern Avenue to form part of the southern border, the Overbrook Farms Club says, \\"At present, there are 413 buildings in Overbrook Farms, which is bounded by 58th and 66th Streets and Woodbine and City Avenues, and bisected by Lancaster Avenue\\". West of the Overbrook neighborhood is Morris Park, which derives its name from the eponymous park on the neighborhood‚Äôs western edge. The eastern boundary of the neighborhood is North 63rd Street. On the north, the boundary is Woodbine Avenue between North 63rd Street and Wynnewood Road, Wynnewood Road between Woodbine Avenue and Malvern Avenue, and Malvern Avenue between Wynnewood Road and North 68th Street. On the west, the boundary is North 68th Street and Morris Park between Malvern Avenue and Haverford Avenue, Cobbs Creek Park between Haverford Avenue and North 67th Street, and North 67th Street between Callowhill Street and North Gross Street. The southern border is Arch Street at North Gross Street, bordering Cobbs Creek Park at Upper Darby's border. Overbrook Park's boundaries are City Avenue to the north and Morris Park on the west, south, and east. Haverford Avenue connects Overbrook Park to the Morris Park neighborhood while City Avenue connects Overbrook Park to Overbrook Farms. Greater Overbrook is in the Fourth Councilmanic District of Philadelphia, represented by Councilman Curtis Jones, Jr., elected on October 10, 2006 to a first term. The 19th Police District of the Philadelphia Police Department protects Overbrook. Overbrook developed in various stages between 1900 and 1960. The dominant housing type is the row house, present in a wide variety of styles. Built in the early 20th century when trolley lines were allowing middle-class Philadelphians to move out from more crowded row house communities, Overbrook was a community of choice when it was built. Outside of Overbrook Farms, most of the houses in the Overbrook area date from between 1915 and 1930, when the Great Depression halted new construction nationally and locally. In addition to rowhouses, one can find a sizeable number of twin (semi-detached) houses. These semi-detached homes have two or three floors and typically are over in size. Prime examples of typical Overbrook twin houses are along Wynnewood Road from Haverford Avenue to Malvern Avenue, North 64th Street between Lansdowne and Lebanon Avenues, or Nassau Road between North 61st and 63rd Streets. There are very few detached single-family homes in Overbrook. Single homes typically pre-date the construction of most of Overbrook‚Äôs housing or came into existence on select lots after the construction of most of the rowhouses and twin houses. For example, one will see a few single-family homes on Wynnewood Road near Columbia Avenue. A large stone home remains this intersection. This home once sat on acres of land that the owner(s) sold off to developers who then constructed twin houses and rowhouses. The vast majority of the single-family, detached homes in the Overbrook area are in the Overbrook Farms neighborhood.

The church was constructed between 1747 and 1754, to a design by the Italian architect Bartolomeo Rastrelli. It is sometimes referred to as a cathedral. The church is part of the National Sanctuary \\"Sophia of Kyiv\\" as a landmark of cultural heritage. The church has no bells, as according to legend, their noise would cause flooding of the left part of the city. St Andrew's Church overlooks the historic Podil neighborhood, situated on a steep hill to which the church gave its current name‚ÄîAndriyivska Hill. It is currently one of four architectural landmarks of Ukraine, which were put down on the List of Mankind Treasures of Five Continents by the world society. As the church sits atop a hill, foundation problems have been one of the main concerns of preservationists. More recently, the foundation below the church has started to shift, causing some concerns that the church's foundation might collapse. Cracks have already appeared in the foundation, and some of the church's falling decor has been found in neighboring areas. Location Saint Andrew's prophecy of Kyiv depicted in the Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç Chronicle. A Church stands on the legendary location where St. Andrew erected his cross on Dnieper River's banks. The church was built in honor of Saint Andrew who is recognized as the \\"Apostle Rus\\".Saint Andrew Article about Saint Andrew in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine According to the chronicle The Tale of Bygone Years, Saint Andrew came to the Dnipro River's slopes in the 1st century AD and erected a cross on the current location of the church. He prophesied that the sparsely inhabited area would become a great city. As he predicted, the site arose to become the city of Kyiv, a center of the Eastern Orthodox faith. In 1086, the Grand Prince of Kiev Vsevolod I constructed a small church, dedicated to the erection of the cross by Saint Andrew. In 1215, Prince Mstyslav of Halych built the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross nearby. However, the church did not survive after the Mongol invasion of Kyivan Rus' in 1240. From that point after, wooden churches were constructed in the place where the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross had been located, although, were too destroyed and again replaced with another one. In 1690, a wooden church consecrated to Saint Andrew was moved from the Brethren's cloister in the Podil to the Andriyivsky Mount. It too did not last long, only until 1726, when it was pulled down. History =Construction= The church's pulpit, a construction rarely witnessed in Eastern Orthodox church architecture. The current structure of the church began when Russian Empress Elizabeth decided to construct a summer residence for herself in Kyiv, consisting of a palace and a church. The palace was to be located in the Pechersk neighborhood while the church was to be on the Andriyivska Hill. The commencement of construction took place during an official ceremony on September 9, 1744 which consisted of the Empress laying the first three founding stones herself. The Petersburg Building Chancellery first hired German architect Gottfried Johann Sch√§del and engineer Daniel de Bosquet to draft out the plans for the church. However, when Sch√§del presented his project in 1745, the Chancellery rejected it. He was replaced by head architect of the imperial court, Bartolomeo Rastrelli, who worked out a plan which was closely based on a church of a Saint Petersburg institute. The construction itself was conducted by a team of Ukrainian, Russian, and foreign masters under the direction of architect Ivan Michurin, who was previously successful in replacing the older Church of the Resurrection, on the Women's Market Square (Babiy torzhok) in Moscow. Michurin was responsible for carrying out all of the engineering and geological researches of the site and found out that a hard subsoil ground lies at a depth of 13‚Äì14 meters and above ‚Äî made grounds penetrated by subterranean waters. With this information, Michurin developed the construction of a stone foundation and connected it with the two-storied building of the Priest's apartments, planned by Rastrelli. I. Vlasiev and the Kyiv Governor-General M. Leontev were placed in charge of hiring masons, carpenters, and carvers from territories now located in Belarus, Lithuania, and Ukraine. White and red bricks for the church were made at the brick fields of the Sophia, Pechersk, and Cyril cloisters. The foundation stone was delivered by the Kyiv garrison soldiers from the neighboring towns of Rzhyshchiv and Bucha. The wood came from the nearby Pushcha-Vodytsia forests. Also, infantry regiments from Kyiv, Chernihiv, Starodub, and Poltava were involved in the church's construction. Apart from workers from the neighboring villages, the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra sent 50 of its best masons to work on the church. Both the external and internal decoration on the church was carried out at the same time. Cast iron floor slabs were delivered from Moscow. Also, forms were made for the church's windows, doors, walls, and for space under the cupola. The planned iconostasis, designed by Rastrelli, was also added. The wood for the iconostasis, altar canopy, pulpit, and tsar's place were carved in Saint Petersburg in order to conserve time. The iconostasis' icons were carried out by Petersburg artists. For gilding, 1,028 slabs of gold were used in the interior. The cast iron steps leading up to the church from the Andriyivskyy Descent. Although the exterior work was finished in 1754, interior work and decorations were not finished up until 1767. Alexei Antropov and Ivan Vishnyakov painted the church's icons, and the frescoes were done by Ukrainian masters I. Romenskyi and I. Chaikovskyi. A planned ramp that was to be installed to provide access to the church, was later changed to a wooden staircase due to the steepness of the hill. The wooden ramp was later (in 1844) changed to a cast iron one. =Restoration= As the Empress planned to take personal care of the church, the church has no parish, and there is no bell tower to call the congregation to divine service. But she died before the construction ended, so the church was never cared for by Elizabeth. After her death, the imperial court took no interest in the church, and the church was left without any funding. For some time, the church existed off of private and voluntary funds, from people such as Andrey Muravyov. The baroque three-tier iconostasis designed by Rastrelli. The woodwork was done by carvers Joseph Domash, Andrey Karlovsky and Matvey Manturov. Later on, the church was handed down to the Kyiv Council in 1768. The Kyiv City Council took control over the church, and later reorganized into the Kyiv Council in 1785. In 1815, a strong storm tore off the church's cupolas. After the storm, the church was in need of a full restoration. In the next year, architect Andrey Melensky made a plan of the building's fa√ßade and sent them for consideration to Saint Petersburg. In 1825‚Äì1828, the church was restored, based on Melensky's plans. The red mission tiles was replaced by metal, resulting in the fact that the cupolas lost some decor and changed their form. =Present use= From 1917 to 1953, many restorations were conducted on the foundations of the church. In addition, the restoration of the church's fa√ßade, interior, and decor was also conducted. From the time of the church's opening until 1932, when the Soviet Council ordered that the church be closed down, regular services were held. In 1935, the St. Andrew's Church was included into the Historical and Cultural Conservation \\"All-Ukraine Museum Area.\\" For some time after 1939, Saint Sophia Anti-religious Museum was located within the premises of the church. During World War II, regular church services were restored, only to be closed down again in 1961. From time to time, the church's stylobate was rented to different organizations up until 1992, when the stylobate was taken up by the Kyiv Ecclesiastical Seminary of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Kyivan Patriarchate. On January 10, 1968, the church was included into the State Architectural and Historical Conservation area \\"Saint Sophia Museum.\\" On September 10 of the same year, the church was opened as a historical and architectural museum. During the early 1960s, original plans of Rastrelli's baroque cupolas were uncovered in Vienna, Austria. In 1970, the St. Sophia Museum requested photocopies of the originals from the Albertina Museum located in Vienna. In 1978, restorers headed by architect V. Korneyeva restored the church's domes based on drawings by Bartolomeo Rastrelli. Since 1987, the church is included into the National Conservation area \\"Saint Sophia of Kyiv.\\" Nowadays it is Cathedral of the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. On the 255th anniversary of the construction, the Ukrainian Presidential Administration transferred the ownership of the building from the government to the Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church. In October 2018, the church was transferred to the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople as a stauropegion. Architecture and preservation View of the central dome with the iconostasis. The church was constructed on a 15-meter foundation-stylobate, which from the eastern side faces downhill and from the western‚Äîhas a two-story construction. The church consists of a single dome and five small decorative spires. From the outside fa√ßade, Corinthian columns decorate the church, accompanied by additional decorations. The windows and doors of the church are decorated with ornamental details. As the church sits atop a hill, foundation problems have been one of the main concerns of preservationists. More recently, the foundation below the church has started to shift, causing some concerns that the church's foundation might collapse. Cracks have already appeared in the church's foundation, resulting with the fact that a special committee was set up by the Minister of Emergency Situations Nestor Shufrich. According to the Ministry of Emergency Situations, they will conduct research on the building's foundation and its construction with the help of Ministry of Construction, Kyiv City Administration, and the division of the Ministry of Emergency Situations in Kyiv City.

A soldering gun is an approximately pistol-shaped, electrically powered tool for soldering metals using tin-based solder to achieve a strong mechanical bond with good electrical contact. The tool has a trigger-style switch so it can be easily operated with one hand. The body of the tool contains a transformer with a primary winding connected to mains electricity when the trigger is pressed, and a single-turn secondary winding of thick copper with very low resistance. A soldering tip, made of a loop of thinner copper wire, is secured to the end of the transformer secondary by screws, completing the secondary circuit. When the primary of the transformer is energized, several hundred amperes of current flow through the secondary and very rapidly heat the copper tip. Since the tip has a much higher resistance than the rest of the tubular copper winding, the tip gets very hot while the remainder of the secondary warms at a much slower rate. An additional secondary winding is often used to power a pilot lamp which illuminates the workpiece. The soldering gun is useful when soldered joints must be made intermittently. A constant-heat device has to be set in a safe place when powered but not actually in use, to prevent damage or injury. The fast-switching gun cools quickly enough to be set down a few seconds after use. Applications Soldering guns are used where more heat is needed than from the lower-power soldering irons. They can be used for heavy electrical connections, stained glass assembly, and light sheet-metal work. Typical soldering guns are rated at 100 to 240 watts power. A gun may include a two-stage trigger to give two heat settings. Tips designed for cutting and shaping plastic are available; soldering guns for general home use may be supplied with a kit of different tips. The temperature of the soldering tip is regulated manually by holding the button until the solder melts, and then releasing it. When the solder is about to start solidifying, the button is pressed again, and so on. An experienced worker develops the skill to regulate the temperature according to need. Because the temperature of the tip is not automatically regulated, use of a soldering gun for joints on printed circuit boards can result in too much heat supplied to the joint, damaging the circuit board. The copper tip slowly dissolves in the solder and eventually has to be replaced. The soldering gun generates an electromagnetic spike when the button is released, which can be a problem for electromagnetically-sensitive devices. The spike can be seen when a high-efficiency LED is soldered, as the LED flashes. The heavy magnetic field produced by the tip can attract and hold small ferrous metal pieces (screws, etc.).  History  A 1948 advertisement for a Weller soldering gun Pistol-grip electrically-heated soldering tools had been used since the 1920s. In 1941 Carl E. Weller invented and later obtained Weller, Carl E., \\"Electrical Heating Apparatus\\" US 2405866, filed July 14, 1941, issued August 1946. for a transformer-based soldering tool which heated and cooled rapidly, essentially as described in this article. Weller formed a company to manufacture and sell his invention commercially in 1946. The Weller company was bought in 1970 and merged into the Cooper Industries group, http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Cooper-Cameron-Corporation- Company-History.html retrieved 2009 Oct 19 retaining the Weller brand for soldering equipment.

One-room schools were commonplace throughout rural portions of various countries, including Prussia, Norway, Sweden, the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Spain. In most rural and small town schools, all of the students met in a single room. There, a single teacher taught academic basics to several grade levels of elementary-age children. While in many areas one-room schools are no longer used, it is not uncommon for them to remain in developing nations and rural or remote areas. Examples include remote parts of the American West, the Falklands, and the Shetland Islands. Prussia The one-room school in Reckahn, Brandenburg an der Havel, was founded 1773 and quotes Mark 10:14 at the entrance. It is now used as a local history museum. Prussia was among the first countries in the world to introduce a tax-funded and generally compulsory primary education for either boys and girls.James van Horn Melton, Absolutism and the Eighteenth-Century Origins of Compulsory Schooling in Prussia and Austria (2003) In comparison, compulsory schooling in France or Great Britain was not successfully enacted until the 1880s.Construction of the First Mass Education Systems in Nineteenth-Century Europe Yasemin Nuhoglu Soysal and David Strang, Sociology of Education, Vol. 62, No. 4 (Oct., 1989), pp. 277-288 Published by: American Sociological Association The state-sponsored system was introduced in the late 18th century and has had a widespread influence ever since. The first Prussian schools were simple one-room schools, but by 1773 Friedrich Eberhard von Rochow had already set up a model school with primary education in two separate age-grouped classes. Ireland In Ireland, free primary education was mandated in 1831, prompting the establishment of many single-teacher National Schools across rural areas, most initially using a room in an existing building. By the 1890s there was a school in every parish. Most extant one- and two-room school buildings date from the decades after 1891 when primary education became compulsory. Most of those still in use today have been extended following merger with neighbouring schools. Since 2002, any state-funded school with at least 10 pupils is entitled to at least 2 teachers; the 21 schools which fell below this threshold are located on offshore islands. In recent decades, an increasing number of schools have been founded for parents not content with the National School system. These include Gaelscoileanna (which teach through Irish rather than English) and multi- denominational schools (most Irish schools are controlled by one or other of the main Christian churches). Although such schools eventually become eligible for state funding, they usually begin with a single teacher in a room or prefabricated building. United States A preserved one-room school located in Wells, Maine. Ichabod Crane Schoolhouse. Owned by Columbia County Historical Society, New York is open to the public and operates as a museum. Many schools also served as the local chapel on Sundays, and evening/Saturday meeting places for local people and activities. Being mostly rural, many schools had no plumbing or sanitation. Teaching standards often varied from school to school as the teacher was compelled to coach children of all ages/grades within one room and regardless of their area of main competence. The quality of facilities at one-room schools varied with local economic conditions, but generally, the number of children at each grade level would vary with local populations. Most buildings were of simple frame construction, some with the school bell on a cupola. In the Midwest, sod construction was also used, as well as stone and adobe in areas like the Southwest where trees were scarce. In some locations, the schoolhouse was painted red, but most seem to have been white. A historic one-room school in Waverly, Pennsylvania. Mission Ridge School was one of the early schools in Mason County, West Virginia. It has since been moved to the West Virginia State Farm Museum complex near Point Pleasant. Examination of the materials in this building indicates that boards and timbers were hand-sawed and also hand-planed. Square nails were used throughout the building. Except for the roof and a few boards in the floor, all of the material in this building is original. The blackboard is painted black. It was not until much later that slate was used for chalkboards, although students often had individual slates for writing practice. Teachers in one-room schools were often former students themselves. Their role is well-described by a student from Kentucky in the 1940s: > The teachers that taught in the one room, rural schools were very special > people. During the winter months they would get to the school early to get a > fire started in the potbelly stove, so the building would be warm for the > students. On many occasions they would prepare a hot, noon meal on top of > the stove, usually consisting of soup or stew of some kind. They took care > of their students like a new mother hen would care for her newly hatched > chicks; always looking out for their health and welfare. A typical school day was 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., with morning and afternoon recesses of 15 minutes each and an hour period for lunch. \\"The older students were given the responsibility of bringing in water, carrying in coal or wood for the stove. The younger students would be given responsibilities according to their size and gender such as cleaning the black board (chalkboard), taking the erasers outside for dusting plus other duties that they were capable of doing.\\" Transportation for children who lived too far to walk was often provided by horse-drawn kid hack or sulky, which could only travel a limited distance in a reasonable amount of time each morning and evening, or students might ride a horse, these being put out to pasture in an adjoining paddock during the day. In more recent times, students rode bicycles. The school house was the center and focus for thousands of rural communities, hamlets, and small towns. Often, town meetings and picnics were also held there. The vast majority of one-room schools in the United States are no longer used as schools and have either been torn down or converted for other purposes. However, in some rural communities, including among the Amish, one-room or two-room schools are still used, primarily for elementary education, with students graduating to local or regional middle and high schools. =Octagonal schoolhouses= There are several historic one-room schoolhouses in the United States that were built in the shape of an octagon, instead of the more traditional rectangular style. Most are located in the northeastern part of the country and some have been restored and placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The following octagonal schoolhouses still stand: * Sheldon Jackson School; Sitka, Alaska * Octagonal Schoolhouse; Cowgill's Corner, Delaware * Birmingham School; Chester County, Pennsylvania * Charter Oak Schoolhouse; Schuline, Illinois * Watkins Mill Schoolhouse; Lawson, Missouri * Modern Times School; Brentwood, New York * Council Rocks School; Bucks County, New York * Eight Square Schoolhouse; Dryden, New York * Octagonal Schoolhouse; Essex, New York * Octagon Stone Schoolhouse; Canaan, Pennsylvania * Sodom Schoolhouse; Montandon, Pennsylvania * Hood Octagonal School; Newtown Township, Pennsylvania * Diamond Rock School; Valley Forge, Pennsylvania * Wrightstown Octagonal Schoolhouse; Wrightstown, Pennsylvania =Teacher's residence= The one-room adobe schoolhouse in Tubac, Arizona, with a teacherage attached to the back. The teacher's residence, or teacherage, was often attached to the school, or very close by, so that a male teacher's wife and family were an integral part of the management and support system for the school. Single, female teachers were more often billeted or boarded with a local family to provide for social norms requiring social supervision of single females. =Consolidation= Motorized school buses in the 1920s made longer distances possible, and one-room schools were soon consolidated in most portions of the United States into multiple classroom schools where classes could be held separately for various grade levels. Gradually, one-room school houses were replaced. Most one-room schools had been replaced by larger schools by World War II except in the most rural areas. However, they are still common in rural parts of Australia and Alaska. =Preservation: buildings and cultural= Some of the historical one-room schools that survive today remain unrestored and in disrepair. The one pictured is located on private land in Price County, Wisconsin, and remains unrestored, despite community interest in preserving it. In Calvert County, Maryland, Port Republic School Number 7 closed its doors in 1932 and sat unused for over 40 years. Then, in 1976 the Calvert Retired Teachers Association, looking for a Bicentennial Year project, decided to restore the one-room schoolhouse. On July 24, 1977, after months of hard work by teachers and community volunteers, the old school bell rang out once more, and the little one-room school house, filled with its memories and memorabilia, was ready for visitors. It is now one of the county's tourist attractions. A similar project was done in Queen Anne's County, Maryland, by retired Teachers and Community Volunteers. The restored schoolhouse is located in front of Queen Anne's County High School. In Iowa, over 125 small one-room school houses have been turned into local museums. The buildings in some places found new purpose as homes. In Harrisburg, Nebraska, Flowerfield School serves as a living museum, and fourth-graders within the Nebraska panhandle spend a day at Flowerfield going through an average school day in 1888. The students have the opportunity to experience both log and sod versions of the house, writing with quill pens, and a trip to the nearby museum, where they learn about other aspects of life in 1888. In Vandalia, Indiana, the Vandalia District # 2 one-room schoolhouse served Owen County‚Äôs Lafayette Township students in grades 1 ‚Äì 8 from the time it was completed in 1868 until it closed in 1951. The building, restored by a group of volunteers in 1976, is presently maintained and preserved by the Vandalia Community Preservation Association. The One Room School House Project of Southwestern College in Winfield, Kansas, includes listings and information on some 880 schools throughout the state and nation. The information, pictures, and stories included in this site have been collected and sent to the project by researchers and historians from across America. = Active one- room schools = As of 2017, almost 400 one-rooms schools still operate in the United States, including schoolhouses in: * Death Valley, CA * Jamestown, CA * Bellvue, CO * Duette, FL * Lowman, ID * Cliff Island, ME * Isle au Haut, ME * Matinicus, ME * Monhegan, ME * Franklin, MA * Gosnold, MA * South Egremont, MA * Copper Harbor, MI * Bad Axe, MI * Grand Ledge, MI * Kalkaska, MI * Angle Inlet, MN * Warroad, MN * Gold Creek, MT * Goodsprings, NV * Nye County, NV * Croydon, NH * Landaff, NH * Sagaponack, NY * Troy, NY * Corolla, NC * Baldwin, ND * Fort Pierre, SD * Alta, UT * Elmore, VT * Holden Village, WA * Marco Island, FLhttp://www.floridaschoolchoice.org/Information/PrivateSchoolDirectory/Default.aspx * Prudence Island, RI * Vilonia, Arkansas Gallery File:Lincoln's 1822 school.jpgThe one-room blab school attended by Abraham Lincoln in 1822.

Hale believes he is Cupid, sent down from Mount Olympus by Zeus to connect 100 couples without using his powers, as a punishment for his arrogance. Originally broadcast on ABC on Saturday evenings at 10 p.m. EST, the show lasted one season. Plot Trevor Hale is attractive, witty, uncommonly intelligent‚Äîand he may be Cupid, the Greco-Roman god of erotic love. Probably not, but he thinks so. Trevor's insistence that he is Cupid lands him in a mental hospital, where he meets psychologist Claire Allen, a renowned authority on romance. Trevor tells Claire that he has been stripped of his godly powers by Zeus, and exiled from Mount Olympus as a punishment for arrogance. To win his way back among the gods, Trevor must unite 100 couples in everlasting love, without his bow and arrows. Claire does not believe in Cupid, but she risks her career by releasing Trevor from the hospital, assuming responsibility for his behavior. Trevor finds work as a bartender, and regularly disrupts Claire's group therapy sessions. All the while, he plots his campaign to promote romance, and earn his way back to Olympus. While encouraging sexual abandon in others, Trevor remains chaste; he believes sex with a mortal will confine him to Earth forever.

The patio process is a process for extracting silver from ore. The process was invented by Bartolom√© de Medina in Pachuca, Mexico, in 1554.Alan Probert, \\"Bartolom√© de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis\\" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, p. 96. The patio process was the first process to use mercury amalgamation to recover silver from ore. It replaced smelting as the primary method of extracting silver from ore at Spanish colonies in the Americas. Other amalgamation processes were later developed, importantly the pan amalgamation process, and its variant, the Washoe process. The silver separation process generally differed from gold parting and gold extraction, although amalgamation with mercury is also sometimes used to extract gold. Development of the patio process Bartolom√© de Medina was a successful Spanish merchant who became fascinated with the problem of decreasing silver yields from ores mined in Spanish America. By the mid- sixteenth century, it was well known in Spain that American silver production was in decline due to the depletion of high-grade ores and increasing production costs. The New Laws, prohibiting the enslavement of Indians, had resulted in higher labor costs as miners turned to wage labor and expensive African slaves. These higher production costs made mining and smelting anything but the highest grade silver ores prohibitively expensive, just as the availability of high grade ores was in decline.Alan Probert, \\"Bartolom√© de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis\\" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, p.102. Bartolom√© de Medina initially focused his attentions on learning about new smelting methods from smelters in Spain. He was approached during his research by an unknown German man, known only as \\"Maestro Lorenzo,\\" who told him that silver could be extracted from ground ores using mercury and a salt-water brine.Alan Probert, \\"Bartolom√© de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis\\" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, p.107. With this knowledge, Medina left Spain for New Spain (Mexico) in 1554 and established a model patio refinery in order to prove the effectiveness of the new technology. Medina is generally credited with adding \\"magistral\\" (a copper sulfate) to the mercury and salt-water solution in order to catalyze the amalgamation reaction.Alan Probert, \\"Bartolom√© de Medina: The Patio Process and the Sixteenth Century Silver Crisis\\" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, p.109-111. However, some historians assert that there were already sufficient copper sulfates in the local ores and that no additional magistral was needed.D.A. Brading and Harry E. Cross, \\"Colonial Silver Mining: Mexico and Peru\\", The Hispanic American Historical Review, Vol. 52, No. 4 (November 1972), pp. 545-579. Regardless of whether or not Medina's contribution was entirely original, he promoted his process to local miners and was able to obtain a patent from the Viceroy of New Spain. As a result, he is generally credited with the invention of silver amalgamation in the form of the patio process.Probert, 110-112. Basic elements of the patio process Patio Process at the Gould & Curry Mill, Comstock Lode, USA, 1866 Silver ores were crushed (typically either in \\"arrastras\\" or stamp mills) to a fine slime which was mixed with salt, water, magistral (essentially an impure form of copper sulfate), and mercury, and spread in a 1-to-2-foot-thick (0.30 to 0.61 m) layer in a patio (a shallow-walled, open enclosure). Horses were driven around on the patio to further mix the ingredients. After weeks of mixing and soaking in the sun, a complex reaction converted the silver to native metal, which formed an amalgam with the mercury. Heating this amalgam drove off the mercury, leaving the silver. W.H. Dennis (1963) 100 Years of Metallurgy, Chicago: Aldine The amount of salt and copper sulfate varied from one-quarter to ten pounds of one or the other, or both, per ton of ore treated. The decision of how much of each ingredient to add, how much mixing was needed, and when to halt the process depended on the skill of an azoguero (English: quicksilver man). The loss of mercury in amalgamation processes is generally one to two times the weight of silver recovered.Egleston, Thomas (1883). \\"The Patio and Cazo Process of Amalgamating Silver Ores.\\". Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences 3 (1): 1‚Äì66. The patio process was the first form of amalgamation. However, it is unclear whether this process or a similar process‚Äîin which amalgamation occurred in heated vats rather than open patios‚Äîwas the predominant form of amalgamation in New Spain, as the earliest known illustration of the patio process dates from 1761. There is substantial evidence that both processes were used from an early date in New Spain, while open patios were never adopted in Peru.Brading and Cross, 553-554. Both processes required that ore be crushed and refiners quickly established mills to process ore once amalgamation was introduced. By the seventeenth century, water-powered mills became dominant in both New Spain and Peru.Probert, 112; Peter Bakewell, \\"Technological Change in Potos√≠: The Silver Boom of the 1570s,\\" in Bakewell, Peter, ed. Mines of Silver and Gold in the Americas. Variorum: Brookfield, 1997, pp. 91-92. Due to amalgamation's reliance upon mercury, an expansion of mercury production was central to the expansion of silver production. From shortly after the invention of mercury amalgamation to the end of the colonial period, the Spanish crown maintained a monopoly on mercury production and distribution, ensuring a steady supply of royal income. Fluctuations in mercury prices generally resulted in corresponding increases and decreases in silver production.Brading and Cross, 562. Broader historical significance The introduction of amalgamation to silver refining in the Americas not only ended the mid-sixteenth century crisis in silver production, it also inaugurated a rapid expansion of silver production in New Spain and Peru as miners could now profitably mine lower-grade ores. As a result of this expansion, the Americas became the primary producer of the world's silver, with Spanish America producing three-fifths of the world's silver supply prior to 1900.Probert, 97. While a number of factors resulted in the minimal use of forced Indian labor in Mexican silver production,Brading and Cross, 557. the introduction of silver amalgamation allowed for an expansion of silver production in Peru that had profound consequences for Peru's native population. Francisco Toledo, the Viceroy of Peru in the 1570s, saw amalgamation as the key to expanding Peruvian silver production. He encouraged miners to adopt amalgamation and construct mercury mines. More significantly, in order to provide sufficient labor to accommodate the expansion of silver mining to lower-grade ores, Toledo organized an Indian draft labor system, the mita.Bakewell, 76, 81. Under this system, thousands of natives were forced to work in silver and mercury mines for less than subsistence-level wages. Twelve thousand draft laborers regularly worked at the largest mine in the Americas, located at Potos√≠ in modern Bolivia. Native attempts to avoid the mita led to the abandonment of many Indian villages throughout Peru.Brading and Cross, 559. Spanish monopolization of refining through amalgamation cut natives out of what had earlier been a native- dominated enterprise. Refining represented the most profitable segment of silver production. In conjunction with the mita, the exclusion of natives from owning refineries contributed to the transformation of Peruvian natives into a poorly paid labor force.Bakewell, 95. The rapid expansion of silver production and coinage‚Äîmade possible due to the invention of amalgamation‚Äîhas often been identified as the primary driver of the price revolution, a period of high inflation lasting from the sixteenth to early seventeenth-century in Europe. Proponents of this theory argue that Spain's reliance on silver coins from the Americas to finance its large balance of payments deficits resulted in a general expansion of the European money supply and corresponding inflation. Critics of the theory, however, argue that inflation was really a result of European government policies and population growth.Douglas Fisher, \\"The Price Revolution: A Monetary Interpretation,\\" The Journal of Economic History, Vol. 49, No. 4 (Dec. 1989), 883-884. While the role of the expansion in silver production in the price revolution may be disputed, this expansion is often acknowledged as a key ingredient in the formation of early-modern world trade. Spanish American production fed Chinese demand for silver, facilitating the development of extensive trade networks linking Europe, Africa, Asia, and the Americas as Europeans sought to gain access to Chinese wares.Dennis Flynn and Arturo Gir√°ldez, \\"Born with a 'Silver Spoon': The Origin of World Trade in 1571,\\" Journal of World History, Vol. 6, No. 2 (Fall, 1995), 202-203.

Glottalization of vowels and other sonorants is most often realized as creaky voice (partial closure). Glottalization of obstruent consonants usually involves complete closure of the glottis; another way to describe this phenomenon is to say that a glottal stop is made simultaneously with another consonant. In certain cases, the glottal stop can even wholly replace the voiceless consonant. The term 'glottalized' is also used for ejective and implosive consonants; see glottalic consonant for examples. There are two other ways to represent glottalization of sonorants in the IPA: (a) the same way as ejectives, with an apostrophe; or (b) with the under-tilde for creaky voice. For example, the Yapese word for \\"sick\\" with a glottalized m could be transcribed as either or . (In some typefaces, the apostrophe will occur above the m.) Types Glottalization varies along three parameters, all of which are continuums. The degree of glottalization varies from none (modal voice, ) through stiff voice () and creaky voice () to full glottal closure (glottal reinforcement or glottal replacement, described below). The timing also varies, from a simultaneous single segment to an onset or coda such as or to a sequence such as or . Full or partial closure of the glottis also allows glottalic airstream mechanisms to operate, producing ejective or implosive consonants; implosives may themselves have modal, stiff, or creaky voice. It is not always clear from linguistic descriptions if a language has a series of light ejectives or voiceless consonants with glottal reinforcement,See Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996:74) for the case of Siona or similarly if it has a series of light implosives or voiced consonants with glottal reinforcement. The airstream parameter is only known to be relevant to obstruents, but the first two are involved with both obstruents and sonorants, including vowels. Glottal replacement When a phoneme is completely substituted by a glottal stop , one speaks of glottaling or glottal replacement. This is, for instance, very common in British English dialects such as Cockney, Estuary English, and the various Northern English dialects. In these dialects, the glottal stop is an allophone of , and word-finally, and when followed by an unstressed vowel (including syllabic and ) in a post- stress syllable. 'Water' can be pronounced ‚Äì the glottal stop has superseded the 't' sound. Other examples include \\"city\\" , \\"bottle\\" , \\"Britain\\" , \\"seniority\\" . In some consonant clusters, glottal replacement of /t/ is common even among RP speakers. Glottal replacement also occurs in Indonesian, where syllable final is produced as a glottal stop. In Hawaiian, the glottal stop is reconstructed to have come from other Proto-Polynesian consonants. The following table displays the shift ‚Üí as well as the shift ‚Üí . { class=wikitable ! Gloss ! man ! sea ! taboo ! octopus ! canoe - ! Tongan  align=center   align=center   align=center   align=center   align=center  - !

Yanesha' has three vowel qualities (, , and ) that have phonemic contrasts between short, long, and \\"laryngeal\\" or glottalized forms. While the latter generally consists of creaky phonation, there is some allophony involved. In pre-final contexts, a variation occurs (especially before voiced consonants) ranging from creaky phonation throughout the vowel to a sequence of a vowel, glottal stop, and a slightly rearticulated vowel: ('deer') ‚Üí . Glottal reinforcement When a phoneme is accompanied (either sequentially or simultaneously) by a , then one speaks of pre-glottalization or glottal reinforcement. =English= This is common in some varieties of English, RP included; and are the most affected but and also regularly show pre-glottalization. In the English dialects exhibiting pre-glottalization, the consonants in question are usually glottalized in the coda position: \\"what\\" , \\"fiction\\" , \\"milkman\\" , \\"opera\\" . To a certain extent, some varieties of English have free variation between glottal replacement and glottal reinforcement. =Other languages= Glottal reinforcement may occasionally be observed in more conservative varieties of Tweants, a dialect of the Dutch Low Saxon language group. It almost exclusively concerns the consonant, and is sometimes orthographically represented by a double -t. It mostly occurs in monosyllabic verbs, such as \\"iej loatt\\" (you let) and \\"wie weett\\" (we know). Sometimes it may also occur in contracted words, such as in the phrase: \\"Wo geet t?\\" (lit. how goes it?), which is pronounced .

He is known for writing, co-producing, and co-directing The Little Fugitive and for co-creating and co-writing with Jay Williams the Danny Dunn series of science fiction books for children. He also wrote the story \\"Little Cowboy\\" (1948). Family Raymond's parents were Harry Abrashkin, born in what is now Dnipropetrovsk, Ukraine, and Bertha Kornfeld, born in England. Raymond was born in Brooklyn, New York. He graduated from the City College of New York and taught in New York City public schools. His writing career began as the education editor of PM Newspaper. He became the principal writer for Young People's Records. He wrote the syndicated comic strip Timmy, drawn by Howard Sparber. Around 1935, he married Evelyn Kurinski. They had two children, John Michael (West) Abrashkin, an artist (1941‚Äì1992), and William Henry (Hank) Abrashkin, a Trial Court Judge in Massachusetts (b. 1944). There are two grandchildren, Karen Anna Abrashkin (b. 1981) and John Raymond Abrashkin (b. 1983). During World War II Abrashkin served in the United States Maritime Service on supply ships in the Atlantic. During and after the war, he lived in Greenwich Village, New York. In 1951 he and his family moved to a converted barn in Weston, Connecticut, where he lived for the remainder of his life. Little Fugitive In 1952 Abrashkin wrote the screenplay for Little Fugitive under the name \\"Ray Ashley\\", which he co-produced and co-directed with Morris Engel and Ruth Orkin. The movie, which came out in 1953, was nominated for an Academy Award, and won acclaim and praise from Fran√ßois Truffaut as setting the stage for the French New Wave movement. While working on the movie at Coney Island, Abrashkin was stricken with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, (ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease), from which he died, aged 49.

Early life Williams was born in Buffalo, New York, the son of Max and Lillian Jacobson. He cited the experience of growing up as the son of a vaudeville show producer as leading him to pursue his acting career as early as college. He attended both the University of Pennsylvania (1932‚Äì33) and Columbia University (1934), participating in amateur theatrical productions. Career =Early endeavors= Out of school and out of work during the end of the Great Depression, he worked as a comedian on the upstate New York Borscht Belt circuit. From 1936 until 1941, Jay Williams worked as a press agent for Dwight Deere Winman, Jed Harris and the Hollywood Theatre Alliance. Williams even played a feature role in the Cannes prize winning film, Little Fugitive, produced in 1953. Williams served in the Army during World War II, receiving a Purple Heart. While serving, he published his first book The Stolen Oracle in 1943. After his discharge from the military in 1945, he turned his attention to writing as a full-time career. =Writing= In all, Williams authored at least 79 books including 11 picture books, 39 children's novels, 7 adult mysteries, 4 nonfiction books, 8 historical novels and a play. He is probably best known for his young adult \\"Danny Dunn\\" science fiction/fantasy series which he co-authored with Raymond Abrashkin. Though Abrashkin died in 1960, Williams insisted Abrashkin should continue to receive credit as co-author of all 15 books of this series, which continued from 1956 until 1977. Williams was reported to personally reply to over 1,000 fan letters from his juvenile readers each year. Like his first novel, The Stolen Oracle, Williams wrote mysteries for young adults, including The Counterfeit African (1945) and The Roman Moon Mystery. He also wrote adult crime fiction, using the pseudonym Michael Delving. (This may be a reference to Michel Delving, a large hobbit-populated town in The Lord of the Rings.) One of his series of mysteries features the American rare book and manuscript collector, Dave Cannon, and takes place in Britain. Jay Williams also wrote a number of successful historical novels for adults, including The Witches, a look at the eradication of the healing women in Scotland; Solomon and Sheba; The Siege, a tale of the 13th-century wars initiated by the Pope against the Albigensian heresy; Tomorrow's Fire (1964), set during the Third Crusade; and The Rogue from Padua, a novel that takes place in the Renaissance. He was also interested in the future in his many speculative science fiction tales, often published in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction; eight of these stories were published under the title, Unearthly Beasts. His novel Uniad sees a world in which individuality has shrunk. His novel The Forger examines commercialism and art, and the relation of art to real life. Williams also wrote non-fiction books: The Middle Ages, Knights of the Crusades, The Spanish Armada, and Joan of Arc, as well as his young adult Landmark book on World War II, The Battle for the North Atlantic. He was known for his extensive research in both his fiction and non-fiction. He wrote about the environment in his Fall of the Sparrow, describing the loss of numerous animal and bird species, often due to man; and he wrote a travel book, A Change of Climate, a European trip with his son, Chris. Personal life Williams and his wife Barbara Girsdansky were married June 3, 1941. They had a son, Christopher (\\"Chris\\"), and a daughter, Victoria. Jay Williams died at age 64 from a heart attack while on a trip to London on July 12, 1978.

It was used as both a single-decker bus and a double-decker bus chassis largely in Continental Europe. The B7L was also available as an integrally-constructed Volvo bus - the Volvo 5000 (later renumbered 7500, with aluminium structure) and Volvo 7000 (later renumbered 7700, with stainless steel structure). Whilst similar to the B10L in design, both featuring a side-mounted engine, the B7L's engine was a Volvo D7C unit mounted vertically, as opposed to the horizontally mounted Volvo DH10/GH10 engine of the B10L; the radiator was mounted above the engine instead of the right-hand side, allowing the floor to be lower behind the rear axle. As with the B10L, B7L was also available in its articulated form named the B7LA. Unlike B10L, the B7L was available only with diesel engines. Integrally constructed Volvo 7000 bus was bodied, with CNG engines, on B10L chassis only. CNG engines were reintroduced in B9L chassis. Outside Continental Europe, the B7L was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2000, as a replacement for the Volvo B10BLE, and the Volvo Olympian. It could be fitted with Wright Eclipse body (and Eclipse Fusion body for B7LA), but proved unpopular due to the arrangement of engine and radiator limiting seating capacity, with FirstGroup being the only major customer. Volvo responded by introducing the B7RLE and the B7TL for the UK market, fitted with more conventional Transverse engines. In Ireland, Bus √âireann purchased 25 B7L's between 2001 & 2003\\\\. The double- decker version of B7L was also sold in UK, used as public bus (East Lancs Nordic body) or sightseeing bus (Ayats Bravo City open-top body). Volvo B7L and B7LA-based buses are used in Greece. In Athens, Volvo B7LAs constructed by Saracakis have been used since 1999. In Thessaloniki, the local operator OASTH introduced 22 B7LAs in 2004 with more coming in 2005 and 2006, while 54 B7Ls were introduced in 2004 and 2005 together with 15 11m B7Ls also in 2005 all constructed by ELVO. Volvo B7L used in Israel as well, but the bodyworks were Mercury by Merkavim and Hispano Habit. Mercury had Voith D864.3E transmission while Hispano had ZF Ecomat 5HP502 transmission. Metrodan, Israeli bus company served in Beersheba had Volvo B7L (Mercury bodywork by Merkavim) and Hispano Habit. Kavim had only Mercury Merkavim B7L (except one Hispano Habit), Metropoline had Volvo B7L with Mercury bodywork and Egged had B7L as well. In 2005, Wrightbus unveiled the Wright StreetCar which is a tram-like articulated bus built with modified B7LA chassis.

A drag link converts rotary motion from a crank arm, to a second bellcrank, usually in an automotive steering system. Automotive use The term is commonly used in automotive technology for the link in steering linkage that converts rotation of a pitman arm to a steering arm and eventually to tie rod links which pivot the wheels to be steered. The drag link converts the sweeping arc of the steering arm to linear motion in the plane of the other steering links. Typically, one end of the drag link is connected via the Pitman arm and steering gearbox to the steering wheel (providing the connection between the driver and the steering system); the other end is attached to the steering linkage, by the steering arm.the pit arm is the major part of the system. An alternate steering mechanism is a rack and pinion, a three bar linkage that eliminates the drag link by directly moving a center link. \\"The drag link connects the pitman arm to the steering arm, or in some applications it connects to the tie rod assembly. Unlike a center link, the drag link does not connect to an idler arm, and has no inner tie rod ends attached to it. On some applications the drag link swings from the front to the rear of the vehicle. On these applications the drag link connects to the steering arm located at the wheel. In some Jeep applications, the drag link will swing from right to left on the vehicle and will connect to the steering arm at the wheel.

Based in Mountain View, California, the company developed precursors to \\"USB, software modems, small touchscreens, touchscreen controller ICs, ASICs, multimedia email, networked games, streaming TV, and early e-commerce notions.\\" General Magic's main product was Magic Cap, the operating system used in 1994 by the Motorola Envoy and Sony's Magic Link PDA. It also introduced the programming language Telescript. After announcing it would cease operations in 2002, it was liquidated in 2004 with Paul Allen purchasing most of its patents. A new company bearing the same name emerged in 2016 that offers a map product called \\"Magic Earth\\" that utilizes the OpenStreetMap dataset. History =Apple project and spinoff (1989)= The original project started in 1989 within Apple Computer, when Marc Porat convinced Apple's CEO at the time John Sculley that the next generation of computing would require a partnership of computer, communications and consumer electronics companies to cooperate. Known as the Paradigm project, the project ran for some time within Apple, but management remained generally uninterested and the team struggled for resources. Eventually they approached Sculley with the idea of spinning off the group as a separate company, which occurred in May 1990. In 1990 Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfeld, and Bill Atkinson in Mountain View, California founded it. Apple took a minority stake in the company, with John Sculley joining the General Magic board. Porat, Hertzfeld and Atkinson were soon joined at General Magic by Susan Kare, and most of Apple's System 7 team, including Bruce Leak, Darin Adler and Phil Goldman. During the early 1990s, Joanna Hoffman was vice president of marketing. In 1990, Porat wrote the following note to Sculley: \\"A tiny computer, a phone, a very personal object . . . It must be beautiful. It must offer the kind of personal satisfaction that a fine piece of jewelry brings. It will have a perceived value even when it's not being used... Once you use it you won't be able to live without it.\\" =Early years (1992‚Äì1994)= The company initially operated in near-complete secrecy. By 1992, some of the world's largest electronics corporations, including Sony, Motorola, Matsushita, Philips and AT&T; Corporation were partners and investors in General Magic, creating significant buzz in the industry. Sculley, Motorola CEO George Fisher, Sony president Norio Ogha, and AT&T; division chairman Victor Pelsen became board members. As the operations expanded, the company reportedly let rabbits roam the offices to inspire creativity. In 1992‚Äì1993, while Sculley was still a director of General Magic, Apple entered the consumer electronics market with a poorly-received \\"personal digital assistant\\" that became the Apple Newton. By early 1993, Newton (originally designed as a tablet with no communications capabilities) started to attract market interest away from General Magic. In February 1993, the company had 100 employees. On February 8, the New York Times referred to General Magic as \\"Silicon Valley's most closely watched start-up company.\\" It reported that the company was introducing software technology called Telescript with the intent of creating a \\"standard for transmitting messages among any machines that compute, regardless of who makes them.\\" The company also announced the software Magic Cap, an operating system catered to communications. Telescript would eventually come out in 1996 at the start of the internet boom. In an article titled \\"Here's Where Woodstock Meets Silicon Valley,\\" on February 27, 1993, the New York Times reported that General Magic had backing from \\"American Telephone and Telegraph, Sony, Motorola, Philips Electronics and Matsushita Electric Industrial.\\" Marc Porat remained the chief executive of the company. By 1994, the \\"General Magic Alliance\\" of cross- industry partners had expanded to 16 global telecommunications and consumer electronics companies, including Cable & Wireless, France Telecom, NTT, Northern Telecom, Toshiba, Oki, Sanyo, Mitsubishi, and Fujitsu. Each of the so-called \\"Founding Partners\\" invested up to $6 million in the company and named a senior executive to the company's \\"Founding Partner's Council.\\" The first \\"General Magic Alliance\\" hardware products, using the Magic Cap software, were two personal digital assistants (PDAs) that came out in the summer of 1994, with Motorola producing the Motorola Envoy Personal Wireless Communicator\\"Motorola's Envoy First to Run Magic Cap.\\" Byte.com fetched 21 July 2008 and Sony producing the $800 wireline Sony Magic Link. Alliance partner AT&T; launched its PersonaLink network to host the devices, a closed network that did not connect to the emerging internet. AT&T; eventually shut down the PersonaLink network in 1996. =IPO (1995)= The company launched an IPO on NASDAQ in February 1995. General Magic raised $96 million in the IPO, and a total of $200 million from 16 different investors. The company's stock value doubled after its IPO. =Portico service (1996)= Steve Markman was hired to run General Magic in 1996, and he hired Kevin Surace to head a new telephony group. This new team of 60‚Äì70 people set out to create a voice recognition-based personal assistant service that would be as close to human interaction as possible. The first service delivered was Portico (code named Serengeti during development), and the interface was called Mary, named after Mary McDonald-Lewis, who voiced Portico, Serengeti and GM's later version, OnStar. Portico synchronized to devices such as the Palm Connected Organizer and Microsoft Outlook and handled voicemail, call forwarding, email, calendar etc., all through the user's own personal 800 number. General Magic was the first company to employ a large number of linguists to make their software seem real and responses varied, with General Magic investors receiving several key patents relating to voice recognition and artificial personality. The Portico system was also scaled back and sold through many partners including Quest and Excite. At its peak, the system supported approximately 2.5 million users. In 1997 Steve Markman hired Linda Hayes as Chief Marketing Officer, who in turn hired a new marketing team, which launched Portico. The Portico launch is attributed with lifting General Magic's stock price from $1 in 1997 to $18 in 2000. According to Fast Company, the company's original [device] idea was \\"practically, dead,\\" with people not buying General Magic devices in quantity. =Spinoffs and myTalk (1998‚Äì2000)= While Portico ran its voice portal business, the original handheld group was spun off in 1998 as Icras. The new company sold the Magic Cap OS as hardware named DataRover and focused on vertical market systems. General Magic announced a major licensing deal and investments from Microsoft in March 1998. The deal gave Microsoft access to certain intellectual property, and helped General Magic move toward integrating Portico with Microsoft products. The OnStar Virtual Advisor was developed at this time as well for General Motors. In 1999 the Marketing Team developed a separate consumer product called MyTalk. Created by Kevin Wray, the MyTalk product was a success and went on to win the Computerworld Smithsonian Award for the first commercially successful voice recognition consumer product. Today MyTalk was also listed in the permanent Smithsonian Museum collection.permanent Smithsonian Museum collection Because of the product's momentum, the intent was to spin off Hayes‚Äô group with Wray leading the product management. However, because of failure to agree on technology licensing terms, the spin-off stalled. =Shutdown (1999‚Äì2004)= By 1999, the company's stock had plunged significantly, with Forbes attributing the drop to \\"losses, layoffs and missed projections.\\" Most of the management that was involved in bringing Portico to market left by early 2000 to pursue other interests with Internet startups. A new team was brought in led by Kathleen Layton. The new team took the company in the direction of turning its voice services into enterprise software offerings. The company announced it would cease operations on September 18, 2002. The company was liquidated in 2004. The OnStar assets were turned over to EDS to run for General Motors. The patents were auctioned by the court. Most of the patents the company had developed were purchased by Paul Allen. Products and technology According to Electronics Weekly, the company \\"developed a precursor of USB, software modems, small touchscreens, touchscreen controller ICs, ASICs, multimedia email, networked games, streaming TV and early e-commerce notions.\\" =Magic Cap= General Magic's main product was Magic Cap, an operating system which allowed users to \\"set their own rules for message alerts and acquiring information\\" on PDAs, according to CNET. The basic idea behind the system was to distribute the typical computing load across many machines in the network using Magic Cap, which was a fairly minimal operating system that was essentially a UI. The UI is based on a \\"rooms\\" metaphor; for example, e-mail and an address book can be found in the office, and games might be found in a living room. User applications were generally written in Magic Script, a utility language variant of the C programming language with object oriented extensions. It was used on the Envoy PDA by Motorola and the MagicLink PDA by Sony. Sony and Motorola introduced Magic Cap devices in late 1994, based on the Motorola 68300 Dragon microprocessor. The launch suffered from a lack of real supporting infrastructure. Unlike the Newton and other PDAs being introduced at the same time, the Magic Cap system also did not rely on handwriting recognition, putting it at a marketing disadvantage. Partners ended production of Magic Cap devices by 1997. General Magic planned to release Magic Cap software development tools with Metrowerks by the summer of 1995. =Telescript= Its other software, Telescript, was \\"software-agent technology that would search the Web and automatically retrieve information such as stock quotes and airline ticket prices.\\" The script was introduced with the intent of creating a \\"standard for transmitting messages among any machines that compute, regardless of who makes them.\\" The Telescript programming language made communications a first-class primitive of the language. Telescript is compiled into a cross-platform bytecode in much the same fashion as the Java programming language, but is able to migrate running processes between virtual machines. The developers saw a time when Telescript application engines would be ubiquitous, and interconnected Telescript engines would form a \\"Telescript Cloud\\" across which mobile applications could execute. Legacy The company achieved many technical breakthroughs, including software modems (eliminating the need for modem chips), small touchscreens and touchscreen controller ASICs, highly integrated systems-on-a- chip designs for its partners' devices, rich multimedia email, networked games, streaming television, and early versions of e-commerce. According to former General Magic employee Marco DeMiroz, it was the \\"Fairchild [Semiconductor] of the 90s.\\" A documentary film about the company opened at the Tribeca Film Festival April 20, 2018. It was later shown at the SFFilm Festival in San Francisco on November 3, 2018. The company founders had hired filmmakers including Sarah Kerruish to document their development process in the 1990s, and Kerruish included some of that original footage of General Magic's offices in the film. The film includes interviews with Marc Porat, Andy Hertzfeld, Joanna Hoffman, Megan Smith, and Tony Fadell.

The besieged Company forces and civilians in Cawnpore (now Kanpur) were unprepared for an extended siege and surrendered to rebel forces under Nana Sahib, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad. However, their evacuation from Cawnpore turned into a massacre, and most of the men were killed. As an East India Company rescue force from Allahabad approached Cawnpore, 120 British women and children captured by the Sepoy forces were killed in what came to be known as the Bibighar Massacre, their remains being thrown down a nearby well in an attempt to hide the evidence. Following the recapture of Cawnpore and the discovery of the massacre, the angry Company forces engaged in widespread retaliation against captured rebel soldiers and local civilians. The murders greatly embittered the British rank-and-file against the Sepoy rebels and inspired the war cry \\"Remember Cawnpore!\\". Background Cawnpore was an important garrison town for the East India Company forces. Located on the Grand Trunk Road, it lay on the approaches to Sindh (Sind), Punjab and Awadh (Oudh). By June 1857, the Indian rebellion had spread to several areas near Cawnpore, namely Meerut, Agra, Mathura, and Lucknow. However, the Indian sepoys at Cawnpore initially remained loyal. The British General at Cawnpore, Hugh Wheeler, knew the local language, had adopted local customs, and was married to an Indian woman. He was confident that the sepoys at Cawnpore would remain loyal to him, and sent two British companies (one each of the 84th and 32nd Regiments) to besieged Lucknow. The British contingent in Cawnpore consisted of around nine hundred people, including around three hundred military men, around three hundred women and children, and about one hundred and fifty merchants, business owners, drummers (salesman), engineers and others. The rest were the native servants, who left soon after the commencement of the siege. In the case of a rebellion by the sepoys in Cawnpore, the most suitable defensive location for the British was the magazine located in the north of the city. It had thick walls, ample ammunition and stores, and also hosted the local treasury. However, General Wheeler decided to take refuge in the south of the city, in an entrenchment composed of two barracks surrounded by a mud wall. There was a military building site to the south of Cawnpore, where nine barracks were being constructed at the dragoon barracks. The British soldiers found it difficult to dig deep trenches, as it was hot summer season. The area also lacked good sanitary facilities, and there was only one well (which would be exposed to enemy fire in case of an attack). Also, there were several buildings overlooking the entrenchment that would provide cover for the attackers, allowing them to easily shoot down on the defenders. General Wheeler's choice of this location to make a stand remains controversial, given the availability of safer and more defensible places in Cawnpore. It is believed that he was expecting reinforcements to come from the southern part of the city. He also assumed that, in case of a rebellion, the Indian troops would probably collect their arms, ammunition and money, and would head to Delhi and therefore, he did not expect a long siege. Rebellion at Fatehgarh The first sign of the rebellion at Cawnpore came in the form of a rebellion at Fatehgarh (or Futteghur), a military station on the banks of the Ganges. To disperse the Indian troops away from Cawnpore, and lessen the chances of a rebellion, General Wheeler decided to send them on various \\"missions\\". On one such mission, he sent the 2nd Oudh Irregulars to Fatehgarh. On the way to Fatehgarh, General Wheeler's forces under the command of Fletcher Hayes and Lieutenant Barbour met two more Englishmen, Fayrer and Carey. On the night of 31 May 1857, Hayes and Carey departed to a nearby town to confer with the local magistrate. After their departure, the Indian troops rebelled and decapitated Fayrer. Barbour was also killed, as he tried to escape. When Hayes and Carey came back the next morning, an older Indian officer galloped towards them and advised them to run away. However, as the Indian officer explained the situation to them, the rebel Indian sowars (cavalry troopers) raced towards them. Hayes was killed as he tried to ride away, while Carey escaped to safety. Outbreak of rebellion at Cawnpore There were four Indian regiments in Cawnpore: the 1st, 53rd and 56th Native Infantry, and the 2nd Bengal Cavalry. Although the sepoys in Cawnpore had not rebelled, the European families began to drift into the entrenchment as the news of rebellion in the nearby areas reached them. The entrenchment was fortified, and the Indian sepoys were asked to collect their pay one by one, so as to avoid an armed mob. The Indian soldiers considered the fortification, and the artillery being primed, as a threat. On the night of 2 June 1857, a British officer named Lieutenant Cox fired on his Indian guard while drunk. Cox missed his target, and was thrown into the jail for a night. The very next day, a hastily convened court acquitted him, which led to discontent among the Indian soldiers. There were also rumours that the Indian troops were to be summoned to a parade, where they were to be massacred. All these factors influenced them to rebel against the East India Company rule. The rebellion began at 1:30 AM on 5 June 1857, with three pistol shots from the rebel soldiers of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry. Elderly Risaldar-Major Bhowani Singh, who chose not to hand over the regimental colours and join the rebel sepoys, was subsequently cut down by his subordinates. The 53rd and 56th Native Infantry, which were apparently the most loyal units in the area, were awoken by the shootings. Some soldiers of the 56th attempted to leave. The European artillery assumed that they were also rebelling, and opened fire on them. The soldiers of the 53rd were also caught in the crossfire. The 1st N.I. rebelled and left in the early morning of 6 June 1857. On the same day, the 53rd N.I. also went off, taking with them the regimental treasure and as much ammunition as they could carry. Around 150 sepoys remained loyal to General Wheeler. After obtaining arms, ammunition and money, the rebel troops started marching towards Delhi to seek further orders from Bahadur Shah II, who had been proclaimed the Badshah- e-Hind (\\"Emperor of India\\"). The British officers were relieved, thinking that they would not face a long siege. Nana Sahib's involvement Nana Sahib was the adopted heir to Baji Rao II, the former peshwa of the Maratha Confederacy. The East India Company had decided that the pension and honours of the lineage would not be passed on to Nana Sahib, as he was not a natural born heir. Nana Sahib had sent his envoy Dewan Azimullah Khan to London, to petition the Queen against the Company's decision, but failed to evoke a favourable response. In May 1857, Nana Sahib arrived in Cawnpore with 300 soldiers, stating that he intended to support the British: Wheeler asked him to take charge of the government treasury in the Nawabganj area. Amid the chaos in Cawnpore in 1857, Nana Sahib entered the British magazine with his contingent. The soldiers of the 53rd Native Infantry, which was guarding the magazine, were not fully aware of the situation in the rest of the city. They assumed that Nana Sahib had come to guard the magazine on behalf of the British, as he had earlier declared his loyalty to the British, and had even sent some volunteers to be at the disposal of General Wheeler. However, Nana Sahib joined the rebels. After taking possession of the treasury, Nana Sahib advanced up the Grand Trunk Road. His aim was to restore the Maratha Confederacy under Peshwa tradition, and he decided to capture Cawnpore. On his way, Nana Sahib met with rebel soldiers at Kalyanpur. The soldiers were on their way to Delhi, to meet Bahadur Shah II. Nana Sahib initially decided to march to Delhi and fight the British as a Mughal subordinate, but Azimullah Khan advised him that leading the rebels in Kanpur would increase his prestige more than serving a weak Muslim king. Nana Sahib asked the rebel soldiers to go back to Cawnpore, and help him in defeating the British. The rebels were reluctant at first, but decided to join Nana Sahib, when he promised to double their pay and reward them with gold, if they were to destroy the British entrenchment. Attack on Wheeler's entrenchment Photograph entitled, \\"The Hospital in General Wheeler's entrenchment, Cawnpore.\\" (1858) The hospital was the site of the first major loss of British lives in Cawnpore On 5 June 1857, Nana Sahib sent a polite note to General Wheeler, informing him that he intended to attack on the following morning, at 10 AM. On 6 June Nana Sahib's forces (including the rebel soldiers) attacked the British entrenchment at 10:30 AM. The British were not adequately prepared for the attack, but managed to defend themselves for a long time, as the attacking forces were reluctant to enter the entrenchment. Nana Sahib's forces had been led to falsely believe that the entrenchment had gunpowder-filled trenches that would explode if they got closer. As the news of Nana Sahib's advances against the British garrison spread, several of the rebel sepoys joined him. By 10 June, he was believed to be leading around twelve thousand to fifteen thousand Indian soldiers. Up to 1,000 British troops, their families and loyal sepoys were holed up in Gen Wheeler's entrenchment in Kanpur for three weeks in June 1857 where they were constantly bombarded by a local prince, Nana Sahib's army. The British held out in their makeshift fort for three weeks with little water and food supplies. Many died as a result of sunstroke and lack of water. As the ground was too hard to dig graves, the British would pile the dead bodies of their killed outside the buildings, and drag and dump them inside a dried well during the night. The lack of sanitation facilities led to spread of diseases such as dysentery and cholera, further weakening the defenders. There was also a small outbreak of smallpox, although this was relatively confined. During the first week of the siege, Nana Sahib's forces encircled the entrenchment, created loopholes and established firing positions in the surrounding buildings. Captain John Moore of the 32nd (Cornwall) Light Infantry countered this by launching night-time sorties. Nana Sahib withdrew his headquarters to Savada House (or Savada Kothi), situated about two miles away. In response to Moore's sorties, Nana Sahib decided to attempt a direct assault on the British entrenchment, but the rebel soldiers displayed a lack of enthusiasm. On 11 June, Nana Sahib's forces changed their tactics. They started concentrated firing on specific buildings, firing endless salvos of round shot into the entrenchment. They successfully damaged some of the smaller barrack buildings, and also tried to set fire to the buildings. The first major assault by Nana Sahib's side took place on the evening of 12 June. However, the attacking soldiers were still convinced that the British had laid out gunpowder-filled trenches, and did not enter the area. On 13 June, the British lost their hospital building to a fire, which destroyed most of their medical supplies and caused the deaths of a number of wounded and sick artillerymen who burned alive in the inferno. The loss of the hospital was a major blow to the defenders. Nana Sahib's forces gathered for an attack, but were repulsed by the canister shots from artillery under the command of Lieutenant George Ashe. By 21 June, the British had lost around a third of their numbers. Wheeler's repeated messages to Henry Lawrence, the commanding officer in Lucknow, could not be answered as that garrison was itself under siege. =Assault on 23 June= Attack on 23 June 1857 The sniper fire and the bombardment continued until 23 June 1857, the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Plassey, which took place on 23 June 1757 and was one of the pivotal battles leading to the expansion of British rule in India. One of the driving forces of the sepoy rebellion was a prophecy which predicted the downfall of East India Company rule in India exactly one hundred years after the Battle of Plassey. This prompted the rebel soldiers under Nana Sahib to launch a major attack on the British entrenchment on 23 June 1857. The rebel soldiers of the 2nd Bengal Cavalry led the charge, but were repulsed with canister shot when they approached within 50 yards of the British entrenchment. After the cavalry assault, the soldiers of the 1st Native Infantry launched an attack on the British, advancing behind cotton bales and parapets. They lost their commanding officer, Radhay Singh, to the opening volley from the British. They had hoped to get protection from cotton bales; however, the bales caught fire from the canister shot, and became a hazard to them. On the other side of the entrenchment, some of the rebel soldiers engaged in a hand combat against 17 British men led by Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson. By the end of the day, the attackers were unable to gain an entry into the entrenchment. The attack left over 25 rebel soldiers dead, with very few casualties on the British side. Surrender of the British forces The British garrison had taken heavy losses as a result of successive bombardments, sniper fire, and assaults. It was also suffering from disease and low supplies of food, water and medicine. General Wheeler's personal morale had been low, after his son Lieutenant Gordon Wheeler was decapitated by a roundshot. With approval of General Wheeler, a Eurasian civil servant called Jonah Shepherd slipped out of the entrenchment in disguise to ascertain the condition of Nana Sahib's forces. He was quickly imprisoned by the rebel soldiers. At the same time, Nana Sahib's forces were wary of entering the entrenchment, as they believed that it had gunpowder-filled trenches. Nana Sahib and his advisers came up with a plan to end the deadlock. On 24 June, they sent a female European prisoner, Mrs Rose Greenway, to the entrenchment with their message. In return for surrender, Nana Sahib promised the safe passage of the British to the Satichaura Ghat, a landing on the Ganges from which they could depart for Allahabad. General Wheeler rejected the offer, because it had not been signed, and there was no guarantee that the offer was made by Nana Sahib himself. The next day, 25 June, Nana Sahib sent a second note, signed by himself, through another elderly female prisoner, Mrs Jacobi. The British camp divided into two groups ‚Äì one in favour of continuing the defence, while the second group was willing to trust Nana Sahib. During the next 24 hours, there was no bombardment by Nana Sahib's forces. Finally, General Wheeler decided to surrender, in return for a safe passage to Allahabad. After a day of preparation, and burying their dead, the British decided to leave for Allahabad on the morning of 27 June 1857. Satichaura Ghat massacre The British boats were stuck on mudbanks preventing departure and, amid much confusion, the soldiers were subsequently captured or massacred by Nana Sahib's rebel army. 1858 picture of Sati Chaura Ghat on the banks of the Ganges River, where on 27 June 1857 many British men lost their lives and the surviving women and children were taken prisoner by the rebels. On the morning of the 27 June, a large British column led by General Wheeler emerged from the entrenchment. Nana Sahib sent a number of carts, dolis and elephants to enable the women, the children and the sick to proceed to the river banks. The British officers and military men were allowed to take their arms and ammunition with them, and were escorted by nearly the whole of the rebel army. The British reached the Satichaura Ghat by 8 AM. Nana Sahib had arranged around forty boats, belonging to a boatman called Hardev Mallah, for their departure to Allahabad. The Ganges river was unusually dry at the Satichaura Ghat, and the British found it difficult to drift the boats away. General Wheeler and his party were the first aboard and the first to manage to set their boat off. There was some confusion, as the Indian boatmen jumped overboard after hearing bugles from the banks, and started swimming toward the shore. As they jumped, some fires on the boats were knocked over, setting a few of the boats ablaze. Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened next at the Satichaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, soon afterwards, the departing British were attacked by the rebel sepoys, and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the rebels had placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, on purpose to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib's camp had previously arranged for the rebels to fire upon and kill all the British. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of the betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had pre- planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Satichaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion, and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib and his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come. After the fighting began, Nana Sahib's general Tatya Tope allegedly ordered the 2nd Bengal Cavalry unit and some artillery units to open fire on the British. The rebel cavalry sowars moved into the water, to kill the remaining British soldiers with swords and pistols. The surviving men were killed, while the women and children were taken into captivity, as Nana Sahib did not approve of their killing.G. W. Williams, \\"Memorandum\\", printed with Narrative of the Events in the NWP in 1857‚Äì58 (Calcutta, n.d.), section on Kanpur (hereafter Narrative Kanpur), p. 20: \\"A man of great influence in the city, and a government official, has related a circumstance that is strange, if true, viz. that whilst the massacre was being carried on at the ghat, a trooper of the 2nd Cavalry, reported to the Nana, then at Savada house, that his enemies, their wives and children were exterminated ... On hearing which, the Nana replied, that for the destruction of women and children, there was no necessity' and directed the sowar to return with an order to stay their slaughter\\". See also J. W. Kaye, History of the Sepoy War in India, 1857‚Äì58, 3 vols. (Westport, 1971 repr.), ii, p. 258. (This reprint of Kaye's work carries the title History of the Indian Mutiny of 1857‚Äì58.) Around 120 women and children were taken prisoner and escorted to Savada House, Nana Sahib's headquarters during the siege. By this time, two of the boats had been able to drift away: General Wheeler's boat, and a second boat which was holed beneath the waterline by a round shot fired from the bank. The British people in the second boat panicked and attempted to make it to General Wheeler's boat, which was slowly drifting to safer waters. General Wheeler's boat had around sixty people aboard, and was being pursued down the riverbanks by the rebel soldiers. The boat frequently grounded on the sandbanks. On one such sandbank, Lieutenant Thomson led a charge against the rebel soldiers, and was able to capture some ammunition. Next morning, the boat again stuck on a sandbank, resulting in another charge by Thomson and eleven British soldiers. After a fierce fight on shore, Thomson and his men decided to return to the boat, but did not find it where they expected to. Meanwhile, the rebels had launched an attack on the boat from the opposite bank. After some firing, the British men on the boat decided to fly the white flag. They were escorted off the boat and taken back to Savada house. The surviving British men were sat on the ground, and Nana Sahib's soldiers got ready to fire on them. Their wives insisted that they would die with their husbands, but were pulled away. Nana Sahib granted the British chaplain Moncrieff's request to read prayers before they died. The British were initially wounded by the guns, and then killed with swords. The women and children were confined to Savada House, to be reunited later with their remaining colleagues, who had been captured earlier, at Bibighar. Being unable to find the boat, Thomson's party decided to run barefoot to evade the rebel soldiers. The party took refuge in a small shrine, where Thomson led a last charge. Six of the British soldiers were killed, while the rest managed to escape to the riverbank, where they tried to escape by jumping into the river and swimming to safety. However, a group of rebels from the village started clubbing them as they reached the bank. One of the soldiers was killed, while the other four, including Thomson, swam back to the centre of the river. After swimming downstream for a few hours, they reached shore, where they were discovered by some Rajput matchlockmen, who worked for Raja Dirigibijah Singh, a British loyalist. These carried the British soldiers to the Raja's palace. These four British soldiers were the only male survivors from the British side, apart from Jonah Shepherd (who had been captured by Nana Sahib before the surrender). The four men included two privates named Murphey and Sullivan, Lieutenant Delafosse, and Lieutenant (later Captain) Mowbray Thomson. The men spent several weeks recuperating, eventually making their way back to Cawnpore which was, by that time, back under British control. Murphey and Sullivan both died shortly after from cholera, Delafosse went on to join the defending garrison during the Siege of Lucknow, and Thomson took part in rebuilding and defending the entrenchment a second time under General Windham, eventually writing a firsthand account of his experiences entitled The Story of Cawnpore (London, 1859). Another survivor of the Satichaura Ghat massacre was Amy Horne, a 17-year-old Anglo-Indian girl. She had fallen from her boat and had been swept downstream during the riverside massacre. Soon after scrambling ashore she met up with Wheeler's youngest daughter, Margaret. The two girls hid in the undergrowth for a number of hours until they were discovered by a group of rebels. Margaret was taken away on horseback, never to be seen again (it was later rumoured that she survived and was married to a Muslim soldier) and Amy was led to a nearby village where she was taken under the protection of a Muslim rebel leader in exchange for converting to Islam. Just over six months later, she was rescued by Highlanders from Sir Colin Campbell's column on their way to relieve Lucknow. Bibighar massacre Bibighar house, in the centre background, where European women and children were killed, 1858. The well where their bodies were found is in the foreground. A hand-written caption identifies the man as Gungoo Mehter who was tried at Kanpur for killing many of the Sati Chaura survivors, including many women and children. He was convicted and hanged at Kanpur on 8 September 1859. The Bibighar Well site where a memorial had been built by 1859. Samuel Bourne, 1860. The surviving British women and children were moved from the Savada House to Bibighar (\\"The House of the Ladies\\"), a villa-type house in Cawnpore. Initially, around 120 women and children were confined to Bibighar. They were later joined by some other women and children, the survivors from General Wheeler's boat. Another group of British women and children from Fatehgarh, and some other captive European women were also confined to Bibighar. In total, there were around 200 women and children in Bibighar. Nana Sahib placed the care of these survivors under a sex worker called Hussaini Khanum (also known as Hussaini Begum). She put the captives to grinding corn for chapatis. Poor sanitary conditions at Bibighar led to deaths from cholera and dysentery. Nana Sahib decided to use these prisoners for bargaining with the East India Company. The Company forces, consisting of around 1,000 British, 150 Sikh soldiers and 30 irregular cavalry, had set out from Allahabad, under the command of General Henry Havelock, to retake Cawnpore and Lucknow. The first relief force assembled under Havelock included 64th Regiment of Foot and 78th Highlanders (brought back from the Anglo-Persian War), the first arrivals of the diverted China expedition, 5th Fusiliers, part of the 90th Light Infantry (seven companies), the 84th (York and Lancaster) from Burma, and EIC Madras European Fusiliers, brought up to Calcutta from Madras. Havelock's initial forces were later joined by the forces under the command of Major Renaud and Colonel James Neill, which had arrived from Calcutta to Allahabad on 11 June. Nana Sahib demanded that the East India Company forces under General Havelock and Colonel Neill retreat to Allahabad. However, the Company forces advanced relentlessly towards Cawnpore. Nana Sahib sent an army to check their advance. The two armies met at Fatehpur on 12 July, where General Havelock's forces emerged victorious and captured the town. Nana Sahib then sent another force under the command of his brother, Bala Rao. On 15 July, the British forces under General Havelock defeated Bala Rao's army in the Battle of Aong, just outside the Aong village. On 16 July, Havelock's forces started advancing to Cawnpore. During the Battle of Aong, Havelock was able to capture some of the rebel soldiers, who informed him that there was an army of 5,000 rebel soldiers with 8 artillery pieces further up the road. Havelock decided to launch a flank attack on this army, but the rebel soldiers spotted the flanking manoeuvre and opened fire. The battle resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, but cleared the road to Cawnpore for the British. By this time, it became clear that Sahib's bargaining attempts had failed and the Company forces were approaching Cawnpore. Nana Sahib was informed that the British troops led by Havelock and Neill were indulging in violence against the Indian villagers. Pramod Nayar, believes that the ensuing Bibighar massacre was a reaction to the news of violence being perpetrated by the advancing British troops. Nana Sahib, and his associates, including Tatya Tope and Azimullah Khan, debated about what to do with the captives at Bibighar. Some of Nana Sahib's advisors had already decided to kill the captives at Bibighar, as revenge for the executions of Indians by the advancing British forces. The women of Nana Sahib's household opposed the decision and went on a hunger strike, but their efforts went in vain. Finally, on 15 July, an order was given to murder the women and children imprisoned at Bibighar. The details of the incident, such as who ordered the massacre, are not clear. The rebel sepoys executed the four surviving male hostages from Fatehghar, one of them a 14-year-old boy. But they refused to obey the order to kill women and the other children. Some of the sepoys agreed to remove the women and children from the courtyard, when Tatya Tope threatened to execute them for dereliction of duty. Nana Sahib left the building because he didn't want to be a witness to the unfolding massacre. The British women and children were ordered to come out of the assembly rooms, but they refused to do so and clung to each other. They barricaded themselves in, tying the door handles with clothing. At first, around twenty rebel soldiers opened fire from the outside of the Bibighar, firing through holes in the boarded windows. The soldiers of the squad that was supposed to fire the next round were disturbed by the scene, and discharged their shots into the air. Soon after, upon hearing the screams and groans inside, the rebel soldiers threw down their weapons and declared that they were not going to kill any more women and children. An angry Begum Hussaini Khanum denounced the sepoys' act as cowardice, and asked her aide to finish the job of killing the captives. Her lover hired butchers, who murdered the captives with cleavers; the butchers left when it seemed that all the captives had been killed. However, a few women and children had managed to survive by hiding under the other dead bodies. It was agreed that the bodies of the victims would be thrown down a dry well by some sweepers. The next morning the rebels arrived to dispose of the bodies and they found that three women who were still alive, and also three children aged between four and seven years old . The surviving women were cast into the well by the sweepers, who had also been told to strip the corpses. The sweepers then threw the three little boys into the well one at a time, the youngest first. Some victims, among them small children, were therefore buried alive in a heap of butchered corpses. None survived. Recapture and retribution by the British The Company forces reached Cawnpore on 16 July, and captured the city. A group of British officers and soldiers set out to the Bibighar, to rescue the captives, assuming that they were still alive. However, when they reached the site, they found it empty and blood-splattered, with the bodies of most of the 200 women and children having already been dismembered and thrown down the courtyard well or into the Ganges river.Hibbert, Christopher. The Great Mutiny: India, 1857. Penguin, 1980, p. 212. 0140047522. Piles of children's clothing and severed women's hair blew on the wind and lodged in tree branches around the compound; the tree in the courtyard nearest the well was smeared with the brains of numerous children and infants who had been dashed headfirst against the trunk and thrown down the well. The British troops were horrified and enraged. Upon learning of the massacre, the infuriated British garrison engaged in a surge of violence against the local population of Cawnpore, including looting and burning of houses, with the justification that none of the local noncombatants had done anything to stop the massacre. Brigadier General Neill, who took the command at Cawnpore, immediately began a program of swift and vicious drumhead military justice (culminating in summary execution) for any sepoy rebel captured from the city who was unable to prove he was not involved in the massacre. Rebels confessing to or believed to be involved in the massacre were forced to lick the floor of the Bibighar compound, after it had been wetted with water by low caste people, while being whipped.Raugh, Harold E. The Victorians at War, 1815‚Äì1914: An Encyclopedia of British Military History. ABC-CLIO, 2004, p. 89. 1576079252. The sepoys were then religiously disgraced by being forced to eat (or force fed) beef (if Hindu) or pork (if Muslim). The Muslim sepoys were sewn into pig skins before being hanged, and low-caste Hindu street sweepers were employed to execute the high-caste Brahmin rebels to add additional religious disgrace to their punishment. Some were also forced by the British to lick clean buildings stained with the blood of the recently deceased, before being publicly hanged. Most of the prisoners were hanged within direct view of the well at the Bibighar and buried in shallow ditches by the roadside. Others were shot or bayonetted, while some were also tied across cannons that were then fired, an execution method initially used by the rebels, and the earlier Indian powers, such as the Marathas and the Mughals. It is unclear whether this method of execution was reserved for special prisoners, or whether it was merely done in the retributive spirit of the moment. The massacre disgusted and embittered the British troops in India, with \\"Remember Cawnpore!\\" becoming a war cry for the British soldiers for the rest of the conflict. Acts of summary violence against towns and cities believed to harbour or support the rebellion also increased. In one of the villages, the Highlanders caught around 140 men, women and children. Ten men were hanged without any evidence or trial. Another sixty men were forced to build the gallows of wooden logs, while others were flogged and beaten. In another village, when around 2,000 villagers came out in protest brandishing lathis, the British troops surrounded them and set the village on fire. Villagers trying to escape were shot dead. Mass rapes of Indian women were also reported by sources. Drunk British soldiers, enraged at the reports of atrocities committed against British civilians, committed mass rapes against the native women of Cawnpore.  Aftermath  On 19 July, General Havelock resumed operations at Bithoor. Major Stevenson led a group of Madras Fusiliers and Sikh soldiers to Bithoor and occupied Nana Sahib's palace without any resistance. The British troops seized guns, elephants and camels, and set Nana Sahib's palace on fire. In November 1857, Tatya Tope gathered an army, mainly consisting of the rebel soldiers from the Gwalior contingent, to recapture Cawnpore. By 19 November, his 6,000-strong force had taken control of all the routes west and north-west of Cawnpore. However, his forces were defeated by the Company forces under Colin Campbell in the Second Battle of Cawnpore, marking the end of the rebellion in the Cawnpore area. Tatya Tope then joined Rani Lakshmibai. Nana Sahib disappeared and, by 1859, he had reportedly fled to Nepal. His ultimate fate was never determined. Up until 1888, there were rumours and reports that he had been captured and a number of individuals turned themselves in to the British claiming to be the aged Nana. As the majority of these reports turned out to be untrue, further attempts at apprehending him were abandoned. British civil servant Jonah Shepherd, who had been rescued by Havelock's army, spent the next few years after the rebellion attempting to put together a list of those killed in the entrenchment. He had lost his entire family during the siege. He eventually retired to a small estate north of Cawnpore in the late 1860s. Memorials A memorial erected (circa 1860) by the British at the Bibi Ghar well after the Mutiny was crushed. It was the work of Carlo Marochetti. After Indian independence the memorial was moved to the Memorial Church, Cawnpore. Albumen silver print by Samuel Bourne, 1860. After the revolt was suppressed, the British dismantled Bibighar. They raised a memorial railing and cross at the site of the well in which the bodies of the British women and children had been dumped. Meanwhile, the British forces conducted a punitive action under the lead of General Autrum by blowing down Nana Sahib's palace in Bithoor with cannons, in which Indian women and children including Nana Sahib's young daughter Mainavati were burned alive. Kalpi Devi, \\"Nana Sahib's daughter Maina was burnt alive by Britishers\\", Vol. \\"Balindan\\", Hindupanch news report, 1858. (Hindi) http://www.philoid.com/epub/ncert/9/119/ihks105 Also, the inhabitants of Cawnpore were forced to pay ¬£30,000 for the creation of the memorial as a 'punishment' for not coming to the aid of the British women and children in Bibighar. The Angel of the Resurrection was created by Baron Carlo Marochetti and completed in 1865. It has been called by various names throughout the centuries and came to be the most visited statue of British India. The chief proponent and private funder was Charlotte, Countess Canning, wife of the first Viceroy of India, Earl Canning. She approached her childhood friend, Marochetti, for models. In turn, Marochetti suggested that other sculptors be invited. Following the Countess's death, Earl Canning took over the commission. Canning rejected a number of designs accepting, in the end, a version of Marochetti's Crimean War memorial at Scutari, Turkey. The understated figure is an angel holding two branches of palm fronds across her chest. Despite assurances, 'The Angel' had some damage during the Independence celebrations of 1947 and she was later moved from her original site over the Bibi Ghar well to a garden at the side of All Soul's Church, Kanpore (Kanpur Memorial Church). The remains of a circular ridge of the well can still be seen at the Nana Rao Park, built after Indian independence. The British also erected the All Souls Memorial Church, in memory of the victims. An enclosed pavement outside the church marks the graves of over 70 British men captured and executed on 1 July 1857, four days after the Satichaura Ghat massacre. The marble Gothic screen with \\"mournful seraph\\" was transferred to the churchyard of the All Souls Church after Indian independence in 1947. The memorial to the British victims was replaced with a bust of Tatya Tope. There is a plaque to Capt. W Morphy and Lieut. Thomas Mackinnon who were killed on 28 November 1857 in Lichfield Cathedral. An additional memorial detailing the losses suffered by the 32nd Cornwall Regiment Light Infantry is located inside the west entrance to Exeter Cathedral. Literary references Many references to the event were made in later novels and films. Julian Rathbone describes the brutality of both British and Indian forces during the siege of Cawnpore in his novel The Mutiny. In the novel, the Indian nurse Lavanya rescues an English child, Stephen, during the Satichaura Ghat massacre. In Massacre at Cawnpore, V. A. Stuart describes the siege and the British defence through the eyes of the characters Sheridan, and his wife Emmy. George MacDonald Fraser's Flashman in the Great Game also contains lengthy scenes set in the entrenchment during the siege and also during the ensuing escape. Tom Williams' novel, Cawnpore, is also set against the background of the siege and massacre, which is seen from both the European and the Indian perspective. The contemporary Indian report by Kalpi devi in the local journal Hindupanch covered the incident of the punitive action by the British and burning down of Nana Sahib's palace along with his young daughter Mainavati in a prose.Kalpi Devi, \\"Nana Sahib's daughter Maina was burnt alive by Britishers\\", Vol. \\"Balindan\\", Hindupanch news report, 1858. (Hindi) The British press used it to describe the brutality involved in the public feeding of reptiles at the London zoological garden. In 1876, the Editor of the Animal World drew Dr. P L Sclater's attention to this and the press charged the Zoological Society of London with encouraging cruelty, \\"pandering to public brutality\\" while one writer in the Whitehall Review (27 April 1878), protested against \\"the Cawnpore Massacre enacted diurnally,\\" and headed his article, \\"Sepoyism at the Zoo.\\" See also * Second Battle of Cawnpore * Indian rebellion of 1857 References External links * 1857 Cawnpore via the Internet Archive * The Siege of Cawnpore Images Cawnpore, Siege of Cawnpore, Siege of History of Uttar Pradesh Satichaura Ghat massacre 1857 in India History of Kanpur Sieges involving the Indian kingdoms June 1857 events ","title":"Siege of Cawnpore"},{"id":"1793999","text":"Pabna District ( Pabna Zila) is a district in central Bangladesh. It is one of the \\"economically important districts\\" in Bangladesh. Its administrative capital is the eponymous Pabna town. History Archeologist Cunningham conjectured that the name \\"Pabna\\" might be derived from the Pundra or Poondrobordhon civilisation, whose capital was Mahasthangarh, the oldest city of Bangladesh, in neighbouring Bogra, but this hypothesis has not received general acceptance among scholars. In 1859‚Äì61, the district was one of the major areas involved in the Indigo revolt. Beginning in Yusufshahi period in 1873, the serfs resisted excessive demands of increased rents by feudal lords (zamindar), led by the nouveau riches Banerjees and Dwijendranath Tagore, by forming an Agrarian League. This largely peaceful movement found the support of the Lieutenant-governor of Bengal, George Campbell, who antagonised the absentee feudal lords. These protests are generally referred to as Pabna disturbances. In the following year, the district was one of the worst hit by famine.Kalyan Kumar Sen Gupta; Pabna Disturbances and the Politics of Rent 1873‚Äì1885; New Delhi 1974 The peasants' demands were finally partially met with the Rent Law Act of 1885. In 1875, Raaygonj was transferred back to Pabna from Bogra, and in 1879, a separate judgeship for the districts of Pabna and Bogra was created. Demographics Of the 2.1 million inhabitants, 51.17% are male; 90.12% are Muslims, 9.50% are Hindu, 0.22% are Christian, and 0.16% are other. The district has 2353 mosques, 420 Hindu temples, and 11 churches. No Buddhist pagoda is in Pabna. Sree Sree Thakur Anukulchandra Aasrom (missionary) beside Mental Hospital, Pabna at Hemayetpur has the largest Hindu temple in Pabna. Geography Pabna forms the south-east boundary of Rajshahi Division. Sirajganj District is on the north-east, while the Padma River, main stream of the holy river Ganges, in the south separates it from Rajbari District and Kushtia District. The Jamuna River runs along its eastern border separating it from Manikgonj District; and on the north-west, it has a common boundary with the Natore District. Its average maximum temperature is 36.8 ¬∞C, and the minimum is 9.6 ¬∞C; annual rainfall is 1872 mm. Characteristically, the soil of the district is divided into four, due to the flood plains of the Ganges, Karatoya, Jamuna, and Barind Tracts. Its main rivers are the Ganges, Ichamati, Gumani, Baral, and Hurasagar Rivers. =Climate= = Rivers = The district is intersected by rivers of varying magnitude. The river system, though, is constituted by the Padma and the Jamuna with their interlacing offshoots and tributaries. Besides these flowing streams, the interiorhas the abandoned beds of old rivers, most of which are dry except in the rains. The general trend of the drainage of the Serajganj subdivision is from north- west to south-east, with the rivers entering it from the north-west flow into the Jamuna after a tortuous course. In the Sadar subdivision, however, the general slope of the country is from west to east, and the main rivers fall into Hurasagar, an offshoot of the Jamuna. The following rivers flow through Pabna District: #Padma River #Ichhamati River #Baral River #Atrai River #Chiknai River #Jamuna River #Kazipur River #Karatoya River #Hurasgar River #Gumany River #Rotnai River #Badai river #kageshari river #sutikhali river #Komla river #chondraboti river #barnai river  Economy  *Main occupations: Agriculture 34%, agricultural farm-hands 22.77%, wage labourer 4.46%, transport 2.18%, weavers 2.85%, commerce 13.27%, service 7.26%, and others 13.21% *Land control: Among the peasants, 29% are landless peasants, with 49% small, 18% intermediate, and 4% rich. *Value of land: The market value of the land of the first grade is Tk 15500 per 0.01 acre. *Crops: Paddy rice, jute, wheat, sugarcane, oil seeds, onion, garlic, betel leaf (paan), pulses *Extinct or nearly extinct crops: Indigo, sesame, linseed, cereals such ase kaaun and cheena, and orhor pulses *Fruits: Mango, jackfruit, banana, lychee (lichu), coconut, guava, pomelo, and papaya *Fisheries, dairies, and poultries: Dairies 1069, fisheries 88, poultry 714, hatcheries 37 *Industries: Ishwardi EPZ; Pakshey paper mill, sugar mill, cotton mill, jute] press, edible oil mill, Square Pharmaceuticals, biscuit factory, most prominent rice industry is Purbasha Automatic Rice mills Ltd. in Ishwardi and flour mill (Rouf and sons Flour Mill), ice factory, welding, saw mill, cold storage: The SQUARE group established several factories in the district, namely pharmaceuticals, spices, food, toiletries, and textiles, and converting the agricultural economy of Pabna to an industrial society. *Cottage industries: Hand loom, bamboo and caneworks, blacksmith, goldsmith, potteries, woodworks, and tailoring *Main exports: Rice, jute, betel leaf, hosiery goods, cotton, cotton fabrics. *Active NGOs are: BRAC, CARE, ASA, Grameen Bank, Caritas, Proshika, Shomota, Thengamaara Mohila Shobuj Shongho (TMSS) and Polli Progoti, ASEAB, BOSS. =Irrigation= Water from the river Jamuna is pumped from Bera pump house to the east through the Baral river.

Transport Roads, waterways, railways, and one airport are present. The traditional paalkee (sedans), tomtom (horse carriages), and gorur gaari (bullock carts) are now going out of the fashion. The nosimon and korimon, locally made mechanical haulers using irrigation pumps as their main engines, are mainly used for transporting agricultural goods and rural folks. Inexpensive Chinese electric and petrol autobikes (tricycles) are gaining popularity as urban transport. Dhaka is about five hours by road. Hardinge Bridge and Lalon Shah Bridge over the Padma linked Pabna with Kushtia District and Khulna Division, and the southern Bangladesh. Before the Partition of India, it was a major stoppage for trains from Kolkata to Assam and Darjeeling. The Hardinge Bridge already passed a glorious and historical hundred years. Pabna is also connected to Dhaka by the age old roadway through the Jamuna River crossing at Nogorbari, opposite to the river crossing of Aricha at Manikgonj District.

It is notable for being the site of Los Angeles City College, Barnsdall Park and a hospital district. There are seven public and five private schools, as well as a branch of the Los Angeles Public Library and three hospitals. Almost two-thirds of the people living there were born outside the United States and 90% were renters. In 2000 the neighborhood had high percentages of never-married people and of single parents. History University of California, Southern Branch, on Vermont Avenue, 1922 In the early 20th century, the East Hollywood area was a farming village that also encompassed some of what is now Los Feliz. Parts of the neighborhood were formerly known as \\"Prospect Park.\\" In 1910 the towns of Hollywood and East Hollywood approved annexation to the City of Los Angeles in order to tap into the city water supply. In 1914, Children's Hospital was relocated from downtown LA to Vermont Avenue and Sunset Boulevard. Cahuenga Branch, Los Angeles Public Library In 1916 steel magnate Andrew Carnegie donated the money to construct the Cahuenga Branch of the Los Angeles Public Library on Santa Monica Boulevard. In the early 1920s, Barnsdall Park was built. The 1920s were also a time of massive immigration into East Hollywood. Armenian immigrants established the community that is now Little Armenia. The University of California Southern Branch, needing more space, moved west at the end of the 1920s to a ranch called Westwood and became UCLA. The old Southern Branch campus then became Los Angeles Junior College, which was later renamed Los Angeles City College. In 1930 Cedars of Lebanon Hospital was formed when Kaspare Cohn Hospital moved from East Los Angeles to a new building on Fountain Avenue and was renamed. US 101, the Hollywood Freeway, was built between 1947 and 1949. In the summer of 1999 three Metro Red Line subway stations opened, connecting East Hollywood more efficiently to the rest of the city. Demographics The 2000 U.S. census counted 73,967 residents in the 2.38-square-mile East Hollywood neighborhood‚Äîor 31,095 people per square mile, the third-highest population density in the city. In 2008, the city estimated that the population had increased to 78,192 - or 32,853 people per square mile. In 2000 the median age for residents was 31, about average for city and county neighborhoods; the percentage of residents aged 19 to 34 was among the county's highest. \\"East Hollywood,\\" Mapping L.A., Los Angeles Times The neighborhood was \\"moderately diverse\\" ethnically within Los Angeles, the statistics being Latino people of any race, 60.4%; Asians, 15.5%; Non-Hispanic Whites, 17.5%; blacks, 2.4%; and others, 4.1%. El Salvador (21.2%) and Mexico (20.1%) were the most common places of birth for the 66.5% of the residents who were born abroad‚Äîwhich was a high percentage compared to Los Angeles as a whole. The median yearly household income in 2008 dollars was $29,927, considered low for the city, and high percentages of households earned $40,000 or less. Renters occupied 91.3% of the housing stock, and house- or apartment- owners held 8.7%. The average household size of three people was average for Los Angeles. The percentages of never-married women (33.3%) and men (42.6%) were among the county's highest. One-fifth of the 3,281 families were headed by single parents, a high rate for Los Angeles. In 2000 there were 1,509 veterans, or 2.8% of the population, a low rate compared with the rest of the city and county. Geography East Hollywood borders Los Feliz to the north and Silver Lake, about 4 miles from Downtown Los Angeles to the east. It also borders Wilshire Center to the south and Hollywood on the west. East Hollywood includes the smaller communities of Thai Town, Little Armenia and Melrose Hill. =Nearby neighborhoods= Transportation Vermont and Sunset, Children's Hospital in the background East Hollywood is served by the Metro B Line subway which runs north-south along Vermont Avenue and east-west along Hollywood Boulevard. Metro subway stations include: *Vermont/Beverly *Vermont/Santa Monica *Vermont/Sunset *Hollywood/Western Over a dozen bus lines run on the major thoroughfares, including Metro's Rapid and Local service lines. Los Angeles Department of Transportation's DASH shuttle lines, serving East Hollywood, Hollywood, and the Griffith Observatory, also operate in the area. The 101/Hollywood Freeway cuts northwest from downtown Los Angeles, through Hollywood, to the San Fernando Valley. Education Thirteen percent of East Hollywood residents aged 25 and older had earned a four-year degree by 2000, an average figure for the city and the county, but the percentage of residents with less than a high school diploma was high for the county.

After a posting in Ireland, he joined Benjamin Leigh Smith's expedition to the Arctic in 1873.C. V. Owen, Chermside, Sir Herbert Charles (1850‚Äì1929), rev. M. G. M. Jones, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2008. In 1876, Chermside was sent to Ottoman Turkey to work with the Turkish forces after Serbia and Montenegro declared war on the country in July. He was working as a military attach√© to Turkey in 1877, when Russia also declared war. After six months with the Turkish boundary commission, he was appointed Military Vice Consul to Anatolia in July 1879. In 1882, Chermside was promoted to captain, and appointed to the British Army's intelligence staff in Egypt. He was given command of the Egyptian Army's 1st Battalion by the army's Sirdar, Evelyn Wood, and spent four years in Egypt where he took part in the Suakin Expedition of 1884, against Muhammad Ahmad's Mahdist forces and served as governor-general of the Red Sea littoral. He was transferred to Wadi Halfa in October 1886, and spent the next two years repelling Mahdist incursions at Sarras. Although still a captain in the Royal Engineers, Chermside was brevetted major in 1883, lieutenant colonel in 1884 and colonel in 1887. In 1888 he returned to consular duties, spending a year in Kurdistan and seven years as military attach√© to Constantinople. He then was assigned to reorganise the gendarmerie of the newly-autonomous Cretan State, later taking command of the British troops there and serving as military commissioner from 1896. In 1899 Chermside returned to Britain, but was soon sent to South Africa to command the 14th Brigade and the 3rd Division during the Second Boer War. He was back in the United Kingdom to take up command of the Curragh Camp in Ireland from January 1901. In January the following year he was, however, appointed the first post-Federation Governor of Queensland. Governor of Queensland Chermside arrived in Australia in early March 1902, landing in Fremantle. On arrival he stated to local reporters that one of the first matters to which the Australian Commonwealth should attend, was the formation of a military college. He arrived in Brisbane on 24 March 1902 to find Queensland in the grip of a drought and economic recession. He immediately volunteered to forgo 15 per cent of his vice-regal salary, and his sacrifice and approachable nature made him a popular figure amongst the Queensland public. However, concerned by the parliamentary attitude to the role of governor, Chermside decided to resign in 1904, although he delayed the announcement until a political crisis had been dealt with by granting a dissolution of parliament to Premier Sir Arthur Morgan after several failed attempts to establish a stable government. Once he had opened the new parliament, Chermside announced his retirement and left Queensland on 8 October on pre-retirement leave. Family and later life Chermside was the second son of the rector of Wilton, Reverend Richard Seymour Conway Chermside, and his wife, Emily Dawson. His paternal grandfather was the military surgeon Sir Robert Chermside. Chermside was married twice. His first marriage was in 1899 to Geraldine Katherine Webb, daughter of W. F. Webb, of Newstead Abbey, Nottinghamshire. They had a stillborn son on 9 October 1902 in Brisbane, and she childless died in 1910. He remarried in 1920 to Clementine Maria Reuter (daughter of Paul Reuter), and there were no children of the marriage. Chermside retired from the British Army in 1907 at the rank of lieutenant general. He died in London, aged 79, on 24 September 1929. Honours and legacy Chermside was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1886. He was also made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1880, upgraded to Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1897, and Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1899. The Brisbane suburb of Chermside is named after in Chermside's honour.History of Chermside , Our Brisbane (Brisbane City Council).

The railroad has exclusive trackage rights to operates over tracks by the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway, a subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transit System, the regional public transit service provider. Tracks are shared with the San Diego Trolley, another subsidiary of the Metropolitan Transit System, and freight trains are only operated at nights when passenger service is not in operation. The San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad was established in October 1984 and is owned and operated by Genesee & Wyoming, a holding company that operates more than 100 shortline railroads like the SD&IV.; History The San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad was established after March 8, 1984 when RailTex signed an agreement with Metropolitan Transit Development Board (known as the Metropolitan Transit System after 2005) to operate freight service across its San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway. The Metropolitan Transit Development Board (MTDB) had purchased the railroad from the financially struggling Southern Pacific Railroad in August 1979 with plans to convert the Main Line between San Diego and San Ysidro for use by light rail passenger trains and to preserve rail freight services between the Port of San Diego and the Imperial Valley. The MTDB initially signed an agreement with Kyle Railways to operate the line, but a storm in January 1980 damaged the Desert Line (between the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border in Tecate and Plaster City) and the portion of the line between Tijuana and Tecate (owned by another company) which wasn't repaired until January 1983. Just six months after the line reopened, a fire on June 18, 1983 destroyed two bridges on the Desert Line. After the fire, Kyle Railways petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) to abandon the railway, a request that was denied on April 25, 1984. RailTex‚Äôs application to operate freight service along the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway was approved by the ICC on August 9, 1984 and the San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad began operation on October 15, 1984. The new general manager of the SD&IV;, Dick Engle, persuaded local carriers to ship on this line and invited Mexican customers to start receiving shipments. The effort was met with much skepticism and took place more than 10 years before the signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement, that would increase cross-border shipping. On August 1, 1986 the SD&IV; entered into a multi-year agreement with the Mexican Government to provide freight service into Baja California. The work to repair the Desert Line proved challenging. In July 1989, SD&IV; began to repair the burned trestles and collapsed tunnels on the line, but the estimated cost for the work was overwhelming for the railroad and work was halted in the early 1990s. In the early 2000s, investors calling themselves Carrizo Gorge Railway made an offer to make the needed repairs to the Desert Line and pay fees to the SD&IV; and the MTDB in exchange for trackage rights. The deal was approved by all parties in April 2003 and repairs on the line began. In 2000, the Coronado Branch from the 12th Street Junction in National City to Imperial Beach, CA saw its last shipment. Since then, the line has seen no traffic, and the connection to the Main Line has been removed. The Desert Line reopened to freight service in January 2005. By October 2008 the condition of the track had deteriorated to the point that the Carrizo Gorge Railway closed the Desert Line. The Metropolitan Transit System (former MTDB) terminated the deal with Carrizo Gorge Railway in December 2012 and awarded new, long term operating agreement for the Desert Line to the Pacific Imperial Railroad. Earlier that year, on January 1, 2012 the Baja California Railroad assumed control of the line between Tijuana and Tecate which connected SD&IV;'s Main Line in San Diego with the Desert Line. The Pacific Imperial Railroad spent years negotiating a deal with the Baja California Railroad to transport freight over its tracks, which it said delayed its repairs to the Desert Line. The Pacific Imperial Railroad declared bankruptcy in October 2016. The Baja California Railroad purchased the rights to use the Desert Line in March 2017 with an agreement to pay the Metropolitan Transit System a million dollars per year to retain its lease. Baja California Railroad has made no repairs to the line. Current operations The San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad holds the exclusive right to operate freight service over three lines owned by the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway: * The Main Line which runs 15.5 miles from Downtown San Diego south to San Ysidro, and is also used by the Blue Line of the San Diego Trolley. * The La Mesa Branch which runs 16.1 miles east to the city of El Cajon, and is also used by the Orange Line of the San Diego Trolley. * The currently unused Coronado Branch which splits from the Main Line in National City and runs 7.2 miles south to Imperial Beach. The San Diego & Imperial Valley Railroad no longer holds the rights to operate over the San Diego and Arizona Eastern Railway's Desert Line in the Imperial Valley. Freight trains only operate between 2 am and 4 am when San Diego Trolley passenger trains are not in operation. Despite operating on the electrified right-of-way of the San Diego Trolley, the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad uses two NRE 3GS21B diesel-powered genset locomotives instead of electric locomotives, as the rail yards used to marshal the trains have not been electrified. However, genset locomotives are more fuel-efficient and have lower emissions than most traditional diesel locomotives as they are powered by three smaller engines that are turned off and on as needed. The overhead electric wires also prevent the double-stacking of shipping containers on rail cars on the line. The railroad interchanges with the BNSF Railway in San Diego and the Baja California Railroad in San Ysidro and the railroad's main source of traffic is moving railcars between the two other railroads. The primary commodities hauled are petroleum products, agricultural products, and wood pulp. The SD&IY; hauled around 6,500 carloads in 2008.

It is a combination of a middle school (7th and 8th grades) and a high school (9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grades). The school was founded in 1962 and has an enrollment of approximately 2,500 students. The school covers an area of just over 1,700,000 square feet. According to US News, there are 92 full-time teachers. It has been ranked by Newsweek as one of the top 200 high schools in the United States, and it has been a state champion in several sports. However, it has also been featured in the national media for scandals involving homophobia, sexism, and academic dishonesty. History The Corona Del Mar Middle School The school was founded in 1962. In the mid 1970s, the school went through an extensive design process to develop its media center. The Marian Bergeson Aquatic Center, named for state senator Marian Bergeson who was from Newport Beach, opened in May 1990 at a cost of $1.75 million. In March 2015, a performing arts center was finished. The center cost $16 million and seats more than 360 people. Between 2009 and 2014 Corona del Mar was the subject of a series of controversies concerning sexism and homophobia.

Czarist Russia was suspicious of the movement's potential to stir up native unrest and perhaps involve outside powers.The most detailed account of the events of 1904-1906 is available in Russian. Sherstova (1986, 2010), Burhanizm [Burkhanism]), Tomsk State University Press. Chapter 2. The Soviet authorities ultimately suppressed it for fear of its potential to unify Siberian Turkic peoples under a common nationalism. Originally millenarian, charismatic and anti-shamanic, the Burkhanist movement gradually lost most of these qualities‚Äîbecoming increasingly routine, institutionalized (around a hierarchy of oral epic singers) and accommodating itself to the pre-existing Altaian folk religion. It exists today in several revival forms. On the whole, the Burkhanist movement was shown to be a syncretistic phenomenon combining elements of ancient pre-Shamanist, Shamanist, Lamaist and Orthodox Christian beliefs. According to a Professor of Tomsk State University L. Sherstova, it emerged in response to the needs of a new people - the Altai-kizhi or Altaians who sought to distinguish themselves from the neighboring and related tribes and for whom Burkhanism became a religious form of their ethnic identity.Sherstova, Burhanism, Chapter 1, 2, 3. Almost three hundred pages of the book leave little doubt about the validity of this conclusion by Sherstova made in 1977-1986.  Origins of the name  Burkhanism is the usual English- language scholarly name, which has its origin in the Russian academic usage. One of the Burkhanist deities is Ak-Burkhan, or \\"White Burkhan.\\" Burkhan means \\"god\\" or \\"buddha\\" in Mongolic languages, yet Burkhanism is not considered Buddhist, as the term is also used in shamanistic nomenclature. For example, in Mongolian Shamanism, the name of the most sacred mountain, the rumored birthplace and final resting spot of Genghis Khan, is also Burkhan Khaldun.Reinhold Neumann-Hoditz; Dschingis Khan, published by Rowohlt Verlag GmbH; trans. 2005 by Piet de Moor, Ak-Burkhan is only one of a pantheon of deities worshiped by Burkhanists (see list below), but Ak-Burkhan nevertheless provides the name of the religion in Russian, and thence into other languages. The Altaian name for the religion is Ak Jang (\\"White Faith\\"). \\"White\\" refers to its emphasis on the upper world (in the three-world cosmology of the Turkic and Mongolian Tengriism). Alternatively, the name may also allude to Ak Jang's rejection of animal sacrifices in favor of offerings of horse milk or horse- milk alcohol. \\"Jang\\" means authority; faith; custom; law or principle; and canon or rules of ensemble. In more colloquial settings, the term may also be used as a \\"way of doing things\\" and is used in reference to religions as well as political systems.Agnieszka Helmba, 2003. \\"Contemporary Religious life in the republic of Altai: The Interaction of Buddhism and Shamanism\\", Sibirica 3(2):165-182, p.4 Early history Chet Chelpan and his wife Kul In April 1904 Chet Chelpan (or, Chot Chelpanov) and his adopted daughter Chugul Sarok Chandyk reported visions of a rider dressed in white, and riding a white horse. This figure, whom they called Ak-Burkhan (\\"White Burkhan\\"), announced the imminent arrival of the mythical messianic hero Oirat Khan who was actually a real historical figureKhoit-Oirat prince Amursana. The central figure in the research of Burkhanism in the past forty years, however, has demonstrated that Oirot-khan is a mythologized image of the Dzungar past of the people of Altai-kizhi.The most detailed account of what happened in Altai in 1904-1905, including the files of the court trial of Chet Chelpanov and his \\"colleagues\\" is only available in Russian. See: Sherstova, Burhanizm, Tomsk (1986, 2010). Chapter 2.Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010) Chet and Chugul gathered thousands of Altaians for prayer meetings, initially in the Tereng Valley. These were violently suppressed by mobs of Russians, instigated by the Altaian Spiritual Mission, who were afraid of the potential of the competing religion to decrease the Orthodox Christian flock in Altai.Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010), Chapter 2. Chet and Chugul were arrested, Chugul was released, and after a prolonged trial Chet was fully exonerated by court and released in 1906.Chapter 2 of Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010) provides a reconstruction of the court proceedings on the basis of the court files that the author discovered in 1985 in the State Archive of Tomsk Region. The discovery caused a major sensation during the defence of Sherstova's dissertation in the Leningrad branch of the Institute of Ethnography of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. Researcher Andrei A. Znamenski (see article below) compares the Burkanist movement to other indigenous revitalizing movements around the world, such as the Native American Ghost Dance or the Melanesian Cargo Cult. An excruciatingly detailed treatment of the comparisons and comparability of Burkhanism with the Melanesian Cargo Cult, the Mennonites, the Dukhobors of Georgia, the Mariitsy of Nizhnii Novgorod, and many other movements, is provided in Sherstova's dissertation from the 1980s.Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk State University Press (2010), Chapter 4 Znamenski says, the prime motivating factor was Altaians' fear of displacement by Russian colonists, Russification, and subjection to taxation and conscription on the same basis as Russian peasants.See Chapter 2 of Sherstova, Burhanism, Tomsk (1986, 2010) Andrei Vinogradov (thesis linked below) sees Burkhanism as a typical nomadic Turko-Mongolian mobilization pattern‚Äîaiming to link families and clans (seok) into a steppe empire (which in this case never materialized). The Burkhanists' veneration of heroes from oral epics, he says, serves much the same cultural centralizing function as the veneration of other divine heroes such as Gesar, Manas, or Genghis Khan. As such it constitutes a major aspect of Turko-Mongolic religion, distinct from shamanism. After the arrest of Chet and Chugul, Tyryi Akemchi arose to become the most prominent iarlikchi, and helped organize the movement. Having been exposed to Buddhism through his years as a translator in Mongolia, Tyryi added a number of Buddhist trappings to Burkhanist ritual, such as bells. Within a decade, most of the Altaian population had joined the new faith. In 1918 Gregorii Choros-Gurkin and other Altaian leaders declared the formation of something called the \\"Karakorum Regional Committee\\" (Karakorumkaia Okruzhnaia Uprava), with the object of establishing an \\"Oirat Republic\\". This was intended to include not only Altai but also neighboring republics of Tuva and Khakassia. It was forcibly dissolved with arrival of Bolshevik power in 1921. Deities Oirat ‚Äì Messenger of the White Burkhan by Nicholas Roerich. Burkhanism accepts the \\"three worlds\\" of Mongolic and Turkic tradition. (These are the upper, middle, and lower worlds‚Äîin other words heaven, earth, and the underworld.) However, it rejects worship of traditional deities associated with the underworld. In addition, it imports into worship many figures from Altaian oral epic lore, which were not worshipped in the \\"shamanic\\" part of the Altaian religion. Uch Kurbustan--\\"Uch\\" means \\"three,\\" while \\"Kurbustan\\" comes from the Soghdian \\"Khormazta\\" (and thence from the Avestan \\"Ahura Mazda\\"). Thus, a triune God. Though imported from oral epics, Uch Kurbustan is a generalized spirit rather than a hero of stories with a personality. He may be analogous with the Turko-Mongolian High God Tengri (\\"Heaven\\"). Rather than an import from Buddhism, Christianity, or Turkic Islam, this particular trinity is likely to have been inspired by other triune gods and heroes from Turkic culture (sometimes in the form of a god with three sons). Uch Kurbustan is connected with the following three messianic heroes, also from Altaian oral epic lore: :: Oirat or Galden-Oirat--mythological ancestor of the Western Mongols. A conflation / dim historical memory of a number of real-life Western Mongolian leaders from around the seventeenth century including Galdan Tseren. :: Amursana--a legendary Khoit-Oirat chieftain who fled Chinese territory for Russian after the 1756 Qing destruction of Dzungaria. :: Shunu (\\"Wolf\\")--the Altaian version of Asena, the totemic lupine ancestor recognized by various Turkic peoples. The gods of the upper world, or aru tos (\\"pure ancestors\\"), are considered fragments or eminations of Uch Kurbustan. Burkhanism calls these Burkhans. Among them are: :: Ak-Burkhan (\\"White Burkhan)--depicted as an old man with white hair, a white coat, and white headgear, who rides a white horse. Possibly analogous to the Mongolian \\"white old man,\\" Tsagan Ebugen. A symbol of good fortune. :: Jajyk--a formless spirit-mediator, assists with human-divine communication. Vinogradov compares with the Holy Spirit. Altaians distinguished between an Ak-Jajyk (\\"White Jajyk\\") who carried messages to the gods of the upper world, and a Sary-Jajyk (\\"Yellow Jajyk\\") who did the same for gods of the middle world, and is identified with the hearth. :: Umai--the goddess of childbirth and children. Other Turkic lore--but not the Altaian-- makes her the consort of the High God Tengri, and thus a primordial mother figure. :: Ot-ene, the \\"Mother of Fire\\"--worshipped before every sacrifice, but especially during one of the three major Burkhanist festivals Gods of the \\"middle world\\"‚Äîi.e. the familiar spheres of nature and human affairs‚Äîinclude numerous local spirits, such as spirits associated with mountains (taika-eezi) or springs (arzhans), or \\"masters of the game\\". They may also be associated with particular clans (seok). More generalized ones include: :: Altai-eezi, the \\"Master of Altai\\"--a sort of genius loci, suitably adapted for an Altaian national consciousness. :: Ul'gan--a spiritual ancestor of several Altaian clans. Originally a proper name, now generalized. Some sources describe Ul'gan as the creator of the universe in Burkhanist theology; this is probably a misunderstanding. Historically, Burkhanism rejected the traditional gods of the underworld, notably Erlik (Yerlik), its chief. This rejection is closely related to Burkhanism's rejection of Altaian shamanism, and corresponding elevation of oral epic singers (yarlikchi). (By \\"shaman\\" is here meant manjaktu kams, i.e. the \\"costume-wearing\\" specialists who communicate with the underworld gods.) Both rejections are likely to have been inspired by oral epic lore, which regularly features shamans as villains. Practices *Burning juniper (archyn) for blessing, purification, or healing *Home or hilltop altars (kure or murgul), with candles and milk-offerings *Erecting of cairns (oboo) *Recitation / composition / patronage of oral epics *Divination and weather-control *Display of white and yellow ribbons or streamers (from trees or strings, or dangling from the back of one's headgear) *Prayer while standing, with hands raised; or with prostrations *Celebration of festivals: **Shuten or Murgul‚Äîa semiannual (spring and fall) festival dedicated to Uch Kurbustan **Chok or Jajyk Choktor‚Äîa fall festival dedicated to jajyks **Ot Takyr‚Äîdedicated to Ot-Ene Some sources speak of a list of \\"Twenty Commandments\\" for Burkhanism. The evidence for this is sparse. Alcohol and tobacco were proscribed in the early years. Chugul came to be venerated as the main recipient of the original message. This was much less true of Chet, although both were addressed with honorific titles. Notable Burkhanists *Grigory Gurkin, a Soviet landscape artist and leader of the Karakorum Executive Committee. Burkhanism today Russian painter Nicholas Roerich and his wife Helena Roerich passed through Altai in 1926. Nicholas painted Oirat‚ÄîMessenger of the White Burkhan based on his understanding of the movement. (Note that the painting's title apparently gets the theology backward‚Äîit was rather White Burkhan who was the messenger for Oirat.) Followers of Agni Yoga, an esoteric movement founded by the Roerichs, have encouraged a recent revival of interest in Burkhanism among non-Altaians. At the same time they have insisted on a link with Tibetan Buddhism and a veneration of Mount Belukha, elements not found in traditional Burkhanism. A number of Burkhanist revival organizations emerged during the 1990s, mostly as attempts to formulate or preserve an Altaian ethno-nationalist identity. To that end many of them have been persuaded to reconsider earlier Burkhanism's vexed relationship with shamanism and/or Buddhism.

Its primary ingredients are red phosphorus and strong oxidizer, such as potassium chlorate and potassium perchlorate. Sulfur is used to substitute for some or all of the phosphorus to slightly decrease sensitivity and lower costs; calcium carbonate may also be present in small proportions. Commercially, Armstrong's mixture is used in milligram quantities on the paper caps in toy cap guns and in party poppers. An improvised version can be made with match-heads, ground up into a fine powder, and mixed with another fine powder, this time made of the striker strip found on the side of match boxes. It has also been considered a suitable mixture for the primer used in guns after boron carbide has been added, and was used during the Second World War.  Safety considerations  Because of its sensitivity to shock, friction and flame, Armstrong's mixture is an extremely dangerous explosive. Only about 10 mg of it is used per item of consumer fireworks. Depending on composition, conditions and quantity, Armstrong's mixture can explode violently in an enclosed space. Due to extreme sensitivity to friction, mixing dry potassium chlorate and red phosphorus will most likely lead to an explosion. Hence, the ingredients are usually combined in a slurry with water, formed into the final product (for example, single drops onto paper for \\"paper caps\\") and allowed to dry. To decrease sensitivity, oil can be added. Military use Armstrong mixture is easy to make, but it requires too much phosphorus and it is easily oxidized by oxygen from air so it has little worth in military applications, except as homemade gun primer, or improvised explosives. https://books.google.com/books?id=KOY1CgAAQBAJ&pg;=PA74&lpg;=PA74&dq;=armstrong+mixture+ied&source;=bl&ots;=KiqGqjsD4B&sig;=zz3LQ6i8FHXBAyGTek_HuC_prk0&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjJs-L3pPDfAhWa7WEKHTEUAsUQ6AEwBnoECAcQAQ  References  Explosives Pyrotechnic compositions ","title":"Armstrong's mixture"},{"id":"1794056","text":"Elberton is a village in South Gloucestershire, England, in the civil parish of Aust.

He also wrote several novels. Gibbon's work was to have a major impact on the creation of a bilingual, multicultural, national culture. Canadian Mosaic influenced the adoption of the concept of a \\"cultural mosaic\\" in the Canadian government's multiculturalism policies. Additionally, Gibbon had a keen interest in horseback riding in the Canadian Rockies and was the founder of the Trail Riders of the Canadian Rockies. (www.trailridevacations.com) in 1923.

He is noted for his work on African civilizations prior to encounters with Europeans; his major work is The Destruction of Black Civilization (1971/1974). Williams remains a key figure in the Afrocentrist discourse. He asserted the validity of the discredited Black Egyptian hypothesis and that Ancient Egypt was predominantly a black civilization. Early life, migration and education Williams was born on December 22, 1893, in Bennettsville, South Carolina, as the last of five children. His father had been born into slavery and had grown up to gain freedom and voting after the American Civil War. His mother Dorothy Ann Williams worked as a cook, nurse, and evangelist. The family suffered after Democrats regained power in the state legislature in the late 19th century and passed bills disfranchising blacks, as well as imposing racial segregation and white supremacy under Jim Crow. Williams' innate curiosity about racial inequality and cultural struggles, particularly those of African Americans, began as early as his fifth-grade year. Encouraged by a sixth-grade teacher, he sold The Crisis, published by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP); and The Norfolk Journal and Guide, as well as reading them and using their recommended books to direct his studies.Chancellor James Williams, The Destruction of Black Civilization, Chicago: Third World Press, 1987, p. 14 Years later, he was quoted in an interview as saying: > I was very sensitive about the position of black people in the town... I > wanted to know how you explain this great difference. How is it that we were > in such low circumstances as compared to the whites? And when they answered > 'slavery' as the explanation, then I wanted to know where we came from. As part of the Great Migration out of the rural South, the Williams family moved to Washington, DC in 1910. His father hoped for more opportunity there, especially in education, and Williams graduated from Armstrong Technical High School.\\"Chancellor Williams, 98, Dies; Professor of African History\\", The Washington Post, December 12, 1992. p. B04 Williams' mother died in 1925, leaving his father a widower. All their children were grown by then. After working for a while, Williams entered college at Howard University, a historically black college. He earned an undergraduate degree in Education in 1930, followed by a Master's in History in 1935. After completing a doctoral dissertation on the socioeconomic significance of the storefront church movement in the United States since 1920, he was awarded a Ph.D. in sociology by American University in 1949. International studies Williams began his studies abroad in England as a visiting professor to the universities of Oxford and London in 1953 and 1954. In 1956, he did field research in African history at Ghana's University College. At that time, his focus was on African achievements and the many self-ruling civilizations which had arisen and operated on the continent long before the coming of Europeans or East Asians. His last study, completed in 1964, covered 26 countries and more than 100 language groupings. Career In 1935 Williams started as Administrative Principal for the Cheltenham School for Boys in Maryland. Four years later he became a teacher in the Washington, DC public schools. With World War II imminent, he entered the civil service system in the Federal government in 1941, serving as section chief of the Census Bureau, a statistician for War Relocation Board, and an economist in Office of Price Administration. In 1946 he returned to his alma mater Howard University as a social science instructor, teaching until 1952. He transferred to the history department. By the 1960s, he was lecturing and writing about African history from a position of Afrocentrism. He concentrated on African civilizations before the European encounter, and was one of a group of scholars who asserted that Egypt had been a black civilization. He was a scholar at Howard until his retirement in 1966. Afterward he continued his studies and writing. The Destruction of Black Civilization In 1971/1974, Williams published his major work, The Destruction of Black Civilization: Great Issues of a Race Between 4500 B.C. and 2000 A.D., placing it with a white publisher. The following year, the book received an award from the Black Academy of Arts and Letters (BAAL), founded in New York in 1969. Williams worked for years to expand and revise the book before publishing a second edition. He had it published by Chicago's noted Third World Press, a black-owned firm. When published in 1987, the second edition of the book received wide critical acclaim from the African-American community. In 1979, the Twenty-first Century Foundation, based in New York, honored Chancellor Williams with its first Clarence L. Holte International Biennial Prize. Death Williams died of respiratory failure on December 7, 1992, aged 98, at Providence Hospital in Washington, D.C.. He had been a resident of the Washington Center for Aging Services for several years. He was survived by his wife of 65 years, Mattie Williams of Washington, and 14 children; 36 grandchildren; 38 great-grandchildren; and 10 great-great- grandchildren.

Am Faclair Beag - Scottish Gaelic Dictionary. is a style of competitive dancing developed in the Scottish Highlands in the 19th and 20th centuries, in the context of competitions at public events such as the Highland games. It was created from the Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalised with the conventions of ballet',Newton, Michael. A Handbook of the Scottish Gaelic World. Four Courts Press, 2000. p.282 and has been subject to influences from outside the Highlands. Highland dancing is often performed with the accompaniment of Highland bagpipe music, and dancers wear specialised shoes called ghillies. It is now seen at nearly every modern-day Highland games event. Highland dance should not be confused with Scottish country dance, c√®ilidh dancing, or clog dancing, although they may be demonstrated at presentations and present at social events. Basic description of Highland dancing Royal Military College of Canada Scottish highland dance, piper, drummers Highland dancing is a competitive and technical dance form requiring technique, stamina, and strength, and is recognised as a sport by the Sport Council of Scotland. In Highland dancing, the dancers dance on the balls of the feet. Highland dancing is a form of solo step dancing, from which it evolved, but while some forms of step dancing are purely percussive in nature, Highland dancing involves not only a combination of steps but also some integral upper body, arm, and hand movements. Highland dancing should not be confused with Scottish country dancing which is both a social dance (that is, a dance which is danced with a partner or partners) like ballroom dancing, and a formation dance (that is, a dance in which an important element is the pattern of group movement about the dance floor) like square dancing. Some Highland dances do derive from traditional social dances. An example is the Highland Reel, also known as the Foursome Reel, in which groups of four dancers alternate between solo steps facing one another and a figure-of-eight style with intertwining progressive movement. Even so, in competitions, the Highland Reel dancers are judged individually. Most Highland dances are danced solo. =Scottish and Irish dancing= Many non- practitioners think the two Celtic forms are synonymous. While some dance studios teach both, they are two distinct styles, not just in the attire. In comparison to Scottish highland dance, Irish dancers rarely use their arms which are held beside their bodies (rather than raised above the shoulders), legs and feet are frequently crossed (not turned out at 45¬∞), and frequent use of the hard-soled step shoes (compared to ghillies or 'pumps'). There is a greater use of choreography than traditional movements. History Scottish sword dance at the 2005 Bellingham (Washington) Highland Games Modern Highland dancing emerged in the 19th and 20th centuries. It was 'created from the Gaelic folk dance repertoire, but formalised with the conventions of ballet'. It seems that forms of sword dancing were performed by warriors in many parts of Europe in the prehistoric period. Forms of sword dancing are also attested in the late Medieval period. Ritualistic and combative dances that imitated epic deeds and martial skills were a familiar feature in Scottish tradition and folklore. The earliest reference to these dances in Scotland is mentioned in the Scotichronicon which was compiled in Scotland by Walter Bower in the 1440s. The passage regards Alexander III and his second marriage to the French noblewoman Yolande de Dreux at Jedburgh on 14 October 1285. :At the head of this procession were the skilled musicians with many sorts of pipe music including the music of bagpipes, and behind them others splendidly performing a war-dance with intricate weaving in and out. Bringing up the rear was a figure regarding whom it was difficult to decide whether it was a man or an apparition. It seemed to glide like a ghost rather than walk on feet. When it looked as if he was disappearing from everyone's sight, the whole frenzied procession halted, the song died away, the music faded, and the dancing contingent froze suddenly and unexpectedly. In 1573 Scottish mercenaries are said to have performed a Scottish sword dance before the Swedish King, John III, at a banquet held in Stockholm Castle. The dance, 'a natural feature of the festivities', was used as part of a plot to assassinate the King, where the conspirators were able to bare their weapons without arising suspicion. Fortunately for the King, at the decisive moment the agreed signal was never given. 'Sword dance and Highland Dances' were included at a reception for Anne of Denmark at Edinburgh in 1589, and a mixture of sword dance and acrobatics was performed before James VI in 1617 (New Statistical Account of Scotland Edinb. 1845 x, pp. 44‚Äì45) and again for Charles I in 1633, by the Incorporation of Skinners and Glovers of Perth, :his Majesty's chair being set upon the wall next to the Water of Tay whereupon was a floating stage of timber clad about with birks, upon the which for his Majesty's welcome and entry thirteen of our brethren of this calling of Glovers with green caps, silver strings, red ribbons, white shoes and bells upon their legs, shearing rapiers in their hands and all other abulzements, danced our sword dance with many difficult knots and allapallajesse, five being under and five above upon their shoulders, three of them dancing through their feet and about them, drinking wine and breaking glasses. Which (God be praised) was acted and done without hurt or skaith to any. The British central government's policy of cultural suppression against Highland culture culminated in 1747 when the Act of Proscription, which forbade the wearing of kilts by civilian males, went into effect. The Act was repealed in 1782 and in the early 19th century, there was something of a romanticisation of Highland culture (or such as it was imagined to be). This revival, later boosted greatly by Queen Victoria's enthusiasm for it, included the beginnings of the Highland games as we now know them. Highland dancing was an integral part of the Games from the very start of their modern revival, but the selection of dances performed at Games was intentionally narrowed down, mostly for the convenience of judges. Therefore, while the tradition of Highland games seemed at first glance to have fostered and preserved Highland dancing, many older dances got lost because nobody considered them worthwhile to practice, as they were not required for competition. The nature of these displays and competitions also affected the style of the dancing itself. Organisations Most dancing prior to the 1900s was not organised at a national or international level. Judges of competitions were local persons, without specific standards for attire or the steps to the danced. Local Caledonian societies trained young dancers in the way of each society. Slowly consistency of steps was achieved, and dancing-specific organisations were established. Dancers now undergo written examinations and practical assessments to become a teacher, and then further training and testing to become a dancer examiner, then competition judge or adjudicator. =Royal Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (RSOBHD)= Many if not most Highland gatherings worldwide recognise the Royal Scottish Official Board of Highland Dancing (RSOBHD), formed in 1950, as the world governing body of Highland dancing. The 'Royal' title from the Queen of the United Kingdom was approved by 16 November 2019. The RSOBHD standardised dance steps for competition purposes, established rules for competitions and attire, and certifies competitions and instructors. The RSOBHD World Highland Dance Championship has been held annually at the Cowal Highland Gathering since 1934. Today this RSOBHD World Championship is sanctioned by the RSOBHD at three levels: Juvenile, Junior and Adult. Only SOBHD-registered dancers may compete at this RSOBHD championship. The RSOBHD is made up of representatives from many different Highland Dancing bodies and associations from around the world. The Board comprises delegates from the examining bodies (professional teaching associations), affiliated organisations in Australia (Australian Board of Highland Dancing Inc.), Canada (ScotDance Canada), South Africa (Official Board of Highland Dancing (South Africa)), New Zealand (Scot Dance New Zealand), and the United States (Federation of United States Teachers and Adjudicators) which represent the many Highland dance organisations in those countries. The RSOBHD board sanctions Highland dancing championships although does not actually organise any of them. There are non-RSOBHD sanctioned championships run by non-RSOBHD aligned organisations at which registered RSOBHD dancers are forbidden to take part by the RSOBHD. At competitions and championships run by non-RSOBHD organisations, all dancers are welcome, however if they choose to participate they may receive a ban from the RSOBHD. Similarly, dancers not registered with the RSOBHD are forbidden to dance at RSOBHD sanctioned competitions by the RSOBHD. Each year the RSOBHD selects the championship steps to be performed by dancers at championships around the world. An official RSOBHD Highland Dance technique book for dancers and teachers has been published. =Other dancing bodies= Other organisations that qualify Highland dancers, teachers, and judges and hold competitions include: * the Scottish Official Highland Dancing Association (SOHDA) * the New Zealand Academy of Highland and National Dancing * the Victorian Scottish Union (Australia). Such organisations provide a wide syllabus of Highland and national dances and steps within their teaching. =Highland games and competitions= Ceres Highland Games, 2013 At Highland games, the Highland dances were at first danced only by men. Women would take part in social dances, and girls did learn solo dances as part of their general dance classes. In fact, dancing masters would often encourage their most promising students (male or female) to perform solo dances at their end- of-term 'assemblies'. In the late 19th century a young woman named Jenny Douglas (the name of Lorna Mitchell is also suggested) decided to enter a Highland dance competition. As this was not expressly forbidden, she was allowed to enter. Since then the number of females participating in the sport has increased until today in excess of 95% of all dancers are female. There have been several female World Champions crowned at the Cowal Highland Gathering since they began organising the competition in 1948. The first American to win the Adult World Championship was Hugh Bigney, who won the title in 1973. Indeed, the first three Adult World Championships were won by ladies: Nancy Cotter of New Zealand (1948), Margaret Samson (1949 and 1950). This feminisation of folk arts is a common pattern in the process of their 'gentrification', especially after they no longer serve a functional role in a male-centred, warrior culture. Males are still well represented at the world championships. Highland dancing competitions may be held solely or as part of larger events. The small annual Scottish Glen Isla competition is almost inconspicuous on the roadside, and is beside piping events and some heavy game events. Canada's Glengarry Highland Games on the other hand is one of the largest dancing and piping events on the North American calendar. Many of Australia's competitions are held indoors as a solo activity, while Canadian and Scottish competitions are associated with Highland games with a nearby hall available in case of inclement weather. As far as competitions were concerned, until the early 20th century the usual dances seen were the Sword Dance, the Seann Triubhas, the Strathspey and Highland Reel, the Reel of Tulloch, and the Highland Fling. Since then, various other (pre-existing) dances have been added to the competition repertoire. For example, two character dances, 'The sailor's hornpipe' and 'The Irish jig' gained popularity in music hall and vaudeville productions. =Judging= Most judges today evaluate a dancer on three major criteria: timing, technique and interpretation/overall deportment. *Timing concerns the ability of the dancer to follow the rhythm of the music. *Technique has to do with the correct execution of the steps in coordination with the movements of the rest of the body, including head, arm and hand movements. *Artistic interpretation covers that essential element of all dance and artistry in general which cannot be quantified or reduced to any set of rules or specific points, but which does concern the ability of the dancer or performer to convey a sense of feeling, understanding, and appreciation of the art form. * The ability of the dancer including the jumping height and the confidence. The various governing bodies of Highland dancing establish parameters for the dances themselves and scoring systems to grade the dancers and determine their class and progress from one class to another. The scoring system for these competitions begins with each dancer starting with 100 points. For any mistakes, poor execution, etc., results in subtraction of points at the judges discretion. The dancers are then ranked from most to fewest points, and medals and points are given based on the number of dancers in the class. The notion of how dances were to be executed changed dramatically over the years. For instance, doing an early-20th-century-style sword dance in a competition today would get a dancer disqualified nearly immediately. There used to be terrible confusion as to what would be allowed (or prescribed) where, until the RSOBHD came up with a standard that has become acceptable to the majority of competitive dancers. Types of dances Scottish highland dances are generally divided into several types. Categories are more for convenience than strict style: * Highland dances (such as the Highland fling and sword dance) * national dances (such as the Scottish lilt, Flora McDonald's fancy) * character dances (such as the sailor's hornpipe, Irish jig, and the cakewalk) Step dancing and clog dancing also used to regularly be part of some competitions. Steps of each dance are now laid out in national and international syllabus such as the text books of the RSOBHD, United Kingdom Alliance Ltd (UKA), and British Association of Teachers of Dancing (BATD). Each dance comprises a number of steps, which may be numbered or worded. A RSOBHD four-step Highland fling may have the 1st step, 7th, 5th alternative, and finish with the 8th step; or, Shedding, Double shake and rock, Second back-stepping, and Last shedding. =Highland dances= The Highlander developed 'as a necessary preparation for the management of the broad-sword... used in certain dances to exhibit their dexterity';Logan, James. The Scottish Gael p. 440 this included dancing over two naked swords which are laid across each other on the floor, some while a dancer moves nimbly around them. Dextrously placing the feet by a peculiar step in the intervals between crossed blades, as in the Ghillie Callum, has long been linked with dances before a decisive battle or as a victory dance. Legend has it that on the eve of battle the highland chief would call out the clan's best dancers, who would dance the sword dance. If the dancers successfully avoided touching either blade, then it was considered an omen that the next day's battle would be in the clan's favour. A more practical explanation behind the meaning of this dance can be found in the training halls of older styles of fencing, where students of the sword developed their footwork by following geometric patterns of crosses, squares and triangles marked out on the floor. In another version of Scottish sword dancing, the Highlander danced on a targe shield, this has similarities with an ancient Roman exercise in which the man standing on a shield had to defend himself and stay upright while others tried to pull it out from under him. Many of the Highland dances now lost to us were once performed with traditional weapons that included the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe and dirk and the flail, the old Skye dancing song, 'Buailidh mi thu anns a' cheann' (I will strike your head) indicate some form of weapon play to music, 'breaking the head' was the winning blow in cudgelling matches throughout Britain, 'for the moment that blood runs an inch anywhere above the eyebrow, the old gamester to whom it belongs is beaten, and has to stop'. The Highland Dirk Dance, in which the dancer flourishes the weapon, is often linked to the sword dance or dances called 'Mac an Fhorsair', (literally, 'the son of the Forester'), the 'Broad Sword Exercise' or the 'Bruicheath' (battle dance). They are mentioned in a number of sources, usually military, and may have been performed in a variety of different forms, practiced by two performers in a duelling form, or as a solo routine. The tune of Gille Chaluim (anglicised as 'Gillie Callum' and meaning 'the servant of Calum' in Gaelic) has been claimed to date back to Malcolm III of Scotland (1031‚Äì1093) but this claim is certain to have been fabricated to provide false credentials for the antiquity of the dance which is unlikely to have been invented before 1800. According to one tradition, the crossed swords were supposedly placed on the ground before a battle while a soldier danced around the blades. If his feet knocked against the swords, he would be wounded in battle. This may derive from the folklore often surrounding warrior culture, but the style of the dance was changed by the Maclennan brothers of Fairburn. Alt URL One theory about the Highland Fling is that it was a dance of triumph at the end of a battle. Another (no less romantic) theory is that it was performed before battles (like the sword dance), on top of the dancer's shield. The shield would have a spike in the middle, around which the dancer would do the dance that involves flicking of the feet, jumping and careful stepping supposedly to drive evil spirits away. The dancer is confined to one spot and snaps his fingers (which was reduced in recent times to merely holding the hands with the thumb touching the second joint of the middle finger, and the other three fingers extended in the air). Leaving aside the obvious difficulty of dancing around a sharpened spike on a shield, a much more plausible theory is that the Highland Fling is none other than a Foursome Reel with the progressive bits left out - at social gatherings, dancers would 'compete' by showing off the fancy solo steps they could perform, long before formal competitions at highland games had been invented. Another story surrounding the Fling claims that it is meant to imitate a stag; the story goes that a boy who saw a stag was asked to describe it by his father. He lacked the words, so danced instead; the position of the hands resembles the head and antlers of a stag. This urban legend hides the fact that Highlanders used to snap their fingers as they danced. Ruidhle Thulaichean (anglicised as 'The Reel of Tulloch') is supposed to have originated in the churchyard of Tullich, Aberdeenshire, where the congregation awaited the late minister. During the delay they whistled a highland tune and began to improvise a dance. A more gruesome version of the story is that the dance derives from a rough game of football that the inhabitants of Tulloch played with the severed head of an enemy; the Gaelic words to the tune bear this out. The Seann Triubhas means 'old trousers' in Gaelic and is romantically associated with the repeal of the proscription of the kilt by the government after the failed Jacobite Uprising of 1745. However, the dance is considerably younger, with most of the steps performed today dating from the late 19th century. Like other dance traditions, what is called 'Highland dancing' is a hybrid form that has been constantly changing according to contemporary aesthetics and interpretations of the past. While some elements may be centuries old, other elements are much more modern. The vast majority of dances now performed were composed in the 20th century. Highland dances are now supplemented at Highland Games and dance competitions by what are known as National dances. In Highland dancing, every dancer wears a kilt, or tartan trews. Male dancers wear jackets, ties, and 'bonnets' (hats). Female dancers wear blouses with vests or jackets. =National dances= Scottish national dancing at the 2005 Skagit Valley Highland Games. The dancer is wearing the Aboyne dress for females. At Highland games, the National dances include the Scottish Lilt, the Earl of Erroll, Blue Bonnets, Hielan' Laddie, the Scotch Measure, Flora MacDonald's Fancy, Village Maid and Barracks Johnny, which illustrate the history of dancing and other aspects of Scottish culture and history. Some of the National dances were taught by dancing masters in the 19th century and show a balletic influence, while others derive from earlier traditions and were adapted to later tastes. The 'Earl of Erroll', for example, is based on an 18th-century percussive hard shoe footwork, although today's Highland dancers perform it in soft Ghillies. Some of the National dances were preserved and taught by dance masters such as D.G. MacLennan and Flora Buchan, while some were interpreted and reconstructed in the mid-20th century from notes written in Frederick Hill's 1841 manuscript. For National dances, female dancers may wear an 'aboyne' (after the Aboyne Highland Games, where women are not allowed to wear kilts for dancing to this day, and so an outfit was devised as an alternative). =Character dances= The sailor's hornpipe was adapted from an English dance, and is now performed more frequently in Scotland, while the Irish Jig is a humorous caricature of, and tribute to, Irish step dancing (the dancer, in a red and green costume, is an interpretation of an Irish person, gesturing angrily and frowning). If the Irish jig is danced by a woman or girl, it is about either the distressed wife scolding her husband, a woman being tormented by leprechauns, or a washerwoman chasing taunting boys (or children in general) away who have dirtied her washing - the showing of the woman's fist symbolises her wanting to beat up the children, the leprechauns, or the husband. If it is danced by a man or boy, it is the story of Paddy's leather breeches, in which a careless washerwoman has shrunk Paddy's fine leather breeches and he is waving his shillelagh at her in anger and showing his fist, intending to hit her. The Hornpipe mimics a sailor in her majesty's navy doing work aboard ship: hauling rope, sliding on the rollicking deck, and getting his paycheck, and has quite a lot of detail involved that portrays the character (e.g. the dancer does not touch his palms, assumed to be dirty, on his uniform). Performed in a British sailor's uniform, its name derives from the accompanying instrument, the hornpipe. It is performed to tunes such as \\"Crossing the Minch\\" (Pipe Major Donald MacLeod) \\"Jackie Tar\\" (Traditional), and many other both contemporary and traditional tunes. Perhaps one of the most unusual elements of character dance in modern Highland dance competitions is the inclusion of the Cakewalk. The cakewalk is originally a dance performed by black slaves in the southern US imitating, in exaggerated style, the stately courtship ballroom dancing of slave owners. It is unique in competitive Highland Dance as it is the only dance always performed as a duo and is the only dance that originated outside the British Isles. Also unique is the inclusion of fanciful and often outrageous costumes upon which some of the judging of artistry is based. While costume contests do occasionally take place regarding the outfits worn for the other dances, the outfits for those dances are so carefully prescribed (differences are restricted primarily to choice of tartan, colour of jackets or sashes, and choices such as lace sleeves and velvet vests instead of velvet jackets) that costume does not play a significant role in the dance competition or vary much across dancers. In contrast, while the cakewalk may be danced in traditional Scottish attire, dancers involved in the cakewalk often attempt to come up with the most creative duo costume they can, such as Frankenstein and his bride, or Mickey and Minnie Mouse. The cakewalk is generally only danced at very large scale competitions such as national or provincial championships and is generally restricted to the top level of competitive dancers known as 'premier' (formerly 'open'.) The Cakewalk is generally performed to 'Whistling Rufus', written in 1899 by Kerry Mills. The inclusion of the Cakewalk in competitive Highland Dance is credited to dancer, judge and examiner James L. McKenzie who introduced the dance to Scotland from the United States. =Hebridean dances= The 'Hebridean dances' originated in the Hebrides and are now danced by Highland dancers. It is unknown when these dances originated, or who created them, but 19th century dance master Ewen MacLachlan taught them in the Western Isles during the mid-1800s. They are Aberdonian Lassie, Blue Bonnets, Over the Water to Charlie, Tulloch Gorm, Flowers of Edinburgh, Scotch Measure (Twa'Some) and First of August. Many other dances from the Hebrides have been partially or fully lost. More relaxed than the other dances, they have also been more influenced by step-dancing. =List of dances = The following list is by no means exhaustive. Those marked with an asterisk ('*') are regularly observed at RSOBHD competitions. Highland dances National and (soft-shoe) step dances Character dances *Cakewalk *Irish jig * *Sailor's hornpipe * Dress Each dancing association (RSOBHD, SOHDA, VSU, etc.) sets the standard of dress. Items such as lipstick, earrings, face glitter, and the wearing of rings may be prohibited depending on the organisation. The following is an indication of what is commonly observed. Attire has also changed over the decades. Ruffles around the neck and wrist-cuffs were once quite common. Long-sleeved kilt jackets give way to short-sleeved jackets depending on the climate. A dancer's skill level or sex may also determine the attire (under RSOBHD rules, Premier-level dancers have more prescribed items than pre-Premier dancers). =Highland dance attire= Girls dressed for Highland dancing Laddie dancing in tartan trews Men wear traditional Scottish hat called a Balmoral and a doublet of coloured velvet or cloth. If the jacket is in the 'Prince Charlie' style then it is to be accompanied by a shirt and bow tie with a waistcoat, cummerbund or belt. Jackets in the 'Montrose' style are to be worn with a white lace jabot and, optionally, sleeve ruffles. A kilt and matching tartan hose are worn with a sporran, or tartan trews can be worn instead of a kilt for the Seann Truibhas. Females wear a tartan kilt with a velvet jacket, worn with a lace insert, or a sleeveless velvet vest worn over a white blouse. The jacket or vest may be black or coloured with a gold or silver braid and buttons down the front. Matching tartan hose are also worn. =National dance attire= Males wear the same dress for National dances as Highland dances, however tartan trews may be worn instead of a kilt. Females may wear a white dress with a tartan plaid over the right shoulder. Alternatively they may wear the more popular 'aboyne'. The aboyne dress consists of a velvet bodice over a white blouse with a tartan or tartan-like knee-length skirt and white underskirts. A tartan 'plaid' or 'plaidie' is worn with a Scottish-themed brooch pinned to the shoulder and waist. They may also wear skin coloured tights or white socks. =Sailor's hornpipe attire= Both sexes wear the same outfit for the sailor's hornpipe in either navy or white. A v-neck jumper is worn over a square-necked white vest with bell bottom trousers. A navy or light blue collar (with three stripes) and a sailor's regulation cap are also worn. There used to be horizontal creases in the trousers. =Irish jig attire= Irish jig shoes are black, green or red and, though they closely resemble ghillies, are hard-soled shoes with heels. Males wear a Paddy hat, red or green muffler and tailcoat, brown or khaki breeches and a waistcoat in a contrasting colour to that of the tailcoat. A shillelagh, a kind of Irish cudgel, is carried for twirling. Females may wear one of several combinations of red, green and white blouses, dresses, skirts and cummerbunds. Dancers also wear white underskirts and a white apron.

An enemy of Sherlock Holmes, he first appears in the 1903 short story \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\". Holmes once described him as \\"the second most dangerous man in London,\\" the most dangerous being Professor Moriarty, Moran's employer. Fictional character biography According to Sherlock Holmes's index of criminal biographies, Sebastian Moran was born in London in 1840, the son of Sir Augustus Moran, CB, sometime Minister to Persia. He was educated at Eton College and the University of Oxford before embarking upon a military career. Formerly of the 1st Bangalore Pioneers (Madras), he served in the Jowaki Expedition of 1877‚Äì1878 and in the Second Anglo-Afghan War, seeing action at the Battle of Char Asiab, 6 October 1879 (for which he was mentioned in despatches); the Battle of Sherpur, 23 December 1879; and at Kabul. A devoted sportsman and highly skilled shot, he was author of the books Heavy Game of the Western Himalayas in 1881 and Three Months in the Jungle in 1884, and reportedly once \\"crawled down a drain after a wounded man-eating tiger\\". Although there was no open scandal after his turning to crime, he was obliged to retire from the army and return to London. Outwardly respectable, with an address in Conduit Street, Mayfair, and membership of the (fictional) Anglo-Indian Club, the Tankerville Club and The Bagatelle Card Club, he was nevertheless recruited by Professor Moriarty, and served as his chief of staff. Ultimately he is used solely for assassinations that required his peculiar skill with the rifle; Holmes mentions the killing of a Mrs. Stuart in 1887 which he suspects (but cannot prove) Moran was involved in. In \\"The Final Problem\\" (set in 1891), Moran escaped incrimination, and followed the Professor to Reichenbach Falls, where Moran attempted to kill Holmes by rolling boulders upon him. Thereafter Moran earned a living in London by playing cards at several clubs. When one of the other players, Ronald Adair, noticed that Moran won by cheating and threatened to expose him, Moran murdered Adair with a silenced air rifle that fired revolver bullets. Dr. Watson and the returned Holmes having taken the case, Moran attempted to kill Holmes by firing the air rifle from a vacant house opposite the detective's residence. Holmes having anticipated this, Moran shot a wax effigy of the detective, while Holmes, Watson, and Inspector Lestrade all hid nearby to seize the would-be assassin. In \\"The Adventure of the Illustrious Client\\", Holmes mentions Moran as still alive (in September 1902). Moran is also mentioned in \\"His Last Bow\\" as an example of Holmes's many adversaries who have futilely sworn revenge against him. Colonel Sebastian Moran was also the villain in Doyle's Sherlock Holmes play The Crown Diamond, written in the early 1900s but not performed until 1921. When this play was adapted as the short story \\"The Adventure of the Mazarin Stone\\", Moran was replaced by 'Count Negretto Sylvius'.  Other appearances  = Literature = *Moran appears in the Flashman Papers novella Flashman and the Tiger, and as a boy in the novel Flash for Freedom!, by George MacDonald Fraser. (Fraser gives him a birth-date of 1834, and the full name \\"John Sebastian 'Tiger Jack' Moran\\".) In Flashman and the Tiger, on the retreat from Isandlwhana to Rorke's Drift, Moran demonstrates amazing speed and unearthly accuracy with a Remington Model 1875 .44 revolver. *In Sherlock Holmes's War of the Worlds, the Artilleryman from The War of the Worlds is said to be Moran's son. *In Martin Powell's short story \\"Sherlock Holmes in the Lost World\\" (collected in Gaslight Grimoire) Moran attempts to rebuild Moriarty's criminal empire after the latter's death, but is killed by Professor Challenger. *Moran appears in several works by Kim Newman: **As a vampire in the alternate history horror novel Anno Dracula. **In the short story \\"The Man Who Got Off The Ghost Train\\", Richard Jeperson is dispatched to investigate a decades-old mystery in which Colonel Moran played a brief but memorable part. **In the book Professor Moriarty: The Hound of the D'Urbervilles, a collection of related stories, Moran is deliberately portrayed as a foil to Watson, whose relationship and history with Moriarty parallels that of Watson's with Holmes, from their first meeting in \\"A Volume in Vermilion\\" to their final parting in \\"The Problem of the Final Adventure\\". Moran, nicknamed 'Basher', is portrayed as debauched, violent and as something of an adrenaline junkie but also as educated and not entirely without morals. As the title suggests, the stories feature guest appearances by many of Moriarty and Moran's fictional contemporaries. Around half the stories in the collection had previously been published separately: \\"A Shambles in Belgravia\\" in BBC Online's Sherlock Holmes anthology, \\"A Volume in Vermilion\\" in Sherlock Holmes' Mystery Magazine, \\"The Red Planet League\\" in Gaslight Grimoire, and \\"The Adventure of the Six Maledictions\\" in Gaslight Arcanum. *Moran appears in two stories in the anthology Shadows Over Baker Street: \\"A Study in Emerald\\" by Neil Gaiman (reprinted in Gaiman's collection Fragile Things) and \\"Tiger! Tiger!\\" by Elizabeth Bear. In \\"A Study in Emerald\\", a reimagining of A Study in Scarlet set in an alternate world, Moran takes on the role of narrator usually given to Dr Watson, as he takes up residence in Baker Street with a consulting detective ‚Äì although from then on events turn out very differently. *In David McDaniel's Man from U.N.C.L.E. novels, Moran is identified as having founded an organization known as THRUSH after Professor Moriarty's death at Reichenbach. *Moran appears as a minor character in Alan Moore's comic book series The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume I, as an underling of Moriarty, where they are both agents of the British Secret Service, assigned to create a criminal empire through which the government can control the criminal underworld. After Moriarty is promoted to the Directorship of the Service, Moran maintains control of the underworld on his behalf. *In T. S. Eliot's poem \\"Gus: The Theatre Cat\\" (which became one of the songs in Cats), it is said that Gus once played a man-eating Tiger pursued by an Indian Colonel down a drain. *In John Gardner's novel The Return of Moriarty, Moran is stated to have taken temporary charge of Moriarty's organization while The Professor was away from London following the events at the Reichenbach Falls (which are explained as never having happened as Watson [and later Holmes] described them). The events leading up to and of \\"The Empty House\\" are told from Moran's point of view. Naturally, The Professor is not pleased to hear of Moran's actions and arrest, and has Moran poisoned while in police custody to prevent him from talking. *He appears briefly in Michael Kurland's novel Death by Gaslight as an associate of Professor Moriarty, and in a much larger role in the later The Empress of India, where he enlists Moriarty's help in retrieving a golden statue. *He appears in David Stuart Davies's The Veiled Detective, a novel based mainly around a retelling of part of A Study in Scarlet, in which Dr. Watson is planted in Holmes's life by Professor Moriarty in order to monitor and report back on him. *In the anthology My Sherlock Holmes edited by Michael Kurland, a collection of stories told from the viewpoints of minor characters from canon, A Study in Orange by Peter Tremayne recounts how Moran partly outwitted Holmes on a case. Moran also appeared in Tremayne's The Affray at the Kildare Street Club in The Mammoth Book of New Sherlock Holmes Adventures where he was foiled in a petty theft by a young Holmes. *He appears as a minor character in the clockpunk/steampunk novel Whitechapel Gods by S.M.

In 1910, he unsuccessfully attempts to kill Sherlock Holmes. In the end, he was killed by Sherlock's brother Sherrinford who was possessed by a demon from another dimension.Stories from Elsewhere: The Woman Who Lived Two Lives *Moran appears in the book The File on Colonel Moran ‚Äì Volume One: The Lure of Moriarty by Vernon Mealor, published by The Clyvedon Press, the first part being a first person account by the colonel of his pursuit of Holmes and his arrest for the Adair murder, the other two stories being accounts of his early days with Moriarty, presented as stories related by a reporter who conducted interviews with him. *Moran appears as the main villain in the 2012 Sherlockian pastiche ‚ÄúCharlie Marlow y la rata gigante de Sumatra‚Äù (Charlie Marlow and the Giant Rat of Sumatra), a novel by Spanish author Alberto L√≥pez Aroca, set in Mist Island (an alternative name for Skull Island). This novel also features many other fictional characters from Arthur Conan Doyle works, as Fred Porlock and Parker (two Moriarty Gang Members), Joseph Conrad‚Äôs Charles Marlow, Rudyard Kipling‚Äôs Peachey Taliaferro Carnehan, and an ancestor of C.C. Beck‚Äôs Doctor Sivana (misspelled ‚ÄúSivane‚Äù in the novel), among others. *Moran appears in the 2014 novel Moriarty by Anthony Horowitz. He is only revealed to be Moran at the end of the book but has a few appearances throughout. *In Sherlock Holmes and the Servants of Hell by Paul Kane, it is revealed that Moriarty was able to escape his demise by using an incantation to transfer himself into the realm of the Cenobites, where he is transformed into the 'Engineer' of the Cenobites, intending to mount a new assault on Earth, eventually recruiting Moran for this purpose. In a confrontation in Hell, it is revealed that he is responsible for the death of Mary Watson, Watson's wife, as he attempted to poison Watson during Holmes' three-year absence but Mary took the poison by accident. During the confrontation in Hell, Holmes is able to make a deal with the master Cenobites to transform himself into a Cenobite to oppose Moriarty's forces while Watson is aided by Mary's spirit, with Mary destroying the transformed Moran to avenge her own death before her husband and friend defeat Moriarty and return to Earth. *In The Thinking Engine by James Lovegrove, set in 1895, Moran is revealed to have escaped prison, and Holmes and Watson realize that he is acting as an agent to an initially-unknown employer to advise certain criminals in the city on how to commit particularly elaborate crimes. They soon determine that he is working for Moriarty- who survived the confrontation at Reichenbach in a hideously crippled state- and Watson manages to capture Moran in a final chase after Moriarty's role is exposed, with Watson shooting Moran in the left arm and shooting off his right index finger in the subsequent stand-off. *In Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel, Stanford argues that Moran, 'a fierce big man' was inspired by John O'Connor (North Kildare MP) , a Fenian leader.Stanford Jane, Moriarty Unmasked: Conan Doyle and an Anglo-Irish Quarrel, Jane Stanford, 2017, pps. 46‚Äì48. *Donald Serrell Thomas's 2013 novel Death on a Pale Horse features Moran's elder brother Rawdon \\"Randy\\" Moran as its chief antagonist. Holmes's biographical report conflates the histories of the two Moran brothers, crediting them both with distinguished actions in the British Army in Afghanistan and India, co-authorship of the two memoirs on hunting, and shared service to Professor Moriarty. In his report to the British government on the elder Moran, dated shortly after the events of \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\", Holmes also mentions that Sebastian was executed by hanging for Ronald Adair's murder. = Television = *Moran was played by Eric Maturin in the BBC television series Sherlock Holmes (1951), the first television series adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. *Moran's younger brother Jasper appears in the novel Young Sherlock: The Mystery of the Manor House written by Gerald Frow, and its Granada television adaptation. *Colonel Moran appears in two episodes of the 1983 television series The Baker Street Boys, played by Michael Godley. *Moran appears in the Granada television adaptation of \\"The Adventure of the Empty House\\" opposite Jeremy Brett as Holmes, here played by Patrick Allen. In this Moran is shown in flashback attempting to shoot Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls, rather than rolling rocks upon him as in the original story. **A similar event occurs with Moran in the Soviet television version of \\"The Adventure of the Final Problem\\". *In the CBS television series Elementary, which takes places in modern-day New York City, Holmes (Jonny Lee Miller) captures a serial killer with the alias \\"M.\\", who Holmes believes responsible for the murder of Holmes's lover Irene Adler. In captivity, \\"M.\\" reveals his real name to be Sebastian Moran (Vinnie Jones), a former Royal Marine now employed as an assassin, providing Holmes with the first clue to the existence of \\"Moriarty\\". Moran admits to his other crimes, but convinces Holmes that he is innocent of Adler's murder, and, realizing that Moriarty set him up to be captured, willingly goes to prison in the hope that Holmes will track down Moriarty. Holmes is later tricked into showing Moran a coded message in prison, informing him that his sister will be killed next unless he kills himself. Moran slams his head against the mirror in his cell, and is last reported to be in critical condition. *\\"The Empty Hearse\\", the first episode of series 3 of the BBC television series Sherlock, features Lord Moran, a member of the House of Lords, as a mole for North Korea. He is ordered to carry out the bombing of the Palace of Westminster, but his plan is ultimately stopped by Holmes. The actor who portrayed this version of the character is unknown. *\\"A Study in Sherlock\\", one of several episodes of the Canadian historical drama Murdoch Mysteries to feature Arthur Conan Doyle, also features a character named Sebastian Moran who is implied to be Doyle's inspiration for the villain of \\"The Empty House\\". = Film = *Moran appears in three films starring Arthur Wontner as Sherlock Holmes. In The Sleeping Cardinal (1931) he is played by Louis Goodrich. In The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes (1935) he appears very briefly played by Wilfrid Caithness. He then appears in a larger role as Moriarty's right-hand man in Silver Blaze (a.k.a. Murder at the Baskervilles) (1937), played by Arthur Goullet. *Moran appears as a jewel thief and the main villain in the 1946 Basil Rathbone film Terror by Night, played by Alan Mowbray. *In the film Without a Clue, Moran (portrayed by Tim Killick) appears as Moriarty's tall bodyguard and has a scar down one side of his face. His weapon of choice is a switchblade which he uses to stab and cut his victims, and he is also a highly skilled knife thrower. *Moran, played by Paul Anderson, appears in the 2011 film Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. Moran was renowned as one of the best marksmen in the British army, but following a \\"dishonourable discharge\\" (a mistaken reference to the procedure for expelling enlisted soldiers, rather than officers) he became a mercenary in the employ of Professor Moriarty, on whose orders Moran undertakes several assassinations throughout the film. He remains at large after the end of the film. = Radio = *In the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Colonel Moran was played by Rex Evans in \\"The Tankerville Club Scandal\\" (1946), and by Barry Thomson in \\"The Adventure of London Tower\\" (1948). *Colonel Moran was played by Noel Johnson in a radio dramatisation of \\"The Empty House\\" which aired in 1961 on the BBC Light Programme. *Frederick Treves played Moran in the BBC Radio Sherlock Holmes adaptations of \\"The Final Problem\\" (1992) and \\"The Empty House\\" (1993). *Steve Manning voiced Colonel Moran in the 2009 Imagination Theatre radio drama \\"The Return of Sherlock Holmes\\", adapted from the short stories \\"The Final Problem\\" and \\"The Empty House\\".

Since that group's dissolution in the late 1970s, Keenan has released a number of solo and collaborative recordings, and continues to tour both as a soloist, and with singer/guitarist Tommy O'Sullivan. Biography = The early years = Paddy Keenan was born in Trim, County Meath in 1950 to John Keenan (an Irish Traveller) and Mary Bravender Keenan (of settled descent). Though the Keenan family abandoned the Traveling lifestyle early in Paddy's life, he spent much of his youth contending with discrimination, including regular physical confrontations. His father and grandfather both played the pipes, and his father spent many nights playing along with piper Johnny Doran. When he was about six years old, Keenan was introduced to the tin whistle by his brother Johnny (a notable Irish banjo player), and began playing the pipes around age nine. Recognizing his son's interest, John Keenan tutored Paddy, along with neighbouring children, including Finbar Furey and Davy Spillane. During this period, the Keenan household was an ongoing session. At age fourteen, Keenan played his first major concert at the Gaiety Theatre, Dublin, followed by a few years of touring with a number of musicians, including his father, as \\"The Pavees.\\" At seventeen, Keenan went to England in an attempt to escape the strictness of his father's household, and ended up busking around London, singing and playing blues and rock songs on guitar for most of the following four years. After nearly selling or throwing away his pipes several times, he discovered in 1971 that busking with them was far more lucrative than with the guitar, and resumed his piping career. = Early groups and The Bothy Band = Returning to Dublin, Keenan played regularly with his brothers and father at folk clubs and various venues around Ireland. In 1975, he was part of a band called 'Seachtar', from the Irish word for 'seven people.' This band was the genesis of The Bothy Band, of which Keenan was a mainstay from its inception to its demise in 1979. = A solo career = Keenan's first (and eponymous) solo album appeared in 1975, and he also duetted with fiddler Paddy Glackin on the 1978 album Doublin. He subsequently recorded a second solo album for Gael- Linn Records, Poirt An Phiobaire, in 1983. After rejecting the chance to join Moving Hearts in the early 1980s, Keenan's musical career went into abeyance. However, in the 1990s he relocated to North America, rediscovered his musical talents and in 1997 issued Na Keen Affair, recorded at Dadyeen Studios, St. Johns, Newfoundland, Canada. Supporting musicians include Tommy Peoples and Patrick Moran on fiddle, Arty McGlynn and Tommy O'Sullivan on guitar, as well as Newfoundland musicians. This led to an ongoing musical relationship with the London-born, Kerry-based guitarist Tommy O'Sullivan. Together, the pair issued The Long Grazing Acre in 2001, touring jointly to promote the album. According to their respective websites, Keenan and O'Sullivan have continued to perform together periodically since 2001. The 2008 documentary Damb√©: The Mali Project tells the story of his 3000-mile cross-cultural musical adventure with Liam √ì Maonla√≠ (Hothouse Flowers) and friends, and features performances from the Festival au D√©sert.Damb√©: The Mali Project Official website Pipes and Pipemakers Upon demonstrating and aptitude for, and interest in the pipes around the age of ten, John Keenan got Paddy a full set of pipes by John Clarks. Six years later, in 1966, Keenan's father bought him a full set made by the Crowley family, which (with the addition of a Leo Rowsome chanter), Paddy played until 2000. At that point, Keenan received a full set from maker Dave Williams of Grimsby, England, who died a few years later in a car accident. This set, which was a copy of the previous Crowley set, remains Keenan's primary instrument.

Landmarks Shepperdine was well known as the location of a pub on the banks of the Severn, known as the Windbound (once formally known as the New Inn). The Windbound closed in 2004 and became a residential home, which itself closed. The building was demolished in 2015. Shepperdine has a Church of England chapel of ease (small church) dedicated to St Mary next to Manor Farm in Nupdown Road. It was rebuilt after a fire in 1897, and contains several Grade II listed tombs. The ecclesiastical parish is Oldbury on Severn, whose cleric is the vicar of Thornbury and that small town was its medieval (ancient) parish; it is centred south-east.

Nuclear power plant project In the summer 2009 the German power company E.ON started to acquire land from local farmers with the intention of constructing of a 3,300 megawatt nuclear power station on the banks of the River Severn. They formed a joint venture with German power company RWE. The two companies bought the existing Oldbury and Wylfa Magnox Nuclear Power Stations from the NDA for the sum of ¬£500 million. RWE and Eon formed a company called Horizon to proceed with the development. In March 2012 it was announced that they had decided not to go ahead with the construction, but in 2014 Horizon bought the former pub, the Windbound, for demolition to make way for the new power station.

In the folk tradition, it consists of a simple, even rhythm, sung using kuchi shoka as \\"do ko do ko.\\" This is often called \\"straight ji\\" in English to differentiate from other ji patterns. A common variation is to \\"swing\\" the ji, called the \\"dongo\\" pattern after the kuchi shoka (sung as \\"don go don go\\"). When playing dongo, the upbeat (the \\"go\\") is not evenly spaced between the downbeats, but is instead played toward the \\"back of the beat,\\" a common practice in jazz music. Generally the first note of each pair is twice as long as the second, giving the pattern a triplet feel. In English, the dongo pattern is often simply called the swing ji because of the history of the swing rhythm in North American jazz. Other common types of ji include the horse-beat ji (\\"don dogo don dogo\\"; in Western drum notation:\\"1.&12.&a3.;&a4.;&a;\\") and the matsuri, or festival, ji (\\"DON doko don DON, DON doko don DON\\"). The ji is usually played throughout a song to hold the other instruments together rhythmically. For this reason, the ji is prevalent when playing taiko, which is a Japanese art form in which the drums are the central instrument. When playing taiko, the ji is often simple and loud, played most often on a smaller rope-tied drum (the \\"shime-daiko\\") which is high-pitched and has a sharp attack, making it easily audible over the rumble of the larger taikos. It can by played on almost any instrument, however. For example, it is commonly played on the largest drum (the \\"≈çdaiko\\"), either as backing for the other instruments, or to aid a soloist playing on the other head of the drum.

It is located on a peninsula at the confluence of the rivers Wye and Severn, where the Severn Bridge ends and the smaller secondary bridge for the River Wye begins, both bridges carrying the M48 motorway between England and Wales though the motorway is not directly accessible from the village. The tidal range on this stretch of water is the highest in the UK. Before the construction of the bridge it was a ferry port from where the Aust Ferry operated until 1966.The population in 2011 was 764.https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/reports/localarea?compare=E34002757 History Before the 9th century, the Beachley peninsula and the mouth of the Wye were part of the Welsh kingdom of Gwent. A small chapel was founded at what was then the southernmost point of the peninsula - now a tidal island known as Chapel Rock - traditionally in the 4th century by Tecla, a princess of Gwynedd who retired there as a hermit before being murdered by raiders from the sea. A chapel dedicated to St Twrog, perhaps containing a navigation light, was later built on the rock but was ruined before the 18th century.Mysteries of Wales (sic) View of Chapel Rock, showing chapel ruins Offa's Dyke, built by the Mercians in the 8th century, cuts off the peninsula to the north. In 956, Beachley was part of lands granted by King Edwy to Bath Abbey. According to historians interpreting the writings of Walter Map, it is likely that Beachley was the site of an unprecedented meeting around 1056 between the unchallenged ruler of Wales, Gruffydd ap Llywelyn, and the king of England, Edward the Confessor, to establish each one's areas of control.Miranda Aldhouse-Green and Ray Howell (eds.), Gwent In Prehistory and Early History: The Gwent County History Vol.1, 2004, The crossing of the Severn estuary between Beachley and Aust was probably in use from antiquity and was long the chief route between southern England and southern Wales. It was recorded in the 12th century when the de Clares, lords of Tidenham, granted quittance of the passage to the monks of Tintern, and was evidently much used in 1405 when great numbers of the English and Welsh were said to resort to the nearby chapel of St Twrog. The manor of Tidenham retained rights over the passage, and received rents from the parishes of Aust and Beachley, until the 19th century.Ancient ferries Beachley was the site of fighting in the Civil War. It was garrisoned by Royalists under Sir John Wintour, but was overrun in October 1644 by Parliamentary forces under Col. Edward Massey. St John's Church was built in 1833 by Bristol architects Foster and Okely. Its cost was borne largely by James Jenkins, the owner of Beachley Manor.Churches of Britain In the 1850s the rector was Rev. G.W. Bridges, an early photographer. =Army Apprentices College= Entrance to Beachley Barracks In 1915, during World War I, the government requisitioned a large area of land at Beachley and constructed National Shipyard No.2. However, the war ended before production had begun. Instead, in 1924 it was decided to establish a British Army Apprentices School (which in 1966 was renamed as an Army Apprentices College) at Beachley to ensure a core of qualified soldiers with excellent technical education combined with first class military training as potential NCOs and officers mainly for the specialist corps Royal Engineers, REME Plant Operator mechanics and RAOC. The AAC closed in 1994, and the army converted the site to an infantry barracks. After the recent reorganisation of the Army, \\"Future Army Structures\\" and \\"Future Infantry Structures\\" this is now the permanent home of the First Battalion The Rifles. Amenities The old ferry slipway is now used by the Severn Area Rescue Association (SARA), whose Beachley lifeboat station is next to the slipway.

Written by Salom√©, Dani√®le Thompson, and J√©r√¥me Tonnerre, the film is about a mummy's spirit that possesses a woman (Sophie Marceau) in the Paris museum. Loosely based on the 1927 horror novel Belph√©gor by Arthur Bern√®de, this film is the third dramatized adaptation, following the first film in 1927, and a TV miniseries in 1965. Belphegor, Phantom of the Louvre was filmed on location at the Mus√©e du Louvre, the first feature film to be shot in part inside the world-famous museum. Plot A rare collection of artifacts from an archeological dig in Egypt are brought to the famous Mus√©e du Louvre in Paris. While experts are using a laser scanning device to determine the age of a sarcophagus, a spirit escapes and makes its way into the museum's electrical system. Museum curator Faussier (Jean- Francois Balmer) brings in noted Egyptologist, Glenda Spencer (Julie Christie), to examine the findings, and she announces that the mummy inside the coffin was actually the evil spirit Belphegor. Meanwhile, Lisa (Sophie Marceau), a young woman who lives across the street from the museum, follows her runaway cat into the Louvre after closing time. She accidentally receives an electrical shock that transfers the stray spirit into her body. Soon Lisa is disguising herself as Belphegor and making off with the rare Egyptian treasures on display at the museum, convinced that they are rightfully hers. When Belphegor proves more than a match for the Louvre's security forces, renowned detective Verlac (Michel Serrault) is brought out of retirement to find out why the museum's Egyptian collection has been shrinking.

Justin Felix from DVD Talk gave the film a mixed two and a half out of five stars, writing, \\"Belphegor: Phantom of the Louvre is modestly entertaining, despite some very familiar plot elements and so-so CGI work.\\" Chris Parry from eFilmCritic awarded the film two out of five stars, panning the film's acting, special effects, screenplay, and familiar premise. Steve Barton from Dread Central rated the film two and a half out of five stars, writing, \\"For all that it has going for it in the acting department, Belph√©gor Phantom of the Louvre comes up on the short side of the fence nearly everywhere else.

They were founded in 1313 and recognised 1344. They use the Rule of Saint Benedict and are a member of the Benedictine Confederation, where they are also known as the Olivetan Congregation, but are distinguished from the Benedictines in their habit and organisation. They use the post-nominals 'OSB Oliv'. History =Foundation= Monte Oliveto Maggiore The Olivetans were founded in 1313 by Bernardo Tolomei (born Giovanni Tolomei) along with two of his friends from the noble families of Siena, Patrizio Patrizi and Ambrogio Piccolomini. They initially lived as hermits in the \\"savage waste of Accona\\". The building of the monastery here began with the approbation of the foundation charter by Guido Tarlati, bishop of Arezzo (26 March 1319).Almond, Joseph Cuthbert. \\"Olivetans.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 10 April 2019 The name \\"Olivetan\\" comes from the name of the order's original hermitage, called Monte Oliveto in honour of Christ's Passion. The monastery later became known as \\"Monte Oliveto Maggiore\\" (\\"greater\\") to distinguish it from successive foundations at Florence, San Gimignano, Naples and elsewhere. It is still the mother house of the order or congregation. After the arrival of a number of new followers, the nascent community adopted the Rule of St. Benedict and was recognised by Pope Clement VI in 1344.\\"St Bernard Tolomei & The Congregation of Monte Oliveto\\", The Benedictine Monks, UK In 1408 Gregory XII gave them the extinct monastery of St. Justina at Padua, which they occupied until the institution there of the Benedictine reform. Today Unlike many other Benedictine congregations, the Olivetans have a centralized structure, supervised by the abbot general at Monte Oliveto Maggiore.\\"Monastic life\\", Abbey of Monte Oliveto Maggiore Olivetan Benedictines wear a white habit. The Olivetan monks run Bec Abbey in France, which was left in ruins in 1792 by the French Revolution. In 1948 Olivetans from the Monastery of Our Lady of Holy Hope at Mesnil-Saint-Loup and the Monastery of the Virgin Mary at Cormeilles-en-Parisis re-established the monastery at Bec. In 1955, Benedictine monks from St. Benedict's Abbey in Wisconsin took over the former Trappist monastery of Our Lady of Guadalupe Abbey in Pecos, New Mexico. In 1985, the monastery became part of the Olivetan congregation. The abbey offers retreats and spiritual direction.Our Lady of Guadalupe Abbey, Pecos, New Mexico The Monastery of Christ Our Saviour was founded in 1980 in the village of Turvey Abbey, Bedfordshire. Adjacent to the monastery is the Priory of Our Lady of Peace of Olivetan Benedictine nuns. The monastery and the priory share worship services. While the monks have no outside apostolate, guests are welcome. The priory is not open to the public, but the chapel is open and visitors are welcome.Priory of Our Lady of Peace, Turvey Abbey, Bedfordshire The Congregation also maintain abbeys and prioral churches in Italy, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Israel, Korea, Mexico, Guatemala and Brazil. In 1960 they formed the Olivetan Congregation within the Benedictine Confederation. Olivetan nuns and sisters Olivetan nuns are distinguished from the sisters in that the nuns focus primarily on the Divine Office according to the Rule of Saint Benedict, while the sisters engage in outside apostolates such as religious education or pastoral care, and therefore follow a modified form of the rule. In 1874, Benedictine sisters from the Convent of Maria Rickenbach in the Canton of Unterwalden, Switzerland, arrived as teachers in Maryville, Missouri. Shortly thereafter some of the sisters were sent to Arkansas. In 1893 the Arkansas community affiliated with the Olivetans. In 1900, they opened St. Bernard's Hospital in Jonesboro.\\"History\\", Olivetan Benedictine Sisters In popular culture The Prophecy of St. Malachy is a supposed list of 112 popes beginning in 1143 with Pope Celestine II and continuing apparently to the end of time. It was allegedly discovered around 1595 by Benedictine monk Arnold de Wyon, who attributes it to the 12th century Malachy of Armagh. Each pope is identified with a short cryptic motto. The next to last pope has the motto Gloria oliu√¶ (Glory of the olive). After the election of Joseph Ratzinger to the papacy in 2005, proponents of the prophecy connected him to the entry for the next to last pope: Ratzinger chose the name Benedict; one of the Benedictine congregations is the Olivetans, thus, Gloria oliu√¶. However, there is no particular connection between the Olivetan Order and Pope Benedict XVI. In 1139, Malachy visited Rome, stopping at Clairvaux Abbey both on the way and on his return. His contemporary, Bernard of Clairvaux wrote a vita of St. Malachy, providing many interesting anecdotes, but does not mention any prophecy. Reputable church historians since the 18th century have considered \\"The Prophecy of St. Malachy\\" a forgery,Sieczkowski, Cavan. \\"St. Malachy Last Pope Prophecy: What Theologians Think About 12th-Century Prediction\\", HuffPost.com, Dec 06, 2017 most likely written around 1590. Most scholars consider the document a 16th-century elaborate hoax, bearing similarities to a 1557 history of the popes by Onofrio Panvinio, including mistakes. Thomas Groome, of Boston College said, \\"...the 'Prophecies of St. Malachy' are a grand old fun tale that have about as much reliability as the morning horoscope\\".

The New York Times backed his account of the jump and said that Brodie practiced for the leap by making shorter jumps from other bridges and ships' masts, and that it was witnessed by two reporters. He leaped into the East River, feet first, and emerged uninjured, though with pain on his right side. He was jailed after the jump. The Times described Brodie as a \\"newsboy and long-distance pedestrian\\" who jumped from the bridge to win a $200 bet, equal to $ today. In other accounts he is described as a bookmaker and gambler. A Bowery storekeeper named Isaac Meyers claimed that he encouraged Brodie to jump off the Brooklyn bridge after Brodie said that he wanted to be famous. Steve Brodie's bar on the Bowery circa 1886 Another account holds that Moritz Herzber, a liquor dealer, offered to back a saloon for Brodie if he made the jump and lived. If true, he would have been the first person to have jumped off the bridge and survived, but his claim was disputed. It was subsequently claimed that a dummy was thrown from the bridge and that Brodie fell out of a row boat. After the jump, Brodie opened a saloon at 114 Bowery near Grand Street, which also became a museum for his bridge- jumping stunt. Among the decorations was an affidavit from the boat captain who claimed to have pulled him from the water. He became an actor capitalizing on his reputation, appearing in the vaudeville musicals Mad Money and On the Bowery, and opened a saloon in Buffalo, New York. Brodie died in San Antonio, Texas, in 1901. The cause of death has been variously described as diabetes and tuberculosis. =Controversy= Doubt whether Brodie actually made the claimed jump arose immediately and has lingered to this day. Brodie, who was unemployed and aware of the publicity generated by Odlum's fatal jump, bragged to his pals on the Bowery that he would take the jump. Wagers were made for and against, but Brodie never announced when he would make the attempt. The Brooklyn Eagle reported in 1930 that a retired police sergeant and friend of Brodie, Thomas K. Hastings, said that Brodie had told him that he didn't make the leap and never said he did. In his book The Great Bridge, historian David McCullough said that he probably did not make the jump. McCullough said that it was commonly believed by skeptics that a dummy was dropped from the bridge, and that Brodie merely swam out from shore and surfaced beside a passing barge. The NYPD said in 1986, the 100th anniversary of the supposed jump, that two or three people jump from the bridge every year and some live. Only one month after Brodie's jump, Larry Donovan jumped from an even higher point of the bridge, making him the first confirmed survivor of a Brooklyn Bridge leap. In popular culture Lithograph promoting On the Bowery Brodie became a popular symbol of the Bowery and appeared personally in musical shows, and his character was used many times in film depictions of old New York. He starred in a three-act play titled On the Bowery by Robert Neilson Stephens, which opened in 1894. A facsimile of Brodie's saloon was the setting for the second act, and Brodie sang a song, \\"My Poil is a Bowery Goil\\". Valerie Bergere played Blanche Livingstone, the girl he rescues and then falls in love with. The play culminated with Brodie jumping off the bridge.On the Bowery, Internet Broadway Database Retrieved December 27, 2013 George Raft portrayed Brodie in the 1933 movie The Bowery which presents a fictional account of Brodie's dive. Years later, an actor named John Stevenson used Brodie's name for his movie stage name.Soden, Garrett (2005). Defying Gravity: Land Divers, Roller Coasters, Gravity Bums, and the Human Obsession With Falling, New York: W. W. Norton & Company; In the 1946 noir film The Dark Corner (starring Lucille Ball and Mark Stevens), a Taxi Driver, when asked about William Bendix's gangster character falling to his death, said he \\"[n]ever saw anyone ever pull a Brodie and bounce.\\" In 1949, Warner Brothers released the Merrie Melodies cartoon Bowery Bugs, in which Bugs Bunny tells an old man the story of the Steve Brodie jump (in typical Looney Tunes fashion, of course; in the episode Brodie's name is spelled \\"BRODY\\" on a plaque on the bridge in the spot where \\"Brody\\" supposedly jumped from). It's never mentioned in the cartoon whether or not Bugs was trying to sell the old man the Brooklyn Bridge or simply the story of \\"Brody's\\" jump. At the end, Bugs says to the old man, \\"And that's why Steve Brody jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge. Anything more you want to know?\\" and the old man replies, \\"Nope. That's enough, son. I'll buy it\\". Bugs then breaks the fourth wall with a wink as the old man starts counting money into Bugs's hand. The disastrous 1965 Broadway musical Kelly (musical) was inspired by Brodie and climaxes with the lead character Hop Kelly completing the dive. The phrase \\"taken a Brody\\" is used in Thomas Pynchon's 1963 novel V.: \\"And next day she would read in the paper where Esther Harvitz, twenty-two, honors graduate of CCNY, had taken a Brody off some bridge, overpass or high building.\\"Pynchon, Thomas.

It is a type of soft tissue sarcoma. The name \\"synovial sarcoma\\" was coined early in the 20th century, as some researchers thought that the microscopic similarity of some tumors to synovium, and its propensity to arise adjacent to joints, indicated a synovial origin; however, the actual cells from which the tumor develops are unknown and not necessarily synovial. Primary synovial sarcomas are most common in the soft tissue near the large joints of the arm and leg but have been documented in most human tissues and organs, including the brain, prostate, and heart. Synovial sarcoma occurs in about 1-2 per 1,000,000 people a year. They occur most commonly in the third decade of life, with males being affected more often than females (ratio around 1.2:1). Signs and symptoms Synovial sarcoma usually presents with an otherwise asymptomatic swelling or mass, although general symptoms related to malignancies can be reported such as fatigue. Diagnosis The diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18) chromosomal translocation. =Histopathology= Two cell types can be seen microscopically in synovial sarcoma. One fibrous type, known as a spindle or sarcomatous cell, is relatively small and uniform, and found in sheets. The other is epithelial in appearance. Classical synovial sarcoma has a biphasic appearance with both types present. Synovial sarcoma can also appear to be poorly differentiated or to be monophasic fibrous, consisting only of sheets of spindle cells. Some authorities state that, extremely rarely, there can be a monophasic epithelial form which causes difficulty in differential diagnosis. Depending on the site, there is similarity to biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, although the genetic findings are distinctive. Like other soft tissue sarcomas, there is no universal grading system for reporting histopathology results. In Europe, the Trojani or French system is gaining in popularity while the NCI grading system is more common in the United States. The Trojani system scores the sample, depending on tumour differentiation, mitotic index, and tumour necrosis, between 0 and 6 and then converts this into a grade of between 1 and 3, with 1 representing a less aggressive tumour. The NCI system is also a three-grade one, but takes a number of other factors into account. Immunohistochemistry (IHC): SS18-fusion specific antibody and SSX-CT antibody are highly sensitive and specific for synovial sarcoma and when used together may obviate the need for molecular testing in most cases.Zaborowski M, Vargas AC, Pulvers J, et al. When used together SS18-SSX fusion-specific and SSX C-terminus immunohistochemistry are highly specific and sensitive for the diagnosis of synovial sarcoma and can replace FISH or molecular testing in most cases [published online ahead of print, 2020 Jun 19]. Histopathology. 2020;10.1111/his.14190. doi:10.1111/his.14190Baranov E, McBride MJ, Bellizzi AM, et al. A Novel SS18-SSX Fusion-specific Antibody for the Diagnosis of Synovial Sarcoma. Am J Surg Pathol. 2020;44(7):922-933. doi:10.1097/PAS.0000000000001447 Cytokeratin is typically expressed, at least focally. TLE1, BCL2 and CD99 may be positive but lack specificity. =Molecular biology= Most, and perhaps all, cases of synovial sarcoma are associated with a reciprocal translocation t(x;18)(p11.2;q11.2). There is some debate about whether the molecular observation itself is definitive of synovial sarcoma. The diagnosis of synovial sarcoma is typically made based on histology and is confirmed by the presence of t(X;18). This translocation event between the SS18 gene on chromosome 18 and one of 3 SSX genes (SSX1, SSX2 and SSX4) on chromosome X causes the presence of an SS18-SSX fusion gene. The resulting fusion protein brings together the transcriptional activating domain of SS18 and the transcriptional repressor domains of SSX. It also incorporates into the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, a well known tumor suppressor. SS18-SSX is thought to underlie synovial sarcoma pathogenesis through dysregulation of gene expression. There is some association between the SS18-SSX1 or SS18-SSX2 fusion type and both tumour morphology and five- year survival. Treatment Treatment is usually multimodal, involving surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy: *Surgery, to remove the tumor and a safety margin of healthy tissue. This is the mainstay of synovial sarcoma treatment and is curative in approximately 20‚Äì70% of patients, depending on the particular study being quoted. *Conventional chemotherapy, (for example, doxorubicin hydrochloride and ifosfamide), to reduce the number of remaining microscopic metastases. The benefit of chemotherapy in synovial sarcoma to overall survival remains unclear, although a recent study has shown that survival of patients with advanced, poorly differentiated disease marginally improves with doxorubicin/ifosfamide treatment. *Radiotherapy to reduce the chance of local recurrence. The benefit of radiotherapy in this disease is less clear than for chemotherapy.

Among his most important literary works we find his novel Juyungo (1942; English translation by Susan Hill and Jonathan Tittler 1983), his poetry collection Earth, Sound and Drum (1953), and the short story collection called Entundada (1971); His most defining feature as a writer was the incorporation of the elements of afro-American culture, enriching his literary vocabulary with its jargon, its elasticity and its rhythm. Ortiz's thematic focused around the identity of the afro-American within Latin-American society and its struggle towards social freedom, against oppression and secular exploitation. His body of work also preserves and rescues the elements of the psychology, idiosyncrasy, customs and slang of the afro-American culture. Facing the subject of the difference between classes, Ortiz used his characters to personalize and flesh out these political themes into very human and realistic stories. A specific point he touches in the novel Juyungo, for example, is the relationship of the Black and Mestizo races (personified by Lastre's descendant and the Mestizo Diaz). Outside of the aspects of social commentary, Ortiz's prose is celebrated and acclaimed as possessing singular beauty and elegance.

With this album, the band settled on what would, from then on, be their primary lineup: vocalist Elizabeth Fraser, guitarist Robin Guthrie and bass guitarist Simon Raymonde. This new lineup also coincided with the development of the ethereal sound associated with the band's music. The album reached number 29 on the UK Albums Chart, becoming the band's first UK Top 40 album, and charted for eight weeks. It also became one of the band's most critically successful releases, although the band considered it underdeveloped.  Background and music  The album was recorded from August to September 1984 at Palladium Studios, Edinburgh and Rooster, West London. Raymonde alluded to it being rushed and unfinished, while Guthrie referred to it as \\"an abortion\\"Select, October 1990 and to the period in which it was made as \\"arty-farty pre-Raphaelite\\". Nonetheless, as Raymonde observed, \\"It seems to be the one that people like the best and it's probably sold the best\\".  Reception and release  Treasure is considered by many fans to be the band's finest work, and has received critical acclaim. Pitchfork wrote, \\"Cocteau Twins' third album was titled simply enough. Treasure was an adjective for the endlessly inventive melodic lines you'd find buried in these songs, and a verb for what you'd do with them for years to come\\", and noted that the record signaled the start of the Cocteau Twins' \\"signature ethereality\\". Ned Raggett of AllMusic complimented its \\"accomplished variety\\", saying, \\"Treasure lives up to its title and then some as a thorough and complete triumph\\". BBC Online wrote, \\"Treasure was where the Cocteau Twins first got it 100 percent right\\". Melody Maker described the album as \\"true brilliance\\" and stated that the band were \\"the voice of God\\". In March 2018, the album was repressed on 180g vinyl using new masters created from high definition files transferred from the original analogue tapes. =Legacy and accolades= Jennifer Makowsky of PopMatters included the album on the \\"12 Essential Alternative Rock Albums from the 1980s\\" list and wrote that the album stood the test of time and paved the way for bands like Sigur R√≥s and Beach House. Jeff Terich of Treblezine placed the album on his list of best dream pop albums, stating: \\"In contrast to the band's more abrasive post- punk albums that arrived earlier, Treasure is an exercise in making beauty seem alien, and making alienation seem sublime, for that matter\\". Slant Magazine listed the album at No. 74 on its list of the best albums of the 1980s, while NME named Treasure the 37th best album of 1984. Pitchfork listed Treasure as the 98th best album of the 1980s. Paste magazine's Josh Jackson listed the album at No. 38 on his list of \\"The 50 Best Post-Punk Albums\\", describing it as \\"the first full realization of the band's ethereal pop sound\\". PopMatters included it in their list of the \\"12 Essential 1980s Alternative Rock Albums\\" saying, \\"Fraser's ability to deliver her nonsensical lyrics with the diaphanous touch of a moth or with the muscle of a ravenous lion is astonishing\\". Jennifer Makowsky concluded that \\"Treasure is an aptly titled album\\". The album was included in the 2008 edition of 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.

As duke of Schleswig he was Adolph I. (, , ) (1401 - 4 December 1459), as Adolph I Duke of Schleswig (, formerly ), and as Adolph VIII Count of Holstein- Rendsburg, was the mightiest vassal of the Danish realm. Background Adolph descended from a branch of the House of Schauenburg, who had for centuries been counts of Holstein, and as such, vassals of the Holy Roman Empire. His great-grandfather Gerhard the Great, having also been a Regent of the Kingdom of Denmark, had received the Duchy of S√∏nderjylland from the Danish crown as a hereditary fief. It had been lost for the Schauenburgs between 1330 and 1375, with Queen Margaret I of Denmark restricting the regained ducal power in 1386, and again from 1414 to 1440. Count Adolph's parents were Gerhard VI, Count of Holstein-Rendsburg and Catherine Elisabeth of Brunswick-L√ºneburg. Adolph was only three years old when his father was killed in action against the Ditmarsians in the Battle at Hamme near Heide (today's Schleswig-Holstein), on 4 August 1404. Adolph was educated at the court of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg at Hohenzollern Castle.Elisabeth, -1404-, Hertuginde af S√∏nderjylland (Dansk biografisk Lexikon)Paul Zimmermann, \\"Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie\\". 1884 Career Adolph's elder brother Henry IV succeeded their father. As Duke of Schleswig, he was under the tutelage of the Danish crown due to his minority until 1414. However, then the crown denied Henry's claim to dukedom. Henry and his mother and brothers stood together and fought for his claim. During the Danish-Holstein-Hanseatic war Henry was killed in action beleaguering Flensburg on 28 May 1427. Adolph and his younger brother Gerhard VII then succeeded Henry as Counts of Holstein-Rendsburg, continuing their efforts to receive the Duchy of Schleswig. However, Gerhard died in 1433 in Emmerich upon Rhine. In July 1435 Adolph and the Danish King Eric of Pomerania concluded the second Treaty of Vordingborg at Vordingborg Castle, confirming Adolph's de facto holdings in Schleswig duchy. In 1439, the new Danish King Christopher III acquired the loyalty of Adolph by granting him the entire Duchy of Schleswig as a hereditary Danish fief. Adolph's lands were located in both sides of the border between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire. The current branch of Danish royal house became extinct in 1448 with the death of Christopher III of Denmark. Adolph was a cognatic descendant of King Eric V of Denmark, whose mother Queen Dowager Margaret Sambiria had obtained a papal confirmation of the right of also female descendancy of Christopher I of Denmark to succeed to the throne of Denmark. Adolph was also the cognatic descendant of King Abel of Denmark through his daughter Sophia; Christopher III was the last descendant of King Abel's sons. The throne was offered by the Rigsr√•d to Adolph, who as Duke of Schleswig, was the vassal with the biggest holdings in the Danish realm. Adolph, by that time old and childless, declined and supported the candidacy of his own nephew the Count of Oldenburg who became Christian I of Denmark. Adolph was married on 5 March 1435, to Margaret of H√∂llenstein of the German noble family of Hohnstein. They had one son, who died young. In 1459 Adolph died and left no descendants to inherit. His sisters were the late Helvig (Hedwig), who was married with Dietrich, Count of Oldenburg and had left children, and the elderly Ingeborg of Holstein, Abbess of Vadstena, who lived as a nun and was both unmarried and childless. His brother Gerhard had mixed twins, with the son Henry drowned still young and the daughter Catherine a nun in Preetz Priory. There were several claimants to Holstein-Rendsburg and Schleswig, since then the Schauenburgs still continued to rule the County of Holstein-Pinneberg in the male line, and several extinct lines of the family, counts of different parts of Holstein, had left female offspring and their cognatic heirs. Adolph's branch was not genealogically very senior.

It is the fourth largest river gorge in the Eastern United States. The gorge is cut into the Cumberland Plateau as the river winds its way into Alabama from Tennessee. The Tennessee River Gorge is home to endangered species like the mountain skullcap. Many archaeological sites have been discovered in the gorge that show that people have been dwelling in the canyon for at least 10,000 years. Prior to the completion of Hales Bar Dam in 1913 and the subsequent raising of the water-level, the stretch of the Tennessee River flowing through the Gorge was notorious for its navigational hazards, whirlpools, eddies, shoals, and one huge rock. Beginning with Williams' Island and the sandbars on either side of it, these obstructions included Tumbling Shoals, the Holston Rock, the Kettle, the Suck Shoals, the Deadman's Eddy, the Pot, the Skillet, the Pan, and, finally, the ten-mile Narrows, ending with Hale's Bar. Of these, the Kettle, or the Suck as it is better known, at the mouth of Suck Creek is the most infamous, drawing notice from Thomas Jefferson, who had never been anywhere near the area, and lending its name to the entire stretch of treacherous river, which is also known locally by the name Cash Canyon. As of 2018, 17,000 acres of land in the gorge out of 27,000 acres sought for preservation have been purchased or otherwise secured for conservation by the Tennessee River Gorge Trust, a non-profit conservation trust founded in 1981.

It was developed by Racdym and published by Atlus. Many reviewers compared its style to that of the Mario Kart series. An enhanced port, Snowboard Kids Plus, was released in Japan in January 1999 for the PlayStation. Gameplay In addition to the usual gameplay of a snowboarding game, Snowboard Kids adds \\"Shots\\" (special weapons used to attack players) and items which can help the player, hinder other players, or both. The game has nine main courses. Although many of the courses are snowy mountains, some are courses that would be unorthodox for snowboarding in the real world. Such courses include an amusement park, a desert, a vast valley, a dark highway, and a Japanese village during the cherry blossom festival. Each track has a unique shape, containing various obstacles, hazards, and short-cuts. There are two item slots, allowing each player to carry a shooting item and support item (such as a rock, or invisibility) at the same time. Players are required to pay 100 gold in order to collect an item during a race. Gold can be obtained either through performing tricks or collecting coins scattered across the course. All courses also require players to race down the hill for multiple laps. At the bottom of the hill, the player needs to pass through the lift gate to be transported back to the top of the hill, and cannot be attacked by other players in this transition. =Playable characters= Snowboard Kids features six playable characters: Slash, Nancy, Jam, Linda, Tommy, and Shinobin, the last being the only unlockable character in the game, becoming available after the player completes all nine tracks. The characters have three aspects which affect their racing style: speed, which determines the straight line speed of the character; corner, which determines how quickly the character is able to turn; and trick, which determines the hangtime characters get while jumping, allowing for tricks to be executed to earn the player coins. Development The game was showcased at the Tokyo Game Show held on September 5-7, 1997. Reception The game was generally well received by critics. IGN gave the game an 8 out of 10 score, favorably comparing the game to the Mario Kart series, referring to the game as \\"a solid title that incorporates the graphic and gameplay styles of Mario Kart into a snowboarding environment. The result is a satisfyingly cute snow racer that's sure to please gamers more interested in a simplistic shreddin' experience than a realistic one.\\" Nintendo Life gave the game a 7 out of 10 rating, concluding that the game had \\"bold, colourful graphics, tons of charm, memorable tunes and, most importantly, tight gameplay, Snowboard Kids is worthy of a place in anyone‚Äôs collection. Atlus‚Äôs first foray into the world of snowboarding on the Nintendo 64 may not present a particularly lengthy challenge or deep experience, but it can always be relied upon to provide a quick blast of fun now and then, alone or with friends.\\" Next Generation reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"In the final analysis, Snowboard Kids is an entertaining title that, despite its lack of originality, does most things right. Considering the infrequency of truly compelling N64 titles, gamers could do worse than spending some time on the slopes with Snowboard Kids.\\" Sequels The game would lead to several future releases in the series. In 1999, a sequel, Snowboard Kids 2, was released for the Nintendo 64. The series lay dormant for seven years, until a new entry in the series, SBK: Snowboard Kids, was released for the Nintendo DS in 2005.

According to Ancient Greek culture, planets were believed to have influences and provide guidance to humans, as they lived their lives. The planet's nature determines if it is Benefic or not, based on whether it helps the affected areas, with money problems for example. A planet with negative attributes would be classified as Malefic, from the Greek term kakopoios which literally means ‚Äúbad-doer‚Äù. Planets are naturally Malefic or Benefic, however, a planet can change because of the astrological signs they house. Changes are dependent upon, and specific to each individual person. Horoscopes and their Zodiac sign indicate the goal of the planet for each person, as to which will be Malefic and which will be Benefic. This system is also used in Vedic astrology. Examples Some examples of Benefic planets are: * Jupiter is considered to provide abundance and good fortune. It demonstrates these tendencies when a person is forgiving, kind, ethical, and overall a good person. * Venus provides comfort and social graces. This is especially shown when dealing with others and interacting with others in a diplomatic way, being kind and taking into account other people's feelings. * The Moon has benefic tendencies, which are determined by the amount of light she gives (depends on the phase of the moon). It becomes Benefic during the New Moon to Full Moon phase. This is because there is a greater amount of light given, which is considered good and healthy. * Mercury is evenhanded and fair. It encourages people to behave equitably. However, the planet can adapt into a Malefic Planet. It can do this through its ability to take on attributes of other planets it associates itself with. A planet is deemed Malefic because it can interfere with the positive effects of a Benefic planet. A Malefic planet often cause delay, destruction and uncertainty. Some examples of Malefic planets include: * Saturn represents the misery and burdens that we as humans have to carry. * The Sun is Malefic due to its strong influence over those things we need to decrease in order to increase our personal spiritual growth. * Mars causes mischief, relationship tension, accidents and other negative affects.  Vedic Astrology  Vedic Astrology can be defined as the science explains in details the planetary movements and positions in respect to day and time. In existence for thousands of years, Vedic astrology is the same as Indian Vedic astrology. It has many things in common with Western astrology. There are twelve Zodiac signs present, which have the ability to influence your decisions, thus helping to determine your future. It also follows the movement of the planets as to whether you receive positive influence or negative influences through them, much like in Ancient Greek mythology. Vedic astrology was documented by the Maharishi (Wise Men) and appears throughout Hindu scripture.  Rahu and Ketu  A big difference between Western and Vedic astrology is the existence of Rahu and Ketu. Western astrology is just the nine planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, Uranus and Pluto (even though it is not longer considered a planet) along with The Moon and The Sun. Appearing in Vedic astrology, along with the same celestial objects in Western astrology, is Rahu and Ketu. Their existence, according to Hindu mythology, is a result of a demon being decapitated. Rahu (the head) became immortal while Ketu (the remaining body) was left as a mortal. They became enemies of the sun and the moon, and it is said that Rahu and Ketu swallowed up The Sun and The Moon, thus causing an eclipse. Rahu and Ketu are considered to be invisible planets but really represent the North lunar node (pole) and the South lunar node.  In Relationships with Astrological Signs  The Astrological Sign Symbols There are twelve signs in the Zodiac, each one belonging to certain Malefic and Benefic planets. Not only that, but some planets are neutral in the signs. The planets hold different meanings depending on your personal astrological signs. For example, someone could have Mars as a Benefic planet due to their Zodiac sign but someone else could have Mars as a Malefic planet due to their Zodiac sign. Here is a list of astrological signs and their types of planets : = Aries Ascendant = Benefic planets- The Sun, Jupiter and The Moon Malefic planets ‚Äì Mercury Neutral planets ‚Äì Saturn, Venus and Mars = Taurus Ascendant = Benefic planets ‚Äì Saturn, Venus and Mercury.

A follow-up to Kemcos original Top Gear game, it features a championship mode where a single player must complete six seasons of two to four races, as well as a multiplayer mode where two players may compete against each other via a split-screen display. The game's tracks combine both road and off-road surfaces and can be played in different weather conditions, including night, fog, rain, and snow. Players may customize their car with different tire grips and adjust its suspension stiffness and steering sensitivity. An option that allows players to custom paint their cars is also included. Top Gear Rally was conceived after Boss created a non-interactive demonstration running on Silicon Graphics workstations that featured two- and four-wheel drive vehicles racing through different driving conditions. The game features a physics engine with a functioning suspension that reacts to a variety of challenging terrain. Although the cars featured in the game are fictitious, they were modeled after real vehicles. The game received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the technical aspects of its graphics and its fluid yet challenging gameplay. Criticism was targeted at its weak sound effects and limited multiplayer mode. In 1999, the game was ported to Microsoft Windows as Boss Rally. Gameplay The player, in second position, drifts through a road curve while trying to overtake an opponent. Top Gear Rally is a racing game where players must drive cars on tracks that combine both road and off-road surfaces. Tracks are relatively open and may include hidden shortcuts, and each of them can be played in sunny, nocturnal, foggy, rainy, or snowy conditions. Before starting a race, players can custom paint their car, select different tire grips, adjust the suspension stiffness and steering sensitivity, and choose either a manual or automatic transmission. The acceleration, top speed, drivetrain, and engine placement of each car are different. These factors, along with the road and weather conditions, affect the handling of each car significantly. For example, the engine placement often determines how a car lands after a jump, while four- wheel drive cars have more grip on gravel tracks. Although cars can be damaged, their performance is not affected. The game comprises four gameplay modes: Championship, Arcade, Time Attack, and Practice. In Championship mode, a single player must complete six seasons of two to four races in different weather conditions, with each race requiring the player to overtake 19 opponents controlled by the game's artificial intelligence. Points are awarded based on the rank the player finishes a race. If the required quantity is not met, the player will not be able to progress to the next season. As the player progresses through the Championship mode, new cars and tracks are unlocked. A total of nine cars and four tracks are included in the game, in addition to two bonus cars and a hidden track that can be unlocked by completing the game and finishing first in every race during the last season of the Championship mode. A mirror variant for each track can also be unlocked, which reverses curves left-to-right and right-to-left. The Arcade, Time Attack, and Practice modes are single-race challenges on tracks that have been unlocked in the game's Championship mode. Arcade involves the player racing against an opponent while reaching designated checkpoints under a time limit, whereas Time Attack requires the player to race against a ghost car that represents their best time. In Practice mode, the player can freely drive a car on a track without opponents or time restrictions. Both the Arcade and Practice modes support up to two players. A horizontal split-screen display is used if two players compete against each other. The game features three driving perspectives for the player to choose from. These include an exterior and interior view with or without a rearview mirror. The game is compatible with both the Rumble Pak and Controller Pak. The latter is used to save custom paint jobs and the player's progress through the Championship mode. Development and release Top Gear Rally was developed by Boss Game Studios as a follow-up to Kemcos original Top Gear game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Development of the game started in July 1996, after the company created a non-interactive demonstration that featured two- and four- wheel drive vehicles racing through different driving conditions. The demonstration was enough to convince Nintendo of America that Boss could develop a game for the Nintendo 64 console. Although the demonstration was developed on Silicon Graphics workstations that were more powerful than the Nintendo 64 and included vehicles that were modeled in 15,000 polygons, Boss was confident that their finished game would be very similar, stating that technical aspects such as lighting effects could be ported easily. Although Sega Rally Championship was a major inspiration, the company considered Top Gear Rally a game that would feel and look very different. Boss spent between two and three months developing the programming tools for the game, including a physics engine with a functioning suspension that reacts to a variety of challenging terrain. According to lead designer Colin Gordon, \\"The physics are very accurate, and the shocks, brakes, and handling are specific to each car. No car [drives] like another\\". The tracks were designed in such a way as to ensure that the game's distance fog and scenery rendering were not apparent. A level editor, which would let players create their own tracks, and a Battle Mode similar to the combat-based races of Super Mario Kart, were originally planned to be included in the game. The developers opted to limit the multiplayer mode to two players because simultaneous four-player racing would have forced them to compromise on either the draw distance or their target frame rate of 30 frames per second. Although Boss did not have licenses to use automobile manufacturing brands, the cars featured in the game were modeled after real vehicles such as the Ford Escort, the Toyota Celica, the Toyota Supra, and the Porsche 911. The soundtrack was composed by Barry Leitch and produced in 8-bit samples. Top Gear Rally was originally intended to be released in the first quarter of 1997. In January 1997, it was reported that nearly 50% of the game was complete. By May 1997, around 80% of the game was complete. Top Gear Rally was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta in June 1997, where attendees could play a demo. In North America, the game was published by Midway Games and released in October 1997. In Europe, Top Gear Rally was released in November 1997. The Japanese version, which was released on December 5, 1997, includes a built-in EEPROM in the Nintendo 64 Game Pak that allows players to save their progress without the need of a Controller Pak. It also includes a new title sequence and car models that were more popular in Japan, such as the F150 and the Mitsubishi Pajero. Reception Top Gear Rally received generally positive reviews from critics, who considered it superior to MRC: Multi-Racing Championship‚Äîanother Nintendo 64 game that shares similar features. Next Generation described Top Gear Rally as \\"a fabulous off-road racer with tons of bonus cars, courses, and replay value to make it a keeper\\", stating that the game \\"exceeds everything good Sega Rally came up with, then adds some twists of its own.\\" Game Informer remarked that the game feels more natural than MRC and that its tracks are longer and more fun. In a less positive review, GameSpot felt that the game was too realistic and may frustrate players, but acknowledged that it \\"demands respect for its graphics, physics, and track design.\\" Edge concluded that Top Gear Rally \\"certainly has its moments, but they are scattered too few and far between to create a continuously thrilling white-knuckle ride.\\" The game was widely praised for its clean and crisp graphics. GameSpot remarked that \\"backgrounds and foregrounds seamlessly blend in an effect that's nearly photorealistic\\" and that the game's high frame rate \\"creates an impressive illusion of speed.\\" Graphically, N64 Magazine stated that Top Gear Rally rivals most arcade games of the time, while GamePro noted details such as the reflective mud in the game's jungle track and the fact that cars can be damaged. However, some reviewers said that the game has a barren scenery and repeats textures frequently. The music and sound effects were considered weak, with Nintendo Power stating that the soundtrack does not suit the game's fast pace. Occasional glitches were found, including an instance of two cars overlapping when colliding side by side and the fact that players can get stuck on slanted roadsides, requiring them to restart the race. The gameplay was highlighted for its fluidity and realistic feel. N64 Magazine noted the game's suspension physics, writing that \\"Each wheel has a mind of its own, and jiggles up and down as it goes over bumps. Crest a hill too fast and the whole car will take off, the wheels dangling down until you land with a 'crump', the car then bouncing up and down for a while as the suspension settles down.\\" Many critics agreed that, although the Championship mode starts off slow and the controls require some practice, the game gradually becomes more fun and challenging as players unlock more powerful cars. The track's length and varied weather conditions were also highlighted. The split-screen multiplayer mode was criticized because of its black area on the right side of the screen, which contains the game's HUD but leaves a relatively small portion of the screen for players to observe their surroundings. The fact that both players cannot race against computer-controlled opponents was also criticized. PC port Top Gear Rally was ported by Boss to Microsoft Windows in 1999. Because Kemco owns the Top Gear license, Boss had to released it as Boss Rally. Unlike the Nintendo 64 version, Boss Rally features three more cars and an additional track, and comprises three gameplay modes: Championship, Time Attack, and Quick Race. Both the Championship and Time Attack modes are similar to those from Top Gear Rally, whereas Quick Race is a single-race challenge where the player must race against a computer-controlled opponent. A multiplayer mode that supports up to eight players is also included.

Career Hard-running centre Noon joined the Newcastle Falcons for the 1998-99 Allied Dunbar Premiership, after a letter from one of his school teachers alerted the club to a player who had been totally missed by the representative rugby system in Yorkshire. Playing for Fyling Hall School and Whitby RFC at the time, once the Falcons had seen his talents first hand, he was drafted into the academy squad straightaway. Whilst at Newcastle he started in both the 2001 and 2004 Anglo-Welsh Cup finals as Newcastle emerged victorious from both. \\"Noonie\\" as he is known to close friends went on to graduate from Northumbria University with a sports science degree, while his on-field activity was equally successful as he made two first team appearances in his first year at the club. Later that year he represented England in the Sanzar Under-21 tournament, what would later go on to become the IRB Under-21 World Championship, while his first Premiership try duly came early in the 1999‚Äì00 season away to the London Wasps. As well as representing the England Under-21s he played for the North of England and England Students, while in the 1999‚Äì00 season he played for the England Sevens on the IRB Sevens circuit, including in the Hong Kong Sevens. A supremely consistent performer, in 2003 Noon smashed the record for consecutive Premiership appearances when he started his 50th league game in a row. Full international recognition came in the summer of 2001 when he started three Tests for England on their North American tour ‚Äì two against Canada and one versus the United States, with the Goole-born player scoring his first Test try in the second of the two clashes against the Canadians. In 2003 he played in England's warm-up matches for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, although he was to agonisingly miss out on selection for the tournament itself. He did, however, go on to be named Falcons player of the year for the 2003-04 Zurich Premiership. England Saxons honours in the 2004 Churchill Cup followed as he played against Canada and scored in the final against the New Zealand Maori, while the 2004-05 Zurich Premiership was to prove a major success as he was named joint vice captain of the Falcons. Drafted into a new-look England back line, Noon started all five matches for England during the 2005 Six Nations Championship, rounding it off with a historic hat-trick in the final match of the tournament against Scotland at Twickenham. Married to wife Rachel, both she and new baby boy Lewis were there in the stands to witness it first hand. His England caps continued to come throughout the 2006 Six Nations Championship and the summer tour to Australia. Noon was a part of the England squad that made it to the final of the 2007 Rugby World Cup in France, Noon played in the first couple of pool matches, but picked up a knee injury in the 36‚Äì0 defeat to South Africa. Mathew Tait took his spot at outside centre which proved to be very pivotal, as Noon's young Newcastle teammate was one of England's standout players throughout the tournament, in particular the final where he ran 50 meters and evaded 5 Springboks tacklers, only to be pulled down a few metres short by a great cover tackle by Victor Matfield. However through hard work and a retirement to veteran Mike Catt, Noon was re-instated at centre for England's 2008 Six Nations Championship campaign, he played in every match, apart from the defeat to Wales, and was one of England's best players throughout the tournament despite only coming away with three wins. Noon was particularly impressive in the final match against Ireland where he scored a try and pulled off a number of hard hits, it caused many commentators to say he played well, and to also be awarded \\"Man of the Match\\" ahead of an impressive Danny Cipriani. Noon went on the summer tour to New Zealand, which was marred by controversy involving England players' off-field antics. England lost both matches heavily.

It was enormously popular in the decades after it was painted, but in the 20th century realist historical paintings fell from critical favour and it was kept in storage for many decades, for much of which it was thought lost. Restored and displayed again since 1975, it immediately once again became a highly popular work, especially with younger visitors.Adams, Tim, \\"How Tudorphilia rescued Delaroche\\", in New Statesman The painting portrays, erroneously in some regards, the moments preceding the death of Lady Jane Grey, who on 10 July 1553 was proclaimed Queen of England, only to be deposed nine days later and executed in 1554. Jane is sometimes referred to as the \\"Nine Days' Queen\\" due to the brevity of her reign. Subject Lady Jane Grey was the great- granddaughter of Henry VII of England and first cousin once removed to his grandson, the short-lived Edward VI. After Edward's death she was proclaimed queen, being given precedence over Henry VIII's daughters, Mary Tudor and Elizabeth. Two weeks after the death of her brother, Mary, who had the support of the English people, claimed the throne, which Jane relinquished, having reigned for only nine days. Jane, her husband Lord Guilford Dudley, and her father, were imprisoned in the Tower of London on charges of high treason. Jane's trial was conducted in November, but the death penalty handed to her was temporarily suspended. In February 1554, Jane's father, who had been released, was one of the rebel leaders in Wyatt's rebellion. On Friday 12 February, Mary had Jane, then aged 16, and her husband beheaded. Her father followed two days later. Treatment Delaroche painted the subject of Lady Jane's execution in 1833, nearly 300 years after the event, drawing upon contemporary historical sources to help him portray it accurately. Delaroche had built his reputation in the Paris salon with large, realistic portrayals of famous events from the previous few centuries. Despite the artist's familiarity with the painting of historical narratives, there are aspects of the painting which are inaccurate. Detail The painting depicts the moment that Jane, blindfolded, is being assisted to lay her head upon the block for the executioner. Her outstretched hand reaches uncertainly down to find the block. She is being assisted by a man who is identified as John Brydges, 1st Baron Chandos. Chandos was a Lieutenant of the Tower at the time of Jane's execution. While imprisoned in the Tower, Jane was attended by ladies in waiting, one of whom was the nursemaid of her infancy. Two ladies in waiting are depicted in the painting, showing their grief at the event which is about to take place. The execution actually was conducted in the open air, in a part of the grounds of the Tower of London that is known as Tower Green, and where Henry VIII's wives Anne Boleyn and Catherine Howard had been executed. The painting indicates either that Delaroche was not familiar with this aspect of the event and has constructed the location according to his historical knowledge of other such events, or that he chose to take a great deal of artistic license. In the picture, the execution is taking place upon a raised wooden platform similar to those on which executions of royalty and nobility had taken place in the French Revolution. The edge of this platform can be seen, draped with a black cloth, across the foreground of the picture. At the rear of the pictorial space the handrail of stairs descends, and the tops of two weapons indicate the presence of guards. Delaroche was presumably aware that the Tower of London was founded by William of Normandy. In the painting, two stout Norman columns with cushion capitals, a blind arcade, and a large chevroned arch create a backdrop indicative of the antiquity of the site. However, the buildings within the Tower of London span the reigns of many monarchs. In fact, the execution took place outside the Chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, which was constructed not at the time of William the Conqueror but by order of Henry VIII, and therefore in a style postdating that of the architecture in the painting by nearly 500 years. It is difficult to ascertain by the setting and the lighting whether it was the artist's intention to create the impression that the scene was taking place outside a building or in an interior. The architectural features shown can occur on both interiors and exteriors of Norman buildings. The darkness of the upper part of the painting is suggestive of an interior, while the light that bathes the central figure is daylight. Ghislaine Kenyon, Head of Education at the National Gallery, commented on the sense of foreboding that the darkness was intended to create. The intensely dark areas that occupy a large proportion of the painting's surface play a big part in the drama. Not only is the shadow of the upper section of the painting black, so also are the cloth that covers the platform, the dress of one of the ladies, the cloak of Baron Chandos and the sleeves of the executioner. Three garments form accents of warm colour, the brown dress of one of the ladies, the orange fur of the Lieutenant's collar and the blood- red hose of the executioner. The colour of Lady Jane's red-gold hair is picked up in the straw beneath the block. Against the darkness, Lady Jane, with her pallid flesh, her white bodice and satin petticoat, makes a splash of light. The artist seizes the eye of the viewer by placing the most intense patches of white on Jane's blindfold and the area of her skirt just between her outstretched hand and the sharply defined edge of the block. Delaroche has used many small details in telling the story and increasing the dramatic and emotive quality of the painting. The figures play their parts like actors through the expressions and gestures of grief and despair of the two women, the almost fatherly tenderness with which the Lieutenant of the Tower assists the blindfolded girl to take up the required position and the displeasure in the face of the executioner at the task that confronts him. Other narrative details include the rings on the block with the ropes which lash it steady to the floor, and the well-honed but well-worn edge to the axe. Kenyon points out that the clean straw, commonly placed near the site of an execution to soak up blood, and the white dress were devices used by the artist to make the observer suppose what would happen to them next. Provenance The painting was made after the July Revolution of 1830 which deposed Charles X of France, the last of the French Bourbon monarchs. Charles X's brother was Louis XVI of France whose throne was usurped and who was executed during the French Revolution. It is also redolent of the execution of Marie-Antoinette. Unsurprisingly, the emotive painting caused something of a sensation. The painting was highly popular in the Paris salon when it was first exhibited there in 1834. It was originally bought by Anatoly Nikolaievich Demidov, 1st Prince of San Donato as part of the Demidov collection. From there it passed in 1870 to Henry Eaton, 1st Baron Cheylesmore after whose death in 1891 it realised ¬£1,575 (lot 78) at his sale at Christie's the next year, less than a quarter of the price of the star of the sale, The Monarch of the Glen (lot 42, ¬£7,245) by Sir Edwin Landseer, one of the most popular paintings of the age.Christie's, Catalogue of the important collection of modern pictures and sculpture formed by the late Rt.

It began in 1921 as San Jose Seminary to which \\"outsiders\\" were later admitted. When the seminarians moved to a new facility the remaining school became an \\"externado\\". In 2015 Externado was ranked fourth among 440 schools in El Salvador by the University of El Salvador on the basis of test scores, and had a larger enrollment than the first three schools combined.Ranking by UES. Accessed 19 November 2016. Brief history In 1921 the Jesuits founded San Jos√© School seminary school, in the center of San Salvador next to San Jos√© Church (later destroyed by fire). Later \\"outsiders\\" not contemplating the priesthood were admitted for baccalaureate studies. to the school, which included boarding and day students. Years later the seminarians moved to the new seminary of San Jos√© de la Monta√±a. Those remaining justified the name \\"externs\\" or San Jose Externado. In the 1940s work began on a new school with more adequate facilities on the outskirts of San Salvador, the school's present location. Four Jesuit brothers from the Basque area of Spain did much of the construction at 25 North or \\"√úniversity\\" Avenue. The primary division moved there in 1954 and the secondary school in 1955. In 1963 the chapel of St. Ignatius of Loyola was built with a capacity for a thousand people. In 1956 the night school, Loyola Academy, was founded to tend to the needs of workers and employees. In 1972 an evening shift was added, to better serve the poor. In 1978, co-education was introduced. On 10 October 10, 1986, the San Salvador earthquake critically damaged the three-story building, and it had to be demolished. While new facilities were being constructed the primary school met in the chapel and the Baccalaureate at Central American University (UCA). In 1988 the new and current facilities were opened, with financial help from Jesuits provinces outside El Salvador. Mission San Jose is academically selective; its students have ranked highest in the Learning and Academic Aptitude Test scores (PAES) since its inception in 1997. Externado San Jos√© was long considered a school for the elites, but after the Second Vatican Council and the Conference of Latin American Bishops at Medellin in the 1960s the Jesuits and staff determined to make education more accessible to the poor. They initiated a sliding scale for tuition, based on family income. No longer seen as elitist, the school nonetheless has maintained high admission and academic performance standards. For secondary students, low grades and/or demerits in personal conduct can lead to expulsion. At the same time, Christian Formation courses took on the goal of forming men and women devoted to serving their society. This included some elements of Liberation Theology which would bridge the deep social divide in El Salvador. At the time many upscale families withdrew their children from the school, and six Jesuits at their sister school UCA would become martyrs for their open opposition to the elitist government. Externado San Jos√© still operates with this system of differentiated quotas, and remains coeducational. Its graduates include many prominent Salvadoreans, among them former presidents Armando Calder√≥n Sol and Mauricio Funes, and the internationally acclaimed poet Roque Dalton. Academics The last year of preschool and nine years of primary school meet from 7:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. Besides usual subjects children receive classes in Christian formation, sports, music, crafts, English (from second grade), and chess (from third grade). This is followed by two years of Baccalaureate meeting from 7:00 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. From grade seven on, group work and creativity are promoted along with various forms of research, fostering development in the group and emotional maturity. These programs are supplemented by physical education, Christian training, computer skills, and study skills.

The lower left has the coat of arms of Ignatius of Loyola, founder of the Jesuits, and the bottom right has the letters \\"AMDG\\" taken from the Latin for the Ignatian motto, \\"To the greater glory of God.\\" The parrot is the mascot of the school, usually portrayed by a cute rendering of a parakeet, a very common bird in Central America. Pastoral department In line with the Jesuit objective of training men and women for others, throughout the year various activities are carried out such as coexistence, retreats, Christian formation classes, and community celebrations (Pentecost, Easter, Confirmations...). To encounter people who live in poverty and are marginalized in the country, regular visits are arranged to institutions for children, for young people, and for the elderly, people who are often at risk, abused, or deprived of their basic needs; this is followed by group reflection. The school is a part of the Ignatians for Haiti drive among Jesuit schools in Latin America. Culture & communications The Department of Communications and Cultural Activities (DECOMACCU) offers three programs which run throughout the year. Periqueando newsletter is produced for elementary (K ‚Äì 6) and Perquiting for secondary (7 ‚Äì 11) students. Student activities of a cultural, athletic, pastoral, or social nature are covered. Festivals and cultural contests discover, promote, and reward the creative and artistic talents of students, through writing (composition, poetry, and narrative), speaking (oratory and declamation), and performing (music, drawing, theater, and dance). Their best literary efforts are published in Green Letter Anthology, which can be viewed online. Occasionally cultural events are staged within the school, featuring prominent artistic groups. Sports Students in ninth grade through high school take physical education, which teaches swimming, basketball, volleyball, soccer, and fitness. Intramural tournaments are also conducted for students from first grade through high school, in soccer, swimming, volleyball, basketball, kickball, and track and field.

Founded on 12 March 1954, it is supported by, though independent of, the Indian government. Its office is located in Rabindra Bhavan near Mandi House in Delhi. The Sahitya Akademi organises national and regional workshops and seminars; provides research and travel grants to authors; publishes books and journals, including the Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature; and presents the annual Sahitya Akademi Award of Rs. 100,000 (approx. USD 1,500 (in year 2013)) in each of the 24 languages it supports, as well as the Sahitya Akademi Fellowship for lifetime achievement. The Sahitya Akademi Library is one of the largest multi-lingual libraries in India, with a rich collection of books on literature and allied subjects. It publishes two bimonthly literary journals: Indian Literature in English and Samkaleen Bharatiya Sahitya in Hindi.  Languages The Sahitya Akademi supports work in the following languages: *Assamese *Bengali *Bodo *Dogri *English *Gujarati *Hindi *Kannada *Kashmiri *Konkani *Maithili *Malayalam *Manipuri *Marathi *Nepali *Odia *Punjabi *Rajasthani *Sanskrit *Santhali *Sindhi *Tamil *Telugu *Urdu  History  The idea of constituting a National Academy of Letters in India was considered by the colonial British government, and in 1944 a proposal from the Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal for the formation of a 'National Cultural Trust' was, in principle, accepted. The original plan conceived of three institutions, or academies, devoted to the visual arts, performing arts, and letters. The independent Government of India carried out this proposal, constituting a National Academy of Letters, called the 'Sahitya Akademi' by a government resolution on 15 December 1952. The first General Council of the Akademi included members such as S. Radhakrishnan, Abul Kalam Azad, C. Rajagopalachari, K.M. Panikkar, K.M. Munshi, Zakir Hussain, Umashankar Joshi, Mahadevi Varma, D. V. Gundappa, Ramdhari Singh Dinkar, and was presided over by the then-Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. The Government of India clarified that the choice of Prime Minister Nehru as the first chairperson was \\"not because he is Prime Minister, but because he has carved out for himself a distinctive place as a writer and author.\\" The Sahitya Akademi was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954 in New Delhi. A ceremony was held in the Indian Parliament's Central Hall, with speeches by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and S. Radhakrishnan. S. Radhakrishnan elaborated on the purpose of the Sahitya Akademi in his speech, noting that, > \\"The phrase, Sahitya Akademi, combines two words. 'Sahitya' is Sanskrit, and > 'Academy' is Greek. This name suggests our universal outlook and aspiration. > Sahitya is a literary composition; Academy is an assembly of men who are > interested in the subject. So Sahitya Akademi will be an assembly of all > those who are interested in creative and critical literature. It is the > purpose of this Akademi to recognise men of achievement in letters, to > encourage men of promise in letters, to educate public taste and to improve > standards of literature and literary criticism.\\" A key concern in the early days of the Sahitya Akademi was the establishment of its autonomy from the Central Government. This concern was echoed by the Prime Minister, who noted that, \\"...it is an honour to be the President of an organisation which includes it in its fold the eminent writers of India in various languages. As President of that Akademi I may tell you quite frankly, I would not like the Prime Minister to interfere in my work.\\" The first Council made recommendations to amend the Akademi's governing constitution, including proposals to have the chairman elected by the Council and not appointed by the Government. Some of these suggestions were incorporated, and the Akademi was constituted as a society under the Societies Registration Act of 1860, as it had not originally been incorporated by an Act of Parliament, but by an executive order. The Council was reconstituted and elected Prime Minister Nehru as its president, and he continued in that capacity until his death in 1964. Subsequent presidents of the Sahitya Akademi have included S. Radhakrishnan (1958) who succeeded Jawaharlal Nehru after serving as the Vice- President along with him; Zakir Hussain (1963); Suniti Kumar Chatterjee (1967); K.R. Srinivasa Iyengar (1969, and re-elected in 1973); Umashankar Joshi (1978); Birendra Kumar Bhattacharya (1983); U. R. Ananthamurthy (1993); Ramakanta Rath (1998); and Gopi Chand Narang (2003). Sunil Gangopadhyay was elected president in 2008, and held office until his death in 2012. The current president is Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari. The Akademi has never elected a female president although, in 2003, Mahasweta Devi unsuccessfully contested Gopi Chand Narang for the position.  Constitution and structure  Bengaluru The Sahitya Akademi was constituted by the Government of India by a resolution passed on 15 December 1952. It was formally inaugurated on 12 March 1954. It initially functioned under executive order, but was subsequently registered as a society under the Indian Societies Registration Act, 1860. The constitution of the Sahitya Akademi provides that it shall be run by three authorities ‚Äî a General Council, an Executive Board, and a Finance Committee. The General Council is empowered to elect a president and vice-president, from a panel of three candidates chosen by the Executive Board. In addition to these, the Executive Board appoints a secretary, who functions as both the Secretary of the Akademi and as ex-officio secretary of all three governing bodies. = General Council = The General Council of the Sahitya Akademi operates for a term of five years, following which it is reconstituted. It meets once a year and performs several important functions, including appointing the Akademi's president and vice-president, electing members of the Executive Board, framing rules and procedures for the Akademi, and electing fellows on the recommendation of the Board. The General Council consists of the following members: * The president and the financial advisor. The current president of the Sahitya Akademi is Chandrashekhara Kambara. * Five persons nominated by the Government of India, including one each from the National Book Trust, the Department of Culture, and the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting * One person from each state and union territory in India (these are to be nominated by the outgoing General Council, based on recommendations from the states and union territories) * One person to represent each language supported by the Sahitya Akademi (nominated by the outgoing General Council) * A representative each, from a maximum of 20 universities, with post-graduate departments in the humanities (selected by the outgoing Council) * Eight other persons from the field of letters (nominated from by the outgoing General Council) * Representatives from the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Lalit Kala Akademi, the Indian Council for Cultural Relations, the Raja Rammohun Roy Library, and a representative from an Indian publisher based on recommendations from publishers' associations. = Executive Board = The Executive Board of the Sahitya Akademi exercises executive authority and is responsible for supervising and controlling the Akademi's work. It prepares the Akademi's annual budget, appoints the secretary, and prepares panels of nominees for the General Council to consider and select fellows. It consists of the president, the vice-president, the financial advisor, two of the Government of India's nominees in the General Council (one of whom must represent the Ministry of Culture) and one person to represent each of the Akademi's supported languages, as nominated by the General Council. = Finance Committee = The Finance Committee's role is to prescribe the limit for total expenditure by the Sahitya Akademi in a financial year, and consider and recommend budget estimates to the Executive Board. The Finance Committee consists of a financial advisor, a nominee from the Government of India, a representative each from the General Council and Executive Board, and the vice-president of the Akademi. The accounts of the Sahitya Akademi are audited by the Auditor General of India.  Publications and activities  The Sahitya Akademi publishes several regular publications, in addition to its bi-monthly journal, Indian Literature. It undertakes bibliographic surveys, conducts translation workshops, seminars, and an annual festival of letters. = Publications = The Sahitya Akademi publishes bibliographies, compilations, and critical editions in addition to publishing individual works and anthologies of literature and translation in the 24 languages that it supports. Amongst other things, it publishes the National Bibliography of Indian Literature (NBIL), an ongoing selective index of publications in 24 languages. The first series of the NBIL consisted of four volumes, spanning literature published between 1901 and 1953. The Sahitya Akademi has stated that the second series will cover literature published between 1954 and 2000. The second series will consist of 16 volumes, of which seven have been published. In addition, the Sahitya Akademi has published the Collected Works of Maulana Azad in Urdu and Telugu, and critical editions of books by Kalidasa, Bankimchandra Chatterjee, and Rabindranath Tagore. The Sahitya Akademi maintains reference materials for Indian literature, including the National Register of Translators, the Who's Who of Indian Writers, and the Who's Who of Sanskrit literature. Two ongoing series of reference material are the Makers of Indian Literature, which consist of biographical monographs on Indian writers, and Histories of Indian Literature, 18 of which have been published thus far. It publish two journal: Indian Literature (started in 1957) in English, and Samakaleen Bharatiya Sahitya (started in 1980) in Hindi. = Activities = The Sahitya Akademi holds over 100 programmes related to Indian literature every year across India. It holds frequent seminars on Indian literature, as well as translation workshops. In addition, it holds several regular and annual events, including a Festival of Letters and the Samvatsar Annual Lecture.  International seminars  The Sahitya Akademi periodically holds International Seminars, sometimes in collaboration with the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The first international seminar was held in 1961, in New Delhi, to mark 100 years since the birth of Rabindranath Tagore. About 25 writers from 16 countries, along with 39 writers from India met over four days to discuss and commemorate Tagore's works. Attendees included Aldous Huxley, Martin Wickremesinghe, Jean Guehenno, Zaki Naguib Mahmoud, Isaiah Berlin, and Louis Untermeyer as well as Amrita Pritam, Ramdhari Sinha Dinkar, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, and Premendra Mitra. In 1991, the Akademi organised a second International Seminar on Tagore in collaboration with the Sangeet Natak Akademi, the Lalit Kala Akademi and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations. The Akademi's second International Seminar in 1975 was also held in New Delhi and focused on the Ramayana tradition in Asia. Participants, including U Thein Han, Soewito Santoso, Harry M. Buck, C.E. Godakumbra, Kapila Vatsyayan, Camille Bulke and Umashankar Joshi, presented 44 papers on Ramayana traditions, which were published by the Akademi in a commemorative volume. A second International seminar on the same theme was held in New Delhi in 1981. International Seminars have since been held to mark the birth centenary of Hindi-language writer Premchand, in 1981; to mark the birth centenary of Tamil-language poet Subramania Bharti in 1983; on the Mahabharata, in 1987; and on 'the Narrative' in 1990.  Annual Festival of Letters  The Sahitya Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters is held in February and is the occasion at which the Akademi presents its awards. The festival is accompanied by an exhibition that covers major literary events of the previous year, as well as a 'Writers' Meet' which is a literary seminar spanning three days.  Samvatsar Annual Lecture  The Samvatsar Annual Lecture is organised by the Sahitya Akademi and is delivered during the Akademi's Annual Festival of Letters. The Sahitya Akademi notes that these lectures \\"should open up new vistas of thinking regarding a literary movement, a current literary trend, some original thinking about a great writer or a great classic or a new path in literary criticism or literary creation\\". The Lectures have been delivered since 1986 by people including the Hindi writer Sachchidananda Vatsyayan (1986), Marathi poet and writer Vinda Karandikar (1991), Assamese novelist Nabakanta Barua (1994), and Malayalam author and director, M T Vasudevan Nair (1999). In 2014, the lecture was delivered by Girish Karnad, a Kannada playwright and author. The most recent lecture was delivered by Dr. Chandrashekhar Shankar Dharmadhikari, an author, lawyer, and former judge in the Bombay High Court on 17 February 2016. 'Meet the Author' programmes The Sahitya Akademi organises regular public interactions with published Indian authors. These sessions, titled 'Meet the Author' consist of a 40-minute lecture by the invited author followed by an open session of questions and discussions. 'Meet the Author' programmes have been conducted in Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, and Bengaluru. Over 180 authors have participated to date. To complement this, the Sahitya Akademi has held a parallel lecture series titled 'Men in Books' in which the Akademi invites persons distinguished for interdisciplinary studies to speak about literature. Notable speakers in the past have included film-maker Adoor Gopalakrishnan, journalist Dilip Padgaonkar, lawyer Laxmi Mall Singhvi, and former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee. Kavi Anuvadak The Kavi Anuvadak programmes, started in 2001, consist of a live performance of poetry in the original language and in translation. Nine Kavi Anuvadaks have been held to date, featuring, amongst others, K. Satchidanandan, Manglesh Dabral, and Ayyappa Paniker. Sahitya Akademi Award Sahitya Akademi Award (Devnagari: ‡§∏‡§æ‡§π‡§ø‡§§‡•ç‡§Ø ‡§Ö‡§ï‡§æ‡§¶‡§Æ‡•Ä ‡§™‡•Å‡§∞‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞) is a literary honor in India which Sahitya Akademi annually confers on writers of the most outstanding books of literary merit published in any of the major Indian languages recognised by the Akademi. Yuva Puraskar Sahitya Akademi conferres annually the Yuva Puraskar to young writers (under 35 years) of outstanding works in one of the 24 major Indian languages. It was founded in 2011. Other programmes Other programmes organised by the Sahitya Akademi include the Mulakat lectures, a special platform for lesser-known authors; the Through My Window lectures, in which one author speaks on the works of another Indian author; and the Loka programmes on Indian folklore and the Kavisandhi poetry readings.  Controversies and Parliamentary Committee reviews  There have been widespread allegations of corruption and controversial appointments under the Presidency of Gopi Chand Narang who headed Sahitya Akademi from 2003 to 2007 and the President Vishwanath Prasad Tiwari. Agrahara Krishnamurthy, appointed as the Secretary of Sahitya Akademi by Narang, had undergone a CBI probe in a paper purchase scam at the time of his appointment, and was censured and forced to retire after being accused of financial irregularities in 2012. Agrahara Krishnamurthy who has been granted relief by the High Court has alleged a conspiracy against him by a cabal of writers and officials. The appointment by a committee composed of Narang, Tiwari and others of the current Secretary K. Sreenivasa Rao, is controversial as Rao's academic credentials for the top job, who had joined the Akademi as a lower division clerk (LDC), are said to be insufficient and extremely dubious. The 171st Parliamentary Standing Committee on the functioning of Sahitya Akademi and three other institutions chaired by Sitaram Yechury and tabled at the Lok Sabha in August 2011 states, \\"It was felt that most of these institutions were not able to live up to the original mandates set out by their founding fathers. Controversies of different kind involving these institutions that keep cropping up from time to time, had caught this Committee‚Äôs attention. Questions were also raised about the indifference and helplessness shown by the Ministry of Culture to do anything in the face of autonomy enjoyed by these institutions.\\" The Committee also urged Sahitya Akademi to adopt the recommendation of the Haksar Committee (1988) of having its head appointed by the President of India, a practice followed by Sangeet Natak and Lalit Kala Akademies, to avoid \\"the inevitable complications of the existing system of elections.\\" = Controversial appointments = Many controversial appointments of unqualified candidates to key positions at the Sahitya Akademi, done during Gopi Chand Narang's time, continue unchallenged to this day. Khurshid Alam and Mrignayani Gupta, both dismissed in 2004 for presenting counterfeit degree certificates, have made a backdoor entry and have been subsequently promoted to higher positions. There have been widespread allegations in the Hindi press that the certificates of the current secretary, K. Sreenivasa Rao, who completed his M.Phil and PhD degrees while being employed as Deputy Secretary (Administration) at the Sahitya Akademi without availing a single day's leave, are fake and fraudulent. Appeals by the writers community to the Ministry of Culture to launch an inquiry have not yielded any result. = Sahitya Akademi Awards controversy = It has been alleged time and again that the procedure of nomination of litterateurs for the coveted Sahitya Akademi Awards is not transparent. The ground-list of books (from which the jury members make two short-lists and the final selection for the award) is supposed to be made by the General Council. But the books are provided to this council by the bureaucrats and employees of the Akademi who are allegedly unqualified to make any kind of literary selection. Though the award regulations makes the recommendations of the Language Advisory Board mandatory, the recommendations of the board are often dismissed and ignored by the officials without citing any reason. This lack of transparency and rigour in the selection process has resulted in a lot of controversy. It has even resulted in writers being forced to return the award when it has been proven that the selection procedure was fraudulent, as was the case with the Sahitya Akademi award for a translation into Odia in 1999. Sahitya Akademi is also highly criticized by writers such as Khushwant Singh for ignoring eminent writers and awarding below-par writers and sub-standard literary works. Golden Jubilee awards On the occasion of its Golden Jubilee, the Akademi awarded the following prizes for outstanding works of poetry in translation from Indian languages. *Rana Nayar for his translation of the verses of the Sikh saint Baba Farid from Punjabi. *Tapan Kumar Pradhan for English translation of his own Odia poem collection Kalahandi * Paromita Das for English translation of Parvati Prasad Baruwa's poems in Assamese. The Golden Jubilee Prizes for Life Time Achievement were awarded to Namdeo Dhasal, Ranjit Hoskote, Neelakshi Singh, Abdul Rasheed and Sithara S.

The company, created under its current name in 1995 by its founder Freddy Bienstock, is headquartered on East 38th Street in Manhattan. Bienstock died on September 29, 2009, after which Carlin Music was run by his daughter Caroline (after whom the publisher was named) and son Robert. As of January 2018, Carlin operates as a division of American music publisher Round Hill Music.  History  In 1966 Freddy Bienstock acquired Belinda Music Publishing, which he renamed Carlin Music Corporation after his daughter, Caroline. He soon expanded the Carlin Music catalog by associations with such hit makers as Leiber & Stoller in addition to representing Atlantic Records and Motown Records. Carlin was then named Publisher of the Year by Music Week for ten consecutive years. In partnership with Leiber & Stoller, Bienstock later formed Hudson Bay Music as the publisher's American business. Located in New York City on the top floor of the legendary Broadway landmark Brill Building, Hudson Bay rapidly acquired such major assets as the TM Music and Faithful Virtue Music catalogs, whose artists included Bobby Darin, Tim Hardin and John Sebastian, and the label and publishing divisions of Starday and King Records. His holdings were further enlarged by the acquisitions of the music publishing interests of The New York Times, the preeminent Broadway show catalog of its era, with scores such as Fiddler on the Roof, 'Cabaret', 'Company', 'Follies', 'Godspell', and hits by songwriters Peter Allen, Marvin Hamlisch, and Carole Bayer Sager. After his partnership with Leiber and Stoller ended in 1980, Bienstock, along with the estates of Rodgers & Hammerstein, acquired Edward B. Marks Music Co., whose songwriters included George M. Cohan, Billie Holiday, Ernesto Lecuona, and Jim Steinman, in addition to composers such as William Bolcom, Norman Dello Joio and Roger Sessions. In 1984, Bienstock and PolyGram acquired Chappell Music and became Chappell's Worldwide President, with Carlin becoming an administered company. After PolyGram sold Chappell to Warner Music Group, Bienstock restructured Carlin as an independent international publishing organization with Carlin Music as the London-based main office for the company's UK and European operations. In September 2017, Round Hill Music agreed to acquire Carlin for $245 million.

While it is found widely throughout Scandinavian countries, which have a maritime climate, it is absent from parts of the former USSR which are at the same latitude but have a more continental climate.Skinner (1984), FE (2009) The head of a male Peribatodes rhomboidaria Up to four subspecies are listed by some authors, while others consider the willow beauty a monotypic species or accept only rhomboidaria and sublutearia as distinct:FE (2009) * Peribatodes rhomboidaria corsicaria (Schawerda 1931) * Peribatodes rhomboidaria defloraria (Dannehl 1928) * Peribatodes rhomboidaria rhomboidaria (Denis & Schifferm√ºller, 1775) * Peribatodes rhomboidaria sublutearia (Zerny 1927) Under its junior synonym Geometra rhomboidaria, the willow beauty is the type species of its genus Peribatodes. This was initially proposed as a subgenus of Boarmia but eventually elevated to full genus rank.Pitkin & Jenkins (2004) Description and ecology Caterpillar The adult's wingspan is 40‚Äì48 mm. The wings of this species are whitish-grey or -yellowish, though they have a buff or grey appearance from a distance, as they are heavily speckled with brown or black dots. Running over the fore- and hindwings in a semicircle are the two blackish bands commonly found in Ennominae, but they are broken and somewhat indistinct in this species. A tell-tale characteristic is a single bulge in the forewing part of the outer blackish bands. Melanic forms (e.g. rebeli) sometimes occur. The sexes can be distinguished by their antennae, which are strongly feathered in the male, but almost smooth in the female.Kolar (1942), Skinner (1984), Chinery (2007) This moth inhabits woodland, gardens and similar habitat. Either one or two generations occur each year, depending on locality. The adults are on the wing during summer - e.g. June to September on the British Isles, while in the more continental climate of Austria they are rarely seen anymore in late August. They fly at night and are attracted to light. The caterpillar larva is reddish-brown and feeds on a variety of trees and shrubs, but - despite its name - rarely or never on willows (Salix). The species overwinters as a small larva. As evidenced by the species distribution, it does not seem to tolerate severe and dry winters very well.Skinner (1984), Chinery (2007), FE (2009) =Recorded food plants= Willow beauty larvae are highly polyphagous and not adapted to a specific lineage of foodplants. Rather, they eat foliage of a wide range of eudicots, as well as some other plants. Recorded foodplants include:Skinner (1984), Chinery (2007), and see references in Savela (2002) * Betula (birch) * Camellia sinensis (tea) * Clematis (clematises) - not in Finland * Crataegus (hawthorn) * Hedera (ivy) * Ligustrum (privet) - not in Finland * Malus (apple) * Prunus (plum, cherry, peach) - including blackthorn (P. spinosa) - not in Finland - and possibly others * Taxus (yew) * Vitis (grapevine) Synonyms Junior synonyms of the willow beauty include:FE (2009), and see references in Savela (2002) * Geometra rhomboidaria Denis & Schifferm√ºller, 1775 * Boarmia corsicaria Schawerda, 1931 * Boarmia defloraria Dannehl, 1928 * Peribatodes dragone de Laever & Parenzan, 1986 * Boarmia psoralaria Milli√®re, 1885 * Boarmia syritaurica Wehrli, 1931 Footnotes References * (2007): Domino Guide to the Insects of Britain and Western Europe (Revised ed.).

The Henry Luce II Center for the Study of American Culture, New York. Lady Jane Grey Preparing for Execution is an 1835 oil painting by the American artist George Whiting Flagg which established his early fame. This fame was however to dwindle as a consequence of a decline in the role of historical painting in American art. It was originally meant to represent Mary, Queen of Scots, but Flagg decided to change it to Lady Jane Grey in mid-work. In a letter to Lumen Reed on June 16, 1834, he said: :\\"I have changed the name of my picture to Lady Jane Gray . I find that Mary was too old at the time of her exicution to make an interesting picture.\\" A heroic Lady Jane, Protestant martyr, clad in royal purple, head held high, is blindfolded for execution by sympathetic executioners. Notably absent are any crucifixes, beads, medallions or other signs of \\"popery\\" distinguishing the religious life of Catholics from that of Protestants. The painting appears to show her being blindfolded indoors, in reality she was executed outdoors and would probably only have been blindfolded after she was led onto the scaffold.

Location and features Formed by the confluence of the East and West Branches of the river, the Ovens River rises in the Victorian Alps, at the settlement of Harrietville, sourced by runoff from high slopes located within the Alpine National Park and the Mount Buffalo National Park. The river flows generally north by west and is joined by eighteen tributaries including Morses Creek at Bright, the Buckland River at , the Buffalo River and then the King River at . The river descends over its course. The Great Alpine Road follows much of the course of the river in its upper reaches. =Ovens Valley= The river flows through the Ovens Valley, which is a popular tourist destination servicing the ski fields of Mount Hotham, Mount Buffalo and Falls Creek, the Alpine National Park and the Mount Buffalo National Park. Air sports such as gliding and paragliding are also practised here, and there is a hedge maze at Wandiligong. A disused railway line has been converted to the Murray to the Mountains Rail Trail, a cycle trail which stretches from Wangaratta and Beechworth to Bright. There are several wineries in the area, and many hops farms. The wineries are a popular stop for cyclists on their touring rides. Tobacco was a major industry in the valley until 2006; that year saw the British American Tobacco and Philip Morris companies decide to no longer buy Australian tobacco, and the Federal Government began implementing a plan to transition growers out of this industry. Reminders of the valley's long and prosperous tobacco history continue to dot the valley, such as the many tobacco kilns Etymology Hamilton Hume and William Hovell explored the area in 1824, naming the Ovens River in honour of Major John Ovens, the Secretary to Thomas Brisbane, the Colonial Governor of New South Wales.

A lock, he played for Coventry, Saracens and Bath. He won 69 caps for England and 5 for the British and Irish Lions. Early life Grewcock was born in Coventry and attended Templars Primary School in Tile Hill then the secondary in Eastern Green Woodlands School, Coventry, leaving school in 1989. His rugby career started with Barkers Butts and Coventry and he played for the Warwickshire U21 side at age 19. He is a graduate of Manchester Metropolitan University. Rugby career In 1996‚Äì97 he moved into the professional ranks with Coventry. It was Coventry's most successful period of the modern era, coming within touching distance of the Premiership. Along the way, with Grewcock an ever-present, they beat a Newcastle Falcons side featuring 15 internationals by 19-18 at Coundon Road. They eventually finished third to Newcastle and champions Richmond, and lost a promotion play-off against London Irish despite taking a narrow first leg advantage to Sunbury. Despite their second-tier status, both Grewcock and team mate Rob Hardwick were capped by England in this era. Grewcok's first cap for England came in the 1997 tour to Argentina, scoring his first international try in the test in Buenos Aires. He was sent off during England's 1998 trip to New Zealand. He joined Saracens later that summer but switched to Bath for the 2001‚Äì02 season. He played in all three Test matches for the British and Irish Lions against Australia and in six of the ten tour matches overall. He was only able to make one appearance during the 2003 World Cup after a toe injury, and breaking a hand in England's match against Uruguay. He was replaced in the squad by Simon Shaw. He received a World Cup winner's medal in December 2004. Grewcock returned to domestic rugby with Bath and produced some outstanding rugby, which led to his international recall as the successor for Martin Johnson in the Six Nations. He started in all three Autumn 2004 tests. He was selected for the 2005 Lions tour to New Zealand. He was suspended for two months after being found guilty of biting All Blacks hooker Keven Mealamu during the first Test on 25 June. Grewcock continued to play for England in the Six Nations Championship, where he received a yellow card against Ireland. He received a suspension that ruled him out of the 2007 World Cup. Grewcock signed a one- year extension to his Bath contract, which kept him there until the end of the 2010/11 season. He retired in 2011 and took up a role with the Bath Academy. He has since worked as Director of Sports at Oundle School. Disciplinary record =Incidents on international duty= He earned a five-week ban for a kicking offence after being sent off in 1998 at Carisbrook and six years later he received a six-week suspension after being found guilty of reckless use of his boot on Daniel Carter. When he returned in 2005 with the Lions, Grewcock was banned for two months for biting Keven Mealamu's finger. The suggestion that Mealamu had been in the process of hooking Grewcock's mouth was not proven, but the length of suspension given to Grewcock was way below that usually given to a player found guilty of biting. He also kicked Wales scrum half Dwayne Peel in the face during Wales' 11‚Äì9 victory over England in 2005. He received a yellow card after stepping over a ruck to try to win the ball before the scrum half had picked it up. =Incidents with Bath Rugby= On 8 September 2002 he was sent-off following a clash with his one-time flatmate Kyran Bracken in Bath's 28‚Äì3 Zurich Premiership defeat to Saracens. Grewcock was initially banned for five-weeks after being found guilty of reckless use of his boot. Bath appealed against the ban; with Bracken's support and new photographic evidence of the incident, the appeal was successful and Grewcock's ban quashed. In March 2003, he was cited by the RFU of two counts of striking another player during Bath's 27‚Äì10 Premiership defeat to Northampton Saints on 15 March 2003. Grewcock was found not guilty of both striking charges but the unsporting behaviour complaint, where he was accused of ripping up the scrum-cap of Northampton lock Mark Connors, was upheld and a fine of ¬£500 issued. An eventful season culminated with the receipt of a red card for punching Lawrence Dallaglio, in Bath's 30‚Äì48 European Challenge Cup final defeat to London Wasps on 25 May 2003. A post-match disciplinary hearing saw Grewcock suspended for 14 days, with the suspension commencing on 1 June 2003 and consequently ruling him out of the New Zealand leg of England's summer tour of Australasia. Consequently, having originally been named in the original 37-man squad, he was replaced by Tom Palmer. Following a citing, Grewcock pleaded guilty to stamping on Nathan Bonner-Evans in Bath's 18‚Äì16 home Guinness Premiership victory over Sale Sharks on 22 December 2006. He received a one-week suspension for the offence. The same season saw him cited a second time, this time for a punch on Thibault Privat in Bath's 22‚Äì16 defeat by Clermont Auvergne in the European Challenge Cup final on 19 May 2007. He was found guilty and suspended for the period 8 June ‚Äì 15 September 2007 which, taking into account the close season of inactivity, meant that he was suspended from playing rugby for a period of seven weeks, the start of his season being judged to be 4 August 2007. He lodged an appeal against the ban but was unsuccessful. After remaining trouble-free for over two years, he was cited for striking Neil de Kock in Bath's home Guinness Premiership 11‚Äì12 defeat to Saracens on 31 October 2009. He pleaded guilty to the charge and received a two-week suspension. On 23 January 2010, Grewcock received his third red card in Bath's colours when he stamped on the forearm of Ulster's Stephen Ferris in the club's 10‚Äì28 home Heineken Cup defeat; the dismissal saw him receive a seven-week suspension. Honours Grewcock was awarded an MBE in the Queen's 2003 New Year's Honours list, along with other players from Bath ‚Äì Iain Balshaw, Mike Catt and Mike Tindall - who were in England's World Cup squad.

Thomas Worthington (11 April 1826 ‚Äì 9 November 1909) was a 19th-century English architect, particularly associated with public buildings in and around Manchester. Worthington's preferred style was the Gothic Revival. Early life Worthington was born in Crescent Parade, Crescent, Salford, Lancashire, on 11 April 1826. He was the fourth of six sons of a Salford Unitarian cotton merchant, also called Thomas, and his second wife Susanna (1792‚Äì1869). He left school, aged 14, and was articled to Henry Bowman, architect (Bowman & Crowther).Some of his drawings appeared in Bowman and Crowther's Churches of the Middle Ages; Stewart, Cecil (1956) The Stones of Manchester. London: Edward Arnold; pp. 80-87 Before he was twenty he had won two medals: one for a church design (Royal Society of Arts) and one for an essay on \\"Brick\\" (Royal Institute of British Architects).Stewart (1956); pp. 80-87 After completing his articles in 1847, he assisted William Tite who was building Carlisle railway station. On the suspension of this work in 1848, he went on an eight-month study tour to France, Italy and Switzerland accompanied by a friend, Henry A. Darbishire.Darbishire was another pupil of Bowman & Crowther, and later designed the Columbia Market in Bethnal Green. Their journey took them through Tuscany, Latium and Campania; Worthington's notes and sketches from the trip provided him with a first-hand knowledge of Italian Gothic and Renaissance architecture, which give him inspiration for his own later work. After returning to Manchester in October 1848, Worthington spent a short time gaining experience of quantity surveying, before opening his own architectural practice in King Street the following year. Social concerns Worthington was strongly influenced by his Unitarian upbringing, becoming committed to social reform and joining numerous learned societies, including the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, the Portico Library and the Royal Manchester Institution. Partly as a result of his social concerns, Worthington was often commissioned to design public buildings, ranging from public baths and hospitals to workhouses and Unitarian churches.

Originally a sky spirit, her compassion for human suffering brought her to earth to share our fate. In Lithuanian mythology Laumƒós are the very oldest goddesses of Lithuanian mythology. The image of these goddesses may have formed during the historical Mesolithic period, just after the Ice Age. Laumƒós could appear in the form of animals, as mares or as female goats, bears and dogs. Later, Laumƒós had an anthropomorphic appearance: they usually had birds‚Äô claws for feet and appeared as women with the head or lower body of a female goat. Other forms included half-human/half dog or half mare, similar to centaurs. Like cyclops, Laumƒós often had only one eye. They also had large breasts with stone nipples; pieces of belemnitida found on the ground were called \\"Laumƒós nipples.\\"Laumƒó. Mitologijos enciklopedija, 2 tomas. ‚Äì Vilnius: Vaga, 1999. ‚Äì 283 p. Laumƒós were dangerous, especially to men. They could tickle or tweak them to death and then eat their bodies, and in this way, they were similar to Lamia of Greek mythology. The Lithuanian myth also claimed Laumƒós kept huge cows which could be milked by all people. However, after very cold weathers, the cows died; pieces of belemnitida were considered to be the remains of their udders. Laumƒós were afraid of tools made from iron. Laumƒós can be considered as atmospheric goddesses. It is said that Laumƒó was a beautiful goddess, who lived in clouds and had a diamond throne. Some myths claimed Laumƒó was a bride of thunder god Perk≈´nas; however, they did not marry because Laumƒó fell in love with the Moon, who was considered a male god in Lithuania. In other stories, the bride was stolen by the devil Velnias, named Tuolius. That's why Laumƒó liked moonshine. In other myth, the bride of Perk≈´nas was a Laumƒó called Vaiva. The rainbow was called the ribbon of Vaiva. Despite her marriage, she had a beloved singer named Straublys. Straublys had stolen the ribbon of Vaiva. During the rain, Straublys stretches the ribbon of Vaiva across the sky, while Perk≈´nas is angry and shouts in thunder. It was believed it is the rainbow that causes the rain, while Lithuanian shepherds had a prayer or curse by which the rainbow had to turn to pieces and make the rain go away. The other myth claimed Laumƒó fell in love with a beautiful young man down to earth. They both had a son named Meilius (name derived from word 'Meilƒó' - love). Laumƒó descended to the sky to feed her son with her breasts from time to time. However, the highest God found out about the son of sacrilegious love, smashed him into the highest place of the sky and gave him a place between stars. After that he cut Laumƒós breasts, and so, stone pieces of it can be found on Earth. Laumƒós descended from the sky to Earth. They lived nearby lakes, abandoned bath-houses, in islands of lakes or dense forests. Many names of water pools in Lithuania are named after the word Laumƒó. Laumƒós liked to gather near rivers, lakes, swamps, in meadows, there dew fell in the night in New Moon or Full Moon. They danced and enjoyed themselves, leaving circles (like Fairy Ring) in the grass. Usually, Laumƒós were most powerful at Friday of New Moon, at the rainiest days of the month in Lithuania. Laumƒós could cause hail, storm or rain by singing, dancing or by curses. Laumƒós song was traditionally performed during weddings up until the 19th century. The song was performed by girls dancing in a circle, with one in the middle. The dance and song was also said to cause rain.An encyclopedic dictionary of mythological and folkloric characters, epics, legends, etc. of most nations of the world, with particular attention to nations of the USSR.

The Rainbow was often called a ribbon lost by Laumƒós. What's how they were associated with weaving. Laumƒós usually appeared in groups of three. They were able to do women‚Äôs work perfectly, as are especially skilled in weaving and spinning. They love children, respect industriousness and help those in need. They punish those who ridicule them, and those who are lazy. Following are two examples folk tales featuring Laumƒós:Of Gods and Men: Studies in Lithuanian Mythology (Folklore Studies in Translation), Algirdas J.

Rƒ´ga : Avots, 2004. 190. lpp. The woman went home at the end of the day to milk the cows and make dinner. She served her husband, who asked her \\"Where‚Äôs my son?\\" With terror, she whispered, \\"I have forgotten him!\\" She ran as fast as she could to the place in which she left her son, hearing a Laum√© speak: \\"ƒåi≈´ƒçia li≈´lia, forgotten child.\\" The mother, from the distance, asked the Laume for her child back. The fairie said, \\"Come, come, dear woman, take your child, we have done nothing to him. We know that you work very hard, at many jobs, and that you didn‚Äôt want to leave your child behind.\\" The fairies then went on to shower the babe with much treasure, enough gifts to raise several children upon. The mother went home with her precious baby and with her gifts; she was greeted with great joy. Another woman, hearing of her good fortune, was taken over by jealousy. She took to thinking, \\"I shall do the same as her, and also be showered in gifts.\\" The next evening, at dusk, she took her child, left him in the fields and went home. She ate dinner, thoughtlessly, before pausing to think of her child‚Äîand the treasure. When she approached the field, she heard the fairies, \\"ƒåi≈´ƒçia li≈´lia, you left your child in greed.\\" And the child screamed with such great pain, for he was pinched and tortured mercilessly. They continued their torture until the mother came. The fairies tossed the child at her feet. The babe was dead. =The Fairies foretell a newborn's future= A Laumƒó would come to a window and would yell, \\"Hundreds born, hundreds died, what of his fate?\\" Another would answer back, \\"Birth at night, death at night.\\" And again they would yell and moan at the window. From within another would answer, \\"This nightly birth is a big work smarter not harder, to live well whole life long.\\" Again, yelling at the window, \\"Hundreds born, hundreds dead, what of his fate?‚Äù Another answer: \\"Morning time born will be a strong worker\\". And again, after some time, begins the same questioning. The answer was \\"Noontime born is a very happy child, full of bubbles and envy for what is not strictly in accordance with wealth.\\" In Latvian mythology In Latvian mythology Lauma is an assistant at birth, assuring the health and welfare of both mother and child. If the mother does not survive or gives the child up, she takes on the role of spiritual foster mother for the child. She spins the cloth of life for the child but weeps at the fate of some. The fact that the cloth can, to a degree, weave itself, indicates a higher power than Lauma.Jonas Balys, Haralds Biezais: Baltische Mythologie.

Over the years, her image has gradually degraded. Accused of baby-snatching by disrespectful husbands (since she is unable to bear children of her own), her looks and sweetness were lost, turning her into an evil old hag.

Built in 1892 and 1870 respectively, the two buildings are good examples of late 19th-century school architecture, and the former high school is a particularly good example of Richardsonian Romanesque design. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. The high school now houses school administration offices, and the East School houses court offices. Description and history The Old Rockville High School and East School are located in the commercial downtown area of Rockville, on the north side of School Street extending eastward from the junction with Park Street. The high school is located at the corner, while the East School is separated from that building by a parking lot and parking garage. The high school is an asymmetrical masonry structure, built mainly out of red brick with granite trim. It exhibits most of the elements typical of Richardsonian Romanesque architecture, including large round-arch openings, bands of windows headed by stone lintels, and a four-story pyramidal tower. The East School is also of brick construction, but is considerably more plain, with a paired brackets in its gabled eaves, and a portico supported by paneled posts rising to rounded arches. The old high school in 2016 The East School was built in 1870, during a period of rapid growth in Rockville caused by the post-Civil War economic boom, and was designed to relieve crowding pressure on smaller district schools. The high school was built in 1892, to a design by Francis Richmond of Springfield, Massachusetts. The era in which it was built also coincided with Rockville's continuing economic prosperity, and was built to provide a higher level of education called for by the area's employers. Although it was state of the art at the time of its construction, it served the town as a high school only until 1924, and now houses school administrative offices.

The Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway (CK&PR;) was an English railway company incorporated by Act of Parliament on 1 August 1861, to build a line connecting the town of Cockermouth with the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) West Coast Main Line at Penrith. Arrangements for the use of the stations at either end (Cockermouth was already served by the Cockermouth and Workington Railway (C&WR;)) were included. Passenger and goods traffic was worked by the LNWR and mineral traffic by the North Eastern Railway, both of whom had shares in the company (the NER inheriting its holding from the Stockton and Darlington Railway, which had encouraged the promotion of the line). The line was in length, and had eight intermediate stations. Railway stations From west to east: * Cockermouth: a joint station with the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, whose original station became the joint goods station. * Embleton (initially 'Lambfoot' in local property advertisementse.g. one placed by the CK&PR; inviting tenders 'for the erection of DWELLING HOUSES adjoining the proposed stations' at Lambfoot, Peil Wyke, Braithwaite and Thelkeld: ) * Bassenthwaite Lake (initially 'Peel Wyke' in local property advertisements): the line skirted the lake for a considerable distance * Braithwaite * Keswick * Threlkeld * Troutbeck * Penruddock * Blencow * Penrith History =Background= The company had its immediate origins in a meeting at Keswick in September 1860 which agreed to promote a railway linking Keswick to existing railways at Cockermouth (to the West) and Penrith (to the East). A project for a railway linking the towns had been promoted during the Railway Mania, getting as far as a survey of the proposed route, but nothing had come of this (nor of a projected railway from Cockermouth to Windermere via Keswick). Consequently, a Keswick resident complained in 1857, \\"Here we are buried - shut out from the world, as it were - 15 hours from a morning paper while other people know at an instant what happens at the other end of the kingdom\\"letter from J.M. of Keswick printed as However, the prospectus for the company argued, what would make the line profitable was not local traffic to Keswick, but potential two-way mineral traffic between the haematite orefield of West Cumberland and the coke-ovens of South Durham.(advert.) The project was supported by the London and North Western Railway (whose line would be joined at Penrith), and by the Stockton and Darlington Railway which had been behind a series of lines engineered by Thomas Bouch which together gave access from South Durham to the West Coast Main Line at Clifton just south of Penrith. The Cockermouth and Workington Railway, with which the CK&PR; was to link at its western end, initially intended to support the CK&PR; directly, but was not in a financial position to do so; instead many of the C&W; directors took substantial shareholdings in the new line, with some sitting on its board. The company's Bill was unopposed, and its Act received its Royal Assent in August 1861. =Construction and opening= Work on the line began May 1862, the first sod being cut at Great Crosthwaite by the company chairman. The directors were able to make inspection trips to Keswick from either end of the line in May‚ÄìJune 1864; on their trip from Cockermouth they were accompanied by goods waggons, thereafter Keswick was \\"supplied with coal by rail from the Workington pits\\" (implying that the Cockermouth-Keswick section of the line was de facto open for mineral traffic). The line was officially opened for goods traffic on 1 November 1864;(advert.) mineral traffic may have been running over it from 26 October 1864. On 29 September 1864 passenger trains had been run from either end of the line to Keswick for an agricultural show there 'though the line is not yet officially open, owing to the punctilios of a certain government official' (free tickets were issued by the contractor for the line and the Cockermouth and Workington Railway lent carriages and staff). The Penrith-Keswick mail coach had ceased to run in mid-November 'being knocked off the road by ... the Railway Engine', but the railway was not officially opened for passenger traffic until 2 January 1865. Trains ran to and from a new joint station at Cockermouth. At first they merely connected there with the C&WR; service to Workington, but by April passenger trains were timetabled to work through from Penrith to Whitehaven along the CK&PR;/C&WR; route. The CK&PR; had agreed with its sponsoring railways that the LNWR was to work passenger and goods traffic on the line (receiving one-third of earnings) whilst the S&D; was to work mineral traffic (the S&D; to receive 35% of earnings, and the CK&PR; to pay for waggons). The CK&PR; also provided non- moving staff. The line was laid out by Bouch with the object of the utmost economy; although the bridges were permanent (stone and iron rather than timber trestles). The CK&PR; joined the West Coast Main Line by a north-facing junction at Penrith; trains to or from the south would have had to go to Penrith and reverse direction, had the NER not built a 'loop line' (at Red Hills, south of Penrith) giving a south to west junction. The line was single throughout; when the LNWR recommended instead that the line be built from the start as double-track, the CK&PR; board rejected this advice, preferring to delay doubling until actual receipts justified it. Furthermore, according to a pseudonymous contemporary critic, the engineering of the line, and the purchase of land made no provision for future doubling: consequently the line was \\"really a miserable affair, anything but a first-class line as it was originally boasted to be. Everything connected with it has been sacrificed to cheapness, which in this undertaking, as everyone must see, has been unquestionably carried too far. The line is single, the bridges are single; everything appertaining or belonging to it is single, and, strange to say, land has been taken up for a single line only.\\"letter signed 'An Engineer', published as With the adoption of 'absolute block' working in 1892 (at the insistence of the Board of Trade), the section between Thelkeld and Troutbeck had to be converted into two blocks (by the addition of a signal box just to the west of the Mosedale Viaduct) to prevent excessive delays . The line was eventually doubled over the heavy gradients between Threlkeld and Red Hills: doubling between Threlkeld and Troutbeck (west of the summit) was in effect by 1896; extension of this to Penruddock was undertaken in 1900, along with doubling east of the summit (Red Hills to Blencow) and was not completed until spring 1901. It had been predicted that the mineral traffic over the line would (on its own) ensure dividends of at least 5% as soon as the line opened, but this proved to have been optimistic. The line cost more to build than anticipated, and the mineral traffic was not as large as predicted. The profitability was also low; through rates were effectively governed by those set by the Maryport and Carlisle Railway. These were deliberately set by the M&C; at underpriced levels (as low as d per mile) which should have deterred the construction of competing lines.\\"no doubt there will be competition, but competition traffic does not pay\\" said an M&C; shareholder Unlike the M&CR;, the CP&KR; had severe gradients (westbound a climb of 1 in 70 between Penrith and Blencow, eastbound 1 in between Threlkeld and Troutbeck) and therefore higher running costs; a CK&PR; chairman claimed that a locomotive could haul on the M&CR; a train three times as heavy as it could haul over the CK&PR.; Nor did the CK&PR; have the lucrative local colliery traffic of the M&CR.; Passenger and goods traffic on the line were, however, sufficient to make the CK&PR; profitable; eventually passenger traffic became the main revenue as mineral traffic declined further. Technological improvements in steelmaking reduced the dependence of the British steel industry on Cumbrian haematite. Blast furnaces were established close to the orefield, and processed much of the ore locally. Although, initially, they needed to import coke to do so, later improvements in coke-making allowed them to increasingly use coke made from local coal; considerable volumes of Welsh coke also began to reach West Cumbria by sea. Increased foreign production of iron and steel meant a loss of foreign markets and over-capacity in the British iron and steel industry. Tourist traffic was a vital contributor to passenger revenue. In 1863, a shareholders' meeting authorised the expenditure of ¬£11,000 on the construction of a first-class railway hotel; such a hotel, the directors had urged, was essential if Keswick was to compete with the Scottish lochs and Switzerland. By 1865, when the hotel had been built, it was evident that the capital cost of the railway had overrun to an alarming extent; the LNWR advised strongly (and the NER concurred) that railway hotels were not profitable when run by railway companies; furthermore it was now thought that the hotel needed to be extended before anyone could run it profitably. The hotel was therefore sold to a separate company, floated for the purpose, with a considerably overlapping directorate, and with railway shareholders being given first refusal on the hotel company shares. Keswick also attracted day trips (works outings, Sunday school treats) from Carlisle and industrial West Cumberland, and was a popular venue for Temperance demonstrations, although much depended on the weather: > Soon after the departure from Carlisle the rain commenced to fall in heavy > showers, and continued throughout the whole of the day without the slightest > perceptible abatement. Between eleven and twelve o'clock the whole of the > excursion trains had arrived, and the streets of Keswick were literally > crowded by an immense concourse of people, whose wet and weary appearance > indicated the entire absence of enjoyment. It was impossible to look upon > the drifting multitude without feelings of compassion. Those local places of > interest which have given to Keswick an attractive reputation were > unvisited, and the people seemed to wander from the tea rooms to the public- > houses during the whole day ‚Ä¶ If the weather had been propitious, the > Demonstration would have proved a marked success, for seldom has such a > large number of people accompanied an excursion to Keswick.

Beyond a few expressions of sympathy with some loitering > excursionists who missed the homeward train, nothing transpired in the shape > of an accident to call forth regret save the serious weather, which reminded > many of the not altogether groundless proverb that, \\"it always rains at > Keswick\\" In return for subscribing for ¬£25,000 of CK&PR; shares, the LNWR had been granted running rights over the CK&PR; in perpetuity. Although in the LNWR 'jumped over the head of' the CK&PR; to absorb the Cockermouth and Workington Railway, and the Whitehaven Junction Railway in 1866 (almost as soon as they had been connected to the LNWR by the CK&PR;), it made no similar offer for the CK&PR; until 1890 when it offered to lease the CK&PR; for 5%. The CK&PR;'s dividend had averaged 5% over the last four years, and its board held out for 6%, which the LNWR refused to offer. The LNWR also rebuffed subsequent attempts by the CK&PR; to reopen negotiations, and the latter continued to operate as a separate company until the 1923 Grouping, when it was absorbed by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway. =Closure= The line was closed west of Keswick in April 1966. The Keswick to Penrith section followed suit in March 1972, though freight trains continued to run to Flusco and Blencow, at the eastern end of the line, until the following June. Keswick Museum and Art Gallery displays many items connected with the railway, including the barrow and spade used in the ceremony to cut the first sod for the railway on 21 May 1862, train tickets from the 19th century, and a platform guard's whistle. The development of the A66 road used much of the former track path from Cockermouth to beyond Bassenthwaite Lake. Much of the section between Keswick and Penrith, through the National Park, has been made into a cycle and walking route, and is maintained as such by the park authority. The future There is a proposal to reopen the line as a modern railway and a feasibility study has been commissioned by CKP Railways plc to examine the business case. However, Eden District Council appears to be against the reopening plan and are allowing development at Flusco Business Park to straddle the trackbed. A proposal to demolish the Mosedale Viaduct was cancelled by the British Rail Property Board in 1997 because of the plan to reinstate the line.www.waymarking.com Gives details of Mosedale Viaduct. The project to reopen the railway has been dealt some serious blows, including numerous trackbed breaches, lack of funding and the NWRDA saying the case was not strong enough compared to other much more urgent projects. During floods in 2015, three bridges were damaged or destroyed. This makes it even more unlikely that the railway will be opened once more. In January 2019, Campaign for Better Transport released a report identifying the line which was listed as Priority 2 for reopening. Priority 2 is for those lines which require further development or a change in circumstances (such as housing developments). p.42 Notes References External links * The Cockermouth, Keswick, and Penrith Railway, Cumbria * Keswick to Penrith Railway Re-opening * Briery Bobbin Mill Halt Pre-grouping British railway companies Rail transport in Cumbria Closed railway lines in North West England Railway companies established in 1861 Railway lines opened in 1865 Railway companies disestablished in 1923 London, Midland and Scottish Railway constituents 1861 establishments in England British companies established in 1861 1923 disestablishments in England British companies disestablished in 1923 ","title":"Cockermouth, Keswick and Penrith Railway"},{"id":"1794467","text":"The Gateway/Northeast 99th Avenue Transit Center, commonly known as Gateway Transit Center, is a TriMet bus transit center and light rail station on the MAX Blue, Green and Red Lines in Portland, Oregon, United States. It is the 14th stop eastbound on the current Eastside MAX. This station is where all three lines split, with Blue Line trains proceeding east to Gresham, Green Line trains proceeding south to Clackamas, and Red Line trains proceeding north to Portland International Airport. When opened in 1986, it was the busiest station on the Portland‚ÄìGresham MAX line, the only line in the system at that time, and was the terminus of 11 bus lines.Wade, Michael (November 17, 1986). \\"MAX spearheads boost in ridership\\". The Oregonian, p. B4. Currently seven bus lines serve the Gateway Transit Center. The transit center is next to the interchange of Interstate 84 and Interstate 205, and behind a Fred Meyer store in the Gateway Shopping Center. Neighborhoods served by this station include Hazelwood, Woodland Park, Parkrose Heights, Madison South and Montavilla. Platform layout Red Line train on the curved bridge south of the station View of the transit center from its parking garage. The brick buildings in the foreground house a MAX traction substation and a break room for TriMet bus drivers. The transit center includes three light rail tracks and platforms, with bus stops located on the east side of the station. The easternmost track is used by inbound (westbound) Blue and Green Line trains. Trains on this track open up doors to both the side and center platforms. The middle track is to the west of the center platform and is used by inbound Red Line trains. The westernmost track has a side platform and is used by all outbound (eastbound) trains. Inbound Red Line trains use the center track but inbound Blue and Green Line trains use the inbound main line track because of the way the Red Line junction is configured. Because the tracks going into Gateway eastbound approach from the north, running the Red Line north to the airport from Gateway would have required the operator to change cabs. To rectify the problem, TriMet created a special configuration to the Red Line junction. Inbound, the double track line becomes a single track route about 1/2 mile north of Gateway. The track runs adjacent to I-205, crosses under the main line, then swings around north on a tight horseshoe turn, and merges with the outbound track just south of Gateway. Inbound trains then use the center track switches to cross over to the inbound track. Future construction is proposed to reconfigure the junction and build separate platforms so that Red Line trains can travel straight north from Gateway without traveling through the loop. In comparison, the Green Line's junction with the Blue Line, 1/2 mile south of Gateway, is configured as a standard diverging junction. Parking at this station and transit center was originally entirely in the form of surface lots, but in June 2006 TriMet opened a new 690-space parking garage. This compensated for the closure of the surface lot closest to the station, which was replaced by a medical building. A surface lot to the south of the station, in place since the station's opening in 1986, was not affected. Bus service The transit center's west side.

History  Merstham was on a stretch of line between Croydon and Redhill which Parliament insisted should be shared by the London and Brighton Railway (L&BR;) route to Brighton, and the South Eastern Railway (SER) route to Dover.

Once the L&BR; had given way and closed their existing station at Reigate Road, Redhill, the SER opened a new station at Merstham on the present site. =South Eastern Railway station= This station was opened 4 October 1844.

For this feat, he was knighted in 1937. On the political front, he was a co-founder of the National Unionist Party which ruled the United Punjab Province in pre- independent India and kept Congress and Muslim League at bay. Early life Chhotu Ram was born as Ram Richpal in a Jat family in the village of Garhi Sampla, Rohtak district, Punjab Province. His parents were Chaudhary Sukhiram Singh Ohlian and Sarla Devi. He acquired the nickname Chhotu Ram as he was the youngest of his brothers.S.P.

When he was around eleven years of age he married Giano Devi.S.P. Sen, Dictionary of National Biography, Vol, Calcutta, 1973, p.310 He studied for his middle school examination in Jhajjar, 12 miles from his village, then enrolled in the Christian Mission School in Delhi. He passed his intermediate examination in 1903 and proceeded to St. Stephen's College, Delhi from where he graduated in 1905Sir Chhotu Ram with a distinction in Sanskrit. He gained his LLB from Agra College in 1910 and began his practice as an advocate in 1912. He started the Anglo-Sanskrit School on 26 March 1913 in Rohtak. He joined Indian National Congress in 1916. Chhotu Ram worked as the President of the Rohtak District Congress Committee from 1916 to 1920. Parts of his education were funded by the prominent Jat philanthropist Seth Chhaju Ram. Political activities After 1920, Ram tried to create a non-sectarian peasant group consciousness. He formed the Unionist Party (Zamindara League) in 1923, which was a cross-communal alliance of Hindu and Muslim agriculturists. He soon aligned with such Muslim leaders as Fazli Husain. The Unionist Party won elections in 1935 to form the provincial government in the capital at Lahore. As revenue minister, he brought in changes in the law to stop the practice of usury (charging interest on interest). Among the supporters of the party at this point were such prominent urban Muslims as Abdul Qadir.J. Henry Korson. (1974) Contemporary Problems of Pakistan.

And the Punjab Government signed only a few weeks before he died on 9 January 1945.  Political views  He studied the Bhagavad Gita and was very much influenced by its philosophy. There are many instances, which represent his value for education and compassion for the poor. A substantial portion of his salary as minister was set aside for scholarships and stipends for economically poor but bright students. The enactment of two agrarian laws was primarily due to his contribution. These were the Punjab Relief Indebtedness Act of 1934 and the Punjab Debtor's Protection Act of 1936,Abhishek Kadyan (3 January 2009) UK Indymedia ‚Äì Rahabar-i-Azam Sir Chhotu Ram ‚Äì angel for farmer.

Digging work on the Upper Ganges Canal formally began in April 1842, under the aegis of Proby Cautley, a British officer. Local works were designed and overseen by the engineer Thomas Login. Soon, Roorkee developed into a town. The canal, which was formally opened on 8 April 1854, provided irrigation waters for more than 767,000 acres (3,100 km¬≤) in 5,000 villages.Upper Ganges Canal, The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 12, p. 138. Col. P.T. Cautley, an officer in the British Army, was most instrumental in constructing the canal. According to Dept. of Hydrology the canal, which is still considered as a marvel of engineering, was built in 1853. However, water was released in the canal on 8 April 1854. To look after the maintenance of canal, the Canal Workshop and Iron Foundry were established in 1843 on the civil lines on the canal bank which is known as Irrigation workshop nowadays. This was followed by the establishment of Civil Engineering School; classes started in 1845 to train local youth to assist in the civil-engineering work of the Upper Ganges Canal.Indian Engineering Colleges, The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 4, p. 321. This was to become the first engineering college established in India. On 25 November 1847, the college was formally constituted through a proposal by the Sir James Thomason, Lt. Governor of North Western Province (1843‚Äì53). After his death in 1853, the college was rechristened as Thomason College of Civil Engineering.

Additional flavourings and attractors are also usually included in the mix. The round shape allows the baits to be catapulted accurately when fishing at range. The ability to provide a bait of a fairly large size with a hard outer skin, meant that the other species such as tench and bream were less able to consume the bait. Boiled baits also meant that they could be left longer in the water without fear that they had fallen off the hook, in the same way as bread or other traditional baits might. Though boilies are typically made and sold by large suppliers, many people choose to make their own unique homemade boilies.How to make your own boilies Boilies are now one of the most established carp baits, available in a huge range of colours and flavours. Boilies come in all different shapes and sizes, from tiny micro boilies (some even as small as eight millimetres) up to as large as 40 mm which are more suited to waters where 'nuisance fish' are present. There are buoyant boilies, commonly known as pop-ups, that are used to make the bait sit just off the bed of the lake making them easier for the fish to find and take. Pop-ups can be used in various situations, where there is weed or silt present on a lake bed, or with a normal boilie to create a 'snowman' rig, the pop-up is generally smaller than the normal boilie, this creates what is known as a critically balanced bait, or neutral buoyancy, and makes it easier for the fish to take in the bait.Pop-up baits The carp angler has many types of boiled bait to choose from, some of which have added preservatives in them so that they can be kept at room temperature on shop shelves for a long time (shelf-life bait). Boilies that lack these added preservatives need to be refrigerated or frozen to stop them from going off; these are known as freezer baits. There have been many arguments discussing the pros and cons of both freezer and shelf-life boilies but the common opinion of many carp anglers is that due to the artificial preservatives in shelf-life baits they are not as nutritionally beneficial to the carp and therefore lack some attraction. Also, since in order to keep freezer baits fresh they need to be frozen soon after being rolled, not only will the ingredients used be of a much higher quality than in shelf lives but the ingredients used to make them will not lose much of their nutrients and attraction before being used in a fishing situation (much like frozen vegetables). Due to these facts freezer baits are often much more expensive than their shelf life counterparts. The most commonly used set- up anglers use to present a boilie is a hair rig (the bait is not attached directly to the hook) which allows the boilie to sit off the back of the hook. This not only means that the bait will behave more naturally in the water (for example when disturbed by feeding fish) it also will often make the difference between a good hook hold and a bad one. Due to the nature in which a carp feeds the bait is blown out of the mouth soon after it has been picked up and the fact that the bait can move independently from the hook it allows the hook to stay back inside the mouth and find its way preferably into the bottom lip.

Life Marinoff was born in Odessa, Russia, on March 20, 1890. She was born into a Jewish household, and she was the thirteenth child and seventh daughter born to Mayer and Leah Marinoff, who died shortly after she was born. At age 6, Marinoff, who was nicknamed Fanny as a child, was smuggled onboard an overcrowded passenger ship headed to America. She arrived in Boston where she lived undernourished and uneducated. At the age of 8, Marinoff was sent to live with her older brother, Michael. While living with him and his wife, Marinoff was tortured on a regular basis. She was locked in dark rooms, which were infested with rats, for hours on end. A year later, Marinoff made her stage debut as a little boy in Cyrano de Bergerac at the El Itch Theater. This launched the beginning of what would be a 50-year career. In 1914, Marinoff married American writer and photographer Carl Van Vechten. The two were introduced through mutual friends in the summer of 1912 in New York City. Shortly after meeting, they formed a strong bond. Within the first year together, Van Vechten told Marinoff that she was more than he could have dreamed of, saying she was ‚Äúthe only one that I have ever found who completely satisfies me.‚Äù From the beginning of their relationship, Marinoff was aware of Van Vechten's homosexual desires. Although Marinoff had attained great recognition before meeting Van Vechten, once married, she found herself living in Van Vechten's shadow. To many she was known as simply ‚ÄúCarlo‚Äôs wife‚Äù. The couple played a prominent role in the Harlem Renaissance. Nella Larsen dedicated her book Passing to Marinoff and Van Vechten. Career 1903-1945 Marinoff played supporting and lead roles in dozens of Broadway plays between 1903 and 1937, seven U.S. silent movies between 1914 and 1917, and three short films in 1915.Still, J.A., & Headlee-Huffman, L.M., Just Tell the Story: Troubled Island (Flagstaff, AZ: Master-Player Library, 2006), p. 444. Marinoff was an actress and dancer for almost 50 years. Her career bloomed when she became the lead actress in the Greenwich Village Players. She was well known for her movie roles in One of Our Girls (1914), The Galloper (1915) and Life's Whirlpool (1917). On stage, she played lead in the original play Karen (1918) as well as Antony and Cleopatra (1937) and Pillars of Society (1931). During her career, she took an eight-year break because of her heavy drinking, she told an interviewer. In the last few years of her career, she volunteered at the Stage Door Canteen entertaining troops from 1942 to 1945.White, E. P., The Tastemaker: Carl Van Vechten and the Birth of Modern America (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2014), p. 287. After retiring from acting, she and her husband remained active in artistic circles.

He is sometimes called Ciar√°n the Younger to distinguish him from the 5th-century Saint Ciar√°n the Elder who was bishop of Osraige. His name produced many variant spellings, including Ceran, Kieran, Queran and Queranus. Life Ciar√°n (left) and Diarmait mac Cerbaill depicted on the Cross of the Scriptures, driving in a stake at the foundation of Clonmacnoise Ciar√°n was born in around 516 in County Roscommon, Connacht, in Ireland. His father was a carpenter and chariot maker.\\"St Ciaran of Clonmacnois\\", Orthodox Church in America As a boy, Ciar√°n worked as a cattle herder.Haggerty, Bridget. \\"St. Kieran of Clonmacnoise\\", Irish Culture and Customs He was a student of Finian's at Clonard and in time became a teacher, himself. Columba of Iona said of Ciar√°n, ‚ÄúHe was a lamp, blazing with the light of wisdom.‚Äù In about 534, he left Clonard for Inishmore where he studied under Enda of Aran, who ordained him a priest and advised him to build a church and monastery in the middle of Ireland. Later, he travelled to Senan on Scattery Island (in about 541). In 544, he finally settled in Clonmacnoise, where he founded the Monastery of Clonmacnoise with ten fellow companions. As abbot, he worked on the first buildings of the monastery; however, he died about seven months later of a plague, in his early thirties. His feast day is 9 September. Legends Various legends are connected to St Ciar√°n. One of the most famous relates that it was his cow ‚Äì which he took with him as payment when he went to Clonard and gave milk to all at the Abbey ‚Äì which supplied the parchment for the Leobr na h'Uidre, Book of the Dun Cow, one of the oldest and most important Irish literary collections, compiled by a Clonmacnoise scribe in 1106. One story tells that he lent his copy of the Gospel of St Matthew to fellow-student St Ninnidh. When Finnian tested the class, Ciar√°n knew only the first half of the Gospel. The other students laughed and called him ‚ÄúCiar√°n half-Matthew.‚Äù St Finnian silenced them and said, ‚ÄúNot Ciar√°n half-Matthew, but Ciar√°n half-Ireland, for he will have half the country and the rest of us will have the other half.‚Äù Another tale relates that as a student, a young fox would take his writings to his master, until it was old enough to eat his satchel. Yet another tale tells of the other Irish saints envying him to such a degree that every one of them (apart from St Columba) prayed for his early death; and finally, he is supposed to have told his followers that upon his death, they were to leave his bones upon the hillside, and to preserve his spirit rather than his relics. Legacy Clonmacnoise viewed from river The monastery at Clonmacnoise became one of the most important centres of learning and religious life in Ireland. Unusually, the title of abbot which included the title \\"Comarba of Saint Ciar√°n\\" at the community was not hereditary, which reflected the humble origins of its founder. It managed to survive the plunderings of the Viking raids and the Anglo-Norman wars, and was only destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, in 1552. The ruins still exist, and remain a centre of civic and religious activity to this day. The treasures of Ciar√°n's shrine were dispersed throughout the Medieval era; although the Clonmacnoise Crozier still exists and is stored in the National Museum of Ireland. The Celtic scholar Charles Plummer suggested that Ciaran of Clonmacnoise was the patron saint of Cornwall Saint Piran challenging the broadly accepted belief that he was Ciaran of Saigir. The difference in spelling is for dialect or linguistical reasons between the two Insular Celtic languages. Brytonic was categorized as P-Celtic, as it replaced the harder ‚Äòc‚Äô or k sound in the Goidelic languages with the softer letter ‚Äòp‚Äô. On the other hand, Goidelic was seen by scholars as being Q-Celtic, as the earliest Ogham inscriptions used a 'Q' transcribed by Queirt, which represented the Apple Tree to phonetically pronounce the k sound, although Q was later replaced by the letter 'C' in the Old Irish alphabet.Tree Lore:Apple, Susan Morgan Black, The Order of Bards, Ovates & DruidsThe Celts Origins and Background, Some thoughts on the Celts, Desmond Johnson, KnowthAlan Griffiths, Quiert, Ogham, Academia Saint Ciar√°n of Clonmacnoise has a strong connection with Campbeltown, Argyll and Bute in Scotland. Campbeltown was formerly known as Ceann Loch Chille Chiarain which means \\"head of the loch by the kirk of Ciar√°n\\" Pilgrims frequently take place were tourists visit a cave associated with the Saint near Island Davaar. The Saint is believed to have lived for a time in an area that would later become known as Campbeltown at the same time as the legendary king Fergus M√≥r was establishing the kingdom of the Scottish D√°l Riata, after invading Argyll from Ireland.Ian Campbell Bradley, Argyll:The making of a spiritual landscape, Saint Andrew Press, Edinburgh, 2015 A primary school in Hartstown, Dublin 15 is named after Saint Ciar√°n.

Alter ego Helliar in character as Bryan Strauchan For the 2005 AFL season, Helliar created an alter ego named Bryan Strauchan (aka \\"Strauchanie\\") who debuted on the television show Before the Game. The character was the last pick in the 2004 AFL national draft, and yet to get a game for his new club Collingwood. For the role, Helliar dons a blonde mullet wig and attempts to play up an Australian bogan stereotype. The comedy is achieved by self- effacing humour, putting Strauchan in situations that highlight his weight, lack of fitness and general inability while his egotistical personality and delusions of grandeur mean he is completely unaware of these weaknesses. The character of Strauchanie has made several subsequent appearances across different media. In the 2009 'EJ Whitten Legends' football match, Helliar broke his ankle late in the game after being tackled. He suggested that this could be the end of his career.

The station has four lines running through it: two slow lines with platforms and two express lines that have no platforms. The ticket office is open weekdays from 6:30 am to 10:30 am. There is an on-demand service announcement facility. A PERTIS machine is provided. Journey times are around 45 minutes to London, 25 to Croydon, 7 to Redhill and Gatwick Airport, 10 to Crawley and 20 to Horsham.  History  Salfords station was originally built in 1915 for workers at the Monotype Corporation, which had constructed a factory next to the railway line in 1899. From its opening on 8 October 1915 the train service was not advertised and sparse to meet the needs of Monotype Corporation staff. On 17 July 1932 the line was electrified on 750dc third rail and concurrently the station was served by a regular advertised train service. The station name, originally Salfords Halt, was simplified to Salfords on 1 January 1935. Day Aggregates made use of the open land beside the station to store and transport their loose stones for construction in the area for some time. The sidings used still exist, including a bay platform at the station and most of the machinery used to expel and fill the wagons that transported the stone at the site. Network Rail have a site at the back of platform 1, using it as a base for the continuing improvements to the Brighton main line, in between Selhurst traincare depot and the Three Bridges engineering depot. On 14 January 2008, the station received a minor upgrade. This involved the replacing of the wooden huts with modern glass waiting areas and the installation of dynamic digital displays with information about the next train. Southeastern ceased to serve the station from December 2008. A second PERTIS machine was installed at the entrance to the Horley-bound platform by 2008. Help points were installed in February 2011 to both platforms. The PERTIS machine on platform one has been replaced in August 2011 by the installation of quick ticket machine on this platform to facilitate buying of tickets out of hours.

It is mainly associated with boilies, but also works effectively with many other baits. The hair rig became popular in the 1980s and was a joint invention by Kevin Maddocks and Len Middleton. It has been experimented with by many anglers, and has revolutionised carp fishing. At the beginning, natural hair (from Len's head) was used to attach the bait to the hook after many 'tank test' experiments with captive carp and other materials. Before that all sorts of other materials were tried but a human hair worked from the start. This is why it was called the 'hair rig'. This material was very discreet and the carp seemed unaware of it when picking up a bait attached to it and also taking in the hook, but it was a little fragile. In tests, the carp only took the free offerings and left the hook bait if the bait was not attached to a 'hair'. Human hair was also a problem because anglers sometimes lost their baits while they were casting. These problems have been solved with the appearance of braided thread, a new material that allows threads to be as discreet as natural ones but more resistant to breaking. Many believe however, that the whole concept works, because the hook is NOT buried in the bait or boilie and due to the carp sucking and blowing, the sharp hook point catches in the mouth or lips. A heavy semi-fixed lead (2 ozs upwards) then pulls the hook into the flesh and usually the fish bolts off in alarm, so effectively this is a self hooking rig, with no need for the angler to 'strike' as in the past. Many variations of the 'Hair' are now used by carp anglers and most of these are not like original 'hairs' at all, but 'Hook Out' rigs designed to allow the bare hook to catch in the mouth or lips.

Swithland Wood is a Nature Conservation Review site, Grade II. The Brand is designated a Precambrian site in the Geological Conservation Review site, but the dating has been changed due to the discovery of trace fossils from the succeeding Cambrian period. Swithland Wood is a public woodland in Charnwood Forest, in Leicestershire. Although close to the village of Swithland, it is almost entirely within the parish of Newtown Linford. It is just north of Bradgate Park and also near Woodhouse Eaves and Cropston. The wood is Leicestershire's most important ancient woodland for nature conservation. Quarries within the wood were a source of the distinctive Swithland Slate roofs found on many local buildings as well as the slate gravestones common in Leicestershire churchyards. Swithland Wood has been a public woodland since 1925, upon its acquisition by the Leicester Rotary Club, having previously been part of the estate of the manor of Groby. Since 1931 it has been managed by the Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood Trust. Ancient Woodland Swithland Wood is classed as Ancient semi-natural woodland. Medieval ridge and furrow shows that most of the area was once cleared of trees, and used for growing crops. Documentary evidence of its use as woodland dates back to 1512 by which time at least part of the site was established woodland. It was probably not 'planted', but simply recolonised the soon-abandoned farmland. However it has been woodland continuously since then, primarily managed through coppicing. It was subdivided into compartments known by various names: Great Lynds, Little Lynds, Dunham Lynns, Hollgates Wood, Slate Pit Hey and Slate Pit Hill. The woodland was part of the Grey family's Bradgate Estate throughout their time as earls of Stamford. In 1880 they had 26 woodlands on the Bradgate Estate and these were an integrated part of the Grey estates throughout the 17th to 19th centuries. The earliest known use of the name 'Swithland Wood' is in a schedule of 1772. The name now covers all of the Grey estate woodlands on this site. Adjoining the woods on the east are two areas of woodland in Swithland Parish, historically known as Stocking Wood and Whites Wood. These were part of the estates of the Danvers family, and then the earls of Lanesborough. These two woods remain private, and are not part of the Swithland Wood public woodland, although they are part of the designated SSSI.http://www.english- nature.org.uk/Special/sssi/unitlist.cfm?sssi_id=1003912 Slate Quarrying Swithland Slate has been a traditional local roofing material since Roman times. Swithland gives its name to a line of 'slate' outcrops found along the east side of Charnwood, from Hallgates and Little John, through Swithland Wood and The Brand, up to Woodhouse Eaves. All these locations have old slate quarry pits, as does a corresponding outcrop on the other side of the Charnwood anticline at Groby. Swithland Wood had been quarried for many centuries for small-scale slate production. Many of the 24 small pits in Swithland Wood may relate to early slate quarrying. Unlike the management of the woodland, the quarries were leased to local quarrymen. Two industrial scale quarries developed within the woods, one in the 'Great Pit' in the centre of the woods, and the other near the road at the northern end. Similar scales of activity also developed on the other side of Swithland Road, in The Brand, where four more water-filled pits remain. By the mid-19th century under the management of John Ellis of Leicester, among other things Chairman of the Midland Railway, slate in the Great Pit was being extracted from a depth of more than 180 ft (55 m). Swithland Slate began being used on vernacular roofs from around 1750 and is still very common on older buildings throughout Charnwood and beyond. Unlike the thinner, lighter Welsh Slates, which are used with fixed sized slates, Swithland Slate roofs are graded from small slates along the ridge to largest sizes at the base. Notable buildings on which the slates were used included the Midland Railway's London terminus at St Pancras railway station and the Leicester houses designed by Ernest Gimson. Headstones for graves have been made from Swithland Slate since the 17th century and are found in graveyards throughout Leicestershire and in neighbouring counties, especially Nottinghamshire. They could be engraved with detailed letterings and patterns, which prove to be much more durable than on many other types of stone. Other uses included kerbstones, windowsills and sinks. Once the canals and railways could transport Welsh slate in large quantities at low prices, the demand for local slates diminished. Quarrying in the northern pit ended in 1838, and then in 1887 the Great Pit ceased production. Both pits now have deep water and are fenced off for safety reasons, but paths around the quarries afford good views of the pools and rock faces. The Great Pit is used occasionally for scuba diving.http://www.ukdiveguide.com/swithland-quarry.html Public Woodland Stream running through Swithland Wood Bluebells in Swithland Wood After the closing of the quarries the area continued to be an important woodland resource, with active timber management and planting by the Grey Estate. However in 1921, as part of a wholesale disposal of the Bradgate Estate lands, the woods, along with two local farms, were bought by William Gimson. Two adjacent areas of woodland totalling 137 acres (554,000 m¬≤) were offered to the Rotary Club of Leicester in order to preserve these important ancient woodlands and provide public access for the benefit of the people of Leicester and Leicestershire in perpetuity. A Charitable Trust was established and a fund-raising appeal raised ¬£6,000 (more than half of it from members of the Rotary Club itself) which covered not only the ¬£3,000 purchase price but also renewed fencing, woodland management works and public access facilities. The Rotary Club employed rangers and managed the country park directly for seven years. On the rock face of the Great Pit is an inscription recording the Rotary Club's donation which reads \\"The Leicester Rotary Club Secured Swithland Wood For A National Heritage\\". The area is notable in spring for its bluebells and other spring flowering bulbs which cover large areas of the woodland floor. In 1927 the Rotary Club, in partnership with Swithland Parish Church, initiated an annual Bluebell Service by the Great Pit, and this tradition continues, with the Bluebell Service being held on the afternoon of the third or fourth Sunday of April. In 1928 a leading Leicester businessman, Charles Bennion, similarly bought the adjacent and larger Bradgate Park for preservation and the public benefit, vested in a Charitable Trust supported by the Leicester and Leicestershire City and County Councils and the National Trust. In 1931, with the Bradgate Park Trust fully established, the Rotary Club offered to merge Swithland Wood with Bradgate Park. This was readily agreed by all parties and the two Trusts were combined as the Bradgate Park and Swithland Wood Trust. Since then Swithland Woods has been managed by the Trust rather than the Rotary Club, open to the public, and greatly appreciated for its conservation and leisure value. Site of Special Scientific Interest According to Natural England: \\"The site includes some of the best remaining examples of oak-lime and alder woodland in Leicestershire and is representative of ancient woodland on somewhat acid, loamy soils in the English Midlands.\\" Swithland Wood has received a blend of continuity and disruption in its management that has stimulated its diversity of plant life, whilst allowing complex ecosystems to survive and develop. The disruptions include the quarries, substantial periods of felling in the 19th century, construction of a water main across the site, clearing back of rides and paths, and the arrival of countless tramping feet. Each of these has impacted on some of the trees and plants, but created additional habitats, allowing other species to become established. But as a whole, Swithland Wood has had great continuity, at least since the medieval ploughing ceased. The woods themselves are mixed, principally mature oak, ash, lime and holly. These have been the predominant species for many hundred years, and on the rockiest places have probably always been there. This provides the continuity that has enabled such richness to develop. The result is a woodland with a Flora Score = 147, the highest score of any of the Leicestershire and Rutland woodlands., ahead of Owston Woods (132) and Burley Wood (125). Geology The ancient rocks that characterise Charnwood Forest are an eroded anticline - the layers of sediment built up on a sea floor were uplifted some 420 million years ago, at the end of the Silurian Period. This created a dome, the top of which was eroded to expose successively more ancient rocks. The oldest rocks are found at the northern core, at Blackbrook Reservoir, while Swithland Wood lies on the south-eastern edge of the anticline. The Swithland Slates and other rocks of the 'Brand Group' are the most recent of the Charnian rocks. For most of the 20th century they had been classified as Precambrian rocks along with the more central Charnwood outcrops.Evans, A.M., (1968) Charnwood Forest, in Sylvester-Bradley P. C. and Ford T. D. (ed), The Geology of the East Midlands, Leicester University Press. p.7 This would have dated them to around 545 million years ago. However, recent discoveries of trace fossils, evidence of animals burrowing in the soft mud that became the Swithland Slate, have reclassed all of the Brand Group rocks as Cambrian, formed around 530 million years ago. Although the Charnwood Precambrian rocks have the internationally significant fossils of the frond-like lifeforms of Charnia species, clear evidence of trace fossils of burrowing animal life places the Swithland Formation firmly in the Cambrian Period. Some of these trace fossils can be seen on Swithland Slate headstones, such as those in Ratby churchyard. The mud that became Swithland Slate was deposited in great quantity on the sea bed, after the more dramatic Precambrian volcanic activity had subsided. It was very fine sediment resulting in fine-grained evenly bedded material. Subsequent deposits above it, combined with the uplifting of the anticline, produced the heat and pressure which turned the mud into hard rock (Lithification). The tensions created during uplift are what created the cleavage plane in the slates, and it is along these cleavage joints (rather than the bedding planes) that the slates are split to create roof slates. With the Charnwood area uplifted into a high mountain range, the processes of erosion began. By the Triassic Period, (240 million years ago) the mountains were eroded down to something like their current height. There then began a new deposition, this time of desert sand and fine dust, that produced a new layer of soft red marl, creating the gentler rolling appearance of the land, with just the tips of the older rocks reaching the surface. Over most of Swithland Wood the marl is the surface rock type (although the slate beds will occur underneath that). Finally, during the ice age, glacial erosion stripped back the Triassic material (plus whatever had accumulated above that), to re- expose the eroded peaks of the older rocks. At the end of the ice age, patches of boulder clay were deposited over much of the local area, including parts of Swithland Wood. Access Swithland Wood is open to the public during daylight hours. There are pay and display car parks on Roecliffe Road at and on Swithland Road at .http://www.lros.org.uk/charnwood.htm accessed 23 March 2011 There is also access via a footpath from near the Hallgates entrance to Bradgate Park .

Computer graphics can be classified into distinct categories: raster graphics and vector graphics, with further 2D and 3D variants. Many graphics programs focus exclusively on either vector or raster graphics, but there are a few that operate on both. It is simple to convert from vector graphics to raster graphics, but going the other way is harder. Some software attempts to do this. In addition to static graphics, there are animation and video editing software. Different types of software are often designed to edit different types of graphics such as video, photos, and vector-based drawings. The exact sources of graphics may vary for different tasks, but most can read and write files. Most graphics programs have the ability to import and export one or more graphics file formats, including those formats written for a particular computer graphics program. Examples of such programs include GIMP, Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW, Pizap, Microsoft Publisher, Picasa, etc. The use of a swatch is a palette of active colours that are selected and rearranged by the preference of the user. A swatch may be used in a program or be part of the universal palette on an operating system. It is used to change the colour of a text or image and in video editing. Vector graphics animation can be described as a series of mathematical transformations that are applied in sequence to one or more shapes in a scene. Raster graphics animation works in a similar fashion to film-based animation, where a series of still images produces the illusion of continuous movement. This software enables the user to create illustrations, designs, logos, 3-dimensional images, animation and pictures.  History  SuperPaint (1973) was one of the earliest graphics software applications. Fauve Matisse (later Macromedia xRes) was a pioneering program of the early 1990s, notably introducing layers in customer software.Macromedia Matisse , Reign of Toads Currently Adobe Photoshop is one of the most used and best-known graphics programs in the Americas, having created more custom hardware solutions in the early 1990s, but was initially subject to various litigation.

It is down the line from , measured via , on the Arun Valley Line and the Sutton & Mole Valley Lines, and train services are provided by Southern. Services on the Sutton & Mole Valley Line from London Victoria via Dorking terminate here, the others continue into the Arun Valley: a half-hourly service from London Victoria to or (alternating) and . These trains usually divide here with the front (Southampton/Portsmouth) portion travelling fast (next stop ) and the rear (Bognor Regis) half providing stopping services. A new Thameslink service (TL5) entered service in March 2018, running from Horsham to Peterborough (via Redhill). This now connects London Bridge, Farringdon and Kings Cross St Pancras in central London, through north London, to Huntingdon and Peterborough.  History  Horsham would have been an important midway point in two of the original proposals for a London to Brighton railway via the Adur valley but in the event Sir John Rennie's proposed direct line through Three Bridges (in east Crawley) and Haywards Heath was given parliamentary approval. As a result, the original Horsham station was the terminus of a single track branch line from Three Bridges opened by the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LBSCR) in February 1848. The down line from Horsham railway station. Between 1859 and 1867, the station was enlarged on several occasions to coincide with the doubling of the branch line from Three Bridges; the extension of the railway from Horsham along the Arun Valley Line; the opening of new lines from Horsham to Shoreham via Steyning and from Christ's Hospital to Guildford. Finally, in 1867, a new route to Dorking, Leatherhead and thence to London, was opened. The station was again partially rebuilt and resignalled, with three signal boxes, in 1875. RCTS Sussex Rail Tour in 1962 The present station was built by the Southern Railway in the International Modern Style in 1938 to coincide with the electrification of the line. The building was designed by James Robb Scott and is grade II listed, see external links below. The lines to Guildford and Shoreham both fell victim to the Beeching Axe in the mid 1960s, the former being closed to passengers on 14 June 1965 and the latter on 7 March 1966. In September 2011, the station frontage was closed to undergo extensive refurbishment work to the main ticket hall. It reopened late in 2012 with a new side entrance, internal lift access, relocated barriers and stairway, a new ticket office, and new information screens. The platforms received a rebuild of the roofing and refurbished waiting rooms. Previously, the building was shared with Henfield Hire, who vacated in order to give the floor space needed to create the new features and new ceiling and lights and so completing a complete reconfiguration of the layout.  Accidents and incidents  *On 9 January 1972, an engineers train overran signals and was in a rear-end collision with an electric multiple unit at the station. Fifteen people were injured. The crew of the engineers train had failed to check their brakes on departure from and thus failed to discover that the isolation cock between the two locomotives had not been opened.  Services  Services are operated by Southern and Thameslink. As of May 2020, the off-peak service is: * 2 tph to London Victoria via * 1 tph to London Victoria via and Sutton * 2 tph to via , London Bridge and * 1 tph to (non- stop to ) * 1 tph to (non-stop to ) * 2 tph to (1 semi-fast fast, 1 all- stations) On Sundays, the service to London Victoria via Epsom does not run. In addition, the service to Peterborough is reduced to 1 tph and only runs as far as London Bridge. Mainline services are reduced to 1 tph with no service to Southampton and trains dividing at Barnham instead of Horsham.  Motive power depot  A small wooden motive power depot was built at the station in 1876.Turner (1979), p.66. This was replaced by a brick-built ten-road semi- roundhouse together with a 46 ft (14 metre) turntable in 1880. This in turn was extended with a further eight-roads in 1900. In 1927 the Southern Railway installed a 55 ft (16.8 metre) turntable. This depot was closed in 1964. p.45.  Signalbox  Nearby is the type 13 signal box dating from 1938, which is also Grade II listed.

Forms =Pallone col bracciale= Pallone col bracciale team, middle 19th century Pallone col bracciale or simply bracciale was particularly popular throughout Italy and it was considered the most popular sport of ancient Italian national sports since the 16th century and its first official regulations invented by Antonio Scaino from Sal√≤ date back to 1555. This sport and its champions were described by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Karl Philipp Moritz, Christian Joseph Jagemann, Richard Colt Hoare, Jacob Burckhardt, William Wetmore Story, Giacomo Leopardi, Edmondo de Amicis, Giuseppe Baretti, Antonio Francesco Grazzini, Ottavio Rinuccini, Gabriello Chiabrera, Tommaso Grossi, Giuseppe Gioachino Belli. Bracciale was played also in France, Germany, Austria, England, Netherlands and famous Italian champions organized tournaments in USA, Argentina, Egypt. Where Angels Fear to Tread (1991) includes a brief film depiction of this game. Balls are struck back and forth with a wooden cylinder, called a bracciale, worn over the forearm: if carelessly played, a broken arm can result because a bracciale weighs 1 to 2 kilograms. Originally the ball was inflated, but now a hard rubber ball is used: this ball has circumference of 39 centimetres and weighs 350 grams (originally 750 grams). Scoring is by fifteens and tens, as in tennis, in this manner: 15 ‚Äì 30 ‚Äì 40 ‚Äì 50 or victory of a game but early was 15 ‚Äì 30 ‚Äì 45 ‚Äì 60; the team which wins 12 games is final winner of the match. A notable feature is that the ball is put into play by a designated server, called the mandarino, who otherwise is not part of the game. The receivers can reject serves at will. Pallone is often played on courts marked out on town streets. Four kinds of pallone are now played: *it is played in particular sports venue called sphaeristerium, or in Italian sferisteri, 80 metres long and 18 metres wide with a lateral wall which is 20 metres high and permits the rebound of the ball. In this version each team has 3 players: battitore, spalla and terzino *it is played in an open playing field without lateral walls. In this version each team has 4 players: battitore, spalla and 2 terzino *it is played by 2 players versus other 2 players with a net (device) in central position of court *it is played by 1 solo player versus other 1 solo player with a net in central position of court. =Pallapugno= Pallapugno, or formerly pallone elastico, is a game originally played in Piedmont and Liguria with a bandaged fist. This sport and its champions were described by Cesare Pavese, Beppe Fenoglio, Giovanni Arpino. In the second half of the 20th century a championship was organized in California and played during various years. The professional Italian pallapugno league is the top level of competition: in 2008 ten teams competed.List of professional teams Each team has four players. The court, or sferisterio, is 90 metres long and 18 metres wide; the rubber ball has a diameter of 10.5 centimetres and weighs 190 grams. Scoring is also by fifteens and tens in every game, but a second bounce can result in a \\"chase\\" rather than an outright point, similar to real tennis; the team which wins 11 games is the winner of the match. Rubber pallapugno ball =Pallapugno leggera= Pallapugno leggera is played in a court the same size of a volleyball court, but without a net. Each team has 4 players with 2 reserve players. A match consists of one set or three sets. This game is played in all Italian 20 regions and they dispute regular championship. =Pantalera= Pantalera or pallapugno alla pantalera is generally played on urban streets. The first action of every match consists of playing the ball onto a roof called the pantalera in Piedmontese language. Other rules are the same as pallapugno. =Hit ball= This form was invented by Italian physical education teacher Luigi Gigante in 1986 and in 1992 started a regular championship. Each team has 5 players and there are 2 goals at ends of court. =Pallonetto= Pallonetto or pallonetto ligure al lungo is generally played on urban streets with tennis balls without covering felt.

Envelope Building, is a former industrial facility located at 121 West Main Street in the Rockville section of Vernon, Connecticut. Developed in stages between 1864 and 1916, it exhibits changes in mill construction technology over that period, include a rare early example of Second Empire architecture. Now converted into senior housing, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The former Florence Mill complex is located in Vernon's industrial Rockland section, on the south side of West Main Street opposite its junction with Ward Street. It is set on of land between West Main Street and the Hockanum River, which historically provided its power. Its main building is a four-story brick structure, more than in length, with a Second Empire-style mansard roof and an Italianate tower. To this are appended a number of later buildings, also built out of brick, with later industrial Italianate features. The Florence Mill was built in 1864 to replace an earlier textile mill which was destroyed by fire. In 1881, it was described as the largest brick building in Rockville, and continued in the production of textiles. It was purchased in 1881 by White & Corbin, who expanded the building several times, making it the largest manufacturing plant in the United States for the manufacture of envelopes. The building was used for this purpose by White & Corbin and its successors (including the U. S. Envelope Company), until 1975. Currently, the building is used as an independent living retirement home and has 113 apartments.

Although English monarchs have long sponsored their own theatrical companies and commissioned theatrical performances, the first Royal Command Performance to bear that name was staged at Windsor Castle in 1848 by order of Queen Victoria. From then on, command performances were frequently staged, often calling upon the leading actors from the London theatres, until the death of Prince Albert in 1861. There were no further command performances until they recommenced in 1881. These included plays, revues, comic operas and other musical theatre. King Edward VII called for several performances each year. In 1911 a Great 'Gala' performance was given by the theatrical profession at His Majesty's Theatre in London in celebration of the coronation of King George V. In 1912, King George V and Queen Mary attended an all-star Royal Command Performance at London's Palace Theatre in aid of the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, and the following year it was decided to make the evening an annual event. 1919 saw the first event to be named the Royal Variety Performance, and a variety of entertainment, including music (of all genres), comedy, dance, music-hall and speciality acts were included. The monarch or a senior member of the British Royal attends event each year, and the event continues as a fundraiser for the Royal Variety Charity. The Royal Variety Performance attracts over 150 million worldwide television viewers annually. Early history As long as there has been a monarchy, kings and queens have maintained minstrels and jesters to entertain their courts, and these performances could be called \\"command performances\\".Gillan, Don. A History of the Royal Command Performance, StageBeauty.net, accessed 16 June 2009 The history of the command performance as we recognise it today dates back at least to the time of Queen Elizabeth I, during whose reign the first permanent theatre was built. In addition, Elizabeth built her own theatre where she could watch plays performed by her own company of players. This was formed in 1583 by Edmund Tilney, the then Master of the Revels, and was known as Queen Elizabeth's Men. Later British monarchs continued the tradition of sponsoring their own theatrical companies until the dissolution of the monarchy, with its subsequent abolition of the theatre, during the Protectorship of Oliver Cromwell. The restoration of the monarchy following the death of Cromwell also resulted in the restoration of the relationship between the monarch and theatre. Modern British command performances The Gondoliers performed before Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle in 1891 At the beginning of Queen Victoria's reign in 1837 the command performance was an established part of Britain‚Äôs theatrical life. The first Royal Command Performance as we know it today is generally accepted to have been that staged at Windsor Castle on 28 December 1848 by order of Queen Victoria. The play was The Merchant of Venice, and the cast included Mr and Mrs Charles Kean, Mr and Mrs Keeley, Henry Lowe, Leigh Murray and Alfred Wigan. From then on, command performances were frequently staged, often calling upon the leading actors from the London theatres and their supporting casts, until the death of Prince Albert in December 1861. There were no further command performances until they recommenced on 4 October 1881 with a production of Burnand's The Colonel. Queen Victoria called for a command performance of W. S. Gilbert's play Sweethearts (together with Uncle's Will) on 1 February 1887, starring Mr and Mrs Kendal. The great Shakespearean actors Henry Irving and Ellen Terry performed for the Queen in 1889 and 1893. In 1891, the Queen enjoyed two performances by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company of Gilbert and Sullivan operas, namely The Gondoliers on 6 March 1891 at Windsor CastleThe Gondoliers, The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company official website, accessed 16 June 2009 and The Mikado on 4 September 1891 at Balmoral. Performances of operas by the Royal Opera Company and the Carl Rosa Opera Company were given on several occasions in the 1890s for Victoria. On 21 July 1896 the first Royal Command Film Performance was held at Marlborough House. The film showed the Prince of Wales and Princess Alexandra visiting the Cardiff Exhibition. When Birt Acres, the cinematographer, requested permission to show the film to the general public the Prince asked to see it himself before agreeing. The film was screened before forty royal guests in a specially erected marquee along with a collection of other short films. King Edward VII called for several performances per year. These included Quality Street by the company of husband and wife stars Ellaline Terriss and Seymour Hicks and plays by Sir Charles Wyndham's company and Arthur Bourchier's company. Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree's company played for both Victoria and Edward during their respective reigns. On 27 June 1911 a Great 'Gala' performance was given by the theatrical profession at His Majesty's Theatre in London in celebration of the coronation of King George V. The proceeds from this event were used to found the 'King George's Pension Fund for Actors and Actresses'. A second Royal Command Performance was held on 1 July 1912, featuring many of the leading stars of the theatre and music halls, in aid of the Variety Artistes' Benevolent Fund, now the Royal Variety Charity. From 1913, it was decided to make this a regular annual 'all-star' event to continue contributing to the fund. The 1913 show was a production of the Dion Boucicault comedy London Assurance at St James's Theatre on 27 June 1913 and raised ¬£1,093. These events are now called Royal Variety Performances. 1919 saw the first event to be named the Royal Variety Performance. The reason for the name change followed desire from Buckingham Palace that the show should 'clearly reflect all areas of show business popular amongst the masses of the time'. Hence, a variety of entertainment, including music (of all genres), comedy, dance, music-hall and speciality acts, rather than for it be incorrectly perceived as one reflecting the Royal Family's own specific choice of artistes. King George V became patron of the Royal Variety Charity in 1921 and decreed that the monarch or a senior member of the British Royal family would attend an annual event in aid of the Royal Variety Charity and its care home for elderly entertainers, Brinsworth House, once a year thereafter. This tradition and fundraising event for the Royal Variety Charity, continues to the present day, with the Royal Variety Performance now attracting over 150 million worldwide television viewers, making it the longest running and most successful entertainment show in the world.

He stood down at the 2017 general election, following the announcement of Theresa May's snap election in June 2017. Early life Jim Dowd grew up in Lewisham, London, with an Irish father and German mother. He was educated at the Dalmain Infant and Junior Schools in Forest Hill; the Sedgehill Comprehensive School, Catford, and the London Nautical School, Lambeth. He began his career in telephone engineering as an apprentice in 1967 with the General Post Office (GPO). Following his apprenticeship, he became a manager in 1972 at a Heron petrol station for a year before joining Plessey as a telecommunications engineer in 1973, where he remained until his election to the House of Commons. Dowd was elected as a councillor in the London Borough of Lewisham in 1974, becoming deputy leader in 1984 for two years. He was twice deputy mayor in 1987 and 1990, and was the Mayor of Lewisham in 1992. He stepped down from the council in 1994. Dowd first stood for parliament at the 1983 general election for the seat of Beckenham, finishing in third place behind the long-standing Conservative MP Philip Goodhart by 17,330 votes. At the 1987 general election he contested the marginal seat of Lewisham West, but was defeated by John Maples by 3,772 votes. Parliamentary career At the 1992 general election, Dowd again contested Lewisham West, and defeated Maples by 1,809 votes. He made his maiden speech in the House of Commons on 10 June 1992. Jim Dowd was appointed as an opposition whip in 1994, before becoming the spokesman on Northern Ireland in 1995. Following the election of the Labour government at the 1997 General Election he was given a place in the Blair government as a whip. He was unexpectedly sacked after the 2001 general election, since when he was a member of the Health Select Committee and maintained a voting record strongly in line with government policies. In June 2012, Dowd joined the Science and Technology Select Committee. In 2005, he was involved in a heated confrontation in Parliament with fellow Labour MP Bob Marshall-Andrews over the Terrorism Bill. He was a vice-chair of the All Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group. He supported Owen Smith in the failed attempt to replace Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election. =Intellectual Property Bill= On 20 January 2014, Dowd made a speech in the House of Commons during a debate on the Intellectual Property Bill, stating that he had asked for Worcester Sauce whilst eating a meal at the Hare and Billet pub in Blackheath and that he was provided with Henderson's Relish. Dowd used Henderson's as an example of \\"parasitic packaging\\", implying in the debate that it was attempting to pass itself off as Lea and Perrins. Henderson's Relish is well known within Sheffield and parts of Yorkshire and has been manufactured there for over 100 years. Dowd upset supporters of the sauce; the Sheffield Central member of parliament, Paul Blomfield, offered to bring a bottle to Parliament and invite Dowd for a meal with him using it ‚Äì an invitation accepted by Dowd. The Hare and Billet Simon Freemanthe managing director of Henderson'sjokingly stated that he would order \\"an internal investigation to find out how it got out of Yorkshire\\"; a local newspaper, the Sheffield Star, launched a Twitter campaign with the hashtag #Hendogate to defend Henderson's, attracting support locally. Dowd later stated his \\"amazement\\" at the backlash his comments had caused, which he said included threats of violence. The assistant manager of the Hare and BilletAdam Beastonclaimed that Dowd branded Henderson's a \\"blatant copy\\" of Lea and Perrins at the time but that he warned the MP that such a view would be \\"blasphemy in Sheffield\\". Personal life Dowd lists his interests as music, theatre and reading, and enjoys travelling in Cornwall. His partner Janet Anderson is the former Labour MP for Rossendale and Darwen.

The Institution was housed in a building in Mosley Street designed by Charles Barry in 1824. Construction of the building began in 1825, and was completed in 1835, at a cost of ¬£30,000. A Grade I listed building, it is his only public building in the Greek neo-classical style. The Institution held regular art exhibitions, collected works of fine art and promoted the arts generally from the 1820s until 1882, when the building and its collections were transferred under Act of Parliament to Manchester Corporation, becoming Manchester Art Gallery. In the basement a laboratory was installed by Lyon Playfair who worked there briefly as Professor of Chemistry after he left Thomson's of Clitheroe. He was succeeded by Frederick Crace Calvert who made phenol which was used by Joseph Lister as an antiseptic. The first school of design in Manchester was accommodated in the building from 1838. The school was renamed the school of art in 1853 which became a sectional department of the Royal Manchester Institution. In 1892 it became the Municipal School of Art.Hartwell, Clare (2001) Manchester. (Pevsner Architectural Guides.) London: Penguin Books, p. 131 In the 1880s it moved to premises in Cavendish Street, Chorlton on Medlock, which it still occupies as part of the Manchester Metropolitan University. The latter building was designed by G. T. Redmayne (1880-81) and is now known as the Grosvenor Building of the Metropolitan University.Hartwell (2001), p. 131 The Manchester School of Art undertook teaching at various levels and became a central institution serving a wide area around Manchester. Two branches of activity were undertaken, the training of creative artists, and the training of trade craftsmen. The resources of the school included well equipped studios and workrooms, a museum of applied art and a library. The school conferred the diploma of associateship on successful students, and also prepared students for diplomas conferred by other bodies including the Board of Education's scheme for training art teachers.The Book of Manchester and Salford.

Playing career Born in Grange-over- Sands, Lancashire, Crayston played for local school sides and Ulverston Town before moving to Third Division North Barrow in 1928. He spent two seasons there before moving to Second Division Bradford (Park Avenue), where he developed into a strong and aerially powerful right-half. Despite breaking both his wrist and leg in 1933‚Äì34, Crayston was signed by First Division champions Arsenal in 1934 as a replacement for Charlie Jones. He scored on his competitive debut in an 8‚Äì1 thrashing of Liverpool on 1 September 1934 and became a regular in the Arsenal side straight away, largely pushing Frank Hill out of the right-half spot. With Arsenal he won the League championship in 1934‚Äì35 and 1937‚Äì38, and the FA Cup in 1935‚Äì36. During this time, Crayston also became an England international; he made his debut in a 3‚Äì1 win against Germany on 4 December 1935, and in all won eight caps for his country between 1935 and 1937, scoring one goal. His final cap came in a 5‚Äì4 win against Czechoslovakia on 1 December 1937. Coaching and management career Like many of his contemporaries, the Second World War robbed Crayston of what should have been the peak of his career; he joined the Royal Air Force whilst still playing irregular wartime football. However, a serious knee injury in a wartime match against West Ham United in 1943 forced Crayston to retire from playing. He played 207 matches in total (168 league matches), scoring 17 goals (16 league goals). After his premature retirement and demobbing from the RAF, Crayston moved into coaching, and in June 1947 he became assistant to new Arsenal manager Tom Whittaker. After Whittaker's death in 1956, Crayston became caretaker manager on 24 October 1956 and permanent manager on 21 December 1956. However, his stewardship of the team was brief and unsuccessful; unable to bring any new players in, the team started to decline. In 1957‚Äì58 Arsenal slipped to 12th in the League (their worst position for 38 years) and faced a humiliating FA Cup defeat at the hands of Third Division South Northampton Town. Disillusioned, in May 1958 he resigned as Arsenal manager, and took up the reins at Doncaster Rovers a couple of months later, holding the post until his retirement from the game in 1961. He died in 1992, at the age of 82.

Samuel the Prince) (born 993; died after 1056), was a medieval Spanish Talmudic scholar, grammarian, philologist, soldier, merchant, politician, and an influential poet who lived in Iberia at the time of the Moorish rule. His poetry was one area through which he was well known. He was perhaps the most politically influential Jew in Muslim Spain.Stillman, Norman A. The Jews of Arab Lands: A History and Source Book, The Jewish Publication Society of America,1979. 56 Life Samuel ibn Naghrillah was an Andalusian Jew born in M√©rida in 993. He studied Jewish law and became a Talmudic scholar who was fluent in both Hebrew and Arabic. He started his life as a shopkeeper and merchant in C√≥rdoba.Marcus, Jacob Rader. \\"59: Samuel Ha-Nagid, Vizier of Granada.\\" The Jew in the Medieval World: A Source Book, 315-1791. Cincinnati: Union of American Hebrew Congregations, 1938. 335-38. However, civil war broke out in 1009 against the Amirid Kingdom and Berbers took the city in 1013, forcing him to flee from C√≥rdoba. In M√°laga, he started a spice shop. His relations with the Granada royal court, and his eventual promotion to the position of vizier, happened in a coincidental manner. Jacobs, pulled from the Sefer Seder ha-kabbalah this interesting account. The shop he set up was near the palace of the vizier of Granada, Abu al-Kasim ibn al-Arif. The vizier met Samuel ibn Naghrillah when his maid servant began to ask Naghrillah to write letters for her. Eventually Naghrillah was given the job of a tax collector, then a secretary, and finally an assistant vizier of state to the Berber king Habbus al-Muzaffar. When Habbus died in 1038, Samuel ibn Naghrillah made certain that King Habbus‚Äô second son, Badis, succeeded him, not his first born, Bulukkin. The reason behind this act was that Badis was more favored by the people, compared to Bulukkin, with the general Jewish population under Samuel ha-Nagid supporting Badis.Sefer ha-Kabbalah of RAVAD, pub. in: Seder Olam Rabba / Seder Olam Zuta, Jerusalem 1971, p. 40 (Hebrew) In return for his support, Badis made Samuel ibn Naghrillah his vizier and top general. Some sources say that he held office as a viziership of state for over three decades until his death sometime around or after 1056. Because Jews were not permitted to hold public office in Islamic nations as an agreement made in the Pact of Umar, that Samuel Nagid, a Jew or dhimmi, should hold such a high public office was rare. His example was used to support the Golden Age theory, regarding Jewish life under Muslim rule, rather than the lachrymose view. His unique position as the viziership made him the highest ranking Jewish courtier in all of Spain. Recognizing this, in the year of 1027, he took on the title of nagid, or Prince. The peculiar fact regarding his position as the top general in the Granada army was that he was a Jew. That a Jew would command the Muslim army, which he did for 17 years, having them under his authority, was an astonishing feat. Other leading Jews, including Joseph ibn Migash, in the generation that succeeded Samuel ha-Nagid, lent their support to Bulukkin and were forced to flee for their safety. As a Jew, Samuel ha-Nagid actively sought to assert an independence from the Babylonian geonim by writing independently on Jewish law for the Spanish community.Abba Solomon Eban,Heritage: Civilization and the Jews, Simon & Schuster 1984 The Nagid became the leader of Spanish Jewry around the late 1020s. He promoted the welfare of the Jewish people through various acts. For example, he promoted Jewish learning by purchasing many copies of the Talmud, the massive compendium of commentaries on the Jewish oral law. He also promoted the study of the Talmud by giving a form of scholarship to those who wanted to study the Torah for a living. He died in 1056 of natural causes. It has often been speculated that Samuel was the father or otherwise an ancestor of Qasm≈´na, the only attested female Arabic-language medieval Jewish poet, but the foundations for these claims are shaky.Mar√≠a √Ångeles Gallego, 'Approaches to the Study of Muslim and Jewish Women in Medieval Iberian Peninsula: The Poetess Qasmuna Bat Isma\`il', MEAH, secci√≥n Hebreo, 48 (1999), 63-75 (pp. 70-72). Kfar HaNagid, a moshav in modern Israel, was named after him. Joseph ibn Naghrela In 1049 CE, Samuel ibn Naghrillah arranged a marriage for his son Joseph ibn Naghrela (Yusef ibn Naghrillah) (1035‚Äì1066) to the only daughter of the most respected Torah sage of the generation, Rav Nissim Gaon of Kairouan. Joseph succeeded his father as vizier of Granada before turning twenty-one. Many Muslims, envious of his position and unhappy with Joseph's excesses, accused him of using his office to benefit Jewish friends. Joseph ha-Nagid was assassinated in a mob uprising against him on December 30, 1066. The people then proceeded to crucify his body upon the city's main gate. The following morning, on December 31, 1066, the massacre of Granada's Jews began and a mob went on a rampage in Granada, killing a large number of Jewish inhabitants. The Jewish community was later reestablished but was destroyed again in 1090 by the Almoravids. Works =Poetry= Samuel Nagid was a famous Hebrew poet of the Middle Ages, as well a patron of many other poets, and was well known for his homoerotic poetry.Eban, Abba Solomon Heritage: civilization and the JewsSimon and Schuster, Jul 1, 1984. 144-145 https://books.google.com/books?id=GkzdBDuhoRgC&pg;=PA145 Eban says that the Nagid's influence was in that he established a new style of Hebrew poetry by applying aspects of Arabic poetry to biblical Hebrew. This unique application made Hebrew poetry access the major genres of Arabic poetry. He also wrote poetry in the battlefield. When he defeated the allied armies of Seville, Malaga and the Berbers on Sept. 8, 1047 at Ronda, he wrote in his Hebrew poem of gratitude for his deliverance: \\"A redemption which was like the mother of my other redemptions and they became to it as daughters.\\"His main poetic works include \\"Ben Tehillim\\" (Son of Psalms), \\"Ben Qoheleth\\" (Son of Ecclesiastes), and \\"Ben Mishlei\\" (Son of Proverbs), each of which imitates the \\"father work\\". He founded the yeshiva that produced such brilliant scholars as Yitzhaq ibn Ghiath and Maimon ben Joseph, the father of Maimonides. =Other works= * An Arabic treatise on biblical Hebrew grammar. \\"Ben Tehillim\\" (Son of Psalms), \\"Ben Qoheleth\\" (Son of Ecclesiastes), and \\"Ben Mishlei\\" (Son of Proverbs). =Editions and translations= * Diwan of Shemuel Hannaghid, ed. by David Solomon Sassoon (London: Oxford University Press, 1934) * Diwan Shemu'el ha- Nagid, ed. by D.

Career  Bagrat was the only known son of King Michael of Imereti, on whose death he succeeded in 1329. Still a minor at this time (hence, his moniker mts'ire), Bagrat was compelled to remain in his capital, Kutatisi, as the provinces were being divided by the rivaling noble factions. In 1330, George V, the resurgent king in eastern Georgia, took advantage of the situation and of being Bagrat's relative and crossed the Likhi Range into Imereti, being welcomed by many Imeretians, worn of persistent violence and anarchy. Imereti was conquered and the integrity of the Kingdom of Georgia restored. Henceforth, Bagrat sat as eristavi (\\"duke\\") in Imereti, with his seat in Shorapani, under the tutelage of George V.

Serly was the son of Lajos Serly, a pupil of Ferenc Liszt and a famous composer of songs and operettas in the last decades of the 19th century, who immigrated to America in 1905 with his family. Serly's first musical studies were with his father. Spending much of his childhood in New York City, Serly played in various pit orchestras led by his father. In 1922 he returned to Hungary to attend the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied composition with Zolt√°n Kod√°ly, violin with Jen√∂ Hubay, and orchestration with Le√≥ Weiner. He greatly admired and became a young apprentice of B√©la Bart√≥k. For the most part his efforts were highly praised, both by Bart√≥k and by colleagues. Bart√≥k's Viola Concerto took two or three years of Serly's efforts to compile from sketches into a performable piece. It is now one of the most widely performed viola pieces. One of Serly's most famous original works is Rhapsody for Viola and Orchestra. His work bringing Bart√≥k's work to fruition has paid off in the sense that his works are often paired with those of his better known teacher, on recordings and in live performance. Serly taught composition at the Manhattan School of Music in New York City (among other institutions) and was also a featured composer/conductor with the Danish radio orchestra. He taught orchestration to Carlyle W. Hall Sr., a trumpet player and arranger for Tommy Tucker's band, who went on to orchestrate the Broadway hit musical Man of La Mancha, as well as Cry for Us All (a musical version of Hogan's Goat), Come Summer, and several others. American Objectivist poet Louis Zukofsky wrote a dedicatory poem to Serly, published in the avant-garde magazine, Blues, in February 1929. As a violist, Serly was chosen to be part of the NBC Symphony Orchestra for its debut season, 1937-1938, the same orchestra conducted by the legendary Arturo Toscanini. He left after the first season to concentrate on compositional activities. In the course of rethinking the major developments in harmony found in the work of Stravinsky, Milhaud, Prokofiev, and Vaughan Williams as well as Bart√≥k and other composers, Serly developed what he referred to as an enharmonicist musical language. In his book Modus Lacscivus (1975) he explored a set of 82 basic tertian chords. Serly titled several of his later works as being \\"in modus lascivus\\", including sonatas for violin, viola, and piano. (The 1973 edition of his piano sonata misspells the term \\"modus lascivus\\" on the cover, copyright, and title pages, putting the \\"s\\" and \\"c\\" in reverse order.) His Concertino 3 X 3 uses this compositional system, but is most memorable for its formal structure: it consists of nine movements, the first three for piano solo, the second set of three movements for orchestra without piano, and the final set combining the previous sets, played simultaneously.

The term is frequently associated with fraud, especially in mining. Forestry In forestry, high grading, also sometimes referred to as selective logging, is a selective type of timber harvesting that removes the highest grade of timber (i.e. the most merchantable stems) in an area of forest. It is sometimes described by the phrase ‚Äúcut the best and leave the rest‚Äù, and should not be confused with selection cutting. Over time, high grading gives rise to forest stands containing stems of lower timber quality. The reduced income from timber can make it harder to fund good silvicultural practices, thereby impacting the economy of non-timber forest products and other activities such as hunting, wildlife watching or hiking. The practice also has an ecological cost, with a direct impact in terms of biodiversity, genetic diversity and species mix. Finally, it may cause forest to become unsafe due to an excessive amount of unmanaged trees at risk falling in a storm.Silviculture Concepts and Applications Ralph D. Nyland, Chapter 23 Other Partial Cuttings 2002 High grading can also be a form of fraud on the owner of the trees. Indeed, stumpage rates (the amount paid per a certain volume of wood) are based on the average quality of the wood. By taking only the best timber, the wood cutter obtains wood more valuable than average at the price of average wood. The opposite of this practice is low grading, where the lower quality trees are periodically harvested, making the genetic stock faster growing and of better timber quality. Such stems might well be taken by use of thinning methods as part of a thinning r√©gime, especially via the thinning from below method. Fishing High grading is a practice of selectively harvesting fish so that only the best quality fish are brought ashore. The practice is popular in situations under individual fishing quotas where only a limited number of fish are allowed to be harvested. Following the letter, but not the spirit of the law, fish are caught, and if not considered optimal, thrown back into the ocean. The practice of high grading allows fishers to get higher prices for their limited catch but is environmentally destructive because many of the fish returned to the water die. This was an issue with the EU regulation of fisheries. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, a celebrity chef, led a campaign against this with a TV show called Hugh¬¥s Fish Fight, which successfully lobbied for a change in EU law to reduce the waste (discards) from thrown back fish in sea fishery.  Mining  In mining, high grading refers to mining out the portions of the orebody that has the highest grade of material to be mined. However, it may also refer to the concealment and theft of valuable gold or silver ore by miners for personal profit. Common in the United States in the late 19th century and early 20th century, high graders would usually conceal the highest grades of ore they encountered during their work day in a pocket or lunch pail, or within the body, and later attempt to fence it on the black market. As mining companies became more aware of the growing problem, they built changing stations where they forced the miners to shower after their shift in the mines, making it easier to foil attempts at theft.

Since his departure from the band, the musical project called Recoil became his primary musical enterprise, which initially started as a side project to Depeche Mode in 1986. Wilder has also provided production and remixing services to the bands Nitzer Ebb and Curve. He is a classically trained musician.Bell, Max: \\"ALAN WILDER: THE BAND BOY \\", PRIVATE LIVES ‚Äì THE DEPECHE MODE STORY, 1985 Early years Alan Charles Wilder was born into a middle class family and was raised in Acton, West London. He began piano at the age of eight, through the encouragement of his parents. Later on, he learned the flute at St Clement Danes grammar school and became a leading musician in his school bands. After school, Alan worked as a studio assistant at DJM Studios. This led to him ending up working for bands such as The Dragons and Dafne & the Tenderspots (as Alan Normal). Others include Real to Real (featuring Adrian Chilvers on bass, Pete Fresh on guitar, Wolfgang Marlander on drums and Paul St. James on vocals), The Hitmen, and The Korgis, appearing on the UK No. 13 single \\"If I Had You\\" (1979). 1982‚Äì1995: Depeche Mode Following the departure of Vince Clarke, Depeche Mode placed an advertisement in the music magazine Melody Maker: \\"Keyboard player needed for established band ‚Äì no timewasters.\\" Even though the ad was looking for someone under 21 (Wilder was 22) he lied about his age to get the job, and got away with it. He joined Depeche Mode in January 1982, initially as a tour keyboardist, and soon thereafter as a full member of the recording band. Wilder wrote a handful of songs for Depeche Mode, including \\"Two Minute Warning\\" and \\"The Landscape Is Changing\\" (and a B-side, \\"Fools\\") from the album Construction Time Again, and \\"If You Want\\" (and a B-side, \\"In Your Memory\\") from the album Some Great Reward and finally co-wrote \\"Black Day\\" (and a B-side, \\"Christmas Island\\") from the album Black Celebration. However, Wilder's more notable contributions to Depeche Mode were as a musician, arranger, and producer. In addition to playing synthesizer throughout his time with Depeche Mode, Wilder also played piano on the band's signature ballad \\"Somebody\\". In the documentary film 101, Wilder demonstrates how different synthesizer parts of a song are split and arranged across a sampling keyboard for playing them live during the concert, just one small example of Wilder's ongoing contributions to Depeche Mode during his time as a member of the group. For the recording of the album Songs of Faith and Devotion and its corresponding Devotional Tour, Wilder also played live drums. For \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" from the album Violator, Wilder took Martin Gore's melancholy ballad- esque demo and re-envisioned the song as a percolating, melodic dance track. The resulting single went on to become one of the most commercially successful songs in Depeche Mode's history. =Departure= On 26 June 1995, Wilder announced his departure from Depeche Mode: :\\"Due to increasing dissatisfaction with the internal relations and working practices of the group, it is with some sadness that I have decided to part company from Depeche Mode. My decision to leave the group was not an easy one particularly as our last few albums were an indication of the full potential that Depeche Mode was realizing. Since joining in 1982, I have continually striven to give total energy, enthusiasm and commitment to the furthering of the group's success and in spite of a consistent imbalance in the distribution of the workload, willingly offered this. Unfortunately, within the group, this level of input never received the respect and acknowledgement that it warrants. Whilst I believe that the calibre of our musical output has improved, the quality of our association has deteriorated to the point where I no longer feel that the end justifies the means. I have no wish to cast aspersions on any individual; suffice to say that relations have become seriously strained, increasingly frustrating and, ultimately, in certain situations, intolerable. Given these circumstances, I have no option but to leave the group. It seems preferable therefore, to leave on a relative high, and as I still retain a great enthusiasm and passion for music, I am excited by the prospect of pursuing new projects. The remaining band members have my support and best wishes for anything they may pursue in the future, be it collectively or individually.\\" After his split from Depeche Mode, Wilder was approached by Robert Smith with an offer to join the Cure. Wilder respectfully declined.Miller, Jonathan: Stripped: Depeche Mode, Omnibus Press, 2003, . According to Wilder himself, the possibility was offered on behalf of the Cure by Daryl Bamonte (tour manager for both Depeche Mode and the Cure, and brother of the Cure member Perry Bamonte), and he declined as joining another band was the last thing on his mind.Shunt Q+A Vault: Other Artists ‚Äì likes / dislikes / record collection Retrieved on 25 October 2009 He briefly reunited with Depeche Mode during the Teenage Cancer Trust concert at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 17 February 2010, and enjoyed a rapturous reception. During the encore, Wilder accompanied Martin Gore on piano for \\"Somebody\\". Gore returned the favour and played a DJ set on one of Recoil's Selected Events. In 2011, Wilder provided two mixes for the Depeche Mode track \\"In Chains\\". 1986‚Äìpresent: Recoil =Side project= Recoil began in 1986 as a two-track experimental EP. Simply entitled 1 + 2, this collection of primitive demos caught the attention of Mute Records label boss Daniel Miller and was inconspicuously released as a mini-album on 12\\" vinyl. An album, Hydrology, soon followed in 1988 and both were eventually re-issued by Mute on CD as Hydrology plus 1 + 2. Wilder described the project at the time as \\"an antidote to Depeche Mode; a way to alleviate the frustrations of always working within a pop format\\". Almost immediately, Wilder found himself back in the studio to record what would become the most successful Depeche Mode album to date, Violator. It wasn't until the band finally allowed themselves an extended break after the World Violation Tour that Alan could return to Recoil‚Äînot, however, before agreeing to produce Ebbhead, another album for label-mates Nitzer Ebb. It was during this time that he cemented a working relationship with lead singer Douglas McCarthy who would return the favour by singing on Recoil's next album, Bloodline. For the Bloodline LP, released in 1991, Wilder recruited guest vocalists for the first time, with further contributions from Toni Halliday and Moby. 'Bloodline' also marked the first Recoil single, a cover of Alex Harvey's song 'Faith Healer' as well as 'Electro Blues For Bukka White', featuring the sampled voice of bluesman White set into a post-modern context. Between 1992‚Äì93 Wilder resumed his Depeche Mode duties as the band recorded the album Songs of Faith and Devotion. Depeche Mode embarked on their most adventurous tour to date, enduring a gruelling fifteen months on the road. Although the group had reached the pinnacle of success, aspects of the lifestyle had taken their toll on everyone and things eventually came to a head. In June 1995, having spent thirteen years as an integral part of one of the most popular and influential bands the UK has ever produced, Alan Wilder made the decision to leave Depeche Mode. =Solo efforts= Free from his group commitments, Wilder could now focus solely on Recoil. In September 1996, he began work in his own studio, The Thin Line, gradually piecing together what would become Recoil's next album Unsound Methods. Guest vocalists this time played a more up-front role than ever and featured Maggie Estep, Siobhan Lynch, the reappearance of Douglas McCarthy, and Hildia Campbell. In the spring of 2000, Recoil released Liquid which this time featured fellow Mute artist Diamanda Gal√°s, 1940s gospel crooners the Golden Gate Jubilee Quartet, along with New York spoken-word performers Nicole Blackman and Samantha Coerbell. Following a five-year break from recording, Alan Wilder returned in 2007 with Recoil's fifth studio album, entitled SubHuman. 2010 saw the release of 'Selected', a selection of Recoil tracks chosen by Alan who explains: \\"The collection is made up of my personal favourites, remastered and edited together into what I consider a cohesive and total listening experience.‚Äù A tour entitled ‚ÄòA Strange Hour‚Äô was presented during 2010 & 2011 in 52 cities across the world, as part of the ‚ÄòSelected Events‚Äô, which celebrated 25 years of the Recoil project. It signified the first time Recoil had ever taken to the road. The events were not so much ‚Äòlive‚Äô band but more art or video installation. Wilder gathered together filmmakers from as far as Russia, via the Czech Republic and Hungary, all the way to Argentina for this purpose, working very fast, and in the modern way, by creating a central server where everybody could upload their work for others to see, react to and feedback on. Says Wilder: ‚ÄúThis for me typifies the whole essence of what Recoil is all about ‚Äì a collective but with a focused direction ‚Äì and a very thrilling process it was too, watching and hearing ‚ÄôA Strange Hour‚Äô come together from our base in the UK.‚Äù Recoil returned in 2012 to release the concert film 'A Strange Hour In Budapest' on Blu-ray, with 5.1 surround sound, directed by Attila Herk√≥. Also in 2012, we saw Alan Wilder turn up again as Executive Producer & contributor for a new tribute album to Mark Hollis & Talk Talk. Recoil offered two cover versions for the album featuring the vocals of Linton Kwesi Johnson, Shara Worden and Paul Marshall. Wilder also mixed a track for Richard Reed Parry from Arcade Fire. ‚ÄòSpirit of Talk Talk‚Äô was released in September 2012 on Fierce Panda Records.

Aqua Films' Ver√≥nica Cura was the executive producer and Enrique Pi√±eyro was the producer. The drama is based on the experiences of Enrique Pi√±eyro, former airline pilot turned whistle- blower, who became a film actor-director, and of the August 31, 1999 LAPA (L√≠neas A√©reas Privadas Argentinas) airline accident. The LAPA Boeing 737-200 plane, LAPA flight 3142, went into flames after crashing into a mound in midtown Buenos Aires, causing the death of 65 people, and severely injuring 17. The film's basic theme: the general corrosive deregulation, the greedy cost-cutting corporations, and the corrupt government officials, found in the Argentine airline industry. The film is named after the NATO phonetic alphabet version of the identifier of the accident aircraft, LV-WRZ (Lima Victor ‚Äì Whisky Romeo Zulu) Plot The picture opens with the District Attorney (Adolfo Yanelli), listening to voices from a recording in the black box retrieved from an air disaster. The docudrama then tells the story of director Enrique Pi√±eyro, who plays himself as T, a principled pilot at LAPA, an Argentine airline, upset over his company's disregard of basic safety regulations in order to save money. When T complains, he is labeled a troublemaker by the airline company. Soon he's chastised by his fellow pilots. When things get worse he walks out of the cockpit after multiple navigational instruments are inoperative and refuses to fly. The company simply replaces him and gets another pilot to fly. Increasingly frustrated and worried about a crash, T finally writes an angry letter to his superiors, warning that a crash is inevitable if action is not taken. The letter is leaked to the media, and the airline is sold, but the new owners want Pineyro to retract his statement. Complicating matters, their public relations person is Marcela (Mercedes Mor√°n), a love interest from his youth. Even though Marcela is married, T pursues her. T's story is inter-cut with the District Attorney who is looking into the LAPA flight 3142 crash, and starts receiving death threats. Yanelli's character manages to bring the company‚Äôs chief executives and the Argentine Air Force authorities before a criminal court, establishing a unique precedent in commercial aviation history.

Background The film is a fictional reproduction of the background of LAPA Flight 3142 as seen through the eyes of Enrique Pi√±eyro, who was a LAPA pilot from 1988 to 1999. Pi√±eyro resigned from his position in June 1999 ‚Äì two months before the accident occurred- after voicing his concerns about the LAPA's safety policy. Regarding his motivation for making the film, Pi√±eyro said: :\\"I was personally interested in recounting how the accident came to occur, not the fact that the pilots forgot about the flaps and the plane blew up, but why they forgot the flaps. And what was the process, because forgetting the flaps was the straw that broke the camel's back in a series of tremendous violations of regulations. I was interested in portraying what isn't apparent about the accident, not just the final link (the pilot). Because all the links that came before were conveniently hidden because they compromised the establishment, the business.\\"AVmag . Enrique Pi√±eyro, Whisky Romeo Zulu. According to producers, due to the nature of the film, a lot of the filming was done in secret. This was especially true when they filmed in airline areas. Some shots were taken with telephoto lenses.Gentile, Laura. Clar√≠n, interview with Enrique Pi√±eyro and Mercedes Mor√°n, July 21, 2005. Critical reception Film critic Pamela Troy liked the acting in the film and wrote, \\"Much more than a whistle blowing thriller, this beautifully made film is a powerful critique of profit-making over concern for human life.\\"Troy, Pamela. San Francisco Film Society, film review, April 2005. Critic Scott Foundas, writing for FIPRESCI believes the film achieved Enrique Pi√±eyro's exact goal. He wrote, \\"Whisky Romeo Zulu ...emerges as a stirring, if obvious piece of agitprop that achieves exactly what it sets out to achieve. That is to say it works the audience up into an angry lather, and you emerge from the theater never wanting to set foot on another airplane again ‚Äî at least, not if you feel you may have paid less than fair market value for the ticket.\\" However, Foundas did not like the flashbacks to Pi√±eyro‚Äôs childhood which he called \\"gooey and nostalgic.\\"Foundas, Scott. FIPRESCI, \\"Airplanes and Bowling Pins: New Films From Argentina,\\" reporting from the 6th Buenos Aires International Festival of Independent Cinema, 2004. The film critic for Seattle's The Stranger, Andrew Wright, liked Pi√±eyro's directorial debut, and wrote, \\"[D]irector Enrique Pi√±eyro's utterly damning docudrama comes off as both a searing factual indictment of Argentina's passenger-flight standards, and a crackerjack thriller in its own right...It also helps that he proves to be an instinctive filmmaker, employing an intriguingly fractured, minutely detailed take on the material, which hopscotches between events leading up to the easily avoidable incident, and a harried investigator's efforts to make sense of the flight recordings afterward.\\"Wright, Andrew.

The Kernel is distributed free on and around the University of Kentucky campus. It claims a circulation of 8,000 and readership of more than 30,000. Its sole source of revenue is advertising. It is issued during the weekdays during the spring and fall semesters. History The Kentucky Kernel was preceded by several student newspapers, with the earliest dating to 1892. From 1908 to 1915, the University of Kentucky's student newspaper was called The Idea, but it became the Kentucky Kernel following a naming contest in 1915. The first issue produced under the Kernel name was published September 16, 1915. The paper had become an eight-page weekly by 1923, and it became a Monday-Friday daily newspaper in 1966. In 1972, the Kernel formally established its editorial and financial independence from the University of Kentucky administration. Operations and alumni The Kernel operates out of the Grehan Journalism Building, which is located in central campus and also is the home of the School of Journalism and Telecommunications and the Department of Communication. The Grehan Building was completed in 1951 and named to honor Enoch Grehan, the founder of the school's Department of Journalism and one of its first faculty members. Several prominent journalists worked at the Kernel while they were students, including current Associated Press Chief White House Correspondent Terence Hunt, former National Geographic photographer Sam Abell, current Chicago Tribune Washington correspondent William Neikirk and current New York Times South Africa correspondent Michael Wines. The writer Bobbie Ann Mason also worked at the Kernel. The famous Disney writer and illustrator Don Rosa worked for the Kernel from 1969 to 1973. The Pertwillaby Papers were first printed in the Kernel, which inspired many of Rosa's later creations, including the Scrooge McDuck tales The Son of the Sun, Cash Flow, and The Last Lord of Eldorado. Controversies On October 5, 2007, the newspaper published an editorial cartoon that was considered racially insensitive to some students. The cartoon depicted an African American being auctioned off to fraternities and sororities in an attempt by the cartoonist to depict racial divide in the fraternity system. The paper officially apologized the next day and the incident spawned a panel discussion on diversity. Awards In 2006, 2008, 2015 and 2019 the Kernel won the National Pacemaker Award from the Associated Collegiate Press after having been nominated for several years.

Eldest son of Demetre II the Self- sacrificing by his Trapezuntine wife, he was appointed by the Ilkhan ruler Gaikhatu as king of Georgia as reward for his military service during the R√ºmelian uprising in 1293. Succeeding his cousin Vakhtang II, David's rule actually extended only over the eastern part of the kingdom, whereas western Georgia had been under the Imeretian branch of the House of Bagrationi since 1259. In 1295, he supported Baidu Khan in an internal conflict in the Ilkhanate. However, Baidu was killed and Ghazan became a khan. Ghazan ordered the Georgian king to arrive to his capital Tabriz. Remembering the fate of his father, David refused to comply and began preparations for war. Ghazan Khan responded with a punitive expedition, and ravaged the country. Supported by the Mongols, Ossetes attacked Shida Kartli province and occupied the Liakhvi River gorge. David entrenched himself in the Mtiuleti mountains and defeated a large Mongol force in a desperate guerilla fighting at Tsikare. Then, the Khan declared him deposed and appointed David's younger brother Giorgi V as king in 1299. Although backed by the Mongol forces, the power of Giorgi did not extend out of the Georgian capital Tbilisi, and the Khan replaced him by another brother, Vakhtang III, in 1302. The new king led a Mongol army against David, but could not penetrate deeply into the largely mountainous provinces held by the rebels, and a truce was negotiated. David was recognized as joint sovereign with his brother and received the princedom of Alastani in the southern province of Javakheti. He developed friendly relations with the Egyptian Mamluks, the traditional rivals of the Ilkhanate, and, mediated by Byzantium, achieved the restoration of the Monastery of the Cross in Jerusalem to the Georgian Orthodox and Apostolic Church in 1305. David was married twice, first to the Mongol princess Oljath, and then to a daughter of the Georgian nobleman Hamada Surameli. He was succeeded by his son Giorgi VI the Little in 1311.  Coinage  Two types of coins issued in David's name survive, silver and copper coins, stuck in 1297 and 1310, respectively. The gap between these two periods is filled with the emissions of David's brother Vakhtang III. Ancestry References * Limper, B.

With a construction history dating to 1836, it was one of the oldest surviving wood-frame textile mills in the state prior to a 1994 fire which led to its demolition. The mill complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Saxony Mill complex stood at the western end of Rockville's industrial area, occupying the lowest water privilege in the town on the Hockanum River. It was located at the western end of West Main Street, at its junction with West Street. The site is now a public park. The mill consisted of seven connected structures, most of brick and masonry, built between 1836 and the 1970s. The main (original) mill building was a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure with a distinctive five-story bell tower rising from the center of its front facade. The remaining structures, all built with load-bearing masonry walls, were added after c. 1870. The oldest portion of the mill, the northern section of the main building, was built in 1836. The Saxony Mill Company was founded in 1838 as a joint-stock company organized by that mill's proprietors. The mill at first produced satinet, a woolen material developed as a less-expensive alternative to fine woolens which were then only available from England. The mill went through a series of owners who used the complex in different aspects of textile production until 1951, when most of Rockville's mills were closed. The main mill was enlarged in 1861, and various additions were made in the early decades of the 20th century. Most recently operated by Plastifoam, a suspicious fire on July 25, 1994 did extensive damage to the then-vacant building and surrounding buildings, and disrupted power to thousands of people. The remaining structure was demolished a short time later. The site is now a municipal park.

The population in 2011 was 25,252,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 158.83 km¬≤. It had 19,687 eligible voters in 2006. History In 1117, D. Teresa, Countess of Portucale, and mother of Afonso Henriques the first king of Portugal, donated to the nobleman Gon√ßalo Eriz the lands that constitute Albergaria-a-Velha. As part of the donation the nobleman was obligated to maintain open a hospice for poor travels.Alexandre Herculano (1855); The historical tradition suggests that Queen Teresa, passing through Assilh√≥, stayed at the home Gon√ßalo Eriz and his wife Andreza Pires, where she had a child, and for this motive instituted a hospital, securing vast territories for the benefit of illustrious visitors. Notwithstanding D. Teresa had a romantic relationship with Fernando Peres de Trava, and had a son after the death of the Count Henrique, it is known that she did remain. In 1117 she also traveled to Coimbra where she further remained at Albergaria, and in June after being encircled by forces of the Emir of Morocco, and during her return remained in Assilh√≥ for a while, and later to the north, relaxing in lands around Feira The document referred to this shelter for the travelling poor, or albergaria, and thus the area was known as Albergaria. Later, the Carta do Couto de Ossel√¥a was discovered that definitely identified both the first document to refer to Portugal as a Kingdom and at the same figured in the identification of Albergaria-a-Velha as an administrative unit of the country. The Bishop of Coimbra, D. Egas, in 1258, ordered this document to be transcribed in order to conserve it.Camara Municipal de Albergaria-a-Velha (1966) Also, because it was the older Albergaria, owing to the existence of Albergaria-a-Nova, the community began to be referred to as Albergaria-a-Velha (meaning Portuguese for older). The first references to Albergaria as town, developed in the 16th Century, with the erection of an obelisk in the municipal square, around the location of the first hospital. It was ordered erected at the hospital by the Lisbon government on 27 May 1629. The municipality was created in 1834, when the older municipality of Aveiro was dismembered, and the new administrative divisions Loure, Albergaria-a-Velha and Vale Maior reconstituted. Just after this reconstitution, the parish of Alquerubim (Paus) was annexed to Albergaria-a-Velha, and later the parishes of Branca, Ribeira de Fr√°guas ( both around 1855), Angeja and Frossos (in 1854) were incorporated. Geography { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } The municipality of Albergaria-a- Velha is located in the transition zone between the coastal municipalities of Murtosa, Aveiro, Estarreja and √çlhavo and the more mountain communities in the interior. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (freguesias): * Albergaria-a-Velha e Valmaior * Alquerubim * Angeja * Branca * Ribeira de Fr√°guas * S√£o Jo√£o de Loure e Frossos Economy The fertile lands of Albergaria-a-Velha have been historically a center of agriculture and cattle-raising, so much so, that it has been erroneously considered an agricultural community. In fact, the secondary sector represents 56.2% of the activity within the municipality, while the primary sector occupies 13.6% of the economic activity. This secondary sector includes basic industrial businesses involved in metallurgy, industrial textiles and lumber industries. These companies are primarily small- to medium-size enterprises with less than 20 employees. Most of the transformative sectors are concentrated in the parishes of Albergaria-a-Velha and Branca, representing about 90% of the secondary sector. The urbanized are of the parish of Albergaria-a-Velha is the primary beneficiary of these industries; its geo-strategic position in the center of the municipality and industrial zone provides the region with incubator affects. Activities such as metallurgy and fabrication, equipment production, transformation of lumber goods, paper production, the fabrication and restoration of furniture, as well as the production of ceramics, provide Albergaria-a-Velha with a diversified economic base. Tourism Water Mills Route The Water Mills predominate in Albergaria-a-Velha - a municipality with the largest number of inventoried water mills in Europe - constituting one of the most important elements of the rural landscape throughout the entire municipality. These are elements with high patrimonial value that delight the eyes of their citizens and all the visitors that dare to explore them. Albergaria-a-Velha is a land of traditions made of water, bread and mills. The Water Mills Route is currently made up of 11 clusters in a total of 14 mills with 19 couples of millstones, distributed in different parishes of the county. The mill was one of the central places in the life of a rural community, where the memories of once, are still very much alive in the daily rituals of the millers and in the endless spinning of their millstones and casters. Although there are mills throughout the municipality, it is along the Rio Caima that we have the units of greatest expression and importance, since the more stable flow allowed permanent work. However, also in the rivers F√≠lveda and Jardim, in the streams of Albergaria-a-Velha, Font√£o, Frias, Fial and Mouquim and in the countless corgas and ditches of all the parishes, there are traces or records of more than three and a half hundred mills, indicating the importance that the mill activity had in the region. These mills were built mainly in the 18th and 19th centuries, using local construction materials. Situated on the banks of rivers and streams, they took advantage of the water force of the watercourses, diverting it by taking it directly to the cube where the pressure was increased by the effect of gravity, feeding the feathers of the wooden caster and making it rotate. The force generated by this action is transmitted by the axis, generating the force to move the stone wheels. Many of them were mills of several owners, so they were used according to a schedule previously agreed between all their users. Here the local crops were mainly ground, with particular emphasis on corn and wheat. These mills were also used for the husking of rice produced in the Baixo Vouga region, using cork slabs that covered the millstones, which reduced their abrasive effect.

The city itself had a population of 3,034 in 2001, while Arcos e Mogofores parish has about 5,000. History The history of the municipality is poorly documented before the Roman era, although some vestiges of early Paleolithic (Monte Crasto, Carvalhais and Vila Nova de Monsarros), Neolithic (Moita) and Iron Age (Monte Crasto) artifacts have been studied in this area. But remnants of Roman era artifacts have been isolated in many parts of the municipality, including Aguim, Avel√£s de Caminho, Avel√£s de Cima, Mogofores, Moita, √ìis do Bairro, S√£o Louren√ßo do Bairro, Vila Nova de Monsarros, Vilarinho do Bairro and, especially, in Anadia (Monte Crasto) and Sangalhos. In addition to domestic ceramic evidence, this early villages in this area existed along the cross roads between the major Roman towns of the time: Olissipo (Lisbon) and Cale (Porto). This continues to be a source of investigation and theories as to the local importance.

With about five centuries of populational existence, the area of Anadia developed over successive mutations in administrative domain. The region, during its formative age, was not developed from the implementation of forals as was the traditional method of instituting land development. But, in the historical Aveiro district on three forals were instituted to promote development: Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim (centers that were part of the older parish of Moita). There have been posterior references to forals conceded in this area (in Avel√£s de Caminho, for example), but they were insufficiently explained to indicate that the forals were more than mere local or defensive contracts between the Crown and/or the peoples of the area. Further, there were erroneous references to older forals by contemporary authors, in particular case, the municipalities of Aguim and Anadia. At the beginning of the 16th century, during the administrative reforms of King Manuel I, the king did not forget the coastal central region, and allocated several forals. In 1514, the municipalities of Anadia, Avel√£s de Cima, Vilarinho do Bairro, Carvalhais (which included Ferreiros, Fontemanha and Vale de Avim), S√£o Louren√ßo do Bairro, Aguim, Sangalhos, Pereiro (the parish of Avel√£s de Cima), √ìis do Bairro, Mogofores, Avel√£s de Caminho, Boialvo (parish of Avel√£s de Cima) and Vila Nova de Monsarros; in 1519 Paredes do Bairro was granted a writ and then in 1520 forals for Mogofores and √ìis do Bairro were established.

In 1806, the French envoy Sebastiani had been dispatched to Constantinople with orders to bring about Turkey's re-entry into the Napoleonic Wars. Sultan Selim III set about preparations for war with Russia after positively receiving Sebastiani. The Russian emperor, Alexander I, was alarmed by these developments as he had already deployed a significant force to Poland and East Prussia to fight the advancing French forces under Emperor Napoleon I. Alexander requested British assistance in keeping Turkey out of the war. The British army was far too small and inadequate to impose the will of the Coalition on the Ottomans, so it naturally fell to the powerful Royal Navy to meet Russia's requests. The ships immediately available for the task were HMS Canopus, HMS Standard, HMS Thunderer, HMS Glatton, and the two bomb ships HMS Lucifer and HMS Meteor,p.187, Brenton under the command of Vice- Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, commander-in-chief of the British Mediterranean Fleet, sailed for the Dardanelles and made preparations for the upcoming assault. In the meantime, the British ambassador to Constantinople, Arbuthnot, demanded that the Ottoman government evict Sebastiani, and added that should the Ottomans resist the ultimatum, the Mediterranean fleet would attack. The actual force that had been chosen by Collingwood to carry out the operation was small‚Äîonly eight ships-of-the-line and four frigates. In addition, four Russian ships-of-the-line under Admiral Dmitry Senyavin were sent to support the British, but did not join Duckworth until after the exit from Dardanelles was made. Admiral Duckworth, who commanded the British, was under orders to bombard Constantinople and seize the Turkish battle fleet.  Background  In anticipation of a war between Russia and Turkey, Britain had sent Sir Thomas Louis from Cadiz on 2 November 1806 into the Mediterranean Sea. He reached Tenedos, near the Dardanelles Strait, on 21 November, made a brief trip to Constantinople and returned to the Straits. Turkey had declared war on Russia on 30 December 1806, and Britain sent Admiral Sir John Duckworth in Royal George 100 guns from Cadiz on 15 January 1807 into the Mediterranean Sea. Picking up Windsor Castle 98 guns and Repulse 74 guns from Gibraltar and Pomp√©e 74 and Ajax 74 from Malta as replacements for the Russian fleet under Seniavin, which was still in the Adriatic, Duckworth proceeded to Tenedos. Despite the British ultimatum, on December 27 Selim declared war on Russia. On 29 January 1807, the frigate Endymion of 40 guns left Constantinople, evacuating the British ambassador and all British residents. A formal declaration of war had not yet been sent by London and the two powers were still technically allied. On February 10, Duckworth's fleet concentrated at the mouth of the Dardanelles. It met Louis's ships and returned to Tenedos on 1 February, where Duckworth's ships met up. Still not technically at war, the Turkish delayed Duckworth with token negotiations. The presence of British and Russian vessels at the mouth of the Dardanelles caused Sebastiani and his French engineering officers to begin the improvement of the Turkish shore batteries. Destruction of the Turkish Fleet Feby 19th 1807, coloured engraving after Thomas Whitcombe  The battle  On 11 February, the fleet, with Duckworth in command, left Tenedos, but for a week could not enter the Straits because of lack of wind. Ajax caught fire on 14 February, ran aground on Tenedos, and blew up on 15 February. Finally, on 19 February the ships sailed up the Dardanelles, where they were fired on by the forts at the entrance (fire was returned by the bombs), then the castles further up (fire was returned by the fleet). However, the absence of significant numbers of Turkish troops owing to the end of Ramadan meant the batteries were ineffective and the fleet quickly reached the Sea of Marmara. Just above the castles lay a 64-gun ship, frigates of 40, 36, 36, and 32 guns, sloops of 22, 18, 10 and 10 guns, 2 brigs and 2 gunboats. As the British fleet approached, one of the brigs left and sailed further up for Constantinople. After Royal George passed, anchoring some 3 miles further up, Pomp√©e, Thunderer, Standard, Endymion and Active attacked the Turkish vessels and a new fortification being built nearby. 1 sloop and 1 gunboat were captured and others forced ashore and destroyed by British boats. Duckworth then ordered marines under Edward Nicolls to land and seize the shore batteries, and as the Turkish gunners tried to flee from an island they called Brota,Known as Proti to the Greeks, and now known as Kinali or Kinaliada the Royal Marines captured two guns. At 5pm the fleet sailed for Constantinople, leaving Active behind to finish up. British casualties in this action were 10 killed and 77 wounded. After suffering extensive damage, Duckworth withdrew without ever attempting a bombardment of Constantinople. One of the batteries deployed by the Turks against the British Fleet was armed with a medieval 18.6 ton cast bronze piece with 63 cm diameter stones used for projectiles, known as the Dardanelles Gun. The piece had been cast in 1464 on the model of bombards used in the 1453 Siege of Constantinople and now resides in Fort Nelson.  Aftermath  Duckworth sailed off Constantinople for a week and a half, hoping the Turkish fleet would come out and fight, but it did not. Releasing the sloop on 2 March, he returned through the Dardanelles to Tenedos on 3 March. On the way, the fortifications again fired on the British, who lost 29 killed and 138 wounded. At Tenedos he was met by Seniavin, who had left Corfu on 22 February. He did not make a second attempt on the Dardanelles‚Äîa decision that earned him criticism, but was probably reasonable considering the powerful shore batteries. An attempt to seize the Turkish fleet would have probably failed and resulted in much higher British casualties. The entire operation was a failure, resulting in heavy losses of 42 killed, 235 wounded, and 4 missing. Long after France and Russia had made peace and Senyavin had defeated the Turkish fleet at Dardanelles on 10‚Äì11 May 1807, the Ottomans would remain at war with Russia, draining a significant portion of the Russian army, which also became involved in operations against Sweden in the Finnish War, and later in the resumption of hostilities against France in 1812.

It is an herbaceous perennial native to woodland and rocky slopes in eastern North America, prized for its red and yellow flowers. It readily hybridizes with other species in the genus Aquilegia. Description The plant is tall. The fern-like leaves are lobed and grouped in threes, growing from the base and off the flowering stems. The flowers are long and have yellow petals with a red spur and red sepals. They appear in late spring (usually in May and June), nodding on stems above the leaves. The round end of the spur contains nectar, which is sought by butterflies and hummingbirds. The caterpillars of Columbine Duskywing (Erynnis lucilius) feed on the leaves. Cultivation Aquilegia canadensis is a highly decorative plant, valued for its attractive foliage and showy flowers. For this reason it is widely grown outside its native region, in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. In the UK it has been awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. However, this does not seem to be the case anymore, as it was likely removed from the listing and given the pollinator award instead. https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/trials-awards/award-of-garden-merit The plant is easily propagated from seed, and blooms the second year from sowing. It is relatively long lived in the garden. It grows well in shade, and in sun with proper moisture. The cultivar 'Little Lanterns' is half the height of the species. Other uses Native American tribes used various parts of red columbine in herbal remedies for ailments such as headache, sore throat, fever, rash caused by poison ivy, stomatitis, kidney and urinary problems, and heart problems. Native American men also rubbed crushed seeds on their hands as a love charm. Toxicity Canada columbine contains a cyanogenic glycoside, which releases poisonous hydrogen cyanide when the plant is damaged.Edible and Medicinal Plants of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Matthew Alfs.

It was released on October 30, 2002 in North America and a week later in Europe. A spin-off from the Age of Empires series, Age of Mythology takes some of its inspiration from mythology and legends of the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse, rather than from actual historical events. Many gameplay elements are similar to the Age of Empires series. Its campaign follows an Atlantean admiral, Arkantos, who is forced to travel through the lands of the game's three cultures, hunting for a cyclops who is in league with Poseidon against Atlantis. Age of Mythology was commercially successful, going platinum four months after its release after selling over one million units. In 2003, it was followed by an expansion pack, Age of Mythology: The Titans. On May 8, 2014, Age of Mythology: Extended Edition was released for Windows via Steam. This was followed by a second expansion pack, Age of Mythology: Tale of the Dragon, released on January 28, 2016. Gameplay In this screenshot, an Egyptian town under attack by the Norse, defending itself using the meteor god power. Like many other real-time strategy games, Age of Mythology is based on defeating enemy units and towns, building your own units and towns, and training villagers and fighters. In this way, players are able to defeat and conquer rival towns and civilizations. Players advance their tribe through four \\"Ages\\": starting in the Archaic Age, the player may upgrade to the Classical Age, the Heroic Age, and finally, the Mythic Age. Each upgrade to a higher Age unlocks new units and technologies for the player, which strengthens their settlement. However, upgrading requires a sum of resources to be paid and a certain prerequisite building to be constructed. There are three playable cultures in Age of Mythology: the Greeks, Egyptians, and Norse. Each culture has three \\"major gods\\"‚Äîimportant deities such as Ra, Zeus, or Odin. The player chooses their major god before the game begins. Every time a player advances to the next age, a \\"minor god\\" is selected. Minor gods are slightly less significant historically than their major counterparts. Some minor gods include Bast and Aphrodite. All gods grant the player unique technologies, myth units, and a unique \\"god power\\"‚ÄîA one-time special ability that can either damage an opponent, or benefit the player that uses it. There are four major resources in Age of Mythology: food, wood, gold, and favor; unlike previous games by Ensemble Studios, this game does not include the stone resource. Resources can be used to train units, construct buildings, and research technologies, among other things. Civilian units‚Äînamely, the Greek villagers, Norse gatherers and dwarfs, the Egyptian laborers, and fishing boats‚Äîare used to gather resources. Hunting animals, gathering berries, harvesting livestock, farming, and fishing are all methods by which food can be gathered. Wood is gathered only by chopping down trees, and gold is gathered from either gold mines or from trade. Players can purchase upgrades that increase the rate of gathering these resources. Favor is acquired in different ways by different cultures: Greek players gain it by having villagers pray at temples; Egyptian players earn it by building monuments; and Norse players receive it by fighting/hunting animals or by possessing heroes. Resources can be exchanged at a player's market, with the exception of favor. =Units= Every unit in the game takes up between one and five \\"population slots\\". Building additional houses or Town Centers‚Äîthe main building in a player's town‚Äîincreases the population capacity, up to a maximum of 300. Units can be classified into seven categories; infantry, archers, cavalry‚Äîthe three of which are broadly classified as human units‚Äîsiege units, naval units, heroes, and myth units (monsters and other creatures from mythology). The rock-paper-scissors model governs most units in battle. For example, infantry do additional damage to cavalry, cavalry do additional damage to archers, and archers do additional damage to infantry. The same rock-paper-scissors formation exists in the three different types of naval units‚Äîarrow ships, siege ships, and hammer ships. Siege units are generally exempt from the rock-paper-scissors model but are instead able to destroy buildings easily while being vulnerable to cavalry attacks. Heroes are extremely effective against myth units, which in turn do large amounts of damage against human units. Heroes are also able to collect relics, which grant the player additional economic or military bonuses when deposited in a player's temple. Most units can be upgraded, making them better at certain tasks. =Buildings= Buildings in Age of Mythology can generally be split into three categories: economic, military, and defensive. The most important economic building is the Town Center, which is similar to the building of the same name in the Age of Empires series games. Most civilian units are trained at the Town Center, as are some improvements. Most importantly, players advance Age via the building. The Town Center provides 15 population slots, and building additional houses will earn the player 10 additional slots per house. In the Heroic Age, players may claim settlements (unclaimed Town Centres) for additional population slots. In some cases owning all town centres will trigger a countdown to victory. Other economic buildings include the farm and market. Buildings are able to research improvements, as well as provide resources for the player. All units except civilians and myth units are trained at military buildings. These buildings differ in name and purpose between culture, but all are able to train similar units. Military buildings are also used to research military specific technologies, such as armor upgrades, and attack improvements. Walls and towers are defensive structures, which are not able to train units, and are used only for the purposes of defense. They are able to research some upgrades, although these are generally only useful to the building performing the research. Another type of building available to players, is a Wonder: a grand building that represents an architectural achievement of the civilization. In certain game modes, once a player builds a wonder, a ten-minute countdown begins. If the wonder is still standing after the countdown ends, the player who built the wonder wins. =Scenario editor= The Age of Mythology scenario editor: visible is a large statue surrounded by deep water and the \\"rotate camera angle\\" controls, which allow for construction of more complex custom scenarios. The Age of Mythology editor is far more advanced than that of its predecessor, the Age of Empires II scenario editor. As well as standard unit placement facilities, the editor allows units to be overlapped, and it facilitates for large mountains, and steep terrain. Triggers, a popular aspect of scenario design in Age of Empires II, are also present in Age of Mythology's editor, as well as cinematics and other special effects. =Campaign= Unlike the campaign modes in Age of Empires and Age of Empires II, Age of Mythology only has one central campaign, Fall of the Trident. The campaign is significantly longer than campaigns in previous games, with a total of 32 scenarios. =Multiplayer= Multiplayer is a highly popular aspect of Age of Mythology. Most multiplayer games are played through Ensemble Studios Online (ESO), or via a direct LAN or IP connection. Age of Mythology included unlimited free multiplayer accounts on ESO. it is no longer possible to create new accounts but access to already created ones is still possible. Similar in function to Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net, ESO allows players to play matches, as well as chat with other players. In multiplayer games, there are seven different game types available, all of which are provided as standard with the game: Supremacy‚Äîthe standard game mode‚Äîincludes randomly generated map and all gameplay aspects; Conquest is similar to Supremacy, but victory is only possible by defeating all other players; in Deathmatch players begin the game with high resources, but the game is otherwise the same as Supremacy; in Lightning, the gameplay is identical to Supremacy, but the game plays at twice the normal speed; in Nomad mode, players start with one civilian unit, and no Town Center, and must build up on a settlement; the goal of King of the Hill is to control a monument in the center of the map for a set period of time; and in Sudden Death, a player loses if their Town Center is destroyed, and they fail to rebuild it within a set period of time. Multiplayer tournaments and LAN parties are popular throughout the world, with many players visiting computer gaming lounges to participate. Campaign summary Atlantean admiral and war hero Arkantos arrives at Atlantis after several years of warfare to see his son, Kastor. However, he is ordered by the Atlantean councillor and theocrat, Krios, to sail to Troy to assist Agamemnon in the Trojan War. Just then, the island is attacked by krakens and the Black Sails, a group of pirate bandits led by the minotaur Kamos, a fierce enemy of Arkantos. After the trident from Poseidon's statue gets stolen, Arkantos raids the pirate settlement on a nearby island, where he recovers the trident, although Kamos escapes on a leviathan and vows revenge. Arkantos sends the trident back to Atlantis and sails away, leaving Kastor behind against the latter's wishes. Arkantos travels to Troy to assist Agamemnon. After a series of skirmishes against Troy, fighting alongside Ajax and Odysseus, they devise the plan involving the Trojan Horse, and swiftly win the war. Afterwards, Ajax recommends Arkantos to sail to Ioklos to repair his ships, which are too heavily damaged for the trip back to Atlantis. When they arrive, the port has been raided by bandits, who have imprisoned the centaur Chiron. After rescuing Chiron, he reveals that the leader of the bandits is a man named Kemsyt. Chiron takes them north to locate the other prisoners, who are being forced to dig up an entrance to the underworld by Gargarensis, a cyclops warlord and commander of both Kemsyt and Kamos. The heroes destroy Gargarensis's base and confront him, but he escapes to the underworld of Erebus using the entrance. The heroes follow Gargarensis into the underworld, where they find him trying to burst open a large door in the stone with a huge battering ram. Cautious of his motives, they destroy the ram. Gargarensis confronts them and causes a cave to collapse before escaping, forcing the heroes to find another way out. With the help of the dead, they reach three temples dedicated to the Greek gods Poseidon, Zeus, and Hades. Arkantos prays to Atlantis's patron Poseidon for help but receives none. He then prays to Zeus, who creates a staircase to the surface. Reaching the surface, they find themselves in Egypt, where they help a Nubian mercenary leader named Amanra in fighting Kemsyt, who is there to steal a relic that Amanra's men are excavating. She reveals that the Egyptian god Osiris has been killed by Set, who aids Gargarensis. Amanra plans to reunite Osiris's body parts scattered throughout the desert, bringing him back. During this time. Arkantos falls asleep and is met by Athena in his dreams, who reveals Gargarensis's motives: Ages before, the Earth was ruled by the Titans under Kronos. Zeus stopped Kronos and imprisoned him in Tartarus, behind adamantine doors. However, Poseidon, who is envious of Zeus's power, is trying to free Kronos and the Titans in order to destroy Zeus so he could claim the throne. Gargarensis is aiding him because Poseidon and Kronos have promised him immortality as a reward. Athena asks Arkantos to stop Gargarensis at all costs, as Zeus himself cannot interfere. In order to stop him, Arkantos travels with Ajax, while Amanra and Chiron go their separate ways to find the pieces of Osiris. Amanra goes north, where she finds Kemsyt's fortress on an island. With the aid of nearby villagers, she captures the piece he had stolen, but Kemsyt escapes. Chiron finds and recovers another piece hidden beneath a giant tamarisk tree, and is aided by Norsemen, who are trying to stop Ragnarok. Meanwhile, Arkantos and Ajax find the last piece in Kamos's main fortress. Arkantos raids the fortress, secures the piece, and mortally wounds Kamos with a spear, who falls to his death. The heroes gather all the pieces outside Osiris's pyramid, which protects another gate to Tartarus. Osiris is resurrected and defeats Gargarensis's army but the cyclops escapes, heading north to the Norselands, the location of another Tartarus gate. Following Gargarensis, Ajax and Arkantos find Odysseus's wrecked ship on the coast of an island, and so decide to land to look for him. Upon landing, both men are turned into boars by the sorceress Circe. They proceed to rescue Odysseus and his men, who have also been cursed, destroying her fortress in the process and reversing the curse. Odysseus continues his journey home, while Arkantos and Ajax continue north. When they reach the frozen Norselands, they are given directions to the underworld by dwarf brothers Brokk and Eitri in return for repelling giants from their forge. Later, an elderly man named Skult gives them a banner to unite the Norse clans. However, the Norsemen are instead enraged, and the heroes are forced to defeat their chieftains in combat. The flag turns out to be the banner of the evil giant Folstag and the plan a trick by Skult, who is actually the god Loki in disguise, another ally of Gargarensis. With the help of the valkyrie Reginleif, who sent the Norsemen to Egypt, the heroes locate Gargarensis and the Tartarus gate. Inside the Norse underworld Niflheim, they are pursued by fire giants until Chiron sacrifices himself to hold them off, saving his friends. While Gargarensis is trying to knock down the gate, Brokk and Eitri have been rebuilding Thor's hammer (shattered by Loki), that upon completion seals the gate. Back on the surface, they confront Gargarensis with the help of Odysseus, who has made a detour to help them, and the cyclops is captured and beheaded. Arkantos sails back to Atlantis. When he brings out Gargarensis's head to tie it to the mast in victory, he finds the head is actually Kemsyt's, another trick by Loki. Gargarensis is still alive and is trying to break the final gate holding Kronos, which is located at the centre of Atlantis. Gargarensis has captured and fortified Atlantis, and Poseidon himself has possessed a statue in the city center to protect him. Arkantos builds a wonder to Zeus and gains his blessing, giving him god-like power and enabling him to confront Gargarensis and the living statue at the temple of Poseidon. With his new powers, Arkantos defeats the statue, and Gargarensis is impaled by its trident as it collapses. All of Atlantis then collapses into the ocean, along with Arkantos. While the remaining heroes sail away with the surviving Atlanteans, Athena revives Arkantos and rewards him by making him a god. =The Golden Gift= An official campaign, The Golden Gift, was released as a download on Microsoft's website. The campaign follows the adventures of Brokk and Eitri, the dwarves who appeared in the initial campaign. The plot unfolds with both dwarves planning to create a giant golden boar as an offering to the Norse god Freyr. While working separately, Brokk is approached by Skult (also from Fall of the Trident) who warns him that Eitri is making preparations to create the boar without his brother, of which Eitri is also told the same about Brokk. As both brothers race to complete the boar in the great forge, Skult steals the finished piece and holds it in Loki's fortress. The brothers eventually assault the base, and the boar is retrieved and successfully offered to Freyr. Development Ensemble Studios began work on their first fully 3D engine at the same time as their development of Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings. Named the BANG! Engine, this was announced in January 2001, for use in a new game, codenamed RTSIII. RTSIII was eventually revealed as Age of Mythology. In developing Age of Mythology, Ensemble Studios decided to move away from the center of the Age of Empires series history, to avoid becoming stale and repetitive. This allowed them to work with new ideas and concepts. Following the announcement of the game for September 2002, a trial version was released. It contained five scenarios of the game's campaign, and two random maps. In the trial version, the player can only select Zeus, but there are nine gods available in the full version of the game. There was debate during Age of Mythologys construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them \\"fair\\" while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game. Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of beta-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a \\"faceless drone in another building\\". =Music= The official soundtrack was released on October 22, 2002, under the record label \\"Sumthing Else\\". The score was written by Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan. Rippy cites musicians such as Peter Gabriel, Tuatara, Bill Laswell, Talvin Singh and Tchad Blake as inspirations for the soundtrack. The musical work done on Age of Mythology was unlike anything Rippy had done before; an example of this was \\"writing for a seventy-piece orchestra and then flying out to Washington to record it\\". Music 4 Games' reviewer, Jay Semerad, heaped Age of Mythologys soundtrack with praise. He summarized his review by declaring: \\"In all, the Age of Mythology soundtrack is an experience that should not be missed. It's easily one of my favorite soundtracks from this past year.\\" Semerad was also astonished, and appreciative, of the use of instruments such as the ney flute, tabla and toy piano, all of which he said produced \\"some innovative analog and synthesized electronic effects\\". His only critique was that at times some of the background melodies were \\"bound to a simple harmonization\\", and lacking any \\"real bold or innovative purpose\\". Expansions and other versions =The Titans= Age of Mythology: The Titans is an expansion to Age of Mythology, released on September 30, 2003. The expansion added a new culture, the Atlanteans, as well as several new units, including titans. Critics and fans received the expansion with enthusiasm, although its ratings were slightly lower on average than those of the original version. =Mythologies= Age of Empires: Mythologies is a spin-off of Age of Empires: The Age of Kings, but with the unique mythology-based gameplay elements of Age of Mythology. It was developed by Griptonite Games for the Nintendo DS. =Extended Edition= Age of Mythology: Extended Edition is a compilation that includes the main game and The Titans expansion. It adds Steamworks integration, Twitch support, an enhanced observer mode, native HD widescreen and improved water and lighting. It was released on May 8, 2014. The Extended Edition was developed by SkyBox Labs. =Tale of the Dragon= On September 18, 2015, a new expansion was announced, Tale of the Dragon. It was co-developed by SkyBox Labs and Forgotten Empires, the latter having worked on new expansions for Age of Empires II. The expansion added a new culture, the Chinese, with the major gods Fuxi, N√ºwa, and Shennong. The expansion also features a new campaign and multiplayer maps, as well as other features. It was released on January 28, 2016. Reception In the United States, Age of Mythology sold 870,000 copies and earned $31.9 million by August 2006, after its release in October 2002. It was the country's 10th best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. Combined sales of the game and its Titans expansion had reached 1.3 million units in the United States by August 2006. Age of Mythology received a \\"Gold\\" sales award from the Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA), indicating sales of at least 200,000 copies in the United Kingdom. =Critical reception= Age of Mythology received critical acclaim, reaching an estimated one million units sold within five months of its release. The game was nominated for the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences' Interactive Achievement Awards for Computer Game of the Year and strategy computer game of the year. Age of Mythologys graphics were praised by the majority of reviewers. IGN reviewer Steve Butts stated that \\"some fantastic effects and believable animations make this one a joy to watch. The differences between the armies and environments are awesome.\\" As such, he gave the graphics a rating of 9 out of 10. Meanwhile, GameSpot reviewer Greg Kasavin also rated the graphics 9 out of 10, stating that \\"Age of Mythology is a great-looking game, filled with bright colors and carefully detailed animations.\\" Game Revolution also appreciated Age of Mythologys graphics, stating in their review that the \\"new 3D landscape looks good\\", and including graphics as one of the positives in the review summary. PC Gamer reviewer William Harms admired the graphics, \\"The environments, units, and buildings are packed with detail,\\" and excitedly commented on the effects: \\"What really impressed me, though, were the game's animations. When a Minotaur smacks a dude with his club, the schmoe goes flying, skids on the ground, and then bounces back into the air.\\" The game's soundtrack was also praised by reviewers, although several commented that it was repetitive and predictable at times. IGN described it as \\"great, if repetitive, music\\", whilst Game Revolution declared that the sound \\"really showcases Ensemble's continued attention to detail\\", before going on to praise the audio snippets in various languages. IGN was pleased with Age of Mythologys campaign, and not bothered by its length. Instead, they stated that \\"the meaningful and engaging single player campaign provides a nearly flawless experience.\\" However, GameSpot was slightly critical of it, claiming that \\"while some of the campaign missions do feature some unusual circumstances or objectives that change, the game's story isn't incredibly engaging.\\" This was compromised by stating that Age of Empires fans wouldn't expect an amazing campaign; they would \\"make a beeline for the game's random map mode, anyway.\\" PC Gamer elaborated more on the campaign however, saying: \\"many of the missions are extremely well-crafted\\", and that \\"sprinkled throughout these encounters are moments of genuine comedy ‚Äî a truly delightful surprise.\\" However, they still found reasons to criticize: \\"Regrettably, most of AoMs missions suffer from one recurring, frustrating problem: a severe case of 'build base-itis.'\\" The reviewer elaborated: \\"I know base-building is inherent to the genre, but even the most ardent fan will be put off by just how much there is. What's most disappointing is that AoMs setting really lends itself to imaginative mission design ‚Äî and I don't think the designers took full advantage of the backdrop, which is a shame.\\" The editors of Computer Games Magazine named Age of Mythology the fourth-best computer game of 2002, and called it \\"an amazingly well-balanced game, both in terms of its pacing and its mix of standard historical and fantastical units\\". It was a nominee for PC Gamer USs \\"2002 Best Real-Time Strategy Game\\" award, which ultimately went to Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos. =Scientific study= Age of Mythologys artificial intelligence (AI) was used by four Austrian researchers‚ÄîChristoph Hermann, Helmuth Melcher, Stefan Rank and Robert Trappl‚Äîin a study into the value of emotions in real-time strategy games. According to the abstract, \\"We were interested whether incorporating a simple emotional model to an existing bot- script improves playing strength.\\" The results of the study determined that of the four bots they tested, the neurotic bot was most capable of defeating Age of Mythologys default AI, followed by the aggressive one. Neither bot was defeated by the standard AI, but the neurotic bot won, on average, twenty five percent more rapidly. Plans were made to extend the research in the future by pitting the neurotic bot against a human player.

Life =Early years= Wartime in Germany Regine Radischewski was born in Berlin during the war, the second of her parents' two recorded children. Her father was a pianist who worked as an accompanist at the National Ballet Academy. Her mother would later own a small tobacconist shop. When she was two the family were evacuated from central Berlin to countryside far to the east of Germany, and shortly after that they were bombed out, losing most of their material possessions. Dr. Regine Hildebrandt (1990) Growing up The war ended in May 1945 and the family ended up back in Berlin. For the first five or six years of her schooling she attended a school in a western occupation zone of the city (\\"West Berlin\\"), but as the political division between the Soviet occupation zone and the western occupation zones became more stark and, it seemed, more permanent, her parents opted on her behalf for a school in the Soviet zone in what had by now become known as East Berlin. The family home was in the city centre along Bernauer Stra√üe (\\"Bernau Street\\") which formed the (initially hard to spot) political border between East Berlin and West Berlin, and afforded Regine a ring-side seat in the cold wall drama until September 1961 when the family were forcibly relocated in connection with the building of the Berlin Wall. In October 1961 she co-founded and joined the interdenominational choir at Berlin's (Protestant) Cathedral, which now flourished under the musical direction of a man called Herbert Hildebrand. =Middle years= The student From 1959-64, she studied biology at the Humboldt University in East Berlin.

Her failure to join seems to have been a result of timetable clashes involving her commitment to singing in the church choir. Failure to enroll in the FDJ had nevertheless led to her application for the university course to be initially rejected; and subsequent failure as an adult to become a Party Member would constrain her career opportunities right up until 1989. A career in research Between 1964 and 1978 Regine Radischewski worked in a management position involving Quality Control in the pharmacology department of VEB Berlin-Chemie, a major conglomerate in East Berlin. Hildebrandt combined her responsibilities in the pharmaceuticals department with a medicines research project at the Humboldt University which led to her receiving her doctorate in 1978. In 1978 she took a senior research position at Berlin's Centre for the Study of Metabolism Illnesses and Diabetes, heading up the Diabetes department until 1990.Regine Hildebrandt obituary, Independent.co.uk; accessed 21 February 2016. During this period she had numerous research papers published. Family matters During these years she also found time, in 1966 to marry J√∂rg Hildebrandt, brother of the musical director of the choir in which they sang. The two had known each other through the church since 1950: they had also been near neighbours, with a shared childhood experience of living along the East‚ÄìWest front-line before 1961. The marriage produced three children, born in 1969, 1971 and 1974. Her research career left her with enough space to devote time to the family, which was very important to her. Her husband later recalled that they ate together each evening six days per week, and on Sundays had a family lunch in the middle of the day after getting back from church. When she died, aged 60, she would still be living with younger family members in a large \\"multi- generational family house\\" they had been able to have built after 1990. Interaction with the state The family participated the political life of the one-party dictatorship only when they felt they had to. They did not vote in the country's sham elections because ¬ß22 of the constitution did not oblige them to vote (although the 1986 General election resulted, typically, in a reported turnout of 99.74%). Regine Hildebrand did join the national Trade Union Federation (FDGB/Freier Deutscher Gewerkschaftsbund) because not to have done so would have deprived her research colleagues of vital funding. When fraternal tanks appeared on the streets of Prague to crush political reform, the Hildebrandts joined in a protest demonstration outside the Czechoslovak embassy in Berlin. They would write letters of protest to the Party Central Committee and to Neues Deutschland, the party's mass-circulation official daily newspaper. Hildebrand assiduously read Neues Deutschland and followed other official media, if only to keep herself up to date with The Party's politically correct linguistic contrivances of the moment. The family never owned a television set, but news came from radio programmes broadcast from West Berlin or London, and from friends who visited from the west and were permitted (unlike East German citizens) to return to the west afterwards. =Politics= The summer of 1989 brought a dramatic change in her life when she, together with her husband, J√∂rg, was among the co-founders of Democracy Now, which sought an alliance of Christians and critical Marxists \\"to think about our future, to think about a society based on solidarity\\". The Social Democrats On 12 October 1989 she joined the Social Democratic Party (SPD) which (in East Germany) had been re-founded five days earlier. The Hildebrandts valued the embracing compassionate socialism of the moderate left which had been nurtured and demonstrated by iconic (western) SPD figures from the recent past such as Kurt Schumacher and Willy Brandt. A year later, following reunification, in October 1990 the party would merge formally with the West German Social Democratic Party (SDP). National ministerial office 1990 was the year in which, for rather less than a year, she became an important Social Democratic participant in the national politics of the German Democratic Republic (GDR). National elections in the GDR had traditionally operated according to a single list system which offered the voters only one list of (carefully preselected) candidates. Anyone wishing to vote against the list could do so by placing the ballot paper in a separate ballot box while the officials looked on: few did. But on 18 March 1990 the German Democratic Republic conducted its first (and as matters turned out, last) democratically configured general election. The Social Democrats took 21.9% of the vote which entitled them to 88 seats in the country's first freely elected National legislative assembly (Volkskammer). One of the seats went to Hildebrand, representing the Berlin electoral district. She also joined the coalition government of Lothar de Maizi√®re, serving between April and August 1990 as the East German Minister for Labour and Social Affairs. A political decision had been taken to convert East German currency into western Marks at a one-for one rate (except in respect of very large amounts), and Hildebrandt's priority as a government minister was tackling growing unemployment in east Germany, following economic disruption associated with the ongoing reunification process. The governing coalition started to splinter in August 1990 leading to the withdrawal of the Social Democrats from it, as a result of which Regine Hildebrandt terminated her career as a government minister at the national level. The next month, however, in 1990 she was elected to the national committee of the SPD (for the whole of Germany, even though national reunification would not be formally enacted till October). Minister in Brandenburg Hildebrandt now became a key SPD figure in the state politics of Brandenburg. In October 1990, the state tier of government was reintroduced to what had been the German Democratic Republic, and as part of the process elections took place for a new state parliament in Brandenburg on 26 October. Hildebrandt was elected as an SPD member and then appointed to ministerial office under minister-president Manfred Stolpe: from 1 November 1990 onwards she served as Brandenburg's Minister for Labour, Social affairs, Health and Women, in effect an expanded version of the ministerial portfolio she had been handling nationally earlier in the year. She was a popular and effective minister, often hitting the headlines with less than diplomatic outbursts, always charmingly reasonable but also forcefully persuasive with key colleagues when, as often happened, issues within her ministerial ambit came down to arguments about funding. In the popular media she frequently attracted the soubriquet \\"Mother Courage\\". In the 1999 Brandenburg state election the Social Democrats lost their absolute majority and minister- president Manfred Stolpe prepared to form a \\"grand coalition\\" with the centre- right CDU party. Hildebrand was already seriously ill and had strongly campaigned for an alternative alliance, with the left-wing PDS. She resigned from the state government. The Hildebrandts and the state prime minister Manfred Stolpe had known one another since the 1960s through their church connections, though they had not been aware at every level of Stolpe's complicated and possibly at times collaborative relationship with the Ministry for State Security during the years of the dictatorship. After her resignation from the government Hildebrand and Stolpe would continue to treasure one another's friendship, and remain political allies, until Hildebrandt's death in 2001. Nationally in December 1999 and again in November 2001, a few weeks before she died, Hildebrand topped the polls in the elections to the national executive of the Social Democratic Party. Death In July 1996 it became known that Regine Hildebrandt had breast cancer. She died at age 60 on 26 November 2001 in Woltersdorf, Brandenburg.

A sideboy is a member of an even-numbered group of seamen posted in two rows at the quarterdeck when a visiting dignitary boards or leaves the ship, historically to help (or even hoist) him aboard, in a ceremony known as tending the Side. Presently, Sideboys are used only for ceremonial purposes and not always aboard ships. For example, they may be used for Change of Command and Retirement ceremonies. Sideboys are instructed by the piping of the Boatswain's Mate. Despite the seemingly sex-specific name of this function, in reality the sideboy function may be performed by either male or female members of the ship's complement. Since 1843, United States Navy regulations have stipulated the number of sideboys according to the importance of the guests, which are similarly entitled to other honors; viz., the number of ruffles and flourishes and the number of cannon fired as a salute. It is traditional to post sideboys to honor superior officers. Anywhere from two to eight sideboys can be placed; this depends on the officer's rank or paygrade. The President rates the maximum number of sideboys (8), as does the Vice President and the Chief of Naval Operations.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a Grade II* listed building, having been designated on 25 February 1952, and has been described as \\"the most refined little building in Manchester\\". The library was established as a result of a meeting of Manchester businessmen in 1802 which resolved to found an \\"institute uniting the advantages of a newsroom and a library\\". A visit by four of the men to the Athenaeum in Liverpool inspired them to achieve a similar institution in Manchester. Money was raised through 400 subscriptions from Manchester men and the library opened in 1806. The library, mainly focused on 19th-century literature, was designed by Thomas Harrison, architect of Liverpool's Lyceum and built by one of the founders, David Bellhouse. Its first secretary, Peter Mark Roget, began his thesaurus here. Today the ground floor is tenanted by The Bank, a public house that takes its name from the Bank of Athens that leased the property in 1921. The library occupies what became the first floor with its entrance on Charlotte Street. Architecture The sign above the entrance to the library The library was the first Greek Revival building in the city. Its interior was inspired by John Soane. The library has a rectangular plan and is constructed in sandstone ashlar on a corner site at 57 Mosley Street. It has two storeys and a basement and roof space. Its facade on Mosley Street has a three-bay pedimented loggia with four Ionic columns set slightly forward and steps between the columns. Under the loggia are two entrance doors and three square windows at first floor level. The Charlotte Street facade has an entrance into the loggia with a square window above and another on the first floor. A five- bay colonnade of Ionic semi-columns has tall sashed windows on the ground floor in each bay and square window above at first floor level. The attic storey is behind a pilastered parapet. Originally the reading room was on the ground floor and the library occupied the remainder of the ground floor and a mezzanine gallery. A glass-domed ceiling was inserted at gallery level in about 1920 to separate the new tenants from what remained of the library.  Prizes  The Portico Library, in conjunction with its cultural partners and funders, hosts a series of literary prizes throughout the year to celebrate writers and poets from Northern England and beyond. The Portico Prize for Literature was established in 1985 and awarded biennially to a work of fiction or poetry and a work of non-fiction set wholly or mainly in the north of England. The library launched the Sadie Massey Award to celebrate the North West's young writers in 2015.  Notable members  The library's first chairman was John Ferriar and its secretary was Peter Mark Roget. Other notable members include John Dalton, Reverend William Gaskell, Sir Robert Peel and more recently Eric Cantona.

Over his more than 40-year career, he appeared in more than nine hundred productions on stage and screen. Life and career Born in Dade City in Pasco County, near Tampa, Florida, Roberts began his acting career on the stage, first appearing on Broadway in May 1931 before making his motion picture debut in Gold Bricks, a 1936 two-reel comedy short released by 20th Century-Fox. He appeared in numerous films in secondary parts and returned to perform on Broadway in such productions as Twentieth Century, My Sister Eileen, and Carnival in Flanders until he began making guest appearances on television series. After appearing on Gale Storm's My Little Margie in 1956, he became part of several television series for which he is best remembered. In a show that was the precursor to The Love Boat, Roberts played the ship's captain for four years in Storm's next hit, Oh! Susanna, which aired on CBS and ABC from 1956 to 1960. He guest-starred in scores of series, including the western-themed crime drama, Sheriff of Cochise, the western series, My Friend Flicka, The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp (as Texas cattle baron Shanghai Pierce), and The Travels of Jaimie McPheeters, and Brian Keith's Cold War drama, Crusader. Roberts appeared on four episodes of the CBS legal drama, Perry Mason, including the role of murderer Arthur Janeel in the 1961 episode, \\"The Case of the Malicious Mariner.\\" During the middle 1960s, Roberts was one of the most recognizable faces on television, and had recurring roles concurrently on a number of popular programs, including: *Bank president Mr. Cheever on CBS's The Lucy Show *John Cushing, president of the rival Merchants Bank on CBS's The Beverly Hillbillies *Railroad president Norman Curtis on CBS's Petticoat Junction *Darrin's father Frank Stephens on ABC's Bewitched, alternating with actor Robert F. Simon depending upon availability. *Banker Harry Bodkin on CBS's Gunsmoke *Neighbor Bruce MacDermott on ABC's Our Man Higgins *Preston \\"Press\\" Wasco and Kelly on the NBC western, Laredo *\\"Doc\\" on John Payne's The Restless Gun in the 1957 episode \\"Trail to Sunset\\" *Banker George Bristol on NBC's Bonanza *Admiral Rogers on McHale's Navy (in some episodes, his first name is given as \\"John\\" and in others his name is given as \\"Bruce\\"). *Capt. Walter A. Bascom in three episodes of the religion anthology series, Crossroads *The Governor in a season two episode of Green Acres, \\"One of Our Assemblymen is Missing\\". In the 1940s and 1950s, Roberts was a regular in many films noir, including Force of Evil (1948), He Walked by Night (1948), Nightmare Alley (1947), The Brasher Doubloon (1947), Borderline (1950) and The Enforcer (1951). In 1953, he appeared as Vincent Price's character's crooked business partner (and first victim) in House of Wax. In 1956 he was Colonel Sam Sherman in The First Texan. In 1962 Roberts appeared as John Kemper on the TV western Lawman in the episode titled \\"Heritage of Hate.\\" He also appeared in the neo-noirs The Outfit (1973) and Chinatown (1974). He also had a small role in the hit 1963 Stanley Kramer comedy, It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World as a police officer. Unfortunately, his role was cut from later television and movie versions to reduce running time. However, because of an interest in restoring IAMMMMW to its original length, Roberts' brief role has seen life again in versions made for laserdisc and extended-length DVDs. Roberts appeared in an episode of the situation comedy A Touch of Grace in 1973. His last television appearance was on the 21 January 1974 CBS broadcast of Here's Lucy. In that installment, \\"Lucy Is N.G. As An R.N.\\", Roberts played a veterinarian. Death Roberts died in Los Angeles, California, of a heart attack on 28 May 1975 and was interred at Greenwood Memorial Park in Fort Worth, Texas.

It offers a Juris Doctor and three Master of Laws programs, including one that is exclusively online,\\"How to enroll in America's first LLM Program\\". http://llmprogram.org. as well as a combined J.D./M.B.A. with San Diego State University. The school is not approved by the American Bar Association (ABA), following the ABA's withdrawal of approval in December 2019. However, it is currently approved by the California State Bar‚Äôs Committee of Bar Examiners. As a result, graduates are generally not able to take the bar or practice law outside of California.  History  The Thomas Jefferson School of Law was founded in 1969 as the San Diego campus of the Western State University College of Law and operated as such until 1995, when it became independent. It joined the Association of American Law Schools in 2008.AALS Member Schools In January 2011, TJSL moved to a new, building located in the East Village district of downtown San Diego. In 2018, the school announced it would vacate its building as a cost-cutting measure, moving into an office building in downtown San Diego.  Accreditation  TJSL received approval from the American Bar Association (ABA) in 1996. The ABA revoked the school's accreditation on June 10, 2019. This followed a public censure by the ABA in 2018 and a 2017 decision to place the school on probation for being out of compliance with the ABA requirement that schools admit only students who appear capable of earning a J.D. degree and passing the bar examination.https://www.voiceofsandiego.org/topics/education/beset-by- problems-thomas-jefferson-law-school-is-trying-to-avoid-a-death-blow/ In October 2018, TJSL became a California state accredited school, allowing its students to take the California Bar Exam.http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/thomas_jefferson_school_of_law_wins_California_accreditation  Academics  The program offers Master of Laws (LL.M.), Master of Science of Law (M.S.L) and JSD \\"Doctor of Laws or Juridical Science\\" degrees. Certificate Programs in International Financial Centers, United States Taxation, E-commerce, Anti-Money Laundering & Compliance, and Trusts and Estate Planning are available.\\"Advanced Diploma and Certificate Law Programs\\" Faculty for the program are generally part-time and populated with industry professionals.\\"LLM and JSD Faculty\\" Students begin classes in August, attend the three-year, full-time program or the four-year, part-time program, and can accelerate graduation one semester by taking additional classes during the summer. Day and evening classes are offered.  Bar pass rate and rankings  = Bar pass rates = The July 2019 California bar pass rate for TJSL graduates was 22% for first time takers and 18% for repeat takers, vs. statewide averages of 71% and 36%, respectively. = Rankings = The ranking of the School of Law by U.S. News & World Report is not published, as U.S. News does not publish the ranking of schools that fall below 145. The School of Law is not ranked in National Jurist's rankings of the top 80 law schools in the United States  Costs and student debt  The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law for the 2018‚Äì2019 academic year is $77,660. Law School Transparency estimated debt-financed cost of attendance for three years at $297,652. According to U.S. News & World Report, the average indebtedness of 2018 graduates who incurred law school debt was $196,607 (not including undergraduate debt), and 92% of 2018 graduates took on debt. The average indebtedness of graduates who incurred law school debt is second-highest among US law schools. The school's Associate Dean for Student Affairs has attributed the average debt level to the school's admittance of immigrants and those who are the first in their family to attend law school‚Äîpeople who are statistically more likely to lack individual or family resources.  Post- graduation employment  According to Thomas Jefferson School of Law's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 19% of the Class of 2018 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. In 2013, the National Law Journal reported the college has the worst unemployment rate after graduation (31.5%) amongst all law schools in the country. In January 2011, a New York Times article about the inability of many recent law school graduates to get jobs discussed Thomas Jefferson's claim that 92% of the class of 2009 was employed within nine months of graduation.(1/08/11) Is Law School a Losing Game? The New York Times The school's claim was based on a survey of the class of 2009. (Under ABA rules, 25% of graduates who do not participate in employment surveys are counted as employed.). The Wall Street Journal also ran a story in June 2012 listing TJSL as one of the 'bottom five' schools for 2011 graduate employment. In May 2011, Anna Alaburda filed a class-action lawsuit against her alma mater, alleging that the law school had committed fraud by publishing deceptive post-graduation employment statistics and salary data in order to bait new students into enrolling. Alaburda, a 2008 honors graduate, claimed that despite having graduated at the top of her class and passed the California bar exam, she was unable to find suitable legal employment, and had racked up more than $150,000 in student loan debt. This is the first time a law school would stand trial for allegedly inflating its employment statistics. The jury found in favor of TJSL with a 9‚Äì3 verdict.  Center for Solo Practitioners  Since Fall 2012, TJSL has operated a lawyer incubator program called the Center for Solo Practitioners. The incubator provides space and support for selected alumni who are going into solo practice. It is also intended to help serve under-represented communities. At the 2013 annual meeting of the American Bar Association, the Center for Solo Practitioners was honored with an ABA award in recognition of \\"successful implementation of a project or program specifically targeted to solo and small-firm lawyers.\\"  Additional programs offered  = Intellectual property = In 2009, TJSL initiated an Intellectual Property Fellowship Program for students with undergraduate or advanced degrees in the hard sciences or engineering.

Russian control was decisively confirmed with Iran by the Treaty of Turkmenchay of 1828.  History  The precursor of the Karabakh khanate, the Safavid province of Karabagh, was one of the provinces established in the northern part of the Safavid Empire.Rahmani A. A. Azerbaijan in the late 16th and 17th centuries (1590‚Äì1700). Baku,1981, pp.87‚Äì89 The Safavid shah of Iran Tahmasp I (r. 1524-1576) granted the governance of the province to a branch of the Qajars, the Ziyadoglu, in 1540.(A collection of articles on the history of Azerbaijan, edition 1, Baku, 1949, p. 250 It was initially founded in the lowland part of Karabakh (\\"Karabakh Steppe\\"), away from the lands currently known as Nagorno- Karabakh. According to a prominent historian who hailed from the Karabakh Khanate - Mirza Adigozal Bey; \\"The power of the Karabakh beylerbeylik covered a vast territory ‚Äì from the Georgian border near ‚ÄúSinig Korpu‚Äù Bridge (currently ‚Äúred Bridge‚Äù) to Khudafarin Bridge on the Araz river.Mirza Adigozal-bey, Karabakh-nameh, Baku, 1950, p.47 However, following the collapse of Safavid Empire and the death of Nader Shah Afshar in 1747, the Safavid domain split into several khanates with various forms of autonomy. During this period, Panah-Ali khan Javanshir of Karabakh consolidated his local power by establishing a de facto independent khanate and subordinating the five Armenian meliks (princes) in the region, which were referred to as Khamsa (\\"five\\" in Arabic),Raffi. Melikdoms of Khamsa with support of the Armenian prince Melik Shahnazar II Shahnazarian of Varanda, who first accepted Panah- Ali Khan's suzerainty. The capital of the khanate was first the castle of \\"Bayat\\" in 1748, in the Karabakh Steppe, followed by the newly built town of Panahabad in 1750‚Äì1752. During the reign of Ibrahim-Khalil khan, son of Panah- Ali khan, Panahabad became a large town and was renamed to Shusha, apparently after the name of a nearby Armenian village Shushi, known also as Shushikent, Shoshi or Shosh.Raffi.

Fathali Shah to Mehdi gholi Javanshir -Page 1 Fathali Shah to Mehdi gholi Javanshir - Page 2. Mehdi gholi Javanshir is called as the Beylerbeygi (Administrator) of the Karabakh vilayaat (province) In less than a year after Shusha was founded, the Karabakh khanate was attacked by Mohammad Hasan Khan Qajar, one of the major claimants to the Iranian throne. During the Safavid rule, Karabakh was for almost two centuries governed by the Turkic-speaking clan of Qajar, as they were appointed governors of the Ganja-Karabakh province. It was due to that, that Mohammed Hasan Khan Qajar considered Karabakh his hereditary estate. Mohammad Hasan Khan besieged Panahabad, but soon had to retreat because of the attack on his own domain by one of his major opponents to the Iranian throne, Karim Khan Zand. His retreat was so hasty that he even left his cannons under the walls of Shusha fortress. Panah Ali khan counterattacked the retreating troops of Mohammad Hasan Khan and even briefly took Ardabil across the Aras River in Azerbaijan. In 1759, the Karabakh Khanate underwent a new attack from Fath-Ali Khan Afshar, ruler of Urmia. With his 30,000-strong army Fatali khan also managed to gain support from the meliks (feudal vassals) of Jraberd and Talysh (Gulistan), however melik Shahnazarian of Varanda continued to support Panah Ali Khan. The siege of Shusha lasted for six months and Fatali khan eventually had to retreat. In 1761, Karim Khan Zand allied with Panah Ali Khan of Karabakh to defeat Fat'h Ali Khan Afshar of Urmia, who earlier subordinated the khanates of Karabakh, Marageh, and Tabriz. In 1762, during his war with Kazem Khan of Qaradagh, Panah Khan submitted to Karim Khan Zand, who was consolidating different Khans under his Rule and was about to besiege Urmia. After the fall of the city, Karim took Panah Khan among the hostages to Shiraz, where he soon died. Panah-Ali Khan's son Ibrahim-Khalil Khan was sent back to Karabakh as governor. Under Ibrahim-Khalil khan Javanshir, the Karabakh khanate became one of the strongest entities of the South Caucasus and Shusha turned into a big town. According to travelers who visited Shusha at the end of 18th-early 19th centuries the town had about 2,000 houses and an approximate population of 10,000. In the summer of 1795, Shusha underwent a major attack by Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, son of Mohammad Hasan khan who attacked Shusha in 1752. Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar's goal was to end with the feudal fragmentation and to restore the old Safavid imperial domain. For this purpose, he also wanted to proclaim himself shah (king) of Iran. However, according to Safavid tradition, the shah had to control the South Caucasus and southern Dagestan before his coronation. Therefore, Karabakh khanate and its fortified capital Shusha were the first and major obstacle to achieve these ends. Aga Mohammad Khan Qajar besieged Shusha with his 80,000 strong army. Ibrahim Khalil khan mobilized the population for long-term defense. The number of militia in Shusha reached 15,000 and women fought alongside the men. The Armenian population of Karabakh also actively participated in this struggle against the invaders and fought side by side with the Muslim population jointly organizing ambushes in the mountains and forests. The siege lasted for 33 days. Not being able to capture Shusha, Agha Mohammad Khan ceased the siege and advanced to Tiflis (present-day Tbilisi), which, despite desperate resistance, was occupied and exposed to unprecedented destruction, with many thousands of its inhabitants carried off to mainland Iran. In 1797, Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar, who by that time had already managed to declare himself Shah, and had swiftly either re-occupied or re-subjugated the entire Caucasus that previously made up part of Iran for centuries, decided now to carry out a second attack on Karabakh, as its khan was not letting him nor his armies enter the city. Nevertheless, the khan of Karabakh had already been paying regular tribute to Agha Mohammad Khan since the aftermath of the first attack in 1795. In this new siege, Agha Mohammad Khan devastated the surrounding villages near Shusha. The population could not recover from the previous 1795 attack and also suffered from a serious drought which lasted for three years. The artillery of the enemy also caused serious losses to the city defenders. Thus, in 1797 Aga Mohammad Khan succeeded in seizing Shusha and Ibrahim Khalil Khan was forced to flee to Dagestan. However, several days after the seizure of Shusha, Agha Mohammad Khan was killed in enigmatic circumstances by his bodyguards. Ibrahim-Khalil Khan returned Agha Mohammad Shah's body to Tehran, and in return, the new king Fath-Ali Shah Qajar (r. 1797-1834) appointed him the governor of Karabakh and married his daughter Agha Beyim. Agha Baji, as she came to be called, was brought to court accompanied by her brother Abol' Fath Khan, and became Fath' Ali Shah's twelfth wife; highly respected at the court, for some reason remained a virgin. During the rule of Ibrahim-Khalil khan, the Karabakh khanate grew in importance and established ties with other neighbouring khanates. In 1805, an agreement was made between the Karabakh khanate and the Russian Empire. According to this agreement, the Karabakh khan recognized supremacy and dominance of the Russian Empire,Gammer, Moshe (1992). Muslim resistance to the tsar. Routledge, 6. . ‚ÄúIn 1805 the khans of Qarabagh, Shirvan, and Sheki swore allegiance to Russia.‚Äù gave up his right to carry out independent foreign policy, and took the obligation to pay the Russian Treasury 8 thousand gold roubles a year. In its turn, the Czarist government took obligation not to infringe upon the right of the legitimate successors of the Karabakh khan to administer the internal affairs of their possessions. However, in the same year, Russians reneged on the agreement, apparently acting on suspicion that Ibrahim-Khalil Panah Khan was a traitor. He was killed near Shusha together with some members of his family by Major Lisanevich. The Russian Empire finally gained control over Karabakh through the Treaty of Gulistan (1813) and Treaty of Turkmenchay (1828) after defeating Iran in the Russo-Persian Wars.

A Karabakh province was created in its place, administered by Russian officials. The descendants of Panah Khan subsequently scattered around Iran with some remaining. Abdul Wakil Panah Khan became the Emir of Greater Khorasan. Abul-Fath Khan Javanshir, was one of the sons of the Ibrahim-Khalil Javanshir, that through his sister brother-in-law of Fath-Alƒ´ Shah Qajar. In the First Russo-Persian War Abul-Fath Khan supported the Iranians and fought on the side of the crown prince Abbas Mirza. After Karabakh was ceded to Russia; and even before it, Abul-Fath Khan withdrew from Karabakh along with his fellow tribesmen, and AbbƒÅs Mirza made him governor of DezmƒÅr. DezamƒÅr lay on a southern tributary of the Aras, which flowed into the main river at Ordubad. In the years following 1813 Abul-Fath Khan smuggled his warriors back across the Aras into southern Karabakh and took up residence in the village of Garmƒ´ (eight farsangs south of Shusha). Presumably, this must have been done with the connivance of his brother Mahdiqoli Khan Javanshir, who had succeeded his father in 1806 as governor of Shusha in the service of the Russians. In 1818, long before the outbreak of the Second Russo-Persian War, Abbas Mirza invaded the territory to which the Russians laid claim and which was de facto under their sovereignty; supported by 100 horsemen, he brought Abul-Fath Khan back by force. What happened to Abul-Fath Khan thereafter is not known; he does not appear to have taken part in the battles of the Second Russo-Persian War. His brother Mahdƒ´-qolƒ´ Khan crossed into Iranian soil in 1822. Under the terms of the peace of Torkmanchay in 1828, the whole of Karabakh was finally ceded to Russia. Army Karabakh Khanate never had a permanent army, but those who were a certain age and had the ability to serve in the military were written in a special register. When it was necessary, soldiers were called together with local landlords, meliks and beks.Bilal Dedeyev, Qarabag Xanliginin Idare Sistemi, Ictimai-Iqtisadi, Medeni, Etnik Veziyyeti ve Ordusu, in Qarabag:Bildiklerimiz ve Bilmediklerimiz, Edited by Reha Yilmaz, Qafqaz University Press, Baku 2010, p.167 The persons whose names were included in the register with volunteers created the Army of Karabakh Khanate, but they were deployed only in cases of real war or emergency. Sometimes, especially in urgent circumstances, the soldiers from Dagestan were invited and joined to companies. For example, when Agha Muhammad Khan Qajar seized Shusha for 33 days, part of soldiers who were defending Shusha were soldiers from Dagestan.Mirza Camaloglu, Panah Xan ve Ibrahim Xanin Qarabagda hakimiyyetleri ve o zamanin hadiseleri, in Qarabagnameler, II, Baku 1991, p.243 During the rule of Ibrahim Khalil Khan, the Army Register contained more than 12.000 names.

He is one of the most famous and popular German actors of the 20th century, and is considered a German film legend. R√ºhmann is best known for playing the part of a comic ordinary citizen in film comedies such as Three from the Filling Station and The Punch Bowl. During his later years, he was also a respected character actor in films such as The Captain from K√∂penick and It Happened in Broad Daylight. His only English-speaking movie was Ship of Fools in 1964. Biography = Early life = R√ºhmann was born in Essen as the son of a restaurateur. He started his acting career during the early 1920s and appeared in numerous theatres in Germany during the following years. His role in the 1930 movie Die Drei von der Tankstelle (The Three from the Filling Station) led him to film stardom. He remained highly popular as a comedic actor (and sometime singer) throughout the 1930s and early 1940s. He remained in Germany and continued to work during the Nazi period, as did his friend and colleague, Hans Albers. = Career during the Third Reich = During the 1933-45 period, he acted in 37 films and directed four. After January 1933, R√ºhmann did not speak openly about German politics, but instead kept himself as neutral as possible. He never stated a word against or towards the Nazis in the press, although he had been a supporter of democracy. In 1938, he divorced his Jewish wife Maria Bernheim, who then left Germany and travelled to Stockholm where she married a Swedish actor. The divorce caused R√ºhmann to be accused by some of wanting to secure his career; however, the marriage had probably already fallen apart, and some sources say that he wanted to protect his wife with the divorce.Franz Josef G√∂rtz, Hans Sarkowicz: Heinz R√ºhmann, 1902‚Äì1994. Der Schauspieler und sein Jahrhundert. 2001, p. 193. After 1945, Bernheim defended her ex-husband against accusations of opportunism.Article at Der Tagesspiegel His second wife, Hertha Feiler, whom he married shortly after, had a Jewish grandfather, a fact that caused R√ºhmann problems with the Nazi cultural authorities. R√ºhmann retained his reputation as an apolitical star during the entire Nazi era. Heinz R√ºhmann as director (sitting on a footstool, behind the camera), 1942 During the war years, R√ºhmann, like others, was co-opted by the State in some films. His role as lead actor in the comedy Quax the Crash Pilot was supposed to distract the populace from the war. In 1941, under the direction of Reichsfilmkammer president Carl Froelich, R√ºhmann played the title role in Der Gasmann, about a gas-meter reader who is suspected of foreign espionage. In 1944, the premiere of Die Feuerzangenbowle was forbidden by the Nazi film censor for \\"disrespect for authority\\". Through his good relationships with the regime, however, R√ºhmann was able to screen the film in public. He brought the film to the F√ºhrerhauptquartier Wolfsschanze for a private screening for Hermann G√∂ring and others. Afterward, G√∂ring was able to get the ban on the film lifted by Adolf Hitler. A nostalgic comedy of mistaken identities, the film was probably the most popular film of his career and later became a cult hit among college students. As a \\"state actor\\", the highest title for an actor during the Nazi era, R√ºhmann was not drafted into the Wehrmacht. He did have to take the basic training to become a military pilot, but for the State, R√ºhmann was more valuable as an actor and he was spared having to take part in the war effort. In August 1944, Joseph Goebbels put R√ºhmann on the Gottbegnadeten list of indispensable actors.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main (2007) p. 502 R√ºhmann was a favorite actor of Holocaust diarist Anne Frank, who pasted his picture on the wall of her room in her family's hiding place during the war, where it can still be seen today. The enormous range of R√ºhmann's popularity during the Nazi era is illustrated by the fact that he was also a favorite actor of Adolf Hitler and his propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. = Postwar career = R√ºhmann had a difficult time resuming his career after the war, but by the mid-1950s, the former comedian had established himself again as a star, only this time as Germany's leading character actor. In 1956, R√ºhmann starred in the title role of the internationally acclaimed picture Der Hauptmann von K√∂penick (The Captain of K√∂penick), the true story of a Prussian cobbler, Wilhelm Voigt, who dressed up as an army officer and took over the town hall in K√∂penick. In the days of the German Empire, the army had an exalted status and Voigt embarrassed the army officers and civil servants who obeyed him without question. R√ºhmann was also the leading man in the 1960 film version of The Adventures of the Good Soldier Schweik, after the novel by Czech author Jaroslav Ha≈°ek. He also played the role of Father Brown in three German films during the 1960s. In 1965, R√ºhmann was brought to Hollywood by producer Stanley Kramer for a supporting role as a German Jew in his all-star movie Ship of Fools. His wife Hertha Feiler died in 1970 and R√ºhmann married his third wife Hertha Droemer in 1974. In his later years, he also worked as a recitator for German television. His last film was Faraway, So Close! (1993) by Wim Wenders, in which he played an old fatherly chauffeur named Konrad. R√ºhmann died in October 1994, aged 92 years. He was buried in Berg-Aufkirchen, Bavaria. His popularity with German audiences continues: In 1995, he was posthumously awarded the Goldene Kamera as the \\"Greatest German Actor of the Century\\"; in 2006, a poll voted him number one in the ZDF TV-show Unsere Besten ‚Äì Favorite German Actors.

He also won a schools athletics vest for Yorkshire as a sprinter and triple jumper and competed in the national schools championships. He was involved in a serious car accident in 1975 and eye injuries prevented him playing rugby for more than two years.Bradford Star 9 May 1985 In 1978 he joined Wakefield RFC as a scrum half in the third team before moving to centre and finally right wing for the first team where he played in over 300 games. He has played 53 times for Yorkshire between 1981Barnsley Chronicle 6 November 1981 and 1996. He also represented the North of England against Fiji (1982) and Australia (1984). Harrison made his England debut during the 1985 tour to New Zealand at the relatively advanced age of 29. England lost both tests, but Harrison scored a breakaway try in each to earn himself the nickname \\"Burglar Bill\\". Subsequently a local brewery named a drink \\"Burglar Bill\\" after him.*Wakefield Rugby Football Club‚Äî1901‚Äì2001 A Centenary History. Written and compiled by David Ingall in 2001 By 1987, Harrison had become a regular fixture in the side, playing in 14 of the next 15 England matches, including all four games of the 1987 Five Nations, one of which was as captain. His appointment came about when current skipper and scrum-half Richard Hill was suspended for allegedly inciting a violent clash with Wales. Mike's first game in charge resulted in victory over Scotland and he marked the occasion with a try. He kept the captaincy for the inaugural World Cup in New Zealand in 1987 where he led by example and enjoyed good try-scoring form. In the opening match against Australia, Harrison scored another breakaway try to give his side a surprise lead. England remained in contention at 6‚Äì6 but could not respond to losing full-back Marcus Rose to concussion and a highly controversial try scored by David Campese. England lost 19‚Äì6, but came back to crush Japan, Harrison himself grabbing a hat-trick in thirteen minutes as England racked up ten tries. He scored his fifth try of the tournament against the USA, but England lost to Wales in the quarter-finals, thought by some to have been the worst match of the tournament. Harrison played the first two games of the 1988 Five Nations but was then dropped and never again called upon to represent his country.http://www.sporting-heroes.net/rugby- heroes/displayhero.asp?HeroID=3799 Mike Harrison currently works in banking and occasionally works as an expert summariser on the radio.

He was also the leader of the Czech Social Democratic Party (ƒåSSD) from 2006 until his resignation following the 2010 legislative election.  Early life and career  Paroubek was born in Olomouc and attended Jan Neruda Grammar School. He entered politics in 1970 at the age of 18, joining the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, a member party of the Czechoslovak National Front. He reached the lower levels of the party hierarchy before leaving the party in 1986. Paroubek spent his one-year military service as an army food services supervisor in the southern Bohemian city of Prachatice. After graduating in 1976, Paroubek worked as a manager for several state companies including (). In 1979, as an executive committee member of the Czechoslovak Socialist Party, one of the puppet parties of the Communist regime, he attracted the attention of the communist state secret police (StB). He met agents three times in meetings where he allegedly expressed loyalty to the communist government and disagreement with opposition groups such as Charter 77. He was assigned the code name Roko, after his pet parakeet, but never actually signed a cooperation agreement with the secret police, and after 1982 the cooperation ceased, as Paroubek \\"did not have enough potential and contacts\\". Following the Velvet Revolution in November 1989, Paroubek joined the re-established Social Democratic Party (ƒåSSD), and was given an executive post by chairman Ji≈ô√≠ Hor√°k. In 1993 he stood for chairmanship of the party but was defeated by Milo≈° Zeman. In 2000, he placed fourth in elections to the Senate of the Czech Republic in the Prague 8 district. Paroubek held senior positions in the Prague municipal government for over 14 years. Prime Ministership In August 2004 Paroubek was appointed Minister of Regional Development in the government of Stanislav Gross. After a government crisis in early 2005 related to Gross's personal financial affairs, Paroubek succeeded him to become the 6th Prime Minister of the Czech Republic on 25 April 2005. On 13 May 2005, Paroubek's government passed a vote of confidence in the chamber of deputies, with all 101 coalition-party members supporting the government and the 98 opposition members and one independent voting against. Paroubek's government, which was little changed from Gross's, led the country until the parliamentary elections of June 2006. On 30 July 2005, the CzechTek free techno party was broken up by around 1,000 riot police using tear gas and water cannons, claiming the event participants had damaged private property. The police actions left around 80 people and several police officers injured, leading to public protests in front of the Czech interior ministry. Paroubek had spoken in favour of the action beforehand and subsequently defended it, stating that the participants were \\"not dancing children but dangerous people\\", but was criticised for the raid by President V√°clav Klaus. Opposition parties and the media condemned the government, with some drawing comparisons between the actions of Paroubek's government and crackdowns against students by the communist government in 1989. Role in the Czech legislative election, 2006 Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek attacked with eggs at a rally for European parliament elections 2009, Prague Paroubek was selected as the election leader for the 2006 elections and at a ƒåSSD party congress in mid-May was elected uncontested as the new chairman with 90% of the vote. The election campaign was highly combative due to deep animosity between ƒåSSD, the conservative Civic Democratic Party (ODS), and their respective party leaders. In May 2006, a report by Jan Kubice, head of the Czech Police's organized crime unit, was released. The so-called \\"Kubice Report\\" accused Paroubek of having links with the criminal underworld, as well as participating in a murder cover-up, attempts to derail police investigations and attempting to criminalise investigating officers. The report was initially classified and was presented to the proper commission of the Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Parliament, but was made public four days before election day. Paroubek responded by accusing the opposition ODS of conspiracy and \\"putschist\\" tactics, and vowed to punish those responsible if elected. After the election Paroubek stated that \\"ODS did not abhor breaking many laws and did it on purpose four days before the elections to avoid establishing of this evident and repeated breaking of legal order. (...) I feel a duty to announce that democracy in this country incurred a hard intervention comparable maybe only with February 1948. Only with the difference that a blue totalitarianism looms.\\" Paroubek later publicly apologized for these comments. Although opinion polling put support for ƒåSSD at around 10% when Stanislav Gross resigned as Prime Minister, the party eventually received 32.3% in the elections and finished runner-up to ODS. On 9 September Paroubek released a document claiming it showed that the ODS planned to discredit him. Paroubek refused to name the source of this paper. Post Prime Ministership After the 2006 elections, Paroubek remained as leader of ƒåSSD in opposition, and stayed in this post until his resignation immediately after the result of the 2010 legislative election was announced on 29 May 2010. Although the Social Democrats became the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies after the election, they were unable to form a governing coalition and Paroubek subsequently resigned as leader of the party. On 9 October 2008, an official launch party was held for Paroubek's book The Czech Republic, Europe and the world through the eyes of a social democrat () in the Monarch restaurant in Prague. Shortly after the end of the event there was an altercation between two of the guests, businessman Bohum√≠r ƒéuriƒçko and V√°clav Koƒçka jr., the son of a carousel operator. Koƒçka was killed in the incident. ƒéuriƒçko was convicted of the murder and sentenced to 12.5 years in prison. Ji≈ô√≠ Paroubek initially distanced himself from the incident and claimed he did not know ƒéuriƒçko and had not invited him to the event. However, relations between Paroubek and ƒéuriƒçko had been publicly known since at least 2005, when Paroubek had planned to spend the holidays with ƒéuriƒçko's family, but cancelled the plans when it became known that ƒéuriƒçko was a communist secret service agent. On 7 October 2011, Paroubek left ƒåSSD and in the same month founded a new party called National Socialists ‚Äì 21st Century Left. Following the party's failure to win any seats in the Chamber of Deputies in the 2013 election, Paroubek announced his resignation from the party and retirement from politics in November 2014. In 2017, Paroubek repeatedly attempted to rejoin the Social Democratic Party. However, his bids were vetoed by local and regional party representatives. In June 2018, Paroubek wanted to stand as a Social Democrat candidate in the 2018 Senate elections. However, his nomination was blocked by the party committee. He subsequently stood as an independent candidate. In February 2018, Paroubek stated that he plans to run in the next Czech presidential election. He decided to run in the 2018 Senate election in Ostrava. He sought the nomination of ƒåSSD but subsequently ran as an independent. He received 7% of the vote and finished in 7th place, failing to win the seat.

The structure was built during the Early Bronze Age (21st century BC) but had crumbled to ruins by the 6th century BC of the Neo-Babylonian period, when it was restored by King Nabonidus. Its remains were excavated in the 1920s and 1930s by Sir Leonard Woolley. Under Saddam Hussein in the 1980s, they were encased by a partial reconstruction of the fa√ßade and the monumental staircase. The Ziggurat of Ur is the best-preserved of those known from Iran and Iraq, besides the ziggurat of Dur Untash (Chogha Zanbil). It is one of three well preserved structures of the Neo-Sumerian city of Ur, along with the Royal Mausolea and the Palace of Ur-Nammu (the E-hursag). Sumerian ziggurat Reconstruction of Ur-Nammu's ziggurat, based on the 1939 reconstruction by Woolley (vol. V, fig. 1.4) The ziggurat was built by King Ur-Nammu, who dedicated it in honour of Nanna/S√Æn in approximately the 21st century BC (short chronology) during the Third Dynasty of Ur. The massive step pyramid measured in length, in width and over in height. The height is speculative, as only the foundations of the Sumerian ziggurat have survived. The ziggurat was a piece in a temple complex that served as an administrative center for the city, and which was a shrine of the moon god Nanna, the patron deity of Ur. The construction of the ziggurat was finished in the 21st century BC by King Shulgi, who, in order to win the allegiance of cities, proclaimed himself a god. During his 48-year reign, the city of Ur grew to be the capital of a state controlling much of Mesopotamia. Many ziggurats were made by stacking mud-bricks up and using mud to seal them together. Neo-Babylonian restoration King Nabonidus, the last king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in the 6th century BC, after \\"finding little left but the last stage and nothing to guide him as to the monument's original appearance\\", had it restored in seven stages rather than three. Excavation and preservation William Loftus's sketch of his discovery of the ziggurat The remains of the ziggurat were rediscovered by William Loftus in 1850. The first excavations at the site were conducted by John George Taylor (mistakenly credited as \\"J. E. Taylor\\") in the 1850s, leading to the identification of the site as Ur. After World War I, preliminary excavations were performed by Reginald Campbell Thompson and Henry Hall. The site was extensively excavated in the 1920s by Sir Leonard Woolley by appointment of the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania and the British Museum in the period of 1922 to 1934. The remains of the ziggurat consist of a three-layered solid mass of mud brick faced with burnt bricks set in bitumen. The lowest layer corresponds to the original construction of Ur-Nammu, while the two upper layers are part of the Neo- Babylonian restorations. The fa√ßade of the lowest level and the monumental staircase were rebuilt under the orders of Saddam Hussein. The ziggurat was damaged in the Gulf War in 1991 by small arms fire and the structure was shaken by explosions. Four bomb craters can be seen nearby and the walls of the ziggurat are marred by over 400 bullet holes. As of 2008, the site is under the supervision of curator Dief Mohssein Naiif al-Gizzy.

There has been a revival of this cookery style in the 21st century. It is said that twelve dishes should be served along with rice and soup, with most dishes served in bangjja (bronzeware). History In the Dae Jang Geum theme park, a model of a royal kitchen in which gungnyeo (court ladies) worked was displayed Collectively known as gungjung eumsik during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. The opulent nature of the royalty is evidenced in examples as far back as the Silla kingdom, where a man-made lake (Anapji Lake, located in Gyeongju), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent banquets and a spring fed channel, Poseokjeong, was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat during the writing of poems.Pettid, 129 Reflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed from each of these areas to function as a showcase. The royalty had the finest regional delicacies sent to the palace. Although there are records of banquets pre-dating the Joseon period, the majority of these records note a vast variety of foods without mentioning the specific foods present.Pettid, 130. The meals cooked for the royal family were not seasonal, like a commoner's meal. Instead, they varied significantly day to day. The eight provinces were represented each month in turn in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors. This gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.Pettid, 132. Food held a very important place in Joseon period. Official positions were created within the Six Ministries (Yukjo, Ïú°Ï°∞) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (Ijo, Ïù¥Ï°∞) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rites (Yejo) were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making tofu, liquor, tea, and tteok (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-status families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or \\"bureaus\\" such as the Bureau of special foods (Saenggwa-bang, ÏÉùÍ≥ºÎ∞©) or the Bureau of cooking foods (Soju-bang, ÏÜåÏ£ºÎ∞©). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.Pettid, 130-132. Five meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full-course meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would consist of lighter fare. The first meal, mieumsang (ÎØ∏ÏùåÏÉÅ), was served at sunrise on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of rice porridge (juk, Ï£Ω) made with ingredients such as abalone (jeonbokjuk), white rice (huinjuk), mushrooms (beoseotjuk), pine nuts (jatjuk), and sesame (kkaejuk). The side dishes could consist of kimchi, nabak kimchi, oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.Pettid, 133. The sura (ÏàòÎùº) were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (surasang, ÏàòÎùºÏÉÅ), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (jjigae), one dish of jjim (meat stew), one dish of jeongol (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of kimchi, three types of jang (Ïû•) and twelve side dishes, or called 12 cheop (12Ï≤©). The meals were set in the suragan (ÏàòÎùºÍ∞Ñ), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as sura sanggung (ÏàòÎùºÏÉÅÍ∂Å). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring that the dishes were not poisoned.Pettid, 134-135. This Korean food heritage has been inscribed by the government as Important Intangible Cultural Property No. 38. Han Bongnyeo (ÌïúÎ≥µÎ†§ ; ÈüìÁ¶èÈ∫ó) is the current Living National Treasure as the keeper of this property. Surasang setting Surasang setting The surasang should be served with three tables and a hotpot. The largest round table at the right upper corner is the main table which contains main bowl, soups and stews, dishes, side dishes and fermented stored dishes. The small round table at the left upper corner contains red sura, gomtang or thick meat broth, dessert, tea, empty dishes and bowls. This table is also used to store the covers of bowls and dishes used in the main table. The rectangular table in the right lower corner contains eggs, sesame oil, various raw vegetables and several sauces. The hotpot at the left lower corner is heated with charcoal, and usually contains jeongol such as sinseollo. The setting was as follows:Pettid, Michael J.

Known by her World Championship Wrestling ring name Kimberly Page, she was the leader of The Nitro Girls and the valet for her then-husband wrestler Diamond Dallas Page. She appeared in Playboy newsstand pictorials from 1994 to 1999, and has been featured in Iron Man magazine for her fitness workouts. Biography Kimberly Bacon was born on New Year's Day in Chicago, Illinois, but grew up in Fort Myers, Florida. Shortly before she graduated from Auburn University with a degree in public relations and journalism in 1990, Kimberly met Page Falkinburg (Diamond Dallas Page) at his Florida nightclub in December 1989 when she was 20 years old, and started dating shortly after. Falkinburg was then a manager in World Championship Wrestling, while Kimberly graduated with a master's degree in advertising from Northwestern University in 1991 and worked in the industry for a brief time before joining him in the wrestling business. She appeared on the covers of both Physical (January 2003) and Iron Man (November 2003). WCW career Her first WCW television appearance was in 1994, shortly after she became Page's regular valet, she was known as The Diamond Doll. Before then, she worked as a public relations coordinator, account executive, aerobics instructor and waitress. Page was engaged in a feud with Dave Sullivan, who objected to how Page treated her. Page won that feud but ended up losing Kimberly in a match to Johnny B. Badd at the WCW World War 3 pay-per-view event in 1995. Badd promptly freed her and she became his valet, simply going by the name of Kimberly. After Mero departed for the World Wrestling Federation, she became The Booty Babe for The Booty Man, who had recently shed his \\"Zodiac\\" gimmick and left the Dungeon of Doom. The gimmick lasted until late 1996. Kimberly did not appear on WCW programming again until March 1997's Uncensored, when she rejoined Page (now a face after having refused to join the New World Order) as part of his feud with \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage, who had interrupted a Gene Okerlund interview with Page. Miss Elizabeth then flashed an NWO-defaced centerfold of Kimberly from the 1997 edition of Playboy's Nude Celebrities, after which Kimberly herself appeared from backstage having been spray-painted off-screen by the NWO. The segment was also the first public revelation of Page and Kimberly being an actual married couple. After the Page/Savage feud ended, Kimberly formed The Nitro Girls in July. They danced during breaks on WCW Monday Nitro to entertain the fans. The Nitro Girls were given their own official website, while she and several members appeared in a non-nude pictorial in the September 1998 issue of Penthouse, and filmed a 1999 pay-per- view. In February 1999, Kimberly became involved in an angle in which she was being stalked by Scott Steiner, which culminated in Page attacking Steiner in the arena parking garage on the February 8 episode of WCW Monday Nitro as Steiner followed her to her car; Steiner then stole the car with Kim inside, and attempted to run over Page in the garage. He then threw Kimberly (actually a stunt-woman) from the car, and she was later taken away in an ambulance.WCW Monday Nitro Report - DDT Digest, 2/8/99 In October 1999, Kimberly again accompanied Page to the ring as his valet. On the November 1, 1999 episode of WCW Monday Nitro she departed the Nitro Girls and later took part in a match against David Flair at Mayhem on November 21. In 2000, she turned heel on Page to join Vince Russo and Eric Bischoff's New Blood stable. In the storyline, she decided it was \\"all about me\\" instead of Page, and it was hinted she was romantically involved with Bischoff. She had brief feuds with Miss Elizabeth and Miss Hancock, and was also briefly paired with Mike Awesome, before her departure from WCW in June 2000. Personal life She and Diamond Dallas Page amicably separated in July 2004, then divorced in 2005.

The modelling focused on a Petri net‚Äìbased technique for business process modelling to which the Baan application units were to be linked. DEM also contains a supply-chain diagram tool for the logistic network of the company and of an enterprise function modelling diagram\\".Hendrik Koning (2008). Communication of IT-Architecture . Thesis Dutch Research School for Information and Knowledge Systems. . p.94.  Overview  To align a specific company with dynamic enterprise modeling, the organizational structure is blueprinted top-down from high-level business processes to low-level processes. This blueprint is used as a roadmap of the organization, that is compatible with the structural roadmap of the software package. Having both roadmaps, the software package and the organizational structure are alienable. The blueprint of an organizational structure in dynamic enterprise modeling is called a reference model. A reference model is the total view of visions, functions, organizational structures and processes, which together can be defined as a representative way of doing business in a certain organizational typology. The DEM reference model consists of a set of underlying models that depict the organizational architecture in a top-down direction. The underlying models are: * Enterprise structure diagrams: The company site structure is visualized with the dispersed geographic locations, the headquarters, manufacturing plants, warehouses, and supplier and customer locations. Physical as well as logical multi-site organizations for internal logistic or financial flow optimization can be diagrammed.Sjaak Brinkkemper (2001). Business Modelling for the Development and Implementation of Enterprise Applications (Abstract). Accessed Aug 1, 2009. * Business control model : The business control model represents the primary processes of the organization and their control, grouped in business functions. The DEM reference model exists of one main Business Control Model, resulting in several other Business Control Models per function area of the organization. * Business function model : The business function model is a function model that focuses on the targets of the several functions within the company. * Business process model : The business process model focuses on the execution of the functions and processes that originate from the business control model and the business function model. Processes flows are depicted and processes are detailed out. * Business organization model : The business organization model focuses less on the processes and more on the organizational aspects such as roles and responsibilities. Together these models are capable of depicting the total organizational structure and aspects that are necessary during the implementation of the dynamic enterprise modeling. The models can have differentiations, which are based on the typology of the organization (i.e.: engineer-to-order organizations require different model structures than assemble-to-order organizations. To elaborate on the way that the reference model is used to implement software and to keep track of the scope of implementation methods, the business control model and the business process model will be explained in detail.  Dynamic enterprise modeling topics  = Business control model = The business control model exists of the business functions of the organization and their internal and external links. Basic features in the model are: * Request-feedback-loop: A link from, to, or between business functions is called a request-feedback-loop, which consists of 4 states that complete the process and information flows between both business functions. The states are labeled: requested, committed, completed and accepted. * Workflow case. A workflow case is the description of the execution and the target of the process that occurs between two business functions. The most important critical factors of the workflow case are quantity, quality and time. The 4 states of Request-feedback-loop the together represent the workflow case. * Triggers: Business functions are aggregates of business processes and focus mainly on the triggers (control) between processes, thus not on the information flows. * Business functions : In an optimal situation for the modeling process, a company has only one business function. Business functions are however subdivided when: ** The nature and characteristics of workflow cases fluctuate ** The frequency in underlying processes fluctuate ** Detail-level fluctuates ** More than 1 type of request triggers a function Next to interaction between two business functions, interaction can also exist between objects that are not in the scope of the reference model. These objects can be external business functions and agents. * External business function : this is a group of processes that are part of the organization (meaning that the organization can control the functions), but that is outside of the scope of the reference model. Agents on the other hand are entities similar to business functions with the exception that they are external of the business (i.e.: customers and suppliers). * Processes within or between business functions are executed by triggers, which can be event-driven or time-driven. * Exceptions in a system are handled, according to the set handling level in the business process configuration, when the success path of the model is not met in practice. Subroutines of processes can be modeled in the Business Control Model to take care of possible exceptions that can occur during the execution of a process (i.e.: delay handling in the delivery of goods). In addition to business functions that consist of the main processes of the organization, management functions exist. * Management business functions: These are functions that manage the business process itself and that thus support the execution and triggering of the main business functions. Having this reference, the main processes of the organization can be captured in the Business Control Model. The main functions of the organization are grouped in the business functions, which consist of the processes that are part of the specific business function. Interactions between the business functions are then depicted using the request-feedback loops. = Constructing the business control model = A business control model is constructed according to a set path. * First, the scope of the business is defined. The scope includes scoping what to model and includes the definition of the agents and external business functions that relate to the business. * Next, the scope is depicted to a model of the black box with al the agents and external business functions surrounding the black box. * The next step is to define the process and information flows (request-feedback flows) between the agents and external business functions to and from the black box of the business control model. Defining the request-feedback flows enables the modeler to define what processes are inside the black box. After creating the main business functions within the business control model, the several business functions are detailed out. * In case of a production business it is vital to define the customer order decoupling point, referring to the split in the physical process where processes are based on the customer order instead of forecasts. * Service based businesses on the other hand do not have a physical goods flow and thus do not require a physical process model. It is however imaginable that the same type of process flow can be utilized to construct a business control model for a service based business, as a service can be interpreted as a product as well. In this way, a business control model can be constructed similarly for a service based business as for a physical goods production business, having intangible goods instead of tangible. * Next to the low-level physical production process, the high-level business functions need to be defined as well. In most cases the higher level business functions relate to planning functions and other tactical and strategical business functions, followed by functions as sales and purchase. After high-level detail definitions, the business functions are decomposed to lower-level detail definitions to make the business control model alienable to the lower models within the reference model, for this practice, mainly the Business Process Model. In the Business Process Model the processes are elaborated until the lowest level of detail. Given this level of detail, the Baan software functionality is then projected on the processes, depicted in the Business Process Model. = Business process model = The modeling of processes in DEM, modeling the business process model is done using Petri net building blocks. DEM uses 4 construction elements: * State : A state element represents the state of a job token and is followed by the activity that executes the job token of the state. * Processing activity : A processing activity is the activity that processes the job token of a state, transforming the state of the job token to another state. * Control activity: A control activity navigates the process activity but does not execute it. * Subprocess : A subprocess is a collection of different other processes, aggregated in a single element by means of complexity management. These 4 construction elements enables the modeling of DEM models. The modeling is due to a set collection of modeling constraints, guiding the modeling process in order to have similarly created models by different modelers. Control activities exist in different structures in order to set different possible routes for process flows. The used structures for control activities are: * OR-split / XOR-split : This structure creates 2 new states out of 1 state, signaling the creation of 2 job tokens out of 1 job token. If the new state can be both of the output tokens, the split is OR, if not, the split is an exclusive OR split (XOR). * AND-join construction : 2 job tokens are both needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token (thus 1 new state). * OR-join / XOR-join : 2 job tokens are needed to enable the control activity, creating 1 new job token. OR means one of the two starting job tokens can be used or both, XOR means only one of the tokens can be used to create the output job token. = An example = The example below demonstrates the modeling of the concept of marriage and divorce using Petri net building blocks. * The Petri net built model expresses the transformation from a single man and woman to a married couple through marriage and back to single individuals through divorce. * The model starts with the two states called man and woman. * Through an AND-join construction (both man and woman are needed in order to form a couple) the two states are joined within the control activity called coupling to the new state called couple. * The couple state then is transformed through the processing activity called marriage, resulting in the transformed state of married couple. * The state married couple is then transformed to the state divorced couple using the process activity called divorce, resulting in the state called divorced couple. * The control activity called decoupling finally splits the divorced couple state into the states of man and woman. = Assessments = Using an embedded method brings the power that the method is designed to implement the software product that the method comes with. This suggests a less complicated usage of the method and more support possibilities. The negative aspect of an embedded method obviously is that it can only be used for specific product software. Engineers and consultants, operating with several software products, could have more use of a general method, to have just one way of working.

The school is a member of The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference. The school was established in the 16th century in a city centre site, founded in 1552. In the 1960s it moved to the outskirts onto a multi building site. In addition to the academic curriculum the schools includes drama, music, sport and a combined cadet force. King Edward's School Bath was judged as \\"excellent\\" in every category in the school's 2015 Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) report. The report noted that \\"The school's extra- curricular provision is outstanding\\", \\"Achievements outside the curriculum are both numerous and outstanding\\" and \\"The quality of the pupils' achievements and learning is excellent\\". The school was ranked as one of the top four independent schools in the south west by The Sunday Times Schools Guide, Parent Power Survey based upon 2016 academic results. History The school was founded in 1552 under laws set out in the Charities Act of 1545, which had been passed by Henry VIII to use funds from the dissolution of the monasteries to replace monastic grammar schools such as that run by Bath Abbey. The Mayor of Bath and one of the members of parliament for Bath, Edward Ludwell, petitioned Edward VI for land previously owned by the priory, to establish the school, initially in Frog Lane, and support ten poor people, which also prevented the crown from selling off the land previously held by the priory. In 1580s the school moved to a disused church building by the north gate of the city. The city corporation misappropriated the considerable funds form the land granted under Letters Patent, failing to maintain or improve the school until it was exposed in the Court of Chancery in 1734. Around 1750 a new building was erected for the school in Broad Street. The secondary school relocated from its site at Broad Street in central Bath in the 1960s to a site at North Road in the southeastern edge of the city, previously occupied by St Christopher's Preparatory School. The junior school (7- to 11-year-olds) remained on the Broad Street site until the summer of 1990 (often mis-quoted as 1986, possibly due to errors originally made in an architectural report from the early 2000s and repeated by the local Planning Office) when it transferred to a new building in the North Road school grounds. The old Broad Street site, which was built in 1754 by Thomas Jelly and is a Grade II* Listed building, remains empty. In 1997 an application to turn the building into a public house by Samuel Smith Brewery was refused. A scheme for use as a hotel has also been withdrawn. The building remains on the Heritage at Risk Register but work to repair the roof has reduced the risk to the property. Proposals to use it as a temporary shelter for the homeless were rejected in 2018, by the brewery, claiming that work would be \\"commencing very soon\\". In the 1990s, while Peter Winter was Headmaster the school took the steps towards full co- education. In 2005 there were plans to move the 'pre-preparatory' school, located in Weston, Bath, on to the North Road site. However, for a range of reasons it never materialised. In 2008 the school achieved the best examination results of Bath schools for A level and GCSE examination results. Site The Senior and Junior School is situated on a 19-acre campus, with views across Bath. The school is made up of several buildings. The main block (Q) is the primary building used for English, Maths, Music, Physics and Chemistry. The main block also incorporates the Wroughton Theatre and the Music classrooms. Nethersole House, which was built in the 19th century, now houses the Religious and Philosophical Studies department, Classics, History, Business Studies and Economics and Learning Support, as well as the Headmaster's Study and Reception. The Holbeche Centre is home to the Sixth Form centre, as well as Art, Design & Technology and Photography classrooms, G block (which is temporarily closed for refurbishment) and the newly finished L block are nearby. The sports hall at the bottom of the site is used for assemblies, as well as sports. The senior school opened a new building (B Block) in September 2008 which accommodates many of the major departments including Biology, Psychology and I.C.T. The Wessex Building is located to the north of Nethersole House and was opened in 2015 by the Earl of Wessex and holds the Porter Library, Willet dining hall and a conference suite. The school opened its newest sporting facility, an all-weather pitch, in November 2016 by Rio Olympic gold medalist, Crista Cullen. The Rose is a new drama centre with state of the art technology and facilities. It is located at the bottom of the school below the lower entrance. In 2020 the schools newest facility was opened. The L block is a language block purely intended for language purposes that sits between the G block and the Holbeche Centre, it is connected to these two blocks by doors. The refurbished G block is due to reopen soon. A temporary building called M block is currently used to teach Geography, this may be removed when the G block is reopened. Nethersole House Wessex Building, King Edward's School, Bath Top Floor, Wessex Building The Willett Dining Hall, Wessex Building King Edward's Astro Pitch opened in 2016 King Edward's Junior School Drama and music The school includes drama and music departments. The drama department puts on a school play each year and recent performances have included Fiddler on the Roof and Pride and Prejudice. There is also a lower school play which is aimed for pupils in years 7 to 9 and regularly has casts of up to 80 pupils which recently included The Wind in the Willows and Disney's Beauty and The Beast. The School has also recently introduced LAMDA exams and taken a show to the Edinburgh Fringe. In late 2017 the school performed \\"Pop the Musical\\", a show written by the school based on a book by author Catherine Bruton, who teaches English at the school. The Music department currently has over 20 instrumental and choral groups of varying musical styles. The school has partnerships with Bath Abbey and Bath's resident orchestra, Bath Philharmonia Orchestra, with annual concert performances in Bath‚Äôs historical venues including The Assembly Rooms and the Guildhall. Every year the Music department organises the KES Musical Festival which includes concerts throughout Bath as well as numerous performances and concerts in the school itself. The Senior Orchestra was also the overall winner for orchestral music in the Mid Somerset Festival in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012. KES Pride and Prejudice KES Beauty and The Beast KES Gala Concert 2017 KES Gala Concert 2017-2 Sport The school has a further 17-acre site at nearby Bathampton, which is home to the school's playing fields and sports pavilion. The major games are rugby, hockey, cricket and netball. Minor sports include athletics, cross-country, tennis, football, rounders, badminton, dance, gymnastics and table tennis. Former England rugby coach Andy Robinson used to teach rugby, physical education and mathematics at the school while he was playing (amateur rugby) for Bath Rugby Club. In previous years the school had competitive netball squads over a range of school years. In particular, the under 19 squad came third at the national finals in both 2009 and 2010. Alternative sports such as jiu jitsu and squash are also played. Combined Cadet Force The school also has a Combined Cadet Force (CCF) which was formerly affiliated with the Light Infantry is now affiliated to the King's Royal Hussars (Royal Armoured Corps). Having been founded in 1900, King Edward's CCF is one of the oldest CCF contingents in the country. In recent years the CCF has also included cadets from Beechen Cliff School and from 2015 to 2019 it also welcomed pupils from Hayesfield Girl School. Pupils, both girls and boys, may join the CCF from year 9 onwards and enjoy a range of activities each week developing skills which can be put into practice on a number of excursions, including multi-day CCF-run exercises on Army training grounds, as well as Combined Cadet Force and Army Cadet Force- run camps throughout the year, in each March, September, July and November.https://www.kesbath.com/senior-school-sixth-form/co- curricular/outward-bound In 2019 the CCF formed a Corps of Drums, and since then has been taking cadets on ACF and CCF-run music training camps.https://twitter.com/kesbathccf?lang=en The Cadet Force is one of the cadet forces which are involved in Bath's annual Remembrance Sunday ceremonies, involving attending the main ceremonial parade and a march through the city streets, which has since 2019 included performance by the Corps of Drums. International links King Edward's School and Wagwer School in Kenya are global development partnership schools, part of the Department for International Development (DFID) initiative, which seeks to encourage an understanding and knowledge of the world though exchange visits and joint curricular work. Under the scheme which is sponsored by the British Government teachers from Kenya are able to visit KES and teachers from KES are able to visit Wagwer.http://kesbath.dreamhosters.com/cgi- bin/search.cgi?action=search&keywordSearchFields;=num&keyword;=3049&categoryNum;=185&template;=articleLists/catindex.html The school also runs exchange programmes with schools in Aix-en-Provence (France), Braunschweig (Germany) and Pamplona (Spain). The school also produced two Olympians who represented Great Britain for the 2012 London Olympic Games. Controversy In 2001, the school made national headlines after 26 pupils were taught the wrong Shakespeare play (Hamlet) in preparation for an A-level examination. The mistake was only realised after the pupils had entered the examination hall. The OCR exam board decided to award their marks according to previous papers and coursework. In 2002, a 14-year-old girl had to be taken to hospital with alcohol poisoning during a trip to France. \\"FORMER private school teacher Timothy Snowdon has been jailed for four years for a string of historic sexual assaults against a pupil. The 60-year-old of Trowbridge Road, Bradford on Avon, took advantage of the boy by encouraging him to take part in after school activities at the prestigious King Edward's School in Bath. He abused him for four years in the 1990s and his traumatised victim reported the abuse to police in January 2013.

He lived in exile from Singapore after facing lawsuits from Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister. He was educated at Saint Joseph's Institution in Singapore and at the Middle Temple in London, and was a Visiting Fellow at Harvard Law School. Life Seow was born on 11 October 1928 in Singapore. He joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1956 and rose through the ranks to become the Solicitor-General in 1969, a position he held until 1971. Seow led a Commission of Inquiry in the Secondary IV examination boycott by Chinese students in 1963. For his work, Seow was awarded the Public Administration (Gold) Medal. He eventually left the public service and entered private law practice in 1972. In 1985, Seow defended Tan Mui Choo (whose name was mistakenly reported as \\"Choo Choo\\" in the Malaysian press), Adrian Lim's first wife and accomplice in the Toa Payoh ritual murders, while she was on trial. Tan was eventually executed after an unsuccessful appeal against her conviction and death sentence. In 1973, Seow was suspended from law practice for 12 months by the Chief Justice, Wee Chong Jin, for allegedly breaching an undertaking given on behalf of his junior law partner to the Attorney-General, Tan Boon Teik. Nevertheless, he was later elected as a member of the Council of the Law Society in 1976 and became its President in 1986. Seow's new appointment led to a falling-out with Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's first Prime Minister, after he became embroiled in the politics surrounding the role of the Law Society. He had envisaged a restoration of the role of the Law Society to comment on legislation that the government churned out without any meaningful parliamentary debate, to which Lee took special exception. As a result, Lee caused special legislation to be passed that deprived the Law Society of any power to comment on legislation unless specifically asked to by the government. Seow stood for the 1988 general election as a member of the opposition Workers' Party team that contested in Eunos Group Representation Constituency against the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). However, his team managed to secure 49.11% of valid votes and lost marginally to the PAP. Just before the election, on 6 May 1988, Seow was detained without trial under the Internal Security Act for 72 days. He was accused of having received political campaign finance from the United States to promote democracy in Singapore. According to his account, he was subjected to torture, including sleep deprivation and intensely cold air conditioning. Later, while awaiting trial for alleged tax evasion, he left for the United States for health treatment and disregarded numerous court summons to return to stand trial. Subsequently, he was convicted in absentia. While living in exile, Seow spoke at events organised by Singaporean student societies in universities outside of Singapore. In a 1989 interview in London, Seow told The Sunday Times that he would return to Singapore to face tax evasion charges. On 16 October 2007, Amnesty International issued a public statement mentioning Seow as one of two prominent Singaporean lawyers who were penalised for exercising their right to express their opinions. Amnesty International also called him a \\"prisoner of conscience.\\" On 8 October 2011, Seow and Tang Fong Har publicly addressed a Singapore Democratic Party forum via teleconferencing. The Singapore police investigated the legality of the event on the following day. Seow died on 21 January 2016 at the age of 87. Chee Soon Juan, the secretary-general of the Singapore Democratic Party, announced the news of Seow's death on his Facebook page. Seow was survived by two sons, Ashleigh and Andre, and two daughters, Ingrid Annalisa and Amara. Ingrid and Ashleigh are from his Finnish wife, Rauni Marjatta Kivilaakso, who died in 1988 after a long battle with cancer. Writings In the semi-autobiography, To Catch a Tartar: A Dissident in Lee Kuan Yew's Prison, Seow wrote about his career in the Singapore Legal Service, opposition politics and his personal experience of being detained by the Internal Security Department. He also accuses the Singaporean government of authoritarianism and human rights abuse under Lee Kuan Yew's administration. The book also contains a foreword by Devan Nair, the third President of Singapore, that is equally critical of the Singaporean government. Seow also wrote another book, The Media Enthralled, which describes how he believes the Singaporean government undermined freedom of the media and turned the media into pro-government mouthpieces. He is also the author of Beyond Suspicion? ‚Äì The Singapore Judiciary that explores key cases in which the Singaporean judiciary has bowed to political pressure.

After graduation, she started a career in advertising, singing in her spare time with amateur and semi-professional bands. Career Teal's break came when she was asked to stand in for Stacey Kent at a weekend festival in Llandrindod Wells. This led (after some determined self-promotion, in which she drew upon her advertising skills) to a three-album contract with the jazz label Candid Records. Her popularity soared, with appearances on radio and television bringing her to the attention of a wider public, and in 2004 she released her first album for Sony Jazz in what was the biggest recording deal by any British jazz singer. Don't Talk topped the jazz charts and entered the UK Top 20 UK Albums Chart. While the majority of her recordings are cover versions of standards, her albums feature original songs and contemporary cover versions, notably a cover of \\"California Dreaming\\" by The Mamas & the Papas. This song attracted the attention of BBC Radio presenter Michael Parkinson, garnering significant publicity during her period with Candid Records. Teal has toured throughout the UK and the world, with her pianist, trio, mini big band, or Hollywood Orchestra. She has worked with the Hall√© Orchestra, BBC Concert Orchestra, RT√â Concert Orchestra, and the John Wilson Orchestra as well as other top big bands. In August 2017, she produced and presented her third concert for The Proms. Swing No End featured two big bands and many special guests. It was broadcast on BBC Radio 2, BBC Radio 3, and televised on BBC Four. From 2006-2013 Teal presented the BBC Radio 2 show, Big Band Special. In 2009 she started presenting her own show on BBC Radio 2. She has appeared as a presenter on Friday Night is Music Night. Since 2 August 2009, she has presented Sunday Night at 10, took over from Malcolm Laycock. She writes a weekly blog for The Yorkshire Post. Teal collaborated with Van Morrison on the single \\"Carrying a Torch\\" from his album Duets: Reworking the Catalogue. She was the opening act for Liza Minnelli at Kenwood House and the Royal Festival Hall. She performed at the Glastonbury Festival and the Marlborough Jazz Festival. Personal life Teal lives in Glastonbury with her girlfriend, having lived in Bath for many years. In 2007, she said that, although she had lived in Bath for more than a decade, she still feels like a Northerner, saying she is \\"never not from Yorkshire\\".

Sandberg has been a member of the Norwegian parliament since 1997 (since 2005 from the S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag constituency, and before that from Nord-Tr√∏ndelag), and served as chair of the parliamentary standing committees on Justice, and Transport and Communications. He has additionally held the position of first deputy leader of the Progress Party from 2006 to 2018. In 1997 he was convicted of assault and battery of an asylum seeker. His status as a convicted felon has made him controversial in Norwegian politics. An outspoken politician with a blue- collar working background, Sandberg has stoked controversy on numerous occasions, and has been described, by former party chairman Carl I. Hagen as well as the media, as the \\"proto-typical Progress Party person\\" ().\\"- Per Sandberg er selve ur-Frperen\\", Nordlys, 31.10.2013\\"Sandberg: Frp skal ha makta i 50 √•r\\", NRK, 03.05.2014  Early life and education  Sandberg was born in Levanger, Nord-Tr√∏ndelag to self-employed businessman Rolf Sandberg (1926‚Äì2010) and part-time worker Rannveig Erts√•s (1930‚Äì2006). He has three siblings, sister Mona, and brothers Harald and Stig (Stig committed suicide in 1997). He has described his upbringing as \\"rough\\", partly due to his father, who he describes as being \\"incredibly strict and manipulative\\". According to Sandberg, his father would regularly lock him up in the outhouse or the cellar as punishment. He would also resort to corporal punishment on his siblings regularly. So great was the abuse, that Sandberg claims: \\"Had my father acted like that today, child welfare would have been there. And it would have been an immediate takeover by the child protection services\\". After finishing Upper Secondary school, he held numerous different jobs including as a bartender and waiter at a Ski resort in Ustaoset, and later as a process operator at Norske Skog Skogn from 1982 to 1997, where he became the local trade union representative. In 1981 he settled in Levanger. Sandberg was in the service of UNIFIL in Southern Lebanon in 1986 during the Lebanese civil war, where he worked as a cook.  Political career  = Early political career = Sandberg modestly started his career in the Progress Party by lending his name to the party's local list in Levanger, as a favour to a friend, for the 1987 municipal election, but surprisingly ended up securing a seat in the municipal assembly. He had originally joined the party after meeting resistance from public regulations when trying to build a house earlier in the 1980s. He was a member of the Nord-Tr√∏ndelag county council from 1995 to 1997, until the 1997 parliamentary election in which he secured the party nomination, beating his friend (and future minister) Robert Eriksson. During the election campaign, he attended BBQs and events through the whole constituency in a borrowed Volvo 240 with only party stickers as election material. He ended up, winning the seat, with 140 votes ahead of the Center Party favourite Marit Arnstad. = Member of Parliament = Serving as a member of the Storting since 1997, the first terms from Nord-Tr√∏ndelag, he has since 2005 been represented from the neighbouring county of S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag. Sandberg chaired the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice from 2009 to 2013, and from 2005 to 2009 chaired the Standing Committee on Transport and Communications. He became deputy leader of the Progress Party in 2006. While being central in the negotiations leading to the Progress Party joining the Solberg Cabinet after the 2013 election, Sandberg claimed to have turned down offers for two different cabinet positions.\\"Frps Per Sandberg takket nei til to statsr√•dposter\\", TV 2, 15.10.2013 On 28 October 2013, Sandberg announced that he was stepping down as deputy leader of the party in 2014, citing a \\"...lack of motivation to continue the work\\", but in early 2014 retracted his statement and said he would continue.\\"‚Äì Er nok ikke alle som er glade for at jeg fortsetter\\", V√•rt Land, 03.02.2014 Shortly after making his later retracted announcement to step down as deputy leader, Sandberg published his political autobiography Mot min vilje - oppklaringen av et politisk liv (\\"Against my will - clarification of a political life\\"), in which he severely criticised several members of the Progress Party, as well as the political direction the party had taken following the 2011 Norway attacks.\\"Progress 'no longer speaks for man on street'\\", The Local, 12.11 2013 =Minister of Fisheries= On 16 December 2015 Sandberg was appointed Minister of Fisheries in Solberg's Cabinet. =Minister of Justice, Public Security and Immigration= On 20 March 2018 Sandberg was appointed as acting Minister of Justice, Public Security and Immigration in Solberg's Cabinet after Sylvi Listhaug resigned. He was later succeeded by Tor Mikkel Wara. Political positions =Law and order= Sandberg has been highly critical of newer prisons such as the Halden prison, which he claims to have \\"hotel-standard\\", this according to him being a mockery against most people. He has also been critical of the fact that the prison have better facilities than most public nursing homes and child protection institutions. In addition he has claimed that criminal foreigners and Eastern European gangs \\"laugh\\" at the Norwegian prison conditions. =Immigration= Sandberg proposed in 1999 that the government should be able to expel foreigners from Norway if their children committed serious crimes. In 2002 he proposed a complete stop of immigration from countries outside the Schengen Area. In 2003, Sandberg stated that \\"different races, religions and cultures must not be mixed\\" if there are to be a \\"harmonious society in Norway\\", leading to strong reactions from other politicians. Sandberg in addition claimed to have backing for his statements from the chief of police, which caused the chief of police to strongly distance herself from Sandberg's claims. Sandberg also made the claim that ethnic Norwegians would soon become a minority in Norway.\\"Raser mot Frp-Sandberg\\", Utrop, 05.02.2003 The same year he also proposed to introduce electronic tags on asylum seekers to stop them from escaping while their asylum application is processed. Sandberg has also feared the growth of Muslims in Norway, and claimed that certain areas could eventually be subdued to Sharia law. Sandberg has been accused of stirring up anti-Roma sentiment by stating, in 2013: \\"At the borders, police can [under existing laws] stop organized groups of Roma, Bulgarians or French because we know from experience that these people disrupt the peace and it has also been proven that many of them engage in criminal activities.\\" =Other= In 2007 Sandberg claimed Al Gore of being \\"a big fraud\\", a \\"Christian-fundamentalist\\" and \\"super-capitalist who have earned over 600 million NOK on the climate cause\\". Sandberg in 2014 claimed Norway's Crown Prince Haakon of being a \\"leftist\\", which he says has strengthened his position against the monarchy.\\"Norway's Crown Prince is a 'lefty': Populist leader\\", The Local, 05.05.2014 Controversies He made headlines when in January 1997 he headbutted and punched an asylum seeker from Yugoslavia in the face after the latter had called him \\"pale-white, fat and rich\\" and \\"racist\\". Sandberg was fined 3,000 NOK. In mid-autumn 2006, Sandberg, who then was his party's spokesman for transport, was caught driving at a speed of 100 km/h in a 60 km/h zone i M√•lselv in Troms fylke, for which he got a suspended sentence of 21 days, lost his driver's license for eight months and was fined NOK 9,000. On 12 December 2006 Sandberg addressed the Norwegian parliament having consumed three shots of Akvavit and a beer. The president of the parliament, Thorbj√∏rn Jagland, said that \\"to address parliament under the influence of alcohol is something one just does not do. It has got to do with respect for parliament and for one self\\". The incident caused a media sensation. As a result of this incident, subsequent intense pressure from the media, heavy workload and losing his mother around the same time, Sandberg later wrote that he slipped into a depression, and that he contemplated suicide, only to be saved at the last minute by a phone call from his fianc√©. Sandberg would later claim that Thorbj√∏rn Jagland himself had been consuming red wine along with the rest of the presidency at the time, before they voted in parliament. In November 2011, in the middle of a public Labour-Progress feud and a heated session in parliament, Sandberg accused the Labour Party of exploiting the Ut√∏ya massacre for political gain. This caused Labour party member Helga Pedersen to storm out of the parliament, apparently weeping, while others left the session. Sandberg immediately apologized for the comments, which was accepted. Party leader Siv Jensen also publicly apologized on Sandbergs behalf the next day, before launching another attack at the Labour Party leadership. During the Progress Party's annual congress in 2013, according to newspaper Verdens Gang, Sandberg had to be pulled off another senior party member after Sandberg reportedly had forced the other politician against a wall while shouting angrily at him. The dispute was thought to be part of a years-long internal dispute in the party's Troms chapter.\\"Progress's Per Sandberg in party meet scuffle\\", The Local, 30.10.2013 = Vacation to Iran = In late July 2018 Sandberg went on an unannounced private vacation to Iran while still serving as Minister of Fisheries. Accompanying him on the trip was 28-year old Bahareh Letnes (n√©e Nasserabad), an Iranian-born woman who had immigrated to Norway in her teens and subsequently was adopted by a Norwegian couple. Maritime business newspaper Fiskeribladet first reported on the case and wrote that Letnes was registered as the owner of a company involved in the exporting of seafood. Multiple politicians reacted to the news and questioned Sandberg's relation to Letnes, whether a conflict of interest existed, as well as whether the trip was approved by the prime ministers office. Sandberg explained that the trip as planned last-minute after his initial plan to vacation in Turkey was scrapped, this was due to an ongoing conflict with his estranged wife and that he informed the prime minister only after he had arrived in Iran. Prime Minister Erna Solberg later informed the Storting that Sandberg had violated government regulations by not notifying his ministry about the vacation. Criticism towards Sandberg also increased after it was revealed that he had declined the security briefing that the Norwegian Police Security Service usually provide for Norwegian politicians who travel to countries where there is a high risk of espionage. Sandberg proceeded to break protocol by bringing his work phone along to Iran, and while he first claimed that he had hardly used it, he had in fact sent 153 text messages and made 22 phone calls. Many politicians, including party colleges Mazyar Keshvari and Christian Tybrig- Gjedde, also criticised Sandberg for seemingly \\"glorying\\" the Iranian regime when he appeared on a radio show where he spoke warmly of Iran as a travel destination. The criticism also increased when it was revealed that Sandberg, in February 2018, had accompanied Letnes to an event organized by the Iranian embassy in Norway that celebrated the Iranian revolution of 1979. After weeks of mounting pressure from the media, opposition and fellow politicians Sandberg resigned as cabinet minister and First deputy leader of the Progress Party on 13 August.  Threats and assaults  Sandberg has on several occasions been the victim of physical assaults. In January 2008, Sandberg was physically assaulted by being gripped by the throat and kicked by a man outside the Norwegian parliament. He managed to escape as Socialist Left politician Hallgeir Langeland happened to be nearby and came to his rescue. In July the same man, who had mental problems and had been given residence permit in Norway on humanitarian grounds, also punched down Labour Party politician Knut Storberget. On another occasion, three men approached him, along with his political aide at a restaurant in Oslo, and according to Sandberg \\"was ready to attack\\", the situation was resolved when the men were evicted from the restaurant and Sandberg was promptly whisked out the back-door. On 27 March 2009, he was attacked by three youths while riding the tram in Oslo. The attack ceased when fellow passengers came to his rescue, the attackers fled before the police arrived.  Personal life  While working at Ustaoset in 1976, he met Danish waitress Ulla Kj√¶r Frandsen. They have two children together. He married his first wife, Line Miriam Sandberg (n√©e Haugan) on 7 August 2010. Together they have a son. He used to divide his time three-way between his parliamentary office in Oslo, his parliamentary constituency in S√∏r-Tr√∏ndelag and his home in Lenvik, Troms, on the island of Senja, where he used to live with his family. The commute from his home in Senja, which covers a 3,160 km long flight, was called \\"one of Norway's most extreme daily commutes\\" as he commuted the trip on a daily basis during the weeks of the 2013 government coalition negotiations.\\"Norway politician starts 3,000km commute\\", The Local, 17.09.2013 In May 2018 Sandberg separated from his wife and relocated from their home in Senja to a flat in Mandal. In August 2018 Sandberg confirmed that he was in a relationship with businesswoman Bahareh Letnes and that they were in the process of moving in together.

Detained under the Internal Security Act of Singapore for allegedly conducting pro- communist activities against the government, he was imprisoned for 23 years without charge or trial and subsequently placed under conditions of house arrest for another nine years ‚Äì in which he was first confined to the island of Sentosa and then subject to restrictions on his place of abode, employment, travel, and exercise of political rights. Prior to his detention, he had been a teacher, a physics lecturer, a socialist political activist and a member of the Parliament of Singapore. Subsequent to it, he has been a doctoral student and an interpreter. He travelled to Germany in 1997, and to the Netherlands at least as recently as 2000. The supervision of his PhD thesis in development economics was completed in 2006.  Early life  He read physics at Nanyang University and upon graduating he worked briefly as a secondary school teacher and then as a graduate assistant at his alma mater.  Political activism  As a member of the Barisan Sosialis he was elected member of the Legislative Assembly for Jurong Constituency in 1963, being nominated as the candidate in replacement of a colleague who had been arrested by the government of Singapore. Concurrent with his holding of office, he worked as a university physics professor. He was banned permanently from entering Malaysia in the wake of a political speech he delivered to the Perak division of the Labour Party of Malaysia on 24 April 1966. The old Parliament House in Singapore. A venue for demonstrations forming part of the Barisan Socialis' extraparliamentary struggle in 1966. In July 1966, he was convicted for publishing a \\"seditious article\\" in the Barisan's Chinese-language newspaper. In the same month, he was arrested with 25 others and charged with unlawful assembly for his participation in a demonstration against United States involvement in the Vietnam War that resulted in open confrontation with police.Straits Times; 26 October 1966 (as cited in Mutalib) It has been noted that he was active among peace campaigners calling for an end to the US bombing of Indochina during the Vietnam War in the 1960s. In early October 1966, he and eight other Barisan Sosialis MPs boycotted the Parliament over the decision by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to split from Malaysia. This was part of the Barisan's strategy to protest \\"undemocratic acts\\" of the Government, by carrying their struggle against the PAP outside of Parliament. He declared that the means of the struggle would be \\"street demonstrations, protest meetings, strikes\\".Plebeian (newspaper of the Barisan Socialis), 8 October 1966 On 8 October 1966, he led an illegal protest march of 30 supporters to Parliament House and handed a letter to the Clerk of the House demanding a general election be held under eight named conditions, with the release of all political detainees and the revocation of all \\"undemocratic\\" laws.  Arrest and imprisonment  On 29 October 1966, he and 22 other Barisan Sosialis leaders were arrested pursuant to powers afforded by the Internal Security Act. The official statement released by the Government alleged that Barisan's attempt to arouse a mass struggle outside of parliament was prejudicial to the stability of Singapore. The round of arrests was the second one conducted by the government, including those occurring as part of Operation Coldstore in 1963. Chia was specifically detained for his role in organising and leading the street procession on 8 October. The other detainees were released eventually after they each signed a document promising to renounce violence and sever ties with the Communist Party of Malaya (CPM). However, he refused as he felt that signing such a document would imply that he was affiliated with the CPM and, in his own words: \\"to renounce violence is to imply you advocated violence before. If I had signed that statement I would not have lived in peace.\\" Thus, in time, and without ever being the subject of an indictment or a criminal trial, he became one of the longest-serving political prisoners in the world ‚Äì with some consequent restrictions upon his civil rights remaining in place for a total of more than 32 years subsequent to his initial arrest. The length of his detention has been compared to that of Nelson Mandela, who was imprisoned for a total period longer than 27 years subsequent to his arrest, trial and convictions for treason, sabotage and other political crimes. He was deprived of Singapore citizenship in February 1968 as he could not produce a birth certificate to substantiate his claim that he was born in Singapore in 1933. He was served with a Banishment Order in August 1968. He remained detained in the Queenstown Remand Prison \\"awaiting deportation\\" until 1976, when the Banishment Order was dropped and he was served with a fresh detention order under the ISA in June that year. During his incarceration, he spent substantial time in solitary confinement at the Whitley Road Detention Centre. In late 1978, Amnesty International confirmed that he was detained at the Moon Crescent Detention Centre located within the grounds of Changi Prison. In 1982, he was moved out of prison and into a series of government halfway houses. In 1985, the government of Singapore asserted that the purpose of his detention related to the allegation that he had been a member of the CPM and suggested that he was therefore willing to participate in anti-Singapore political violence and terrorism.  Confinement on Sentosa  Location of Sentosa (in red), relative to SingaporeOn 17 May 1989, he was released from 23 years of imprisonment without charge or trial on the mainland, and instead confined to a one-room guardhouse on Sentosa where he was required to pay the rent on the pretext that he was then a \\"free\\" man. He was also required to purchase and prepare his own food. As he had no money, he was offered a job as the assistant curator of Fort Siloso on the West of the island. He refused the offer on the understanding that it was a government civil service position in which he may, as a result, be \\"muzzled\\" from talking to the media without official permission. Instead, he negotiated an arrangement where he worked as a freelance translator for the Sentosa Development Corporation. About that time he made the following remarks about the circumstances of his continuing detention and the culture of politics in Singapore in general:  Final release  In 1990, there was some relaxation of the restrictions applying to him. Chia has stated his belief that representations by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany in the mid-1980s played some part in the Singaporean government's decision to soften its stance in regard to him. In 1992, he was allowed to return to the mainland and visit the home of his parents, but was still placed under restrictions on travel, activities and associations. In November 1997, restrictions were further relaxed to an extent that allowed him to accept a fellowship from the Hamburg Foundation of the German government for politically persecuted persons. He subsequently spent a year in Hamburg studying economics, politics, and German language. He was also permitted to change his address and to seek employment without prior permission of the director of Singapore's Internal Security Department. In August 1998, he underwent a prostate operation in Singapore. In November 1998, it was reported that the source of his income was the work that he performed as a freelance translator. On 27 November 1998, all remaining restrictions were nullified. He thus formally regained rights to make public statements, address public meetings, and participate in political activity. He immediately called upon the Government to repeal the Internal Security Act and expressed his interest in becoming involved in political activity. On 27 November 1998, Amnesty International issued a public statement that restrictions on \\"Singapore's longest serving prisoner of conscience\\" had been lifted. Amnesty International considered the announcement to be more than thirty years' overdue.  Since release  In late 2000, he was pursuing a master's degree in development studies at the Institute of Social Studies in The Hague and expected to complete those studies and return to Singapore in December of that year. In 2006 the supervision of his PhD thesis through the Institute was completed and he has been conferred his doctorate. Longest- Serving Political Prisoner Chia Thye Poh Received Award A March 2008 version of his staff profile at the ISS describes his position as \\"Project assistant to the project MPA in Governance, Surinam\\". In late 2011 he was awarded the Lim Lian Geok Spirit Award at a public ceremony in Kuala Lumpur. In 2015 he was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.  Writings  *Transplanted or Endogenized?

The word is a portmanteau of the words sutgarak (, \\"spoon\\") and jeotgarak (, \\"chopsticks\\"). The sujeo set includes a pair of oval-shaped or rounded-rectangular metal (often stainless steel) chopsticks, and a long handled shallow spoon of the same material. One may use both at the same time, but this is a recent way to speed eating. It is not considered good etiquette to hold the spoon and the chopstick together in one hand especially while eating with elders. More often food is eaten with chopsticks alone. Sometimes the spoon apart from chopsticks is referred to as sujeo. Chopsticks may be put down on a table, but never put into food standing up, particularly rice, as this is considered to bring bad luck since it resembles food offerings to at a grave to deceased ancestors. The spoon may be laid down on the rice bowl, or soup bowl, if it has not been used. As food is eaten quickly, and portions are small, little time is spent in putting eating utensils down. Cases for sujeo in paper or Korean fabrics were often embroidered with symbols of longevity and given as gifts, particularly at weddings. They are now sold as souvenirs.

Interactive video on broadband Since 2005, interactive video has increased online as the result a number of factors including: * the rise in numbers of users accessing the internet at broadband speeds * the addition of video as a media type to Flash Because users are often reluctant to pay for online content, it is perhaps unsurprising that many of the new online interactive videos (including all the examples given below) are funded by grants, sponsorships, or advertisers. A number of these pieces of these have won major awards. Some principal forms of online interactive video that have emerged are listed below. Video click throughs  A number of interactive video technologies have been developed in the last few years that utilize a new way of encoding videos allowing users to add clickable hotspots to video. There are also technologies that allow video producers to insert questions, calculations, results, lead capture, and personality assessments directly into the video experience. Interactivity that used to require post-production is now available to any video creator for their existing video content.

Instead of 3D computer graphics an interactive image flow is created using premade video clips, often produced by overlaying computer-generated material with 12-inch videodisc images (where the setup is known as \\"level III\\" interactive video, to distinguish it from \\"level I\\" or videodisc-only, and \\"level II\\" requiring specially made videodisc players that support handheld-remote-based interactivity without using an external computer setup). The clips can be animation like in the video game Dragon's Lair or live action video like in the video game Night Trap. Compared to other computer graphics techniques interactive video tends to emphasize the looks and movement of interactive characters instead of interactivity. Interactive video in cinema Interactive video has been used in interactive cinema presentations. Interactive video in YouTube In 2008 YouTube added Video Annotations as an interactive layer of clickable speech-bubble, text-boxes and spotlights. Users may add interactive annotations to their videos and by that a new trend of interactive videos arose, including choose-your-own-adventure video series, online video games using YouTube videos, spot-the-difference- game videos, animal-dubbing and more. In 2009 YouTube added a community aspect to its Video Annotations feature by allowing video owners to invite their friends and community to add annotations to their movies. Around 2010 YouTube released the interactive takeovers, certain channels had the opportunity to integrate an iFrame experience enabling them to include interactive videos. Some of the most successful takeovers were done by brands such as Samsung, Tipp-Ex or Chrome. Interactive video in advertising In 2014, video marketing platform Innovid was awarded a U.S. patent for interactive video technology. In 2017, the interactive video agency Adways created a specific format called InContent that enables to add interactive ads on a live stream for Roland- Garros.  Interactive video in science communications  Documentary filmmakers have leveraged interactivity to communicate ideas about technology in new ways. One such example is the Peabody Award-winning Do Not Track, created by Brett Gaylor. Interactive video art Contemporary interactive video artists like Miroslaw Rogala, Greyworld, Raymond Salvatore Harmon, Lee Wells, Camille Utterback, Scott Snibbe, and Alex Horn have extended the form of interactive video through the dialog of gesture and the participatory involvement of both active and passive viewers. Perpetual art machine is a video art portal and interactive video installation that integrates over 1000 international video artists into a single interactive large scale video experience. Interactive video in cell phone gaming A number of interactive video cell phone games have been developed over the last several years. Interactive video in VJing Technically VJing is also about creating a stream of video interactively. this involves the user/operator to mix video clips, runtime plugins, and FX to the music's mood, bpm, and vibe. Interactive video in research The human-computer interaction (HCI) research community as well as the multimedia research community have published several works on video interaction tools. A survey is provided in Klaus Schoeffmann, Marco A. Hudelist, and Jochen Huber. 2015. Video Interaction Tools: A Survey of Recent Work. ACM Comput. Surv. 48, 1, Article 14 (September 2015), 34 pages.

She was named for Secretary of the Navy Nathan Goff, Jr. Goff, built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation, was launched 2 June 1920; sponsored by Mrs. Nathan Goff, widow of the former Secretary of the Navy; and commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 19 January 1921, Lieutenant, junior grade Rodman D. deKay in command. Service history For the first 2 years of her long service, Goff operated along the Atlantic coast, conducting battle practice and exercises in the yearly Caribbean fleet maneuvers as well as off the East Coast. In September 1922, the destroyer was detached from this duty and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, European Waters. Departing Norfolk, Virginia on 14 October 1922, she cruised primarily in the eastern Mediterranean, putting in at ports in Turkey, Bulgaria, Russia, Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Greece, and Romania. It was a period of great unrest in the Balkans and eastern Mediterranean: Greece and Turkey were at war, various powers were scrambling to consolidate after World War I and gain control over the now-defunct Ottoman empire, and Russia, although still wracked by the Russian Revolution and its aftermath, was seeking further territory and an outlet to the Mediterranean. The presence of American men-of-war amidst this tension assisted various relief agencies working to mitigate the damage from past and present wars as well as protect American lives, interests, and property. Refugees from the Greek and Turkish conflict were frequently evacuated and cared for by the American fleet, and Goff participated in this humanitarian service, particularly at Marsina, where from 18 to 20 July 1923 she supervised evacuation of hundreds of Turkish refugees. Returning to the United States on 11 August, Goff engaged in battle problems and tactical exercises off the East Coast and then on 3 January 1924 joined the Scouting Fleet for winter battle practice with the combined fleets in the Caribbean, Goff returned to Norfolk, Virginia for further exercises and on 5 January 1925 sailed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 24 April for fleet battle exercises. She returned to New York 17 July. This established pattern of coastwise exercises and fleet maneuvers was broken in the fall of 1926, as Goff and engaged in rescue work on the Isle of Pines, Cuba, which had been devastated by the hurricane of 19‚Äì20 October. Flying in stores via Milwaukee's planes and sending their own doctors and medical supplies ashore, the two American ships gave aid to the stricken island and its predominantly American population. After overhaul, Goff returned to the Caribbean in January 1927 with the Special Service Squadron. Civil war was underway in Nicaragua, and ships of the American fleet cruised along the coast to protect American lives and property, and to evacuate American citizens if necessary. From Nicaragua, Goff returned to her regular routine along the Atlantic coast, tactical exercises spiced by winter maneuvers in the Caribbean, a pattern to which she held for several years. Routine was interrupted by occasional special tasks, the most notable of which came in June 1927. Goff was part of the flotilla which steamed out from the East Coast to greet and escort and her special passenger, Charles Lindbergh, as he returned from his transatlantic flight to a hero's welcome in New York. Goff also in June 1930 carried the President-elect of Colombia from Newport, Rhode Island to West Point. She decommissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 13 January 1931. Recommissioning 2 March 1932, Lieutenant Commander Walter M. Wynne commanding, Goff spent the following year cruising along the East Coast training naval reserve crews. Revolution again flared up in the Caribbean, and Goff returned there 5 October 1933 to protect Americans in Cuba, where the conflict was located. Departing Cuba 2 April 1934, Goff resumed maneuvers along the East Coast until 9 November 1935, when she joined the Pacific Fleet at San Diego, California. She remained in the Pacific, operating along the coast and taking part in Hawaiian exercises, until 4 January 1939, when she departed San Diego for New York. Arriving there 20 April, Goff again cruised the East Coast training reserves until 8 September, when she entered New England waters on Neutrality Patrol. After overhaul and refitting for European duty at New York, Goff joined Destroyer Division 55 at Ponta Delgada, Azores, on 29 June 1940 to take her place as flagship of the division. Cruising to Portugal, Goff and her division operated out of Lisbon, engaging in various exercises before returning to Norfolk 21 September. =World War II= Joining DesDiv 67 as flagship, Goff escorted from New London, Connecticut to Balboa, Panama Canal Zone, arriving 31 October to take up Caribbean patrol and guard duty for the Panama Canal. After America's entry into the war in December 1941, Goff remained in the Caribbean to do double duty, as both a convoy escort and patrol vessel. This area was heavily trafficked by German U-boats, and the undermanned Allied convoys (as many as 25 merchantmen with only four escorts) frequently provided easy targets. Night attacks by German submarines cost convoys which Goff was escorting a total of eight merchantmen sunk and several others seriously damaged. The destroyer was worked hard: she was out on patrol and convoy duty 10 days at a time and then in port only long enough to refuel and resupply; when this could be done at sea, it was. Escorts were at a premium as the Allies struggled to maintain their supply lines. Goff finally had her chance to inflict real damage on the German U-boats as she left the Caribbean on 16 June 1943 and put in at New York for a long-needed overhaul. At Norfolk on 27 July, she joined , and to form an offensive antisubmarine patrol which conducted two highly successful patrols across the Atlantic. The close coordination between the carrier's planes and her destroyer screen was effective, during the period Goff was with the carrier, 27 July-9 November 1943, they made two voyages from Norfolk to Casablanca and were credited with sinking no fewer than eight U-boats. These patrols came to a dramatic conclusion when on 1 November Borie rammed and sunk a U-boat, but was herself fatally damaged in the process. For these two patrols Goff was awarded a Presidential Unit Citation (US). After brief overhaul at New York, Goff returned to Atlantic escort duty as on 28 November she and Barry convoyed , loaded with aeronautical supplies and personnel, from Norfolk to Casablanca and then on to Reykjav√≠k, Iceland, returning to New York on 31 December. Goff spent the first 7 months of 1944 with Albemarle, shepherding the tender safely to San Juan, Trinidad and Tobago, Casablanca, Recife, Brazil, and Avonmouth, England, before putting in at Boston, Massachusetts on 13 July 1944 for overhaul. Repairs completed, Goff engaged in antisubmarine practice at Casco Bay, Maine, and then on 28 August sailed for Key West, arriving 3 days later. At the Florida port she was attached to the Fleet Sound School and served in a variety of duties, including antisubmarine work, harbor guard, and target vessel for ships and planes in training. The destroyer departed Key West for Philadelphia on 9 June 1945, arriving there 2 days later. =Fate= Goff decommissioned at Philadelphia on 21 July 1945, after 24 years of service, and was struck from the Navy Register on 13 August 1945. Sold to the Boston Metal Salvage Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 30 November 1945, she was resold to the Northern Metal Company, Philadelphia, on 30 November 1945 and later scrapped. Awards Goff received two battle stars for service in World War II.

They are usually constructed as a self-contained box, which previously included a paper or film recorder (an analogue instrument) but now they often record directly on digital media and then the data is transmitted via the Internet. Accelerographs are useful for when the earthquake ground motion is so strong that it causes the more sensitive seismometers to go off-scale. There is an entire science of strong ground motion, that is dedicated to studying the shaking in the vicinity of earthquakes (roughly within about 100 km of the fault rupture). Accelerographs record the acceleration of the ground with respect to time. This recording is often called an accelerograms, strong- motion record or acceleration time-history. From this record strong-motion intensity measures (IMs, also called parameters) can be computed. The simplest of which is peak ground acceleration (PGA). Other IMs include Arias intensity, peak ground velocity (PGV), for which the accelerogram needs to be integrated once, peak ground displacement (PGD), for which double integration is required. Often a response spectrum is computed to show how the earthquake would affect structures of different natural frequencies or periods. These observations are useful to assess the seismic hazard of an area. As well as their engineering applications, accelerograms are also useful for the study earthquakes from a scientific viewpoint. For example, accelerograms can be used to reconstruct the detailed history of rupture along a fault during an earthquake, which would not be possible with seismograms from standard instruments because they would be too far away to resolve the details. An example of an accelerograph array that was established to improve knowledge of near-source earthquake shaking as well as earthquake rupture propagation is the Parkfield Experiment, which involved a massive set of strong motion instrumentation.USGS: The Parkfield, California, Earthquake Experiment Within the accelerograph, there is an arrangement of three accelerometer sensing heads. In recent low-cost instruments these are usually micro-machined (MEMS) chips that are sensitive to one direction.MEMS (Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems) Technology Sensorland.com Thus constructed, the accelerometer can measure full motion of the device in three dimensions. Unlike the continually recording seismometer, accelerometers nearly always work in a triggered mode. That means a level of acceleration must be set which starts the recording process. For analogue and older digital instruments this makes maintenance much more difficult without a direct Internet connection (or some other means of communication). Many trips have been made to accelerometers after a large earthquake, only to find that the memory was filled with extraneous noise, or the instrument was malfunctioning. Accelerometers are used to monitor the response of structures to earthquakes. Analysis of these records along with the shaking recorded at base of the structure can improve building design, through earthquake engineering.

Military geography is a sub-field of geography that is used by the military, as well as academics and politicians, to understand the geopolitical sphere through the military lens. To accomplish these ends, military geographers consider topics from geopolitics to physical locations‚Äô influences on military operations and the cultural and economic impacts of a military presence. On a tactical level, a military geographer might put together the terrain and the drainage system below the surface, so a unit is not at a disadvantage if the enemy uses the drainage system to ambush it, especially in urban warfare. On a strategic level, an emerging field of strategic and military geography seeks to understand the changing human and biophysical environments that alter the security and military domains. Climate change, for example, is adding and multiplying the complexity of military strategy, planning and training.Holloway, J., Thomas, M.D. and Durrant, C. \\"Strategic Military Geography: Climate Change Adaptation and the Military.\\" Handbook of Climate Change Adaptation. Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2015. 493-514. Emerging responsibilities for the military to be involved in: protection of civilian populations (Responsibility to protect), women and ethnic groups; provision of humanitarian aid and disaster response (HADR); new technology and domains of training and operations, such as in cybergeography, make military geography a dynamic frontier. :‚Äî Baron De Jominip.215, Jomini History and Development of Military Geography Military geography has a long and practical history. For example, Imperial Military Geography in 1938 Cole, D. H. (1933). Imperial military geography: general characteristics of the empire in relation to defence. Sifton Praed & CoY London. shows how a colonial empire approach to military geography could describe the geographical setting of empire, the responsibilities and the resources that could be mobilised for national or imperial needs. Environmental determinism, regional geography, geographic information systems and geography more generally have all evolved and entwined over hundreds of years. Canadian, South African and Australian military geography (Pearson et al. 2018) is inconspicuous compared to the United States and British traditions. There are important links to peace studies and particularly notable was Australian Professor Griffith Taylor who espoused Geopacifics as, an attempt to base the teachings of freedom and humanity upon real geographical deductions; it is humanized Geopolitics Taylor, T. G. (1946). Our evolving civilization: An introduction to Geopacifics, geographical aspects of the path toward world peace. University of Toronto Press. and later observed that, ...so few geographers are prepared to explore public problems which touch on geography as much as on most other disciplines. This is certainly the case with the problem of world peace. Taylor, G. (1963). Geographers and world peace a plea for Geopacifics. Geographical Research, 1, 3‚Äì17.  Urbanistics  Russian colonel N. S. Olesik terms the field of analyzing the complex urban environment in particular ‚Äúmilitary geo-urbanistics.‚Äù In the open country, units only deal with terrain, weather, and the enemy. In urban warfare, the terrain is more complex, filled with many structures and transformations of the land by the inhabitants, which restrict visibility from the air and create obstacles to ground units. Spaces may be narrow, and convoys may be restricted to certain routes between buildings, where they face roadside bombs and ambushes. Units must work with or work around local people, some of whom may cooperate and others of whom may oppose, while others are neutral or caught between the two factions. Guerilla fighters may count on an enemy's unwillingness to bomb or fire on heavily populated areas.  Types of terrain  Several types of terrain and associated climate are prevalent, each affecting combatants differently. = Desert warfare = In an arid climate, as in many desert areas across the globe, sand is a main concern. Sand can hamper an army's attempts to remain hydrated, sapping moisture from skin; sand also jams machinery including the firing mechanisms of firearms. Terrain is usually fairly flat, though in some regions there are vast, rolling sand dunes. The desert environment can also contain mountains; as in Afghanistan and in certain areas around Israel. Due to the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East, the U.S. military has redesigned the uniforms for the different branches of service. All of the uniforms have a digital camouflage pattern that is very effective in the desert environment, and the boots have been changed from the standard polished black boots to light brown colored suede leather boots. These boots are cooler under the intense heat of the desert sun. =Jungle and forest warfare= The conditions of these regions are basically the opposite of those found in desert regions. There are thousands of flora and fauna, and there is always moisture present which presents its own difficulties. The moisture speeds up the rotting processes as well as causing wounds to become infected much easier because of all of the bacteria that live in the water. With proper filtration systems an army should have no problem keeping hydrated. The densely packed trees and underbrush provide concealment from the air as well as from the ground. Ambushes can be easily conducted in this environment just like they can in an urban environment. The jungle can also contain mountains, but these mountains are organized differently from those that exist in the desert. The jungle mountains have far more plant life, and are usually much more difficult to ascend. Helicopters have been proven as a very useful means of transportation over jungle and forested areas; Vietnam was, of course, the testing ground for this. Tanks and other vehicles have difficulty maneuvering through and around the densely packed trees, and most military aircraft fly too fast to accurately observe the ground through the trees. =Winter warfare= This type of warfare is not based on a geographical design, but is based on the drastic differences in this particular climate. During war it is much harder to remain warm than it is to remain cool. Even Forested areas can, and many do, experience winter weather conditions. For this specific type of combat there are soldiers that are specifically trained to fight under the conditions individual to the winter season. These conditions call for a drastically thicker and thus warmer uniform, and the weapons even need to be refitted with the proper devices to ensure that they will operate in the cold. =Mountain warfare= No two mountains are alike, but there is less oxygen at higher altitude. Fighting up a mountain can be very treacherous. There can be avalanches, rockslides, cliffs, and ambushes from higher up the slopes, and there are almost guaranteed to be caves somewhere in the mountain, as in Afghanistan. =Mud= Mud is a universal menace to all armies. While it does not hamper the use of air power, it does slow, and sometimes stops, ground movements all together. The most common season for mud across the globe is spring. Following the thawing of winter's snow and the addition of the rains that the season brings, the ground becomes very soft and almost any military vehicle would get bogged down if not properly equipped. The mud is not always dependent on the spring. Rather, in some parts of the world, they are determined by the monsoons. Ocean fronts (harbors, beaches and sea cliffs) =Pirates= Even today, there is still a problem of piracy on the world's oceans. One of the most commonly thought of areas for this criminal activity is off the coast of Somalia. There has always been the constant threat of small and fast attack craft coming out to greet a vessel as it passes through the waters between Africa and the Middle East. Another region that piracy occurs, and it can be of a much larger scale, is in and around the Indonesian islands and off the coasts of the Asian mainland. Here the pirates have been able to capture much larger prizes, and they pose a much larger threat to the security of economic interests of many countries. Pirates operate from bases that are concealed, but they must be on the waterfront in a country that is either ignorant of their activity, or worse, are paid to overlook it. To deal with the pirates, if an American vessel is attacked, the U.S. Navy has multiple assets to deal with the situation. If the pirates know an attack is imminent, it may be more logical to bomb their base with aircraft from one of the carriers. However, more often than not, the U.S. Navy would opt for secrecy and send in a smaller force, such as the U.S. Navy SEALS, to eliminate the threat. =Harbors= In the concerns of a seaport, especially if it is a goal to either capture or defend it, there are more difficulties than in defending a city that is in land. With a harbor there is also the threat from the sea in addition to the land and the air. A harbor is always a key objective for an army to capture when an invasion is commenced. The sooner the harbor can be captured, the sooner it can be used to bring in massive amounts of reinforcements and material. The trouble is to capture the harbor before the enemy can sabotage it by blocking the entrance with wreckage or by deploying mines throughout the harbor. Defending the harbor is a treacherous task because odds are that the enemy can observe your position from both the air and the sea. The harbor is on the periphery of the defense network of many nations, and even more so if the navy is either deployed or nonexistent. The best ways to defend the harbor are to have military airfields in close vicinity, to have naval units based in the harbor on a permanent basis, and to be ready to make the harbor unusable by the enemy if they should overcome your defenses. =Beaches= Beaches have always been a favourable place for landings. Beaches with naturally shallow inclines are often used for deploying troops and armoured vehicles. Often, however, they can be blocked by mines and other anti-tank defences. This makes them a high risk place to land but, if there is no prior warning, a beach-landing can be a very effective route into enemy territory. =Sea cliffs= The same rules apply to this category as to the preceding one with the exception of the mines. Here there is almost no need for anti-vehicle mines, and so, the defenses could be planned without much concern for an armored attack.  Resources; future flashpoints  The Middle East is, of course, the most obvious place that comes to mind when we think of valuable resources that major nations may compete over when supplies begin to fall around the world. The first Gulf War was an example of the United States‚Äô willingness to go to war to protect its access to the rich oilfields of the Persian Gulf. The strong military presence there influenced some leaders to aid the United States with cheap oil, but over time those forces began to be viewed as a threat to the Muslim world. The attacks of September 11, 2001, have brought new hostilities to the region with the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. Other hotspots around the globe centering on oil are the areas around Venezuela, the Caspian Sea region, and possibly the offshore oil deposits around Vietnam and China. In today's age, especially for people living in developed countries, it is hard to believe that there are other resources that can potentially cause a war. The most precious and most needed resource of all is water, and in some parts of the world, that is a very expensive resource to obtain. The most obvious areas that conflict may arise over disputes for water supplies would be in the desert, but at the moment oil is the most valuable liquid in the Middle East. However, oil will not always be there, and if those people are going to survive, they must have water. Several times, countries that are upriver have threatened to build dams across the rivers in order to cut off the country down river, starving that particular country of its water supply. This has been the case with both the Nile and the River Jordan, and the results in both cases have been the same: the countries that are down river have threatened retaliation if such an event should occur. As our global warming trend continues, our weather patterns will continue to shift, and that means that some places will fall into a severe drought. These people may become desperate when they do not have the resources to obtain water if such a disaster should occur. Water is not the only resource on this planet that is found to be a necessity. The forests are as well. These densely wooded regions of the world are constantly shrinking, and as the oil runs out, people will need to keep warm in the winter. Odds are that they will return to using wood as a primary fuel source for keeping warm. As the forests shrink, neighboring countries will turn on each other for this resource in order to appease their populations. The forests of Latin America and the Pacific Islands are the key hotspots for this resource; this is in part due to the already tense situations in and around those regions because of growing tensions over global oil supplies. In 2002's Die Another Day, the term \\"conflict diamonds\\" is at the heart of the film's plot. In the film, the diamonds are the currency that is used to fund illegal weapons deals, and are used to fund the construction of the Icarus space weapon. The portrayal of the use of the diamonds that come out of Africa holds true in many cases. The term ‚Äúconflict diamonds‚Äù is applied to those diamonds that are not sold through an internationally recognized company. They are ‚Äúconflict diamonds‚Äù because warlords in Africa fight for these diamonds in order to sell them to acquire larger wealth and new weapons for continued fighting. The same is true for the gold fields in southern Africa. There are many warlords that would love to have control of the vast wealth of the mines in order to further fund their lucrative endeavors.  Base construction and closings  The United States Department of Defense maintains a larger number of domestic and foreign military bases than all other countries combined. Closing redundant military bases in the United States often has a negative economic impact on local communities. Analysts at the Pentagon respond to budget limitations by identifying installations that have become obsolete for various reasons. Sometimes the needs for the location are no longer prevalent in defense strategies or the installation's facilities have fallen into disrepair. That is the case with the smaller Reserve and National Guard facilities that dot every state. The personnel on the committees responsible for determining closures also observe the economic impact that their decisions will have on the communities surrounding the installations. If 40,000 people are employed because of the installation, either directly or indirectly, it is more likely that that facility will remain open, but only if there is nowhere for the 40,000 people that would lose their jobs. Those people could end up on welfare, thus becoming just as much of a draw on revenue as they were as employees. Outside of the United States, some countries are strongly vying for inclusion in strategic treaties such as NATO. These countries, many of which are in Eastern Europe, want to join NATO for the mutual advantages of defense and the possibility for foreign bases to be constructed on their soil. These bases, if they were to be built, would bring fiscal resources that those nations would not get without the bases. Sometimes foreign bases are viewed as a good thing. In other regions, a strong political stance may be taken against the construction of foreign military bases, often for sovereignty issues. Decline in popularity; evolution of critical military geography Due to the subfield of military geography's perceived connection to traditional or classical geopolitics, a field which has since the end of the Cold War been largely rejected as a research focus by proponents of the popular schools of both critical geography and Marxist or radical geography, military geography has experienced a decline in popularity in academic circles. This is true particularly in institutions unaffiliated with or unconnected to military or governmental organizations. As a result, although there do exist some popular nonfiction writers of geography without academic credentials in the field who touch on military strategy or tactics, there are presently few practicing military geographers or students of military geography in academia. Similarly, there have been few major texts on military geography published specifically for a civilian academic audience since the early 2000s. More recently, in a 2014 article published in the journal Critical Military Studies, the authors Rech et al. suggest a revival of the field in line with critical geography and critical geopolitics. One earlier example of this school of thought has been Woodward's 2004 text Military Geographies. However, given the postmodern bias of critical geographical studies as well as critical geography academics' tendency to proudly claim for themselves a politically radical or anti- authoritarian slant in their research, this form of a revival of military geography seems unlikely to provide sound recommendations for or detailed analyses of major geopolitical events. This shift in focus would also make military geography less likely to fruitfully inform governmental policy or military strategy, as well as potentially limit the ability of academics to provide their expertise to members of the general public interested in studying or reading about the geographic aspects of military strategy. Strategic and Military Geography revival The revival of geography and military geography as a sub-discipline is a remarkable trend since 2000 with a number of key geopolitical, international relations,Kaplan, R. D. (2012). The revenge of geography: what the map tells us about coming conflicts and the battle against fate. Random House. historical geography Kilcullen, D. (2015). Out of the mountains: The coming age of the urban guerrilla. Oxford University Press. and geographical approaches being developed. The American Association of Geographers and Institute of Australian Geographers have interest groups that continue to develop the sub-discipline of military geography. At the American Association of Geographers meeting in 2018 a committee gathered evidence about militarism and military geography. In 2018 Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography Pearson, S. Holloway J.L. & Thackway, R. (2018) Australian Contributions to Strategic and Military Geography Springer. outlined a new Australian approach and included chapters on themes and specific regions.

TCP/IP stack fingerprinting is the passive collection of configuration attributes from a remote device during standard layer 4 network communications. The combination of parameters may then be used to infer the remote machine's operating system (aka, OS fingerprinting), or incorporated into a device fingerprint.  TCP/IP Fingerprint Specifics  Certain parameters within the TCP protocol definition are left up to the implementation. Different operating systems, and different versions of the same operating system, set different defaults for these values. By collecting and examining these values, one may differentiate among various operating systems, and implementations of TCP/IP. The TCP/IP fields that may vary include the following: * Initial packet size (16 bits) * Initial TTL (8 bits) * Window size (16 bits) *Max segment size (16 bits) * Window scaling value (8 bits) * \\"don't fragment\\" flag (1 bit) * \\"sackOK\\" flag (1 bit) * \\"nop\\" flag (1 bit) These values may be combined to form a 67-bit signature, or fingerprint, for the target machine.Chuvakin A. and Peikari, C: \\"Security Warrior.\\", page 229. O'Reilly Media Inc., 2004. Just inspecting the Initial TTL and window size fields is often enough in order to successfully identify an operating system, which eases the task of performing manual OS fingerprinting.  Protection against and detecting fingerprinting  Protection against the fingerprint doorway to attack is achieved by limiting the type and amount of traffic a defensive system responds to. Examples include blocking address masks and timestamps from outgoing ICMP control- message traffic, and blocking ICMP echo replies. A security tool can alert to potential fingerprinting: it can match another machine as having a fingerprinter configuration by detecting its fingerprint. Disallowing TCP/IP fingerprinting provides protection from vulnerability scanners looking to target machines running a certain operating system. Fingerprinting facilitates attacks. Blocking those ICMP messages is only one of an array of defenses required for full protection against attacks. Targeting the ICMP datagram, an obfuscator running on top of IP in the internet layer acts as a \\"scrubbing tool\\" to confuse the TCP/IP fingerprinting data. These exist for MS Windows, Linux and FreeBSD.

Early life Greer was born in Washington, DC, the daughter of Charles Durell McClellan Greer, Jr., and his wife, Bettie. In 1940, at age 15, Greer suffered from a facial palsy, which paralyzed the left side of her face. She recovered, but the condition may have contributed to her \\"patented look\\" and \\"a calm, quizzical gaze and an enigmatic expression that would later lead RKO to promote her as 'The Woman with the Mona Lisa smile'.\\" She claimed that the facial exercises used to overcome the paralysis taught her the importance of facial expression in conveying human emotion. On December 4, 1945, Greer had her name legally changed to Jane Greer by a court in Los Angeles. She said of her previous name: \\"Mine is a sissy name. It's too bo-peepish, ingenueish, for the type of role I've been playing. It's like Mary Lou or Mary Ann.\\" Career =Music= A beauty-contest winner and professional model from her teens, Greer began her show-business career as a big-band singer. She sang in Washington, DC, with the orchestra of Enric Madriguera. She \\"sang phonetically in Spanish\\" with the group. =Film= With Robert Mitchum in Out of the Past Howard Hughes spotted Greer modeling in the June 8, 1942, issue of Life, and sent her to Hollywood to become an actress. Hughes lent her to RKO to star in many films (another source says Greer's husband, Rudy Vallee, \\"helped her get out of her contract with Hughes and secure another pact with RKO Studios\\") including Dick Tracy (1945), Out of the Past (1947), They Won't Believe Me (1947), and the comedy/suspense film The Big Steal (1949), with Out of the Past co-star Robert Mitchum. Hughes refused to let her work for a time; when she finally began film acting, she appeared in You're in the Navy Now (1951), The Prisoner of Zenda (1952), Run for the Sun (1956), and Man of a Thousand Faces (1957). In 1984, she was cast in Against All Odds, a remake of Out of the Past, as the mother of the character she had played in 1947. In 1952, Greer obtained a release from her contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios. She said, \\"When there is a good role at MGM, the producers want Lana or Ava. There is no chance for another actress to develop into important stardom at the studio\\". =Television= Greer's noteworthy roles in television included guest appearances on episodes of numerous shows over the decades, such as Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Bonanza, Quincy, M.E., Murder, She Wrote, and a 1975 gig with Peter Falk and Robert Vaughn in an episode of Columbo titled Troubled Waters. She even got to make fun of Out of the Past in a parody with Robert Mitchum on TV's Saturday Night Live in 1987. Greer joined the casts of Falcon Crest in 1984 and Twin Peaks in 1990 in recurring roles until her retirement in 1996. Recognition Greer was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 1634 Vine Street for her contributions to the motion picture industry. The star was dedicated on February 8, 1960. Personal life Jane Greer married Rudy Vallee on December 2, 1943, in Hollywood, but they separated after three months and divorced on July 27, 1944. On August 20, 1947, Greer married Edward Lasker (1912‚Äì1997), a Los Angeles lawyer and businessman, with whom she had three sons, Alex, Steven, and Lawrence, a movie producer (WarGames, Sneakers). Greer and Lasker divorced in 1967. Frank London (an actor and dialogue coach) was Greer's domestic partner from 1965 until his death in 2001, six months before Greer died. Greer was a lifelong Democrat and supported Adlai Stevenson during the 1952 presidential election.Jane Greer Although a Democrat, she campaigned for Republican Ronald Reagan during the 1980 and 1984 presidential elections, due in part to the fact that she was strongly dissatisfied with the presidency of Democrat Jimmy Carter. She voted for him in 1976 and found out that he \\"wasn't up to the job\\" as she'd believed. https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0339452/trivia?item=nt1185491 Motion Picture and Television Magazine, November 1952, page 33, Ideal Publishers Greer was Catholic.An Interview With Jane Greer, Skip E.

Their work was heavily influenced by the realist painters of the French Barbizon school. The painters of the Hague school generally made use of relatively somber colors, which is why the Hague School is sometimes called the Gray School. Precursors Shipwreck on a Rocky Coast (1828-39) by Wijnand Nuyen After the great periods of Dutch art in the Golden Age of the 17th century, there were economic and political problems which diminished activity in art. The fine arts in the Netherlands enjoyed a revival around 1830, a time now referred to as the Romantic period in Dutch painting. The style was an imitation of the great 17th-century artists. The most widely accepted paintings of this period were landscapes and paintings which reflected national history. Andreas Schelfhout was a painter of landscapes, especially winter scenes, but also woodlands and the dunes between The Hague and Scheveningen. His best known pupils included Wijnand Nuyen, Johan Barthold Jongkind, and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch. Schelfhout's friend and occasional collaborator Hendrik van de Sande Bakhuyzen principally composed pastoral landscapes like those of Golden Age master Paulus Potter, but trained several prominent Hague School artists, notably his son Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen, Willem Roelofs, Francois Pieter ter Meulen, Hubertus van Hove, and Weissenbruch. Wijnand Nuyen was one of the best of the romantic artists of the time and he had a great influence on Weissenbruch and Johannes Bosboom. Art training at that time was usually in the form of drawing schools, with no painting classes. Many young artists who later became members of the Hague School were frustrated by this and scattered to various places to receive the training they desired. Gerard Bilders left the Hague Academy of Drawing and completed training with the Swiss animal painter, Charles Humbert. Paul Gabri√´l went to Kleve, just over the German border, to study with the landscape painter Barend Cornelis Koekkoek. Jozef Isra√´ls, unsatisfied with the academies at Groningen and Amsterdam, left for Paris to attend classes at the studio of Fran√ßois-√âdouard Picot. Jacob Maris left the Hague Academy for the corresponding institution in Antwerp and from there he went to study with Ernest H√©bert in Paris. His brother Matthijs Maris studied with Nicaise de Keyser in Antwerp. Hendrik Willem Mesdag left Groningen to perfect his skills in Brussels under Willem Roelofs. He also received additional instructions from Lawrence Alma-Tadema, who would later move to England. Oosterbeek and Barbizon Forest View near Barbizon (1900) by Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch In the 1830s artists like Th√©odore Rousseau, Jean- Fran√ßois Millet, Charles-Fran√ßois Daubigny, and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot found their way to Barbizon, a forested area near Fontainebleau. The emphasis of their work here was on painting nature as they saw it - Barbizon was not a school but a community of artists. This gave rise to the well known Barbizon school and their example was followed in the 1850s by a few Dutch painters who gathered in Oosterbeek in order to work in the surrounding countryside. These painters had been influenced by the artists of the Barbizon School and emulated them by registering their impressions with rapid strokes of color. Johannes Warnardus Bilders, father of Gerard Bilders, moved to Oosterbeek in 1852 and attracted many pupils: Anton Mauve, a cousin-in-law of Vincent van Gogh, the Maris brothers (Jacob, Willem and Matthijs) in the summer, as well as the regular visitors Willem Roelofs and Paul Gabri√´l. Some of these artists, such as Jozef Isra√´ls, Jacob Maris and Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch visited Barbizon to paint there.  The Hague and D√ºsseldorf  There was a slight connection between the \\"D√ºsseldorf Art Association\\" when an exhibition on \\"Fishing in Scheveningen\\" occurred. It concerned such artists as , , and Andreas Achenbach. The call of the D√ºsseldorf painters' school attracted artists of the Hague school, such Johannes Bosboom and J. W. Bilders. At the beginning of his career Jozef Isra√´ls went on a study trip to D√ºsseldorf. Also Julius van de Sande Bakhuyzen and Philip Sad√©e came to D√ºsseldorf. The D√ºsseldorf academy was famous as a training center for her scenery and histories painting. The bright colour order which distinguishes those paintings is unmistakable. The Hague School Cows at a Pond by Gerard Bilders Gerard Bilders had been seeking something of the kind in his own work, but on visiting the national Exhibition in Brussels in 1860, he found what he had been looking for: a colored gray tonality, or as he put it \\"the impression of a warm, fragrant gray.\\" The muted tones and warm gray that Bilders found here was certainly discussed with his friends in Oosterbeek and found its way into the work of the young Hague School painters. Village near Schiedam by Jacob Maris The migration of these artists to The Hague began in the late 1860s. Hendrik Willem Mesdag was the first, moving there in 1869. Jacob Maris returned to The Hague in 1870 after the family's experience in Paris in the Franco-Prussian War. That same year Jozef Isra√´ls came to The Hague, as did Anton Mauve. Willem Maris, Johannes Bosboom and Weissenbruch had always lived there. For Mesdag, the move marked the end of his student days in Brussels. For Maris it meant a break with the Paris dealers, who would not let him paint what he wanted. Friendship played an important role in this group of painters and whenever one of them was invited to take part in a major exhibition, he would arrange for his friends to also submit work. The outside world was thus presented with a picture of a united artistic and stylized front. The gray tonality was to become one of the characteristics of the Hague School. Shepherdess With a Flock of Sheep by Anton Mauve The name \\"Hague School\\" was coined in 1875 by a critic, Jacob van Santen Kolff, who used the phrases \\"a new way of seeing and depicting things\\", \\"intent to convey mood, tone takes precedence over color\\", \\"almost exclusive preference for so-called 'bad weather' effects\\", and \\"gray mood.\\" The Hague School artists were less interested in a faithful portrayal of what they saw than in conveying the atmosphere and impression of the moment. They painted in mostly in subdued colors, with a penchant for gray. That is why the Hague School is sometimes also called the Gray School. The painters of the Hague School conducted some of their artistic discussions as member of the Pulchri Studio, which had been founded in 1847 by Bosboom, Willem Roelofs and J. H. Weissenbruch at the home of the Hague painter Lambertus Hardenberg. Growing discontent among the young artists in The Hague about the apparently insufficient opportunities for training and development was the reason for establishing the Pulchri Studio. Many members of the Hague School served on the board of the Pulchri Studio, so that the society became a bastion of the school for many years. The Shipping Canal at Rijswijk by Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch. Over the years, the artists of the Hague School changed. Jacob Maris enriched his palette with vivid brushwork, especially in his Amsterdam town views. Jozef Isra√´ls had completely abandoned his anecdotal manner and somber coloring. J. H. Weissenbruch blurred the details in his later work, painting beach scenes and landscapes in magnificently conceived planes of color with an almost abstract quality. Willem Maris became the painter of light he had always tried to be, producing summer meadows with sunlight sparkling on the water and cattle‚Äîthe quintessence of the Dutch landscape. Matthijis Maris' further development was also remarkable, albeit tragic. Despite the support of family and friends, he led a solitary existence. He worked for years on his paintings of brides and portraits of children, which became increasingly hazy and dreamy until finally becoming completely detached from reality. Sequel The Return of the Flock at Laren by Anton Mauve. By the mid-1880s the united front of the Hague School began to crumble. The character of the city of The Hague changed as it became larger. The small fishing village of Scheveningen changed as new suburbs were built and factories transformed the area. Weissenbruch and Roelofs found The Hague to be growing too fast and retreated to the polders to continue painting. Anton Mauve and Jozef Isra√´ls became active in the Laren School which perpetuated aspects of the Hague School. Albert Neuhuys, Hein Kever and Evert Pieters, were especially active there between 1880 and 1900. Realistic interiors of Laren farm houses, as well as plein air landscapes were the preferred subjects of the paintings. Anton Mauve was particularly active in the latter and his views of the heathlands were quite popular with American art lovers. Donkeyride by Isaac Isra√´ls. While The Hague was becoming too large for some, it was too small for others who became influential in the Amsterdam Impressionism group which developed there. This movement drew on city life for its subject matter, although the contrast with the Hague School was less pronounced than is occasionally suggested. This group included some who are designated below as members of the second generation of the Hague School such as George Hendrik Breitner, Isaac Isra√´ls (son of Jozef Isra√´ls), Willem Bastiaan Tholen and Willem de Zwart (also known as William Black). In addition, Willem Witsen, Floris Verster, Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller and Jan Toorop have some background with the Hague School and are considered to be in the Amsterdam Impressionism movement. Although not usually associated with the Hague School, Johan Jongkind was called a forerunner of impressionism who influenced Eug√®ne Boudin, who later was mentor to Claude Monet. Others who had at least a tangential connections with the artists of the Hague School are Charles Rochussen, Richard Bisschop and Lawrence Alma-Tadema. Around the 1890s in France, impressionism was followed by post-impressionism, which places greater emphasis on the form, structure and content of the painting. This movement, too, was picked up in the Netherlands, resulting in a Dutch post- impressionism and introducing abstract elements and cubism into modern painting. Famous examples are Vincent van Gogh, who received his first art training from Anton Mauve, as well as Piet Mondrian, who initially painted in the manner of the Hague School and then in a variety of styles and techniques documenting his search for a personal style.

An authentic Cullen skink will use finnan haddie, but it may be prepared with any other undyed smoked haddock. This soup is a local speciality, from the town of Cullen in Moray, on the northeast coast of Scotland. It is often served as a starter at formal Scottish dinners but is also widely served as an everyday dish across the northeast of Scotland. Local recipes for Cullen skink have several slight variations, such as the use of milk instead of water or the addition of single cream. Other variations include mashing the potatoes to make the soup thicker. Cullen skink was traditionally served with bread. It has been described as \\"smokier and more assertive than American chowder, heartier than classical French bisque.\\"Felicity Cloake, \\"How to cook perfect cullen skink\\", The Guardian, 5 January 2012. Cullen skink appears in many traditional Scottish cookery books and restaurant and hotel menus throughout Scotland, the rest of the UK and abroad. In 2012 a Guardian columnist described the dish as \\"the milky fish soup which has surely replaced your haggises and porridges as Scotland's signature dish\\".Scott Murray, \\"John O'Groats: a new start for the end of the road\\", The Guardian, 31 August 2012.

Geography The municipality includes the town itself, and 12 civil parishes (Ortsteile) which were incorporated in 1974: *16px Bodenburg *16px Breinum *16px Detfurth *16px Gro√ü D√ºngen *16px Klein D√ºngen *16px Heinde *16px Hockeln *16px Lechstedt *16px Listringen *16px √ñstrum *16px Wehrstedt *16px Wesseln (Bad Salzdetfurth) History In 1194, Salzdetfurth was mentioned in a document for the first time. The place was devastated by fire or flood several times. The worst flood occurred in 1738 when 176 houses were destroyed. The word \\"Bad\\" meaning \\"spa\\" was added to the name in 1921. On 22 March 1945, during a heavy air raid on Hildesheim, Bad Salzderfurth was hit by several bombs and two houses in Goettingstrasse were destroyed.Friedrich Kalbus: Sole, Salz und S√∂der - ein Gang durch die Geschichte von Bad salzdetfurth, p. 55. Bad Salzdetfurth 1961. Bad Salzdetfurth was officially awarded \\"town\\" status in 1949. Each of the villages incorporated in 1974 has its own history and its own traditions.  Mayors  Bj√∂rn Gryschka (independent politician) was elected the new mayor in January 2019, succeeding Henning Hesse (SPD).Results of the mayors election 2019 (in German). Retrieved on 2019-01-06.Hildesheimer Allgemeine Zeitung (in German). Retrieved on 2019-01-06.  Sights  There are various sights in the town itself and in each of the villages. There are many well-preserved half- timbered houses in the old town centre, such as the Miners' Guild Hall dating from 1898, and in the village of Wesseln. The Catholic Church of St. Gallus at Detfurth was built in a classicist style in the period 1772 to 1779. Other interesting village churches and chapels can be seen in Hockeln, Bodenburg, Breinum, √ñstrum, Wehrstedt and Klein D√ºngen. The Church of St. John the Baptist in Wesseln was built in a typical neogothic style in 1853-55. The largest church in Bad Salzdetfurth itself is St. George's Church, a Protestant church with a painted wooden ceiling, which was built around 1700. In the west wall a mark, which is 3 metres above ground level, indicates the height of the flood waters of the River Lamme in 1738. The baroque altar dates from 1717. The organ, dating from 1590, originally stood in St. Lamberti, Hildesheim. There is a municipal museum dedicated to the mining history of Bad Salzdetfurth. Originally the brick building which now houses the museum was a school. The museum was founded in 1987. The most modern church in Bad Salzdetfurth is the Catholic Holy Family Church which was built 1960-61 and consecrated on 3 September 1961. Its organ dates from 1979. Originally, very few Catholics lived in Bad Salzdetfurth. After the Second World War, however, many Catholic refugees from Silesia settled in the town.  Traffic connections  Bad Salzdetfurth can be reached from Hildesheim by train. The railway station is in the middle of the town. There are railway halting places in the villages Bodenburg, Detfurth, Wesseln and Gro√ü D√ºngen as well. On working days, there is at least one train per hour to and from Hildesheim. On Sundays and public holidays there is one train every two hours.

Club career  Regis was born in La Trinit√©, Martinique, and began his pro career in 1988 with Valenciennes FC and played there until 1993. He was transferred to RC Strasbourg in 1993 where he won the 1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup. He then moved to RC Lens in 1996, and Karlsruhe in 1997. He transferred to FC Metz, leaving after the 2002 FIFA World Cup, spent four years there, and spent a season at Troyes AC. From the 2004‚Äì05 season, Regis played at the lower levels of the Belgian Leagues with FC Bleid respectively and retired in the summer of 2008.  International career  Since Regis's wife was an American citizen, an option to play for the United States appeared. Steve Sampson, the U.S. national coach, jumped at the chance of having an experienced left back on the World Cup squad (though Regis's preferred position was always center back ‚Äì where he was most successful in his club career), and promised Regis a starting position on the team if he became a U.S. citizen. Regis was naturalized on May 20, 1998 and received his first cap against Kuwait just three days later. Regis received the starting spot from Sampson, in front of long-time starter Jeff Agoos. Regis played all three matches in the World Cup, and despite being one of the more effective players for the US, the Americans lost all three of their group matches.

The same afternoon, three more bombs were detonated in Rome and Milan, and another was found unexploded. Piazza Fontana On 25 April 1969 a bomb exploded at the Fiat booth at a Milan trade fair, in which five people were injured. There was also a bomb discovered at the city's central station. The explosion at Piazza Fontana was not the first, but part of a well-coordinated series of attacks.Bull, Anna Cento and Cooke, Philip. Ending Terrorism in Italy, Routledge, 2013 =Deceased victims= Giuseppe Pinelli Plaque in memory of the anarchist Giuseppe Pinelli. =Deaths of Pinelli and Calabresi= The Piazza Fontana bombing was initially attributed to Italian anarchists. After over 80 arrests were made, suspect Giuseppe Pinelli, an anarchist railway worker, died after falling from the fourth-floor window of the police station where he was being held. Serious discrepancies existed in the police account, which initially maintained that Pinelli had committed suicide by leaping from the window during a routine interrogation session. Three police officers interrogating Pinelli, including Commissioner Luigi Calabresi, were put under investigation in 1971 for his death, but a later inquiry ending October 25, 1975 concluded that there were no wrongdoings regarding Pinelli's death: public prosecutor Gerardo D'Ambrosio established that his fall had been caused by fainting and losing balance, tired after three days of intense questioning.\\"N√© omicidio n√© suicidio: Pinelli cadde perch√© colto da malore\\", La Stampa, October 29, 1975 Despite being exonerated (he was not in the room when Pinelli fell), the far-left organisation Lotta Continua held Calabresi responsible for the death of Pinelli, and in 1972 he was murdered by left-wing militants in revenge. Adriano Sofri and Giorgio Pietrostefani, former leaders of Lotta Continua, were convicted of plotting Calabresi's assassination, while members Ovidio Bompressi and Leonardo Marino were sentenced for carrying it out.\\"Definitive le condanne per Sofri e gli altri\\", Corriere della Sera, January 23, 1997 .

After his alibi was judged insufficient, he was held for three years in preventive detention before being sentenced for the crime. In 1987 he was acquitted by the supreme Court of Cassation for lack of evidence.\\"STRAGE DI PIAZZA FONTANA AZZERATI 17 ANNI DI INDAGINI\\", la Repubblica, January 28, 1987 . The far-right Neo-fascist organization Ordine Nuovo, founded by Pino Rauti, came under suspicion. On 3 March 1972 Franco Freda, Giovanni Ventura and Rauti were arrested and charged with planning the terrorist attacks of 25 April 1969 at the Trade Fair and Railway Station in Milan, and the August 8 and August 9, 1969 bombings of several trains, followed by the Piazza Fontana bombing. In 1987, after a number of trials, the Court of Cassation ruled that despite evidence linking Freda, Ventura, and others to the Piazza Fontana bombing, it could not be determined for certain who planned it, nor who carried it out. The Court confirmed the convictions of Freda and Ventura in relation to the bombs placed in Padua and Milan, for which they each received a sentence of 16 years.\\"Quel tragico 12 dicembre 1969 Chi mise la bomba nella banca?\\", Stampa Sera, March 20, 1981 . Also in 1987 the Milanese Guido Salvini reopened the investigation based on new evidence. Martino Siciliano, a member of Ordine Nuovo, decided to cooperate when presented with a taped telephone conversation between Delfo Zorzi and some associates which contained the observation that, \\"the Siciliano problem could be solved with a 9 caliber gun\\".Salvini, Guido. Sentenza-ordinanza, 3 February 1998, p. 30 Siciliano said that he had been present at a meeting with Zorzi and Carlo Maria Maggi in April 1969, in the Ezzelino bookstore in Padua owned by Giovanni Ventura, when Freda announced the program of the train bombings. Despite a death threat from Pino Rauti, electrician Tullio Fabris testified that he had supplied Freda with primers and timers. Carlo Digilio, confessed explosives expert and advisor to the Ordine Nuovo in the Veneto was convicted in June 2001, which was subsequently upheld on appeal in March 2004.Bull, Anna Cento. Italian Neofascism, Berghahn Books, 2012 Digilio displayed instances of memory loss after suffering a stroke in 1995. His subsequent confusion regarding dates and events led to the Court declaring him an unreliable witness. In a 2004 trial of neo-fascists the Milan Court of Appeal attributed the Piazza Fontana bombing to Freda and Ventura. However, since they had been acquitted in 1987 they could not be retried. In 1998, Milan judge Guido Salvini indicted U.S. Navy officer David Carrett on charges of political and military espionage for his participation in the Piazza Fontana bombing et al. Salvini also opened up a case against Sergio Minetto, an Italian official of the U.S.-NATO intelligence network, and \\"collaboratore di giustizia\\" (Uncle Otto), who served as the CIA coordinator in Northeastern Italy in the sixties and seventies. The newspaper la Repubblica reported that Carlo Rocchi, CIA's man in Milan, was discovered in 1995 searching for information concerning Operation Gladio.http://www.repubblica.it/online/fatti/fontana/fontana/fontana.html State security service General Gianandelio Maletti, the head of SID (), and a member of the secret \\"masonic\\" society P2 was found responsible for obstructing the investigation and withholding information during the first trial in Catanzaro. In an effort to protect extreme right-wing groups, Maletti destroyed a report concerning the Padua cell of Ordine Nuovo and arranged for potential witnesses to leave the country. Maletti subsequently emigrated to South Africa.Salvini, Guido. Sentenza-ordinanza, 18 March 1995, pp. 312-313 Captain Antonio Labruna, of SID, was also implicated in aided and abetting the departure of witnesses Marco Pozzan and Giannettini Guido. Maletti and Labruna were convicted in January 1987. Several elements brought the investigators to the theory that members of extreme right-wing groups were responsible for the bombings: * The composition of the bombs used in Piazza Fontana was identical to that of the explosives that Ventura hid in a friend's home a few days after the attacks. * The bags where the bombs were hidden had been bought a couple of days before the attacks in a shop in Padua, the city where Freda lived.

The Supreme Court rejected as ¬´false¬ª Digilio's ¬´alleged affiliation with US services¬ª. The Court found that in 1969 the Venetian group of Zorzi and Maggi organized the attacks, but it is not proven their participation in the massacre of 12 December. The Court certifies that Martino Siciliano (another Ordine Nuovo's pentito) attended to the assembly with Zorzi and Maggi in April 1969, in the library Ezzelino of Padua, where Freda announced the program of the train bombings. But since those bombs didn't kill anybody, it's not evidence of the involvement of Zorzi and Maggi in the next subversive strategy of Freda and Ventura, nor in the other acts of terrorism. The tragic events of 12 December 1969 didn't represent a loose cannon, but were the result of a subversive operation enrolled in a program well settled.\\"Freda e Ventura erano colpevoli\\", Corriere della Sera, June 11, 2005 .  Political theories of responsibility for the bombing  The bombing was the work of a right wing group, Ordine Nuovo (\\"New Order\\"), whose aim was to prevent the country falling into the hands of the left-wing by duping the public into believing the bombings were part of a communist insurgency. A 2000 parliamentary report published by the Olive Tree coalition (an alliance of the Communist Party and the Democratic Party of the Left) claimed that \\"U.S. intelligence agents were informed in advance about several right-wing terrorist bombings, including the December 1969 Piazza Fontana bombing in Milan and the Piazza della Loggia bombing in Brescia five years later, but did nothing to alert the Italian authorities or to prevent the attacks from taking place.\\" It also alleged that Pino Rauti (current leader of the MSI Fiamma-Tricolore party), a journalist and founder of the far-right Ordine Nuovo (New Order) subversive organization, received regular funding from a press officer at the U.S. embassy in Rome. \\"So even before the 'stabilising' plans that Atlantic circles had prepared for Italy became operational through the bombings, one of the leading members of the subversive right was literally in the pay of the American embassy in Rome\\", the report says.US 'supported anti-left terror in Italy', The Guardian, June 24, 2000. Paolo Emilio Taviani, the Christian Democrat co-founder of Gladio (NATO's stay-behind anti-Communist organization in Italy), told investigators that the SID military intelligence service was about to send a senior officer from Rome to Milan to prevent the bombing, but decided to send a different officer from Padua in order to put the blame on left-wing anarchists. In an August 2000 interview with Il Secolo XIX newspaper Taviani said that he did not believe the US Central Intelligence Agency was involved in organising the Milan bomb. However he alleged \\"It seems to me certain, however, that agents of the CIA were among those who supplied the materials and who muddied the waters of the investigation.\\"Paolo Emilio Taviani, obituary by Philip Willan, in The Guardian, 21 June 2001.

It was founded by Matthew F. Jacobson in 1990. The label features many grindcore, death metal, and sludge metal artists. History The label was started by Matthew F. Jacobson in August, 1990 in his parents' basement in Aurora, Colorado. The first two releases on the label were 7-inch singles by the bands Velcro Overdose and Face of Decline, closely followed by three death metal bands that would become among the biggest on the label, Deceased, Suffocation, and Incantation. After this, Jacobson became acquainted with William Yurkiewicz Jr., who became his partner in the record label. Yurkiewicz had founded his own record label, which was soon to release albums from the bands General Surgery, Disrupt, Destroy, Misery, and Yurkiewicz's own band Exit-13. The two joined forces to create Relapse Records, aiming to release high-quality, professionally packaged extreme music. In 1991, the label moved their headquarters to Millersville, Pennsylvania. In 1992, the label expanded its range with the creation of its subsidiary label called Release Entertainment, which specializes in experimental, ambient, industrial, and noise titles. With continued growth came a mail-order/wholesale operation that soon became the largest underground distribution center for all things metal in the United States . The mail-order service carried a wide array of extreme music recordings and merchandise, as well as publications from around the world. Throughout the years Relapse has continued to grow and sign on more influential artists from a broader range of genres. In 1996, Relapse unveiled the Resound Music Resource Guide. Resound gave fans direct access to the label's roster through interviews and reviews, as well as being part mail- order catalog. In 1998, Relapse opened a promotions office in Berlin, as well as establishing a German Distribution deal. In 2003, Relapse held a music festival - the Relapse Contamination Festival took place on January 18 and 19 at the Trocadero Theatre in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and featured various Relapse artists. In 2000, the label relocated to Upper Darby, outside of Philadelphia and began plans to include a physical record store . In June 2001, the label opened their first record store off of South Street in Philadelphia. In 2010, Relapse announced that they had done a deal with intellectual property lawyer Eric Greif and Perseverance Holdings Ltd. to take over Chuck Schuldiner's catalog and the Death and Control Denied names internationally. Death's 1995 sixth studio album, Symbolic was excluded from the deal as the rights for said record remain with Roadrunner Records. On August 5, 2011, Relapse announced a pay what you want partnership with Moshpit Tragedy Records, which will see one mp3 album from the Relapse catalog issued weekly through MoshpitTragedy.com. Musical style The label specializes in various types of heavy metal. Recently, with the increasing popularity of extreme metal, Relapse Records has ostensibly become more mainstream, with bands on their roster frequently appearing on the front cover of the magazine Kerrang! and video plays on TV music channels, along with some albums charting on the Billboard 200. The word has also been spread by the sponsorship of such festivals as the Milwaukee Metalfest. It would be hard however to label the company as dealing in one specific style or another, as there are artists of such a wide variety on their roster, ranging from stoner rock and hardcore bands through to grindcore and death metal all the way to retro thrash metal and doom. Although much of the music released on Relapse is from bands in various punk and metal subgenres, the label has also released records from several artists in other genres, including math rock (Don Caballero), shoegazing (Nothing, Cloakroom), post-punk (Publicist UK), space rock (Zombi), stand-up comedy (Brian Posehn) and synthwave (Survive). The officially licensed reissues the label has also released also adds many other genres into their style.

Returning to England, he won the competition in 1782 for the design of Skerton Bridge in Lancaster. After moving to Lancaster he worked on local buildings, received commissions for further bridges, and designed country houses in Scotland. In 1786 Harrison was asked to design new buildings within the grounds of Lancaster and Chester castles, projects that occupied him, together with other works, until 1815. On both sites he created accommodation for prisoners, law courts, and a shire hall, while working on various other public buildings, gentlemen's clubs, churches, houses, and monuments elsewhere. His final major commission was for the design of Grosvenor Bridge in Chester. Some of Harrison's designs, including his buildings at Lancaster Castle, were Gothic in style, but most were Neoclassical, particularly those at Chester Castle. He was regarded at the time, and since, as a major influence in the emergence of the Greek Revival in British architecture. A bridge he designed at the start of his career, and another towards the end of his career, incorporated innovative features; Skerton Bridge was the first substantial bridge in England to have a flat roadway, and the Grosvenor Bridge was the longest single-arched masonry bridge in the world at the time of its construction. Many of Harrison's structures have survived, most of them now designated by English Heritage as listed buildings. Despite his work being nationally admired he spent his entire career in northwest England, visiting London only occasionally; most of his buildings were in Lancashire, Cheshire, and the nearby counties. Early life and training alt=A neoclassical portico flanked by wings Thomas Harrison was born in Richmond, Yorkshire, England, the son of a joiner, also named Thomas. His precise date of birth is not known, but it is likely that he was baptised on 7 August 1744. Little is known about his early life, other than he attended Richmond Grammar School, and it is presumed that he worked with his father. In 1769 he was sponsored by a local landowner, Sir Lawrence Dundas of Aske Hall, to join George Cuitt (who later became a landscape painter) to study in Rome. () Here he studied at the Accademia di San Luca, and during his seven years in Rome, amongst other activities, made drawings of Roman structures, including temples and Trajan's Column. In 1770 Harrison submitted a design to Pope Clement XIV for converting the Vatican Cortile del Belvedere into a museum for antique statues. This was \\"favourably received but not in the end adopted\\". Three years later he entered the Accademia's competition to re-plan the Piazza del Popolo. His design was unsuccessful, but it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1777. Following the failure of this design to be accepted, he petitioned the pope, and was awarded gold and silver medals, and made Accademico di Merito. He was then commissioned by the pope to alter the sacristy of St Peter's, but the pope died before the work started. Harrison returned to England in 1776, probably via France, as he made drawings of buildings in N√Æmes and Paris. He produced designs for a bridge and a road in London, which were not accepted, and he returned to Richmond in 1778. Works =Bridges= alt=A five-arch bridge crossing a river The major works executed by Harrison at the start and end of his career were bridges: Skerton Bridge in Lancaster and Grosvenor Bridge in Chester, both of which incorporated innovative features. In 1782 he won the first prize in a competition to design a bridge to cross the River Lune at Lancaster and to replace a medieval bridge. After some amendments to the design, the foundation stone was laid in June 1783, and Skerton Bridge was completed in September 1787, at a cost of ¬£14,000 (). The bridge was carried on five elliptical arches, and was the first in England to have a flat road surface. Harrison subsequently received further commissions for bridges, including St Mary's Bridge in Derby (1788‚Äì93), Harrington Bridge near Sawley, Derbyshire (1789‚Äì90), and Stramongate Bridge in Kendal, Cumbria (1791‚Äì94), followed by smaller bridges in Lancashire and Cheshire. He was appointed unofficially as the bridge master of Lancashire, and having carried out the duties of country surveyor for Cheshire since 1800, was officially appointed to the post in 1815. Harrison's later bridges in Cheshire included the Mersey Bridge at Warrington (1812‚Äì17), and Cranage Bridge near Holmes Chapel (1815‚Äì16). These were the only bridges he designed to be built in timber rather than in stone, and both have been replaced. They were the first bridges of their type to be built in England, and were his only bridges to be regarded as \\"failures\\". During his career, Harrison was consulted about the design of other bridges in the country. alt=A single-span stone bridge Towards the end of his career, Harrison worked on two bridges in Chester. At the time the only road crossing over the River Dee was the medieval Old Dee Bridge, which was becoming inadequate for the increasing volume of traffic. In 1825 Harrison added three new arches on the upstream side of the bridge, and built a footway that was corbeled-out, also on the upstream side. Meanwhile, negotiations had been underway for a much more substantial bridge. In 1825 an Act of Parliament was passed for the Grosvenor Bridge to be built downstream from the Old Dee Bridge. To provide access to the new bridge, properties, including a church, had to be demolished, and Harrison was involved in designing the new approach to the bridge, which was named Grosvenor Street. He also prepared three different plans for the bridge, one in iron, the others in stone; one of the stone bridges had three arches, the other a single arch spanning . The single- arch bridge would be the longest single-arch stone bridge in the world at the time, and there were doubts about its stability. Harrison's design was supported by the engineers James Trubshaw and John Rennie, and Trubshaw made a limestone model of the bridge to confirm its stability. By this time Harrison was aged over 80, and in 1826 he resigned from the commission. Later that year the design was costed by Thomas Telford, and the town council subsequently accepted the design. Trubshaw was in charge of the construction, with Jesse Hartley as his clerk-of-works. The foundation stone was laid in 1827 by the Earl of Grosvenor (after whose family the bridge was named), and work began the following year. It was formally opened in 1832 by the future Queen Victoria, and traffic began to cross it the following year. The total cost of the bridge was just under ¬£50,000 (). Harrison did not live to see it completed, as he died in 1829. =Lancaster and Chester Castles= Around the time that Harrison was involved in the construction of Skerton Bridge, he received other commissions for work in Lancaster. These included the addition of a clock tower to the Town Hall, the addition of a tower and spire to St John's Church, and the building of Bridge Houses on the east side of Skerton Bridge. In October 1786 Harrison was asked to prepare plans for substantial improvements to Lancaster Castle; in January that year he had also won the competition for major improvements to Chester Castle. He worked on both projects simultaneously for the next 30 years, and beyond that until 1815 in Chester, where he added further new buildings. In both projects he designed buildings for prisoners and prison staff, courtrooms and a Shire Hall. Both towns already had gaols, but there was a national move in the later part of the 18th century to improve them, following the campaigns by penal formers led by John Howard. Amongst these reforms were the separation of men and women, and of criminals and debtors, which were incorporated into Harrison's designs. Lancaster alt=A detailed engraving of a courtroom Harrison did not create an overall plan for his work on the site; a series of plans for different buildings were prepared and building works continued until 1792. The new buildings had to be placed between the existing medieval castle buildings, including the keep, towers and the gatehouse. Harrison decided to design them with Gothic motifs, such as battlements and windows with pointed heads. Construction started in 1788, and the first building to be completed was the Keeper's House, standing to the right of the gatehouse. The next substantial building to be completed was the Female Felon's Prison on the other side of the gatehouse. He designed an arcade on the south side of the keep to give some shelter to the debtors as they walked round their courtyard. He later added two storeys to provide more accommodation for debtors, and completed the Male Felon's Prison to the north of the keep. By 1794 these buildings and other improvements had cost ¬£10,853 (), more than had been expected. By 1795 Harrison had moved from Lancaster to Chester, from where he continued to supervise the work on both sites. At Lancaster this work included rebuilding the Crown Court and the Shire Hall. At that time the Crown Court was held in the medieval hall of the castle, and civil cases were held in the Shire Hall in the keep. The new buildings form a symmetrical group to the west of the keep, and were completed in 1798, although the internal decoration and furnishings were not finished until some years later by Joseph Gandy. The Crown Court is a simple rectangular room, measuring about by high and wide. The Shire Hall has a plan of half a polygon about in diameter. Six Gothic columns support a panelled vault covering the main part of the courtroom. Around the perimeter is an arcade, and the judge's bench has an elaborate canopy in Coade stone. The precise cost of these buildings is unknown, but in 1807 an estimate of more than ¬£40,000 () was given. Chester alt=An elevated view of four neoclassical buildings, the main block, two side blocks and a gateway In contrast with Lancaster, Harrison was able to prepare an organised plan for the gaol, as it was to be built on a new site behind the Elizabethan Shire Hall on land sloping down to the River Dee. Also in contrast to Lancaster, the buildings were to be in Neoclassical style. The Gaoler's House would stand behind the Shire Hall, overlooking the exercise courtyards. Inside the semi-octagonal perimeter wall of the site would stand two-storey blocks to house the prisoners. The site was staked-out in November 1786, but nothing could be done until the necessary Act of Parliament was passed the following July. Work started on the prisoners' accommodation early in 1789 and on the Goaler's House in early 1792, and was completed two years later. Plans were then put in place for a new Shire Hall to replace the Elizabethan building, which was completed in 1802. The Shire Hall was another structure in which Harrison made innovations, in this case the use of Greek architectural motifs. Its fa√ßade is about long and high, in nineteen bays with two storeys. At its centre is a Doric-style portico with twelve columns, projecting forwards by about . Its interior contains a semi-circular courtroom with a diameter of . Its curved wall has a colonnade of ten Ionic columns, and on each side of the judge's bench are two similar columns. The room has a coffered semi-dome. alt=A large gateway in neoclassical style In addition to courts, and now a gaol, Chester Castle also housed a garrison of soldiers. The forecourt of the Shire Hall formed a parade ground for the garrison, and Harrison designed two new buildings for the soldiers. On the west side of the parade ground he built an Armoury, and on the east side a matching block, with more utilitarian buildings behind, to act as the Barracks. Both of the blocks consists of a two-storey building in nine bays, the fronts of which are decorated with Ionic half-columns about high. Harrison's final building in the complex was a monumental gateway or Propylaea at the entrance to the forecourt. This consists of a central block, with two lateral pavilions that originally served as guardhouses. The central block has a portico extending some in front of the pavilions, with a double colonnade of four Doric monolithic columns standing high. Above them is a triglyph frieze, and a low attic. The pavilions are lower than the central block, and decorated at their front with two Doric half-columns between pilasters. At the back the pavilions project beyond the central block and have four Doric columns. The structure, which was built between 1813 and 1815, contains 22 monolithic columns. =Gentlemen's clubs and public buildings= alt=A neoclassical building seen from an angle, with a portico fronted by five columns The first gentlemen's club to be designed by Harrison was the Lyceum in Liverpool. This contained a newsroom, a coffee house, and new premises for the Liverpool Library. It was the first building in Liverpool to incorporate Greek motifs in its design. It includes one of the earliest recessed porticoes in England, and its exterior includes Doric and Ionic columns. Inside the building, the library is a circular room about in diameter; it is top-lit with a dome. The newsroom and coffee room measure about by . The club was built between 1801 and 1802 at a cost of ¬£11,000 (). In 1803 building commenced in Manchester of the Portico Library, which also incorporated a gentlemen's club, and introduced Greek motifs to the city. Like the Liverpool club, it contains a recessed portico with Ionic columns and half-columns. The interior measures about by ; the ground floor was used as the newsroom, the library books were arranged around a gallery, and again it was top-lit with a dome. The building was completed in 1806 and cost about ¬£6.800 (). The third gentlemen's club was the Commercial News Room in Chester, with three Ionic half-columns on its main front. The newsroom measures about by . It opened in 1808, and is smaller than the other club's, costing about ¬£2,700 (). All the gentlemen's clubs are still in existence, but two major buildings Harrison designed in Manchester have not survived. The Theatre Royal was built in 1806‚Äì07 at a cost of about ¬£12,000 (); it could seat 1,020 people, but was destroyed by fire in 1844. Harrison also designed the Manchester Exchange to replace an earlier building with the same purpose. It contained a newsroom, library, dining room, and post office. The exchange was built between 1806 and 1809, and had a semi-circular front decorated with Doric half-columns, but it has since been superseded by a larger building. =Domestic and related structures= alt=Drawing of a large country house with wings While Harrison was working on Lancaster and Chester castles, he was also involved with domestic projects, four of them around Edinburgh in Scotland. The first consisted in making alterations to Gosford House for the 7th Earl of Wemyss. There is circumstantial evidence that he also designed the mausoleum in the grounds of the house, but a definite attribution cannot be made. This commission led, through personal contacts, for further work. The first was to build Kennet House near Clackmannan (now demolished) for Sir Thomas Dundas; it was Harrison's first major house. He then made extensions to Broomhall, a house near Dunfermline, for Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin. Finally in Scotland, Harrison prepared plans for another new house, Colinton House near Edinburgh, for the banker Sir William Forbes. Following this, Harrison is credited with the design of Quernmore Park Hall, near Lancaster, for Charles Gibson, a house built between 1795 and 1798. In 1804 Harrison made a series of plans for the rebuilding of Lowther Hall in Westmorland, but these were not accepted. However he was successful with his plans to enlarge and remodel Gredington, a house in North Wales, for Lord Kenyon, executed between 1807 and 1811 at a cost of ¬£6,675 (). Between 1808 and 1810 Harrison converted three rooms on the west side of the first floor of Tabley House, near Knutsford, Cheshire, into a picture gallery for Sir John Fleming Leicester. This was followed by a series of new houses, Oughtrington Hall, near Lymm, Cheshire, Woodbank, on the edge of Stockport (then in Cheshire), Glan-yr-Afon in Llanferres, North Wales, Dee Hills House in Chester, and Grove House in Allerton near Liverpool. alt=A Neogothic brick house with stone dressings and a curved porch on a street corner In 1820 Harrison designed Watergate House on a corner site in Watergate Street, Chester; it is one of the largest private houses in the town. The entrance to the house is on the corner, leading to a circular lobby and a square entrance hall, which is top-lit by a dome with a lantern. Harrison's last commission for a country house in Cheshire was his design for Tilstone Lodge near the village of Tilstone Fearnall; this has a porte-coch√®re supported by four Doric columns. At about this time Harrison was also designing alterations to the east wing of Chirk Castle in North Wales. In late 1821 he was commissioned to work on Hardwick Grange near Hadnall in Shropshire for Rowland Hill, 1st Viscount Hill, which involved alterations to the front of the house, and the addition of a new dining-room. At the request of the owner, this was in Gothic style; the house has since been demolished. In 1822‚Äì23 Harrison built a house for himself, St Martin's Lodge in Nicholas Street, Chester, which consists of a simple villa. His last work for a private client was again for Roland Hill, a building called the Citadel in Hawkstone Park, Shropshire. It was built as a dower house for his mother, and has the appearance of a small castle, with three circular battlemented towers. =Ecclesiastical buildings= alt=A church with an elaborate steeple on the left Only a small proportion of Harrison's work was on churches. In 1804 he re-faced the south side of St Peter's Church in Chester, and he carried out further alterations to the church in 1813. Between 1805 and 1806 he redesigned the nave of St John the Baptist's Church in Whittington, Shropshire, which had been badly damaged in a storm. He did design one new church, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in St John Street, Chester, which was built in 1811. Although his design was used for the exterior, the internal decoration and fittings were planned by his main contractor, William Cole, and the church has been much altered since. In 1810 came the commission for what is described as \\"without doubt his [Harrison's] best work at a church\\", to rebuild the steeple of the Church of Our Lady and Saint Nicholas, Liverpool. Earlier that year the spire on the medieval tower had collapsed, destroying the tower in the process. The work was completed in 1815 at a cost of over ¬£22,000 (). The steeple has a height of , its buttresses rising above the top of the tower as pinnacles, the open-work spire being supported by flying buttresses. Harrison also designed a domed ceiling for St Paul's Church in Liverpool, but this has since been demolished. Between 1814 and 1816 a chapel was built to Harrison's design at West Hall, High Legh to replace an earlier chapel. This was a simple building that burnt out in 1891, some of its fabric being incorporated into a new church on the site, St John's Church. In 1818 the Right Revd George Henry Law, Bishop of Chester, asked Harrison to carry out work on the south transept of Chester Cathedral, which was showing signs of instability. This work involved building deep buttresses at the south end of the transept, and giving some attention to the gutters. =Other works= alt=A Neoclassical bridge spanning a roadway Harrison designed a variety of other structures, one of the most important of which was the replacement of Northgate in Chester, at the suggestion of Earl Grosvenor, mayor of the city in 1807. The other three gateways, Eastgate, Bridgegate, and Watergate, which carried the footway of the City Walls over the medieval entrances to the city, had been replaced during the 18th century. The earl wanted the structure to be designed in Gothic style, but Harrison advised that it would be more fitting to the adjacent Roman walls for it to be Neoclassical, and after much debate this was accepted. The gateway consists of three arches, a wide central arch for vehicles, and two narrower arches for pedestrians, incorporating pairs of monolithic Doric columns. Harrison then designed Denbighshire Infirmary in North Wales, built between 1810 and 1813, and in about 1820 he made some internal alterations to the Chester Exchange. In 1820 Harrison was consulted by Magdalen College, Oxford, about improvements to New Building, a block of the college built in 1733, and on other alterations. His plans for New Building were adopted, and the additions were made in 1824 at a cost of ¬£2,600 (). alt=A tall column on a small base, surmounted by a statue Harrison was also involved in the building of a series of monuments. His first commission was to design the Jubilee Tower on the summit of Moel Famau, the highest point of the Clwydian Range in North Wales, to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of George III in 1810. This consisted of an obelisk in two stages on a broad base. The obelisk collapsed in 1862, and the base was remodelled in 1970 to make a viewing platform. The design of Lord Hill's Column in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, has been attributed to Harrison, but this is incorrect. The architect was Edward Haycock, but Harrison did make alterations to the design, changing the style of the column, and adding a pedestal with statues of lions; and Harrison did supervise the construction. Harrison designed The Marquess of Anglesey's Column in Llanfairpwll on Anglesey to commemorate the feats of Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey. This was constructed in 1816‚Äì17 at a cost of nearly ¬£2,000 (). His last memorial was a ceremonial gateway, the Admiralty Arch, at Holyhead, also on Anglesey, to commemorate the landing there of George IV in 1821. It consists of an archway with Doric columns, and cost ¬£600 (), and was opened in 1824. Personal life Harrison married Margaret Shackleton at Lancaster Priory in 1785. The couple had three children who survived childhood; a son, John, who died in 1802, and two daughters. Harrison died aged 85 at his home, St Martin's Lodge, Chester, in 1829. He was buried in the churchyard of St Bridget's Church, Chester, but his remains were moved to Blacon Cemetery when the churchyard was cleared in about 1964. His estate amounted to ¬£6,000 (). Present day alt=The frontage of a neoclassical buildings seen between trees An additional arch was added to Skerton Bridge in about 1849 to allow for the passage of the \\"Little\\" North Western Railway (since closed) beneath it. The bridge continues to be used by heavy traffic. A survey in 1995 concluded that the bridge is still strong enough to carry vehicles ten times the weight of the heaviest vehicles of the time it was built. Grosvenor Bridge remains in use, carrying the A483 road over the River Dee, and is still the longest single-span masonry bridge in Britain. Other than the smaller bridges, almost all the structures designed by Harrison have been designated as listed buildings by English Heritage, Cadw, or Historic Scotland. Some of the buildings he completely designed (rather than altered) have been listed at the highest levels, Grade I in England and Wales, and Category A in Scotland. Grade I includes buildings that \\"are of exceptional interest, sometimes considered to be internationally important\\"; only 2.5% of listed buildings are in this Grade. Category A consists of \\"buildings of national or international importance, either architectural or historic, or fine little-altered examples of some particular period, style or building type\\", and includes about 7% of the Scottish listed buildings. These structures are, in Chester, Grosvenor Bridge, and Northgate,, and in Scotland, the Mausoleum at Gosford House, and Colinton House. Lancaster Castle as a whole is listed at Grade I, and at Chester Castle four of Harrison's buildings are listed separately at this Grade: the main block containing the Shire Hall, the Propylaea, and the two blocks flanking the forecourt. A number of Harrison's structures in England and Wales are listed at Grade II*, the middle grade for those that are \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\"; 5.5% of all listed buildings are Grade II*. They include Skerton Bridge, Bridge Houses, Lancaster, St Mary's Bridge, Derby, Quernmore Park Hall, the Lyceum in Liverpool, The Portico Library in Manchester, Woodbank in Stockport, the Marquess of Anglesey's Column, Watergate House in Chester, and the Citadel at Hawkstone Park. Appraisal alt=A full-length sepia portrait of a man standing and dressed in top hat and breeches That Harrison was a fine innovative designer of bridges is evidenced by the continuing successful use by modern heavy traffic on Skerton and Grosvenor Bridges, and on St Mary's Bridge in Derby. As an architect, the editors of the Cheshire volume of the Buildings of England series describe him as \\"one of the most important of Cheshire's architects\\". Harrison's first biographer, Arthur Blomfield, said he was \\"almost, if not quite, the first architectural genius in the kingdom\\". quoted in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Although most of his designs were in Neoclassical style, he also created buildings in Gothic style, for example at Lancaster Castle, and Hardwick Grange. Nevertheless, he is considered to be one of the main influences in the Greek Revival of architecture in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The architectural historian Giles Worsley describes him as \\"the first English architect to grasp the full potential of the Greek Revival\\", quoted in and David Watkin says he is the \\"finest\\" of the architects who revived the forms of Greek architecture. in Of the Shire Hall in Chester Castle, Worsley says it is \\"the first serious monument of the Greek Revival\\". quoted in Writing about Harrison's designs at Chester Castle, Pevsner says \\"What he [Harrison] has achieved here is one of the most powerful monuments of the Greek Revival in the whole of England\\". Harrison spent the whole of his career in the northwest of England and, other than his houses in Scotland and his work in Oxford, his works were confined to Lancashire, Cheshire, Shropshire, Cumbria, Derbyshire, and North Wales. He was never a member of the Royal Academy or any other London-based institution, and only a rare visitor to London once his practice was established. Nevertheless, Charles Cockerell (later to become the president of the Royal Institute of British Architects) said of him in 1828 that he was \\"undoubtedly the noblest genius in architecture we have had\\".Quoted in See also *List of works by Thomas Harrison Notes Some of Harrison's drawings and plans are held in the Cheshire Record Office, including that of Trajan's Column, together with his design for the Piazza del Popolo, and drawings of buildings in France. The model is still in existence, and is on show in Castle Drive. The model has been listed by English Heritage at Grade II. In this context, the term \\"felon\\" was applied to convicted criminals who had not been sentenced to death, and could not be transported. Harrison's wooden model of the plan is still in existence, and is in the care of the Cheshire Museum Service. There is no doubt about the attribution to Harrison of Woodbank, Dee Hills House, and Grove House; that of Oughtrington Hall is likely; but that of Glan- yr-Afon is more uncertain.

The nearest village is Barton Stacey (where the 2011 census was included), halfway between Winchester and Andover; there is a junction for Bransbury on the A303 towards Exeter. Bransbury has twenty-two dwellings: a collection of agricultural workers‚Äô cottages with gardens of generous proportions, Bransbury Manor, which dates from the 18th century, and Bransbury Mill, a Grade II listed building. The Crook and Shears Inn public house was converted into a dwelling in the late 20th century. The hamlet straddles the River Dever. The road from Barton Stacey to Bransbury is prone to pooling water, because of its position on the flood plain.  History  The Anglo- Saxon Chronicles and Charters are the first written records (855 A.D.) that Bransbury is mentioned in. The road to Bransbury The Andyke in Bransbury is an Iron Age ditch and bank survival of a promontory fort with evidence of round houses, and is a Historic England Scheduled Monument. The course of the Roman road which crosses the parish via Bransbury Common can be traced from Winchester to Marlborough and beyond towards Cirencester. There is also evidence of a Roman camp east of Manor Farm, with the remains of ditches and banks. Further evidence of Romano-British inhabitants was found in 1977 with the discovery of a ‚Äòplank‚Äô burial of a young woman between Barton Stacey and Bransbury. The manor of Bransbury has been farmed from at least the time of Domesday and was granted by Henry VIII to the Dean and Chapter of Winchester and their successors for a yearly rent. The four terraced houses known as The Barracks are Grade II listed buildings. Development in recent times has been limited to the conversion of farm buildings.  Small business  Bransbury is home to a business that hand makes organic soap and beauty products. There is a holiday cottage for rent in Bransbury It is popular with visiting fishermen and their families, and the Dever Springs Fishery is a short walk away.  Bransbury common  Bransbury Common Bransbury common is a large stretch of common land between Bransbury and Newton Stacey. It is classified as a SSSI and a nature conservation area. It consists of broadleaved, mixed, and yew woodland, fenland, marshland, swamp, and has the river Dever joining the river Test. It consists of 392 acres of common land and disused water meadows embracing a remarkable range of grass and sedgeland that is probably unparalleled in southern England. It is also a public access area that is subject to the Countryside Right of Way (CRoW) Act 2000. The common is popular with walkers, who admire the broad and bushy riverside pasture with views of Harewood Forest. The path is ill-defined in places, and it is advisable to keep close to the left edge of the common to avoid the marsh. The common is very popular with birdwatchers, and often has cows grazing on it.

It is distinguished from a subclass. Overview An instance of a normal or top- level class can exist on its own. By contrast, an instance of an inner class cannot be instantiated without being bound to a top-level class. Let us take the abstract notion of a \`Car\` with four \`Wheel\`s. Our \`Wheel\`s have a specific feature that relies on being part of our \`Car\`. This notion does not represent the \`Wheel\`s as \`Wheel\`s in a more general form that could be part of any vehicle. Instead, it represents them as specific to a \`Car\`. We can model this notion using inner classes as follows: We have the top-level class \`Car\`. Instances of class \`Car\` are composed of four instances of the class \`Wheel\`. This particular implementation of \`Wheel\` is specific to a car, so the code does not model the general notion of a wheel that would be better represented as a top-level class. Therefore, it is semantically connected to the class \`Car\` and the code of \`Wheel\` is in some way coupled to its outer class, being a composition unit of a car. The wheel for a particular car is unique to that car, but for generalization, the wheel is an aggregation unit to the car. Inner classes provide a mechanism to accurately model this connection. We can refer to our \`Wheel\` class as \`Car.Wheel\`, \`Car\` being the top-level class and \`Wheel\` being the inner class. Inner classes therefore allow for the object orientation of certain parts of the program that would otherwise not be encapsulated into a class. Larger segments of code within a class might be better modeled or refactored as a separate top-level class, rather than an inner class. This would make the code more general in its application and therefore more re-usable but potentially might be premature generalization. This may prove more effective, if code has many inner classes with the shared functionality. Types of nested classes in Java In Java there are four types of nested class: ;Static * Static member class, also called static nested classes(Oracle) Nested Classes, Oracle.Com The Java Tutorials. They are declared \`static\`. Like other things in static scope (i.e. static methods), they do not have an enclosing instance, and cannot access instance variables and methods of the enclosing class. They are almost identical to non-nested classes except for scope details (they can refer to static variables and methods of the enclosing class without qualifying the name; other classes that are not one of its enclosing classes have to qualify its name with its enclosing class's name). Nested interfaces are implicitly static. ;Non-static / inner classes Inner class The following categories are called inner classes. Each instance of these classes has a reference to an enclosing instance (i.e. an instance of the enclosing class), except for local and anonymous classes declared in static context. Hence, they can implicitly refer to instance variables and methods of the enclosing class. The enclosing instance reference can be explicitly obtained via \`EnclosingClassName.this\`. Inner classes may not have static variables or methods, except for compile- time constant variables. When they are created, they must have a reference to an instance of the enclosing class; which means they must either be created within an instance method or constructor of the enclosing class, or (for member and anonymous classes) be created using the syntax \`enclosingInstance.new InnerClass()\`. * Member class They are declared outside a function (hence a \\"member\\") and not declared \\"static\\". * Local class These are classes that are declared in the body of a function. They can only be referred to in the rest of the function. They can use local variables and parameters of the function, but only one that are declared \\"final\\". (This is because the local class instance must maintain a separate copy of the variable, as it may out-live the function; so as not to have the confusion of two modifiable variables with the same name in the same scope, the variable is forced to be non-modifiable.) Can be very helpful for creation a class with generic type fields, where the type variables are defined in the method. * Anonymous class These are local classes that are automatically declared and instantiated in the middle of an expression. They can only directly extend one class or implement one interface. They can specify arguments to the constructor of the superclass, but cannot otherwise have a constructor (however, this is not a limitation, since it can have an instance initializer block to perform any initialization). Programming languages * Inner classes became a feature of the Java programming language starting with version 1.1. * Nested classes are also a feature of the D programming language, Visual Basic .NET, Ruby, C++ and C#. * In Python, it is possible to nest a class within another class, method or function. * C++ has nested classes that are like Java's static member classes, except that they are not declared with \\"static\\". * BETA language introduced this notion of nested classes. GUI code Local inner classes are often used in Java to define callbacks for GUI code. Components can then share an object that implements an event handling interface or extends an abstract adapter class, containing the code to be executed when a given event is triggered. Anonymous inner classes are also used where the event handling code is only used by one component and therefore does not need a named reference. This avoids a large monolithic ' method with multiple if-else branches to identify the source of the event. This type of code is often considered messy and the inner class variations are considered to be better in all regards.

It was published in Japan by Squaresoft in December 2000, in North America by Square Electronic Arts in March 2001, and in Europe by Sony Computer Entertainment Europe in June 2001. The game was produced by Shinji Hashimoto, co-directed by Takashi Tokita and Seiichi Ishii, and features character designs by Tetsuya Nomura, and music by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. The game tells the story of three bouncers in the fictional city of Edge on a rescue mission to save their young friend from the Mikado Group, a solar technology megacorporation owned by the megalomaniacal Dauragon C. Mikado. The game is structured like a \\"playable action movie,\\" with the plot unfolding differently depending on which character the player chooses for specific gameplay sequences. The Bouncer was Square's first game on the PlayStation 2, and although it received considerable press coverage before its release, and was greatly anticipated as one of the marquee titles in the first batch of PS2 games, it was met with poor sales and mixed reviews. Gameplay AI. The players' health is on the top left; the enemy's on the top right. Controls in The Bouncer are similar to those in the Tobal series. Certain buttons denote high, middle, and low attacks, whilst others are used for jumping attacks, blocking, and special moves. Players have a health meter during gameplay, which, if depleted, means the player dies. Players also have a limited amount of guard points available to them, although this is not represented by an onscreen meter. As the player blocks, the amount of guard points diminish. When they are gone completely, the player can no longer block. The game's combat uses ragdoll physics, which allows characters to be launched several feet into the air, making it possible to juggle enemies by striking them repeatedly. Enemies can also be thrown or otherwise knocked into one another, causing all of them to take damage at once. =Story Mode= The Bouncer is structured as a series of short gameplay segments interspersed with cinematic cutscenes that tell the game's story. With the Active Character Selection (ACS) system, when a cutscene concludes, the player is given the choice to control one of the three protagonists and proceed onto the next gameplay segment. The player then controls this character for the duration of the level, whilst the other two characters are controlled by the AI. At the conclusion of each gameplay segment, the player is able to spend Bouncer Points (BP), the game's equivalent of experience points, using the Point Exchange System. BPs can be used to boost the character's statistics (health, power and guard) and unlock new fighting moves. Spending BPs allows the character to level up, with their rank graded on a letter scale from G to A, and finally, an S-Rank. Typical gameplay in The Bouncer consists of the player fighting groups of enemies using hand-to-hand combat techniques. Occasionally, one of the AI-controlled bouncers will do a taunt, prompting a button-press to activate a team attack (\\"Trinity Rush\\") which damages all enemies on screen. However, the Trinity Rush is ineffective against some bosses. In some instances, the player is also tasked with activities other than fighting, such as running through a series of hallways to avoid being caught in a flood, finding a keycard, or fooling enemies into thinking the player is one of them. In general, a gameplay segment ends when the player has either defeated all of the enemies in the area, has defeated a boss enemy, or has achieved a set goal. =Survival Mode= In addition to the main Story Mode, there is also a single-player survival mode. Spanning ten stages and fifty enemies, every time the player survives a round, the gameplay gets progressively difficult. At the start of each stage, the player's health bar does not return to full, but remains where it was at the end of the previous stage. =Multiplayer= The Bouncer supports the PlayStation 2 multitap accessory, and the game's multiplayer Versus Mode supports up to four players simultaneously in the \\"Battle Royal\\" mode. Battle Royal can also be played by a single player against three AI-controlled opponents, or by two players against two AI- controlled opponents. Story =Characters= * Voiced by (English): Paul Stephen Voiced by (Japanese): Takahiro Sakurai A bouncer at the bar Fate, Sion is the game's main protagonist.

A kind man, he adopted Dauragon when he found him wandering the city streets in a storm. =Plot= As each bouncer has their own unique story, how the game develops depends on which characters are selected for each level. Only by playing through the game as all three characters can the complete story be revealed. The game begins with a news report on Mikado's new solar powered generator satellite, which uses a large mirror to generate electricity from solar rays. It then converts the electricity to microwave radiation, which it beams back to a ground station on Earth, which subsequently converts it back to electricity and distributes it around the planet. Meanwhile, Leann receives a message that Mikado have located Dominique. She expresses surprise that \\"they beat us to it,\\" and rushes out. At Fate, Dominique celebrates Sion's one year anniversary as a bouncer by giving him a pendant. However, Mikado Special Forces led by Mugetsu storm the bar and abduct her. Volt says they will have taken her to the Mikado Building, and Kou calls Leann, learning there is a train heading for the building in thirty minutes. Leann promises she will back him up in her ship, the Orage. Kou, Sion and Volt catch the train, which is carrying rocket fuel for the launch of the satellite. On board, they meet Echidna, who is shocked to see Volt. They fight and defeat her, and she jumps from the train into a river. Meanwhile, the Orage attacks the train, causing the brakes to malfunction. The trio detach the car containing the rocket fuel and jump from the train, which crashes into the station underneath the Mikado Building. They work their way up the building and find Dominique in a dome structure. Nearby, Kaldea is playing the piano. After a moment, she gets up and morphs into a panther. Meanwhile, Dauragon orders Wong to transport Dominique to the shuttle Galeos. Wong protests, telling Dauragon he is using the Mikado Group for evil, something of which his father would not approve. Dauragon attacks Wong as the trio enter, and the dying Wong tells them Dauragon must be stopped. Dauragon then reveals that Dominique is his sister. He and the panther attack the trio, defeating them, and the floor falls out underneath them. The game then cuts to the past as a young Dauragon arrives at a hospital, telling them his sister is dying. However, they turn him away. As he walks through the rain, a limousine pulls up alongside him, and Master Mikado and Wong get out, taking Dauragon and Dominique with them. Later, Mikado adopts Dauragon as his heir. After Mikado dies, Dauragon takes over the company, with Wong praising him for the man he has become, saying he would have made his father proud. Meanwhile, Sion wakes up in a storage room. Fighting his way through the building, he encounters the black panther, who leads him to a computer terminal, where he finds a file on Kaldea. Vaguely remembering her as childhood friend who was supposedly killed in an industrial accident at Mikado, Sion realizes Dauragon has been experimenting on humans. However, she is now older than him, with the file stating \\"the one drawback with our present technology is the treatment ages the subject cells approximately 10 biological years.\\" Sion also finds a picture of Dominique under a locked file. Meanwhile, Volt wakes up strapped to a table. He breaks free and also fights his way through the building. Elsewhere, Kou wakes up in a locker room and steals a guard's uniform, sneaking through the corridors to the upper floors. Sion soon finds Dominique, but is ambushed by Mugetsu. Volt and Kou arrive and Mugetsu is defeated. The trio escape with Dominique but are soon confronted by a group of PD-4s. However, a signal is sent from an orbiting satellite, and Dominique is revealed to be a robot. She easily destroys the enemies and then collapses. Mugetsu arrives and once more takes Dominique, heading to the Galeos. Volt reveals he knew Dominique was a robot, explaining she was created in the image of Dauragon's dead sister. He also reveals that he was once the personal guard of Master Mikado. As they head to the Galeos, they encounter Echidna. They fight and defeat her, but Volt spares her life as she admits killing Master Mikado and framing Volt for the murder. The Galeos takes off, but as it leaves, it is attacked by a group of fighters led by Leann, who tells the trio to use an airship to catch up to it. They again confront Mugetsu, this time they defeat Mugetsu by knocking him over of the aircraft carrier, the flames from the Galeos engines scorch Mugetsu's body and he is thrown back by a searing wave and falls into the ocean. Meanwhile, on board the Galeos, Dominique is hooked up to a computer, with Dauragon using her circuitry to have the satellite fire massive lasers down onto the earth, beginning with the hospital that turned him away as a boy. The trio make it inside the Galeos, where they again encounter the panther. They defeat it, and it transforms into Kaldea. Depending on character selection: * Sion remembers Kaldea as his childhood friend. She tells him the Mikado Group staged her death to experiment on her, but as she speaks, Dauragon kills her. * Sion does not remember who she is and she dies from the injuries sustained in the fight. * Sion remembers who she is and she survives. In the command center of the Galeos, Dauragon explains that he plans to provide unlimited energy to those who will follow him and destroy those who will not. The trio attack and kill him, releasing Dominique from the computer. If Kaldea survived the previous fight, she tells them the Galeos is designed to split into two after leaving Earth. She leads them to the back half of the ship, and sacrifices herself to save Sion and Dominique. The front half of the ship rams and destroys the satellite, with the back half returning safely to Earth. Several weeks later, all has returned to normal. Sion says he will tell Dominique she is a robot when the time is right. Depending on character selection: * Dominique finds that Sion is wearing the pendant she purchased for him at the start of the game and hugs him. * Dominique tells Volt he looks kinder than he used to. Echidna then arrives, wondering if Fate is hiring any more bouncers. * Leann rings Kou, telling him that although Dauragon has been defeated, Dominique must still be kept under surveillance. She then tells him to go to the central plaza. There, he meets Leann and they spar. She warns him to keep his mind on the job. If Sion has been selected as the playable character in the final fight against Dauragon, the game ends with a scene showing his initial meeting with Dominique. Development The game was announced at the Spring Tokyo Game Show in March 1999, where it was revealed as Square's first PlayStation 2 title. On July 12, 1999, IGN reported that Square was working on three PlayStation 2 games; an unknown game, a Final Fantasy game and a fighting game, which was thought to be Ehrgeiz 2. Footage of the game was subsequently shown at the SIGGRAPH Convention in August, at which time the game was still thought to be Ehrgeiz 2. The footage showed the three main characters, which at that time were two men and one woman, fighting a group of ninja in a caf√©. However, on August 23, MagicBox.com reported the game was not a sequel, but an original story. The title of the game was revealed on September 10, when Sony announced the PlayStation 2 launch titles. A non-playable demo was shown at the Fall Tokyo Game Show in September. IGN reported \\"Square's \\"Seamless Action Battle System\\" means that players will roam from adventure sequence to fighting sequence without intermittent FMVs or cutscenes that look out of place; the adventure aspects blend seamlessly into massive street brawls involving as many ten characters.\\" GameSpot were also very enthusiastic about the early footage from the game, writing \\"The Bouncer is arguably one of the strongest visual demonstrations of the PlayStation 2 hardware thus far. Designed to appear as though you're controlling characters in a movie, The Bouncers camera movements and special effects truly appear as though they're straight out of a Hollywood creation.\\" At the Spring Tokyo Game Show in March 2000, Square showed only a ten-second clip of the game, and revealed no new screenshots or information. They also had no release date, leading some journalists to speculate there may be problems behind the scenes. At E3 in May, Square showed some new footage from the game, although they still did not provide a playable demo. IGN was underwhelmed with the new material, feeling there appeared to be too many cutscenes in relation to actual gameplay. On July 13, GameSpot revealed the game's character designs were being handled by Tetsuya Nomura, and the game would receive a simultaneous North American/Japanese release in late 2000. However, on September 1, IGN reported DreamFactory were having difficulty working with the PlayStation 2's hardware, and the game had been pushed back to January 2001. On September 19, IGN revealed that the game would feature Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound for the FMV cutscenes, and Square were attempting to use 5.1 sound for gameplay sections as well. GameSpot revealed more details about the game on September 20, including the three available modes of play: Story, Versus and Survival. They reported that Square expected the story mode to take players roughly seven to eight hours to complete thoroughly. On September 21, IGN published a roundtable interview with members of the development team; character designer Tetsuya Nomura, composers Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi, and co-director Takashi Tokita. The developers outlined the gameplay mechanics, the branching story, the versus and survival modes, the music, the character design, and the challenges of working on the PlayStation 2 for the first time. Tokita claimed the most difficult aspect of the game's creation was working with the PlayStation 2's hardware. The team also said the gameplay was partially derived from DreamFactory's Ehrgeiz and Tobal games, while graphically, the atmosphere was developed with the use of filters and lighting. On November 13, Square announced a Japanese release date of December 23. On December 18, they confirmed a North American release date of January 30, 2001, although this was quickly pushed back to March. =Audio= The Bouncer was the first PlayStation 2 game to feature Dolby 5.1 sound, which was used specifically for the FMV sequences. In addition, it features voice acting with subtitles in both English and Japanese. Because the game was being considered for a North American release early in production, the English voices were recorded first. The Japanese voices were recorded and incorporated later to \\"provide more of a DVD quality to the game.\\" Soundtrack The Bouncer was scored by Noriko Matsueda and Takahito Eguchi. The game contains several vocal themes, including the original Japanese ending theme song \\"Forevermore\\" (\\"Owaranaimono\\"), performed by Reiko Noda, and the English-language theme song \\"Love Is the Gift\\", performed by Shanice Wilson. Takashi Tokita has commented that the lyrics of \\"Love Is the Gift\\", heard during the closing credits, signify the game's overall theme. Two separate soundtracks were released; one in Japan and one in North America. The Japanese version, The Bouncer Original Soundtrack, is a 2-disc, 29-track album, published on March 23, 2001 by DigiCube. The North American version, The Bouncer Original Video Game Soundtrack, is a single disc, 21-track album, published on March 26, 2001 by Tokyopop Soundtrax. Reception The Bouncer received \\"mixed or average reviews,\\" and holds an aggregate score of 66 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty reviews. With the consideration of its high-profile development team, as well as the fact that it was a front-runner PlayStation 2 release, The Bouncer was highly anticipated. However, the game was perceived as a disappointment by many, and was largely seen as mediocre. Numerous aspects from the E3 trailer, such as destructible scenery, were removed in the final game, possibly in order to get the game out in time to be among the first batch of PlayStation 2 titles. Much of the criticism, however, fell on the gameplay. IGN found the controls average and the camera angles to become a major issue in the later portions of the game, where the player is confined to tight spaces. The game was also seen as having an excessive amount of cutscenes and load screens. GameCritics' Brad Galloway, for example, argued actual gameplay constitutes less than one third of the game's length. IGN's Douglass C. Perry reviewed an import version of the game prior to its release in North America, and was disappointed with the lack of depth, but impressed by other aspects. He praised the graphics, character design and CGI cutscenes. He was also impressed with the \\"glowing\\" effect used throughout the game; \\"DreamFactory employs a Playboy-like filter that smoothes out every single bit on the screen. The effect is consistent throughout the game, and rids the PS2 of aliasing or flickering, but also provides a unique gloss that's never been used before with such success.\\" He concluded that, \\"despite the disappointments, I am absolutely having a great time with The Bouncer.\\" In his official review of the game upon its North American release, Perry scored it 7 out of 10, writing \\"The game is a letdown, but not a catastrophic one. [...] It's a good game, not a great one, and it's worth a look.\\" He referred to Story Mode as a \\"mixed bag of good ideas executed ineffectively,\\" although he praised multiplayer mode. He concluded \\"The Bouncer is not the next messiah, it's not the next wave of fighting, and frankly, it's not the paradigm for anything really new, except perhaps incredible-looking graphics. These things said, The Bouncer is a decent game. It's not horrible, it's not brilliant. It's pretty average.\\" In his look at the import version, GameSpot's Miguel Lopez called the game \\"little more than a glorified and highly cinematic version of Final Fight using dated Tobal animations.\\" He called the graphics \\"quite competent,\\" but was highly critical of the game's length, estimating a player could play thought the entire game in forty-five minutes or less, if they skipped cutscenes. In his full review, Jeff Gerstmann scored the game 6.7 out of 10. Of the graphics, he said \\"Everything, from the characters to the backgrounds, looks absolutely incredible.\\" However, he concluded \\"The Bouncer makes a great showpiece for the PlayStation 2. It looks and sounds incredible. However, the ease and extremely short length of the game, matched with other problems like horrific camera angles and lack of a multiplayer story mode, make The Bouncer fair, at best.\\" Game Revolution's Brian Gee awarded the game a C+. He wrote, \\"It's easy to tell what the developers focused on, because The Bouncer is obviously one of the best-looking games on a console to date. Near flawless animations and picture perfect visuals make it a great choice to show off the sleek Sony super machine to your friends. Once the game begins, though, The Bouncer sheds it's [sic] pretty boy image and gets down and dirty.\\" He was critical of the controls and the absence of a lock-on feature. Like other critics, he also had problems with the camera and the ratio of cutscenes to gameplay. He concluded \\"Though many will undoubtedly be disappointed by The Bouncers inability to live up to the hype, others will find a fancy beat 'em up to pass a few hours. Its flashy graphics are at least worth taking a look at, but its many problems just might keep it from a place in the collection.\\" GamePro were more impressed, scoring the game 4.5 out 5, and writing \\"The Bouncer slickly combines copious amounts of hard-hitting moves with a stellar story line all in a visually stunning world.\\" Blake Fischer reviewed the PlayStation 2 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it two stars out of five, and stated that \\"The Bouncer manages to look good, but don't let that fool you into thinking that it's very fun.\\" =Sales= The Bouncer was not a commercial success. In its debut week in Japan, it sold 158,727 units, debuting as the fifth highest selling game across all systems.

Career  Derek Bourgeois was born in Kingston upon Thames in 1941. After receiving his university education at Magdalene College, Cambridge (honours degree and doctorate), Bourgeois spent two years at the Royal College of Music, studying composition with Herbert Howells and conducting with Sir Adrian Boult. From 1971 to 1984, Bourgeois was a lecturer in music at Bristol University, and director of the National Youth Orchestra from 1984 to 1993. In 1980 he began conducting the Sun Life Band (now the Stanshawe Band of Bristol), which was his introduction to brass bands. In 1994 Bourgeois was appointed Director of Music at St Paul's Girls School, London, a position previously held by a number of noted composers, including Gustav Holst and Herbert Howells. After retiring from this post in 2002 he and his wife settled in Mallorca. Following her death in 2006, he remarried in 2008 and moved to New York City, but returned to the United Kingdom in 2009. He also conducted for various orchestras. His symphonies included Jabbervocky-Extravaganza (1963) and the symphonic fantasy The Astronauts (1969). For his Symphony of Winds, the First International Conference for Conductors, Publishers and Composers awarded him with their main commission in 1981. He also chaired Composer's Guild of Great Britain and served as the artistic director of Bristol Philharmonic Orchestra. He founded the National Youth Chamber Orchestra of Great Britain in 1988. He was also a member of the Music Advisory Panel of the Arts Council. Bourgeois was a prolific composer for brass bands and wind bands. His works in that area included two Concerti for Brass Band, the Concerto Grosso, Blitz, Diversions, Serenade, The Devil and the Deep Blue Sea, and Apocalypse. Reviewing Bourgeois's Sonata for Trombone, David Vinning of Trombone.org wrote: \\"Bourgeois is a skilled composer who knows how to write for the trombone and this piece is a major new work sure to become popular.\\" Bourgeois's first band work was a concerto, adapted from a flute concerto. He has also played the tuba. Bourgeois's first symphony, which he composed at the age of 18, was positively reviewed in The Guardian by Stanley Sadie, the future editor of Grove's Dictionary. By 2009, Bourgeois had written 44 symphonies, well beyond the number composed by Havergal Brian, and a larger number than were produced by most 19th and 20th century composers. In an interview with Alan Rusbridger of The Guardian, he said that the symphonies came \\"tumbling out.\\" By the time of his death in 2017, he had 116 symphonies to his name. Bourgeois also composed music for the television movie The Crucible, the short documentaries Thirty Million Letters (1963) and The Driving Force (1966), the TV series The Barchester Chronicles, Mansfield Park (1983), and the \\"Buddyboy\\" episode of the TV series Beasts. Personal life His first wife, the violinist Jean Bourgeois, died of motor neuron disease on 27 November 2006. She had played in the BBC National Orchestra of Wales and was also a piano teacher. Since returning to the UK from the USA in 2009, Bourgeois had lived in Wool, Dorset, with his second wife, Norma Bourgeois. He died on 6 September 2017 in Poole, Dorset, and is survived by his wife Norma.

music and cultural festival held each summer in Edmundston, New Brunswick since 1985. The Foire is sometimes considered the biggest French festival held in Canada outside the province of Quebec. It is usually held in August, at several locations in Edmundston. History The first festival was held in 1979 and up to 1985 was a 10-day event. Today the festival is running strong with five days of activities for all ages. It is held the week before the New Brunswick Civic Holiday, which is the first Monday of August.  Etymology  The name \\"Foire Brayonne\\" stems from the word \\"foire\\" which is French for fair. \\"Brayonne\\" is the feminine form of the French word \\"Brayon\\" which is the name given to residents of Edmundston and the surrounding Madawaska County area. There have been many disputes as to why this term is used. The word is defined as someone who mixes (such as pancakes or laundry). However, some historians dispute the term when it comes to the people of Edmundston. They refer to their ancestors' harvesting of reeds from the Saint John River valley. These were known as \\"braye\\" (which they used to weave baskets and make brooms). Therefore the term \\"brayon\\" means harvester of braye. Some believe the name may refer to the Pays de Bray region in Normandy (northwestern France). Having left this region for Quebec, the descendants made their way over generations to the Saint John River valley. The name perhaps provides a link to their native homeland. Local dishes Many local dishes are served during the festival such as the ploye, which is a pancake type mix of water and buckwheat flour. There is chicken stew which is chicken mixed with dumplings and potatoes. They enjoy cretons: a pork-based pate. Although not a local dish, there's teriyaki on a stick where a thin piece of meat is dipped into a mix of teriyaki and barbecue sauce, grilled over an open fire. It was introduced in the late 90s and has become a foire favorite. Major attractions The foire relies on sponsorships and grants to offer a low entrance fee. A five-day pass to all shows was available for $35 (in 2014). Compared to similar festivals, the foire is arguably one of the best deals of its kind. People wishing to know more about the area's rich history can visit \\"La promenade de la Republique\\", which is an exposition on how life in the area was during the Victorian era. A large park for kids offers live shows, inflatable games, and the opportunity to paint kid's faces and have their picture taken with Typique, a child- friendly porcupine which the region has a rich history of. Other attractions include an outdoor mass celebrating the French culture's loyalty to the Catholic faith, a large parade, car shows, sporting competitions, and an arts and crafts flea market. One of the foire's major attractions has been live concerts. Here is a partial list of artists who have appeared at the foire: *Ren√© Simard and Nathalie Simard (1983) *V√©ronique B√©liveau (1985) *The Box (1986‚Äì1987) *Too Many Cooks (1987) *Glass Tiger (1989) *Celine Dion (1991) *Julie Masse (1992) *Les BB (1992) *Alannah Myles (1993) *Roch Voisine (1994) *France D'Amour (1994 and 2013) *Beau Dommage (1995) *James Ledgerwood (1995) *Kevin Parent (1995) *√âric Lapointe (1994 and 1995) *Moist (1997) *Great Big Sea (1998) *Plume Latraverse (1999) *Claude Dubois (2000) *Natasha St-Pier (1991 and 2003) *Yelo Molo (2003 and 2004) *Les Classels (2003) *Les Respectables (2003) *Marie-Chantal Toupin (2004 and 2010) *Les Trois Accords (2005) *Les Cowboys Fringants (2006) *Hugo Lapointe (2006) *Jonas (2006) *Mentake (2006 and 2009) *Marie Mai (2006) *Soldat Louis (2007) *Martin Fontaine (2007‚Äì2009) *Mobile (2007) *1755 (2008) *Michel Pagliaro (2009) *Gildor Roy (2009) *Guy A.

The idea for this party was brought forward by committee member Jo-Anne Volp√©, who in 1987, asked city officials about having a large party in the city's parking lot. Despite their reservations, city officials agreed. Today, more than 20 years later, the Party du Parking is one of the most enduring and successful events of the Foire Brayonne. Hundreds of people from all walks of life come to this event simply to experience it, as it has a large word-of-mouth and cult following. Every year thousands of people gather on the Friday evening of the Foire in the parking lot in downtown Edmundston. Food, beverages, and live entertainment is offered. Although sometimes imitated by other festivals in the United States and Canada, it is the largest one of its kind in New Brunswick. It has sometimes been compared to Mardi Gras due to its large gathering and party atmosphere. What makes the Party du Parking so special is that, despite having thousands of people gathered into one small spot, the party is in a very controlled environment. Very few, if any, arrests are made and almost everyone attending the Party du Parking are well behaved, despite the amount of alcohol people tend to consume on that night. Dispute The Foire Bayonne is sometimes criticized by the Acadian people as not promoting the culture as a vital part of French New Brunswick, as most of them feel that the term Brayons is but a legend. Despite this the foire has always included Acadian acts and encourages local Acadian talent. In 2008 the foire's closing festivities added an Acadian touch with 1755 and Le Grand D√©rangement. Fayo and George Belliveau are some of the Acadian acts who performed. The Edmundston area, despite having a large population of Acadian ancestry, has always been a separate culture from the rest of French New Brunswick. It has become the second largest majority French speaking city outside of Quebec. Most of the francophones there are from Quebec ancestry, compared to the rest of French New Brunswick which are direct descendants of the first French people to colonise North America in 1604 in what is now Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. Quebec was not founded until four years late. Because of the high Quebec ancestry in the Edmundston area and its close proximity to the Quebec border, area residents are in some cases considered by Acadians as non- resident Quebecers. Some \\"Brayons\\" do not want to be compared to Acadians or Quebecers and ardently call themselves independent \\"Brayons\\" from \\"P'tit Sault\\" (the original name for Edmundston), which designates the smaller rapids of the river.

The chicken genome has 39 pairs of chromosomes, whereas the human genome contains 23 pairs A genetic marker is a gene or DNA sequence with a known location on a chromosome that can be used to identify individuals or species. It can be described as a variation (which may arise due to mutation or alteration in the genomic loci) that can be observed. A genetic marker may be a short DNA sequence, such as a sequence surrounding a single base-pair change (single nucleotide polymorphism, SNP), or a long one, like minisatellites. Background For many years, gene mapping was limited to identifying organisms by traditional phenotype markers. This included genes that encoded easily observable characteristics such as blood types or seed shapes. The insufficient number of these types of characteristics in several organisms limited the mapping efforts that could be done. This prompted the development of gene markers which could identify genetic characteristics that are not readily observable in organisms (such as protein variation). Types SFP discovery principle for gene probing Some commonly used types of genetic markers are: * RFLP (or Restriction fragment length polymorphism) * SSLP (or Simple sequence length polymorphism) * AFLP (or Amplified fragment length polymorphism) * RAPD (or Random amplification of polymorphic DNA) * VNTR (or Variable number tandem repeat) * SSR Microsatellite polymorphism, (or Simple sequence repeat) * SNP (or Single nucleotide polymorphism) * STR (or Short tandem repeat) * SFP (or Single feature polymorphism) * DArT (or Diversity Arrays Technology) * RAD markers (or Restriction site associated DNA markers) Molecular genetic markers can be divided into two classes a) biochemical markers which detect variation at the gene product level such as changes in proteins and amino acids and b) molecular markers which detect variation at the DNA level such as nucleotide changes: deletion, duplication, inversion and/or insertion. Markers can exhibit two modes of inheritance, i.e. dominant/recessive or co-dominant. If the genetic pattern of homo-zygotes can be distinguished from that of hetero- zygotes, then a marker is said to be co-dominant. Generally co-dominant markers are more informative than the dominant markers. Uses Genetic markers can be used to study the relationship between an inherited disease and its genetic cause (for example, a particular mutation of a gene that results in a defective protein). It is known that pieces of DNA that lie near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. This property enables the use of a marker, which can then be used to determine the precise inheritance pattern of the gene that has not yet been exactly localized. Genetic markers are employed in genealogical DNA testing for genetic genealogy to determine genetic distance between individuals or populations. Uniparental markers (on mitochondrial or Y chromosomal DNA) are studied for assessing maternal or paternal lineages. Autosomal markers are used for all ancestry. Genetic markers have to be easily identifiable, associated with a specific locus, and highly polymorphic, because homozygotes do not provide any information. Detection of the marker can be direct by RNA sequencing, or indirect using allozymes. Some of the methods used to study the genome or phylogenetics are RFLP, AFLP, RAPD, SSR. They can be used to create genetic maps of whatever organism is being studied. There was a debate over what the transmissible agent of CTVT (canine transmissible venereal tumor) was. Many researchers hypothesized that virus like particles were responsible for transforming the cell, while others thought that the cell itself was able to infect other canines as an allograft. With the aid of genetic markers, researchers were able to provide conclusive evidence that the cancerous tumor cell evolved into a transmissible parasite. Furthermore, molecular genetic markers were used to resolve the issue of natural transmission, the breed of origin (phylogenetics), and the age of the canine tumor.Murgia C, Pritchard JK, Kim SY, Fassati A, Weiss RA. Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer. Cell. 2006 Aug 11;126(3):477-87. Genetic markers have also been used to measure the genomic response to selection in livestock. Natural and artificial selection leads to a change in the genetic makeup of the cell. The presence of different alleles due to a distorted segregation at the genetic markers is indicative of the difference between selected and non-selected livestock.

They are sometimes referred to as quadrupedian, or four-footed signs because they represent animals that walk on all four legs. These animals are inarticulate, which means they have voices, but their power of speech is not developed. Individuals who are strongly influenced by the bestial signs quite often have speech impediments and a larger than usual amount of body hair. The bestial signs in the zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Leo and Capricorn. Because they are not able to express themselves in the manner that they would like, they often become frustrated at their inability to fully communicate. Individuals strongly affected by these signs quite often have difficulty reading and writing as well as speaking, and therefore need extra tuition to help them to overcome those hurdles.
