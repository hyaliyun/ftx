Living in the wilderness of what is now Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska, she was known for her hunting, trapping, and cooking skills.  Biography  Quigley was born Frances Sedlacek in Wahoo, Nebraska, in 1870. She left home and headed west at age 16, finding employment at work camps along the growing Union Pacific Railroad. She continued her travels north during the Klondike Gold Rush, arriving in Dawson City, Yukon, in 1897. Quigley earned a living by cooking for prospectors; she would load up a sled with a portable stove and provisions, hike out to remote creeks where prospectors were often ill-prepared, and sell her meals from out of a tent. This work earned Quigley the nickname \\"Fannie the Hike\\". Quigley also began mining herself, and staked her first claim in Clear Creek in 1900. Quigley married her first husband, Angus McKenzie, in 1900. Together, they operated a roadhouse on Hunker Creek, near Gold Bottom. After a turbulent few years together, Quigley left her husband and hiked to Rampart, Alaska. In 1906, Quigley travelled to Kantishna, Alaska, which people had recently begun mining. She staked 26 claims between 1907 and 1919. Quigley married her second husband, Joe Quigley, in 1918, and they ran a mining operation together, leasing out their claims to miners. Fannie Quigley provided for the mining camp by hunting, trapping, and growing food in her garden, and became known as an extraordinary backcountry cook. Because the Quigleys' cabin was located en route for mountaineering expeditions to Mount McKinley (now Denali), they hosted many visitors, including writer Jack London. A practicing naturalist and nurse, Quigley went to work at the Nenana Hospital in Nenana, Alaska, in 1920, during the Spanish flu pandemic. In 1937, the Quigleys' mining claims were leased to the Red Top Mining Company; the Quigleys split the income as part of their divorce settlement. After the divorce, Joe Quigley moved to Seattle and Fannie remained in Kantishna. Her cabin was now accessible by a road through Mount McKinley Park (previously, one could only access it by dog sled or on foot), and she hosted park personnel and dignitaries in her home.  Death and legacy  Quigley's home in Denali National Park, as photographed in 2019. Quigley died in her cabin in 1944 at age 73. Today, visitors can visit the remnants of her homestead, located in what is now Denali National Park and Preserve. Quigley was inducted into the Alaska Mining Hall of Fame in 2000. A biography by Jane G. Haigh, Searching for Fannie Quigley: A Wilderness Life in the Shadow of Mount McKinley, was published in 2007.

Originally formed by Alabama high school friends, Pain played punk rock, toured worldwide, and released four albums. Though the group was effectively in stasis after the bandleader left, they reformed in 2019 as Salvo and released a new album called Off the Charts. History McGill‚ÄìToolen Catholic High School friends Dan Lord (born in ), Mark \\"Pose\\" Milewicz, and Adam Guthrie formed Pain in 1994. Guthrie was a guitarist-songwriter, Milewicz played bass guitar, and Lord became the band's songwriter and lead singer. Pain logo from the 1990s In 1998, Ted Turner contacted Pain's publicist and contracted with the band to produce some original music for Jabberjaw. The \\"pop-punk four-piece rock band with a three-piece horn section and keyboards\\", over its six years, performed on MTV2, shared a ticket with The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, received airtime on the radio, worked with The WB, sold CDs worldwide, and was even shut down mid-song by another band‚ÄîTrain‚Äîfor drawing away their fans at a 1999 concert. In 2000, while the band was talking with interested record labels, Lord shut down Pain to pursue his religious calling. Lord received his Master of Theology from University of Dallas, married, became an author, and , lived in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina and taught at Cathedral of Saint John the Baptist in nearby Charleston. In 2019, Lord's abrupt dissolution of Pain and the subsequent effects on band members' lives, were still a touchy subject with those involved. In the years leading up to 2019, Lord continued writing music and found that most of his new material was best-suited as Pain songs. Reconnecting with Guthrie, the two agreed that these new tracks should be recorded and released. When Milewicz declined to return, Lord and Guthrie felt it was inappropriate to call the group Pain without one of its co-founders, and so they called the new lineup Salvo. After what their new record label (Earth Libraries) called \\"a gigantic break\\", Salvo was scheduled to release the first album under the new name (Off the Charts) in Mobile, Alabama on September 13, 2019. Membership Lord, Guthrie, and Milewicz formed Pain in 1994, George Kennedy joined on drums in 1998, and Milewicz' wife Liz played keyboard. In Guthrie's 2019 interview with BroadwayWorld, he recalled that there was a \\"feeling of 'us against them between the founding band members and those who joined after the fact, almost a hierarchy where older members outranked the newer ones. Salvo's lineup problematically hails from across the southeastern United States: South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama (Birmingham, Spanish Fort, Mobile), and New Orleans. Lord, Guthrie, and Kennedy returned as lead vocalist, guitarist, and drummer respectively. Other Pain alumni that returned were Stuart McNair on horns and accordion; Niamh Tuohy Fields on violin; George Kennedy on drums; Jason Reid; Christopher Johnson; and Demondrae Thurman. New members of the ensemble include Will Hudson, Rachael Wilson, Melanie Rodgers, Kim Scott, Rachael Roberts, and Tommy Bowen. Music In February 1997, Lord took to the band's website to categorically deny that Pain was a ska band: \\"There are a lot of styles we emulate and ain't none of 'em from the island of Jamaica. So please, PLEASE, unless you're just havin' some fun with us, don't call us a ska band.\\" Despite this, Art Howard in Feedback described the band as \\"pop- ska-punk\\" in 1999, saying \\"their songs are actually bouncy, upbeat anthems about 'kooky kids, lovely girls, and people we hate. In 2013, The Post and Courier described Pain's music as punk rock, known for its \\"upbeat lyrics and melodies, including a horn section, and Lord's semi-hyperactive antics.\\" BroadwayWorld made comparisons to Green Day and Fishbone in their 2019 article. Lord himself boiled down Pain's musical style to \\"happy\\". Salvo continues Pain's tradition of \\"being real heavy on the melodies and horn parts and being upbeat\\", though Lord noted subtle, indescribable changes due to the band's age that allow the band's product to sound like Pain, evolved. Earth Libraries described Salvo's music as similar to Pain's, but with \\"a new maturity and mastery\\". AL.com described Salvo's pop punk offerings as similar to an eclectic Green Day, the horns & guitars evoked The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and the \\"incisive yet playful intelligence in the lyrics\\" calls to mind Barenaked Ladies and They Might Be Giants. =Albums= Pain released four albums. Midgets with Guns album was released in Australia in mid-1997, while the single off that record (\\"Square Pegs\\") was available for . Wonderful Beef was released in the United States on November 18, 1997; the album has 13 songs, including \\"The Song of the Seven Inch Cowboy\\". Full Speed Ahead was scheduled to be released by Vegas Records on October 19, 1999. Salvo's 2019 album was a crowdfunding success; Off the Charts was recorded at Ol Elegante in Birmingham, Alabama, and is planned for release on CD, vinyl, and digitally. A release party was scheduled for September 13 & 14, 2019 in Mobile, Alabama. Reception According to AL.com, Pain had \\"big following[s]\\" in the southeastern and West Coast of the United States. In 2019, filmmaker Rebecca Pugh (fianc√©e to Adam Guthrie) premiered her documentary film about Pain, Anthem for the Middle Aged Band in Birmingham, Alabama. At Salvo's first performance in Birmingham, Alabama in May 2019, the venue was sold out. Salvo drummer George Kennedy said, \\"The coolest thing about that show was, I thought it was going to be a bunch of old geezers like us, [‚Ä¶] It was a bunch of people who could not have been more than 2 years old when Pain broke up, singing every lyric to us. The whole experience was euphoric.\\"  References  External links Category:American pop punk groups Category:American punk rock groups Category:American ska musical groups Category:musical groups disestablished in 2000 Category:musical groups established in 1994 Category:musical groups from Alabama Category:musical groups reestablished in 2019 ","title":"Salvo (band)"},{"id":"61524483","text":"The Spanish Jade may refer to: * The Spanish Jade (1922 film), 922 British silent drama film * The Spanish Jade (1915 film), 1915 American drama silent film ","title":"The Spanish Jade"},{"id":"61524497","text":"Training Programs in Epidemiology and Public Health Interventions Network (TEPHINET) is a global professional network of field epidemiology training programs (FETPs).

After completing his medical training, he first moved to the EMBL in Heidelberg, Germany, and then to Mitotix Inc., Cambridge, MA (a pharmaceutical startup that he co-founded and that pioneered the concept of CDK inhibitors as anti-cancer agents), where he carried out his postdoctoral studies under the mentorship of Gulio Draetta. As a postdoctoral fellow, Pagano first described the importance of cyclins and CDKs for DNA replication, and then the role of the ubiquitin system in controlling the cellular levels of CDK inhibitors. In 1996, upon completion of his postdoctoral studies, Pagano moved to the New York University School of Medicine as an Assistant Professor. He was appointed to the position of Associate Professor in 1999, tenured in 2003, and became Full-Professor in 2005. In 2015, he became the Chairman of the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Pharmacology.  Honors and Service  Since 1997, Pagano's laboratory has been funded uninterruptedly by the National Institute of Health. In 2008, he was named a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator. He was also the recipient of other grants and awards, including an NCI MERIT Award (2006-2017) and an NIGMS MIRA Award (2020-2025) in recognition of his achievements in cell and cancer biology. He serves on the Advisory Board of several pharmaceutical companies and foundations, and on the editorial board of several peer-reviewed journals in the fields of molecular oncology, cell biology, and cell signaling. Pagano has published over 200 peer-reviewed papers and has been issued 7 patents. He trained many predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows, most of whom have gone on to successful independent careers either in academia (e.g., UPENN, Columbia University, Boston Children's Hospital, University of Illinois College of Medicine, NYU, University of Oxford, Technical University of Munich, Sapienza University of Rome, University of Verona, and University of Tokushima) or in the pharmaceutical industry. Pagano's laboratory has always been open to people from all parts of the world for training and collaborative efforts. Among the most notable visiting scientists are the Nobel laureate Avram Hershko, who spent seven summer sabbaticals in his laboratory and with whom Pagano has co- authored 10 papers, and Yosef Shiloh, known for his discovery of the checkpoint kinase ATM, who spent a sabbatical year in his lab.

Background Although Switzerland remained neutral during World War I, it did mobilize its army. The military called 220,000 men into active service. The Swiss labor movement initially supported the cause of national defense.Degen & Koller 2019, p. 65. The war caused significant economic privation in the country.Meier 1988, p. 66. It also deepened the rift between workers on the one side and business and farmers on the other. The war caused a considerable spike in the price of consumer goods. Bread prices, for instance, doubled between 1914 and 1918. Farmers and many businesses profited from this, but workers suffered. Their wages did not rise with prices. Average industrial real wages sank by a quarter.Degen 2019, Degen & Koller 2019, p. 65. Military mobilization further contributed to workers' distress. Workers drafted into the military were not compensated for lost wages and soldiers' pay was much lower than industrial workers' wages.Degen & Koller 2019, pp. 65-66. Robert Grimm In February 1918 at a meeting in Olten, leaders of the Swiss Socialist Party (SPS), the country's labor unions, and the socialist press decided to create the Olten Action Committee (OAK). Its purpose was to provide unified leadership to the labor movement and the socialist party.Gautschi 1968, pp. 89-93. It was led by Robert Grimm, the editor of the socialist newspaper Berner Tagwacht and a member of the lower house of parliament, the National Council. The other members were Friedrich Schneider and Rosa Bloch as representatives of the SPS and Karl D√ºrr, Konrad Ilg, August Huggler, and Franz Reichmann as representatives of various labor unions.Gautschi 1968, pp. 93-94. Run-up On November 5, 1918, the Federal Council, Switzerland's executive, deployed two infantry regiments and two cavalry brigades to Zurich. It claimed that economic and political instability could give radicals, particularly foreigners in Zurich, the opportunity to cause disturbances and to attempt a revolution and that the soldiers were needed to maintain order.Meier 1988, p. 67. The troops marched into Zurich on November 7.Degen 2019. This move angered the city's labor organizations who accused the government of seeking to establish a military dictatorship. The OAK also protested the government's decision. It called for a one-day strike in nineteen cities on November 9, a Saturday.Meier 1988, pp. 67. The strikes remained peaceful.Degen 2019. They only took place in some of the nineteen cities, because labor organizers in the others felt that they had not been given enough time to prepare and consequently did not heed the Committee's call.Meier 1988, pp. 67-68. In Zurich, however, labor leaders considered the Committee's one-day strike overly cautious and vowed to continue the struggle until the Army withdrew from the city. The next day, a Sunday, Zurich's labor movement had made plans to celebrate the first anniversary of the Russian October Revolution. The same day, news of the German November Revolution and the toppling of the German Emperor reached Zurich. The military proscribed all public demonstrations. When troops dispersed a crowd on the square M√ºnsterplatz, the resulting disorder left four protesters injured and one soldier dead. Protesters reassembled on the Milchbuck and were attacked by cavalry bearing sabers, forcing them to flee.Meier 1988, p. 68. General strike Leaflet issued by the OAK calling for the general strike The altercations in Zurich forced the OAK to act. Its members discussed their options in a long and tumultuous meeting.Degen 2019, Meier 1988, p. 68. The Committee issued a proclamation entitled \\"To the Working People of Switzerland\\". The proclamation called for a general strike beginning on November 12 and made nine demands: *new National Council elections with proportional representation, *women's suffrage and women's right to hold office, *a general obligation to work, *the 48-hour week, *reorganizing the military into a people's army, *improving the food supply, *old age and disability insurance, *establishing a state monopoly on foreign trade, *and forcing the rich to pay off the country's sovereign debt.Degen 2019, Meier 1988, pp. 68-69. The Federal Council immediately rejected the Committee's demands. It left the door open to social reforms, but insisted they could only be accomplished through legal procedures. It called on the Swiss people to side with the government. The government also placed all federal employees under military law, subject to punishment if they participated in the strike. It mobilized the Army, some 110,000 soldiers. Furthermore, the Swiss government decided to close down the Soviet Union's diplomatic mission in Berne. Its staff, including the mission chief Jan Berzin, were escorted to the German border on November 12.Meier 1988, p. 69. The general strike started as planned on Tuesday, November 12. Participation was greatest in the industrial areas of German-speaking northern and eastern Switzerland. In Zurich and Basel workers were particularly enthusiastic. Even workers who might not otherwise have taken part in the strike, particularly those in rural areas, were prevented from commuting to work because trains did not run. In the French- speaking Romandy, strike participation was far lower, because the OAK had less influence there. French speakers exhibited more support for the Allies in World War I and some suspected Grimm of harboring sympathy for the Germans. There were no major incidents on the first day of the strike.Degen 2019, Meier 1988, p. 69. On November 12, both chambers of the Swiss legislature assembled for a special session, with some delegates requiring military assistance to reach Berne. By a vote of 136 to 15, the Federal Assembly passed several measures designed to break the strike after two days of debates. Only socialist delegates voted against the measures. The OAK was given an ultimatum to call off the strike by 5 pm on November 13. At 2 am of November 14, the Committee and the socialist leadership complied, calling on workers to resume their work on Friday, November 15. The Committee's decision was unanimous, but for the dissent of Grimm and Schneider, a labor leader from Basel.Meier 1988, p. 70. Federal Palace in Berne, which houses the national legislature and executive The strike had already been called off when it claimed its first lives. In Grenchen, a town in the Canton of Solothurn, protesting workers were tearing up railroad tracks and soldiers shot at them. Three died and more were injured.Meier 1988, p. 70. In Basel and Zurich, workers initially refused to believe news of the strike's end. Schneider traveled to Basel to convince them to return to work. In Zurich, the labor movement, led by Ernst Nobs, was incensed by the decision to end the strike and considered ignoring it. Eventually, moderates prevailed, but in some factories work did not resume until the next Monday.Meier 1988, pp. 70-71. Aftermath and legacy The 1918 general strike was the most significant domestic crisis in Switzerland since the Sonderbund War of 1847 and the formation of the Swiss federal state in 1848.Degen & Koller 2019, p. 64, Gautschi 1968, p. 9. In early 1919, twenty- one leaders were put on trial for incitement to mutiny. Grimm, Schneider, and Fritz Platten were convicted for their involvement in the publication and dissemination of the pamphlet calling for the general strike. Specifically, the proclamation contained a call for soldiers to ignore orders to shoot workers. They were sentenced to six months in prison. Nobs was convicted because of a different text he published which was found to be subversive. He was sentenced to a four-week prison term. All four served their sentences, while the other seventeen defendants were acquitted.Meier 1988, pp. 71-72. Commemorative plaque in Grenchen The strike did not feature in many works of literary fiction. It plays a part in Meinrad Inglin's Schweizerspiegel, which was published in 1938. Les signes parmi nous, written by Charles-Ferdinand Ramuz in 1919, tells the story of a Bible salesman who travels throughout Switzerland and is led to believe that the Apocalypse is coming because of the Spanish flu and the general strike. Jean-Paul Zimmermann's L'√©tranger dans la ville, written in 1919 but only published in 1931, deals with the way the strike was perceived in the town of Le Locle.Mazbouri et al 2018, p. 37. In film, the strike was the subject of the 2018 docufiction Generalstreik 1918: Die Schweiz am Rande eines B√ºrgerkriegs, directed by Hansj√ºrg Zumstein, which praises the sense of responsibility exhibited both by labor leaders and government officials to avoid a bloodshed.Mazbouri et al 2018, p. 25.

It is operated by Switzer-Carty Transportation. It functions as the local and lowest tier of public transit in the area, and connects to higher-order transit in the form of Simcoe County LINX, the county's regional intercommunity bus service, as well as GO Transit train and bus service at the Bradford GO Station. History BWG Transit service began on 1 May 2014. Annual boardings in the first year of service was 19,009. For the second year (2015‚Äì16), this had only slightly increased, to 19,291. By the third year of service (2016‚Äì17), however, boardings had jumped sharply to 24,409, and increased significantly again to 27,888 in 2017‚Äì18. The town of Bradford West Gwillimbury received $76,387 in funding in 2017 from the federal Public Transit Infrastructure Funding program, which supported the purchase of a new bus. In late 2017, transit planners conducted a public consultation process regarding the expansion of service. The most requested service improvements were (in order from most to least): the introduction of Saturday service, introduction of weekday evening service, introduction of Sunday service, a new connection to Newmarket, a third local bus route, and a connection to Barrie. A shuttle was also proposed to service the Reagens industrial area. Following this process, planners recommended introduction of Saturday daytime (9am to 5pm) and weekday evening (5pm to 7pm) service, a pilot Newmarket connection, and the Reagens industrial shuttle. On 4 September 2018, Bradford West Gwillimbury Town Council voted for a transit funding increase of $192,200 to pay for these improvements, but rejected the $40,000 Newmarket pilot, which would have connected the Bradford GO Station with the Newmarket Bus Terminal, allowing BWG Transit riders to connect to YRT and Viva buses and enhancing east-west mobility within the region. City councillors criticized the potential for the plan to encourage out-of-town shopping, such as at the Upper Canada Mall. As an alternative, Mayor Rob Keffer suggested that a cross-jurisdiction route would be best achieved through the regional governments of Simcoe County and York Region and their respective transit services, rather than the town's local BWG Transit. Fares BWG Transit uses a flat $3 cash fare for adults, while children under 5 are allowed to ride for free. Riders can also purchase a reloadable electronic fare card, easyPASS, for $2. easyPASS fares are also $2. The system uses 90-minute transfers, which are available as a paper slip for riders who pay the cash fare, or which are stored on the easyPASS card for easyPASS riders. Routes BWG Transit currently has two routes, the 1 Crosstown and 2 Around-Town. Route 2 Around- Town is further broken down into routes 2A (clockwise) and 2B (counter- clockwise), which run along roughly the same path in opposing fashion. Route 2B (Around-Town: Counter-clockwise) does not operate on Saturdays, and the entire system does not operate on Sundays. All other routes operate a Monday‚ÄìFriday schedule, with a reduced Saturday schedule.

Early life Irvin was born on July 2, 1799 in Glasgow, Scotland. He was the son of Janet (n√©e Scott) Irvin and William Irvin. His maternal grandfather was the Reverend Richard Scott of Ewes, Scotland. After an initial education by private tutors, he attended Glasgow Academy, before graduating from the University of Glasgow in 1823. Career Irvin first visited the United States in 1823 to visit relatives. After briefly returning to Scotland, he emigrated to the U.S. in 1824 to join his uncle, Thomas Irvin, who ran an extensive shipping business in New York City from 198 Front Street, which he had founded in 1787. Following his uncles death in 1836, Irvin took over the business, eventually bringing on board his two sons. Around 1840, the firm became the sole New York cosignees of the Gartsherrie Iron of William Baird & Co. of Glasgow, one of the most successful dealers of iron in the United Kingdom. They were also the New York agent of the Pioneer Line of Trans-Atlantic Steamships which included the SS Great Britain and SS Great Western. In 1863, the firm, known as Richard Irvin & Co., relocated to 37 William Street and expanded from its commission business to banking. For fifty years, he served as a director of the Mechanics' National Bank and, at the time of his death, he was the oldest member of the New York Chamber of Commerce (having been a member since 1834). Irvin joined the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York in 1825, serving as Manager from 1828 to 1833, second vice-president from 1835 to 1836, first vice-president from 1836 to 1837, and president from 1842 to 1845 and, again, from 1863 to 1864. Personal life On May 23, 1832, Irvin was married to Mary Williams Proudfit (1809‚Äì1890) in Salem, New York. Mary was the daughter of Susan (n√©e Williams) Proudfit and the Rev. Dr. Alexander Proudfit who served as pastor of the Associate Reformed Church in Salem for forty years. Her maternal grandfather was General John Williams, a Colonel during the American Revolutionary War and subsequently a member of Congress. Together, they were the parents of nine children, including: * William Irvin (1833‚Äì1909), a Presbyterian minister. * Alexander Proudfit Irvin (1835‚Äì1884), who married Susan Sherman Taylor, daughter of Robert Lenox Taylor, in 1863. * Susan Williams Irvin (b. 1836). * Mary Margaret Irvin (1837‚Äì1920), who married James Abercrombie Burden (1833‚Äì1906), son of Henry Burden, 1869. * Richard Irvin Jr. (1840‚Äì1896), who married Mary Morris (1848‚Äì1918). Her sister was married to Henry Clews Jr. after her divorce from Frederick Gebhard. * Susan Irvin (b. 1842). * John Proudfit Irvin (1844‚Äì1845), who died in infancy. * Samuel Irvin (1847‚Äì1884), a banker who died unmarried. * John James Irvin (b. 1850). Irvin died at his country home in Oyster Bay, New York on June 27, 1888. =Descendants= Through his daughter Mary, he was a grandfather to James Abercrombie Burden Jr. (1871‚Äì1932), Richard Irvin Burden (1872‚Äì1900), William Proudfit Burden (1876‚Äì1943), Arthur Scott Burden (1879‚Äì1921), who married Florence Adele Sloane, a member of the Vanderbilt family.

The future for the FA did not look promising at this time: only ten clubs were members, resulting in low attendance at the 1867 annual meeting. During the next year, Graham attempted to increase membership by writing to every known club in the country. This increased membership to thirty by 1868, but did not prevent the association from running out of money, with the officers having to cover expenses out of their own pockets. After his resignation as secretary in 1870, Graham continued to serve on the FA's committee from 1870 to 1871. He was also a member of Barnes Football Club, and served as secretary of that club in 1868. In both these posts, Graham succeeded Robert Willis, who married Graham's elder sister Helen in 1867.

Education  Octavian Saiu received his PhD in Theatre Studies from National University of Theatre and Film (NUTF) in Romania and completed another PhD in Comparative Literature at the University of Otago in New Zealand. His Romanian doctoral thesis focused on the concept of theatrical space; the New Zealand one analysed the European reception of the theatre of the absurd. He was a Post-Doctoral Fellow in the English Department of the University of Otago, and has received his Habilitation in Theatre and Performing Arts.  Career  Saiu is a teacher in the Postgraduate Programme of NUTF and a PhD supervisor in the Doctoral School of ‚ÄûLucian Blaga‚Äù University of Sibiu. He was a Visiting Fellow at the Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies, School of Advanced Study ‚Äì University of London, and has been Visiting Professor at various universities in Europe and Asia, as well as the Grotowski Institute. He chaired sessions in the ‚ÄúTalks and Workshops Series‚Äù of Edinburgh International Festival and has been the Chair of the Conferences of Sibiu International Theatre Festival since 2004. Since 2014 he has been the Chair of the Shakespeare Studies Conference in the context of the biennial Craiova International Shakespeare Festival. He is a collaborator of Wuzhen Theatre Festival and a Founding Member of the International Theatre Town Alliance in Shengzhou. Saiu is Adjunct Secretary General of the International Association of Theatre Critics (IATC) and President of the Romanian Section ‚Äì Theatre Studies of IATC.

He is the recipient of the Critics‚Äô Award (2010) and the Award of the Union of Theatre Artists (UNITER) in 2013. One of Saiu‚Äôs constant activities involves public talks and dialogues. In 2019 in Hong Kong, he spoke about the global perception of Chinese culture, beyond the usual clich√©s of commodification and cultural diplomacy. One of the recurrent themes in Saiu‚Äôs talks is performative space, a notion he links with the idea of creative energy. As affirmed in his book on this topic, Saiu considers Hamlet a character whose madness is not merely feigned, but real. As a promoter of critical thinking in theatre and performing arts, he organised a keynote panel in the context of the ASSITEJ congress in Cape Town on the values of criticism and value judgment in children‚Äôs theatre. More recently, he spoke about the role of critical thinking in theatre pedagogy during a plenary address at the Conference of the ITI/UNESCO Network for Higher Education in the Performing Arts (2018). At the Academy of Arts in Berlin, as invited speaker at a conference organized to celebrate Hans-Thies Lehmann‚Äôs Postdramatic Theatre, he spoke about the dangers of employing cultural concepts as ‚Äúumbrella terms‚Äù for contemporary theatre, with specific reference to the title of Lehmann‚Äôs seminal essay. Throughout the years, he has hosted cultural conversations with Tim Robbins, Jin Xing, Neil LaBute, Ohad Naharin, Jaroslaw Fret, Mao Weitao, Stan Lai, Stanley Wells, Benny Lim, Robert Wilson, Sasha Waltz, Thomas Ostermeier, Declan Donnellan, Akram Khan and many others.

Plot Summary In 1943, Italian American soldier Julie Sarno is doing a routine secretarial job at a United States Army office in wartime London, the most risky part of her job being to avoid the unwanted amorous advances of a womanizing general. Suddenly, she is taken in complete secrecy to the Carlton Hotel and told that she has an assignment which can influence the course of the war. Ben Ivey, a senior White House official of President Roosevelt's inner circle, has secretly arrived in London on a vital mission, having to do with the forthcoming invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - and then been struck by a mysterious, incapacitating malady. Doctors can do nothing to help him, and he insisted that Julie is the only person who can help him. In fact, Julie had known Ben Ivey for sixteen years. As readers learn from the flashbacks which form a large part of the plot, she first met him in 1927 - when she was a precocious 11-year-old girl and he was a young social worker at a local settlement house in the Lower East Side slum where she grew up. At one time she had been madly in love with him, later she came to greatly hate and despise him because of a tragic love triangle involving herself, him and her beloved elder sister Celia. The book follows back and forth this tangled relationship, from the slum childhood, through an Oregon land-reclamation project in the early years of the New Deal, and up to the tense standoff at the hotel room in WWII London. In the final chapters, secrets which have been suppressed for many years come out at last. On the highly emotional development of the protagonists' personal relationships hinges the success of a major WWII military operation, involving thousands of soldiers, numerous civilians living under Nazi occupation, a risky mission behind enemy lines, and the young exile King of a Scandinavian country. Critical reception Kirkus Reviews noted that \\"Her [julie's] success and her challenging of Ben light up the dark memories of their earlier associations and indicate a change for the future. Leadership and the qualities of a leader are mirrored in Ben's career while the Sarnos -- believing, distrusting or unmoved by his persuasions -- find their strengths in their Italian-American origins\\".Kirkus Reviews on \\"Before You Go\\" References External links *Kirkus Reviews on \\"Before You Go\\" * Mel Gussow, \\"Jerome Weidman Dies at 85; Author of Novels and Plays\\", New York Times, Oct. 7, 1998 * Digitized version from the University of Michigan, 21 Sep 2007 Category:1960 American novels Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Lower East Side Category:Novels set in Oregon Category:New Deal ","title":"Before You Go (novel)"},{"id":"61524954","text":"Janelle Shane is an optics research scientist and artificial intelligence researcher, writer and public speaker.

Five military and civilian specialists were killed and three (or six, depending on the source) were injured. Background Between November 2017 and 26 February 2018, Russia conducted four tests of the 9M730 Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile, launched from other test sites. According to the United States intelligence community, only the flight test in November 2017 from Pankovo test site was moderately successful with all of the others ending in failure. According to Russia, none of the tests ended in failure. During recovery efforts later in 2018, Russia used three ships, one capable of handling radioactive material from the weapon nuclear core, to bring the missile tested in November 2017 from the seabed of Barents Sea back to the surface. Based on satellite images, the Nyonoksa test site copies those at Kapustin Yar and Pankovo, where 9M730 Burevestnik was tested. Accident The accident occurred at the State Central Navy Testing Range () which is the main rocket launching site of the Russian Navy and is also called Nyonoksa. According to the version presented by Russian officials, it was a result of a failed test of an \\"isotope power source for a liquid-fuelled rocket engine\\". Nonproliferation expert Jeffrey Lewis and Federation of American Scientists fellow Ankit Panda suspect the incident resulted from a Burevestnik cruise missile test. However, other arms control experts disputed the assertions: Ian Williams of the Center for Strategic and International Studies and James Acton of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace expressed skepticism over Moscow's financial and technical capabilities to field the weapon, while Michael Kofman of the Wilson Center concluded that the explosion was probably not related to Burevestnik but instead to the testing of another military platform. According to CNBC, the Russians were trying to recover a missile from the seabed which was lost during a previously failed test. No NOTAMs were filed prior to the explosion to warn pilots of a possible missile test. Previously the residents of Nyonoksa were warned and evacuated prior to the missile tests. Also, two Russian special purpose ships were at the Nyonoksa test range when the explosion occurred: the Serebryanka (Rosatom Flot vessel used for handling nuclear waste from nuclear reactors) and the Zvyozdochka (used for underwater salvage operations and is equipped with two heavy lift sea cranes and two underwater unmanned robots). An event of explosive nature was registered on 8 August at 06:00 UTC (local time 09:00) at the infrasound station in Bardufoss (Troms, Norway). The event was also registered on seismic data, which means it must have been coupled to the ground. The practical meaning of an explosion coupling to the ground is that it took place either at the ground or in contact with it; for example on water. The timing and location of the event coincides with the reported accident in Archangelsk. Several fishermen stated on sanatatur.ru that they witnessed the accident: one saw a 100-meter column of water rise into the air after the explosion and another saw a large hole in the side of a ship which had been at the site of the explosion. Aftermath In the aftermath of the explosion, three of the victims were treated at the Semashko Medical Center in Arkhangelsk, which had radiation treatment expertise and employed the use of hazmat suits, while three others were taken to the Arkhangelsk Regional Clinical Hospital, arriving at 4:35 p.m. on August 8, where the hospital staff were not warned of the radiation exposure. Several Arkhangelsk Regional Hospital staff were later flown to Moscow for radiation testing. One doctor was found to test positive for Cesium-137, though the levels remain unknown, as the medical staff involved were forced to sign non-disclosure agreements. According to an unnamed medical worker, two injured by the explosion died of radiation sickness en route from Arkhangelsk Regional Clinical Hospital (AOKB) () to treatment in Moscow. Their bodies were sent to Moscow's Burnazyan Federal Medical and Biophysical Center (FMBC) (). Six persons with severe injuries from the explosion and radiation exposure were delivered to Burnazyan by two medivac flights and ambulances with special plastic seals, with paramedics wearing chemical protective suits, and, because an operating room apron was highly contaminated after an operation, all Arkhangelsk Regional Hospital doctors, nurses, and staff who came into contact with the injured were sent to Burnazyan, too. The rooms at the Arkangelsk hospital, where injured victims had been treated, were sealed after treatment but none of the hospital workers and staff had worn anti-contamination clothing. =Five immediate deaths= On Monday 12 August 2019, flags in Sarov were lowered to half-staff during the viewing of five coffins in Sarov's main square. These were the bodies of five Rosatom (RFNC-VNIIEF) workers who were killed during and immediately following the August 8, 2019 explosion. Later, on 12 August 2019, their bodies were buried in Sarov's main cemetery. On 21 November 2019, they were posthumously awarded the Order of Courage. =Radiation levels= Yuri Peshkov from the Roshidromet, the Russian meteorology service, stated that background radiation levels peaked at 4-16 times normal levels at six of its eight stations in Severodvinsk, to the east, reaching 1.78 microsieverts per hour shortly after the explosion, but returned to normal levels 2.5 hours after the explosion. The administration in Severodvinsk reported elevated radiation levels for 40 minutes leading to a rush on medical iodine. In the days following the event several monitoring stations in Russia stopped sending data to the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization (CTBTO), a data network for radiation monitoring made of 80 stations around the world. According to the information posted by Roshydromet on radiation situation in Severodvinsk in the hours following the accident, a number of short-lived isotopes were discovered: strontium-91, barium-139, barium-140 and lanthanum-140. Norwegian nuclear safety expert Nils B√∏hmer stated that such isotope composition proves a nuclear reactor was involved in the accident. On 2 September, Belomorkanal news agency published a video showcasing two abandoned pontoons near the mouth of where the Nyonoksa River empties into the Dvina Bay only 4 km from the center of Nyonoksa, with one of them carrying an array of heavily damaged testing equipment. According to Nyonoksa residents, the first pontoon \\"PP PP Plant No. 2\\" () with two blue containers washed ashore on 9 August and the heavily damaged second pontoon with a damaged crane, a blue container and a yellow container similar to a Siempelkamp container for highly radioactive materials was towed by tugboats to a site near the first pontoon about five days after the explosion. The video by Severodvinsk journalist Nikolai Karneyevich () demonstrates gamma radiation levels at from the abandoned vessels on the White Sea shore close to Nyonoksa with the reading reaching 186 ŒºR/hour - 15 times higher than natural. Nyonoksa residents said that just days prior to the 31 August measurements, the gamma ray radiation levels were 750 ŒºR/hour at the same location. Alpha and beta radiation levels have not been measured. The site has been neither enclosed nor guarded and no radiation warning signs have been observed. =Evacuation of population= According to the local press, it was announced that about 450 inhabitants of the Nyonoksa village had to be evacuated by train for two hours on 14 August then this evacuation would have been canceled. According to The Moscow Times quoting RIA Novosti, residents of Nyonoksa will be evacuated each month by special train for two hours (early Wednesday morning) for planned military activities in the city; evacuation that according to a villager already exists: it is expected, everyone is taken from the village about once a month, even if some remained behind. But now, after the last events, I think everyone will leave. The governor of the Arkhangelsk region (Igor Orlov) denied that the evacuation was an emergency, saying it was a routine measure, already \\"planned\\". Reactions * : Although initially denied, involvement of radioactive materials in the accident was later confirmed by Russian officials. On 13 August, the authorities initiated evacuation of the village of Nyonoksa. On 14 August the evacuation was cancelled. On 26 August, Aleksei Karpov, Russia‚Äôs envoy to international organizations in Vienna, stated that the accident was linked to the development of weapons which Russia had to begin creating as \\"one of the tit-for-tat measures in the wake of the United States‚Äô withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty\\". On 21 November, at the ceremony of presentation of posthumous awards to the dead men's families, Vladimir Putin stated that the scientists killed in the August 8th explosion had been testing an ‚Äúunparalleled‚Äù weapon: ‚ÄúWe are talking about the most advanced and unparalleled technical ideas and solutions about weapons design to ensure Russia‚Äôs sovereignty and security for decades to come\\". He also noted that the \\"weapon is to be perfected regardless of anything\\". On 22 November 2019, Dmitry Peskov, Putin's Press Secretary, stated that the investigation into the explosion will not be made public. * : Over away, tiny amounts of radioactive iodine, which were collected from 9‚Äì12 August, were detected at an air filter station in Svanhovd by Norway's nuclear safety authority. The agency could not determine if the detection was linked to the accident, and, according to Reuters, such iodine measurements were not unusual as monitoring stations in Norway detected radioactive iodine about six to eight times a year and also were usually unable to determine the source of the isotope. *: On 12 August a tweet from US president Donald Trump suggested that the accident was a failed Burevestnik test. In the tweet Burevestnik was referred to by its NATO reporting name \\"Skyfall\\". On 10 October, Thomas DiNanno, member of the United States delegation to the United Nations General Assembly First Committee, stated that the \\"August 8th 'Skyfall' incident [...] was the result of a nuclear reaction that occurred during the recovery of a Russian nuclear- powered cruise missile\\", which \\"remained on the bed of the White Sea since its failed test early last year\\". On 14 October, three United States diplomats were removed from the Nyonoksa-Severodvinsk train; Russia accused the diplomats of attempting to enter the closed city of Severodvinsk without the official permission, stating the diplomats had told Russia they were visiting Arkhangelsk, which wasn't within a restricted zone, but then traveled to the closed area next to the test site. The US Embassy in Russia and the State Department confirmed the incident, stating the diplomats were on official travel and had informed Russian authorities of their travel in advance.

The player takes control of Flame, a rescue service android who pilots the Paladin mecha Grit, a suit of advanced sentient power armor. Together they fight and slay demonic invaders using their own weapons against them. The game draws inspiration from several NES- era titles including Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, Mega Man and Blaster Master.  Gameplay  The game consists of 17 levels, during which players take control of either the slow but powerful Paladin mech Grit or the small but swift Squire pilot Flame. When commanding Grit, the player can pick up discarded melee weapons dropped by defeated enemies and use them in battle against them. The combat mechanics include a high-versus-low attacking and blocking system (similar to Zelda II), along with a rock-paper-scissors style weapon triangle system that grants your weapons damage bonuses or reductions depending on the weapon used by the enemy. The game also implements a weapon durability system similar to Breath of the Wild where weapons degrade and eventually break after enough uses, with some weapons being more durable than others. Every weapon has a predetermined spell within them that the player can cast at any time by breaking the weapon intentionally, ranging from recovery and defensive spells to ranged or screen-clearing attacks. Weapons can also be thrown at enemies to deal extra damage at the cost of breaking the weapon or be left at a pedestal to act as a checkpoint upon death. Similar to Blaster Master, the player can also eject from Grit at any time to play as Flame. She is quick and able to fit through tight spaces, although she cannot pick up weapons dropped by enemies and has significantly less health than Grit. She wields a Castlevania-style laser whip that allows her to attack enemies at a distance, siphon energy from power tanks to replenish Grit's health and swing around on ring hooks to reach new areas. Teleportation pads scattered throughout each level allow for Grit to be teleported to Flame's location should the two get separated, but Flame can traverse most levels completely by herself if need be. Stage progression is very similar to the Mega Man series, where each stage's boss is visible beforehand on the stage select screen and each stage can be selected and completed in any order you wish (with some exceptions). Between missions, the unused weapons you have acquired can be converted into Spirit Points that can be used to increase Grit's maximum health once enough are collected. The game also implements a weapon customization system known as the Blacksmith where players can draw and create their own weapons to share with other players through the internet.  Story  = Characters = The story follows the exploits of Flame, a spunky, good- natured rescue service android and the pilot of her loyal Paladin mech and friend Grit, an advanced bipedal suit of sentient power armor. The pair work as operatives for Gauntlet, a peacekeeping organization dedicated to defending Earth from demonic invaders, consisting of the unnamed but reputable Director of the group, the scientist responsible for Paladin research and developmet Dr. Bloom and the group's timid and easily frightened technical support member Etch. The group works together to defend against the dark prince Ravenous (a tall bird-like creature closely resembling a griffon) along with his army of demonic creatures led by the powerful Weapon Keepers, each of which bearing a resemblance to beings from myth or folklore such as the Egyptian god Anubis, the Russian apparition Baba Yaga and the Greek monster Medusa. A stoic and enigmatic centaur-like creature known as The Horseman also appears as a seemingly neutral party, frequently challenging Flame and Grit to fights. He provides assistance to the pair on numerous occasions, although his intentions and loyalties remain mostly unclear. = Plot = A large weapon-shaped meteor falls from space to Earth, landing near Gauntlet's Headquarters in Canada. Demonic invaders lead by a Wendigo monster suddenly appear from within it and begin wreaking havoc. Flame and Grit arrive shortly after and chase the Wendigo deep into the complex, cornering it near their transport ship. Before the duo can engage the monster, it is swiftly killed by The Horseman who battles the two in its place. After a brief scuffle, The Horseman retreats and the pair leave the ruined facility in their transport ship, meeting up with the rest of Gauntlet soon after. Dr. Bloom explains to the group that weapon- shaped meteorites landed in ten countries across the planet, each one acting as a transfer gateway to allow for demonic entities to invade cities across the globe. She explains briefly how a secret religious parchment foretold that spirit weapons would be crafted at a place known as the Forge and would be used to take over the planet, inciting a cosmic war. The group then receives a message from the dark prince Ravenous, ordering the planet to surrender or face destruction. Adamant in fulfilling her role as a rescue android, Flame offers to engage Ravenous' Weapon Keepers as a Squire pilot with Grit. Despite his reservations about Flame's abilities, the Director allows Flame to fight as a Squire pilot operative for Gauntlet. Once Ravenous' final Weapon Keeper is defeated, the skies around Earth begin to darken as the planet is thrust into a perpetual state of twilight. Dr. Bloom and Grit suddenly detect a massive energy spike as The Horseman appears, opening a conduit to an Inverted Tower now orbiting the planet and the cause of the phenomenon. He asks Flame and Grit to go to the Spirit Forge within the tower and stop Ravenous, giving a cryptic warning to the pair not to follow in the footsteps of their predecessor. Initially confused, Flame dismisses The Horseman's warning and proceeds to the Inverted Tower. Once they arrive, the pair encounter a heavily decayed and hostile Paladin mech. After a fierce battle, Flame and Grit manage to defeat the Paladin who then forcibly ejects it's lifeless operator, a woman bearing a striking resemblance to Flame. The duo contacts the Director, who explains that the woman controlling the Paladin was the first Squire pilot Blaze who Gauntlet had lost contact with following a sabotage mission against Ravenous' forces. He reveals that Flame was built in her image and was sent on her mission partially in the hopes that Blaze could be rescued. Ravenous then contacts Flame, telling her that Blaze became corrupted trying to wield his demonic weapons, a fate that all who try to ultimately share. Undeterred, Flame and Grit continue on to the Spirit Forge to confront Ravenous. The duo make their way through the Inverted Tower, eventually reaching Ravenous' lair within the Spirit Forge. He appears and commends Flame's belligerence, offering the duo a place at his side as an ally. After refusing his offer, Flame and Grit engage Ravenous in a final battle to decide the fate of Earth. The duo eventually manage to defeat Ravenous and emerge victorious, with his demonic lance being all that remains of him following the battle. The Horseman then appears, telling the pair to think very carefully about what they do with Ravenous' weapon. How the player interacts with the weapon determines the game's ending. If the player picks up the weapon and leaves the area with it, the bad ending plays out in which The Horseman confronts Flame, claiming that she is disrupting the spirit balance by choosing to take the weapon and is destined to be consumed by it just as Blaze was. An already possessed Flame denies this, claiming that it was Blaze's fault for being a weak human unable to control the weapon's power. The Horseman and Flame battle, although the outcome of the battle is unknown. A final scene depicts Flame and Grit standing before a massive army of monsters, raising up Ravenous' lance triumphantly as their new leader. If the player refuses to pick up the weapon and leaves the area or picks it up and deliberately breaks it, the good ending plays out. With the demonic weapons destroyed and good prevailing, The Horseman appears before Flame and Grit one final time, giving another criptic warning against humans creating any further weapons lest he return as an enemy against them. Flame retorts, saying humans are good people and don't inherently want to create weapons. The Spirit Forge then begins to crumble as the three make their escape. Flame and Grit return safely to Earth while The Horseman uses his spirit energy to tow the Inverted Tower back to deep space. The duo is then contacted by the Director, congratulating Flame for her hard work. Just before he gives the two their next assignment, Flame refuses to join Gauntlet again as a Squire pilot for the time being, desiring to do something better with herself. Returning to civilian life, Flame and Grit join a construction team and happily assist them with repairs on the cities destroyed during the invasion.  Development  Tribute Games announced the game's title with promotional art and early screenshots on March 13, 2019. Concerning early development, game designer and art director Jonathan Lavigne stated in a press release: \\"For a long time I wanted to make a NES-style game with swordplay mechanics like the ones from Zelda II on NES. Panzer Paladin is the culmination of two subjects I wanted to address in a traditional platformer: swordplay and mechas. A strong aspect I also wanted to include in this project is the various usage of an array of weapons. A little bit like in our previous title Mercenary Kings\\". The developers also mentioned that they would be including over 100 unique kinds of weapons in the final game. The prototype demo of Panzer Paladin was showcased for the first time at PAX East in 2019. The game was slated for release in Spring 2020, but was later pushed back to a Summer 2020 release date. On February 25, 2020, the studio announced that Panzer Paladin will be made available on both Steam (for Microsoft Windows) and Nintendo Switch. They later announced the game's slated release date of July 21, 2020 via social media on July 8 of the same year.  Reception  The game received \\"generally favorable\\" reviews, according to the review aggregator Metacritic. The visual design and presentation of Panzer Paladin received significant praise. Stuart Gipp from Nintendo Life was impressed by the game's visuals, stating \\"Panzer Paladins vivid, beautifully- drawn graphics are somewhere between the familiar 8-bit aesthetic and the smooth fidelity of contemporary coin-ops...From the backgrounds to the enemy sprites to the perfectly-done animation, the game's look flawlessly complements its feel.\\" IGNs Seth Macy agreed, noting \\"[The game's plot] sets the perfect tone for the gameplay, and the story plays out in animated cutscenes that would be right at home in any legendary anime of the series, such as Bubblegum Crisis or one of the dozen or so Gundam series over the years.\\" Some reviewers weren't as positive, with most of the criticism directed at the game's high difficulty. Screen Rants Alex Santa Maria was particularly critical, writing \\"Outside of those who've mastered every masochistic NES classic, it's just not clear who Panzer Paladin is going to appeal to - and as a result, only hardcore fans of the genre should even attempt to give this one a spin.\\" He also criticized the gameplay, feeling that \\"even when in the mech, slow movement and basic swordplay turns any backtracking into a torturous undertaking.\\"https://screenrant.com/panzer- paladin-game-review/ Reviewing the PC version, James Cunningham from Hardcore Gamer was more lenient with the game, conceding that \\"There's a lot to love here, including harder remixed versions of the levels and a speed-run mode, but its mean-spirited death penalties mean you have to work for it.\\" Nadia Oxford from USgamer gave a more positive review, stating that the game \\"adopts a bit of every NES platformer you played as a kid, and the result is a little chaotic, but a lot of fun...there are times when the instructions are vague and the lives system doesn't need to exist in this day and age, but it's hard to stay mad when you're surrounded by this much 8-bit beauty.\\"  References  External links * Official website *Press Kit *Facebook Page Category:2020 video games Category:Action video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Platform games Category:Tribute Games games Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games ","title":"Panzer Paladin"},{"id":"61525232","text":"Craig Lewis Cloud is an American diplomat and the United States Ambassador to Botswana.

Vujiƒá.In philosophy, Cukiƒá was a Kantian in influence. Biography Konstantin Lazareviƒá Cukiƒá was born in Karanovac (Kraljevo) on 13 April 1826, according to the old Julian Calendar. [1] His father, Petar Lazareviƒá, was the son-in- law of the Duke of the First Serbian Uprising, Pavle Cukiƒá, a member of the Assembly, the highest legislative and governing body in Serbia. Mother Ana was the daughter of Petar Nikolajeviƒá Moler, the hero of the First Serbian Uprising. He completed elementary school in Kraljevo and Kru≈°evac and lower grammar school in Kragujevac. He went to Vienna in 1838/39 and initially studied languages and privately graduated from gymnasium. He began his studies in state sciences, the central part of which, according to the cameralistic concept, was represented by economics.He then moved to Heidelberg and completed his \\"philosophical and sociopolitical sciences\\" with Professor Karl Heinrich Rau and earned his Ph.D. [1] He was a member of the first group of Serbian students who went on to study abroad on state bursaries that consisted of Kosta Magazinoviƒá, Dimitrije Matiƒá, Konstantin Nikolajeviƒá, Filip Hristiƒá, Djordje Ceniƒá and Dimitrije Crnobarac. In Heidelberg, he became familiar with the theories of most philosophers and economists of the eighteenth- and nineteenth-century. He managed to complete his three-volume work entitled \\"State Economics\\" where he mentioned the works of the following philosopher- economists: Adam Smith, L√©on Say, John Ramsay McCulloch, Hermann Lotze, Antoine Gustave Droz, Pellegrino Rossi, Louis Auguste Blanqui, Nicolas Fran√ßois Canard, Yves Guyot, and others. After completing his studies, Cukiƒá returned to Serbia in the spring of 1848 and received the professorship at the Belgrade Lyceum of the Principality of Serbia, where he taught Political Economy, Finance, Trade Science and Economic Policy. He immediately became involved in the work of the Serbian Society Of Letters and became its secretary. Since there was no economic textbooks or any similar books written by a Serb at that time (most were translations from German, French, Russian, English, Italian and other economists), Cukiƒá went to work and soon published the first part of his textbook, State Economics, entitled Narodna ekonomija (1851). This was followed by the third part, titled \\"Finance\\" (1853), while the second part, \\"Economic Policy\\", was published only ten years later (1862) when Cukiƒá was already Minister of Finance.

The Henry Gage Mansion was complete in 1810 and is currently located in the city of Bell Gardens, California. Henry Gage Mansion is a historic home that was designated a California Historic Landmark (No. 984) on May 26, 1989. Attorney Henry Tifft Gage was gifted the home in 1880. He, his wife Margaret and the Gage family lived in the home from 1883 to 1924. Henry Gage was voted in as the Governor of California in 1899 and served till 1903. The previous owner of the home was the Lugo family. Francisco Salvador Lugo and his son Antonio Mar√≠a Lugo began construction in 1795 on Casa de Rancho San Antonio on the land called Rancho San Antonio. Antonio Lugo served as the Alcalde (Mayor) of Los Angeles. The house is located at 7000 East Gage Avenue in Bell Gardens. It was built to qualify the younger Lugo, a former Spanish colonial soldier, for a land grant from the Spanish crown. In 1810, Antonio Mar√≠a Lugo completed the house and received the grant, naming his new grant Rancho San Antonio. The ranch eventually grew to encompass , including what are now the cities of Bell Gardens, Commerce, and parts of Bell, Cudahy, Lynwood, Montebello, South Gate, Vernon and East Los Angeles. When California became part of the U.S. in 1850, Lugo, as did all recipients of Spanish/Mexican land grants, began losing portions of his land to the growing population of Anglo newcomers. The ranch adobe, however, continued to be owned and used by the Lugo family. Cal Parks, Henry Gage Mansion, Casa de Rancho San Antonio californiahistoricallandmarks.com, Henry Gage Mansion, Casa de Rancho San Antonio By 1865, most of the Lugo ranch, divided among five sons and three daughters, had been sold off for as little as a dollar per acre. The original adobe ranch home, however, remained in the family. In 1880, Henry Gage, a transplant from Michigan, married one of Lugo's great granddaughters, Francis \\"Fanny\\" Rains. The original adobe ranch home was gifted to Gage as a wedding dowry and it became known as the Gage Mansion. When Gage acquired the mansion he worked very extensively to restore the heritage farmhouse of early Los Angeles. In 1898, Gage was elected to become the 20th governor of California. He served in that office from 1899 to 1903. In 1910, he was appointed by President William Howard Taft to serve as U.S. Minister to Portugal. He resigned after only one year due to his wife's health problems. Gage lived in the abode ranch house until his death in 1924. Bell Gardens maintains only a small portion of the original Lugo land grant, which is located at the site of the Casa Mobile home Park at 7000 Gage Ave. In 1991, the park's tenants, who own the land as well as Lugo's original dwelling, were successful in their efforts to have Casa de San Antonio named State Historical Monument No. 984. Their effort ensures that Don Antonio Maria Lugo's name and his historic home will be preserved for future generations of Bell Gardens residents and Californians. Casa Mobile Home co-op site of Henry Gage Mansion A century later, the Gage Mansion was all that remained of the once great Rancho San Antonio. In 1983 the Casa Mobile Home Park, a cooperative of mobile home owners renting lots on the property, purchased the land and the house from their ailing landlord. Although they were aware of the historical significance of the old house, they had no means of maintaining it. In 1987 Bell Gardens City Councilwoman Letha Viles began working to get the house listed on the state historical registry, making it eligible for maintenance grants.

She is credited with being the only woman recognized as a chief among the Sioux. Eagle Woman's early diplomacy was for peace, while her efforts after the relocations to reservations focused on convincing the Sioux to adapt to the new era and compromise. She materially supported the Sioux when the U.S. government forced tribes to sustain themselves on barren reservation lands. She was in part responsible for the party of leaders sent to sign the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868, though she opposed the Standing Rock treaty of 1876, and became the first woman to sign a treaty with the United States government in 1882. She won a local trade war, when government official attempted to shut down her trading post to establish a monopoly on the reservation, and continued to serve as a mediator and community leader throughout white encroachment on native lands during the Black Hills Gold Rush, including being selected by the U.S. government as part of a delegation to Washington, D.C. in 1872. Eagle Woman and her daughter Louise organized the first day school at Standing Rock Indian Reservation. She continued aiding the tribes in adjusting to reservation life until her death in 1888. In 2010, she was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame.  Early life  Eagle Woman was born in a Sioux lodge near the Missouri River, around south of modern-day Pierre, South Dakota, to a distinguished leader of the \\"peace-seeking\\" Two Kettles Tribe, Chief Two Lance, and Rosy Light of Dawn, a Hunkpapa. She was the youngest of eight children, and her later leadership would be influenced by the example set by her father. She spent her childhood in what would become western South Dakota and had little contact with white culture or government. She was 13 when her father died in 1833, to be buried by the Cheyenne River, and in 1837, her mother died of smallpox after the tribes fled the rivers to escape the disease. In 1838, after her parents' deaths, she married Canadian fur trader Honor√© Picotte, a prestigious general agent in the top position in the Upper Missouri region, with the American Fur Company working at Fort Pierre. It has been claimed that such marriages were mutually beneficial: for Native women, marrying a trader elevated their status (though it is not stated if their status was elevated with the tribe, with the Europeans, or both) with the added benefits of access to goods, while for traders, the marriage improved their trade relations with the Native tribes. Picotte had previously married a woman from another Sioux band in 1829, and then a French woman in 1831, and had children from both marriages. Eagle Woman, while living at the fort, adopted the settlers' lifestyle, but as Picotte often spent long periods of time away, she would return to her tribe. Eagle Woman had two daughters with Picotte, who in 1848 retired and moved back to live with his white wife in St. Louis.  Diplomacy  Charles Galpin in 1856 In 1850, Eagle Woman married Picotte's proteg√© at the company, Charles Galpin, with whom she had two more daughters and three sons, all of whom were given a European education. Eagle Woman \\"frequently spoke out against cruelty of any kind, whether committed by whites or by Indians,\\" and she found opportunity to do so throughout her life. While tensions rose in 1854, the couple established successful trade operations in the area's dwindling post-Civil War economy and resolved multiple conflicts between the settlers and tribes in the area. Though they both acted as translators at times, much of the peacekeeping was based on her prestige and reputation. The family stayed for a time in Fort Benton, Montana beginning in 1860, as Galpin had taken a position with LaBarge, Harkness & Company. There, Eagle Woman's son William died on August 26. The family traveled down river toward their ancestral home for William's burial, eventually contracting to deliver 10 miners to Fort Randall on their way. En route, the couple was surrounded by Santee Sioux who had recently led the Lake Shetek massacre; however, one of the warriors recognized Eagle Woman and allowed them passage after she informed them that she had gifts for the local lodge and was also transporting one of her sons for burial. The Galpins negotiated the release of some of the Santee's captives upon reaching Fort LaFramboise, and a party was dispatched to ransom the two women and four children. In 1865, she protected a wounded white soldier with her shawl, after he had been ambushed and shot with three arrows. In 1866, she began traveling alone to negotiate peace, speaking at Sioux councils along the Little Missouri River. Father Pierre-Jean De Smet sought out Eagle Woman in 1868, as she, \\"being of Sioux birth and a near relation to several war leaders, [exercised] great influence among her people.\\" He had been sent on a mission to request that Sitting Bull move his people to a reservation. The Galpins and De Smet traveled with a party of other Sioux to Sitting Bull's camp. She later recounted that she had to persuade Sitting Bull's people not to kill De Smet, after his delegation's arrival was met with a band of hostile warriors. Though the camp leader did not accept De Smet's request, he sent several other leaders who would go on to sign the Second Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868. This treaty established the Great Sioux Reservation, and thus Eagle Woman's family moved with the tribes to their newly established boundaries, setting up their new trading post at Grand River. For their efforts in facilitating the successful negotiations, Galpin was appointed to the post of agency interpreter, at a salary of $150 monthly. Formerly an advocate for peace, Eagle Woman found a new purpose in helping her people adapt to their new conditions, now that peace had been achieved, albeit temporarily. =Life on the reservation= Eagle Woman's daughters, from left to right, Lulu Picotte Harmon, Annie Galpin, Alma Galpin Parkin, and Louise Picotte DeGrey-Von Solen, c. 1880 The move to the reservation required Galpin to leave his previous employment and become an independent trader, for which he needed a fresh stock of supplies. To this end, the family traveled to St. Louis, where they also sought to retrieve their daughter Lulu who was attending school there. There, De Smet introduced Eagle Woman to William Tecumseh Sherman, who was at the time, leading the very Indian Peace Commission that had just completed the treaty with the Sioux, and was now tasked with implementing it. On the reservation, Eagle Woman set up a trade post and became known for her generosity and dedication to the tribes' independence. She involved her entire family in her efforts. As the government forced the Sioux into farming on barren land, a way of life that was alien and bewildering to these people of the open plains, and with little of the aid promised in the treaty, the Galpins distributed goods for free to the needy. She continued her activism for peace by defusing conflicts in person and alone, and by refusing to trade in firearms or ammunition. As the result of a dispute over the injury of a man for killing one of the cows belonging to the Indian agency, an angry mob of 5,000 gathered at the agency office, threatening the whites inside. Eagle Woman marched to meet the crowd at dawn. She shamed the crowd, telling them they were \\"not brave to come here to kill a half-dozen white men!\\" She contacted the military representative for the reservation, and had him supply provisions for a \\"feast of reconciliation\\", and she distributed gifts to those she knew felt the most slighted. One of the white men Eagle Woman saved on that day was probably Lieutenant William Harmon, who later married her daughter Lulu. Having given her blessing to Harmon and Lulu, Eagle Woman traveled with her daughter by river boat and train to Chicago, to obtain a wedding dress. However, before the ceremony could commence, on November 30, 1869, Charles Galpin fell ill and died. This left Eagle Woman, along with her children, to take over the trade post as the territory's first Sioux businesswoman. She continued her generosity as before. Lulu and Harmon were married on July 26, 1870 in Sioux City, Iowa. Lulu's godfather, de Smet, gave her away at the ceremony. =1872 delegation= In 1872, the U.S. government chose Eagle Woman to select a delegation of leaders, bring them to Washington, D.C., and interpret for them. They traveled by river to Sioux City, and then by train through Chicago, arriving in Washington on September 15. The trip was ostensibly to discuss the Treaty of Fort Laramie. In actuality, it was \\"to impress the Sioux with the power, size and sheer material achievements of white society.\\" To this end, the delegation spent much of their two weeks in the city touring the local arsenal and naval yard. They also met with Sherman, Columbus Delano, then Secretary of the Interior, as well as President Ulysses S. Grant. They skipped a planned tour of Boston, and after a boat tour of Manhattan, returned home by the end of October. =Trade disputes= In 1873, the agency at Grand River was moved to Standing Rock on account of flooding, and Eagle Woman followed, setting up her new trading post there. The following year, the government revoked the sutlership for traders throughout the area of the Sioux reservation, preferring instead a monopoly for Orvil L. Grant, brother of President Grant. This included the permission under which Eagle Woman's son-in-law Harmon was trading. Once established, Grant and his business partners \\"applied every force at its command to put Eagle Woman out of business,\\" but she proved \\"utterly unflappable\\". Suspecting that Eagle Woman's store was serving as a front for Harmon's goods (Harmon had in-fact sold his excess goods to Eagle Woman after he was driven out of business), the local commissioner sought to put an end to her trade, but was prevented by a local uprising over the deaths of two white soldiers. Eagle Woman herself helped to mediate this dispute that had delayed the shuttering of her own store, and Harmon wrote on her behalf to congressman John T. Averill. Again pressed to close her business, the local Indian agent replied that he had ordered Eagle Woman to comply, but she \\"declines to obey on the grounds that she is an Indian and entitled to trade with her people in order to support her family.\\" The agent was replaced on account of his failure, and Eagle Woman ignored commands from the replacement as well. The commander of Fort Yates, when ordered to close her store, refused, and the local US Marshall, ordered to confiscate her goods, did the same. Within a matter of months, the association of political power in Washington, who had conspired against Eagle Woman in favor of Grant and associates, began to collapse, and the campaign against Eagle Woman was abandoned. By 1876, Eagle Woman had turned the Indian agent into an ally, and had coordinated with him to establish the first Catholic day school in the area, with books and supplies provided for the students, and her own daughter Louise hired as instructor. = Black Hills Gold Rush = The Black Hills Gold Rush began in 1874 as word spread of the discovery of gold in lands owned by the Sioux, including the Black Hills, according to the terms of the Treaty of Fort Laramie six years prior. This quickly lead to violations of the treaty on the part of thousands of miners immigrating to the area, and subsequent increases in violent conflicts. During this period, Eagle Woman continued her mediation efforts and material generosity to her people. In a conference in 1875, she led the Grand River delegation, most of whom were unarmed. She, along with Hunkpapa leaders and thousands of Lakota warriors, including Red Cloud and Spotted Tail, met with the Indian commissioners backed by a hundred cavalry. The meeting accomplished nothing, and negotiations broke down on the verge of violence, which Eagle Woman helped to mediate and avoid. Elsewhere among the attendees were a band of \\"roamers\\", from the unceded territory of the Sioux, along with two bands of police from Standing Rock, one led by Young Man Afraid of His Horses, and the other led by friends of Eagle Woman. When the roamers became unruly, \\"singing defiance and brandishing their weapons\\", the police force moved to separate them from the federal troops, and to form a protective ring around the commissioners. Following the meeting, Eagle Woman was recognized as a chief \\"for her heroism in saving the lives of the Black Hills commission\\". Lakota historian LaDonna Brave Bull Allard credits her as \\"the only female Sioux chief\\". Signature of Eagle Woman as recorded in a transcript of the 1882 Standing Rock treaty, as compiled by the Secretary of the Interior As the Great Sioux War of 1876 began over the continued violation of Sioux ownership of the Black Hills, Eagle Woman did not take part in negotiations following the failed attempt of 1875. She did not support the \\"Sell or Starve\\" policies and the Act of 1877, which resolved to cut off all government rations to the Sioux until they agreed to peacefully cede the Black Hills. This came to pass in the signing of treaties in October, which led to the creation of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation. After the loss, she again took up her role of helping the tribes adapt to this new reservation life. Though Eagle Woman opposed the founding of the reservation and did not sign the 1876 treaty, she signed an 1882 treaty which reserved land for schools, modified reservation boundaries, and changed the government workers and rations they received. Her assent was recorded at the Standing Rock Agency, November 30, 1882, \\"Matilda Galpin, her x mark. Seal\\" as the only woman to sign among the chiefs and headmen of the Sioux, making her the first woman to sign a treaty with the United States.  Later life and death  Eagle Woman spent her final years at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation with friends, her daughters, and grandchildren. She met briefly with Sitting Bull in 1881 after his surrender, as he passed through Fort Yates on his way to internment as a prisoner of war at Fort Randall. She wrote to her stepson, Charles Picotte, at Yankton Agency to look after Sitting Bull. On December 18, 1888, Eagle Woman died at her daughter Alma's home, the Cannonball Ranch in modern-day Morton County, North Dakota. Though none of her sons had made it to adulthood, she died surrounded by her daughters. Eagle Woman was buried next to Galpin at the Fort Yates cemetery. No announcement of her death has been found in the papers of the time. In the mid-20th century her remains were relocated by the Army Corps of Engineers as part of the construction of Lake Oahe. Alma continued her generosity to white and Native people alike in the area, and Alma's own funeral was attended by over a thousand people.  Legacy  Eagle Woman was inducted into the South Dakota Hall of Fame as a Champion of Excellence in 2010, for her \\"attempts at peaceful compromise\\" between \\"Native American Indian and white societies\\". The Bismarck Tribune called her the most noted Indian woman of all the western Indian nations,' next to Sakakawea.\\" In 2016, the location of her former grave site was one of several disputed as part of the Dakota Access Pipeline protests.

He holds the Chair of Modern and Contemporary History at the University of Jena, Germany, and leads the Jena Center of 20th Century History. Frei's research work investigates how German society came to terms with Nazism and the Third Reich in the aftermath of World War II. History From 1973 to 1978 Frei studied Modern History, Political and Communication Sciences in Munich, where he also completed an editorial training at the German School of Journalism. In 1979, he received his doctorate with a thesis on the \\"National Socialist conquest of the provincial press\\". Between 1979 and 1997 he worked as a research assistant at the Institute of Contemporary History in Munich. While there, from 1987 he worked as an editorial member of the quarterly periodicals for contemporary history and was editor of the series of quarterly issues. He was at Harvard University in 1985 and 1986, on a John F. Kennedy Fellowship. After his time at the University of Bielefeld in 1996 he wrote a highly regarded study on the policies of the Adenauer era, in book form titled , \\"Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration\\". Frei joined the Ruhr University Bochum in 1997. For the summer semester 2005 he moved to the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. For the years 1995 and 1996 he was a Freelance Fellow at the Berlin Institute for Advanced Study. For the years 2008 and 2009 he was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. In the academic year 2010/2011, he taught as Theodor Heuss Professor at New School for Social Research in New York. In the summer semester 2013, he held a visiting professorship at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. In the summer semester of 2019 he is Gerda Henkel Visiting Professor in The Department of German Studies, Stanford University. Frei is a member of numerous scientific advisory boards and commissions. From 1996 to 2003 and again since 2018 he worked on the Scientific Advisory Board of the Fritz Bauer Institute in Frankfurt. Since 1999 he is Chairman of the Scientific Board of Trustees of the Buchenwald and Mittelbau-Dora Memorials Foundation. From 2000 to 2016 Frei was a member of the Scientific Advisory Board of the Institute for German History at the University of Tel Aviv. From 2005 to 2017, he was chairman of the Scientific Advisory Council of the Koebner Minerva Center for German History at Hebrew University Jerusalem. From 1999 to 2002 he was a member of the Independent Historical Commission for the Study of the History of Bertelsmann in the \\"Third Reich\\". In 2011 Frei was elected as a full member of the Saxon Academy of Sciences and Humanities in Leipzig. Longer-term research projects at his chair concerned the practice of reparation in Germany and Israel since 1952 and the history of the Flick Group in the Third Reich, both completed in 2009. In 2005, German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer appointed Frei to the Independent Commission of Historians - Foreign Office, which thoroughly examined the history of the Foreign Service in National Socialism and its handling of this past after 1945. In October 2010, the Commission published its findings as a book entitled The Office and the Past, followed by a controversial discussion Larger ongoing research projects concern the history of political education in the Federal Republic and the experience of the long transformation in East Germany (1970-2010). Since 2012 Frei has led the interdisciplinary working group \\"Human Rights in the 20th Century\\" of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, which also runs the website \\"Sources on the History of Human Rights\\". Frei participated in numerous contemporary-historical debates and endeavors to convey scientific findings to a broader public. Since 2016, he has written a column in the S√ºddeutsche Zeitung, a national daily newspaper. Controversy In his 2000 book Standort-und Kommandanturbefehle des Konzentrationslagers Auschwitz 1940‚Äì1945 (Auschwitz 1940-1945 Concentration Camp Commands and Command Orders), Frei published a collection of documents from eastern European archives. In 2015, right-wing extremists and Holocaust deniers such as Ursula Haverbeck and Hans P√ºschel cherry-picked information from the book in order to argue that The Holocaust did not take place. In a 2015 television interview on the mainstream German ARD channel, Frei explained that the book contains a wealth of information about Auschwitz concentration camp and also Birkenau. Myth of the clean Wehrmacht In 1997 he investigated how the myth of the clean Wehrmacht was created through the official policies of the West German government led by Konrad Adenauer. His book was called Vergangenheitspolitik: Die Anf√§nge der Bundesrepublik und die NS-Vergangenheit, or, in English, Adenauer's Germany and the Nazi Past: The Politics of Amnesty and Integration. Frei wrote that the widespread demand for the freedom of Nazi war criminals in the aftermath of World War II was an indirect admission of the entire German society's enmeshment in Nazism. He added the war crimes trials were a painful reminder of the nature of the Third Reich that many ordinary people had identified with. In this context, there was an overwhelming demand for the rehabilitation of the Wehrmacht. Works ;Monographs * with Franka Maubach, Christina Morina und Maik T√§ndler: Zur rechten Zeit.

It consisted of a large mole, which was identified in the fifth century BC ancient Greek historian Herodotus as one of three greatest feats of engineering in the Greek world.Herodotus, Histories 3.60 Large parts of the ancient mole seem to survive, partially incorporated into the modern mole, but these remains are very difficult to date. History The island of Samos became one of the major naval powers in the Aegean in the sixth century BC, culminating in the reign of the tyrant Polycrates. In the fifth century, Herodotus reports a mole surrounded the harbour, with a length of more than two stades out to sea (over 400 metres), and reached a depth of twenty orguia (c. 20 metres). The island's political power declined in the fifth century BC. However, the harbour continued to be a major naval base and an important economic hub, especially under Ptolemaic rule during the Hellenistic period and in the Roman imperial period. It was seriously damaged by an earthquake in AD 262. The modern mole of Pythagoreio was built in the 19th century.Simossi (1991), 281-2 Description Pythagoreio has a large natural harbour, but it is very open to the south, so the fierce northerly winds pose a threat to shipping in port. The ancient mole extended due east from the western edge of the harbour, in order to shelter the harbour from these winds.Simossi (1991), 289 The remains of a stone structure are submerged to the south of the modern mole of the harbour, running parallel to it and partially incorporated into it. Archaeological research has revealed a mole that is long. At its eastern end, the mole upper surface of the structure is below the surface and it continues down below the modern sea bed to a depth of at least below sea level. A number of loose architectural components have been recovered, including two ashlar blocks and a column drum.Simossi (1991), 283 & 294 The structure was repeatedly damaged by storms and earthquakes in antiquity and repaired by piling new stones on top of the old ones, making it very difficult to date. Pottery remains recovered in the foundations of the mole mostly date to the Roman imperial period, with the earliest material dating to c. 300 BC. The excavator, Angeliki Simossi thus dated the surviving structure to the early Hellenistic period, making it later and larger than that described by Herodotus. She suggested that the structure known to Herodotus might be underneath the surviving remains, perhaps in the northern section which is covered by the modern harbour mole.Simossi (1991), 287-291 Subsequent excavations suggested that some of this structure might be part of the 19th century construction work,Blackman (1998-99), 105 but it overlies a Byzantine sea wall, which itself overlies an ancient rubble mole. Further traces of an ancient rubble mole have been found on the east side of the modern mole, but very little could be discerned about it.Blackman (1999-2000), 122 Excavations In 1988, the modern breakwater of Pythagoreio collapsed and signs of the ancient mole were discovered in the course of repair work. An underwater excavation was undertaken from 8 September-14 October 1988 by a team of eleven divers from the Ephorate of Underwater Antiquities under the direction of Angeliki Simossi.Simossi (1991), 282 & 292 Further excavations were undertaken by Simossi from 1992-1996 and substantial additional pottery remains were recovered during harbour works in 2009.Blackman (1998-99), 105; (1999-2000), 122; (2000-01), 121; Morgan et al.
