It aims to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Latin words for Chemistry are derived from the ancient word kimia. The meaning of Kimia, in the Persian literature refers to what is behind the ‘materialistic’ conception of alchemy, and instead to the secret of the spirit’s action in nature and the Universe, the macro-cosmos. By acquiring this divine wisdom of action, alchemists aspired to discover their inner (microcosmic) reality, and transmute themselves. Corbin, 1986, pp. 71-87, 196-208; Nasr, chapter 9 The word appears ubiquitously in Persian literature. Some early usages can be seen in Vis and Ramin and Ferdowsi’s Shahnameh. Other samples in verse and prose are: _“The alchemy of happiness is what counts in life, Told Kasra his minister Bozorgmehr”_ —-Naser Khosrow _“A hundred thousand alchemies created by The Truth Yet no alchemy like patience is known to Man”_ ——Rumi The word Kimia has been frequently been used in other Persian poetry, including those of Hafez Shirazi: از کیمیای مهر تو زر گشت روی من آری به یمن لطف شما خاک زر شود \\"By your love’s alchemy, my face became bright gold Thanks to your grace, the dust can become gold.\\" or آنان که خاک را به نظر کیمیا کنند آیا بود که گوشه چشمی به ما کنند \\"Those whose glance turns lead into gold, Will they ever our sight behold?\\" Notable persons * Kimia Alizadeh (born 1998), Iranian Olympian athlete and taekwondo player *Kimia Hosseini (born 2003), Iranian actress References ","title":"Kimia"},{"id":"58406442","text":"Anahí Ballent (born 1956) is an Argentine architect whose research focuses on human habitation in Argentina.

His victims were women under the age of 28, whom he raped and murdered, stealing their valuables afterwards. The case of the Lipetsk killer acquired great public resonance, and for his capture a reward of 100 thousand rubles and a car were promised. Sedykh was repeatedly detained by police officers, but due to lack of any evidence against him, he was released. The last murder Sedykh committed was in 2003. He did not kill anybody after that, but continued to keep the victims' belongings in his garage. In 2008, a relative accidentally found a mobile phone from one of the victims and turned it on, which made it possible to trace his whereabouts. On June 4, 2008, Sedykh was detained, and the above-mentioned material evidence was found in the garage. In addition, there was a VAZ-2106, a car which had been seen by some of the witnesses. After two genetic examinations, Sedykh confessed to all the crimes. On April 19, 2010, the Lipetsk Regional Court sentenced Sedykh to life imprisonment. The punishment was to be served in the \\"Black Berkut\\" colony in the Sverdlovsk Oblast. In September 2013, the media reported that the convict had committed suicide by hanging himself in a colony cell, but the regional UFSIN disproved this information the following day.

John Newman, in his Monmouthshire Pevsner, describes it as a \\"perfect Monmouthshire farmhouse\\". Ton is a Grade II* listed building, its listing noting that it is a \\"remarkably good survival\\" of a prosperous 17th century Welsh farmhouse. History and description Sir Joseph Bradney records the site of the farmhouse as Ton-y-beddau, which he translates as \\"the glade of the graves\\" and refers to a \\"vague tradition of a battle and the burying of corpses\\". His multi-volume study, A History of Monmouthshire from the Coming of the Normans into Wales down to the Present Time, also provides a lengthy pedigree of the owners of the surrounding lands. Cadw dates the construction of Ton Farm to the early 17th century. The farmhouse was \\"greatly enlarged\\" in 1663, with an inscribed datestone recording the date. In the 1895 Monmouthshire edition of Kelly's Directory, the farm is noted as being under the management of John Griffiths, farmer. Ton remains a privately-owned house and is a Grade II* listed building. The architectural historian John Newman describes it as a \\"perfect Monmouthshire farmhouse\\". The farm is of two- storeys, built in whitewashed old red sandstone rubble. The roofs are of Welsh slate. Most of the windows were replaced in the 19th century but the house has been \\"little altered\\" since this date. Sir Cyril Fox and Lord Raglan include a plan of Ton in the third volume, Renaissance Houses, c. 1590–1714, of their three-volume study of the vernacular architecture of the county, Monmouthshire Houses. Their plan shows the three-room ground-floor layout of the house after the 1663 alterations, with the hall and parlour divided by a cross-passage, and a pantry to the rear of the hall. The plan includes illustrations of the elaborate joinery in the parlour, a feature also noted by Cadw.

Etymology Historically the native speaker of Sadri/Nagpuri language are known as Sadan. Sadan means non-tribal Indo-Aryan language speaker who traditionally speak Nagpuri, Khortha, Panchpargania and Kurmali. The Nagpuri as a linguistic and cultural identity is perhaps origin of early modern period. The known use of name Nagpuri was first used by king Medini Ray for Nagvanshi king Raghunath Shah. The name \\"Nagpuri\\" has been propagated by poets and writers. In recent years the native speaker of Sadri/Nagpuri language are known as Nagpuri in western study.  History  = Prehistoric era = Stone tools, microliths discovered from Chota Nagpur plateau region which are from Mesolithic and Neolithic period. During Neolithic period, agriculture started in South Asia. Several neolithic settlements have found in sites such as Jhusi, Lahuradewa, Mehergarh, Bhirrana, Rakhigarhi, Koldihwa, Chopani Mando and Chirand. At the confluence of Son and North Koel river in Kabra-Kala mound in Palamu district various antiquities, coins and art objects have been found which are from Neolithic to Medieval period and the pot-sherds of Redware, black and red ware, black ware, black slipped ware and NBP ware are from Chalcolithic to late medieval period. During the 2nd millennium BC, the use of Cooper tools had spread in the Chotanagpur plateau region and these find- complexes known as Copper Hoard Culture.Paul Yule, Addenda to \\"The Copper Hoards of the Indian Subcontinent: Preliminaries for an Interpretation\\", Man and Environment 26.2, 2002, 117–120 http://archiv.ub.uni- heidelberg.de/savifadok/volltexte/2009/510/. = Ancient history = The use of Iron tools and pottery had spread in Chotanagpur plateau region during 1400 BCE according to carbon dating of Iron slag and pottery which have found in Singhbhum district. During the Vedic period, several janapadas emerged in northern India. Parts of western India was dominated by tribes who had a slightly different culture, considered non-Vedic by the mainstream Vedic culture prevailing in the Kuru and Panchala kingdoms. Similarly, there were some tribes in the eastern regions of India considered to be in this category. There were many kingdom existing in the north such as Madra, Salva and in the east such as Kikata, Nishadas who were not following Vedic religion. Around –1000 BCE, Vedic Aryans spread eastward to the fertile western Ganges Plain and adopted iron tools which allowed for clearing of forest and the adoption of a more settled, agricultural way of life. During this time, the central Ganges Plain dominated by a related but non-Vedic Indo-Aryan culture. The end of the Vedic period witnessed the rise of cities and large states (called mahajanapadas) as well as śramaṇa movements (including Jainism and Buddhism) which challenged the Vedic orthodoxy. According to Bronkhorst, the sramana culture arose in greater Magadha, which was Indo-European, but not Vedic. In this culture, Kshatriyas were placed higher than Brahmins, and it rejected Vedic authority and rituals. These Sramana religions did not worship the Vedic deities, practiced some form of asceticism and meditation (jhana) and tended to construct round burial mounds (called stupas in Buddhism).Bronkorst, J; Greater Magadha: Studies in the Culture of Early India (2007), p. 3 Some parts of Nagpuri speaking region was part of Magadha Mahajanpada. Magadha and other Mahajanapadas in the Post Vedic period In Mauryan period, this region ruled by a number of states, which were collectively known as the Atavika (forest) states. These states accepted the suzerainty of the Maurya empire during Ashoka's reign (c. 232 BCE). Samudragupta, while marching through the present- day Chotanagpur region, directed the attack against the kingdom of Dakshina Kosala in the Mahanadi valley. Gupta Empire = Early modern period (c. 1526 - c. 1858) = During medivial period Nagvanshi and Chero were ruling this region. During region of Akbar, the Mughal invaded Khukhragarh, then Nagvanshi rulers became vassal of Mughals. Nagvanshi were independent during weak Mughal rule. After the Battle of Plassey, the region comes under influence of East India Company. Chero and Nagvanshi ruler then became tributaries to East India company. Navratangarh fort Bakhtar Say and Mundal Singh, two landowners from Gumla, fought against the British East India company in 1812 against tax imposition on farmers. British hanged them in Kolkata. The other princely states in Chota Nagpur Plateau, came within the sphere of influence of the Maratha Empire, but they became tributary States of East India Company as a result of the Anglo-Maratha Wars known as Chota Nagpur Tributary States.http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.100009/231191 =Modern Period (after c. 1850 CE)= The brothers Nilamber and Pitamber were chiefs of Bhogta clan of the Kharwar tribe, who held ancestral jagirs led the revolt against British East India company in 1857. Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo and Pandey Ganpat Rai led rebels against British East India Company in 1857 rebellion.Tikait Umrao Singh, Sheikh Bhikhari, Nadir Ali, Jai Mangal Singh played pivotal role in Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Language Nagpuri language/dialect is native to western and central Chota Nagpur plateau region. It is sometimes considered hindi dialect. Nagpuri belongs to Bihari group of Indo-Aryan languages. According to professor Keshri Kumar Singh, Nagpuri is descendant of Magadhi Prakrit. According to Dr. Sravan Kumar Goswami, Nagpuri had evolved from Ardhamagadhi Prakrit. Its literary tradition started around the 17th century. It was lingua-franca in the region.Brass Paul R., The Politics of India Since Independence, Cambridge University Press, pp. 183 The Nagvanshi king Raghunath Shah and King of Ramgarh, Dalel Singh were poet. Hanuman Singh, Jaigovind Mishra, Barju Ram, Ghasiram Mahli and Das Mahli were prominent peot. \\"Nagvanshavali\\" written by Beniram Mehta is a historical work in Nagpuri language. Great poet Ghasiram Mahli had written several works including Nag Vanshavali, Durga Saptasati, Barahamasa, Vivha Parichhan etc. There were also great writer like Pradumn Das and Rudra Singh.  Culture  =Music and dance= The Nagpuri people have their own styles of dance. Some Nagpuri folk dance are Jhumair, Mardani Jhumair, Janani Jhumair, Domkach, Lahasua, Angnai, faguwa, sanjhi, adhratiya, bhinsariya, Painki etc. Painki is ceremonial martial folk dance performed in marriage and functions. The musical instruments used in folk music and dance are Dhol, Mandar, Bansi, Nagara, Dhak, Shehnai, Khartal, Narsinga etc. Akhra is important part of Nagpuri culture which is village ground where people dance. =Festival= Karam and Jitia are major festival celebrated among Nagpuri people. Other major festival are Asari, Nawakhani, Sohrai, Fagun etc. Sarna is a place of Sacred grove where village deity resides according to traditional belief, the offering to gaon Khut/gram deoti takes place twice a year before sowing of seeds and harvesting crops for good harvest. =Traditional dress= The traditional dress among males are Gamchha, Dhoti and among females are red bordered or yellow Sari and Lehenga. The ornaments are Lola(earrings) among males and Chudi(bangle), Lola(earrings), Bichhiya(toe ring), Paynri(anklet), Kangna(bracelet), Hansli(necklace), bandhna among females. Tattoo is prominent among both males and females which is known as Godna. =Marriage tradition= Nagpuri marriage is unique. Prior to marriage, the boy’s relatives go to girl’s home to see and negotiate for marriage and token amount is paid by the boy’s family to the girl’s family as part of the marriage expenses called damgani. The process of marriage starts with giving of Sari by boy's family to girl's family. Damgani, panbandhi, matikoran (worship of gramadevata), madwa and dalhardi, nahchhur, amba biha, painkotan, baraat, pairghani, sindoor dan (Vermilion giving), harin marek (hunting deer), chuman (giving gifts), etc are the activities and rituals of marriage accompanied by music of Nagara, Dhak and Shehnai played by traditionally musicians of Ghasi community. There are different songs for different marriage rituals. Domkach, Pairghani(welcome ceremony) dance performed during marriage. Wedding performed by thakur/Nai (barber) and the village priest called pahan in matikoran. Traditionally nagpuri wedding conducted without a Brahmin priest. Post marriage activity are bahurat (going of bride's family to groom house to bring back bride and groom to bride's home) and playing beng pani (frog water). =Religion= The deities reverence in nagpuri tradition are Suraj(Solar deity), Chand(lunar deity). People reverence ancestors Mata and Pita. Other deities are Gram deoti(village deity), Bar Pahari(hill deity) and Gaurea(Cattle deity) etc. The people worship these deities at home themselves during festivals. In home, rituals performed by head of family and in community festival the rituals performed by village priest \\"Pahan\\" and his assistant \\"Pujar\\". It appears that nagpuri religious tradition is based on local folk tradition and of non-vedic and non-brahminical Indo European origin. The Vedic religion and Brahmanism influence reached in the region after arrival of Brahmin perhaps during rule of Maurya Empire. The Nagvanshi rulers constructed several temples during their reign and invited Brahmin from different parts of the country for priestly duty.

Biography George originated from the Zala branch of the extended gens (clan) Péc, which had large-scale possessions in several counties of Transdanubia, in addition to other parts of the Kingdom of Hungary. His father was Lucas, a staunch supporter of King Andrew II of Hungary,Engel: Genealógia (Genus Péc 1. Zala branch) who presumably served as Master of the cupbearers in the royal court from 1229 to 1230 and also held various ispánates. George had two brothers: Mark I and Lucas II (also known as Lucas the Great). George had three sons from his unidentified marriage; Denis was an influential baron and skilled military leader during the second half of the 13th century, while Serfesd and Peter, who were referred with the surname Nevnai and Ludbregi after their residence, present-day Levanjska Varoš and Ludbreg, respectively, remained landowners among the local nobility along the Drava River. George's branch became extinct after two generations. George is first referred by contemporary records in 1232, when he appears as a witness in the so-called Kehida Diploma. The lawsuit between baron Atyusz III Atyusz and royal servants in Zala County, and its consequences proved to be the first milestone towards the noble self-determination. George possessed large-scale landholdings and estates in the northwest corner of Slavonia, the borderland of Zala, Varaždin (Varasd) and Križevci (Kőrös) counties. He was a confidant of Béla IV of Hungary. He served as ispán of Zala County from 1243 to 1244. His deputy (\\"curialis comes\\") was a certain Ezen in 1244. For his service, George was granted Ludbreg sometimes before 1248, as Béla IV referred to him \\"neighbor lord\\" during an act of land donation near Koprivnica. Ludbreg later became a residence of his son Peter, who erected a castle above the village and adopted his surname after his lands' centre. This branch died out with George's grandson Nicholas Ludbregi in 1357, thereafter Ludbreg and other lands became the property of Ban John Csúz and his descendants. It is presumable that George functioned as ispán of Križevci (or Kőrös) County from around 1252 to 1253. George filed a lawsuit for the ownership of Tursoy, an island on the Drava river, in 1256. His efforts failed, the land was granted to the hospes (foreign \\"guest settlers\\") of Varaždin. This is the last piece of information about him. His son Denis entered political career in the same year.

The ship has been a floating restaurant since 1989. It is docked in Mariehamn, capital of the Finnish province of Åland. The ship was originally named after the beurtvaart captain Jan Nieveen, who transported goods and passengers from the city of Groningen to Lemmer. Spanvis: 'Jan Nieveen en de tramboten Lemmer- Amsterdam'  Construction  The steamboat Jan Nieveen was built in 1928 at the Arnhemsche Scheepsbouw Maatschappij shipyard in Arnhem, the Netherlands, at a then-high price of 140,000 Dutch guilders. It was ordered by the Groninger & Lemmer Stoomboot Maatschappij, a shipping line which had been founded in 1870 by the brothers Reint, Jan and Geert Nieveen. The ship was designed with the maximum size that could pass through the locks of Lemmer when fully loaded. It entered service as a scheduled passenger and freight beurtvaart connection on the Zuiderzee between Lemmer and Amsterdam. Jan Nieveen had four sister ships, and was the flagship of the fleet. The shipping line was successful during the 1930s, but later declined. The Jan Nieveen was then used for recreational trips along the coast and to the islands of Schokland and Urk. Spanvis: Jan Nieveen en de tramboten Lemmer-Amsterdam (2)  Second World War  During the Second World War, the ship transported food from the northern Dutch provinces to Holland (in exchange for gold and silver) and horses, in accordance with the German occupiers. Jews, in hiding, were smuggled on the lower deck to the relative freedom of the north-eastern Netherlands. Spanvis: Jan Nieveen en de tramboten Lemmer-Amsterdam (3), quoting Nieuwsblad van het Noorden. = Collision = During the night of 7-8 January 1945 (during the Dutch famine of 1944–45), the ship was involved in a collision near Urk with its sister ship Groningen IV from the same company. Fourteen passengers and crew on the Groningen IV drowned when the ship sank, trapped when the collision blocked the door. Spanvis: Jan Nieveen en de tramboten Lemmer-Amsterdam (4) According to German regulations, the lights on both ships were dimmed except for small navigation lights. NRC: 'Spring meisje!' De Lemmerbootramp The Jan Nieveen was only slightly damaged.  Post- war makeovers and renamings  The ship's original name, Jan Nieveen, is still visible. In 1951, the Jan Nieveen heavy steam engine was replaced by a lighter diesel engine with almost the same power. Spanvis: Jan Nieveen en de tramboten Lemmer-Amsterdam (5) The draught of the vessel diminished by . An October 1953 merger of three beurtvaart companies created a fleet of 34 ships, managed by the J.H. van Swieten company. Jan Nieveen and its sister ship, Harm Nieveen', were the showpieces of the fleet. Increasing competition from road transport ended the beurtvaart era, and the Lemmer–Amsterdam route was discontinued in 1959. In 1958, the ship was sold and underwent several modifications. It was a tourist boat in Rotterdam as the IJsselhaven from 1961 to 1974, and did the same for two seasons in Biesbosch National Park as the Wolga. In 1977, the Nieveen family bought back the ship and renamed it Jan Nieveen. Its home port was Lemmer, from which it made day trips to harbours around the IJsselmeer.

The ship was renamed F.P. von Knorring after Frans Peter von Knorring (1792–1875), a vicar, teacher and founder of Åland's first schools and the islands' first newspaper. The restaurant was transferred to Kim and Karin Harju-Jeanty in 2002, and was still in operation in January 2019.

He is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Queen Mary University of London, a television and radio presenter and a curator. He writes about literature, history, material culture, trade, and east-west relations, particularly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. He employs interdisciplinary approaches, looking at art, politics, history, travel writing and literature. His book A History of the World in Twelve Maps (Allen Lane, 2012) has been translated into twelve languages. It was accompanied by a three-part series on BBC Four, Maps: Power, Plunder and Possession. His The Sale of the Late King's Goods: Charles I and His Art Collection (Macmillan, 2006) was nominated for the Samuel Johnson Prize (now the Baillie Gifford Prize). It wryly proposes that the dispersal of Charles I's art collection in 1649 was a democratic move, one that merits imitation in the contemporary world. His 2016 book This Orient Isle: Elizabethan England and the Islamic World (London: Allen Lane, 2016) was serialised on BBC Radio 4 and won the Historical Writers Association Non-Fiction Crown (2017). He collaborated as a curator and commentator with the artist and director of Factum Arte, Adam Lowe, in the exhibit Penelope’s Labour: Weaving Words and Images, at the Venice Biennale in 2011, and in 2019 he and map librarian Nick Millea co-curated the exhibition Talking Maps at the Bodleian Library in Oxford. He has written and presented various radio programmes for BBC Radio 3, BBC Radio 4 and the BBC World Service on historical subjects including Shakespeare, the history of the ghetto, and El Dorado.

Since 2008, the team has played an annual fixture against the Queensland Under-16s team as a curtain raiser to a State of Origin game. The team features players selected from New South Wales's premier under-16 rugby league competition, the Harold Matthews Cup and Andrew Johns Cup. They are administered by the New South Wales Rugby League.  History  Prior to 2008, junior interstate matches were contested at under-17 and under-19 levels. In 2008, with the advent of the National Youth Competition, the age levels switched to an under-16 and under-18 format to keep in line with the NSWRL's existing S.G. Ball Cup and Harold Matthews Cup competitions and the QRL's Mal Meninga Cup and Cyril Connell Cup competitions, which would begin in 2009. New South Wales saw success in the first under-16 Origin fixture in 2008. They recorded their first defeat a year later, losing 30-10 in 2009 at Etihad Stadium. From 2010 to 2013, New South Wales would win four games consecutively before losing both fixtures against Queensland in 2014 and 2015. Since 2015 New South Wales have won every under-16 Origin fixture, in 2016, 2017 and 2018.  Players  Players selected for the New South Wales under-16 team are usually contracted with a National Rugby League (NRL) side and, until 2017, played in the Harold Matthews Cup. Occasionally players who are contracted to Queensland-based NRL sides, who play in the Cyril Connell Cup, are selected. Each pre-season the New South Wales Rugby League will select an under-16 squad featuring players in contention for the mid-season fixture.

The precise role of these ATPases is not known, but they are usually predicted to either function as part of an ATP-binding cassette transporter or as fungal elongation factor 3. In some cases, the ATPase genes downstream of uup RNAs seem to be transcribed as part of a larger operon. In a handful of these cases, one of the operon's genes encodes the DUF2992 conserved protein domain. This gene is, in turn, regulated by the yjdF RNA motif, which might function to sense azaaromatic compounds. uup RNAs are usually located 100 nucleotides upstream of predicted Rho-independent transcription terminators. Since these transcription terminators are located somewhat far away, it is not clear that they are functionally related. If uup RNAs do function as cis-regulatory elements, they might inhibit the formation of the transcription terminator's secondary structure in order to control the expression of the downstream gene. The hypothesis that uup RNAs correspond to riboswitches has been considered. These RNAs exhibit several highly conserved nucleotide positions, despite a wide distribution in two bacteria phyla. However, the secondary structure of these RNAs was considered unusually simple compared to most (but not all) known riboswitch structures.

Among his main scientific achievements, one can mention: (i) new approaches to control the magnetic behavior of materials at the sub-micrometer scale by non-magnetic means, i.e., taking advantage of local mechanical strain, ion irradiation/implantation or electric field (magneto-electrics), (ii) the discovery of a novel magnetization reversal mechanism called “exchange biased vortex” in circular magnetic structures with applications in magnetic data storage and spin- valves, (iii) the enhancement of the mechanical, magnetic and catalytic properties of environmentally-sustainable nanoporous materials for energy efficiency applications. Sort received his PhD degree in materials science from UAB in 2002 (with qualification excellent cum laude, extraordinary award from UAB). The topic of his PhD dissertation was the improvement of the magnetic properties of permanent magnetic materials taking advantage of interfacial exchange interactions in mixed ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic nanocomposites. During his postdoctoral stay at the SPINTEC Laboratory (Grenoble, France), from 2002 to 2004, he developed magnetic multilayered systems with perpendicular anisotropy for spin valves and magnetic tunneling spintronic applications. He subsequently stayed at Argonne National Laboratory (USA) (2005-2006), where he specialized in nanomagnetism and studied the so- called 'exchange biased magnetic vortices'. He also performed secondments at Los Alamos National Laboratory (USA) and the Grenoble High Magnetic Fields Laboratory (France). Sort has published more than 270 articles in peer- reviewed scientific journals that have received approximately 6600 citations (h = 39).ISI Web of Science, Thompson-Reuters, September 2018 He has issued 5 patents, has been personally invited in more than 70 international conferences and has managed more than 25 national/international research projects. He is the recipient of a Consolidator Grant from the European Research Council (SPIN-PORICS) and the Coordinator of the SELECTA Marie Sklodowska-Curie Innovative Training Network (ITN-ETN) from the European Commission (Horizon2020). His current research aims at integrating engineered nanoporous materials into novel spintronic applications as well as replacing hazardous or toxic compositions in miniaturized devices and coatings with innovative environmentally-friendly materials. From an academic point of view, Sort is actively involved in teaching, participating in different subjects from the physics and nanoscience degrees, the Master of Materials Science and Technology at UAB (which he coordinated during the period 2009–2011) and the Master of Nanotechnology and Materials Science. He was also the coordinator of the doctorate program in materials science at UAB during the period 2011–2014.  Prizes and Awards  Sort has received the Jordi Porta i Jué's Prize awarded by the Catalan Physical Society (2000), the Young Researcher Award in Experimental Physics by the Spanish Royal Physical Society (2003) and, more recently, the Materials Science & Technology Prize from the Federation of European Materials Societies (FEMS) (2015). He also received the Extraordinary Award for his PhD Dissertation at UAB and was awarded the Young Scientific Prize at the ISMANAM Conference in Paris in 2005.

It is likely that the crosses represent a development from the inscribed stones but nothing is certain about the dating of them. In the late Middle Ages it is likely that their erection was very common. Since they occur in locations of various types, e.g. by the wayside, in churchyards, and in moorlands. Those by roadsides and on moorlands were doubtless intended as rout markings. A few may have served as boundary stones, and others like the wayside shrines found in Catholic European countries. Crosses to which inscriptions have been added must have been memorial stones. According to W. G. V. Balchin \\"The crosses are either plain or ornamented, invariably carved in granite, and the great majority are of the wheel-headed Celtic type.\\" Their distribution shows a greater concentration in west Cornwall and a gradual diminution further east and further north. In the extreme northeast none are found because it had been settled by West Saxons. The cross in Perran Sands has been dated by Charles Henderson as before 960 AD; that in Morrab Gardens, Penzance, has been dated by R. A. S. Macalister as before 924 AD; and the Doniert Stone is thought to be a memorial to King Dumgarth (died 878).Balchin (1954), pp. 62–63 Celtic art is found in Cornwall, often in the form of stone crosses of various types. Cornwall boasts the highest density of traditional 'Celtic crosses' of any nation (some 400). Charles Henderson reported in 1930 that there were 390 ancient crosses and in the next forty years a number of others have come to light.Hardy, Evelyn (1972, April/May) \\"Hardy's runic stone?\\", in: London Magazine; New series, vol. 12, no. 1, pp. 85–91; citing Henderson's Cornwall: a Survey (1930), made for the Council for the Protection of Rural England In the 1890s Arthur G. Langdon collected as much information as he could about these crosses (Old Cornish Crosses; Joseph Pollard, Truro, 1896) and one hundred years later Andrew G. Langdon has done a survey in the form of five volumes of Stone Crosses in Cornwall, each volume covering a region (e.g. Mid Cornwall) which the Federation of Old Cornwall Societies has published.1: North Cornwall; 2: Mid Cornwall; 3: East Cornwall; 4: West Penwith; 5: West Cornwall. There are 2nd eds. of nos. 1, 2 and 3. N.B. The two Langdons are unrelated. Similar crosses are also found on Dartmoor in Devon. In modern times many crosses were erected as war memorials and to celebrate events such as the millennium. \\"Here is an example of continuity in cultural traits extending over many generations: for we can look beyond the medieval cross to the inscribed stone and even farther back to the prehistoric mênhir, and yet bring the custom right up-to-date with the twentieth-century war memorial.\\"—W. G. V. Balchin (1954).Balchin, W. G. V. (1954) Cornwall: an illustrated essay on the history of the landscape.

An account of its discovery was published in the Journal of the Royal Institution of Cornwall; vol. 7, 1882. Arthur Langdon said of it: \\"Undoubtedly this is a magnificent monument, and in regard to height is, with the exception of the cross in Mylor churchyard, since discovered, the tallest in Cornwall\\".Old crosses 1896, pp. 398–401 ;Parishes S - T There is a Cornish cross at Carracawn in the parish of St Germans.Old crosses 1896, p. 201 There are two stone crosses in the churchyard of St Ive. One is a Latin wayside cross which was found in use as a gatepost in one of the glebe fields near the churchyard in 1932. A month later it was erected in its present position. The other is an incomplete cross which was found in the vicarage garden in 1965. In 1982 it was erected in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 39–40 In the churchyard of St Stephens-by-Saltash is a Gothic lantern cross. This cross was first recorded by Joseph Polsue in 1872; it stood for many years in the vicarage garden. In the 1970s it was resited in the churchyard. Andrew Langdon is of the opinion that it originally stood in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed.

It was first recorded in 1858 as a cross without a base. By 1896 it was standing on a base; in the 1950s it was removed to the side of the road from its previous site in the middle. Crafthole was granted a weekly market in 1315; it has been suggested that this cross was the market cross.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 63 There is a Cornish cross in the churchyard of Tresmeer. According to Arthur Langdon it was formerly in the churchyard of Laneast.

Langdon holds that place-names starting \\"Lan\\" indicate the location of a Burial Ground, not a church or monastery (p. 3, section d). The items listed in the book in Constantine are numbered 18 to 29. Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded six Cornish crosses in the parish; in the churchyard, at Bosvathick, at Merthen, at Nanjarrow, at Trevease and at Trewardreva {illustrated Fig. b8).Old crosses 1896 In 1993 a medieval stone cross was found built into a collapsing Cornish hedge at the junction of the road from Constantine to Penryn and the road from Mawnan Smith (illustrated Fig. b9).

The stone is 17 ft 6 in long and there is a local tradition that it marked the site of St Mylor's grave not far from the place where it was found. It is thoughtGuide to the Parish Church of St Mylor to be of pre-Christian origin. It was set up as it is now by sailors from HMS Ganges.Old crosses 1896, pp. 342–43Iago, W.

The cross at Enys (illustrated Fig. b16) was originally at Sancreed and was set up at Enys in 1848. The small cross at Penryn was once built into the fish market; when this was pulled down the cross was saved and resited near the town hall in 1895.Old crosses 1896, pp. 47–48 & 177This cross near the town hall (grid ref.

The other crosses were in the churchyard, and at Boderwennack, Bodilly, Manhay-vean and Trenethick. There is also an early cross-slab in the church.Old crosses 1896 An old carved granite stone can be seen approximately south-west of Porkellis Crossroads in the private field on the corner near Bodilly. The stone stands high, with a bas-relief cross on one side and an incised cross on the other. According to local oral history, it was called the \\"Wendron God\\" and people made the sign of the cross when passing by. Formerly located on a hill between Carilley and Burhos, it was unlawfully removed several times in the 19th century and finally relocated to Bodilly in 1886.Bond, Chris (2007). An Index to the Historical Place Names of Cornwall/ The Cornovia Press ; Vol. 1, p. 82. Arthur Langdon (1896) gave the following account of the Merther Uny crosses: \\"The cross stands in situ on the Merther Uny estate, on Polglaze Hill, by the left- hand side of the road from St. Wendron to Constantine. Formerly there was a road leading down to Merther Uny old churchyard, the entrance to which was close to the cross; but all traces of this road have now disappeared. A tradition is still believed in the neighbourhood that a man lies buried beneath the cross. The monolith is known locally as 'Meruny Cross'.\\"--\\"The cross occupies its original site, near the south side of the entrance to the old churchyard, and stands on a base ...

The five similar stone crosses in Creed parish, including one now at Grampound church, may also have been due to him.The Cornish Church Guide (1925), p. 81 Merther-derwa's will says \\"New stone crosses to be put up of the usual kind in those parts of Cornwall from Kayar Reslasek to Camborne church where dead bodies are rested on the way to their burial, that prayers may be made and the bearers take some rest\\". As there are no Gothic stone crosses in Camborne or adjacent parishes it is likely that these crosses were set up at Creed instead. In Creed parish there are the remains of four 15th-century crosses, three of which were cut from Pentewan stone. The market cross of Grampound is more ornate than the other three crosses. Fair Cross is a Gothic cross shaft. Nancor Cross has a cross head which was found in the 1920s near Nancor Farm; it was later set on a new shaft and erected beside the A390 road. In 1995 it was broken into four pieces but repaired in 1996. The fourth cross consists only of a cross base at Creed Lane.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 30–32 There are two Cornish crosses in the parish of Feock: one is in the churchyard and the other at Trelissick. The cross in the churchyard probably dates from the 13th century (it has a crude crucifixus figure on one side of the head and a foliated cross on the other). The cross at Trelissick was moved from Tredrea in the parish of St Erth in the 1840s; it has a crude crucifixus figure on the front of the head but the back is defaced.Old crosses 1896, pp. 153–54 & 277–78Stone crosses; mid, p. 38 There is a fine Cornish cross in the churchyard of Gerrans.Old crosses 1896, pp. 263–64 According to Andrew Langdon (1994) this cross was not originally a churchyard cross but a wayside cross. No other ancient stone cross exists in the Roseland Peninsula; however a cross called Penpirthe Cross is shown on the parish terrier of 1613 as standing on the boundary of the parishes of Gerrans and Philleigh.Langdon A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 39 Arthur Langdon (1896) describes a Cornish cross in the manor house grounds at Eastbourne, Sussex, which was originally at Kenwyn. Davies Gilbert, a former resident of the manor house removed it from a roadside gate west of Truro where it was in use as a gatepost and had it transported to Eastbourne in 1817. The shaft is ornamented on all four sides.Old crosses 1896, pp. 303–07 The churchyard cross at Lamorran is a fine example of a Gothic stone cross.Pevsner, N. (1970) Cornwall.

Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 41 Fig. e2: Sandyway Cross There are four stone crosses in the parish of Lanlivery: Trethew Cross consists of a crosshead which was found in 1900 and a separate base; Trevorry or Sandyway Cross was found in 1936; Menawink Cross is a cross with a mutilated head which was found c. 1990 and erected shortly thereafter on the opposite side of the road; Crewel Cross was first reported in 1870 built into a stile (in 1900 the two separate parts were joined together and erected on a base).Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 50–52 Two stone crosses from Lanlivery were removed in the 1840s and turned into monuments: one was taken to Boconnoc and one to St Winnow.Langdon, A. G. (2005) Stone Crosses in East Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; pp. 24 & 71 Arthur Langdon (1896) recorded three Cornish crosses and one cross base in the parish of Luxulyan. One cross is in the churchyard (illustrated above right); it was brought there in the 19th century from Three Stiles near Consence. Another cross is at Methrose and the third at Trevellan (lying horizontally and built into a hedge). The cross base is at Trevellan Lane End.Old crosses 1896, pp. 64–65, 81–82 & 423 Andrew Langdon (1994) does not mention the cross at Methrose. Trevellan Cross was removed from the hedge and erected at Lockengate in 1903; in 1972 it was moved a few yards to the crossroads on the A391.Langdon, A. G.

Great Trelowthas was the site of one of the medieval chapels in the parish, recorded as licensed in 1379. Probus was one of four places in Cornwall having a right of sanctuary which extended beyond the walls of the church, the others being Padstow, St Keverne and St Buryan. The missing Carvossa cross is thought to have marked the eastern limit of sanctuary and it is likely that this cross marked the western limit.Langdon, A. G.

Another cross is in the grounds of a house originally known as Moor Cottage. This house was built in 1819; the cross was brought from Hewas in the parish of Ladock.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 22 The Biscovey Stone, St Blazey, is the shaft of an ancient Celtic cross. It was inscribed, but the text is no longer readable. There are several theories about the stone; one says it dates from around 600 AD to show the Saxon advance into the county, another puts the date at around 900 AD. The head is thought to have been removed during the Reformation. The stone served as a gate post near the St Blazey turnpike gate. In 1896 it was moved to St Mary's Church, Biscovey. Arthur Langdon described the stone in 1896: he read the inscription as \\"+ Alroron Ullici + filius\\". It was also described by William Borlase in his Antiquities of Cornwall (1754), pp. 363–64.Old crosses 1896, pp. 368=72 The churchyard cross of St Dennis has a head of horseshoe shape and is ornamented with some unusual incised ornament.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 33 Fig. e4: St Ewe Cross A roadside Celtic cross once stood near Nunnery Hill, St Ewe (Charles Henderson in 1925 refers to it being at Lanhadron). However, the crosshead and shaft were thrown down in 1873 by a farmer looking for buried treasure, and both pieces were afterwards lost. The base has survived in situ with an inscription in insular script, unreadable except for the word crucem; Elisabeth Okasha dates the construction of this monument between the ninth and eleventh centuries.See the discussion and bibliography in Elisabeth Okasha, Corpus of Early Christian Inscribed Stones of South-west Britain (Leicester: University Press, 1993), pp. 129–132 There is another cross at Corran, about half a mile east of the churchtown.Old crosses 1896, pp. 80–81 This cross is also known as Beacon Cross since its site is known as the Beacon. There is a cross at Heligan known as Bokiddick Cross; it came from Bokiddick Farm in the parish of Lanivet which was then owned by the Tremaynes who also owned Heligan. The cross in the churchtown stands on a massive base which is the only original part of it. The stones forming the cross came from elsewhere and nothing is known about the design of the original cross.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

The cross head was found at Treneague at the end of the 19th century and afterwards attached to a new shaft and set up in the churchyard. Treneague was the site of a chapel which was licensed in 1381.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed. Federation of Old Cornwall Societies; p. 66 Fig. e7: the cross at High Cross At the edge of High Cross near Pydar Street in Truro, there is an ancient Celtic cross. A cross in Truro was mentioned in a document of 1290. In 1958 during excavations in St Nicholas Street the upper section of a stone cross was found and placed next to the museum. In 1981 it was erected outside the Marks and Spencer store. After it had been extended with a piece of Hantergantick granite it was re-erected at High Cross in 1988 and dedicated in 1992. It is likely that the cross originally at High Cross was a Gothic latin cross and that this cross was originally a simple wayside cross.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

This cross, which was untraced for many years, was found near a hedge in 1908 by Dr. W. J. Stephens of the Old Cornwall Society. Initially, it was claimed by owners of the property where it was found. In 1970, the Newquay Old Cornwall Society intervened and were successful in having the cross installed in the churchyard.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

One cross is in the churchyard (illustrated Fig. f5) and the other is half a cross head at Treffry. The cross in the churchyard is ornamented on all four sides of the shaft. Of the Reperry Cross only the base remains but the cross was illustrated in the Gentleman's Magazine, vol. 75 (1805).Old crosses 1896, pp. 382–83, 183, 227 & 423 In addition to these there is a cross called Bodwen Cross; this cross was recorded in 1850 but was not mentioned by J. T. Blight or Arthur Langdon. It was found again in 1937 near Helman Tor in the parish of Lanlivery. It was taken from there and erected in the new cemetery at Lanhydrock. A request for it to be returned to Lanlivery to a site on the Saints' Way was refused.Langdon, A. G. (2002) Stone Crosses in Mid Cornwall; 2nd ed.

Charles Yang (born 1973) is a linguist and cognitive scientist. He is currently Professor in the Department of Linguistics, Computer Science, and Psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.. His research focuses on language acquisition, variation and change, and is carried out from a broadly Chomskyan perspective. Yang is a graduate of MIT's AI Lab. His first book, Knowledge and Learning in Natural Language (2002), proposes a model of syntactic acquisition couched within the Principles and Parameters framework. In this model, different grammatical options are associated with different probabilities, which change over time. The model is applied to a number of case studies in language acquisition and historical linguistics. His second book, The Infinite Gift: how children learn and unlearn the languages of the world (2006), is written for a popular audience and explores acquisition and knowledge of language. Yang's third book, The Price of Productivity: how children learn to break the rules of language (2016), won the Linguistic Society of America's Leonard Bloomfield Award.. This book deals with the acquisition of linguistic rules with exceptions, and proposes a quantifiable upper bound on the number of lexical exceptions that a grammatical rule can tolerate. In 2018, Yang was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship.. References Books * Yang, Charles. 2002. Knowledge and Learning in Natural Language. Oxford: Oxford University Press. * Yang, Charles. 2006.

It determines the unalienable, invariable core structure of the German commonwealth. As such, it is the core substance of the German constitution. Building upon more general definitions of liberal democracy, the term has a specific legal meaning in Germany and is part of the German (originally West German) system of a Streitbare Demokratie (\\"fortified democracy\\") that bans attempts to dismantle the liberal democratic basic order by what German authorities refer to as \\"enemies of the Constitution\\" or \\"extremists\\". In practice the concept has been used to target far-left and far-right groups and in the ideological struggle against East German communism during the Cold War; during the Cold War the concept was closely linked to the state doctrine of anti-communism in West Germany. Theoretically the concept is associated with anti-totalitarianism and with the scholarly field of democracy and extremism research in Germany. While often relying upon scholars in this field, the decision that a group threatens the liberal democratic basic order is ultimately a political decision that is the responsibility of the interior minister at the state or federal level, or, in the case of a ban, a legal decision that is decided by the judiciary. History and definition The FDGO touches on the political order and the societal and political values on which German liberal democracy rests. According to the German constitutional court, the free democratic order is defined thus: > The freeThe German original says \\"freiheitlich\\", not \\"frei\\". See also > liberalism and https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/freiheitlich democratic basic > order can be defined as an order which excludes any form of tyranny or > arbitrariness and represents a governmental system under a rule of law, > based upon self-determination of the people as expressed by the will of the > existing majority and upon freedom and equality. The fundamental principles > of this order include at least: respect for the human rights given concrete > form in the Basic Law, in particular for the right of a person to life and > free development; popular sovereignty; separation of powers; responsibility > of government; lawfulness of administration; independence of the judiciary; > the multi-party principle; and equality of opportunities for all political > parties.Kommers (1980), p. 680. People and groups that threaten the liberal democratic basic order are referred to as \\"enemies of the Constitution\\" or \\"extremist\\" in German government and legal language. Parties as well as groups can be banned if they strive to abolish the FDGO, which has been done so successfully in regard to the Communist Party (1956) and the Socialist Reich Party (1952). In 2003 as well as in 2017, attempts to ban the National Democratic Party (NPD) failed. The willingness of a liberal democracy to ban parties that endanger liberal democracy itself has been termed \\"militant democracy\\", or \\"wehrhafte Demokratie\\" in German. While conceptually largely similar to broader definitions of liberal democracy, the liberal democratic basic order is distinguished by the measures that are allowed against \\"extreme\\" ideologies and groups to defend the order, such as the possibility to ban or officially monitor extremist groups. The liberal democratic basic order has been a core concept in the constitutional law of the Federal Republic of Germany, originally West Germany, since 1949, and it played a significant role in the West German government's efforts to counteract communism during the Cold War. The concept is closely linked to the state doctrine of anti-communism in the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) during the Cold War.Lora Wildenthal, The Language of Human Rights in West Germany, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2012, Examples include the ban of the Communist Party in 1956 and 1972 Anti-Radical Decree aimed at left-wing \\"radicals.\\"Wulf Schönbohm: Verfassungsfeinde als Beamte? Die Kontroverse um die streitbare Demokratie, München 1979. The German Restitution Laws also contained a \\"communist exception\\" that specifically determined that \\"enemies of the liberal democratic basic order\\", in practice communists, were not entitled to compensation for earlier Nazi persecution.Boris Spernol: \\"Die Kommunistenklausel\\". In Stefan Creuzberger and Dierk Hoffmann (ed.), \\"Geistige Gefahr\\" und \\"Immunisierung der Gesellschaft\\": Antikommunismus und politische Kultur in der frühen Bundesrepublik, De Gruyter Oldenbourg, 2014 Communist groups have been extensively monitored by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the state offices for the protection of the constitution under the umbrella term of \\"far-left extremism\\"; during the Cold War the Federal Agency for Civic Education also focused in large part on Communists as enemies of the liberal democratic basic order, and the struggle against communism was framed by West German authorities primarily in terms of civic education and anti-extremism.Gudrun Hentges: Staat und politische Bildung: Die Bundeszentrale für Heimatdienst bzw.

He served as Minister of Public Instruction under King Vajiravudh from 1912 to 1916, and laid out the country's first formal education plan. He was also a writer; his manual on modern etiquette, Sombat Khong Phudi (Qualities of a Gentleman), is one of his most influential works. In recognition of his contributions to education, the 150th anniversary of his birth was celebrated in association with the UNESCO in 2017. Early life Mom Rajawongse (MR) Pia was born on Tuesday 12th, waxing moon, 5th month, year of the rabbit, which corresponds to 16 April 1867. His father was the Prince Krommamuen Prapporapak, a grandson of King Rama II; his mother's name was Piam. As a boy, he was presented to Prince Damrong Rajanubhab, and enrolled at Suankularb Palace School (now Suankularb Wittayalai School). MR Pia completed both stages of education, which usually took four years, in a single year. He then underwent customary temporary ordination as a Buddhist monk at Wat Bowonniwet. Career Pia began his career in the Department of Education, serving as personal secretary to Prince Damrong and receiving the noble title Luang Phaisansinlapasat (). Pia followed Prince Damrong to the Ministry of Interior in 1892 when the Prince became minister, and was promoted to the title Phra Montriphotchanakit (). In 1893, King Chulalongkorn assigned Pia to be Prince Vajiravudh's guardian during the Prince's studies in England. Pia also acted as guardian to many of the King's sons in England, and received the title Phraya Wisutsuriyasak (). He also came to serve as Minister to the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Belgium and the United States, from 1897 to 1899. MR Pia in Western suit and tie, probably during his time in England As custodian to the royal students, Pia made observations of the modern Western education system. In a letter replying to the King's inquiries on why many of the students were failing in their education, Pia, a strong advocate of meritocracy, wrote that students were being sent regardless of their academic abilities, like sending whole logs to the sawmill; beginning work, only to find a hollow, unusable log, resulted in a waste of time and money. The King then commissioned a report, which Pia completed in 1898, suggesting improvements to Siam's developing education system; it was developed into the country's first education plan. Pia returned to Bangkok in 1899. One of the government's priorities in education at the time was expanding professional education in order to staff the rapidly growing bureaucracy. Pia became the head of the newly established Training School of the Civil Service, which later became the Royal Pages School and then Chulalongkorn University. To train the newly educated in proper manners, Pia authored Sombat Khong Phudi (, Qualities of a Gentleman) a manual prescribing proper etiquette which was highly influential and had over a million copies printed throughout the century. Pia became Minister of Public Instruction in 1912, during the reign of King Vajiravudh, and received the title Chaophraya Phrasadet Surentharathibodi (chaophraya being the highest rank in the nobility still in use at the time). He pushed for the adoption of compulsory education, but due to constraints in the development of mass education, the policy was not successful. It was later passed in 1921, under his successor Chaophraya Thammasakmontri. Pia resigned from public office in 1916, due to ill health. Personal life Pia married Miss Sa-ngiam (later Thanphuying Sa-ngiam), daughter of Luang Anurakphubet (Singto), in 1888. They lived at Luang Anurakphubet's family home on Atsadang Road before moving into a new property on Lan Luang Road, where Pia lived until his death. They had ten children, including a son, Mom Luang Pin Malakul, who would also become one of Thailand's most influential educators. The family name Malakul was bestowed by King Vajiravudh on 30 May 1913, following the royal act which prescribed the use of surnames.Personal letter by King Vajiravudh, dated 30 May 1913. Toward the end of his career, Pia suffered from neurasthenia and also fell ill to malaria. Chaophraya Thammasakmontri, who was a close aide of his, would later note that \\"working with a fever in the office was one of his well-known habits\\". He died less than a year after retiring, on 14 February 1917. Works and recognition MR Pia, wearing the khrui of a high-ranking official, posing with books in hand Pia produced numerous works, most of them textbooks written during his career in the Ministry of Public Instruction, focusing on the subjects of ethics and the Thai language. These include—in addition to Sombat Khong Phudi—Phonlamueang Di (, \\"The Good Citizen\\"), Chanya Phaet (, \\"Medical Ethics\\"), Akkharawithi (, \\"Orthography\\"), Phongsawadan Yo ( \\"Abridged Chronicles\\"), Kham Thiap Ro Lo (, \\"Comparison of Ro and Lo Words\\"), Chuai Phuean (, \\"Helping Friends\\") and Tuean Phuean (, \\"Warning Friends\\"). To the modern Thai public, however, his most familiar work is probably the patriotic song \\"Samakkhi Chumnum\\" (\\"United Gathering\\"), for which Pia wrote the lyrics, and which and is set to the tune of \\"Auld Lang Syne\\". As part of its anniversaries programme, the UNESCO, recognizing his contributions to education, was associated with the celebration of the 150th anniversary of Pia's birth in 2017. A building in Suankularb Wittayalai School is named Sala Phrasadet in his honour.

She is known for her work characterizing and classifying contacts by hydrogen bonds in organic compounds. Her \\"enlightened imagination, innovative creativity, and unfailing enthusiasm\\" is recognised as having a \\"transformative effect\\" in many areas of organic chemistry.  Education and career  Etter was born as Margaret Cairns in Greenville, a town in Delaware near Wilmington. Her father, Theodore (Ted) Cairns, was a chemist by profession at DuPont. Etter attained her B.Sc. at the University of Pennsylvania, spending a freshman semester at Cornell (where she met future collaborator Joel Bernstein in the Mugwuamp freshman orientation group), and completed a master's degree at the University of Delaware in 1971 with Harold Kwart. Her Ph.D. research was completed at the University of Minnesota as a National Science Foundation predoctoral fellow under the supervision of Jack Gougoutas. Her thesis and postdoctoral work focused on the study of the chemical and structural properties of polyvalent iodine compounds using X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques. Her Ph. D work was published and still provides a model for how topotactic reactions should be studied. After a brief stay as an assistant professor at Augsburg College, Etter obtained employment in the Central Research Laboratories at the mile-square 3M campus in Maplewood, Minnesota as a researcher. She collaborated with several research groups to study crystalline compounds and polymers, including molecular salts based on two photographic dyes that formed no fewer than 14 polymorphs. Due to the difficulties of maintaining a stable research program at 3M, Etter returned to the University of Minnesota first as a postdoctoral researcher in solid state NMR with Robert Bryant, and later as professor (from 1984) at the School of Chemistry. For the rest of her career she devoted herself to the investigation of the properties of crystalline solids and hydrogen bonds. Her work influenced several areas of interest in the field of solid state organic chemistry, such as crystal growth, clathrate formation, phase transitions, supramolecular chemistry and co-crystals (a term she essentially defined in the community). Much of her work was truly interdisciplinary. Etter's key contribution was the use of graph sets to analyze hydrogen bond patterns (rather than the more conventional analysis of individual bonds), a path against the prevailing attitude that hydrogen bonding in organic solids was too complicated to understand. The establishing of the \\"Etter Rules\\" was later reported in Accounts of Chemical Research \\"Encoding and Decoding Hydrogen Bond Patterns in Organic Compounds\\" which since has been cited more than 4,000 times. Such representation is widely used in structural chemistry and solid state chemistry for the description of organic compounds. The use of \\"Etter Rules\\" was reviewed (with further results incorporated) in Angewandte Chemie, and the approach was incorporated into the CSD software for automatic analysis of structures. In April 1991 Etter was diagnosed with stage IV kidney cancer, in the most productive phase of her career that she herself described as being \\"on a roll\\". Her final appearance was on a tour of Israel to coincide with the Israel Chemical Society Annual Meeting, when she visited the Weizmann Institute and the Technion, places she had always wanted to visit due to the concentration of organic solid-state chemists. Additionally, during this visit she gave a plenary lecture on her research. Shortly after her return to the United States, Etter was placed in hospice care due to a rapid deterioration of her health. She died on June 9, 1992.  Awards and recognition  In 1979, Etter received the \\"Good Neighbor\\" award from the Minnesota radio station WCCO for her contributions to the development of the school science program STEP at 3M. Her outreach work focused on improving the opportunities for women in science, lecturing on the subject to high school and college students, and serving as a role model for female undergraduate and graduate students. During her illness on Thanksgiving Day 1991, Minnesota Public Radio paid a special tribute to her. Etter was recognized as an early pioneer in the Chemistry Department of the University of Minnesota due to the research she conducted related to \\"... the applications of solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, the design and properties of organic non-linear optical materials, and most significantly, in the understanding and utilization of hydrogen-bonding interactions in crystals.\\" Her work was recognized with many international awards and fellowships through her career: * Sloan Research Fellowship (1989) * Bush Foundation Fellowship * Iota Sigma Pi Award for Excellence in Chemistry * St. Paul Businessperson of the Year (1986) for her work with “Rochelle Crystal Corporation.” In recognition of both her scientific achievements and her work as a mentor to students and novice scientists, the American Crystallographic Association launched two awards in honor of Peggy Etter: the Margaret C. Etter Early Career Award, given to scientists who have made important contributions early in their careers, and the Margaret C. Etter Student Lecturer Award, awarded to a selection of students for their oral presentations at the annual conference of the association. In addition, the University of Minnesota holds an annual Etter Memorial Lecture and hosts an endowed lectureship in solid state chemistry and materials science bearing her name.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History Clark Dibble came to Michigan from New York State. He initially lived in Detroit and then Pontiac, but then stumbled across a site near the Saginaw Road where numerous Indian trails crossed. Convinced that the easy access to transportation could make a prosperous settlement, Dibble established the town of Dibbleville at this site in 1834. He established a sawmill and promoted the settlement, but did not stay long. In 1836, Robert LeRoy and William M. Fenton purchased the entire townsite on the advice of Robert's father, Judge Daniel LeRoy, who predicted the area would prosper when a planned railroad line was constructed. In 1837, Leroy and Fenton platted the town and renamed it Fentonville; they and other settlers opened stores, mills and hotels as Fentonville grew. The settlement was centered around the intersection of Shiawassee and Leroy Streets, and early settlers built houses nearby. In 1856, the Detroit and Milwaukee Railroad built a line through the settlement, and Fentonville expanded again, adding industrial activities such as a fruit preservation plant, a woolen mill, a tannery, a brewery, and other operations. Both residential and commercial areas of the city expanded, and plats were added to the town. The community became a major market and shipping center. Fenton continued as a major center until the early 20th century, when nearby Flint began to dominate the area. As automobiles became more prevalent, Fenton's role as a market and industrial center declined. However, many residents were lured by the opportunity to commute to Flint, Pontiac, or Lansing and the automotive assembly jobs offered. Fenton continues to serve as a bedroom community for Flint and other nearby cities. Description The Dibbleville-Fentonville Historic District includes 130 structures, of which 119 contribute to the historic character of the neighborhood. Of the 130 structure, 111 are originally residential (four of which have been converted to commercial use), 12 are commercial, four are churches, and three are public or institutional structures. These structures range from Greek Revival and Gothic Revival residences constructed in the 1830s to 1860s, to Italianate and Queen Anne structures from the later 19th century to Shingle, Colonial Revival, Mission, Spanish Revival, and Bungalow styles structures from around the turn of the century. Residential structures come is a range of sizes and grandeur, from large mansions to modest worker's cottages. The structures are made from wood, brick, cement block, stone, and various combinations of these materials. The core of the district is the two commercial blocks in a T-shaped area at the intersection of Leroy and Shiawassee Streets. This area includes mainly two-story, brick Italianate commercial style buildings. Many have cast iron and pressed metal storefronts, rounded arch windows and decorative cornices. Nearby are four churches. The commercial sector is surrounded by residential buildings.

The body had lain undiscovered for over 20 years and despite extensive investigations by North Wales Police, national and UK appeals and input from a notable serial killer, the identities of the body and the murderer(s) remain a mystery. Discovery of the body The remains were found on the evening of 14 November 2015 by two brothers. Andrew and Mark Middle were camping in Clocaenog Forest during the 2015 Wales Rally GB which they were spectating. It was dark and Mark was using a torch to look for firewood in the woods when he found a skull on the forest floor and after a closer inspection realised it was human. The skull was covered in moss and was largely concealed by the undergrowth.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 10m05s North Wales Police were notified of the discovery at 20:35. A local officer attended the scene and concluded that the brothers had found the fully decomposed remains of a human male.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 03m30s Based on tree growth, body decomposition and the fact that the area of the forest where the victim was found was planted in 1985, the police believe that the body was deposited between 1995 and 2005. The remains were found close to one of the Clocaenog sections of the rally and near to Pentre-llyn-Cymmer and Llyn Brenig. The deposition location of the body was easily accessible as it was only few metres (yards) from two forest roads.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 10m05s The location of the discovery was known to be near to the murder and burial location of Edward Carthy, who, at 28, was the youngest victim of serial killer Peter Moore. Moore later claimed that Clocaenog Forest Man was found in \\"exactly the same place\\" as Edward Carthy. Initial investigation After the discovery, the police started a large-scale search of the forest which took five weeks. The police uncovered an almost entire skeleton of a human male. The majority of the skeleton was discovered in dense trees and undergrowth a few metres (yards) away from the location of the skull.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 10m30s The remains were removed two days after the discovery and taken away to be examined by a pathologist. A DNA profile was extracted from the skeleton. No match was found in the UK national DNA database or the UK Missing Persons Unit. Biologists and forensic anthropologists gathered samples and evidence from the undergrowth in an attempt to date the body. A pathological investigation indicated that the man died from a blunt trauma to the head. Police established that it was likely that the man was murdered in an unknown location between 2004 and 2010 and the body dumped in location where it was found. Description of the victim It is likely that the man would have been born before 1950 and aged over 54 at the time of his death and most likely in his 60s. He would have been 'well-built' in life and would have had a height of between 5ft 8in and 5ft 10.5in (1.73–1.78m). The victim had an injury to his spine, fused vertebrae, a broken nose and possible injury to his left wrist.Crimewatch 26/09/16 5m00s He had arthritis and an inflammatory condition in his spine and other joints. In life, the victim would have experienced pain and reduced movement. The victim had lost a number of teeth during life which would have resulted in sunken cheeks. All the victim's posterior molar teeth were absent which suggests that he was not dentally-aware early in his life; however, this appeared to be followed by a sudden change of circumstance due to extensive dental work of very high quality completed later in life.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 5m20s Police stated that the victim had undergone two identifiable dental procedures in life. The first was that the victim had a number of crowns to his front teeth, work which appeared to have been done in the UK between 1980 and 2000. The second procedure was an uncommon procedure: a remedial filling to a temporary plastic crown which had been badly worn. John Rosie, a forensic odontologist, stated that, as the dental work was highly distinctive and involved specialist work, it could allow a dentist to identify the victim. Information regarding the victim's dental work was published in dentistry journals by the police.Crimewatch 26/09/2016 6m00s Some items of clothing were found near to the body but it could not be confirmed that they were associated with the victim. These items were: a dark green Pringle jumper and some dark red decomposed Marks and Spencer underwear. The underwear was manufactured in 1999Crimewatch 26/09/2016 6m30s and Pringle of Scotland confirmed that the jumper was produced between 2000 and 2004. Subsequent investigations In June 2016, the police released a photograph of the victim's jawbone in the hope that dentists may recognise their dental work and therefore identify the victim. The police also announced that they were undertaking familial DNA research. On 26 September 2016, police released images showing how the man could have looked when he was alive at the ages of 50, 60 and 70 on the BBC Crimewatch programme. In March 2017, the police confirmed that they had been contacted by, and met with, serial killer Peter Moore following his claims that he knew the identity of Clocaenog Forest Man. Moore claimed in a letter that the victim was a mature student at Aberystwyth University who had disappeared in 1996. Moore did not disclose the victim's name but Daily Post journalists identified a Roger Evans of Bradeley near Stoke-on-Trent who disappeared on 16 January 1996, aged 46, during his first year at Aberystwyth University. Moore later stated that his theory had been discounted by the police due to conflicting dates. In October 2017, police support officers and race marshals distributed leaflets to attendees of the 2017 Wales Rally GB.

Zeta-pan motif RNAs are found in Zetaproteobacteria. Zeta-pan RNAs are consistently located upstream of \\"pan\\" operons, which contains genes involved in the synthesis of pantothenate, which is a vitamin that is a precursor of coenzyme A. This genetic arrangement is consistent with the idea that Zeta-pan RNAs function as cis-regulatory elements to regulate pantothenate synthesis. Another RNA motif was previously discovered that also is found upstream of pan operons. This earlier pan RNA motif is, however, not found in Zetaproteobacteria. Both motifs consist of simple stem-loop secondary structures, although the earlier pan motif often consists of two stem-loops that are similar to each other. The stem-loops in the earlier pan motif usually have unpaired adenosine nucleotides in asymmetric locations on both sides of the stem-loop. The Zeta-pan motif has an unpaired adenosine only on its 5′ side. Therefore, it is possible that the two motifs are structurally related to each other, but the potential structural relationship between these motifs is not yet (as of 2018) clear.

The Panthers play in the AFL Hunter Central Coast competition.  Club History  The TAAFC was founded in 1976 and was a founding member of the former Central Coast Australian Football League. The club's search for players to field their inaugural team included eight players from Gosford who had just recently departed from the CCAFL's sister league, the Newcastle Australian Football League, in 1975. The Panthers saw success early, winning the inaugural CCAFL premiership in a closely fought win over Gosford. After 1976, the club saw a 12-year premiership drought but 1988 saw a new era of success for the Panthers as they managed to win four premierships in a row from 1988 to 1991. Terrigal-Avoca took out the 1994 and 1996 premierships and still continued to be a force onward from 1999 when they beat Killarney Vale in the final CCAFL grand final before both the Central Coast and Newcastle leagues merged to form the Black Diamond Australian Football League, now known as AFL Hunter Central Coast. Terrigal-Avoca won the inaugural BDAFL premiership in 2000 beating Cardiff 17.16.118 to 10.18.78. There then followed another prolonged premiership drought for 12 years when the 2012 grand final was won over Cardiff in the Hawks' fifth consecutive grand final loss. The Panthers lost to Newcastle City the following year in 2013 but then came back to being one of the league's strongest teams by beating Killarney Vale in the 2014 grand final and again in 2015 accounting for Newcastle City winning 14.9.93 to 10.11.71. 2016 saw Terrigal-Avoca's fifth straight grand final appearance but ultimately ended in disappointment as Newcastle City won the premiership but the tides turned again in 2017 when the Panthers beat Cardiff by 9 points but lost the most recent grand final of 2018. Terrigal-Avoca still continue to field junior and senior teams in Central Coast Junior AFL and the BDAFL and are regarded as the most successful club on the Central Coast.

Life and career  Francisco II was born in Lisbon on October 10, 1924 to António Francisco Santana and Ana de Jesus Santana. He was ordained by Cardinal Cerejeira on 29 June 1948, after which he took the position as teacher in the seminary of Santarém and as priest in several parishes of Lisbon. He then became National Director of the Apostleship of the Sea in 1960. From 1979 onward he worked as a monitor-operator for Lisnave shipyards since, and participated on numerous missions abroad. He was elected bishop of Funchal on March 18, 1974, and episcopal ordination on the 21st of the same month. However, he was forced to delay his arrival to Madeira due to the Revolution. He would make his solemn entry into the see of Funchal on May 12, 1974. In that and that summer his was kidnapped at Funchal's seminary premises. On February 1981 he was hospitalized, due to cancer, in Funchal and would later undergo surgery in London. He would later died in the episcopal palace of Funchal on March 5, 1982.  Political legacy  It is attributed to Francisco II the launch of Alberto João Jardim's political career, who would become President of the Regional Government of Madeira for 37 years, the longest time in office for an elected Portuguese politician. Such was due to the fact that Francisco II choose João Jardim, on October 24, 1974, to be the director of the Diocese's newspaper, who then became a mouthpiece to the Church's anti-communist and anti-socialist sentiment in revolution's aftermath, therefore influencing the political set-up of Madeira in the early years of Autonomy. During his time in office he frequently attack Communism and Socialism during his masses by stating that: \\"marxist socialism, where the agents of international communism cleverly hide, intends to assault our archipelago of Madeira to colonize it\\" and by calling Communism an utopia.

Geography  The village of Ezerovo is situated at the foot of the Aida Mountains and Dragoyna Mountains on the bank of the Kayalikeka River, which is the geographic boundary between the Western and Eastern Rhodopes, flowing into the River Maritsa. It is located near the villages of Bodrovo (2 km east), Water (6 km south) and Byala reka (Plovdiv region)  Byala reka (6 km northwest) . The closest town is the municipal center of Parvomay, 13 km northwest, and the closest regional town is Haskovo - 28 km east. Not far from the village are Mineral Batts of Haskovo. The size (area) of the village of Ezerovo is 26,318 km2. The terrain of the countryside is hilly, filled with forests, gullies, hidden small plains, woods, and many meadows. The climate of the village is moderate-continental, with very frequent summer droughts. Precipitation is within 650 l / m^2 and is unevenly distributed throughout the year. The most common winds are the western ones, called \\"Poriaza\\", and the southern ones, called \\"white winds\\", often come from southeast and bring a lot of rain. There are some of the rare species of animal and plant species in Bulgaria. The geographic location of the past is its economic growth: the proximity to the mountain and its pastures has determined the development of sheep farming, and the extensive agricultural lands from the north and west have favored the development of agriculture.  History  The legend says that the village dates back to ancient Thracian times. An old name from the time of the Ottoman domination is the Yedi durali neighborhood (meaning \\"seven small neighborhoods\\"); then the village was situated on the territory of today's lake Ezerovo. After changing its geographic location, its name has been replaced by Diptys göl (meaning \\"lake without a bottom\\"). The date of the foundations found in the Thracian mound is V century B.C. A number of other ancient artifacts have been discovered, such as a golden diadem, small golden spoon, and bronze mirror. A gold ring with a Thracian tongue was found in 1912 when excavating a tombstone in the area of Prazenaka.(Journal Article Die Inschrift von Ezerovo) The ring weighs 31.3 grams and the surface on which the letters are engraved has an elliptical shape measuring 1.7 x 2 cm. The Ring of Ezerovo, found in 1912 by two local villagers On the ring an inscription is found written in a Greek script and consisting of 8 lines, the eighth of which is located on the edge, the rim, of the rotating disk; it reads: ΡΟΛΙΣΤΕΝΕΑΣΝ / ΕΡΕΝΕΑΤΙΛ / ΤΕΑΝΗΣΚΟΑ / ΡΑΖΕΑΔΟΜ / ΕΑΝΤΙΛΕΖΥ / ΠΤΑΜΙΗΕ / ΡΑΖ // ΗΛΤΑ. Alt URL The inscription on the ring is translated as follows: > Rolisten, I your wife am flying from joy towards > you and you lay down next to me in that sunny day. Another famous archaeological find in Ezerovo is the skeleton of a prehistoric animal. In 1965, D. Kovatchev, D. Baturov and D. Kaldiyev opened a preserved skeleton of the prehistoric mammal called \\"Deinotherium giganteum Kaup\\", which was exhibited at the rectorate of the Sofia University Kl. Ohridski on the top floor, and his copy is in the Paleontological Museum in Asenovgrad.http://www.geology.bas.bg/geolbal/02_Kovachev.pdf (GEOLOGICA BALCANICA, 35. 3—4. Sofia, Dec. 2006, p. 5—40.)  Sightseeing  In the center of the village a main architectural landmark is the church \\"St. Nicholas\\", among the oldest churches in the area. Built in 1851 with the permission of the sultan, it was repaired in 1890. It is a three-nave structure without a dome and a bell tower. In later times a bell tower, standing 30 meters from the temple, was made. It is supposed that the icons were made by the iconic icon painter Nikola Odrinchanin. It has been repaired with donations, and now has a beautiful dome. The temple was mainly renovated in 2010. Among the main sights of the village is the house-museum of the Bulgarian poet Vania Petkova. Its house museum is at the very beginning of the village with a memorial plaque, donated by the municipality of Parvomay. About half a kilometer after the beginning of the village there is a monument with names of people who died for Bulgaria, some of them from Ezerovo. About 3 km from the village there is a mineral spring named Chuchura, on which a fountain was built, opened on June 16, 1868, according to the inscription. At its foot there is a small natural pool, which is a great place to fish. Underground sometimes there are old bones of small fish. There is a reservoir, Ezerovo Lake.

It is native to Central and southern Peninsular India, Sri Lanka and Maldives, having a significant distribution throughout Western Ghats of India. It is most commonly planted to provide shade in coffee plantations due to its dense and wide foliage. The ripened figs attract many birds, especially during the spring. Description A Ficus amplissima (Pimpri) tree leaf with veins visible Ficus amplissima is a large evergreen or semi-deciduous tree with a widely spreading crown of over . It can grow up to a height of in natural conditions and has a moderate to dense spread of aerial roots which are generally wrapped around top of the trunk. It has a trunk diameter of up to . The leaves are broadly ovate elliptic-lanceolate to ovate-oblong in shape with a blunt or acute tip and an entire margin; the leaf base is acute-cuneate or rounded in shape. They are long and broad, with a petiole. They are simple and occur alternately on branch, having a slender and grooved shape above and a glabrous, glandular shape at the apex below. The lamina is glabrous and coriaceous; trinerved from base, the midrib is raised above the leaf plane and lateral nerves are present in 8-10 parallel pairs, appearing prominently slender; the tertiary nerves are obscured and reticulate. The fruits are small stalkless figs in diameter, light green initially, ripening to syconium red or purple, with smooth achenes. The bark of the trunk is thornless and greenish- gray with a blaze yellow reflection, with a smooth texture. It exudes a milky white latex exudate profusely. Branches and branchlets are terete in shape with a glabrous or puberulous surface covered with annular scars and a pale yellow tinge. Ficus amplissima typically begins as an epiphyte in the branch of a tree that grows aerial roots that can provide nutrients when they reach soil. The aerial roots can surround the trunk of the host tree, which, combined with the growth of F. amplissima in the branches, can eventually kill the host tree. =Inflorescence= Ficus amplissima displays a syconium type of inflorescence (arrangement of the flowers on a plant) borne by all figs (genus Ficus), formed by an enlarged, fleshy, hollow receptacle with multiple ovaries on the inside surface. It is a monoecious species, meaning that separate staminate and carpellate flowers are always found on the same plant. Flowers are unisexual and arise with in the inner wall of syconia, are axillary (arising from the axil of an inflorescence) subsessile (not attached completely with a stalk) and have depressed globe-like shape (spherical with a flattened top and bottom). They are crowned towards the end of branchlets surrounded by basal bracts in a group of three. The flowering and fruiting cycle of F. amplissima occurs between September to December. Leaves fall in early January and continue until mid-February. Flowering occurs from late November through the middle of January. Fruiting begins in early December, a few weeks after flowering begins, and continues until middle to late February. Distribution Ficus amplissima is a species native to Central, Eastern and southern Peninsular India, Sri Lanka and Maldives, having a significant distribution throughout the Western Ghats (Sahyadaris) of India. It is an endemic species and hence it has not been recorded outside its native habitat. F. amplissima is present scarcely in northern and eastern Indian states of Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan whereas it is found abundantly in southern states of Andhra Pradesh, Goa, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Kerala. In Pakistan, it is cultivated in Lahore and Sindh. Ecology =Environment= Ficus amplissima is tolerant to various climate zones (Köppen climate classification categories of Af, Am, Aw/As, Bsh, Cfa and Cwa). The most ideal environment for its growth requires continuous sunlight, well- drained soil, moderate water, and moisture in soil, and an air temperature ranging between and . In India, being a native species, it occurs both naturally in wild as well as cultivated up to altitudes of . Due to its semi- arid climate tolerance, it is moderately drought resistant. Its growth increases substantially in sunlight receiving surroundings, but consistent temperatures below and above impact and effect its overall growth and health. Under such climatic conditions, aftercare till establishment is necessary and helpful in ensuring high survival rate. =Reproduction= Ficus amplissima is associated with a fig wasp, an agaonid wasp which acts as its sole pollinator as this wasp lays its eggs only on trees of this species. All fig trees have this unique form of fertilization, with each species relying on a single specialized species of pollinating wasp that relies on the fig tree to reproduce. Ficus amplissima produces three flowers within its fruit, the male, the long styled female, and the short styled female. The short styled female flower is known as the \\"gall flower\\". The female fig wasp enters the fig to lays its eggs on the short styled female flowers, pollinating the long styled female flowers in the process. Wingless male fig wasps are the first to emerge, inseminating the emerging females and boring exit tunnels out of the fig for the winged females. Female wasps then exit the fig to collect pollen from the male flowers and search for new figs. F. amplissima flowers asynchronously to support the life cycle of the fig wasp pollinators. The local population of fig wasps must exceed a minimum size to ensure that at any time some trees emit wasps while some trees receive wasps. The short-lived pollinator wasps go locally extinct without available figs. =Propagation= Ficus amplissima is propagated by various methods and techniques, including sowing the fig seeds in moist soil or burying stem cuttings. It is a relatively fast growing tree. Fig wasps are the primary pollinators of F. amplissima whereas its seeds are generally dispersed by the Indian fruit bat (giving it the name of \\"Indian Bat tree\\"), as well as by birds and other mammals. Cultivation Ficus amplissima is most commonly cultivated to provide shade in coffee plantations due to its height and dense and wide foliage. It commonly occurs on avenues or road verges. It can also be found on tank bunds or along the boundaries of agricultural fields. In Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, the species is cultivated in parks and along roadsides and pavements. In Kerala and coastal Maharashtra, it is found occasionally as a subcanopy tree in disturbed tropical evergreen or moist deciduous forests at altitudes of up to . F. amplissima is also used as an ornamental tree, commonly as a bonsai or houseplant. It is generally kept indoors, usually in a living room or terrace area. Vernacular names The Ficus amplissima tree is known by a wide range of vernacular names, including: * in English — Indian Bat Fig * in Hindi — Piparee पिपरी * in Dravidian languages: ** Kannada — Biḷibāsri mara ಬಿಳಿಬಾಸ್ರಿ ಮರ (Literally \\"White tree\\"); Biḷibāsri ಬಿಳಿಬಾಸ್ರಿ (Literally \\"White blossom\\"); Biḷibasuri ಬಿಳಿಬಸುರಿ (Literally \\"White\\") ** Malayalam — Chela ചേല; Koyalee കോയലി ** Tamil — Ichchi இச்சி; Kal-ichchi கல்-இச்சி (Literally \\"Stone ichi\\") Uses Ficus amplissima has been traditionally used in Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani medicine for the treatment of diabetes. The bark of the tree is a natural anti-diabetic and anti-oxidant medicine, reducing blood glucose levels. The phenol in leaves gives the foliage anti-inflammatory and wound healing properties. In native medicine, leaf juice is applied on chronic wounds and the latex is applied on fresh wounds. The figs are chewed and their juice is sucked to treat mouth ulcers. The leaves and branches of F. amplissima are used as fodder for cows, goats, and sheep. The wood is ideal for burning, and thus is widely used as a fuelwood in rural areas. The raw or ripened fruits are used to make pickles. The trunk produces hard and high quality timber that is used to build furniture. It is also used by rural farmers to make agricultural tools. The bark provides strong fibres which are used to make ropes and bags. It is also planted as polewood in farms.

He was convicted of eighteen attacks on children aged between two and four years in 1938–1939 in Sverdlovsk, Nizhny Tagil and Kushva. Eight of these attacks resulted in murder. On January 16, 1940, Vinnichevsky was sentenced to death and executed several months later.  Early years  Vladimir Vinnichevsky was born in July 1923.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 275. His father, Georgy Ivanovich, worked as a crew chief in municipal public utilities of Sverdlovsk, and his mother, Elizaveta Petrovna, was an accountant. The family lived in a stand-alone private house in the center of Sverdlovsk. The Vinnichevsky family was considered wealthy by Soviet standards at the time: Vladimir had a suit, a tank helmet, a Swiss knife, and leather shoes. He had been also given pocket money - at the time of his arrest he was found to have more than 20 rubles, which constituted a two- day salary of an average Soviet worker at the time. Vladimir studied at the Sverdlovsk School № 16, in the 7 \\"B\\" grade. Due to his low performance in school, Vinnichevsky once had to repeat a grade. At the same time, however, he was good at singing and knew many songs by heart. Vinnichevsky was on friendly terms with Ernst Neizvestny, who later became a famous sculptor. Neizvestny and Vinnichevsky were in the same year of schooling (Vinnichevsky was two years older than Neizvestny, but went to school at a one-year older age and repeated a grade). The adolescents lived near each other. Together they attended school, cinema and Sverdlovsk's Theater of Musical Comedy. Vinnichevsky often visited Neizvestny's apartment. During an interrogation on November 17, 1939, Ernst Neizvestny described Vinnichevsky with the following wordsState Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region. - F. Р-148. - Op. 2. - D. 746. - L. 164–165:  Murders  The list of victims with encrypting information, which lead to Vinnichevsky It is not known when Vladimir committed his first murder, since the investigators could not find the relatives of the first victims, about whom Vinnichevsky gave evidence.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко- криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 268. To commit his crimes, Vinnichevsky would go around yards, saying that he was under the orders of the Komsomol organization for the sponsored Pioneer squads collecting scrap metal, and therefore went around neighborhoods, figuring out which residents had scrap.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 271. The first murder (or more precisely, the third, as there is no information on the previous murders) was that of 4-year-old Gerta Grebanova, committed in the summer or early autumn of 1938 in Sverdlovsk. Vinnichevsky entered the courtyard of the private house where the Gribanovs lived, took the girl to the kitchen garden, where he strangled her, and then struck her head 8 times with a kitchen knife, breaking it, and leaving a splinter in the victim's skull.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 270. He later disposed of the broken knife and used a screwdriver and a folding knife in later murders. The planned map for the abduction and murder of a girl named Rita Fomina in Nizhny Tagil (case materials) Although Vinnichevsky committed most of the attacks in Sverdlovsk, he made trips to other cities in the Sverdlovsk Oblast to confuse the investigation - one attack was committed in Nizhny Tagil, and another in Kushva.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 273. He attacked both boys and girls. The motive of the attack was a sexual act with the victim. At first, Vinnichevsky tried to perform a \\"natural\\" sexual act with the female victims, but he was convinced that, due to anatomical limitations, this could not be done. Then he began to perform anal intercourse, and in some cases (usually in the cold season) limited himself to rubbing his genitals.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко- криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 270—273. After the act Vinnichevsky would choke his victim, and sometimes stab them to death. The murder of Gerta Gribanova gave the investigators evidence, as the girl's skull had a knife piece stuck in it. The girl's body was beheaded by the investigative authorities: the skull was left as evidence, and the rest given to the child's parents for the burial. The assumption was that the killer would use the same kitchen knife that ended Gribanova's life, but later, this assumption turned out to be false. The fifth victim of Vinnichevsky was a boy who, most likely, survived, but could not be found. Then the killer suggested to 4-year-old Borya Titov to go sledging with him, took him to a wasteland, and attacked him after a snowdrift. Although Vinnichevsky prudently took the child with him, Borya was rescued, and later told the investigators about the murderer. The seventh victim was 3-year-old Kate Lobanovа in Kushva. The girl was killed, and her body later thrown into a swamp to hide the smell of degradation. In Sverdlovsk, Vinnichevsky began to practice the kidnapping of children and killing them in the forest massifs to the outskirts, where the bodies were covered with branches. This is how 4-year-old Lida Surina and 3-year-old Valya Kamaeva died in the spring of 1939. Later, 3-year-old Alya Gubina was kidnapped, with whom Vinnichevsky had sexual intercourse, after which he stabbed her several times with a knife, leaving a wound 25 centimeters long. After that, he threw the girl away, but she survived, and quickly fled. At the same time, Vinnichevsky did not take the child further than 1 km away from the place where he picked her up. He killed not only in the outskirts, but also near his home on Mamin-Sibiryak Street, where he kidnapped two children. The last victim - 4-year-old Taisia Morozov - after killing her, Vinnichevsky threw her body into a cesspool, placing her clothes into the front garden of the apartment building, hoping that it was there that they would search for the child's remains. The wounded victims from Vinnichevsky's attacks who were thrown into cesspools had practically no chance to escape, even if they were still alive. However, 4-year-old Raya Rahmatulina, thrown by Vinnichevsky into a cesspool, woke up and began to scream, alerting passers-by who rescued her.  Arrest  The Sverdlovsk criminal investigation department found it difficult to investigate cases of abductions of children. The kidnappings were very different - from the different locations, to the different disposal of the bodies. In addition, the surviving children could not give a clear description of the kidnapper. Finally, the parents of some of the victims did not file a complaint to the police. At the same time, the investigators made several erroneous assumptions about the murderer's identity. Everyone was sure that the killer had been convicted earlier, and, it was supposed, for crimes against the sexual inviolability of the person. It was assumed that the murderer was between 20 and 25, and looked like a teenager.Смыкалин А. С.

According to one theory, the killer was either mentally-ill or simply a degenerate. Only in the summer of 1939 were all known cases connected into one, however, the attacks in Nizhny Tagil and Kushva were not connected with the Sverdlovsk murders. In 1939, Sverdlovsk was flooded with hidden police patrols, with more than 300 people arrested. On October 24, 1939, during the commission of the crimes, Vinnichevsky was detained by three police high school cadets named Popov, Angelov and Krylov. While patrolling at the tram stop in Verkhnyaya Pyshma, the cadets noticed a tall man who was carrying a little boy into the forest. Vinnichevsky had kidnapped the 3-year-old Vycheslav Volkov, whom his mother left for a few minutes at the entrance of the family home. The killer snatched the boy quickly, and got into the tram to get away from his pursuers. The cadets followed the teenager, and found him at a time when Vinnichevsky was choking the boy. Vyacheslav was rescued, and Vinnichevsky was detained. As Boris's scarf covered his neck, Vinnichevsky had to unbutton his shirt and begin strangling Boris, leaving well-visible scrapes of skin on his fingernails.Смыкалин А. С.

This deprived Vinnichevsky of the opportunity to come up with an exculpatory version of his actions such as: \\"I wanted to fix the boy's scarf\\" or \\"loosen the button on his shirt collar\\".Смыкалин А.

Trial, sentence and execution  During the investigation, Vinnichevsky confessed to the murders, revealing that he had recorded all the murders on paper, encrypting the text. Vinnichevsky's parents brought this statement to the regional newspaper titled \\"The Ural Worker\\": The doctor of jurisprudence AS Skryalin emphasizes that the trial of Vinnichevsky was held when Soviet legislation provided for the death penalty for minors who had reached the age of 12 years. The People's Commissar for Defense, Kliment Voroshilov, on March 19, 1935, sent Stalin, Molotov and Kalinin a letter with a proposal to introduce the death penalty for children, pointing to the statistics of child crime in Moscow and, in particular, on wounding a son of the deputy prosecutor of the Soviet capital by a 9-year-old boy. Voroshilov was well acquainted with Stalin for battle of Tsaritsyn. The letter quickly gave the result in the form of a normative legal act. On April 8, 1935, a joint resolution of the CEC and the Council of People's Commissars of the USSR \\"on measures to combat juvenile delinquency\\" was promulgated, providing for the imposition of the death penalty from the age of 12. This was known abroad. The famous writer Romain Rolland, in a conversation with Stalin on June 28, 1935, questioned the humanity of such a measure. Stalin replied to him: On April 20, 1935, the top secret circular of the USSR Prosecutor's Office and the USSR Supreme Court No. 1/001537-30/002517, which was signed by the USSR Prosecutor Andrei Vyshinsky and the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR Vinokurov, is dated. The Circular explained to Prosecutor's Offices and Courts the Resolution \\"On measures to combat crime among minors\\": Тhus, the USSR prosecutor's office and the Supreme Court of the USSR virtually abolished article 22 of the Criminal Code, which explicitly abolished the execution against persons under the age of 18. On January 2, 1936, the Resolution of the Plenum of the Supreme Court of the USSR indicated that if persons who have attained the age of 12 commit crimes not listed in Article 12, but connected with violence, bodily harm, mutilation or murder, they are liable under the relevant article of the Criminal Code.Смыкалин А.

Secret circular № 1/001537 - 30/002517 also prescribed (under the proposal) prosecuting authorities and the courts to inform the prosecutor of the USSR and Chairman of the Supreme Court of the USSR \\"on all cases of criminal trial of juvenile offenders in respect of which it is possible the use of the death penalty\\".История сталинского Гулага.

The convict filed a pardon, in which he claimed that he was ready to win forgiveness in battle, and expressed desire to become a tanker, since at the time of the USSR was at war with Finland.Ракитин А. И. Социализм не порождает преступности. Серийная преступность в СССР: историко-криминалистический анализ. — Екатеринбург, М.: Кабинетный ученый, 2016. — С. 275. His clemency was denied, and he was executed.  Place of burial  In the USSR, bodies of those executed were not given to relatives for burial, but were buried in special secret places. Vinnichevsky was probably buried at 12 km of the Moscow tract.«Маски скорби» по маньяку? This is the only known burial place in the Sverdlovsk region, where the bodies of the executed were buried in the 1930s. These bodies were not divided for what they were shot for, therefore, in one mass grave, those executed for political reasons and on criminal charges, such as Vinnichevsky. In the 1990s, the burial place was turned into a memorial complex of victims of reprisals of the 1920s–1950s. On November 20, 2017, at this complex a monument titled \\"Masks of Sorrow: Europe-Asia\\" was opened, the work of a friend of Vinnichevsky, Ernst Neizvestny.  Vinnichevsky's case files and publications about him  Vinnichevsky's criminal case is No. 434. According to the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region, the archive contains four volumes of the criminal case against Vladimir Georgievich Vinnichevsky, considered by the Sverdlovsk Regional Court in 1940. They are in the fund of the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region R-148 \\"Sverdlovsk Regional Court\\" (Inventory 2). In one media in the summer of 2017, information appeared that the materials of the criminal case of Vinnichevsky had been kept secret for more than 70 years. However, according to the answer of the State Archives of the Sverdlovsk Region on March 16, 2018, the Vinnichevsky case was archived in 1991, and since then has been freely available. In January 2018, A. Rakitin published a two-volume book dedicated to Vinnichevsky, titled: \\"The Urals Monster: Chronicle of the exposure of the most mysterious serial killer of the Soviet Union\\". In this book, the author put forward a version that Vinnichevsky had an accomplice.Новая книга в «ридеро». «Уральский Монстр».

Metcalf subsequently chaired the Task Force on the Undergraduate Experience which developed a number of recommendations for enhancing undergraduate life and scholarship at Tufts.  Research  Metcalf's research area is in the areas of public finance, tax policy, energy economics, and environmental economics. According to IDEAS/REPEC, Metcalf ranks in the top three percent of economists worldwide on the basis of research. He has over 7200 citations in Google Scholar and an h-index of 39. Metcalf has published over 130 papers, book chapters, and other publications including 3 edited books.CV available at https://works.bepress.com/gilbert_metcalf/about/ His newest book, Paying for Pollution: Why a Carbon Tax is Good for America, was published by Oxford University Press at the end of 2018. = Tax Policy = Metcalf's early research focused on the fiscal interaction between federal tax policy and state and local government budgets. An early paper with Martin Feldstein challenged the view that eliminating the federal deduction for state and local taxes would affect overall spending at the state and local level. The paper did find that sub-national governments would change their portfolio of tax collections to rely less heavily on taxes that are no longer deductible and more heavily on those taxes that continue to be deductible, including business taxes. Metcalf also wrote a series of papers on the role of tax-exempt financing in state and local borrowing. Metcalf subsequently wrote a series of papers on value-added taxation that argued, among other things, that standard distributional analyses overstate the regressivity of a VAT tax. Another set of papers focused on the role of uncertainty in tax policy and its impact on investment using stochastic calculus techniques and the work by Robert Pindyck and Avinash Dixit on irreversible investment in the face of uncertainty. = Energy and Environmental Economics = In the early 1990s, Metcalf, in a series of papers with Kevin Hassett, assessed the role of federal tax policy to encourage greater energy efficiency investments in which they challenged the view that high hurdle rates for these investments reflected a market failure. They argued that a variety of alternative explanations could explain the slow take-up of energy efficient capital and that the case for a market failure necessitating government intervention had not been made. Metcalf has gone on to write other papers arguing for the role of tax policy to address market failures such as pollution that could incentivize investments in energy efficiency. Along with Don Fullerton, Metcalf has written a series of papers examining the optimal tax on pollution in a second-best world (the double dividend hypothesis). Their work focused on the role of scarcity rents to explain why the optimal tax on pollution should be less than the marginal damages from the pollutant. Other research focuses on energy security, and subsidies for energy investment and production. In one recent paper, Metcalf argues that eliminating tax incentives for oil and gas production would save roughly $4 billion a year for the federal government and have a negligible impact on energy prices and domestic production. = Climate Policy = Recently, Metcalf has focused on policy design and evaluation to address climate change. His extensive work on carbon taxation has been highly cited. He has written papers on the distributional burden of carbon taxes, arguing that the view that carbon taxes are regressive is incorrect when 1) lifetime incidence is considered; and 2) the use of proceeds from the tax is taken into account. In particular, he has argued for a revenue neutral carbon tax to avoid conflating issues of the appropriate size of the federal budget and climate policy. Recent work focuses on how a carbon tax can be designed to provide some assurance that emission reduction targets will be met over time. In particular, he has advocated for an emissions assurance mechanism (EAM) to address concerns that a carbon tax will not necessarily reduce emissions. The Climate Leadership Council has included an EAM as part of its plan. Other climate related work focuses on international linkage of regional climate policies and the role of integrated assessment models in climate policy design.

Early life  Sinha was born on 17 January 1909 in Mohalla Karachi Khana, Cawnpore to Sarat Kumari Sinha and Markand Sinha, in a Bengali family. He studied at the Christ Church College.  Revolutionary Activities  Like several revolutionaries, Sinha was a youth disappointed with the abrupt termination of the Non-cooperation Movement. Vijay Kumar and his elder brother, Raj Kumar, were recruited by Suresh Chandra Bhattacharyya. Ajoy Ghosh and Batukeshwar Dutt were his former classmates. Sinha's party name was ‘Bacchu(Hindi:बच्चू)’. Bhagat Singh met this group in Kanpur in the year 1923, after he absconded from home to avoid getting married. Sinha once asked Bhagat Singh that why the latter is unwilling to marry, Bhagat Singh responded “I don’t want to increase the number of widow in this country”. While in service of the newspaper 'Pratap'(Hindi: प्रताप), Bhagat Singh distributed pamphlets written by him and other members of HSRA. A four-page pamphlet, dated 1 January 1925 issued under signature of Bejoy Kumar, President Central Council, but in all probability the production of Sachindra Nath Sanyal, was widely distributed in Bengal, U.P and Bihar. In 1927, the party had decided that Sinha should head to Moscow to garner support from the Soviet Union. Sinha belonged to the first batch of the HSRA revolutionaries trained in making bombs, this began in Calcutta under aegis of Jatin Das. In the final verdict of the Kakori conspiracy, Jogesh Chandra Chatterjee was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment, along with Raj Kumar Sinha and others. Sinha's sister lost her mental balance because of the police oppression. While Chatterjee was kept in the Fatehgarh jail during 1928-29, Shiv Verma and Vijay Kumar Sinha were entrusted the job of getting Chatterjee's approval for getting him released from the jail . On March 3, 1928, after the duo left Fatehgarh jail, the secret police were on their trail. The duo sensed this and decided to leave immediately, they bought train tickets for Kanpur but the ticket details were soon available to the police. When the train started, two policemen seated themselves in the same compartment where the duo had reserved their seats. The duo was looking for an opportunity to abscond during the journey. Later, when the train was leaving the Jalalabad station, the duo jumped out of the train cautiously but the constables hurt themselves and couldn't chase. The duo again evaded arrest at the Kanpur station but now had accepted the fact that, henceforth, they will have to lead a life of fugitives. The compatriots often used to tease each other. One theme of teasing was how a particular revolutionary would get captured. Sinha was a movie buff and his compatriots always teased him that if he would ever get caught by the police, it would be in a cinema hall. Even if the police would arrive, he would say “I will come with you but after the movie is finished”. There was a shortage of funds to conduct the meeting at Ferozeshah, hence, Sinha sold Phanindranath's return train ticket to arrange some money. Sinha was a member of the Central Committee which was formed by the revolutionaries in the ruins of the Feroze Shah Kotla fort of Delhi on September 8 & 9, 1928. The introductory speech was given by Sinha: > “A turning point has arisen in the revolutionary movement after the Kakori > incident. Today we can clearly see where we stand. We know which kind of > path we have so far trod, the present situation, and in which direction we > have to proceed. To decide our path we have to learn something from the > Kakori incident and we have to critically examine the manner in which the > Congress is conducting the freedom movement. We have to understand from the > Kakori incident that our party is no longer a single state party and that it > should acquire the form of an All-India one. Moreover, we should > decentralize its authority. By distribution of power, I do not mean giving > the entire authority to any one person. We should create a committee which > takes its own decisions and guides us on important matters. Now for a close > examination of the Congress activities--regarding this matter, I would just > like to say that the Congress does not have a clear picture of how the > freedom of our country should be won and it is misleading the people with > the word 'Swarajya'. The public understands the meaning of 'Swarajya', as > one's own rule in the country. Despite this, Congress is desperate to accept > the abbreviated form of 'Swarajya'. I wonder why the Congress while > strengthening its movement with public support, does not tell them the > correct meaning of independence. Today the situation in the financial sector > is this that the farmers are being exploited by the landlords and the money- > lenders. On the other hand, the labourers, becoming victims of exploitation > by mill-owners, are going on strikes and the Congress is not able to use the > dissatisfaction of the farmers and labourers for the freedom struggle. > Therefore the responsibility of achieving independence has fallen on us. My > request is that the members present their opinion on whatever I have said. > We shall then come to a healthy conclusion.”. Bhagat Singh and Sinha were given the responsibility of establishing harmony among the revolutionaries of different states. Vijay Kumar Sinha & Bhagwan Das Mahaur were the third line, of both attack and defense, during the assassination attempt of Saunders. = Arrest = After the arrest of Bhagat Singh and B.K. Dutt on April 8, 1929, in Delhi, and of other revolutionaries like Sukhdev on April 15, the Punjab police discovered the link of revolutionaries led by Bhagat Singh in the assassination of Saunders. Soon, other arrests followed. An FIR was filed against 25 people in the court of Rai Sahib Pt. Sri Kishan, Special Magistrate appointed to conduct the Lahore conspiracy case. While the police produced 16 of the accused in the court on July 10, 1929, accused from 17th to 25th in the list were declared absconders. These included Chandrashekhar Azad (never arrested and martyred on February 27, 1931 in Alfred Park, Allahabad), Bejoy/Vijay Kumar Sinha (arrested later in Bareilly), Rajguru (arrested later), Bhagwaticharan Vohra (never arrested and martyred on May 28, 1930 while experimenting with a bomb at Ravi bank, Lahore), Kundan Lal (arrested last), Yashpal (noted Hindi writer (arrested in 1932 and charged with different cases), Satguru Dayal (not arrested). = Hunger Strike = Sinha, along with the other arrested revolutionaries like Jaidev Kapoor, Shiv Verma etc., joined the hunger strike in Lahore jail to express solidarity with Bhagat Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt. When Jatin Das was counting the last moments of his life, he asked his associates to sing something. Sinha sang the famous song ‘Ekla Chalo Re’, of the renowned poet Rabindranath Tagore. = Lahore Conspiracy Verdict = The Lahore Conspiracy Case ruling came on October 7, 1930. Sinha was among the revolutionaries who were sentenced to life imprisonment. Sinha was of the opinion that Bhagat Singh's hanging should be delayed, as long as possible, because it would trigger more protests and agitations against the government. Later, a fortnight before his execution, Bhagat Singh met Sinha. Bhagat Singh expressed to Sinha his desire to be hanged: > \\"It would be a calamity if I am spared. If I die, wreathed in smiles, > India’s mothers would wish their children to emulate Bhagat Singh and thus, > the number of formidable freedom fighters would increase so much that it > would be impossible for the satanic powers to stop the march of the > revolution.\\". = Imprisonment = After a stay in Rajahmundry Jail of Andhra Pradesh, Sinha was deported to the cellular jail in Andaman, along with his HSRA compatriots like Shiv Verma, Jaidev Kapoor in June 1933. Earlier, in January 1933, Dr. Gaya Prasad, Mahavir Singh, Batukeshwar Dutt, Kamal Nath Tiwari had already reached Andaman. Soon, they all went on a hunger strike as a protest against the inhumane treatment meted to the prisoners, especially, the political. During this hunger strike, Mahavir Singh died. The others who lost their lives were Mohit Maitra, Manakrishna Nabadas. The British authorities finally relented and agreed on the following demands: * Soaps to clean body * Beds to sleep * Edible food For political prisoners * Allow studying, provide books * Allow communicating among themselves Gradually, an academic environment grew within the premises of the jail. The revolutionaries like Sinha, Verma used to conduct classes for inmates and the subjects were related to materialism, political science, world history, state of the colonies, Indian society etc. He was expatriated in 1937 and released in 1938 but again detained from 1941 till 1945, thus, he was imprisoned for more than 17 years.  Later life  After Independence, Sinha joined the Communist Party of India along with his HSRA compatriots like Shiv Verma, Kishori Lal, Ajoy Ghosh, Jaidev Kapoor. He contested but got defeated in elections in Kanpur elections in 1962.  Death  Sinha passed away in Patna on July 16, 1992.

It was designed by Goold and Hilling and Edmund Blacket and built from 1858 to 1885 by Aaron Loveridge. It is also known as Graythwaite Nursing Home and Shore School. The property is owned by the Sydney Church of England Grammar School. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 November 2002.  History  In September 1832, Thomas Walker, a public official, paid A£60 and nine shillings for a land grant. On the 25 October 1833, Thomas Walker conveyed of his grant, to the north and east of where Graythwaite was later built, to William Miller, for £20 and thirteen shillings. At the time of the purchase of , Walker's address was 41 Pitt Street, Sydney. When the land was surveyed in 1832, there were no buildings on the land. By 1837, Walker had built himself a residence on his grant almost adjacent to Miller's newly built house. An 1837 plan of the Government of New South Wales Reserve on North Shore shows Walker's and Miller's houses. In January 1845 Walker drew up his will bequeathing his house \\"Euroka\\" and to his wife and he died in 1850. Three years after his death, the house and remaining land was sold to George Tuting, a mercer of Pitt Street, Sydney for £1,500. In that conveyance, the grounds are described as . Tuting held the land only briefly, possibly for the purposes of speculation at a time when land and house prices boomed in the early 1850s after the discovery of gold. He sold the house and land in 1853, for more than double what he had bought it for. The new owner, Edwin Sayers, was a shipowner who had arrived in Sydney from Melbourne about 1850. He was mainly interested in the coastal shipping trade. Sayers occupied Euroka and remained there until 1868. Sayers added a large new two storey sandstone wing , created the terracing and planted an orchard on the lower grassed area on Union Street. As a merchant seeking to utilise all of his available capital and with the problems of unexpected calls being made upon his resources, from unexpected financial crises or due to the vagaries of shipping weather, Sayers needed to use his substantial house as security for loans at times. Hence, on 23 July 1855, Tuting conveyed the house and land to Edwin Sayers, Sydney for £3,900. Sayers' financial affairs became embarrassed and he mortgaged his home. On 16 April 1860 Sayers conveyed the title to Clark Irving and others as trustees for the benefit of Sayers' creditors. On 20 April 1860 further conveyance of all of Sayers' property to trustees was signed. Sayers' financial difficulties continued until 1867 when the property was offered at auction by Richardson & Wrench, on behalf of the mortgagee, on 8 July 1867. There were no buyers. The property was next purchased by Thomas Allwright Dibbs, the manager of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney. He had been buying up many parcels of land on the North Shore. By 1882 Graythwaite was the family home of Thomas Dibbs and in 1888 the mortgage of 1882 was discharged. Dibbs, , demolished Walker's house and added to the Sayers sandstone building to complete Euroka / Graythwaite as it remains today. Dibbs was a huge landowner on the lower north shore and bought the adjoining Holtermann property when Holtermann died and later sold it to the church for Shore School. Apparently Holtermann closely guarded access to his tower and so many of the early photographic panoramas of Sydney were taken from Graythwaite instead. Most of the current garden dates from Dibbs (the fig trees can be seen as little trees protected by wooden frames from wandering stock in the 1875 photos). The garden includes a pepper berry/ white walnut (Cryptocarya obovata), a very rare rainforest species, native to northern NSW rainforests and once native to the Illawarra (apparently extinct in that district since the mid 1800s). Only one other specimen of it is known in Sydney, in Prince Alfred Park. Both may owe their presence to associations with colonial botanists James Backhouse and Allan Cunningham (who recorded the species in the Illawarra in ), and then-director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore, who did much to promote the planting of NSW and Queensland rainforest tree species on public sites. Dibbs' prestige as well as his reputation as an astute and skillful manager of the Bank underlay his renown. His management of the Bank was generally credited with saving it from the fate of other less fortunate banks in the 1890s Depression. From his interest in philanthropy, sprang the gesture which converted his family residence into a convalescent home. Like many Australians, Dibbs was apparently shocked at the carnage taking place overseas during World War I. In April 1915, Australian troops first saw action when they landed at Gallipoli. Dibbs donated his home, Graythwaite, to the state as a convalescent home for soldiers returning from the front. On 1 October 1915 the property was formally transferred by Dibbs to the Crown, in consideration of \\"my admiration of and sincere sympathy for those brave men who have so unselfishly given their services and their lives fighting for the Empire in the cause of Justice and liberty.\\" as a 'Convalescent Home for our Sick and Wounded Soldiers and Sailors and when not required for that purpose as a Convalescent Home in perpetuity for distressed subjects of the British Empire regardless of Sect or Creed.' An official opening of Graythwaite was held on 1 March 1916. Dibbs presented the deeds of Graythwaite to the Premier of New South Wales who handed the property on to the NSW branch of the Red Cross. Graythwaite was altered to fit it out as a convalescent home and was at first used for less severely ill convalescents. In 1918, the Red Cross decided that Graythwaite should be converted into a Hostel for long term cases of disablement. A change in emphasis required substantial changes to the building. Graythwaite was used as a convalescent home to 1977, when civil cases were referred by the Health Commission. The Red Cross then decided to relinquish the Hospital to enable it to be used as geriatric hospital by the Home of Peace Hospitals, under the supervision of the Health Commission. The buildings were officially handed over in December 1980.  Description  =Site and landscape= The site is situated with dual frontages to Union and Edward Streets, generally rectangular in shape with a finger of land making an \\"L\\" to Union Street. The terrace embankments and driveway north from Union street are fairly densely vegetated with mature trees and shrubs including native and exotic species and flatter areas are grassed. Vehicular and pedestrian access is obtained from both Union and Edward Streets, however the preferred and most used is Edward Street directly behind the buildings to a small visitor car park. Entry from Union Street is through a recessed entrance gateway via a formalised driveway up the south-facing slope to the front of the historic building complex. To some extent 20th century building development near the historic building group has severed and/or changed the immediate landscaped gardens but remnants of the earlier plantings still remain close to the building. Views and vistas from the building group remain substantially unaltered from site development since the late 19th century. The semi detached villas and other subdivision developments to the south and west are screened by vegetation even through they remain close by in distance terms. The land slope and terraced vegetation to the south and west substantially screen nearby urban development from view. Views and vistas of suburban Sydney, the Harbour, Parramatta River and mountains to the west are visible above the tree line. Up until its 2009 purchase of Graythwaite, The Shore School owned land immediately east and north of Graythwaite, and further west. This land all formed part of the Graythwaite estate under earlier owners, and comprises a range of buildings including houses built for Dibb's children, s, and later school development, and later. Immediately west of the property (and under it) dives a railway line tunnel (half way along the western boundary) being the main northern line to Waverton/Hornsby. This runs directly west/east under the property. The terracing on the property is thought to have been made initially for grape/vine planting, although this was abandoned at some point as unsuccessful, much of the terraces facing south, an orientation not suited to ripening fruit. Three or four major terraces face south, and an unknown number (vegetation is too dense to see as yet) to the west of the site, which is steeper. Ground levels appear to have been modified in terms of slope, as well as terracing. Much deliberate and accidental tree planting has followed on these terraces, making the site rather secluded now, with the exception of long views from the main house south/south-sou-east to the city/Pyrmont, and west/west-south-west to Balmain/Leichhardt and the river. Mature specimen trees remaining include perimeter plantings of Moreton Bay figs (Ficus macrophylla) lining boundaries to adjacent housing on Union Street (south) and Bank Street (west). These are at least 100 years old, some of them magnificent specimens, others planted closely (as windbreaks?). Mature tree specimens across the site comprise mainly figs (about 40 large specimens) being a large number of Moreton Bay figs, also Port Jackson figs (F.rubiginosa), giant bamboo to the west of the main house, and to the south- east of the main building group, firewheel tree (Stenocarpus sinuatus), pepperberry tree (north NSW rainforest species - see below), Cook's pine (Araucaria columnaris) - a very tall specimen visible across (south of) the Harbour Bridge) on this ridge, Monterey pine (Pinus radiata), four Florida palms (Washingtonia robusta) and Norfolk Island hibiscus (Lagunaria patersonae) line a carriage loop immediately south of the main house, and large numbers of white/grey poplar, Populus alba, some of which are suckers of older trees/regrowth clumps, spreading (but which probably represent earlier shelter belt or ornamental plantings of this species). Recent (late 1990s) plantings of Populus x simonii have been put in east of the drive to replace rust-affected Lombardy poplars (P.nigra 'Italica'). A carriage driveway from Union Street is lined on the west with brush box (Lophostemon confertus) and on the east by camphor laurels (Cinnamomum camphora), which appear to be at least pre 1950s, possibly 1930s. A pepper berry / white walnut tree (Cryptocarya obovata) is east of the drive towards the top, near the house. This is a very rare rainforest species, native to northern NSW rainforests and once native to the Illawarra (apparently extinct in that district since the mid 1800s) and only one other specimen of it is known in Sydney, in Prince Alfred Park. Both may owe their presence to associations with colonial botanists James Backhouse and Allan Cunnungham, and then-director of the Botanic Gardens, Sydney, Charles Moore, who did much to promote the planting of NSW and Queensland rainforest tree species. A number of fruit trees remain or have been planted in the last 10–20 years in some cases on the banks immediately west and south of the main house. These may reflect replanting of earlier orchard areas. These include citrus (oranges, lemon, mandarin), fig, loquat, pomegranate, carob, peach, banana (extensive clumps of these), a quince tree, pawpaw, white mulberry (over 40 years old) etc. ;Weed species/naturalising plants A number of \\"weedy\\" species trees, sh, although volunteers are clearing the worst of these and replanting locally native and NSW rainforest species to replace them. \\"Weeds\\" may of course represent earlier deliberate plantings, which have reproduced themselves on site, or wild seedlings introduced by visiting birds dropping seeds or regenerating naturally with relatively little disturbance/changing light conditions as mature trees fall or are removed. Species include white poplars (as above), long leaved privet (Ligustrum ovalifolium), small leaved privet (L.sinense), nettle tree (Celtis australis), camphor laurels (as above), sweet pittosporum (Pittosporum undulatum) (probably wildlings ex bird-dropped seed), brush box (as above), night cestrum (C.parqui), coral tree (Erythrina x sykesii), smooth leaved rambutan/native quince, Alectryon species (local native, some bird-seed dropped, some natural regeneration), bleedling heart tree (Omolanthus populnifolius), African olive (Olea africana), lantana (L.camara), much of which has been removed since 2000 by volunteers, asthma plant (Parietaria sp.), Madiera vine, butterfly bush (Cassia tomentosa), fennel, moth plant (Araujia sp.). =Buildings= The building group known as the site of the former Graythwaite Nursing Home is positioned on an elevated part of the site at the north eastern corner is ringed by security fencing to prevent patients straying. The remainder of land steps down to the south and west with graded embankments and flatter areas to provide a terraced effect. The three-storey substantial building with associated single storey masonry buildings is the historic building known as Graythwaite. From on site inspections it was established that the periphery of mainly single storey buildings relates to the property's use since 1916 as a convalescent and nursing hospital. Physical evaluation of the perceived historical hub buildings was carried out during the study period and reinforces the notion that the three storey sandstone building has grown from smaller building complex, possibly dating to the 1830s. The Graythwaite property comprises: # A substantial sandstone Victorian Villa with attached kitchen wings, generally two- and three-storeys respectively. Single storey sandstone outbuilding with loft (former 1830s stables) Single storey masonry outbuilding (ashlar finish) (former secretaries office and staff dining room) # Single storey brick building (former recreation room) # Single storey brick outbuilding with attic (former 1880s stables) # Single storey hospital ward building and service additions and service addition . Alterations to hospital ward (infill of verandah) . # Service yard and car park. # Associated terraced and landscaped grounds. # Recent linking building. Graythwaite is a former residence which has been altered and has grown through the 19th century from a less prominent building to a grand villa and then undergone adaptation to a convalescent hospital and nursing home after 1916. Owing to the building's development over considerable time there remains recognisable features from all stages of its development. The building can be described as having three main areas, a) the substantial sandstone Victorian Villa with attached kitchen wing, b) a single storey sandstone outbuilding with loft, c) and a single storey masonry outbuilding (ashlar finish). For further analysis of the physical evidence on site, refer to the Conservation Management Plan prepared by Graham Edds and Associates for the NSW Department of Health dated February 2000 and endorsed by the Heritage Council of NSW in August 2000. Two brick/stone lined cisterns were discovered to the west of the main house, and recently studied by Goddon Mackay Logan. One appears to be double brick lined, the other sandstone. = Condition = As at 29 October 2001, the structural condition of all buildings on the property appear to be well founded and in a structurally stable condition. The site and buildings are occupied on a day-to-day basis. The site & landscaped grounds are maintained regularly. A volunteer group is weeding the \\"bush\\" areas of the garden, and planting locally native and rainforest species to replace weeds such as nettle trees, privet, white/grey poplars, sweet pittosporum (native but weedy). = Modifications and dates = The Graythwaite group has evolved through three main phases of development: *Phase I 1830s residence and outbuildings; * terracing created, planted an orchard on the lower grassed area on Union St. Most of the current garden dates from Dibbs *Phase II 1880s major renovation; *Phase III alterations and additions since 1916 for use as a convalescent hospital and nursing home. Following the 2009 acquisition of Graythwaite by The Shore School, further extensive renovations were completed in 2014. = Further information = Zoning - site zoned special uses. Adjoining land to south and west (Union and Bank Streets) zoned 2(b), permitting two storey development, residential mainly. Commercial use site immediately south-west of GT - which has adaptively reused a former GT/Shore School building, s.  Heritage listing  As at 28 October 2016, Graythwaite is an early example of a prominent North Shore residence which has been altered extensively over its life to reflect the social standing and status of its changing ownership. The early development of the property is associated with Thomas Walker, Deputy Commissary General. His substantial two storey residence \\"Euroka\\" built in the mid 1830s is encapsulated within \\"Graythwaite\\" and together with the detached stables are arguably the earliest remaining fabric of the early settlement of North Sydney. The sandstone stables are the oldest examples of stables outbuilding in North Sydney and provides evidence of the importance of the horse for transport. The property also has strong associations with the Dibbs family and particularly Thomas Allwright Dibbs, manager of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, who was also ex-officio appointee to the Royal Commission on the Public Service of 1887-90. Its present use as a convalescent home reflects the compassion and generosity of Thomas Allwright Dibbs to provide a caring place for Australian soldiers on their return from the Great War. The grounds on which \\"Graythwaite\\" is located retains intact its size and configuration of the 1873 subdivision. It retains remnants of the extensive garden curtilage developed from that period and during Dibbs' ownership and retains those magnificent harbour views and vistas to the south and west. This property is an unusually large land parcel considering its close proximity to the CBD of North Sydney which retains substantial land terracing reinforced with mature landscaping. The buildings grand Victorian Italianate architectural form located on the highest part of the property reflects a major renovation, within the Victorian period 1880-1885 during Thomas Allwright Dibbs' ownership, to capture outstanding views and vistas of Sydney Harbour and beyond. The landmark qualities of this building is no longer apparent when viewed from its main street frontage, but the outward views and vistas from the building to the south and west are unparalled and extensive. Building alterations and additions that have occurred since 1936 and 1952 for use as a Red Cross Hospital have compromised historic fabric and the aesthetic significance of the earlier residential building complex. 'Graythwaite' is valued by the surrounding community for its historical significance as an example of North Shore residential for the wealthy. Its significance has also been established socially through its use as a convalescent home, a hostel for long term disablement and then a geriatric hospital. The main building (although altered for hospital use since 1916) retains detailed finishes, fireplaces and hardware from the Victorian period usually lost in buildings of this type in private ownership. It also contains timber floor and ceiling framing of pit sawn origins with ceilings framing connections using timber pegged tenons, further establishing its early origins and importance of \\"Euroka\\" as one of the earliest surviving structures in the North Sydney area. The former stables outbuilding with loft is a remnant of early vernacular form and formed part of the original building group on land granted to Thomas Walker in 1832. The residence and stables buildings contain remnants of all phases of the property's development and this is reflected in its high archaeological, educational and research potential. The property has been recognised by others to contain one of the largest and most significant collections of late 19th century cultural plantings in the North Sydney area. Graythwaite was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 November 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Graythwaite has historical significance as an early example of a prominent North Shore residence which has been altered extensively over its life to reflect the social standing and status of its changing ownership. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The property has strong associations with the Dibbs family and particularly Thomas Allwright Dibbs, Manager of the Commercial Banking Company of Sydney, who was also ex-officio appointee to the Royal Commission on the Public Service of 1887 - 90. Its present use as a convalescent home reflects the compassion and generosity of Thomas Allwright Dibbs to provide a caring place for Australian soldiers on their return from the Great War. The grounds on which Graythwaite is located remains intact in size and configuration of the 1873 subdivision. It retains remants of the extensive garden curtilage developed from that period and during Dibbs' ownership and retains those magnificent harbour views and vistas to the south and west. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. Graythwaite has aesthetic significance because this property is an unusually large land parcel considering its close proximity to the CBD of North Sydney which retains substantial land terracing reinforced with mature landscaping. The buildings grand Victorian Italianate architectural form located on the highest part of the property reflects a major renovation, within the Victorian period 1880 - 1885 during Thomas Allwright Dibbs' ownership, to capture outstanding views and vistas of Sydney Harbour and beyond. The landmark qualities of this building is no longer apparent when viewed from its main street frontage, but the outward views and vistas from the building to the south and west are unparalleled and extensive. Remnant landscape elements and plantings are evident over the entire site area. These remnants are in the form of mature isolated and group plantings nearby the building group but extend to the terraced forecourt in rows and clusters on the terrace embankments. Other mature plantings line the driveway entrance from Union Street and extend to the main building then to the west and links up with the car parking areas at the 1880s coach house and Edward Street public car park. To the south and west, remant landscape plantings provide a dense barrier to the immediate suburban development. Distant views and vistas over the top of the landscape provide a pleasant outlook. Formalised garden plots and pathways are located between several of the buildings. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. Graythwaite is socially significant to the surrounding community for its historical significance as an example of North Shore residence for the wealthy. Its significance has also been established socially through its use as a convalescent home, a hostel for long term disablement and then a geriatric hospital. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Graythwaite has technical/research significance because the main building (although altered for hospital use since 1916) retains detailed finishes, fireplaces and hardware from the Victorian period usually lost in buildings of this type in private ownership. It also contains timber floor and ceiling framing of pit sawn origins with ceiling framing connections using timber pegged tenons, further establishing its early origins and importance as one of the earliest surviving structures in the North Sydney area. The former stables building with loft is a remnant of early vernacular form and formed part of the original building group on land granted to Thomas Walker in 1832. The buildings contain remnants from all phases of the property's development and this is reflected in its high archaeological, educational and research potential. The property has been recognised to contain one of the largest and most significant collections of late 19th century cultural plantings in the North Sydney area. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The highest levels of significance of Graythwaite then relates to its associations with the early development of North Sydney and not necessarily its Convalescent Hospital use. With regard to its historic, aesthetic and technological/research criterion, Graythwaite retains remnants both in its building fabric and its landscape from the earliest development of the North Shore and is considered rare and of state significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The social criterion is assessed as representative, reflecting the choice of the North Shore, particularly North Sydney, for development of substantial residences and its later association with health care since 1916.

It was located in Ribbleton Preston off Longridge Road. The closure of the works was announced in November 1979 and the issue raised in the UK Parliament House of Commons by the constituency MP. At the time of closure approximately 2600 people were employed there but there were approximately 4000 at its peak. It was the largest rayon producing site in Britain. Two main products were manufactured with one being tyre cord by a process known as CSPT - Continuous Spinning Process Tenasco. Two main denier of this product were manufactured. The other product was a general textile called Bright. A range of deniers of this were produced in a range of colours. The trade name for the coloured product was Duracol. At the time of closure, one reason given by management for the closure was the rising popularity of steel belt radial tires thus reducing demand for tyre cord. The factory was connected by rail as a branch of what was the Preston and Longridge Railway. The plant had its own power production facility. The main raw materials brought in by rail were coal, sulfuric acid, sodium hydroxide, carbon disulfide and wood pulp.  Buildings on site  The site had its own power station which was coal burning and a boiler house and turbine room housing Parsons Peebles turbines. This resulted in two cooling towers and two large power station chimneys which were very visible points on the Preston landscape. The cooling towers were very close to the Preston By-pass, now part of the M6 motorway. As well as a laboratory there was a textile testing room, boiler house, turbine room, box spinning, CSPT, effluent plant, acid recovery, zinc recovery, churn room, mixing room, dialyzer house, maintenance workshop, offices, cake ageing rooms, coneing, cakewash, carbon disulfide mixing arc, steeping room, mercerizing room, condux mill passage, fume scrubbing and viscose alley containing east and west viscose ageing and storage caves View of Courtaulds Chimneys with Boiler House visible in background and a caustic soda tank train delivering Courtaulds Red Scar Works Laboratory Courtaulds Red Scar Works textile testing room  Chemical processes  Rayon production was by the viscose process. This started by taking Cellulose in the form of wood pulp and steeping in caustic soda solution. The caustic soda was then drained and the pulp sheets pressed to remove residual alkali. The product is sodium cellulose hydroxide at this stage. The pressings and caustic soda were recovered by dialysis in the dialyser house. The steeped wood pulp sheets were then shredded with Condux mills and the product (called alkcell short for alkaline cellulose) stored in bins at controlled temperature. After suitable ageing, carbon disulfide was added and mixed in churns in the churn room to produce an orange coloured xanthate, chemically sodium cellulose xanthate. The contents were then dropped into mixers in the mixing room and dilute caustic soda added and mixed for a length of time. This viscous liquid was then passed through granulators to grind up the chunks of xanthate. This viscous liquid - viscose - was then filtered, deaerated, and passed into storage tanks in the viscose caves in controlled temperature and ageing conditions. The next stage is spinning of the yarn. In spinning, whether box spinning or CSPT, the principle is the same. Viscose is extruded through a spinneret (polymers) into a batch of hot dilute acid also containing sodium sulphate and zinc sulphate along with other additives. Rayon was produced and loaded onto cakes of yarn or bobbins in the case of CSPT. In the case of Duracol, pigment was injected into the viscose just before spinning, creating a dye-fast yarn. The hot spent dilute acid from the spin baths was sent for recycling in the acid recovery building. Other waste acidic streams were sent to the zinc recovery building where the liquors were passed into tanks containing ion-exchange resin. The recycled product was an acid stream rich in zinc sulfate which was fed back into the hot dilute acid baths by means of weirs. Cakes of yarn were aged in controlled heat and humidity ageing cabinets and then sent through the cakewash process. This consisted of prewashes and then washing with sodium sulfide solution. A rinse then bleach wash followed by another very dilute acid wash and finally rinsing was then performed. The yarn was then dried in tunnel drier ovens. After this the yarn was sent to coning where the yarn was threaded onto cones for ease of handling and sale.

Sir Francis Gerald William Knowles, 6th baronet (9 March 1915 - 13 July 1974) was a distinguished research biologist of elegant and pioneering achievement Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society Vol 21 1975 by E. J. W. Barrington FRS , a Fellow of the Royal Society, who held the chair of anatomy at King's College London where he was Dean, to which he had come by a somewhat unorthodox route. He was, as The Times put it, \\"a fundamental scientist of outstanding calibre\\" L. Vollrath - Journal of Neural Transmission 35, 255-256 (1974) Family and early life This family is descended from Charles Knollys, titular 4th Earl of Banbury temp James 11. He was the sixth of his line since his great, great, great grandfather, Sir Charles Knowles, 1st Baronet, admiral, was created a baronet for purely naval services in 1765. Of the first five holders of the title, three had been named Charles and became admirals. Knowles, like his great grandfather, another Francis, a Fellow of the Royal Society and his own father yet another Francis, pursued a scientific career. Knowles was born at Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, where his father Francis Howe Seymour Knowles, Sir Francis Knowles, 5th Baronet, held the post of Physical Anthropologist for the Anthropological Division of the Geological Survey of Canada (now part of the Canadian Museum of Civilisation) from 1912 to 1919 when he returned to England on his succession to his own father’s baronetcy. (His father Vice Admiral Sir Charles Knowles, 4th Baronet, whilst stationed on the Newfoundland coast had met his mother, the Canadian Mary Ellen Thomson, the grand daughter of the Hon Joseph Howe, Lt Gov of Nova Scotia, and this may have influenced Knowles' decision to accept a post in Canada in 1912.) Knowles was educated back in England, at Radley College and at Oriel College, Oxford, graduating BA from the honour school of zoology in 1936. Following graduation, he was awarded the Oxford University Naples scholarship, which enabled him to carry out research at the Stazione Zoologica between 1937–8. He began investigating the role of hormones in the regulation of colour change in lampreys and crustaceans. He was awarded his MA and PhD in 1939. Career When his scholarship ended in 1938 Knowles took up the post of senior biology master at Marlborough College in Wiltshire. Whilst at Marlborough he published several biological texts, including 'Man and other Living Things (1945), Diagrams of Human Biology (1950),'Biology and Man' (1950), Freshwater and Salt-water Aquaria (1953), and Endocrine Control in Crustaceans (1959) with David B. Carlisle. He also continued his researches on crustacean colour change, working during school holidays at marine biological laboratories with support from the Royal Society and the Nuffield Foundation. During this period he published many papers, most of them dealing specifically with the control of pigment movement and colour change. The choice of crustaceans as his experimental animals (made, as he remarked, because no Home Office licence was required for invertebrates) was a happy one R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387..These activities gave his pupils an insight into scientific research that would have been found in very few other schools during this period. In his later years at Marlborough, Knowles became aware of the new perspectives that had been opened in comparative endocrinology through the discovery of neurosecretion: the process by which certain nerve cells secrete hormones into the bloodstream. He was quick to exploit this concept, making skilful use of a variety of new techniques, including use of the electron microscope, which became his special interest. Meanwhile, by 1939, he had both an M.A. and D.Phil., and in 1949 was awarded the Browne Fund Scholarship of the Royal Society. He then spent a sabbatical term in Bermuda R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387., and in 1953 received a Nuffield Foundation Scholarship. 1958 was to be a crucial year for Knowles. Professor Sir Solly (later Solly Zuckerman, Baron Zuckerman), whilst chairing a biological meeting at Cold Spring Harbor in the United States, had been deeply impressed by the quality of Knowles' contributions. Zuckerman had known Knowles from when he had been an undergraduate in Oxford, and was already familiar with his work on invertebrate neurosecretion. He asked Knowles whether Marlborough could offer opportunities for carrying on his work. When Knowles replied that it could not, Zuckerman undertook to try to persuade the medical faculty at the University of Birmingham to appoint him to a lectureship in the Department of Anatomy there. As Knowles knew nothing of human gross anatomy (although a lot about comparative micro-anatomy) such an appointment was, to say the least, exceptional. It is greatly to the credit of the Birmingham medical faculty of that time that faith in the Department of Anatomy was sufficient to gain acceptance of Zuckerman's views, and Knowles moved from Marlborough to take up a University appointment R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387.. Quickly establishing himself as a dynamic biologist, satisfied with nothing less than perfection in technique Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society Vol 21 1975 by E. J. W. Barrington FRS , Knowles expanded his researches to include the study of neurosecretory pathways in the brain and pituitary gland of the dogfish and, later, of the rhesus monkey. His observations and his manner of presenting them provided a strong (and sometimes provocative) stimulus to the many biologists who had also discovered the fascination of neurosecretory systems. His papers at scientific meetings were remembered as beautifully clear expositions of his theses, and usually gave rise to lively discussion R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387.. His flair for organization also showed itself in 1962, when he was largely responsible for the planning behind a NATO Advanced Study Institute on Techniques in Endocrine Research which was held at Stratford upon Avon. His studies brought him a Readership in 1963, and \\"for his great contributions to science L. Vollrath - Journal of Neural Transmission 35, 255-256 (1974) \\" election as Fellow of the Royal Society in 1966 and a personal Chair, with the title of Professor of Comparative Endocrinology, in 1967 R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387.. In that year, however, he moved to the University of London as professor of anatomy at King's College London. At King's, Knowles soon abandoned primate research and turned once again to fish, despite the obvious difficulties of working on these animals from a London base. He took a full share in administration, serving with distinction as dean. It was perhaps during these last years that his skill as a chairman of committees became truly apparent, and he played a significant role in College affairs. He was also a member of several Royal Society Committees, including the Browne Research Fund Committee, and the Naples Zoological Station Committee (from its establishment in 1960). He represented the Royal Society on the Scientific Research in Schools Committee from 1971, and was the representative of the Nuffield Foundation on the Royal Society Commonwealth Bursaries Committee from June 1972. He was Chairman of the Biological Sciences Committee of the Science Research Council and a member of the Council of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom. One of his major concerns was the furthering of research links between young biologists in Britain and other European countries R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp.385-387. In September 1973 he organized the sixth international symposium on neurosecretion, which was held in London. He took particular pleasure in the task, for this was the twentieth anniversary of the first symposium, where he had presented the results of his pioneering crustacean studies. \\" He opened the programme with a brilliant retrospective address on \\"Twenty Years of Neuroscretion\\" Howard A Bern and Berta V Scharrer - General and Comparative Endocrinology 24, p.446-447 1974 Academic Press, Inc . He died suddenly at the comparatively young age of 59 at his flat in London the following year in 1974 before completing the editorial work on the volume summarising the proceedings of the symposium (Neurosecretion - the final endocrine pathway.) Howard A Bern and Berta V Scharrer - General and Comparative Endocrinology 24, p.446-447 1974 Academic Press, Inc . In a fitting tribute from his fellow editors at Springer-Verlag they recalled \\" a highly distinguished investigator, a scholar with unusually broad interest, a man with a keen, analytical mind and critical judgement who enjoyed life to the fullest. His vibrant personality radiated warmth and excitement: his presence always added lustre to a scientific gathering.\\" Cell and Tissue Research oct 1974 Vol 152 Family and personal life In 1948 Knowles married Ruth Jessie Brooke-Smith, the daughter of the Rev Arther Brooke-Smith. They had one son, Charles Francis (b. 1951) who succeeded to the baronetcy, and three daughters, as well as a stepdaughter born to Ruth and her first husband, Dickie Hulse, an RAF fighter pilot killed in action during the second world war. In 1953 he succeeded to the baronetcy on the death of his father and in 1955 purchased Avebury Manor from Alexander Keiller, FSA, whose excavations of the Avebury Stone Circle had been ended by the outbreak of war in 1939. Restoration of the Manor became an absorbing love. \\"Many would remember Francis as a most excellent host, whether in the elegantly furnished rooms of his house in Edgbaston or in later years at his flat in Mayfair. Particularly memorable, however, was his hospitality at his beautiful Elizabethan house at Avebury, where he and his wife, Ruth, entertained so many people R. L. Holmes - J. Anat. (1975), 119, 2, pp. 385–387.). The house was first opened to the public in May 1956, but also served as a grand family home. Set against this background, remote from academic biology, he appeared to one of his colleagues as ‘a fascinating man who would really have been more at home in the eighteenth century’. To another he gave proof that ‘one could be both a distinguished scholar and a warm vibrant person’ Oxford Dictionary of National Biography - E. J. W. Barrington FRS . Knowles died in London on 13 July 1974. He is buried in the village churchyard at St. James Avebury, next to the house which he had lovingly restored to ensure its survival.  References  .

Early on in his time with the club he made two appearances as they were then in the second division during the 2002-03 season. However, following the bankruptcy of Lausanne-Sport the following season, Pimenta joined BSC Young Boys. After initially playing with the side's academy team, he would go on to feature for the reserves but a lack of goals kept him from maintaining a place in the squad. This prompted the player to seek more playing time elsewhere on loan, joining Portuguese club C.F. União de Coimbra then playing in the fourth-tier. Following a stay of a year and a half there, he returned to Switzerland and left Young Boys for FC Biel-Bienne where he remained for only six months. He then joined FC Baulmes of the third division where he managed an impressive 14 goals in nine matches which drew the attention of his former club FC Lausanne-Sport, now back in the Swiss Challenge League, transferring in the latter part of the 2008-09 season. The highlight of his time during his second stint with Lausanne came as helped the club in their run to the 2010 Swiss Cup final, along the way scoring in the quarter-finals against his former team BSC Young Boys, although they would go to lose to FC Basel in the end. Released at the end of the season, Pimenta would go on to claim a succession of one year contracts with several clubs including FC Stade Nyonnais, FC Lugano, and FC Chiasso. In the summer of 2013, the player rejoined FC Lausanne-Sport for a third time although as the club currently play in the Swiss Super League he will finally get his chance to feature in Switzerland's top division.

In 2013 her research study on masculinity in Highland men between 1760 and 1840 was subject to media attention, when it received criticism from Gaelic writer Angus Peter Campbell. Abrams studied the records of courts in Inverness and found a model of \\"disciplined masculinity\\" which subsumed a previously more lawless and violent Highland culture. Campbell argued the research was flawed because of the difficulty of understand Highland society at that time without a knowledge of Gaelic. In 2015 Abrams led a research project on the experiences of those who were rehoused in high rise flats in Glasgow in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the 20th-century, this system would form the basis of the thaat system that is used in Hindustani classical music today. Some portions of the Chaturdandiprakashika are now lost. Description In Carnatic music, a mela is a scale of svaras in ascending order in a melodic unit forms the basis and gives birth to ragas. While the concept of melas is said to have been introduced by Vidyaranya in the 14th century, and a number of other musicologists before Venkatamakhin had expounded on the subject, there was a lack of a standard work that systematically classified the ragas of classical music. Vijayaraghava Nayak () commissioned Venkatamakhin to prepare such a treatise which led to the creation of the Chaturdandiprakashika. The title translates to \\"the illuminator of the four pillars\\" (of music). It alludes to a system of four divisions of composition, namely (rhythmically free exposition of a raga), (melodic inflection), (vocal composition in a raga) and prabandha (a compositional structure). The work led to the creation of the melakarta system of classification and the formulation of the 72 mela (or parent) ragas that are the foundation of the classical music of South India today. In the early 20th-century, Vishnu Narayan Bhatkhande, a musicologist from Bombay, chanced upon the Chaturdandiprakashika and used its melakarta system as the basis for the thaat system that is currently used to organise and classify ragas in Hindustani classical music.

He composed lieder, song cycles, ballads, chamber music and organ music, but is better known for standard works in German on parapsychology. He was a professor of church music at the University of Rostock from 1929.  Life  Mattiesen was born in Dorpat. The son of Emil Karl Johann Mattiesen (1835–1888), an editor- in-chief and town councillor, and Emilie (née Strümpell; 1846–1917), daughter of the philosopher and pedagogue Ludwig Strümpell, he attended a private school, the Kollmann'sche Privat-Lehranstalt, in his hometown. He received musical instruction at age 16. He completed school with the Abitur in 1892 at the gymnasium in Mitau. He studied philosophy, natural sciences and music, first in Dorpat, then from 1893 at the University of Leipzig. He had to interrupt his studies due to illness in the fall of 1894, and continued in 1895, first again in Dorpat, and from October 1895 again in Leipzig, where he received a PhD in 1896, writing about the philosophical critique in the work of John Locke and George Berkeley. Mattiesen travelled in Asia and America from 1898 to 1903, learning several Asian languages and the basics of Hinduism and other religions. From 1904 to 1908, he studied at the University of Cambridge and in London. He wrote his first major book, completed in 1914 but not published until 1925: Der jenseitige Mensch. Eine Einführung in die Metapsychologie der mystischen Erfahrung (Man of the Next World. An Introduction to the Metapsychology of the Mystical Experience). When he returned to Germany in 1908, he lived in Berlin, where he married and focused on music. He lived in Fürstenfeldbruck, Bavaria, for several years. He founded an association for the publication of his works in Munich in 1921. In 1925, he moved to the village of Gehlsdorf, now part of Rostock. He was a lecturer on church music at the Theological Faculty of the University of Rostock from 1929. He was a composer of Lieder, especially ballads, and of chamber and organ music. His compositions were published by Henri Hinrichsen, on a recommendation by Hugo Wolf, including 17 Liederhefte (song collections). He composed lieder for the contralto Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, and accompanied her in performances. These lieder included \\"Selige Sehnsucht\\" (Blissful longing), \\"Die kleine Passion\\" (The little passion) and \\"Philomele\\". A review in the journal Die Musik from February 1914 reports a recital in which she premiered five songs and mentions the composer's talent for humorous topics, such as \\"Jedem das seine\\" after a poem by Eduard Mörike. He also researched and published in the field of parapsychology. His two main books in the field, Der jenseitige Mensch (published in 1925) and Das persönliche Überleben des Todes: eine Darstellung der Erfahrungsbeweise (The Personal Survival of Death: An Account of the Empirical Evidence) in three volumes (1936–1939), became standard works in German. In his magnum opus Das persönliche Überleben des Todes, he advocated the survival hypothesis, listing several phenomena which seem to prove empirically that the soul lives on after death. The Nazis objected to the topic, which caused his work to be neglected at first. Mattiesen died in Rostock of leukemia shortly after the beginning of World War II.

The objective of the program was “to develop a fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena, including aspects of human attackers, cyber defenders, and end users, so that fundamental laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models can be applied to a broad range of Army domains, applications, and environments.” Collaborative Technology and Research Alliances is a term for partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry and academia for performing research and technology development intended to benefit the US Army. The partnerships are funded by the US Army.  History  Since approximately 1992, ARL formed a number of partnerships that involved the triad of industry, academia and government. One of them was the Cyber Security Collaborative Research Alliance (CSCRA) which was awarded on September 20, 2013. The program was expected to be completed in September 2022.  Objectives  Recognizing the need to address the growing threat of attacks on its cyber networks, the U.S. Army launched CSCRA. The alliance conducted research to advance the theoretical foundations of cyber science in the context of U.S. Army networks. According to the Army, research into cybersecurity is critical due to “the growing number and sophistication of attacks on military cyber networks coupled with the ever-increasing reliance on cyber systems to conduct the Army’s mission.” The ultimate goal of this research was the rapid development of cyber tools that could be used to dynamically assess cyber risks, detect hostile activities on friendly networks, and support agile maneuvers in cyber space in addressing novel threats. Objectives of CSCRA included development of the following: * Fundamental understanding of cyber phenomena, including human aspects * Laws, theories, and theoretically grounded and empirically validated models * Concepts applicable to a broad array of Army domains, applications, and environments  Research Thrusts  The CSCRA program was organized around several research thrusts, including the following: * Risk, Detection, Agility  Participants  The research under this program was performed collaboratively by scientists of the US Army Research Laboratory and by scientists and engineers of the following institutions: * Army Research Laboratory *Pennsylvania State University *Carnegie Mellon University *Indiana University *University of California at Davis *University of California Riverside * Applied Communication Sciences  Results  Examples of research results developed by the CSCRA program include the following: * Four publicly available datasets generated using a testbed with simulated benign users and a manual attacker. The datasets were created to provide examples of cyber exploitations and aid in the production of reproducible research that addresses cyber security challenges. An adaptive cyber deception system that provided a virtual network view to each host in an enterprise network, capable of detecting malicious activities resulting from intrusions and probing.

As a juvenile in 2005 she showed high-class form, winning four of her seven races including the Star Stakes and the Prix du Calvados. In the following year she finished second in the 1000 Guineas before recording her biggest win in the Prix de Diane. She failed to win in four subsequent races although she ran second in the Premio Lydia Tesio and was not disgraced when finishing fifth in the Champion Stakes. She has had some success as a broodmare. Background Confidential Lady is a bay mare bred and owned by the Newmarket-based Cheveley Park Stud. She was trained throughout her racing career by Mark Prescott at the Heath House stable in Newmarket and ridden in all but one of her races by Seb Sanders. She was sired by Singspiel, an international campaigner whose wins included the Canadian International Stakes, Japan Cup, Dubai World Cup, Coronation Cup, and International Stakes. The best of his other progeny include Moon Ballad Solow and Dar Re Mi. Confidential Lady's dam Confidante showed modest racing ability, winning two minor races in 1998, and was a daughter of Won't She Tell, a half sister to Affirmed. Racing career =2005: two-year-old season= On her racecourse debut, Confidential Lady started the 2/1 favourite for a maiden race over six furlongs at Hamilton Park Racecourse on 8 June and finished third behind Original Source and Rainbow Bay. Three weeks later she started 5/6 favourite for a similar event over seven furlongs on firm ground at Catterick and recorded her first success as she led from start and came home three and a half lengths clear of her seven opponents. Three days after her win at Catterick, the filly was back on the track for a minor event at Beverley Racecourse and won again, making all the running and finishing two lengths in front of Jeu de Mot. On 21 July Confidential Lady was stepped up in class for the Listed Star Stakes over seven furlongs at Sandown Park and was made the 11/2 second favourite in an eleven-runner field. She went to the front soon after the start, went clear of the field in the last quarter mile and won \\"comfortably\\" from the favourite Vague (runner-up in the Albany Stakes) with Nasheej in third place. Confidential Lady was moved up in class again for the Group 3 Sweet Solera Stakes at Newmarket Racecourse on 6 August and started the 11/4 second favourite behind Spinning Queen. She took lead at halfway but was caught in the final strides and beaten a head by Nasheej. Two weeks after her defeat at Newmarket, the filly was sent to France to contest the Prix du Calvados over 1400 metres on very soft ground at Deauville Racecourse. Ridden by the French jockey Jean-Bernard Eyquem she led from the start and kept on strongly to win by one and a half lengths from the Criquette Head-trained favourite Quiet Royal. For her final run of the year, Confidential Lady returned to France for the Group 1 Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp Racecourse on 2 October. She raced in second place for most of the way but weakened in the closing stages and came home tenth of the fourteen runners behind Rumplestiltskin. =2006: three-year-old season= Confidential Lady began her second campaign in the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket on 7 May and started at odds of 12/1 in a thirteen-runner field. She tracked the front- running Speciosa for most of the way but was unable to close the gap in the final stages and was beaten two and a half lengths into second place. Those finishing behind included Nasheej, Spinning Queen, Rumplestiltskin, Nannina and Donna Blini. Three weeks later the filly was made the 5/2 favourite for the Irish 1000 Guineas on heavy ground at the Curragh but after leading for most of the way she tired in the last quarter mile and came home sixth of the fifteen runners behind Nightime. On 11 June Confidential Lady was sent to France again for the Prix de Diane over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse and was made the 8/1 fifth choice in the betting by British bookmakers but went off at 43/1 on the French pari-mutuel. Germance (Prix Saint-Alary) started favourite, while the best fancied of the other fourteen runners were Daltaya (Prix de la Grotte), Alloway (Prix Cléopâtre) and Queen Cleopatra (Derrinstown Stud 1,000 Guineas Trial). In a change of tactics Confidential Lady was retrained by Sanders in the early stages before moving up on the inside to make the final turn in fifth place. She was switched to the left in the straight, overtook the leader Germance 200 metres and won by one and a half lengths from the favourite with Queen Cleopatra a nose away in third. Her winning time of 2:05.9 equaled the race record set by Lypharita in 1985. Mark Prescott, who was winning a first classic race in a 35-year training career said \\"We were lucky with the draw, we were lucky knowing that there would be a strong pace and we were very lucky that the filly was tough enough to take a race like this only two weeks after that slightly disappointing run in Ireland. But she'll have a bit of a breather now, which she thoroughly deserves\\". Five weeks after her win at Chantilly, Confidential Lady was stepped up in distance for the Irish Oaks over one and a half miles at the Curragh but made little impression and came home fifth of the six runners behind Alexandrova. After break of almost three months the filly returned at Newmarket in October when she was the only three-year-old filly in the eight- runner field for the Champion Stakes over ten furlongs. She ran fifth behind the six-year-old mare Pride with Sir Percy and Notnowcato finishing behind. Confidential Lady ended her season with a trip to Italy for the Premio Lydia Tesio over 2000 metres at Capannelle Racecourse in Rome in which she was beaten into second place by the German-trained four-year-old Floriot. Confidential Lady returned for one more race in 2007 but showed no signs of her old form as she came home last of the fourteen runners in the Doonside Cup at Ayr Racecourse on 22 September. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Confidential Lady was retired to become a broodmare at Cheveley Park. Her offspring include: *Code Cracker, a filly, foaled in 2009, sired by Medicean. Failed to win in three races. *Privacy Order, bay filly, 2010, by Azamour.

Born in Nantwich on an unknown date, Heath became clerk to a solicitor in 1844. This proved successful, and in 1851 he moved to Nottingham, becoming clerk to the borough coroner. This position enabled him to train as a solicitor in his own right, and he qualified in 1861. He formed a partnership with John Buttery, a Tory agent, with Heath specialising in representing trade unions and companies.John Rowley, Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.V, pp.107-109 Heath was a keen temperance activist, a founder of the Nottingham Christian Temperance Society in 1851, and also of the Nottingham branch of the United Kingdom Alliance. He was also active in the Nottingham Mechanics' Institute, taking a particular interest in debates held there. In the late 1850s, Heath became active in the Chartist movement and, in particular, of Ernest Charles Jones. He helped organise Jones' unsuccessful candidacies in Nottingham at the 1857 and 1859 UK general elections, then in the 1861 by-election he backed independent liberal Robert Juckes Clifton. This inspired Heath to enter politics himself, and in 1863 he won the St Ann's ward on Nottingham Town Council as an independent liberal. During the mid-1860s, Heath was active in the Reform League, and he was elected as County Coroner with the backing of league members. He was also active in the Nine Hours Movement. He stood in the 1874 UK general election in Nottingham as a Liberal- Labour candidate, with the sponsorship of the local trades council. The election proved close-fought, but Heath could take only fifth place. By this point, Heath's health was failing, and he resigned from the council in 1875, dying in 1880.

Bower practiced medicine in Detroit, Michigan before returning to Ann Arbor, Michigan where from 1896 to 1904, she owned, published, and edited a county paper, the Ann Arbor Democrat. For nine years, she was a member of the Ann Arbor board of education, during such time holding the office of president and treasurer. She served as treasurer of the Michigan Woman's Press Association, secretary-treasurer of the Michigan State Fraternal Congress, and held the office of president of the National Fraternal Press Association. She was the Great Record Keeper of the Ladies of the Maccabees (L. O. T. M.). Early years and education Emma E. Bower was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 1852. Her father, Henry Bower, was a dry-goods merchant of Ann Arbor for many years and in later life was a publisher in the newspaper field. Her mother, the former Margaret Gertrude Chase, was a native of New York. In the family were six children: Henry E. H., Emma E., Margaret V., Charles, Dwight, and Burroughs Frank. Bower attended public-school in Ann Arbor, and after completing her more specifically literary education entered the University of Michigan Medical School, from which she was graduated in 1883. Career Believing that the city offered the largest field for usefulness, Bower took up her residence in Detroit, Michigan, where she enjoyed a successful practice as assistant physician for two years. At the end of that time, a serious illness in her father's family caused her to give up her practice and return home to assist her family. The Ann Arbor Democrat was founded in September, 1878, by her brother, B. Frank Bower and Col. John L. Burleigh, young Bower being its editor, but four years later he accepted a daily newspaper position in Detroit, and his brother, Henry E. H. Bower, became editor-in-chief of the Democrat, and was assisted in his editorial work by his sister, Emma. His failing health threw more and more of the work upon her, and upon his death, April 30, 1888, she took full possession and had absolute control of the paper thereafter. She did all the work of an editor-in-chief, collected and wrote up all the news, solicited advertisements, personally attended to all the departments of the paper and never failed to send out a number every Friday in the year. Bower served as the lady commander of Arbor Hive No. 113, L. O. T. M. In 1893, she was elected to the office of Great Record Keeper of the L. O. T. M., an organization with a membership of 86,000, with headquarters in Ann Arbor. In this position, she had 30 assistants, and with them, published a club newspaper, The Lady Maccabee. Established in 1890, Bower served as editor of The Lady Maccabee, was published by The Inland Press, and had a circulation average during 1896 of more than 31,000, and in 1897, of more than 35,000. She was also involved with the Secretaries' Association, an auxiliary of the National Fraternal Congress, which was composed of over fifty of the leading fraternal beneficiary societies In September, 1894, Bower was elected a member of the Ann Arbor school board and served as president, secretary and treasurer. Affiliations Emma E. Bower Bower was a member of the Michigan Woman's Press Association and served on its executive committee; secretary and treasurer of the Michigan Fraternal Congress; president of the National Fraternal Press Association; vice president, \\"The Homeopathic Alumni of the University of Michigan; and vice president of the International Council of Women.

It ceased publication when it was merged with the existing publication Worcester Democrat to form the Worcester County Messenger. It was founded by T. H. Moore and George M. Upshur to consistently promote Democratic politics, which in turn reflected the conservative attitudes of the population of Worcester County. The Messenger provided both coverage of local events and social happenings as well as the biggest news stories from across the country. The front page often featured excerpts of novels or short stories, poetry, jokes, and entertaining facts. As a result of the expansion of the regional railroad system in 1874, Ocean City, Maryland began to rise in popularity as a resort town; a consequence of this was a subsequent increase in the Messenger's printing of advertisements and news for Ocean City.  History  George M. Upshur, one of the two original owners of the Democratic Messenger, was a prominent local lawyer and Yale University graduate in addition to being elected Speaker of the Maryland House of Delegates in 1888. His political aspirations were echoed in the pages of the Messenger, which held a conservative Democratic political stance. By 1881, ownership of the paper had passed to Littleton Dennis, whose family had deep roots in Worcester County. Dennis sold the paper only a few years later, in 1887, to local publisher of Salisbury paper Wicomico Record Clarence L. Vincent and his co-owner Oscar M. Purnell, a prominent banker whose large Colonial Revival home remains a historical site to this day. In 1902, Coriolanus V. White purchased Purnell's half-interest and joined Vincent in publishing the Messenger. William G. Kerbin Jr. purchased the Democratic Messenger in 1945 and personally served as its publisher while his wife, Margaret Howard, directed daily printing operations. The Kerbins sold the paper in 1973, and it was merged with the Worcester Democrat to create the Worcester County Messenger. The Messenger's headquarters for most of its existence were located at the corner of Pearl and Market Streets, across from the Worcester County courthouse.

She is remembered as a pioneer who opened higher education and professional careers to women. Biography Rosa Rojas Castro was born on 29 June 1919 in Tocaima, in the Cundinamarca Department, located in central Colombia. After earning a bachelor's degree in literature at the Alice Block Institute in Bogotá in 1937, she enrolled in legal courses at the Universidad Externado de Colombia. When she completed her doctorate in law and political science on 14 June 1942, she became the first woman in the country to earn a university degree. Though she completed the requirements to become a lawyer, a lawsuit was filed challenging her right to practice law, using the argument that if women had no political identity, they could not act on behalf of the public. Her professors served as her legal team and successfully argued that women could hold public office, confirming that she was the first woman lawyer in the country. On 1 July 1943, she was appointed to serve as the Third Judge of the Bogotá Circuit of the Superior Court. The controversy over Rojas' appointment was carried in local newspapers and on the radio, galvanizing professional women to form the Unión Femenina de Colombia (UFC) (Women's Union of Colombia) in 1944 to fight for equal rights and opportunity for women. She worked in the Penal Courts from 1943 to 1947 and simultaneously taught at the Universidad Javeriana until 1945. Then in 1947, she was appointed as the Judge of First Instance for the Criminal Court of Facatativá, where she served until her death on 22 October 1959 from encephalitis.

Early life  Voronenko was born in the Osh Region into the family of an electrician and a kindergarten teacher. In his childhood, he liked to choke cats and dogs.На счету маньяка четыре убитые девочкиУголовный розыск. Петроград – Ленинград – Петербург. Насиловал, а потом душил… After graduating the 10th grade, he did not have a permanent job. In 1987, Voronenko moved to the Ukrainian city of Krivyi Rih, where he graduated from the vocational school for the welder specialty. In 1989 Voronenko was sentenced to 3 years of correctional labor at construction sites in the Crimea for theft. Shortly before his release, he stole a bottle of brandy and a phone from his shift manager, for which he was added another 2 years of correctional labor. In 1997-1999, he received a suspended sentence on three occasions for \\"causing serious harm to health in excess of the limits of self-defense\\" and theft. In 2004, he was sentenced to 5 years in prison, serving his term in the Kresty Prison for 2 confirmed rapes in 2000 and 2001, most of the punishment being absorbed by the term of stay under investigation. In March 2005, just over 3 years and 3 months from the date of arrest, Voronenko was released on parole for good behaviour. The rapist was to be deported to the place of citizenship - Ukraine, but the supervising authorities did not pay proper attention to Voronenko, so after his last arrest, numerous accusations were made against certain officials, but none were held viable as direct accomplices to the serial killer.  Murders  Voronenko attacked girls and young women, preferring blondes, about 150 centimetres in height. On August 25, 2006, he raped a 17-year-old girl on Loni Golikova Street. The victim managed to survive the ordeal. On December 8, 2006, in the basement of a house on Stachek Avenue, he committed his first murder. The victim was 11-year-old Lida Pogodina, whom he raped, killed and then hid the body in a garbage heap. On January 28, 2007 on Polyukstrovsky Avenue, he killed 19-year-old Katya Fedotova. As it later turned out, Voronenko had suggested that he take the woman to the bus. The girl's body was found only after a month. On March 4, 2007, he raped and killed 20-year-old Alena Gnatyuk, a student of the Institute of Water Transport. The killer kidnapped her from the \\"Chyornaya Rechka\\" metro station, dragged her into the basement of a house on Kolomyazhsky Avenue, raped and strangled her. On May 21, 2007, in the basement of a house on Bolshaya Raznochinnaya Street, he committed the last murder.В Санкт-Петербурге изнасилована и убита пятиклассница The victim was 12-year-old Lena Boyko, with the modus operandi being the same - she was raped, followed by strangulation.  Arrest, investigation and trial  According to the testimony of witnesses, a facial composite of the killer was drawn up. At the disposal of the authorities were recordings from external surveillance cameras at one of the murder sites. As a result, 863 people previously convicted for sexual crimes were tested. During the search, information was received about Voronenko. His address was traced, and on May 24, 2007, he was ambushed and arrested. At first he was suspected only in the last murder, but he subsequently confessed to the previous three.В Петербурге задержанный за убийство школьницы признался еще в 3 аналогичных преступлениях Forensic psychiatric examination recognized Voronenko as insane. The killer did not regret his deeds. These were Voronenko's last words at his trial: At the trial, the parents of the murdered girls and the prosecutor demanded the death penalty for Voronenko, but the court did not consider it possible to make such a verdict due to the moratorium on the death penalty, and on March 20, 2008, the St. Petersburg City Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. Relatives of the victims appealed to the Russian Supreme Court demanding the death penalty, but the verdict was left unchanged.В Петербурге вынесен пожизненный приговор маньяку Вороненко, убивавшему только блондинок Voronenko is currently serving his sentence in the \\"Polar Owl\\" penitentiary.

After her father died the family arranged for her to be married. She was aged only nine or sixteen (sources differ), and not wishing to marry she fled to a beguinage, a community of intentionally unmarried Godly women who lived in a shared community, but without taking vows or cutting themselves off from the world outside. The beguinage community that took her in comprised seven women who lived near the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in her home town. Ida became a beguine. She moved on in around 1213, accepted into the Cistercian convent at Kerkom near Tienen. (The convent relocated shortly afterwards to La Ramée.)

It was built in 1895-97 and served during both World Wars. Following its decommissioning in 1956, the battery was acquired by the National Trust. History The battery was built in 1895-97 to defend the estuary of the River Fal and originally installed with two BL 6-inch Mk VI naval guns. They were replaced in 1903-04 with BL 6-inch Mk VII naval guns, which remained in place until 1924. After a period under care and maintenance, the battery was rearmed during World War II with two 6-inch VII guns, with an additional two Ordnance QF 3-pounder Vickers placed nearby. The battery also served as an examination battery alongside Half Moon Battery at Pendennis Castle. Following the dissolution of coast artillery in the United Kingdom in 1956, the battery's two gun emplacements were infilled with rubble and earth, while the site was acquired by the National Trust in 1959. In 2012, the eastern gun emplacement was excavated and restored as part of the \\"Unlocking our Coastal Heritage\\" project, which aimed to \\"increase the economic value of the South West Coast Path by protecting and enhancing heritage features\\". The battery is accessible to the public, while tours are carried out during the peak season by the National Trust.

He was alive during the time of Islam's Prophet Muhammad, and was involved in the famous Event of Mubahala in an exchange of letters and encounter with Muhammad. Story According to Islamic sources, Muhammad sent Bishop Abdul Haris Ibn Alqama a letter during the ninth year of Hijra, inviting the Bishop's Christian followers to embrace the teachings of Islam. The letter read: \\"In the name the Lord of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob … I invite you all to worship God instead of worshiping his creatures, so that you may come out of the guardianship of the creatures of Allah and take place under the guardianship of Allah himself…\\" In response to that letter, a delegation of sixty Christian men, including 24 from noble families from Najran, travelled to meet with Muhammad in Medina between 21 and 25 of Dhu'l-Hijja 10 A.H. / 22 to 26 March 632 A.D. [specific dates contested]. The delegation was headed by three notables, Bishop Abu Haritha Bin Alqamah (in charge of religious affairs), Abdul Maseeh Al-Aqib (in charge of princehood and government affairs) and Al- Aiham As-Saiyid (in charge of educational and political affairs). The discussions of theology began, with the subject eventually turning to Jesus, the Messiah, and the question of defining what and who Jesus is understood to be. Muhammad preached to them and requested they accept Islam. The Christians, however, were not convinced and responded with their explanations of Christ being divine. Because of the Christian's refusal to accept Muhammad's demand to acknowledge his prophetic message of Jesus, the call to invoke a curse was initiated by Muhammad. According to the traditional account, after being unable to resolve the conflict over who Jesus is, the following verses known as the \\"Verse of Mubahalah\\" are believed to have been revealed to Muhammad: Al-Mubahalah () is derived from the Arabic word bahlah (curse). Bahala is a root verb meaning \\"to curse\\". Al-bahl (the curse) also means a scarcity of water. The term 'mubahala' can also mean withdrawing mercy from one who lies or engages in falsehood. In the Quran, al-mubahala (invocation of God's curse) was mentioned as a decisive solution to the dispute over Jesus between the Christians of Najran and Muhammad. Allah ordered Muhammad to call on the Christians to invoke God's curse (mubahala – verse 3.61) in order to determine who was telling the truth. The Quran's mubahala verse is one of the most controversial verses due to the debate with Christianity and more-so the Shia and Sunni division within Islam. Praying for God to curse the liar regarding religious disputes is an ancient Arabic tradition.La Mubahala de Medine et I'hyperdulie de Fatima, in Louis Massignon, parole donnee (paris: Editions du Seuil, 1983), 147-67 Mubahala was common among Semitic tribes, and was found in pre-Islamic writings. The event of Mubahala is an instance of the Quran's critique of a central Christian doctrine: God on earth as Christ (Incarnation). From this historical event, Muslims were to continue challenging and criticizing major points of the Christian faith with Christians defending and defining their doctrines as well as their practices. Eid al-Mubahalah is an annual Shia Muslim commemoration of Mubahala. While Eid al-Mubahalah is always on nearly the same day (24 Dhu al-Hijjah) of the Islamic calendar, the date on the Gregorian calendar varies yearly because of the differences between the Hijri calendar (AH), which is a lunar calendar and the Gregorian calendar which is a solar calendar.

Born in Kingston-upon-Hull, Gould became a carpenter, initially working aboard a ship but, by 1881, onshore in Hull. He joined the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners (ASC&J;), and developed a keen interest in the labour movement. Convinced that there was a need for independent political representation for the movement, he was a founder member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), and was a leading supporter of Tom McCarthy unsuccessful campaign in Kingston upon Hull West at the 1895 United Kingdom general election.Yann Beliard, \\"Gould, Alfred\\", Dictionary of Labour Biography, vol.XIV, pp.138–145 Hull Trades Council opposed the ILP and undertook little activity in the late 1890s, but Gould consistently raised the party's causes there, and in 1897 he won election to the council's executive committee. By 1905, he was the leading figure on the council, which was dominated by supporters of the new Labour Representation Committee. He won election to Hull City Council, and though he lost his seat in 1911, he regained it two years later, and was adopted as the party's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Hull West. During 1913, Gould was a leading opponent of the deportation of nine South African trade unionists to Britain, but the following year, he joined Havelock Wilson's campaign to exclude non-white sailors from British ships. He supported World War I, and spoke against conscientious objectors, and stood down from his Hull West candidacy on the outbreak of war. Gould continued his trade union activity, winning election to the executive of the ASC&J;, and from 1917 as the first chair of its National Executive Committee. In 1918, he was also appointed as the first chair of the National Federation of Building Trades Operatives, serving for two years. At the 1918 United Kingdom general election Gould stood for the Labour Party in the new seat of Kingston upon Hull South West, taking 19.3% of the vote and third place. This disappointment led him to focus on the trade union movement, and when the ASC&J; merged into the new Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers, he was one of its most prominent figures. However, the new union adopted a rule requiring members of the executive to retire at the age of 63. Already over this limit, Gould retired in 1925 and began suffering from poor health. In May 1927, he committed suicide.

To the descendants of an enslaved civilization, music provided African Americans with an opportunity to experience the idea of freedom as an idea before it became a reality with the passing of the 14th Amendment in 1868. In the American South, whites established rules that prevented slaves from leaving their master's plantations without written permission. To enforce these rules, white patrols were established to catch runaway slaves, return them to their masters, and punish them. White masters asserted themselves over their slaves and made sure the slaves knew that they were property. Slaves would often hold private worship meetings to escape from their enslavement if only for a little while. They would also sing in the fields, but to avoid being punished for singing about freedom, they would conceal the true meaning of their freedom songs by using symbols in their music. It was a common practice for small groups of slaves to gather together on Sundays to relax and sing together. They would play drums and dance as a way of expressing their culture and also as a way to rally their slave community together in unity. Many times music encouraged and spurred uprisings and revolts. = 20th Century =  Civil Rights Movement  Aretha Franklin in 1967 Even in the midst of Jim Crow, music provided a form of cultural autonomy in which African Americans were able to continue a tradition of accommodation and resistance. Musical tradition, such as group singing, was used to express solidarity, cultural pride, inspiration, and hope among the early activists. Many artists wrote their music to speak out against the injustice that they saw around them. There were many musical artists who added their voice to the those who sang the slave songs of the past, and many of those slave songs were the inspiration for these musical artists. Music provided a rhetorical outlet that allowed movement leaders and supporters, such as Aretha Franklin, to garner support from a large audience with diverse backgrounds. Aretha Franklin, called the Queen of Soul, championed the rights and freedoms of African Americans. In her song, \\"Think,\\" Aretha sings again and again, \\"Freedom!\\" as a way to draw attention to the black freedom struggle. Throughout the 20th century, Franklin supported the Civil Rights Movement and financially donated to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. As early as 1939, Billie Holiday sang and popularized the song \\"Strange Fruit\\", which commented on lynchings in the south. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) used A Capella groups and popular artists like Dick Gregory to deepen bonds with local communities, embolden the fearful, and even raise money for the cause at community events throughout the South. SNCC organized a musical tour of The Freedom Singers, a quartet group consisting of the African American musicians, Charles Neblett, Bernice Johnson, Rutha Mae Harris, and Cordell Reagon. This group would hold musical concerts and a meetings to encourage people to register to vote and become informed of their civil rights. Donations collected at these concerts provided nearly $50,000 for the SNCC to be able to continue their education on civil rights across the country. The Ku Klux Klan would sometimes burn crosses on the lawn outside the halls where the concerts were being held, but while there was great opposition to these concerts, the music gave African Americans a voice and put them on the front lines of the Civil Rights Movement.  Free jazz  Overlapping with the Civil Rights Movement, jazz musicians such as Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman and Sun Ra pushed the boundaries of jazz as a musical form, embracing free improvisation and rejecting various forms and elements previously associated with jazz music.\\"A Fireside Chat with Marc Ribot\\". All About Jazz. Accessed 2013-01-28. Free jazz was seen as a reaction, not only to the strictures of jazz as a musical form, but to the political turmoil of the mid-20th century and the continued oppression of Black people in the United States. Some free jazz musicians, such as Ed Blackwell and Leon Thomas, also incorporated elements of traditional African music and other non- Western influences in their music.  Anti-colonialist and Pan-African movements  Prominent African musicians have been associated with anti- colonial movements in the 20th century, such as Miriam Makeba, Dorothy Masuka, Fela Kuti, and Sonny Okosun.The Independent, 24 June 2008: Sonny Okosun obituary. Starting in Jamaica but soon gaining popularity around the world, reggae artists like Bob Marley also embraced Pan-African ideals in their music.  Late 20th century  Following the Civil Rights Era, music remained an integral aspect of expressing political and racial ideology. The black freedom struggle remained intertwined in the lyrical inspiration of Jazz, Funk, Disco, Rock, and eventually Rap and Hip Hop. Though protests and social movements became increasingly less frequent in the 1970s and 1980s, music maintained a rhetorical space in which African Americans had their own counter culture that challenged the power structure and dominant political ideology of the time. Jazz musicians used their music to explore the implications and ideological implications of blackness. Funk music was used by black youth after the euphoria of the civil rights movement faded to express their own concerns with poverty, segregation, and the plight of the working class. Disco music started in black queer communities as a way to escape discrimination and \\"dissolve of restrictions on black/gay people\\". Black rock music combined with political voices against the Vietnam War, most notably seen in Jimi Hendrix and his song \\"Machine Gun\\". Hip Hop rose to popularity in the 1980s and was born in urban, predominantly African American and Latino communities that had high rates of unemployment, crime, and poverty. Rap and Hip Hop became the tools of expression for black male ghetto youth, a group that was once largely invisible to mainstream society, giving them a platform to use confrontational and political poetics to express dissatisfaction with the realities of black America. One of the first blatantly political raps is accredited to Brother D and the Collective Effort’s 1980 single “How We Gonna Make the Black Nation Rise?” which criticized the United States for being a police state and expressed contempt for historical injustices such as slavery and ethnic cleansing. Drawing on their own experiences with racism, hip hop groups such as N.W.A. emerged releasing music that was politically aimed to comment on police brutality and other racial tensions of the period. = 21st century = Music has continued to be an important venue for the expression of Black politics and the denunciation of racism and colonialism into the 21st century. Two of Fela Kuti's children, Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti have continued to use afrobeat as a venue for expressing Pan-African, anti-colonial politics. In the United States, hip hop artists like The Coup, Immortal Technique, and Kendrick Lamar, have continued to produce politically charged music, picking up where groups like N.W.A. left off.  Associated genres  Due to the diversity of cultures in Africa and in the African diaspora, as well as the long history of various freedom struggles around the world, many different genres of music have been associated with Black liberation. = Spirituals = Spirituals (or Negro spirituals) are generally Christian songs that were created by African Americans. Spirituals were originally an oral tradition that imparted Christian values while also describing the hardships of slavery.\\"Celebrating Black Music Month\\", National Museum of African American History and Culture Although spirituals were originally unaccompanied monophonic (unison) songs, they are best known today in harmonized choral arrangements. This historic group of uniquely American songs is now recognized as a distinct genre of music. = Jazz = Jazz originated in the African- American communities of New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and developed from roots in blues and ragtime. Jazz is seen by many as \\"America's classical music\\". Since the 1920s Jazz Age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It then emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African-American and European-American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music.Ferris, Jean (1993) America's Musical Landscape. Brown and Benchmark. . pp. 228, 233 Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".Starr, Larry, and Christopher Waterman. \\"Popular Jazz and Swing: America's Original Art Form.\\" IIP Digital. Oxford University Press, 26 July 2008. = Afrobeat = Afrobeat involves the combination of elements of West African musical styles such as fuji music and highlife with American funk and jazz influences, with a focus on chanted vocals, complex intersecting rhythms, and percussion.Grass, Randall F. \\"Fela AnikulaThe Art of an Afrobeat Rebel\\". The Drama Review: TDR. MIT Press. 30: 131–148. The term was coined by Nigerian multi-instrumentalist and bandleader Fela Kuti, who is responsible for pioneering and popularizing the style both within and outside Nigeria. It was partially borne out of an attempt to distinguish Fela Kuti's music from the soul music of American artists such as James Brown. = Funk = Funk originated in African-American communities in the mid-1960s when African-American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B;). Funk de- emphasizes melody and chord progressions and focuses on a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer. Like much of African-inspired music, funk typically consists of a complex groove with rhythm instruments playing interlocking grooves. Funk uses the same richly colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths. = Reggae = Reggae originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora.Stephen Davis. \\"Reggae.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Oxford University Press. Web.16 Feb. 2016. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals, \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term reggae more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B; practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae is deeply linked to the Rastafari, an Africa-centred religion which developed in Jamaica in the 1930s, aiming at promoting Pan Africanism. Soon after the Rastafarian movement appeared, the international popularity of reggae music became associated with and increased the visibility of Rastafarianism spreading the Rastafari gospel throughout the world. = Hip hop = Hip hop or rap music,Encyclopædia Britannica article on rap, retrieved from britannica.com: Rap, musical style in which rhythmic and/or rhyming speech is chanted (\\"rapped\\") to musical accompaniment. This backing music, which can include digital sampling (music and sounds extracted from other recordings by a DJ), is also called hip-hop, the name used to refer to a broader cultural movement that includes rap, deejaying (turntable manipulation), graffiti painting, and break dancing.AllMusic article for rap, retrieved from AllMusic.comHarvard Dictionary of Music article for rap, retrieved from CredoReference is a music genre developed in the United States by inner-city African Americans in the 1970s which consists of a stylized rhythmic music that commonly accompanies rapping, a rhythmic and rhyming speech that is chanted. It developed as part of hip hop culture, a subculture defined by four key stylistic elements: MCing/rapping, DJing/scratching with turntables, break dancing, and graffiti writing. Other elements include sampling beats or bass lines from records (or synthesized beats and sounds), and rhythmic beatboxing. = Traditional African music = The traditional music of Africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich and diverse, with different regions and nations of Africa having many distinct musical traditions. Traditional music in most of the continent is passed down orally (or aurally) and is not written. In Sub-Saharan African music traditions, it frequently relies on percussion instruments of every variety, including xylophones, djembes, drums, and tone-producing instruments such as the mbira or \\"thumb piano.\\" African music often consists of complex rhythmic patterns, often involving one rhythm played against another to create a polyrhythm.

Most notably, he founded the celebrated Rajputana Mission Hospital in Udaipur.  Early life  James Shepherd was born on February 2nd, 1847 in Aberdeen, Scotland. He was one of four sons and two daughters, none of whom ever got married. From a young age, he was considered very bright, receiving a number of awards from Aberdeen Grammar School. While his father did not push him to pursue missionary work, Shepherd and his family belonged to St. Nicholas Lane Church, where Shepherd took a bible class that is thought to have influenced his decision to do so.  Education  After deciding to become a missionary, Shepherd prepared thoroughly, focusing his attention both on medicine and the Gospel. In 1868, he graduated from Aberdeen University, and in 1871, he received an M.B., C.M., followed by an M.D. in 1873. During this time, he also attended the Divinity Hall of the United Presbyterian Church in Edinburgh for theological training. Although Shepherd enjoyed this period of education, he also longed to get out into the real world and do real work.  Work as a missionary  = Work in Deoli and Amjer = Shepherd began his missionary work in 1872 in Deoli, Rajasthan, at the time part of Rajputana. During this year, he had few responsibilities and devoted much of his time to learning Hindi, to allow him to preach to the local population in their language. In 1874, Shepherd was moved to Amjer to take charge of its hospital. This was reportedly no easy task for such a young and inexperienced doctor and missionary. He saw patients of all sorts, and the mission report for that year shows that 1,700 cases were treated each month. In addition to his responsibility, Shepherd began to preach in surrounding areas and continued to learn Hindi. = Work in Udaipur = At the request of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland, Shepherd went to Udaipur in 1877, where he did most of his work for the next 43 years. Although the local population was skeptical of him at first, Shepherd quickly won their confidence, and within eleven months, his dispensary had had 27,472 visits. He also treated people in their homes and held preaching meetings twice a week along with Isa Das. In the summer of 1882, a cholera outbreak occurred in the city. Shepherd worked tirelessly to address it, and at its conclusion, his colleagues insisted that he take a furlough. While at home, he persuaded the Students' Missionary Society to gather money towards a new hospital in Udaipur. With this money, and a land plot gifted by the Raj, Shepherd began building the hospital upon his return and oversaw its development from beginning to end. In 1886, it was ready for use, and the Rajputana Mission Hospital opened to the public with a grand ceremony. The completion of the hospital not only allowed Shepherd to practice medicine more efficiently but also sparked the next phase in his career, in which he pursued a number of different projects. In 1891, he opened Udaipur's first mission church on land granted by the Maharana Fateh Singh, 73rd Custodian of House of Mewar of the Udaipur royal family in recognition for his clinical service. Later, he established a Christian school for the Bhil people and an asylum for lepers.  Impact  The impact of Shepherd's work in India is measured by the service to hundreds of thousands of patients with conditions ranging from malaria to broken bones, and his church has inspired the development of a Christian community including the school he founded. The church is now known as the Shepherd Memorial Church as well as the Church of North India and is the oldest surviving church in Udaipur. In Udaipur, there came to be a \\"Shepherd tradition,\\" in which he created a new atmosphere, set up standards of truth and honesty, and stood for what was honorable.

She is a nationally known expert on federal law relating to American Indians. Early life Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Newton and her two brothers lived either with her mother or grandparents in rural Michigan and later St. Louis county.DU Law dean soars after a humble start, Denver Post, May 30, 1999, page B-01 She graduated from Brentwood High School in 1962, where she was named a National Merit Scholar. Forced to finance her own college education, she worked her way through college. After attending George Washington University, she earned her Bachelor of arts in an interdisciplinary humanities major with a focus on the ancient Greek language at the University of California, Berkeley in 1973. In 1976, she earned her J.D. from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law (UC Hastings), where she was a member of the Order of the Coif and the Thurston Society and was managing editor of the Hastings Law Journal. Career After Newton graduated from UC Hastings, in 1976, she began her academic career at Catholic University's Columbus School of Law in Washington, D.C., where she became the first woman to be tenured and promoted to full professor. While at Catholic University she worked with the few other women law professors who were then teaching in Washington, D.C., to form the D.C. Women Law Professors Group, which grew in number and reach as more women entered the legal academy, eventually becoming the D.C./Maryland/Virginia/West Virginia/Western Pennsylvania Women Law Professors Group. In 1992, she joined the faculty at American University's Washington College of Law. Newton moved into law school administration in 1998 when she was named the first woman dean of the University of Denver Sturm College of Law. In 2000 she accepted the deanship at the University of Connecticut School of Law, again as the first woman dean. At Connecticut, she raised the school's profile as a resource for local Indian tribes and state government. While in Connecticut she was also nominated to be a James W. Cooper Fellow of the Connecticut Bar Foundation, where she remains a Life Fellow. She also served on the Board of Overseers for the Bushnell Performing Arts Center (2003-2006) and the Board of the Connecticut Opera (2004-2006). In October 2006 she received the Distinguished Service Award from the University of Connecticut Law School Alumni Association for her service as dean. In 2006 she returned to her alma mater as the Chancellor, Dean, and William B. Lockhart Professor of Law at Hastings. During that time, she was also appointed by the Yurok Tribe to serve as an associate justice of the Yurok Tribal Court. After three years at UC Hastings, she stepped down to become the Joseph A. Matson Dean and Professor of Law at Notre Dame Law School. After ten years, Newton returned to the Notre Dame Law faculty. Newton has been active in legal education organizations, serving on the ABA Section of Legal Education and Admission to the Bar's Clinical and Skills Committee (2005-09) and on numerous committees for the Association of American Law Schools (AALS). She has chaired four AALS committees, including the Committee on Sections and the Annual Meeting (2009-10), the Executive Committee of the Law Dean's Section (2008), the Executive Committee of the Native American Rights Section (1997-98), and the Executive Committee of the Women in Legal Education Section (1996). She has also served on various committees for the Law School Admission Council. She was a member of the Board of Trustees for the NALP Foundation for Law Career Research and Education from 2006 to 2018 and served as chair from 2014-16. =Scholarship= Newton's scholarship focuses on American Indian law with an emphasis on tribal property and federal constitutional issues. She has published a number of articles on the legal issues affecting American Indian tribes and co-authored a textbook on the subject. Her law review articles have been reprinted in collections on race law, the law of reparations, and the philosophy of law. Since 1998 Newton has served as editor-in-chief of Cohen's Handbook of Federal Indian Law, the only comprehensive academic treatise on Federal Indian law.

She was the personal favorite and secretary of Sophia. Agnieszka was likely in the service of Sophia in Poland prior to her marriage. She did belong to the Polish retinue of 500 people accompanying Sophia from Poland to her new life in Germany upon her marriage to Henry V, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg in February 1556. In contrast to the majority of the Polish courtiers, Agnieszka remained with Sophia in her new court in Germany in Wolfenbüttel Castle. She had an influential position at court as the personal confidante and secretary of Sophia. She conducted the correspondence between Sophia and her powerful relatives, such as her brother the king of Poland and her sister the queen of Sweden. In 1568, she accompanied Sophia to her dower court, and assisted her in making it a cultural center. After 1572, she assisted Sophia in her work to defend her late brother's will. Her year of death is not known, but she was noted to be alive in 1572. Her position is mirrored with Dorothea Ostrelska, whose life in the court of Sophia's sister Catherine Jagellon is an almost exact replica to her.

G. Wells' 1897 novel The Invisible Man include: Adaptations =Films and TV series= USA * The Invisible Man, a 1933 film directed by James Whale and produced by Universal Pictures. Griffin was played by Claude Rains and given the first name \\"Jack\\". One of the Universal horror films of the 1930s, it spawned a number of sequels, plus many spin-offs using the idea of an \\"invisible man\\" that were largely unrelated to Wells's original story and using a relative of Griffin as a secondary character possessing the invisibility formula. **The Invisible Man Returns (1940) with Vincent Price as Geoffrey Radcliffe, the film's invisible man; **The Invisible Woman (1940), a comedy with Virginia Bruce as the title character and John Barrymore as the scientist who invents the invisibility process; **Invisible Agent (1942); **The Invisible Man's Revenge (1944) both starring Jon Hall (as different invisible men); **Abbott and Costello Meet the Invisible Man (1951) with Arthur Franz as Tommy Nelson, a boxer framed for murder who takes the invisibility formula to find the real killer and clear his name. **Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948) with Vincent Price provided the voice of the Invisible Man *The Amazing Transparent Man, a 1960 science fiction/crime thriller about an invisible safecracker. * Mad Monster Party? (1967) includes the Invisible Man (voiced by Allen Swift) as part of the monster ensemble. * Amazon Women on the Moon, a 1987 comedy anthology film features a spoof titled Son of the Invisible Man, with Ed Begley, Jr. playing the son of the original Invisible Man who believes he is invisible, but is in fact visible – creating an awkward situation when he confidently disrobes in front of everyone. * The Invisible Kid, a 1988 film, starring Jay Underwood and Chynna Phillips, about a teenager that accidentally discovered a formula that renders himself and his friends invisible. * Memoirs of an Invisible Man, a 1992 modernised version of the story, starring Chevy Chase as a man who is accidentally made invisible and is then hunted by a government agent who wishes to use him as a weapon. * Hollow Man, a 2000 film starring Kevin Bacon, and directed by Paul Verhoeven ** direct-to-video sequel Hollow Man 2 starring Christian Slater as \\"Michael Griffin\\" and directed by Claudio Fah. * The Invisible Man, (2020) a film written and directed by Leigh Whannell, starring Elisabeth Moss with Oliver Jackson-Cohen in the title role. * The Invisible Woman, a film in development with Elizabeth Banks starring in the title role as well as directing and producing. International * Sabash Satyam (1969), a Telegu film starring Krishna =TV series= *The Invisible Man, a 1958 TV series that ran for two seasons and centred on espionage. Created by Ralph Smart. * Mad, Mad, Mad Monsters (1972), a semi-prequel to Mad Monster Party? first shown as an episode of the Saturday morning anthology TV series The ABC Saturday Superstar Movie, also includes the Invisible Man (again voiced by Allen Swift) as part of the monster ensemble. This time, however, he was a married man named Claude (an obvious reference to Claude Rains), with an invisible wife named Nagatha (voiced by Rhoda Mann), an invisible son named Ghoul (also voiced by Swift) and even an invisible dog named Goblin. *The Invisible Man (1975) features a sympathetic main character who uses his abilities for good. As with The Six Million Dollar Man before it, the pilot was dark in tone: Dr. Daniel Westin (David McCallum), a researcher working for the KLAE Corporation, discovers a process involving lasers that creates invisibility; after learning that the corporation plans to turn the process over to the military, he renders himself invisible and destroys the machinery. The process proves unstable and renders him permanently invisible. The regular series that followed was lighter, with Westin and his wife Kate taking on special missions for the government while trying to find a means to make him visible again. * Gemini Man, a 1976 TV series starring Ben Murphy as agent Sam Casey who is turned invisible after being exposed to radiation following an explosion of a fallen satellite. Using a watch-like \\"DNA stabilizer\\", he is both able regain his visibility and turn himself invisible again for extremely brief periods. This series only lasted one season. * The Invisible Woman, a 1983 TV-movie pilot for a prospective comedy series with Bob Denver. * The Invisible Man, a 1984 television adaptation in six parts, shown on BBC 1 with Pip Donaghy as Griffin and David Gwillim as Kemp.. * The Comic Strip (TV series) in 1987 a segment titled Mini Monsters showed his son Blanko, an invisible kid. * The Invisible Man, a Sci-Fi Channel television series that aired from 2000 to 2002. Darien Fawkes (Vincent Ventresca) is a convicted burglar who is offered freedom if he agrees to participate in a secret government project directed by his brother and funded by a secret government agency. Invisibility is achieved by implanting a synthetic gland in his brain that secretes \\"Quicksilver\\", a substance that coats his body and clothes and renders him invisible, with Fawkes able to even control which parts of his body become invisible rather than the process being 'all or nothing'. The gland is subtly sabotaged in production, with the result that Quicksilver leaks into the host's brain, causing \\"Quicksilver Madness\\", a state of mental instability in which the host becomes violent and dangerous, unless given access to a regular counteragent. * The Invisible Man, (2005) an animated television series produced by Moonscoop which is loosely based on the book. International: * Человек-невидимка (Pronunciation: Chelovek-nevidimka; translation: The Invisible Man), a 1977 Soviet made-for-television version directed by Gleb Selyanin and starring Rostislav Katansky as Griffin. Another version with the same title was made in 1984 directed by Aleksandr Zakharov, with Andrei Kharitonov as Griffin. In this version, the plot was changed: Griffin was shown as a talented scientist but misunderstood by his contemporaries, and Kemp (Romualdas Ramanauskas) as a vicious person who wanted to become ruler of the world with Griffin's help. When Griffin rejected Kemp's proposal, the latter did all his best to kill him (and finally succeeded). The movie remained unknown to the Western audience because of a violation of Wells's copyright. =Stage= *Ken Hill adapted the book to play form in 1991, and it debuted at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1991. It played in the West End in 1993 with Michael N. Harbour as Griffin. In November 2010, the play was revived at the Menier Theatre in London running until February 2011. =Radio= * The 2001 Radio Tales drama \\"The Invisible Man\\" is an adaptation of the novel for National Public Radio. * In 2017, Big Finish Productions adapted The Invisible Man into a full-cast audio drama starring John Hurt as Griffin. In other media *The character of the Invisible Man, given a full name of \\"Hawley Griffin\\", appears in the graphic novel The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen by Alan Moore. In the film adaptation, he is replaced with a different character named \\"Rodney Skinner\\", and instead of being the inventor of the formula, he is a thief who stole the formula. The film novelisation reveals that the inventor was Hawley Griffin. Skinner was especially created for the film because of copyright issues regarding the 1933 Universal film. Skinner is also portrayed as a more cheerful and good-natured character, and unlike Griffin, ultimately becomes the saviour rather than betrayer of the League. *In the television series Sanctuary, a character named Nigel Griffin was one of the Five, a team of scientists who injected themselves with a blood serum and gained special abilities. His ability was to make himself transparent at will, though it did not work on clothing. It is passed down to his descendants, including Clara Griffin (Christine Chatelain). *In a 1981 episode of Fantasy Island which also includes Frankenstein's Monster Tattoo is tasked with taking the Invisible Man around the island... and ends up becoming invisible himself! *In 2009, Canadian cartoonist Jeff Lemire released an original graphic novel for DC Comics/Vertigo titled The Nobody. This story was inspired by The Invisible Man with \\"John Griffen\\" as \\"the Invisible Man\\". There are many other allusions to the book. *In the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"See No Evil\\", Batman confronts a criminal whose experimental plastic suit renders him invisible, but also affects his sanity. In 2008, the creative team of Doug Moench and Kelley Jones created a limited series called Batman: The Unseen. It features Batman fighting against the Invisible Man. *The famous cartoon series Tom & Jerry produced an episode in 1947 titled The Invisible Mouse, parodying the book written by Wells. In a later episode, The Vanishing Duck (1958), Jerry and his friend Quackers turn themselves invisible using Vanishing Cream and torment Tom, who later turns himself invisible. In the 1965 short Of Feline Bondage, Jerry is given a magic potion by his Fairy Godmother that turns him invisible so he can bedevil Tom. *The Invisible Man is Monster in My Pocket No. 46. In the comic book series, he was allied with the good monsters. In the animated special, he was rechristened Dr. Henry Davenport and became leader of the good monsters. *Castlevania often has enemies and bosses that refer to old literature and films. In Castlevania: Portrait of Ruin, the Invisible Man makes an appearance as an enemy that dwells in the sewers. His clothes (before he discards them to stalk players unseen) reference those in the novel The Invisible Man: he wears a long, thick, tall-collared coat, gloves and a wide-brimmed hat. He also dies in a similar fashion. *In the book The Wright 3 by Blue Balliett, the Invisible Man played an important role in the story. *In the one-shot comic Van Helsing: From Beneath the Rue Morgue, which presents Van Helsing and Dr. Moreau, there is a monster created by Dr. Moreau that is invisible. Van Helsing finds the papers detailing the invisibility cure and remembers something about an Englishman who turned invisible in West Sussex. *In the 1970s, the Invisible Man appeared as a mascot in television commercials for Scotch Magic Transparent Tape. *In an October 17, 1970 episode of \\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" \\"X Marks the spot\\" The band tries to protect a professor from his invisible assistant *The British punk band Generation X Generation X released a song called \\"The Invisible Man\\" on their 1978 debut album Generation X album Generation X\\" *The British rock band Queen released a song called \\"The Invisible Man\\" as one of their singles from their 1989 album The Miracle. *Another British rock band called Marillion also has a song called The Invisible Man. This track opens the album Marbles, released in 2004. *In the anime series Naruto, the Second Tsuchikage, Muu, is probably based on Griffin, the main character of The Invisible Man, due to his combination of bandage-covering appearance and the invisibility technique he uses to avoid being spotted. *In the Monster High media, including video games and web animations, there is a teacher named \\"Mr. Where\\", who dresses in the Invisible Man's bandages, trench coat, and gloves (however, he usually wears a beret and sunglasses, as he is the drama teacher). He is confirmed to be invisible beneath these coverings on more than one occasion, where his sleeves are shown bunching up to reveal his invisible limbs. He also seems to have the ability to extend his invisibility, making his clothing disappear as well. *In addition to Mr. Where in the primary Monster High line, in the tie-in novels by Lisi Harrison, there is a teenage boy named Billy Phaedin (jokingly called \\"InvisiBilly\\"), in reference to the teenage main characters being the children of Universal Monsters and other historical \\"monsters\\". It is mentioned repeatedly that he is usually naked, otherwise he would just look like floating clothing. In the third novel, a friend attempts to use modern cosmetics to make him visible, with limited success, but he ultimately goes back to being invisible once these techniques fail in a public setting. *In Team Fortress 2 a set of clothes is wearable by the spy called 'the Invisible Rogue', which is based on this novel. *In Donald E. Westlake's Smoke, career thief Freddie Noon is turned invisible by an attempted cure for cancer by two smoking researchers. The book pays homage to aspects of The Invisible Man by having Noon have to struggle with exposure to the elements and having to starve himself to avoid boluses of undigested food hovering in the air. *A web series called \\"The Invisible Man\\" based on H.G. Wells' novel premiered in 2014.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brrsrKbisWk&list;=PL5QwsRmcq1DTMQz0XqD7r2iQwz7bW2gbQ&index;=2&t;=0s The episodes were set in a modern, American context and gave the protagonist a backstory which included an estranged wife who had been the victim of domestic abuse. The series won a variety of awards at LA WebFest, Austin WebFest, DC WebFest, and more.

The red and white building behind the bridge is the old Hôtel de Ville (town hall) Chênée (, Tchinnêye Walloon) is a former Walloon commune in Belgium that was merged into Liège in 1977. Chênée is part of the province and arrondissement of Liège. Chênée lays at the river mouth of the two rivers Vesdre and Ourthe. It had around 9.101 inhabitants in 2015. The postal code of Chênée is 4032 and is situated around 72 meters above sea level.  Etymology  The coat of arms of Chênée The name Chênée comes from the French chênaie (oak-grove, a place many oak trees grew). The three diamonds in the coat of arms symbolize oak leaves or grains of sand, reflecting the city's history as a site of glass production.  History  Industrial quarter, Rue du Gravier, 1 \\"Chênée - Rue du Moulin et Verrerie, (1850)\\" USA 3070551 of 3rd Armored Division is welcomed by inhabitants of Chênè, September 8th, 1944 Chênée originated at the crossing of two Roman roads; the first leading from Trier to Tongeren, the second from Jupille over Theux to Stavelot. The crossing was also close to a ford, which was important to pass cows over the Ourth before the Pont de Lhoneux (the bridge of Lhonneux) was built. Chênée was mentioned the first time in a 12th-century document under the name of Kesneies. Until 1266 Chênée was part of the Vogtei of Jupille, which was subordinated to the diocese of Verdun. At that year it was affiliated into the principality of Liège. The bishop of Verdun, Haimo of Verdun got the village as a gift from the German Emperor Henry II in the year 1008. In 1266 the Bishopric of Verdun Robert II of Médidan donated the Vogtei Jupille to the Prince-Bishopric of Liège, Henry III of Geldern. That meant, that all the villages and villagers became property of Henry III and fell under his jurisdiction. Because of his unworthy and extravagant way of life, Henry III was deposed by Gregory X. In 1318 Chênée was burned down by John of Bohemia while being at war with prince-bishop Adolph II of the Mark. 1691 it was burned, again, this time by the army of Louis XIV of France under its lieutenant-general under the king in person Louis-François de Boufflers. Chênée also had to suffer from the retreating Austrian army after the lost Battle of Fleurus in 1794. During the French epoch at the end of the 18th century, Chênée became an independent commune. The Battle of Liège (French: Bataille de Liège) was the opening engagement of the German invasion of Belgium and the first battle of the First World War. In World War II Chênée was liberated from Nazi occupation by troops of the 36th Infantry Regiment on September 8, 1944. In 1977 Chênée became a section of the city of Liège. 2008 the roof of the Saint-Albert elementary school of Chênée collapsed overnight. Nobody was hurt. At the junction of Vesder and Ourthe the building of a mill still stands.  Glass manufacturing  There were three glass manufactures in Chênée in 1758: Grandchamps & Coune, Bonniver and Cambresier & Co. In 1872, the glass factory of Van Steenacker was founded by the entrepreneurs Amiable, Belleflamme, Louvet and Berneau. Around the same time the company S.A. of the Verreries de was founded under the direction of Cochet. In the course of the closure of the glassworks Bougart in Manage 1875 one of the sons of Bougart and the production manager Auguste Van Steenacker came to Vaux. They founded the Verrerie Bougart, Sortia et Cie with Cochet, Sortia and Colin. When the company Belleflamme, Louvet et Berneau gave up its glassworks in Chênée in February 1888, it was taken over by the Verrerie de Vaux. After François Delhaize and Herman Dethier had succeeded their parents, Auguste Van Steenacker took over the glassworks of Vaux in February 1895 and founded with his sons François-Charles and William the Société anonyme des Verreries de Vaux. The glassworks of Chênée was then led by François Delhaize. World War I interrupted production. In 1919, production was resumed, but meanwhile the competition had grown abroad. Many old markets were completely or almost completely lost. The glassworks of Vaux ran into considerable financial difficulties and could not find the urgently needed investor. In 1930, the hut was abandoned, the land and buildings were taken over by Magotteaux. In the end Verrerie Grandchamps stayed as the local manufacturer. They produced the bottles for the mineral water brand Spa. Verrerie Grandchamps succeeded Verreries d'Amblève, who were founded 1721 in Aywaille.

It was released on August 8, 2018. The game features uses 2D pixel art visuals and gameplay reminiscent of classic adventure games combined with an interaction system commonly featured in modern adventure games, especially those developed by BioWare. The player chooses to control a male or female protagonist who after a series of supernatural events teams up with the titular group, an ancient team of paranormal investigators. On their quest to find out what happened to them, they must solve a number of quests and puzzles in a variety of locations of a fictionalized version of New York City. The first new intellectual property created by Wadjet Eye since 2006, Unavowed was first announced in 2016. Initially planned as a project with 3D visuals built on Unity, the developer decided on using the Adventure Game Studio engine again with 2D visuals due to a lack of programmers familiar with the Unity engine and a lack of resources to create 3D graphics. Unavowed received generally favorable reviews by critics, with most of them lauding the story and writing in particular. Many also praised the art design for its ability to paint a believable world where the supernatural exists and the background art was positively compared to classical adventure games such as Sam & Max Hit the Road or the Discworld game. Some reviewers however criticized the difficulty as too easy and some characters as underdeveloped.  Gameplay  Unavowed features a classic point-and-click style of gameplay reminiscent of the Monkey Island series or the various Quest games (such as King's Quest, Police Quest etc.) by Sierra Entertainment. In addition, the game offers more modern elements, such as choosing teammates for certain missions and a story that is influenced by the player's choices. Players can choose to play as a male or female character and must choose one of three backgrounds: actor, bartender or cop. Each background alters the interaction with other characters and the dialogue noticeably. The game plays out in an episodic fashion similar to television shows with the player choosing which site to visit and which characters to bring with them at the beginning of each mission. In the mission, non-player characters have to be talked to and clues analyzed, culminating in a confrontation in which the player must decide the fate of a character or being, often with moral and lasting consequences. Then the team returns to their headquarters to start a new mission. All characters feature full voice-acting, except the protagonist, who remains mute throughout the game except when not controlled by the player. Instead of engaging in combat, players are tasked to defend themselves against enemies by solving puzzles that range from deciphering code to releasing creatures before they can cause more harm. While there are some actions that lead to failure, the player cannot die or reach a game over; making mistakes merely resets the game to the state before the mistake. The game allows saving outside of dialogue but limits the amount of save files to 50. Depending on the choice of companions, the dialogue and choices within the mission will be altered as will the puzzles, with each area providing different solutions based on the companions' abilities. For example, a mission with Logan as a companion will feature ghosts that can be talked to and used to help solve puzzles but those ghosts will not be in the same mission if Logan is not chosen to accompany the protagonist. During each mission, one or more flashbacks of the possessed protagonist's actions will happen, allowing the player to extrapolate their next actions based on their vision of the past.  Synopsis  =Setting and characters= As with Wadjet Eye's previous Blackwell series, the game is set in a fictionalized version of contemporary New York City where magic and demons are real and takes place in various New York settings, such as Chinatown, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Wall Street. The protagonist apparently had been possessed by a demon and ran amok in New York City for a year before the events of the game. How the demon came to possess the body differs based on the chosen backstory. Unavowed begins with the protagonist being exorcised by Eli, a sorcerer belonging to Unavowed, a group of supernatural investigators. Unable to return to their old life, they join Unavowed to reconstruct the events of the previous year. Aside from the protagonist, the New York chapter of Unavowed consists of Kalash, a jinn and the chapter's leader and founder, Mandana, Kalash's half-jinn daughter and Eli, a fire mage who discovered his talents during the Nixon administration and has not aged since. During the events of the game, Logan, a recovering alcoholic and medium who travels with KayKay, the spirit of a dead ten-year old who helps him connect with other ghosts, and Vicki, a former police officer who also was the protagonist's former partner if they chose the cop background, join Unavowed. =Plot= After the exorcism, the player's character joins Unavowed's New York branch and learns that supernatural threats have increased within the last year. The team visits the places where supernatural occurrences have been reported. When researching on Staten Island, the team encounters Vicki Santana who was suspended after questioning supernatural occurrences within the NYPD's 120th precinct. On a mission in the Bronx, they meet Logan who, together with his spirit guide KayKay, tries to calm three poltergeists. Once both problems are solved, Logan and Vicki join Unavowed. When reexamining the first site the team investigated with Logan and Vicki, the team encounters Galene, a dryad Kalash banished 400 years earlier, with whom the protagonist had made a pact and learns the demon's name, Melkhiresa. Galene captures one of the team members and challenges Kalash to fight her in a battle to the death. The player's character is forced to kill Kalash to defeat Galene. With the demon's name, Eli is able to determine that they had returned to the place of the first possession: the Under The Bricks theater (actor background), Sammy's Bar (barkeeper background) or the Eternox Nightclub (cop background). There the team finds a closed portal and notes previously written by the protagonist indicating three more sites to investigate on Wall Street, in Manhattan Chinatown and near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. On Wall Street, the team discovers that the protagonist conspired with fae folk to kidnap Eli's great- grandson and manage to rescue him. In Prospect Park, they encounter Calliope, a muse who lost her talents to a local artist who used them to \\"inspire\\" an artist to set himself aflame and a baker to use his own blood in his products. Shortly afterwards, the player's character is possessed again but they manage to alert the team by reaching out to KayKay. The game flashes back to the opening scene, which now plays out differently: The protagonist had actually forced Melkhiresa to meld with them and used the demon's knowledge for their agenda while Melkhiresa was unable to act or escape. When Eli exorcised \\"wicked spirit\\" from the protagonist, this led to the protagonist's soul being removed from the body while Melkhiresa, the demon, was left in control of their body. The team catches up with the player's character and exorcises the protagonist again. Thanks to Logan, the team learns the truth but the protagonist's soul escapes. The team with Melkhiresa (again in control of the protagonist's body) sets out to investigate the last site in Chinatown. They find out that a ba jiao gui (banana ghost from Chinese folklore) haunts the neighborhood and deal with it.Unavowed arrives in the antagonist's pocket dimension. With all six sites investigated, they return to the place Melkhiresa first joined with the protagonist and use a portal to travel to a pocket dimension to hunt down the protagonist's soul. Various obstacles have to be scaled on the way and, depending on the choices in previous missions, Melkhiresa summons creatures previously encountered to help the team. The player's character confronts the soul of the protagonist on top of the Empire State Building who pleads with them to willingly merge into one being again to create a new world based on their beliefs. The player can react in four different ways to this proposal: #Melkhiresa threatens to kill the protagonist's body they are in, forcing the protagonist's soul to release them. By releasing Melkhiresa, the pocket dimension collapses and the protagonist, now powerless, is arrested for their crimes. #Melkhiresa takes their own life by falling down the building, killing the protagonist in the process and the protagonist's body is later found in the real world at the bottom of the Empire State Building. #If Melkhiresa decides to merge with the protagonist willingly, the Unavowed will be left asleep in the pocket dimension while the protagonist does what they plan with Melkhiresa's help. #Trying to fight the protagonist will lead to them forcefully merging with Melkhiresa and then killing the Unavowed team before setting out in the real world to create more havoc. When choosing the first or second option, an ending sequence will play, with the other members of Unavowed narrating what happened next based on the player's choices in the game. Choosing the third or fourth option will only show the credits. Depending on whether the Unavowed or the protagonist emerge victorious after the final confrontation, the opening screen of the game changes, showing either the team or the protagonist.  Development  The game was first announced by its designer Dave Gilbert in March 2016 on the Adventure Game Studio forums. It was the first game Gilbert wrote since 2014 and the first new intellectual property since 2006. From the beginning, Gilbert planned to have the player character being mute, with the other characters responding to the text choices, akin to earlier games developed by BioWare which also featured mute protagonists. Gilbert explained this choice with the complexities of having two different genders and three backstories for the protagonist to choose from which would have forced the developers to record six different voice tracks. Unavowed was built using the Adventure Game Studio engine, modified to allow fully voiced dialogue and groups of characters appearing at once. According to Gilbert, he tried to develop Unavowed on Unity at the beginning because of how dated Adventure Game Studio already was but decided against it because the team had no experience with Unity and not enough time to learn. The game uses 2D pixel art visuals with a variety of backgrounds. The artwork and animations were created by Ben Chandler, who also worked on previous Wadjet Eye games, with the portrait art being created by Ivan Ulyanov. The game features twice the resolution compared to previous Wadjet Eye games using the same design and engine, allowing more details despite the pixel art look. According to Gilbert, the choice of pixel art was also a financial one, stating that his studio simply did not have the resources to develop a 3D game or a game with aesthetics similar to Life Is Strange or adventure games developed by Telltale Games although he would have liked that. A first teaser video was released in December 2017, with the game being released on Microsoft Windows and macOS on August 8, 2018.  Reception  Unavowed received a score of 87/100 on review aggregator Metacritic, indicating generally favorable reviews by critics. Commercially, it was an unexpected success: Wadjet Eye Games reported in April 2019 that the game had sold more than \\"everything we've done by far\\". The game's visual design was praised by multiple reviewers as atmospheric and making good use of lighting and colors to paint a believable world where the supernatural exists. Critics also liked the higher resolution, allowing more details to be displayed. In a 2017 preview, PC World claimed that Ben Chandler, the game's artist, \\"has really outdone himself\\" and that the design helps to strengthen the idea of New York City \\"as this mystical place where the supernatural hides in the shadows\\". This sentiment was echoed by Rock, Paper, Shotgun, which concluded that the game features Chandler's best work to date. PC Gamer's Jody Macgregor wrote a separate feature article just focusing on the background art, positively comparing the artwork to scenes from classical adventures, such as the carnival in Sam & Max Hit the Road or the city of Ankh-Morpork from the Discworld game. Most reviewers lauded the companion characters, especially their writing and voice acting. GameSpot noted that \\"getting drawn into a lengthy conversation is a joy\\" because of \\"well-rounded characters, complete with their own fears, desires, and vexes\\" and credits this to \\"incredible\\" voice acting and writing. The writing garnered praise from other reviewers as well, with many critics especially lauding the branching story and the interesting characters. In a feature for Rock, Paper, Shotgun, Heat Signature and Gunpoint designer Tom Francis highlighted the episodic structure of Unavowed and praised the game's approach to story-telling as a \\"glowing example\\" of how a game can even appeal to players that normally do not like adventure games. Slant Magazine on the other hand found the characters limited, especially the character of Vicki who was considered one-dimensional as well as the lack of focus on Logan who was only noted for being a recovering alcoholic with no other life outside his addiction. It also chided that interesting character narrations are interrupted by mundane quests. Many critics also credited the quality of the voice acting for selling the story and the characters, even though PC Gamer and Adventure Gamers both offered minor criticism on some voices. The soundtrack by Thomas Regin was regarded as complimenting the atmosphere. Multiple critics praised the game's replay value due to using different companions unlocking previously unknown interactions. Several reviewers bemoaned that quests are too easy and can be easily solved, such as by exploring the environment. However, Rock, Paper, Shotgun also remarked that puzzles become better in the second half of the game and GameSpot found the quests \\"varied and often unpredictable\\". 4Players considered the controls unnecessarily limiting, only using the mouse and some keys when the whole keyboard was available. Despite minor criticisms, Adventure Gamers called it an instant classic. The A.V. Club called Unavowed Gilbert's best work to date, especially praising the design and the writing and comparing it favorably to the Quest games and the Monkey Island series. Rock, Paper, Shotgun was equally impressed, especially lauding the BioWare- style story that offers many complex and complicating features successfully \\"in a way the genre has genuinely never seen before\\". The game was nominated for \\"Best Storytelling\\" at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards but lost to God of War. It was also nominated for \\"Excellence in Narrative\\" at the Independent Games Festival Awards. Writing for Vox, Emily VanDerWerff called Unavowed's twist the best plot twist of 2018, commending the developers for playing with the adventure genre's tropes to lull players into believing the game was a classical redemption story. Ben \\"Yahtzee\\" Croshaw of Zero Punctuation ranked it as the fifth best game of 2018, calling it \\"the well-realized paranormal adventure that hopes you've never read a Jim Butcher novel.\\" See also *Lamplight City  References   External links  * 2018 video games Adventure games Video games about demons MacOS games Point-and-click adventure games Single- player video games Video games developed in the United States Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Video games set in New York City Windows games Adventure Game Studio games Video games with alternate endings ","title":"Unavowed"},{"id":"58410269","text":"Bhogapuram Assembly constituency was an Assembly constituency of the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly, India until 2008.

The purpose was to “bring together government, industrial, and academic institutions to address research and development required to enable the deployment of future military unmanned ground vehicle systems ranging in size from man-portables to ground combat vehicles.” Collaborative Technology and Research Alliances was a term for partnerships between Army laboratories and centers, private industry and academia for performing research and technology development intended to benefit the US Army. The partnerships were funded by the US Army.  History  Since approximately 1992, the Army ResearchLaboratory has formed a number of partnerships that involved industry, academia and government. One was the Robotic Collaborative Technology Alliance which was formed in 2009. The program was completed in 2018, ending with a capstone event at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.  Objectives  The goal of R-CTA was development of unmanned systems with a set of intelligence-based capabilities sufficient to enable the teaming of autonomous systems with soldiers. This included robotic systems capable of reasoning about their missions, move through the world in a tactically correct way, observe salient events in the world around them, communicate efficiently with soldiers and other autonomous systems, and perform a variety of mission tasks. R-CTA’s objective was to move beyond unmanned systems requiring human supervision such as drones, which were vulnerable due to near-continuous control by a human operator and breakdowns of communications links.  Research thrusts  The R-CTA program was organized around several research areas: * Semantic perception – perception that understands a basic set of object types important to robotics, moving beyond just what is or is not an obstacle. * Adaptive behavior generation – combining previously developed robotic navigation planning together with semantic understanding in a cognitive architecture that supports context. * Meta-cognition – enabling the use of intuitive, human-level commands for soldier-robot communication, and creating shared mental models and situation awareness. * Machine learning – leveraging new learning techniques to achieve better and faster training of perception and planning algorithms. * Hybrid cognitive/metric world model – spanning the range from traditional metric data to associated semantic understanding to support a cognitive level of reasoning.  Participants  The research under this program was performed collaboratively by scientists of the US Army Research Laboratory and by scientists and engineers of the following institutions: * Army Research Lab (ARL) * Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) * Florida State University (FSU) * General Dynamics Land Systems (GDLS) * Jet Propulsion Laboratory/California Institute of Technology (JPL/Caltech) * Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) * QinetiQ North America (QNA) * University of Central Florida (UCF) * University of Pennsylvania (UPenn)  Results  Examples of research results developed by the R-CTA program included: * Distributed solutions for efficiently allocating a set of complex tasks to a robot team, by giving individual robots the ability to come up with new ways to perform a task, or by allowing multiple robots to cooperate by sharing the subcomponents of a task, or both.  Water detection sensor platforms on an XUV vehicle for terrain classification and obstacle detection in natural environments.  Short-range sensing for safe driving, including video sensing, laser rangefinders, a novel light-stripe rangefinder, software to process each sensor individually, and a map-based fusion system.  A Geometric Path Planner (GPP) that produces routes for unmanned ground and air vehicles.

It is a term for a pronoun that is used at the start of a sentence or clause when the referent is not immediately known, but an argument for the verb is syntactically required. The basic meaning of the clause is made explicit after the verb. Common forms of construction for sentences that contain a syntactic expletive begin with \\"it is\\", \\"here is\\", or \\"there is\\". The expletive serves as the grammatical subject of the independent clause that it begins. In a clause like \\"it is raining\\" the referent of the pronoun \\"it\\" is not obvious, and is the subject of discussion and alternate theories among linguists.Blanco, Mercedes Tubino.

The term is distinct from the expletives of traditional grammar in that a syntactic expletive has a particular syntactical meaning.Longobardi, Giuseppe. 1994. \\"Reference and proper names\\". Linguistic Inquiry 25. MIT Press. pp. 609-665. Simple examples of syntactic expletives are the words it and there: :*It is a hammer that is needed. :*There are hammers in the toolbox. Expletive, pleonastic, or dummy subjects have been crucial to syntactic argumentation. Their lack of semantic content, and their staunch grammatical aspect provide a method to explore differences between syntax and semantics. Svenonius, Peter. Subjects, Expletives, and the EPP.

Religion was also impacted. Christianity in both Europe and the United States served to unite fellow soldiers of the same denomination and motivated them to fight. Some European countries shared unity across denominations while others did not. In Germany, Catholic and Protestant differences caused tension while Austria-Hungary did not unify Catholic services.  Christian Institutions in Jerusalem  The Greek Orthodox Church received much of its income from pilgrimage. The First World War stopped pilgrimage and a heavy tax was required of those who didn't want to fight in the war. The factors caused the Greek Orthodox Church to borrow large amounts of money that left the Church defective during the duration of the war. As Christian establishments dealt with the effects of the First World War, some were able to maintain themselves and prosper while others experienced great loss. The war changed the relationship between Christians and Muslims in Jerusalem and united them over a common attitude of opposition towards Jewish immigration. The war also caused the formations of new religious groups such as The Palestinian Association of Egypt. The war increased religious focus on custody of the Holy Land and local issues.  Unity Among Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish American Soldiers  When the United States entered the First World War, the most prominent religious groups were Catholics, Protestants, and Jews. The conflict served to unite these religions despite their differences and dissolve the idea the Jews and Catholics were inferior to Protestants. The loyalty to the same God and same country helped soldiers put aside their religious differences for the good of the war. Tense conditions still existed between these three religious but efforts were made to provide equal opportunities to each group. A committee called the Committee of Six represented the three faiths in the formation of new policy in the United States.  Spiritualism  World War I also brought a focus on the afterlife and developed Spiritualism into a religion. Spirituality was enticing to those dealing with death and loss of faith after the First World War because of their beliefs in speaking with the dead and explaining mysteries about death, things that some felt Christianity couldn't satisfy. Stobart, a British woman in charge of a hospital during the Second World War, became a spiritualist leader following the end of the war. She was enticed by Spiritualism because it offered more opportunities for her as a woman than other traditional religions did.  The Church of England  For national churches such as The Church of England, war was heavily supported. They felt that it was their duty to pray for soldiers because they needed the grace of God. They believed that soldiers would pass through purgatory because violence was opposed to the church's belief in peace. Despite these conflicting beliefs, church leaders supported the war. Bishop Gore, a bishop of the Church of England, was one that fantasized and downplayed the realities of war in his attempt to support it.Indian bicycle troops Somme 1916 IWM Q 3983  Sikhism  Known for their bravery, Sikhs were more prominently found in the Indian army. Although the army also consisted of individuals from other religions, many people belonging to faiths, such as Hinduism were rarely found in combat. Regiments were even formed strictly with members of the Sikh religion. The Indian Army formed an allegiance with the British Empire and participated in a few battles during World War I, including the Battle of Gallipoli.Stanley, Peter. Die in Battle, Do Not Despair: the Indians on Gallipoli,1915. Primus Books, 2017.  The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints  The participation of members from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in World War I provided an opportunity for members of the LDS Church to clearly define themselves to the world. In a time where many negative commentaries about church were circulating, the War served to help in efforts to accurately portray the church. During this time, “Mormons” were accused of being disloyal to the United States of America. In 1886, a district attorney for the state of Utah was quoted to have said “We wish to say that the so-called Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is steeped in disloyalty to the Government of the United States...We say, more than that, that the purpose of this Church here, one of its particular purposes, is to overthrow the American home and overturn the family altar in this country.\\"1 “In a Nut Shell: A Strong Indictment Presented by the U. S. Attorney,” The Salt Lake Daily Tribune, vol. The Latter-day Saint soldier's active duty in the war fought against the idea that members of the LDS Church were not loyal to their country. In fact, many LDS men enlisted in the military for the sole purpose of trying to prove such accusations as false. Such soldiers also left notable impacts on their fellow comrades throughout their active participation in military service.” The LDS Church is known for its missionary work, and the case was not any different during the early years of the church. During World War I, however, missionary work was negatively affected. Many of those who would otherwise serve missions for the church, enrolled in military service, limiting the number of men available to become LDS missionaries. Areas where LDS missionaries previously proselyted, became too dangerous for such activity and as a result all LDS missionaries were taken out of Europe.  Women of Faith in the War  World War I made women into more influential figures in society, due to their symbolic necessity in representing their faith. It was women of faith that actively engaged in provided aid, emotionally, physically, and spiritually, to Soldiers in need during the violence of the War. Additionally, women assisted in actual religious pursuits and activities. They held and supported positions that would not have been previously available to them. Catholic women were remembered helping Priests who were overloaded with the amount of spiritual and physical aid they felt needed to be administered. They worked under such responsibilities to help people come back to their faith in Jesus Christ. Women in the Protestant faith participated in similar ways, including providing care packages for Soldiers. They even took over parishes when the pastors of such parishes were busy in other endeavors during the war. It was during this time that women were symbols during the war of religious faith and devotion to supporting their countries.  Judaism  alt=Jews served in the war for several different reasons. They desired to unite with their fellow citizens and join with them in combat. The war also allowed for Jewish people to define themselves to the world. A huge driving factor for many Jews was the desire to engage in conflict against Russia, a nation that was known for being oppressive to Jews. Many felt the need to help their fellow Jewish comrades in dire circumstances. Due to the destruction of Habsburg Monarchy and the Russian Empire, new nations were formed that developed different relations with the Jewish people than before World War I. The Jews became more recognizable and distinctive in the new states established thus creating greater Jewish influence.Rozenblit, Marsha L., and Jonathan Karp. World War I and the Jews Conflict and Transformations in Europe, the Middle East, and America. Berghahn Books, 2017.  Islam  During World War I, the Ottoman Empire was under an immense amount of pressure to engage in the conflict. Leaders of the empire attempted to maintain neutrality for a time, but the pressure for inclusion only increased. The official religion of the Ottoman Empire during this time, was Islam, making joining the war was a topic of controversy in the Islamic state, as Muslim law includes strict guidelines in regards to involvement in wars. In October 1914, the Ottoman Empire faced enough pressure from Germany to agree to commence an attack on the Russian Navy stationed in the Black Sea. The Ottoman Empire deceptively claimed that they were attacked by Russia, hiding the fact that their presence in the Black Sea was to deliberately cause conflict with Russia. This event ultimately led to Russia's involvement in World War I. Many argue that the Ottoman Empire's involvement was strictly due to benefits they desired for the Islamic state. Muslim scholars have argued that their participation was really an attempt to enlarge the Islamic state and grow in power and influence.Zürcher Erik Jan. Jihad and Islam in World War I: Studies on the Ottoman Jihad on the Centenary of Snouck Hurgronje's \\"Holy War Made in Germany\\". Leiden University Press, 2016. During the war, 2.5 million Muslims fought for the Allies, and the majority were having problems on how to pray during the intense battles of trench warfare. References External Links * Jonathan H.

It stars Penélope Cruz, Édgar Ramírez, Gael García Bernal, Ana de Armas and Wagner Moura. It tells the true story of Cuban spies in American territory during the 1990s. The film had its world premiere at the Venice Film Festival on September 1, 2019. It was released in France on January 31, 2020, by Memento Films, and was released on June 19, 2020, by Netflix. Plot In Havana in the early 1990s, pilot René González leaves his wife Olga and daughter Irma in Cuba to start a new life in the United States. He secretly flies to Miami on a stolen plane (Antonov An-2). González soon joins a group of Cuban exiles and Castro opponents, Brothers to the Rescue, who operate from Florida and act against the Cuban government through military operations and also aim to disintegrate the Cuban tourism industry. They even fly over Cuban airspace. A Cuban secret organization named la Red Avispa, or the \\"Wasp Network,\\" is directed by Gerardo Hernández, also known as Manuel Viramontez. The Cuban American National Foundation (CANF) and Brothers to the Rescue not only launch propaganda brochures about Havana, and lead balseros from Cuba to the Florida shores, but also smuggle drugs and weapons. They also conduct terrorist activities in Cuba organised by Luis Posada Carriles. In 1996, two Cessna Skymaster from Brothers to the Rescue are shot down by Cuban MiGs over the Caribbean Sea, killing four aviators. Juan Pablo Roque is another Cuban pilot who defects by swimming to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base and asking for political asylum. He arrives in Miami, settles down and marries Ana Margarita Martínez, but after few years flies back to Havana making it very clear that he was a mole who had infiltrated anti-Castro associations. After months and many bureaucratic procedures, Olga and her daughter are allowed to leave Cuba and rejoin René in Miami. But before their travel, Viramontez informs Olga that her husband is not a gusano (Spanish for worm) or a traitor to the Castro regime but indeed is a hero and a Cuban intelligence agent who infiltrated the CANF, which she must keep secret for the security of all of them and the Wasp Network. In El Salvador in 1997, Raúl Cruz León is recruited by anti-Castroists to place C-4 bombs in Havana hotels. An Italian tourist dies and the same day he is caught by the Cuban police. After being caught the organization abandons him to his fate. Finally, René González, Manuel Viramontez and the entire Wasp Network are captured by the FBI, all face charges of conspiracy to commit espionage, conspiracy to commit murder, acting as an agent of a foreign government, and other illegal activities in the United States and face long prison terms if found guilty in the Federal Court of judge Joan A. Lenard. In an interview Fidel Castro defends the actions of the agents and their program. Despite the fact that the FBI offers to reduce his sentence in exchange for information, René refuses to cooperate. ;Aftermath: * Olga Salanueva-González was deported to Cuba after 3 months in prison. She was later reunited with her daughters Irma and Ivette and campaigned for the liberation of her husband. * René González served 12 years in prison. He was released on October 7th, 2011. * Gerardo Hernández aka Manuel Viramontez received 2 life sentences. He was released as a part of a spy swap after only serving 15 years. * Ana Margarita Martínez sued the Cuban government. She was awarded $27 million dollars in punitive damages. To this day, she has collected only $200,000. * Juan Pablo Roque was never a pilot again. Facing money problems, he sold his Rolex on eBay. * Raúl Cruz León is still serving a 30-year sentence. * Luis Posada Carriles died in 2018, aged 90.

She has been noted as one of the primary figures in Quebecois silent cinema and was likely one of the first female screenwriters in Quebec. In the early years of Francophone cinema in Canada, films were primarily focused on non-fiction topics; filmmakers produced newsreels, actualities, and travelogues. However, of the few fiction films produced, Emma Gendron was a notable female screenwriter alongside Marguerite Marquis. Gendron also became well-known for her column, Courrier de Manon, and also ran as a candidate in federal elections. Emma Gendron has been considered a key pioneer in French-Canadian cinema by numerous scholars.  Personal life  Gendron was born in the small Canadian village of Saint- Barnabé, Quebec, Canada in 1895. She was educated through a convent prior to starting work as a secretary at 13-years-old. In her early 20s, she moved to Montréal, Quebec, to study and later became a regular contributor to a number of local newspapers. During her career as a screenwriter in the 1920s and 1930s, she was rumoured to have been in a romantic relationship with film director Joseph-Arthur Homier, though he was married with children. Homier died in 1934, and Gendron married Allan Robert Green in 1939. Emma Gendron died in Montréal, Quebec, in 1952 of an asthma attack.  Career  = Journalism = After moving to Montréal in her 20s, Gendron became a regular contributor to Le Samedi and La Revue populaire, among other Quebec newspapers. In 1922, Gendron wrote her award-winning play Namounah, a drama about forbidden love between an Indigenous princess and a white man. The play gained significant attention from the Montréal press, and was awarded a drama prize from McGill University in 1922. = Screenwriting = Shortly after writing Namounah, Gendron met Joseph-Arthur Homier, who was making newsreel films about Montréal at the time. Gendron’s first screenwriting credit was for Homier’s feature-length film, Madeleine de Verchères (1922), a book adaption based on the tale of Quebecois heroine, Madeleine de Verchères. The film was successful in Canadian box offices, which led Gendron and Homier to release another film, La drogue fatale (1924). La drogue fatale (1924) failed to reach Anglophone-Canadian audiences and was not nearly as successful as Madeleine de Verchères (1922). Shortly after the release of La drogue fatale (1924), Homier and Gendron began working on their third film, Les fils de las liberté, which was to be a tale of the Quebecois rebellion against the British in the late 1830s. However, this film was never taken to the production stage. After the release of La drogue fatale and end of her work on Les fils de las liberté, Gendron returned to journalism in Montréal. She became well-known for her advice column, Courrier de Manon, in which she wrote as her persona, Manon. The column was later gathered in La Revue de Manon, a women’s magazine and film digest. In La Revue de Manon, Gendron wrote serial romances and gossip columns among other pieces. She also began writing serial novels and children’s comics that have been argued by some to be infamous for reproducing Rosicrucian ideas. = Politics = Before settling down with Allan Robert Green in 1939, Gendron ran as an independent candidate in the riding of Saint- Jacques in downtown Montréal during the federal election of 1935. She was the only female candidate from Quebec in the election, and even though she was not elected, Gendron still collected around 3,000 ballots. Similar to the ideologies in her novels and children’s comics, Gendron raised ideas from Rosicrucianism.  Films  = Madeleine de Verchères (1922) = Gendron’s first credited film, Madeleine de Verchères, was directed by Joseph-Arthur Homier and retold the story of a Quebec colony that was defended in 1692. Madeleine de Verchères was a 14-year-old historical heroine who was said to have saved the new colony from the Iroquois with the help of only a few settlers. The film was produced by the British American Film Manufacturing Company (BRIAM) and began production in 1912 near Montréal. During this time, many lost or forgotten Quebecois heroes were being brought back into the media. The film was shot on the Kahnawake Mohawk Territory south of Montréal and residents were employed as extras. After its release in 1922, modern reviewers and critics hailed the film for its historical realism. Though the film has been lost, archived newspaper articles described it as realistic and historically accurate. However, at the time of release, the film failed to be marketed to the National Historic Sites of Canada because federal historians found many inaccuracies. Madeleine de Verchères has been noted as the first feature film produced in Canada, and perhaps in all of North America. However, this is up for debate among academia and historians, since Evangeline (1913) was released first, but began production after Madeleine de Verchères. = La drogue fatale (1924) = Gendron and Homier’s second film together, La drogue fatale, was an urban crime drama, likely inspired by American gangster movies of the time. The film tells the story of twin orphans separated at birth, one of which is adopted by a police chief. The main plot focuses on a war between the Montréal police and drug mafia. In order to stop investigations, the mafia leader kidnaps the police chief’s daughter and causes her to become dependent on drugs. She is later freed by another member of the mafia, whom she ends up marrying. The film has Anglophone-sounding characters and included bilingual subtitles, but failed to reach English-speaking audiences. The film marks the end of Gendron and Homier’s filmmaking careers. = Les fils de la liberté (unfinished) = After La drogue fatale (1924), Homier and Gendron began work on another film, Les fils de la liberté. The film was to recall the Lower Canada Rebellion against the British Empire in 1837-1838, but was never pushed to production, likely because of the lack of success of La drogue fatale.

He was closely involved in the Chetham Society and its publications. Early life The son of Nathaniel Heywood (died 1815) of Heywood's Bank and his wife Anne Percival, daughter of Thomas Percival, and younger brother of Benjamin Heywood, he was born in Manchester on 3 September 1797; James Heywood was his younger brother. He was educated at Manchester Grammar School. He graduated B.A. from Glasgow University in 1815. Heywood was from 1818 a partner in Heywood's Bank, called the Manchester Bank and, from 1795, Heywood Brothers & Co., with his father's surviving brother Benjamin Arthur Heywood (died 1828), Benjamin, and (from 1820) Richard Heywood, another brother. He served the office of boroughreeve of Salford in 1826. In 1828 Thomas and Richard Heywood left the family business, which was carried on by Benjamin. At Hope End Thomas Heywood purchased Hope End, a mansion in Herefordshire, near Ledbury. It was sold in 1832 by Edward Moulton-Barrett, father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning who had lived there as a child; the sale was by auction on 25 August. Heywood went there to live, and was high sheriff of Herefordshire in 1840. Heywood died at Hope End on 20 November 1866. Before leaving Manchester Heywood collected a library of local books, which was dispersed in a sale in 1835. His general library was sold at Manchester in 1868. The house at Hope End was sold in 1867 to C. A. Hewitt. It was demolished in the 1870s; its stable block eventually became a hotel. Works Heywood was an early member of the council of the Chetham Society, and edited the following of its publications: * The Norris Papers, 1846. * The Moore Rental, 1847.

Established as a result of the Traction Ordinance in 1925, it was initially owned by the Shanghai Electric Company. The company took over Singapore's tram network, converting it to a trolleybus network by 1927. It acquired its first omnibuses in 1929, took over \\"mosquito bus\\" (seven-passenger buses) service in 1933, and became independent of the electric company in 1935. With only 20 operational trolleybuses at the end of World War II, a programme to restore full service by purchasing new buses was begun during the late 1940s. The company experienced a 15-week strike in 1947, and a 142-day strike over wages from 1955 into 1956. Trolleybus service ended in December 1962, and the company headquarters was moved from London to Singapore in 1964. By the late 1960s, the STC's financial state had worsened; with the April 1971 repeal of the Traction Ordinance, its losses mounted. With the company near bankruptcy, its buses were sold to Singapore's three other bus companies and the STC ceased operation in December 1971. History =Background= Singapore Traction Company trolleybus, c. 1930 The Shanghai Electric Company (SEC), which operated a trolleybus network in Shanghai, was approached to rehabilitate the Singapore tramway network during the early 1920s. Due to the poor state of the tram infrastructure, rehabilitation was deemed too costly and plans were made to convert the system to trolleybuses. The SEC began negotiations with Singapore's municipal government over a new traction ordinance. The ordinance included the conversion of the tram system to trolleybuses and the restructuring of the old tramway company. =Establishment and conversion of tram system= The STC was established in 1925 in accordance with the Singapore Traction (Transfer) Ordinance, which was passed by the Legislative Council in March of that year, to take over Singapore's tram network from Singapore Electric Traction and replace it with trolleybuses. The first two trolleybus routes began operation on 14 August 1926, and the last tram line was converted on 4 September 1927. The company received approval to operate motor buses on its existing trolleybus routes in 1929, and operated an experimental route between Geylang and Finlayson Green with seven buses. The buses, introduced to reduce travel time, were noted by a reporter for The Straits Times as having a smooth, comfortable ride. The motor-bus service was then expanded with the introduction of a route to Seletar in July of that year. STC revenue declined by £20,000 from 1931 to 1932 (during the Great Depression), due to the continuation of service despite reduced demand. By 1933, the company operated what was claimed to be the largest trolleybus network in the world: long, served by 108 vehicles. That year, negotiations began on articles and amendments to the management agreement to release the STC from Shanghai Electric Company control. =Mosquito-bus takeover= In 1933, with the failure of Southern Omnibus Services, the municipal government decided to transfer all mosquito-bus service to the STC by replacing the service with new routes and extending existing ones. The replacement of mosquito buses on the first few routes prompted commuter complaints about overcrowding, and the Municipal Commission recommended adjusting the route timetables. The STC added buses to its fleet and began express service on the Tampines Road route, the route with the most problems. The company bought out its Shanghai Electric Company ownership for £100,000 in 1935. The deal was delayed, however, when the Chancery Court granted an injunction to the Investment Trust Corporation and other STC shareholders because the STC did not have the required money. The STC successfully appealed the injunction on 1 May 1935. The management agreement between the companies was terminated in October of that year, when payment was made. In September and October 1936, STC bus drivers and conductors struck twice over split shifts and harsh working conditions. Two years later, STC workers went on strike again after four months of negotiations with the company falied. The strike continued for 15 days, with strikers unwilling to negotiate with the company until the government stepped in to arbitrate. The strikers were unwilling to accept arbitration, and the strike continued for almost a month before service resumed on 22 August 1938. =1940s and 1950s= Only 20 trolleybuses were found fit for service when Singapore returned to British rule, and operations were limited until new buses could be delivered. The restoration of full service was also delayed by a 15-week strike in 1947 over wages. Concerns about overcrowding on STC buses were also raised frequently in the media and by the Municipal Commission, and fines for breaches of regulation were increased in 1950. The company introduced buses for schoolchildren in April 1950, in response to a request made six months earlier. In September 1955, the STC refused to accept demands for 60- to 70-percent wage increases and over 2,800 employees went on strike. Although some of the workers attempted to run a free bus service, they were prevented from doing so. The STC chairman flew to Singapore for negotiations at the Labour Ministry, but no progress was made. Negotiations resumed in December 1955, reaching an impasse after a few days. The government convened a court of inquiry for the dispute, which recommended a wage increase. Management rejected the recommendations, saying that the company would incur a loss. After Chief Minister David Marshall warned that the STC might have its franchise cancelled, the company backed down and bus service resumed on the afternoon of 16 February 1956. =Demise= The STC discontinued trolleybus operations in December 1962. In January 1964, the company transferred its headquarters from London to Singapore; the Singapore company was formed by a new board, and the London company was voluntarily liquidated. Most of the company's shareholders were in Malaysia, and greater opportunity for expansion was possible in Singapore. By 1966, as a result of competition from pirate taxis (which resulted in the loss of about six million passengers in 1965), the STC was operating at a loss of $1 million per year. The company was unable to meet its payroll or acquire new buses, and its directors considered voluntary liquidation. The government's seizure of 1,000 pirate taxis and the resulting reduction of operating losses in 1967 averted the STC's financial collapse. However, the company continued to incur losses for the rest of the 1960s. In April 1971, with the adoption of the Wilson Report by the government, the Traction Ordinance was repealed and the STC had to compete on an equal footing with Singapore's other bus companies. The company's losses increased to $13,000 per day, leaving it nearly bankrupt. It was learned in November 1971 that the United Bus Company had made a bid for the STC's bus operations, with negotiations between the companies directed by the government. The following month, the STC concluded negotiations with the three other bus companies for the sale of its buses for about $2.7 million. In addition to acquiring the buses, the three companies hired 2,000 STC employees (including 1,700 drivers and conductors). Several mechanical workers were hired by the Ministry of Defence, and others were registered at Labour Ministry employment exchanges in Havelock and Bendemeer Roads. The company was placed in receivership by the Chung Kiaw Bank on 21 December 1971. The STC's Upper Aljunied Road bus depot was purchased by the three Chinese bus companies in 1972 for about $2 million, and its Mackenzie Road property was taken over by the government. Unsuccessful efforts were made to salvage the company over the next five years, and it was wound up in 1978. Fleet The initial fleet of trolleybuses acquired in 1926 consisted of chassis built by the Associated Equipment Company in England and bodies constructed in Shanghai, with assembly in Singapore. The trolleybuses, with a capacity of 32 passengers, had a two- class layout. The STC began replacing its 20-seat, petrol-powered motor buses with 30-seat heavy-oil buses during the late 1930s as part of a fleet renewal programme. After World War II, nearly all the company's buses were unusable as a result of deferred maintenance and the use of poor-quality lubricants during the Japanese occupation. The STC ordered new omnibuses and trolleybuses from the United Kingdom, which came into service in 1946 and 1947 respectively. The bus chassis were built in the United Kingdom, and the bodies were assembled in Singapore. By 1949, all but 10 of the STC's buses were modern vehicles ordered after the war; the total carrying capacity was higher than the pre-war level by 1950. In 1954, as part of an expansion programme, the STC acquired 24 new omnibuses and Singapore's first buses. The 30-foot buses, which had lighter aluminium chassis, were ordered as part of a plan to move the STC fleet towards fewer, larger buses. The company began a programme to convert its buses to aluminium bodies in March 1956, and invested $2 million in aluminium- body buses from Britain. In 1962, the STC replaced its trolleybus fleet with 35 Isuzu buses. The Japanese-built buses had automatic doors, telescopic shock absorbers and air suspension. In 1967, the STC acquired 50 37-seat Nissan buses at a cost of $1.5 million to serve the Toa Payoh housing estate. To pay for the buses, the company mortgaged its Mackenzie Road properties.

Daniel D'Addario of Variety described the series as \\"a delight that poses the question of what it really means to grow up, against a truly inviting backdrop,\\" and that Collins is \\"an inherently winsome performer who has never been quite as well used as she is here.\\" Kristen Baldwin of Entertainment Weekly gave the series a \\"B\\" and wrote, \\"If you need a five-hour brain vacation, Paris is a worthwhile destination.\\" The New Zealand Herald considered the show \\"visually delectable\\" and that \\"Collins has a pixie-ish charm which makes her endearing\\", but also that the show is \\"as ephemeral as fairy floss.\\" However, Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian gave the series one out of five stars, praising Collins for her \\"amiably breezy\\" performance, but warns viewers \\"the show is far better if you stop looking for rhyme or reason and just look at the scenery\\".

She is also a dentist, who graduated from the same university in 1976. She uses both of her father's surnames. Early life García was born in Caracas, to a family of UCV alumni. Her father, Dr. Raúl García Arocha, was a dentist and she soon picked up the skills from him. The García Arocha family have a long history of dentistry in Caracas. Her mother is Acela Márquez. Career García graduated with honours in 1976 from the UCV school of dentistry, she became a professor at the university in the School of Medicine. She later held relevant positions within the Faculty of Dentistry as an academic coordinator, the school director, and then became the first female Dean of the faculty. After her first term in this role, she was re-selected to continue for three more consecutive terms; the terms of three years each meant she headed Dentistry for twelve successive years (1993-2004). In her last year of Deanship, in 2004, García became part of the rectorial team of Antonio París, and París won the rectorship for that selection (2004-2008), and García was appointed university secretary, becoming the fourth woman to take this role. As secretary, she made considerable contributions to the restructuring of the Student Welfare Organization (OBE); she was a fighter for student rights and benefits, achieving improvements in the cafeteria services, transportation, and scholarships. In 2008, the team stood again, with García at the head, winning the second round of elections with 75% of the vote and so making history, with García the first woman to be rector of the Central University of Venezuela in its entire 286-year history. It was around the time of her departure from the Faculty of Dentistry that García completed a PhD in Management, also at UCV. She has been given various awards and otherwise recognised for her continued contributions to the university and for significant scientific and academic conferences; for example, she has been inducted to both the Order \\"José María Vargas\\" and the Order \\"Merit of Workers\\". During her time as rector, there have been many attacks at the university. From 2008 to 2014 García reported nearly 100 crimes to the authorities, which were not looked at until the 2014 protests that saw many students rebel against the government; when García was called to testify, the blame was put on her. The government recommended an armed military presence around the campus, despite the latest acts of violence being from the national guard, which García successfully resisted. At this hearing, it was also claimed that there were administrative irregularities, and in October 2014 an investigation was opened by the government alleging inconsistencies in staff payments made by García. During the 2019 presidential crisis, García lent her support and that of UCV to Juan Guaidó, and spoke out against the government preventing aid from entering Venezuela.

It has a circulation of 4,945.  History  The Democrat was established in 1838 by James Madison Rix. His operation ran out of a small room above Kent's dry goods store on Main Street in Lancaster. Not by coincidence, the first newspaper to appear in Lancaster had been established earlier that year; Richard P. Kent's White Mountains Aegis represented the Whig Party of Coös County. The Democrat was established to serve the Coös County Democrats by opposition. James Rix employed teenage boys as apprentices, as there were not many other jobs besides farming and professional trades in northern New Hampshire. Rix taught them the printer's trade as well as the ideology of the New Hampshire Democratic Party, predominantly the party's contempt for African Americans and abolitionists. Among the apprentices was Edward E. Cross, who Rix appointed as the foreman of the paper in 1847. The same year a young Charles Farrar Browne came to work for the Democrat, his mother sending him from Maine in a stagecoach. Browne proved to be too rambunctious for the editor, and ultimately Rix fired him. After his termination he became a humor columnist for The Plain Dealer under his pen name, Artemus Ward, which is the name he continued to use throughout his comedy career. James Rix remained editor until his death in 1856, upon which editorship shifted to Jared I. Williams, then to Charles D. Johnson. In 1859, Johnson moved the paper to North Stratford, and when he died a year later, the Democrat ceased publication. A portion of the plant materials were sold to Henry O. Kent, who used them to publish the Coös Republican out of the same office the Democrat first published from in 1838. In 1884, F. A. Kehew published the next edition of the Coös County Democrat, using the title and serial number of the last paper published over 20 years previously.

It begins with children who were disallowed proper parent-guardian relationships early in their youth, or were abused by an adult in their developmental stages in life. Belonging to the study of attachment theory, causes and symptoms are rooted in human relationships over the course of one's lifetime, and how these relationships developed and functioned. Symptoms typically focus around neglect, dysfunction, abuse, and trust issues in all forms of their relationships. These symptoms are similar to those of other attachment disorders, but focus more on relationships later in life rather than those in earlier years. To be considered to be suffering from AAD, you must demonstrate at least 2-3 of its symptoms. These symptoms include: impulsiveness, desire for control, lack of trust, lack of responsibility, and addiction. While the DSM-V does not recognize it as an official disorder, Adult Attachment disorder is currently being studied by several groups and treatment is being developed. Some of these studies suggest splitting AAD into two groups, avoidance and anxious/ambivalent. More >recent and advanced medical practice advocates for four categorisations; *Secure: Low on avoidance, low on anxiety. *Avoidant: High on avoidance, low on anxiety. *Anxious: Low on avoidance, high on anxiety. *Anxious and Avoidant: High on avoidance, high on anxiety.  Symptoms and specifics  Adult Attachment Disorder develops when an attachment disorder, such as Reactive Attachment Disorder, goes untreated in youth and continues on into adulthood. Although symptoms are no longer carbon copies of what they were in childhood, they are significantly similar to them. Some researchers have begun to suggest that this is because adult relationships are similar to the relationship between infants and caregivers in that they are a type of attachment. Similarities between the two types of relationships include, but are not limited to: a feeling of safety when in proximity to your partner, close contact, shared interest and preoccupation with each other, and engaging in \\"baby talk\\". While there are similarities to other attachment disorders, Adult Attachment Disorder is starting to be recognized as its own disease due to some of the symptoms that are not present like in other attachment disorders. Some of these symptoms include: greater likelihood of addiction, impulsiveness, behaviors that are socially negative or inappropriate, desire for control, trust issues, unwillingness to accept responsibility, helplessness, anxiety, superficial positivity and depression. Even though the DSM-V does not yet recognize Adult Attachment Disorder per se, many places are doing research on it and proposing therapies to help deal with the disorder. There are many different levels of severity dealing with the disorder. All of them could benefit from therapy. There are multiple types of therapies that have claimed to at least partially treat this disorder. Some meant for prevention of disorders, mostly families who have experienced these disorders prior. Other therapies include outpatient, residential and wilderness therapy. Most of the therapies researched emphasize effective communication, as well as problem solving strategies. They also focus on finding the roots to the attachment that most likely evolved sometime in early childhood. Included in these is a controversial treatment known as attachment holding or \\"in arms\\" treatment available for caregivers and adolescents. This therapy believes a child must release their frustration with caregivers before they are able to trust them.

The riot took place as members of the British Union of Fascists and various anti-fascist protesters clashed following a meeting of Fascists at the Pier Pavilion. The riot involved a series of clashes along and close to the length of South Street from the Pier Pavilion and the Royal Arcade at its southern end to the junctions with Warwick Street and Market Street further north. Background Unemployment was high in the 1930s in Worthing and elsewhere in Sussex and England following the Great Depression. On 31 March 1930, Charles Bentinck Budd was elected to the Offington ward of West Sussex County Council. Later that year, Budd, who lived at Greenville, Grove Road, Worthing, was elected to the town council as the independent representative of Ham Ward in the Broadwater area of the town. In 1933 Oswald Mosley relaunched his 'New Party' as the British Union of Fascists, following a visit to Benito Mussolini in Italy. One of the first branches of the BUF was set up by Budd in Worthing, who attracted a good deal of publicity through various high profile antics and numerous visits to the town from Mosley and William Joyce. At an election meeting on 16 October 1933, Budd revealed he was now a member of the British Union of Fascists (BUF). Budd was re-elected and the national press reported that Worthing was the first town in the country to elect a fascist councillor. Budd stormed out of the Town Hall when other councillors refused to give him the committee places he desired and attacked the Council for refusing to allow the Fascists to hold open-air meetings at the site of the old fish market near Worthing Pier, a privilege that was allowed for the Salvation Army. One of the BUF's sternest critics locally was Roy Nicholls, chairman of the Young Socialists. At the town's Literary Institution, Nicholls debated with a Blackshirt and led a motion condemning Fascism which was overwhelmingly carried by the audience. According to Hare, many of the people supporting the Fascists were either new to the town or formed part of the town's Italian community, which had existed since the 1880s. John Robert Peryer, a maths teacher at the Worthing High School for Boys, became one of the leaders of the anti-fascist movement in Worthing. With Marion Barber, wife of Worthing's first Labour councillor, Peryer formed the local branch of the International Friendship League. Events On the morning of the Fascist rally, the words \\"No more war. Damn Mosley. Fight Fascism\\" were written in tar on Worthing Town Hall. Also, tar was spread on the walls of the Fascists' headquarters on Marine Parade. Posters that had been put up to advertise the Fascists' rally bearing the text \\"Mosley speaks\\" were defaced to read \\"Gasbag Mosley speaks tripe\\". In the evening, Mosley gave his speech in the Pier Pavilion to a background noise of singing, chanting and fireworks that were let off by opponents outside. The meeting finished around 10pm and Mosley emerged surrounded by his bodyguard of 16 handpicked thugs. Mosley underestimated the hostility and size of the crowd, of whom it was estimated there were around 2,000. The Blackshirts marched out of the Pavilion and fireworks were thrown as protesters sang \\"Poor old Mosley's got the wind up\\" to the tune of John Brown's Body. Fist fights took place and Mosley took part in the fighting. The Fascists fought their way to Mitchell's Cafe in the Royal Arcade and barricaded themselves inside as opponents smashed windows and threw tomatoes. As it neared midnight, the Fascists broke out and marched along South Street to the junction with Warwick Street. Followed by anti-fascists, the Fascists ran up South Street to find their route blocked by a hostile group at the junction with Warwick Street. At the time, Warwick Street contained many of the town's more up-market shops and was known locally as \\"the Bond Street of Worthing\\". From there, the Fascists continued to the junction with Market Street where there another hostile group lay in wait, leading to a break-out of fighting along Market Street. One woman bystander was punched in the face in what witnesses described as \\"guerrilla warfare\\". There were casualties on both sides as a \\"seething, struggling mass of howling people\\" became engaged in running battles. Francis Skilton, a Solicitor's clerk from Worthing who had gone to post a letter at the Post Office in Chapel Road and went to see what was happening was \\"savagely attacked by at least three Blackshirts\\". A bystander named John Birts carried Skilton to Worthing Hospital, away. Robert Poore, an Italian Post Office messenger living in Worthing, was also attacked by the Blackshirts and taken to hospital. Fighting only ended when a large number of police force arrested three Blackshirts to the cheers of the crowd. The arrested Blackshirts were Mosley, Joyce and a Bernard Mullens, of Chelsea, London. Aftermath Joyce was later charged with riotous assembly and assault but they were acquitted two days into the trial at Lewes Court of Assizes for lack of evidence. The events ensured that no further large-scale Fascist marches took place in Worthing. Further confrontations with Fascists took place on 5 November 1934. In the days leading up to Bonfire Night a number of anti-fascists were beaten up and Bonfire Night saw some retaliation against the Fascists. At least one Fascist was thrown into the sea and nearly 1,000 people gathered outside the Beach Hotel where it was alleged that a Blackshirt was staying.

During his career, he made over 50 appearances in the Football League. After attracting attention as an amateur player, he signed for Cardiff City in 1967 and made his professional debut soon after. However, a broken ankle and strong competition for places limited him to nine league appearances over three seasons. During his time with Cardiff, he became the first player to score a headed hat-trick in a European competition during a match against Mjøndalen IF in 1969. He moved to Bristol Rovers in 1970 for £12,500, scoring 18 league goals in 57 appearances. After a brief loan spell with Swansea City in 1973, he moved to South Africa. Early life Born in Forfar, Allan grew up in the village of Killiecrankie. At the age of fifteen, he began working in a mine alongside his father in the nearby town of Tullibody. However, after three months, the family relocated to Yorkshire. Career =Early career= Allan began his football career as an amateur, featuring for Barnsley and Doncaster Rovers. He was offered a part-time contract with Welsh side Rhyl, managed by Albert Dunlop, who were playing in the Cheshire League. He developed a reputation as a prolific goalscorer for Rhyl, earning himself the nickname \\"The Boy with the Golden Boots\\". His form attracted attention from several clubs and Dunlop personally travelled with Allan in an attempt to secure a transfer. The pair later met Tony Kay, who warned Allan that Dunlop was using the transfer as a way of making money for himself. Allan instead returned to Rhyl where the chairman confirmed the suspicions and instead contacted Cardiff City. =Cardiff City= After impressing manager Jimmy Scoular, Allan joined Cardiff in 1967 for a fee of £12,500. He made his professional debut for the club on 19 August 1967, the opening day of the 1967–68 season, in a 1–1 draw with Plymouth Argyle. In his second appearance a month later, Allan suffered a broken ankle. After an extended period out, he made his return to the first team over a year later, scoring his first senior professional goal during a 2–0 victory over Bury. Despite scoring eight times in eleven matches during a tour of Mauritius and Zambia on his return, Allan found first team opportunities limited due to the presence of several senior forwards at the club, including John Toshack, Brian Clark and Bobby Brown. Allan later stated that he was largely overlooked as \\"Jimmy Scoular, thought the club could sell John Toshack and kept playing him.\\" Although he continued to struggle for league appearances during the 1969–70 season, Allan did feature for the club in the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. On 1 October 1969, he became the first player to score a headed hat-trick in a European club competition when he achieved the feat during a 5–1 victory over Norwegian side Mjøndalen IF during the second leg of their first round tie. All three of the goals were scored during a seven minute spell of the first half, later described as \\"a header at the near post, one at the far post and a diving header in the middle.\\" =Later career= In March 1970, he left Cardiff to sign for Bristol Rovers, again for a fee of £12,500. In March 1973, he was allowed to join Swansea City on loan, being signed by manager Harry Gregg. He scored one goal in seven league appearances before returning to Bristol. He left Bristol in March 1974, moving to South Africa where he played for Cape Town City. He later had a spell as player-manager of non-league side Harrogate Railway Athletic.

In the stratosphere, null cycles and when the null cycles are broken are very important to the ozone layer. One of the most important null cycles takes place in the stratosphere, with the photolysis of ozone by photons with wavelengths less than 330 nanometers. This photolysis produces a monatomic oxygen that then reacts with the diatomic oxygen producing ozone. There is no net molecular or atomic change, however, this reaction converts the energy from the photons into heat energy warming the stratosphere.\\"The Stratosphere - overview\\". scied.ucar.edu.

One important example is NOx emissions into the stratosphere. The NOx reacts with both the atomic oxygen and ozone leading to a net decrease in ozone.This is particularly important at night when NO2 cannot photolyze.

Early life Chaplin was the third son of Sir Francis Chaplin, Lord Mayor of London in 1677, and his wife Anne Huett, daughter of Daniel Huett of Essex. He was admitted to Middle Temple in 1685 and to Inner Temple in 1688. He was called to the bar in 1692. In 1696 he married Anne Harrington.Peerage.com Career At the 1715 general election Chaplin was elected Member of Parliament for Great Grimsby, a constituency represented by businessmen of doubtful character, in particularly those associated with the South Sea Company. He was created baronet in 19 September 1715. In 1717 he became a bencher of Inner Temple. His friend Sir James Bateman persuaded him in 1718 to become a Director of the South Sea Company. The Company used dubious practices to inflate the value of its stock, and when the Bubble burst in 1720 thousands of investors lost their investments. The Government intervened and sequestered part of the estates of the main participants in the company for paying compensation. The Directors were barred from sitting in Parliament or holding public office. Chaplin was therefore expelled on 28 January 1721. Chaplin was examined by an investigation committee, and argued that he had not been party to any fraud and had not taken any stock. However it was discovered that he had accepted stock as a loan.

It is a sort of template, or standardized lease, that is applied to rental units for periods in the future when there is no contracted tenant. The term \\"market\\" refers to the idea that these predictions should match average values seen in the wider real estate market, the fair market rent, as opposed to making assumptions based on the existing tenant's cash flows. For instance, if a particular unit has a tenant with a lease that runs for the next two years, and the valuation is examining the next five years, the MLA would be used to estimate the cash flows for that unit for the last three years of the projections. An MLA would not be used if there is another lease already signed for that unit covering that period. Some units may have a speculative lease or option as well, when there is a prospective tenant that has not yet signed the legal lease agreement. These typically override the MLA. An MLA often has two \\"sides\\" or \\"legs\\", with different assumptions. One leg assumes the current tenant renews the lease with a set of given changes (or none), and the other assumes the tenant leaves the unit and a new tenant takes over. In the later case, it is normally assumed the lease terms will revert to market averages. The chance that the current lease will be renewed, the renewal probability, varies from tenant to tenant. This leads to two possible future budgets for each unit that uses an MLA. These values are blended in various ways to produce a single predicted value. The primary considerations in an MLA are the inflation of the rent and recoverable expenses, the amount of time the unit may lay vacant if the tenant leaves, known as down time, and any inducements the owner may offer the tenant to renew their lease or to a new tenant to sign. The MLA may be radically different than the existing lease, in the case where the lease is percentage rent for instance, but is normally designed to provide smooth transitions to make the cash flows more reliable.

Depending on the contents, the concept may be known as a concession or rent abatement, instead of inducement. There are several different forms of inducements. One common one is a signing bonus, a direct payment of some sort but generally not related to the rent. One particular form of bonus is the lease pickup, where the landlord will pay penalties for breaking an existing lease. Another common type of inducement is some period of free rent, typically one or two months, as a reward for signing for a particular period of time. Free rent may also be known as rent abatement, a specific use of a term that may also be used more generically. Inducements can also be provided in the form of compensation for tenant improvements, which takes the form of either direct payments that the tenant can use to improve the rental unit, or similar renovations carried out by the landlord. The roll of real estate agents and real estate brokers is sometimes conflated. The United States Department of Labor explains that, \\"Brokers and agents can represent either the buyer or the seller in a transaction.

The tehsil consists of 195 revenue villages and 1 census town. The tehsil headquarter is located in the town of Kherwara Chhaoni. The tehsil is part of the Kherwara panchayat samiti (block).  History  Before the formation of the Republic of India, the territory of present-day Kherwara tehsil was part of the former Udaipur State. As of 1940, Kherwara was one of the 8 districts of Udaipur State (possibly with boundaries similar to present- day Kherwara tehsil). With the formation of the United State of Rajasthan (precursor to the state of Rajasthan) in 1948, the new district of Udaipur was constituted which included the area of present-day Kherwara tehsil. In 2008, 79 villages were carved out of Kherwara tehsil to form, along with 19 villages from Sarada tehsil, the new tehsil of Rishabhdeo. Geography The area of Kherwara tehsil is 594 square kilometres. The tehsil is bordered by Jhadol tehsil to the north, Rishabdeo tehsil to the east, Dungarpur district to the south, and the state of Gujarat to the west. Major highways in the tehsil are National Highway 8 and State Highways 10 and 48. The annual average rainfall in Kherwara tehsil is 594 mm, with an average of 30 rainy days per year.

Wagdi is the predominant language used in the tehsil, it being the mother tongue for 91% of the population of the tehsil. Because of its predominant scheduled tribe population, Kherwara tehsil has been designated a scheduled area which allows special protection of tribal culture and other interests.

She won the Icelandic championship in 2011 and 2013 as a member of Keflavík and has won the Icelandic Basketball Cup three times, in 2008, 2011 and 2015. Playing career After being part of Grindavík's successful junior programs, where her group won several junior Icelandic championships, she played her first games with the senior team during the 2005-2006 Úrvalsdeild season. She won her first major trophy on 24 February 2008 when Grindavík defeated Haukar, 77-67, in the Icelandic Cup finals. On 25 November 2009, she tore her anterior cruciate ligament in a game against Haukar in the Úrvalsdeild and missed the rest of the season. After recovering, she joined Keflavík prior to the 2010-2011 season and helped the club win both the national championship and the Icelandic Cup, where she was a key player down the stretch in Keflavík's 62-72 victory. On 21 September 2011, she again tore her anterior cruciate ligament, this time four minutes into Keflavík's first game of the Company Cup, and missed the rest of the season. In August 2012, Ingibjörg signed with Aabyhoj in Denmark. She returned to Keflavík in February 2013 and finished the season with the club. She won her second national championship with Keflavík on 29 April 2013. After the season, she left Keflavík and signed with Grindavík. Ingibjörg helped Grindavík win the Icelandic cup in 2015 despite suffering an early injury during the game. During the 2016-2017 season, she again had problems with injury, missing several games because of broken ribs. With several other key players missing games due to injuries, Grindavík's season ended in a disappointment as the team was relegated to 1. deild kvenna. Ingibjörg missed the 2017-2018 season due to pregnancy but returned to the team in September 2018. In April 2019, she helped Grindavík defeat 1. deild kvenna champions Fjölnir, 3-0, in the promotion playoffs for a seat in the Úrvalsdeild. National team career Ingibjörg played 16 games for the Icelandic national basketball team from 2007 to 2016.

She is credited with aiding in saving the United Irishwomen in the 1920s and giving it a pragmatic direction. Early life Gertrude Lucy Franks was born in Westfield, County Laois, on 27 February 1878. She was the daughter of landowner Matthew Henry Franks and Gertrude Franks (née Despard). Her aunt by marriage was Charlotte Despard. Franks attended Alexandra College, Dublin, and having left school she returned home to care for her invalid father. In 1912 she joined the United Irishwomen, and five years later she helped found a local UI branch in Castletown. In 1923, the family home at Westfield was burnt down during the Irish Civil War, and the family moved to Blackhill House, Abbeyleix. Her father died in 1924, and Franks left Ireland for a period to travel in England and South Africa, returning to Ireland in 1926. United Irishwomen Upon her return she found that the years of political upheaval had effected the UI, with just 8 branches left and less than a hundred members. She focused all her energies on revitalising the organisation, with her main objective to make it as useful as possible to women, giving them practical skills to improve their lives. Having learnt basket making in England, she set up basket and tray making classes, and encouraging members to sell their products. She was a member of the Royal Dublin Society by 1927 and organised a stand at the spring show to sell member's work. At the annual spring show the UI's stand was called \\"Countryside workers exhibit\\", showing products made by weavers, mat makers, basket makers, spinners, and work from Montessori school children. In 1929, Muriel Gahan became involved in the show, and worked with Franks at the offices of the UI in 33 Molesworth Street, Dublin. Gahan came up with the idea of establishing a permanent shop in Dublin to sell more of the produce of their members. The result was the Country Shop, at 23 St Stephen's Green and ran from 1930 to 1978. It was managed by the company Country Workers Ltd, with Franks sitting as director until her death in 1964. A restaurant was added to the shop at Franks' suggestion, with Gahan acknowledging later that this was the most successful part of the business. Franks was a founding member of the Associated Country Women of the World (ACWW) in 1927. In 1936 at the triennial ACWW conference in Washington, Franks spoke about the functions and goals of the newly renamed UI, which has become the Irish Countrywomen's Association (ICA) in 1935. She was the national president of the ICA from 1942 to 1952. Under her guidance the ICA craft workers founded a guild, monitored by judges and tests. She also initiated a garden scheme, which turned crossroad plots into roadside gardens, and oversaw fund-raising country fairs. During her presidency plans were set out for a permanent residential college in which the summer schools could be held. In 1953 the college, An Grianán in Termonfeckin, County Louth was opening with funding from the Kellogg Foundation. Later life In 1952, Franks was named a buan chara (honorary life member) as she retired from her presidency. She died on 12 July 1964, and is buried at Deans Grange Cemetery. Ireland hosted the triennial ACWW conference in 1965, during which a garden house at An Grianán ICA college was dedicated to her memory.

He was a leading member of the Centre du Regroupement Africain and served twice as Minister of External Commerce of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from June until September 1960 and from August 1961 until April 1962.  Biography  Marcel Bisukiro was born on 27 September 1929 in Kamayi, Rutshuru Territory, Kivu Province, Belgian Congo to a Nyarwanda family. He attended middle school in Nyangezi. He later worked as a clerk for the Office dès produits agricoles du Kivu. Bisukiro cofounded the Centre du Regroupement Africain (CEREA) party in Bukavu in 1958 and assisted in establishing several new chapters. He also acted as the commercial director of the party publication, Vérité. Bisukiro had connections with foreign leftists and took a programmatic approach to his politics. In August 1959 Bisukiro was elected secretary general of the party. That year he was also elected to the Kadutu communal council. He attended the Belgo-Congolese Political Round Table Conference of January–February 1960 as a deputy delegate for CEREA and participated in the subsequent Economic Round Table Conference. The Lumumba Government shortly after its investiture; Bisukiro stands fourth from the left. In the general elections of 1960, Bisukiro was elected by the Provincial Assembly of Kivu to serve in the Senate on a non-customary, CEREA ticket. In June 1960 he was appointed by Patrice Lumumba to serve as Minister of External Commerce in his government. After Lumumba's dismissal, he continued to hold the office under Joseph Iléo, but later in the year he fled the capital to take up the same portfolio in Antoine Gizenga's rival government. On 19 March 1961 Bisukiro founded a journal, Dignité Nouvelle, in Bukavu. Negotiations between various factions resulted in the investiture of a new government on 2 August under Cyrille Adoula, and he returned to his post as Minister of External Commerce in the central government. On 13 April 1962 a motion of censure was tabled against him in the Chamber of Deputies. The petitioning deputies stated that his commercial activities in the private sector were constitutionally incompatible with his ministerial duties, accused him of scheming to sell Virunga National Park to foreigners, and suggested that he was of \\"non-Congolese\\" nationality. Though he was vociferously defended by Chamber First Vice-President Joseph Midiburo, following the debate the motion of censure was passed, 58 votes to six with seven abstentions, and Bisukiro was dismissed from his post. In November the Adoula Government decreed a state of military rule and arrested Bisukiro and three other parliamentarians on charges of plotting rebellion. On 23 November the Chamber forced the government to rescind its actions. After ending his service in Parliament he worked as a businessman. In 1964 a new constitution was ratified that marginalised Rwandan immigrants. Bisukiro criticised it as discriminatory. On 1 July 2010 he was awarded the Grand Cordon of the Ordre National Héros Nationaux Kabila-Lumumba by President Joseph Kabila. Bisukiro died on 7 June 2016. His body was flown to Goma on 12 July, where it was received at the airport by the Provincial Governor of Kivu and the President of the Provincial Assembly and given honours by the police. After a funeral procession toured the city, the body was brought to the locality of Kahanga, Rutshuru Territory and was buried in a family cemetery. A wake was held for him at the Rugabo II stadium in Rutshuru.

History  Locomotive 'Pilaa' on the mill yard of Kilauea Sugar Co. in 1895 (probably Dale W. Anderson Collection) The Kilauea Sugar Plantation imported in 1881 a steam locomotive and the material needed for constructing the track. John Fowler & Co., based in Leeds, England, delivered a complete package of 4,248 railway sleepers, rails, bends and switches, hardware and other products, as well as several tons of coal, in addition to the Fowler narrow gauge steam locomotive with works No 4085. It arrived in Honolulu on 27 August 1881 aboard The City of Glasgow from Glasgow, Scotland, and was subsequently shipped from there to Kauai.Hank Soboleski: The Kilauea Sugar Plantation Company railroad. 29 January 2017. Retrieved on 6 September 2018. On 24 September 1881, the track construction work began when Princess Lydia Pākī, later Queen Lili'uokalani hit the first spike in one of the railway sleepers. C.V. Houseman managed the track laying work. At the end of November 1881, a route had already been laid and put into operation. In 1882, the plantation acquired by the Hohenzollern Locomotive Works another locomotive, which was built in Düsseldorf with the factory number 284 and Kilauea was called. The plant also acquired in 1894 and 1902 the locomotives Pilaa and Kahili from the Baldwin Locomotive Works in Pennsylvania. The network consisted in 1910 of permanent track and portable track, 200 sugarcane transport cars, six sugar transport cars and four locomotives. The locomotives could each haul up to ten cars loaded with sugar cane.  Route  The track was the first laid on the territory of Hawaii. The long mainline began at the northern end of Aalona Street in Kilauea and led southwards over Kolo Road onto Pukalani Square. It crossed the Kuhio Highway and headed then southwards along Kuawa Road, crossed Waiuli Dam and crossed the Puukumu Stream for a total of . The second, also long line led from the sugar mill to Kahili Landing, where the packaged, ground sugar was loaded onto the steamers anchored at Mo'ko'lea Point using a wire rope winch. It started halfway on Kilauea Road, then northwards and eastwards to Makanaano Square and ended at Kahili Landing above Mo'ko'lea Point. There the ships anchored to be loaded with 125 pounds (57 kg) sugar bags each. The operations at Kahili Landing and on the railway line leading there were abandoned in 1928, whereupon the sugar was transported from the sugar mill to Ahukini Landing for shipment. A third line started at the Lili'uokalni Street crossed the Kilauea River on a wooden trestle bridge and ended in the ahupua'a of Lepeuli. Remnants of the former Kilauea Sugar Plantation railway and the Ko'olau ditch can be seen in Lepeuli.Hope Kallai: Newly exposed Archaeological site Ahupua\`a of Lepeuli, Ko\`olau District, Hanalei Division, Island of Kauai, Hawaii State Beach bordering TMK: (4) 5-1-003:003. The sugar cane transport was carried out with five steam locomotives. Each of the locomotives could haul up to ten cars loaded with sugar cane. The railway operation was ramped-down in late 1939, because truck transport proved to be more advantageous. By the spring of 1942, road transport had replaced railway locomotives and trucks were used to transport sugar cane to the Kilauea mill.  Sugar mill  The company was founded in 1880 in Hawaii under the name Kilauea Sugar Company Limited. It was called Kilauea Sugar Plantation Company after it had been bought in April 1899 by a Californian company. The company's headquarters were in San Francisco, California, with a local office in Kilauea. The company's commercial agency in Honolulu, CA Brewer and Company Ltd, became the major share holder of the company in 1955, which was subsequently renamed Kilauea Sugar Company Limited again. Eventually, the sugar company extended over more than 10,000 acres in 8 ahupua’as. Approximately, 4,500 acres were used as sugar cane fields and approximately 2,000 acres as ranch land.Gary E. Smith: Kilauea Town History. The operation was closed-down on 31 December 1971.  Environmental pollution  Plantation worker standing amidst containers marked “poison”, 1914 The photographs of a herbicide poison train taken in 1914 alarmed the Health Department’s Hazard Evaluation and Emergency Response Office to investigate and mitigate the environmental pollution caused by the sugar cane industry.

A Butterfield dial was named after the English gnomonist, Michael Butterfield who was active in Paris around 1690. Description They were constructed with a hinged gnomon, whose angle could be adjusted for the latitude; the latitude was indicated by the beak of a bird. The gnomon was held in place by a rivet which was displayed by the birds eye, and thumbscrew. The dial plate would have three chapter rings for 44°, 48° and 52° which would be sufficiently accurate to be used between 35° and 60° (roughly between Gibraltar to the Shetland Isles). There would also be a compass and a plumb bob. Michael Butterfield Michael Butterfield (1635-1724) was a British clockmaker who moved to Paris about 1663. He worked at the royal court was appointed engineer to the King Louis XIV. He opened a shop selling precision instruments in 1677 in rue Neuve-des-Fossés, in Saint- Germain. He sold all types of sundial, but dominated the market for the small travelling dial with the adjustable gnomonwith bird motif and three chapter rings. This type of dial became fashionable and called the Butterfield dial. This type of dial was known before Butterfield manufactured them, for instance Roch Blondeau and Timothee Collet, and other instrument makers in Paris and beyond, continued to make them particularly after his death. Among his international clients was the Russian Czar Peter the Great who visited his shop in 1717 and ordered a great quantity of gilt copper dials. Other manufacturers Nicolas Bion (1652-1735), in his 1709 book, *The Construction and Principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments on page 322 and plate 26, gives a clear description of the construction and usage of such dials. Traité de la construction et des principaux usages des instrumens des mathématique, Nicolas Bion, 1709, Paris. He had premises in Quai de l'Horloge du Palais, Paris.

Ancient South Arabian art was the art of the Pre-Islamic cultures of the southern Arabian peninsula, which was produced from the 3rd millennium BC until the 7th century AD.Der Brockhaus Kunst.

Mannheim 2006  History and development  Old Arabian inscription from 3rd century BC South Arabia, in an Old South Arabian language. İstanbul Archaeology Museums Old Arabian art experienced its first flourishing at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC at the time of the South Arabian classical culture,Dated by the long chronology. centred on the kingdoms of the Sabaeans and Minaeans in modern Yemen. The 5th century BC marked the golden age of Saba, whose main centres were Ma'rib and Sirwah. The region was known to the Romans as 'Arabia Felix' (Fortunate Arabia) as a result of its wealth. The Geometric, stylised forms typical of ancient South Arabian art, both in sculpture and in architecture, took on smoother forms form the 5th century BC. The kingdom of the Nabataeans, established in the northern part of the Arabian peninsula in the late 4th century BC acted as an intermediary between the Arabian cultures and those of the Mediterranean. The kings of Himyar gained control of South Arabia at the end of the 3rd century AD. With the Islamic expansion in the second half of the 6th century AD, South Arabian art was displaced by early Islamic art.  Periodisation Since scholarship on ancient South Arabia has long concentrated on philological investigation of Old South Arabian inscriptions, the material culture of South Arabia has received little scholarly attention, so that little work has been done on the provenance of artefacts. Periodisations have only been developed for some regions and a general periodisation of South Arabian art is not yet possible. As a result, ancient South Arabian artefacts are categorised by stylistic features, not chronology. A general division of South Arabian art into three periods has been proposed by Jürgen Schmidt. According to him, the first phase sees the individual motifs begin to develop, the second sees the individual artistic forms become canonised, and in the last period there is some influence from foreign styles, particularly Greek art.  Architecture  = Construction methods= Decorated capital of a pillar from the royal palace of Shabwa; stratigraphic context: first half of the 3rd century BC. Unlike Mesopotamia, ancient South Arabia was dominated by stone buildings. Only in the coastal areas and the Hadhramaut capital of Shabwa were there also large numbers of mudbrick structures. For monumental buildings, large hewn blocks of stone were used, which were fitted together without mortar and unhewn stone which required mortar. Lime mortar, mud, and asphalt were used as binding materials. In tall walls, vertical lead props and horizontal pins and brackets were inserted as well. Only the exterior face of the stones was smoothed. Larger walls were often double-shelled, with the rough sides of the stones abutting one another inside the wall. Possibly for aesthetic reasons, the walls of monumental structures were sloped, and buttresses or small bastions helped maintain the stability of the wall. In the 5th century BC, a new kind of stoneworking appeared, in which the edges of the stones were polished, while the centre of the exposed faces were pecked. This 'marginally drafted' style changed over time, making a chronological arrangement of walls built in this style possible.Gus W. Van Beek, \\"Marginally Drafted, Pecked Masonry,\\" in: Richard Le Baron Bowen Jr.; Frank P. Albright: Archaeological Discoveries in South Arabia (Publications of the American Foundation for the Study of Man, Volume 2) Hopkins Baltimore, 1958, pp. 287–299. Interior walls were either plastered (sometimes featuring wall paintings) or covered with stone cladding, with paintings imitating ashlar blocks and sometimes even three-dimensional friezes. Little is known about ceiling construction, although vaulting survives in pillbox-graves - simple gabled roofs decorated with images. 3 cm thick translucent marble or alabaster sheets, sometimes with incised decoration, served as window panes. Columns were a very important structural element. Until the 5th century BC, they were undecorated monoliths with rectangular or square cross-sections. This sort of column is found in the entrance hall of the Awwam temple and Ḥaram-Bilqīs in Ma'rib, for example. From the 5th century BC, the corners were reduced until eventually they became round columns. From the 5th century, columns also had capitals - initially simple plinths, which subsequently developed into various forms.Grohmann, Arabien pp. 210–214 From the 2nd century BC, these forms were significantly influenced by Hellenistic architecture and later Sasanian influence is detectable. = Secular architecture= Plan of the inner city of Shabwa Archaeological excavations of ancient South Arabian settlements reveal a highly developed civic culture with complex irrigation techniques. For example, the Marib dam dates back to the 9th century BC and remains of it are still visible today. Substantial remains from the 6th century BC can still be seen. There were cities with public buildings made from polished limestone blocks with inscriptions naming their builders, along with city gates, fortifications, streets, temples, markets, and royal residences. As the inscriptions show, numerous fortified cities (hagar) existed in pre-Islamic South Arabia. Archaeology has so far only revealed civic facilities; unfortified settlements have not yet been investigated archaeologically. The cities were often located in valleys on natural or artificial raised areas, which protected them from floods. Cities were also founded on plateaus or at the feet of mountains, as in the case of the Himyarite capital, Zafar. The majority of ancient South Arabian cities were rectangular or nearly rectangular, like Ma'rib and Shabwa. A notable example of this rectangular city plan is the Minaean capital city, Qarnawu.Grohmann, Arabien, pp. 143–144 The rectangular plan of that city has a main street running through the centre and side streets bisecting it perpendicularly at regular intervals, which indicates central planning, either at the time of original foundation or after a destruction event. However, round and entirely irregular city plans are also found. Compared to other Near Eastern cities, the ancient South Arabian cities had a relatively small total area; the largest city of South Arabia, Ma'rib, covered only 110 ha. All cities were protected by a city wall (two consecutive walls in the case of Shabwa), with at least two gates, which could be protected by towers. The course of the walls, which was either simply structured or included bastions, had to follow the terrain, especially in mountainous regions, and this is what created irregular city plans. Sometimes cities were protected by citadels, as in Shabwa, Raidan, Qana', and the Citadel of Rada'a.Jean-François Breton: Les fortifications d'Arabie méridionale du 7e au 1er siècle avant notre ère (Archäologische Berichte aus dem Yemen, 8) Philipp von Zabern, Mainz 1994 Ruins of Khor Rori Due to a lack of archaeological investigation, the civic centres are so far only poorly known. In Timna in Qataban, there was a large open space inside the southern gate, from which streets ran in various directions. In addition to the normal residential buildings, fortresses, palaces and temples have been detected in various cities. Substantial excavations have only been undertaken at Khor Rori and Shabwa. At Shabwa, too, a large open space was located on the inside of the gate, with the royal palace located on one side of it. From this open space, a wide street ran directly through the city, with smaller streets crossing this main street at right angles. In addition to civic fortifications, there are also other fortifications, which were located at important crossroads or key points in the irrigation system. Substantial ruins of such fortresses still exist,e.g. Hermann von Wissmann, Maria Höfner: Beiträge zur historischen Geographie des vorislamischen Südarabien (Abhandlungen der geistes- und sozialwissenschaftlichen Klasse der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Jahrgang 1952, Nr. 4). Verlag der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur in Mainz, Mainz 1953, pp. 137–139 and photograph 15, where the ruined castle of Ḥuṣn el-ʿUrr in Hadhramaut is described. but none have been excavated. Even so, it is clear that these fortresses contained residential quarters as well as temples and water sources. To secure whole areas, barrier walls, which blocked passes and similar bottlenecks, were built, like the wall of Libna, which would have blocked the road from Qana' to Shabwa. Due to the climate, irrigation systems were necessary for agriculture. The simplest elements of these systems were various kinds of well and cistern. The largest cisterns could hold up to 12,800 m³. For the efficiency of these wells and citadels, canal networks were essential. These collected and stored the water from the wadis when it rained. The most impressive example of these structures is the Dam of Ma'rib, which blocked the Wadi Dhana with a span of almost 600 m and channeled its water through two sluice gates into two \\"primary canals\\", which distributed it to the fields by means of a network of smaller canals. Such structures have been detected or attested by inscriptions elsewhere as well. In Najran, aqueducts were carved into the cliffs to lead the water away. In various places in South Arabia, especially in mountain passes (manqal), paved roads were built, which were sometimes many kilometres long and several metres wide. = Religious architecture = 3d model of Sabaean altar found in the vicinity of Barran Temple in Marib Compared to secular structures, temples are generally better known, so that it has been possible to develop a possible typology and history of development. In the following, the systems proposed by and (in more detail) M. Jung are described, which take into account both the floor plans and the actual appearance of the structure.Jürgen Schmidt, \\"Altsüdarabische Kultbauten.\\" Werner Daum (ed.): Jemen. Pinguin-Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau- Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, pp. 81–101. This replaced the typology of which only took account of the different types of floor plan; Handbuch der Altertumswissenschaft, Kulturgeschichte des Alten Orients, Dritter Abschnitt, Vierter Unterabschnitt: Arabien (München, 1963), pp. 157 ff. Comparatively few temples have been excavated to date, so these schemas remain provisional. The oldest south Arabian sanctuaries belong to the prehistoric period and were simple stone monoliths, sometimes surrounded by stone circles or mortarless masonry walls. In a second phase, actual temples were constructed. These temples were simple rectangular stone structures without roofs. Their interiors were initially very different from one another. Some cult buildings at Jabal Balaq al-Ausaṭ southwest of Ma'rib, which consist of a courtyard and a tripartite cella, provide a link to a temple type found only in Saba, which had a rectangular ground plan and a propylon and was divided into two parts - an inner courtyard with pillars on three sides and a tripartite cella. Schmidt includes in this type the temple of the moon god Wadd built around 700 BC between Ma'rib and Sirwah at Wadd ḏū-Masmaʿ, as well as the temple built by Yada'il Dharih I at Al-Masajid, which is surrounded by a rectangular wall. Later examples of this schema are found at Qarnawu (5th century BC) and (1st century BC). The entrance hall of the great Temple of Awwam in Ma'rib might belong to this group. This temple dates from the 9th-5th centuries BC and consisted of an oval ashlar structure which was over 100 metres long and was linked to a rectangular entrance hall, which was surrounded by a peristyle consisting of 32 five-metre high monolithic pillars. Only a few traces of this structure remain today. In the other kingdoms, this type contrasted with the hypostyle 'multi-support temples' which were built with square, rectangular or even asymmetrical ground plans and were surrounded by regularly spaced columns. In contrast to the aforementioned Sabaean temples, these structures were not arranged around a cella or an altar. Initially these temple contained six or eight pillars, but later they ranged up to thirty-five. Klaus Schippmann has identified yet another type: the Hadhramite 'terrace temple', seven examples of which are known to date.Schippmann, Geschichte der alt- südarabischen Reiche, p. 112. See also Alexander V. Sedov, Temples of Ancient Ḥaḍramawt. Arabia Antica 3. PLUS, Pisa 2005 All these temples are accessed by a great stairway, which leads up to an enclosed terrace, on top of which stands a cella with a podium. It is still unclear whether there were images of deities, but the statuettes of humans which were dedicated in the sanctuary of Ma'rib demonstrate that highly developed bronze casts existed by the middle of the 1st century, on which the individual donor was recorded by means of an inscription. Stone pedestals with dedicatory inscriptions show that votive statuettes made of precious metals and bronze were created in Himyar until late antiquity. There were also alabaster statuettes - figures wearing smooth, knee-length robes, with their arms outstretched.  Sculpture  Funerary stele, in the upper band: banquet scene with three people, in the lower band: camel driver with two camels; 1st-3rd centuries AD; alabaster; height: 55 cm (21 in.); Louvre-Lens (Lens, France) The most remarkable artworks aside from architecture from pre-Islamic South Arabia are sculptures. In addition to bronze (and occasionally gold and silver), limestone was a common material for sculptures, especially alabaster and marble. Typical features of ancient South Arabian sculpture are cubic base forms, a plump overall shape and very strong emphasis on the head. The rest of the body is often depicted only in a schematic and reduced fashion; often only the upper body is depicted at all. Much South Arabian art is characterised by minimal attention to realistic proportion, which manifests with large ears and a long, narrow nose. In most cases, sculpture in the round and reliefs faced directly at the viewer; in reliefs the frontal perspective typical of ancient Egyptian art, in which the head and legs are depicted from the side, but the torso from the front, is occasionally encountered. Pupils were made of coloured material which was inserted into holes in the eyes. Initially, drapery was not depicted, but later it was indicated by deep grooves or layers. There are no general characteristics in the arrangement of arms and legs. There are very few examples of large ancient South Arabian sculptures, so the inscription on an over-life-size bronze statue of the son of the Sabaean king is of particular interest. It reveals that the statue was made by a Greek artist and his Arabian assistant. Much more common are small alabaster statues, portraits and reliefs, which generally depict people and more rarely animals or monsters (dragons and winged lions with human heads), and whole scenes in the case of flat reliefs. A particularly popular scene shows a vine bearing grapes with animals or birds nibbling at it and a man who aims a bow at an animal (or variations thereon). Scenes from life are also depicted in reliefs, such as feasts, battles, and musical performances, as well as scenes of the dead meeting with a deity.  Minor arts  Geometric wall painting from the Temple of al-Huqqa (1st century BC) Alongside the larger artworks, ancient South Arabia also produced a whole range of different smaller artefacts. As elsewhere, ceramics were a major medium, but it has not yet been possible to arrange this material typologically or chronologically, so unlike in the rest of the Near East it does not help to date individual stratigraphic layers. Some general statements are still possible, however. The manufacture of ceramics was very simple; only part of the vessel was turned on a potter's wheel. Jugs and bowls of various sizes are common, mostly decorated with engraved or dotted motives, but painted patterns and attached bumps, prongs, or even animal heads are also found. In addition to these everyday ceramic items, some pottery figurines have also been found. Smaller stone artefacts include bottles, oil lamps, vases, and vessels with animal heads as handles. Intaglios and imitations of Egyptian scarabs. In addition to these, there are also various friezes attached to various parts of buildings, which include zigzag patterns, tessellations, perpendicular lines, dentils, niches, small false doors, and meanders, as well as floral and figural elements, including series of ibex heads and grape vines. Other common artistic elements in buildings include rosettes and volutes, ears of corn, and pomegranates. In two excavations, wallpaintings have also been discovered: geometric paintings in the temple of al-Huqqa and figural paintings from the French excavations at Shabwat. Artefacts in wood have not survived, but stone images of furniture allow us some insight into ancient South Arabian woodworking. Hadhramite Metal bowl (2nd–3rd century AD) On the other hand, small bronze and copper artefacts are common, including vases and other chased copper or bronze vessels, lamps, handles and animal figurines. Jewellery is also common, including partially golden necklaces, gold plates with images of animals and small golden sculptures. Numismatics ʿAmdan Bayyin of Raidan (Type 9) As in other cultures of the ancient 'periphery' which minted coinage, the ancient South Arabian coinage was modeled on ancient Greek coinage. Silver coinage is well known from South Arabia, while bronze and gold coinages are comparatively rare. The following typology generally follows that of Günther Dembski.Günther Dembski, Die Münzen der Arabia Felix. In: Werner Daum (Hrsg.): Jemen. Pinguin- Verlag, Innsbruck / Umschau-Verlag, Frankfurt a. M. 1987, S. 132–135, . The numbering of the coin types only partially reflects a certain chronology. # The oldest South Arabian coinage was probably minted around 300 BC. It consists of imitations of Old style Athenian tetradrachms, with the head of Athena on the obverse and an owl, crescent moon, and olive twig on the reverse. Unlike their models, however, the South Arabian coins were marked with indications of their denomination: full units with the lett n, half units with a g, quarters with a t, and eighths with an s2. # A somewhat later series has various monograms and/or letters on the reverse whose significance is not yet understood. # The third, Qatabanian group has a head on both faces, with the name of the minting state, Harib in Timna, on the reverse. # The next group is probably also Qatabanian. An owl again appears on the reverse, along with the name Shahr Hilal, the letters ḏ and ḥ, and the 'Yanuf-monogram'. # Sometime in the 2nd century BC comes the following type, which imitates the New Style Athenian tetradrachms, while retaining the legends and monograms of the earlier coins. # The sixth type is distinguished from the preceding type, since it has no inscription, only symbols or monograms. # Perhaps in connection with the expedition of Aelius Gallus in 25 BC, elements of Roman coinage appear in this minting. # A single Hadhramite group seems entirely different. They depict a bull labelled as the god Sin, the name of the palace s2qr, a head with a radiant crown or an eagle, in various arrangements.On this type and its variants: S. C. H. Munro-Hay, \\"The coinage of Shabwa (Hadhramawt), and other ancient South Arabian Coinage in the National Museum, Aden,\\" Syria 68 (1991) 393-418 # This type is particularly significant for the history of South Arabia. It bears a head on the reverse, with the name of a king and minting state (usually Raidan) and monograms. # There are some isolated bronze coins which have a head with letters on the obverse and an eagle on the reverse. They are probably from Hadhramaut. The end of South Arabian coinage is not certainly dated, but was probably somewhere around AD 300.

Fish and Wildlife Service On 21 April 1910, the United States Congress assigned the responsibility for the management and harvest of northern fur seals, foxes and other fur-bearing animals in the Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, as well as for the care, education, and welfare of the Aleut communities in the islands to the United States Bureau of Fisheries.AFSC Historical Corner: The Pribilof Islands Tender Vessels Retrieved September 4, 2018 The Fish and Wildlife Service – renamed the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) after a 1956 reorganization – assumed these responsibilities when it replaced the Bureau of Fisheries in 1940. Since 1917, the Bureau of Fisheries and Fish and Wildlife Service had operated a \\"Pribilof tender\\" – a dedicated supply vessel used to transport passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilof Islands – and by 1962 the Fish and Wildlife Service had deemed the most recent tender, MV Penguin II, too small to continue in the role and in need of replacement. In October 1962, the U.S. Army agreed to loan FSR-791 to the USFWS's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF). The BCF renamed the reactivated ship Pribilof and placed her in service in 1963 as the newest Pribilof tender, basing her at Seattle and assigning her to support the USFWS's Marine Mammal Resources group. The USFWS found Pribilof well-suited to the role of transporting passengers and cargo to and from the Pribilofs and permanently removed Penguin II from service in 1963. In 1964, the Army transferred Pribilof to the USFWS. starboard quarter view of MV Pribilof. Pribilof usually made three to four voyages to the Pribilofs each year, and during visits to the islands she made shuttle trips between Saint Paul Island and St. George Island and conducted offshore pelagic fur seal research cruises. She also participated in search-and-rescue efforts during her voyages; notably, after the American Liberty ship Oduna was wrecked at Cape Pankof on Unimak Island in the Aleutian Islands in Alaska on 26 November 1965, Pribilof came to her assistance. and aided in the rescue of 37 survivors from Oduna. Around 1968, a proposal was made to retire Pribilof and turn over her duties to chartered vessels as a means of saving the USFWS an estimated US$100,000 per year. A USFWS study of the idea concluded that the retirement of Pribilof would result in the loss of essential services, including the end of her support to pelagic fur seal research, the loss of an ability to transport doctors. medicines, and patients to and from the United States Public Health Service hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, and the loss of transportation services between Saint Paul and St. George Islands for outgoing United States Mail, incoming U.S. Mail that included breakables that could not be delivered via airdrops, perishable goods, emergency repair of equipment, emergency services, United States Government officials, teachers, students, and people involved in cultural and recreational exchanges.

NOAA On 3 October 1970, a major reorganization occurred which formed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) under the United States Department of Commerce. As part of the reorganization, the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries was removed from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and placed under NOAA,Guinan, John A., and Ralph E. Curtis, \\"A Century Of Conservation,\\" noaa.gov, April 1971 Retrieved August 22, 2018 and ships of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheres fleet joined those of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in forming the new NOAA fleet. At first, the major ships that were to constitute the new fleet reported to separate entities, with former Coast and Geodetic Survey ships subordinate to the National Ocean Survey (the Coast and Geodetic Survey's successor organization within NOAA), while former Bureau of Commercial Fisheries ships reported to the Bureau's successor within NOAA, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). During 1972 and 1973, however, the ships of the National Ocean Survey and National Marine Fisheries Service, as well as those of the Environmental Research Laboratories, integrated to form a consolidated and unified NOAA fleet, operated by the National Ocean Survey's Office of Fleet Operations.noaa.gov AFSC Historical Corner - Timeline of Significant Events Retrieved August 23, 2018 Pribilof, however, was not transferred to the combined NOAA fleet, and was operated and maintained directly by the NMFS until her decommissioning. Pribilof remained active under the NMFS. For example, in 1973 – at which time she had a crew of 19 – she made five voyages between Seattle and the Pribilof Islands, delivering provisions to the inhabitants of the islands and returning to Seattle with sealskins, blubber, frozen seal meat for use as food on mink farms, and heavy equipment in need of repair. By this time, however, weekly commercial flights from Anchorage also were transporting mail, medicine, and perishable goods to and from St. Paul Island. By 1966, the Aleut residents of Saint Paul Island already had begun a transition to self-sufficiency and local self-government, and in that year the U.S. Congress passed the Fur Seal Act, which required that the residents of the Pribilofs gain control of their local government and economy, including the harvesting of fur seals. Accordingly, the NMFS began turning over U.S. Government land and buildings and the fur seal operations in the Pribilofs to the local population in the 1970s. As part of this process, NOAA decommissioned Pribilof in 1975, bringing the 58-year history of the operation of \\"Pribilof tenders\\" by the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (1917–1940), Fish and Wildlife Service (1940–1956), U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (1956–1970), and NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service (1970–1975) to an end. Later career After Pribilof′s decommissioning, the NMFS sold her to the Aleut Corporation, which signed a long-term agreement with the NMFS to use her in transportation services between Seattle and Alaska and to supply the U.S. Government base at Adak in the Aleutian Islands. Eventually, Pribilof was converted into a factory ship for fish processing at sea. Lafayette Fisheries purchased her in 1983, and Trident Seafoods acquired her in 2004. As of 2013.

(\\"Codelfa\\") is a widely cited Australian contract law case,Codelfa Construction Pty Ltd v State Rail Authority of NSW which serves as authority for the modern approach to contractual construction. (2012) 29 Journal of Contract Law 26 The case greatly influenced the development of the Eastern Suburbs railway line. In terms of contract law, the case addresses questions of frustration, construction and the parol evidence rule. The case diverged from the well established English approach regarding the use of extrinsic evidence in contractual interpretation.. (2012) 29 Journal of Contract Law 183.  Background  The State Rail Authority engaged Codelfa Construction under a contract for services to excavate tunnels in the Eastern Suburbs allowing for the development of the Eastern Suburbs railway line. The works were to include \\"the excavation of two single track tunnels commencing at Edgecliff and running through Woollahra to Bondi Junction, an open cut excavation at the site of the Woollahra Station, and an underground excavation at the site of the Bondi Junction Station.\\" The State Rail Authority issued Codelfa Construction with a notice to proceed on 7 March 1972. From this date, Codelfa was bound to complete all works within 130 weeks. On the basis of legal advice the contracting parties were led to believe that the work would be exempt from injunction as it was authorised by s 11 of the City and Suburban Electric Railways (Amendment) Act 1967 (NSW),. supposedly providing crown immunity. In 1972 Codelfa Construction commenced the work in three shifts each day for seven days a week. However, the noise generated by their underground drilling led several local residents and Council to apply for an injunction. On 28 June 1972, the Supreme Court of NSW granted an injunction, significantly restricting the work that could be performed after 10 pm and on Sunday. Codelfa Construction incurred additional costs to complete the required work within the agreed-upon timeframe. = Procedural History = Pursuant to an arbitration clause,referred to as a Scott v Avery clause by reference to . within the contract, the parties started arbitration proceedings in 1976 to establish whether Codelfa Construction could recover the additional costs by reason of an implied term or alternatively if the contract was frustrated to recover the reasonable value of the services provided (quantum meruit). As the arbitration proceedings had no jurisdiction with regard to frustration of the contract, they dealt principally with the issue of an implied term in the contract. The arbitrator found that a term could be implied into the contract to the effect that the deadline could be extended if workable hours varied. Both parties issued summons in the Supreme Court of NSW to reach a determination on a number of questions raised in the proceedings. Codelfa Construction alleged that the contract had been frustrated and further alleged that an implied provision of the contract, to pay a reasonable sum for work performed, had not been met. The State Rail Authority's allegations were to the effect that Codelfa Construction was bound to complete the works. Following the arbitrator's decision, a case was commenced in the Supreme Court of NSW. In his judgment Justice Ash found that the contract had not been frustrated, instead he extended the implied term found by the arbitrator to also account for the understanding that work's could not continue where an injunction was granted. On appeal, Justices Reynolds, Glass and Samuels of the Court of Appeal varied Justice Ash's implied term but reached the same conclusion that an implied term could be found in the contract but that the contract was not frustrated. Codelfa Construction then appealed to the High Court challenging the finding regarding the action in frustration. The State Rail Authority cross-appealed on a number of grounds centrally challenging the court's assertion that a term could be implied into the contract.  The High Court Decision  = Construction = According to the parol evidence rule, it can be said that where a contract is wholly in writing \\"verbal evidence is not allowed to be given of what passed between the parties, either before the written document was made, or during the time that it was in a state of preparation, so as to add to or subtract from, or in any manner to vary or qualify the written contract.\\". In order to ascertain whether the contract is wholly or partly in writing the court will consider the oral statements which parties claim forms part of the final contract. On this point the law is uniform in Australia and the United Kingdom. The rationale behind contractual construction, as explained by J.W. Carter, is not to infer the subjective intentions of the parties or give meaning to a term of a contract consistent with those subjective understandings. Instead, the goal is to give meaning to the contract that is consistent with what a reasonable person in the position of the contracting party would have understood the term to mean. (2014) 32 Journal of Contract Law 36. In implementing this principle, British and Australian courts have diverged in their allowance of extrinsic evidence which is said to form part of the \\"surrounding circumstances\\" of a contract when determining the meaning and effect of contractual terms. In English law courts may consider the \\"matrix of fact\\" surrounding the formation of the contract. The \\"matrix of fact\\" extends to the words and conduct of the contractual parties, common industry knowledge and any other factor which may have affected the reasonable person's understanding of the language of the contract. The Court will interpret the meaning of the contract in light of these circumstances. In Australian law however the High Court deviated from the English rule of contractual construction and instead held that Australian courts should follow the 'true rule' of contractual construction.  The 'true rule'  Justice Mason held that: Under this rule extrinsic evidence of the surrounding circumstances and commercial objectives of a contract may only be referred to where the Court has established that a term of a contract is ambiguous. However, Justice Mason did not define the kind of ambiguity required to meet the requirements of the 'true rule'. = Implied term = The court considered whether a term could be implied into the contract allowing for a reasonable extension of time to complete the works given the delays caused by the injunction. The High Court rejected that a term could be implied, holding that it was impossible to formulate a term with appropriate clarity and precision. Further, even if it could be established that such a term would be necessary to give business efficacy it could not be held \\"so obvious that it went without saying\\" that the contracting parties intended for such a term to form part of their contractual relationship. = Frustration = However, Codelfa Construction succeeded on the second ground of appeal, with the majority finding that the contract was frustrated. In coming to this determination, the court followed the definition of frustration laid out in Davis Contractors Ltd v Fareham Urban District Council.. That is that \\"frustration occurs whenever the law recognises that without default of either party a contractual obligation has become incapable of being performed because the circumstances in which performance called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract\\". Therefore, the critical issue which the court had to determine was whether the situation resulting from the grant of an injunction rendered the situation \\"radically different\\" from that which was contemplated at the time of contractual formation. On this point, Justice Aickin said:  Consequences  A number of decisions made by the High Court following Codelfa contradicted the 'true rule' including Maggbury Pty Ltd v Hafele Australia Pty Ltd,. Pacific Carriers Ltd v BNP Paribas,. and Toll (FGCT) Pty Ltd v Alphapharm Pty Ltd.. Following this apparent shift in judicial opinion, numerous intermediate appellate courts and lower courts followed the principles established by Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society. The 'true rule' was understood by many courts to have lapsed in favour of the English approach to contractual construction. However, in other High Court cases the 'true rule' was affirmed as the correct approach to contractual construction. In Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust v South Sydney City Council,. the court indicated that the decision remained good law in Australia. In that case, the High Court noted that ambiguity must first be established before referring to extrinsic evidence. The court held that the use of the term \\"may\\" introduced ambiguity into the contract, and could refer to an exhaustive or inexhaustive number of considerations. This has attracted criticism from many academics, who have found that the term \\"may\\" was not open to ambiguity. Further, they argue that this demonstrates the difficulty of applying the \\"true rule\\" and determining which contextual factors are truly extrinsic to the language of the contract. Furthermore, an application for special leave for a case to be heard in the High Court in Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd,. the bench stated that Codelfa remained good law in Australia. Justices Gummow, Bell and Heydon noted that primary judges and intermediate appellate courts are ‘bound to follow that precedent' until the High Court holds otherwise. As an application for special leave is a procedural motion rather than a substantive hearing the statements of the bench did not establish a binding precedent. However, this application for special leave is notable for being published in the Australian Law Reports and representing the unambiguous judicial opinion of three justices of the High Court. Yet in Mount Bruce Mining Pty Ltd v Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd,. Chief Justice French, as well as Justices Nettle and Gordon made clear that lower courts had been incorrect in identifying Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd, as an authoritative statement on the correct approach to contractual construction, as a procedural motion in itself is not binding in Australian law. Decisions such as Electricity Generation Corporation v Woodside Energy Ltd,. and Mount Bruce Mining Pty Ltd v Wright Prospecting Pty Ltd, have involved the High Court applying the approach set out in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society, despite affirming the 'true rule' in Western Export Services Inc v Jireh International Pty Ltd. This suggests that Codelfa may no longer be good law in Australia. The New South Wales Supreme Court has taken the view that Codelfa no longer represents the view of the court and as such has moved towards accepting the English approach laid out in Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society. As the authority of the Codelfa decision remains an unsettled point in Australian law many issues have arisen in contractual construction at lower level courts. One common practice used to circumvent this issue has been the use of recitals at the start of the contract, per Adventure Golf Systems Australia Pty Ltd v Belgravia Health & Leisure Group Pty Ltd.. This allows the contract to be read in light of circumstances that both parties agreed at the time of formation were relevant to the interpretation of terms. Legal scholars have noted that this is a significant area of law, in which a binding decision in favour of Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society, or in favour of Justice Mason's 'true rule' would have significant implications for contractual disputes. = Lower Courts = At present contractual construction in Australian law is not consistent and uniform between different states and territories, with lower courts and intermediate appellate courts adopting different positions in relation to Codelfa. The Supreme Court of NSW in Mainteck Services Pty Ltd v Stein Heurtey SA,. supported the conclusion that Investors Compensation Scheme Ltd v West Bromwich Building Society, had been accepted in Australian law, therefore, ambiguity did not have to be pointed to before referring to 'surrounding circumstances'. This position was supported by the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia in Stratton Finance Pty Ltd v Webb.. However, the Western Australian Supreme Court has stated that Codelfa remains good law in Australia in Technomin Australia Pty Ltd v Xstrata Nickel Australia Operations..

The three Constitutional acts concerning human rights are Chapter 2 of the Instrument of Government, Regeringsformen, the Freedom of the Press Act, Tryckfrihetsförordningen (1949) and Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression, Yttrandefrihetsgrundlagen (1991). Additionally, the European Convention on Human Rights has been incorporated into Swedish domestic law since 1995. Sweden regards itself as a global leader in protecting and advocating human rights. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, their position on human rights is strongly linked to democracy and the rule of law. In May 2018 an independent human rights expert of the United Nations, Obiora C. Okafor, praised Sweden's contribution to human rights internationally due to its financial support to international organisations and promoting human rights. Sweden has been regarded for its soft power diplomacy in promoting new human rights norms and challenging the international state of affairs. Sweden is not exempt however from domestic human rights breaches. Key areas for severe concerns include equality before the law, discrimination, race and social issues, the peaceful enjoyment of property and protection of asylum seekers.  History of human rights  The first protection of human rights in Sweden dates back to the mid-14th Century with the Konungabalk (\\"King's Chapter\\") found in the Landslagen (the General Law of the Realm). The Konungabalk was Swedish's first written constitution. It contained an oath for all succeeding monarchies in Sweden to \\"defend justice and truth and put down injustice, falsehood and lawlessness\\" and to \\"keep faith with the commonality of the realm, to injure neither rich nor poor in life or limb except after trial in accordance with the law of the realm, neither to deprive any man of his goods except by due legal process\\". The royal oath expressed an intention to adhere to fundamental principles of human rights such as the right to trial and protection of life and limb. This expression formed the basis of Article 16 of the Instrument of Government of 1809. Article 16 was the only proviso relating to human rights in the old Constitution. The Article reads: \\"The King shall maintain and further justice and truth, prevent and forbid iniquity and injustice; he shall not deprive anyone or allow anyone to be deprived of life, honour, personal liberty or well-being, without legal trial and sentence; he shall not deprive anyone or permit anyone to be deprived of any real or personal property without due trial and judgement.... he shall not constrain or allow to be constrained the conscience of any person, but shall protect everyone in the free exercise of his religion...\\". Although this is more a \\"general declaration of principle\\" it shows Sweden's early recognition of fundamental principles of human rights. The death penalty, often considered to fundamentally abrogate human rights was practised in Sweden for a long time. During the 16th and 17th Centuries 68 offences carried the death penalty, including crimes of theft, forms of adultery and religious offences against God. It wasn't until 1921 that the Riksdag formally abolished the death penalty for crimes committed in peacetime. The last state execution took place in 1910.  Key sources of rights in the Constitution  Sweden's legal protection of human rights developed significantly in the 20th Century with the modernisation of the Constitution and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression and the Freedom of Press Acts. Protecting human rights in the Constitution means that ordinary law is subordinate and may not operate if they are contrary to the rights set out. Human rights set out in Sweden's constitutional law are difficult to amend and require a more thorough process than ordinary law. =Chapter 2 of the Instrument of Government= Sweden's modern Constitution was enacted in 1974 with the inclusion of Chapter 2 named 'Fundamental rights and Freedoms'. The chapter protects four types of rights: positive freedoms, negative freedoms of opinion, physical rights and rule of law guarantees. (pg 102). Article 1 protects positive freedoms of opinion including freedom of speech, freedom of information, freedom of assembly, to name a few. Articles 2-3 protects negative freedoms of opinion such as coercion regarding political, religious, cultural, or other opinions as well as the requirement for consent for citizens to have their political opinions publicly registered. Articles 4-8 outline the physical rights to integrity and freedom of movement such as no capital punishment, no one to be subject to torture or no citizen to be refused entry to Sweden. Articles 9-11 outlines the rule of law principle that ensures each citizen is entitled to procedural guarantees. (pg. 102). Articles 12-13 protect against discrimination against people on grounds of ethnicity, gender, sexuality. Article 15 protects individuals right to private property and the right to public access of land or buildings. =Freedom of Press Act= Freedom of press is a well established right in Sweden being protected since 1766. In 1766 Sweden incorporated freedom of the press into its constitution, being the first country globally to do so. This constitutional law abolished censorship in printed publications as well as guaranteeing public access to government documents. In 1949 the Freedom of Press Act was enacted and superseded the existing acts. Article 1 of Chapter 1 on the freedom of press outlines that it is to be \\"understood to mean the right of every Swedish citizen to publish written matter, without prior hinderance by a public authority or other public body, and not to be prosecuted thereafter on grounds of its content\\". In 2018 Sweden was ranked the second on the World Press Freedom Index. =Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression= The Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression 1991 is largely similar to the Freedom of Press Act set out above. Both are fundamentally protecting the right of expression and speech. Whilst freedom of speech has been protected in Sweden since 1766, it initially only extended to written published documents. There was no other mention of other types of freedom of speech until 1974. Article 1, section 1 of the Act sets out the aim of the Act to guarantee every citizen's right to publicly express themselves. The Act protects all Swedish citizens right to express themselves freely on the radio, TV, films, video and the internet. The Act also lists freedom of expression offences such as defaming someone or threatening domestic security through publication.  Sources of human rights in International Law  International law and conventions provide a key framework for protecting human rights in Sweden. Sweden abides and is a signatory to multiple international agreements concerning human rights. International standards for human rights found in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights all influence Sweden's domestic and foreign human rights policy. The United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the foundational document for modern human rights and has largely influenced international conventions and treaties that Sweden is a signatory to. The European Convention on Human Rights (EHCR) which was incorporated into Swedish domestic law from 1 January 1995 forms part of Sweden's protection of rights and freedoms. Sweden is a \\"dualist state\\" in its adoption of International Law such as the ECHR thereby requiring a special act by the Swedish government for treaties and conventions to take effect domestically. There was however no law or science to back this up but a political jurisprudence from the Swedish supreme court. The practical significance of this older jurisprudence was that the Swedish government refuses to accept judgments based on treaties not implemented in law why the supreme court had to shape its views after the will of the government, which at that time generally prescribed to varying anti-rights or rights nihilistic opinionshttp://www.ioir.se/Tystnadsspiralenreg.pdf http://www.ioir.se/Huntford_och_EK.pdf http://www.ioir.se/biblioir9910.htm#b4. Since Sweden has ratified the EHCR this in practice means that the Swedish Court must interpret cases with respect to the articles of the EHCR. The Convention guarantees specific right and freedoms as well as prohibiting negative freedoms and unfair practices. Some of the rights include: right to life, freedom from torture, right to a fair trial, freedom of expression and right to education.  Human rights influencing foreign policy  Sweden's position on human rights has influenced their foreign policy and bilateral relations with other countries. In recent times Sweden has adjusted its relations with other states due to their domestic abrogation of human rights. = Saudi Arabia = In 2015 relations between Saudi Arabia and Sweden became tense after Margot Wallström, foreign minister of Sweden, delivered a speech to Swedish parliament stating that human rights were violated in Saudi Arabia and that she would pursue a feminist foreign policy. Saudi Arabia recalled its ambassador from Sweden and stated it would no longer issue business visas for Swedish citizens. The diplomatic affair resulted in the termination of a long- standing arms deal between Saudi Arabia and Sweden. Saudi Arabia was the third largest non-Western buyer of Swedish arms and bought approximately $37 million euros of arms in 2014. Sweden prioritised its human rights policy, in particular in regards to women's rights in their relations with Saudi Arabia. = Uganda = Another instance where Sweden has favoured human rights obligations over bilateral relations was in the early 2000s when Uganda proposed a bill that instituted the death penalty or life imprisonment for homosexuality. Sweden condemned the legislation and adjusted its foreign aid to Uganda due to the \\"appalling\\" anti-gay law. Sweden along with donors such as the World Bank, Norway and Denmark withheld aid of approximately $110 million from Uganda due to the law. = Russia = Sweden has been vocal in criticising Russia for their human rights violations. The relationship between Sweden and Russia has been termed \\"cool neighbours\\" due to past conflicts and diverging ideologies and views. Although relations between the two states is relatively stable in recent times, Sweden is critical of some of Russia's policies. According to Sweden's ambassador to Russia, Peter Ericson, Sweden has \\"a lot to teach Russia in terms of free speech\\".  Current issues  According to Amnesty International some areas for concern of human rights in Sweden include discrimination, rape and sexual violence and the protection of asylum seekers. = Race = Sweden's current anti-discrimination laws have eliminated the term race, replacing the term with \\"ethnicity\\" to denote \\"national or ethnic origin, skin colour or other similar circumstances\\". Michael McEachrane in a 2018 study considers the exclusion of the term race means Sweden is not able to \\"recognise, monitor, or address structural racial discrimination even as a possible universal human rights issue\\". McEachrane outlines the nature of racial discrimination pertinent to Sweden with housing segregation of non-European backgrounds such as African or Middle Eastern living in low-income neighbourhoods. A report released by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) in May 2018, highlighted that “racist hate speech against Afro-Swedes, Jews, Muslims and Roma” is particularly prevalent “during election campaigns, as well as in the media and on the internet”. The report also stated that “The Committee is particularly concerned with reports of arson attacks against mosques and reception centres for asylum seekers.” = Discrimination = Sweden has recently been criticised in a report by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD) over \\"racist hate speech against Afro-Swedes, Jews, Muslims and Roma\\". In particular the report found that hate crimes remain high with an 11% increase in reported hate crimes from 2014 to 2015.. In 2016 it was reported that approximately 440 hate crimes with an anti-religious motive, specifically anti-Islamic were committed. A study by Martha F. Davis and Natasha Ryan in 2017 found that Swedish authorities had evicted more than 80 Roma settlements during 2013 and 2016. These evictions were on the grounds of poor sanitation and access to water, both considered fundamental human rights. The study concluded that Sweden had violated its human rights obligations under both European and international law. Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights access to water and sanitation are fundamental human rights for all. The 2017/2018 Amnesty Report also noted the discrimination faced by Roma citizens who are denied access to basic services such as health care and education by the State. The Roma citizens continue to be subject to harassment and prejudice from European nationals. = Migrants and asylum-seekers = Sweden's protection of asylum seekers and refugees has historically been viewed as \\"progressive and ambitious\\". They received the largest number of refugees and asylum seekers per capita in 2013 among the countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Like many European countries with the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis Sweden adopted new border controls and cut benefits that refugees had previously had. Sweden introduced an amendment to their asylum seeker policies which prevented entitlement to \\"accommodation, subsistence allowance and special aid\\" for adult asylum seekers with no children and who have had their applications rejected. These emergency measures breached asylum-seekers fundamental rights such as the right to family reunification.

He was also responsible for the attempted murder and the sexual assault of another female sex worker, who escaped after Geralds' attempts at strangulation. All of his murders took place in the city of Chicago, in particular on the southern side in the neighborhood of Englewood, which is particularly known for high crime rates and a known low socioeconomic area. Within Englewood, an area known as “The Stroll” on South Halsted Street was a popular location where Geralds began his murder process. At the time of the murders, Geralds was 30 years old. He was addicted to drugs and also to prostitutes and their services. His modus operandi became seducing drug-addicted prostitutes with drugs, in particular crack cocaine, and then strangling his victims once he had them in privacy. He knew some of his victims from previous prostitution-related encounters. He used a technique known as the \\"Guardian Angel Chokehold\\" to strangle his victims. At trial, the prosecution noted that Geralds was \\"someone who had the capacity to 'squeeze the last bit of life out of [his female victims]'\\". In all five of the murders he was charged with, the cause of death was asphyxia by strangulation. In the case where his victim got away and survived, he was charged with sexual assault of a minor with the intent to kill. The names of his victims, the dates they were found deceased and their ages are as follows: * Doretha Withers, December 22, 1994, Age 37 * Alonda Tart, March 14, 1995, Age 23 * Joyce Wilson, March 26, 1995, Age 28 * Millicent \\"Peanut\\" Jones, June 12, 1995, Age 25 * Mary Blackman, June 17, 1995, Age 42  Arrest  On June 18, 1995, the day after the body of Mary Blackman was found, Geralds was arrested. Mary Blackman’s body was found in a waste disposal trash bin at the house that she shared with the Geralds' family on South May Street, Englewood, Chicago. Blackman was a good friend of Geralds' sister. Hubert Geralds' sister, Angela Geralds, found the decomposing body of Blackman and contacted the police, giving them further information about how Geralds was a violent drug abuser and how she believed that he may have had something to do with the death. The police arrested Geralds, noting that he had contacted the police in March about the death of prostitute, Joyce Wilson. The detectives who investigated the murders were Sergeant Jack Ridges and Chief of Detectives Michael J Malone of the Chicago Police Department.  Trial  Upon his arrest on June 18, 1995, Geralds was charged with the murder of six females and attempted murder of one female, including being accused of killing Rhonda King in December 1994 based on DNA linking them together. He confessed to all of the six killings whilst under investigation and on November 13, 1997, the day of his 33rd birthday, he was convicted by a jury as guilty on all charges laid against him. Geralds’ defense attorney, Allen Sincox, presented an insanity defense, with the aim to have the court sentence his client to life in prison without parole instead of the death penalty. Sincox claimed that his client was mentally retarded, had brain damage and suffered from a mental disorder known was “paraphilia” which caused his sexual addiction and his need to have sexual interaction with those unconscious. During the trial, this lack of mental capacity was highlighted by Geralds’ often being asleep in the court room and experts claimed his Intelligence Quotient was lower than 73, which classified him as mildly mentally retarded. Geralds' family spoke of his physical and mental troubles as a young child. Members of his family spoke of him suffering high levels of mental, physical and sexual abuse. Some argue that this was the cause of his mental health issues. His family also testified saying from a young age his mental health was suffering often harming himself and attempting to harm himself, often not realizing what exactly he was doing, including thinking that he could jump out of windows and fly. The prosecution, Assistant States Attorney Nick Ford and co-prosecutor Jeanne Bischoff discredited the mental health plea calling Hubert Geralds a \\"malingerer\\", claiming that he was putting on an act and portrayed him as a threat to society, a murderer and a drug user and dealer. The strength of the prosecution’s argument and a testimony from Geralds’ only surviving victim Clenshaw Hopes held up the charges already laid against Hubert Geralds, rejecting the insanity plea. After the three-week trial ended on January 9, 1998, Judge Michael P Toomin sentenced Geralds to death. Geralds maintains his innocence, even though he confessed to the murders and was able to give details to the detectives about the killings and his involvement in the deaths. He has said that the deaths were purely disputes over drugs and financial situations resulting in arguments that led to physical confrontations. = Andre Crawford and trial controversy = On January 28, 2000, Andre Crawford was arrested for the murder of 11 females in Englewood, Chicago, the same neighborhood in which Geralds’ murders took place. During his investigation Crawford admitted to the rape and murder of Rhonda King; however, King was already among the murdered female prostitutes that Hubert Geralds had been sent to death row for in January 1998. Upon investigation and further evidence, including a taped confession and DNA that linked Crawford and King together, it was determined that Crawford had murdered King, not Geralds. Crawford confirmed this fact by revealing details of the murder that were not released to the public to the investigating detectives. On February 10, 2000, the prosecutors vacated the conviction against Hubert Geralds. Geralds was tried again, this time for only five murders and one attempted murder. During the second trial the defense argued that Geralds was so mentally ill that he was coerced into admitting guilt for all the murders by Chicago Police and that the confessions were invalid. The Chicago police department denied a forced confession and said that regular procedure was followed in defense to the allegations. Again the mental illness plea failed after the prosecution again claimed the Geralds was not as incapacitated as he seemed and urged the jury \\"not to be fooled\\", also presenting a letter that Geralds wrote to a newspaper from prison. The letter was articulated correctly, the majority of the grammar is correct and the handwriting is legible. Still, he remained on death row for the other five murders. Finally, after controversy and exoneration, Geralds’ criminal incarceration records show 5 counts of class M Murder, Intent to Kill, Injure and 1 count of class X Attempt to Murder, Intent to Kill, Injure.  Vacating of death sentence  In 2000, during his time as governor, Governor George Ryan declared a moratorium on Illinois state’s capital punishment laws. As a result of this, Governor Ryan changed the sentences of 167 prisoners who were either already on death row or waiting to receive the death penalty to life in prison. On January 11, 2003, he was given life in prison without parole, and he remains in Menard Correctional Centre, Illinois.  Clenshaw Hopes  Clenshaw Hopes was the intended sixth victim of Geralds' murder spree and was the victim of Geralds’ attempted murder charge. She testified at Geralds' trial. On the night of April 14, 1995, Hopes and Geralds had been smoking crack cocaine and marijuana together at her apartment in the 5700 block of South Elizabeth Street, Englewood, Chicago. Hopes recounted that she and Geralds had left the apartment for more drugs and to acquire payment methods for the drugs. They had split up and were each alone when she was grabbed by the neck from behind. She told the court “I was being lifted off the ground and started to black out.” She was attacked in an alley near Racine Avenue. When she woke up from the attack, she was being raped by Geralds in a van. She fought him off and dove through a piece of wood covering an opening and crawled her way out. Hopes recounts “running like hell” and made it back to her home, where she immediately contacted police. Hopes identified Geralds as her attacker, but the defense argued against her identification and her validity as a witness, as she had told many different versions of the story of the night she was attacked. Hopes defended herself by arguing she told many different stories because she was protecting her image originally, not wanting her family to know she was a drug user and not wanting to face criminal charges herself.

However, after the North African Campaign, Morocco was under Allied control and thus was active in Allied operations until the end of the war.  Background  In 1940, after France became subject to German occupation, France was divided into two regions. One was occupied by German forces and the other was under French control, with its capital in Vichy. The latter became the Vichy regime, which controlled Southern Morocco. Post the 1942 landings, the Vichy administration remained but Southern Morocco was effectively under Allied control. This Allied control saw many indigenous Moroccan soldiers fight on Allied behalf as part of French forces. In Vichy controlled southern Morocco, the Moroccan Jewish population faced significant restrictions, due to the introduction of Vichy race laws. This Allied control also made southern Morocco the location for the Casablanca Conference, where Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt met to discuss wartime operations. On the southern Morocco home front, daily life changed little, but the nationalist movement attempted to gain momentum, despite facing opposition from French forces. Northern Morocco was controlled by Spain through a \\"puppet\\" government headed by a viceroy and it participated largely in the Spanish Civil War, rather than World War II. Europe during World War II 1943- 1945  Life during World War II  Slavery was widespread in Morocco before and during the establishment of the French protectorate, with many Moroccans owning slaves. Shanty towns arose near Moroccan cities in the 1930s which continued to grow during the war. European refugees fleeing to Morocco experienced poverty on their arrival, with many of them in Casablanca sleeping in converted dance halls with poor conditions. In terms of education, separate educational institutions were set up to teach the Muslim and the French population. Access to the baccalaureate was provided to the Moroccan Muslim population in 1930, but access to elite French schools (lycees) was not provided to the Muslim population until after the end of the war. Around ninety percent of the Muslim population of Morocco was illiterate during World War II. = Jewish discrimination = Before World War II, Jews in Morocco were in poverty. They lived in Jewish quarters named ', and had little social status with Resident General Charles Nogues not allowing Jews who enlisted in 1939 and 1940 to fight, but only to work on the industrial side of the war effort. In 1940, laws were put in place by the Vichy administration which disallowed the majority of Jews from working as doctors, lawyers or teachers. All Jews living in other neighbourhoods of Morocco were required to leave their houses and re-inhabit the . Vichy anti- semitic propaganda was distributed throughout Morocco to encourage the boycotting of Jews. Pamphlets were pinned on the frontages of Jewish shops. Around 7,700 Jews, while attempting to flee Morocco in favour of America or Palestine, were moved to detention centres, with some refugees considered a threat to the Vichy regime being sent to Moroccan labour camps. The American landings in 1942 created hope that the Vichy laws would discontinue, but General Nogues persuaded the Allies to allow for the continuation of French rule and Vichy laws. = Moroccan nationalist movements = Nationalist movements gained momentum in Morocco during World War II. Nationalists in Spanish Morocco created the 'National Reform Party' and the 'Moroccan Unity Movement', which united during the war and were common vehicles for Fascist propaganda. The 1942 landings were encouraged by the nationalists in French Morocco, who hoped the Allies would assist in the fight for Moroccan independence. After Moroccan Nationalists in French Morocco were found to have received letters from Ibrahim al-Wazzani, a nationalist in Spanish Morocco who was involved in aiding the Axis powers, the Allies rejected independence and upheld the Vichy laws. On 11 January 1944, a group of Moroccan Nationalists, in French Morocco, created a declaration of Moroccan Independence which they proceeded to display to the French Resident General. By 18 January 1944, the Moroccan Sultan and other influential figures had demonstrated their approval for the nationalists. French authorities arrested influential nationalists linked to this document and took many to prison camps. However, for many Moroccans, this only worked to increase support for the movement. The British secretly funded many Moroccan nationalist activities in Southern and Northern Morocco, in an attempt to prevent German control of the country. = Moroccan Gourmiers = The Goumiers were the indigenous Moroccan soldiers who fought during World War II initially fighting on behalf of France and the Axis powers. Fifty-three percent of the soldiers provided to France by its colonial empire in September 1939 came from Morocco and areas of North Africa. After the Allied landing in Casablanca in 1942 (Operation Torch), the French administration in Morocco began to support the Allied powers. The Goumiers began to be utilised by the Allies, mostly in mountain areas due to their effective mountaineering abilities. The Goumiers fought against German forces in Tunisia, successfully removing the Germans in the area and taking over ten thousand prisoners of war. The Goumiers also participated in the Sicilian campaign (Operation Husky) and the liberation of Corsica. The German withdrawal from Corsica allowed Allied control of its airfields, for use in subsequent campaigns against France and Italy. The Goumiers also successfully conquered the island of Elba, which was being used as a base for German aircraft and E-boats. They also partook in Operation Diadem'where they aided in successfully infiltrating the Axis Gustav line which stretched across the Italian mountains. Moreover, their fighting across the Aurunci mountains aided in allowing the Allied troops to break the Hitler Line. The taking of Route 6 by the Goumiers allowed the Allies to enter and liberate Rome. In July, the Goumiers went on to liberate Sienna from German control. Ten thousand Goumiers successfully liberated Marseilles from German control, driving the German troops to Vieux-Port, with General Schaeffer ordering his German troops to surrender the city in August 1944. After pushing the German troops back at Monte Cassino in Italy, the Moroccan forces of the French army were granted fifty hours of total freedom from punishment for crime. During this time, many rapes and murders were committed against the Italian people in what was called the '. The monument Mamma Ciociara, in Sacco of the Campania region, was designed to pay tribute to the women who were abused and lost their lives during this event. = Propaganda = The Germans, the British, and the French all employed propaganda in Morocco in World War II. From 1939, using Radio Berlin and Radio Stuttgart, Nazi Germany broadcast propaganda throughout Morocco. This propaganda significantly promoted the German-Muslim relationship, whilst being largely anti-semitic. From 1943, the Moroccan Bureau du Maghreb Arab', created the journal to disseminate Nazi Propaganda. The BBC then began broadcasting news of the war to Morocco in 1939, presenting a pro-Britain outlook. Broadcasts from Radio London attempted to present Britain as benevolent to establish the support of Morocco's population. In 1942, Moroccan dialects were introduced to the British broadcasts, in an attempt to successfully reach more people. Propaganda was also used by the French in Morocco towards the indigenous Moroccan soldiers. Newspapers such as the Annasr attempted to establish a feeling of nationalism in the Goumiers/ Many images were used in this propaganda to allow this propaganda to be accessible to illiterate soldiers.  Military events  = Operation Torch = Around 90,000 Allied forces, sailing from ports in Virginia and in Britain, amphibiously landed at Algeria and Morocco on 8 November 1942. The invasion took place through Casablanca and was meant to force the Vichy territories of North Africa into Allied control while allowing movement through the African coast. The Moroccan Sultan Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef welcomed the Allied forces. Around 60,000 French troops resisted the Allied invasion while many deserted to join the Allied forces. Despite Vichy resistance, the Allied forces had taken control of Fedala, Safi, and Casablanca by 11 November 1942 and a ceasefire was negotiated on the same day. Following this, Vichy French forces fought for the Allied powers, per an agreement enforced on November 13, 1942. This switch in alliance caused Hitler to occupy the entirety of France and to send Axis forces to fight the Allies in the Mediterranean theatre. Medical units were significantly lacking when the Western Task Force of the Allied troops landed in Morocco on 8 November 1942. Only twenty ambulances were fit for use and surgical operations taking place that night had only three torches for lighting. A single fridge (which was purchased off a Moroccan merchant) was obtainable for refrigeration of supplies. As there was a lack of transportation, it took an extended period before the supplies coming off the ships could reach medical units. Therefore Allied forces in their campaigns in Italy supplied the goumiers and French army with medical officers who carried medical bags containing basic medical supplies, so care could still be applied in the event of delay of supplies. The Allies also provided what was known as \\"evacuation hospitals\\", which contained Allied medical staff who landed in Morocco with forces during Operation Torch. These hospitals would follow the French colonial army on campaigns in Morocco and in the Italian region. The hospitals would set up 18 miles behind the front-line and provide medical care for wounded soldiers. = Casablanca Conference = In January 1943, Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt, accompanied by their advisors, met secretly in a hotel in Casablanca to discuss current issues and to decide Allied war strategies. A policy of unconditional surrender was adopted at this conference. According to Roosevelt, this was to ensure Roosevelt also met with Sultan Mohammad V of Morocco at the Casablanca Conference and urged him to work towards independence for Morocco from Spanish and French forces.  Sultan Mohammad V  Sidi Mohammed Ben Youssef of Morocco, or Mohammad V, was the Sultan of Morocco during the World War II period. He was chosen by the French Residency to be the Sultan because it was believed that he would be the easiest of his siblings for French officials to successfully control. As Morocco was under Vichy control, Mohammad V had little power in the prevention of Vichy discrimination laws, but he expressed his moral objection to them in his dealings with French officials. Mohammad V did protect the Jewish population in some ways, preventing the use of the Star of David as an identifier of Jewish subjects from use in Morocco. Mohammad V also insisted Vichy laws apply only to those who identified religiously as Jewish, rather than on birthright as was standard in Nazi policy. Mohammad V also invited Jewish subjects to a banquet he hosted in 1941 without French approval. Following the landings of the Allies in Morocco, President Roosevelt wrote to Mohammad V and expressed that the Allies were to be benevolent subjugators in Morocco. In his letter, he wrote: Mohammad V replied:  Aftermath  The United States and other former Allies continued to be involved in Morocco for several years after World War II, which saw its resources used during the Cold War. In 1951, there were five American air bases in use in Morocco. In 1953, Mohammad V was exiled to Corsica for refusing to approve the enforcement of several French laws He was sent to Corsica and then Madagascar. Two years later, he was allowed to return due to violence that occurred during his absence. On 2 March 1956, a Franco-Moroccan agreement overrode the Treaty of Fez that established the French protectorate. Therefore, Morocco became independent on 7 April 1956 when France relinquished control of the area.

Based out of British Columbia and established in 2012 by Dan Sutton, Tantalus Labs cultivates in their specialized cannabis greenhouse: SunLab. SunLab was the first purpose-built cannabis greenhouse in North America, designed to cultivate quality cannabis in a more environmentally sustainable production methodology than the status quo of indoor production.  History  Tantalus Labs was founded by Dan Sutton and incorporated on October 29, 2012. Having seen a consultation document outlining the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulation (MMPR), he recognized the opportunity to rethink how cannabis was being grown in BC and engaged agricultural experts to design a more efficient methodology. The result was the planning and design of SunLab, the first purpose-built cannabis cultivation facility in North America. In 2012, Tantalus Labs received approval to commence development of SunLab. Construction began on May 29, 2014, in Maple Ridge British Columbia and was completed on September 8, 2016. On May 29, 2017, Health Canada approved the company's submission for a Medical Marijuana License allowing them to acquire materials and commence planting seed crops, making them the 45th Licensed Producer in Canada and the 10th in British Columbia. August 17, 2018, the company announced it had received its sales license from Health Canada, allowing it to begin on-boarding patients and ship cannabis products. Their five initial strains, dubbed the \\"Tantalus Range\\", span three product categories which allude to cannabinoid content, ranging from high THC, Balanced, to high CBD, vs. the traditional classification of Indica and Sativa. Its commitment to technology and sustainability earned Tantalus Labs the moniker “the Tesla of cannabis” by prominent Canadian angel investor Shafin Diamond. September 12, 2018, Tantalus Labs launched Tantalus Prime, its e-commerce membership program that provides door-to-door delivery directly from SunLab to registered customers. The five inaugural strains includes Blue Dream, Serratus, Skunk Haze, Harlequin, and Cannatonic.  SunLab  Tantalus Labs keystone facility, SunLab, is a 75,000 sq. ft. purpose-built greenhouse facility for medical cannabis located in Metro Vancouver, the first of its kind in North America. It was designed to reduce the environmental impact of cannabis cultivation, which largely and historically relies on artificial light to provide the inputs for photosynthesis. SunLab uses natural full- spectrum sunlight as its main light source, reducing electricity requirements by up to 90% compared to traditional indoor growing. The facility's roofing doubles as a rainwater catchment surface, collecting millions of litres of water annually, reducing the need of groundwater for irrigation. The rainwater is stored and passed through three stages of filtration for irrigation use throughout the year. As well, irrigation runoff itself is recaptured and recycled within the facility. Tantalus Labs received the first Water License issued to a cannabis company in British Columbia under the Water Sustainability Act. The company further reduced its well water needs by relying heavily on rainwater recapture. = SunLab Nano = With Canadian cannabis legalization legislation allowing for home-growing of up to four plants, Tantalus Labs released a guidebook that aimed to encourage sustainability through a sungrown approach similar to their commercial-scale facility. The 11-page guidebook was made available free to download on Sept 26, 2017.  Awards  Selected “Most Promising Licensed Producer” at the Canadian Cannabis Awards in 2017.  Controversies  On May 22, 2015, prior to receiving their Medical Marijuana License, 150 residents of Maple Ridge protested the development of SunLab stating concerns around well water depletion and proximity to residential neighbourhoods. In response, Tantalus Labs licensed their well access with the BC Ministry of Forestry and committed to rainwater as its primary water source for irrigation.  Environmental Stewardship  Having researched the environmental impact of cannabis cultivation for three years, Dan Sutton presented findings at TEDx Vancouver on December 7, 2015. Highlighting key issues surrounding the unexpected carbon footprint associated with modern indoor growing techniques that rivals heavy industrial manufacturing. Tantalus Labs also dedicated four acres of their 15 acre property to a land conservancy. Over 2200 individual plants, shrubs, and trees native to the region were planted in a restoration surrounding a salmon- bearing tributary stream which feeds into the Fraser River. This land is dedicated back to the Municipality of Maple Ridge and the Kwantlen First Nation and will remain undeveloped on the property for the foreseeable future.  Political Advocacy  Tantalus Labs and Hanway Associates produced and shared a policy guidance document with 19 BC Ministries and representatives on September 18th, 2017. This document provided context and recommendations around the legal age of consumption, Retail Licensing, Supply Chain Management, Transparency and Reporting, and Ancillary Industries. Receiving no response, Tantalus Labs published this document so that the citizens of British Columbia can hold elected officials to their obligation to foster the cannabis industry and its impactful cultural history. This was the second policy guidance document produced in collaboration with Hanway Associates. On April 10, 2017, the first collaborative whitepaper titled “Into the Light” was published to outline the state of the market, greenhouse advantages, and guidance on policy. This document highlighted greenhouse cannabis cultivation offering an environmentally friendly, economical, and secure means of production. Meant to call out and, to reverse the trend of Canadian cannabis cultivation largely being produced in Ontario in facilities relying on bunker grow op methodologies.

In heterogeneous catalysis, titanyl refers to a terminal oxo ligand on a surface titanium(IV) center. There are a few molecular titanyl complexes where the oxo ligand is terminal, not bridging.

The author is described as a senior official working for the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump. The op-ed criticizes Trump and states that many current members of the administration deliberately undermine his suggestions and orders for the good of the country. It also states that some cabinet members in the early days of the administration discussed using the Twenty- fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a way to remove the president from power. The New York Times editorial board said that it knows the author's identity but granted the person anonymity to protect them from reprisal. The publication of this editorial was unusual because few New York Times pieces have been anonymously written. Trump expressed outrage and called for an investigation; the author's identity drew much speculation in the media, with over 30 senior administration officials denying their involvement. The author remains anonymous. A Warning, a book by the same anonymous author, was published on November 19, 2019. Political environment The essay was published on September 5, 2018. During the week that the article was published, the book Fear: Trump in the White House by political author Bob Woodward was being promoted in the media ahead of its September 11, 2018, release date. Woodward's book depicts the Trump administration as being engulfed in chaos and internal opposition to Trump's impulses. The day before the essay's publication, the US Senate Judiciary Committee began public hearings on controversial US Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh. This timing was also two months prior to the 2018 US elections. The timing has been questioned as a possible calculated diversion, although The New York Times editorial board denied this. The essay praised Senator John McCain, whose death occurred 11 days prior to the essay's publication. Contents The author of the essay writes that they, and many of their colleagues, deliberately fail to follow some directives from the president when they feel the proposal would be bad for the country, \\"working diligently\\" to block his \\"worst inclinations\\". The author writes, \\"The root of the problem is the president's amorality. Anyone who works with him knows he is not moored to any discernible first principles that guide his decision making\\". The author expresses support for a traditional Republican platform, and particularly the Trump tax policy, while disagreeing strongly with the Trump foreign policy, and taking pride in colleagues' efforts to shift that policy in regard to Russia. The paper's editorial page editor summarized the column's perspective as \\"that of a conservative explaining why they felt that even if working for the Trump administration meant compromising some principles, it ultimately served the country if they could achieve some of the president’s policy objectives while helping resist some of his worst impulses\\". The author disavowed any resemblance to the so-called \\"deep state\\": \\"This isn't the work of the so-called deep state. It's the work of the steady state.\\" Identity of the author The New York Times has said that they were working with a single author, not a group of officials and that the text was lightly edited by them, but not for the purpose of obscuring the author's identity. They said that the definition of \\"senior administration official\\" was used in regular practice by journalists to describe \\"positions in the upper echelon of an administration, such as the one held by this writer\\". The newspaper's editorial page editor, op-ed editor, and publisher know the identity of the author. Patrick Healy, the newspaper's politics editor, said that no identifying information has been leaked to The New York Times newsroom. The agreement between the newspaper's editorial department and the author does not prevent the newspaper's news department from investigating the identity of the author. According to James Dao, the paper's editorial page editor, the author had been introduced to them by a trusted intermediary, and the author's identity was verified by background checking and direct communication. Dao said that the use of a vaguely described anonymous identity was believed to be necessary to protect the author from reprisal, \\"and that concern has been borne out by the president's reaction to the essay\\". In response to a reader's question about whether the paper might have to reveal the author's name, Dao replied \\"We intend to do everything in our power to protect the identity of the writer and have great confidence that the government cannot legally force us to reveal it.\\" Several theories about who wrote the op-ed have been offered. Some theories looked at which administration officials have a record of using certain words that appear in the essay. Specifically, the theories focused on the use of the words 'steady state', 'lodestar' and 'first principles'. Some offshore bookmakers took bets on who the anonymous author was; Vice President Mike Pence was the favorite at one site, while then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions led the field at another. More than 30 senior administration officials have denied authoring the editorial: * Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor * Alex Azar, Secretary of Health and Human Services * John R. Bolton, National Security Advisor * Ben Carson, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development * Elaine Chao, Secretary of Transportation * Dan Coats, Director of National Intelligence * Kellyanne Conway, Presidential Counselor * Betsy DeVos, Secretary of Education * Zachary Fuentes, Deputy Chief of Staff * Nikki Haley, Ambassador to the United Nations * Gina Haspel, Director of the CIA * Kevin Hassett, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors * Sarah Huckabee Sanders, White House Press Secretary * Jon Huntsman Jr., Ambassador to Russia * Larry Kudlow, Director of the National Economic Council * Robert Lighthizer, United States Trade Representative * Jim Mattis, Secretary of Defense * Don McGahn, White House Counsel * Linda McMahon, Administrator of the Small Business Administration * Steven Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury * Mick Mulvaney, Director of the Office of Management and Budget * Kirstjen Nielsen, Secretary of Homeland Security * Ajit Pai, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission * Mike Pence, Vice President of the United States * Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture * Rick Perry, Secretary of Energy * Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State * Wilbur Ross, Secretary of Commerce * Jeff Sessions, Attorney General * Raj Shah, White House Principal Deputy Press Secretary * Joseph Simons, Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission * Melania Trump, First Lady of the United States * Andrew R. Wheeler, Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency * Robert Wilkie, Secretary of Veterans Affairs * Christopher A. Wray, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation * Ryan Zinke, Secretary of the Interior U.S. senator Rand Paul suggested that the president force members of his administration to take polygraph examinations. Presidential advisers did consider polygraph exams as well as requiring officials to sign sworn affidavits. Reports surfaced that the administration came up with a list of about a dozen people who are suspected to have authored the editorial. By September 7, Trump said that the Justice Department should open an investigation to determine who wrote the essay. However, the Justice Department would only be able to open an investigation if it is determined that the editorial publicized classified information. Reaction Trump responds to the news of the anonymous essay. Trump reacted in private with what was described as \\"volcanic\\" anger. Via Twitter, he stated that the author was \\"failing\\" and \\"probably here for all the wrong reasons\\". He also questioned via Twitter whether the aide was another \\"phony source\\" invented by the \\"failing New York Times\\". Trump tweeted: \\"If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\\" He later tweeted: \\"TREASON?\\" White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders called the author a \\"coward\\" and said that they should resign. Some Democrats, including Robby Mook and Peter Daou, criticized the author for not doing enough to stop Trump. Representative Jimmy Gomez (D-Calif.) commended the author for speaking out against the president, but criticized the author for maintaining anonymity, saying, \\"This is the problem with a lot of Republicans, including in the House: they privately say he's wrong, but they don't do anything about it\\". Former president Barack Obama warned that the op-ed should be viewed as a sign of \\"dangerous times\\" rather than as a source of comfort, criticizing the actions of the author as undemocratic. Georgetown University political scientist Elizabeth N. Saunders noted that while it is accurate that staff within administrations often push back on the sitting president's views and that staff leak things to the press, the extent to which senior advisers within the Trump administration push back against him is \\"essentially unprecedented\\". Cato Institute scholar Julian Sanchez questioned the author's motives, believing that the editorial would make Trump \\"even more paranoid\\" and cause capable staffers to be succeeded by \\"loyalist nuts and/or Trump family members\\". Followup book On October 22, 2019, The Washington Post revealed that the anonymous author wrote a book, again anonymously, about their experiences inside the White House; it was released on November 19.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time; while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were not due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it did not necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 274 modèle 93/96 Berceau started life as Canon de 274 modèle 1893/1896 naval guns from two coastal defense ships of the Terrible Class called the Caïman and Indomptable. When these ships were disarmed four of their guns were converted to railway guns. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period with several layers of steel reinforcing hoops. The guns used an interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. The carriages consisted of a large rectangular steel base, which was suspended on two four-axle railroad bogies manufactured by Schneider. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. Rather than having a separate ammunition wagon the guns featured a one- piece design where the breach of the gun and its ammunition were combined in an armored cab on the rear bogie. This was intended to give the gun crews protection from shell splinters and gunfire but the cab was cramped and lacked ventilation. This also restricted the angle of elevation to +25° and limited the range of the guns to . To load the gun the barrel lowered and a shell was brought forward by an elevated hoist within the cab. For large angles of traverse, the guns were pushed across a curved section of track for aiming. For small corrections, the guns had car traversing or \\"berceau\\" system which allowed 1° of left/right traverse by slewing the rear of the carriage on its bogies. The guns had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system where the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined rear deck which helped return the gun to battery after firing. Once in firing position, a section of rail bed was reinforced with wooden beams to support the weight of the gun. Two steel beams under the center of the carriage were then lowered and the carriage was jacked up to take weight off the bogies and anchor the gun in place. The carriage also had a windlass towards the front of the carriage that would draw the carriage back into position after firing if the gun had moved. The success of the conversion led to the conversion of other large caliber naval guns such as the earlier Canon de 274 modèle 1887/1893. However, the armored cab, carriage traverse, and cradle recoil were not repeated in future Schneider railway guns. Instead, most used simpler and less costly \\"glissement\\" carriages with better angles of elevation and greater range. World War I The first guns were completed by Schneider and delivered to the French Army during the summer of 1915. They saw heavy use and when their barrels were worn they were bored out to and provided with new ammunition. Ammunition Ammunition was of separate loading type with a bagged charge and projectile.

History  In ancient times, in the Yellow River valley, the male in every tribe wrapped sheepskins around the trunk of a tree and carried it at his waist, to drive beasts away from the tribes. The first percussion instrument originated four thousand years ago in China in the neolithic Shang Dynasty. Percussion instruments were widely used in celebration of the dynasty and the conflicts. Drums symbolized spirit and power and represented the universe. Dating to the Qing and Han Dynasties, the yaogu was used to send signals to frontier guards, to inform their leaders that enemies were approaching. People played the Yaogu to celebrate the harvest. It is believed that the sound of the yaogu brings luck to local areas during prayer. Yangko (Yangge): Traditional Chinese dance performance At the beginning of the 20th century, the yaogu was combined with dance when the peasants were working in the fields. In order to recover from fatigue and boredom, peasants in northwest China developed a dance named \\"Yangko\\" from fieldwork. Yangko (also named Yangge) remains a popular rural folk dance.

Public Interest Law Clearing House and Human Rights Law Resource Centre Ltd.\\"What is substantive equality?\\" (PDF). Equal Opportunity Commission, Government of Western Australia. November 2014. Retrieved 28 October 2018. Scholars define substantive equality as an output or outcome of the policies, procedures, and practices used by nation states and private actors in addressing and preventing systemic discrimination.systematic discriminationMitchell, Ben (2015). Process Equality, Substantive Equality and Recognising Disadvantage Constitutional Equality Law. Irish Jurist. 53: 36-57. Substantive equality recognizes that the law must take elements such as discrimination, marginalization, and unequal distribution into account in order to achieve equal results for basic human rights, opportunities, and access to goods and services. Substantive equality is primarily achieved by implementing special measuresspecial measures in order to assist or advance the lives of disadvantaged individuals. Such measures are aimed at ensuring that they are given the same opportunities as everyone else.  Definition  Substantive equality has been criticized for not having a clear definition. Sandra Fredman has argued that substantive equality should be viewed as a four-dimensional concept of recognition, redistribution, participation, and transformation. The redistributive dimension seeks to redress disadvantage through affirmative action, while the recognition dimension aims to promote the right to equality and identify the stereotypes, prejudice and violence that affect marginalized and disadvantaged individuals. The participative dimension uses Ely's insight to argue that judicial review must compensate marginalized individuals for their lack of political power. The participative dimension may also implement positive duties to ensure that all those affected by discrimination can be active members of society. Lastly, the transformative dimension recognizes that equality is not achieved through equal treatment and that the societal structures which reinforce disadvantage and discrimination must be modified or transformed to accommodate difference. The transformative dimension may use both positive and negative duties to redress disadvantage. Fredman advocates for a four-dimensional approach to substantive equality as a way to address the criticisms and limitations it faces due to the lack of agreement on its definition by scholars.  History  Aristotle was the first to make the connection between equality and justice. Aristotle was the first philosopher to articulate the connection between equality and justice. Aristotle believed equals were to be treated alike and unequals in an unlike manner.Goonesekere, Savitri W.E (2011). The Concept of Substantive Equality and Gender in South East Asia. United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. Aristotle's notion of equality influenced the conception of formal equality in western jurisprudence. Formal equality advocates for the neutral treatment of all people based on the norms of the dominant group in society. During the late 20th century, substantive equality originated in opposition to formal equality. This approach was inspired by early landmark constitutional cases in the United States, which broke away from formal approaches to equality in favor of a more substantive process. For example, in Brown v. Board of Education (1954) the US Supreme Court deemed it unlawful to segregate children's access to education on the basis of race. This case was influential in transforming US anti-discrimination laws as it sought equitable outcomes and equal opportunities for African Americans. The substantive approach rejects earlier notions that claimed social, political, economic, and historical differences were a legitimate justification for the differential treatment of marginalised and disadvantaged groups in society.Law commission of Ontario (2012). Principles for the Law as it Affects Persons with Disabilities. Law commission of Ontario. The substantive approach to equality is entrenched in human rights treaties, laws, and jurisprudence, which is then adopted and implemented by nation states and private actors. This is present in Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which states that: Article 14 prohibits discrimination in all aspects of public life on the basis of nominated attributes. Although Article 14 fails to mention discrimination on the basis of sexuality, age, and disability, recent developments in case law have shown that these grounds are illustrative but not exhaustive and can extend to include these factors. Nation states that have signed and ratified the ECHR have an obligation to enact legislation preventing discrimination by using special measures to protect and advance the lives of disadvantaged and marginalized individuals in society. Article 1(4) of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) defines special measures as, \\"securing adequate advancement of certain racial or ethnic groups or individuals requiring such protection as may be necessary in order to ensure such groups or individuals equal enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms shall not be deemed racial discrimination\\". These two articles are the fundamental principles that define the practice of substantive equality. Failure to enact substantive legislation by signatories may result in heavy sanctions and scrutiny from the international community.  National approaches  = Australia = Anti-discrimination laws in Australia are enacted by commonwealth, state, and territory parliaments and are then interpreted by courts and tribunals. These laws are covered under the following four key commonwealth statutes: the Racial Discrimination Act (1975), Sex Discrimination Act (1984), Disability Discrimination Act (1992), and Age Discrimination Act (2004). All Australian states and territories have enacted a statute (variously called the anti-discrimination or equal opportunities act) which prohibits all forms of discrimination in public life on the basis of nominated attributes identified in Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). This statute makes it unlawful to discriminate against others both directly (when a person is treated unfairly) or indirectly (when something is fair in form but discriminatory in practice). For example, indirect discrimination may occur in the workforce when employees are expected to comply with a condition or requirement of the job (i.e. height restrictions) but are unable to meet them because they are unreasonable or unfair.indirect discrimination Compliance with anti-discrimination laws is enforceable through civil proceedings, which may result in heavy fines or penalties. These laws have been criticized for focusing too much on compensation and not enough on preventing discrimination from occurring. These anti-discrimination laws use substantive measures by promoting equal opportunities and implementing special measures identified in ICERD Article 1(4) to overcome discrimination. Private actors, organizations, and governments use special measures in the form of affirmative action programs to ensure disadvantaged individuals are given the same opportunities as everyone else. The Australian government has identified women, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, people with disabilities, and non-English speaking migrants as high-priority groups for the administration of special measures programs. The Northern Territory government has recognized Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and people with disabilities as high-priority groups for their affirmative action programs by focusing on employment opportunities for these groups. These programs use substantive measures as they acknowledge that there is a need to treat people differently by prioritizing these groups as they have been unfairly discriminated upon. For example, in 2011 the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that Indigenous peoples were 3 times more likely to be unemployed than non-indigenous people.Dillon Sarah, Nissim, Rivkah (2015). \\"Targeted Recruitment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People: a Guideline for Employers\\". Australian Human Rights Commission. This demonstrates the need for affirmative action policies to protect and advance the lives of Aboriginal people, as they do not have the same access or opportunities to employment. = Canada = In Canada, the government of the Northwest Territories announced in October 2018 that it would be implementing two new programs to increase employment and pay rates for Indigenous Canadian staff. The first, Indigenous career gateway program for entry-level staff, aims to increase the number of Indigenous people working for the territorial government. The second, Indigenous management development and training program, aims to help Indigenous government employees gain further training so that they can advance to higher-paid positions.  Notable cases  = Canada =  R v Kapp 2008 SCC 41  The case of R v Kapp was instrumental in shifting the focus from formal equality to substantive equality in Canadian jurisprudence. In 1998, the Canadian government granted a communal fishing license exclusively to members of three Aboriginal bands for a period of 24 hours in the Fraser river that allowed them the right to fish and sell their catch. The appellants consisted mainly of a group of non-Aboriginal commercial fishermen who protested against the license and were subsequently charged with fishing at a prohibited time. The fishermen argued that they were being unfairly discriminated against on the basis of race under section 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, the Crown upheld the decision that the government did not violate section 15 of the charter, and found that decision could not be discriminatory as section 15(1) and 15(2) work together to prevent discrimination and protect vulnerable individuals in society. Section 15(1) aims to prevent discrimination against marginalized and disadvantaged groups, while section 15(2) aims to combat discrimination through affirmative action. The Crown dismissed the appeal as under section 15(2) the Government has the power to implement affirmative action programs in order to advance the aboriginal bands access to jobs and resources. The law can be understood as using substantive measures in R v Kapp as it recognizes that equal treatment does not result in the same opportunities across groups. Instead, the law acknowledged that substantive equality is necessary to ensure the development of disadvantaged and marginalized individual's access to opportunities. = New Zealand =  Z v Z (no 2) (1997) 2NZLR 258 (CA)  The case of Z v Z highlighted the issues with equal sharing of relationship property at the end of a relationship. In this case, the couple had been married for 28 years. During this time the primary caregiver Mrs Z gave up her career to care for the couple's children. At the end of the relationship, the couple had a property valued at . Mr Z was on a salary of over $300,000 per annum, while Mr Z received $7,000 in assistance from the government. In Z v Z, the court failed to protect the primary caregiver by not taking into account her future earning capacity and her past sacrifices. The Property (relationships) Amendment Act (2001) was introduced to rectify the problems of equal sharing highlighted in Z v Z. The property act uses substantive equality to recognize that equal treatment can lead to disadvantage. The act recognizes the impact relationships can have on the earning capacities of individuals and it aims to place them in more substantive position at the end of the relationship. However, the property act has been criticized for its ability to achieve substantive equality, as it does not state how economic disparity should be quantified. Scholars have argued that it does not protect the most vulnerable as it is skewed towards relationships with high incomes because it is more difficult to establish an economic disparity in lower income cases.  Criticism  Substantive equality has been criticized in the past for its vague definition and its tenuous ability to help combat discrimination for marginalized and disadvantaged individuals. Scholars have argued that the meaning of substantive equality remains elusive, which makes it difficult to implement change due to the lack of consensus. The meaning of equality itself has been labeled as subjective as there are too many conflicting opinions within society to find one underlying definition. Substantive equality has also been criticized for its lack of ability to protect individuals from discrimination and for placing too much emphasis on compensation rather than preventing discrimination from occurring. Welfare and affirmative action programs have been recognized as areas of concern, as the way in which they are delivered can be discriminatory in nature because they can reinforce and perpetuate stigmas that are held within society. Substantive equality is a well contested concept in which scholars, nations, and the law must work together in order to agree on a definition and appropriate framework for implementation.

Since 2014 the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission has overseen human rights in the republic. Human rights issues in the country that have raised concern include abortion rights, child abuse, and human trafficking. In Northern Ireland, the Good Friday Agreement (1998) contains guarantees of human rights underwritten by both the British and Irish governments. Statutory protection According to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, human rights in Ireland are contained under and protected by, \\"the Irish Constitution, the European Convention of Human Rights Act 2004-2014 and where EU law is applicable, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights\\". The commission also states that although Irish law is bound to international law in its ratification of human rights, \\"it only gives effect to the provisions of that treaty in domestic law through Acts of the Oireachtas, or where a treaty right is already provided for under the Irish Constitution.\\" The commission also outlines that the responsibility for determining human rights violations lies with Ireland's national courts. = The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission = The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is an independent public body, \\"established under the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Act 2014,\\" to, \\"protect and promote human rights and equality in Ireland and build a culture of respect for human rights, equality and intercultural understanding in the State.\\" The findings of the commission were presented, in the form of a 68-page report, to the UN Human Rights Committee, in Geneva, in July 2017, by chief commissioner Emily Logan. According to Logan, the commission found that, \\"significant gaps in human rights protection remain,\\" including; human trafficking, abortion legislation, disability and discrimination, the protection and reunification of refugee families, and the conditions of detention. The commission stands as a government body that ensures that all public bodies in Ireland respect and protect the human rights of Irish citizens. This responsibility is outlined in section 42 of the Irish Human Rights Act, which states that it was, \\"established a positive duty on public sector bodies to: eliminate discrimination, promote equality of opportunity and treatment, protect human rights.\\"  Rights in Ireland: 1972 to 1998  = The Troubles = The Troubles, a guerilla conflict in Northern Ireland fought predominantly between the sectarian groups, the nationalist Irish Republican Army (IRA), and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). The IRA fought against the discrimination of Northern Ireland's Catholic Minority by Protestants, and for Irish nationalism separate from the United Kingdom.  Bloody Sunday: 30 January 1972  A mural honouring those killed in the Troubles On 30 January 1972, in the Northern Irish city of Derry, 30 000 people gathered to march in a peaceful protest against the policy internment of IRA volunteers. The march turned violent, with British Soldiers and other local security forces opened fire on the crowd, killing 13 civilians. According to Attorney Lynn Wartchow, Northern Irish and British security forces were often preemptively violent in response to Catholic demonstrations, \\"the State did not trust that such opposition could be peaceful given that it came from the same community that bred the increasingly violent IRA.\\" The event became known in Irish history as, \\"Bloody Sunday,\\" and Wartchow points out that although the massacre violated the right to life under Irish law, British troops were cleared of wrongdoing. Bloody Sunday saw the escalation of the sectarian violence within the troubles, and was seen as indicative of the Northern Irish and British governments oppression and suppression of the civil rights of the Catholic minority. According to Wartchow \\"after Bloody Sunday, the Catholic population felt cornered into accepting an oppressive and discriminatory ruling government with little, if any, legitimate recourse before the law.\\" The troubles primarily brought to attention the division that existed between Protestants and Catholics regarding their human rights; namely the right to be outspoken and protest about the plight of Northern Irish Catholics without the threat of violent suppression.  The Good Friday Agreement  \\"Vote Yes, It's the way Ahead\\" A sign for the, \\"Yes\\", campaign in the ratification of the Belfast Agreement Referendum The Good Friday Agreement, or the Belfast Agreement, was an accord that brought an end to the 30 year sectarian conflict. The agreement was signed on 10 April 1998, by the British Government, the Irish Government, and the political parties of Northern Ireland, and was ratified after a referendum in May 1998. The Agreement established a commitment from all signatories to equality and the protection of the human rights of all Northern Irish citizens.  Child abuse in Ireland  = Sexual abuse within the Catholic Church = Since the late 1980s, allegations of sexual abuse against children within the Catholic Church in Ireland have been consistently emerging. In 2011, the allegations resulted in the church delivering six reports, implicating 85 Irish priests in sexual abuse from 1975 to 2011. The reports were conducted by the Catholic Church's National Board for Safeguarding Children. Despite the 85 allegations, the report found that only six Irish priests had been convicted of sexual abuse in the thirty-six year period. = The 'Grace' case = The 'Grace' case came to light in Ireland in 2017, as a major indicator of Ireland's ongoing issues with child sexual abuse. 'Grace,' was born with intellectual disabilities and from 1989 to 2009 she was placed in the Irish foster care system. Grace remained with the same foster family for those twenty years and was subjected to physical abuse, gross neglect and, possibly, sexual abuse. The revelations of Grace's abuse resulted in the publication of two reports, and the establishment of a Commission of investigation. According to an article published by Irish new service, RTÉ, Grace's story of abuse and neglect brings attention to the lack of framework implemented by the Irish government to prevent children from institutionalised abuse. = The Louise O'Keeffe case = The, \\"Louise O'Keeffe case,\\" investigated allegations of abuse by a woman named Louise, who was abused as an eight year old in 1973, and along with 21 others, mounted allegations of abuse against Leo Hickey, the former principal of the Dunderrow National School, a primary school in Ireland. It was alleged that Leo Hickey abused these women on 400 occasions whilst he was principal of the school in the 1970s. The case was ruled on by the European Court of Human Rights and found that Irish state was liable, and that the case was indicative of the government's failure to take preventative action against sexual abuse in its schools. However, the state denied responsibility for the abuse. Leo Hickey was ordered to serve a three-year jail sentence as, despite the 400 allegations he only plead guilty to 21 charges.  Human trafficking in Ireland  In 2015, the US State department that Ireland was a destination country for human trafficking, including sex trafficking and forced labour. Whilst the Department's report still categorised Ireland as a Tier 1 nation, meaning that the country's efforts to eliminate the issue were found to comply the minimum standards of the US, it was further noted that whilst Irish law enforcement efficiently investigated human trafficking offences, often the traffickers were not convicted. In 2018, Ireland was downgraded, in the United States’ Trafficking of Persons Report 2018, from Tier 1, to Tier 2; Tier 2 including countries that fall below US standards in combatting human trafficking. The report found that, regarding the efforts of the Irish government, \\"The government has not obtained a trafficking conviction since the law was amended, in 2013; it initiated only three prosecutions in 2017, and had chronic deficiencies in victim-identification and referral.\\" The number of newly identified cases in 2017 numbered 115, an increase on the 90 cases identified in 2015. According to the report, this increase can be accounted for by the Irish governments, \\"decreased,\\" law enforcement efforts. Whilst the report did note that Ireland's, Garda Síochána, (police force), runs a dedicated email service involved with reporting trafficking, action was taken on a mere 31 emails, a number disproportionate when compared with the number of cases published by the report. The report further found that the Irish government provided, \\"no legally mandated psychological assistance to victims,\\" and had dedicated little effort to, \\"reduce the demand for sex trafficking or forced labour.\\" The nationality of Trafficking victims in Ireland identified in 2017, according to the report, included, \\"28 Irish, 14 individuals from Romania, 12 from Indonesia, 12 from Nigeria, and the rest from Europe, Africa, South Asia, the Near East, and South America.\\" Furthermore, it was reported that, \\"Victims of forced labour have been identified in domestic work, the restaurant industry, waste-management, fishing, seasonal agriculture and car-washing services.\\" The report indicates that forced labour, especially, was an increasing issue in the country.  Abortion rights in Ireland  = The Eighth Amendment = Protestors at a rally in Dublin in response the death of Savita Halappanavar. 2012 The Eighth Amendment, which was added to the Irish constitution in 1983, prohibited women from undergoing an abortion unless their lives were at risk. This aim of the amendment was to, recognise the rights of an unborn child where equal to those of the pregnant women, and, this entailed that, even in cases of incest, rape and fatal foetal abnormality, Irish women's options were to carry a pregnancy to full term, or travel elsewhere to receive an abortion.  The Death Of Savita Halappanavar  Debate regarding the Eighth Amendment had been ongoing since 1983, and was heightened by the case of Savita Halappanavar. Savita died as a result of a septic miscarriage when she was 17 weeks pregnant at Galway University Hospital. Despite requesting an abortion when it was discovered that miscarriage was inevitable but was denied and, according to the official report of the investigation in her death, an, \\"assessment of the legal context in which their clinical professional judgement was to be exercised.\\" As a result of the blood infection, Savita died, on 28 October 2012, a week after she checked into the hospital to receive treatment. Her death became an example of how the Eighth Amendment was in breach of a woman's right to life, especially given the fact that a miscarriage was inevitable.  Ireland's Abortion Referendum  On Friday 25 May, Irish citizens voted on a referendum to determine whether the Eighth Amendment would be repealed. The Referendum on the Thirty Sixth Amendment, asked Irish citizens to change the law's focus on,\\"the right to life of the unborn and, with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother,\\" to become, \\"Provision may be made by law for the regulation of termination of pregnancy.\\" 3,367,556 Irish citizens participated in the referendum. The votes returned a verdict to repeal the Eighth Amendment, 66.4% to 33.6%. The results of the referendum entailed that the Irish Parliament would begin to legislate and reform abortion laws in the country. The referendum addressed one of the key areas of human rights concern found by The Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  Climate change in Ireland  According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur, Professor David Boyd, Ireland has failed to take more effective measures to control climate change. Boyd referred to these failures as a “breach of Ireland’s human rights obligations,” and stated that the country “must take additional actions on an urgent basis,” as climate change impinges upon the right to life of Irish citizens, “a right which the Government of Ireland is legally obligated to respect, protect and fulfil.” Boyd recommended that the Irish government implement more effective measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, for otherwise ”these violations will expand in terms of geographic scope, severity and the number of people affected\\".

It received positive reviews. Background Lily Allen is an English singer-songwriter. Born on 2 May 1985, to actor Keith Allen and film producer Alison Owen. Under EMI, Allen has released four albums: Alright, Still (2006), It's Not Me, It's You (2009), Sheezus (2014) and No Shame (2018). Allen says that she wrote the book so her daughters will be able to understand her perspective on the events in her life, and to \\"set the record straight\\" following inaccuracies and misleading narratives by the British press. Allen wrote more chapters for the book that were not included, saying she could have \\"gone on and on and on\\". Her father did not read the memoir prior to its publication. The book was announced in August 2018 and published by Blink Publishing on 20 September 2018, coincidentally the same day on which the 2018 Mercury Prize ceremony took place, in which No Shame was nominated. The book is a memoir presented in the form of thematic essays. =Press coverage= Several topics included in My Thoughts Exactly were revealed by news media prior to the book's release. These include Allen being sexually assaulted by a music industry executive,  an intervention for Allen staged by Chris Martin, and an apology in the book to Cheryl, with whom Allen had a longstanding disagreement. Metro reports that Allen was unsurprised by the media response and \\"used to it\\". On 2 September 2018, Allen posted on Instagram that she had had sex with female escorts in 2014 while on tour promoting Sheezus. Allen said that she made the Instagram post as the Daily Mail were planning to publish an article about it the following day. Allen criticised the press for portraying the events as a \\"lesbian prostitute sex romp\\". On the day following the book's release, Alice Vincent of The Telegraph wrote an article entitled \\"Could Lily Allen's heartbreaking book spark music's MeToo moment?\\" Listing three incidents from the book in which Allen was taken advantage of by men in the music industry, Vincent writes that the book \\"could be a clarion call\\". Vincent notes that Allen wanted to name the record producer who sexually assaulted her, but the publisher's lawyers refused. Synopsis Allen describes feeling neglected by her parents: her mother was addicted to drugs and her father was a narcissist who had affairs. Allen details the numerous schools she went to and describes a car accident involving her mother and brother which happened on the day she performed at a school concert. Aged 17 she met Lester, with whom she had an 18-month relationship. Allen overdosed on paracetamol following their breakup. She describes herself as codependent. During the same period, her father organised a deal with London Records and wrote songs for her with Pablo Cook. The label lost interest in her and after she sued to get out of the contract, they countersued unsuccessfully for £3.6 million. George Lamb started managing Allen, and she wrote music with Future Cut. Lamb stopped managing Allen, but she got a deal with Parlophone of £25,000 for five albums. With a growing Myspace fanbase, Allen was profiled in Observer Music Monthly and started working with Greg Kurstin. Writing about the pernicious nature of journalists and tabloids, Allen alleges that during her period of fame, her words were twisted and stories about her were constructed to fit misleading narratives. She describes a News of the World story leaked by Lester. In 2007, The Sun rang Allen's agent for confirmation that she was pregnant, but Allen did not realise she was pregnant until a week later. Announcing this publicly, she faked a miscarriage three weeks later. Allen writes about many visits to the Glastonbury Festival. In 1998 at the festival, her father had a heart attack and took cocaine immediately after being discharged. Allen writes about hosting the GQ Awards with Elton John, and a wrongful headline about the two falling out which followed. She says her three Ivor Novello Awards are the only awards she values, as other music awards are influenced by politics between record labels. Allen describes her first two sexual encounters at the age of fourteen, with men who were several years older. She describes a sexual encounter with Liam Gallagher, realising the next day that he was married to Nicole Appleton. Allen details her youthful lack of financial awareness which led her to accumulate a plethora of parking tickets. Allen began dating Sam Cooper in 2009, having known him for several years. They bought a countryside house once Allen was pregnant with a child they named George. However, she suffered a miscarriage seven months into her pregnancy, and then had sepsis. Soon after, Cooper proposed and they married in June 2011. Their daughter Ethel was born in November 2011 but her laryngomalacia meant she had to feed from a tube for the first eight months. Their second daughter Marnie was born in January 2013. Allen struggled writing Sheezus as the label did not want her to discuss her motherhood and continued to sexualise her. Allen developed bulimia and used cocaine and other appetite suppressants to decrease her eating. Allen became overweight when pregnant with Marnie, but after giving birth she quickly lost the weight with alcohol and drugs. Meanwhile, a backlash to perceived racism in the music video to \\"Hard Out Here\\" led Allen to learn more about intersectional feminism. As Allen began touring for Sheezus, she felt isolation due to a recent falling out with her mother, her ex-booking agent suing her, her manager resigning, and the touring band members—The Streets—ignoring her comments about the production and eventually resigning. On the tour, Allen bought vibrators and discovered how to make herself orgasm. She also had affairs with men and hired female prostitutes, which continued as Allen supported Miley Cyrus on her Bangerz tour. Allen's use of pharmaceutical drugs and alcohol became very dangerous. After accidentally headbutting Orlando Bloom at a party, Chris Martin spoke to Allen and she decided to return to London, where she accidentally overdosed. Following an unhelpful conversation with her father, Allen spoke to Cooper in mid-2015 and the pair separated. In 2016, Allen was sexually assaulted by a record industry executive. She had been drinking following six months of sobriety, and awoke at 5 a.m. to find the executive slapping her buttocks and trying to put his penis into her vagina. She discusses the prevalence of abuse in the music industry, which went unaddressed during the #MeToo movement. Allen talks about her stalker, Alex Gray, who broke into her house in 2015. She slowly connected Gray to the man who had sent her threatening messages online since 2008, once appeared at a concert of hers holding a banner claiming to have written \\"The Fear\\", stole her mail in 2009 and sent her a series of letters. Allen hired a lawyer and paid £40,000 in legal fees to get the case treated seriously; the police had destroyed Gray's letters, claimed the incident was a burglary and refused to keep Allen updated on the case's progress. Gray was eventually convicted and sent to a mental institution. Allen talks about how her wealth and privilege allowed her to pursue the case, and voices concerns about how less powerful victims of stalking fare in the legal process. In late 2016, Allen had a psychotic episode and had to take prescription drugs for two months. In the final few chapters, Allen writes about her recovery. She talks about sobriety, her outspokenness on social media, the composition of No Shame and ends on the line \\"I've got my voice back.\\" Reception Anita Singh of The Daily Telegraph gives the book four out of five stars. In a positive review, Jude Rogers of New Statesman lauds the book as \\"uniquely candid\\" and praises the depth to which it explores \\"the darkness of being a very famous woman\\". Rogers notes that the \\"sharpness of the prose\\" caused her to cry while reading one chapter. Katie Glass writes in The Times that one \\"can't read this book and not feel sorry for Allen\\". Glass praises Allen as \\"admirably open\\" about the provenance of the story and describes Allen's description of the downside of fame as \\"honest\\". She also says that Allen \\"rarely recognises her privileges\\", \\"skims over the fun\\" and \\"seems to suffer severe imposter syndrome\\". Miles Salter of The Press praised Allen for showing \\"tremendous authenticity about her own failings\\". Salter lauded the book for its \\"coruscating honesty\\" but criticised that cultural and political events go relatively unmentioned. Fiona Sturges of The Guardian reviews that the book makes for \\"compelling but discomfiting reading\\" as \\"no detail is deemed too personal\\". Sturges describes the memoir as \\"visceral and affecting\\" and praises the \\"lucid and heartfelt account\\" of Allen's treatment by the press while criticising that her \\"characteristic self-awareness deserts her\\" when discussing her privilege. Hannah Jane Parkinson of The Observer describes the book as \\"uneven\\". Parkinson praises Allen's commentary relating to the music industry and writes that her thoughts are \\"very honest\\" and \\"funny\\", calling Allen \\"smart and tenacious\\". However, Parkinson criticises the chapters relating to Allen's father and her inconsistency in acknowledging her privilege. Nicole Flattery of The Irish Times writes that the book is \\"commendable for its frankness\\" and praises Allen's resilience, particularly following her stillbirth, and her description of being \\"treated as a sex object\\". Flattery opines that the novel's best parts \\"felt like spending time with a ridiculous, outrageous friend\\" while the worst \\"was like being left stranded with a girl you just met at the campsite on the last day of a festival\\". In 2018, My Thoughts Exactly was nominated for the FutureBook Campaign of the Year. The book is one of seven chosen by the Evening Standard as the \\"best celebrity memoirs of 2018\\".

Melitaea or Meliteia ( or Μελίτεια or Μελιτία) was a town and polis (city-state) of Phthiotis in ancient Thessaly, situated near the river Enipeus, at the distance of 10 stadia from the town of Hellas, whence the residents of Melitaea had come. The inhabitants of Melitaea affirmed that their town was anciently called Pyrrha, and they showed in the agora the tomb of Hellen, the son of Deucalion and Pyrrha. According to Greek mythology its eponymous founder had been Melitaea and there was a legend according to which Aspalis, a beautiful maiden of the place, had been hanged to avoid being possessed by a tyrant of the city which they called Tartarus. Astygites, the brother of Aspalis, killed the tyrant after disguising himself as his sister. It was believed that the body of Aspalis was not found because it was taken by the gods and in its place a statue appeared next to another statue of Artemis that was already in the city. In this new statue, called Aspalis Amilete Hekaërge, the maidens of the city hung a virgin goat every year, just as Aspalis had been hanged as a virgin.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 13. Thucydides relates that during the Peloponnesian War, when Brasidas was marching through Thessaly to Macedonia, his Thessalian friends met him at Melitaea in order to escort him (424 BCE), learning from this narrative that the town was one day's march from Pharsalus, whither Brasidas proceeded on leaving the former place. In the Lamiac War the allies left their baggage at Melitaea, when they proceeded to attack Leonnatus. Subsequently Melitaea was in the hands of the Aetolians. Philip V of Macedon attempted to take it (217 BCE), but he did not succeed, in consequence of his scaling-ladders being too short. Melitaea is also mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax,Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, p. 24 and by Stephanus of Byzantium, Pliny the Elder,, and Ptolemy who erroneously calls it Μελίταρα (Melitara).

It was located on the Lehigh Valley's Elmira and Cortland Branch. The station building still stands; the tracks are owned by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway. Cortland was one of two depots; the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (Lackawanna) depot was located on Railroad Street in the center of the city.  History  The first railroad to reach Cortland was the Syracuse and Binghamton Railroad, a forerunner of the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, which opened a line between Syracuse, New York, and Binghamton, New York, on October 18, 1854. It was joined in 1872 by the New York and Oswego Midland Railroad, which extended west from its existing line at Norwich, New York, to Freeville, New York. This line was later leased by the Elmira, Cortland and Northern Railroad, which in turn became part of the Lehigh Valley Railroad in 1896. The present building was constructed in 1910–1911, with a formal opening on April 4, 1911. The brick building measured and stood two stories tall. The space was sufficient to contain a waiting room, baggage room, a \\"women's retiring room\\", a smoking room, and a ticket office. The second floor was given over to company offices. It replaced the original station, which had served both freight and passengers. A new freight house was also built. Traffic declined on the Elmira and Cortland Branch after World War I, and the Lehigh Valley gradually reduced service throughout the 1930s and 1940s. The last scheduled passenger service, between Cortland and DeRuyter, New York, ended on April 25, 1948. Limited service remained in the form of mixed trains. Even these ended south of Cortland on April 30, 1950, leaving a roundtrip between Cortland and Canastota, New York. This was effectively withdrawn after 1954. Lackawanna passenger service ended in 1958. The Lehigh Valley abandoned the branch north of Cortland in 1967. Most of the branch south of Cortland was out of service by the mid-1970s. Conrail, successor to the Lehigh Valley, abandoned all but within the vicinity of Cortland. This line is owned by the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway.

The channel was first known as VH1 Uno from 2000 to 2004 before changing names when Viacom expanded MTVU programming beyond more than 750 college and university campuses across the United States, as part of internally originated cable systems that are a part of on-campus housing or college closed-circuit television systems to digital cable in all homes. In 2018, the MTV Networks on Campus group was sold by Viacom to Cheddar to launch CheddarU, but the digital cable channel remained to the public through digital cable. Music videos played on the channel primarily consist of indie rock, pop punk and hip-hop along with limited original programming. MTVU also formerly owned RateMyProfessors.com. History MTV Networks' proposal for a channel targeting college students, tentatively called MTV University, became public in February 2002. According to The New York Times, the channel was seeking to compete with Burly Bear Network, which was available to 450 campuses and had been attracting nearly a million viewers a week, along with College Television Network (CTN) and the most recent entrant at the time, Zilo. Seven months later, after CTN wound up in financial trouble and as National Lampoon had just acquired the defunct Burly Bear, MTV Networks acquired CTN for $15 million. In February 2008, MTV Networks discontinued VH1 Uno, a sparsely viewed Spanish language music video channel, and replaced it with MTVU, to expand the channel into traditional cable distribution. In May 2018, Cheddar TV acquired Viacom's MTV Networks on Campus; outlets associated with that service will be converted to carry CheddarU, a new secondary feed which will stream content from the flagship financial-news streaming service and segments from Cheddar Big News to 9 million students on more than 600 campuses; universities which previously screened MTV Networks on Campus will continue to receive CheddarU at no cost in exchange for access to the campus (the cable version of MTVU has continued under an automated form). CheddarU is part of the ChedNet division of Cheddar, a division focusing on bringing the service to public screens such as gyms, bars, airports, hotel and other public venues. Programming According to its promotional materials from 2004 to 2018, MTVU broadcast exclusive content dedicated to aspects of college life, including music, news, and on-campus events. The channel was the first MTV network to stream all of its content online. On-campus events included the Campus Invasion tour, featuring up-and- coming bands; the GAME0Rz Ball tour, which brings new video games to campus; and Tailgate Tour, which provides MTVU with a presence at campus tailgates. MTVU shows included Dean's List, the MTVU Awards, and MTVU Spring Break. Currently, MTVU plays a mix of music videos with an emphasis on emerging artists and short interestistial segments focusing on college life. Previously at each hour, MTVU broadcast news updates from ABC News (and before that CBS News until late 2006 in the wake of the Viacom/CBS split), including international news and college-related news. Twice an hour, MTV News once aired stories on subjects such as music downloading, and musical artists under promotion by MTVU. Additionally, MTVU aired several original programs produced by and featuring college students. The Freshmen featured three rotating student panelists discussing new music videos and was hosted by Kim Stolz; Stand-In brought celebrities and intellectuals into college classrooms to teach for a day, and featured people such as Nobel Laureates Elie Wiesel and Shimon Peres; Madonna; John McCain; Marilyn Manson; and Jhumpa Lahiri.

Founded in 1795, it is one of the oldest departments of chemistry in the country and is consistently funded by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. In 2010, the department moved to its new location, the Frick Chemistry Laboratory. The department oversees the undergraduate, graduate, and post-doctoral programs in chemistry, as well as a number of research centers and initiatives at the university. History John Maclean, Sr. was Princeton's first professor of chemistry. Educated at the University of Glasgow beginning at the age of thirteen, Maclean was a licensed physician and surgeon by the age of 20. He arrived to the United States in the spring of 1795 and began working at Princeton. President Samuel Stanhope Smith invited Maclean to Princeton to deliver chemistry lectures and was subsequently appointed Professor of Chemistry and Natural Science. He helped to establish the first undergraduate chemistry laboratory in the United States. In 1797, Maclean published Two Lectures on Combustion which altered the field going into the eighteenth century. Notably, his son, John Maclean, Jr., became the tenth president of Princeton University. American botanist and chemist John Torrey was one of Maclean's successors, lecturing students in chemistry and natural history from 1830 to 1854. =Frick Chemistry Laboratory= In 1916, Pittsburgh steelmaker Henry Clay Frick expressed interests in working with Dean Andrew Fleming West of the Graduate School and President John Grier Hibben to create a chemical laboratory. Architectural blueprints were subsequently made with an estimated cost of $1 million. The Laboratory was officially built in 1929. Designed by architect Charles Z. Klauder, the original design consisted of laboratories, lecture rooms, and faculty offices. An extension to the building was completed in 1964, doubling the research space. Additional funding for expansion was supplemented by grants from the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health. A new building for the Department of Chemistry opened in 2010. The 265,000-square-foot laboratory has a skylit atrium, pedestrian bridges, naturally lit interior spaces, and an in-building café. A 250-seat auditorium was named was former Professor of Chemistry Edward C. Taylor. The area is also one of the most environmentally sustainable places on campus, featuring rainwater harvesting, photovoltaic solar panels, HVAC systems and controls, and cascading airflow from office areas to laboratories. The Frick Chemistry Laboratory oversees six main areas of research are: * Catalysis / Synthesis * Chemical Biology * Inorganic Chemistry * Materials * Spectroscopy / Physical Chemistry * Theoretical Chemistry Research The department collaborates with a number of centers and institutes on campus where students, researchers, and faculty can work on interdisciplinary projects.

He became a Hero of the Soviet Union during the fighting along the Dniepr River in 1943. He continued to serve well into the postwar era, and was promoted to colonel in 1961, when he went into the reserve. Biography Skiruta was born on December 4, 1912, in the village of Velikopolovetskoe in the Kiev Oblast. He was Ukrainian by nationality. After he completed primary school he went to work as a timekeeper in one of the State farms of Chernigov Oblast. He joined the Red Army in 1932, and in 1936 he completed the courses for junior commanders. In 1940 he joined the Communist Party. As the 422nd Rifle Division formed up in the Russian Far East in the spring of 1942, Skiruta was assigned to it, serving first as deputy commander and eventually as commander of its 1334th Rifle Regiment, with the rank of lieutenant colonel. The division arrived at the front near Stalingrad on July 26, where Skiruta first saw combat. By September the bulk of the 422nd was in the 64th Army, on the Volga south of the German encirclement, but the 1334th was detached to a special task force in 57th Army further south. On the night of September 28–29 this force of two rifle regiments with tank and artillery support attacked positions held by the 1st Romanian Infantry Division south of Lake Sarpa, driving them back as much as 5 km and liberating the villages of Tsatsa and Simkin by October 1. This was an ominous foretaste of the weakness of the Romanian forces north and south of Stalingrad.David M. Glantz, Armageddon in Stalingrad, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2009, pp. 342-46. When Operation Uranus began in the southern sector on November 20, Skiruta's regiment was back in the 422nd in 64th Army, once again attacking forces of the newly-formed 4th Romanian Army and driving them back until encountering the German 29th Motorized Division, which brought the advance to a halt. The division served in Operation Ring in January, 1943, and on March 1 was re- designated as the 81st Guards Rifle Division. The 1334th was concurrently re- designated as the 235th Guards Rifle Regiment.Valeriy Zamulin, The Forgotten Battle of the Kursk Salient, Helion & Co. Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2017, p. 158 Skiruta led his regiment during the Battle of Kursk. The 81st Guards built especially strong defenses on the east bank of the Donets River, based on the Stari Gorod (Old Town) of Belgorod; in the defensive plan of Voronezh Front this was intended as a bastion to hold the junction of 6th and 7th Guards Armies and to prevent 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf from linking up. By July 9 the bastion was deeply outflanked and nearly encircled, and the division commander, Maj, Gen. I. K. Morozov, ordered a retreat. In recognition of his meritorious behavior, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy between July 5–16, and leading his troops through a cordon of panzers on the night of July 9–10, Morozov commended Skiruta to be awarded the Order of the Red Banner on July 20, which was approved by the military council of 7th Guards Army on August 21.Zamulin, Forgotten Battle, p. 466 A few days later, Morozov cited the commander of Skiruta's 2nd battalion, Captain Goshtenar, for retreating without orders, but this judgement was later quashed.Zamulin, Demolishing the Myth, Helion & Co. Ltd., Solihull, UK, 2011, pp. 425, 594 Following Kursk, Skiruta continued to lead his regiment, participating in the liberations of Kharkov, Merefa and Krasnograd, for the last of which the 81st Guards received a divisional honorific. By late September 7 Guards Army was approaching the Dniepr River, behind which Army Group South was scrambling to build a new defensive line. The 81st Guards were nearing the village of Orlik, south of Poltava, on September 23, where more than 5,000 enemy officers and men and over 1,000 trucks and wagons had converged on the crossing point.http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=3918 states that there were 500 officers and men. This appears to be a typo, since it's unlikely that the vehicles outnumbered the personnel by 50% They were supported by long- range artillery fire and aircraft from the west bank. Fierce fighting continued over the next two days; the 233rd Guards Regiment, in the division's first echelon, did not have the strength to force the Germans into the river. To overcome the position, overnight on September 25–26 the 233rd and 235th Guards Regiments forced a crossing of the main channel of the Dniepr, occupying West Island. The following night the second channel was also crossed and a bridgehead was established on the west bank after heavy fighting for the large village of Borodaevka, which was about 6 km in length. On October 26, Guards Lieutenant Colonel G. T. Skiruta was recognized by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for his command of his regiment, personal courage and bravery in the crossing battle with the award of the Order of Lenin and the Gold Star of a Hero of the Soviet Union (No. 1430). Skiruta continued in command of his regiment through the battles for west bank Ukraine, participating in the liberation of Kirovograd during the Battle of the Korsun Pocket and the crossings of the Southern Bug, Dniestr and Prut Rivers during 1944. After the occupation of Romania in October, Skiruta was sent to study at the Frunze Academy. After his graduation in 1947 he went back to command of a regiment, then taught tactics to senior officers at the Vystrel courses. He was promoted to the rank of colonel in 1961 just prior to being moved to the reserve. In his retirement Skiruta moved to the town of Solnechnogorsk northwest of Moscow, here he spent some of his time directing military- patriotic work among the young people of the area. In 1995 he was named an honorary citizen of Solnechnogorsk. He died on July 28, 1999 and was buried in the town's New Cemetery. References External links *Col. G. T.

The first church on the site was a 13th century Romanesque single-nave basilica, which a Gothic church replaced from 1345, with a three- nave church built between 1399-1400. In the 15th century the church was destroyed by fire and rebuilt once more, with an added vestibule and church spire. Between 1893 and 1900 the church underwent significant reconstruction and expansion, including the elongation of the tower by 64 meters. The Gothic appearance of the church was regained according to a design by the architect F. Schmoraz. While the church was being repaired in 2007, some archaeological discoveries were made. The church played an important role in the Czech National Revival, as the Dvůr Králové manuscript, which together with the Zelená Hora manuscript were purported to be the earliest examples of written Czech texts (now both known to be fakes), was \\"found\\" there.  Exterior  The church has an uneven ground plan, is oriented and has a supporting system. On the east side there is a presbytery, a sacristy on its north side, and a vestibule and a tower on the south side. The facade has no decoration, other than stucco. There are four entryways into the church and one into the tower. An early Gothic ogive portal from the north, a door to sacristy from the east and two Gothic ogive portals from the south. The church has a saddleback roof, the sacristy has an aisle roof. The altar is lit by the window on the east side of the presbytery. Another two windows in the presbytery portray God and The Baptism of Jesus. In the south east corner, there are fragments of the 13th-century apsis.  Interior  The entry is from the south side through the wooden door from late 19th century. In the vestibule, there is a cross- shaped vault as well as in the church. The church is divided into three naves by two pairs of columns with polygonal pedestals. The sacristy has an annular vault. Above the entry to the sacristy, there are three paintings by Rudolf Adamek from 1933.  Tower  The tower was built in 1431 and burned down in 1450. It was rebuilt in 1485. On the top of the tower, there was a flat, for a tower keeper. In 1894 it was raised to 64 metres. Under the flat there is a clock mechanism. In the tower there are three bells: Saint John, Passing bell and Meridian bell. Under the tower, there is a Virgin Mary chapel.  Gallery  In the gallery, there is an organ from 1780. In 1776 the gallery was raised and an entryway to a tower dungeon is now under its floor. In the dungeon, there was a town vault. In 1817 Vaclav Hanka found a manuscript there that was supposedly the oldest written Czech text, with 14 songs from the 13th century. Although the manuscript was later proven a fake, it did have an influence on events during the Czech National Revival. It was later named the Manuscript of Dvur Kralove.  Fotogallery  Kostel sv.

She attended the University of Toronto in 1921 but left before finishing her degree to help put her brothers through university. In 1927 she married Gordon George Duncan, a mining engineer. She and her husband settled in Flin Flon, Manitoba. McPhedran was one of the first women to live there, and it was through her experiences there she drew on to begin writing. Her husband died in 1932 due to kidney failure. She was left alone to raise her daughter, Kittie-Marie. She married again in 1936 to Harris McPhedran, a medical doctor. She relocated to Toronto where McPhedran was practicing medicine. By the time of her second marriage she had already started to write and had published a short story about her experiences in the north. Over the next decade she wrote a large number of short stories for children but had difficulty finding publishers. Her breakthrough came with her first novel, Golden North, the runner-up for the 1948 Governor-General's Award for juvenile fiction.

It focuses on the rescue of elderly, \\"senior\\" dogs from shelters where they are otherwise likely to be euthanized. History OFSDS was founded by Zina and Michael Goodin in Mount Juliet, Tennessee. Both were mechanical engineers prior to operating the sanctuary. In 2011, they began rescuing golden retrievers through the Middle Tennessee Golden Retriever Rescue. The Rescue asked the Goodins to adopt an elderly, 15-year-old dog who had been returned to a shelter from a foster family. The dog, \\"Bandit\\", lived with the Goodins for less than a month before his death. Fostering \\"Bandit\\" was the Goodins' impetus for adopting elderly dogs. They expanded to other breeds, taking in shelter dogs that would otherwise be euthanized. Of the couple's decision to rescue senior dogs, Zina Goodin stated, \\"Senior dogs were the last to be adopted (if ever) and often ended up being bounced from one foster home to another because of their unique needs and problems, and people’s general unwillingness to bring in a new family member with potentially higher vet bills who may only live for a few months or years.” In 2012, they received official nonprofit status. At first, the Goodins operated the sanctuary out of their home, though they found that some neighbors were not supportive of living next to a dog sanctuary. Prior to 2017, the approximately 50 dogs in care of the sanctuary lived in two separate homes in a residential area. In August 2016, the county zoning board determined that the sanctuary must move due to neighbor complaints. In February 2017, the Goodins opened a dedicated space for the rescued dogs. As of 2018, OFSDS has housed approximately 700 elderly and disabled dogs at its facilities. Operations OFSDS seeks to improve the lives of \\"senior dogs,\\" which it defines as dogs who are age six and older. Most of its dogs are at least ten years old, however. It adopts suitable dogs from five regional animal shelters. It includes a network of \\"forever foster homes\\" within of Mount Juliet, where dogs can be placed with families while still remaining under the ultimate ownership of the sanctuary. While in the foster homes, OFSDS continues to pay for medical care and preventive healthcare to alleviate some of the burden of adopting an older dog. The foster home provides \\"food and love.\\" Forever foster homes are not charged to adopt a dog from the sanctuary, and foster owners may return dogs to the facility for any reason. As of 2018, 200 dogs were currently in foster homes supported by OFSDS. OFSDS is dependent on donations for operations. Maintaining the healthcare of elderly dogs is a major expense, with the organization averaging US$17,000 on veterinary bills each month. In addition to donations, they receive money from selling branded merchandise. Selling one such shirt featuring the dog \\"Leo\\" has raised over $93,000 for the organization. Facilities As of 2018, OFSDS operates a sanctuary on a property with a building, which was formerly a florist business. The property includes \\"a parklike environment with large trees, landscaping, and a greenhouse to convert to a rainy-day play area.\\" Following OFSDS has amassed a large social media following, with 1.8 million followers on their Facebook page as of October 2018. Individual dogs within the sanctuary may become particularly beloved by followers. The death of \\"Captain Ron\\" in March 2018 was covered in the Irish Examiner and the death of \\"Leo\\" in 2018 covered on an Australian radio station, for example.

His year of birth is unknown, but the 's entry for the 27th day of the seventh month of Hōan 1 (22 August 1120 in the Julian calendar) says that he was in his fifties when he died earlier that same month.

He has worked for more than two decades as a foreign correspondent in Japan and China, including six years as Tokyo bureau chief for The New York Times. He has written or co-written eight books in Japanese, including the best- seller Credibility Lost: The Crisis in Japanese Newspaper Journalism After Fukushima (Futabasha, 2012). In English, he co-edited Reinventing Japan: New Directions in Global Leadership (Praeger, 2018). He has also taught journalism at the University of Tokyo. Fackler appeared as himself in the Japanese film The Journalist (Japanese: Shimbun Kisha; 2019), directed by Michihito Fujii and based on a book by Japanese reporter Isoko Mochizuki. Biography After graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 1994, Fackler started his career as a journalist at Bloomberg News in 1996, working in Tokyo where he covered financial markets. The following year, he reported on a racketeering scandal involving corporate extortionists in Japan known as Sōkaiya who took millions of dollars from major brokerages and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank. Fackler's articles included a profile of the racketeer at the center of the scandal, Ryuichi Koike. Fackler worked for five years at the Associated Press in Tokyo, Beijing, Shanghai and New York City. In April 2001, he covered the Hainan Island incident, when a U.S. Navy plane landed on the Chinese island of Hainan after colliding with a People's Liberation Army Navy jet fighter. Fackler returned to Tokyo in 2003 to work at The Wall Street Journal, where he covered the Japanese financial crisis caused by bad loans at banks and the so-called Takenaka Plan of the financial services minister, Heizō Takenaka, to end the crisis. Fackler worked in the Tokyo bureau of the New York Times starting as a freelancer in 2005 and working his way to business correspondent in 2007. Two years later, he was named Tokyo bureau chief, a post he held until 2015. During that time, he also wrote about South Korea, North Korea and China. In 2012, he was part of a team that was named as finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in International Reporting for its coverage of the March 2011 Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, and the Japanese government's refusal to disclose data on the spread of radiation to evacuees. The prize committee called their articles a \\"powerful exploration of serious mistakes concealed by authorities in Japan after a tsunami and earthquake devastated the nation, and caused a nuclear disaster.\\" In November 2011, Fackler was the first foreign reporter to enter the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant after the disaster. Fackler has also written for magazines such as Foreign Policy and the Columbia Journalism Review about Japanese media issues, including a failed effort at investigative reporting at the daily Asahi Shimbun. Fackler has also contributed to Japanese journalism by serving as an adjunct researcher at Waseda University's Institute for Journalism, supporting the establishment of the Waseda Chronicle, a non-profit investigative reporting initiative. He told a symposium in Tokyo co-hosted by the Committee to Protect Journalists: “There are some very admirable qualities of Japanese journalism. One is tenacity, the other is thoroughness. Journalists read all the documents; they cover all the basics.” Fackler is fluent in Japanese and has written or co-written eight books in that language, including Credibility Lost: The Crisis in Japanese Newspaper Journalism After Fukushima, a critical look at Japanese media coverage of the nuclear disaster.http://www.futabasha.co.jp/booksdb/smp/book/bookview/978-4-575-15394-1/smp.html?c=32500&o;=date&type;=t&word;=マーティン・ファクラー In English, he was the lead editor of Reinventing Japan: New Directions in Global Leadership, a volume on Japan's new relevance to the world in an era when the postwar American-led order is being challenged.

Discovery and excavation  The site was first discovered in the late 1980s by British archaeologists and was put under a preservation order by the ruler of Ras Al Khaimah in 2004 (His father, the late Shaikh Saqr Bin Mohammad Al Qasimi had previously, in 1999, called for all archaeological sites in the emirate to be preserved). Although the site was seen to be threatened by the development of the northern extension of the arterial Emirates Road (E611), with proposals tabled to amend the road development to avoid damage to the site, the road project went ahead. Seih Al Harf was excavated by a team from the University of Durham, led by Derek Kennet, in the spring of 2013. The site comprises a series of 50 burial sites, of which two were directly threatened by the road development, an 18-metre horseshoe shaped and a W-shaped tomb. Both were collective graves. Ten other excavated features were also impacted by the road development. The 2013 dig excavated three monumental graves, six smaller collective tombs and a number of smaller burials. The three monumental tombs were all stone-built, corbelled structures and stand as some of the largest tombs from the Wadi Suq period found in Ras Al Khaimah. While most of the graves found were dated to late in this period, one of the tombs was identified as transitional from the earlier Umm Al Nar period (2600–2000 BCE). The area around Seih Al Harf is rich in finds of Wadi Suq era burials, in particular the nearby Shimal site, which contains both Umm al-Nar and Wadi Suq graves.

Her work has been exhibited all over the world and was profiled in the National Film Board of Canada’s 1966 documentary In Search of Medea: The Art of Sylvia Lefkovitz. Among her major pieces are the five-figure bronze Chorus, commissioned for the Mies Van der Rohe complex in Montreal's Westmount Square; her Fathers of Confederation, commemorating the 1967 Canadian Centennial; her eighty-figure Divine Comedy, purchased by the Canadian government and exhibited in the Dante Room of the Royal Palace in Milan on the occasion of Dante’s 700th birthday; and her eight bronze biblical panels in bas-relief, inspired by Ghiberti’s Bronze Doors on the Florence Baptistery.

Sylvia Lefkovitz was born in Montreal, Quebec to immigrant parents of Russian and Hungarian Jewish descent. Lefkovitz first displayed a talent for drawing in elementary school, and by the seventh grade was already sketching portraits. She went on to attend Baron Byng High School where art teacher Anne Savage encouraged her to pursue her artistic ambitions.Hill, Harriet (March 20, 1959) “Facts and Fancies”. The Gazette, Montreal.Hill, Harriet (October 18, 1962) “Facts and Fancies”. The Gazette, Montreal. Supported by her working-class parents, she embarked on a lifetime of study by taking classes at the École des beaux-arts de Montréal.Solomon, Heather (July 17, 1986). “Students respond to the “school of life” approach”. The Canadian Jewish News. After graduating high school, Lefkovitz began art studies at Columbia University in New York in 1941. She returned to Montreal a year later, working nights during the Second World War at Fairchild Aircraft while her days were spent studying at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts School. On scholarship at the school for drawing, she studied under Eldon Grier until 1946, when she returned to Columbia University for two more years.Mary Louise (October 15, 1959) “Local artist suggest travelling exhibition across Canada as aid”. The Monitor, Montreal. While studying there under Oronzio Maldarelli and Henry Meloy, she supported herself by again working nights as a keypunch operator for the Blue Cross. After a brief return to Montreal, Lefkovitz decided to continue her studies at the Louvre and Académie Julian in Paris. A year later, she moved on to Spain and Italy for a time before returning to Montreal, where she took a bookkeeping day job, taught art in the evenings, and “painted like mad.” She began experimenting in the ancient art form of encaustic painting, and in 1953, several of these works were exhibited in Montreal.Richardson, Al (March 13, 1953) “Local Girl Revives Ancient Art”. The Herald, Montreal. Lefkovitz spent four months in Mexico in 1954, studying Orozco’s mural techniques and observing the creation of major historical murals in the Pyroxylin medium (a lacquer technique).Solomon, Heather (March 16, 2006). “Lefkovitz lives again through her legacy”. The Canadian Jewish News.Samuels, A. (22 April 1963). Letter to Department of Foreign Affairs and National Resources, Historic Sites Division. The Mexican muralists’ depiction of oppressed peoples and social injustice inspired her to apply their techniques to the interpretation of these issues in her own country. Upon her return to Montreal, she received a commission from the Redpath Museum to create a series of murals depicting the life and career of Louis Riel. The work won Lefkovitz her first major professional recognition. The Riel mural was exhibited as part of the formal opening of the park on St. Helen’s Island in Montreal by invitation of the Municipal Government. The panels were later purchased by the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources and are on display in the National Historic Park in North Battleford, Saskatchewan. The following year, a second series of historical panels depicting the expulsion of the Acadians was exhibited in Gallery XII in the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. Those five panels, which run 60 feet in length and are six feet high, are now housed at the Université Sainte-Anne.Biermann, Helmer (July 11, 1986) “Biermann’s Column”. Evening Times Globe, New Brunswick. In 1958, Lefkovitz was awarded an Arts Teachers Fellowship by the Canada Council to return to Mexico for a year, allowing her to devote all her time and attention to art for the first time. In Mexico City, she experimented with different lacquers under Professor José L. Gutiérrez at the Instituto Politécnico Nacional, and further mastered her mural technique. She also encountered the renowned painter David Alfaro Siqueiros, and they made plans to collaborate on a mural (it is unclear as to whether this work ever materialized).Lefkovitz, Sylvia (January 28, 1959) Letter/Progress Report to the Secretary of the Canada Council from Mexico regarding her grant. In 1959, Lefkovitz returned to her bookkeeping job in Montreal, painting in whatever spare time she had. By 1960, she had saved enough money to travel again, and headed to Italy; it was there that her focus shifted to sculpture. In the marble studios of Florence, she took an apprenticeship in carving, and in the city’s ceramic factories, she learned the art of terra cotta.Goodman, Joyce (July 30, 1962) “Artist’s Luggage Weighs Two Tons”. The Montreal Star. Working in the foundries, she rapidly mastered the technique of lost-wax casting. In 1962, she was awarded the Porcellino Award as the best resident foreign artist. She returned home later that year, fluent in Italian and accompanied by nine crates of her painting and sculpture. The Waddington Galleries in Montreal mounted a solo exhibit of her artwork. She used this homecoming to begin sculpting with Canadian wood. She travelled again in 1963, in Greece and Rome, finally settling in Milan, where she had her first major Italian solo exhibit at the Galleria Montenapoleone. The show won critical acclaim, and she was lauded for her interpretation of the Italian Renaissance tradition in both her painting and sculpture. Lefkovitz remained in Milan for the better part of seventeen years, living and working on a student visa.MacNeill, Michelle (August 29, 2018). Personal interview with Barbara Samuels, niece of Sylvia Lefkovitz, July 18, 2018. The almost two-decade period was one of significant professional success, with a string of exhibitions, retrospectives, and awards. She also won major public and private commissions in both Europe and Canada, including The Chorus, Fathers of Confederation and the Divine Comedy. She returned to Montreal in 1981, where she worked and taught from both her Montreal studio (Studio 3) and at the Saidye Bronfman Centre School of Fine Arts until her death in 1987 at the age of 62.

History Big Red Machine began as a musical collaboration in 2008, when Aaron Dessner messaged Justin Vernon on MySpace, without any prior personal meeting. Dessner sent Vernon an instrumental idea for a compilation album named Dark Was the Night, benefiting the Red Hot Organization, which he wanted Vernon to write a song for. The sketch was titled \\"Big Red Machine\\", and Vernon created a completed song using the track. The album was celebrated with a show at Radio City Music Hall, where the two met and began further collaborating. Since then, they have worked on a number of projects together, including PEOPLE Collective, Eaux Claires Music & Arts Festival, and Day of the Dead. Dessner is most famous for being a founding member, songwriter, and producer for The National, and Vernon for being the front man of Bon Iver. In 2016, Vernon, Dessner, and Dessner's twin brother Bryce Dessner founded an artist collective named PEOPLE. The PEOPLE website states that the concept aims to \\"establish an independent and nurturing space in which to make work (generally around music) that is collaborative, spontaneous and expressive in nature and where all unnecessary distractions or obstacles that get in the way are removed.\\" They first gathered for a festival at Funkhaus, Berlin, in 2016. The second festival took place in 2018, again at Funkhaus. Since 2016, Big Red Machine has played festival sets at Eaux Claires, Haven, and From a Safe Harbour. Dessner has stated that the original sketch that he sent to Vernon in 2008, named \\"Big Red Machine\\", uses the nickname of the 1970s Cincinnati Reds teams that won the World Series back to back in 1975 and 1976. The team received the nickname \\"The Big Red Machine\\" throughout this successful period. Aaron Dessner grew up in Cincinnati, and he and his twin brother were born in 1976, during the Reds' run. Big Red Machine (2018) Big Red Machine released their debut album Big Red Machine on August 31, 2018, via PEOPLE and Jagjaguwar. Prior to this, the outfit released four tracks from the full- length album: \\"Gratitude\\", \\"Lyla\\", \\"Hymnostic\\", and \\"Forest Green\\". The 10-track self-titled album was co-produced by Dessner, Vernon, and Brad Cook, while Jonathan Low mixed the recording. The album features approximately 40 collaborators, including Bryce Dessner, Bryan Devendorf, Richard Parry, Phoebe Bridgers, Lisa Hannigan, JT Bates, and Kate Stables, among others.

Early years Stellhorn was born at Brüninghorstedt in the Kingdom of Hanover, Germany, son of Johann Peter and Katharina (Wesseli) Stellhorn. He immigrated to the United States when he was twelve. His father died of cholera in Fort Wayne, Indiana, in September 1854, leaving his mother widowed with two young children. His older brother helped provide for the family. He attended German language Lutheran parochial schools in Fort Wayne. In the fall of 1855, Stellhorn entered the Practical Theological Seminary of the Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod (LCMS) in that city. Family life Frederick married Christiane Maria, daughter of Ernst and Amalie (Weber) Buenger, in Altenburg, Missouri, on January 9, 1866. They had seven children. After her death he married Louise, daughter of Rev. Henry and Mary Louisa (Beilharz) Lang and widow of Fletcher Darst, in 1901. Early adulthood From Fort Wayne he went to St. Louis, Missouri. to finish his classical education and three years later, in 1865, he was graduated from Concordia Seminary there. He entered the office of the Holy Ministry in the LCMS. Shortly afterward, he suffered sunstroke and had to resign his first call. He re-entered the ministry in 1867 in a small parish which allowed him to regain his strength and study academic subjects. Two years later, in 1869, he entered the Wisconsin Synod's Northwestern College in Watertown, Wisconsin, to continue his interest in classical education. Two years later in 1871 he was called back to the seminary in Fort Wayne to teach. Predestinarian Controversy and the Ohio Synod In Fort Wayne he spent six years in the upheaval that culminated in the Predestination Controversy of 1880. He became a 'persona non grata' due to his outspoken opposition to the leader of the LCMS, C. F. W. Walther. This disagreement led to his being invited to join the Ohio Synod in 1881, and he was called to Columbus, Ohio, to serve as professor of German language in Capital University and professor in the Ohio Synod's Evangelical Lutheran Theological Seminary. He also served as the housefather of the institution, but his term of office as housefather was short. To a man of his academic habits, the petty annoyances that go with that job were distasteful. Later life and death His term of office as professor of German was long, and it was not until late in life when natural decline made it necessary for him to have less work that he was relieved. His influence in the German language department made itself felt in the synod because it was largely due to him that the late 19th and early 20th century pastors of the Ohio Synod were known to preach well in German. He taught up until the time of his death while still on faculty at Capital University at age 78. Publications He served as editor of the Lutherische Kirchenzeitung prior to Richard C. H. Lenski and also edited the Theologische Zeitblatter. * Worum handelt es sich eigentlich in dem gegenwärtigen Lehrstreit über die Gnadenwahl? : für jeden lutherischen Christen einfach und deutlich beantwortet (1881). * What is the real question in the present controversy on predestination? : a plain and clear answer for every Lutheran Christian (1881). * Prüfung der \\"Beleuchtung\\" Hrn.

In Fremont and then Norwalk, Ohio it made diners from 1931 to 1937.Leykam, Garrison, Classic Diners of Connecticut, American Palate, Charleston SC (2013) The Bixler Diner was noted for its wide swath. The diners were characterized by their two wide double hung windows and barrel roof with a fancy profile at the ends. History The company opened in the midst of the Great Depression by Louis C. Voelker.Gutman, Richard, American Diner Then and Now, Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore (1993) The units were manufactured in sections and shipped to locations in pieces which had to be assembled on-site. The diner’s width of 16 feet made this a desirable design. The knocked-down construction allowed the units to be shipped in four foot wide sections. They took less than a month to assemble and prepare for use. In addition to their large size (any length in multiples of the four-foot sections), the Bixler was distinguishable by its barrel roof construction with characteristic end trim and also the modular double hung two-foot windows. Booths with tall partitions were standard. Bixler required a 10% deposit with the order, 15% before shipping and the remainder in 35 equal payments. Diners were erected throughout the Northeast and as far west as St. Louis. The Great Depression lingered, however, and the company foundered by 1937. Too few entrepreneurs could afford the deposit required (generally $500) along with paying to obtain and construct the plot, permits and foundations required.

He composed the setting of verses from Psalm 47 in 1973 for a four-part choir and organ, and also made a version with orchestra. It was first published in 1973. Later, Rutter included it in Psalmfest, a collection of nine psalm settings.  History and music  Rutter composed the psalm setting in 1973 for Lionel Dakers and the Incorporated Association of Organists. He chose verses 1–7 (in the King James Version numbering) from Psalm 47, a psalm calling to exalt God as the king of \\"all the earth\\" with hands, voices and instruments. The Hebrew original mentions the shofar, which is given as trumpet in English. The psalm is often associated with the Feast of the Ascension, because it mentions God going up with a shout. According to the sheet music published by Oxford University Press at OUP.com, Rutter set the text in one movement, marked Bright and rhythmic. He scored it for a four-part choir and organ, but also made a version with orchestra. Beginning in common time, the accompaniment has an ostinato-syncopated rhythm in the bass, grouping the eighth notes in a measure 3 + 3 + 2. Similar patterns were later used for the \\"Latin exuberance\\" in Rutter's Magnificat. The upper voices move in parallel scales in even eighth notes, alternating one measure downward and one measure upward. The choir alone enters in unison with a phrase that moves mostly upwards, covering an octave. It picks up the syncope in the stresses of the syllables \\"clap\\" and \\"hands\\", and runs for the remainder of the first line, ending on another syncope on the word \\"people\\". The time changes often allow for a natural declamation of the text, including extra measures of . A first climax is reached with the words \\"He is the great King\\", where the choir is divided in five parts, marked fortissimo. The following verses are given to one part only, with the altos beginning \\"He shall subdue the people under us\\", marked tranquillo. The text \\"O sing praises unto our God\\" is broader, while \\"sing ye praises with understanding\\" is given to the choir a cappella. The anthem ends with a recapitulation of the exuberant beginning, with even more syncopation. The anthem was published by Oxford University Press in 1973. It was recorded several times, including a 1993 performance conducted by the composer in 1993 with his Cambridge Singers and the City of London Sinfonia, reissued in 2005 as part of an album Gloria : The sacred music of John Rutter, which also contains A Gaelic Blessing and \\"The Lord bless you and keep you\\", among many others. In 1997, Klaus Uwe Ludwig conducted the organ version with the Bach-Chor Wiesbaden. Kalevi Kiviniemi was the organist in a 2003 recording with the Harju Kamerkoor conducted by Heikki Limola. On a 2015 recording by the choir of Ely Cathedral, conducted by Paul Trepte, it was connected liturgically to the Feast of Christ the King, concluding the collection. Rutter included the setting, together with eight other of his psalm settings, in a collection called Psalmfest. This was first recorded in 2014 by St Albans Cathedral Choir, the Abbey Girls' Choir and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Lucas. At that time, John Quinn wrote a review of Rutter's intelligent approach to handling the texts, and specifically about O clap your hands: \\"When I first heard it, many years ago, I didn't much like [it]; the bouncy jollity of the opening in particular seemed a bit relentless to me. I've changed my mind, however; there's more depth than I'd first appreciated in the centre of the setting.\\"  References  External links * O Clap Your Hands – Mormon Tabernacle Choir udsu.tried.fun Anthems Compositions by John Rutter 1973 compositions ","title":"O clap your hands (Rutter)"},{"id":"58415091","text":"Dilip Ruwan Herath Mudiyanselage (born 4 July 1991) is a sprinter from Sri Lanka who specialises in the 400 m distance.

In February 2018, Sharjah Police arrested a Pakistani national accused of carrying out a Dhs2.5 million bitcoin fraud.  Services  A number of online services are managed by Sharjah Police, including traffic licensing and fines payment as well as a range of security and community services. The force also operates an online complaints service, 'Open Doors'. The police call centre manages high volumes of calls, up to 45,000 during Ramadan, mostly complaints against beggars or relating to traffic violations. A number of services are available using the Sharjah Police Smart App. = Rafid = The 50 vehicles of the Rafid traffic accident patrol (there are 120 Rafid officers) was launched in May 2018 and replaced the previous Saeed service, attending minor traffic incidents and producing police reports. Supported by a mobile Rafid application, the Rafid patrol charges a fee of Dhs400 for attending an accident and writing a police report. Without this report, vehicle repairs cannot be carried out in Sharjah. If app users complete the report without requiring a Rafid officer to attend, the fee is reduced to Dhs350. A 14-man contact centre supports the Rafid service, which aims to respond to Sharjah's some 300 daily minor accidents within 15 minutes. Rafid officers are not policemen. = Police Sciences Academy = The Sharjah Police Sciences Academy is located at Sharjah University City. Governed by the Police Sciences Academy Council, in 2018 it launched a research award aiming to encourage innovation and research in curbing crime and increasing public security. = Police Magazine = Established in 1988, the Sharjah Police magazine, Al Shurti, is a monthly bulletin. A quarterly title, Al Fikr Al Shurti, is also published. A radio show dedicated to issues of public security, Aman Ya Beladi, runs on Sharjah Radio and a TV programme also runs on Sharjah Television.  Uniform and livery  The Sharjah Police uniform is either green with a red cap and epaulettes or blue/grey with a blue cap. Police cars are blue and white, including those of the 'Anjad' patrol.

Biography  Cherny grew up in a small house with a disabled mother, his younger brother Mark and his sister. Since childhood he was engaged in sports, and was the champion of the Smolensk Oblast in martial arts. Having gone into the army, he served in an elite battalion of deep reconnaissance. After his return, he learned that his brother had joined a criminal group in Smolensk. He did not follow in his footsteps, and began to work as a security guard in one of the markets of Smolensk. Cherny had a habit of wearing both winter and summer camouflage uniforms. In his own words, \\"his girlfriends did not [wait] for him to return from the army and got married.\\" After this, he decided to take revenge.Документальный фильм из цикла «Криминальная Россия» — «Чёрная лента» In August 1999, Cherny attacked a girl, hitting her and pushing her into the bushes, and trying to strangle her. However, the girl cried out, and when he saw that a man was approaching, Cherny ran away. On September 19, Cherny strangled a girl in the vicinity of the town of Komintern, who was going to a disco. He took off her outer garments and pulled the earrings from her ears. The body was soon found in a ravine near the place of the murder. On September 24, Cherny also killed another girl at the spring in the Redovka Park in the same way. At her neck, a bra was tied tightly in a knot. The deceased had lost a leather jacket, leather waistcoat, a breastplate, a bunch of keys and a ticket. On September 27, in the village of Vishenka, in an abandoned warehouse, the corpse of a girl was found, with signs of strangulation, who went missing on September 24. On the neck a belt from the jacket was tied in two knots. On September 29, in front of GSK \\"Tikhvinka-3\\" the body of another strangled girl was found. A loop of thin strap from a purse was fastened around his neck and tied back to two knots. UVD Smolensk seriously engaged in the disclosure of the murder series, and the killer, feeling the danger, \\"fell to the bottom\\", not betraying himself and not committing new atrocities. A month later, the murderer reappeared, strangling two more girls in three days. On November 4, near the Yasennaya River, which flowed in the ravine between the village of Vishenka and the garage-building cooperative \\"Svet-2\\", a corpse of a girl was found, photographs of whom were hanging on search trays for two days around the city. On the neck of the deceased, the murderer had tied handkerchief and a belt from his coat tightly around her neck, and her outer clothing, a gold ring, earrings and a watch were stolen. On November 6, in the forest belt in the nuclear power plant-80 area, half a kilometer from the Krasninskoe highway, the body of another victim was found, and had lost her passport and student card. On November 22, Cherny met a girl in the city centre. The next day, he invited her to go on a walk and get some fresh air, to which she agreed. When they met, they got into his car and went for a drive. Suddenly, Cherny attacked the companion, tried to strangle her, then threw her into the trunk and drove her to the outskirts, where he hung her from a tree with her own sneakers' shoelaces. However, the girl survived and soon turned to the police, but because of the shock experienced, she was confused and could not provide any valuable information. In early December, the investigators managed to find the victim who survived the August attack, who said that she had seen the criminal in one of the city's markets. For several days she was taken to the markets of Smolensk, and on December 14 she pointed the detectives on the man who attacked her. The suspect was placed on surveillance round the clock, including using a hidden camera. When they looked through the record with the suspect's image, one of the detectives said that he knew a very similar person - a member of a local criminal group named Mark Cherny. It turned out that Mark was the younger brother of the main suspect - a 22-year-old security guard of a private security company Sergey Cherny. Meanwhile, corpses were still found around the city. On December 17, in the ravine for GSK \\"Zvezda\\" in the second Krasninskiy lane the corpse of another girl was found with a leather belt from a coat tied on two knots around her neck. On December 22 near the Yasennaya River in the \\"Readovka\\" park another corpse was found. Subsequently, the Cherny brothers were detained. = Arrest = On December 23, almost simultaneously, with a difference of half an hour, both brothers were detained. In the apartments where Mark and Sergey lived, a search was conducted, and as a result of which a red jacket from one of the victims was found in Sergey's apartment, which was a shock to the killer himself. At the first interrogation it was revealed that he did not have an alibi for any of the murders. With a more thorough search of Cherny's apartment, jewels from the murdered girls and firearms unrelated to the case were found. Cherny soon confessed to everything, and even reported two more murders. One of them was committed in mid-August, and the other - in late October. Among other things, Cherny confessed to another murder, telling how he drowned one victim in a creek, which law enforcement considered an accident first. But Cherny's fault in this death was later questioned. Cherny was sent for a forensic medical examination, with the second exam result diagnosing him with schizophrenia. He was sent for compulsory treatment in a special psychiatric hospital. On June 24, 2001, Cherny died from pneumonia.

Early life and education  Kathleen Lambourne was born in Brisbane, Queensland in 1946. She studied veterinary science at The University of Queensland, graduating with a Bachelor of Veterinary Science (with Honours) in 1968.  Career  Dr Marshall began work as a veterinarian, eventually opening her own veterinary surgery below her home at 66 Main Avenue in the Brisbane suburb of Wilston. She was a member of a number of charities committed to preventing animal cruelty, serving as President of The Cat Protection Society of Queensland (1996-1998). She was also the Founder of Friends of the Vet School at The University of Queensland.  Death and murder investigation  Dr Marshall was found dead in the veterinary surgery beneath her Wilston home in March 1998 after being \\"stabbed more than 50 times\\". Following an investigation, Andrew Fitzherbert, a palm reader from Zillmere and the founder of the Queensland Palmistry Guild, was prosecuted and convicted for her murder based on DNA evidence. In sentencing Fitzherbert to life imprisonment, the Honourable Justice Kenneth MacKenzie (as he was then) said the crime was one which Fitzherbert would not have been convicted of \\"but for the recent explosion in knowledge in the field of genetics.\\"  Legacy  On 13 March 2002, The University of Queensland officially opened The Kathleen Lambourne Building (82F) at their St Lucia campus.

As described by a 19th-century railway guide, Hope End Park and a country house lay near the West Midland Railway, between the stations at Colwall and Ledbury. Hope End House may refer to any one of three houses on the estate, all reduced and much altered from their original states. Hope End ward is a local government area that is more extensive than the old estate. In 1831 an earlier guide, to Ledbury, noted Hope End among \\"gentlemen's seats and residences\\", by the Colwall road. It belonged then to E. M. Barrett. This was Edward Moulton-Barrett, father of Elizabeth Barrett Browning who was brought up there; financial problems caused him to sell it the following year. The same guide gives fulsome praise to the Park: \\"Nothing can surpass the romantic beauty of Hope-end park. The most lovely graces of nature are here combined.\\" According to Elizabeth, the setting for her poem The Lost Bower was the wood above Hope End House's garden.

The elections were non-partisan, and in races without any candidate receiving an absolute majority of votes runoff elections were held on April 2. Held in the middle of the mayor's term, it would be the penultimate such election; four-year terms for aldermen were adopted in 1935, coinciding with the mayoral election that year. All told, despite the non-partisan nature of the elections, candidates affiliated with the Republican party won 27 seats and those affiliated with the Democratic party won 23. 11 seats were decided by means of a runoff election, and a Republican candidate won all but one of those elections. Six incumbent aldermen were defeated in the first round, and an additional four fell in the runoffs, all by Republican candidates. Four aldermen, all Democratic, were returned without opposition. Issues and endorsements The main issue of the elections was the influence of Mayor Thompson over the City Government and individual aldermen. Senior US Senator and former Governor Charles Deneen fronted the main slate of anti-Thompson candidates. Many reformers had hoped and even proclaimed that the election would \\"wipe...Thompson off the political map.\\" The reform-minded Chicago Tribune and Municipal Voter's League endorsed candidates based on their perceived independence from Thompson. The elections were held on a backdrop of violence throughout the city. In particular the race for the so-called \\"Bloody Twentieth\\" ward had been marked by the murder in April 1928 of African-American reform candidate for committeeman Octavius Granady during the Pineapple Primary. The Daily Chronicle in DeKalb reported that \\"Another surprise of the election - for the police at least - was that no one was murdered, kidnapped, or slugged,\\" although it attributed such lack of violence to the heavy patrol of polling places by police officers that compelled Police Commissioner William Russell to set aside his investigation of the recent Saint Valentine's Day Massacre. It was also subject to some disputes in electoral law, with such sitting aldermen as Sheldon Govier of the 9th ward and Joseph McDonough of the 13th raising accusations of fraudulent petitions against many of their opponents given the 40% increase in the number of candidates from the 1927 elections and some aldermen disputing a filing deadline that sitting aldermen Coyle, Haffa, and Hoellen had missed. The Daily Chronicle asserted that four of the six aldermen defeated in the first round had been Thompson supporters. Nevertheless, the election was generally considered a failure for the reformers. Many of Thompson's closest allies, including his former African-American floor leader Louis B. Anderson of the 2nd Ward, retained their seats. Particularly devastating was the loss of 20th ward incumbent A.J. Prignano, whom the Municipal Voter's League had extolled as \\"the best alderman [the] ward has had in many years,\\" to William V. Pacelli, a candidate fronted by the Ellers, who were implicated in Granady's murder. Furthermore, of the nine candidates endorsed by the Tribune and Municipal Voter's League leading up to the runoff elections (not including contests where neither or both candidates were endorsed), only Frank Konkowski of the 31st Ward won his contest. Ultimately, Thompson's rule over the City would continue unabated until the 1931 elections.
