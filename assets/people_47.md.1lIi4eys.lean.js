This is often subsumed under the subject of the Cultural Revolution, but it is worth considering Continuous Revolution Theory in its own right as an independent topic. Overview Continuous Revolution Theory is rooted in Mao's thoughts regarding the nature of contradiction. He argues that, since contradictions within society between revolutionary and reactionary elements can be expected to continue for a long time, it is necessary to work continuously toward the progressive fulfillment of the revolutionary program. As Mao has written: > \\"Ever difference in men's concepts should be regarded as reflecting an > objective contradiction. Objective contradictions are in subjective > thinking, and this process constitutes the contradictory movement of > concepts, pushes forward the development of thought, and ceaselessly solves > problems in man's thinking.\\" The contention that contradiction is inherent to everything is thus taken to suggest that revolution must be continual if it is not to succumb reactionary forces. Continuous Revolution Theory is rooted in this fundamental insight regarding the nature of contradiction. It suggests that a revolution cannot really be \\"over\\" because contradictions will continue to develop, such that it is necessary to perpetually resolve emergent contradictions in favor of the revolutionary program while resisting the risk of sliding back into reaction. Continuous Revolution Theory thus rejects any notion of a revolution that is once and for all, since it is impossible to remove contradiction per se from the fabric of nature. Starr makes it clear that contradiction is the central concept of Continuous Revolution Theory in his discussion of the key themes of the theory: > \\"These themes are, first, that contradiction or conflict in a society is > ubiquitous and permanent and that this condition applies just as surely to a > society in the process of socialist transformation as it does to a bourgeois > or feudal society.\\" This leads to the implication that classes within any given society are also a permanent feature of society as such. The only way that these contradictions could be ameliorated is to produce a new society in which human nature itself is transformed in the direction of selflessness and concern for the whole rather than the self. This is why Mao believed, contrary to Marx, that the real struggle was cultural rather than merely economic in nature. Relationship to the Cultural Revolution Continuous Revolution Theory is closely related to but not identical with the Cultural Revolution. More specifically, Continuous Revolution Theory was the guiding ideology of the Cultural Revolution, with the Cultural Revolution thus being how the Communist Party of China attempted to implement Continuous Revolution Theory. The Cultural Revolution was itself a result of Mao's perception, in 1966, that the Communist leadership itself had become corrupted: > \\"Believing that current Communist leaders were taking the party, and China > itself, in the wrong direction, Mao called on the nation's youth to purge > the 'impure' elements of Chinese society and revive the revolutionary spirit > that had led to victory in the civil war 20 decades and the formation of the > People's Republic of China.\\" Continuous Revolution Theory required Mao to turn against the Communist leadership itself. Mao turned against the very party for whose creation he was responsible. Continuous Revolutionary Theory foresaw that the Communist ruling class can itself turn away from the revolutionary standpoint and become a new ruling class rather than a true dictatorship of the proletariat. This is because new contradictions always emerge, and being revolutionary is determined not merely by one's formal self-identification but rather by the actions that one takes in response to those new contradictions. The Cultural Revolution was inspired by Continuous Revolution Theory as its guiding ideology. However, according to Continuous Revolution Theory, even the Cultural Revolution could one day need to be overthrown, insofar as stopped being truly revolutionary. Relationship to Marxism Mao's understanding of contradiction is purely dialectical, which is very close to the original thought of Marx as expressed in classic works such as the Communist Manifesto. However, Continuous Revolution Theory is even more closely related to Hegel than it is to the thought of Marx. According to Hegel, all of human history is a process of Spirit working through its own contradictions and striving to manifest itself at higher and higher levels. Marx believed that Hegel was wrong about the primacy of mind (or spirit) and that the real struggle was rather material/economic in nature. Mao reverses this view back to something closer to Hegel as a result of Mao's belief that cultural transformation is essential for producing the new socialist man. Marx was an inversion of Hegel, but Mao is in some ways almost an inversion of Marx, which ironically returns him to being rather close to Hegel. Continuous Revolution Theory is essentially idealistic rather than materialistic in nature, and the need for continuous revolution is not based on material conditions per se but rather on the fact that contradiction is metaphysically built into the nature of everything. Historical Evaluation Mao had the clear insight that revolutions can betray themselves and that the new ruling class that emerges in the aftermath of a revolution may itself need to be challenged through a process of continuous revolution. However, the Cultural Revolution that was driven by Continuous Revolution Theory was marked by atrocities, and that it would be difficult to unequivocally declare that the Cultural Revolution did, in fact, serve truly revolutionary ends. After the death of Mao and Arrest of the Gang of Four, CCP clearly has no interest in continuous revolution: a new ruling class has in fact consolidated itself. The failure of the Cultural Revolution raises questions about whether Continuous Revolution Theory is actually practicable.

He is best known for his discoveries of the link between blood–brain barrier (BBB) disruption and Epileptogenesis (development of epilepsy) and the mechanisms underlying it, and for the utilization of BBB imaging as a potential Biomarker of epilepsy and other brain diseases. Biography Friedman was born in Jaffa, Israel. Graduated from Handasaim Herzliya High School in his former campus in Tel Aviv. He earned both MD and PhD (Under the supervision of Prof. Michael Gutnick) degrees at BGU (1991), Faculty of health sciences as an Atuda cadet. While serving as an army doctor he began his ongoing collaboration with Prof. Hermona Soreq and Prof. Daniela Kaufer. After this term he joined the residency program at the neurosurgical department in Soroka Medical Center (1997). After a while (2002), he went to Berlin, Germany for a period as a guest scientist at Charité Medical University and established a long-last collaboration with Uwe Heinemann. Then he came back to his alma mater at BGU where he became a full professor in 2012, and from 2014 he is an acting principal investigator and a full professor in both Dalhousie University, Faculty of Medicine and BGU. Scientific career In his early career, while being an army doctor and collaborating with Prof. Soreq and Prof. Kaufer, Friedman made his first discoveries regarding the functioning of the cholinergic system under stress conditions.Kaufer, Daniela; Friedman, Alon; Seidman, Shlomo; Soreq, Hermona (1998). \\"Acute stress facilitates long-lasting changes in cholinergic gene expression\\".

Clinical Neurophysiology, 22:1-9. he began to challenge the hypothesis that BBB disruption, as a common implication of multiple epilepsy inducing conditions such as stroke and traumatic brain injury, serves as a mechanistic factor in epileptogenesis. He went to Berlin to establish a novel model of epilepsy which enabled him to show causality for the first time between BBB disruption and epileptogenesis.Seiffert, E., Dreier, J.P., Ivens, S., Bechmann, I., Heinemann, U. and Friedman, A. 2004, Lasting blood-brain barrier disruption induces epileptic focus in the rat somatosensory cortex. J. Neuroscience, 24:7829-36. Then, in collaboration with Prof. Kaufer he exposed that albumin, the most frequent protein in the serum is the agent that leaks from the blood into the brain parenchyma under BBB disruption conditions and induces epileptogenesis by activation of the transforming growth factor beta receptor on astrocytes.Ivens, S., Kaufer, D., Seiffert, E., Bechmann, I., Tomkins, O., Heinemann, U. and Friedman, A. 2007, TGF-beta receptor mediated albumin uptake into astrocytes is involved in neocortical epileptogenesis.

The posterior cortical hot zone includes sensory cortical areas in the parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. It is the “sensory” cortex, much as the frontal cortex is the “action” cortex. When parts of the posterior cortex are damaged, whole modalities of sensory experience disappear from both waking and dreaming. For example, individuals with a lesion in the Visual area V4 often do not perceive color and dream in black-and-white; those with a lesion in the Visual area V5/MT do not perceive motion and do not dream of motion; subjects with a lesion to fusiform gyrus are impaired in face perception and also do not dream of faces. Compare that to lesions of the cerebellum or frontal cortex that have little effect on sensory experience. Object encoding in the posterior cortical hot zone The sensory component (shape, color, texture) of each object stored in memory is physically encoded by neurons of the posterior cortical hot zone in structures called neuronal ensembles (NEs), neuronal assemblies , neural cliques , or cognits . When one recalls any object, the object-encoding neuronal ensemble (objectNE) in the posterior cortical hot zone activates into synchronous resonant activity that results in conscious perception of the object. The objectNE binding mechanism, based on the Hebbian principle “neurons that fire together, wire together,” came to be known as the Binding-by-Synchrony hypothesis. While the Hebbian principle explains how we perceive a familiar object, it does not explain the infinite number of novel objects that humans can imagine. To account for the limitless constructive imagination, it was proposed that synchronization of independent objectNEs is a general mechanism underlying any novel imaginary experience . When the synchronization of independent objectNEs is driven from the front by the lateral prefrontal cortex, we refer to it as Prefrontal Synthesis; when the synchronization is driven from the back, we refer to it as dreaming or hallucination.

The project was developed by Bordas Renewable Energy and NextEra Energy Resources in three phases that came online starting 2015. As of 2018, Javelina and adjacent wind farms create a contiguous facility with over 1 gigawatt (GW) of electricity generation. Details The number of wind farms throughout South Texas has grown rapidly since about 2010 due to a combination of high regional demand growth, productive wind resources, and less encumbered land and transmission capacity. The 150 MW Cedro Hill Wind project was the first to come online in Webb County in 2010, and was soon abutted to the southwest by the 91.2 MW Whitetail Wind in 2012. The first 248.7 MW phase of Javelina Wind joined this grouping in 2015 and is adjacently located to the southeast. It was abutted to the southwest by a second 200 MW phase of Javelina, also named Albercas Wind, in 2016. The third 300 MW phase of Javelina, also named Torrecillas Wind, was completed in 2018 and filled out the remainder of the southeast corner of Webb County. It extends into southwest Duval county, and nearly links with the 78 MW Sendero Wind completed in 2015 in northwest Jim Hogg County. The facility is located in a region with even more rapidly expanding unconventional oil and gas development activity, such as that extending from the Eagle Ford Shale Play. All three phases of the Javelina Wind Energy Center utilize wind turbines from GE Wind Energy. Phase I includes eleven 1.7 MW and 115 2.0 MW turbines, while phase II adds another 100 2.0 MW units. Phase III consists of 120 2.5 MW turbines.

Lynch Memorial Triangle is a park located at the intersection of Rockaway Boulevard, Atlantic Avenue, and 81st Street in Ozone Park, Queens, New York City. The neighborhood's streets were laid out in a grid of streets and avenues at the turn of the 20th century while Rockaway Boulevard cuts diagonally through the grid on its route between Cypress Hills and Woodmere. Triangular intersections that were too small to be developed were designated as public plazas, including this one. In 1949, the city designated this triangle in memory of Lynch, a Woodhaven resident who served as a chaplain in the Pacific Theater during World War Two. Lawrence Lynch was born in Brooklyn in 1917, one of twelve children of devout Catholic parents who emigrated from Ireland. He served as an altar boy at the St. Sylvester church and was ordained as a priest in 1932 through the Redemptorist Order.McClarey, Donald R. “April 24, 1945: Death of Father Cyclone” April 24, 2018 The American Catholic https://www.the-american- catholic.com/2018/04/24/75442/ During World War Two he was assigned as chaplain the legendary Fighting 69th Infantry of the National Guard, where he earned the nickname Father Cyclone for his tireless efforts to comfort the injured and ill of all faiths. He was killed at age 38 on April 25, 1945, during the Battle of Okinawa, while administering Last Rites to a dying soldier. Lynch was buried at the Redemptorist Cemetery, Mount Saint Alphonsus, in Esopus, New York.

Archaeological studies conducted within the cave suggest it was occupied intermittently by humans during at least three periods between the end of the fourth millennium BC and the second millennium BC. The cave results from karstification of the limestone Upper Jurassic Massif. The first formal archaeological excavation was carried out in 1955 by a team led by Hipólito Cabaço. This identified a communal funeral space, and radiocarbon dating of one individual’s bones indicates that the use of the cave as a necropolis dates back to between 3095 BC and 2915 BC. However, it is plausible the cave may have been used as a mortuary in later periods, as around 1200 bone and tooth fragments of a minimum of 34 individuals of both sexes have been identified. Inside the cave Archaeologists also collected a number of objects, such as bone drills, beads of various materials, flint arrowheads, microliths, a polished stone axe, fragments of pottery and a bone figurine of a rabbit. Most of the items collected are now held in the Municipal Museum of Vila Franca de Xira and have been subjected to further analysis by Silva et al. The arrowheads are of a type consistent with those in use during the period when the cave is thought to have been first occupied while the pottery appears consistent with that in use elsewhere during the beaker culture.

The Baldwins had produced wood wool in Birmingham since 1896 and Manchester since 1926 but chose Winsford in Cheshire as the base for their new company. Its product line first began to expand with Jiffy Rugated Products in 1968, and its parent company J.& W.

The strike was in response to the company not agreeing after extensive negotiations to a contract which did not reduce employee pay and benefits. The strike ended eleven days later on April 21. Background The 2016 collective bargaining agreement between Stop & Shop and its union staff expired on February 23, 2019 at midnight. In an effort to reach a memorandum of understanding before the contract's expiration date, the five local chapters of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) that represents 31,000 of Stop and Shop's employees in 249 stores began negotiating a new contract on January 14, 2019. Negotiations throughout the remainder of January were promising, with the local chapters working out \\"wording\\" technicalities with the company. However, progress was effectively halted in early-to-mid February after Stop & Shop presented their monetary and payroll requirements for the upcoming agreement's term. The company's proposed contract sought to eliminate for many employees premium pay on national holidays and Sundays, while also eliminating any raises, reducing contributions to pensions, and increasing healthcare costs. Negotiations continued in good faith between the two sides, but with no progress made, UFCW Local 1445 of Massachusetts became the first chapter to authorize a strike if needed on February 24. In the following weeks, the members of the four other UFCW unions in Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island also authorized a potential strike as a response to the lack of progress. The strike did not occur, and negotiations continued sporadically through the first week of April. On April 3, federal mediators were brought in after the unions rejected Stop & Shop's \\"last offer\\" contract. An unsuccessful round of negotiations overseen by the federal negotiators broke down on April 10. On the same day, shareholders of Ahold Delhaize, the owner of the grocery chain, voted to increase the company's dividend by 11.1% in comparison to the last year. The next day a strike was called. Worker during the Stop & Shop strike. Strike Union Stop & Shop employees walked off the job at 1:15 p.m. on April 11 to strike against the contract proposed by Stop & Shop. The next day the teamster union, which represented the store's delivery truck drivers and warehouse workers, told its members to respect the UFCW's picket line. On April 15, Hockey Hall of Fame defenseman Ray Bourque crossed the picket line at the Stop & Shop in North Andover, Massachusetts; after being filmed by picketing workers, he quickly issued an apology for doing so. On April 17, the Boston Globe reported that \\"at least several dozen\\" Stop & Shop locations were closed due to the strike. While during the first week of the strike, foot traffic by loyal customers in the remaining stores decreased by 75 percent compared to the prior week. The Connecticut Food Bank during the same week coordinated with the stores to ensure that the food at the nearly empty locations did not go to waste. It was estimated that each day of the strike the company lost $20 million in revenue. The managing director of the retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group said, \\"In nearly 30 years, we haven't seen a strike as effective and devastating as this one.\\" Candidates for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, including Bernie Sanders, the junior senator from Vermont, and former Vice President Joe Biden announced support for Stop & Shop's employees' strike for a fair contract. Elizabeth Warren, the senior senator from Massachusetts, who was also a candidate for the nomination, joined workers at the Somerville, Massachusetts location to rally for a fair new contract and brought doughnuts for the striking workers. Democratic candidates, South Bend, Indiana, mayor Pete Buttigieg and senator Amy Klobuchar, of Minnesota, as well as local politicians, also visited over the next few days the picket lines in support of the striking workers. The Stop & Shop strike ended on April 21, 2019, after the company and the striking workers reached a tentative agreement, which preserved health and pension benefits and raised employee pay. The 11-day strike cost the company $224 million in lost sales and $90–100 million in lost profits. The tentative agreement was viewed by the union as a \\"powerful victory\\". In August 2019, Ahold Delhaize reported the 11-day strike resulted in a $345 million loss in sales, with an estimated 1 in 10 customers not coming back to the store as a regular customer after the strike.

March 23, 1587) was a Japanese noble woman from the Sengoku period. Daughter of Nata Akimoto, she was a high priestess of Usa Jingū. She was the first wife of Christian daimyo Ōtomo Sōrin. She actively resisted against the Jesuit mission in Japan and the spread of Christianity in Kyushu. Her religious and political influence was so great that, in fact, Jezebel was the principal leader of the anti-Christian force in Bungo province during the rule of Ōtomo Sōrin.  Life  Lady Nata married Ōtomo Sōrin around 1545, when he was around 15 years old. She was the mother of Ōtomo Yoshimune who succeeded Sōrin as head of the Ōtomo clan; their second son Ōtomo Chikaie, third son Ōtomo Chikamori the last two were adopted by Tawara Chikakata. She had a daughter who was engaged for a time to Chikakata's adopted son Tawara Chikatsura. Despite her husband's kind treatment of the Jesuits, she remained affiliated with her parents' Hachiman Shrine, and associated regularly with shrine maidens, Yamabushi and Bhikkhunī. She has been described by resistant Buddhists as \\"the defender and martyr of the traditional religions that had given Bungo its coherence and peace until the Jesuits arrived.\\" = Resistance against Christianity = Lady Nata was one of the main reasons for slow and difficult spread of Christianity in Bungo province in the 1570-1580. The Jesuits readily identified her as a witch, pagan, idol-worshipping enemy of the church.\\", and thus nicknamed her \\"Jezebel\\", the idol-worshipping queen of King Ahab from the Book of Kings — a figure associated with seduction, desire for usurpation of the office of the king, and protection of the prophets of Baal who fought against God's prophet Elijah. Advised by Jesuits, Ōtomo Sōrin divorced \\"Jezebel\\" in 1578, his clan retainers were completely opposed the divorce. This event was the trigger for the Hachimangū's members to declare war on Christianity. The Nata family controlled a large portion of the Kunisaki peninsula in northern Bungo, and Jezebel held significant tracts of land herself. She gathered around herself numerous powerful supporters at court, who helped oppose Sōrin's destruction of Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines, abandonment of Shinto and Buddhism, and embrace of Christianity. She and her brothers, Tawara Chikakata and Nata Shizumoto, continued to resist the oppression of Christian daimyos and the massive presence of European Christian (specially Portugueses) in eastern Kyushu. Sōrin turned against the Nata family and Usa Jingū shrine, attacking and burning the shrine repeatedly in the 1580s, and seizing its territories and armies to be placed under his direct supervision. After \\"Jezebel's\\" death in 1587, the Nata family declined further; however, her religious influence is said to have lasted throughout the Edo period.

Early life Minczuk was born in São Paulo. His father was conductor of the São Paulo Military Police choir and teacher of music theory who supported his son's music career. Minczuk studied at the Escola Municipal de Música. When Mincuk was 10, he joined the Municipal Symphony Orchestra playing the French horn, being the youngest musician to do so. In 1981 he went to the United States to study at the Juilliard School, graduating in 1987. After graduation, Minczuk joined the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra, invited by Kurt Masur. In 1984 he debuted as a conductor of the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra. Career Minczuk held positions as associate artistic director and associate conductor of the São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra, of the Ribeirão Preto Symphony and titular conductor of the University of Brasília Symphony Orchestra. He has conducted philharmonic orchestras in New York, Los Angeles, Israel and orchestras in Philadelphia and Minnesota; symphonic musicians from St. Louis, Atlanta, Baltimore, Toronto, and Ottawa, among others.

He premiered in the United States as the New York Philharmonic in 1998, and in 2002 he was invited to become Associate conductor, the last position held by Leonard Bernstein.  Controversies  In 2008, when conducting the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra (OSB), 62 musicians asked for Minczuk to resign. According to them, the conductor's absence from the rehearsals, his simultaneous work on OSB, the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Theater and the Calgary Philharmonic, and his \\"harsh and authoritarian\\" temperament motivated the request. In 2011, changes in the audition system led to 35 musicians being fired from the orchestra for refusing to be audioned; they organized a protest and a boycott campaign for new musicians who wished to join OSB. Minczuk justified the decisions affirming that they would bring a renewal to OSB and said \\"all the lies about the crisis wouldn't resist to time and hard work\\". In 2015 Minczuk left the Brazilian Symphony Orchestra, as the budget of the orchestra deteriorated and they could not honor his contract. The dispute still in the local courts resulting in several legal battles against the board of the orchestra. It’s unclear if Mr Minczuk was ever compensated. Since his departure and these legal battles, the orchestra is still struggling to keep performing due to lack of funds.  Honors  Minczuk was awarded the Lincoln Center's 2000 Martin E. Segal Award. In 2010 Minczuk was awarded the Order of Ipiranga, issued by the São Paulo state government, and the Brazilian Order of Cultural Merit in 2017.

Ison (October 8, 1916 – October 3, 2001) was the United States Marine Corps infantryman running crouched across \\"Death Valley\\", Okinawa in the iconic World War II photograph shot by photographer Bob Bailey, in which he is seen running across Death Valley dodging heavy machine gun fire during the Battle of Okinawa on May 10, 1945.  Biography  A Kentucky native born in 1916, Paul E. Ison was initially denied enlistment as he was a married father of four children. He assisted the war effort making shell casings at a factory in Cincinnati, Ohio. As the war raged on, restrictions gradually eased allowing him to enlist as a private in the Marine Corps at the age of 28. He completed basic training and was assigned to the Fifth Marine Regiment, First Marine Division bound for the war already being waged in the Pacific. By the spring of 1945, he was trained as a demolitionist/flamethrower aboard the USS McCracken heading for Okinawa, a small island located south of Japan in the Ryukyu Chain. In 1945, Okinawa grew in strategic importance for both sides. Situated less than 350 miles from mainland Japan, The Japanese had military airfields on the island and saw Okinawa as their last stronghold outside of Imperial Japan; the United States saw Okinawa as the final stepping stone in their island hopping campaign and final mustering point prior to an all out invasion of mainland Japan. It was the culminating point of the war in the Pacific and home to some of the fiercest fighting. On the morning of May 10th, eleven days after the 1st Marine Division entered the fray, Ison was part of a four man team with Lima Company, 3rd Battalion ordered to first go to the rear to pick up 96 pounds of dynamite, then take his team up to the line to set charges that would knock out defensive pillboxes and positions. In route to the objective area, he and his team would have to cross a draw located between two hills commanded by the Japanese known as \\"Death Valley\\". Upon arrival at the ammunition dump, the team was informed that the required explosives had already been prepositioned at the forward line. This meant they would not be further burdened with the additional weight of munitions for their harrowing traverse across the war torn valley. The team crossed successfully, one at a time, dodging heavy fire and incoming rounds to join the assault platoon on the other side. This was when a young photographer captured the photo of a single Marine Corps rifleman, who was Paul E. Ison, moving forward under fire with resolute determination. Upon arrival, his team learned that the explosives had not, in fact, been sent ahead. They quickly realized they would need to cross two more times in order to first return for the charges and then carry the satchels filled with TNT back across Death Valley. Miraculously, they all survived the deadly gauntlet three times and went on to successfully complete their mission. The Marines attacked and took the hill in eight grueling hours. After the war, Paul E. Ison first bought a pickup truck and started a hauling business. He later bought a tractor trailer and did cross country transport for the next twenty-nine years until January of 1981. He retired to Fort Myers, Florida where he remained active in the Marine Corps League, Marine Corps Historical Foundation, Marine Corps Association and First Marine Division Association until his death on October 3, 2001. The Marine Corps League - Detachment #60 of Lee County, Florida has since been designated the PFC Paul E. Ison Detachment. The Marine Corps adopted this photo as a symbol of the Marine Infantryman's willingness to advance under fire. It has been referred to as Combat Picture #120562 and has been widely used in the Press to illustrate the fortitude and tenacity of the front-line Marine.

She later took to the stage as actress Lillie Langtry, and became involved in a relationship with Edward, Prince of Wales. Langtry and his wife eventually separated and she obtained a divorce in 1897. Langtry died from a brain haemorrhage in the same year after a fall during a steamer crossing from Belfast to Liverpool. There have been numerous biographies about Lillie Langtry, (she also wrote her own autobiography) but little has been written about her first husband Edward (Ned) Langtry. What has been written often paints him in a negative light. He has been referred to as \\"a colourless sportsman\\"; \\"a pudgy chap, his weak mouth overhung with a walrus moustache, and his conversation powers were limited\\"; \\"petulantly determined on his own importance......he was weak and indolent and also, surprisingly shy\\"; \\"a meek, weak husband and no money\\";\\"uneasily complaisant husband\\". If these descriptions are accurate, it is difficult to understand why a woman as gifted as Lillie would marry a man with such shortcomings. In her memoirs The Days I Knew she explains that Edward Langtry was an extremely shy person, and had spent his life since leaving Oxford in outdoor country sports. In London he felt \\"quite like a fish out of water\\" and this may explain his difficulty in conversation and his lack of social grace, and possibly why so many people had such a poor opinion of him. In 1877 Edward and Lillie spent a month in the Perth area of Scotland as the guests of Effie and John Everett Millais. It was here that Edward was at his most relaxed, salmon fishing with Millias, and appeased with the absence of crowds. A vacation later described by Lillie as a \\"delightful month\\".Whilst staying in Scotland with the Millais' it is probable that the Langtry's met the family of Beatrix Potter. They spent the summer each year in the area (at Dalguise) and Rupert Potter was a salmon fishing companion of Millais. At this time, Beatrix would have been about eleven years old. Some conflicting information about Edward Langtry life originated in Lillie Langtry's memoirs. In this she claims that Edward's father started the steam ship crossings between Belfast and Scotland, whereas these were started by his grandfather, George Langtry. She also wrote that when they married he was about thirty years of age although he was actually twenty-six. Family background =Edward’s grandfather George Langtry= Langtry lived the life of a gentleman on the money that came from the mercantile and shipping business created by his grandfather, George Langtry (1764–1846). He had opened a general store in Belfast in about 1786 and later organised a shipping line between Belfast and England, both for cargo and passengers. The early crossings were under sail, but later steam powered ships were used and Langtry commissioned the first steam ship to be built in Ireland called Belfast. The mercantile business was initially named George Langtry & Co. and from about 1828 the shipping company became Langtrys & Herdman, under the management of William Herdman (1777–1855), plus two of George's sons - Robert and George Jr. In about 1810 George Sr. purchased a large house and grounds on the northern outskirts of Belfast called Fortwilliam. This remained the family home until about 1858 when the mansion and 161 acres were sold for housing development. Another large estate they held was Drumaderragh House, near Ballyclare, Co. Antrim. This was sold in about 1900 and is now the residence of Lord Glentoran. In 1794 George married Fanny Callwell (1772–1825) whose family had arrived in Ireland from Scotland at the beginning of the 17th century as part of the colonisation of Ulster. Her mother was Catherine Magee, sister of printer, publisher and Belfast book seller, James Magee (c. 1707–1797). Fanny was connected via the marriage of her siblings to several other families in Co. Antrim. One of her nephews was William Thompson the naturalist. Other slightly more distant relatives included politicians Hugh McCalmont and Harry McCalmont. =Edward’s parents= Edward Langtry was born in Co. Antrim, Ulster on 14 February 1847.His gravestone puts his date of birth as 14 February 1846 His mother was Eliza Ray (1825-1854) and his father Robert Langtry (1800–1855), who was the eldest son of George Langty Sr. When old enough, Robert entered the family mercantile and shipping business, but he also had outside interests in natural history, horticulture and yachting. He recorded observations from the environment and passed these on to his cousin, naturalist William Thompson, with any specimen he felt were of interest. Robert's brother Richard (1810-1858) also helped and many of their contributions were credited in Thompson's Natural History of Ireland vols. 1 to 4. Robert's love of gardening was reflected in horticultural society competitions he entered with his plants, cut flowers, vegetable and fruit, often getting first or second prizes. In 1848/49 changes occurred in the family business. George Sr. had died in 1846 and Robert's brother George Jr. died in 1849. Robert left the Belfast home and moved with his family to \\"a charming reed-thatched Regency pavilion\\" called Ardimersey Cottage on Islay, the southernmost island of the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. At the time of the move Robert and Eliza had two children, daughter Emily (1846–1896), and Edward. Two other children were later born in Scotland: Ida (1849–1919) who was born in Troon and Fanny (1850–1888) born on Islay; both girls were baptised on Islay. Islay was owned by Walter Frederick Campbell, but he became bankrupt and the management of the island was placed in the hands of John Ramsay, who was a distiller, merchant and politician. A buyer for the island was eventually found in 1853, who was wealthy businessman James Morrison. He had an agreement with Ramsay that he would sell a section of Islay to him including the cottage and land where the Langtry family were living. Some years later Ramsey made Ardimersey Cottage his home. This move of the Langtry family from Belfast to Islay coincided with the Irish Great Famine that devastated many parts of Ireland between 1845 and 1851. During this period the population of the country fell by nearly 20%, although the loss in Co. Antrim was slightly lower at 15%. Many of the malnourished people travelling to Belfast in search of shelter, food and employment were afflicted with diseases such as dysentery, relapsing fever and typhus. This led to a major outbreak of typus in Belfast and it was estimated that 1 in 5 people in the area became infected. In the summer of 1847 the number of deaths in Belfast public institutions were averaging between 70 and 80 per week. Many others died in their dwellings or were found dead on the streets. The burial grounds were filled to overflowing with graves being reused to within a few inches of the surface, leading to infestation from rodents. In 1849 Belfast suffered another epidemic, this time from cholera that led to the death of about 1300 people. In 1852 the Langtrys had a house guest staying with them on Islay at their Ardimersay Cottage (spellings vary). He was Nathaniel Alexander, the former member of parliament for County Antrim. According to newspaper reports of the time he had been suffering for two weeks with “water on the chest” but he was only 38 years of age so there was little concern for his health. However, on the 5 January 1853 he died in the cottage. Further tragedies followed; in September 1854 Robert's wife, Eliza, died on Islay and within 7 months Robert died in the Ardimersey Cottage. At the age of eight Edward Langtry, and his three sisters aged nine, six and five were orphaned. Their financial affairs came under the care of trustees and executors: Henry Fulton, William McEwen and their uncle, Richard Langtry. At the time of his death Robert Langtry owned numerous properties in Co. Antrim and Co. Down. Details of these were recorded in 1862 and 1864 in the Griffith's Valuation and can be viewed in summary on the AskAboutIreland.ie web site. Aftermath Any hope that the orphaned children would grow up with their uncle Richard's family at Fortwilliam came to an end when he died in October 1858 aged 48. He was the fourth son of George Langtry Sr. and within months of his death the Fortwilliam Mansion and estate was put up for sale by the fifth, and only surviving son, Charles Langtry. He had been in business with Richard, running the scheduled Belfast to Liverpool steamer line R & C Langtry. He transferred their two ships, Waterloo and Blenheim, to the Belfast Steamer Company in 1859 and in July 1862 he died in Drumaderragh House. The death of George Langtry's sons at such early ages created serious difficulties. Only one daughter appears to have lived much longer, she was Maria (Langtry) Waddell, the grandmother of botanist Coslett Herbert Waddell. The financial affairs of Eliza and Robert's four children remained in the control of the trustees until they had reached their age of majority. The 1861 census for Wonston, Hampshire (taken 7 April 1861) indicates that the children, Emily, Edward, Ida and Fanny were \\"boarders\\" in the rectory of Rev. Alexander Robert Charles Dallas (1791– 869). He had helped found the Society for Irish Church Missions to the Roman Catholics in 1849. There was also a governess boarding at the rectory named Blanch Brodie, 31 years of age and born in Wiltshire, England. She was the daughter of William Bird Brodie. The four children had been kept together as a \\"unit\\", but the reason for their move to Wonston, under the roof of Rev Dallas, is not clear. It is possible that they were being educated in a local establishment and there are mentions in the Winchester papers between 1862 and 1867 of an E. Langtry taking part in boys cricket matches for the local team of Sutton Scotney. When Edward Langtry reached his \\"majority\\" he took up residence in Hampshire, and this added substance to the idea that he had lived in the area for some time before. Yachting Edward Langtry's father had been a yachtsman, and his last yacht was the 34 ton, Queen of the Isles, placed on sale after his death in 1855 at Bowling Harbour on the Clyde, Glasgow. In 1868, when Edward Langtry reached the age of 21, he was in the position to purchase his own yacht, a sailing schooner called Red Gauntlet. The vessel was of 147 tons, about 100 ft in length and 19 ft in beam. Built by Inman of Lymington for George Powell Haughton and launched in 1862. The saloon was 18 ft by 15 ft, and a later description said that the yacht could take seven passengers with a crew of eight. The yacht had at least one additional owner before Langtry, he was J Nolan-Ferrall. Other yachts owned by Langtry at this time were Ildegonda, of 15 tons. and later a 60-ton yawl named Gertrude. Yacht Red Gauntlet owned by Edward \\"Ned\\" Langtry, first husband of actress Lillie (le Breton) Langtry Langtry made extensive use of the Red Gauntlet, starting in 1868 by sailing to Dartmouth for the Royal Regatta and then to Dublin. He married in March of the following year to Jane Frances Price; in May the newly weds sailed to the Isle of Man and then on to Islay. From there to Oban and through the Caledonian Canal heading to Norway; by August they were back at the Dartmouth Royal Regatta. In October the Langtrys and Red Gauntlet were reported as being in St Peter-Port, Guernsey, returning to Jersey. March 1870 the Red Gauntlet with the Langtry family were reported as being in Malta having returned for Syracuse. From that period and into 1871 Edward was involved with domestic regattas racing both Red Gauntlet and Ildegonda. In September Langtry sailed for Jersey, where in October his wife Jane died at the home of her parents, aged just 21. During 1872 the yachting press periodically reported that Langtry was taking part in domestic regattas in Ildegonda and in a cutter named Satellite. In December 1872, when most yachts would have been laid up for the season, the yachting correspondent for Bell's Life in London reported that Langtry and Red Gauntlet were heading for St Petersburg, but if the port was closed he would over-winter in Holland for the shooting. In 1873 Langtry was associated with another small yacht (18 tons) called Marguerite and it was reported that Ildegonda had been sold to a Mr Gordon. On 9 March 1874, Langtry married Emilie Charlotte Le Breton in Jersey. She became known as actress Lillie Langtry and wrote a book about her life in which she said that her family insisted Edward Langtry must cut back on his expenditure. This included his yachting activities, and the lack of any mention of his name in the yachting press after 1874 does indicate that he complied. The Red Gauntlet was sold to B C Greenhill of Knowle Hall, Bridgewater, in April 1874, less than one month after the couple had married. The yawl Gertrude remained in the ownership of Langtry for the 1874 sailing season. Jane Frances Price Edward Langtry's first wife was Jane Frances Price (1850–1871). They married in St Helier, Jersey, on the 10 March 1869; she was 18 and he was 22 years of age. Her parents, Elizabeth Pratt Lepper (1822–1902) and Francis Price (1804–1894), were residents of Jersey but both had been born in Ireland, she in Co. Antrim and he in Co. Down. Coming from the Belfast area, they would have been aware of the Langtry family background in mercantile and shipping. Before he retired, Francis Price worked as a civil servant in Ceylon (Sri Lanka), and like Edward Langtry's father had an interest in natural history. Both contributed specimens to the Natural History and Philosophical Society in Belfast and it seem likely that they were acquainted. On the 18 November 1873 Jane's younger sister, Elizabeth Anne Price (1855–1940), married William Inglis Le Breton (1845–1924), brother of Emilie Charlotte Le Breton (1853–1929). He was an army officer attached to the Indian Staff Corps, Public Works Department, Bombay (Mumbai), described as a comptroller, dealing with financial and compliance matters. He had returned to Britain from India in 1873 to marry, but it seems that Elizabeth Anne Price was not his first choice of bride. In June and July 1873, banns of marriage were read in St Mary's Church, Battersea announcing the forthcoming marriage of William Inglis Le Breton to Martha Mary Elizabeth Pickering.Source Citation: London Metropolitan Archives; London, England; Reference Number: P70/MRY2/096; Source Information: Ancestry.com. London, England, Church of England Marriages and Banns, 1754-1932 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. She was the daughter of railway engineer Edward Pickering, who was living in Jersey with his family whilst he constructed the Jersey Railway from St Aubin to St Catherine's. Edward Pickering was from a family of engineers, who with his brothers had constructed railways in various parts of the world, including South America and South Africa. His sister was Alice Tredwell, who had managed the construction of a section of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway in an area of India where William Inglis Le Breton was stationed. Unfortunately for Martha and William, just as their banns were being read her father was declared bankrupt and their wedding was cancelled. Emilie Charlotte Le Breton Langtry married Emilie Charlotte Le Breton on Jersey on the 9 March 1874. Her father, William Corbet Le Breton (1815–1888), was the Dean of Jersey and it was he who performed the ceremony. The couple first met at a ball organised by Edward Langtry - only about 5 months before they got married. Emilie had been nicknamed Lillie since she was young on account of her skin being \\"unusually white\\" and she was in future referred to as Lillie Langtry (or Lily). At first Edward and Lillie spent time in Jersey and Southampton. The first year of marriage was made busy with attendance at regattas in their yacht Gertrude. Lillie remarked that this could be dull in the extreme when becalmed. In Southampton she became seriously ill with typhoid and was nursed back to health by Edward. A change of air was recommended and the couple moved to London. In 1876, through a family connection, they were invited to an afternoon tea at Lord Ranelagh's and later an evening party at Lady Sebright's. It was there that her looks and personality attracted attention and led to further invitations and a meeting with Edward, Prince of Wales. Lillie was also asked to sit for portraits, including one by John Everett Millais. Her relationship with the Prince developed and attracted the attention of the gossip columnists. This eventually led to a libel court case in 1879 after Adolphus Rosenberg, claimed in Town Talk that Edward Langtry had petitioned for divorce, naming H.R.H. the Prince of Wales, Lord Lonsdale and Lord Londesborough as the co-respondents. The article also claimed that to stop the divorce action, arrangements were made to appoint Edward Langtry to a diplomatic post abroad. Rosenberg pleaded guilty to publishing the libels, but not to knowing them to be false. Edward Langtry was called as a witness and denied the claims made in the article. He said that he had always lived on terms of affection with his wife. The case went against Rosenberg and he was sentenced to serve 18 months in prison. Oddly, when this trial had first gone to court, it was not about the Langtry libel, but involved unrelated articles published by Rosenburg involving Mrs Cornwallis-West. The solicitor acting for the Prince of Wales, George Lewis, orchestrated events so that Rosenberg also faced the charge of false and defamatory libel related to the Langtry article. The appearance in court of the extremely shy Edward Langtry as a witness must have been a very uncomfortable experience, and he probably felt resentment for being placed in such a position. The Langtry's started to spend freely and were living on credit. When Lillie fell out of favour with the Prince of Wales the creditors started to demand payment and bankruptcy loomed. Edward's income came from Irish properties left to him by his father. These included land in Parkgate, Co. Antrim, of about 340 acres. Although the value of the land had risen over time, the rents had not and some of the tenant demands for repairs to property were actually costing Langtry money. He visited the area to take personal control of the situation but returned to London having apparently come off worse in the negotiations with his tenants. Up to this time Edward had handled money matters for the two of them, but these setbacks made Lillie determined to have more control of her destiny. In 1880 Lillie discovered that she had become pregnant after a relationship with another man. She knew Edward would realise the child was not his, so a subterfuge was devised to get him out of the country while she travelled to France to have the child in secret. To achieve this he was commissioned to inspect and value some property in America belonging to Adelaide Neilson. He left England for America in December 1880 but completed the work early. A series of telegrams and letters were then sent to him from England to delay his return until he eventually got back in April 1881. Lillie had a baby girl 8 March 1881, named Jeanne Marie, who was taken to Jersey to be looked after by Lillie's mother. Edward claimed in a letter published in 1897 that he knew nothing of the birth of this child. The marriage between Edward and Lillie was now in trouble; they argued, she was seeing another man and he was drinking too much. After 7 years of marriage they parted and Lillie began her acting career. Final years =Divorce= After they parted, Edward Langtry slipped into obscurity, and was only occasionally mentioned in the press. He spent about ten years in Holyhead on Anglesey where he kept his links with water sporting activities, fishing and sailing. The 1891 census recorded him living at Cellar Farm, Aberffraw, Anglesey, Wales. One story in the newspapers said that he sometimes crewed for the local lifeboat as an oarsman. From about 1893 until his death he was living in Southampton, Hampshire, in an apartment at 9 Queen's Terrace, run by Ellen and Cornelius Collins. This address is located a short distance from the docks and the ocean liner terminal. On 13 May 1897 Lillie Langtry obtained a divorce from Edward in the county court of Lakeport, California. This was her third attempt and Edward had always resisted saying that \\"she shall never untie the knot that her father tied at the altar\\". However, on this occasion the judge, Richard W Crump (1828-1903), decided that the summons had been duly served on Edward Langtry, and because he had failed to answer he was in default. When told of the judge's decision, Edward responded by saying that if she tried to remarry in Britain she would be committing bigamy. After parting with Edward in the 1880s, Lillie Langtry became a successful and famous actress. She had long-term relationships with other men, but was never able to remarry due to Edward's refusal to give her a divorce. Two years after his death she married 28-year-old Hugo Gerald de Bathe (1871–1940) and following the death of Hugo's father in 1907 she became Lady de Bathe. =Death= Edward's death occurred in 1897 following a crossing over the Irish Sea on a passenger ship, where he fell and sustained head injuries. He was travelling with a friend called Arthur Robinson Greenwood, whose address was given as Abbey Mill, in Bishop's Waltham, Hampshire. After treatment he seemed able to continue his journey back to England, and Greenwood who was scheduled to go to Scotland, telegraphed Cornelius Collins and asked him meet Langtry on route to ensure he got home safely. However, there was confusion and Collins could not locate Langtry in Belfast, or at his next scheduled stop on the homeward train journey at Crewe. Langtry was travelling alone, head bandaged, apparent still bleeding and had become deranged. He tried to book in at a hotel but the staff found him too disruptive and took him to the railway station. He was later found asleep in a pile of straw and it was claimed he smelt of drink, and had just a few pennies in his pockets. The police asked the courts to commit him to an asylum and he was admitted on the 4 October to Chester Asylum where he died on the 15 October 1897. Cornelius Collins attended the inquest, held for Edward Langtry at the Chester Asylum, where he identified the body. He gave evidence and said that Langtry had money on him when he left Southampton, having just received a cheque for £25 from the solicitor, George Lewis. This was a payment made to him every three months by Lewis on behalf of Lillie Langtry. Greenwood, who was a 38 year old corn miller born in the Burnley area, had not attended the first inquest and the coroner adjourned until he could be summoned to give evidence. When he appeared he corroborated the evidence given by Collins, adding that Langtry had appeared despondent for several months following Lillie Langtry's American divorce. On the journey to Belfast he said that Edward was not well, could not eat and when he tried felt sick. He had not been with him when he fell, but he heard the noise and with the steward, found Edward bleeding profusely from a head wound. The steward administered first-aid and bandaged the wound, and when the ship docked Greenwood went with Langtry to the hospital. Edward Langtry is buried in Overleigh Cemetery, Chester, Cheshire. Various rumours at the time of Edward's death circulated, included that he had either committed suicide or had been murdered by thugs hired by Lillie. One newspaper report even quoted a policeman who was supposed to have heard Edward say that he had been attacked. However, the policeman later denied having said this. Another unsubstantiated account was that since his separation from Lillie he followed her but never approached, instead asking railway porters about how she looked and how she was dressed. He responded to some of the rumours and allegations in a letter published a few months before his death in the New York Journal. =Irish property= In 1928 tenanted properties in Northern Ireland were compulsorily purchased under the Northern Ireland Land Act, 1925. This was passed after the Partition of Ireland, with the purpose of transferring certain lands from owners to tenants, the owners being compensated with the purchase price or bond. Lillie made claim to those lands connected to Edward Langtry's estate, stating that she (widow) was his representative. This was connected with a clause in Edward Langtry's will made when he married Lillie, gifting his Irish properties to her should he die. =Family= Of Edward's sisters: the eldest, Emily remained unmarried and died in Devon. Indications from census records are that she lived with her sister, Fanny, and her husband, George Langtry (1851-1889), who was her cousin being the son of Richard Langtry. The last sister, Ida, married a doctor from the Isle of Wight named Alfred Hollis (1846-1915) and these last two were the only members of Edward's family at his funeral. Note: Dr Alfred Hollis was in attendance on Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who had a house on the Isle of Wight. =End of Red Gauntlet= The schooner, Red Gauntlet, was taken to Australia in 1880 on a world cruise by its then owner, Cecil Charles Balfour, brother of politician Arthur Balfour. Whilst there Cecil was killed in a riding accident and the Gauntlet was sold to an Australian owner. In 1887 the vessel was lost after grounding on a reef.

He was a pioneer in using fossil forams to sequence marine sedimentary deposits by their relative dates; Based on a study by Gian Battista Vai, ordinario (British English: lecturer; American English: professor) at the University of Bologna, and Director of the Museo Geologico Giovanni Capellini. a technique called biostratigraphy. Biography He was the third son of Francesco Fornasini, a medical doctor, and his wife Carlotta (). He studied natural sciences at the University of Bologna, under the guidance of Giovanni Capellini (1833-1922), the Professor of Geology there. In 1877, he graduated with honours as dottore (in effect, PhD), on the basis of a thesis which argued from the sequence of the fossil record that certain chalks, marls and clays in the Savena valley near Bologna dated from the Pliocene (5.3-2.6 Ma) rather than, as had previously been thought (including by Capellini), from the Miocene (23.0-5.3 Ma). That same year, Capellini published a paper about this discovery which relegated Fornasini's contribution to that of an assistant and which passed off Fornasini's conclusions as his own. That sort of behaviour has become unacceptable. In 1928, (1883-1966), who had succeeded Capellini as Professor of Geology, wrote that \\"the Master had deprived his most promising student, Carlo Fornasini, of the pleasure and pride of announcing his discovery [...] and the results of his studies\\" (). Furthermore, Capellini may not have properly understood Fornasini's ideas. This affair may explain why Fornasini published nothing for the next four years. In 1881, Fornasini returned to palaeontology, possibly persuaded by his friend Lodovico Foresti (1829-1913, assistente (assistant) at the Museo Geologico in Bologna). In September and October 1881, he helped to organise, and he attended, the 2nd International Geological Congress in Bologna, which settled important international questions of nomenclature, standardisation and cooperation. When the was founded in Bologna during the Congress, under the leadership of Giuseppe Meneghini (1811-1889) and Capellini, he was one of the original members. He remained a member until at least 1922, and between 1883 and 1903 served several times as deputy secretary and as a member of its council. In 1883, he was appointed cavaliere (knight) in the Order of the Crown of Italy. In 1884, he became a corresponding member of the Reale Accademia del Poggio (nowadays, '), Montevarchi. In 1885, he was one of the secretaries at the 3rd International Congress in Berlin; and in 1888, also at the 4th International Congress in London. In 1889, he was made an honorary member of the Reale Accademia delle scienze dell'Istituto di Bologna. From 1894 until 1910, he was an amministratore (director) of the Accademia in Bologna. In 1895, he was appointed assistente at the Museo Geologico, and in 1903 its conservatore (curator). In 1895, Fornasani and Vittorio Simonelli (1860-1929) founded the journal Rivista italiana di paleontologia ('Italian Review of Palaeontology'). Fornasini was no longer one of the principal editors after 1896, but he is named on the title page as a collaboratore (collaborator, or co-worker, or contributing editor) until 1904. In 1900 he joined the of Acireale, Sicily as a corresponding member. Poor health forced him to give up his scientific work by 1911. He nevertheless maintained an interest in his speciality, and donated his library and his collection of specimens to the Museo Geologico. He married Emilia Erhardt (at a date not determined), and they had two children: Carlo Francesco, a son, and Elsa, a daughter. He was mayor of Poggio Renatico, a comune (municipality) about northeast of Bologna, for almost 30 years. In 1902, he donated to Poggio Renatico the land on which the church of San Michele (Saint Michael) now stands. He is commemorated by a bronze plaque in the Museo Geologico. Scientific work His main interest was always Foraminifera, on which he became a world authority. He worked mostly as an amateur scientist, independent of academic institutions. He published chiefly in the journals (dates of earliest and latest papers in parentheses) Bollettino della Società geologica italiana (1883-1905), Memorie della Reale Accademia delle Scienze dell'Istituto di Bologna (1889-1908), and Rivista italiana di paleontologia (1896-1903). He published more than sixty papers in those journals. They include a series of ten papers in Memorie entitled \\"Contributo alla conoscenza della Microfauna terziaria Italiana\\" ('Contribution to the Knowledge of Italian Microfauna of the Tertiary') (1889-1899), in which he attempted a critical analysis of all available information on the subject. That included identifying synonymy, where two or more scientists had unknowingly described the same species as new to science; an area of study as important in the advancement of taxonomy as the description of new species. The WoRMS database lists 78 species of Foraminifera described by him, all between 1883 and 1902. Some of those species have been reclassified into other genera. That is a commonplace occurrence in biology, if a later researcher either revises a genus, or describes a new genus and moves that species into it. However, the fact that Fornasini is still credited as taxonomic authority for 77 of those 78 species shows that he was a careful, accurate and knowledgeable observer. Taxa named in honour The WoRMS database lists 18 species of Foraminifera whose specific epithet includes 'fornasini', all described between 1893 and 1948. They were most likely named in honour of Carlo Fornasini, but it would be necessary to consult the original descriptions to be certain. Fondazione Dott. Carlo Fornasini In 1964, his son Carlo Francesco donated land and money in his will to set up in his father's memory the Fondazione Dott. Carlo Fornasini at Poggio Renatico. Its original aim was to encourage research into human organ transplantation, later expanded to the more general topic of social and human sciences, with particular regard to ethics and bioethics.

Franco co-wrote the screenplay with Joe Swanberg, based on a story by the pair and Mike Demski. It stars Dan Stevens, Alison Brie, Sheila Vand, Jeremy Allen White, and Toby Huss, and follows two couples who begin to suspect they are being watched in the house they rented. The film was released on video-on-demand and in select theaters in the United States on July 24, 2020, by IFC Films. It received generally positive reviews from critics, and became the second film to ever top VOD charts and the box office in the same weekend. Plot Charlie, his wife Michelle, his brother Josh, and his business partner Mina (who is also Josh's girlfriend) rent an seaside house for a weekend getaway. Upon arriving at the remote property, the group meets the property caretaker Taylor, who acts oddly and makes comments to Mina that appear to be racially motivated. After Taylor leaves, Mina, Josh, and Charlie get high and Michelle goes to bed. Josh passes out on a couch, and Mina and Charlie have sex in the shower. The next morning, a hungover Mina and Charlie agree they can never be intimate again, while Josh mentions to Michelle that Charlie has cheated on several former girlfriends, making Michelle doubt Charlie. Mina discovers a minicamera in the showerhead and alerts Charlie. The two are confident that Taylor has installed the cameras and filmed them. Charlie stops her from alerting the police, reasoning that doing so would mean that in the police inquiry, Michelle and Josh would see the footage of them having sex. They decide instead to leave the next morning. That night, Michelle gets high and calls Taylor to fix the hot tub. Mina privately confronts Taylor about the hidden cameras, which he claims to be unaware of. He attempts to call the police himself; Mina tries to stop him. Josh rushes in and, assuming Taylor is attacking her, beats him unconscious. Mina tells everyone about the hidden camera in the shower. Meanwhile, a masked man sneaks inside and smothers Taylor to death. When the others return and find Taylor dead, they assume that Josh has accidentally killed him. A frantic Michelle demands they call the police, but Charlie refuses to let his brother go to jail, and says they should stage Taylor's death as an accident by throwing him off the cliff into the ocean. Despondent at her husband's coldness, Michelle stays behind while the others carry Taylor's body to the cliff. The body falls onto an outcrop, forcing Josh to go down and push it into the sea. Michelle is lured to a television that shows footage of Mina and Charlie having sex the night before. When the other three return, they find her leaving; Charlie tries to stop her, and she tells him she saw the film and leaves. Down the road, she drives over a spike strip and crashes into a tree. Charlie gets a text from Michelle's phone and goes to search for her. He finds her dead body in the road and is then ambushed and murdered by the masked man. Back at the rental, Mina and Josh are looking for the shower camera's transceiver to destroy any footage it recorded. Josh receives messages from Charlie's phone that confirm Charlie and Mina had sex. Josh hears someone enter the house and rushes to confront the person, assuming it is Charlie. Instead, the masked man ambushes and kills Josh. Mina flees outside, pursued by the masked man. Mina falls off the cliff and into the ocean. The masked man returns to the house, removing all evidence and surveillance equipment. He rents a new property and installs cameras into it. Oblivious new inhabitants rent the location, and the masked man attacks a sleeping couple.

Writing for the Chicago Sun-Times, Richard Roeper gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, saying: \\"The Rental would have worked purely as a compelling character study about four dysfunctional adults unraveling over the course of a long weekend — but when the presence of a homicidal maniac is introduced to the proceedings, the transition to horror film is brilliant and wacky and pretty darn great.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety said the film had \\"tense flavor and skill\\" and wrote: \\"There's some crafty artistry at work in The Rental, and also some fairly standard pandering, which feels like a violation of the movie's better instincts. That said, most of it is skillful and engrossing enough to establish Franco as a director to watch.\\"  Possible sequel  Franco has voiced his interest in a sequel, saying: \\"It was the intention from the beginning to leave the ending ambiguous enough that we carry on the story if given a chance...

Seed cycling is the rotation of different edible seeds into the diet at different times in the menstrual cycle. Practitioners believe that since some seeds promote estrogen production, and others promote progesterone production, that eating these seeds in the correct parts of the menstrual cycle will balance the hormonal rhythm. There is no scientific evidence to support the belief that cycling the seeds actually regulates the hormonal rhythm, but the practice is probably harmless. Overview Four phases of women's menstrual cycleSeed cycling advocates note that the menstrual cycle is broken up into four interconnected phases. The first phase is menstruation, followed by the follicular phase, then ovulation, then the luteal phase. Assuming a 28-day cycle, the first 13 days represent the menstrual and follicular phases, in which day 1 is when menstruation begins. During day-13, the seed cycling diet suggests consuming either flax or pumpkin seeds daily to boost estrogen, which helps support these phases and the move towards ovulation. Days 14-28 represent the ovulatory phase and luteal phase, with ovulation around day 14. The seed cycling diet suggests sesame or sunflower seeds to boost progesterone at this time, ground up to increase the surface area for absorption of the essential fatty acids, minerals, and other nutrients. The seed cycling diet relies on the belief that most women have a 28-day cycle. However, only 10-15% of women have 28-30 day cycles; most women's cycles vary, or run longer or shorter. For women with irregular or absent cycle, menopause, or post-menopause, the seed cycling diet suggests starting the seed cycle with any two weeks, and then rotating.  Research  There is currently a lack of solid scientific evidence that supports seed rotating between the phases of the menstrual cycle or the Moon directly impacts hormonal disorders. The proposed benefits are mostly due to anecdotal reports. Seed cycling claims are indirect effects on the women's hormonal cycles, PMS and, menopausal symptoms. However, there is research showing the direct benefits of the nutritional components present in the individual seeds, flax, pumpkin, sesame and sunflower seeds, in promoting hormonal balance. For example, flax seeds seem to be the most researched and beneficial. In a study, women taking one tablespoon of flax seed meal daily were able to lengthen their luteal phase, which resulted in fewer months without any ovulation. Flax seed has an effect on the luteal phase progesterone-estradiol ratio. Another theory for rotating the seeds, rather than consuming all four at once, is the different mineral content that might support the follicular or luteal phases. For example, during the follicular phase, there is an increase in calcium, whereas there is an increase in magnesium during the luteal phase. Reception Seed cycling has been greeted sceptically by the press, with headlines like \\"Can 'seed cycling' really help to balance your hormones?\\" (The Telegraph) and \\"Can Eating Seeds Balance Your Hormones?\\" (New York magazine's The Cut blog). It has been called an obsession by Good Housekeeping. The Cut quotes dietitian Abby Langer as stating that food is not medicine, but that seed cycling might be \\"a worthwhile component of a treatment plan\\" for a hormonal imbalance, warning that seed cycling recipes using primrose oil could interact dangerously with anticoagulants and anaesthetics. Shape magazine notes that the seeds could possibly help regulate hormones, given their phytoestrogen content, but quotes Melinda Ring of the Osher Center for Integrative Medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago as stating that evidence is lacking, that the outcomes are unpredictable, and that she has seen women whose cycles became \\"more irregular\\" after taking phytoestrogens.

Background Amadeus was born into the wealthy and powerful gens (clan) Pok, which possessed large-scale landholdings in Győr County, but his parentage is unknown. He was a contemporary to his distant relative, Maurice II. He was a \\"frater\\" (close relative) of Deta and comes John, and he also had two nephews, Paul and Peter, both entered ecclesiastical service and were archdeacons of Sopron. Amadeus attended the University of Bologna and obtained the terminal degree of doctor of canon law. Returning to Hungary, he served as provost of the collegiate chapter of Vasvár from 1248 to 1254, a royal church, which also functioned as a place of authentication. Bishop of Győr After a two-year period of vacancy, Amadeus was elected Bishop of Győr by the cathedral chapter in the spring of 1254. He was a confidant of Béla IV of Hungary, who petitioned to the Roman Curia in order to confirm his election by Pope Innocent IV. In his letter, King Béla IV referred to his conflict and the tense relationship with Ottokar II of Bohemia, which caused the permanent hostile raids at the western boundaries between Hungary and Austria. Due to his family background and wealth, Amadeus was able to protect his chapter, then diocese in the region, similarly to his predecessor, Artolf. The parish church of Ják, consecrated by Amadeus Pok in 1256 The Peace of Pressburg, which was signed on 1 May 1254 and ceded Styria to Hungary, ended the war situation in the region, which lasted more than a decade, thus Amadeus could start his episcopate under calm and relatively peaceful conditions. In the territory of his diocese and the northwestern part of Transdanubia, Amadeus took part in that process, when Béla IV set up special commissions which revised all royal charters of land grants made after 1196. During the implementation of Béla's land reform in the first half of the 1250s, Amadeus frequently acted as co-judge in various lawsuits and border determinations in his diocese, alongside secular barons and his deputy, the archdeacon of Rábaköz. During his activity, Amadeus recovered several landholdings and estates for the Crown. He restored law and administration in the region, which had collapsed after the Mongol invasion and the subsequent Austrian and Bohemian raids. For his advice, Béla IV settled the customs and port duties in Győr and the surrounding area (for instance, Abda and Füzitő), and restored the right to hold markets to Széplak, which was owned by the gens Osl. Amadeus consecrated the parish church of Ják in 1256, today the most complete Romanesque cathedral in Hungary. The internal peace had broken, when the Styrian noblemen rose up in rebellion against the Hungarian rule in 1258, which caused a war between Béla and Ottokar until 1260. In June 1254, Amadeus filed a lawsuit against the burghers of Sopron over the property right of port duties in Fertőrákos at Lake Fertő (Neusiedl). During the dispute, he even excommunicated the magistrates of the town and placed Sopron under interdict. The litigants were summoned to the judicial court of Béla IV, who judged in favor of the diocese. Thereafter bailiff (royal commissioner) Herbord Osl and a delegate of the Pannonhalma Abbey were sent to draft the custom borders in the region. Amadeus adopted new regulations to the cathedral chapter of Győr and smoothed the contrasts between the canons and the lower clergy. He started to reconstruct his episcopal seat, the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption of Our Lady, which has been severely damaged during the Mongol invasion. It is plausible the cathedral was redesigned to Romanesque architectural style during his bishopric too. He also permitted the rebuilding of the parish church of Lébény, which was destroyed by Ottokar's troops in the early 1250s. Amadeus attended the national synods in Esztergom (1256) and Buda (1263). Amadeus distanced himself in the conflict between Béla IV and his son Duke Stephen in the 1260s, and did not interfere in secular affairs nor hold dignity in the royal court. He was last mentioned as a living person in August 1267. He died by April 1268, when his successor Farkas Bejc already appeared as bishop-elect.

Life Drysdale was born in Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin in 1912. Her father was a Professor at Trinity College Dublin and a surgeon and she would have been a doctor too but her father died suddenly and finances were not available to go to medical school. Instead Drysdale decided to learn German and become a librarian. She went to stay in Austria. Drysdale was interested in books and she read Sigmund Freud with some interest. In 1935 she found that she had a natural talent for child psychology as she worked at a playgroup. Her skills enabled her to control children without having to resort to punishments such as ignoring or excluding them. Because of her work with troubled children during the Second World War and despite her lack of qualifications, she was encouraged by the Home Office and the Ministry of Education to start a special school. She started the Mulberry Bush School as an independent residential special school in Standlake in Oxfordshire. The school looks after children aged 5 to 12 years. She took qualifications in psychotherapy at the Tavistock Clinic and at Maudsley Hospital in London. She was mixing with leading figures like the Austrian Melanie Klein, Anna Freud and Leila Rendel. The latter had already started a similar facility for disturbed children called the Caldecott Community in 1911. Her mentor was the pediatric psychiatrist Donald Winnicott. She was regarded as an expert in this area and spoke about the problem of children who through mistreatment had lost the ability to feel. What she called the \\"frozen child\\". She and her husband became co-principals in the school. They both stood down from this position in 1962 although Barbara was still an adviser until 1975. She went on to work with the former \\"Cotswold Community\\" children's home at Ashton Keynes. Drysdale died in Fairford and she was buried in the local church.

Design and development  The project began in 1977 when a group of engineers from the IPN reconstructed a Piper PA-18, after several discussions it was decided that it was better to design an own aircraft which was initially called Project CIAAC 7701. The design and calculation works were done under the name of TONATIUH Project in the offices of the General Directorate of Repairs and Naval Construction. Engineer César Trujillo was appointed by the Secretariat of the Navy to advice on the construction of the first prototype, beginning work in 1978 at the Aeronaval Station of the Mexico City International Airport. The Tonatiuh MX-1 bases its design almost entirely on the Bárcenas B-01 agricultural aircraft, since it shares components and design such as the wing profile, beams, ribs and tensioners with this aircraft. The wing section was designed for the needs of the Tonatiuh and many of the metal components were manufactured by the company CUPRUM, who also made components for the Bárcenas B-01. The first prototype was ready in April 1980 and once it was built, it was disarmed and sent to the Veracruz Air Base, where it was rebuilt and prepared for its first flight. During the first flight tests there were problems with the tail skate and the control surfaces of the rudder and the ailerons, so all these systems were redesigned, all in order to start their first flight on June 1, 1980 , on the day of the Navy. On his first flight, he made low-altitude maneuvers near the Malecón de Veracruz, in conjunction with the Tonatiuh, other Bonanza and Albatross aircraft performed acrobatics in the sea and near many ships. The development of the plane cost only 2 million pesos in the late 70's (about $80,700 at that time, about $290,000 today), which is said to have been a success because developing a light aircraft with similar characteristics in the United States would have cost 21 times more, in addition they had to create in Mexico the necessary tools for its construction. The Tonatiuh MX-1 was also 35% cheaper than its foreign competitor, the Piper PA-18.

Meetings are held as needed to coordinate activities and bring members up to speed on current/expected developments. Activities Crabby Against Drilling Booth-Earth Day 2019 The group’s efforts are currently focused on Brunswick Country ocean front communities (Southport, Bald Head Island, Caswell Beach. Oak Island, Holden Beach, Ocean Isle and Sunset Beach) with a goal to have these municipalities pass resolutions opposing both seismic testing and offshore drilling and also join in as amici curiae to a law suit filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center and various other entities in South Carolina to prevent the BOEM from approving seismic testing. Concurrent with this activity, efforts to educate the citizenry about seismic testing and offshore drilling include manning an information booth at the annual Earth Day event and sponsoring a film screening that same month at the Oak Recreation Center focused on off-shore drilling concerns . In May 2019 the group supported the \\"Hands Across The Sand\\" event with a \\"get out the crowd\\" appeal.

It was manufactured between 1979 and 1980 by VEB Halbleiterwerk Frankfurt (Oder) and is credited the only video game console that was released in East Germany. Due to its high price, it rarely succeeded in private households and mostly delivered to youth centers, leisure and educational institutions. The console spawned various versions depending on the material stock. A successor was planned, but not released.  History  In the 1980s, video games in East Germany were to introduce children and young people to technology and show that the GDR was a progressive country. The BSS 01 was manufactured between 1980 and 1984 by the to the Kombinat Mikroelektronik Erfurt belonging VEB Halbleiterwerk Frankfurt (Oder) as a part of the Konsumgüterproduktion. The basis for this was the Pong integrated circuit AY-3-8500-7, imported by American company General Instrument from the Nichtsozialistisches Wirtschaftsgebiet (NSW). The word BSS 01 is derived from the German word Bildschirmspiel 01, meaning Screen Game 01 or Video Screen Game 01. The console is also known as TV-Spiel or RFT TV-Spiel. RFT stands for Rundfunk- und Fernmelde-Technik which is a manufacturers' association of various telecommunication companies in East Germany. It is the only video game console ever released in East Germany and was sold from 1980 or 1981 to 1984 for 500, 550 or 620 East German marks (this is about half of an average monthly income in East Germany at that time). It was mostly delivered to youth centers, leisure and educational institutions, where they were set up for free play. According to a 1984 catalog, the price of the console dropped to 330 East German marks in 1984. The BSS 01 sold about 1,000 times in its first production series,robotron-net.de/images/sonst/BSS-01.pdf about 800 units of them are black and about 200 units are white. There were no more production series. In the ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe, you can play on an old chair in the style of the 1980s on a tube TV with the BSS 01. = Versions = A BSS 01 with black housing, black paddles, and orange buttons There are different colored versions of the BSS 01. Depending on the current material stock, the plastic colors of the console could differ slightly from each other, for example, in the housing color (white or black), the paddles (white, gray or black) or used on the right buttons (orange, red, yellow or black). However, the buttons on the left side are always black and the on/off switch on the top right is always red. = Successor = A successor of the BSS 01 named BSS 02, probably with color output instead of black-and-white, was planned, but then discarded for the production of radio clocks. Whether prototypes, sketches etc. of the BSS 02 exist is unknown.  Technical specifications  The BSS 01 has a width of 32.5 cm, a height of 5.5 cm, a depth of 17.5 cm and a mass of 1.3 or 1.5 kg. It is based on the AY-3-8500-7 chipset from General Instrument. The sound is played through an internal mono speaker (model ARZ 090), rather than the TV set. The output was black-and- white via the TV's RF port on channel 3 (VHF). Power was supplied to the BSS 01 via a power cord with 220 V, 2 W and 75 Ohm. There are two columns of mechanical buttons on the console, with which you can make various game settings such as deflection angle, ball speed, club size, ball throw and zero position (right column), the console can be switched on and off and the games can be selected (left column). = Games = Due to the integrated AY-3-8500 chipset from General Instrument, the BSS 01 is able to play the following four games: * Tennis (Pong clone) * Fußball (association football) * Squash * Pelota * two unnamed shooting games The first three games can only be played with two players, a computer opponent is not available because the BSS 01 has no CPU built in. The game Pelota is designed for one player. The two shooting games can only be played with a lightgun that was never officially availablr for the BSS 01. By intervening in the hardware, it is possible to connect such a lightgun to the BSS 01, which unlocks the two games. If none of the game selection buttons is pressed when the power is off and the console is then switched on, the activated, but often hidden, handicapped version of soccer, which is included in the AY-3-8500-7 chip, is activated, in which the right player directly hits another racket right striker, which makes the game more difficult for the left player. The throw-in of the ball could be set to automatic or manual. After the first player reaches 15 points, each of the games was over.

The ANC is led by Cyril Ramaphosa, who was elected to a five-year term as President of the African National Congress, beating his rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, by a narrow margin. David Mabuza was elected as Deputy President of the ANC, succeeding Ramaphosa. National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete, former Mpumalanga Premier Mathews Phosa, ANC Treasurer General Zweli Mkhize, and Human Settlements Ministers Lindiwe Sisulu were all candidates for the position of ANC President, but later all withdrew. On 14 February 2018, Zuma resigned as President of South Africa, leading Ramaphosa, as Deputy President, to succeed him as acting president and serve out the remainder of Zuma's term. Ramaphosa was elected president on 15 February 2018. Ramaphosa thus ran for a full term in office as president. The party lost many municipalities and support in the 2016 municipal elections, including the mayoralty and majority in councils such as Nelson Mandela Bay, Tshwane and Johannesburg. The party had to form coalitions to retain control of the City of Ekurhuleni and many other municipalities. They have gained back control in many municipalities through motions of no-confidence. Although the party ousted the Democratic Alliance Mayor, Athol Trollip, in Nelson Mandela Bay, the current Mayor of the municipality is from the United Democratic Movement. When David Mabuza resigned as Premier of Mpumalanga to become Deputy President of South Africa, MEC for Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Refilwe Mtsweni-Tsipane was appointed to fill his position. She was officially inaugurated on 20 March 2018. Free State Premier Ace Magashule was elected Secretary-General of the party at its 54th Elective Conference in December 2018. He stepped down in March 2018 and was succeeded by MEC for Human Settlements Sisi Ntombela. In April 2018, violent protests started in the North West calling for Supra Mahumapelo's resignation.

At the party's 2015 Federal Congress in Port Elizabeth, Maimane was elected leader of the DA, succeeding outgoing leader Helen Zille. He defeated Wilmot James, winning close to 90% of the vote. He was backed by prominent businessman and future Johannesburg mayor Herman Mashaba. He became the first black South African to lead the DA, as well as its youngest leader to date. In the 2016 municipal elections, the party contested the municipal elections for the first time under the leadership of Mmusi Maimane. The party gained significant support and control of municipalities all across South Africa while assuming control of most Western Cape councils. In addition, the party gained three metropolitan municipalities from the ANC – Tshwane, Johannesburg and Nelson Mandela Bay. The party did increase its majority in Cape Town. They lost control of the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality in August 2018, after a vote of no confidence ousted the DA administration. The DA held its Federal Congress on 7–8 April 2018 in Pretoria.

She faced internal DA disciplinary action, later apologised, and was removed as Shadow Minister. She returned as Shadow Deputy Minister of Police in September 2017. Helen Zille sent out controversial tweets in March 2017, arguing that some elements of South Africa's colonial legacy made a positive contribution to the country. Zille subsequently apologised in light of the outrage generated and remained Western Cape Premier. After months of infighting and legal challenges, Mayor of Cape Town, Patricia de Lille, announced at a press briefing with Mmusi Maimane that she would resign as Mayor of Cape Town, effective 31 October 2018. Candidates for her position included DA Leader Mmusi Maimane, former Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato, Gauteng Provincial Legislature Member Heinrich Volmink, Deputy Mayor of Cape Town Ian Neilson, and Western Cape Provincial Parliament Speaker Sharna Fernandez.

Ross (Docket No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB) is a United States District Court case in the District of Columbia in which the court determined whether or not a President may establish a marine national monument, the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, under the authority of the Antiquities Act of 1906. The case represents the first time that the President's authority to create an offshore marine monument under the Act was directly challenged in court.Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant-Intervenor Applicants' Motion to Intervene at 5-6, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2018), (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB). While the District Court upheld the President's authority to designate the monument under the authority bestowed by the Antiquities Act, the case was appealed to the D.C. Circuit (Docket No. 18-05353) and awaits further judicial review.Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 51. History  Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument boundaries. On September 15, 2016, President Obama issued a Presidential Proclamation creating the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument. As the first marine national monument in the Atlantic Ocean, it consists of approximately 4,913 square miles (12,724 square kilometers) and is located about 130 miles east-southeast of Cape Cod in an area of the ocean known as the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The monument includes two distinct areas. The first area covers three underwater canyons—Oceanographer, Gilbert, and Lydonia—spanning roughly 941 square miles. The second area covers four distinct seamounts—Bear, Physalia, Retriever, and Mytilus—encompassing 3,972 square miles. Collectively, the monument is approximately the size of Connecticut. The canyons and seamounts are celebrated for their rich biological diversity. The steep slopes of the canyons and seamounts interact with oceanographic currents to create localized eddies, causing upwelling. The currents lift nutrients to surface waters, fueling an outburst of phytoplankton and zooplankton that form the base of the food chain. These plankton draw large schools of small fish, and those fish draw even larger predators such as whales, sharks, tunas and seabirds to the area. In all, “the geology, currents, and productivity create diverse and vibrant ecosystems.” As a result, the area has been the subject of “intense scientific interest” and discovery since the 1970s.Proclamation at 4. President Obama's proclamation directs the Secretaries of Commerce and Interior to develop plans within three years for the “proper care and management” of the monument. Further, the proclamation prohibits oil, gas and mineral exploration, and most commercial fishing within the monument's boundaries.Id. at 5. In response to the monument's designation, several commercial fishing associations filed a lawsuit against the federal government in March 2017.Complaint, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association. v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2018) (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB).

The Antiquities Act authorizes the President of the United States, in their discretion, to declare “objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated on land owned or controlled by the Federal Government to be national monuments.”54 U.S.C. § 320301(a). It further authorizes the President to “reserve parcels of land as a part of the national monuments.”Id. §320301(b). Any parcel must be “confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”Id. In asserting their case, the plaintiffs argued that the President lacked the authority under the Antiquities Act to declare the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts a national monument.Compl., ¶¶ 3-4. They put forward three main arguments. First, they argued that the submerged lands of the Canyons and Seamounts are not “lands” within the meaning of the Antiquities Act.Compl. ¶ 71. See also Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 at 55-56. Secondly, they argued that the federal government does not “control” the lands on which the Canyons and Seamounts lie under the meaning of the Act.Compl. ¶ 71. See also Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 60. Finally, they argued that the amount of land reserved as part of the monument is not the smallest compatible with its management.Compl. at ¶¶ 72-75. The government sought dismissal of the case under rules 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on the grounds that the case is not judicially reviewable and that the President did not exceed his statutory authority under the Antiquities Act.Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 1-2, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2018), (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB). The conservationist-intervenors filed a response in support of the federal defendant's motion to dismiss, but argued separately that while the court may review a Presidential monument proclamation, the court should dismiss the plaintiff's complaint because it fails to state a claim for relief under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).Intervenors' Response in Support of Federal Defendant's Motion to Dismiss at 1-2, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2018), (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB). Ruling  The case was decided by United States District Court for the District of Columbia Judge James E. Boasberg, who on October 5, 2018, granted the government's motion to dismiss the case.Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 51. In doing so, the court made four important holdings. Firstly, the court rejected the contention that presidential exercise of authority to designate a national monument is not judicially reviewable.Id. at 54. Secondly, the court held that the term “lands” within the Act includes the submerged lands of the ocean floor.Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association, 349 F. Supp. 3d at 55-60. Thirdly, the court held that the federal government adequately controls the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone for the purposes of the Act.Id. at 60-67. Finally, the court held that the plaintiffs did not sufficiently demonstrate that the Monument is too large.Id. at 67-68.  Legal significance  The Supreme Court has upheld or discussed the application of the Antiquities Act to the submerged lands of three different national monuments along the American coastline and inland water bodies, however, they have not yet ruled on the application of the Antiquities Act to marine monument designations located exclusively beyond the territorial sea.See Cappaert v. United States, 426 U.S. 128 (1976); United States v. California, 436 U.S. 32 (1978); Alaska v. United States, 545 U.S. 75 (2005).Yoo, John; Gaziano, Todd (Summer 2018). \\"Presidential Authority to Revoke or Reduce National Monument Designations\\". Yale Journal on Regulation. 35 (617): 23. The District Court's holding represents the first time a court has squarely considered whether the President has the authority under the Antiquities Act to create a marine national monument located entirely within the United States’ Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends beyond the territorial sea.Yoo, John; Gaziano, Todd (Summer 2018). \\"Presidential Authority to Revoke or Reduce National Monument Designations\\". Yale Journal on Regulation. 35 (617): 23.Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant-Intervenor Applicants' Motion to Intervene at 5-6, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (D.D.C. 2018), (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB). Subsequent litigation  In December 2018 the plaintiffs notified the District Court of their decision to appeal the case.\\"Notice of Appeal, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, 349 F. Supp. 3d 48 (2018) (No. 1:17-cv-00406-JEB)\\". The case will soon be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit. The plaintiff-appellants filed their opening brief on April 8, 2019.Appellant's Opening Brief, Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, No. 18-5353, (D.C. Cir. filed Apr. 8, 2019). Defendant-appellees and intervenors submitted their reply briefs on May 29, 2019.Massachusetts Lobstermen's Association v. Ross, No. 18-5353 (D.C. Cir. 2019). All briefing will be complete in July.  Related litigation  Although litigating a separate issue under the Antiquities Act, this District Court opinion has already been cited by litigants on both sides of the ongoing dispute over President Trump's reduction of Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.See Wilderness Society v. Trump (No. 1:17-cv-02587); Hopi Tribe v. Trump (No. 1:17-cv-2590); Grand Staircase Escalante Partners v. Trump (No. 1:17-cv-2591); Utah Dine Bikeyah v. Trump (No. 1:17-cv-2605); Natural Resource Defense Council v. Trump, No. 1: 17- cv- 2606). The litigants each use the case to advance differing views of Presidential discretion and authority under the Act. For example, the opinion was used to support the argument that the President has broad discretion under the Antiquities Act to both create and shrink a national monument, and for the notion that Congressional acquiescence to Presidential action is germane to a court's consideration of the President's authority under the Act.Consolidated Opening Brief of Intervenors State of Utah, San Juan County, American Farm Bureau Federation, and Utah Farm Bureau Federation Supporting Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 16, 20, Hopi Tribe v. Trump, No. 1:17-cv-02590-TSC (D.D.C. filed Feb. 15, 2019). The opinion has also been cited to emphasize that the President's authority under the Act is bound by the Act's preservationist purpose, and therefore is not unlimited.Plaintiffs' Joint Response in Opposition to Intervenors American Farm Bureau Federation et al.'s Opening Brief Supporting Federal Defendants' Motion to Dismiss at 5, Wilderness Society v.

As the AKP had failed to win a majority in the June 2015 Turkish general election the month before, and soon after the resumption of hostilities announced the November 2015 Turkish snap general election, analysts believe that the Ceylanpınar killings and return to war have been used to increase Turkish nationalist fervor and favored the ruling party taking back control over the Turkish parliament. Other motives have also been advanced, with the Syrian war encouraging extremist parties from both sides to undermine peace efforts by increasing nationalism and readiness for war.  Background  Early AKP policies were reformist and appeasing. In 2011, Kurdish independents candidates won 6.6% of the votes and 35 parliament seats while the 2013 Turkey's Solution process greatly reduced PKK activities in South-Eastern Turkey. Lower incomes and lower literacy have been observed for decades in Turkey's South-Eastern provinces, causing higher demographic dynamism and raising political weight for Kurds. On 7 June 2015, following largely successful ceasefire period thanks to the government and the rebels efforts, the June 2015 Turkish general election provided a major +6.5% gain to the HDP collecting 13.1% of national votes and a notable decrease for AKP, gathering 41% of votes or a -9% evolution. This electoral success has been called the \\"Kurdish miracle\\" and deprived the AKP of its majority previously maintained since 2002. On 20 July 2015, ISIS led the 2015 Suruç bombing, killing 32 Kurdish volunteers. PKK elements accused Turkey of supporting ISIS and being complicit of the bombing. It has been argue that ISIS willfully wanted to put pressure on the Turkey-Kurdish peace process and succeeded in its aim to stir conflict between them.  Incident  On 22 July 2015, two police officers were assassinated by unidentified men. Soon after, 9 Turkey Kurds were anonymously denounced as the killers, arrested and accused of assassinations under PKK orders.  Authorship and command  Authorship was first claimed by PKK's armed wing HPG, describing it as a retaliation following the prior Suruç bombing. The claim suggesting PKK-related killers. The claim was soon countered by higher PKK authorities: a week after, the Kurdistan Communities Union (KCK) spokesman Demhat Agit said that the PKK was not officially involved, saying \\"these [attack has been lead by] units independent from the PKK. They are local forces which organized themselves and not affiliated with us.\\"  Executive reaction  On 24 July 2015, the Erdogan government simultaneously ordered Turkish Police large scale internal operations while the Turkish military began a large-scale military Operation Martyr Yalçın against PKK and ISIL. As a result of attacks by the Turkish army, the PKK officially announced the resumption of full-scale hostilities. The collapse of the ceasefire has been linked to the poor performance at the June election.U.N. Accuses Turkey of Killing Hundreds of Kurds https://nyti.ms/2mu3IEGDavid Graeber (2015), Turkey could cut off Islamic State’s supply lines. So why doesn’t it? https://theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/18/turkey-cut-islamic-state- supply-lines-erdogan-isis  Impact  On 24 August, President Erdogan of AKP called for a snap election. HDP leadership accused the ruling AKP of orchestrating nationalist attacks against them, HDP volunteers facing a \\"campaign of lynching\\" with HDP offices being attacked, in one instance 200 times in 2 days. As fighting intensified, military curfew was imposed in 100 areas in South-Eastern Turkey, most notably in Cizre's 2015 clashes. HDP accused the ruling AK Party of looking to reignite war with PKK and stoke unrest to revive nationalist support ahead of the 1 November election. On 1 November 2015, the November 2015 Turkish general election provided a major gain to the AKP (49.5% of votes, +8.6%) and decrease for the HDP (10.7% of votes, -2.4%). The HDP narrowly hovered the 10% election threshold needed to win seats. The low score of the HDP has been linked to the renewal of violence and fear of IS attacks on HDP political rallies.  Trial and acquittal of the 9 suspects  In March 2018, all 9 PKK suspects of the July 2015 killing of the two Turkish policemen in Ceylanpınar, which led AKP to denounce the peace process and resume the war, were acquitted by the Turkish Court as no substantial evidence was provided.Kurdish teen brutally tortured in case that ended peace process  Mahir Korulu https://ahvalnews.com/turkey-kurds/kurdish- teen-brutally-tortured-case-ended-peace-process On 16 April 2019, the 9 suspected PKK operatives' acquittal was upheld by a Higher Court.

Starting at the base station at 7,730 ft (2,356 m) above sea level, it ascends to the top station at 11,663 ft (3,555 m) in eight minutes, at a maximum speed of 26,2 ft/second (8 m/s) and carrying 44 people per cabin. Conceived in 1929, construction of the cableway started on 5 September 1963 and was completed on 27 July 1971, starting operations on 2 August 1971. It was renovated between 1999 and 2007.  History  The top station While various proposals were made over the years for the construction of a cable car to facilitate the ascent of Mount Teide, the project that led to building the cable car was initiated by lawyer Andrés de Arroyo y González de Chávez. In 1929 he visited Germany and, inspired by the cable cars in the region of Zugspitze, on his return to Tenerife he started working on a project to do the same for Teide, paying all expenses. In 1930, civil engineer José Ochoa Bejumea, of Caminos Canales y Puertos, presented an initial design, with two sections: one with two cabins each holding 35 people and operating between Montaña Majúa and Montaña Fría; the second with a single cabin taking 15 people to the terminus and back. Some 30 years later, after many years of negotiations and modifications to the initial project, Teleférico del Pico del Teide - a society created on 15 October 1959 for the operation of a cable car service - managed to come to an agreement with the Town Hall of La Orotava, acquiring the land needed for construction, in exchange for a school already built in Aguamansa and about 800 m² of land. In 1960, the final design was finished by Miguel Pintor Domingo, of Caminos, Canales and Puertos, and Francisco Trujillo Armas. Based on the 1930s design, the base station was moved the base station to its current location to reduce the cable length and remove one of the towers. The design used the slope of the terrain to simplify the towers to the intermediate station, and to avoid the use of towers to the terminus. Land surveys to define the final locations of the stations and four towers was started in April 1962 and completed in 1963. Construction started on 5 September 1963 with the excavations for the road to the base station, and lasted eight years. The foundations and civil structures were constructed by Entrecanales y Tabora S.A., with the cable car installed by the Italian company Ceretti e Tanfani S.A. Construction material was initially moved by workers and donkeys until a hoist and auxiliary cable car were installed in 1967. Construction was inaugurated on 18 July 1971, completed on 27 July 1971, and the cableway started operating on 2 August 1971. It was renovated between 1999 and 2007, with new towers, cables, and cable cars, as well as remodelling of the stations and renewal of the machinery and electrics.  Cableway Structure  A cable car at the bottom station of the cableway The cableway has two stations. The base station, at 7,730 ft (2,356 m), is accessible by car, with 220 parking slots, a bar, restaurant and a souvenir shop on-site. The cabins can accommodate a maximum of 44 people, and the journey time is eight minutes. The cables are served by four towers depending on each other. The mechanism is structured so that when one car goes up the other must go down. The upper station at La Rambleta is 11,663 ft (3,555 m) above sea level and has Spain's highest payphone. La Rambleta has views of the Seven Cañadas and the Ucanca Valley. Trails lead to north-facing La Fortaleza and south- facing Pico Viejo viewpoints, with the latter being a guided tour with views of La Gomera, El Hierro, La Palma and the Pico Viejo crater. There is also restricted access to the top crater of Mount Teide, the highest peak in Spain at 12,198 ft (3,718 m) above sea level, by the Telesforo Bravo trail. There is a path that connects the two stations.  Ownership and Company Structure  The facility is currently operated by Teleférico del Pico de Teide, a limited company created in August 1959, of which the Tenerife City Hall holds 49.44% of the shares (2008 figure). The company has 45 employees; its manager is Ignacio Sabaté and the president of its board of directors is Carlos Alonso (2017 data). In 2013, the company incorporated Volcano Life, S.L. as a tourism intermediary, with a workforce of about 40 staff (2017 figure). The Volcano Teide Experience trademark is then born, with the aim of promoting and enhancing a respectful, informative, safe and enjoyable approach to visiting Mount Teide.  Operation  The cablecar operates between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., with the last car ascending at 4 p.m. and the last car descending at 4.50 pm. The closing time is delayed by some hours between July and October, up until the clocks change. The time at the top station is limited to 1 hour. , ticket prices start at €13.50 each way. In its 33 years of operation (up until 2019), the cable car has experienced two breakdowns; on 15 March 2017, where 60 people were retained in two cable cars for a couple of hours, and on 18 August 2018 when an electric motor failure led to the evacuation of 34 people from the cable cars, with 115 people at the top of the volcano at the time. The cable car was operated manually to transport them back to the base station. The 2017 incident left around 200 people at the top of the volcano, 60 of which stayed in the shelter overnight. The previous time the evacuation protocols had been used was 20 years earlier.

The estate was about northeast of the town of Devizes and included a house, stables, gardens, farmland and woodland. After multiple purposes and ownerships throughout its existence, the house was demolished in 1955 and the estate has since been divided up into residences and farmland. Willy-Sutton era The land that New Park stood upon was originally owned by the Crown Estate and was later purchased by an unknown party. Roundway House was built in 1777–1783 by George Willy, whose son William Willy MP later inherited the estate. He died without issue in 1770 and the estate passed to his nephew Willey Sutton who died five years later. The estate passed to Willey's younger brother James Sutton MP, recently married to Eleanor Addington, and he ordered alterations to the house. These were completed in 1777–1783 by architect James Wyatt and the house became known as New Park; the architecture resembles Wyatt's other works such as Heaton Hall. Sutton's daughter Eleanor inherited the estate in 1801 and lived there with her husband Thomas Grimston Estcourt MP until 1839 when the Dowager Sutton died. Colston era The house was sold in 1840 to Edward Francis Colston, formerly of Filkin's Hall in Oxfordshire. Colston ordered alterations in 1841–2 including the construction of fencing around the estate, which caused local resentment, a new deer park and two driveways with gatehouses: one towards London Road and one towards the centre of Devizes, bringing about the street name 'New Park Street' (which still exists today). Church services for the villagers of Roundway were held in the house between 1937 and 1944. The estate, now known as Roundway Park, continued in the Colston family until circa 1948; owners included Charles, 1st Baron Roundway (1854–1925) and Edward, 2nd Baron (1880–1944). Further renovations were made during the Colston's ownership including moving the main entrance to the courtyard, the addition of a porte-cochere and a semi-circular balustrade, refurbishing the greenhouse into a library, transforming the sash windows into mullion windows and the addition of bedrooms and bathrooms. The 2nd Baron's wife Gladys, Lady Roundway continued to live at Roundway Park until 1949 before moving to London, at which point the estate was divided up and sold. Fate In 1949, the estate land of 1584 acres was sold to the Bristol Merchant Venturers for use by Henry Herbert Wills' charity for Chronic and Incurable Sufferers, although it is unknown what the involvement of Wills' charity was. Bristol Merchant Venturers still own the land and lease it to local farmers. In 2016, they built a modern housing estate on a small amount of land. In 1954, Wiltshire County Council purchased the house, gardens and paddocks for Civil Defence purposes. After six years, the council sold the house, which was suffering from dry rot at this point, to Peter White, a property speculator. White demolished the north and west wings of the house, leaving only the stables, coach house and the east wing of the house, which was converted into a private residence. The stable block was recorded as Grade II listed in 1962.

She is Senior Vice President for Moral Injury Programs at Volunteers of America, headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia, and a Commissioned Minister in the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Early life The daughter of Ayako Nakashima and a U.S. Army soldier from Dorado, Puerto Rico, Clemente Morales Torres, she was raised by her mother and grandparents until October 1952, when her mother married Roy Grady Brock, a U.S. Army soldier and veteran of World War II. Her legal name was Rita Nakashima until Roy Brock adopted her in 1958, when her name changed to Rita Brock. The period of her life in Japan and her first thirty years in the U.S. is covered by her theological memoir, Proverbs of Ashes: Violence, Redemptive Suffering and the Search for What Saves Us, co-authored with Rebecca Ann Parker. Early career Brock has a B.A, from Chapman University (1972) and holds the Rel. M., degree from the Claremont School of Theology (1974), and the M.A. (1980), and Ph.D. (1988) in Philosophy of Religion and Theology from the Claremont Graduate University in California. Brock is the first Asian American woman to earn a doctorate in theology. She was associated with the Pacific Asian Center for Theology and Strategies (PACTS) at the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley, California, from 1978-1999, and is a founder of and an emerita faculty advisor for the Pacific, Asian, North American Asian Women in Theology and Ministry beginning in 1984. From 1980-81, Brock was an adjunct instructor in biblical studies at Scripps College. Her first full-time teaching appointment was as assistant professor of religion at Jarvis Christian College in Hawkins, Texas, a historically black college in her denomination (1981-82). She later taught religion for a year (1983-84) at Valparaiso University. In 1984, Brock was hired for a teaching position in philosophy and religion at Stephens College in Columbia, Missouri. In her second year, she became the Women’s Studies program director (1985-89) and partnered with Planned Parenthood in annual Roe v. Wade events and offering classes in reproductive rights and freedoms. She completed her doctoral dissertation in 1987 and was mentored in its completion by Bernard Loomer. She graduated in June 1988 with her Ph.D. Her doctoral advisor was John B. Cobb, a leading figure in Process Theology. The revised manuscript was published by Crossroads Press in November 1988 as the winner of the publisher’s award for the best manuscript of the year in Women’s Studies. Released as Journeys By Heart: A Christology of Erotic Power, it was the second book-length feminist Christology and the first work in feminist theology to use the concept of erotic power found in the works of Audre Lorde and Haunani-Kay Trask. Mid-career From 1989-1990, Brock taught religion and women’s studies at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Washington. In March 1989, she was offered the Endowed Chair in the Humanities at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota, where she began teaching that fall. She became a professor and received tenure in her seven years there. In 1991, she worked with Twin Cities Asian Americans, such as writer David Mura and activist Valerie Lee, to create the Asian American Renaissance, an organization that used the arts to educate the public about racism against Asian Americans and the contributions of Asian Americans in the arts and humanities. This organizational work became a basis for the creation of the first humanities conference about Asian Americans ever held in the Twin Cities in 1996, called \\"The Other Half of the Basket\\", with a grant she received from the Minnesota Humanities Commission. In 1996, Brock published her second, award-winning book with co-author Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, Casting Stones: Prostitution and Liberation in Asia and the United States (Fortress), which won the Catholic Press Award in Gender Studies. It was the first work in feminist theology to address the topic of sex work and justice. From 1997-1999, Brock directed the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe College, founded in 1959 by Mary Ingraham Bunting to advance the careers of professional women in all fields. In the fall of 1999, Radcliffe merged with Harvard as the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and Brock was named the first director of the Radcliffe Fellowship Program at Harvard University. After her time at Radcliffe, Brock was a fellow at the Harvard Divinity School Center for Values in Public Life from 2001-2002 and then a Visiting Scholar at the Starr King School for the Ministry at the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley from 2002-2012. She was also a blogger for the Huffington Post Religion section from 2008-2016. With her move to Berkeley in May 2002, Brock began a second book project with Rebecca Parker which would become the 2008 work, Saving Paradise: How Christianity Traded Love of This World for Crucifixion and Empire (Beacon). It was selected by Publishers Weekly as one of the best books in religion in 2008. Released in 2012 in the UK as Saving Paradise: Recovering Christianity’s Forgotten Love for This Earth (Canterbury Press), it was selected as the theme book for the 2012 Greenbelt Festival in Cheltenham, England. Late in 2008, Brock began working with Gabriella Lettini on the Truth Commission on Conscience in War, which was held at the Riverside Church in New York in March 2010. In response to feedback from the Truth Commission, Brock and Lettini wrote Soul Repair: Recovering from Moral Injury After War (Beacon, 2012), one of the first books written on moral injury. Brock, with a grant from the Lilly Endowment, Inc., co-founded the Soul Repair Center in 2012 at Brite Divinity School at Texas Christian University, and directed it until May 2017. Later career In 2015, Brock’s Soul Repair Center work was increasingly supported by Volunteers of America (VOA). In June 2017, Brock accepted the position of Senior Vice President and Director of the Shay Moral Injury Center at Volunteers of America, named in honor of VA retired psychiatrist and noted scholar of moral injury Jonathan Shay. Brock’s work involves assisting VOA’s affiliates across the U.S. in implementing moral injury programs and working nationally on new moral injury programs that further the mission of caring for those at risk.

He later was an ambassador for Yoweri Museveni to Japan, Italy, and Sudan. Early life Ernest Obitre Gama was born into a Lugbara family of farmers in the West Nile sub-region in the Northern Region of Uganda. He was born in the village of Olevu, in Maracha Town, in the West Nile sub-region on 15 November in 1940. He was orphaned at a young age, and did not attend school until he was 12 years old. = Education = Obitre Gama attended local schools in Maracha Town area from 1952 to 1960, when, at the age of 20, he enrolled in Busoga College, a boarding secondary school located at Mwiri Hill in the Jinja District of Uganda. He earned his school certificate in 1963. His goal was to become a marine engineer and work in Mombasa, Kenya, but his guardians objected and told him to enlist in the Uganda People's Defence Force.  Career  = Armed Forces = On 5 June 1964, Obitre Gama joined the Uganda Army. In January 1965 he was commissioned and went to the Specialist Weapons School at Battlesbury Barracks in Warminster, Wiltshire in the United Kingdom where was trained to be a platoon commander. Upon his return to Uganda he was immediately sent to Zaire, but after a short time in Zaire he became the director of the Officer Cadet's Training School in Jinja, Uganda. In Jinja, Uganda, he performed the first paratroop jump by a Ugandan paratrooper in Ugandan airspace. This was also when he first met Idi Amin. After serving as the director of the Officer Cadet's Training School in Jinja, Uganda, Obitre Gama travelled extensively on behalf of the Uganda People's Defence Force. In December 1967 he attended advanced military training in India, then went to the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington, New Zealand, after which he traveled to Israel for a five-month long course in parachute training. Following his parachute training course in Israel, Obitre Gama became the commandant and founder of the Ugandan School of Paratroopers. In 1969, Obitre Gana went on a tour of India, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia where he represented the Uganda People's Defence Force. When the 1971 Ugandan coup d'état occurred on 25 January 1971, Obitre Gama was working in Trinidad and Tobago. He was sent by President Apollo Milton Obote to represent Uganda as a member of the Commonwealth of Nations who were assisting in the military tribunals of members of the Black Power Revolution, a series of demonstrations and strikes that attempted to effect socio-political change in Trinidad and Tobago. Obitre Gama was observing the trials of Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, members of the Trinidad and Tobago Defence Force who mutinied in response to Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago Eric Williams calling a state of emergency and arresting leaders of the Black Power Revolution. = Minister of Internal Affairs = Following the 1971 Ugandan coup d'état, Idi Amin called for Obitre Gama to return to Uganda immediately. Obitre Gama learned of the coup d'état in his home country through a BBC Radio broadcast. He was appointed to be Minister of Internal Affairs on 2 February, replacing the imprisoned and soon- to-be executed Basil Kiiza Bataringaya. He was the first soldier to be a member of the Cabinet of Uganda, a role he tried to turn down and a role he did not seek. Obitre Gama's most influential action as Minister of Internal Affairs was leading a mechanized battalion to restore order to Kampala in February 1972 following ethnic conflict within the city. Cracks quickly emerged between Obitre Gama and Idi Amin. Obitre Gama refused to promote Juma Butabika, the violent Idi Amin ally, to the role of Senior Superintendent of Police out of what Obitre Gama described as concerns for his violent behavior. In May 1972, Amin allegedly snubbed a hand shake from Obitre Gama at a conference at Serena Hotel, Kampala, saying \\"I don't want to see you. You want to overthrow me\\". The ever erratic Idi Amin actually followed this by appointing Obitre Gama to be Minister of Power, Transport, and Communication in June 1972, a role that he served concurrently with his role as Minister of Internal Affairs, although he was retired from both roles by Idi Amin \\"for the public interest\\". Charles Oboth Ofumbi replaced Obitre Gama as Minister of Internal Affairs. = Interim Period = Obitre Gama returned to his home in Olevu in Maracha Town following his retirement from Minister of Internal Affairs. In 1979, during the Uganda–Tanzania War, the Uganda People's Defence Force attempted to recall Obitre Gama back into the armed forces, but he declined. He did not flee into the Democratic Republic of the Congo nine kilometers from his home like many other former Idi Amin officials, rather he stayed when the Tanzania People's Defence Force came in and met with new Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa who promised Obitre Gama safety and allegedly asked Obitre Gama to become Minister of Minerals, a position Obitre Gama declined. Obitre Gama kept a low profile during the second Apollo Milton Obote administration. = Ambassador for Museveni = When Yoweri Museveni took power, Obitre Gama reentered Ugandan political life, this time as a diplomat. He was appointed Ambassador to Japan in 1986, then Ambassador to Italy in 1987, and Sudan in 1988. He remained as ambassador to Sudan until 1995, when Uganda suspended relations with Sudan following Ugandan military assistance of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army and their sending of Ugandan troops into Sudan. = Life after Politics = Obitre Gama has worked since 2000 as the Chairman of the Amnesty Commission's North-Western Region Directorate. The Amnesty Commission came out of the Amnesty Act of 2000 which states that \\"any forces that are fighting the government (of Uganda) and wish to give-up are free to report and will be forgiven when they denounce their activities\\".  Personal life  Obitre Gama is a diabetic. Obitre Gama married Zilipah Enaru before he became Minister of Internal Affairs. He lives with her in the same house in Olevu in Maracha Town since he left the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Obitre Gama has six children with his wife, including Eyoki Obitre Gama, Jocelyn Obitre Gama, Robina Obitre Gama, Afimani Obitre Gama, Gordon Obitre Gama, and Judy Obitre–Gama, who is the current Executive Director of the National Identification and Registration Authority in Uganda, previous Board Secretary of the Uganda Registration Services Bureau, and is a noted scholar and environmental lawyer. He also claimed in an interview with Sidney Miria of the New Vision newspaper to have other children. Obitre Gama was a noted sportsman as well, winning Ugandan-wide competitions in Rugby union and Squash.

Benedict's brothers were Beled, who was Master of the cupbearers in the court of Duke Béla and ancestor of the Vicai family, which existed until 1873; Osl II, who served as Master of the treasury and Ban of Severin, and was also ancestor of the Ostfi family; Herbord, an important royal courtier in the 1270s; Nicholas, who functioned as ispán of Győr County; Thomas, who did not hold any courtly positions, was forefather of the Csornai and Kanizsai noble families; and John, whose branch died out by the early 14th century. Career Benedict was born at the turn of the 12th and 13th centuries. As his father's third son, he entered ecclesiastical service. He attended the University of Paris. Thereafter, he bore the title of \\"magister\\". He served as lector of the cathedral chapter of Esztergom between 1225 and 1231. After the death Alexander, the majority of the cathedral chapter of Várad (present-day Oradea, Romania) elected Benedict as his successor around May 1231. His superior, Ugrin Csák, Archbishop of Kalocsa confirmed his election and consecrated him shortly thereafter. His candidacy was supported by his patron, Duke Béla, who administered Transylvania and other parts of Eastern Hungary, including Bihar County, where the diocese mostly laid. However, Pope Gregory IX contested Benedict's election and supported his subdeacon Primogenitus. Benedict remained in his position despite the pope's protest and investigations in the Roman Curia regarding his suitability and secular nepotism. Pope Gregory even excommunicated Benedict. Some canons still urged his removal during their visit in Rome in 1236. Pope Gregory considered Primogenitus as the lawful Bishop of Várad and allowed him to borrow 150 silver denari at the expense of the diocese. Andrew II of Hungary, who died on 21 September 1235, was buried in Egres Abbey, which located in the territory of Benedict's diocese. Benedict became a staunch supporter of Béla IV, who ascended the Hungarian throne. After the death of Primogenitus, Pope Gregory acknowledged his bishopric and confirmed the election (although it was not required at that time). His diocese severely devastated during the Mongol invasion of Hungary in 1241. Güyük Khan invaded Transylvania from the Oituz Pass in March. Benedict gathered his army and marched out to the royal camp at the Sajó river, but a vanguard of Mongol marauders clashed with his army near Eger. Benedict defeated them, but another Mongol army forced him to withdraw to his episcopal seat, Várad. As one of his canons, Roger of Torre Maggiore preserved the events in his account Carmen Miserabile, the town was captured and devastated by the Mongols. Benedict gathered the remnants of his episcopal army and fled his diocese in order to seek refuge beyond the river Danube. Benedict never returned to the Diocese of Várad. In Transdanubia, Benedict joined the royal accompaniment of Béla IV, who fled the disastrous Battle of Mohi from his Mongol pursuers. Béla and his royal court, including Benedict, took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir in Dalmatia. Benedict was elected Bishop of Győr in January 1243. Officially, he was styled as Bishop of Várad and postulated Bishop of Győr until June. Pope Innocent IV confirmed his translation from Várad to Győr on 11 July 1243. During his brief episcopate, the Diocese of Győr suffered from the frequent raids and plundering attacks of Frederick the Quarrelsome. Benedict died sometimes between June and October 1244.

It debuted as a modest family-style Italian trattoria around the turn of the 20th century. It was located near the notorious Barbary Coast area of the city. In the 1950s it became known as a luxurious restaurant serving mostly traditional French cuisine. The interior had Victorian or fin-de-siècle bordello-like decor, featuring plush red wallpaper, heavy drapes, white linen, and formal waiters in black tuxedos. Writing in 1979, gastronome Roy Andries de Groot called it \\"unquestionably the most elegant, famous, finest, and luxurious restaurant in San Francisco and [it] is probably among the three or four greatest truly American restaurants in the country\\" that \\"can provide dinners of supreme elegance and luxury.\\"De Groot, in an unnamed newspaper article reprinted in In Search of the Perfect Meal, page 241 When it closed in 1995, it was one of the few remaining restaurants of the kind that had once epitomized the celebrated San Francisco dining scene; among the others, some of them even older and as nearly well-known, were the Ritz Old Poodle Dog, Jack's, The Blue Fox, A. Sabella's, and Amelio's. All of them are now gone, and only a few vestiges of the 19th century still remain in San Francisco: Tadich Grill, Sam's, and John's Grill; none of these, however, ever enjoyed the reputation for decadent, even illicit, pleasures that many of the others purveyed.  History  Ernie's first chef and owner was Ernie Carlesso. At the time it was called Ernie's Il Travatore. Located at 847 Montgomery Street near Jackson Square, it was on the edge of the Barbary Coast, a red light district that had been known throughout the world since the 1850s for its brothels, saloons, opium dens, gambling and dance halls, and restaurants with discreet private dining rooms upstairs where additional services could be provided. The restaurant serving traditional American-Italian food was so successful that in 1935Some sources say 1934 Carlesso and one of his waiters, an immigrant named Ambrogio Gotti,Some sources give his first name as \\"Ambrose\\", the translation from the Italian \\"Ambrogio\\" bought the building.According, at least to De Groot, who is, however, careful to say that Gotti's sons always denied the assertion, page 241 The building had been the site of one of the more notorious landmarks of the Barbary Coast, the 'Frisco Dance Hall, and some of its elements remained. Carlesso died in 1946. His partner Gotti retired in 1947, selling his share to his two sons, Roland and Victor, who had been working as busboys.Some sources say Gotti had become a full partner of Carlesso in 1934, others say 1939 Only 21 and 25 years old when they became sole owners, the two brothers continued in that role for the next 48 years. Sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the brothers replaced the old red checkerboard tablecloth-type decor with a completely rebuilt interior. The exterior signage was reduced to a single 2 foot square brass plate beside the door with a script \\"E\\". The message was clear; they weren't looking for walk-in traffic. Their goal, says De Groot, was to \\"make it the most beautiful restaurant in the world.\\"De Groot, page 242 > The first thing they did was to clean up and move the famous long mahogany > bar, with its intricate, stained-glass back, to the front of the restaurant. > It was the last remaining relic of the 'Frisco Dance Hall. The main dining > rooms were decorated with magnificent Victorian crystal chandeliers, the > walls covered with maroon Scalamandre silk brocade, the banquettes and > chairs in red, the carpets in burgundy, the furniture, antique pieces from > some of the great mansions of San Francisco. The ambiance was that loud, > supremely elegant in which the wealthiest nabobs of a hundred years ago > might have met the grandest ladies of the night. French chefs were hired, crêpes Suzette appeared on the menu along with Chicken in Champagne, and by the early 1960s, Ernie's received the first of 32 consecutive annual five-star awards from the Mobil Travel Guide.San Francisco Chronicle, September 29, 1995 In 1958 Alfred Hitchcock's classic thriller Vertigo featured three scenes set in Ernie's; left unexplained was how Jimmy Stewart, on a policeman's salary, could afford such elegant meals in the company of Kim Novak. By the 1980s, tastes in food and decor had changed, and Ernie's was forced to renovate. The menu was lightened, the red silk wallpaper was replaced by yellow silk, the old bar was moved, and new chefs were hired. The transformation was not completely successful. By 1989 the Zagat Survey was giving Ernie's, \\"a fading North Beach flower reincarnated as a stylish, elegant French restaurant\\", only 21 points out of a possible 30 for its cuisine, 22 for its decor, and 21 for its service, unimpressive scores for so expensive a restaurant. It noted, however, that \\"gone are the bordello-like setting and snooty service.\\"Zagat, 1989, page 42 In 1993, with new chef Craig Thomas in the kitchen, Zagat was giving it 22 for cuisine, and 25 for both decor and service.Zagat, 1993, page 42 Others were less kind. \\"Ernie's is a parody of a fine restaurant,\\" said the San Francisco Chronicle in 1986, \\"perhaps because Ernie's serves so many tourists they feel they can play-act their way through a meal. In this tricky business climate when expensive formal restaurants are fading in popularity, the owners of Ernie's would do well to reevaluate their attitude toward their customers.\\"Unterman and Stesser, page 60. Although the latter-day Ernie's launched the careers of celebrated local chefs such as Jacky Robert and Alain Rondelli, its efforts to adapt to a changing world were not enough: on September 30, 1995, Ernie's closed permanently.

Plot A civil war is tearing apart the kingdom of Detina. When Avram became the new King of Detina, he announced his intent to abolish serfdom for the blond serfs upon which the northern provinces depended, Detina was torn in two, and the rebellious north took Avram's cousin, Grand Duke Geoffrey, as their king. Neither side could expect an easy victory. While the south was larger and wealthier, the north had better soldiers and more powerful wizards. Led by officers riding unicorns, supplied by flying carpets, both sides clash for three years when Count Thraxton, a conceited wizard- general whose opinions of his spell-casting ability far outstripped the reality, bungled a spell which backfired disastrously against his own side, giving the Unionists a decisive victory. But the war was far from over: Thraxton is relieved of his command; which means that the south faces a far more competent general: Joseph the Gamecock. And Joseph and his troops were determined to hold Peachtree Province against the loyalist troops. They had occupied Rockface Rise, which offered only two narrow places where the Unionists could come at them, and had further fortified it with trenches and catapults. When the southern army attacked, they would face formidable obstacles both natural and manmade, as well as the repeating crossbows of the troops and the deadly sorcerous storm and lightning wielded by the northern wizards.

First flown in 1955, it became a familiar display aircraft, though only one was built. Design and development thumb The Letov LF-107 Luňák was the dominant Hungarian aerobatic glider from the late 1940s but it was being phased out by 1954 and MÖHOSZ, the organization which controlled sports flying, ordered a replacement design from MRSz, the Central Workshop of the Hungarian Aeronautical Association at Dunakeszi. The design team was headed by Ferenc Zsebő and the single seat MRSz Z-04 Béke was first flown in June 1954. Its cantilever, wooden, two part, mid-set wing was trapezoidal in plan with most of the sweep on the trailing edge. Built around a single spar, aided by a short, angled inboard, internal drag strut, each half-wing was entirely plywood covered. There were no flaps, but Göppingen-type spoilers, placed immediately behind the spars at 38% chord and one-third span, opened both above and below the wing. Immediately outboard of the spoilers split, mass- balanced, differential, fabric-covered ailerons filled the rest of the trailing edges. Unusually, the inner ailerons deflected more than the outer to more equally distribute the loads. The Béke's fuselage was a light-alloy monocoque with an elliptical cross-section, formed with light alloy frames and longerons and skinned with 800 µm thick duralumin sheet. The spars of the half-wings were connected to the fuselage by two pairs of ball and socket joints at either end of a box beam which ran across the fuselage. The cockpit placed the pilot just ahead of the wing leading edge and had a one-piece canopy. The fuselage was strengthened in this region by reinforced longerons and a double keel which also took landing gear loads from a fixed, semi- recessed monowheel, placed under the leading edge with skid ahead of it to the nose. Its rear fuselage and empennage, though an integral continuation of the forward part, was very similar to that of Zsebő's earlier MRSz Z-03 Ifjúság's rear part-fuselage. The tail unit had light-alloy structure and all fixed surfaces were light-alloy skinned. The control surfaces were fabric-covered. The Béke's horizontal tail was trapezoidal in plan as was the fin, though it had a very low forward extension on which the tailplane was mounted. The profile of the broad, unbalanced rudder was also angular and extended down to the keel, where the rudder swept up noticeably rearwards. Operational history Only one Béke was built. It first flew in June 1955 and became a popular sight at airshows in Hungary and abroad in the late 1950s, appearing at Vienna in 1956 and Tushino, Moscow in 1958.

History The Canadian Statesman was started by Reverend John M. Climie, a Scotchman and avid Son of Temperance.The earliest version of the Statesman is as The Messenger, a paper started by James E. McMillan and Alexander Begg as early as 1851. Both gentleman disposed of their interests in the paper in the mid to late 1850s, and Reverend Climie passed it on to his son William. The paper historically served the communities of Manvers, Cavan, Cadus, Burketon, Maple Grove, Starkville, Wesleyville, Zion (Hope Township), Port Hope, Clarke, Kirby, Nestleton Station, Leskard, Haydon, Pontypool, Bethany, Hampton, Cartwright, Courtice, Newcastle, Solina, Enfield, Tyrone, Newtonville, Long Sault, Enniskillen, Yelverton, Darlington, Blackstock, Elizabethville, Clarington and Bowmanville. Upon absorption of the Orono News, the paper dedicated a number of columns to just that topic, and similarly for the Newcastle Independent. During the ownership of W. R., the paper experienced a serious fire in 1895. A thoroughly Tory sheet, the paper claimed Orangeman Harcourt P. Gowan, son of Ogle R., as an editor during this period. Climie married Elizabeth Sanderson in March of 1864 and edited the paper until August 1st, 1878, when it was purchased by Moses Aaron James for the sum of $3000. Moses was born January 14th, 1848 in the parish of Bradworthy, Devonshire, England, the son of John James and Elizabeth Oke. He married Mary Jane Bray (1845 - 1927) and had 3 adult children. In the late 1800s, the Statesman was being printed out of the Bible Christian Publishing House, owned by Cephas Barker of The Bowmanville Merchant and Observer. William McKowan was the foreman for the Statesman, printing a four page double Royal sheet which sold for $1 per annum. In 1903/1904, Moses was the mayor of Bowmanville, having been a Reeve and town councillor before that. The elder James published the paper until January 1919, when his sons Norman S. B. and George W. S. succeeded him to head of the James Publishing House. M. A. would continue as chief editor, with help from “editress” Elizabeth E. Haycraft. Moses would pass away on November 22nd, 1935. “Durham County’s Great Family Journal” earned its name over the years, as Norman James would run the mechanical side of the paper, while brother George would inherit the editorship, both as equal members in the M. A. James & Sons company. When Norman passed suddenly in 1929 at the age of 47, his widow became a silent partner. George served as Mayor of Bowmanville 25 years after his father, nominated by the same gentleman. After the brothers would come John M. James, who published the paper, including his son Rick in the business starting in 1980, until it was purchased by the Metroland Printing and Publishing in 1999.

Early life Lawrence was born on September 14, 1861 in New York City. He was the son of Abraham Riker Lawrence (1832–1917) and Eliza Williams (née Miner) Lawrence (1838–1915). His younger sister was Ruth Woodhull Lawrence, who did not marry and who was a founder of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York in 1893. His paternal grandparents were Sarah Augusta (née Smith) Lawrence and John L. Lawrence, a New York State Senator, Comptroller of New York City and diplomat (who served as chargé d'Affaires at Stockholm during the absence of U.S. Minister to Sweden Jonathan Russell). Among his extended family were great-uncles, Congressmen Samuel Lawrence and William T. Lawrence, and his great-grandfather Jonathan Lawrence, a merchant and New York State Senator. He was also a direct descendant of Capt. James Lawrence, a hero of the War of 1812, and Maj. Thomas Lawrence of the British Army who received a land grant in what became Queens in 1656, Gen. Nathaniel Woodhull, and General John Tangier Smith, a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from New York. His maternal grandparents were Dr. William Miner and Julia Caroline (née Williams) Miner. Through his aunt, Ann Middleton (née Lawrence) Suydam, he was the first cousin of Jane Mesier Suydam. Career After graduating from Columbia, he went into the realty business with Bryan L. Kennelly in New York. In 1890, he was elected as a Democrat to represent Manhattan in the 114th New York State Legislature, and served as a member of the New York State Assembly from January 1 to December 31, 1891. Lawrence served as Assistant Secretary and Chief Clerk of the New York City Board of Estimate and Apportionment during the George B. McClellan Jr., William Jay Gaynor, and John Purroy Mitchel administrations until his retirement in 1924. He also served as Assistant Secretary, and then, Secretary of the New York State Board of Elections. Personal life On December 12, 1891, Lawrence was married to Lavinia Oliver (1869–1916), a daughter of Joseph Cory Oliver and Lucretia (née Phillips) Oliver. Together, they were the parents of three children: * Oliver Philips Lawrence (1892–1975), a U.S. Navy veteran. * Clement Miner Lawrence (1897–1918), who died in the Bristol Channel during World War I. * Ruth Lawrence (1902–1992), who married Stuart M. Briggs, son of G. Loring Briggs, in 1926. Ruth, who graduated from Wellesley College in 1925, was one of only five non-family members to inherit from Hetty Green, through her mentorship relationship with Green's son, Edward Howland Robinson Green. Lawrence died of bronchial pneumonia at his home, 94-08 25th Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens on November 23, 1935. He was buried at the Lawrence Family Cemetery, on 20th Road and 35th Avenue, in Astoria, Queens.

The paper changed its name to Greenbelt News Review in 1954, and it continues publishing under this name to this day. In the Cooperator's inaugural issue, Bessemer as editor outlined the paper's mission statement in a series of seven bullet points, which included policies such as \\"to remain non-partisan in politics,\\" \\"to remain neutral in religious matters,\\" \\"to print news accurately and regularly,\\" \\"to make its pages an open forum for civic affairs,\\" and above all else, \\"to create a 'Good Neighbor' spirit, promote friendship, advance the common good, and develop a 'Greenbelt philosophy' of life.\\" The Cooperator was always intended to be a publication by and for the people of Greenbelt; there were only nineteen original staff members, and the newspaper \\"actively recruited articles from the community at large.\\" The paper's history was tumultuous in its early years and \\"changed hands rapidly,\\" exemplified by a staff member's observation that \\"more often than not, the morning sun shone on the faces of the amateur journalists as they trudged home from 'putting the paper to bed.'\\" In January 1938, the paper had completed its trial period and officially elected a new editor, William R.

[...] While we are concerned with publishing news of local interest, we are also concerned with selling what we publish, and the feeling is inescapable that we have encountered some sales resistance in trying to sell the 'Cooperator.'\\" However, it has been argued that the name change was part of an effort to distance the publication from communist ideals as a response to \\"changing beliefs in the nation as a whole.\\" Heather Elizabeth Peterson argues, \\"The newspaper, from the start, was a quiet propaganda tool for promoting cooperatives,\\" and also that \\"Communism was an increasing threat, and the United States government had lost interest in cooperative experiments.\\"  References  Publications established in 1937 1937 establishments in Maryland Publications disestablished in 1954 1954 disestablishments in Maryland Defunct newspapers published in Maryland Greenbelt, Maryland Defunct weekly newspapers ","title":"Greenbelt Cooperator"},{"id":"60521334","text":"is a Japanese female professional wrestler, who wrestles for Stardom.

The true summit is 7400+ feet in elevation, and the northwest subpeak is 8,320+ feet. The mountain is situated in Chelan County, in the Wenatchee National Forest. Luahna Peak is the second highest in the Dakobed Range after Clark Mountain which is to the southeast, and Luahna lies southeast of Glacier Peak. The Richardson Glacier lies to the southeast of the summit, with the Pilz Glacier and Butterfly Glacier stretching across the northern slope. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into the White River and Napeequa River, both tributaries of the Wenatchee River. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, spires, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Luahna Peak from High Pass. True summit and Pilz Glacier on left; Luahna's northwest summit (aka \\"Chalangin Peak\\") and Butterfly Glacier on right Luahna Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, Luahna Peak experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall which feeds its glaciers.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer with optimum weather for climbing Luahna from July through September.

Hertha Firnberg (18 September 1909 in Vienna – 14 February 1994 Vienna) was an Austrian politician.  Life  Hertha Firnberg was born on 18 September 1909 as the eldest daughter of Anna, née Shamanek, and Dr. Josef Firnberg. She was born in the 18th district of Vienna, Währing. Later, the family moved to Niederrußbach in Lower Austria, where her father worked as a community doctor. After Hertha's birth, her mother gave up her job as a civil servant and gave birth to two brothers, and one sister. After elementary school, she attended the middle school in Hernals Vienna. In 1926, she joined the Association of Socialist middle school students (VSM), in which she soon became deputy chairwoman. As a student at the University of Vienna, she was a member of the Association of Socialist Students (VSSt). In 1928, she joined the Social Democratic Workers Party, the leading party of the \\"Red Vienna\\". Together with her sister, she moved into a small housing estate in the 10th district, Favoriten. Trude ran a lending library in the house. After two semesters, she changed to economic and social history. In 1930, she studied for a short time at the University of Freiburg. In February 1934, her political party was banned. In 1936, she received his doctorate with Alfons Dopsch in Vienna with a dissertation entitled \\"Wage workers and freelance work in the Middle Ages and at the beginning of modern times: A contribution to the history of agricultural wage labor in Germany.\\" The work, published, in 1935, by Dopsch, identifies her as Hertha Hon-Firnberg. She was twice married briefly before the Second World War, both marriages ended in divorce. As an active Social Democrat, Firnberg could not practice as a social researcher. She earned her living tutoring and as a freelance business journalist. From 1941 to 1945, she worked for Chic Parisienne, a leading fashion publisher; at the same time she learned bookkeeping and operational management. After the end of the war, Hertha Firnberg received a position as librarian and assistant at the University of Vienna. In addition, she learned statistics and their application to the economic and social events. In addition, she worked part- time in an advertising and statistics office. When she started working in the Lower Austrian Chamber of Labor in 1948, this was only in the reconstruction. Firnberg then became Senior Secretary, Department Head of Statistics and Head of the Study Library.  Political career  From 1959–1963, Firnberg was member for Vienna of the Federal Council, and from 1963–1983 member of the National Council. In 1967, she succeeded Rosa Jochmann as chairman of socialist women and held this position until 1981. Their political home was the SPÖ district organization in Favoriten. She has held posts in the National Council in the Finance, Education and Judiciary Committees, as well as the second chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, spokeswoman for the Socialist Group on education, science and research issues and legal reform issues, especially family law. From 1959–1970, she was also a member of the Austrian delegation to the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe, Vice-President of its Commission for Refugee and Population Affairs and member of the Asylum Advisory Council in the Ministry of the Interior. When Bruno Kreisky formed his first cabinet in 1970, Firnberg was initially appointed minister without a portfolio, but with the task of founding a federal ministry for science and research. The Ministry was established by law on 24 July 1970, Firnberg was appointed the first Minister of Science of Austria. She was only the second woman Minister in the history of Austria after Grete Rehor. In her term as a minister (1970–1983) – she also belonged to the federal governments Kreisky which enacted university reform in 1975 (University Organization Act 1975).

Reineke (born January 1, 1972) is an American chemist and Distinguished McKnight University Professor at the University of Minnesota. She designs sustainable, environmentally friendly polymer-based delivery systems for targeted therapeutics. She is the Associate Editor of ACS Macro Letters.  Early life and education  Reineke earned her bachelor's degree at University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. She moved to Arizona State University for her graduate studies and earned a Master's degree in 1998. Reineke was a PhD student at the University of Michigan, where she was supervised by Michael O'Keeffe and Omar M. Yaghi. She was awarded the Wirt and Mary Cornell Prize for Outstanding Graduate Research. Reineke joined the California Institute of Technology as an National Institutes of Health postdoctoral fellow in 2000.  Research and career  Reineke joined the University of Minnesota in 2011. Her research group focus on the design, characterisation and functionalisation of macromolecular systems. These macromolecules include biocompatible polymers that can deliver DNA for regenerative medicine as well as targeted therapeutic treatments. She was made a Lloyd H. Reyerson Professor with tenure at the University of Minnesota in 2011. Reineke has published over 140 papers. Nucleic acids can have an unparalleled specificity for targets inside a cell, but need to be compacted into nanostructures (polyplexes) that can enter cells. Reineke designs polymer-based transportation systems for nucleic acids. These polymer vehicles can improve the solubility and bioavailability of drugs. These often incorporate carbohydrates, which have an affinity for polyplexes and are non-toxic. She is a member of the University of Minnesota Centre for Sustainable Polymers, synthesising polymers from sustainable ingredients. The carbohydrate units within her polymer drug delivery systems are a widely available, renewable resource. The sustainable polymers designed by Reineke include poly(ester-thioethers).

The strike, which started on 15 April was planned to go on \\"indefinitely\\" until it was called off on 18 April, causing major disruption and leading the Portuguese Government to announce an \\"energy crisis\\" and announce extraordinary measures. The strike On 15 April, the National Union of Hazardous Goods Transporters (Sindicato Nacional de Motoristas de Matérias Perigosas, SNMMP) went on strike; by the following day, the international airports of Lisbon and Faro are forced to resort to their emergency supplies, and hundreds of filling stations across the country experience a shortage of fuel — with many reports of crowds rushing to buy fuel. On 16 April, the Government issued a civil requisition of the workers on strike, having considered that they were not meeting the essential services previously agreed on, namely, the normal supply of fuel to infrastructures like hospitals, fire stations, airports, and 40% of the filling stations within the Lisbon and Porto Metropolitan Areas. On 17 April, about 1200 filling stations (40% of those in the country) were either shut down or were out of stock, and some public transportation services had to be suppressed, namely some Transportes Sul do Tejo buses. Due to the exceptional circumstances, the Government went as far as to enforce fuel rationing (a maximum allowed of 15 liters per vehicle). The strike was called off after three days, in the morning of 18 April, after negotiations that took the best part of that night. A further 3 to 7 days of disruption in the supply of fuel was expected throughout the country even after the end of the strike action, possibly worsened due to the proximity of two public holidays, Good Friday and Easter Sunday, which fell on 19 and 21 April, respectively.

It is an edible mushroom native to most of Europe. The species derives its name from the term \\"salmonicolor,\\" meaning salmon colored in Latin. It is majorly exploited in Europe for its culinary uses. L. salmonicolor is not to be confused with Lactarius salmoneus, a North American species.  Description  L. salmonicolor can be found throughout most of Europe (see map) from September to November, the species' growing season. The fungus grows primarily near to the roots of fir trees, where it receives nutrients for its growth, participating in ectomycorrhiza with the roots of its host plant. The top of the pileus is an orange-reddish color, with rare spots of green in older decaying specimens. The cap is also slightly depressed in the center after an initial convexity, and irregularly shaped, sometimes with lobes. The surface of the cap is also smooth and viscid. On the underside of the cap, the lamellas are evenly spaced, with gills occasionally splitting as they become decurrent on the beginning of the stipe. They are salmon-orange and usually slightly lighter than the top of the cap; however they turn red after bruising. The stipe is cylindrical and more often long and slender, but rarely it can be found as short and thick. The spore deposit is pale yellow to orange in color, and spores have variations such as ridges and warts on the surface up to 0.5 µm high.  Culinary uses and edibility  This fungus, like most milky caps, is often used in cuisine. Due to its common use throughout different cultures of Europe, it has developed many common names such as \\"fungo del sangue\\" (\\"blood fungus\\" in Italian), \\"lactaire couleur de saumon\\" (\\"salmon colored milk cap\\" in French), \\"milky agaric\\" (UK), and many more. L. salmonicolor has a mild and slightly acrid flavor but becomes bitter after time.

He is best known for his service on the personal staff of Gen. Robert E. Lee during the Siege of Petersburg and the closing months of the active existence of the Army of Northern Virginia. As a commissioned veteran of the defeated Confederate cause, he changed careers and because an educator and ordained minister. When he died in 1937, he was the last survivor of General Lee's military family. Biography =American Civil War= Cooke was born on May 13, 1838, in Portsmouth, Virginia. He matriculated at the Virginia Military Institute in 1855, where records show repeated disciplinary infractions for absence from barracks without leave, assault, battery, and drunkenness. On one occasion young Cooke was expelled from V.M.I. and later reinstated. Cooke graduated in 1859 and joined the colors of the state of Virginia in April 1861. He made a lateral transfer to the Confederate Army four days after his initial enlistment. Cooke's V.M.I. record did not create any problems that affected his service in the Southern officer corps. Cooke, during his time in the officer corps of the Confederate States of America, saw senior staff service and active combat in both Virginia and the Western theater. After initial staff service with Gen. Philip St. George Cocke and Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard, Cooke became a member of the staff of Gen. Braxton Bragg. He served under Bragg at the Battle of Shiloh and its aftermath. While in this assignment, he was able to save the life of a private soldier whom Bragg had ordered to be summarily shot for breach of discipline. Cooke left Bragg's staff in August 1862 and took on various assignments in Western Virginia and in Florida. In October 1864 he was assigned to serve as assistant adjutant and inspector general, with the rank of major, of the Army of Northern Virginia. This made him a member of General Lee's personal staff, on which he served until Appomattox. Cooke assisted Lee during the Siege of Petersburg and attempted to continue this service during the final retreat from Richmond, but was wounded on April 6, 1865 at the Battle of Sailor's Creek. Lee surrendered his army on April 9, 1865, returning Cooke to civilian life. =Episcopal Church= After surviving a severe illness early in his Confederate service, Cooke was baptized into the Christian faith in July 1861. His diary shows that when he tried to help his fellow soldiers, as in the Bragg affair of May 30, 1862, he did so within a self-consciously Christian context. After his army service ended in April 1865, Cooke returned to Petersburg and began to study to become a teacher and Episcopal priest. He chose African-American education, in which he took executive roles from the start. He headed a segregated Sunday school, affiliated with St. Paul Episcopal Church in Petersburg, in 1867-1868. Cooke was then appointed principal of Petersburg's Elementary School #1, also for black children, and served in this role in 1868-1871. Elementary School #1 is said to have been the first public school for African-Americans in Virginia. Cooke also pursued religious life after the close of the war. He was ordained as a deacon of the Episcopal Church in 1871, and withdrew from public-school education at this time. He organized a series of private schools for African-Americans, all of them in Petersburg and affiliated with the Episcopal church, in 1871-1885. He was named a rector in 1873, and ordained as a priest in 1874. Cooke then served in a series of pulpits and educational leadership positions in Maryland, Kentucky, and Virginia from 1885 through 1917, being named a convocational dean in 1898. He concluded his service as rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in his birth city, Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1915-17. He died on February 4, 1937 at his home in Mathews County, Virginia. =Legacy= As a priest and rector, Cooke married twice. His first marriage, to Martha Southall Cooke (1870-1894), was childless. Cooke married Sarah Grosh in 1898; this second marriage produced three children, including Cooke's second son John Warren Cooke. In his retirement, Cooke was granted various honors consistent with his status as an ordained minister and survivor of the senior Southern officer corps. He was named chaplain general of the Confederate Memorial Association and assistant chaplain general of the United Confederate Veterans. He made himself available for interviews, by pro-Southern historians such as Douglas Southall Freeman, as a living link to General Robert E. Lee and Lee's military staff and inner circle. Cooke kept a diary throughout the Civil War, and also compiled various personal papers. These resources have been deposited in the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond.

It contains one species, Gobihadros mongoliensis. The holotype specimen was recovered from the Bayan Shireh Formation (Cenomanian-Santonian). It has an estimated length of . Discovery and naming Fossil localities in Mongolia. Gobihadros is mainly known from C and D areas Between 1993 and 2004, the Mongolian Palaeontological Center and the Japanese Hayashibara Museum of Natural Sciences excavated sites at Bayshin Tsav. Material was discovered of a basal hadrosauroid new to science. Tsogtbaatar treated this species in his dissertation of 2008. In 2019, the type species Gobihadros mongoliensis was named and described by Khishigjav Tsogtbaatar, David Bruce Weishampel, David Christopher Evans and Mahito Watabe. The generic name combines references to the Gobi Desert and the Hadrosauroidea. The specific name refers to the provenance from Mongolia. Because the describing article appeared in an electronic publication, Life Science Identifiers were needed to make the name valid. These were 38EE8AD7-AD50-44BF-B31D-B2675456556A for the genus and 2DB42EE7-6A64-4D64-AA19-E5D3453BF99C for the species. The holotype, MPC-D100/746, was found in a layer of the Bayan Shireh Formation dating from the Cenomanian-Santonian, roughly 85 million years old. It consists of a nearly complete skeleton with skull. While the postcranial skeleton was articulated, the skull was partly disintegrated. Numerous specimens have been referred to the species, the most important among them specimen MPC-D100/763, a complete articulated skull, with a hand. The specimens have partly been found in other sites in Mongolia. Combined, they make Gobihadros the most completely known basal hadrosauroid from Asia. Description Size comparison of three specimens representing growth stages Skeletal reconstructions Gobihadros was a medium sized hadrosauroid. The specimen MPC-D100/763, was approximately at the time of its death, it was however, an immature individual. Other specimens reached larger sizes; MPC-D100/744 has a long femur, indicating a length of . Nevertheless, specimen ZPAL MgD-III/3 reached long, as indicated by its femur measuring . This size appears to be the top length in fully grown individuals, as indicated by the advanced age of ZPAL MgD-III/3, which features areas of bone resorption and bone remodeling on the femur and tibia. The describing authors indicated some distinguishing traits. Gobihadros differs from all known other non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroids in possessing a double-layered tomial edge of the premaxilla and the presence of as much as three teeth per tooth position in the lower jaw. These are typical hadrosaurid traits and were concluded to have been acquired separately by the Hadrosauridae in a process of parallel evolution. Gobihadros differs from Bactrosaurus johnsoni, Probactrosaurus gobiensis, Eolambia caroljonesa, Claosaurus agilis and Tethyshadros insularis by an undulating upper profile of the ilium and a more sidewards projecting supra-acetabular crest. Gobihadros differs from T. insularis, Plesiohadros djadokhtaensis and the Hadrosauridae in possessing a conical spike-like claw of the first finger. Classification Gobihadros was placed in the Hadrosauroidea in 2019, in a basal position outside of the Hadrosauridae. Its exact affinities were unclear as it was recovered in a polytomy with many other such forms. Its existence was seen as affirming a pattern of subsequent American hadrosauroid invasions into Asia.

Life and career Born in Timaru, Stanley Foster was educated at Otago Boys' High School from 1899 to 1903, then studied medicine at the University of New Zealand. He served as house surgeon at Wellington Hospital for 15 months before being appointed senior house surgeon at Christchurch Hospital in June 1910. He undertook post-graduate studies in London from 1911 to 1913. He married Florence Chisholm in Wellington in December 1914. In the First World War he served with the rank of captain as an army surgeon on the hospital ship Maheno. He returned to New Zealand in October 1917. Before the war Foster had played one first-class cricket match for Wellington while working in the hospital there. In January 1919 he opened the batting for Canterbury and made 31 and 13 when Canterbury beat Wellington to regain the Plunket Shield in Wellington. In December 1919 he was selected to play for Canterbury against Wellington in Christchurch. During the first day's play, while Wellington were batting, he was called away to perform an urgent surgical operation in Waikari, a small town north of Christchurch. As Foster had neither batted nor bowled, the Wellington captain allowed a full substitute, and Harry Whitta took his place in the Canterbury team. It was Foster's last first-class match, though he continued to play club cricket in Christchurch. He later represented Hawke's Bay at the New Zealand Cricket Council's annual meetings in Christchurch for many years. A pioneer of neurosurgery in New Zealand, Foster was the director of surgical services at Christchurch Hospital from 1934 to 1946. He served as President of the New Zealand branch of the BMA in 1939-40, and as Chairman of the New Zealand Medical Council from 1948 to 1957. He was awarded the CMG in the 1953 Coronation Honours. Foster was a prominent Rotarian in Christchurch for many years. He was appointed district governor of New Zealand Rotary in 1935.

Treating is an electoral fraud criminal offence in the United Kingdom. Treating occurs when an election candidate or their agents offer material incentives for people to vote for them or to abstain from voting. It is a triable either way offence with the sentence being up to either an unlimited fine, one year imprisonment or both.  History  Historically, the issue of treating at elections was dealt with under common law. In 1840, the House of Lords debated putting treating on a statutory footing similar to bribery, but argued that poor electors should be entitled to receive refreshments from candidates if they took a day off work to vote. An early example of treating which led to an election petition to the Election court which nullified an election result was in 1868 in Youghal where the winner Christopher Weguelin was found guilty of treating for buying food and drink for voters in exchange for their vote.  Current offence  The current offence of treating was created under section 114 of the Representation of the People Act 1983. It stated if election candidates or their agents offered any food, drink, entertainment or any payment in order to make any attempt to prevent voting or to sway voters to vote for them, then they have committed the offence of treating. The recipient is also guilty of the offence if they accept it. The Crown Prosecution Service stated they would only prosecute treating if it was in the public interest and would not prosecute in situations such as if it could not have affected the election process, if it was a genuine mistake or did not go against the spirit of the Representation of the People Act. In 1911, Seymour King, an MP with 25 years' service, lost his seat after he was discovered to have given coal to the poor and sweets to children to commemorate his length of service, which counted as treating. In 2014, the police received four reports of the alleged offence. In the 2010s, there have been some modern examples of the offence. In April 2015, the Mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman (Tower Hamlets First) was found guilty of a number of electoral fraud offences, including treating, during the 2014 Tower Hamlets mayoral election which resulted in an election court declaring the result of the election null and void leading to Rahman being removed from office. An accusation of treating was seen in the 2015 United Kingdom general election where the UK Independence Party candidate for Southampton Itchen, Kim Rose was accused of treating for giving out sausage rolls at a community event; however, Hampshire Constabulary said they would take no action over the allegation. The UKIP leader Nigel Farage criticised the allegation of treating.

A group of radical activists persuaded approximately 3,000 protesters at a July 1 rally against the US Supreme Court's ruling on sodomy to block traffic in Sheridan Square. Robinson and several friends then led a parade of 7,000 from Battery Park to Greenwich Village, and a demonstration by 2,500 at Lincoln Center. By fall they decided they would be more effective as a named independent group and called themselves after the British comedy film The Lavender Hill Mob. Robinson often used political \\"zaps\\", chaotic and theatrical interventions intended to attract the attention of the press. In October 1986, the Mob disrupted the Alfred E Smith Dinner, a charity event attended by wealthy New York Roman Catholics and Cardinal John O'Connor. They distributed leaflets and shouted, \\"Gays and lesbians will not be silenced!\\" To gain entry to the dinner Robinson wrote a check but stopped payment on it before it could be cashed. In November of that year, the group disrupted a mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City. Two members dressed as priests and another nine unfurled a banner as O'Connor gave his sermon. In February 1987, they interrupted a conference in Atlanta put on by the US federal government that included a number of other gay rights organizations, causing the event to shut down early. Some wearing gray uniform shirts with stenciled numbers and the pink triangle to evoke the internment of gays in concentration camps, the Mob accused the panelists, who were speaking on how to address the AIDS pandemic, of being Nazis and perpetrating a genocide. They were particularly concerned that the discussion did not include black and Hispanic representatives. The group published a newsletter in 1987, Lavender Hill News.

The film stars Ma Dong-seok, Kim Mu-yeol and Kim Sung-kyu. The plot is based upon a true story. The narrative revolves around three characters: a serial killer, the gangster who was almost a victim of the killer and the cop who wants to arrest the killer. The cop and the gangster decide to join forces to catch the killer, but face challenges from their respective enemies at work. The film was released theatrically in South Korea on 15 May 2019, and was also screened in the \\"Midnight Screenings\\" section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival as well as at the 2019 Fantasia International Film Festival. Plot A man's car is hit by a stranger who kills him when he gets down to take pictures of the damage for claiming car insurance. Jung Tae- suk is an honest cop who goes through the crime scene and suspects it to be the work of a serial killer, but his senior does not believe him. Gangster Jang Dong-soo is on his way home after a meeting when the same killer hits his car and eventually tries to kill him. A brutal fight ensues, leaving both of them injured. Finally, the killer escapes after knocking Dong-soo with his car. Dong-soo is admitted to the hospital, and his henchmen assume that the attack was committed by a rival gang, whom they counter-attack. However, Dong- soo believes the killer was not a rival gang member as his moves seemed to be random and purposeless. Tae-suk visits Dong-soo at the hospital and asks him to cooperate so that he can catch the killer for him, but Dong-soo does not comply. Instead, Dong-soo orders his men to find the killer through a sketch, and they manage to find his car and a knife. Dong-soo eventually informs Tae- suk of the findings, and they decide to team up to catch the mysterious killer. Dong-soo agrees to provide manpower and cover expenses — but on the condition that the killer belongs to the one who finds him first. Dong-soo wants to kill him for revenge while Tae-suk wants to arrest him in order to solve five connected murder cases and then eventually get promoted. Meanwhile, Dong-soo orders his right-hand man, Kwon Oh-sung, to kill his rival Heo Sang- do with the killer's knife that already has the blood imprints of the killer's previous victims. An enraged Tae-suk gets into a fight with Dong-soo upon learning what he has done as the killing is confirmed to be the serial killer's work and the case would get transferred to the Major Case Squad. Dong-soo visits Sang-do's funeral where the killer also turns up informing Sang-do's second-in-command man that it was Dong-soo who actually killed Sang- do with the killer's knife. When Tae-suk and Dong-soo check the killer's car for any evidence, they are attacked by Sang-do's henchmen. A fight ensues, resulting in the death of Sang-do's right-hand man. Dong-soo gets him buried and clears the scene. Tae-suk is now assigned to investigate a kidnapping case, and, while solving it, he spots the killer. A chase ensues, but the killer flees. Through the forensic tests, Tae-suk discovers the killer to be a missing person. He informs Dong-soo about this and lets him hear a voice clip to confirm the missing person to be the killer. Later, Dong-soo helps a school girl by giving her his umbrella and soon learns that she has been killed and his umbrella was found at the crime scene. They start looking for the killer and eventually find him in a car. In an ensuing chase, the killer manages to kill Oh-sung but is finally captured and incapacitated by Dong-soo. The gangster takes the killer away to torture and kill him, but Tae-suk tracks them and crashes his car into the hideout, hitting Dong-soo unconscious and arresting the killer. With no conclusive evidence against the killer whose name is revealed to be Kang Kyung-ho, Dong-soo, being the sole survivor of his attack, testifies against him and proves him guilty when scars caused by Dong- soo's stabbing due to self-defense are demonstrated on Kyung-ho's body. The court sentences Kyung-ho to death; however, Dong-soo is also arrested due to his criminal activities. Tae-suk is finally promoted while Dong-soo gets transferred to the prison where Kyung-ho is also kept — the condition that Dong-soo had requested Tae-suk to fulfill in exchange for the testimony followed by his arrest. In prison, while Kyung-ho is having a shower, Dong-soo closes the tap and approaches him with a smile and a rope in his hands.

The film will also be shown out of competition in the Midnight Screenings section at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. =Reception= The film received positive critical reviews. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of 96% based on 27 reviews. The critics consensus states \\"An odd couple cop thriller with a twist, The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil tells its entertaining story with a blend of humor and hard-hitting action\\". On review aggregator website Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100 based on 7 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Leslie Felperin of The Guardian stated \\"lthough its final act shreds credulity, and the structure is a bit wonky, this pulpy crime thriller from Korea is still a real kick in the head. Like so many of the genre that hail from Seoul and its suburbs, this one punches well above its weight with an inventive reworking of well-worn plot tropes and slick production values.\\" Jessica Kiang of Variety commented \\"Korea has dominated the midnight-movie/genre slots at international festivals so thoroughly of late that it’s hard not to view Lee Won-tae’s “The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil” in terms of its shortcomings in comparison to the likes of “Train to Busan,” “The Age of Shadows,” “The Wailing” and so on. But what this fun, slick but slightly forgettable hardboiled actioner lacks in terms of the energy, originality and inventiveness of a true Korean genre classic, it almost makes up for as a showcase for the burly charisma of star Don Lee, aka Ma Dong-Seok.\\" Cary Darling of Houston Chronicle added \\"Director/writer Lee Won-tae, for whom this is only his second feature, keeps the pace moving swiftly with this cats-and-mouse game, showing off an energetic sensibility that heralds a new voice on the South Korean film scene. It’s no wonder that “The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil,” which was invited for a midnight-screening slot at the recently concluded Cannes Film Festival, has been picked up by Hollywood for an English-language remake with Sylvester Stallone producing.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire noted \\"In broad strokes, this premise has already been explored to death, but “The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil” breathes new life into it by elevating at least two of its three major characters far above their archetypes.\\" Michael Leader of Little White Lies wrote \\"While not wildly original – Asian crime cinema has mined these uncommon team-ups and ethical ambiguities for decades – The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil pulls off its familiar twists and turns with style and verve. An expansive, electric-neon aerial shot at the start of the film places us firmly in Michael Mann territory, and the machismo of the film’s protagonists spills over into director Lee Won-tae’s amped-up aesthetic, from flashy scene transitions and montages to generous helpings of slow-mo, crunchy fight choreography and a driving rock soundtrack throughout. The film is slick, stylish and consistently entertaining, but it would be nothing without its headline lead performances.\\" Richard Whittaker of Austin Chronicle wrote \\"Yes, it's car crashes and fight sequences and dry jokes, but it's a mix that will make you wow, wince and guffaw in just the right amounts, all carried off with a gritty style. It may lull a little in the final act, but that's just setting up one of the decade's low-key finest payoffs.\\" Ben Travis of Empire wrote \\"There’s not much going on beneath the energetic surface, but for the most part The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil is a fast-paced, entertaining thriller buoyed by two engaging leads\\". Trevor Johnson of Time Out gave the film three stars out of five, commenting \\"This muscular South Korean crime thriller is neon-lit catnip for fans of the genre... A solid, if not quite exceptional, time- passer\\". Jason Gorber of /Film gave the film 6.5 point of 10, stating \\"As it stands, this is a movie with a great idea and pretty decent execution, one where the fists fly, the cars crash, and you actually care about the characters involved. With a bit of tweaking, especially with regard to the Devil character to make him (or her!) more chilling and compelling, there’s the opportunity to up the ante even further and craft a magnificent film. For now, we’ve got a great bit of genre fun, a movie that at once evokes the rich history of this kind of film with its iconic character types, yet does so with enough originality and confidence to make The Gangster, The Cop, The Devil a powerful tale of its own\\".  Remake  On 5 May 2019, it was announced that Sylvester Stallone and his Balboa Productions partner Braden Aftergood will produce the remake of The Gangster, the Cop, the Devil, with Ma Dong-seok reprising his role and producing the film under BA Entertainment.

He was the son-in-law of Johan van Oldenbarnevelt. Biography Cornelis was the son of Adriaan van der Mijle, ambachtsheer of Bleskensgraaf and Dubbeldam, and counselor of William the Silent, and Magdalena van Egmond. After the death of his father his mother sent him to his uncle and namesake in Leiden where he first studied at a Latin school and enrolled next at Leiden University as a student in the Classics on 16 May 1591. He studied under Justus Lipsius and Joseph Justus Scaliger, Paulus Merula, Bonaventura Vulcanius, Julius van Beyma and Franciscus Junius (the elder). Among his study friends were Hugo Grotius, Petrus Scriverius and Daniel Heinsius. He also got into contact with Louise de Coligny, the widow of William the Silent and her son Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange, the future stadtholder, who was also a student in Leiden at the time.The princess wrote Coelum non solum in Cornelis liber amicorum; Cf. Bartelds, p. 1193 After completing his studies Cornelis made the Grand Tour of Europe, as was usual for young men of his aristocratic station at the time, and he visited France, Germany and Italy, and was enrolled in the university of the Republic of Geneva from 25 May 1597.Bartelds, pp. 1192-1193 After his return van der Mijle married Maria Johanna van Oldenbarnevelt, daughter of Land's Advocate of Holland Johan van Oldenbarnevelt and Maria van Utrecht in 1603. They were married by Johannes Wtenbogaert, the future leader of the Remonstrants. They would have six children: Adriaan, Jan and Cornelia (both died early), Arnold, Magdalena (who would marry Charles de Loges, captain in the guards of the Dutch States Army), and Geertruida. Bartelds, pp. 1193, 1198; Van der Aa, pp. 1215-1216 Van der Mijle was made a counselor of the stadtholder Maurice, Prince of Orange in 1603 and the States of Holland and West Friesland appointed him as a member of the board of regents of Leiden University in the same year. As regent he was soon embroiled in the controversy between the theologians Jacobus Arminius and Franciscus Gomarus, who taught at the university. After the death of Arminius in 1609 the regents had to find a successor. They first decided on Conrad Vorstius, but this met with so much opposition, that this appointment was never realized. Eventually, through the intermediation of van der Mijle, both Johannes Polyander (who succeeded Gomarus) and Simon Episcopius (who succeeded Arminius) were appointed.Bartelds, pp. 1193-1194 Oldenbarnevelt functioned as mentor for van der Mijle in the art of diplomacy. He was made part of the delegation that negotiated the Twelve Years' Truce in 1608. After the Truce came in force he was sent to the Republic of Venice as a special envoy to try and establish diplomatic relations with that sister-republic, at the suggestion of the Venetian ambassador in France, Antonio Foscarini. On the way to Venice he spoke with king Henri IV of France, who was very much in favor of an alliance between the two republics, France and England. Henri at this occasion bestowed a knighthood on van der Mijle. The Doge and Senate of Venice did not agree to a formal alliance, but agreed to send Tomaso Contarini as ambassador to the Dutch Republic. In Venice van der Mijle also became acquainted with Paolo Sarpi and Domenico Molino, who would remain friends with whom he kept up a correspondence in later years.Bartelds, p. 1194 Soon after his return in The Hague in 1610 van der Mijle was (at the suggestion of the Dutch ambassador in France, Francis van Aarssens) again sought out for a diplomatic mission, this time to France, in connection with the looming crisis of the War of the Jülich Succession. This was again a success, even though just before his arrival in Paris king Henri was assassinated. But van der Mijle managed to convince the regent, Queen Marie de' Medici to continue the alliance with the Republic.Bartelds, p. 1195 The Queen-regent was not enamored of the Dutch ambassador Aarssens and demanded his recall. This was finally forced by the French ambassador Benjamin Aubery du Maurier, after which Oldenbarnevelt appointed Gideon van Boetzelaer as his successor. That gentleman was not an experienced diplomat, so van der Mijle was sent as an envoy extraordinary to support him at the court of the new king Louis XIII of France in 1614. He negotiated a draft treaty with the Venetian representative Christofforo Suriano in The Hague. After the death of his cousin Heyman van der Mijle, from whom he inherited the ambachtsheerlijkheid De Myle and St. Anthonispolder, van de Mijle was made a member of the Holland ridderschap (college of Nobles, part of the States of Holland) in July 1613, followed by his appointment as a member of the Council of State in 1614. In this period the Bestandstwisten (Truce Quarrels) reached a crescendo and van der Mijle became embroiled in a pamphlet war with Aarssens, who had become a mortal enemy of his father-in- law, Oldenbarnevelt, and attacked both with mostly anonymous polemics. The two gentlemen denounced each other before the States General of the Netherlands in the summer of 1618, prompting the States General to appoint a commission of inquiry.Bartelds, p. 1196 But then Oldenbarnevelt was arrested by stadtholder Maurice on 29 August 1618, together with Grotius and Rombout Hogerbeets, leading to the Trial of Oldenbarnevelt, Grotius and Hogerbeets. Van der Mijle first tried to get Oldenbarnevelt released together with his brother-in-law Reinoud van Brederode, president of the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland, but he felt soon so threatened that he fled to France. This made him suspect in the eyes of the new regime and he was successively driven from all of his offices (the Council of State, the ridderschap and the board of regents of Leiden University). He was not arrested, but given a kind of house arrest, first in Goeree and later in Beverwijk. He was erroneously suspected of implication in the conspiracy of the sons of Oldenbarnevelt against Maurice in 1623, for which Reinier van Oldenbarnevelt was beheaded. But he was finally rehabilitated after the death of Maurice and the appointment of Frederick Henry as his successor.Bartelds, pp. 1196-1197 On 7 April 1632 he and his brother-in-law Brederode were again allowed to take their places in the ridderschap of Holland. He was also reinstated as regent of Leiden University on 17 April 1640.Bartelds, p. 1198 Van der Mijle died in November 1642. His eulogy was read by Marcus Zuerius van Boxhorn at Leiden University. He was buried in the Hofkapel at the Binnenhof in The Hague.

She is the Director of Public Policy and Strategic Initiatives for the Minnesota Housing Partnership, \\"working on housing policy at the federal, state, and local levels.\\"  Early life  Glidden was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota but grew up in Wichita, Kansas. She received her undergrad from Augustana University before completing a law degree at University of Iowa College of Law. Later, she completed a master's degree at Humphrey School of Public Affairs.  Career  Glidden worked as an employment and civil rights lawyer for over a decade. In 2005, Glidden ran for Minneapolis City Council to represent the 8th district. The 8th district is located in South Minneapolis and encompasses the Lyndale, Kingfield, Bryant, Bancroft, Regina and Field neighborhoods. Her husband served as her campaign manager and the campaign began shortly after they returned from their honeymoon. She won and served three terms, including serving as City Council Vice President from 2013 to 2017. In 2017, she chose not to run for reelection. She cited leaving because it was time for a new face and she was impressed with the other progressive candidates who were running, including her former policy aid Andrea Jenkins who ultimately won the seat. On this decision, she said, \\"I personally believe that these are not forever jobs. Part of the excitement of local politics is the opportunity for change and new ideas and new energy and all the things that can come with having someone new in this seat. ... I knew also that there were multiple fantastic candidates out there, who had progressive values, who had a similar outlook to me, although they would have different background and experiences and bring a different outlet to maybe just doing the job. And at the end of the day, Andrea Jenkins, when she announced she kind of cleared the field, I think because of the very special candidate that she is. The longer sometimes you hold on, it’s harder for some of those people to enter.\\" She did not support Jacob Frey in his successful mayoral election in 2017. Minneapolis uses ranked voting, a policy she advocated for, and she made a public statement listing her choices. They did not always agree when working together on the city council, but she has said there was \\"never a hard word exchanged between us of a personal nature.\\" She was an active supported of the $15 minimum wage movement in Minneapolis and considers it one of her greatest accomplishments as a city council member. In 2018, Glidden became Director of Strategic Initiatives and Policy at the Minnesota Housing Project, an organization striving to \\"improve the quality, affordability and availability of housing in Minnesota and beyond.\\" Glidden was a recipient of the Equal Justice Award from the Council on Crime and Justice (2011) and an American Marshall Memorial Fellow (2004). In 2013, she was a Bush fellow for 24 months, working \\"to offer local elected leaders the skills, tools and competencies they need to tackle racism in a way that leads to substantive public policy change.\\" This fellowship included a two-week trip to Brazil to \\"explore ways city leaders can have an impact on reducing racial disparities.\\"  Personal life  She lives in the Kingfield neighborhood of Minneapolis with her husband Eric and two young daughters.

It is part of the collection of the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. Composition The painting depicts \\"the interior of a woolshed with the owner and his wife watching the fleece being weighed, a shorn stud ram and an unshorn one.\\" The painting has a basic triangular form—\\"almost a frieze inside a pediment\\"—with the scales at the apex of the triangle. Lambert claimed to have had the painting in mind for 25 years, a period that suggests it may be a riposte to Tom Roberts' Shearing the Rams. Jim Davidson stated that \\"Certainly it could not be more different in spirit: instead of the celebration of strong masculine labour, this painting endorses wealth and the social order.\\" Lambert painted the work in 8 days. Despite this Lambert was proud of the attention to detail in the work such as the \\"beams and the swallow droppings on the beams, corrugated iron, oil drum, kerosene tin, wool bale, brand on the wool bale\\" that created \\"a masterpiece of small portrait grouping\\". Provenance The painting was commissioned by Leigh Sadlier Falkiner, the owner of Wanganella station, near Deniliquin in the Riverina region of New South Wales. The locality of Wanganella was later named for the station. Despite commissioning the work, Falkiner disliked the way he and his wife, Beatrice, were portrayed by Lambert and declined to purchase the painting. The painting was later sold to Sir Baldwin Spencer for £600. It was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia in 1966. Reception Contemporary critics were largely favourable as a painting although some claimed it lacked emotion and sympathy for the subject.

TET highlights the relative contributions of biological inheritance (including human evolutionary adaptations), environmental influences on neurobiology, and culture to moral development and reasoning. TET proposes three ethics that are the foundation or motivation for all ethics: security (or safety), engagement, and imagination. They differ not only in the recency of evolutionary development but also in their relative capacity to override one another. The three ethics =Security= The security ethic is based in the oldest part of the brain, involving the R-complex or the extrapyramidal system. The security ethic is triggered stressors that activate primal instincts and fight-or-flight responses. These are concerned or centered on safety, survival, and thriving in an environment (or biological system). With these systems present at birth, the security ethic is conditioned during sensitive periods of development (such as infancy), life experience, and trauma. Studies have shown that a dearth of touch in early years result in an underdevelopment of serotonin receptors. Children with faulty serotonin receptors are susceptible to somatosensory affectional deprivation, a condition related to depression, violent behavior, and stimulus seeking. As an adult, if serotonin receptors are not properly functioning, an individual is more prone to depression and anxiety. If receptor are damaged, and one becomes fixated at this ethic, they can be seen as cold, closed-minded, and aggressive. This ethic is most responsible for racism and hate towards outside groups. =Engagement= The ethic of engagement is centered in the upper limbic system or the visceral-emotional nervous system. The limbic system allows for external and internal emotional signaling and is critical to emotion, identity, memory for ongoing experience, and an individual's sense of reality and truth. The ethic of engagement refers to relational attunement in the moment, which the stress response prevents, focusing on social bonding. It relies significantly on caregiver influence for its development in early childhood. The engagement ethic is strongly associated with the hormone oxytocin, which has a strong presence during breastfeeding between a mother and child. Oxytocin is essential for building the trust between mother and child. =Imagination= The imagination ethic allows a person to step away from the impetuous emotional responses of the older parts of the brain and consider alternative actions based on logic and reason. It is centered in the neocortex and related thalamic structures, including the frontal lobes used for reasoning and judgement skills. It is focused on the outside world and allows for the integration and coordination of the other parts of the brain to allow for imaginative thinking and strategic problem solving. The ethic of imagination involves integrating internal information with external information, allowing an adult to acknowledge and possibly reject more emotional responses from the security or engagement ethics. The imagination ethic can build on the self-protective states of the security ethic (vicious or detached imagination) or of the prosocial engagement ethic (communal imagination). Moral functioning TET looks back to people in the Pleistocene era and the environment of evolutionary adaptedness (EEA), relating to their early-life supports and its relation to moral functioning. The long term breastfeeding, the constant holding or touching, the frequency of caregivers other than mother, multiage playgroups, and the quick responsiveness to cries during that era is the type of caregiving that supports our biological systems. Current caregiving such as hospital births, solo sleeping, and physical isolation are not the types of early life caregiving to which humans are adapted. TET also mentions \\"dearth of touch\\" or faulty serotonin receptors affects society, and how they affect our society. There are higher rates of depression and anxiety, which both affect general and moral functioning. There are two categories of the effects of childrearing on moral functioning, dispositional and situational effects. There are two hypotheses relating to the dispositional effects of childrearing on moral functioning. First, \\"a personality may cohere around being more or less oriented to each of the three ethics\\". Second, \\"during critical periods of brain and personality development 'attachment' and 'trust' aspects of personality development are deeply influenced, affecting the structure and wiring of brain systems\\". Lastly, there are situational effects. These relate to the idea that \\"moral personality has a dispositional signature within particular situations: person and situation interact with dispositional regularity\\". Criticisms Although not directed at TET specifically, Cesario et al. argue that the triune brain theory upon which TET is based provides an inaccurate account of brain evolution.

Punu came to power in 46 AD when his brother Wudadihou died. At the time the Xiongnu were suffering experiencing a severe drought in their territory as well as raids from the Wuhuan. Punu's uncle Sutuhu offered to act as an agent to ask for aid from the Han dynasty. When Punu's officers heard of this they recommended that Sutuhu be arrested and executed. Sutuhu received warning of their advice to Punu and in retaliation gathered some 50,000 men to attack the officers. Afterwards, Sutuhu moved south to the Ordos region. In the winter of 48/49 AD, Sutuhu gained an alliance with the Han, and proclaimed himself Bi Chanyu. In 49 AD, Bi sent his brother Mo to attack Punu. They captured Punu's younger brother Aojian and returned with 10,000 captives as well as thousands of livestock. Two of Punu's chiefs also defected to join Bi. Punu was forced to relocate north across the Gobi Desert. Punu's brother escaped from Bi but decided to set himself up as another chanyu. He was defeated by Punu within a few months. In 51 AD, Punu sent envoys to negotiate with the Han in Wuwei Commandery, but they were turned back. Punu sent envoys again in 52 and 55 AD to no avail. At the same time Punu subjugated the oasis states of the Western Regions and forced them to send tribute to the Xiongnu court. In 62 AD, the Northern Xiongnu made a major raid but was repelled. In 73 AD, Dou Gu led a force of 12,000 against the Xiongnu and defeated Huyan in modern northeastern Xinjiang. In 75 AD, the Xiongnu besieged Jushi and Chen Mu was killed by the locals. Punu died at an unspecified time and the next mentioned chanyu of the Northern Xiongnu was Youliu, one of his descendants.

Moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens) was first described in 1810 by Robert Brown as Panicum spinescens , and subsequently transferred to Pseudoraphis by Joyce W. Vickery in 1950 . Pseudoraphis spinescens is native to floodplains in Asia and Australasia , it is a C4 species, requiring seasonal cycles of prolonged, deep flooding interspersed with drying to achieve maximum growth and reproduction . Between flood events, P. spinescens forms a deep thatch of collapsed dry stems until flooding recurs and growth recommences . A study in southeastern Australia found that P. spinescens does not have a viable long-lived seed bank in floodplain soil , presumably regenerating from vegetative propagules and rootstocks . In the Murray-Darling Basin, prior to regulation of the Murray River, extensive Pseudoraphis spinescens dominated floodplain marshes existed in areas that were typically seasonally flooded for 5-9 months duration in most years, to a minimum water depth of 0.5 m, and completely dry during late summer and autumn . Pseudoraphis spinescens is an important species in floodplain marsh ecosystems, providing habitat and food for a range of fauna including birds , frogs , fish and insects , and key ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling and primary productivity . Significance in the Murray Darling Basin The Barmah Forest Ramsar site on the Murray River floodplain in northern Victoria (Australia) is a bioregionally significant seasonal floodplain wetland, historically the most extensive areas of Moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens) plains in the Murray-Darling Basin occurred in this region . The extent of floodplain marshes in Barmah forest has been severely reduced since European settlement, with the introduction of large grazing animals and the diversion of water from the Murray River . Floodplain areas previously dominated by aquatic species such as Moira grass (Pseudoraphis spinescens), common reed (Phragmites australis) and cumbungi (Typha spp.) are now covered with species adapted to lower levels of flooding, mainly river red gums (Eucalyptus camaldulensis) and giant rush (Juncus ingens) . A 2017 CSIRO analysis found that the management changes most likely to result in an increase in the current extent of Moira grass plains in Barmah National Park, over the next 10 years are reducing grazing, and increasing flood duration and depth . Most significantly, the removal of the large population of feral horses in Barmah National Park is estimated to result in a 61% increase in the current extent of the Moira grass plains . An analysis of the rate of vegetation change in Barmah Forest, published in 2014, predicted that if no management actions were taken, Pseudoraphis spinescens dominated grassy wetlands would become locally extinct by 2026 . > :Water regime for vigorous growth ::Maintenance: Flooding for vigorous > grasslands of Pseudoraphis spinescens should be seasonal, annual and fairly > predictable, with a seasonal dry phase.

History The original temple dates back to early 6th century, in China's Liang dynasty (502-557), it has a history of more than 1510 years. Xiao Yan, an emperor of the Liang dynasty and a devout Buddhist, went in for large-scale construction of Buddhist temples. Baosheng Temple is the architecture from that period. In its heyday, it had more than 5,000 halls and rooms as well as thousands of monks, and its area covers half the town. In the summer of 1918, Ye Shengtao invited Gu Jiegang to the temple and they founded the clay statues of the Eighteen Arhats were made by a famous sculptor named \\"Yang Huizhi\\" () in the Tang dynasty (618-907). They wrote articles in newspapers and magazines calling for the protection of these cultural relics, but they didn't attract the attention of the local government. In 1928, half of the Mahavira Hall collapsed for neglect, 9 statues of the Eighteen Arhats were demolished. Two years later, architect Fan Wenzhao designed and built the Arhat Hall to house the remaining statues of Eighteen Arhats. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Imperial Japanese Army invaded the temple and smashed the clay statues of the Four Heavenly Kings. In 1961, the arhat statues of Baosheng Temple were listed among the first batch of \\"Major National Historical and Cultural Sites\\" by the State Council of China. National treasures The 9 statues of Eighteen Arhats created by Yang Huizhi of the Tang dynasty (618-907) are well preserved after a thousand years. A stone Dhvajo named Zunsheng Tuoluoni Jingzhou () made in the Song dynasty (960-1279) is housed in the temple. Statues of Buddha and Buddhist sutras were carved on its surface. An iron bell which was cast in late Ming dynasty (1368-1644) and early Qing dynasty (1644-1911) is collected in the temple. The temple has a 1500-year-old and tall ginkgo tree.

Charles Hummel may have been the supervising architect. The 2-story, Renaissance Revival building was constructed of brick and sandstone by contractors Allen & Barber, and it featured a corner entry at Idaho Avenue and Second Street. The ground floor entry and a Second Street entry to the second floor both were framed by shallow brick pilasters supporting simple stone capitals. Four corbelled brick chimneys extended above the second floor parapet. The Meridian Exchange Bank and a barbershop occupied the ground floor, and the Independent Telephone Exchange rented the second floor. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) in 1982. With After its listing on the NRHP, the building was renovated, and it bears little resemblance to its original design by Tourtellotte & Co. The second floor was removed, and a cement cornice was added above the first floor. Window fenestrations were redesigned with arched, keystoned brickwork. The corner entry was retained, although it was redesigned to include an arch and triple keystone. The renovation may have happened while Elite Cleaners occupied the building. The Vault cigar shop opened in the building in 2014. Meridian Exchange Bank Meridian Exchange Bank was organized in 1902 as a branch of Capital State Bank, located in Boise. Vernon T. Craig helped to found the bank and served as an early cashier. Craig sold his bank holdings in 1905 and moved to Emmett, Idaho, where he founded the Bank of Emmett. Craig helped to incorporate the town of Meridian in 1903. By 1906 Meridian Exchange Bank had outgrown its original location, and the 2-story Tourtellotte & Co. design was constructed. The bank added 75 safe deposit boxes in 1910. In 1912 Meridian Exchange Bank merged with the Bank of Meridian and formed the First National Bank of Meridian. The bank had vacated the building by 1938, and Elite Cleaners was established at the site.

History Although the majority of combatants had heavy field artillery prior to the outbreak of the First World War, none had adequate numbers of heavy guns in service, nor had they foreseen the growing importance of heavy artillery once the Western Front stagnated and trench warfare set in. Since aircraft of the period were not yet capable of carrying large diameter bombs the burden of delivering heavy firepower fell on the artillery. Two sources of heavy artillery suitable for conversion to field use were surplus coastal defense guns and naval guns. However, a paradox faced artillery designers of the time, while large caliber naval guns were common, large caliber land weapons were less common due to their weight, complexity, and lack of mobility. Large caliber field guns often required extensive site preparation because the guns had to be broken down into multiple loads light enough to be towed by a horse team or the few traction engines of the time and then reassembled before use. Building a new gun could address the problem of disassembling, transporting and reassembling a large gun, but it didn't necessarily address how to convert existing heavy weapons to make them more mobile. Rail transport proved to be the most practical solution because the problems of heavy weight, lack of mobility and reduced setup time were addressed. Design The Canon de 305 modèle 1893/96 à berceau started life as eight Canon de 305 mm Modèle 1893/96 naval guns salvaged from two pre-dreadnought battleships the Iéna and Liberté that sank after suffering internal explosions while in port. The guns were typical built-up guns of the period which consisted of a rifled liner reinforced by layers of hoops. The guns used a Welin interrupted screw breech and fired separate loading bagged charges and projectiles. To load the gun the barrel was lowered to -6° and there was a collapsible shell handling trolley at the rear. Each gun sat on a rectangular steel base which was suspended from two railroad bogies with four axles each. The number of axles was determined by the weight limit for European railways of 17 tonnes per axle. The howitzers had a hydro-pneumatic cradle recoil system with two recoil cylinders below the barrel and one recuperator on top. When the gun fired the cradle recoiled up a slightly inclined rear deck which helped return the howitzer to battery after firing. The guns were mounted on Berceau style rail mounts produced by Batignolles which consisted of five steel cross ties with integral spades which were driven between the railroad ties. On top of these steel ties, two heavy girders were laid parallel to the tracks which bolted to the ties. The girders were equipped with 12 sets of flanges that matched the same number on the carriage. When the carriage was over the flanges the carriage was fastened to the girders and the ties. Once the platform was ready, the piece could be anchored in minutes and ready to fire. The ties and girders supported the weight of the carriage and absorbed the gun's recoil, the track did not have to be reinforced. A pit was also dug under the gun's breech and lined with a steel box to allow the gun to recoil at high angles of elevation, which took about 3 hours. The Batignolles mounts also employed car-traverse which allowed for limited traverse by shifting the carriage on its bogies. When the United States entered the First World War a license to produce Berceau style rail mounts was negotiated with Batignolles and the carriage used by the 12-inch M1895 railway gun was similar. World War I After the barrels became worn out they were bored out to fire 320 mm (13 in) ammunition during 1918–1919 and were designated Canon de 320 modèle 1917 à berceau. These were placed in reserve between the wars. World War II Eight Canon de 320 modèle 1917 à berceau were mobilized by the French Army during the Second World War. The Germans gave them the designation 32 cm Kanone (Eisenbahn) 652 (f).

In 1995, the band disbanded. However, many years later, in 2013, the band reunited with a new moniker. Now going by Outrage A.D., Richer and Marion reprised their positions as Drummer and Guitarist respectively. Neither Robillard brother returned to the band, which led the position to be filled by Nicolas Miquelon on Bass. With the new lineup, the band entered the studio at Apartment 2 Recording Studio and recorded their debut studio album, New Blood. Following the release of the album, the band was featured on a compilation called Christian Brutal Death Metal, Volume 1. On October 16, 2017, it was announced that the band had signed with Nosral Recordings and were re-releasing the album through the label. In early 2018, the band released the single \\"New Blood\\", alongside a lyric video. On February 23, 2018, New Blood was re-released via Nosral Recordings.

Biography  Julia Marcus was born on 24 December 1905 in St. Gallen, Switzerland. Marcus began her dancing career as a cabaret dancer in Switzerland and Germany. She went on to study under Rudolph von Laban, Elisabeth Duncan, and Mary Wigman. In 1931 she joined the Berlin City Opera ballet company under the direction of Lizzie Maudrik. Marcus was known for dark, dramatic performances in eccentric and expressionist dance. Her original works include Mexican-Aztec Suite (1930) and grotesque parodies of contemporary figures including Al Jolson (1931), which was performed in blackface, Adolf Hitler (1931), Gerhart Hauptmann (1932), and Gandhi (1933). In her parody pieces she wore masks that she created while working with Erich Goldstaub in Berlin. In her 1932 piece In Der Friedensengel, Marcus wore an oversized mask resembling Aristide Briand along with a tuxedo shirt and jacket with a white ballet tutu. Her parody works were satires on diplomatic gesturing. In her 1933 piece Wälzer she danced wearing a gas mask. Marcus was a Communist and in cabaret performances would dance parodies of people from all social classes including a sewing machine operator, a servant, and a symphony conductor. She set some of her dances to music by the Communist composer Hanns Eisler. She was also anti-military and incorporated her political ideologies into her performances. During the Third Reich, her performances opportunities were severely limited, so she began touring around Europe, entering the cabaret scenes in Warsaw, Amsterdam, and Zürich. In 1933 she settled in Paris and collaborated with Ludolf Schild, Lisa Duncan, and Mila Cirul. In 1937 she and Schild created the ballet Le Fievre du Teps at the Théâtre Pigalle. She died on 17 July 2002.

The Screen Tests were a series of short black and white videos featuring close ups of celebrities answering questions Hirschberg had posed. In 2010 Hirschberg left T: The New York Times Style Magazine to work at W magazine and carried over her Screen Tests series. In 2015 Hirschberg began a new video series, again for W, called Birthday Stories featuring actors, models, and designers discussing their birthdays. in 2020 Hirschberg began a new podcast for W Magazine, 5 things with Lynn Hirschberg, in which she asks high-profile celebrities about a person, place, thing, and two experiences that have affected their lives. =Controversies= Hirschberg has been the subject of ire from several of her interviewees. In 1992 she wrote a piece for Vanity Fair about Courtney Love who was then pregnant with her daughter Frances Bean Cobain. Hirschberg quoted Love talking about taking heroin while pregnant. As a result, Cobain was removed from the care of her parents by child protective services shortly after her birth while an investigation was launched. In response Love left Hirschberg a threatening message on her answering machine. Love also recorded and released a bootleg song called Bring Me the Head of Lynn Hirschberg. In 2010 Hirschberg interviewed rapper M.I.A. for T: The New York Times Style Magazine. In the piece she contrasted the rapper's luxurious lifestyle with her political viewpoints in unflattering ways, leading to criticism from M.I.A. who would later release her own audio of the interview as well as releasing Hirschberg's telephone number through Twitter.

He trained in Antwerp but mainly worked abroad, and in particular in Northern Europe.Peeter van Kessel at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Little is known about the life and training of Peter van Kessel. He was likely born in Antwerp between 1630 and 1640. He is not mentioned in the records of the Guild of Saint Luke of Antwerp, which may indicate that he trained and later worked in the workshop of a family member who was a master of the guild.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp on Google books It is not clear whether he was related to the van Kessel family of still life painters, which was related to the Brueghel family of artists.Th. Hach, Der Blumenmaler Peter van Kessel in: Hubert Janitschek (ed.), Repertorium für Kunstwissenschaft, Volume VIII, 1885, pp. 330–335 The earliest known work by the artist dates from 1658.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, pp. 1119–1121 Hunting equipment In 1658 the artist was likely active in Germany as he should likely be identified with the artist referred to as Peter Kessel who was recorded in Würzburg and Bamberg at that time. He is later recorded in Gdańsk. On his way to work at the court in Copenhagen, he stayed for a while in Lübeck in 1668. Here he worked initially in the workshop of the local painter Burchard Wulff. Later the dean of the local painter's guild Hans Götjens allowed him to work on his own. Götjens also let van Kessel stay in his home. This gave rise to a conflict between dean Gotjens and the local painter's guild which filed a complaint accusing the dean of allowing a foreign master to practise the painter's trade without being properly registered with the local guild. The guild members also felt insulted because Götjens had stated that none of them could paint as well as van Kessel. From the documents relating to the complaint it appears that van Kessel was at the time just stopping over for about a month in Lübeck while he was on his way to Copenhagen to which he had been allegedly called by the Danish king. Van Kessel was separately also accused of having made derogatory remarks about the members of the Council of Lübeck in retribution of which he was threatened with arrest. A wigmaker paid van Kessels bail for him and in return van Kessel painted some works for the wigmaker. Floral still life in a niche with a stag beetle Later van Kessel travelled to Copenhagen where he worked at the Danish court.Peter van Kessel (Attributed), Madonna surrounded by a garland of flowers at Dorotheum He died in Ratzeburg in early October 1668. Work =General= Van Kessel was a specialist still life painter. He practised many of the sub-genres of still life such as flower pieces, fruit still lifes, vanitas still lifes, garland paintings, hunting pieces and game pieces. His earliest dated work dates from 1658. =Flower paintings= An important portion of van Kessel's output is constituted by floral still lifes. An example is the Floral still life in a niche with a stag beetle (at Hampel Munich sale of 30 March 2017 lot 263<) which shows flowers in a glass vase set in a stone gray niche. The flowers do not reach outside of the niche. The glass vase stands at the very edge of the niche. A stag beetle is about to climb the wall recess and unto to the ledge on which the vase stands. The painter has arranged the flower container in the vase in such a way that all flowers, including roses, tulips, carnations, marigolds and other garden flowers are equally lit up in front of the dark niche wall. Probably as a vanitas reminder (discussed below), the stems or petals of the hollyhock on the right and the nasturtium on the left are shown already drooping slightly.Peter van Kessel (Attributed), Floral still life in a niche with a stag beetle at Hampel Munich sale of 30 March 2017 lot 263 This type of painting is very reminiscent of the still life in a niche paintings of earlier Flemish artists such as Osias Beert.Mulders, Christine van. \\"Beert [Beet, Beirt, Bert], Osias [Osyas], I,\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed 15 April 2019 =Garland paintings= Garland of flowers surrounding a stone cartouche enclosing a bust of the Virgin A portion of van Kessel's output falls into the category of 'garland paintings'. Garland paintings are a type of still life invented in early 17th century Antwerp by Jan Brueghel the Elder and subsequently practised by leading Flemish still life painters, and in particular Daniel Seghers. Paintings in this genre typically show a flower or, less frequently, fruit garland around a devotional image or portrait. In the later development of the genre, the devotional image is replaced by other subjects such as portraits, mythological subjects and allegorical scenes.Susan Merriam, Seventeenth-Century Flemish Garland Paintings. Still Life, Vision and the Devotional Image, Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2012David Freedberg, \\"The Origins and Rise of the Flemish Madonnas in Flower Garlands, Decoration and Devotion\\", Münchener Jahrbuch der bildenden Kunst, xxxii, 1981, pp. 115–150. Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Van Kessel's collaborators on his garland paintings have not been identified. Van Kessel would have painted the fruit and flower garlands while his collaborators would then have painted the figure or figures inside the cartouche. The Garland of flowers surrounding a stone cartouche enclosing a bust of the Virgin is an example of a garland painting attributed to van Kessel. The flowers in the painting resemble those of the Garland surrounding a stone cartouche with a chalice in the Staatsgalerie Bamberg, dated 1658.Peter van Kessel (Attributed), Garland of flowers surrounding a stone cartouche enclosing a bust of the Virgin, Christie's Amsterdam sale of 13–14 May 2014 lot 67 Stylistically his garland paintings are close to those created by Jan van Kessel the Elder who may have been a family member. =Vanitas still lifes= Vanitas still life Van Kessel is also known for his vanitas still lifes, a genre of still lifes which offers a reflection on the meaninglessness of earthly life and the transient nature of all earthly goods and pursuits. The motif of Vanitas or transience of life is inspired by the Christian belief that the world is solely a temporary place of fleeting pleasures and sorrows from which mankind can only escape through the sacrifice and resurrection of Jesus.Peter van Kessel, Vanitas at the Maribor Regional Museum While he painted some pure vanitas paintings, the vanitas theme is also present in his flower paintings. For instance, in the Floral still life in a niche with a stag beetle discussed above the wilting flowers express the vanitas theme of impermanence and death. A pure vanitas painting is his composition Vanitas still life (dated 1668, Museum Catharijneconvent in Utrecht). This composition contains the typical symbols present in vanitas paintings: a skull with a laurel wreath (referencing the passing of glory), dice (referencing the vicissitudes of life), a wine glass, sheet music and a violin (refencing the fleetingness of physical and spiritual pleasures), wilting flowers and an hourglass (refencing decay and the passing of time). The Vanitas still life in the Maribor Regional Museum in Maribor reprises many of the same symbols. In this work, objects that allude to military glory (military distinctions, a sword) are placed on the left while those referencing cultural achievements such as books and music are placed on the right. Physical and spiritual achievements are placed among the symbols of death and decay such as the extinguished candle, the skull and the wilting flowers to convey the idea that all achievements eventually fall into oblivion or extinction.

Written, produced and directed by Adam Mason, starring Paul Sloan, Viktoriya Dov, Darri Ingolfsson and Eric Michael Cole. Alice in Chains are executive producers on the film along with Jason Collins. The film tells the story of extraterrestrial father and daughter, Alpha and Beta, who drive across California in silence, speaking only telepathically. The daughter seduces men and steals from them to help her father build an antenna to send a message to their people at home. At the same time, they are being tracked down by evil forces that are trying to kill them. A 10-part web-series with the same title focused on each song from Rainier Fog was released before the film.  Cast  * Paul Sloan ... Alpha * Viktoriya Dov ...

Bodie  Production  During an interview with Eddie Trunk on his radio show Trunk Nation on May 7, 2018, Alice in Chains' vocalists Jerry Cantrell and William DuVall revealed that drummer Sean Kinney talked to director Adam Mason, who was making a dark sci-film, and they talked about doing two separate pieces of art and maybe molding them together, and that the music video for Rainier Fog's first single, \\"The One You Know\\" is the first chapter of molding Mason's film and the band's music videos together. In June 2018, DuVall said in an interview with Swedish website Rocksverige that the music video for \\"The One You Know\\" is the first chapter of what the band is hoping that will be visuals for all of ten songs from Rainier Fog, and in addition to that, will be a companion piece to the film that director Adam Mason was shooting. The music video for Alice in Chains' single \\"Never Fade\\", also directed by Mason, was released on November 1, 2018 and continued the storyline from the video of \\"The One You Know\\". Besides the music of Alice in Chains, director Adam Mason said that the inspiration for the film was a combination of the homeless problem in Los Angeles and what's happening with immigration in the past few years. \\"It's not really a political movie, it's just whenever I hear the term ‘illegal alien’ I immediately start to wonder if extraterrestrial aliens would be welcome here. And the answer is probably ‘f**k no!’\\". Mason said that when Cantrell talked to him about the themes of the album, a lightbulb went off in his head, because the day before he was walking home from his office, saw a bunch of homeless people living in their cars and started to have this idea about a couple of homeless aliens, hiding on earth in human bodies trying to get home. \\"I literally just saw the whole thing in my head, knew that Paul Sloan had to play the main dude, and Viktoriya Dov his daughter... and they'd be living together out of my old Ford Bronco I've been driving for years. I drew a great deal of inspiration from what Jerry told me about the lyrics. There's a lot of stuff in the album about the concept of hiding behind a mask, and not really knowing what you're getting. There’s a lot of stuff going on in the world right now that I think fed into their album, and then by osmosis into our movie.\\" Mason stated that the influences for Black Antenna were films such as Starman, Blade Runner, Under The Skin, American Honey and Pinocchio, as the female character, Beta is an alien who dreams of being human just like Pinocchio. Mason also said that he always saw Black Antenna as this indie movie prequel to a big movie like Independence Day. \\"When our little movie ends, a huge movie like that would begin. This is the origin story of a blockbuster, basically\\", he said.  Web- series  Besides a 90-minute film, a web-series with the same title focused on each song from the album was also released.

The book also claims that genes play a more important role in people's personalities than does the environment. In Blueprint, Plomin argues that environmental effects on human psychological differences, although they exist, are \\"...mostly random – unsystematic and unstable – which means that we cannot do much about them.\\" Reviews Science journalist Matt Ridley praised Blueprint as \\"a hugely important book.\\" Behavior geneticist Kathryn Paige Harden criticized the book for overstating the importance of genes for the development of human traits, writing, \\"Insisting that DNA matters is scientifically accurate; insisting that it is the only thing that matters is scientifically outlandish.\\" Steven Mithen gave the book a mixed review in the Guardian, in which he wrote, \\"I am happy to bow to Plomin as a psychologist and a geneticist, but I found his sociology rather lacking, in fact quite baffling.\\" Nathaniel Comfort criticized the book for promoting genetic determinism and \\"play[ing] fast and loose with the concept of heritability\\".

Suman is about to discharge the boy but his parents beseech her to examine him; the boy had specifically asked for her after his last bout of convulsions. Suman interviews the boy. He looks at her balefully and says he knows everything. He says that the missing Dr Asthana is dead and the body is in the woods outside Lonavla. Shekhawat is called and the body is found exactly where the boy had said. Upon questioning by Shekhawat, the boy alludes to a ‘woman whose anklets sounded so sweet’ and Shekhawat recoils in horror. It is revealed that Shekhawat had a lover (with sweet sounding anklets) in Benares. She became pregnant, there was an argument and Shekhawat, who could not risk his own marriage, strangled her and buried her body in Benares. She returned as a ghost and began chasing Shekhawat. Shekhawat sought the advice of a spiritual master, Dinkar, who prepared a charmed talisman; as long as Shekhawat wore the talisman the ghost could not harm him. Shekhawat sends a video of the convulsing boy to Dinkar. Dinkar says the boy is possessed and Shekhawat, though protected by the talisman, should stay away from the boy. Shekhawat begins his investigations. The boy and his parents were in room 706 of a hotel on a night when another youth leaped to his death from the roof of the same hotel. The hotel security cameras show Suman visiting the hotel. Suman denies this. Shekhawat asks why she hurried to meet him when he mentioned the hotel. She admits she was indeed there. The youth was her patient. His lover had left him to marry an NRI overseas. The youth became suicidal. Suman had prescribed sedatives. On the night of his death Suman had gone to check on him but she had been too late; he had jumped to his death. Shekhawat tells Suman that the ghost of the youth has possessed the boy. Suman dismisses the idea. Shekhawat sighs. He is not an impressionable ignoramus. He was an engineer before he joined the police, he is a fierce rationalist, but his own experiences with his lover ghost have made him aware of the other world. Suman is not convinced. Shekhawat visits his spiritual master Dinkar in Benares. Dinkar confirms that it is indeed the ghost of the youth inside the boy, it wants revenge against Suman. The youth ghost is working with the lover’s ghost, they want to destroy Shekhawat and Suman. What can be done, asks Shekhawat. Dinkar says there are two options: get the youth’s ghost to leave the boy or kill the boy. Dinkar says the youth is set upon revenge and will not leave the boy so the latter is the only option. Shekhawat returns to Mumbai and discusses the options with Suman. The boy must be killed. Suman reveals that she had taken the youth as her lover but had tired of him and broken it off. He continued pursuing her so she gave him an overdose of an anti depressive which caused an emotional rush that led him to kill himself. She killed her own husband with similar over-medication to escape her dreary marriage. Suman defiantly refuses to kill the boy. Shekhawat gives her the evening to think it over. In the morning, having worked out there is no other way, she agrees. She asks for protection; Shekhawat gives her the talisman. She calls in the parents of the boy and explains that she needs their consent to perform a deep psychological experiment on the boy in the room (706) where the trauma had begun. They agree. She brings the boy, sedated, to the room in the hotel. She now speaks to the ghost of the youth. She will go to him, he will leave the boy. She kills herself and the ghost leaves the boy and Shekhawat comes, now vulnerable without his talisman, returns home where the ghost of his lover is waiting for him as the film ends.

The Mueller report, officially titled Report on the Investigation into Russian Interference in the 2016 Presidential Election, is the official report documenting the findings and conclusions of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian efforts to interfere in the 2016 United States presidential election, allegations of conspiracy or coordination between Donald Trump's presidential campaign and Russia, and allegations of obstruction of justice. The report was submitted to Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019, and a redacted version of the 448-page report was publicly released by the Department of Justice (DOJ) on April 18, 2019. It is divided into two volumes. The redactions from the report and its supporting material are under President Trump's temporary \\"protective assertion\\" of executive privilege as of May 8, 2019, preventing the material from being passed to Congress, despite earlier reassurance by Barr that Trump \\"confirmed\\" he would not exert privilege. Volume I of the report concludes that the investigation did not find sufficient evidence that the campaign \\"coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election- interference activities\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 173: \\"Ultimately, the investigation did not establish that the Campaign coordinated or conspired with the Russian government in its election-interference activities.\\" Investigators ultimately had an incomplete picture of what happened due to communications that were encrypted, deleted, or not saved and due to testimony that was false, incomplete, or declined. However, the report states that Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election was illegal and occurred \\"in sweeping and systematic fashion\\"Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 1: \\"The Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\\" but was welcomed by the Trump campaign as it expected to benefit from such efforts. It also identifies links between Trump campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government,Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 66: \\"The Office identified multiple contacts 'links', in the words of the Appointment Order between Trump Campaign officials and individuals with ties to the Russian government.\\" about which several persons connected to the campaign made false statements and obstructed investigations.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 180: \\"the Office's investigation uncovered evidence of numerous links (i.e., contacts) between Trump Campaign officials and individuals having or claiming to have ties to the Russian government. The Office evaluated the contacts under several sets of federal laws, including conspiracy laws and statutes governing foreign agents who operate in the United States. After considering the available evidence, the Office did not pursue charges under these statutes against any of the individuals discussed in Section IV above with the exception of FARA charges against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates based on their activities on behalf of Ukraine.... several U.S. persons connected to the Campaign made false statements about those contacts and took other steps to obstruct the Office's investigation and those of Congress. This Office has therefore charged some of those individuals with making false statements and obstructing justice.\\" Mueller later stated that his investigation's conclusion on Russian interference \\"deserves the attention of every American\\". Volume II of the report addresses obstruction of justice. The investigation intentionally took an approach that could not result in a judgment that Trump committed a crime,Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 2: \\"Third, we considered whether to evaluate the conduct we investigated under the Justice Manual standards governing prosecution and declination decisions, but we determined not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the President committed crimes.\\" abiding by an Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion that a sitting president is immune from criminal prosecution,Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 1: \\"The Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) has issued an opinion finding that 'the indictment or criminal prosecution of a sitting President would impermissibly undermine the capacity of the executive branch to perform its constitutionally assigned functions' in violation of the constitutional separation of powers. [...] this Office accepted OLC's legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction.\\" fearing that charges would affect Trump's governing and preempt impeachmentMueller Report, vol. II, pp. 1–2: \\"[...] apart from OLC's constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct. Footnote: See U.S. CONST. Art. I § 2, cl. 5; § 3, cl. 6; cf. OLC Op. at 257–258 (discussing relationship between impeachment and criminal prosecution of a sitting President). [...] Even if an indictment were sealed during the President's term, OLC reasoned, 'it would be very difficult to preserve [an indictment's] secrecy,' and if an indictment became public, '[t]he stigma and opprobrium' could imperil the President's ability to govern.\\" and feeling that it would be unfair to accuse Trump of a crime without charges or a trial.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 2: \\"[...] a prosecutor's judgment that crimes were committed, but that no charges will be brought, affords no such adversarial opportunity for public name- clearing before an impartial adjudicator. The concerns about the fairness of such a determination would be heightened in the case of a sitting President, where a federal prosecutor's accusation of a crime, even in an internal report, could carry consequences that extend beyond the realm of criminal justice. OLC noted similar concerns about sealed indictments.\\" As such, the investigation \\"does not conclude that the President committed a crime\\"; however, \\"it also does not exonerate him\\",Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 7: \\"while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\\" with investigators not confident of Trump's innocence.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 2: \\"Fourth, if we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the President clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state. Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, however, we are unable to reach that judgment. The evidence we obtained about the President's actions and intent presents difficult issues that prevent us from conclusively determining that no criminal conduct occurred. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\\" The report describes ten episodes where Trump may have obstructed justice while president and one before he was elected, noting that he privately tried to \\"control the investigation\\".Mueller Report., vol. II, p. 185: \\"The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. [...] The President launched public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the President, while in private, the President engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation.\\" The report further states that Congress can decide whether Trump obstructed justice and take action accordingly,Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 8: \\"With respect to whether the President can be found to have obstructed justice by exercising his powers under Article II of the Constitution, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit a President's corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. [...] The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the President's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.\\" referencing impeachment. On March 24, Barr sent Congress a four-page letter detailing the report's conclusions. On March 27, Mueller privately wrote to Barr, stating that the March 24 Barr letter \\"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions\\" and that this led to \\"public confusion\\". Barr declined Mueller's request to release the report's introduction and executive summaries ahead of the full report. Also on March 24, Barr's letter stated that he and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein concluded that the evidence was \\"not sufficient to establish\\" that Trump had obstructed justice.Barr letter, p. 3: \\"After reviewing the Special Counsel's final report on these issues; consulting with Department officials, including the Office of Legal Counsel; and applying the principles of federal prosecution that guide our charging decisions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\\" On May 1, Barr testified that he \\"didn't exonerate\\" Trump on obstruction as \\"that's not what the Justice Department does\\" and that neither he nor Rosenstein had reviewed the underlying evidence in the report. In July 2019, Mueller testified to Congress that a president could be charged with crimes including obstruction of justice after they left office. In 2020, a Republican-appointed federal judge decided to personally review if the report's redactions were legitimate. The judge said Barr's \\"misleading\\" statements about the report's findings led him to suspect that Barr had tried to establish a \\"one-sided narrative\\" favorable to Trump.  Background  = Impetus for investigation = On May 9, 2017, President Donald Trump dismissed former Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, James Comey, who had been leading an ongoing Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation into links between Trump associates and Russian officials. This investigation, code named Crossfire Hurricane, began in July 2016 after the Australian government advised US authorities that George Papadopoulos, a foreign policy advisor in the Trump campaign, had met with one of their diplomats in May 2016 and \\"suggested the Trump team had received some kind of suggestion from Russia\\" that Russia could release information that would be damaging to Hillary Clinton. Papadopolous had received this suggestion in April 2016, well before it was publicly reported that Russia had damaging information about Clinton (the Democratic National Committee had in June 2016 announced that a Russian hack occurred). Papadopoulos later testified that this \\"damaging information\\" was in the form of hacked emails that were stolen from the Democratic Party. Over 130 Democratic lawmakers of the United States Congress called for a special counsel to be appointed in reaction to Comey's firing. CNN reported that within eight days of Comey's dismissal, an FBI investigation on Trump for obstruction of justice was opened by the acting FBI Director at the time, Andrew McCabe, who cited multiple reasons including Comey's firing. After McCabe was later fired from the FBI, he confirmed that he had opened the obstruction investigation, and gave additional reasons for its launch. Then- Attorney General Jeff Sessions announcing his recusal from investigations into the Trump campaign in March 2017 Eight days after Comey's dismissal, then- Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointed Robert Mueller, under 28 CFR § 600.1, as special counsel to take over and expand an existing FBI counterintelligence investigation into possible Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, as well as the FBI investigation into links between Trump associates and Russian officials that Comey was leading. The special counsel also took over the FBI investigation into whether President Trump obstructed justice with Comey. Rosenstein's authority to appoint Mueller arose due to Attorney General Jeff Sessions' March 2017 recusal of himself from investigations into the Trump campaign. = Scope and mandate = According to its authorizing document, which was signed by then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on May 17, 2017, the investigation's scope included allegations that there were links or coordination between President Donald Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government as well as \\"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation\\". The authorizing document also included \\"any other matters within the scope of 28 CFR § 600.4(a)\\"; enabling the special counsel \\"to investigate and prosecute\\" any attempts to interfere with its investigation, \\"such as perjury, obstruction of justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses\\". = Proceedings of investigation = The Special Counsel investigation ran from May 17, 2017, to March 22, 2019, and resulted in thirty-four indictments, including against several former members of the Trump campaign and many of which are still being tried. The investigation issued over 2,800 subpoenas, executed almost 500 search warrants, and interviewed approximately 500 witnesses. The Mueller report included references to 14 criminal investigations that were referred to other offices, 12 of which were completely redacted in the April 18 release. The other two related to Michael Cohen and Gregory Craig, cases that were already public.  Findings  = Volume I = Volume I starts on page 1 of the report and focuses on Russian interference and allegations of conspiracy or coordination between Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: \\"In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of 'collusion'.\\"  Russian interference  The Mueller report found that the Russian government \\"interfered in the 2016 presidential election in sweeping and systematic fashion\\" and \\"violated U.S. criminal law\\". The report relayed two methods by which Russia attempted to influence the election. = Social media campaign = The first method of Russian interference was done through the Internet Research Agency (IRA), waging \\"a social media campaign that favored presidential candidate Donald J. Trump and disparaged presidential candidate Hillary Clinton\\". The IRA also sought to \\"provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 4: \\"The Internet Research Agency (IRA) carried out the earliest Russian interference operations identified by the investigation–a social media campaign designed to provoke and amplify political and social discord in the United States [...] The campaign evolved from a generalized program designed in 2014 and 2015 to undermine the U.S. electoral system, to a targeted operation that by early 2016 favored candidate Trump and disparaged candidate Clinton\\" By February 2016, internal IRA documents showed an order to support the candidacies of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, while IRA members were to \\"use any opportunity to criticize\\" Hillary Clinton and the rest of the candidates. From June 2016, the IRA organized election rallies in the U.S. \\"often promoting\\" Trump's campaign while \\"opposing\\" Clinton's campaign. The IRA posed as Americans, hiding their Russian background, while asking Trump campaign members for campaign buttons, flyers, and posters for the rallies. The Mueller report detailed that the IRA spent $100,000 for over 3,500 Facebook advertisements, which included anti-Clinton and pro-Trump advertisements. The report lists IRA-created groups on Facebook to include \\"purported conservative groups\\" (e.g. 'Tea Party News'), \\"purported Black social justice groups\\" (e.g. 'Blacktivist') \\"LGBTQ groups\\" (e.g. 'LGBT United'), \\"and religious groups\\" (e.g. 'United Muslims of America'). The IRA Twitter accounts included @TEN_GOP (claiming to be related to the Tennessee Republican Party), @jenn_abrams, and @Pamela_Moore13 (both claimed to be Trump supporters and both had 70,000 followers). Several Trump campaign members (Donald J. Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Kellyanne Conway, Brad Parscale, and Michael Flynn) linked or reposted material from the IRA's @TEN_GOP Twitter account listed above. Other people who responded to IRA social media accounts include Michael McFaul, Sean Hannity, Roger Stone, and Michael G. Flynn (Michael Flynn's son). = Hacking and release of material = The second method of Russian interference saw the Russian military intelligence agency GRU hacking into email accounts owned by volunteers and employees of the Clinton presidential campaign, including that of campaign chairman John Podesta, and also hacking into \\"the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC)\\". As a result, the GRU obtained hundreds of thousands of hacked documents, and the GRU proceeded by arranging releases of damaging hacked material via the WikiLeaks organization and also GRU's false personas \\"DCLeaks\\" and \\"Guccifer 2.0\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 4: \\"At the same time that the IRA operation began to focus on supporting candidate Trump in early 2016, the Russian government employed a second form of interference: cyber intrusions (hacking) and releases of hacked materials damaging to the Clinton Campaign. The Russian intelligence service known as the Main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff of the Russian Army (GRU) carried out these operations. In March 2016, the GRU began hacking the email accounts of Clinton Campaign volunteers and employees, including campaign chairman John Podesta. In April 2016, the GRU hacked into the computer networks of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the Democratic National Committee (DNC). The GRU stole hundreds of thousands of documents from the compromised email accounts and networks. Around the time that the DNC announced in mid-June 2016 the Russian government's role in hacking its network, the GRU began disseminating stolen materials through the fictitious online personas 'DCLeaks' and 'Guccifer 2.0'. The GRU later released additional materials through the organization WikiLeaks.\\"  Conspiracy or coordination  To establish whether a crime was committed by members of the Trump campaign with regard to Russian interference, investigators \\"applied the framework of conspiracy law\\", and not the concept of \\"collusion\\", because collusion \\"is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law.\\"Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: \\"In evaluating whether evidence about collective action of multiple individuals constituted a crime, we applied the framework of conspiracy law, not the concept of 'collusion'. In so doing, the Office recognized that the word 'collud[e]' was used in communications with the Acting Attorney General confirming certain aspects of the investigation's scope and that the term has frequently been invoked in public reporting about the investigation. But collusion is not a specific offense or theory of liability found in the United States Code, nor is it a term of art in federal criminal law. For those reasons, the Office's focus in analyzing questions of joint criminal liability was on conspiracy as defined in federal law.\\" They also investigated if members of the Trump campaign \\"coordinated\\" with Russia, using the definition of \\"coordination\\" as having \\"an agreementtacit or expressbetween the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference.\\" Investigators further elaborated that merely having \\"two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests\\" was not enough to establish coordination.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 2: \\"In connection with that analysis, we addressed the factual question whether members of the Trump Campaign 'coordinat[ed]' a term that appears in the appointment order with Russian election interference activities. Like collusion, 'coordination' does not have a settled definition in federal criminal law. We understood coordination to require an agreement tacit or express between the Trump Campaign and the Russian government on election interference. That requires more than the two parties taking actions that were informed by or responsive to the other's actions or interests. We applied the term coordination in that sense when stating in the report that the investigation did not establish that the Trump Campaign coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities.\\" The investigation found there were over 100 contacts between Trump campaign advisors and individuals affiliated with the Russian government, before and after the election, but the evidence was insufficient to show an illegal conspiracy. The New York Times estimated as many as 140 contacts between \\"Mr. Trump and his associates and Russian nationals and WikiLeaks or their intermediaries\\" in the report. The special counsel identified two methods the Russian government tried to communicate with the Trump campaign. \\"The investigation identified two different forms of connections between the IRA and members of the Trump Campaign. [...] First, on multiple occasions, members and surrogates of the Trump Campaign promotedtypically by linking, retweeting, or similar methods of repostingpro- Trump or anti-Clinton content published by the IRA through IRA-controlled social media accounts. Additionally, in a few instances, IRA employees represented themselves as U.S. persons to communicate with members of the Trump Campaign in an effort to seek assistance and coordination on IRA- organized political rallies inside the United States\\", the report states. Secondly, the report details a meeting at Trump Tower in June 2016. The intent of the meeting was to exchange \\"dirt\\" on the Clinton campaign. There was speculation that Trump Jr. told his father. However, the special counsel could not find any evidence that he did. The office declined to pursue charges for two reasons: the office \\"did not obtain admissible evidence\\" that would meet the burden of proof principle beyond a reasonable doubt that the campaign officials acted with general knowledge about the illegality of their conduct; secondly, the office expected difficulty in valuing the promised information that \\"exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation\\" of $2,000 for a criminal violation and $25,000 for a felony punishment. The Report cited several impediments to investigators' ability to acquire information, including witnesses invoking their Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination, witnesses deleting electronic communications or using encrypted or self-destructing messaging apps, limitations of interviewing attorneys or individuals asserting they were members of the media, information obtained through subpoenas that was screened from investigators due to legal privilege, and false or incomplete testimony provided by witnesses.Mueller Report, Vol. 1, p.10: The investigation did not always yield admissible information or testimony, or a complete picture of the activities undertaken by subjects of the investigation. Some individuals invoked their Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination and were not, in the Office's judgment, appropriate candidates for grants of immunity. The Office limited its pursuit of other witnesses and information-such as information known to attorneys or individuals claiming to be members of the media-in light of internal Department of Justice policies. See, e.g., Justice Manual §§ 9-13.400, 13.410. Some of the information obtained via court process, moreover, was presumptively covered by legal privilege and was screened from investigators by a filter (or \\"taint\\") team. Even when individuals testified or agreed to be interviewed, they sometimes provided information that was false or incomplete, leading to some of the false-statements charges described above. And the Office faced practical limits on its ability to access relevant evidence as well-numerous witnesses and subjects lived abroad, and documents were held outside the United States. Further, the Office learned that some of the individuals we interviewed or whose conduct we investigated-including some associated with the Trump Campaign—deleted relevant communications or communicated during the relevant period using applications that feature encryption or that do not provide for long-term retention of data or communications records. In such cases, the Office was not able to corroborate witness statements through comparison to contemporaneous communications or fully question witnesses about statements that appeared inconsistent with other known facts. While conspiracy or coordination was not proven, Mueller's report left many unanswered questions, such as whether the myriad secret contacts between Trump associates and Russians, which they lied about, constituted, using Mueller's words, \\"a third avenue of attempted Russian interference with or influence on the 2016 presidential election\\"? Benjamin Wittes has written about this: George Croner of the Foreign Policy Research Institute has also expressed his concerns with what he describes as a \\"curiously flaccid\\" approach taken by Mueller in dealing with what the public would normally interpret as \\"coordination\\". He sees Mueller's dependence on a formal \\"tacit agreement\\" approach as \\"an overly cautious\\" and \\"legalistic construct\\": = Volume II = Volume II starts on page 208 of the official PDF file of the report and details potential instances of obstruction of justice. Page numbering in the file restarts with Volume II.  Trump's reaction to Mueller appointment  According to the report, upon learning that Mueller had been appointed as Special Counsel, Trump said \\"Oh my God. This is terrible. This is the end of my presidency. I'm fucked\\", to Jeff Sessions when they were having a meeting in the Oval Office. \\"You were supposed to protect me\\", Sessions recalled Trump telling him. \\"Everyone tells me if you get one of these independent counsels it ruins your presidency. It takes years and years and I won't be able to do anything. This is the worst thing that ever happened to me\\", Trump later said, according to Sessions and Jody Hunt, Sessions' then- chief of staff.  Obstruction of justice  Regarding obstruction of justice, the report stated that the investigation \\"did not establish that the President was involved in an underlying crime related to Russian election interference\\", but investigators wrote that obstruction of justice could still occur \\"regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 157: \\"Obstruction of justice can be motivated by a desire to protect non-criminal personal interests, to protect against investigations where underlying criminal liability falls into a gray area, or to avoid personal embarrassment. The injury to the integrity of the justice system is the same regardless of whether a person committed an underlying wrong.\\" Trump, Barr, Rudy Giuliani and others have persistently and incorrectly maintained that an individual cannot obstruct justice unless the individual committed an underlying crime. On obstruction of justice, the report \\"does not conclude that the President committed a crime, [and] it also does not exonerate him\\". Since the special counsel's office had decided \\"not to make a traditional prosecutorial judgment\\", they \\"did not draw ultimate conclusions about the President's conduct\\". The report \\"does not conclude that the president committed a crime\\", as investigators decided \\"not to apply an approach that could potentially result in a judgment that the president committed crimes\\". Investigators did not make a judgment about whether to charge Trump with a crime, for two main reasons: Firstly, the investigation abided by DOJ Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinion written in 2000 that a sitting president cannot be federally indicted, a stance taken from the start of the investigation. Secondly, investigators did not want to charge Trump because a federal criminal charge would hinder a sitting president's \\"capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional process for addressing presidential misconduct\\",Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 1: \\"Given the role of the Special Counsel as an attorney in the Department of Justice and the framework of the Special Counsel regulations, see 28 U.S.C. § 515; 28 C.F.R. § 600.7(a), this Office accepted OLC's legal conclusion for the purpose of exercising prosecutorial jurisdiction. And apart from OLC's constitutional view, we recognized that a federal criminal accusation against a sitting President would place burdens on the President's capacity to govern and potentially preempt constitutional processes for addressing presidential misconduct.\\" with a footnote reference to impeachment.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 1: \\"Second, while the OLC opinion concludes that a sitting President may not be prosecuted, it recognizes that a criminal investigation during the President's term is permissible. The OLC opinion also recognizes that a President does not have immunity after he leaves office. OLC Op. at 255 ('Recognizing an immunity from prosecution for a sitting President would not preclude such prosecution once the President's term is over or he is otherwise removed from office by resignation or impeachment').\\" Even if charges were recommended in a secret memo or a charging document sealed until Trump's presidency ended, the information could still be leaked. In addition, the special counsel's office rejected the alternative option of accusing Trump of committing a crime without bringing a charge. Investigators felt that this alternative option would be unfair to Trump, as there would be no trial in which Trump could clear his own name. The special counsel's office did not exonerate Trump on obstruction of justice because they were not confident that Trump was clearly innocent, after examining \\"evidence [they] obtained about the President's actions and intent\\". The \\"investigation found multiple acts by the President that were capable of exerting undue influence over law enforcement investigations, including the Russian-interference and obstruction investigations\\". The report noted that once Trump was aware that he was personally being investigated for obstruction of justice, he started \\"public attacks on the investigation and individuals involved in it who could possess evidence adverse to the president, while in private, the president engaged in a series of targeted efforts to control the investigation.\\" However, President Trump's \\"efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests.\\" This prevented further obstruction of justice charges \\"against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 158: \\"The President's efforts to influence the investigation were mostly unsuccessful, but that is largely because the persons who surrounded the President declined to carry out orders or accede to his requests. Comey did not end the investigation of Flynn, which ultimately resulted in Flynn's prosecution and conviction for lying to the FBI. McGahn did not tell the Acting Attorney General that the Special Counsel must be removed, but was instead prepared to resign over the President's order. Lewandowski and Dearborn did not deliver the President's message to Sessions that he should confine the Russia investigation to future election meddling only. And McGahn refused to recede from his recollections about events surrounding the President's direction to have the Special Counsel removed, despite the President's multiple demands that he do so. Consistent with that pattern, the evidence we obtained would not support potential obstruction charges against the President's aides and associates beyond those already filed.\\" The report notes that Congress has the authority to decide if Trump obstructed justice, and then take further action if obstruction occurred, with investigators writing: \\"The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president's corrupt exercise of the powers of office accords with our constitutional system of checks and balances and the principle that no person is above the law.\\" This phrase was interpreted as a possible reference to Congress potentially initiating impeachment proceedings against President Trump. = Episodes of alleged obstruction = Some sources such as FactCheck.org, PBS NewsHour, and The New York Times describe the report as detailing eleven episodes where Trump may have possibly obstructed justice; one episode as a presidential candidate or president-elect, and ten episodes while Trump was president: Attorney General William Barr stated that there are ten episodes of potential obstruction. Other sources such as The Washington Post and The Hill also report ten episodes; both omit the episode when Trump was a presidential candidate or president-elect. CBS News counts ten episodes, omitting the one involving Corey Lewandowski. Quinta Jurecic, the managing editor of Lawfare, created a chart to simplify and summarize Mueller's analysis of these episodes in the report. Jurecic does not analyze the episode that occurred when Trump was a presidential candidate or president-elect.  Trump campaign's response to Russian support  Section A of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The report states that the first possible obstruction case was during the 2016 presidential campaign, when questions \\"arose about the Russian government's apparent support for candidate Trump\\". The report states that while Trump was publicly skeptical Russia had released emails from Democratic officials, Trump and his aides were also trying to obtain information about \\"any further planned WikiLeaks releases\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 15: \\"Trump also expressed skepticism that Russia had hacked the emails at the same time as he and other Campaign advisors privately sought information about any further planned WikiLeaks releases.\\" According to the report, shortly after a WikiLeaks release, Rick Gates, then Deputy Campaign Chairman, was going to LaGuardia Airport with Trump when Trump took a phone call. After the call, \\"candidate Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 54: \\"According to Gates, by the late summer of 2016, the Trump Campaign was planning a press strategy, a communications campaign, and messaging based on the possible release of Clinton emails by WikiLeaks. while Trump and Gates were driving to LaGuardia Airport. , shortly after the call candidate Trump told Gates that more releases of damaging information would be coming.\\" The report also notes that Trump consistently said that he had no business connections to Russia, despite his company trying to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. \\"After the election, the President expressed concerns to advisors that reports of Russia's election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 15: \\"After the election, when questions persisted about possible links between Russia and the Trump Campaign, the President-Elect continued to deny any connections to Russia and privately expressed concerns that reports of Russian election interference might lead the public to question the legitimacy of his election.\\"  President's conduct in Michael Flynn investigation  Section B of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The report outlines Michael Flynn's, Trump's first National Security Advisor, contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, shortly after the Obama Administration imposed sanctions against Russia on December 29, 2016. Later that day, K. T. McFarland, \\"who was slated to become the Deputy National Security Advisor ... talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 25: \\"Flynn, who was in the Dominican Republic at the time, and K.T. McFarland, who was slated to become the Deputy National Security Advisor and was at the Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida with the President-Elect and other senior staff, talked by phone about what, if anything, Flynn should communicate to Kislyak about the sanctions.\\" The report details that based on those conversations, \\"McFarland informed Flynn that incoming Administration officials at Mar-a-Lago did not want Russia to escalate the situation\\". Former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus \\"recalled that McFarland may have mentioned at the meeting that the sanctions situation could be 'cooled down' and not escalated\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 25: \\"Incoming Chief of Staff Reince Priebus recalled that McFarland may have mentioned at the meeting that the sanctions situation could be 'cooled down' and not escalated.\\" Priebus recalls that President-Elect Trump viewed the sanctions \\"as an attempt by the Obama Administration to embarrass him by delegitimizing his election\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 25: \\"Priebus recalled that the President-Elect viewed the sanctions as an attempt by the Obama Administration to embarrass him by delegitimizing his election.\\" Later that evening, Flynn called Kislyak and requested how Russia should respond to the newly-placed U.S. sanctions: \\"only in a reciprocal manner, without escalating the situation\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 25: \\"Immediately after discussing the sanctions with McFarland on December 29, 2016, Flynn called Kislyak and requested that Russia respond to the sanctions only in a reciprocal manner, without escalating the situation.\\" Afterwards, Flynn briefed McFarland on the call. Flynn said that the Russian response to the sanctions \\"was not going to be escalatory because Russia wanted a good relationship with the Trump Administration\\".Mueller Report, vol II, p. 25: After the call, Flynn briefed McFarland on its substance. Flynn told McFarland that the Russian response to the sanctions was not going to be escalatory because Russia wanted a good relationship with the Trump Administration. On December 30, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia \\"would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time and would instead 'plan . . . further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration'\\".Mueller Report, vol II, pp. 25–26: \\"On December 30, 2016, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that Russia would not take retaliatory measures in response to the sanctions at that time and would instead 'plan ... further steps to restore Russian-US relations based on the policies of the Trump Administration.' Following that announcement, the President-Elect tweeted, 'Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart! Trump responded to the news by tweeting \\"Great move on delay (by V. Putin) – I always knew he was very smart!\\" The report details that Trump was warned by Don McGahn and Priebus to not discuss about the Russian investigation with Comey, but Trump did so anyway. The Mueller report described a November 2017 voicemail Flynn's attorneys received from Trump's \\"personal counsel\\", reportedly John Dowd, who stated, \\"[I]f...there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue,...so, you know, ...we need some kind of heads up\\",Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 121: In late November 2017, Flynn began to cooperate with this Office. On November 22, 2017, Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement he had with the President. Flynn's counsel told the President's personal counsel and counsel for the White House that Flynn could no longer have confidential communications with the White House or the President. Later that night, the President's personal counsel left a voicemail for Flynn's counsel that said: I understand your situation, but let me see if I can't state it in starker terms. . . . [I]t wouldn't surprise me if you've gone on to make a deal with . . . the government. . . . [I]f . . . there's information that implicates the President, then we've got a national security issue, . . . so, you know, . . . we need some kind of heads up. Um, just for the sake of protecting all our interests if we can . . . . [R]emember what we've always said about the ' President and his feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains . . . . reiterating the president's \\"feelings toward Flynn and, that still remains\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 6: After Flynn withdrew from a joint defense agreement with the President and began cooperating with the government, the President's personal counsel left a message for Flynn's attorneys reminding them of the President's warm feelings towards Flynn, which he said \\"still remains\\", and asking for a \\"heads up\\" if Flynn knew \\"information that implicates the President\\". Flynn's attorneys called Trump's attorney to reiterate that they could no longer share information with him because their joint defense agreement was canceled upon Flynn's guilty plea, at which point the attorney became \\"indignant and vocal in his disagreement\\", indicating that Trump would be advised that this represented \\"hostility\\" toward him. The New York Times reported on June 9, 2019, that Mueller's office opted to not question Dowd about the voicemail as potential obstruction of justice, possibly leading to Trump, because the ambiguity of the voicemail raised concerns of violating attorney-client privilege and protracted litigation.  President's reaction to the FBI's Russia investigation being publicized  Section C of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. After Trump learned that then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions planned to recuse himself from the Special Counsel investigation, Trump sought to prevent Session's move. \\"After Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked Sessions to \\"unrecuse\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 48: \\"In early March 2017, the President learned that Sessions was considering recusing from the Russia investigation and tried to prevent the recusal. After Sessions announced his recusal on March 2, the President expressed anger at Sessions for the decision and then privately asked Sessions to 'unrecuse'.\\" On March 20, Comey publicly disclosed the FBI's Russia investigation. \\"In the days that followed, the President contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election-interference effort in order to 'lift the cloud' of the ongoing investigation\\", the report says.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 48: \\"In the days that followed, the President contacted Comey and other intelligence agency leaders and asked them to push back publicly on the suggestion that the President had any connection to the Russian election- interference effort in order to 'lift the cloud' of the ongoing investigation.\\"  Dismissal of James Comey  Section D of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. \\"In the week leading up to Comey's May 3, 2017, Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, the President told Don McGahn that it would be the last straw if Comey did not set the record straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation, despite repeated requests that Comey make such an announcement,\\" the report states.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 75: \\"Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President's decision to fire Comey was Comey's unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally under investigation, despite the President's repeated requests that Comey make such an announcement. In the week leading up to Comey's May 3, 2017, Senate Judiciary Committee testimony, the President told McGahn that it would be the last straw if Comey did not set the record straight and publicly announce that the President was not under investigation.\\" Trump told his aides that he was going to fire Comey on May 5, and did so on May 9. The report notes that Trump fired Comey before he received a recommendation by the Justice Department. \\"Substantial evidence indicates that the catalyst for the President's decision to fire Comey was Comey's unwillingness to publicly state that the President was not personally under investigation, despite the President's repeated requests that Comey make such an announcement\\", the report reads. Trump boasted about the firing of Comey to the Russian foreign minister and U.S. Ambassador of Russia in an Oval Office meeting in May 2017, saying: \\"I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job. I faced great pressure because of Russia. That's taken off.\\"  President's efforts to remove the Special Counsel  Section E of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. When Jeff Sessions recused himself from the Special Counsel investigation, the report notes that Trump said something along the lines of: \\"that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President ultimately did not accept\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 77: \\"The Acting Attorney General appointed a Special Counsel on May 17, 2017, prompting the President to state that it was the end of his presidency and that Attorney General Sessions had failed to protect him and should resign. Sessions submitted his resignation, which the President ultimately did not accept.\\" The report notes that on June 14, 2017, \\"the press reported that the President was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets criticizing the Special Counsel's investigation\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 77–78: \\"On June 14, 2017, the press reported that the President was being personally investigated for obstruction of justice and the President responded with a series of tweets criticizing the Special Counsel's investigation.\\" The following weekend, Trump called McGahn and \\"directed him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest\\". McGahn did not act on the request \\"for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 78: \\"That weekend, the President called McGahn and directed him to have the Special Counsel removed because of asserted conflicts of interest. McGahn did not carry out the instruction for fear of being seen as triggering another Saturday Night Massacre and instead prepared to resign. McGahn ultimately did not quit and the President did not follow up with McGahn on his request to have the Special Counsel removed.\\" McGahn formally departed the Trump administration on October 17, 2018.  President's efforts to curtail the Special Counsel investigation  Section F of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. On June 19, 2017, two days after Trump tried to have Don McGahn fire the special counsel, Trump went to Sessions. Trump had a one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office with Corey Lewandowski, former Trump campaign manager who was not working for the government. Trump wanted Lewandowski to deliver a message to Sessions that would \\"have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 90: \\"Two days after the President directed McGahn to have the Special Counsel removed, the President made another attempt to affect the course of the Russia investigation. On June 19, 2017, the President met one-on-one with Corey Lewandowski in the Oval Office and dictated a message to be delivered to Attorney General Sessions that would have had the effect of limiting the Russia investigation to future election interference only.\\" The report relays that Trump told Lewandowski \\"that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the likelihood of recusal in advance, he would not have appointed Sessions\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 91: \\"During the June 19 meeting, Lewandowski recalled that, after some small talk, the President brought up Sessions and criticized his recusal from the Russia investigation. The President told Lewandowski that Sessions was weak and that if the President had known about the likelihood of recusal in advance, he would not have appointed Sessions.\\" Trump dictated the following message meant for Sessions, and Lewandowski noted it down: \\"I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS . .. is being treated very unfairly. He shouldn't have a Special Prosecutor/Counsel he hasn't done anything wrong. I was on the campaign him for nine months, there were no Russians involved with him. I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn't do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 91: \\"I know that I recused myself from certain things having to do with specific areas. But our POTUS . .. is being treated very unfairly.

I know it for a fact b/c I was there. He didn't do anything wrong except he ran the greatest campaign in American history.\\" The message goes on in which Sessions would meet with the Special Counsel and limit its jurisdiction to future election interference. \\"Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future elections\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 91: \\"Now a group of people want to subvert the Constitution of the United States. I am going to meet with the Special Prosecutor to explain this is very unfair and let the Special Prosecutor move forward with investigating election meddling for future elections so that nothing can happen in future election.\\" Trump reportedly said that \\"if Sessions delivered that statement he would be the 'most popular guy in the country.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 92: \\"The President said that if Sessions delivered that statement he would be the 'most popular guy in the country'. Lewandowski told the President he understood what the President wanted Sessions to do. Lewandowski arranged a meeting with Sessions, but it was cancelled \\"due to a last minute conflict\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 91: \\"Lewandowski wanted to pass the message to Sessions in person rather than over the phone. He did not want to meet at the Department of Justice because he did not want a public log of his visit and did not want Sessions to have an advantage over him by meeting on what Lewandowski described as Sessions's turf. Lewandowski called Sessions and arranged a meeting for the following evening at Lewandowski's office, but Sessions had to cancel due to a last minute conflict.\\" On July 19, 2017, Trump again met Lewandowski in the Oval Office, and inquired if Lewandowski passed the message to Sessions. Lewandowski replied that it would be done soon. The report continues: \\"Lewandowski recalled that the President told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 93: \\"President raised his previous request and asked if Lewandowski had talked to Sessions. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Lewandowski recalled that the President told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired.\\" Immediately after this second meeting, Lewandowski passed the message to White House official Rick Dearborn to relay to Sessions. Dearborn was uncomfortable with the task and chose not to not pass the message, although the report quotes Dearborn as telling Lewandowski that he had \\"handled the situation\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 91–92: \\"On July 19, 2017, the President again met with Lewandowski alone in the Oval Office. [...] the President raised his previous request and asked if Lewandowski had talked to Sessions. Lewandowski told the President that the message would be delivered soon. Lewandowski recalled that the President told him that if Sessions did not meet with him, Lewandowski should tell Sessions he was fired. Immediately following the meeting with the President, Lewandowski saw Dearborn in the anteroom outside the Oval Office and gave him a typewritten version of the message the President had dictated to be delivered to Sessions. Lewandowski told Dearborn that the notes were the message they had discussed, but Dearborn did not recall whether Lewandowski said the message was from the President. The message 'definitely raised an eyebrow' for Dearborn, and he recalled not wanting to ask where it came from or think further about doing anything with it. Dearborn also said that being asked to serve as a messenger to Sessions made him uncomfortable. He recalled later telling Lewandowski that he had handled the situation, but he did not actually follow through with delivering the message to Sessions, and he did not keep a copy of the typewritten notes Lewandowski had given him.\\"  President's efforts to prevent disclosures about Trump Tower meeting  Section G of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The report cites three different occasions between June 29 and July 9, 2017, when Trump directed Hope Hicks, former White House Communications Director, and others to not disclose information about the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016. These requests were directed to the press and could have constituted obstruction only if Trump \\"sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigations or the Special Counsel\\". The Special Counsel could not find any evidence to establish that Trump intended on preventing the Special Counsel or Congress from obtaining the emails or information referring to the meeting.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 106: \\"Each of these efforts by the President involved his communications team and was directed at the press. They would amount to obstructive acts only if the President, by taking these actions, sought to withhold information from or mislead congressional investigators or the Special Counsel.\\" Rick Gates, then Deputy Campaign Chairman, recalled that Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump, Paul Manafort, and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, were meeting.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 115: \\"Gates recalled that the meeting was attended by Trump Jr., Eric Trump, Paul Manafort, Hope Hicks, and, joining late, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. According to Gates, Manafort warned the group that the meeting likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful. Hicks denied any knowledge of the June 9 meeting before 2017, and Kushner did not recall if the planned June 9 meeting came up at all earlier that week.\\" The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to receive \\"dirt\\" on the Clinton presidential campaign. Gates testified that Trump Jr. announced at a regular planned meeting that he \\"had a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 15: \\"Rick Gates, who was the deputy campaign chairman, stated during interviews with the Office that in the days before June 9, 2016 Trump Jr. announced at a regular morning meeting of senior campaign staff and Trump family members that he had a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation.\\" Gates recalled Manafort saying at the meeting that the Trump Tower meeting \\"likely would not yield vital information and they should be careful\\". The Special Counsel found Manafort to be correct, as the \\"dirt\\" was information regarding the Ziff brothers doing tax evasion and money laundering in Russia and \\"donated the illegal profits to the DNC or the Clinton Campaign\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, pp. 117–118: \\"Goldstone recalled that Trump Jr. invited Veselnitskaya to begin but did not say anything about the subject of the meeting. Participants agreed that Veselnitskaya stated that the Ziff brothers had broken Russian laws and had donated their profits to the DNC or the Clinton Campaign. She asserted that the Ziff brothers had engaged in tax evasion and money laundering in both the United States and Russia, (redacted).\\" There was speculation that Trump Jr. told his father. However, the Special Counsel could not find any evidence that he did. The office declined to pursue charges for two reasons: the office \\"did not obtain admissible evidence\\" that would meet the burden of proof principle beyond a reasonable doubt that the campaign officials acted with general knowledge about the illegality of their conduct; secondly, the office expected difficulty in valuing the promised information that \\"exceeded the threshold for a criminal violation\\" of $2,000 for a criminal violation and $25,000 for a felony punishment.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 188: \\"The Office would also encounter difficulty proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the value of the promised documents and information exceeds the $2,000 threshold for a criminal violation, as well as the $25,000 threshold for felony punishment. See 52 U.S.C. § 30109(d)(1). The type of evidence commonly used to establish the value of non-monetary contributions-such as pricing the contribution on a commercial market or determining the upstream acquisition cost or the cost of distribution-would likely be unavailable or ineffective in this factual setting.\\"  President's efforts to have Attorney General control investigation  Section H of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The report notes that between 2017–2018, Trump tried to convince Jeff Sessions to reverse his recusal over the Special Counsel investigation. Trump also tried to convince Sessions to launch an investigation into Hillary Clinton and prosecute her. \\"On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation of Hillary Clinton ... There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President's conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that could restrict its scope. [...] A reasonable inference from those statements and the President's action is that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 112–113: \\"On multiple occasions in 2017, the President spoke with Sessions about reversing his recusal so that he could take over the Russia investigation and begin an investigation and prosecution of Hillary Clinton. ... There is evidence that at least one purpose of the President's conduct toward Sessions was to have Sessions assume control over the Russia investigation and supervise it in a way that would restrict its scope. ... A reasonable inference from those statements and the President's actions is that the President believed that an unrecused Attorney General would play a protective role and could shield the President from the ongoing Russia investigation. For example, in early summer 2017, Sessions recalled the President asking him to unrecuse, but Sessions did not take it as a directive. When the President raised the issue again in December 2017, the President said, as recorded by Porter, 'Not telling you to do anything. ... I'm not going to get involved. I'm not going to do anything or direct you to do anything. I just want to be treated fairly.' The duration of the President's efforts-which spanned from March 2017 to August 2018 and the fact that the President repeatedly criticized Sessions in public and in private for failing to tell the President that he would have to recuse is relevant to assessing whether the President's efforts to have Sessions unrecuse could qualify as obstructive acts.\\"  President orders McGahn to deny reports  Section I of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. After the news broke out in late January 2018, that Trump ordered Don McGahn to fire Robert Mueller in June 2017, Trump pressured McGahn to deny the reports. \\"After the story broke, the President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel,\\" the report reads.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 113: \\"After the story broke, the President, through his personal counsel and two aides, sought to have McGahn deny that he had been directed to remove the Special Counsel.\\" Trump told then-White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter to tell McGahn to create a record that makes clear Trump never directed McGahn to fire the Special Counsel. \\"Porter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file 'for our records' and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate. The President referred to McGahn as a 'lying bastard' and said that he wanted a record from him\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 115: \\"Porter thought the matter should be handled by the White House communications office, but the President said he wanted McGahn to write a letter to the file 'for our records' and wanted something beyond a press statement to demonstrate that the reporting was inaccurate. The President referred to McGahn as a 'lying bastard' and said that he wanted a record from him.\\" Porter recalled Trump \\"saying something to the effect of 'If he doesn't write a letter, then maybe I'll have to get rid of him'\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 115–116: \\"Porter recalled the President saying something to the effect of, 'If he doesn't write a letter, then maybe I'll have to get rid of him. Trump did not fire McGahn, who departed on October 17, 2018.  President's conduct towards Flynn, Manafort, and \\"redacted name\\"  Section J of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The report details that Trump took actions \\"directed at possible witnesses in the Special Counsel's investigation\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 120: \\"In addition to the interactions with McGahn described above, the President has taken other actions directed at possible witnesses in the Special Counsel's investigation, including Flynn, Manafort, HOM and as described in the next section, Cohen.\\" The report notes that actions taken by Trump and his counsel \\"could have had the potential to affect Flynn's decision to cooperate, as well as the extent of that cooperation. Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 131: \\"Because of privilege issues, however, we could not determine whether the President was personally involved in or knew about the specific message his counsel delivered to Flynn's counsel.\\" For Manafort, the report details by saying: \\"With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President's actions had the potential to influence Manafort's decision whether to cooperate with the government\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 131: \\"With respect to Manafort, there is evidence that the President's actions had the potential to influence Manafort's decision whether to cooperate with the government.\\"  President's conduct involving Michael Cohen  Section K of Volume II of the report describes the events of this episode. The final instance of potential obstruction concerns Michael Cohen, a former personal lawyer of Trump's. \\"There is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed adverse light on the President's campaign- period conduct and statements\\", the report states.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 155: \\" _Intent_. In analyzing the President's intent in his actions towards Cohen as a potential witness, there is evidence that could support the inference that the President intended to discourage Cohen from cooperating with the government because Cohen's information would shed adverse light on the President's campaign-period conduct and statements.\\" The report continues by detailing that Trump encouraged Cohen to \\"stay strong\\": \\"After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not \\"flip\\" and privately passes messages of support to him\\".Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 6: \\"After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not 'flip', contacted him directly to tell him to 'stay strong', and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do 'something else' to make the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a 'rat', and suggested that his family members had committed crimes.\\" However, the report notes that when Cohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of 2018, Trump publicly criticized him: \\"Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do 'something else' to make the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in the summer of 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a 'rat', and suggested that his family members had committed crimes\\". = Appendices = Four appendices were included in the report: * Appendix A: Order 3915-2017 from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appointing a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections.Mueller Report, Appendix A, p.

This appendix identifies matters transferred or referred by the Special Counsel's Office, as well as cases prosecuted by the Office that are now completed.\\"  Events before public release  The report was submitted by the special counsel to Attorney General William Barr on March 22, 2019. Barr assumed oversight of the investigation on February 14, 2019, after being approved by the Senate and sworn in as Attorney General. Barr had been previously critical of the investigation before Trump announced his intent to nominate Barr for Attorney General on December 7, 2018. Barr's predecessor, Jeff Sessions, resigned on November 7, 2018, writing that it was at Trump's request. = Barr letter = The letter from Attorney General William Barr (known as the Barr letter) on March 24, 2019, to leaders of the House and Senate judiciary committees describing the principal conclusions of the special counsel's investigation On March 24, 2019, Attorney General Barr sent Congress a four-page letter describing the special counsel's conclusions regarding Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and obstruction of justice. Barr relayed two ways in which Russia interfered in the election: firstly, \\"disinformation and social media operations in the United States designed to sow social discord\\"; and secondly, hacking computers for emails from the 2016 Clinton presidential campaign and Democratic Party organizations. Barr also quoted the report that the \\"investigation did not establish that members of the Trump Campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\\". On obstruction of justice, Barr wrote that the special counsel \\"did not draw a conclusion\\" on obstruction and that \\"The Special Counsel's decision to describe the facts of his obstruction investigation without reaching any legal conclusions leaves it to the Attorney General to determine whether the conduct described in the report constitutes a crime\\". Barr continued: \\"Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and I have concluded that the evidence developed during the Special Counsel's investigation is not sufficient to establish that the President committed an obstruction-of-justice offense\\". On Barr's decision to clear him on obstruction, Trump said in late April 2019 that Barr read the Mueller report \\"and he made a decision right on the spot. No obstruction\\". After the release of the Barr Letter, media commentators pointed out that in June 2018, prior to joining the Trump administration, Barr sent an unsolicited 19-page memo to the Department of Justice and White House attorneys asserting that Mueller's investigation of President Trump for obstruction is \\"legally insupportable\\", and \\"fatally misconceived\\". Barr also discussed the memo with some of Trump's attorneys.  Mueller's reaction  On March 27, 2019, Mueller reportedly wrote to Barr in a letter, as stated in the New York Times \\"expressing his and his team's concerns that the attorney general had inadequately portrayed their conclusions\\". This was first reported on April 30, 2019. Mueller thought that the Barr letter \\"did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance\\" of the findings of the special counsel investigation that he led. \\"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation\\". Mueller also requested Barr release the Mueller report's introductions and executive summaries. The March 27 Mueller letter made no mention of media coverage. On March 28, 2019, according to anonymous Justice Department officials, Mueller, in a call to Barr, reportedly expressed concerns about public misunderstandings of the obstruction investigation due to media coverage. On April 30, 2019, a spokeswoman from the Justice Department described the March 28 call between Mueller and Barr: \\"the Special Counsel emphasized that nothing in the Attorney General's March 24 letter was inaccurate or misleading. But, he expressed frustration over the lack of context and the resulting media coverage regarding the Special Counsel's obstruction analysis\\". Although they discussed whether more context could be provided via Barr releasing more of the report, Barr \\"ultimately determined that it would not be productive to release the report in piecemeal fashion\\". On March 29, 2019, Barr sent a subsequent letter to Congress in which he said that his March 24 letter was not a summary of the Mueller report, but merely presented the report's principal conclusions. Barr also wrote that he would be volunteering to testify before Congress in early May, which Barr did. = Barr testimony of April 9 and 10 = On April 9, Attorney General Barr appeared in a congressional hearing before the House. There, Representative Charlie Crist described media reports that \\"members of the special counsel's team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter, that it does not adequately or accurately portray the [Mueller] report's findings\\". Crist asked Barr: \\"Do you know what they are referencing with that?\\", Barr replied: \\"No, I don't. I think I think I suspect that they probably wanted more put out, but in my view, I was not interested in putting out summaries\\". On April 10, Attorney General Barr appeared before the Senate Appropriations Committee. Senator Chris Van Hollen asked Barr regarding obstruction: \\"Did Bob Mueller support your conclusion?\\" Barr replied: \\"I don't know whether Bob Mueller supported my conclusion.\\" = Barr press conference = Attorney General William Barr, accompanied by former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Ed O'Callaghan held a press conference discussing the Mueller report and related matters 90 minutes prior to its public release. On April 18, Attorney General Barr held a press conference discussing the report 90 minutes before it was released to Congress and the public. The press conference discussed redacted portions, and \\"ten episodes involving the President and discusses potential legal theories for connecting these actions to elements of an obstruction offense.\\" Barr gave the following elaboration on his decision that the evidence was insufficient to warrant an obstruction of justice charge for Trump: \\"Although the deputy attorney general [Rod Rosenstein] and I disagreed with some of the special counsel's legal theories and felt that some of the episodes examined did not amount to obstruction as a matter of law, we did not rely solely on that in making our decision. Instead, we accepted the special counsel's legal framework for purposes of our analysis and evaluated the evidence as presented by the special counsel in reaching our conclusion\\". Barr also mentioned that Trump's legal team received the redacted version of the report earlier in the week, adding that the president's lawyers \\"were not permitted to make, and did not request, any redactions\\". Barr said that the \\"president confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the special counsel's report\\". In the press conference, Barr asked that people look into the context, stating that President Trump \\"faced an unprecedented situation [...] federal agents and prosecutors were scrutinizing his conduct before and after taking office and the conduct of some of his associates. [...] There was relentless speculation in the news media about the President's personal culpability\\", even though there was, according to Barr, \\"no collusion\\". Barr continued that there was \\"substantial evidence to show that the president was frustrated and angered by a sincere belief that the investigation was undermining his presidency, propelled by his political opponents and fueled by illegal leaks\\". Also in the press conference, Barr said that he asked Mueller \\"whether or not [Mueller] was taking the position that he would have found a crime but for the existence of the OLC opinion\\" that a sitting president cannot be indicted. Barr continued that Mueller \\"made it very clear, several times, that he was not taking a position he was not saying but for the OLC opinion he would have found a crime\\". Some political commentators, including Chris Wallace of Fox News, observed that Barr appeared to behave more like Trump's defense attorney than as an attorney general during the press conference. Following the Barr press conference, The New York Times noticed similarities from Barr's 19-page memo to the Justice Department while not working for the government, in which he criticized this investigation for \\"proposing an unprecedented expansion of obstruction laws\\" that would result in \\"grave consequences\\" for the institution of the presidency. The New York Times continued that Barr had an \\"untrammeled view of executive power\\", and that the 2018 Barr memo \\"turned out to be an accurate road map to Mr. Barr's handling of the Mueller report\\".  Public release of redacted report  On April 18, 2019, a redacted version of the special counsel's report was released to Congress and the public. About one-eighth of the lines are redacted. The report is 448 pages long across two volumes and four appendices. It contains about 200,000 words and over 1,100 footnotes. About 11% of the text is redacted. 40% of the pages had at least one redaction, and there were over 900 redacted text blocks in all. Barr described the four kinds of redactions in the released report: \\"harm to ongoing matter\\" (HOM) in , \\"personal privacy\\" (PP) in , \\"investigative technique\\" (IT) in , and \\"grand jury\\" material in . Of those, only the grand jury redactions are required by law due to 6(e) of United States criminal procedure. Barr characterized the report as being \\"lightly redacted\\". = Redacted report findings compared to Barr letter = After the release of the redacted report, the Barr letter was criticized as a deliberate mischaracterization of the Mueller report and its conclusions. Numerous legal analysts accused Barr of glossing over the report, identifying significant discrepancies between Barr's characterizations of its contents and the report's actual findings, while others called for Barr's resignation. The New York Times reported instances in which the Barr letter omitted information and quoted sentence fragments out of context in ways that significantly altered the findings in the report, including: * Omission of language that indicated Trump could be subject to indictment after leaving office. * A sentence fragment described only one possible motive for Trump to obstruct justice, while the Mueller report listed multiple possible motives. * Omission of words and a full sentence that twice suggested there was knowing and complicit behavior between the Trump campaign and Russians that stopped short of direct coordination, which may constitute conspiracy. CNN wrote that while Barr in his letter took it upon himself to deliver a ruling on whether Trump had committed obstruction, the redacted report indicates that Mueller intended that decision to be made by Congress, not Barr. Numerous other political and legal analysts, including Bob Woodward and Brian Williams, observed significant differences in what Barr said about Mueller's findings in his March 24 summary letter, and in his April 18 press conference, compared to what the Mueller report actually found. This commentary included a comparison of Barr to Baghdad Bob, calling him \\"Baghdad Bill\\". Barr wrote that his letter provided \\"the principal conclusions\\" of the Mueller report. Ryan Goodman, a professor at the New York University School of Law and co-editor of Just Security, observed that in 1989 Barr also wrote a letter which he stated contained \\"the principal conclusions\\" of a controversial legal opinion he worked on as head of the OLC. Barr declined to provide the full opinion to Congress, but it was later subpoenaed and released to the public, showing that the summary letter did not fully disclose the principal conclusions. = Redacted report findings compared to Barr press conference = In the Barr press conference on April 18, prior to the release of the redacted report, Barr said that \\"the White House fully cooperated with the Special Counsel's investigation\\". However, Factcheck.org describes that this was \\"contradicted in the report\\", which stated that Trump had attacked the investigation in public, tried to control the investigation in private, and encouraged witnesses not to cooperate both in public and private. Factcheck.org also describes the report as saying that President Trump did not fully cooperate for interview requests by investigators, then in written responses answered that he did not remember to over 30 questions, while other answers were \\"incomplete or imprecise\\". Investigators protested that the written responses denied them the opportunity to ask follow-up questions, but Trump denied another request for an interview. Also the Barr press conference on April 18, Barr said that \\"Special Counsel Mueller did not indicate that his purpose was to leave the decision [on obstruction by Trump] to Congress\\". The Washington Post described that \\"the report does not say Mueller intended to leave obstruction-related decisions to Barr\\", and instead \\"uses suggestive language about Congress's role\\", that Congress can subject President Trump to obstruction laws, and made a reference to not wanting to preempt impeachment. = Analysis of redactions = Attributes of the report's text, and its redactions in particular, received significant news coverage and was a noted talking point. Redactions were concentrated on areas about Russian government interference in the elections. The four types of redactions had the following statistics: * \\"Harm to ongoing matter\\" – over 400 redactions and about 45% of the redacted text overall. * \\"Personal privacy\\" – an estimated 5–7% of the redactions. * \\"Investigative technique\\" – an estimated 8–10% of the redactions. * \\"Grand jury\\" – over 300 redactions and about 38% of the redacted text overall. = Press coverage of the investigation = The Associated Press and Slate observed that the Mueller report mostly corroborated press coverage of the investigation. Kyle Pope, editor of the Columbia Journalism Review, remarked that \\"The media looks a lot stronger today than it did before the release of this report\\", asserting that Mueller's report absolved the media of its coverage of the investigation, the fairness, accuracy, and objectivity of which was repeatedly derided by President Trump and his allies as \\"fake news\\" and a part of a concerted \\"Witch-Hunt\\". The Washington Post stated that the report \\"offered a rich portrait of Trump's efforts as president to undermine the investigation and mislead the public\\". The Washington Post reported that while some press reports on the investigation proved wrong, or at least were not confirmed by the Mueller report, \\"the Mueller report was by and large an affirmation of the mainstream media's investigative reporting. Almost all the big stories were confirmed in the report\\". Notable reports that were not confirmed to be true by the report included: * Trump had \\"directed\\" Michael Cohen to lie to Congress. * Cohen was in Prague in 2016. * Russian Alfa Bank server was communicating with a Trump Organization server. * Paul Manafort secretly met with Julian Assange. * The 2016 Republican platform eased its policy on Ukraine at the behest of Trump or Russia. = False and misleading public statements by the Trump administration = Politifact published a list of eight notable public assertions Trump and his administration made that the Mueller report showed to be false or misleading: * Mueller had conflicts of interest and was turned down to become FBI director.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 80: _The President Asserts that the Special Counsel has Conflicts of Interest_ In the days following the Special Counsel's appointment, the President repeatedly told advisors, including Priebus, Bannon, and McGahn, that Special Counsel Mueller had conflicts of interest. The President cited as conflicts that Mueller had interviewed for the FBI Director position shortly before being appointed as Special Counsel, that he had worked for a law firm that represented people affiliated with the President, and that Mueller had disputed certain fees relating to his membership in a Trump golf course in Northern Virginia. The President's advisors pushed back on his assertion of conflicts, telling the President they did not count as true conflicts. * Trump asserted he hadn't thought about firing Mueller.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 82: \\"On June 9, 2017, the Special Counsel's Office informed the White House Counsel's Office that investigators intended to interview intelligence community officials who had allegedly been asked by the President to push back against the Russia investigation. On Monday, June 12, 2017, Christopher Ruddy, the chief executive of Newsmax Media and a longtime friend of the President's, met at the White House with Priebus and Bannon. Ruddy recalled that they told him the President was strongly considering firing the Special Counsel and that he would do so precipitously, without vetting the decision through Administration officials. Ruddy asked Priebus if Ruddy could talk publicly about the discussion they had about the Special Counsel, and Priebus said he could. Priebus told Ruddy he hoped another blow up like the one that followed the termination of Comey did not happen. Later that day, Ruddy stated in a televised interview that the President was 'considering perhaps terminating the Special Counsel' based on purported conflicts of interest. Ruddy later told another news outlet that 'Trump is definitely considering' terminating the Special Counsel and 'it's not something that's being dismissed.' Ruddy's comments led to extensive coverage in the media that the President was considering firing the Special Counsel.\\" * Press secretary Sarah Sanders asserted that Trump fired James Comey because \\"countless\\" FBI agents told her they had lost faith in him.Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 71–72: \\"That same morning, on May 10, 2017, the President called McCabe. According to a memorandum McCabe wrote following the call, the President asked McCabe to come over to the White House to discuss whether the President should visit FBI headquarters and make a speech to employees. The President said he had received 'hundreds' of messages from FBI employees indicating their support for terminating Comey. The President also told McCabe that Comey should not have been permitted to travel back to Washington, D.C. on the FBI's airplane after he had been terminated and that he did not want Comey 'in the building again', even to collect his belongings. When McCabe met with the President that afternoon, the President, without prompting, told McCabe that people in the FBI loved the President, estimated that at least 80% of the FBI had voted for him, and asked McCabe who he had voted for in the 2016 presidential election. In the afternoon of May 10, 2017, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders spoke to the President about his decision to fire Comey and then spoke to reporters in a televised press conference. Sanders told reporters that the President, the Department of Justice, and bipartisan members of Congress had lost confidence in Comey, '[a]nd most importantly, the rank and file of the FBI had lost confidence in their director. Accordingly, the President accepted the recommendation of his Deputy Attorney General to remove James Comey from his position.' In response to questions from reporters, Sanders said that Rosenstein decided 'on his own' to review Comey's performance and that Rosenstein decided 'on his own' to come to the President on Monday, May 8 to express his concerns about Comey. When a reporter indicated that the 'vast majority' of FBI agents supported Comey, Sanders said, 'Look, we've heard from countless members of the FBI that say very different things.' Following the press conference, Sanders spoke to the President, who told her she did a good job and did not point out any inaccuracies in her comments. Sanders told this Office that her reference to hearing from 'countless members of the FBI' was a 'slip of the tongue'. She also recalled that her statement in a separate press interview that rank-and-file FBI agents had lost confidence in Comey was a comment she made 'in the heat of the moment' that was not founded on anything.\\" * Sanders asserted that a DOJ internal review had prompted Comey's firing.Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 72–73: \\"Also on May 10, 2017, Sessions and Rosenstein each spoke to McGahn and expressed concern that the White House was creating a narrative that Rosenstein had initiated the decision to fire Comey. The White House Counsel's Office agreed that it was factually wrong to say that the Department of Justice had initiated Comey's termination, and McGahn asked attorneys in the White House Counsel's Office to work with the press office to correct the narrative.\\" * Sanders claimed Trump \\"certainly didn't dictate\\" a statement by Donald Trump Jr. regarding the Trump Tower meeting.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 105: \\"After consulting with the President on the issue, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told the media that the President 'certainly didn't dictate' the statement, but that 'he weighed in, offered suggestions like any father would do.' Several months later, the President's personal counsel stated in a private communication to the Special Counsel's Office that 'the President dictated a short but accurate response to the New York Times article on behalf of his son, Donald Trump, Jr.' The President later told the press that it was 'irrelevant' whether he dictated the statement and said, 'It's a statement to the New York Times ... That's not a statement to a high tribunal of judges. * Trump asserted that the Steele dossier triggered the initial FBI investigation and the investigation \\"was a plan by those who lost the election\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 6: \\"On July 31, 2016, based on the foreign government reporting, the FBI opened an investigation into potential coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the Trump campaign.\\" * Trump repeatedly asserted, during 2016–2017, that he had no business involvement in Russia.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 134: \\"The President's conduct involving Michael Cohen spans the full period of our investigation. During the campaign, Cohen pursued the Trump Tower Moscow project on behalf of the Trump Organization. Cohen briefed candidate Trump on the project numerous times, including discussing whether Trump should travel to Russia to advance the deal. After the media began questioning Trump's connections to Russia, Cohen promoted a 'party line' that publicly distanced Trump from Russia and asserted he had no business there. Cohen continued to adhere to that party line in 2017, when Congress asked him to provide documents and testimony in its Russia investigation. In an attempt to minimize the President's connections to Russia, Cohen submitted a letter to Congress falsely stating that he only briefed Trump on the Trump Tower Moscow project three times, that he did not consider asking Trump to travel to Russia, that Cohen had not received a response to an outreach he made to the Russian government, and that the project ended in January 2016, before the first Republican caucus or primary. While working on the congressional statement, Cohen had extensive discussions with the President's personal counsel, who, according to Cohen, said that Cohen should not contradict the President and should keep the statement short and 'tight'. After the FBI searched Cohen's home and office in April 2018, the President publicly asserted that Cohen would not 'flip' and privately passed messages of support to him. Cohen also discussed pardons with the President's personal counsel and believed that if he stayed on message, he would get a pardon or the President would do 'something else' to make the investigation end. But after Cohen began cooperating with the government in July 2018, the President publicly criticized him, called him a 'rat', and suggested his family members had committed crimes.\\" * Trump claimed Comey sought a dinner with him when actually Trump invited Comey for dinner.Mueller Report, vol. II, pp. 33–36: \\"Also on January 27, the President called FBI Director Comey and invited him to dinner that evening. Priebus recalled that before the dinner, he told the President something like, 'don't talk about Russia, whatever you do,' and the President promised he would not talk about Russia at the dinner. McGahn had previously advised the President that he should not communicate directly with the Department of Justice to avoid the perception or reality of political interference in law enforcement. When Bannon learned about the President's planned dinner with Comey, he suggested that he or Priebus also attend, but the President stated that he wanted to dine with Comey alone. Comey said that when he arrived for the dinner that evening, he was surprised and concerned to see that no one else had been invited. Comey provided an account of the dinner in a contemporaneous memo, an interview with this Office, and congressional testimony. According to Comey's account of the dinner, the President repeatedly brought up Comey's future, asking whether he wanted to stay on as FBI director. Because the President had previously said he wanted Comey to stay on as FBI director, Comey interpreted the President's comments as an effort to create a patronage relationship by having Comey ask for his job. The President also brought up the Steele reporting that Comey had raised in the January 6, 2017, briefing and stated that he was thinking about ordering the FBI to investigate the allegations to prove they were false. Comey responded that the President should think carefully about issuing such an order because it could create a narrative that the FBI was investigating him personally, which was incorrect. Later in the dinner, the President brought up Flynn and said, 'the guy has serious judgment issues.' Comey did not comment on Flynn and the President did not acknowledge any FBI interest in or contact with Flynn. According to Comey's account, at one point during the dinner the President stated, 'I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.' Comey did not respond and the conversation moved on to other topics, but the President returned to the subject of Comey's job at the end of the dinner and repeated, 'I need loyalty.' Comey responded, 'You will always get honesty from me.' The President said, 'That's what I want, honest loyalty.' Comey said, 'You will get that from me.' After Comey's account of the dinner became public, the President and his advisors disputed that he had asked for Comey's loyalty. The President also indicated that he had not invited Comey to dinner, telling a reporter that he thought Comey had 'asked for the dinner' because 'he wanted to stay on.' But substantial evidence corroborates Comey's account of the dinner invitation and the request for loyalty. The President's Daily Diary confirms that the President 'extend[ed] a dinner invitation' to Comey on January 27. With respect to the substance of the dinner conversation, Comey documented the President's request for loyalty in a memorandum he began drafting the night of the dinner; senior FBI officials recall that Comey told them about the loyalty request shortly after the dinner occurred; and Comey described the request while under oath in congressional proceedings and in a subsequent interview with investigators subject to penalties for lying under 18 U.S.C. § 1001. Comey's memory of the details of the dinner, including that the President requested loyalty, has remained consistent throughout.\\" Vox reported that the Mueller report showed Sanders and her predecessor, Sean Spicer, made false statements about the circumstances surrounding the firings of Comey and Michael Flynn. The Mueller report showed that despite assertions by Hope Hicks and Jason Miller in September 2016 that Carter Page never had any involvement with the campaign, Page actually produced work for the campaign, traveled with Trump to a campaign speech and \\"Chief policy adviser Sam Clovis expressed appreciation for Page's work and praised his work to other Campaign officials\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 98: \\"In May 2016, Page prepared an outline of an energy policy speech for the Campaign and then traveled to Bismarck, North Dakota, to watch the candidate deliver the speech. Chief policy advisor Sam Clovis expressed appreciation for Page's work and praised his work to other Campaign officials.\\" = Other findings = The Mueller report devoted over a dozen pages to refute an argument made by Trump's attorneys, and by Barr before he joined the Trump administration, that it was impossible for Trump to obstruct the investigation, regardless of his intentions, due to his presidential authority to oversee federal law enforcementan interpretation that some legal scholars characterized as dubious because it suggests a president is above the law. The report confirmed significant aspects of reporting, primarily by The Wall Street Journal, of efforts by Republican activist Peter Smith to locate deleted Clinton emails, including his communications about it with Michael Flynn and campaign co-chair Sam Clovis, as well as Flynn's actions to spearhead the effort at Trump's repeated requests. In at least one email to an undisclosed list of recipients, Smith claimed to know WikiLeak's schedule about releasing the Clinton emails, writing there was a \\"tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days\\", and that WikiLeaks \\"has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this allows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8.\\"Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 62: \\"Smith continued to send emails to an undisclosed recipient list about Clinton's deleted emails until shortly before the election. For example, on October 28, 2016, Smith wrote that there was a 'tug-of-war going on within WikiLeaks over its planned releases in the next few days,' and that WikiLeaks 'has maintained that it will save its best revelations for last, under the theory this allows little time for response prior to the U.S. election November 8. The report confirmed significant parts of reporting regarding a January 2017 meeting in Seychelles between Erik Prince, George Nader, and Putin confidant Kirill Dmitriev, among others. Despite Prince's prior congressional testimony that he had no role in the Trump campaign or transition, the report found that Nader had represented Prince to Dmitriev as \\"designated by Steve [Bannon] to meet you! I know him and he is very very well connected and trusted by the New Team\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 153: \\"Nader wrote to Dmitriev, 'This guy [Prince] is designated by Steve [Bannon] to meet you! I know him and he is very very well connected and trusted by the New Team. His sister is now a Minister of Education.\\" The Mueller Report stated, \\"According to Nader, Prince had led him to believe that Bannon was aware of Prince's upcoming meeting with Dmitriev, and Prince acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team. Bannon, however, told the Office that Prince did not tell him in advance about his meeting with Dmitriev\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 153: \\"According to Nader, Prince had led him to believe that Bannon was aware of Prince's upcoming meeting with Dmitriev, and Prince acknowledged that it was fair for Nader to think that Prince would pass information on to the Transition Team. Bannon, however, told the Office that Prince did not tell him in advance about his meeting with Dmitriev.\\" Prince testified to the House Intelligence Committee that \\"I didn't fly there to meet any Russian guy\\", although the Mueller Report found that he and Nader made significant preparations to meet Dmitriev.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 151. Although Prince had previously characterized a second meeting between him and Dmitriev in a bar as a chance encounter of no consequence, the Mueller report found the meeting was actually pre-arranged after Prince had learned from communications back home that Russia had positioned an aircraft carrier off Libya and he wanted to convey that the United States would not accept any Russian involvement in Libya. House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff announced on April 30, 2019, that he was sending a criminal referral to the Justice Department alleging Prince had provided false testimony to the committee. The special counsel sought to interview Trump for more than a year, advising his attorneys that \\"it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview to take place\\" and offering \\"numerous accommodations to aid the President's preparation and avoid surprise\\".Mueller Report, Appendix C, p. C-1: \\"We additionally stated that \\"it is in the interest of the Presidency and the public for an interview to take place\\" and offered 'numerous accommodations to aid the President's preparation and avoid surprise'.\\" Trump's attorneys resisted these requests, which the special counsel accepted written responses to questions. The Mueller report stated that Trump asserted more than thirty times that he could not remember information that had been asked, and that other answers were \\"incomplete or imprecise\\".Mueller Report, Appendix C, p. C-1: \\"We received the President's written responses in late November 2018. In December 2018, we informed counsel of the insufficiency of those responses in several respects. We noted, among other things, that the President stated on more than 30 occasions that he 'does not recall' or 'remember' or have an 'independent recollection' of information called for by the questions. Other answers were 'incomplete or imprecise'. The written responses, we informed counsel, 'demonstrate the inadequacy of the written format, as we have had no opportunity to ask followup questions that would ensure complete answers and potentially refresh your client's recollection or clarify the extent or nature of his lack of recollection'. We again requested an in-person interview, limited to certain topics, advising the President's counsel that '[t]his is the President's opportunity to voluntarily provide us with information for us to evaluate in the context of all of the evidence we have gathered.' The President declined.\\" Trump did not provide written responses to questions relating to obstruction of justice or events during the transition.Mueller Report, vol. II, p.13: \\"He did not similarly agree to provide written answers to questions on obstruction topics or questions on events during the transition\\" The special counsel considered subpoenaing Trump's testimony but decided against it because it would likely result in protracted constitutional litigation that would delay conclusion of the investigation, and because investigators had by then acquired information they sought by other means.Mueller Report, Appendix C, p. C-2: \\"Recognizing that the President would not be interviewed voluntarily, we considered whether to issue a subpoena for his testimony. We viewed the written answers to be inadequate. But at that point, our investigation had made significant progress and had produced substantial evidence for our report. We thus weighed the costs of potentially lengthy constitutional litigation, with resulting delay in finishing our investigation, against the anticipated benefits for our investigation and report. As explained in Volume II, Section H.B., we determined that the substantial quantity of information we had obtained from other sources allowed us to draw relevant factual conclusions on intent and credibility, which are often inferred from circumstantial evidence and assessed without direct testimony from the subject of the investigation.\\" The Mueller report elaborated on earlier reporting regarding communications between Felix Sater and Michael Cohen during 2015–2016 to pursue construction of Trump Tower Moscow, at a time Trump denied any business involvement in Russia. The report found that Sater, a former Trump business associate, asserted to Cohen that he had Russian contacts who could gain Vladimir Putin's support for the project, adding \\"I think I can get Putin to [praise Trump's business acumen] at the Trump Moscow press conference\\", and \\"We can own this election. Michael my next steps are very sensitive with Putin's very very close people, we can pull this off\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 72: \\"I think I can get Putin to say that at the Trump Moscow press conference. If he says it we own this election. America's most difficult adversary agreeing that Donald is a good guy to negotiate ... We can own this election. Michael my next steps are very sensitive with Putin's very, very close people, we can pull this off. Michael let's go. 2 boys from Brooklyn getting a USA president elected. This is good, really good.\\" The report also found that Cohen had discussed particulars of the project with Ivanka Trump and Donald Trump Jr.Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 69: \\"Cohen also discussed the Trump Moscow project with Ivanka Trump as to design elements (such as possible architects to use for the project) and Donald J. Trump Jr. (about his experience in Moscow and possible involvement in the project) during the fall of 2015.\\" The report states, \\"According to Cohen, he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time. Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump Tower Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the candidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant 'infomercial' for Trump-branded properties\\".Mueller Report, vol. I, p. 72: \\"According to Cohen, he did not consider the political import of the Trump Moscow project to the 2016 U.S. presidential election at the time. Cohen also did not recall candidate Trump or anyone affiliated with the Trump Campaign discussing the political implications of the Trump Moscow project with him. However, Cohen recalled conversations with Trump in which the candidate suggested that his campaign would be a significant 'infomercial' for Trump-branded properties.\\" The Mueller report did not conclude Cohen had been in Prague, as had been described in the Steele dossier and reported by the McClatchy Company, citing his testimony to investigators.Mueller Report, vol. II, p. 139. = Book editions = The report was issued as a printed book by three publishers, and collated an aggregate 357,000 sales , making it a New York Times bestseller.  Reactions  = President Donald Trump = Trump has vacillated in his view of the report, initially saying, \\"The Mueller report was great. It could not have been better,\\" then one month later characterizing it as a \\"total 'hit job, then one month later as \\"a beautiful report\\". The Mueller report reported that Donald Trump's campaign staff, administration officials, and family members, his Republican backers, and his associates lied or made false assertions, whether intentional or unintentional, to the public, Congress, and authorities. On March 25, when the Barr letter had been released but not the report itself, Trump said of the special counsel's findings: \\"It's one hundred percent the way it should have been.\\" He further commented on the investigation, its potential origins, and its witnesses: \\"There are a lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things,\\" adding that they would need to be \\"looked at\\". President Trump's reaction to the Mueller report Upon the release of the redacted report on April 18, Trump commented: President Trump sent several tweets about the news, including one that mimicked promotional material for the television series Game of Thrones, featuring Trump turning his back, surrounded in mist, superimposed with the words \\"No collusion. No obstruction. For the haters and the radical left Democrats.\\" (image) HBO, owners of the rights to the series, commented that they \\"prefer our intellectual property not be used for political purposes\\". Trump had posted similar pictures on Twitter and Instagram on previous occasions, which HBO had chided. On April 19, Trump labeled the report \\"crazy\\", saying that some of the report's assertions about him were \\"total bullshit\\" and \\"fabricated and totally untrue\\". Calling for a new counter- investigation, he tweeted: \\"It is now finally time to turn the tables and bring justice to some very sick and dangerous people who have committed very serious crimes, perhaps even Spying or Treason.\\" He posted similar tweets in the following days. On April 23, Trump said of the investigation, \\"I don't believe our country should allow this ever to happen again. This will never happen again. We cannot let it ever happen again.\\" He went on to insinuate that \\"treasonous acts\\" were performed against him from \\"very high up\\" in the Obama administration. On April 24, Trump attacked the report's writers as \\"Angry Democrats and Trump Haters\\", tweeting: \\"If the partisan Dems ever tried to Impeach, I would first head to the U.S. Supreme Court.\\" Legal experts responded that Trump had misunderstood the Constitution, as impeachment is constitutionally within Congress' abilities and responsibilities and not the within that of the courts. On April 25, Trump denied the report's claim that he ordered former White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Mueller. He tweeted: On April 26, speaking to the National Rifle Association (NRA), Trump said, \\"They tried for a coup; didn't work out so well. And I didn't need a gun for that one, did I? All was taking place at the highest levels in Washington, D.C. […] Corruption at the highest level. A disgrace. Spying, surveillance, trying for an overthrowand we caught 'em, we caught 'em. Who would have thought in our country? But it's called […] 'draining the swamp'.\\" On May 29, Trump said regarding the report \\"The Mueller report came out: no obstruction, no collusion, no nothing. It's a beautiful report.\\" The next day Trump made a similar remark about Mueller's report saying \\"There's no obstruction, there's no collusion, there's no nothing. It's nothing but a witch hunt. A witch hunt by the media and the Democrats, they're partners.\\" With Mueller set to testify to Congress about his report in July 2019, Trump falsely claimed in June 2019 that Mueller had illegally deleted communication records between Peter Strzok and Lisa Page (there were lost records which were later retrieved, but there is no indication Mueller was involved in processes on this matter). Trump declared in early July 2019 that Mueller \\"must\\" restrict his testimony to \\"the report\\". In late July 2019, Trump said that Mueller's testifying would be \\"bad\\" for Mueller. With Mueller's aide Aaron Zebley also about to testify to Congress, Trump criticized Zebley, characterizing him as a \\"Never Trumper lawyer\\" (Zebley has never donated to any political party). Trump also criticized Zebley for his role in private law practice representing Bill Cooper, who had connections to Bill and Hillary Clinton regarding her emails.  White House interaction with Don McGahn  The Wall Street Journal reported on May 10, 2019, that within a day of the release of the Mueller report, Trump sought to have McGahn declare that he didn't think the president's directive to have Mueller fired constituted obstruction of justice, but McGahn refused. On May 10, 2019, The New York Times reported that the White House, in April and/or May, asked McGahn twice to declare that Trump never obstructed justice. \\"His reluctance angered the president, who believed that Mr. McGahn showed disloyalty by telling investigators for the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, about Mr. Trump's attempts to maintain control over the Russia investigation,\\" the New York Times notes. One request was sent to McGahn's lawyer, William A. Burck, before the report was made public but after Trump's lawyers received a copy. Trump's lawyers noticed that Mueller left out McGahn's belief that Trump never obstructed justice. Responding to the first request; \\"We did not perceive it as any kind of threat or something sinister,\\" Burck replied in a statement. \\"It was a request, professionally and cordially made.\\" After the Mueller report was released, McGahn passed on the opportunity on putting out the statement. The White House tried once more and asked McGahn to publish the statement. McGahn declined.  September 2019  On September 30, 2019, The New York Times reported that two American officials stated that President Trump told Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, to help Attorney General William Barr in a Justice Department inquiry, that, according to The New York Times, Trump hopes will discredit the Mueller investigation and validate his 2016 victory. The White House curbed access to the transcript of the phone call, allegedly done by the request of Barr, however only allowing a small group of aides access. The White House responded by dismissing the reports, claiming that it was part of a routine request to grant Australian authorities access to Department of Justice resources to facilitate an investigation that had been open for several months. = Trump's personal lawyers = Trump's lawyers said in a statement: \\"After a 17-month investigation, testimony from some 500 witnesses, the issuance of 2,800 subpoenas, the execution of nearly 500 search warrants, early morning raids, the examination of more than 1.4 million pages of documents, and the unprecedented cooperation of the President, it is clear there was no criminal wrongdoing...This vindication of the President is an important step forward for the country and a strong reminder that this type of abuse must never be permitted to occur again.\\" It has been reported since July 2018, that Trump's personal lawyers are creating a \\"counter report\\" to contest the special counsel's findings on obstruction of justice. , according to Rudy Giuliani, they are finalizing the report and putting finishing touches. Giuliani has said that the counter report is about 45 pages long and consists of two sections. Giuliani told The Daily Beast in an interview that the contents were: the legitimacy of the Special Counsel investigation due to alleged conflict of interests surrounding Mueller, and alleged coordination between the Trump Campaign and Russia including obstruction of justice. Originally, according to Trump, the counter report was 87 pages long: \\"It has been incorrectly reported that Rudy Giuliani and others will not be doing a counter to the Mueller report. That is Fake News. Already 87 pages done, but obviously cannot complete until we see the final Witch Hunt Report\\". Since the public release of the Mueller report, Giuliani has suggested that they might not release the report for now: \\"There's probably a point at which we will use it. Right now we think the public debate is playing out about as well as it can. Why confuse it it raises a lot of issues that maybe we didn't have to respond to\\", Giuliani said. On April 21, Giuliani accused that the special counsel's team \\"came close to torturing people\\", and described a lawyer on the special counsel's team as a \\"hitman\\". Giuliani also stated: \\"There's nothing wrong with taking information from Russians. It depends on where it came from\\". Also on April 21, Giuliani falsely stated that \\"nothing was denied\\" by the Trump administration to investigators (Factcheck.org notes that the report stated Trump refused interviews). Giuliani additionally falsely stated that \\"you read that\\" Don McGahn \\"gave three different versions\\" of his conversation with Trump regarding firing Mueller (Factcheck.org also notes that the report stated McGahn only gave one version, and that Trump gave another version). Trump attorney Emmet Flood mocked the Mueller report as \\"part 'truth commission' report and part law school exam paper\\". = Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein = Former Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein On April 11, 2019, in his first interview since the conclusion of the Special Counsel he appointed, with The Wall Street Journal, Rosenstein defended Attorney General Barr's handling of the conclusions of the Special Counsel investigation. \\"He's being as forthcoming as he can, and so this notion that he's trying to mislead people, I think is just completely bizarre\\", Rosenstein said. Rosenstein also supported Barr's four-page letter by saying: \\"It would be one thing if you put out a letter and said, 'I'm not going to give you the report.'\\" What he said is, 'Look, it's going to take a while to process the report. In the meantime, people really want to know what's in it. I'm going to give you the top-line conclusions.' That's all he was trying to do\\". On April 25, 2019, Rosenstein spoke at the Armenian Bar Association's Public Servants Dinner in New York City. Rosenstein said that as a result of the investigation, there was now \\"overwhelming evidence that Russian operatives hacked American computers and defrauded American citizens, and that is only the tip of the iceberg of a comprehensive Russian strategy to influence elections, promote social discord, and undermine America, just like they do in many other countries [...] our nation is safer, elections are more secure, and citizens are better informed about covert foreign influence schemes.\\" Rosenstein discussed the result of the special counsel investigation, saying that he did agree to oversee it correctly and to its completion, but: \\"I did not promise to report all results to the public, because grand jury investigations are ex parte proceedings. It is not our job to render conclusive factual findings. We just decide whether it is appropriate to file criminal charges\\". However, according to Rosenstein, \\"not everybody was happy with [his] decision\\", as he went on to cite politicians who \\"need to evaluate everything in terms of the immediate political impact\\", and the media. Rosenstein reserved particular criticism for the media as \\"mercenary critics\\" who \\"launch ad hominem attacks unrestricted by truth or morality. They make threats, spread fake stories, and even attack your relatives. [...] A republic that endures is not governed by the news cycle. Some of the nonsense that passes for breaking news today would not be worth the paper was printed on, if anybody bothered to print it.\\" Rosenstein further said: \\"In politics as in journalism the rules of evidence do not apply.\\" Rosenstein criticized the Obama administration for failing to \\"publicize the full story\\" about the methods and the \\"broader strategy\\" of Russian interference in the American elections. Rosenstein also criticized members of the FBI for disclosing classified material, and criticized James Comey's conduct for announcing the counterintelligence investigation while Comey was still FBI Director and alleging that \\"the president pressured [Comey] to close the investigation\\" after Comey was fired. = Former Special Counsel Robert Mueller = After the Special Counsel concluded its investigation on March 22, Barr sent Congress a four-page letter about the Special Counsel's conclusions on March 24. On April 30, it was reported Mueller sent a letter to Barr on March 27, that expressed concerns about his four-page letter to Congress. Barr called Mueller to discuss about the letter and its contents. \\"The summary letter the Department sent to Congress and released to the public late in the afternoon of March 24 did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this office's work and conclusions\\", Mueller said in his letter to Barr. \\"There is now public confusion about critical aspects of the results of our investigation. This threatens to undermine a central purpose for which the Department appointed the Special Counsel: to assure full public confidence in the outcome of the investigations\\".  Barr's response to Mueller remarks  On May 30, 2019, CBS This Morning tweeted a clip from an interview with Attorney General William Barr discussing his thoughts on Mueller's remarks on May 29. \\"The opinion says you cannot indict a president while he's in office. But he [Mueller] could've reached a decision as to whether it was criminal activity.\\" Barr explained why the Mueller report did not determine whether Trump committed obstruction of justice: \\"the Deputy attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, and I felt it was necessary for us, as the heads of the department, to reach that decision.\\" When asked about whether Mueller was insinuating that Congress could be the other venue for reaching a conclusion on obstruction of justice, Barr replied by saying \\"Well, I'm not sure what he was suggesting, but, you know, the Department of Justice doesn't use our powers of investigating crimes as an adjunct to Congress.\\"  Mueller's statement on May 29  On May 29, 2019, Robert Mueller made statements before the public on his work as special counsel and the contents of his former office's report. Upon announcing the formal closure of the Office of the Special Counsel and his resignation from the Justice Department on May 29, 2019, Mueller said \\"the report is my testimony\\" and indicated he would have nothing to say that wasn't already in the report. He commented, \\"If we had had confidence that the president clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so. We did not, however, make a determination as to whether the president did commit a crime\\". \\"The introduction to the volume two of our report explains that decision. It explains that under longstanding department policy, a present president cannot be charged with a federal crime while he is in office\\". Also, \\"it would be unfair to potentially accuse somebody of a crime when there can be no court resolution of the actual charge\\". He said that, according to the Constitution, any potential wrongdoing by a president must be addressed by a \\"process other than the criminal justice system\\". This hinted that Congress could now pick up the investigation or start impeachment proceedings. Additionally, Mueller stressed that the central conclusion of his investigation was \\"that there were multiple, systematic efforts to interfere in our election. That allegation deserves the attention of every American\\".  Mueller's testimony on July 24  Mueller testified before Congress on July 24, 2019, answering questions asked by Representatives. Democrat Ted Lieu asked Mueller whether the reason he did not indict Trump was that Department of Justice policy prohibits the indictment of sitting presidents. Mueller originally confirmed that this was the reason. However, later that day, Mueller corrected his comments, stating that his team did not determine whether Trump committed a crime. Additionally, Mueller answered Republican Ken Buck that a president could be charged with obstruction of justice (or other crimes) after the president left office. Mueller testified that Trump's written responses to questions from investigators were \\"generally\\" untruthful and incomplete. Stephan Roh, who says he represents Joseph Mifsud, told The Washington Post that Mifsud was actually a \\"Western intelligence element.\\" Papadopoulos and some critics of the Russia investigation have asserted Mifsud was instructed to entrap Papadopoulos in order to justify the investigation. During Mueller's testimony, Republicans Jim Jordan and Devin Nunes sought to portray Mifsud as a central figure in what they asserted was an investigation initiated on false and politically motivated premises, while Democrats characterized their assertion as a diversion and conspiracy theory. Mueller declined to address the matter as the origin of the investigation was then the subject of a DOJ inquiry. = Other Justice Department officials = On April 25, The Washington Post published a report quoting an anonymous \\"senior Justice Department official\\". The official said that the \\"special counsel never decided whether [obstruction of justice] is a prosecutable case [against Trump], so there's no conflict between the attorney general's decision that it's not [prosecutable] and the special counsel's report\\". Regarding obstruction of justice, the official said: \\"All the attorney general was deciding was whether this was a prosecutable offense, and we don't bring criminal charges at the department unless we believe we can prove them beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury\\". Regarding the President's efforts to curtail the Special Counsel investigation in the episode involving Corey Lewandowski, the official said it would be hard to justify a prosecution because the obstruction relies on multiple people in a chain all doing something\\" and that it was \\"a very attenuated chain\\", exacerbated \\"given that the note isn't even an order\\". The official alluded to the belief that prosecutors would not be able to prove that Trump had wanted to shut down the investigation with corrupt intent, because according to the official, there was no underlying crime to cover up. = James Comey = FBI Director James Comey On May 1, 2019, James Comey wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times, in which he wrote about his thoughts on President Trump, Attorney General William Barr, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, among others: On May 8, 2019, in an interview with CBS This Morning, James Comey called Attorney General William Barr's four-page-letter to Congress summarizing the report \\"misleading\\" and \\"inadequate\\". \\"It certainly gave the impression that Bob Mueller had decided that he was not going to rule on this question of obstruction of justice when that's not what Mueller did. Mueller laid it out and signaled to a future prosecutor after this individual is out of office you ought to take a serious look at charging him,\\" Comey said. Comey also talked about the ten episodes of alleged obstruction of justice detailed within the report \\"deeply concerning\\" to him. On May 10, 2019, Comey participated in an CNN town hall event with Anderson Cooper. Cooper asked about Comey's thoughts on Barr's handling of the report and related matters. \\"I think he acted in a way that's less than honorable in the way he described it in writing and described it during a press conference, and continues to talk as if he's the president's lawyer. That is not the attorney general's job,\\" Comey said. \\"It doesn't make me happy to say this, but I think he has lost most of his reputation with the way he's conducted himself,\\" Comey continued. Comey also commented about Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Comey called Rosenstein \\"a man of accomplishment but not of strong character,\\" reports CNN. Comey also slammed Rosenstein's comments about Trump's respect for the rule of law. Comey also said that if Trump were not president, he would be charged.  Rosenstein's response to Comey comments  On May 13, 2019, Rod Rosenstein fired back at Comey's remarks in front of the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC). \\"Now, the former director is a partisan pundit, selling books and earning speaking fees while speculating about the strength of my character and the fate of my immortal soul,\\" Rosenstein said. \\"That is disappointing. Speculating about souls is not a job for police and prosecutors. Generally, we base our opinions on eyewitness testimony.\\" Rosenstein also commented on why Comey deserved to be fired and Comey's handling of the Hillary Clinton email investigation in 2016. Gregg Re of Fox News reported Rosenstein's remarks: The clearest mistake was the director's decision to hold a press conference about an open case, reveal his recommendation and discuss details about the investigation, without the consent of the prosecutors and the attorney general,' Rosenstein said. 'Then, he chose to send a letter to the Congress on the eve of the election stating that one of the candidates was under criminal investigation, expecting it to be released immediately to the public.' Rosenstein added 'Those actions were not within the range of reasonable decisions. They were inconsistent with our goal of communicating to all FBI employees that they should respect the attorney general's role, refrain from disclosing information about criminal investigations, avoid disparaging uncharged persons, and above all, not take unnecessary steps that could influence an election. = Democrats = Congressional Democratic leaders called on Mueller to publicly testify before Congress, renewing demands for the entire report to be released and raising concern over the President's conduct detailed in the report. House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler announced he would issue a subpoena for the full report after the Justice Department released a redacted version. Democrats also criticized what they say were \\"orchestrated attempts\\" by the Trump administration to control the narrative surrounding the report's April 18 release. Nadler issued the subpoena on April 19. A DOJ spokesperson called Nadler's subpoena \\"premature and unnecessary\\", citing that the publicly released version of the report had \\"minimal redactions\\" and that Barr had already made arrangements for Nadler and other lawmakers to review a version with fewer redactions. On the May 1 deadline of the subpoena, the DOJ rejected it as \\"not legitimate oversight\\" and that \\"the requests in the subpoena are overbroad and extraordinarily burdensome\\", adding that grand jury material cannot be released without a court order. The House Intelligence Committee subpoenaed the full report on May 8. Some Democrats suggested the possibility that refusing to comply with subpoenas could result in the Democratic- controlled House declaring inherent contempt to garnish the incomes of or even jail individuals who did not comply. On May 22, 2019, the Justice Department agreed to share some counterintelligence and foreign intelligence with the Intelligence Committee, causing chairman Schiff to cancel a scheduled meeting for Democrats to vote on \\"enforcement action\\" against the Justice department. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer released a joint statement saying \\"Special Counsel Mueller's report paints a disturbing picture of a president who has been weaving a web of deceit, lies, and improper behavior and acting as if the law doesn't apply to him\\". Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin stated \\"The Special Counsel's findings paint a very different picture than what the President and his Attorney General would have the American people believe\\", and called the details of the Russian contacts with the Trump campaign and Trump's efforts to impede the investigation \\"troubling\\". Massachusetts Senator and former 2020 United States presidential election candidate Elizabeth Warren, citing the \\"severity\\" of the \\"misconduct\\" detailed in the report, called for the House to initiate impeachment proceedings against Trump, the first 2020 election candidate to do so post- report. New Jersey Senator Cory Booker, also a former 2020 presidential candidate, called for the full release of the report, stating in an earlier tweet: \\"The American people deserve the truth. Not spin from a Trump appointee. Release Mueller's full report now\\". = Republicans = Most Republican lawmakers had no immediate comments on the report due to the report coming out during Congress' spring recess. House Republican leaders viewed the report as vindication of President Trump and signaled that lawmakers should move on. On April 18, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy stated \\"Nothing we saw today changes the underlying results of the 22-month-long Mueller investigation that ultimately found no collusion\\". House Minority Whip Steve Scalise tweeted \\"Democrats owe the American people an apology\\", along with a statement declaring the probe to be dead. Ohio Representative Jim Jordan, the Ranking Member on the House Oversight Committee, stated \\"They do want people who launched this investigation, on a false premise, they do want them held accountable\\", referring to retaliatory sentiment among Trump supporters about the origin of the Russia investigation, specifically the Steele dossier. \\"You can't have the FBI using one party's opposition research document to launch an investigation and spy on the other party's campaign. We know that took place and we do need to get to the bottom of that because it's never supposed to happen in this country\\", Jordan added. However, the House Intelligence Committee, then controlled by Republicans, released in 2017 a report that stated that the Russia investigation had not started from information in the Steele dossier, but from information that the FBI received on George Papadopoulos. On April 19, Utah Senator Mitt Romney wrote in a statement on Twitter that he was \\"sickened\\" and \\"appalled\\" by the findings in the report, and said reading the report was a \\"sobering revelation of how far we have strayed from the aspirations and the principles of the founders\\". Romney later expounded on his comments in a press release by saying \\"It is good news that there was insufficient evidence to charge the President of the United States with having conspired with a foreign adversary or with having obstructed justice. The alternative would have taken us through a wrenching process with the potential for constitutional crisis. The business of government can move on.\\" On April 28, Senator Lindsey Graham, head of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said on Face the Nation; \\"I don't care what they talked about. He didn't do anything. The point is the president did not impede Mueller from doing his investigation...I don't care what happened between him and Don McGahn\\", Graham continued: \\"Here's what I care about: Was Mueller allowed to do his job? And the answer is yes\\". On May 1, Graham falsely stated that on \\"obstruction of justice, Mr. Mueller left it to Mr. Barr to decide after two years, and all this time. He said, 'Mr. Barr, you decide. Mueller did not ask Barr to make the decision, and Barr later said that he had not talked directly to Mueller about making that decision. Graham also falsely stated that the special counsel investigation \\"concluded there was no collusion\\", when collusion was not addressed in the report but criminal conspiracy was. Republican congressman Justin Amash stated in May 2019 that he concluded from the Mueller report that Trump engaged in impeachable conduct and \\"it is clear that Barr intended to mislead the public about Special Counsel Robert Mueller's analysis and findings,\\" adding, \\"Barr's misrepresentations are significant but often subtle, frequently taking the form of sleight-of-hand qualifications or logical fallacies, which he hopes people will not notice.\\" = Former federal prosecutors = In early May 2019, more than 1,000 former federal prosecutors who had served under both Republican and Democratic administrations published a statement entitled \\"Statement by Former Federal Prosecutors\\" on Medium. They declared: The former prosecutors found three types of acts described in the Mueller report which \\"satisfy all of the elements for an obstruction charge\\": * \\"The President's efforts to fire Mueller and to falsify evidence about that effort\\" – referencing the episodes of Volume II section E and Volume II section I * \\"The President's efforts to limit the scope of Mueller's investigation to exclude his conduct\\" – referencing the episodes of Volume II section H and Volume II section F * \\"The President's efforts to prevent witnesses from cooperating with investigators probing him and his campaign\\" – referencing the episodes of Volume II section K and Volume II section JMueller Report, vol. II The effort was organized by the nonpartisan, nonprofit organization Protect Democracy, a sister organization of United to Protect Democracy. On May 30, 2019, a video hosted by Robert De Niro featured 11 former federal prosecutors who endorsed the statement. \\"We all strongly believe that there is more than enough evidence to indict President Trump for multiple felony counts of obstruction of justice\\", former assistant U.S. Attorney Jennifer Rodgers said. In April 2019, Former Deputy Attorney General and former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates remarked, \\"I've personally prosecuted obstruction cases on far, far less evidence than this, and yes, I believe if [Trump] were not the president of the United States, he would likely be indicted on obstruction\\". = Commentators = After the release of the report, media commentators again pointed out that in 2018, Barr, before rejoining government work, had authored an unsolicited memo to the Justice Department describing investigation into potential obstruction of justice by Trump was \\"fatally misconceived\\" and \\"overly aggressive\\", and also noted that the Barr memo argued that a president could not be charged for acts of presidential power, such as firing officials. NPR's Ron Elving, in referring to the memo, described that \\"we got the word on\\" the result on obstruction \\"early\\" because \\"Barr had already authored a 19-page explanation for why a president could not be charged with obstruction of justice – suggesting pointedly that Mueller should not even be thinking about it\\". Although generally a liberal, Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz, who has been among Trump's most prominent defenders in the Russia investigation, gave the report an \\"incomplete\\" on the conclusion of obstruction of justice, \\"C+\\" on legal analysis, and a \\"B+\\" on factual analysis, in an interview with Fox News. Dershowitz also gave the media coverage of the report an \\"F\\"; \\"Even with grade inflation, I just think the media comes off awful, terrible, for the most part. I think we are seeing an elimination of the distinction between the editorial page and the news pages in some of the leading media in the country, and that's a shame. Walter Cronkite could not get a job in the media today\\", Dershowitz said. Fordham University law professor Jed Shugerman opined in the New York Times that: \\"The report's very high standard for legal conclusions for criminal charges was explicitly proof 'beyond a reasonable doubt'. So the report did not establish crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. But it did show a preponderance of conspiracy and coordination\\". In Shugerman's view, the preponderance of evidence standard is \\"relevant for counterintelligence and general parlance about facts, and closer to the proper standard for impeachment\\". He continues: \\"By the preponderance of evidence standard, the report contains ample evidence to establish conspiracy and coordination with the Russian government, sometimes through intermediaries, other times through a Russian spy\\". The Starr Report on President Clinton, which was organized as an \\"impeachment referral, not a prosecution decision\\", applied a lower standard of \\"substantial and credible information\\" more like the preponderance of the evidence standard. The Mueller report explained that the ability to conclude using the criminal proof beyond a reasonable doubt standard was \\"materially impaired\\" by lies by individuals associated with the Trump campaign and deletion of emails, among other factors. = Polling = A public opinion poll by Reuters and Ipsos conducted between the afternoon of April 18, 2019, and the morning of April 19 found that 37 percent of adults in the United States approved of Trump's performance in office, down from 40 percent in a similar poll conducted on April 15 and matching the lowest level of the year. The approval rating was also down from 43 percent in a poll conducted shortly after the Attorney General's summary was released on March 22. Among the respondents that said they were familiar with the Mueller report, 70 percent said the report had not changed their view of Trump or Russia's involvement in the U.S. presidential race and 15 percent said they had learned something that changed their view of Trump or the Russia investigation. A poll by The Washington Post and ABC News conducted between April 22–25, after the Mueller report was released, found that 51% of respondents believed the investigation was fair; 53% said that it did not clear Trump of all wrongdoing; 58% said that Trump lied about matters that were investigated; 56% said that impeachment should not proceed; and support for impeachment is at a new low of 37%. A plurality of 47% said Trump tried to obstruct justice. A YouGov and Huffington Post poll of 1000 American adults conducted on May 29 and 30, 2019, found that 72% of 2016 Trump voters who were aware that Mueller had stated that he would not clear Trump of a crime, still believed that the Mueller report exonerated Trump. The figure among corresponding Hillary Clinton voters and non-voters was 07% and 24% respectively. A Fox News poll of registered voters released on June 16, 2019, found that 50% believed the Trump campaign had coordinated with the Russian government, the highest level of the eight times the poll had asked that question since June 2017.  Subsequent actions with Congress  Since the release of the report, Congressional committees have been wanting more answers about the process and findings of the Special Counsel investigation. The Associated Press described Trump's response to post-Mueller congressional investigations as 'Just say no' and 'Resist on every legal front', noting that Trump on April 24 had declared: \\"We're fighting all the subpoenas. [...] I thought after two years we'd be finished with it. No, now the House goes and starts subpoenaing.\\" On May 8, 2019, Trump asserted that all materials requested by Congress, including the un-redacted Mueller report, are sheltered by executive privilege. This was a \\"protective assertion\\" of executive privilege to prevent Congress from receiving the un- redacted Mueller report and its underlying material for the time being, pending his decision to make a \\"final assertion\\" of executive privilege. Previously on April 18, Barr had said that the \\"president confirmed that, in the interests of transparency and full disclosure to the American people, he would not assert privilege over the special counsel's report\\". = House Judiciary Committee =  Robert Mueller  On April 18, 2019, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler sent Mueller a letter requesting his testimony before the House Judiciary Committee \\"as soon as possible but, in any event, no later than May 23, 2019\\". The Committee proposed that Mueller testify on May 15, but no agreement was ever reached. On May 10, Nadler said that Mueller would not testify the week of May 12. Nadler did not give a reason why but said \\"just hasn't developed\\". On May 24, Nadler said that \\"He doesn't want to be public in what some people will regard as a political spectacle, I think,\\" speaking about Mueller. \\"He's willing to make an opening statement, but he wants to testify in private,\\" Nadler continued. \\"We think it's important for the American people to hear from him and to hear his answers to questions about the report.\\" On June 25, 2019, Chairman Nadler and chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Adam Schiff, both publicly announced that Mueller agreed to publicly testify before House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on July 17. Both committees had subpoenaed Mueller's testimony. However, the hearing was postponed to July 24 with an third hour added for questions, bringing the total to three. On July 24, 2019, Mueller testified before the House Judiciary Committee after being subpoenaed. After the hearings, it was revealed that the House Judiciary Committee is \\"actively considering articles of impeachment and is seeking access to redacted materials from the Mueller report in order to decide whether to move forward with the process.\\"  Don McGahn  Don McGahn, former White House Counsel to President Trump On April 22, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Don McGahn to testify and to supply any documents related to the committee's investigation into obstruction of justice. The subpoena calls for the documents by May 7, and for McGahn to testify by May 21. The Trump administration is expected to exercise executive privilege on parts of McGahn's testimony. Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump, said on April 28, 2019: \\"Executive privilege is always an option, it's always on the table. But Don McGahn has already talked under oath for 30 hours. And this is just presidential harassment\\", Conway told Jake Tapper, adding that it is Trump's right to use executive privilege. Trump stated on May 2 that he would not allow McGahn to testify, and on May 7, the White House invoked executive privilege to withhold the documents that were subpoenaed. McGahn is expected to testify about President Trump's efforts to obstruct the Special Counsel, which McGahn said he was told to do but refused and threatened to resign if so ordered. McGahn's attorney said on May 7, that McGahn would \\"stand fast and do nothingcomply with neither the White House instructions nor the committee subpoenauntil the legal questions surrounding the dispute have been resolved\\". The attorney added that \\"Where co-equal branches of government are making contradictory demands on Mr. McGahn concerning the same set of documents, the appropriate response for Mr. McGahn is to maintain the status quo unless and until the Committee and Executive Branch can reach an accommodation.\\" On May 20, 2019, President Trump directed McGahn to not comply with a subpoena that would make McGahn testify before the committee on May 21.  William Barr  On April 26, 2019, the House Judiciary Committee announced that Barr would testify on May 2, regarding the Special Counsel investigation, its findings, allegations of obstruction of justice, and allegations of spying on the Trump Campaign. However, on April 28, 2019, Barr said he might not testify to the Committee because he was displeased about the format of the testimony he is expected to give. Nadler said \\"The witness [Barr] is not going to tell the committee how to conduct its hearing, period\\". On the prospect of Barr not showing up, Nadler stated: \\"Then we will have to subpoena him, and we will have to use whatever means we can to enforce the subpoena\\". Barr did testify before the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee on the same topics on May 1. On May 2, when Barr was to testify before the committee, Barr did not show up. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee, specifically Democratic Representative of Tennessee Steve Cohen, mocked Barr for not showing up, calling him \\"Chicken Barr\\". Cohen brought a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken and a chicken prop to mock Barr. On May 3, 2019, Nadler informed Barr that a subpoena had been issued giving him until May 6, 2019, to release the un-redacted Mueller report. Barr did not comply with the subpoena. The House Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on whether to bring forth Contempt of Congress on May 8. A law issued in 1857 gives Congress the power to issue criminal charges for this matter.Act of January 24, 1857, Ch. 19, sec. 1, 11 Stat. 155. On May 8, Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd wrote Nadler that Barr would ask Trump to invoke executive privilege to withhold the full report if the Judiciary Committee proceeded to vote on a contempt charge. Boyd wrote in the letter to Nadler saying \\"We are disappointed that you have rejected the Department of Justice's request to delay the vote of the Committee on the Judiciary on a contempt finding against the Attorney General this morning ... Accordingly, this is to advise you that the President has asserted executive privilege over the entirety of the subpoenaed materials.\\" Also on May 8, Barr wrote a letter to Trump to \\"request that you make protective assertion of executive privilege with respect to Department of Justice documents recently subpoenaed by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.\\" On May 8, Trump invoked executive privilege for those documents at Barr's request. Trump's announcement of executive privilege came just hours before the House Judiciary Committee planned to vote on whether to hold Barr in contempt. The Committee voted unanimously to reject this assertion of executive privilege and approved a motion put forward by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fl) which states that a vote to hold Barr in contempt would not \\"be construed as a directive for the Attorney General to violate Federal law or rules.\\" In a 24–16 vote, the House Judiciary Committee approved a motion of Contempt of Congress against Barr.  Hope Hicks  A day before Hope Hicks was expected to testify behind closed doors before the House Intelligence Committee on June 18, 2019, White House Counsel Pat Cipollone sent a letter to Committee chairman Jerry Nadler that President Trump instructed Hicks to not answer questions pertaining to her work at the White House. \\"Ms. Hicks is absolutely immune from being compelled to testify before Congress with respect to matters occurring during her service as a senior adviser to the President,\\" Cipollone says. \\"Because of this constitutional immunity, and in order to protect the prerogatives of the Office of the President, the President has directed Ms. Hicks not to answer questions before the Committee relating to the time of her service as a senior adviser to the President.\\" In the letter, Cipollone cited various Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) opinions arguing that Hicks is immune from compelled testimony, including one issued by the Justice Department in May that Trump cited when instructing former White House counsel Don McGahn not to testify before the committee pursuant to a subpoena. Cipollone also indicated that the White House may try to block Hicks from answering questions about her time on the presidential transition team because of potential executive privilege concerns. \\"Much of Ms. Hicks's work during this period involved discussions with the President-elect and his staff relating to the decisions the President-elect would be making once he assumed office,\\" Cipollone wrote. \\"Accordingly, her responses to specific questions about this period would likely implicate executive branch confidentiality interests concerning that decisionmaking process,\\" he wrote. \\"In order to preserve the President's ability to assert executive privilege over such information, a member of my office will attend Ms. Hicks's testimony on June 19.\\" During Hicks' testimony, lawyers for the Trump administration forbade Hicks from answering questions 155 times, claiming that due to \\"absolute immunity\\", Hicks \\"may not speak about anything that occurred during the time of her employment in the White House as a close adviser to the President\\". = Senate Judiciary Committee = On May 1, Attorney General Barr testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Barr said he \\"didn't exonerate\\" Trump on obstruction as that was not the role of the Justice Department. Barr explained his decision that there was not enough evidence for Trump to be charged with obstruction by citing that the president did not commit an underlying crime related to Russia. California Democratic Senator and 2020 presidential candidate Kamala Harris questioned why neither Barr nor Rosenstein reviewed the underlying evidence in the report. \\"We accepted the statements in the report as the factual record. We did not go underneath it to see whether or not they were accurate, we accepted it as accurate,\\" Barr said. He asserted this approach was common DOJ practice. Harris also asked Barr if Rosenstein had been cleared by ethics officials to be involved in the decision to not charge Trump of obstruction, given that Rosenstein was a witness to the investigation regarding James Comey's firing. Barr with the help of his aides concluded by saying \\"He was the acting attorney general on the Mueller investigation...I'm informed that before I arrived, he had been cleared by the ethics officials.\\" On the question of whether Trump could have ended the investigation, Barr said \\"the situation of the President, who has constitutional authority to supervise proceedings, if in fact a proceeding was not well founded, if it was a groundless proceeding, if it was based on false allegations, the President does not have to sit there, constitutionally, and allow it to run its course.\\" He added, \\"The President could terminate that proceeding, and it would not be a corrupt intent, because he was being falsely accused. He later said that Trump \\"knew [the accusations against him] were false. And he felt this investigation was unfair, propelled by his political opponents and was hampering his ability to govern. That is not a corrupt motive for replacing an independent counsel\\". Politico described these comments as \\"Barr's expansive view of presidential authority to meddle in investigations\\". New York argued against Barr's \\"perverse conclusion\\" because first, \\"Trump could not possibly know that an investigation was unfounded\\"; second, \\"Mueller did not say Trump was innocent\\"; and third, \\"Trump's obstruction was quite possibly one of the reasons Mueller failed to establish underlying crimes\\". Senator Richard Blumenthal asked Barr if he or his staff took notes on his March 28 call with Mueller. Barr confirmed there \\"were notes taken of the call\\", then told the committee that he would not share the notes with them: \\"Why should you have them?\\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi commented on Barr's testimony and accused Barr of lying before Congress. \\"What is deadly serious about it is the attorney general of the United States of America is not telling the truth to the Congress of the United States. That's a crime,\\" Pelosi told reporters. \\"He lied to Congress. If anybody else did that, it would be considered a crime. Nobody is above the law,\\" Pelosi said. Department of Justice spokeswoman Kerri Kupec responded to Pelosi's remarks and said that a \\"baseless attack on the Attorney General is reckless, irresponsible and false.\\" According to CNBC, Pelosi's remarks were talking about Barr's comments in his April 9 testimony. Representative Charlie Crist: \\"Reports have emerged recently, general, that members of the special counsel's team are frustrated at some level with the limited information included in your March 24 letter. ... Do you know what they are referencing with that?\\" Barr: \\"No, I don't. I think I think, I suspect that they probably wanted more put out, but in my view I was not interested in putting out summaries.\\" On May 8, 2019, the Senate Judiciary Committee subpoenaed Donald Trump Jr. to answer questions surrounding abandoned developments of a Trump Tower in Moscow. Trump Jr. has testified before the Committee on the same topic and related matters in September 2017. Trump Jr. is expected to testify sometime in June for a second closed-door interview. According to the Washington Post: \\"Trump Jr. will testify for up to four hours and address a limited number of questions, these people said on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\\" = House Intelligence Committee = The House Intelligence Committee announced on May 14, 2019, that it would investigate whether attorneys for Trump and his family membersJay Sekulow, Alan Futerfas, Abbe Lowell and Alan Garten\\"reviewed, shaped and edited\\" Michael Cohen's false testimony to Congress. On June 25, 2019, House Intelligence Committee Chairman, Adam Schiff, and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jerry Nadler, both publicly announced that Mueller agreed to publicly testify before House Judiciary and Intelligence Committees on July 17. On July 24, 2019, Mueller testified before the House Intelligence Committee after being subpoenaed. When asked as to why the Special Counsel did not subpoena President Trump, Mueller stated that they did not subpoena the president \\"because of the necessity of expediting\\" the investigation. \\"If we did subpoena the president, he would fight the subpoena and we would be in the midst of the investigation for a substantial period of time.\\"  Possible future releases  A less-redacted version of the report \\"with all redactions removed except those relating to grand-jury information\\", which is required to be redacted by federal law, is expected to be available two weeks after the initial public release, to \\"a bipartisan group of leaders from several Congressional committees\\". On April 19, 2019, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jerry Nadler issued a subpoena for the fully unredacted report. A DOJ spokesperson called Nadler's subpoena \\"premature and unnecessary\\", citing that the publicly released version of the report had \\"minimal redactions\\" and that Barr had already made arrangements for Nadler and other lawmakers to review a version with fewer redactions. Barr offered to let twelve designated members of Congress view the less-redacted report in a secure room at the Justice Department, and forbid them from sharing the contents with other legislators. Several Republicans took advantage of the offer; the six Democrats refused, saying the conditions were too stringent. On May 8, 2019, President Trump used a \\"protective assertion\\" of executive privilege to block the subpoena by the House of Representatives. Thus, for the time being, the House will not receive the unredacted Mueller Report and its underlying material, pending Trump's decision to make a \\"final assertion\\" of executive privilege after reviewing the subpoenaed material. Attorney General Barr had recommended earlier that day that Trump take this action. = Review of redactions = In March 2020, federal judge Reggie Walton, appointed to his position by President George W. Bush, declared that he would personally review the redactions made in the Mueller report to ensure that the redactions were legitimate. This came during a lawsuit filed by the pro-transparency Electronic Privacy Information Center and media outlet BuzzFeed News to release the full, unredacted report under the Freedom of Information Act. Walton cited that he had concerns on whether the redactions were legitimate, due to Attorney General William Barr having displayed a \\"lack of candor\\" regarding the report. According to Walton, Barr's March 24 letter not only had a \\"hurried release\\", but also \\"distorted\\" the findings of the report; while Barr went on to make \\"misleading public statements\\" about the report. As such, Walton had concerns that Barr may have made a \\"calculated attempt to influence public discourse\\" in favor of President Trump by establishing \\"a one-sided narrative\\" about the report which was contrary to the report's findings. Walton questioned if the report's redactions were then in fact \\"self-serving\\" to avoid conflict with Barr's statements, and if the Justice Department used \\"post-hoc rationalizations\\" to defend Barr. On June 19, 2020, in response to the lawsuit, the Department of Justice released a less-redacted public version of the Mueller report, revealing new information about Roger Stone and WikiLeaks. On October 6, 2020 President Trump, referencing the Mueller report, tweeted \\"I have fully authorized the total Declassification of any & all documents pertaining to the single greatest political CRIME in American History, the Russia Hoax”. In response to the President’s statement, BuzzFeed requested an unredacted versions of the report; however, BuzzFeed’s request for an unredacted report was denied by the Department of Justice (DOJ). The DOJ told Walton, “…the President’s statements on Twitter were not self-executing declassification orders...” To clear up the position of the President, Walton ordered a continuance until October 21, 2020 so, “I can get something from White House counsel saying that they conferred with the president, and the president, in fact, did not intend to declassify the information…”https://www.msn.com/en- us/news/politics/judge-orders-doj-to-find-out-if-trump-s-declassification- tweets-mean-entire-mueller-report-should-be-released/ar-BB1a6zDv On October 20, 2020, and contrary to Trump’s unambiguous Twitter statements, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows stated in a federal court filing that Trump’s tweets were not official orders to declassify FBI Russia probe documents.https://nypost.com/2020/10/20/mark-meadows-trump-didnt-declassify- russia-docs-in-tweets/  See also  * Cyberwarfare by Russia * Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections * Senate Intelligence Committee report on Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election  Notes   References   Further reading  * David Cole, \\"An Indictment in All But Name\\" (review of Robert S.

He worked in Hamburg, Kraków and Vienna. Around 1660, he also spent a short time in Flanders, perhaps working with Philips Wouwerman. This has resulted in some sources referring to him as a Dutch painter.  Life and work In 1652, he painted a panoramic view of Kraków. In 1655, he did an altarpiece on the Crucifixion for a church in the village of Jaidhof in Waldviertel. Other works are in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Many are only known through documents in the archives of aristocratic families. His still-lifes are of the Central European type, but he often personalized them for his major clients, such as Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria. The only documented event of his life was his death, in Vienna, at the home of Johann Kunibert von Wentzelsberg (?-1684), an art collector who worked as an agent for Karl II von Liechtenstein-Kastelkorn.\\"Portraits and Recent Acquisitions\\" @ Lawrence Steigrad Fine Arts.

The Chinese successfully seized the position and defended it against UN counterattacks. The battle is noted as the defending UN force had been largely composed of Spanish-speaking Puerto Ricans. Background In September 1952 the US 3rd Infantry Division defended a sector of the Jamestown Line the UN main line of resistance in Korea, occupying a series of outposts manned by forces varying from a squad to a company in strength on the low-lying hills in front of the line. One of these was Outpost Kelly, situated south of Kyeho-dong and about west of the double horseshoe bend of the Imjin River. On 17 September C Company, under the operational control of the 2d Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment, defended Kelly. Facing the 65th Regiment in the area around Kelly were the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) 2nd and 3rd Battalions, 348th Regiment, 116th Division, 39th Army. There had been an increase in the number and aggressiveness of PVA patrols in the entire 65th Regiment sector during September and also an increase in the frequency of PVA mortar fire. These signs usually heralded an impending attack. Battle On the night of 17 September an estimated company from the PVA 2nd Battalion, 348th Regiment, probed Outpost Kelly's defenses. When C Company requested reinforcements to fight off this probe, Col. Juan César Cordero Dávila, commanding officer of the 65th Regiment, ordered B Company to relieve its sister company on Kelly. B Company took over Kelly and passed to the operational control of the 2nd Battalion commander, Lt. Col. Carlos Betances Ramirez, early in the morning of 18 September. The PVA mortar fire on Kelly continued throughout the day and 1st Lt. William F. Nelson, B Company commander, in the early evening requested that the artillery supporting his position be prepared to fire variable time fuze shells in the event of a PVA attack. Less than an hour after his request an estimated two companies from the 2nd Battalion, 348th Regiment, attacked the outpost from the southwest, northwest and northeast. The northeast attack evidently surprised Lieutenant Nelson and his men, for the PVA swept across the hill and took the B Company machine gun position on the northwest corner of the hill from the rear. Killing the gunner, the PVA advanced along the trenches and closed in hand-to-hand combat. The sergeant in charge of the machine gun position managed to escape after he sustained arm injuries in the fight. Communications between Kelly and battalion headquarters were cut off and the situation was very confused by midnight, but reports of PVA herding American prisoners down the slopes of Kelly indicated that the position had been lost. There were also reports that some of the PVA were wearing US uniforms, but it was not clear whether they had donned these clothes before or after the attack. To find out whether the PVA intended to occupy the outpost, the regimental intelligence officer ordered the 2nd Battalion to send a platoon as quickly as possible from E Company to reconnoiter the hill. The patrol cleared the Jamestown Line shortly before daylight on the 19th, but soon ran into machine gun and rifle grenade fire as it advanced up the hill. Convinced that the PVA planned to remain, Colonel Cordero made an assessment of the situation. The heavy mortar fire and the attack that had followed had badly depleted B Company, although there might be some remnants of the company still on the hill. He assumed that the PVA now held the position with small arms, light machine guns and light mortars. There was a waist-deep, circular trench that ringed the military crest of the hill completely and four bunkers. At the base of the hill, on the approaches, the PVA had established combat outposts of squad size. Colonel Betances, the 2nd Battalion commander, ordered two platoons from E Company to advance on Kelly on the morning of 20 September. By late afternoon one platoon had fought its way to the top. The second was still on the porters' trail moving forward slowly. The PVA, however, had no intention of surrendering possession of Kelly for they quickly sent reinforcements to bolster their defending forces. The platoon on the hill began to take casualties from the small arms, machine gun and mortar fire, and the second platoon was forced to fall back as it encountered similar PVA opposition on its way to the crest. Faced with the PVA determination to hang on to the outpost and the mounting casualty list, the two platoons withdrew to the Jamestown Line. In the meantime, the 1st Battalion prepared to counterattack through the 2nd Battalion's positions. During the evening of 20 September, A Company, under 1st Lt. St. Clair Streett, Jr., moved forward to take up the attack from the south and C Company advanced to the base of the hill on which Kelly was located. The PVA mortar and artillery became very heavy as the men crossed the valley floor en route to the hill approaches. As the two companies began their ascent, B Company moved forward toward the outpost line to support the attack. Mortar fire came in swiftly and with deadly effect as casualties cut the strength of B Company to twenty-six men and forced the cancellation of the company mission. The PVA fire was also taking its toll of A and C Companies. In addition, the PVA used time-fuzed artillery fire as the 1st Battalion troops edged their way to the top. The airbursts over the heads of A and C Company were demoralizing and caused panic. Lieutenant Streett had to fall back and reorganize A Company, while C Company clung to a finger of the hill with two platoons. A and C Companies totaled about 60 men each at this juncture, while the PVA had an estimated 100 men on the hill and was reinforcing freely. A UN artillery barrage pounded the PVA positions on Kelly early in the morning of 21 September. But when the remnants of A and C Companies tried to close in on the PVA positions, they were met with small arms fire and hand grenades. Two squads from C Company almost reached the crest of Kelly shortly before noon only to receive mortar concentrations that forced them to fall back to the trenches. No sooner had the PVA mortar fire ceased when the Chinese counterattacked and forced C Company to pull out completely. In the early afternoon A, B and C Companies were ordered to return to their company areas. They had suffered over seventy casualties in the fight for Kelly. That night the 1st Battalion relieved the 3rd Battalion and the action around Kelly slowed down for several days. As the 3rd Battalion took over responsibility for the 1st Battalion positions, Lt. Col. Lloyd E. Wills, who had assumed command of the 3rd Battalion on 20 September, and his staff, drew up an attack plan to recapture Kelly. Since the previous efforts by forces ranging from one to four platoons had failed to dislodge the PVA, Colonel Wills received approval to use his three rifle companies. K Company would attack from the east and L Company would come in from the west, while I Company would be the reserve. At 05:20 on 24 September the 105mm howitzers of the 58th Field Artillery Battalion opened up on the PVA positions on and around Kelly for thirty minutes. Meanwhile, a platoon of tanks from the 64th Tank Battalion moved into position to support the 3rd Battalion attack. Artillery and tanks sent 25,000 rounds against the PVA in support of the attack. K and L Companies were in their attack positions by 05:40 and launched their assault half an hour later. As K Company troops approached Kelly, the PVA opened up with intense small arms, machine gun, artillery and mortar fire and soon had K Company pinned down. The heavy PVA concentration of firepower and the growing list of casualties led to panic and confusion in the company. With control of the company disintegrating and the casualties mounting, the K Company commander asked for permission to pull back and reorganize. Colonel Cordero at 07:00 ordered that this request be denied and that the company continue its attack. Shortly thereafter contact with K Company was lost. The artillery forward observer managed to hold together ten men from the company, however, and Colonel Wills, the battalion commander, instructed him to continue the attack on Kelly with his small force. On the western slopes of Kelly, L Company assaulted the PVA positions at 06:35. Despite heavy mortar fire, one squad reached the top at 07:20 and quickly asked for tank fire. Clinging to the trenches on the south slope of Kelly, the L Company squad was unable to move forward against stubborn PVA resistance. PVA artillery and mortar fire continued to be very heavy. Since contact with K Company had not been regained by 08:00 hours, Colonel Cordero ordered I Company to move to the rear of Hill 105, east of Kelly, and to prepare to take over K Company's zone. I Company moved toward Hill 105, but the PVA artillery zeroed in on the company and scored several direct hits. The men began to scatter and drift back to the Jamestown Line. Colonel Wills sent his S-3, to help reorganize the company, since contact with I Company's commander had been lost after the PVA artillery concentrations had begun. Colonel Wills left at 09:00 to take over the reorganization of both I and K Company stragglers as they returned to the Jamestown Line without weapons or equipment. With only the remnants of L Company still on Kelly, and the other two companies depleted and demoralized, the situation appeared grim. The two squads from L Company hung on to one of the trenches on the south slope and at 09:20 Colonel Cordero ordered them to stay there at all costs. When Colonel Wills finally regained contact with I Company at 10:00, it had reorganized and had two platoons intact; the remainder of the company's whereabouts was unknown. Colonel Wills telephoned the assistant division commander, Brig. Gen. Charles L. Dasher, Jr., and informed him that the battalion had approximately two platoons available for combat. General Dasher told Wills to cease to attack and to continue the reorganization of the battalion, which had suffered 141 casualties in the action. By early afternoon the squads from L Company had been withdrawn and the stragglers reassembled. But the division commander, Maj. Gen. Robert L. Dulaney, decided that the battalion and the regiment should not resume the battle for Kelly. The 3rd Battalion went into reserve positions on the night of 24 September and the 65th Regiment confined itself to routine patrolling until the Republic of Korea Army 1st Infantry Division relieved the 3rd Division on 30 September. Aftermath During the action between 17 and 24 September for Kelly and the surrounding outposts, the 65th Regiment suffered casualties of approximately 350 men, or almost 10 percent of its actual strength. Yet the casualties alone do not serve to explain the weaknesses that arose when the regiment went on the offense. Colonel Cordero in his command report for the month attributed the poor performance of his combat units to the rotation program. During the nine-month period from January—September 1952, Colonel Cordero stated, the regiment had rotated almost 8,700 men, including close to 1,500 noncommissioned officers. Only 435 non-commissioned officers had been received to replace the losses, and company commanders had been forced to assign inexperienced privates first class and privates to key positions in many rifle platoons. Out of an authorized strength of 811 noncommissioned officers in the upper three grades, the 65th Regiment had only 381 and many of the latter had been developed from recent replacements. The lack of experienced platoon sergeants and corporals had affected the combat efficiency of the regiment, Colonel Cordero went on, despite the high esprit de corps shown by the many Puerto Rican members of the regiment. In many cases, as soon as the company and platoon leaders became casualties, the inexperience and lack of depth at the combat company level became readily apparent. There was a failure to sustain the momentum of the attack and a tendency to become confused and disorganized after the leaders became casualties. Colonel Cordero recommended that his regiment be provided with a monthly quota of 400 replacements including a fair proportion of the upper three grades so that he could remedy this basic weakness. Although Colonel Cordero did not mention the language barrier, it should not be overlooked that the great majority of enlisted men in the regiment spoke only Spanish, creating communication problems between the English-speaking officers and the enlisted men from Puerto Rico.

Artificial intelligence, in modern terms, generally refers to computer systems that mimic human cognitive functions. It encompasses independent learning and problem-solving. While this type of general artificial intelligence has not been achieved yet, most contemporary artificial intelligence projects are currently better understood as types of machine-learning algorithms, that can be integrated with existing data to understand, categorize, and adapt sets of data without the need for explicit programming. AI-driven systems can discover patterns and trends, discover inefficiencies, and predict future outcomes based on historical trends, which ultimately enables informed decision-making. As such, they are potentially beneficial for many industries, notably heavy industry. While the application of artificial intelligence in heavy industry is still in its early stages, applications are likely to include optimization of asset management and operational performance, as well as identifying efficiencies and decreasing downtime. Potential benefits AI-driven machines ensure an easier manufacturing process, along with many other benefits, at each new stage of advancement. Technology creates new potential for task automation while increasing the intelligence of human and machine interaction. Some benefits of AI include directed automation, 24/7 production, safer operational environments, and reduced operating costs. = Directed automation = AI and robots can execute actions repeatedly without any error, and design more competent production models by building automation solutions. They are also capable of eliminating human errors and delivering superior levels of quality assurance on their own. = 24/7 production = While humans must work in shifts to accommodate sleep and mealtimes, robots can keep a production line running continuously. Businesses can expand their production capabilities and meet higher demands for products from global customers due to boosted production from this round-the-clock work performance. = Safer operational environment = More AI means fewer human laborers performing dangerous and strenuous work. Logically speaking, with fewer humans and more robots performing activities associated with risk, the number of workplace accidents should dramatically decrease. It also offers a great opportunity for exploration because companies do not have to risk human life. = Condensed operating costs = With AI taking over day-to-day activities, a business will have considerably lower operating costs. Rather than employing humans to work in shifts, they could simply invest in AI. The only cost incurred would be from maintenance after the machinery is purchased and commissioned. = Environmental impacts = Self-driving cars are potentially beneficial to the environment. They can be programmed to navigate the most efficient route and reduce idle time, which could result in less fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The same could be said for heavy machinery used in heavy industry. AI can accurately follow a sequence of procedures repeatedly, whereas humans are prone to occasional errors. = Additional benefits of AI = AI and industrial automation have advanced considerably over the years. There has been an evolution of many new techniques and innovations, such as advances in sensors and the increase of computing capabilities. AI helps machines gather and extract data, identify patterns, adapt to new trends through machine intelligence, learning, and speech recognition. It also helps to make quick data-driven decisions, advance process effectiveness, minimize operational costs, facilitate product development, and enable extensive scalability.  Potential negatives  = High cost = Though the cost has been decreasing in the past few years, individual development expenditures can still be as high as $300,000 for basic AI. Small businesses with a low capital investment may have difficulty generating the funds necessary to leverage AI. For larger companies, the price of AI may be higher, depending on how much AI is involved in the process. Because of higher costs, the feasibility of leveraging AI becomes a challenge for many companies. Nevertheless, the cost of utilizing AI can be cheaper for companies with the advent of open-source artificial intelligence software. = Reduced employment opportunities = Job opportunities will grow with the advent of AI; however, some jobs might be lost because AI would replace them. Any job that involves repetitive tasks is at risk of being replaced. In 2017, Gartner predicted 500,000 jobs would be created because of AI, but also predicted that up to 900,000 jobs could be lost because of it. These figures stand true for jobs only within the United States. = AI decision-making = AI is only as intelligent as the individuals responsible for its initial programming. In 2014, an active shooter situation led to people calling Uber to escape the shooting and surrounding area. Instead of recognizing this as a dangerous situation, the algorithm Uber used saw a rise in demand and increased its prices. This type of situation can be dangerous in the heavy industry, where one mistake can cost lives or cause injury. = Environmental impacts = Only 20 percent of electronic waste was recycled in 2016, despite 67 nations having enacted e-waste legislation. Electronic waste is expected to reach 52.2 million tons in the year 2021. The manufacture of digital devices and other electronics goes hand-in-hand with AI development which is poised to damage the environment. In September 2015, the German car company Volkswagen witnessed an international scandal. The software in the cars falsely activated emission controls of nitrogen oxide gases (NOx gases) when they were undergoing a sample test. Once the cars were on the road, the emission controls deactivated and the NOx emissions increased up to 40 times. NOx gases are harmful because they cause significant health problems, including respiratory problems and asthma. Further studies have shown that additional emissions could cause over 1,200 premature deaths in Europe and result in $2.4 million worth of lost productivity. AI trained to act on environmental variables might have erroneous algorithms, which can lead to potentially negative effects on the environment. Algorithms trained on biased data will produce biased results. The COMPAS judicial decision support system is one such example of biased data producing unfair outcomes. When machines develop learning and decision-making ability that is not coded by a programmer, the mistakes can be hard to trace and see. As such, the management and scrutiny of AI-based processes are essential. Effects of AI in the manufacturing industry Landing.ai, a startup formed by Andrew Ng, developed machine-vision tools that detect microscopic defects in products at resolutions well beyond the human vision. The machine-vision tools use a machine-learning algorithm tested on small volumes of sample images. The computer not only 'sees' the errors but processes the information and learns from what it observes. In 2014, China, Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea and Germany together contributed to 70 percent of the total sales volume of robots. In the automotive industry, a sector with a particularly high degree of automation, Japan had the highest density of industrial robots in the world at 1,414 per 10,000 employees. Generative design is a new process born from artificial intelligence. Designers or engineers specify design goals (as well as material parameters, manufacturing methods, and cost constraints) into the generative design software. The software explores all potential permutations for a feasible solution and generates design alternatives. The software also uses machine learning to test and learn from each iteration to test which iterations work and which iterations fail. It is said to effectively rent 50,000 computers [in the cloud] for an hour. Artificial intelligence has gradually become widely adopted in the modern world. AI personal assistants, like Siri or Alexa, have been around for military purposes since 2003.

He was born on November 7, 1976 in Inglewood, California. He currently resides in St. Louis, and his research focus includes a combination of molecular, biochemical, genetic, genomic, and proteomic tools to discover the molecular connections between signaling networks, circadian oscillators, and specific outputs. By combining these methods, he hopes to apply the knowledge elucidated from the Arabidopsis model to other plant species.  Education and career  Nusinow received his bachelor's degree in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1998. During his undergraduate years, Nusinow worked in Jay Gralla's lab and studied in vitro analysis of RNA Pol II transcription in the fission yeast, S.pombe. He continued his education to earn his PhD in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at University of California San Francisco (UCSF) from 1999 to 2006. During his first four years of graduate school, Nusinow attempted to create a quadruple knock-in (KI) mouse that would purify the protein RNA complex of X-inactive specific transcript (Xist), which plays a key role in dosage compensation in female mammals. The method was unsuccessful, so Nusinow shifted his focus on the mammalian histone variant macroH2A. He discovered that the inhibition of PARP1 by macro-H2A1 contributed to X chromosome inactivation. While in graduate school, he attended a seminar by Roger Hangarter who showed circadian regulated movements in sunflowers. This seminar inspired Nusinow to switch and study circadian rhythms in plants. In 2007, he became a researcher at the Scripps Institute with Steve Kay, and continued with the lab when it moved to University of California San Diego (UCSD) for five additional years. While in Kay's lab, he was influenced by fellow researcher Takato Imaizumi to study ELF3 in plants. Nusinow then became a principal investigator at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center and an adjunct professor at Washington University in St. Louis in 2012. He now studies to understand how the circadian clock is integrated with environmental signals to control growth, development, and physiology in order to improve the productivity in plants.  Scientific contributions to circadian rhythms in Arabidopsis  = Photosensitivity of FKF1/GI complex = In 2007, Sawa, Nusinow, Kay, and Imaizumi identified how Arabidopsis proteins FKF1 (Flavin- binding, Kelch repeat, F-box 1) and GI (Gigantea) helped regulate flowering photoperiods in Arabidopsis. Their interest in these proteins arose when they saw FKF1 and GI had displayed similar peak times of expression during the long days. Subsequently, they isolated Arabidopsis proteins FKF1 and GI in a test tube and showed that blue light induced in vitro formation of FKF1 and GI complex. The blue light was absorbed by the LOV (Light, Oxygen, or Voltage) domain on the FKF1 protein, and the N terminus of the GI protein was sufficient to interact with FKF1. To test whether the proteins interacted in vivo, they did a series of transgenic experiments on Arabidopsis. A two-hybrid screening method with HA (haemagglutinin)-tagged FKF1 and tandem affinity purification (TAP)-tagged GI system was used to show that GI and FKF1 formed a complex in vivo. Additionally, they saw that this complex positively regulated daytime transcription of constans (CO), a gene promoting flowering in plants. Their results led to a model of how FKF1 and GI complex regulated flowering in response to photoperiods in Arabidopsis. = Hypocotyl growth linked to ELF4/ELF4/LUX complex = Nusinow continued working with Arabidopsis and in 2011 as part of a team, he published a paper in the journal Nature where he identified proteins Early Flowering 4 (ELF4), Early Flowering 3 (ELF3), and gene lux arrhythmo (LUX) form a multi-protein clock complex that directly regulated growth in Arabidopsis. Proteins ELF3 and ELF4 contain basic helix- loop-helix (bHLH) structural motif that binds the proteins to DNA. Nusinow named the ELF4, ELF3, and LUX complex “evening complex (EC)” after identifying the complex peaked at dusk. Through a series of transgenic experiments, he showed that ELF4, ELF3, and LUX were required for proper expression of Phytochrome interacting Factor 4 (PIF4) and phytochrome interacting factor 5 (PIF5), two transcription factors critical for regulating hypocotyl growth Arabidopsis seedlings. = Discovery of PCH1 = In 2015 through 2016, Nusinow and his colleagues identified a protein that was repeatedly associated with the evening complex in AP-MS analysis of the plant circadian clock. Nusinow found that the protein, which he named PCH1 (Photoperiodic Control of Hypocotyl), was an important regulator for the growth of the hypocotyl (the stem of a seedling) during germination. PCH1 reduces hypocotyl growth during long nights by preferentially binding and stabilizing the active form of phytochrome B (phyB), prolonging its activity. PhyB in turn forms photobodies in the nucleus, where it interacts with molecules of the evening complex (EC) to cause downstream inhibition of hypocotyl growth. The discovery and characterization of PCH1 is especially notable because phyB is normally active only during the day. By stabilizing phyB and maintaining its signaling well into the night, PCH1 allows plant cells to “remember” past illumination and adjust growth programs accordingly.

It's part of the Cascade Range and is situated on land managed by Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into tributaries of the Snoqualmie and Skykomish Rivers. The nearest higher peak is Overcoat Peak, to the east-southeast. Climate Big Snow Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The Alpine Lakes Wilderness features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite walls spotted with over 700 mountain lakes. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. Big Snow Mountain summit panorama showing Summit Chief Mountain, Chimney Rock, and Lemah The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured and shaped the landscape. The last glacial retreat in the Alpine Lakes area began about 14,000 years ago and was north of the Canada–US border by 10,000 years ago. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of that recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness area.

Between 2013 and 2015, further investments with a volume of 840 million euros are to be made. With the stop of production of automobiles at GAZ, VW CEO Martin Winterkorn signed an acquisition agreement on June 14, 2011 in order to win another company for Volkswagen and thus build an assembly hall in Nizhny Novgorod. With the expiration of the GAZ Volga Siber assembly should begin there and increase the units assembled in Russia to 360,000 vehicles. This plan was discussed and approved in the presence of Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. In 2012, 316,000 vehicles were assembled.

The Chinese successfully seized the position and defended it against UN counterattacks. Background While the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) were preparing their assault on the Republic of Korea Army (ROK) at Baengma-goji (White Horse), they launched several diversionary attacks against ROK outposts on Hills 281 and 391 northeast of White Horse in an attempt to disperse the ROK 9th Infantry Division forces. Sporadic and indecisive fighting continued from 6 to 12 October when the PVA made a serious effort to storm the Hill 391. After the ROK units pulled back, on 13 October a reinforced company from the US 7th Infantry Division attempted in vain to regain the lost positions. Once the PVA were repulsed at While Horse, the ROK 9th Division sent a battalion from its 28th Regiment to clear Hill 391 on 16 October. The battalion won through to the crest and was able to maintain control until 20 October when PVA counterattacks regained possession of the hill for the next two days. On 23 October, after a bitter hand-to-hand encounter, elements of the ROK 51st Regiment drove the PVA off again, repulsed a counterattack, then withdrew. On the following night the US 65th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division relieved the ROK 51st Regiment on the line. Since their defeat in the Battle of Outpost Kelly the 65th Regiment had been undergoing a vigorous program of training under a new commander, Col. Chester B. De Gavre. Two weeks of intensive training, however, could not remedy the basic weakness of the regiment, the lack of experienced noncommissioned officers at the infantry platoon level, but the unit was again assigned to assume responsibility for a portion of the Jamestown Line the UN's main line of resistance. Battle On the night of 24-25 October, G Company, under Capt. George D. Jackson, took over the defense of the high ground immediately south of Hill 391. Jackson Heights, as it was soon to be called, had enough bunkers to house the command posts of the three rifle platoons, the company headquarters, and the forward artillery observer, but none of these was adequate for fighting off an attack. Jackson's plans for improving his defenses had little chance for early success, since the PVA artillery and mortar fire upon the heights was accurate and the PVA had excellent observation of the G Company movements from the surrounding hills. Facing the company were elements of the PVA 3rd Battalion, 87th Regiment, 29th Division, 15th Army. The 87th Regiment was commanded by Hwueh Yiang-hua. On the afternoon of the 25th the artillery supporting the 87th Regiment began to send direct 76mm gunfire against the Jackson Heights positions from Camel Back Hill, to the northwest. PVA 82mm and 120mm mortars followed and by dusk G Company had received 250 rounds of mortar and artillery fire and suffered 9 casualties. During the night the PVA sent out patrols that probed G Company's dispositions and continued to send harassing artillery and mortar fire onto Jackson Heights. Captain Jackson used his own 60mm mortars and supporting mortar and artillery fire to break up the PVA probes. Late in the afternoon of 26 October the PVA sent over 260 rounds of direct 76mm gunfire from Camel Back Hill and caused 14 more casualties. From the company listening posts that night came frequent reports of the PVA moving about and digging in. Two PVA soldiers approached within hand grenade range of one of the listening posts on the southwest flank. The men at the post were given permission to use grenades against the intruders. As the two PVA soldiers hastily withdrew, mortar fire was called in to speed their departure. A PVA platoon probed the northern approach to Jackson Heights shortly after midnight, then fell back under interdicting artillery and mortar fire. Another platoon advanced from the north an hour later and closed to hand grenade range. After a 15-minute fire fight, the PVA pulled back, taking an estimated 17 casualties with them. The next eight hours were relatively quiet. At 09:30 on 27 October the 76mm guns on Camel Back Hill opened up again. One round scored a direct hit on the mortar ammunition supply and blew up all but some 150 rounds. By nightfall the PVA firepower had reduced the mortar platoon to two mortars and seven men and the second platoon had lost both its platoon leader and sergeant. Captain Jackson reported to 2nd Battalion that he needed aid for his wounded and wanted smoke laid about the heights to obstruct the PVA's ability to pinpoint the company's movements. He was told to be calm, that smoke and aid were on the way. An hour after Jackson called, the PVA loosed a heavy concentration of artillery and mortar fire on G Company's positions and then sent an estimated company in from the north. Using the remaining mortars, automatic weapons, small arms and hand grenades, Captain Jackson and his men beat off this attack. The second PVA assault of the evening came after the Chinese artillery and mortar crews had fired an estimated 1,000 rounds at Jackson Heights within half an hour. One estimated PVA company struck from the north and a second from the south. Jackson called for final defensive fire on the area until the situation clarified. His ammunition dump had been hit again and the PVA attack had fanned out and become general on all sides. At this point the company communications sergeant evidently reported that there were only three men left in the platoon in his area and asked battalion for permission to withdraw. Whether the sergeant acted on his own or not was unclear, but Colonel Carlos Betances Ramirez, the battalion commander, assumed that the request was from the company commander and ordered G Company to withdraw. When Captain Jackson learned of the withdrawal order, he attempted to verify it, but the communications lines were out and radio contact proved unsatisfactory. At any rate, Captain Jackson passed the order to withdraw back to his platoon leaders. The first and second platoons went down the east side of the heights and Captain Jackson went with the third platoon down the western slope. His platoon ran into heavy PVA small arms fire on the way and he was separated from his men during the action, finally rejoining them on the trail back to the Jamestown Line. When Colonel De Gavre learned of G Company's withdrawal, he quickly ordered that A Company, commanded by 1st Lt. John D. Porterfield, be placed under the operational control of Colonel Betances for a counterattack to regain Jackson Heights. A Company was to be used for the attack phase only and F Company, commanded by Capt. Willis D. Cronkhite, Jr., would take part in the attack and then would man the outpost. C Company would prepare to pass to the operational control of the 2nd Battalion, if it were necessary to back up the attack. As daylight broke on the 28th, Captain Cronkhite led F Company toward Jackson Heights. The PVA platoon defending the hill resisted with small arms, automatic weapons and hand grenades, but F Company won control of the crest by 10:00. In the meantime, progress by Lieutenant Porterfield's A Company had been slowed down by artillery and mortar fire. Despite the PVA fire, two platoons pushed on and joined F Company on the heights; the remaining platoon was pinned down by mortar fire at the base of the hill. The operation seemed to be well in hand, until the PVA artillery put all of A Company's officers on the hill out of action. One platoon leader was killed by a direct hit and then a shell landed in the middle of the company command post killing Lieutenant Porterfield and the forward observer and wounding the one remaining platoon leader. The loss of leadership became immediately apparent, for enlisted men in both A and F Companies began to \\"bug out.\\" Slipping away from the heights alone or in groups, the men drifted back toward the Jamestown Line. By late afternoon only Captain Cronkhite and his company officers remained on the hill; all of his men had left along with those of A Company. Efforts by the 2nd Battalion to round up the stragglers and send them back to Jackson Heights met with no success. The men by this time evidently regarded the hill as a suicide post and refused to return. When night fell, Colonel Betances ordered Captain Cronkhite and his fellow officers to withdraw from the hill. On the following day the 65th Regiment made one more effort to take Jackson Heights. Colonel De Gavre put Major Davies, the 1st Battalion commander, in charge of the operation. Davies sent C Company to Jackson Heights in the morning of 29 October. The company moved up and took possession of the hill without encountering any enemy resistance. Again all seemed well. The PVA artillery was quiet and no counterattack developed. Suddenly fear set in and the enlisted men left en masse. The command group soon found themselves alone with a handful of men. Once more the stragglers were gathered together and ordered back up the hill and over 50 refused. Major Davies finally recalled the command group to the Jamestown Line. This proved to be the last attempt of the 65th Regiment to take Jackson Heights. Maj. Gen. George W. Smythe, the division commander, ordered the US 15th Infantry Regiment to take over responsibility for the 65th's sector beginning that same night. Aftermath In November the 65th Regiment returned to an intensive training program. General Smythe requested that a combat-trained regiment be either assigned permanently or for at least four months while the 65th Regiment underwent its retraining. If neither of these alternatives were possible, Smythe went on, he favored the reconstitution of the Regiment with 60 percent mainland US personnel and the assignment of the excess Puerto Ricans to other infantry units. Following the battle ninety-five soldiers from the 65th Regiment were tried for desertion by General Court-Martial in fifteen separate trials. Ninety-one were found guilty and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. The convicted soldiers were later granted clemency and pardons following the intervention of the Puerto Rican Government. Outposts set up on Jackson Heights were subjected to frequent probes by the PVA throughout the first half of November. By the middle of the month only a couple of outposts at the base of Jackson Heights remained in the possession of the 3rd Infantry Division. Although the PVA exerted considerable pressure upon the outposts during the remainder of November and overran them several times, elements of the 15th Regiment managed to maintain their precarious positions at the end of November.

It lies next to the village on a steep basalt cone at a height of . The rock was first mentioned in 780/781 as the Haselahastein.  History  The hilltop castle, probably built in the 11th century (or even earlier) by the lords of Haselstein, was first mentioned in 1119, when it was conquered by the Abbot of Fulda, Erlof of Bergholz, in order to put an end to the robber baronetcy that had been based there. The first known lord of the castle was Wigger of Hasela, recorded in 1135. From 1156, after being taken again, the castle was ended up in the possession of Fulda Abbey and became the seat of their officials, including the lords of Haselstein (until their extinction in 1330) and the lords von der Tann, who administered the office of Haselstein from there. The later Electoral Saxon court counsellor and envoy, Eberhard von der Tann, who introduced the Reformation there in 1534 as regent of the Lordship of Tann, was born in 1495 at Haselstein Castle. The castle was last mentioned in 1512, when Dietrich of Ebersberg was an officer there. At the foot of the castle hill a new district house was built in 1546, and the castle, which was no longer used, fell into disrepair or served as a quarry. Of the former castle complex, only small remains of the surrounding wall and two sides of the former gate tower remain. The round bergfried, which has now completely disappeared, once had a diameter of about six metres.

It stars Daniella Pineda as a woman who is released from a psychiatric hospital 15 years after stabbing a classmate because of an urban legend about a ghost known as Mercy Black. After her nephew Bryce (Miles Emmons) becomes obsessed with the same ghost, she comes to believe the ghost may be real. Austin Amelio and Janeane Garofalo appear in supporting roles. The film was released to Netflix on March 31, 2019, with no prior announcement.  Plot  As a teenager, Marina and Rebecca stabbed a classmate because Marina believed a ghost called Mercy Black would cure her mother's illness. Fifteen years later, Marina is released from a psychiatric hospital to her sister, Alice. To Marina's dismay, urban legends about Mercy Black have spread on the internet. Alice's son, Bryce, soon becomes obsessed with Mercy Black. While facing her past to help Bryce avoid the same fate, Marina questions whether Mercy Black is merely a delusion of her own creation. When she goes to visit Rebecca to talk about what happened when they were children, she discovers that Rebecca attempted to hang herself and is now in a catatonic state. When looking around Rebecca's room, Marina discovers an old map and Rebecca attacks her. Bryce is brought home by the librarian after tearing up library books. When he is involved in an incident with his \\"friend,\\" he says \\"she told me to do it\\". Meanwhile, Marina follows the map through the woods, discovering old clues along the way that lead to a nuclear fallout shelter. Inside, she finds \\"the book you cannot read\\" and remembers that they created Mercy Black. While Marina now believes that Mercy never existed, Bryce falls deeper into the delusion. While alone in the house, Bryce and Alice have an encounter with Mercy Black, leading to Alice falling over the stair rail. After Marina arrives, Mercy Black attacks her. When Bryce flees out the door, he runs straight into the arms of the librarian, who turns out to be Lily, the girl Marina and Rebecca attacked to sacrifice. Lily is angry that she lived and Marina didn't finish her off as she promised. She admits to hurting people to make Marina remember but Marina tells her that they made Mercy up. Lily stabs Marina and threatens to slit Bryce's throat. Marina tackles and begins choking her but releases her. Bryce then stabs her in the eye and says \\"I made a promise\\" as Mercy Black appears behind him.

One of the inspirations for the story was Mary Bell, who had murdered two toddlers when she was a child. Bell had been granted a new identity after being released from jail, but tabloid reporters discovered her new identity. Producers wanted the protagonist to be innocent, but Egerton told them that the story depended on facing one's past.  Release  Mercy Black was released on Netflix with no advance notice on March 31, 2019.  Reception  Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 40% of ten surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 4.6/10. Based on four reviews, Metacritic rated it 48/100, which it labels \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Noel Murray of the Los Angeles Times compared it favorably to Slender Man, calling it \\"nerve-wracking throughout\\". Matthew Monagle of The Austin Chronicle rated it 2/5 stars and criticized the film for exploiting mental illness as a plot device instead of making intelligent observations. William Bibbiani of IGN rated it 5.5/10 and wrote that the film fails to live up to its disturbing premise because of the poor writing and direction.

Possibly reaching up to , it might have surpassed the modern polar bear in size. Description The fossils of Simbakubwa were first discovered by rural Kenyans at Meswa Bridge, Western Kenya thereafter Matthew Borths and Nancy Stevens published the findings after examining the fossils which had been stored at the Nairobi National Museum in Kenya for decades. The type specimen consists of a mandible from the lower jaw, a right upper maxilla and some postcranial remains. The light wear patterns on the dentition indicate that the holotype specimen was a young adult at the time of its death. The study of the postcranial remains indicates Simbakubwa was possessed of a semi-digitigrade walking stance. Paleoecology Simbakubwa, like other hyainailourids, probably was a specialist hunter and scavenger that preyed on creatures such as rhinoceroses and early proboscideans. It may have been somewhat less specialized in crushing bone than its later relatives such as Hyainailouros.

It is part of the North Cascades, which is a subset of the Cascade Range. Meltwater from the Spider Glacier on the steep north face, and other surface runoff from the mountain drains into Flat Creek, which is a tributary of the Stehekin River. The nearest higher neighbor is Mount Formidable to the west. The Middle Cascade Glacier lies between these two mountains, and the Ptarmigan Traverse passes through also. Climate Spider Mountain is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. In terms of favorable weather, July through September are best for climbing. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks and ridges, deep glacial valleys, and granite spires. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to various climate differences. Spider Mountain in upper left The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Oil is produced from the Tui, Amokura and Pateke wellheads on the seabed in approximately 120m of water. These wells are connected to the Umuroa, a floating production storage and offloading vessel. The reservoir was discovered in 2003 by a joint venture between Australian Worldwide Exploration and New Zealand Overseas Petroleum. The nearby Amokura and Pateke oil reserves were discovered in 2004. In 2016, Tamarind purchased AWE's 57.5% interests in the field. In early 2019, permits were granted for drilling of side track wells to extend the production life of the field. The drilling program was suspended in September 2019 after the first well was dry. Following the suspension of the drilling program, Tamarind warned staff on the Umuroa that its contract would not be renewed after December 31. On 11 November 2019 field operator Tamarind Taranaki announced that it \\"may be insolvent\\" and put the company into administration. On 27 November Tamarind was served with an abatement notice by the Environmental Protection Authority following a small oil spill at the Tui site. In 2020 the High Court ordered the Umuroa FPSO to stay connected to the oilfield and was cited by Greenpeace as a reason to urgently update the regulatory regime for oil and gas.

The series began on April 10, 2019, and ended on April 16. The 2018–19 NHL season saw the Tampa Bay Lightning tie the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings for the most regular season wins in NHL history. The Columbus Blue Jackets came into the series as the eighth seed, finishing with 98 points and qualifying for the playoffs in their second last game. Tampa Bay won the Presidents' Trophy with 128 points and had beaten Columbus in all three regular season meetings by a combined score of 17 to 3. The Lightning were seen by analysts as the overwhelming favorites to win the series. However, the series ended in a shocking elimination for the Lightning; the Blue Jackets won Game 1 4–3 despite trailing 3–0 at the end of the first period. The Blue Jackets subsequently won Game 2 5–1 and, in Columbus, Ohio, proceeded to win Game 3 3–1 and Game 4 7–3. The series concluded with Columbus sweeping the Lightning in four games, with a goal difference of 11. The series marked several NHL records. Tampa's elimination was the first time a Presidents' Trophy's winner was swept by an eighth seed. It also marked the first time that a Presidents' Trophy winner was eliminated in the first round since 2012, and the fifth time in NHL history that a team with the best regular season record got swept in the First Round (and the first time since the Expansion Era). The Blue Jackets' victory marked their first ever playoff series win in franchise history. Many commentators consider this series to be one of the greatest upsets in NHL history, considering that the Blue Jackets trailed the Lightning by 30 points exactly during the regular season. Jeremy Roenick of NBC Sports described Tampa's elimination as \\"one of the biggest letdowns in history\\", while Tampa Bay Times described it as \\"the disappointment that all others are measured against\\". The two teams would once again play each other the next year in the first round of the 2020 Stanley Cup playoffs, where the Lightning would avenge the previous year's loss winning that series 4-1 and would eventually go on to win the Stanley Cup. Background =Columbus Blue Jackets= Sergei Bobrovsky with the Columbus Blue Jackets during the 2013–14 season. The Blue Jackets entered the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs as a wild card qualifier, qualifying in back-to-back years for the first time in franchise history. They faced the Washington Capitals in the first round, winning the first two games in overtime and their first series lead. However, they lost the next four games and the series in six games. Two-time Vezina Trophy winner Sergei Bobrovsky and the team's leading scorer, Artemi Panarin were in the final year of their contracts before becoming unrestricted free agents. Blue Jackets GM Jarmo Kekalainen was an active participant near the trade deadline window of the 2018–19 season, acquiring several players with expiring contracts. On February 22, the Blue Jackets acquired Matt Duchene in a trade with the Ottawa Senators. A day later, the Blue Jackets traded again with the Senators, this time acquiring Ryan Dzingel in exchange for Anthony Duclair. On February 25, the Blue Jackets acquired Keith Kinkaid from the New Jersey Devils in exchange for a fifth round pick in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, and later acquired Adam McQuaid from the New York Rangers in exchange for Julius Bergman and fourth and seventh round picks in the 2019 NHL Entry Draft. Despite these acquisitions, the Blue Jackets initially struggled into March as they faced fierce competition from the Montreal Canadiens and the Carolina Hurricanes for the last two Wild Card spots. They won seven of their last eight games and on April 5, 2019, the Blue Jackets clinched the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference with a 3–2 shootout win over the New York Rangers. =Tampa Bay Lightning= Kucherov with the Lightning in 2014. In the 2018 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Lightning eliminated the New Jersey Devils in the first round and the Boston Bruins in the second round, both in five games. However, they were defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals by the eventual Stanley Cup champions, the Washington Capitals, in seven games. Prior to the start of the 2018–19 season, it was announced that Steve Yzerman was resigning from his position as GM, and Julien BriseBois took his place. The Lightning clinched their first Presidents' Trophy and second consecutive division title and secured home-ice advantage throughout the playoffs. The Lightning finished the regular season with 62 wins, tied with the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings for most wins in a single season in NHL history. They recorded 128 points in the regular season, with a points percentage of .780, the second-highest rate for an 82-game season, behind only the 1995–96 Detroit Red Wings (.799). They were also the highest-scoring team on average (3.89) since the 1995–96 Red Wings and, of their 62 wins, 30 were by a margin of three or more goals, which was tied for the most since 1992–93. Pivotal to the Lightning's success was their offense led by Steven Stamkos, Brayden Point, and Nikita Kucherov. On March 9, 2019, Kucherov set the Lightning single season record for points in a season with his 109th point of year. Kucherov went on to record his 40th goal of the season on April 5, 2019 and his 126th point, setting the record for most points in an NHL season during the salary cap era, a record formerly held by Joe Thornton. Kucherov ended the season with 128 points (41 goals and 87 assists), surpassing Alexander Mogilny for most points in the NHL by a Russian-born player and winning the Art Ross Trophy. Stamkos and Point also exceeded 40 goals and 90 overall points each by the seasons end.

They loaded up at the (trade) deadline. They’ve got some great players. But Tampa set a bunch of records, so it’s pretty surprising.\\" Hyman's teammate Travis Dermott acknowledged a difference between the regular season and postseason, but continues to state: \\"It’s kind of crazy to think such a good team in the regular season can go out in four like that. You never really would have thunk it.\\" Bruins head coach Bruce Cassidy acknowledged that every team had a chance, but also admitted that he did not guess the Lightning to fail to win a single game in the series. =Media= The Tampa Bay Times' sports section greeted the Game 3 result with a headline reading \\"Torturella\\". When the Blue Jackets' sweep was confirmed, Tampa Bay Times' frontpage headlines read \\"Fizzled Sticks\\" and \\"Floored\\". The paper savaged the Lightning for their poor play, suggesting their defeat \\"was the final chapter in a whole new story of despair. In a way, it was as if an entire community was duped. For six months, the Lightning had you believing you were seeing something historic. And in the end, it was all choke and mirrors.\\" Meanwhile, Columbus paper The Columbus Dispatch heralded the results, with its frontpage headline reading \\"A Sweep to Savor\\". Game 4 of the series delivered a household rating of 9.83 for Fox Sports Ohio, the highest-ever ratings for a Blue Jackets telecast. On average, the series delivered an average of 6.48 HH in the Columbus metropolitan area. The New York Times described the series' result as a playoff meltdown for the Lightning, suggesting that the Lightning could be amongst the biggest playoff underachievers in sports history. USA Today described the Lightning's exit as one of the worst playoff flops in NHL history, while Deadspin stated \\"[the Lightning] failed to show up in their first-round series against the tremendously underestimated Columbus Blue Jackets, and they paid the price.\\" In an interview on NPR, Greg Wyshynski of ESPN stated the Lightning had to apologize to their fans. Wyshynski went on to state that the only other team in the history of the four major sports leagues in America that failed to win a playoff game after equivalent levels of regular season success was the 2011 Green Bay Packers. \\"But in [the Packers'] case, we're talking about one game. [The Lightning] is a team that had four chances to win a game, and they couldn't do it.\\" In Canada, Rory Boylen of Sportsnet described the series as the biggest upset in the salary cap era of the NHL. He postulated that the result may be a culmination of how the Lightning got eliminated in recent seasons, going as far back as their First Round loss in the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs against the Montreal Canadiens. In his words, \\"time will tell if these Lightning are like the San Jose Sharks – a squad that seemed to have everything in place for years and even got to one Stanley Cup Final, but could never win it all – or if they’ll eventually put it together for a successful run as Washington [Capitals] did last season.\\" =Financial= WFTS-TV reported that the city of Tampa could lose up to $50 million in potential revenue as a result of the sweep. Conversely, in Columbus, merchandise sales tripled as a result of the Blue Jackets' surprise series win.

In May 1945, she married the estate owner and resistance member Gunnar Flemming Juncker (1904–2002). Brought up in a cultural milieu in Copenhagen, she had two younger brothers, Henning, who became a theatre director, and Hermann, an art historian. As a child, she spent long periods with her seafaring family on the island of Fanø. After matriculating from N. Zahle's School in 1923, she studied languages and statistics. She completed her education in Paris where she studied the art and fashion industry. After a few years giving courses on her interests in Finland and Denmark, she spent a year undertaking statistical surveys for the Danish National Serum Institute. Thanks to her wide education and experience, she was then invited to become an official of the League of Nations in Geneva where she first worked for the health committee and then for the finance department where she managed the pension fund. In 1940, fearing that Germany would occupy Switzerland, Rohde fled through occupied France to England where she sought to assist the Danish seafaring community while continuing to support her League of Nations interests. A strong supporter of the need for a free Danish movement in Britain, when the Danish Council was founded in September 1940, she became a member of the meetings and finance committee, establishing fruitful contacts with influential British and Danish officials. These included the Council's director Ferdinand Michael Krøyer Kielberg and Børge Møller who was responsible for the Danish seafarers' organization (De Sammensluttede Danske Sømandsorganisationer) in Newcaste. Rohde was particularly active in Newcastle where she took part in organizing the activities of the Danish centre which provided a range of services to Danish seamen. In 1942, on behalf of the Danish Council, Rohde met the Danish ambassador Henrik Kauffmann in Washington. As a result, in 1943 she spent six months in Canada and the United States. In particular, she assisted Kauffmann with preparations for the UNRRA meeting in Atlantic City, reporting on the discussions in a lengthy article in the Danish Council's magazine Frit Danmark. While still in London, in 1944 she met Flemming Juncker who was attached to the Special Operations Executive, where he was responsible for Danish paratroopers. The couple married in May 1945 and had a daughter Asa Margrethe on 14 November. Less than half a year later, Gabriele Rohde fell through a hole on the first floor of Juncker's estate Overgård on Mariager Fjord in Jutland, breaking her neck on the stone floor below. Despite hospital treatment in Aarhus, she died on 5 April 1946 from pneumonia.

The series's main catchphrases are and . Synopsis 12 years prior, Tregear incapacitated the New Generation Heroes after misleading them to a minefield asteroid. Inheriting their powers, the Tri- Squad attempted to continue the battle but it leads to their particles scattered in outer space. Taiga's particle of light merged with a young boy named Hiroyuki to save him from a fall after his Guesra companion \\"Chibisuke\\" was kidnapped. In the present day, Hiroyuki joined a private security organization E.G.I.S. (Enterprise of Guard and Investigation Services) to handle extraterrestrial cases while living in a society mixed with aliens from various point of origin. While handling a Villain Guild-related case, a fully recuperated Taiga awakens and therefore allows Hiroyuki to transform in order to combat giant monsters as two other Tri-Squad members, Titas and Fuma made their way to Earth and bonded with the former as a shared host. Tregear on the other hand was revealed to have been anticipating the Tri-Squad's arrival and orchestrated several monster and alien attacks for his own twisted enjoyment of tormenting others. In the middle of the series, his true agenda was revealed to corrupt Taiga into an evil Ultraman in order to fulfill his twisted vendetta against the former's father, Taro. Hiroyuki and the Tri- Squad's sheer bond purified Taiga and gave them the ability to fuse into Ultraman Taiga Tri-Strium. Growing desperate for the situation, Tregear initially try to harass the E.G.I.S. members and eventually summoned the planet-devouring monster Woola to Earth for his final endgame to consume both light and darkness. As the tension between humans and aliens begin to grow, Pirika's attempt to sacrifice herself in order to eliminate Woola leads to the realization that it was only cursed by its own hunger. Former Villain Guild members Alien Magma and Merkind offer their assistance to neutralize Woola as Taiga fed the monster with his and Tregear's energy, ending the monster's life in a peaceful way. After rejecting his last chance at redemption, Tregear fought against Taiga Tri-Strium and seemingly obliterated by exposing himself to the Quattro Squad Blaster, seeing Taro's image in the young hero in his final moments. Episodes Ultra Galaxy Fight: New Generation Heroes is the first of the Ultra Galaxy Fight miniseries, airing from September 29 to December 22, 2019 while coinciding its release with the second half of Ultraman Taiga. The end of New Generation Heroes lead to the cold opening of Ultraman Taiga picking off where the titular team were chasing Tregear while the Tri-Squad continue the fight in their predecessors' place. In addition, the miniseries imported characters from different multimedia instalments of Ultra Series, the antagonist Ultra Dark-Killer from the pachinko game series and Ultraman Ribut from Tsuburaya Productions' previous collaboration Upin & Ipin animation series. Ultraman Taiga The Movie is the film adaptation of Ultraman Taiga announced on December 15, 2019 at Tokyo Dome City during Tsuburaya Productions' Tsubucon. In addition to the original cast members of the series, the movie incorporates guest appearance of the previous New Generation Heroes. The movie was initially delayed from its original release date (March 6, 2020) as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Japan before it received a new one in August 7. The film centers around Hiroyuki as the target of an unidentified opponent, forcing other members of the New Generation Heroes to appear one after another and together challenge the power of a great darkness. In addition, Taiga's father, Ultraman Taro, has come to Earth but attacked his own son under mysterious circumstances.

The twelve-issue limited series, written by Judd Winick and illustrated by Howard Porter and Mauro Cascioli, was later reprinted in three paperback collections. The story was an attempt to update Captain Marvel for a modern audience. It received mixed reviews from critics and the changes to the franchise were reverted shortly after it concluded. Development In the years leading up to the release of The Trials of Shazam, DC Comics promoted their Captain Marvel character in other comic titles to generate reader interest. The story of the limited series follows plot elements introduced in Infinite Crisis (2005), Day of Vengeance (2005), and the one-shot Brave New World (2006). Writer Judd Winick conceived the story to update the character, who was largely unchanged since his creation in the 1940s and was seen by many people as a low-quality copy of Superman; the updates included changing the character's focus from regular crimes to magical ones, removing some of the sillier elements and putting Captain Marvel Jr. in the leading role. The art was initially done by Howard Porter, who was using a digital painting approach for the first time in his professional work. This technique meant he did not have assistance from an inker or colorist, and he was having trouble meeting his deadlines for publication. The fifth issue was delayed from February 2007 to March, and issue seven was also a month late. These troubles were compounded when he suffered a severe thumb injury on his drawing hand which required an orthopedic cast and permanently limited his feeling. Porter was replaced by Mauro Cascioli with the tenth issue, cover dated January 2008, three months after issue nine. The final issues were released bi-monthly. The first issue sold an estimated 50,500 copies. By the final issue, sales had fallen by about half. DC reprinted the first six issues in a paperback collection in June 2007. The remaining issues were collected in a second volume released in July 2008. All twelve issues were reprinted in a single volume in 2019. If the series had been successful, there were plans for an ongoing monthly series. Instead, Winick's changes to the franchise were short- lived, being undone by a 2009 story line in JSA. Plot During Infinite Crisis, the wizard Shazam was destroyed by the Spectre, who had declared a war on magic.Day of Vengeance #6 (November 2005) When the Rock of Eternity was destroyed, Captain Marvel Jr. and Mary Marvel lost their powers.Brave New World #1 (August 2006) Captain Marvel assumes Shazam's role as caretaker of the Rock of Eternity using the name Marvel.Trials of Shazam! #2 (November 2006) Marvel drafts the now-powerless Freddy Freeman to undergo a quest to prove himself worthy of replacing Captain Marvel. Each of the six gods who contributed their powers — Solomon, Hercules, Atlas, Zeus, Achilles, and Mercury — present Freddy with a challenge. If he completes one successfully, he is granted that god's particular power. If he completes all six tasks, he will take on the name Shazam. Zareb Babak, a demoted necromancer, serves as Freddy's guide during his trials. At the same time, a dark organization known as the Council of Merlin is backing its own candidate, a Creole sorceress named Sabina. If she wins the trials, she will earn the power of Shazam instead. Freddy and Sabina compete equally in many of the trials, eventually becoming equal in power as each earn the various powers of the gods. When Sabina kills Atlas before his trial is completed, Zareb is forced to convince Apollo to take his place among the Shazam collective of gods. The competition culminates in a large battle. Freddy, Marvel, and the Justice League battling Sabina and an army of demons summoned by the sorcerer Merlin. When he is willing to sacrifice himself, Freddy proves himself worthy Zeus' power and Zareb reveals himself to be Zeus in disguise. Freddy says the magic word \\"Shazam\\" and gains the full powers of Shazam. Reception The comic book series received mixed reviews from critics, averaging 6.7 out of 10 according to review aggregator Comic Book Roundup. Both Comic Book Resources and Comics Bulletin criticized Winick's dialogue and narrative pace. Porter's artwork was criticized by Comic Book Resources for \\"plainly [...] a work in progress\\", while Comics Bulletin felt it was nice but inappropriate for an action story. Cascioli was seen as an improvement, but not enough of one to save the disappointing story.

After the First World War international treaty obligations imposed on Germany made this impossible and he applied his talents to automobiles. In 1926 he founded his own automobile manufacturing business, but this succumbed to bankruptcy in 1931. After that he worked for Adler. Here his responsibilities included design and development of new models. One of the cars he designed and developed, launched in 1932, was the Adler Trumpf which was both technologically innovative and successful commercially. He moved, as Technical Director, to Daimler-Benz in 1935, but his career was cut short by Pneumonia to which he succumbed, according to at least one report, after a drive in an open-topped car, and as a result of which he died. Biography =Provenance and early years= Hans Gustav Röhr was born at Uerdingen near Krefeld (into which it has subsequently been subsumed), close to the River Rhine. His father owned a lead rolling mill in the town. His father hoped that he would, in due course, take over the family business, and with that in mind Hans Gustav attended the lower secondary school in Uerdingen between 1905 and 1911. By the time he left school, however, it was clear that he had little enthusiasm for producing lead coils. By contrast, the aviation business - still in its infancy - had completely grabbed his enthusiasm. =Aviation= In 1911, still aged only 17, he accepted a two-year internship at Düsseldorf- Oberkassel with \\"Rheinischen Aerowerke GmbH\\", which he had been offered through the mediation of his friend Joseph Dauben (1889–1960) who was already employed as an engineer by the company. During 1912, Röhr and Dauben, who would remain friends for life, were able to use the facilities at the factory to construct a curiously futuristic airplane to Röhr's design. It was fitted with a five-cylinder radial engine which he constructed himself, using motorcycle cylinders, at a time when many aircraft designs were still using inline engines, and it featured a rod-supported single main wing plane while others believed that the future belonged to the biplanes. Another innovation was a closed cabin to protect the pilot from the weather. Sources differ as to the level of direct financial support he received from his family. One records that his father became progressively more alarmed by his son's obsession with so dangerous a hobby, meaning that the younger Röhr was obliged to accept \\"help from strangers\\". Even the Uedringer casino donated a few barrels of petrol to the dare-devil pioneer. The maiden flight of Röhr's monoplane took place in November 1913, vigorously applauded by onlookers and, in print, by the \\"Uerdinger Anzeiger\\" (local newspaper). In 1914 Gustav Röhr senior, he father of Hans Gustav Röhr, died. All four of his sons inherited the leadership responsibilities for the lead mill. This suited Hans Gustav who was still left with plenty of time for his \\"hobby\\". In July/August 1914 war broke out and he reported to the flying corps (\\"Luftstreitkräfte\\") with his airplane. The advanced design failed to impress the military authorities, however, and the craft was sent back to Uerdingen. Röhr himself volunteered to served in the war as a fighter pilot. He received his flight training at the “Griesheimer Sand” airfield near Darmstadt. As a fighter pilot her served in Flanders and achieved two \\"kills\\", before himself being shot down in a \\"Dogfight\\". While he was recovering in a military hospital the military high command revisited the details of the airplane he had presented at the outset of the war: when he was ready to leave hospital, instead of being sent back to the front, he was mandated to develop a 600 PS airplane engine incorporating 21 cylinders, configured radially and fitted with a five-stage compressor. While retaining the military rank of flight-lieutenant, He now teamed up again with his friend Joseph Dauben. Under wartime conditions many car factories and workshops were switched to production of airplanes and their components. The contract for the new engine was to be implemented at the Priamus Automobile Factory in Cologne-Sülz. In 1918 Röhr also took a financial interest in the (financially precarious) Priamus business, and between 1919 and 1921 he served as its chief executive (\\"Geschäftsführer\\"). For the wartime airplane engine, an ambitious power-to-weight target was set of one kilogramme per one unit of horse power. In November 1918, however, as a prototype engine was being made ready for the test-rig, news came through of the German military collapse on the western front. A condition of the armistice signed by the governments on 11 November was the military occupation of the Rhineland by the French and their allies, and in the chaos of those times, as a result of an indiscretion by one of the factory workers, the French military became aware of the existence of the advanced engines. Röhr had no choice but, with heavy heart, to arrange for their immediate destruction. =Automobiles= Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles aircraft construction in Germany was forbidden. Röhr and Dauben switched their focus to automobile development. From the start they were keen to apply their experience of aviation to their work on motorcars. In the words of one source, they wanted to build the aircraft for the high road. That was the philosophy behind several prototypes that they constructed between 1919 and 1924. The elements of Röhr's later designs could already be seen in these prototypes, combining lightweight construction techniques in a car intended to appeal to the masses and to be priced accordingly, while incorporating the quality standards normally associated with the luxury end of the market. During 1919 and 1920 they progressed their work at the Priamus Factory in Sülz, but with the financial collapse of Priamus imminent Röhr resigned his directorship and they moved over to Berlin where they continued their development work at the Charlottenburg premises of the Bolle & Fiedler car and engine factory. (Karl Bolle (1893-1955) was both a successful businessman and, like Hans Gustav Röhr, a former wartime fighter pilot.) The result of their endeavours was a futuristic underslung chassis frame (\\"Tiefbettrahmen\\") using sheet steel and incorporating independent suspension, lightweight construction and, by the time they built their second prototype after moving to Berlin in 1920, hydraulically controlled brakes on all four wheels. The brakes proved problematic, however. As Germany lurched from sustained economic crisis to mere acute austerity, they were unable to find any automobile producer sufficiently adventurous to produce the Röhr design. Röhr Auto AG The alternative was to produce the car himself. Somehow Röhr persuaded Hugo Greffenius (1876–1954), the principal shareholder in MIAG, to support his plans. Backed by the deep pockets of his new investor, including an immediate cash injection of 500,000 Marks, on 30 October 1926 a new company, Röhr Auto AG, was established. Further funding came from Hirsch & Co., a Frankfurt bank. That same year the new company took over the site hitherto occupied by the insolvent Falcon Automobile Factory in Ober-Ramstadt (near Darmstadt). It quickly became apparent that the factory space at the Ober-Ramstadt was not suitable for high volume production, so Röhr sent his chief construction engineer Joseph Dauben back to the drawing board to adapt their existing prototype as an eight-cylinder car that could be produced in relatively small quantities. The result was the Röhr 8. The design reflected the experience gained from the prototype vehicles already built, and featured light weight construction using an underslung chassis frame formed from sheet steel. It had, in consequence, an unusually low centre of gravity by the standards of the time. The independent suspension at both ends of the car was also innovative as was the rack and pinion steering. The Röhr 8/40 was much admired for unparalleled driving qualities. One more recent source refers to its \\"stunning roadability\\". Deliveries began during the middle part of 1927. Along with the excellent driving characteristics, the car won plaudits for its exceptionally smooth and well-balanced engine. Nevertheless, the eight cylinders had only a combined capacity of 1,980cc; with a claimed output of just 40 horsepower, the first Röhr 8 was short of power. During 1927 and 1928 fewer than 100 were produced. In March 1928 the annual German Motor Show returned from Leipzig to Berlin and Röhr took a stand which the company adorned with he slogan \\"Der sicherste Wagen der Welt\\" (loosely, \\"The securest car in the world\\"). The car itself now appeared with a 2,246cc engine. Both the bore (diameter) and the stroke (length) of the combustion chambers in the cylinders had been increased, as had the advertised power output which now stood at 50 horsepower. The claimed maximum speed had increased from 90 km/h to 100 km/h. Apart from the enlargement of the engine and a small adjustment to the bottom gear ratio the car was virtually unchanged. Nevertheless, this Röhr 8 9/50 became the company's first commercial success. Between 1928 and 1930 almost 1,000 were produced. Although its exterior was not particularly remarkable, some of the more astute visitors to the 1928 show stand were impressed by the unusual nature of the chassis, and the design also caught the attention of overseas pundits. Others were dismissive of what they saw as a gratuitously gimmicky approach. While some admired the novel configuration of the rear swing-axle, more conservative elements simply complained that the car was missing a \\"proper\\" (beam) axle at the back. The car was widely discussed in specialist journals and in the general press. After the 1928 motor show the \\"Odenwälder Nachrichten\\" (newspaper) was reporting that the company had finished the show with orders for 2,200 cars. Even if the number was an exaggeration, the exposure at the Berlin show and appearances at other international motor shows over the next couple of years supported a healthy level of demand. In 1929 the Röhr factory at Ober-Ramstadt was employing around 800 people and producing approximately six cars per day. In October 1930 Röhr Auto AG chose the Paris Motor Show for the launch of their new Röhr 8 10/55. The car was a little longer and a little wider than its predecessor. There were numerous technical improvements and the engine size had been further increased, now to 2,496cc. In order to avoid having to extend the length of the car excessively, the engine block now used a \\"narrow V\\" configuration, with the angles of alternating cylinders differing from one another by just 10°. It was a characteristically innovative solution, but it resulted in a much heavier engine block. Despite further increase in power to a claimed level of 55 horsepower, the claimed maximum speed remained unchanged at 100 km/h. Fuel consumption, which had never been stellar in the Röhr 8, was approximately 8% worse than in the previous models (although the fuel tank was approximately 30% larger). Unfortunately the car was launched as the backwash from the Wall Street crash surged across Europe. The company had lost its largest financial backer in 1929 when Hugo Greffenius had withdrawn his support, and no equivalent funding could be found from other sources. The listed retail price for the Röhr 8 10/55 was only slightly higher than that for the earlier model, but sales volumes were nevertheless disappointing, with only around 350 cars produced between 1930 and 1933. Through 1930 the earlier Röhr 8 9/50 was still being produced alongside the newer 8 10/55 model: nevertheless, by the end of 1930 bankruptcy could no longer be put off, and early in 1931 production was halted. As matters turned out, that did not mark an end to production at the Ober-Ramstadt factory. With the agreement of creditors Davos-based \\"Schweizer Holdinggesellschaft für Automobilwerke\\" a Swiss acquired the company's assets at the foreclosure sale in June 1931. The new holding company had been set up for the purpose by Joos Andreas Heintz, Röhr's Swiss importer. Production of the Röhr 8 10/55 resumed. Between 1931 and 1935 the new company, Neue Röhr-Werke AG produced approximately another 2,000 more cars. However, they did so without Hans Gustav Röhr and Joseph Dauben. Adlerwerke AG In or shortly before May 1931 Hans Gustav Röhr joined Adlerwerke AG in Frankfurt as Head of Product Development (\\"Chefkonstrukteur\\"), Technical Director and a deputy member of the board. Adler was a financially challenged but still significant - and, after Röhr joined the company, innovative - motor manufacturer which in terms of unit sales ranked fourth (behind Opel, DKW and Mercedes-Benz) in the German auto- market through the most of the 1930s. With him came Dauben and the \\"hard-core\\" of their technical team, notably Otto Winkelmann, Walter Kurtze und Laurenz Niessen. Adler had come through the 1920s as a manufacture of large traditionally designed cars, consciously inspired by North American manufacturers to be simple and inexpensive to produce. The Adler Standard 6 had become a favourite with the German upper middle class and with those taxi operators who thought the similarly sized offerings from Mercedes-Benz slightly over-specified and over-priced. However, Adlerwerke AG had also suffered from the ill-effects of the economic crash which had triggered the financial collapse of Röhr Auto AG, and by 1931, when Röhr and his team arrived, management had taken a decision to expand the range down-market, which effectively meant competing directly against both the financial might of Opel and the technical inventiveness of DKW. At Adler a team under the direction of Dr. Ing. E.h. Otto Göckeritz and his engineer Gotthilf Henzler were directed to develop what would emerge in 1932 as the 1.5 litre Adler Primus. Their design was in most respect a scaled down version of the company's existing 2.0 litre Favorit, which itself had been launched, in 1929, as a scaled down version of the full-size Adler Standard 6. The challenge presented to Hans Gustav Röhr and his team was to develop a 1.5 litre car of their own which would compete directly with the car produced by the Göckeritz team, but would also incorporate some of the innovations with which Röhr had built his reputation when an independent manufacturer. Even more courageously, Röhr's brief involved designing a front-wheel drive car, following the trend set by the recently presented DKW F1 and Stoewer V 5. Despite the requirement that the Röhr car should feature innovative engineering solutions, there was an over-riding requirement to control costs. This meant that as far as possible the two designs should share their principal components. When, in March 1932, Otto Göckeritz's Adler Primus and Hans Gustav Röhr's Adler Trumpf were presented at the Geneva Motor Show, they came with the same 1504cc 4-cylinder engine. The water pump and electrical components were identical. But the Adler Trumpf incorporated front-wheel drive. Despite that, it was a little lighter and a little quicker thanks to the light-weight chassis construction and relatively advanced suspension and steering systems. It may have been a reflection of the lower weight, or of the desperate need to price the car competitively, that the Trumpf also came with cable operated brakes whereas the otherwise relatively \\"traditional\\" Primus had hydraulic braking. It was the technically more advanced Trumpf that won plaudits from the experts and enthusiasts. No one seemed to mind that the front-wheel diver system appeared to have been shamelessly copied from the DKW F1 and the Stoewer V 5. The DKW was small and (deceptively) simple to look at, while Stoewer was a fringe manufacturer producing only between 1,000 and 2,000 cars per year. Hans Gustav Röhr and Joseph Dauben found themselves acknowledged as experts on front-wheel drive both in Germany and internationally. According to at least one source even André Citroën, the man who had introduced assembly-line manufacturing to Europe (and especially to Opel), seriously considered assembling the Adler Trumpf under licence in Paris, before selecting the (financially more perilous) option of creating his own front-wheel drive model. Despite the Primus and Trumpf being presented in public together in March 1932, it was only the Primus that was production-ready at that point. When the factory re-opened after the 1932 summer holiday shut-down, however, volume production of the Trumpf also began. Both the Trumpf and the Primus were commercially successful, justifying the manufacturer's decision to extend its range down-market to include small family cars, and enabling Adler to leapfrog Mercedes-Benz and, at least in terms of unit sales, achieve third place in the sales charts in 1934 and again in 1935. Once production of both models got into full swing the Trumpf comfortably outsold the Primus, with 18,600 Trumpfs produced between 1932 and 1936, as against a unit production volume for the Primus during the same four years of just 6,713. By the end of the decade more than 25,000 Trumpfs had been built. That was despite that fact that in the traditionally price-conscious German market the advertised price of the Trumpf was generally around 200 Marks higher than for the Primus. Adler remained a major force in the German car market during the 1930s, and throughout that decade the architecture and mechanical underpinnings of their cars continued to carry the unmistakable \\"signature\\" of Hans Gustav Röhr, Joseph Dauben and their remarkable technical team. The Adler Trumpf was followed by all new versions of the Adler Favorit and the Adler Standard, launched at the Berlin Motor Show in February 1933. The cars anticipated European styling trends of the late 1930s, being lower and, with a new all- steel body by Ambi-Budd of Berlin, sleeker than their predecessors: these suddenly looked curiously perpendicular by comparison. Attention focused on the new ZF four speed transmission, the independent suspension and the underslung chassis configuration which facilitated the lower stance of the body. Although for Röhr and his team some of these features may no longer have seemed so innovative as they had when he had pioneered them ten years earlier, they did set Adler apart from the more cautious/conservative approach to car design that continued to be apparent in the mainstream models produced by Opel and Mercedes Benz during the first half of the decade. The new Favorit and Standard shared the same wheelbase and bodywork, being differentiated from one another chiefly through their engine sizes. The Favorit came with a 4-cylinder 1,943cc unit while the Standard 6 was powered by 6-cylinder unit of 2,916cc. (The actual cylinder dimensions were, therefore, identical.) When an 8-cylinder Standard 8 appeared a year later the wheelbase was extended by just over 12 cm to accommodate the longer engine. Commercially the new Favorit failed to take the market by storm and was withdrawn after a year, but the 6-cylinder Standard continued to sell in respectable numbers, with further improvements and a name change along the way, till 1940. During the first part of 1934 Adler began production of the Adler Trumpf Junior, which was in many ways the most important of the Adlers developed by Röhr and Dauben. With more than 100,000 sold, it was the top selling Adler of the 1930s. Conceptually it was the most modern of Röhr's Adlers, with front wheel drive and independent front suspension using two overlapping transversely mounted leaf springs. The rear suspension was also inventively thought through. The rack and pinion steering was in effect the system originally used for the 1927 Röhr 8. The characteristic Röhr underslung chassis permitted a low centre of gravity and above-average road holding and, while giving the car a far more modern and dynamic look than the new competitor offering from Opel which also appeared in 1934. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the Trumpf Junior was developed under acute time pressure. There being no engine from existing models that could be adapted to fit under the bonnet/hood, and no time to design a small compact engine, the team looked around for a modern engine and reverse engineered it, thereby effectively copying the engine from the widely admired Fiat Balilla. Nor was the engine the only element for which the design was in effect copied from the competition. In 1934 Röhr persuaded the Adler board to take over the Frankfurt-based Flugzeugbau Max Gerner (aircraft manufacturer). There followed a brief but intense period of investment in aircraft prouction capacity. After a few Adler-Gerner biplanes had been constructed the affair proved to be a financial disaster (for Adler), however. By the middle of 1935 Adler had withdrawn from the Gerner project. Röhr's Relations with Adler were further damaged after the company entered into agreements with Imperia and Rosengart under which the Trumpf and Trumpf Junior were to be produced in Belgium and France. The agreements were between the companies involved. Röhr, who had been excluded from them, believed that he should be entitled to a share in the royalties due. Management disagreed and the \\"Röhr team\\" left the company. Röhr's successor was another brilliant engineer, Karl Jenschke from Austria who November 1935 arrived at Adler from the Steyr-Werke (automobile manufacturer) in Austria. Daimler-Benz AG Hans Gustav Röhr and Joseph Dauben now joined Daimler-Benz at Sindelfingen, again \\"as a team\\". Röhr was appointed \\"Technical Director\\" in succession to Hans Nibel who had died following a heart attack in November 1934. The appointment was made at the instigation of Emil Georg von Stauss, a banker who had by this time become chairman of the company's supervisory board. The position urgently needed filling and Röhr brought to it his considerable reputation and experience, but he was nevertheless seen as something of an outsider by the company board, under the chairmanship of Wilhelm Kissel (who back in 1928/29 had already seen off an earlier brilliant Technical Director, Ferdinand Porsche). Röhr was short of academic qualifications and still only 40, which counted against him with his venerable fellow board members at Daimler-Benz. His insistence on bringing his team with him from outside, and his willingness to question articles of faith on matters such as the way a Mercedes-Benz had its rear suspension arranged, again failed to endear him to senior colleagues. Daimler- Benz was also a highly politicised company. Since 1933 Germany had become a dictatorship with strange and - as was by now becoming increasingly apparent - murderously demented ideas on race. There was no suggestion that Hans Gustav Röhr might be Jewish; but he had nevertheless married a French wife which in Hitler's Germany could readily be questioned as unpatriotic. Care was taken, when drafting employment contracts for Röhr and Dauben, that they should be denied access to any military projects in which the company might be involved. Between 1935 and 1937 Röhr and his team worked intensively on developing various front wheel drive designs for Daimler Benz with 4, 6 and even 8 cylinder engines. Several test-prototypes were completed. They featured independently suspended wheels and in some cases weight-saving monocoque steel bodies. Most German automakers had responded to the introduction of all-steel car bodies a few years earlier by entering into a contract with the Berlin- based specialised steel-body maker, Ambi Budd. Daimler Benz were unusual among German auto-makers in havoing insisted, from the outset, on including their own car-body-building facilities as part of their own plant. That put them in a strong position to pioneer monocoque car bodies in Europe. However, Daimler Benz had become in many ways a technically conservative company by this time. Somehow failed Röhr failed to communicate the merits of his advanced designs to management colleagues, and it would take another sixty years before the company would introduce a front-wheel drive Mercedes passenger car to its customers. Back in the late 1930s it was left to Opel to demonstrate the cost saving potential of using monocoque bodies for mainstream automobiles. The board decision not to progress his designs to production, taken in 1936, was a hard blow for Röhr, reflecting his continuing position as an outsider and, some have argued, a certain personal inflexibility. By 1937 it seems to have been mutually accepted that in due course he would be leaving the company. Fate intervened, however. On 10 August 1937, still aged only 42, Hans Gustav Röhr died unexpectedly. He had been driving an open-topped car to the Nürburgring and then suffered from a fatal pneumonia. Elsewhere it is stated that the cause of his death was a viral infection. At Daimler Benz his front- wheel drive designs and the W144 engine/transmission package that went with one of them were very quickly forgotten. Josef Dauben remained with the company, working on development of the high-powered V-12 engines that during the war years would be used to power search-light generators.

Background In March 1952 the US 1st Marine Division was transferred to US I Corps and moved onto the Jamestown Line, the UN's Main line of resistance (MLR) across Korea. The segment of the Jamestown Line assigned to the 1st Marine Division extended southwest from the Samichon River and the left flank of the British 1st Commonwealth Division, crossed the 38th Parallel (the original demarcation between North and South Korea) shifted to the south bank of the Imjin River in the vicinity of Munsan- ni, continued to the conflux of the Imjin and Han River, and then followed the south bank of the Han past the Kimpo Peninsula. Opposing the Marines on the Jamestown Line, the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) had the 65th and 63rd Armies, totaling 49,800 troops. The 7th Marine Regiment took over seven outposts when it relieved the 5th Marine Regiment on the Jamestown Line in early October, renaming them, from left to right, Carson, Reno, Vegas, Berlin, Detroit, Frisco, and Seattle. At the point, later known as the Hook, where the frontline veered southward toward the boundary with the 1st Commonwealth Division, the 7th Marines set up Outpost Warsaw. A second new outpost, Verdun, guarded the boundary between the Marine and Commonwealth divisions. An average of separated four of these outposts, Detroit, Frisco, Seattle and Warsaw, which occupied hills lower than those on the left of the regimental line and therefore were more easily isolated and attacked. Battle =The loss of Outposts Detroit, Frisco and Seattle (2-7 October)= As they did so often, the PVA began with a diversionary thrust at Detroit before artillery and mortar fire preceded the infantry attack on Seattle and Warsaw. A PVA company overwhelmed the reinforced platoon on Warsaw on 2 October, but the Marines fought stubbornly before falling back. Private Jack W. Kelso picked up a grenade thrown into a bunker that he and four other Marines from Company I, 3rd Battalion, 7th Marines, were manning. Kelso threw the live grenade at the advancing PVA, but it exploded immediately after leaving his hand. Although badly wounded, Kelso tried to cover the withdrawal of the other four, firing at the attackers until he suffered fatal wounds. Kelso would earn a posthumous Medal of Honor, but the numerically superior PVA forces captured both Warsaw and Seattle. The Marines counterattacked immediately. Captain John H. Thomas, in command of Company I, sent one platoon against Warsaw, but the PVA had temporarily withdrawn. The lull continued until 01:45 on the morning of 4 October, when a PVA platoon attacked only to be beaten back by the Marines holding Warsaw. Meanwhile, Captain Thomas mounted a counterattack against Seattle early on the morning of 3 October, sending out two squads from the company's position on the main line of resistance. Despite PVA artillery fire, the Marines reached the objective, but Seattle proved too strongly held and Thomas broke off the counterattack. As dusk settled over the battleground, Marine aircraft and artillery put down a smoke screen behind which the counterattack resumed, but the PVA succeeded in containing the two squads short of the crest. To regain momentum, another squad, this one from Company A, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines, which had come under the operational control of the 3rd Battalion, reinforced the other two, but the PVA clinging to Seattle inflicted casualties that sapped the strength of the counterattack. While the Marines regrouped for another assault, the 11th Marine Regiment pounded the outpost with artillery fire. At 22:25 on 3 October, the Marines again stormed the objective, but PVA artillery prevailed, and Seattle remained in PVA hands. The loss of Outpost Seattle, the recapture of Warsaw, and a successful defense of Frisco against a PVA probe on the night of 5 October did not mark the end of the effort to seize the outposts manned by the 7th Marines, but only a pause. The regiment's casualties, 13 killed and 88 wounded by 3 October when the Marines suspended the attempt to retake Seattle, caused the 7th Marines to shuffle units. The 3rd Battalion had suffered most of the casualties. As a result, while 3rd battalion reduced its frontage, the 1/7 Marines, under Lieutenant Colonel Leo J. Dulacki, moved from the regimental reserve to take over the right-hand portion of the Jamestown Line. Dulacki's Marines manned the main line of resistance from roughly southwest of the Hook to the boundary shared with the Commonwealth Division, including Outposts Warsaw and Verdun. Colonel Moore thus placed all three battalions on line, 2nd Battalion on the left, 3rd Battalion in the center, and now Dulacki's 1st Battalion on the right. The 7th Marines completed its realignment just in time to meet a series of carefully planned and aggressively executed PVA attacks delivered on 6 and 7 October against five combat outposts and two points on the main line of resistance. The Marines struck first, however, when a reinforced platoon from Company C, 1st Battalion, attacked toward Outpost Seattle at 06:00 on 6 October. Mortar and artillery fire forced the platoon to take cover and regroup, even as the PVA were reinforcing the outpost they now held. The attack resumed at 09:00. Despite infantry reinforcements, air strikes, and artillery, the Marines could not crack Seattle's defenses and broke off the attack at about 11:00, after losing 12 killed and 44 wounded. The attackers estimated that they had killed or wounded 71 PVA. On the evening of the 6th, the PVA took the initiative, by midnight firing some 4,400 artillery and mortar rounds against the outpost line and two points on the main line of resistance. On the left of Colonel Moore's line, the PVA probed Outposts Carson and Reno, and on the right they stormed Warsaw, forcing the defenders to call for box-me-in fire that severed the telephone wire linking the outpost with the Jamestown Line. The first message from Warsaw when contact was restored requested more artillery fire, which by 20:55 helped break the back of the PVA assault, forcing them to fall back. The most determined attacks on the night of 6 October and early hours of the 7th hit Outposts Detroit and Frisco in the center of the regimental front. To divert attention from these objectives, each one manned by two squads, the PVA probed two points on the main line of resistance that had already been subjected to artillery and mortar bombardment. At 19:40 on the night of the 6th, an attacking company that had gained a foothold in the main trench on Detroit fell back after deadly fire stopped the PVA short of the bunkers. Two hours later, the PVA again seized a segment of trench on Detroit and tried to exploit the lodgment. The Marines reacted by calling on the 11th Marines to box in the outpost. Communications failed for a time, but at about 21:15 the defenders of Detroit requested variable-time fire for airbursts over the bunkers, which would protect the Marines while the PVA outside remained exposed to a hail of shell fragments. The artillerymen fired as the Marines on Detroit asked, but the outpost again lost contact with headquarters of the 3rd Battalion. Two squads set out from the Jamestown Line to reinforce the Marines from Company G, 3/7 Marines, manning Outpost Detroit. The PVA frustrated this attempt with artillery fire but in the meantime again abandoned their foothold on Detroit, probably because of the shower of fragments from Marine shells bursting above them. The respite proved short-lived, however, for the PVA renewed the attack shortly after midnight and extended their control of the hill despite further losses to Marine artillery. A six-man Marine patrol reached the outpost, returning at 03:55 to report that the PVA now held the trenchline and bunkers; only two of the Marines who had manned Detroit escaped death or capture. The attempt to break through to the outpost ended and by 06:30, the Marines engaged in the effort had returned to the main line of resistance. Meanwhile, at about 20:00, a PVA company hit the two squads from Company H that held Outpost Frisco, north of Detroit. The assault troops worked their way into the trenches, but airbursts from Marine artillery reinforced the small arms fire of the defenders in driving the PVA back. The PVA renewed the attack just after midnight, and two Marine squads advanced from the main line of resistance to reinforce Frisco, only to be stopped short of their goal by fire from artillery and mortars. Companies H and I of the 3rd Battalion made further attempts to reach Frisco during the early morning, but not until 05:10 did a reinforced platoon from Company I arrive and take control. During the final attack, Staff Sergeant Lewis G. Watkins, despite earlier wounds, took an automatic rifle from a more badly injured Marine and opened fire to keep the platoon moving forward. When a Chinese grenade landed near him, he seized it, but it exploded before he could throw it away, fatally wounding Watkins, who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. A second platoon from Company I joined the other unit atop the hill and at 07:15 Frisco was declared secure. To keep Frisco firmly in Marine hands, however, would have invited attrition and ultimately required more men than Division commander General Edwin A. Pollock and Colonel Moore could spare from the main line of resistance. Consequently, the 7th Marines abandoned the outpost. The regiment had yielded three outposts, Detroit, Frisco and Seattle but forced the PVA to pay a high price, estimated to include 200 killed. The losses suffered by the 7th Marines totaled 10 killed, 22 missing, and 128 wounded, 105 of them seriously enough to require evacuation. Since the PVA also wrested Outposts 37, 36 and 86 from the Korean Marine Corps, the 1st Marine Division had lost six combat outposts of varying tactical importance. The lost outposts and those that remained in Marine hands had no value except to the extent their possession affected the security of the Jamestown Line. As a result, the Marines remained wary of mounting major counterattacks; to provide continued protection for the main line of resistance, General Pollock would rely on nighttime patrols and listening posts to supplement the remaining outposts and replace the captured ones. =Battle of the Hook (24-28 October)= The fighting for the outposts that raged early in October died down, although the PVA jabbed from time to time at Bunker Hill and continued their nighttime patrolling elsewhere along the Jamestown Line. During the lull, 5th Marines took over the center of the division's line from the 1st Marine Regiment, which went into reserve, improving the fall-back defense lines, undergoing training, and patrolling to maintain security in the rear areas. As the division reserve, the 1st Marines prepared to counterattack if the PVA should penetrate the main line of resistance. Indeed, the regiment had to be ready to help block a PVA breakthrough anywhere in I Corps, which held the western third of the UN line. With the 1st Marines now in reserve, Colonel Moore's 7th Marines manned the right of the division's line placing all three battalions on line and keeping only one company from the 3rd Battalion in reserve. To replace this company, Lieutenant Colonel Charles D. Barrett, the 3rd Battalion's new commander, organized a platoon of cooks, drivers, and other members of the headquarters into an improvised platoon that served as his unit's reserve. Barrett's thinly spread 3rd Battalion manned two combat outposts, Berlin and East Berlin, the latter established on 13 October, besides defending the center of the regimental line. To the left of Barrett's unit, 2/7 Marines defended its portion of the regimental line and maintained three combat outposts, Carson, Reno and Vegas. 2/7 Marines held a sector with few vulnerable salients that the aggressive PVA might pinch off and capture. On the far right of the regimental line, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki's 1st Battalion held the dominant terrain feature in the regimental sector, the Hook, where the high ground that defined the Jamestown Line veered sharply to the south. Outposts Seattle and Warsaw had protected the Hook, but only Warsaw remained in Marine hands. To restore the security of the Hook, Dulacki set up a new outpost, Ronson, some southeast of the PVA-held Seattle and west of the Hook. Ronson guarded the western approaches to the Hook, while Warsaw commanded the lowlands east of the Hook and a narrow valley leading eastward toward the Samichon River. If the PVA should seize the Hook, disastrous results might follow, for the Hook held the key to controlling the Samichon and Imjin valleys. Its capture could expose the rear areas of the 1st Marine Division and force that unit and the adjacent Commonwealth Division to fall back or more to find defensible terrain from which to protect the northeastern approaches to Seoul. Because of the Hook's importance, Colonel Moore set up his headquarters on Hill 146 near the base of the salient. Opposite the 7th Marines, the PVA had massed two infantry regiments, totaling some 7,000 men, supported by 10 battalions of artillery ranging in size from 75mm to 122mm and later to 152mm. The PVA, moreover, had learned during the fighting at Bunker Hill and along the outpost line to make deadlier use of his artillery, massing fires and, when the Marines counterattacked, imitating the box-me-in fires used by the 11th Marines. In preparation for an attack on the Hook, the PVA massed their artillery batteries within range of the salient, stockpiled ammunition, and dug new trenches that reached like tentacles toward the various elements of the outpost line and afforded cover and concealment for attacking infantry. Against the formidable concentration of PVA troops and guns, Colonel Moore's regiment could muster 3,844 Marines, officers and men, supported by 11 Navy medical officers and 133 Hospital Corpsmen, three Army communications specialists, and 746 Korean Service Corps laborers with their 18 interpreters. As in the earlier fighting, the 7th Marines could call upon the 105mm and 155mm howitzers of the 11th Marines, and other Marine supporting weapons including rocket batteries, tanks and aircraft. Army artillery and Air Force fighter-bombers reinforced the firepower of the division. The static battle line placed a premium on artillery, especially the 105mm and 155mm howitzers of the Army and Marine Corps. Indeed, by mid-October 1952 US batteries were firing these shells at a more rapid rate than during the bloody fighting in the early months of 1951, when UN forces advanced beyond the 38th Parallel and conducted offensive operations like Operation Killer and Operation Ripper. By late 1952, firepower, especially artillery, dominated the battleground, as probes, patrols, ambushes and attacks on outposts took the place of major offensives. Because of the demand of artillery support, the rationing of 105mm and 155mm shells became necessary. During the last 11 days of October, a quota prevailed, at least for purposes of planning. In support of the 7th Marines, each 105mm howitzer might fire a daily average of 20 rounds and each 155mm howitzer 4.3 rounds. The 81mm mortars located in each battalion also suffered from a shortage of shells, and even hand grenades were now scarce. To do the work of mortars and artillery, Colonel Moore employed tripod-mounted M1917 Browning machine guns. These weapons employed the techniques of World War I, engaging targets like potential assembly areas with indirect fire based on map data and adjusted by forward observers, as well as aimed direct fire. The PVA initiated the attack on the Hook by battering the salient and its combat outposts with mortar and artillery fire; an estimated 1,200 rounds exploded among the trenches and bunkers on the Hook and Outposts Ronson and Warsaw between dusk on 24 October and dawn on the 25th. The Marine defenders, aided by detachments from the Korean Service Corps, struggled to keep pace with the destruction, repairing damage as best they could during lulls in the bombardment only to face new damage when the shelling resumed. While shoring up trenches and bunkers, the 7th Marines fought back. In the hardest hit area, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki's 1st Battalion returned fire with its own mortars, machine guns, and recoilless rifles, while the regimental mortars and tanks joined in. Despite the shortage of high-explosive shells, the 2nd Battalion, 11th Marines, fired some 400 105mm rounds in response to the first day's PVA bombardment, 575 rounds on the 24 October, and 506 on the 25th, balancing the need to conserve ammunition against the worsening crisis. Air strikes also pounded the PVA massing near the Hook and the two nearby outposts, including attacks by four F9F Panther jets from VMF-311 that dropped high explosives and Napalm on PVA troops massing some east of the salient. During the 24 hours beginning at 18:00 on the 25th, PVA gunners scourged Colonel Moore's regiment with another 1,600 mortar and artillery shells, most of them exploding on the ground held by Dulacki's battalion. The shelling abated briefly on the 25th but resumed, convincing the division's intelligence officer, Colonel Clarence A. Barninger, that the PVA was planning a major attack to overwhelm the Hook and gain control of the Samichon Valley. Barninger warned General Pollock, well in advance of the actual attack. The PVA fire diminished somewhat on the morning of 26 October, but the Hook remained a dangerous place. On that morning, Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki took advantage of a lull to inspect the defenses, only to be knocked down by the concussion from a PVA shell. He escaped with bruises and abrasions and continued his rounds. The intensity of the bombardment increased later in the morning and continued after dark in preparation for attacks on Outposts Ronson and Warsaw and the Hook itself. PVA troops stormed Ronson at 18:10 on 26 October after three days of preparatory fire that had collapsed trenches, shattered bunkers, and killed and wounded Marines at both outposts and on the Hook. At Ronson, 50 or more PVA penetrated the defensive artillery concentrations, overran the position and killed or captured the members of the reinforced squad manning the outpost. At about the same time, a PVA company split into two groups and attacked Outpost Warsaw simultaneously from the east and west. A box-me-in barrage fired by the 11th Marines could not prevent the PVA assault troops from closing in on the defenders. The Marines at Warsaw fought back with grenades, pistols and rifles, using the latter as clubs when ammunition ran out. Taking cover in the wreckage of the bunkers, they called for variable-time fire directly overhead. Hope lingered that the rain of shell fragments had saved Warsaw, but after four hours of silence from the garrison, Colonel Moore reluctantly concluded that Warsaw was lost, its defenders either dead or captured. While the fate of Warsaw still remained in doubt and a platoon from Company C was preparing to reinforce the outpost, a flurry of PVA shells battered the Hook. Colonel Moore reacted by sending Company A to help Company C defend the salient. Moore also directed that the 1st Battalion have first call on the regiment's supply of ammunition. In addition, the 1st Marine Division lifted the restrictions on artillery ammunition fired in support of the Hook's defenders. Under cover of artillery and mortar fire, a PVA battalion launched a three-pronged attack on Dulacki's 1st Battalion. By 19:38 on the 26th, PVA infantry first threatened the main line of resistance southwest of the Hook itself, to the left of the salient and roughly halfway to the boundary with the 3rd Battalion. Within a few minutes, a second attack hit the very nose of the Hook, while a third struck its eastern face. Mingled with the assault troops were laborers carrying construction materials to fortify the Hook after the three prongs of the attack had isolated and overrun it. The thrust along the ridge that formed the spine of the Hook continued until the PVA encountered the observation post from which Second Lieutenant Sherrod E. Skinner, Jr., was directing the fire of the 11th Marines. The lieutenant organized the defense of this bunker, running from cover when necessary to replenish the supply of small-arms ammunition. He was still calling down artillery fire when the attackers overran the Hook. He then told his men to play dead until other Marines counterattacked. For three hours, they fooled the PVA who entered the bunker. Finally, a PVA soldier became suspicious and threw a grenade inside. Skinner rolled onto the grenade, absorbing the force of the explosion and saving the lives of two of his men. He would be posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. To the left of the Hook, the assault force outflanked a platoon of Company C, but they succeeded in pulling back the flanks to form a perimeter. East of the Hook, on the 1st Battalion's right, other elements of Company C formed another perimeter. In the separating the two, scattered groups of Marines struggled to close the gap. Help for Company C began arriving at about 23:30, after the PVA had overrun the Hook, when the first elements of Company A, sent to reinforce made contact with Company C's perimeter to the left rear of the captured salient. The arrival of reinforcements enabled the members of Company C, scattered between the two perimeters, to form a blocking position on a ridge running east and west a few hundred yards to the rear of the Hook. At 03:00 on the 27th, Colonel Moore committed the regimental reserve, Company H, 3rd Battalion. General Pollock ordered the 3rd Battalion, 1st Marines, from the division reserve into the sector held by Moore's 7th Marines. 3/1 Marines, had the mission of counterattacking the PVA who had seized the Hook and penetrated the Jamestown Line. Anticipating commitment in this critical sector, the battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sidney J. Altman, had already drawn up a basic plan for such a counterattack and personally reconnoitered the area. Now Altman's Marines prepared to execute that plan. Tank gunners, mortar crews and artillerymen battered the recently captured Outpost Warsaw, other PVA troop concentrations, firing batteries, and supply routes. The 1st Marine Air Wing also joined in, as F7F Tigercat night fighters used the ground-based AN/MPQ-2 radar to hit the main PVA supply route sustaining the attack, dropping their bombs less than west of the Hook. While the 3/1 Marines prepared to counterattack the Hook, the PVA made a new thrust at the 7th Marines. Early on the morning of 27 October, the PVA attacked Reno, one of the outposts manned by Lieutenant Colonel Caputo's 2nd Battalion. Some west of the Hook, the battalion's three outposts at the Nevada Complex formed an arrowhead aimed at PVA lines, with Reno at the point, Carson on the left, and Vegas on the right. The pattern of hostile activity opposite the 7th Marines earlier in October persuaded General Pollock's intelligence specialists that the PVA had given first priority to seizing the Nevada Complex. This estimate of PVA intentions caused the 11th Marines to plan concentrations in front of the 2nd Battalion, while Caputo set up strong ambush positions to protect the threatened outposts. On the night before the assault on Reno, a reinforced platoon from Company E set out for a camouflaged ambush position about south of Reno and halfway between Carson and Vegas. At midnight, noises to the front alerted the patrol that the PVA had infiltrated between them and the outpost and were preparing to attack Reno from the rear. The ambush force alerted the Marines defending the outpost of the danger behind them and opened fire when the force, estimated at two PVA companies, seemed on the verge of attacking. Although raked by fire from the front and rear, the PVA fought back, holding the Marines in check until they could break off the action and make an orderly withdrawal to the main line of resistance. Quiet enveloped Outpost Reno until 04:00 on the 27th, when a PVA platoon attacked from the northwest, assaulting in two waves. The Marines on Reno beat back this first attack, but a second thrust from the same direction broke through the perimeter. The defenders took cover so that variable- time artillery fire bursting overhead could maul the PVA. These tactics forced the PVA to abandon their lodgment after some 40 minutes of fighting. After the ambush by Marines behind Reno, while the outpost's defenders were fighting off the subsequent PVA assaults, Company A passed through the line established by Byrum's Marines and began advancing toward the Hook. PVA mortar and artillery fire stopped Company A short of the objective, forcing the Marines to dig in and hold the ground they had gained. When that counterattack stalled, Colonel Moore attached the last of the regimental reserve, Company H, 3rd Battalion to Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki's 1st Battalion. At 05:05 Dulacki ordered Company H to renew the counterattack. Within three hours, Company H stood ready to attack the PVA, whose bridgehead encompassed the Hook itself and a crescent of ridges and draws extending from the spine of that terrain feature and embracing a segment of the main line of resistance about wide. Company H rapidly covered the first before PVA small arms, mortar and artillery fire shifted to meet the threat. The company commander pressed the attack, however. Second Lieutenant George H. O'Brien Jr., led his platoon over the ridge to his front, the men zigzagging as they ran toward the PVA-held trenchline. A bullet struck O’Brien's armored vest, knocking him down, but he scrambled to his feet and continued toward the PVA, pausing only briefly to help a wounded man. Throwing grenades and firing his carbine, he silenced the PVA weapons in a bunker and led his platoon toward the Hook itself. This headlong assault, which earned O’Brien the Medal of Honor, broke through the PVA perimeter and approached the PVA-held bunkers on the Hook before being contained by mortar and artillery fire. The remainder of Company H widened the crack that O’Brien's platoon had opened and captured three prisoners as it overran the southeastern portion of the Hook before fierce shelling forced the advance elements to find cover and yield some of the ground they had taken. Marine aircraft helped Company H advance onto the Hook, attacking reinforcements moving into battle and the positions from which the PVA were firing or adjusting fire. Key targets included the former Marine outposts of Irene, Seattle, and Frisco, along with the frequently bombed main supply route and those PVA troops trying to dislodge the Marines who had gained a foothold on the Hook. Fire from Marine tanks and artillery engaged some of the same targets and proved deadly against trenches and bunkers that the PVA had seized. The howitzers also joined mortars in counterbattery fire. At midday on 27 October, after General Pollock had released Company I, 3/1 Marines, to Colonel Moore's control, the counterattack to regain the Hook entered its final phase. Company I would drive the PVA onto the Hook, after which Company H, the unit that had penetrated the Chinese PVA earlier in the day, was to take over the right of the 1st Battalion's line, relieving Company B, which would make a final assault on the Hook and recapture both the Hook and Outpost Warsaw. Company I, launched their attack early in the afternoon. The 1st Platoon, which led the way, seized the crest of the ridge to its front at 13:50 and began advancing toward the Hook behind a barrage laid down by the 11th Marines. The PVA reacted to the threat from I Company with artillery and mortar concentrations directed against not only the advancing Marines, but also Colonel Moore's command post and the weapons along the Jamestown Line that supported the assault. Despite severe casualties, I Company pushed ahead, at times crawling from one outcropping in the shell-torn earth to another. After pausing to reorganize at about 16:35, the company moved, a few men at a time, onto the Hook and forging ahead against PVA in collapsed bunkers and trenches. The deadliest fire came, as always, from PVA mortars and artillery shells that plunged steeply onto the Hook before exploding. Company I took such cover as it could find, but terrain afforded concealment and greater protection from flat-trajectory than from high-angle-fire weapons. By midnight on 28 October, Company B had threaded its way through a maze of shell craters and moved into position to the left of Company I. Shortly afterward Company B began what Dulacki had planned as the final assault on the Hook. Small arms fire and a shower of grenades from the PVA positions stopped the Marines as they attacked with rifles and grenades of their own. After exchanging fire with the PVA for perhaps 90 minutes the company fell back to obtain cover and called for mortar and artillery fire. The shelling battered not only the strongpoints immediately to the front of Company B, but also the PVA's supporting weapons and the routes of reinforcement and replenishment that passed through the PVA-held outposts of Warsaw and Ronson. The Marines renewed the assault at 03:40, broke through, and by 06:00 overran the Hook. Afterward, elements of Colonel Moore's regiment reoccupied Warsaw and Reno, which the PVA had abandoned. A dense fog settled over the Hook as Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki's battalion killed or captured PVA stragglers and reorganized the defenses. Aftermath The battle for the Hook and its two outposts, along with the diversionary action at Outpost Reno, cost the PVA 269 dead and wounded, a number verified as best the Marines could, and perhaps another 953 casualties that escaped verification. In preventing the PVA from gaining a permanent tactical advantage at the Hook, the Marines lost 70 killed, 386 wounded and 39 missing, of whom 27 were prisoners of the PVA. At Reno, 9 Marines were killed and 49 wounded. During the struggle for the Hook, PVA mortars and artillery proved as deadly as usual in both defending against Marine attack and battering Marine defenses. The PVA sent additional soldiers immediately behind the assault troops, intending that they exploit any breakthrough by the earlier waves, but the tactics failed to accomplish the intended purpose. Lieutenant Colonel Dulacki believed that the gambit failed because too few junior officers were on hand to commit the reserve at the precise moment to maintain momentum. Dulacki also found flaws with his Marines. Judging from the frequency of malfunctions, they did not appear to be cleaning and caring for their weapons, as they should. Dulacki also expressed concern that the Marines had become too willing to seek the cover of bunkers during PVA attacks, gaining protection from shell fragments, though not from satchel charges or direct hits by large-caliber shells, at a sacrifice in fields of fire. He believed that infantrymen should build and fight from individual positions with at least some overhead cover, rather than from large bunkers in which several defenders might be isolated and attacked with explosive charges or trapped if a direct hit collapsed the structure. Following the battle, the 29th British Infantry Brigade of the 1st Commonwealth Division took over responsibility for defense of the Hook and the PVA renewed their attacks in the Second Battle of the Hook on 18/19 November 1952.

Financial volatility measures the amplitude of asset price fluctuations, and tends to widen during periods of high uncertainty. His work aims at clarifying the origins of this volatility, the interactions of financial market volatility with the business cycle, and the design of new indicators of uncertainty in the large fixed income markets. During the second half of the 2000s, he elaborated one of the first equilibrium models of financial markets with asymmetric information in the presence of networks amongst agents. He is the author of an over 1,000 pages book devoted to a synthesis of knowledge in Financial Economics. = Contributions to the industry = Since the early 2010s, he has advised Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) on the creation of a suite of indexes of expected volatility in various segments of the fixed income markets.

Samsung's process is based on GAAFET (gate-all-around field-effect transistor) technology, a type of multi- gate MOSFET technology, while TSMC's 3nm process will still use FinFET (fin field-effect transistor) technology, despite TSMC developing GAAFET transistors. Specifically, Samsung plans to use its own variant of GAAFET called MBCFET.https://techxplore.com/news/2019-05-samsung-foundry-event-3nm- mbcfet.amp History =Research and technology demos= In 1985, a Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) research team fabricated a MOSFET (NMOS) device with a channel length of 150 nm and gate oxide thickness of 2.5 nm. In 1998, an Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) research team fabricated a MOSFET (NMOS) device with a channel length of 50 nm and oxide thickness of 1.3 nm. In 2003, a research team at NEC fabricated the first MOSFETs with a channel length of 3 nm, using the PMOS and NMOS processes. In 2006, a team from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National Nano Fab Center, developed a 3 nm width multi-gate MOSFET, the world's smallest nanoelectronic device, based on gate-all-around (GAAFET) technology. =Commercialization history= In late 2016, TSMC announced plans to construct a 5 nm–3 nm node semiconductor fabrication plant with a co-commitment investment of around US$15.7 billion. In 2017, TSMC announced it was to begin construction of the 3 nm semiconductor fabrication plant at the Tainan Science Park in Taiwan. TSMC plans to start volume production of the 3 nm process node in 2023. In early 2018, IMEC and Cadence stated they had taped out 3 nm test chips, using extreme ultraviolet lithography (EUV) and 193 nm immersion lithography. In early 2019, Samsung presented plans to manufacture 3 nm GAAFET (gate-all- around field-effect transistors) at the 3 nm node in 2021, using its own MBCFET transistor structure that uses nanosheets instead of nanowires; delivering a 35% performance increase, 50% power reduction and a 45% reduction in area when compared with 7nm. Samsung's semiconductor roadmap also included products at 8, 7, 6, 5, and 4 nm 'nodes'. In December 2019, Intel announced plans for 3 nm production in 2025. In January 2020, Samsung announced the production of the world's first 3 nm GAAFET process prototype, and said that it is targeting mass production in 2021. In August 2020, TSMC announced details of its N3 3nm process, which is new rather than being an improvement over its N5 5nm process. Compared with the N5 process, the N3 process should offer a 10-15% (1.10-1.15x) increase in performance, or a 25-35% (1.25-1.35x) decrease in power consumption, with a 1.7x increase in logic density (a scaling factor of 0.58x), a 1.2x increase (0.8x scaling factor) in SRAM cell density, and a 1.1x increase in analog circuitry density. Since many designs include considerably more SRAM than logic, (a common ratio being 70% SRAM to 30% logic) die shrinks are expected to only be of around 26%. TSMC plans risk production in 2021 with volume production in the second half of 2022. Beyond 3 nm The ITRS uses (as of 2017) the terms \\"2.1 nm\\", \\"1.5 nm\\", and \\"1.0 nm\\" as generic terms for the nodes after 3 nm. \\"2-nanometre\\" (2 nm) and \\"14 angstrom\\" (14 Å or 1.4 nm) nodes have also been (in 2017) tentatively identified by An Steegen (of IMEC) as future production nodes after 3 nm, with hypothesized introduction dates of around 2024, and beyond 2025 respectively. In late 2018, TSMC chairman Mark Liu predicted chip scaling would continue to 3 nm and 2 nm nodes; however, as of 2019 other semiconductor specialists were undecided as to whether nodes beyond 3 nm could become viable. TSMC began research on 2 nm in 2019. It has been reported that TSMC is expected to enter 2 nm risk production around 2023 or 2024. In December 2019, Intel announced plans for 1.4 nm production in 2029. References Further reading 003 ","title":"3 nm process"},{"id":"60525290","text":"Fehérvári or Fehervari is a surname.

It superseded the East Africa Governors' Conference and was later replaced by the East African Common Services Organization (EACSO). The EACSO in turn was replaced by the first East African Community in 1967.  History  During the Second World War, the British Governors of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika established several regional boards to help coordinate the war effort. Immediately after the end of the war, the British Government published \\"proposals for the future management of the inter-territorial services in East Africa\\", with revised proposals following in 1947. These resulted in the East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council 1947, which came into effect on 1 January 1948. The purpose of the High Commission was to create a single executive authority with competence in certain areas, without otherwise affecting the constitutional status of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika. It would be supported by an accompanying legislature (the Central Legislative Assembly). The 1947 proposals were received badly in Uganda, particularly in Buganda, where the Bataka Party drew successfully on fears that the High Commission would be a supergovernment controlled by Europeans. The creation of the High Commission thereby contributed to the 1949 riots, during which 1,724 Bugandans were arrested. The High Commission comprised the Governors of the three territories and met two or three times a year under the chairmanship of the Governor of Kenya. It administered, among other things, the postal network, telecommunications, railways and ports, and oversaw the collection of certain taxes. Decisions were taken by unanimity. The secretariat was based in Nairobi and composed almost entirely of British civil servants. The High Commission was responsible for a number of subordinate bodies (including the East African Railways and Harbours Administration and the East African Posts and Telecommunications Administration), indirectly employing 21,000 people. In 1960 the expenditures of these bodies totalled 125 million dollars. In June 1961, during the process of decolonisation, representatives of Uganda, Kenya and Tanganyika met in London. They agreed to the creation of the East African Common Services Organization (EACSO), which could provide a similar function to the High Commission following decolonisation. The High Commission was formally replaced by EACSO (which was also headquartered in Nairobi)The Territorial Incidence of the East African Common Services on 9 December 1961 when Tanganyika became the first of the three East African territories to become independent.  Central Legislative Assembly  The East Africa (High Commission) Order in Council 1947 also created an East Africa Central Legislative Assembly. The Assembly comprised the principle executive officers of the High Commission, together with a number of nominated and unofficial members representing the legislatures of the Kenya, Uganda and Tanganyika.

Designed by José Manuel de Carvalho e Negreiros, its construction was ordered in 1746 by the First Patriarch of Lisbon, Tomás de Almeida, and continued until around 1755. History The hermitage was constructed in the middle of farmland used for cattle grazing as well as the production of fodder, maize (corn) and rice. It is likely that it was built so that farmers and agricultural workers could attend Mass on holy days as urban churches were unreachable. At the same time it provided a safe place where these workers could go whenever the area was affected by floods. Its importance declined with the mechanization of agriculture, which meant that small-scale farming became uncompetitive. The church is baroque in style and of considerable size considering it was built in an unpopulated area. It has a single nave and a main chapel at the same height, together with a bell tower. It is similar to its contemporary, the Hermitage São José, which is also located in Lezíria and was probably designed by the same architect. In 1983, the church was desecrated and the original image of Our Lady of the Conception (popularly known as Our Lady of Alcamé) and a gold-toned altarpiece were stolen. View from the front The name Alcamé is believed to come from the Arab-Moroccan \\"achmé\\", meaning wheat, reflecting the crop grown in the area at the time of establishment. From the 19th century the hermitage became an important place of pilgrimage as a result of a legend that a farmer was saved from the bite of a serpent by invoking the Virgin Mary who closed the serpent's mouth with an apple. The pilgrimages ceased for some time but began again in the 1940s until ceasing in 1973 only to start again in 2000. Pilgrims often travel by boat from Vila Franca de Xira on the right bank of the Tagus to the hermitage on the left bank. The pilgrimage from Vila Franca de Xira is held every 10th of June and recreates the original peasant culture of the Lezíria flood plain, with the image of the Virgin in a cart being pulled by oxen. The area of the hermitage is crossed by several drainage channels. Several of them are lined with reeds and present an ideal location for several species of bird including the purple heron (Ardea purpurea), the white stork (Ciconia ciconia), the Eurasian coot (Fulica atra), the whiskered tern (Chlidonias hybrida), the black kite (Milvus migrans) , the osprey (Pandion haliaetus), eagles and owls.

It is situated at Station Road, Raghunathganj of Murshidabad district) in the Indian state of West Bengal. History In 1913, the Hooghly–Katwa Railway constructed a wide broad gauge line from Bandel to Katwa, and the Barharwa–Azimganj–Katwa Railway constructed the wide broad gauge Barharwa-Azimganj-Katwa Loop Line. With the construction of the Farakka Barrage and opening of the railway bridge in 1971, the railway communication picture of this line were completely changed. Total 32 trains including few passenger and express trains stop at Jangipur Road railway station. The distance between Jangipur Road and Howrah railway station is approximately 252 km. Heritage Station Considering the contribution of Jangipur in the development of the railways in India, the Malda Division of Eastern Railway has renovated the Jangipur station as a heritage station to bring back its past glory. But the historic toll tax office, which was once the largest revenue collection centre in the country, has been submerged by the Ganga after erosion of the banks. Mr. Prashant Kumar Mishra, Chief Workshop Engineer of Eastern Railway, who is also holding the additional charge of DRM of Malda Division, said on 14 September 2019 that the Jangipur station building, the most well-known landmark of the area with its thick brick walls, high roof, arches, wooden window shades has been given a new lease of life after structural repairs. \\"It was painted in trade mark red colour and the renovated heritage station building is now the cynosure of all eyes,\\" Mishra added. He further said directors of the East India Company were deeply convinced of the need of railways in India for mobilising its forces across the country. The company wanted to conduct detailed traffic surveys and explore financial viability before deciding to set up a railway network in India. The first report of the directors of East India Rail Company had made mention of two million tonnes of inland traffic between Calcutta, the N.W. and Jangipore Ghat that alone carried more than 7.96 lakh tonnes of goods. It was the toll record of Jangipur that paved the way for construction of the railway network by EIR in India. The official records of the collector of tolls at Jangipur mentioned that in 1844-45, on the Bhagarutty River boats passed through that branch of the river, containing 21,497,750 maunds, or taking 27 maunds to the ton, the tonnage of the laden cargo boats was 796,213 tonnes. G.Ashburner of Messers Macintyre and Company in his letter dated 2 September 1844 to R Macdonald Stephenson stated, \\"I am satisfied indeed after very careful enquiry and minute attention to the subject that no country in the world has ever offered so tempting a field for the investment of capital in railways as the Valley of Ganges from one extremity to the other.\\" \\"I have searched for the toll house in the banks of river Ganges, but sadly it no longer exists as it is now lying submerged in the river after erosion,\\" Mr Mishra added.

Consisting largely of stories told from a Radio X radio show presented by Josh Widdicombe, the book describes amusing incidents in which Acaster ended up in embarrassing situations, referred to as \\"scrapes\\". The scrapes are often one-off stories, but many are on the subjects of childhood embarrassment, Acaster's experiences performing as a drummer, and his early ventures into stand-up comedy. The book was a bestseller in The Sunday Times and received positive reviews. Acaster's second book, Perfect Sound Whatever, followed in August 2019. Background James Acaster is an English comedian from Kettering, known for appearances on panel shows such as Mock the Week. In 2012, his friend Josh Widdicombe got a weekly radio show on Radio X. Acaster quickly became a regular guest on the show, where he would discuss his \\"scrapes\\"—funny incidents from his past or from the previous week in which he had made bad decisions and ended up in ridiculous scenarios. He became known as \\"the Scrapemaster\\". Following the show, Acaster wrote up these stories into his first book, James Acaster's Classic Scrapes. The book was announced in December 2016 and published by Headline Publishing Group in 24 August 2017. An audiobook narrated by Acaster was published on Audible on the same date. In autumn 2017, Acaster went on a book tour for promotion, which consisted of 21 events. Synopsis Acaster recalls scrapes in roughly chronological order, beginning with anecdotes from his childhood such as wiping his wet hands on a classmate's coat or pretending he knows juggling for a Cub Scout performance. He tells stories set in his secondary school years, in which an assembly performance fell flat and a \\"Humpty Dumpty\\" routine became very popular. Acaster plays the drums, and he joined the school band on a trip to Holland. He relates stories from working in a pub kitchen. In the meantime, he formed various bands such as Pindrop, in which their lead singer would scream rather than sing onstage, and The Wow! Scenario, which led to Acaster and friends collecting large yellow \\"W\\"s. Acaster had a singing teacher for two years and they remained in contact afterwards; having a key to her house, he once let himself in to go to the toilet when he was desperate, without her knowledge. Other musical scrapes involve other bands of his, a jam night and a performance at the Greenbelt Festival. Acaster also tells stories involving his friends, such as a time he stole a road sign. Aged 18, Acaster says he had a \\"midlife crisis\\", which led him to coming up with bucket lists and setting himself challenges. Examples vary from skydiving for charity to singing karaoke. The book contains three stories of separate car crashes; in the first, Acaster lost control of the car shortly after passing his test. In the second, he fell asleep at the wheel after his final performance with a band. The third was whilst he was driving on tour as a comedian. There are several chapters discussing one-off stories such as one night where Acaster got very drunk and unusually aggressive while alone on a bus. Some scrapes involve Acaster on holiday, such as a trip to Alcatraz Island. Acaster began performing stand-up whilst working with autistic children at a school. Following a stand-up performance in Basingstoke, Acaster slept in a bush. After nine months of stand-up, Acaster was invited to be a support act for comedian Josie Long on tour, and quit his school job. Following this, he supported comedian Milton Jones. The book ends with a chapter called \\"Cabadged\\", about a series of cabbage-related pranks with a friend's nine- year-old son, Mick. Acaster had gone to stay at the friend's house after a performance and Mick left cabbage leaves between his bedsheets before he arrived. Mick continued \\"cabadging\\" Acaster until he retaliated by placing fifty cabbages around Mick's room, and the pair agreed on a truce. Reception The book was a bestseller in The Sunday Times and chosen by the newspaper as a 2017 Humour Book of the Year. The List included the book in an article titled \\"Best books by comedians in 2017\\". The book was nominated for a 2018 Chortle Award in the Book category. Matt Rudd of The Sunday Times describes the book as \\"a charming and nostalgic memoir\\", noting that it is unusual for being a comedian autobiography with a non-depressing tone. Steve Bennett of Chortle praises that the book's humour about embarrassment is made relatable and \\"universally hilarious\\" through its \\"painfully funny\\" writing style. Matt Forrest of The Reviews Hub reviews a book tour performance in which Acaster read highlights from his book and conducted Q&A; sessions. Rating it five stars out of five, Forrest commends Acaster as a \\"fantastic, engaging storyteller\\" and praises his \\"surreal, and absurd sense of humour\\". However, Forrest notes that hecklers and audience distractions left a \\"bitter taste\\", despite Acaster's \\"quick-witted and versatile\\" attempts to handle these situations. Sequels Perfect Sound Whatever is a follow-up book to Classic Scrapes, about an obsessive challenge that Acaster undertook in 2017 to collect as much music from 2016 as possible. It was published by Headline Publishing Group in August 2019.

Tolomeo went through her entire life either confined to her bed or in a chair due to a progressive paralysis that rendered her disabled (she had suffered from this since her childhood to which no doctor could help alleviate). Throughout her life she gained a reputation for her piousness and the messages of the Gospel she sought to spread to others while a guest on a local radio station from 1994 until her death. Her time on the radio station marked her interest in reaching out for the conversion of sinners with an emphasis on reaching out to prostitutes or families in need. Her beatification process opened just over a decade following her death and she became titled as a Servant of God; it was a decade following that in which Pope Francis titled her as Venerable upon confirming her life of heroic virtue. Life Gaetana Tolomeo - known also as Nuccia - was born in Catanzaro Sala - on 10 April 1936 (on Good Friday) to Salvatore Tolomeo and Carmela Palermo (who both married on 29 November 1933). Her birth was not registered until 19 April which on the official documents was considered her official date of birth. Father Teodoro Diaco baptized her on 12 July 1936 in the Chiesa della Madonna del Rosario. Her maternal aunt was Elvira Palermo. Her brother Giuliano was born on 30 October 1940 but died around 1944. In her childhood she suffered from a progressive and deforming paralysis that stunted her growth and left her disabled. Her parents sought out treatment for her and so sent her to an aunt in Cuneo where she could be treated. The doctors in Cuneo were unable to help alleviate her condition and so she was forced to return to her hometown. Her condition progressed as she grew older which left her confined either to her bed or to a chair. But despite her condition she saw this as God using her suffering to reach the hearts of others in an effort to convert them from their sins. This was something that Tolomeo was adamant about for her entire life and which was also manifested in some of her writings. But Tolomeo also saw her condition as a participation in the Passion of Christ and also alluded to this in her spiritual writings. Tolomeo also for a time was a member of Catholic Action. Those who came to visit her all noticed the fact that at all times she held clasped in her hands a rosary and Tolomeo herself was a frequent attendee for Eucharistic Adoration. People from her town and surrounding areas knew of her and came to her seeking advice which also included priests and small families. In 1994 she began to collaborate with the local radio station \\"Radio Maria\\" in order to spread the message of the Gospel to the suffering (with whom she identified) but also to drug addicts and prostitutes while also extending her outreach to families in need facing difficulties. Tolomeo often made appearances on the \\"Il Fratello\\" program in which the host Federico Quaglini would interview her and discuss spiritual matters with her. Tolomeo also had a strong devotion to Saint Pio of Pietrelcina. Tolomeo suffered a pulmonary edema and was admitted to hospital where she received a blood transfusion. Her health continued to decline until her death on 24 January 1997; her death was announced on \\"Radio Maria\\" the following morning. Her remains were exhumed and transferred in a white casket to the Chiesa del Monte dei Morti e della Misericordia in Catanzaro. Tolomeo's remains were relocated on 1 November 2010 following a Mass that the Archbishop of Catanzaro-Squillace Antonio Ciliberti presided over; this came after her remains were exhumed on 17 September (in the presence of Ciliberti and the Tolomeo's cause's vice-postulator Pasquale Pitari) for inspection. The local council approved of the exhumation on 15 June 2010 while the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued their approval on 21 June while issuing a set of instructions for performing it. Her cousin Ida Chiefari wrote the first official biographical account of her life following her death. Beatification process The beatification process opened in the Catanzaro-Squillace archdiocese in a diocesan investigation into her life and reputation for holiness that spanned from 31 July 2009 until it was concluded some months later on 24 January 2010. This occurred despite the fact that the formal introduction of the cause did not come until 25 September 2009 when the Congregation for the Causes of Saints issued the official \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections to the cause being introduced) edict and titling Tolomeo as a Servant of God. The C.C.S. later received the documentation collected during the investigation and validated the process on 9 April 2011 as having complied with their regulations for conducing causes. The postulation (the officials in charge of the cause) submitted the Positio dossier to the C.C.S. on 10 October 2012 for further assessment. The nine theologians approved her cause at their meeting while the C.C.S. also confirmed their approval to the cause on 26 March 2019 after both bodies had assessed the dossier. Tolomeo became titled as Venerable on 6 April 2019 after Pope Francis signed a decree that recognized that Tolomeo had led a life of heroic virtue. The current postulator for this cause is the Capuchin priest Carlo Calloni while the current vice-postulator for the cause is the Capuchin priest Pasquale Pitari.

It is a coastal barangay in the city of Parañaque situated just south of Baclaran adjoining the Ninoy Aquino International Airport complex to the east. The approximate boundaries are Alonzo Street and Asean Avenue in Baclaran to the north and McDonough Road and Coastal Terminal Road in Don Galo to the south, with the Estero de Tripa de Gallina and Manila Bay to the east and west. Across the stream in the east, Tambo is bordered by the Pasay district of Maricaban (Barangays 191-200) and the Parañaque barangay of Santo Niño (former Ibayo), where the international airport is located. It also administers most of Entertainment City situated in the Manila Bay reclamation area called Bay City. As of the 2015 census, it had a population of 25,699. History The village of Tambo was named for the tiger grass used to make brooms () that grew there in abundance during the Spanish colonial period. It may have also been named for the lodging houses () that stood in this former colonial beach strip which was one of the earliest barrios established in the Augustinian missionary town of Parañaque. Prior to the reclamation of Roxas Boulevard (former Dewey Boulevard) during the American colonial period, Tambo was a popular beach destination for Manila residents with resorts such as Aroma and El Faro lining the Manila Bay coast. On July 15, 1898, the First California Volunteers established Camp Dewey in a coastal forest in Tambo just north of Don Galo at the height of the Spanish–American War. This military camp in Tambo would remain under U.S. Army possession throughout the Philippine–American War and until 1937 when it was converted into a Philippine Army camp named Camp Claudio by President Manuel Luis Quezon. In the early 1900s, the village was the location of several seaside mansions and became an elite enclave by the latter part of the American colonial period. One such mansion is the Colonial Revival style Palacio de Memoria (former Villaroman Mansion) built in the 1930s beside the Los Tamaraos Polo Club, a sports and social club founded by Joaquín Miguel Elizalde and his brothers which was housed in a Georgian style building built in 1937. The mansion is now used as an auction house owned by Philippe Jones Lhuillier. The beach that used to stretch from Pasay in the north, where the original Manila Polo Club was located, to Las Piñas in the south, where the Jale Beach (presumably owned by the Jalandoni and Ledesma families) once stood, was gradually replaced by Dewey Boulevard (now Roxas Boulevard) between the 1940s and 1960s. In 1985, the Manila–Cavite Expressway was opened on another reclaimed area in the southern section of Tambo as an extension of Roxas Boulevard. The village was enlarged again with the creation of Bay City west of Roxas Boulevard by the Philippine Reclamation Authority in the 1970s and 1980s as part of the South Reclamation Project under Boulevard 2000. It added of land area to Parañaque and which it now shares with neighboring Don Galo. Tambo's shoreline is now approximately west of its original coast. In 2003, the former American military camp known as Camp Claudio was transformed into a housing and urban development site by the national government. In 2013, Solaire Resort & Casino, the first integrated resort of Entertainment City, was opened in the reclaimed portion west of Tambo (Bay City, Metro Manila). Education The village is home to the following educational institutions: * Camp Claudio Elementary School * Nativity House of Learning * Parañaque Christian School * Parañaque National High School (Tambo Annex) * Tambo Elementary School Transportation Roxas Boulevard near the interchange of NAIA Expressway and NAIA Road in Tambo Aerial view of NAIA Expressway in Tambo Tambo is a major transportation hub in southwest Metro Manila. It is located along the busy Baclaran-Bay City traffic corridor south of EDSA where several major thoroughfares are routed through. The main north–south highways servicing Tambo are Roxas Boulevard in the north and the Manila–Cavite Expressway in the south, with NAIA Road and the elevated NAIA Expressway separating them and providing access to the Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Entertainment City on either ends. Macapagal Boulevard is the main street in the village's Bay City section which runs parallel to Jose Diokno Boulevard further west linking these mixed-use developments and gaming hubs in Manila's new tourist belt. On the village's old eastern section runs the north–south Elpidio Quirino Avenue connecting Tambo to Don Galo and La Huerta to the south. It is also linked to Roxas Boulevard through the narrow Old Airport Road and to the airport complex through Andrews Avenue. The Parañaque Integrated Terminal Exchange is located at the Asia World subdistrict of Bay City by the village's border with Don Galo. It is a major bus terminal with local, intercity and provincial connections. The village is also served by the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 through jeepney connections from the Baclaran station located just from the village. When the Line 1 extension to Cavite is completed, it will have its own station on the Manila International Airport Road (NAIA Road) at its junction with Roxas Boulevard.

Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes appear crowded and are mostly ascending to erect with an asymmetrically ovate to elliptic shape. They are in length and wide with fine, sparse, straight hairs lying flat against the surface. The phyllodes have a slightly excentric midrib and obscure lateral nerves. It blooms between August and September producing simple or racemose inflorescences that have obloid to subglobular flower-heads that are around in length and contain 14 to 26 golden or rich lemon yellow coloured flowers. After flowering it forms thinly coriaceous seed pods that are velvety with ferruginous to silvery-ferruginous hairs. The pods have a narrowly oblong shape and are uo to in length and wide. The shiny black seeds inside have an ovate to oblong-elliptic shape and are in length with a clavate aril. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Mary Tindale in 1980 as part of the work Notes on Australian taxa of Acacia as published in the journal Telopea.

RMT proposes that all human interactions can be described in terms of just four \\"relational models\\", or elementary forms of human relations: communal sharing, authority ranking, equality matching and market pricing (to these are added the limiting cases of asocial and null interactions, whereby people do not coordinate with reference to any shared principle). The theory Relational models theory proposes four relational models which are each argued to be innate, intrinsically motivated, and culturally universal (though with culture-specific implementations). =The four relational models= The four relational models are as follows: * Communal sharing (CS) relationships are the most basic form of relationship where some bounded group of people are conceived as equivalent, undifferentiated and interchangeable such that distinct individual identities are disregarded and commonalities are emphasized, with intimate and kinship relations being prototypical examples of CS relationship. Common indicators of CS relationships include body markings or modifications, synchronous movement, rituals, sharing of food, or physical intimacy. * Authority ranking (AR) relationships describe asymmetric relationships where people are linearly ordered along some hierarchical social dimension. The primary feature of an AR relationship is whether a person ranks above or below each other person. Those higher in rank hold greater authority, prestige and privileges, while subordinates are entitled to guidance and protection. Military ranks are a prototypical example of an AR relationship. * Equality matching (EM) relationships are those characterized by various forms of one-for-one correspondence, such as turn taking, in-kind reciprocity, tit-for-tat retaliation, or eye-for-an-eye revenge. Parties in EM relationships are primarily concerned with ensuring the relationship is in a balanced state. Non-intimate acquaintances are a prototypical example. * Market pricing (MP) relationships revolve around a model of proportionality where people attend to ratios and rates and relevant features are typically reduced to a single value or utility metric that allows the comparison (e.g., the price of a sale). Monetary transactions are a prototypical example of MP relationships. =Meta- relational models= The four elementary relationships can be combined to form more complex configurations of relationships called meta-relational models. Meta-relational models typically take the form of entailments or prohibitions, which imply certain obligations, behaviors or relationships between multiple dyads within a particular configuration (e.g., within a triad with members A, B and C, A being in a CS relationship with B prohibits B from being in a CS relationship with A's enemy, C). Examples of meta-relational models include the compadrazgo relationship, describing the entailment of relationships between the parents and godparents of a child, and the incest taboo, describing the prohibition of relationships among certain members of the same family. =Relational models as an explanation of interpersonal conflict= According to RMT, mis-matching of relational models is a common cause of interpersonal conflict, given that different relational models will often imply different behaviors in the same situation. Taking two housemates sharing dishwashing as a simple example, Fiske suggests that if housemate A assumes dishwashing is governed by a CS framework and housemate B assumes an EM framework, A will expect both of them to wash dishes whenever they can, and B will expect them to take turns. If A is busy and B is not, A will expect B to wash the dishes, but if B washed the dishes last, they'll assume it's A's turn, and conflict will ensue because of A and B's mis-matched relational models. =Correspondence between relational models and Stevens's levels of measurement= Fiske proposed that the four discrete types of relationships correspond to Stevens's four levels of measurement. CS relationships resemble the categorical (nominal) scales of measurement in that all members of the relationship are equivalent. AR resembles an ordinal scale given that members of the relationship are placed in a linear ordering. EM relationships resemble interval measurement given that they are kept in balance by addition and subtraction. Finally, MP relationships resemble a ratio scale (whose origin corresponds, for example, to a price of zero) given that they involve proportions, multiplication and division and the distributive law. Influence The two main, original publications on relational models theory have been cited over 4000 times. =In moral psychology= Relational models theory has had wide-ranging influence throughout the field of moral psychology. This influence includes an extension of the original theory to explain moral judgments in the context of interpersonal relationships in the form of relationship regulation theory, which describes the way in which people will judge and react to similar actions differently, depending on the relational context in which the act occurs. Relational models theory has also been used to explain interpersonal violence in the form of virtuous violence theory, and as a building block of one of the more prominent theories in moral psychology, moral foundations theory. =In other areas= RMT has been influential in the development of Steven Pinker's theory of indirect speech, and folk-psychological studies of groups. Additionally, RMT has also been used to help explain the positive social emotion of \\"Kama Muta\\", typically described as the experience of \\"being moved\\" (also related to the emotion elevation, and the concept of empathic concern). According to this view, \\"Kama Muta\\" is triggered by witnessing the sudden intensification of a communal sharing relationship.

Wellum is Professor of Christian Theology and editor of the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology.http://www.sbts.edu/academics/faculty/stephen-j-wellum/ He is married to Karen, and the two have five adult children. Wellum has written numerous academic articles and contributed to books on various aspects of theology. His most known works, however, have dealt the doctrines of covenant theology and Christology. For the former, he wrote the systematic theology sections in Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical–Theological Understanding of the Covenants,https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-through-Covenant-Second-Biblical- Theological/dp/1433553074/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=Stephen+Wellum&qid;=1555588164&s;=gateway&sr;=8-4 and for the latter he has written the Christology volume for the Five Solas and the Foundations of Evangelical Theology series.https://www.amazon.com/Christ-Alone-Uniqueness-Jesus- Savior/dp/0310515742/ref=sr_1_5?keywords=Stephen+Wellum&qid;=1555588164&s;=gateway&sr;=8-5https://www.amazon.com/God- Son-Incarnate-Foundations- Evangelical/dp/1581346476/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Stephen+Wellum&qid;=1555588164&s;=gateway&sr;=8-1 In Kingdom through Covenant, he originally identified project Gentry and he were doing as Progressive Covenantalism, calling it a subset of so-called New Covenant Theology. Due to the theological claims among some in New Covenant Theology, particularly regarding a covenant at creation with Adam and the active obedience of Christ, Wellum decided to disconnect the movements in his latter work of collected essays titled, Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenantal Theologieshttps://www.amazon.com/Progressive-Covenantalism-Dispensational- Covenantal- Theologies/dp/1433684020/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Stephen+Wellum&qid;=1555588164&s;=gateway&sr;=8-3 and in the revision of Kingdom through Covenant. The various scholars that wrote for the book Progressive Covenantalism demonstrated just how widespread the movement had become and how connected it was to evangelical academies. This was a striking difference from New Covenant Theology, which had largely been associated with local pastors. In his works on Christology, Wellum works through the doctrine of the Person of Christ in God the Son Incarnate, which was his work for the Foundations in Evangelical Theology series, and the doctrine of the Work of Christ in Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior, his work for the Five Solas Series edited by Matthew Barrett. In both works, Wellum aims to reaffirm classic doctrines of Christianity. The former, God the Son Incarnate, aims to reaffirm Chalcedonian Christology in the modern age, while the latter aims to reaffirm the classic Protestant, and particularly Reformed, doctrine of the work of Christ. Wellum has also co- authored a lay-level biblical-theological account of Christology with Trent Hunter titled, Christ from Beginning to End: How the Full Story of Scripture Reveals the Full Glory of Christ.https://www.amazon.com/Christ-Beginning-End- Scripture-Reveals- ebook/dp/B072TNRBQY/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=Stephen+Wellum&qid;=1555588164&s;=gateway&sr;=8-2 References Year of birth missing (living people) Living people American Christian theologians ","title":"Stephen J.

Vickers Edwards using a compact arrow layout, opened as the West Riding Private Asylum in 1902. It became Scalebor Park Mental Hospital in the 1920s. Although initially established as a private asylum for fee-paying patients, the facility was owned by the West Riding County Council. Being unable to compete with the state, it joined the National Health Service as Scalebor Park Hospital in 1948. After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in 1995. Parts of the hospital site were demolished, and the main administration block was converted into apartments in 2001.

The club would go on to reach the preliminary final that year but were defeated by Balmain 36-33 ending Souths run of successive grand final appearances. The following season, Souths again reached the preliminary final but were defeated by Manly- Warringah. Ranier's final season at Souths saw the club finish third last on the table as by that stage most of the stars in the side had either retired or moved to other clubs. Ranier then joined arch rivals Eastern Suburbs in 1959. In 1960, Eastern Suburbs reached the NSWRL grand final against St George.
