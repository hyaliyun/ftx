In fact, flooding along the Ottawa River has been recognized as the most important weather event of the year 2019 in Canada, and the one along the Saint John River as the ninth, by Environment and Climate Change Canada.. The flooding caused by the rapid spring snow melt, coupled with frozen ground, and several heavy rain events that resulted in abnormally high cumulative rainfall for April and May. In Quebec, 6681 residences of 51 municipalities were flooded in five main zones, including the greater Montreal area, and 3458 residences were isolated due to landslides and submerged roads resulting in over 13500 disaster victims. In New Brunswick, 15 communities were affected and 69 roads and 45 bridges were closed or partially closed. With the experience gained during the 2017 Quebec floods, the Canadian Armed Forces were called early on to support local authorities and volunteers in the regions as soon as the rivers showed signs of potential flooding and weather forecasts showed a heightened risk. More than 2200 Canadian soldiers were deployed in the three provinces to assist residents.  Meteorological conditions During the spring thaw, runoff from snow melt flows into rivers, causing localized overflows each year in many parts of the three provinces. The winter of 2018-2019 was particularly cold and snowy, the thick snowpack remained for an extended period into may while temperatures remained colder than average. In addition, late snowfall and \\"freezing rain\\" affected the area in early April, leaving more than 20 cm of snow everywhere and up to 20mm of ice on the Ottawa River and Montreal In the second half of the month, several depressions left significant accumulations of rain and then temperatures began to rise abruptly. This has had the effect of accelerating snowmelt and surface runoff. On April 28, many rivers reached and exceeded the flood threshold that was seen in the previous flood in 2017. After a lull in the first 8 days of May, which reduced river levels, a large meteorological depression deposited 30mm to 50mm of within 3 days. Most of the reservoirs in the Abitibi- T√©miscamingue region were already nearing capacity, and could not hold anymore surplus and the excess water flowed into the Ottawa River and the St.Lawrence River between Mattawa and Gatineau, water levels were expected to rise in the following days to record values Over the following month, the levels in streams began to decline as less precipitation fell and the remaining snow cover was almost all melted away in northern areas and nonexistent in the south. The floods gradually subsided: first in New Brunswick, then in Ontario and Quebec. By the end of June, almost all areas were no longer flooded.  Operation LENTUS  When the government of Quebec and New Brunswick requested the deployment of the Canadian Armed Forces, approximately 1000 soldiers were first assigned to this task. Canadian soldiers from operation LENTUS deployed on a flooded street in Laval, Quebec. The number of deployed quickly rose to more than 2200 after additional assistance in Ontario as well as the added rainfall in late April that continued to raise water levels. The mission, known as Operation LENTUS , included more military personnel deployed to flood-affected areas in Ontario, Quebec, and New Brunswick, than there were on all previous missions in Canada. As of May 3, approximately 1000 personnel from the Joint Task Force Central (JTFC) of the Canadian Joint Operations Command were present at Ottawa, Constance Bay, Wilola, Clarence-Rockland, Cumberland and Grand View in Ontario. In Quebec, the number of deployed was 1050 from Joint Task Force East (JTFE) and deployed throughout the province. Among them, nearly 400 Reservists and Seamen from HMCS Donnacona, HMCS Jolliet, HMCS Montcalm, HMCS Iberville, HMCS Radisson and HMCS Champlain. The 438th Tactical Helicopter Squadron provided air support. At the same time in New Brunswick, nearly 200 soldiers from Joint Task Force Atlantic (JTFA) were taking part in the operation and the 403rd Helicopter Operational Training Squadron was providing air support . The main tasks of the CAF were: * fill and move sandbags; * lend a hand to the most vulnerable citizens; * ensure the well-being of residents in the affected areas; * help evacuate people from flooded areas; * support efforts to protect property from flooding. The Canadian Armed Forces officially ended the operation on June 6.

The Unit is headed by a Deputy Inspector General rank officer; currently by Jitender Rana, an IPS officer from Bihar cadre. The Headquarters of the Unit is situated at Shastri Park near Delhi IT Park. It is the single largest unit of CISF in the country with sanctioned strength of 12,528 personnel. The Unit operates two control rooms for better monitoring and coordination and has different specialised wings: Quick Reaction Team, Dog Squad and Bomb Detection Squad. Induction Delhi Metro is a rapid transit system serving Delhi and its satellite cities in the National Capital Region since the inauguration of its first line in 2002. Initially the security coverage to the Delhi Metro network was provided by the Delhi Police until 2007. However, on 15 April 2007 the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India, handed over the security of metro to the Central Industrial Security Force. The Unit provides security and protection to all the metro stations, depots and railway substations (RSS). Security threats in Delhi Metro Delhi Metro has a large network of 10 different lines consisting of 253 stations with track length . Even though crime rate, including pickpocketing, walking on the metro track and carrying illegal arms and ammunition, in the metro system is rising but the manpower to provide security is not enough. The present deployed strength of the CISF Unit DMRC is of around 9,000 personnel out of which 7,000 are posted and rest are on 'internal security' duty. In 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs approved 5,000 additional personnel for the Unit. With the sanctioned strength of total 12,528 personnel, the Unit has become the largest single-unit under the security cover of the CISF in the country. Security coverage Security point of CISF at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium Metro Station Yamuna Bank The CISF personnel are responsible for access control of passengers inside the metro stations and each passenger must go through a door frame metal detector (DFMD) before being frisked by a CISF personnel. Double-layered frisking is carried out when threat perception is high like on the national days viz the Independence and the Republic day in which a commuter is also frisked even before entering the DFMD. The Unit operates two centralised control rooms, Operational Control Centres (OCC), at Barakhamba Road and Shastri Park that are connected with CCTV cameras installed across the Delhi Metro network for better monitoring and coordination. The control rooms are the centres where important information is gathered from the different locations across the network and communicated to the senior officials and the subsequent orders on urgent matters and relevant information are passed over to the respective officers deployed in the field. Periodic security mock drills are carried out by the Unit at stations and on trains to ensure preparedness and coordination of different agencies ‚Äì DMRC, police, fire brigade and medical service ‚Äì during potential emergency situations. Several Quick Reaction Teams (QRTs) are deployed by the Unit to counter any potential man-made threat to the security of the metro system. On average five stations are assigned as area of responsibility to each QRT and it keeps swinging between these stations focusing especially in the area excluded from paid area of a metro station. A special Dog Squad Wing headed by an inspector-rank officer is maintained by the Unit which employs more than 60, mostly female, sniffer dogs of five breeds: Labrador Retriever, German Shepherds, Cocker Spaniels, Golden Retriever and Belgian Malinois. All the dogs are kept at Unit's kennel in Shastri Park and each one of them is cared and managed by its designated handler of the rank of head constable or constable who receives at least two months of basic training in this regard. The dogs undergo training at either Border Security Force's National Training Center for Dogs, Tekanpur or Central Reserve Police Force's Dog Breeding And Training School, Bangalore. They are trained to assist the personnel in detecting arms, explosives and narcotics. These dogs are considered part of the force and treated as sepoy with four- hour working shift in a day. After a service of 10 years the dogs get retired and the Unit gives them up for adoption through NGOs without any charges. The Bomb Detection Squad (BDS) Wing of the Unit equipped with required electronic devices has a responsibility to detect any potential explosives or IEDs. The vehicle-borne BDS teams regularly conduct anti-sabotage checks in the metro network. As per the standard operating procedure for dealing with any unattended bag or item in the metro premises, the BDS team is called whenever any such article is found.

It was formerly a prominent pastoral estate known as Newnham Estate. It was added to the Australian Commonwealth Heritage List on 22 June 2004.  History  The earliest record of European ownership of the land which became the Newnham Estate was in 1822 when Martin Mowbray Stephenson took up a grant of 500 acres on the Tamar River. A significant part of Stephenson's property later formed the Newnham Estate which was bounded by Newnham Creek, George Town Road, the River Tamar and subsequently the Launceston City Boundary. By 1825 he had erected a house, outhouses and barn overlooking a stretch of the River Tamar known as Stephenson's Bend. Lieutenant Matthew Curling Friend, of the Royal Navy was responsible for first developing the Newnham Estate. In April 1830, as master of the 'Wanstead', he arrived in Hobart Town with his wife and his brothers Daniel, Charles and George. He applied for a grant of land but left for England in May and returned in July 1832 as master of the 'Norval' with his wife and her mother. Friend's residence, which he called 'Newnham', was built in the early 1830s. A 1833 survey of the Stephenson's Bend area shows four buildings on the major grant which are within Friend's property; and an 1835 advertisement for the lease of Newnham Estate described a substantial house with an extensive series of outbuildings around a courtyard to the north-east of the house. The advertisement also refers to two cottages on the property, which presumably refers to the Riverside Cottage and the Lodge, demolished in 1979. Friend's Colonial Georgian style residence probably had four principal rooms to both floors, with a verandah to the river front (south-west) elevation. The attic floor within the roof was probably intended for further accommodation. The 1835 description refers to a domestic courtyard group of two buildings with a central well; and a farm courtyard with two sides being enclosed with extensive sheds, cow and feeding houses. Lieutenant Friend only held the property a few years, for he was probably required to relocate his residence due to his Port Officer duties. John Cameron bought Newnham Hall from Matthew Curling Friend in 1836 and lived there for about twenty years. In July 1837, John Cameron had already paid 1000 pounds to Matthew Curling Friend and had drawn up bills of exchange totalling another 2,800 pounds. Those bills of exchange were due to be honoured at regular intervals from January 1836 until the last one in 1840, giving Cameron absolute purchase of 70 acres, one rood and four perches, being part of two grants of land to Matthew Curling Friend. The 1837 sale provided for a 'right of way' to the Newnham Estate from the Launceston road to the bank of River Tamar and the Jetty on the south side of the creek at a place called Stoney Point. Three more transactions, in 1839, 1840 and 1848, completed the land dealings between Friend and Cameron. By the early 1850s, it appears that John Cameron had left Newnham and was in the process of selling his various lands to William Gardner. Gardner purchased the core seventy acre property in 1853. This comprised Newnham Hall, outbuildings, park, orchard and farm lands and allowed for 'right of way' from the Launceston road to the jetty on the River Tamar, and provided for the sale of other portions of the property. William Atkinson Gardner (1815 - 1855) had arrived in Launceston from Manchester in 1851 and purchased Newnham in 1853. He was the Vice-President of the Launceston Mechanics Institute; and the Member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council for the seat of Cornwall from March 1855 to his death, aged forty, on 22 June that year. Newnham was offered for lease, and an advertisement in The Examiner of that date described the property as a first class residence, beautifully situated, with a frontage on the River Tamar. The house contained 18 rooms with numerous outbuildings, kitchens, scullery, wine cellar, stores, and men's huts; a large tank, with force-pump; stables, loose boxes, coach houses, straw yard, stock yard, fowl and pigeon houses. There were seven acres of productive garden ground and orchard, twenty-nine acres of parkland, and forty-one acres in convenient paddocks for agriculture. The 15 ft wide verandah bounded the house on two sides. The house was fitted with a patent water closet, and a force pump, from which water was conveyed to the upper storey. There was also a large reservoir and a good well of water. The gardens were stocked with young and choice fruit trees and vegetables, and in one of them was a comfortable gardener's cottage. It seems probable that John Cameron, who had held the property for sixteen years, added the large breakfront and pediment extension to the original Colonial Georgian house and erected the north eastern building of the farm courtyard group during his occupancy. With the death of William Gardner, the entire property, now 126 acres, was put up for sale on 12 November 1855. By 1855, the Newnham Estate was one of the grandest estates in the north of Tasmania; and the Hall itself was one of the largest Colonial residences in Tasmania. The gracious 15 ft wide verandah extended symmetrically across the River front facade, and the ornamented verandah pilasters were relieved by light treillage arches which spanned between the posts. The ground floor French doors, and upper bedroom windows, were all fitted with external louvred shutters. In architectural terms, the Cameron additions to the principal (riverside front) elevation added Classical Revival detailing in the pedimented breakfront and elaborate verandah decoration. However, perhaps the most spectacular architectural feature was the internal decoration of the three principal Cameron rooms. A 1939 account by a curator from the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery, Eric Scott, described the ornate Classical Revival style of the Newnham Hall interiors. The interiors he examined comprised two large rooms (drawing room, billiard room) and entrance hall, decorated in the highly ornate Classical Style, characterized by elaborate three-division cornices, ceilings with painted, multicoloured Greek and Etruscan pattern-ornament, highly coloured woodwork. With the rooms maintaining the general appearance they must have presented about a century before Scott's account, he described the interior of this building as representing 'an historical treasure for Tasmania'. Following William Gardner's death, John Cameron regained control of Newnham Hall. On 1 July 1857, William Dawson Grubb paid 4,200 pounds to become the new owner of Newnham Hall. The purchase of the Newnham Estate by William Dawson Grubb was the final phase of private ownership of the house and much of the land; and the Grubb family became probably the best known of all the Estate's owners. William Dawson Grubb (1817-1879) had arrived in Van Diemens Land in March 1832, and then returned to England to read law. In 1842 he returned to Launceston, and was admitted as a barrister and solicitor. He undertook various business ventures, and purchased the Newnham Estate in 1857. The couple's youngest son, William Crooks Grubb, inherited the property and when he died in 1918 it was bought by Samuel Tulloch Scott, the husband of William Crooks Grubb's second child, Harley Marianne Louisa Grubb. Scott did not reside there and Newnham Hall was rented out until the State Government bought the property in 1940. The extended period of ownership by one family of the Newnham Estate was imprinted into the fabric of the property. The creation of a stud for Jersey cows and Suffolk sheep by the Newnham Sheep Stud in 1922 was paralleled by the sale of outlying sections of the original property, probably in response to the encroaching suburban development of the city of Launceston. The stud ceased operation and the tenant, H. von Steiglitz, vacated the property, probably in the early 1930s. There was considerable disquiet at this time as to the future of the property and its buildings and in 1939, Eric Scott, of the Queen Victoria Museum & Art Gallery, wrote to the state Minister for Social Services, Eric Howroyd, pointing out that if the Government acquired the property it would be a splendid opportunity to arrange for its preservation at a relatively insignificant cost. Scott emphasised the need to conserve Newnham Hall and its extraordinary decoration. In between the sale of the property to the Education Department in 1940 and the restoration of Newnham Hall in the late 1970s, all remnants of the decorations described by Mr Scott were obliterated and all the features that gave the riverside Hall rooms their character were removed. In 1946, Newnham Hall opened as Newnham Hall Hostel, housing girls from rural areas of Northern Tasmania who were attending Launceston High School. In 1948 Dr Dick Whitford, responsible for the introduction of comprehensive high school systems within Tasmania, established the experimental Newnham Community School. At the time of acquisition, the Newnham property was reduced to just over 178 acres, with a cluster of buildings around the Hall, and two small cottages, one at the Tamar River frontage (Riverside Cottage) and the other between the stables and the dairy (the Early Cottage or Lodge now demolished). By 1945, the Hall had been radically altered with extensions to the rear, in order to serve its use as a hostel for High School girls. These additions comprised lean-to extensions to the original Friend building; and the addition of a building to the southeast which was placed hard up against the Newnham Hall walls and required the demolition of the southern end of the Cameron verandah. In the early 1960s Newnham Hall was becoming engulfed by suburban development. The Tasmanian College of Advanced Education (Newnham Campus) annexed the northern section of the former Newnham property; and in 1962, the Newnham Hostel was adapted for use as part of the G. V. Brooks High School, renamed Brooks High School in 1964. In 1965 and 1966 new science laboratories and a gymnasium were built close to Newnham Hall and in 1972, a new School administration building was added. Further additions in the 1970s included additions to the north of the Hall and the removal of the early domestic courtyard buildings, the dairy and kitchen. In 1977, a proposal was put forward to annex the former Newnham Hall property as a new campus for the Australian Maritime College (AMC). This was part of a Federal Government initiative in the late 1970s to decentralize and relocate scientific and ocean based research activity to Tasmania. Other facilities established at this time were the Australian Antarctic Division at Kingston and the CSIRO Sea Fisheries Research Laboratories in Hobart. In 1978 the Newnham property was gifted to the Federal Government for use as the AMC. The extent of the transferred property was 13.25 hectares. In 1979, the adaptation of the stables and house was undertaken to allow the use of these buildings by the College. Further college buildings were constructed around the Hall and, the former Brooks High School laboratories were modified. Further modification was made to the former Newnham Hall buildings in the 1980s and 1990s; and in 1987 Joan Finlay's 'History of Newnham Hall' was published. Additional building for Australian Maritime College accommodation was undertaken around the historic building core. In 2002 the Australian Maritime College commissioned Artas Architects and Planners to prepare a Masterplan Review for the campus, including a Conservation Management Plan by Freeman Randell. The Australian Maritime College now has two campuses. The main campus, Newnham, hosts The College Administration, the Faculty of Maritime Transport and Engineering. Its second campus is home of the Faculty of Fisheries and Marine Environment is at Beauty Point, 50km north of Launceston. Description =Views= In the 19th century and early 20th century, the Newham Hall property could be seen as a discrete cultural landscape. The natural landscape had been shaped and modified by the pastoral and building activities of the Newnham property; and included the planting of hedgerows and the parcelling into paddocks of 'green fields' property; the creation of driveways, avenues and formal plantings; the defining of views from the property to the landscapes beyond; particularly to the Tamar River; and the construction of formal and functional buildings in order to service the property. Some of these cultural landscape elements still exist, in particular the relationship of the open areas in front of Newnham Hall to the Tamar River beyond and the entrance driveway. Significant views include views from the Tamar River and from the opposite shore of the Tamar River of the Newnham Hall landscape, an historic view evidenced by the painting of Stephenson's Bend; views of the Newnham Hall, Riverside Cottage and the heritage landscape of mature trees and hedgerows from the East Tamar Highway; views from Newnham Hall, the Riverside Cottage and the other heritage precincts to the Tamar River; view of the main entrance gates and driveway planting; pedestrian views along the enclosed planting of the entrance driveway; the sense of open planted areas enclosed by hedges of the home paddock, the Newnham Hall riverside garden, the orchard and the vegetable garden; views of grassed areas leading toward the Riverside Cottage, including the playing fields and hedgerows; vistas up and down the Riverside Cottage Avenue; views to and through the orchard of formally planted and productive fruit trees; views to the enclosed stableyard across open space; views inside the stableyard; views from the sides and rear of Newnham Hall into the garden and courtyard spaces. =Historic Precincts= Precinct A - Entrance Driveway It is likely that the driveway in its present form dates from the 1850s the same period as the parkland and riverside garden. In 1922, the Hall standing on some 10 acres of gardens and shrubberies, was approached by a drive from The Park, long each side of which flowering shrubs and all kinds of flowers grow in the greatest profusion. The gravel entrance driveway curves from the entrance gates in a gap between the current AMC main administration, Swanson Building (Building 1), and the Simulator Building (Building 2) down to the garden (SW) front of Newnham Hall. The drive is edged with hedges, shrubs and trees. A pair of wrought iron entrance gates sit between a modern curved face brick wall at the top of the drive. Gates of this type can date from the 1840s. The top of the drive has been eroded but on its southern side a steep slope retains the edge of the drive above the home paddock. Halfway down the drive informal tracks lead off into the paddock. On the northern side of the drive are simple lawn areas with some recent trees. Landscape features of the entrance driveway include mature large trees; box hedges; agapanthus ribbon plantings; SE Shrubbery - mature traditional shrubs; NW shrubbery - mature traditional shrubs, retaining wall, rendered brick steps. The form of the driveway has been eroded in the past by the new track which leads down to the basement of Swanson Building (Building 1); and the access to the old outdoor Towing Tank. The current boom gate at the Newnham Hall end of the drive is intrusive. The mature trees and shrubs are in reasonable condition and are well maintained. The entrance gates are in good condition. (2002) Precinct B - Home Paddock Together with Newnham Hall's riverside garden, this paddock seems to have made up the riverside portion of Friend's original 47 acre land grant. The home paddock appears to be under cultivation but with a smattering of trees in the c1830s Stephenson's Bend painting. The home paddock is clearly shown in the 1943 survey and 1945 aerial photo as a single field. In the 1970s low aerial photo it is divided into two narrow fields, one under cultivation and the other possibly used for sheep grazing. The paddock may have been used by the Newnham Community School which had an emphasis on agricultural science in its curriculum. A line of shallow cut and fill runs across the Paddock about halfway down. This could relate to a former farm road as evidenced by the old hardwood gatepost with gate hinge on the SE hedgerow of the boundary. The enclosure of this field by hedgerows has been gradually eroded. It also appears that a Hawthorn hedgerow once gave clear definition between the paddock and the entrance driveway. (2002) Precinct C - Riverside Garden In the 1840 Stephenson's Bend painting, a lawn appears in front of Friend's two-storey, three-bay Georgian villa with immature hedges at its boundaries and a scattering of trees. The boundaries of the garden are similar to those of today. A signal staff is at the bottom of the garden. After 1835 the garden underwent a fairly intensive landscape regime in the Gardenesque style, and this is likely to have occurred as a consequence of the house receiving the major riverfront addition in the 1840/50s although it may be possible that Grubb built up the more intensely planted garden following his purchase in 1857. The 1943 survey notes a garden and shrubbery in this area and the1945 aerial photo showed the upper portion of the riverside garden was still intensely planted with a variety of shrubs in a Victorian manner. By the 1978 survey, gardens and shrubberies had been replaced with lawn. Elements of the riverside garden include mature heritage plantings and garden bed at edge of Hall forecourt; hedgerows along riverside boundary flagstaff; arbour and steps. The current steel flagstaff, donated to the AMC in 1996, is on the centre-line of Newnham Hall and interprets the flagstaff in a 1840 Stephenson's Bend painting. Now mainly only the larger trees remain, however it is likely that there is some archaeological evidence of former pathways, shrubberies and garden beds. (2002) Precinct D - Orchard Elements of the orchard include remnants of the early orchard - apple and pear trees; other mature fruit and exotic trees; 1940s BBQ; Master of Residences House and Garden 1990; native hedge. The regular planting of the orchard has been eroded over the years, most notably by the construction of the Master of Residence's House in 1990. While this house and its landscaping may be considered intrusive, the house is of a simple design well screened from the Avenue and the Orchard. (2002) Precinct E - Former Vegetable Garden It is likely that a kitchen garden was established at an early date taking advantage of a northerly aspect sheltered from the south by Newnham Hall and its rear outbuildings and Stableyard. The former vegetable garden site measures about 50x50 metres or 2500 square metres. The vegetable garden was adjacent to a cistern or large reservoir filled in c1959 with the demolition of the Newnham Hall kitchen. As part of the Community School, Newnham Hall was known for growing its own vegetables and the outline of the vegetable garden on the 1978 survey probably dates from that period. Elements of the vegetable garden site include a NE Hawthorn Hedgerow; lawn; Newnham Hall road access. There is no above ground evidence of the vegetable garden but the associated Hawthorn hedge to the NE is in good condition. (2002) Precinct F - Riverside Cottage Avenue This roadway originally led down to the riverside and possibly on to the Jetty (demolished) established by Captain Friend. The remnants of the existing plantings probably date to the 1840/50s. Elements of the Riverside Cottage Avenue include the Hawthorn hedge and trees; large deciduous (elms, oak) and Eucalyptus trees and stumps of a large trees. The avenue plantings have been severely eroded by tree removal. The Hawthorn hedges down the south east boundary of the avenue, between the avenue and the orchard, are reasonably intact. (2002) Precincts G 1 and G2 - Sports Field and Paddock to front of Building 1 From the mid 1800s until the mid 1900s Newnham Hall was situated in a typical colonial Tasmanian rural landscape, complete with views to the River and distant hills. Subsequent use of the Newnham Hall and Estate as a hostel; a school; and now as the AMC have retained open areas - the area now used as the Sports Field, the Paddock to front of Building 1. These open spaces help maintain the sense of and help interpret the rural undeveloped landscape. Elements within these open areas include Hawthorn hedges along early field boundary lines; native shrub and Eucalypt plantings; a 1998 memorial garden for a Japanese student including a sundial and cherry tree plantings partly on the adjacent University of Adelaide land, a mature (1880s) Radiata pine on the highway embankment, deciduous trees and communal gardens in the courtyards near the stableyards. The Sports Field is well maintained with remnant hedgerow plantings defining the early field boundaries. Remnant plantings including a significant eucalypt remain in the paddock to the front of Building 1. (2002) Precinct H - Newnham Hall and Outbuildings The Hall has undergone four principal periods of change. The initial period when the Friend 1835 two storey Georgian house with four principal rooms on each floor was commenced. The verandah with convex striped roof to riverfront, separate kitchen and other outbuildings to the rear probably date from this period. The second period, c1840/50s, was when two-storey riverfront wing with grand Victorian interior decoration was constructed. At some stage a patent water closet was attached to the upper floor. The Stableyard and extensive landscaping also date from this period. There appears to have been little structural change to the house prior to the third period, the creation of the Newnham Hostel for Girls in 1946. The building probably stood empty from 1939 to 1946 during which time its condition, and that of the outbuildings, severely deteriorated. The Hostel period was marked by unsympathetic changes to the Hall including the demolition of the kitchen and the outbuilding on the other side of the rear kitchen courtyard, together with the kitchen courtyard walls. The adaptation for a hostel included numerous rear timber additions. The fourth period involved adaptation for use by AMC from 1979 including extensive conservation works as recommended in the Howroyd and Forward Conservation Reports of 1977. This period includes the 1986 adaptive works such as the creation of the three upper floor flats each complete with kitchen, bathroom and laundry facilities and continuing efforts to solve rising damp and structural movement issues. The Newnham Hall residence and symmetrical stables and yard behind are the historical centre piece of the Newnham Park and property generally. Nineteenth century illustrations suggest a picturesque composition of a grand residence within a park like setting. Newnham Hall is a two-storied stuccoed brick Georgian house with hipped roof, projecting eaves and pedimented gable-end in the main facade. It also has a single storey verandah on two sides and a lower two storey wing on its eastern side. Upper level windows are twelve pane double hung. At the lower level are French doors with transom lights. Other elements of Newnham Hall precinct include the Riverfront Forecourt; Planting Bed; Wisteria Hedge; Magnolia Tree; Peach Tree; Driveway; Courtyard Planting; Former Kitchen Wing Archaeological Site; Outbuilding Archaeological Site. Newnham Hall is generally in sound structural condition. There are ongoing wall cracking problems which are a maintenance issue rather than a real structural threat. All the internal ground flooring was replaced as part of the 1979 adaptation and conservation works and a gravel topped surrounding agricultural drain was created around the perimeter of the building at this time with the exception of the concrete verandah. In 1984 damp and associated damage to wall finishes was a problem with the building and the subject of a report by Peter Spratt and Associates. The building has all modern services including fire detection, security services and ducted air conditioning and disabled access to the ground floor areas. (2002) Precinct I - The Stableyard The Stableyard dates from the second period of development of the Newnham Estate 1840s-50s. In 1855, Newnham Hall Stableyard was described the outbuildings as built of brick, and comprise a 12-stall stable, coach and gig houses, harness room, three kitchens, servant's rooms, large store with plenty of dry cellarage. The buildings are brick Georgian style utilitarian buildings and face a U-shaped courtyard. The main Stable building (two- storied) has the date 1847 inscribed in a stone plaque in the gable end in the center of its principal facade. The two single storey wings are likely to be older than this, probably 1834-1847. These wings were definitely extensions to the now demolished kitchen wing buildings which were immediately adjacent to the rear of Newnham Hall. The Stableyard complex was adapted for AMC use 1980 at which time various works were carried out including walls with new openings constructed to open shed areas; new windows inserted in existing walls; and new colonnades added down each of the single storey wings. In the following decade covered ways were attached to the outside of the complex to giving all weather external access between the Stableyard and adjacent modern AMC Buildings. Roofs are plain galvanised steel; walls are a combination of face brick and roughcast. The Ponrabbel engine, located to the SE of the main Stableyard building, is one of two steam engines from the Ponrabbel 2 dredge which cleared the River Tamar for about 40 years from the 1920s. The dredge went out of service in 1975. The Stableyard was in a fairly bad state of repair when the AMC inherited the site in 1977. The Stableyard complex was adapted for AMC use 1980 at which time various works to walls and windows were carried out and colonnades and covered ways added. Use by the AMC ensures heritage fabric is conserved with little demand for further change. (2002) Precinct J - Riverside (Gardener's) Cottage Although various buildings and a jetty are shown on an 1833 survey, the Riverside Cottage is not shown. The 1835 advertisement mentions a gardener's lodge and a boat house and wharf. It is possible the 1835 gardener's lodge is the cottage which was demolished. The Riverside Cottage is more than likely to be derived from a pattern book of farm buildings, built at the same time as the two-storey rear wing to the front of Newnham Hall (1840/50s). Such 'pattern book' outbuildings from the 1840/50s occur at many estates in Northern Tasmania such as Woolmers (RR 012791), Entally (RR 012960) and Clarendon (RR 012752). This cottage appears on the 1943 survey including the rear wing but with no outbuildings. The 1945 aerial photograph shows a tall thick hedge to the southeast. Elements of the Riverside Cottage include a picket fence, front and side gardens, rear and courtyard gardens; cypress hedge, large trees, shrubs and hedges, hedgerow remnants. The Riverside Cottage Avenue road now leads straight into the rear yard of the cottage although it once continued on past the cottage down to the Tamar River and the Jetty. The rear yard has hedges and tall trees. The front garden of the cottage originally extended down to the survey boundary/hedge line represented by the remnant hedge plantings. The cottage was once quite conspicuous from the river and also had fine river views. The original three- roomed cottage has a service wing. A narrow verandah appears to have run down the NE elevation of the cottage. In 1983 an extension was added which created a U-shaped courtyard facing NW. The cottage is in reasonably sound condition. There are ongoing problems with wall cracking a few damp problems. The cottage has all modern services including fire detection and ducted air conditioning. (2002) Precinct K - Farm Shed Archaeological Site A woolshed which appears on the 1943 survey may have existed in this precinct from the mid 19th century. A 1922 ' Illustrated Tasmanian Mail' article describes a new and up- to date milking shed as being erected, and the latest milk cooling devices being installed. This shed was erected to meet the needs of the newly formed Newnham Stud Company which was to specialise in Jersey cows. In the 1943 survey and the 1945 aerial photo both the Wool Shed and a Milking Shed are shown. The milking shed and woolshed are separated by a Hawthorn Hedge along the respective paddock boundaries. A silo is also shown to the NE of the Milking Shed. By 1978, the shearing shed had been demolished and a fibro fowl house erected. The Milking Shed had also been modified and adapted as a shearing shed. These works were carried out by the Newnham Community School which had agricultural activities as part of its core curriculum. Today only the Milking Shed remains although in a much modified form as the Groundsman's Shed (Building 12). The area where the woolshed (and later a Fowl House) existed is now covered by Maritime Way and the bitumen carpark and associated landscaping behind Building 8. Only the left hand single storey section of the Groundsman's Shed is reminiscent of the 1922 milking shed. The large Oak and Eucalypt trees may be remnants of the mid 19th century park planting and landscape. The remaining former milking shed fabric has the potential to yield information about agricultural technology from c1922 to c1977. There is the possibility of significant archaeological remains of the former woolshed (c1850), and fowl house (c1945) and of fences, hedges and other agricultural features connected with the above farm buildings. The Former Milking Shed has been altered and has lost much of its significance. This precinct generally has research potential because of the information that can be gained from an analysis of the remaining former milking shed fabric about agricultural technology from 1922 to 1977. The precinct also has archaeological remains of the former woolshed ( 1850), and fowl house ( 1945), fences, hedges and other agricultural features connected with the above farm buildings. (2002) =Demolished Elements= The Newnham Hall Park Like many estates, Newnham Hall had a park, where livestock could graze in the shade of evergreen trees, adjacent to the main homestead area. In Australia such parks helped to create a British Arcadian aesthetic. The Riverside Cottage served as a lodge for arrivals by the Tamar River and it is possible this was the principal means of arrival into the late 1800s. The Newnham Hall Park probably dated from the 1840/50s along with the curved driveway and the intensely planted Riverside Garden. There are currently no remnants of the Park extant but a few of the driveway trees remain lining the main entrance to the University from Invermay Road (previously the George Town Road). The Early Cottage or Lodge This cottage was probably one of the first buildings on the Newnham Estate and could have been the home that Captain Friend and family lived in from 1832 while awaiting completion of the first section of the grander Newnham Hall in 1836. A 1977 drawing shows a traditional four room cottage with its principal (NW) elevation facing the drive down to the riverside. This orientation suggests that it was an early cottage addressing the road up from the jetty on the Tamar River. The building was demolished to make way for future development, probably in 1979 during works to convert the stableyard complex. Building 8 (Survival Centre) now stands on the site of the cottage. The Newnham Hall Jetty The 1833 survey showed the location of a jetty. The exact position of the jetty is not known, however a jetty certainly existed from an early date as the river was Friend's primary means of travel between Newnham and Launceston and George Town, Friend being Port Officer at both places at one time. Reference is made to a boat house and jetty in the 1835 advertisement. Heritage listing The Newnham Estate, now the Australian Maritime College (AMC), Newnham Campus, Launceston, demonstrates significant phases of the evolution of European settlement in Launceston, Tasmania and Australia. The Newnham Estate demonstrates the evolution of a large rural estate in Northern Tasmania, from its establishment on the banks of the Tamar River close to Launceston in the 1830s, through a period of prosperity and improvement in the 1840s and 50s, to modernisation and diversification of agricultural practices in the early 1920s. Significant development and cultural phases of the area and the estate include over 100 years of continuous pastoral settlement and development from 1822, use as a Government institutional residence, Newnham Hall Hostel from 1945, the Newnham Community School and the Brooks High School from 1948 to the 1970s and the Australian Maritime College from 1979 to the present. Newnham Hall, the Stableyards, the Riverside Cottage, the alignment of paddock plantings, the orchard and the vegetable garden, roads such as the Riverside Cottage Avenue and the entrance driveway, significant trees and plantings and the unoccupied agricultural spaces are significant as heritage precincts and historic elements within a cultural landscape. The AMC is significant for its association with the expansion and development of the city of Launceston and for the adaptive re-use of a pastoral estate as government residential and educational institutions. The gradual diminution of the Newnham property, from its peak area of 1200 acres, to its current AMC curtilage is demonstrative both of densification and settlement pressures from the nearby city of Launceston; and of the need for civic and educational institutions to be closely linked to urban centres. The agricultural use of the estate continued alongside the reduction in size of the property and the use of the buildings for government institutions. The AMC, Newnham Campus, is significant as the main one of two campuses of the national institution established to train and educate people for the Australian maritime industries. The establishment of AMC was part of a Federal Government initiative to relocate scientific and ocean based research activities to Tasmania in the late 1970s. Newnham Hall, together with the Stableyard, Riverside Cottage and remnant landscape features are good representative examples of elements of a mid Victorian agricultural estate in Northern Tasmania. The Hall, in its original Colonial Georgian form (Friend period) is one of a significant group of two-storied Georgian residences in Tasmania. The extraordinarily rich architectural decoration of the Newnham Hall (Cameron period), although altered, is a rare and uncommon aspect of Tasmania's Colonial architecture heritage. The Newnham Hall Stableyard is an example of compact complex of utilitarian outbuildings immediately adjacent to the Hall and is notable for its symmetry along an axis aligned with Newnham Hall. The Stableyard is an important element of Newnham Estate as a substantial mid nineteenth century agricultural complex. The Riverside Cottage is a good representative example of a 1850 'pattern book' picturesque building designed and sited to enhance the romantic qualities of the substantial mid nineteenth century pastoral estate. The adaptation of the core of the Newnham Estate for educational purposes from 1945 until the present is of significance, including the evolving heritage conservation methods of the late 1970s and early 1980s that recognised, and sought to enhance, the heritage values of the property. The Riverside Garden layout, remnant built landscape features, the orchard and vegetable garden, the working courtyards and associated demolished buildings adjacent to Newnham Hall and the form of larger farm structures such as the wool shed may yield important information about nineteenth and early twentieth century rural estate agricultural practices, cultural material and social conditions. Beyond the immediate precinct, the site of the Newnham Hall Jetty on the Tamar River which dated from the 1830s also has archaeological potential. The Newnham Estate, in particular the placement of Newnham Hall and the Riverside Cottage and Riverside Cottage Avenue, and the alignment of boundaries and plantings, are visually linked to the Tamar River. The pastoral landscape, views and open spaces, are of enduring value and aesthetic significance. The proportions and siting of the Newnham Hall reflect the original intention that the estate be viewed and approached from the Tamar River. Other significant views from Newnham Hall and adjacent areas extend over a landfall to the Tamar River and to the landscape beyond. Internal views within and between historical elements of the Newnham Estate are aesthetically significant and reinforce the spatial relationships between architectural and landscape elements. The heritage precincts of Newnham Hall demonstrate the aesthetic and technical improvements made to a colonial estate in the 1840s and 50s including the construction of the riverside front to the Hall complete with a rich interior decoration to the principal rooms; the sweeping entrance driveway; the landscaped gardens; the provision of a compact but picturesque Riverside Cottage and The Early Cottage or Lodge (demolished); and the functionally designed stableyard and associated yards and equipment designed on the central axis of the Hall. The location of the Newnham Estate and in particular, Newnham Hall and the associated Tamar River vistas demonstrate the social standing of the occupants. The complex of farm buildings and residences, both extant and removed including the Park and the Newnham Jetty, demonstrate the scale of the agricultural activities and the cultural achievements and aspirations of the owners. The Newnham Hall complex has long been appreciated by the Launceston community as a site with cultural heritage values. This is demonstrated by the late 1930s efforts by the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery for its preservation and recording; community interest in the major heritage conservation program of the 1970s and 80s; and in the continued community interest in its history and preservation. As an educational institution the Estate is significant for its associations with the Newnham Hostel for girls attending Launceston High School; the Newnham Community School; the Brooks High School; the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education; and now the Australian Maritime College. The Newnham Estate has special associations with a number of historical Tasmanian identities including Lt. Matthew Curling Friend, Port Officer and Harbour Master for Launceston and George Town who commenced the first major structures on the site (1832-36); John Cameron, entrepreneur, who probably built the riverside front addition; and William Grubb, a notable northern Tasmanian industrialist and member of the Tasmanian Legislative Council (1869-79), who resided at Newnham Hall from 1857 to his death in 1879. The Newnham Estate was important for the promotion of the use of Jersey cattle and Suffolk sheep in Tasmania by Mr Tulloch Smith and Peter Keam, who formed the Newnham Stud Company in 1922.

Early life Stevens was born on June 22, 1825 in North Andover, Massachusetts to Isaac Stevens and Hannah Stevens (n√©e Cummings). He was a member of one of North Andover's founding families. His older brother, Isaac Stevens, was the first Governor of Washington Territory and a Union Army General who was killed during the battle of Battle of Chantilly. Stevens grew up on the family farm, which supplied dairy to be sold in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Stevens prepared for college at the North Yarmouth Academy and graduated from Bowdoin College in 1848. He studied law at Harvard Law School and in the office of H. H. Fuller. He was admitted to the bar in 1850. Personal life Stevens moved to Boston in 1850, but continued to utilize his family home in North Andover as a summer home. Stevens was a Unitarian and attended the church of Edward Everett Hale. In 1854 he married a cousin, Catherine Stevens of Andover, Massachusetts. They had no children. On September 2, 1895, Stevens and his wife were severely injured when they were ejected from their carriage. Stevens fractured several of his ribs and Catherine Stevens broke two bones in her right leg and suffered injuries to her hip and chest. Political career =Early involvement= Stevens served on the Boston common council in 1856 and 1857 and was president of the body in 1856. Stevens was a delegate to the 1860 Democratic National Conventions in Charleston and Baltimore, where he supported the candidacy of Stephen A. Douglas. After the first convention, sixteen members of the Massachusetts delegation, including Caleb Cushing, Benjamin Butler, James Scollay Whitney, and George B. Loring, broke with the party and participated in the ‚ÄúBreckinridge convention\\". At the Baltimore convention, Stevens served as the spokesman for the Massachusetts delegation, which supported the eventual nominee - Stephen A. Douglas. District attorney In 1874, Stevens was elected District Attorney of Suffolk County. In 1876 he tried Thomas W. Piper, also known as The Boston Belfry Murderer, for the murder of Mabel H. Young. The trial ended in a hung jury, with nine voting to convict and three voting to acquit. Piper was later tried and convicted by Massachusetts Attorney General Charles R. Train. On March 1, 1882, Stevens, under instruction from Massachusetts attorney general George Marston, wrote to James R. Osgood & Co. informing them that their 1881 printing of Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass violated the law against obscene literature and requesting that they withdraw it from circulation. On March 23, Osgood & Co. wrote to Whitman that if two poems - \\"A Woman Waits for Me\\" and \\"Ode to a Common Prostitute\\", were removed, the government would allow the book to be published. Whitman rejected this request and Osgood & Co., not wanting to get involved with a lawsuit, ceased publishing the book and turned over the plates to Whitman. Rees, Welsh, & Co. (which was soon acquired by David McKay Publications) of Philadelphia agreed to publish the Leaves of Grass and the controversy surrounding the book made it a financial success. By January of 1905, Stevens was unable to do much work due to rheumatism. He spent the entire summer at his farm in North Andover. On July 31, 1905, Stevens resigned effective the confirmation of his successor. On August 2, Stevens' first assistant Michael J. Sughrue was appointed by Governor William Lewis Douglas and immediately confirmed by the Massachusetts Governor's Council. Stevens died on August 23, 1905 at his home in North Andover.

He is best known for editing the New Zealand Listener (1998‚Äì2003). Macdonald was appointed New Zealand Editor: Politics, Business & Arts of the online media site The Conversation in April 2020. He lives in Auckland with his partner, media executive Carol Hirschfeld. They have two children, Will and Rosa. His father was the late journalist Iain Macdonald.  Career  Macdonald began his career as a junior reporter for the NZ Listener, later becoming a senior writer, before leaving to pursue a freelance career, during which time he researched and wrote television documentaries and was for two years a regular scriptwriter for TVNZ‚Äôs long-running drama series Shortland Street. From 1996‚Äì1997 Macdonald was a senior writer for Metro magazine, before returning to the Listener as deputy editor under then-editor Paul Little. When Little left, Macdonald was appointed editor, and hired Steve Braunias from Metro as deputy editor. Macdonald has said that highlights of editing the Listener included driving its coverage of the 9/11 terror attacks and New Zealand‚Äôs response to the subsequent \\"War on Terror\\", and launching the magazine‚Äôs first website. Notable writers he commissioned to contribute to the Listener included C.K Stead (an obituary of New Zealand writer Janet Frame), Michael King, Alexander Cockburn and Christopher Hitchens (on the death of Princess Diana). Between 2004‚Äì2006 he was a commissioning editor for Penguin Books New Zealand. During this time, Macdonald encouraged former New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange to write his memoir, David Lange: My Life. The book‚Äôs publication coincided with the death of Lange in 2006, and remains a best-seller. From 2006‚Äì2010 Macdonald wrote a weekly column for the Sunday Star-Times (which he has compared to writing a Listener editorial); and was also the paper's literary editor. More recently he has written for North & South magazine, The Spinoff, Radio New Zealand and Newsroom. In 2013 he authored The Life and Art of Lynley Dodd an illustrated retrospective of the New Zealand children‚Äôs author‚Äôs work. From 2015‚Äì2017 he was the New Zealand publisher for HarperCollins where he specialised in non-fiction works, including New Zealand musician Dave McArtney‚Äôs memoir Gutter Black, Flying Nun Records founder Roger Shepherd‚Äôs memoir In Love With These Times, and the celebrated New Zealand writer James McNeish‚Äôs final book, Breaking Ranks. Macdonald has worked as a documentary producer/reporter or presenter for television series The Good Word (TVNZ 7); Talk Talk (TVNZ 7); NewsBites (Maori Television Service) and The Book Show (TVNZ).

As most other types of museums its purpose is to educate the visitor, in this case, in the history of the cemetery and/or the people interred in it. It does this by raising public interest of the cemetery, exposing the role it may have played at some point in history, and by promoting the history behind it. They are generally cemeteries that have become tourist attractions. Given their nature, cemetery museums fall under the broader category of open air museums.  Purpose and settings  Park-like setting at Lychakiv Cemetery in Ukraine Some cemetery museums, like the Ohlsdorf Cemetery museum were founded to promote historical and contemporary funeral culture, while others, like the San Pedro Cemetery Museum, were created as a space to erect funerary monuments in memory of prominent figures in the history of a country, region, or human endeavor, such as politics, arts, science or the humanities. Some cemetery museums, like the Tikhvin Cemetery museum, were envisaged primarily as a landscaped park, while others, like Pante√≥n Nacional Rom√°n Baldorioty de Castro have achieved the status of an urban pantheon on their own right.Fundaci√≥n Puertorrique√±a de las Humanidades.

Such museums specialize in the display of artifacts and memorabilia related to archaeological excavations in tombs. Some cemetery museums, like the Museum of Roman Antiquities have experienced the opposite fate and become the central location for cemetery artifacts from other site, even from non cemetery or cemetery museums. Still other cemetery museums are known for the uniqueness of their tombs. For example, the Merry Cemetery has gained notoriety for the colorfulness of the tombs that make it up.

Rome He was awarded second prize in the Prix de Rome of 1783 for his \\"Parable of the Prodigal Son\\". However, after he went to Rome, he was unable to enter the Academy of France due to lack of space. It was not until 1785 that he was given room and board, courtesy of his relative, the engraver Charles-Nicolas Cochin, who exerted his influence to get him in. At the time, this was kept secret. For some unknown reason, his lodgings were searched during the affair involving Count Cagliostro.Count Cagliostro by Photiades @ Google Books. He left Rome shortly thereafter, in 1790. While there, he sent home only one painting; \\"Tobias Giving Sight to His Father\\" (1788). Return to France Upon returning to France, he exhibited the \\"Marriage of Ruth and Boaz\\" in 1791. He was appointed director of the Gobelins Manufactory in 1793. As one of his first acts, he gathered together tapestries that contained Royal coats-of-arms and other symbols of the Monarchy and burned them at the , in what he considered to be a show of support for the Revolution. He was also able to negotiate and come to terms with the workers at the Manufactory who had gone on strike to protest being paid in assignats. When the position of Director was abolished, he resumed painting; specializing in subjects from antiquity. In 1806, he became Chief Inspector at the Manufactory, succeeding his father, who had held the position since 1755.

Biography  Born on 26 March 1974 in Madrid, he earned a Licentiate degree in Law at the Complutense University of Madrid (UCM). He led the Madrid regional organization of the Communist Youth in the 1990s, where he met Pablo Iglesias Turri√≥n. In 2010 he headed a list to the 8th Congress of the Communist Party of Madrid (PCM), but Daniel √Ålvarez Morcillo, a Madrid municipal councillor adept to the orthodox line represented by √Ångel P√©rez, became the new Secretary-General of the PCM, with Mayoral retreating and ultimately calling for endorsement to Mauricio Valiente. He has worked as lawyer for Ecuadorian neighbour associations against evictions, with Mayoral later becoming a member of the Madrid branch of the Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH), a grassroots anti-eviction movement. He joined Podemos in the Spring of 2014, along Irene Montero, both active members in the PAH. In November 2014, following the results of the Podemos' Citizen Assembly S√≠ Se Puede, Mayoral became a member of the state-wide \\"Citizen Council\\", the top body overseeing the party between the celebration of assemblies (congresses).

In the game, when Yuri was younger, her family all died in a traffic accident, leaving her the only survivor. As a result of this accident, she was left with the ability to see ghosts, often referred to as the \\"Sixth Sense\\" in the series.  Development  The main cast went through a number of revisions, although a male character was decided upon early on. Yuri was created relatively quickly and also the character's clothing was designed to make them look \\"sexy\\" when it got wet.Èõ∂„ÄúÊø°È¥â„ÉéÂ∑´Â•≥„Äú„Ç≥„É≥„Éó„É™„Éº„Éà„Ç¨„Ç§„Éâ [Zero: The Raven-haired Shrine Maiden Complete Guide] (in Japanese). Koei. 29 November 2014. .Famitsu Weekly (in Japanese). Enterbrain (1347): 92‚Äì93. 25 September 2014. The character was a combination of elements from proposals for games in the fatal frame series. A mechanic being tested in the game had the necessity to keep dry, initially inspired by the sweating mechanic from Dead or Alive 5. While this was toned down, dampness being tied to the character's well-being remained in the game. This aspect was suggested by Ohtani. The graphics engine used technology from Dead or Alive 5, with one of the main points of aesthetic similarity was the sexy look of the female character.  Appearances  = In Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water = Yuri appears in a Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water as a playable character. as, In the first chapter, Hisoka and Yuri go to Mikomori Onsen to search for a photo album Ren Hojo is interested in, and Hisoka instructs Yuri on how to use the Camera Obscura and her shadow reading to find the album. They retrieve the photo album, but on their way out of the house, Yuri is attacked by a ghost and has to fend it off with the camera. Hisoka apologizes for bringing Yuri with her on the mission. = In other media = Yuri also became the basis of a DLC costume in the Nintendo Switch version of the 2017 game Nights of Azure 2 and reappeared as a summonable Assist Trophy in the 2018 game Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, where Yuri uses a camera and stunning the opponents with a camera and poisoning them. =Gameplay= Yuri has a special power that allows her to see people spirits who have been \\"spirited away\\" that reveals disturbing sights in her surroundings as well as bring them back as a normal being. Previewing from the original Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, She navigate environments using an interactive map and can either walk or perform a sprint. During exploration, the characters are confronted by hostile ghosts that attack and damage them through touch. If a ghost grabs her, she can either dodge or break free from their grip. The only means of defense and attack for her is the Camera Obscura, an antique camera that is used from a first-person perspective. The camera is controlled using the Wii U Gamepad, with shots of varying proximity and angles affecting how much damage the ghost takes. The most damaging is a \\"fatal frame\\", which hits a ghost's weak spot. During combat, after a shot is taken, fragments of a ghost will appear around them. Aside from the Camera Obscura, other factors are present in the play. Yuri can glimpse pieces of a ghost's past upon defeating them or when they launch a special attack. Characters can also concentrate on items in the environment related to missing people, generating a shade that leads them to the person's location. A wetness meter tracks how damp the character gets when navigating environments. The amount of wetness has positive and negative effects on her being wet increases the damage done by the Camera Obscura while increasing the number of ghosts present in an area and attacks causing more damage. In addition, characters can be inflicted with a status ailment from dark-colored ghosts or from a special attack: this ailment decreases vision and defense, and deteriorating health. The ailment is only lifted by defeating all the enemies in the area or using an item to remove all wetness.  Reception  Since appearing in Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, Yuri has received mixed to negative reception. GameSpots Alexa Ray Corriae was unimpressed by the main character that was yet being underdeveloped. Daniel Krupa of IGN praised the character roles for being balanced out. Ryan Bates of Game Revolution, found out that the character was introduced early as confusing. VideoGamer.com's Tom Orry praised the character while feeling that Yuri's revealing outfits clashed with the game's atmosphere. Famitsu also criticized the attire of Yuri for disrupting the atmosphere. Dengeki and Eurogamer's Aoife Wilson both faulted the character of Yuri in comparison to the previous game. Dengeki noted the character's realistic movement and said that it gave the main character a high quality feel. The character was widely criticised as she became too erotic instead of being scary at the game. Multiple reviewers mentioned and generally faulted the stiff controls and character movement. The Western release included Nintendo-themed costumes based on popular characters Princess Zelda and Samus Aran. These costumes replaced lingerie and swimsuit outfits featured in the Japanese release for Yuri.

In this fortress was born the last great character Dadiani, David, on January 26, 1813. The fort was originally built during the period of the Kingdom of Abkhazia (Egrisi-Abkhazia) in the 8th century AD. Later it was reconstructed in the 12th century AD and significantly restored in the 16th or 17th century AD. In 1905, during the revolution, Adelkhanov forces invaded Jihaskari, Chakvinji, and their adjacent villages. In the days of struggle for the establishment of Soviet power in Georgia, the forces Mensheviks occupied Jihaskari fortress, from where there was a counterattack by the local population. The Mensheviks were expelled by the Bolsheviks. According to archaeological studies conducted in the fortress, Chakvini had a citadel, towers, and a church along with other structures.

Betts was fatally shot by responding police officers 32 seconds after the first shots were fired. A total of 27 individuals were taken to area hospitals. A search of the shooter's home found evidence that showed an interest in violence and mass shootings and that he had expressed a desire to commit one. Despite describing himself as a leftist and voicing his support for antifa, a preliminary assessment did not indicate that Betts had a racial or political motive. The attack occurred just 13 hours after a mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. Shooting Two hours before the shooting, the gunman was seen entering a bar with his sibling and a friend in the downtown Oregon Historic District of Dayton. At about 12:13 a.m., he split from the two and was recorded leaving the bar. At 1:05 a.m., eyewitnesses reported that a man opened fire at the entrance of Ned Peppers Bar in the Oregon Historic District. He was carrying a firearm that included part of a semi-automatic Anderson Manufacturing AM-15 (based on the AR-15) in a pistol configuration with a shortened barrel, chambered in .223 caliber ammunition and equipped with a 100-round drum magazine. He fired 41 rounds into the crowd in less than 30 seconds, fatally shooting nine people and injuring 17 others. An additional ten people were injured by other causes, bringing the total number of injured to 27. According to Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl, 20 seconds after the shooting began, law enforcement officers were already on the scene and engaged with the gunman. Within 32 seconds after the first shots were fired, the gunman was shot dead. An autopsy report released on December 6, 2019, showed that Betts was hit with 30 rounds. Local police evacuated many nearby night venues, and warned Dayton residents to stay away from the Oregon Historic District. Victims Vigil for the victims, August 5, 2019 Miami Valley Hospital received 16 victims from the shooting, of which five were admitted, with one in critical condition. Kettering Health Network, comprising nine hospitals in the area, received nine victims, with three in serious condition and three in fair condition. By 10:00 a.m. on the same day, 15 of 27 hospitalized people had been discharged. Police reported that all the fatalities occurred outside the bar on East 5th Street, and that the shooter's 22-year-old sibling was among those killed.  Investigators are trying to determine if the gunman intentionally or accidentally killed his sibling, who was among the first victims. The nine dead include five males and four females, six black and three white. Four of the dead were in their 20s, four more were in their 30s, and one was 57. Two of the victims who died were also shot by police. An autopsy showed that a woman who was shot by Betts was already bleeding from a fatal gunshot wound when she was struck by two bullets which were fired by police. Had she not been suffering from fatal injuries, one of the bullets which were fired by police would not have been lethal. The second victim was shot by Betts multiple times and sustained a superficial gunshot wound from police. As a result of those findings, Montgomery County Coroner Dr. Kent Harshbarger ruled that the deaths were caused by Betts and were not the result of police gunfire. Perpetrator Soon after the attack, police identified the gunman as Connor Stephen Betts, a 24-year-old who lived in Bellbrook, Ohio.  According to police, he had minor traffic offenses on his record. Betts made online references about Satan and described himself as a leftist and antifa sympathizer. In the hours before he opened fire in Dayton, he \\"liked\\" a post in favor of gun control, and several concerning the El Paso shooting, including a tweet that called the El Paso shooter a \\"terrorist\\" and a \\"white supremacist\\". On August 10, ABC News quoted officials as stating that the gunman had misogynist views which were much more extreme than his political views. Betts was also known to have been in support of presidential candidates Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Two former high school classmates said Betts was suspended from Bellbrook High School after he made lists of other students he wanted to kill and rape. The \\"hit list\\" was discovered in early 2012 and resulted in a police investigation. He was previously bullied and had planned to shoot up the school, a classmate said. Over the past year, the gunman had performed live vocals for a pornogrind band called Menstrual Munchies, a genre which Vice News described as a \\"misogynistic, male-dominated\\" music scene, and BuzzFeed described as focused on gore, violence, and necrophilia, and known for its dark, satirical themes of sexual violence delivered for shock value. His high school girlfriend said he complained of visual and auditory hallucinations and psychosis, and was afraid of developing schizophrenia. Investigation On August 4, police and the FBI searched the shooter's home and found evidence that showed an interest in violence and mass shootings and that he had expressed a desire to commit a mass shooting. A preliminary assessment did not indicate the shooter had a racial or political motive. , police investigators stated that the investigation is ongoing and that they are not prepared to speculate about motivation. On August 5, Dayton Police Chief Richard Biehl stated that: \\"We have a lot of evidence still to go through ... based on where we're at now, we are not seeing any indication of race being a motive.\\" Investigators are divided and have not determined whether he shot his sibling deliberately. A federal law enforcement official said that they were looking at whether the suspect was associated with incel groups. The suspect had additional ammunition magazines with him, and was wearing body armor, a mask and hearing protection during the attack. He ordered the firearm used in the shooting online from Texas, and the firearm was transferred to a local firearms dealer in Ohio, where he picked it up. The firearm used was \\"modified in essence to function like a rifle\\", according to the Dayton Police; photos released by the Dayton Police show an AR-15 style firearm with a pistol brace. On August 15, the Montgomery County Coroner announced that Betts had cocaine, alcohol, and Xanax in his system; and he also had a vape pen and a baggie containing cocaine in one of his pockets. Aftermath Bullet holes in a window a day after the shooting Members of the Southwest Ohio Critical Incident Stress Management Team met with police who had responded to the scene to help them process the situation. The team includes mental health professionals, police officers, firefighters, medics, and chaplains. The local blood bank asked for more donations following the shooting, and various companies promoted donation drives. Local leaders and community members held a vigil on East 5th Street on August 4, where ten doves were released, one each for each dead victim and one for the injured. Reactions =Domestic= Note left at the entrance of Ned Peppers Bar the day after the shooting Following the shooting, Ned Peppers Bar posted a message on Instagram reading: \\"All of our staff is safe and our hearts go out to everyone involved as we gather information.\\" Trump delivers statement on August 5, 2019. President Donald Trump tweeted, \\"God bless the people of El Paso Texas. God bless the people of Dayton, Ohio.\\" In a later statement, he ordered that, following both shootings, all public U.S. flags be flown at half-staff until sunset on August 8. Regarding mass shootings, he said, \\"We have done much more than most administrations. We've actually done a lot. But perhaps more has to be done.\\" Mayor Nan Whaley thanked the officers for a quick response, saying that it certainly prevented more deaths. She also spoke of how hard the day would be for the city and the families affected. Ohio Senator Rob Portman and Governor Mike DeWine offered their condolences. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat representing Ohio, said \\"Thoughts and prayers are not enough. We must act.\\" He urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, to start a United States Senate session on August 5 to \\"vote on gun-safety laws\\". Senate Minority Leader, Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, made a similar call to action. He referenced H.R.8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2019 that had passed the United States House of Representatives earlier in February, saying the Senate should also pass this. Representative Ted Lieu, a Democrat, asserted that McConnell was \\"blocking\\" the bipartisan proposal on \\"common sense gun safety legislation\\" from being voted on in the Senate. Ohio House of Representatives member Candice Keller posted an essay on her personal Facebook page, blaming the shooting on several factors including recreational marijuana and the breakdown of the traditional family (due to causes including transgender rights). Her statement was criticized by Cincinnati City Council member Chris Seelbach, Butler County Sheriff Richard K. Jones, and Ohio Republican Party chairwoman Jane Timken (who called on her to resign). Following the El Paso shooting, which occurred 13 hours prior, multiple Democratic 2020 presidential election candidates called for political action to eliminate gun violence in the United States; they included Cory Booker, Pete Buttigieg, Tim Ryan, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Andrew Yang. Trump visited El Paso and Dayton on August 7. In Dayton, he spoke to hospitalized victims, medical staff, and first responders. The White House published photos and videos of his trip, some of which showed him posing, smiling, and giving thumbs up gestures with his hosts. He told reporters, \\"We had an amazing day. The love, the respect for the office of the presidency I wish you could have been in there to see it.\\" =International= The incident was mentioned by Pope Francis during a speech in St. Peter's Square on August 4, in which he condemned attacks on defenseless people and said he was spiritually close to the victims and the families affected by the attacks that had \\"bloodied Texas, California, and Ohio\\". In response to the shooting, the Consulate General of Japan in Detroit issued a notice stating that no Asians had been injured and that \\"Japanese residents should be aware of the potential for gunfire incidents everywhere in the United States, a gun society, and continue to pay close attention to safety measures.\\" At least two other nations ‚Äì Uruguay and Venezuela ‚Äî issued similar travel warnings, with Uruguay's foreign ministry issuing a statement warning its citizens traveling in the U.S. \\"to take precautions against growing indiscriminate violence, mostly for hate crimes, including racism and discrimination\\", and Venezuela cautioning its citizens to postpone travel to the U.S. or to take precautions \\"given the proliferation of acts of violence and crimes of indiscriminate hatred\\".

Early life and education Czado grew up in a family with five children in Borken, Hesse, a small town in central Germany. She earned a diploma in 1984 from the University of G√∂ttingen, specializing in probability and statistics. Inspired by a high school fascination with Native American culture, Czado enrolled in an master's-level exchange program between University of G√∂ttingen and Cornell University. At Cornell, she worked with Murad Taqqu in their department of operations research and industrial engineering. Returning to G√∂ttingen, she completed her master's degree in 1987, with a thesis on the law of the iterated logarithm for self-similar processes. Czado continued to work with Taqqu, and joined the doctoral program in operations research and industrial engineering at Cornell. However, while she was there, Taqqu moved to Boston University. Frustrated with her progress on the law of the iterated logarithm, Czado took advantage of the opportunity to change topics under another advisor. Instead of moving with Taqqu, she remained at Cornell and began working on binary regression using computer simulations. She completed her doctorate at Cornell in 1989. Her dissertation, Link Misspecification and Data Selected Transformations in Binary Regression Models, was supervised by Thomas J. Santner. Career After postdoctoral research at McGill University, Czado became a faculty member in the department of mathematics and statistics at York University, Canada, in 1989. In part, she chose Canada over returning to Germany because the German habilitation system would have required more years of effort before she could obtain a permanent position. After receiving tenure at York in 1994, she went on sabbatical to Germany and began searching for a faculty position in statistics in Germany. In 1998 she took her present position at the Technical University of Munich. Books Czado is the author of the textbooks Mathematische Statistik (with Thorsten Schmidt, Springer, 2011) and Analyzing Dependent Data with Vine Copulas: A Practical Guide With R (Springer, 2019).

The church has a three-bay nave, a prominently protruding apse, and a richly adorned narthex added in the early 13th century. The Sioni church is a functioning Georgian Orthodox church, renovated in 2009, and protected by the state as an Immovable Cultural Monument of National Significance.  History  Following a medieval Georgian tradition of naming churches after particular places in the Holy Land, the Dmanisi cathedral bears the name of Mount Zion at Jerusalem. The church is dated to the 6th‚Äì7th century by the scholars such Giorgi Chubinashvili, Levan Muskhelishvili, and Vakhtang Beridze, but the traditional dating has recently been revised by the specialists such as E. Arjevanidze to the 9th century. It served as the seat of homonymous episcopal see until the diocese had to be dissolved . The see was reinstated in August 2003. According to the medieval Georgian chronicles, Dmanisi served as a burial ground to King Vakhtang III of Georgia, who died in 1308; the tomb have not survived. Later, both the church and its yard were used as a necropolis by the noble family of Baratashvili and their offshoot, the Orbeliani, from the 16th century into the 18th.  Architecture  Dmanisi Sioni. A prominently protruding apse on the east. Dmanisi Sioni. The narthex with Georgian inscriptions above the entrance. The church has been described, following the definition by Chubinashvili, as a \\"three-church\\" basilica, that is, a peculiar Georgian design in which the nave is completely separated from the aisles with solid walls, in order to create what are almost three independent churches. Arjevanidze identifies the building as a hall church with a mono-pitched roof. The church, without later additions and narthex, measures 23 √ó 11.5 m. It is build of lines of small grayish stones, sometimes regularly hewn blocks, and is roofed with flat stone tiles. As the building has been reconstructed in the course of history, only the middle nave retains its original architectural form. It terminates in a protruding semicircular apse on the east and exaggerated engaged pilasters in the interior of the building create arched bays in between. The inner walls were once fully frescoed; the badly damaged 13th‚Äì14th-century depictions of the Mandylion, saints and inscriptions survive in the altar apse; fragments of a royal portrait and two scenes of the Doomsday are visible in the northeastern and northwester pilasters, respectively. A small flagstone in the south wall of the altar bears a carving in relief, depicting two laymen standing en face, with a pedestalled cross in between them. Two side annexes, on the south and north, respectively, are 9th‚Äì10th-century structures, containing a sacristy and prothesis, both with apses. Sometime between 1213 and 1222, in the reign of George IV of Georgia, a narthex was added on the western end of the basilica. The narthex is richly adorned with ornamental stone-carvings in relief and covered with a vault, supported by four pillars and arches; its all three facades, columns, and arches are faced with light green smoothly hewn stone slabs. To the north of the church stands a rectangular bell-tower, remodeled several times. Farther, to the northeast, there is small single-nave church of Saint Marina, rebuilt in 1702 by Isakhar, a caregiver for Princess Mariam of Kartli. The narthex bears three inscriptions in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script. One, on the western facade, makes mention of King George IV and Bishop Theodosius, a ktetor. Another, also on the western facade, mentions George IV's son David VII and relates that the bishop of Dmanisi abolished a local law that required a payment for the wedding rite. The third inscription, in the inner southeastern column, commemorates the certain Apridon, who had donated 30 to the construction.

She is known for her work on the religious history and literature of northern India from the 16th century. Life Monika Boehm-Tettelbach studied ethnology, Indology, Hittite and Avestan at the Free University of Berlin between 1960‚Äì66. She received her doctoral degree with a thesis on Sadani, a dialect of the Bhojpuri language spoken in Bihar. She worked at the Free University until 1969, and then at the Heidelberg University's Indological seminar till 1973. For her habilitation, she presented work on Sadani folk song traditions. In 1976, she was visiting faculty at Stockholm University; from 1985‚Äì1986, she worked at the Institute of Oriental Languages of the Australian National University. In 1989, she obtained a professorship at the University of Cologne, before returning to Heidelberg in 1990, where she became Dean of the Faculty of Language and Literary Studies. She was the head of the Department of Contemporary South Asian Studies at Heidelberg until her retirement in 2006. She established Indological Institutes at the University of Bamberg and the University of Cologne. She was awarded the Landeslehrpreis des Landes Baden-W√ºrttemberg f√ºr das Sprachprogramm des S√ºdasien-Instituts by the German government in 2004. She was elected an honorary fellow of The Sanskrit College and University in Kolkata in 1992. In 2017, she was elected an International Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Research Boehm-Tettelbach's linguistic work on the Sadani language was published under the name Jordan- Horstmann. Her researches into Dadu Dayal and his sect, and her translations of his songs were published under Thiel-Horstmann, while her investigations of the Jaipur royals appeared under Horstmann. =Linguistics= Jordan- Horstmann's monograph on Sadani, a Bhojpuri dialect, was published in 1969, a translation of her 1966 doctoral thesis. She documented the state of flux of the language, where speakers were often using Hindi words in place of Sadani. However, her structural description of the language itself in non-technical terms, and the awkward use of morphophonemes, as well as analytical errors, were criticised. =Religion= Jordan-Horstmann published works on Bhojpuri folk songs in 1975, followed by studies on their Christian versions. Her focus shifted to the bhakti religious and social traditions of north India. She wrote on sant groups as well as Sikh, Krishna and Rama devotional rites. She investigated archives in Rajasthan, establishing a typology for difficult-to- read documents, and combined these researches with fieldwork and sociological study. As Thiel-Horstmann, her translation of Dadu Dayal's poetry was published in 1991. Dadu was an itinerant bhakti saint. Thiel-Horstmann prepared a collection of 443 pada hymns, and established how they were created via the common cultural background of the author and audience. Dadu, she showed, shared his inspiration with earlier saints of the Panchvani as well as Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh faith. The songs were drew on the western Indian tradition of dhol songs, and were similar to the lyrical formulas of Mirabai. These were multilingual creations and widely distributed by his followers. =Politics= Horstmann's monograph on Pratap Singh, a monarch of Jaipur, appeared in 2013. She showed how religious rites legitimated regnal power in Rajasthan as in other parts of India and Nepal. Despite the monarchy being hereditary, Pratap Singh's dynasty, the Kachwahas, required constant confirmation from other clans and religious notables. The arrival of the Pushtimarg sect led to its preeminence in the royal court and clashes with the Jain community, possibly for economic reasons. She showed the continuity of court rituals down to the 21st century and the enthronement of Padmanabh Singh in 2011. Despite the abolition of royal titles in India in 1970, the investiture demonstrated the reinforcement of ancient politico-religious rites to present a type of stability. The monograph was appreciated for its extensive archival research and careful philological analysis.

Description Psittacanthus cucullaris is a hemiparasite. The young stems grow upright, while adult stems are pendulous. In cross-section the young stems are ellipsoidal to circular and about 0.5‚Äì1 cm in diameter and 6‚Äì8 cm long, while adult branches have a circular cross-section which is up to 2 cm in diameter. The opposite and decurrent leaves are leathery and 15‚Äì20 cm long by 5‚Äì7 cm wide. They are falcate or ovate with an acute base and an acute or rounded apex. The petiole is 0.5 cm long with 3-5 obvious major ribs. Terminal and lateral racemose inflorescences occur at the apex of the branches. The greenish or red ovate flower bracts are persistent and 2.2 cm long by 1.8 cm wide. The flowers occur in sessile triads, with a main and secondary peduncle of the inflorescence which is 1‚Äì2 cm long. There is a pink or red dome beneath the flower which covers the calyx and base of the flower. The flower buds are 4.5-5.0 cm long, and straight with an acute apex. The petals are red, orange or yellow at the base and yellow or greenish at the apex. There are two forms of stamens. The anthers are 2.5-3.0 mm long and brown and the straight stylus is 4.0-4.5 cm long. The fruits are ovoid and 10‚Äì15 mm long by 9‚Äì12 mm wide, and are green when immature and black or purple when ripe and their base is encircled by the pink, orange or red subfloral dome. The seeds are 7‚Äì12 mm long by 5‚Äì7 mm wide and have 3-4 cotyledons. It is easily recognized by the spiky leaves, the terminal and axillary inflorescences at the apex of the branches, the bracts that subtend the triads with sessile flowers, the revolute subfloral domes that surround the caliculum and the base of the flowers, which persist in the fruit. Habitat In Brazil, it grows in the Amazon rainforest, the Central Brazilian savanna, and the Pantanal. Taxonomy Psittacanthus cucullaris was first described by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in 1792 as Loranthus cucullaris, and in 1834, George Don assigned it to the new genus Psittacanthus. Etymology Psittacanthus comes from the Greek psittakos (parrot), and the Greek anthos (flower), chosen according to Don, possibly because of the bright colours. The species epithet, cucullaris, comes from the Latin, cucullus (\\"covering\\", \\"hood\\"), and the adjective, cucullaris, refers to the bracts which \\"cover\\" (hood) the inflorescence and the fruit, so both flower and fruit are \\"hooded\\".Lewis, C.T. & Short, C.

This is in sharp contrast to 1950 when local television brought the then 16 Major League clubs a total net income of $2.3 million. Changes baseball underwent during this time, such as expansion franchises and increasing the schedule from 154 games to 162, led to a wider audience for network and local television. From 1972 to 1975 NBC televised Monday games under a contract worth $72 million. In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to 15 straight. On September 1, 1975, NBC's last Monday Night Baseball game, in which the Montr√©al Expos beat the host Philadelphia Phillies 6‚Äì5. In the aftermath of the thrilling 1975 World Series, attendance figures, television contracts (this time including two networks, NBC and now ABC), and player salaries all soared. In the eyes of some, that particular World Series restored baseball as America's national pastime (ahead of football). Year-by-year breakdown =1970= In 1970, NBC televised the second games of both League Championship Series on a regional basis. Some markets received the NLCS at 1:00 pm. Eastern Time along with a 4:00 p.m. football game, while other markets got the ALCS at 4:00 p.m. along with a 1:00 p.m. football game. =1971= In 1971, Sandy Koufax signed a ten-year contract with NBC for $1 million to serve as a broadcaster on the Saturday Game of the Week. Koufax never felt comfortable being in front of the camera, and quit before the 1973 season. Also in 1971, Game 1 of the ALCS was rained out on Saturday, October 2. NBC did not televise the rescheduled Game 1 the following day (the network had only planned an NLCS telecast that day), but added a telecast of Game 2 on Monday, October 4 (which had been a scheduled travel day). On October 13, 1971, the World Series held a night game for the very first time. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn, who felt that baseball could attract a larger audience by featuring a prime time telecast (as opposed to a mid-afternoon broadcast, occurring when most fans either worked or attended school), pitched the idea to NBC. An estimated 61 million people watched Game 4 on NBC; television ratings for a World Series game during the daytime hours would not have approached such a record number. =1972= In 1972, NBC began televising prime time regular-season games on Mondays, under a four-year contract worth $72 million. In the early years of the League Championship Series, NBC typically televised a doubleheader on Saturday, a single game on Sunday (because of football coverage). At the time, the network covered the weekday games with a 1¬Ω-hour overlap, joining the second game in progress when the first one ended (unless a rain delay caused the second game to start after the first game ended, as was the case during the 1972 NLCS, when the Pirates- Reds Game 5 was delayed long enough that by the time that the A's-Tigers ALCS Game 4 was over, NBC could join the game in time for the first pitch.). NBC usually swapped announcer crews after Game 2. NBC did not air Game 2 of the 1972 NLCS or the 1974 NLCS. =1973= In 1973, NBC extended the Monday night telecasts (with a local blackout) to 15 consecutive games. =1974= During NBC's telecast of the Monday night Dodgers‚ÄìBraves game on April 8, 1974, in which Hank Aaron hit his record-breaking 715th career home run, Kubek criticized Commissioner Bowie Kuhn on-air for failing to be in attendance at Fulton County Stadium in Atlanta on that historic night; Kuhn argued that he had a prior engagement that he could not break. =1975= Starting in 1975, Joe Garagiola and Curt Gowdy alternated as the Saturday Game of Week play-by- play announcers with Tony Kubek doing color analysis. Then on weeks in which NBC had Monday Night Baseball, Gowdy and Garagiola worked together. One would call play-by-play for 4¬Ω innings, the other would handle color analysis. Then in the bottom of the 5th inning, their roles switched. Ultimately, in November 1975, Chrysler forced NBC to totally remove Curt Gowdy from NBC's top baseball team. Instead, the company wanted their spokesman, Joe Garagiola, to call all \\"A\\" regular season games, All-Star Games (when NBC had them), the top League Championship Series (when NBC had it), and the World Series (when NBC had it). NBC hoped that, in replacing Curt Gowdy, Joe Garagiola's charm and unorthodox dwelling on the personal would stop the decade-long ratings dive for the Game of the Week. Instead, the ratings bobbed from 6.7 (1977) via 7.5 (1978) to 6.3 (1981‚Äì82). \\"Saturday had a constituency, but it didn't swell\\" said NBC Sports executive producer Scotty Connal. Some believed that millions missed Dizzy Dean while local-team television broadcasters split the audience. Scotty Connal believed that the team of Joe Garagiola and Tony Kubek were \\"A great example of black and white\\". Connal added by saying \\"A pitcher throws badly to third, Joe says, 'The third baseman's fault.' Tony: 'The pitcher's'.\\" Media critic Gary Deeb termed theirs \\"the finest baseball commentary ever carried on network TV.\\" Another factor behind Gowdy's dismissal was the criticism from the national media which alleged that he sided with the Boston Red Sox (a franchise that he had covered prior to his days at NBC) on a controversial play in the 10th inning of Game 3 of the 1975 World Series. Cincinnati Reds pitcher Ed Armbrister reached base on what was ruled an error by Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk on Armbrister's bunt attempt. Gowdy said numerous times that, in his opinion, Armbrister had interfered with Fisk. Gowdy had been given the correct interpretation by NBC Radio Producer Jay Scott (who was a Triple-A fill-in umpire at the time as well), but did not use it.Powers, Jim, \\"Mt Broadcaster Had Role in Gowdy Fall\\" Montana Sportsfan Magazine, Billings MT Umpire Larry Barnett claimed he had received death threats on account of Gowdy's criticism. More to the point, Tony Kubek, on the NBC telecast, immediately charged that Armbrister interfered (with the attempted forceout), even though home plate umpire Barnett did not agree. Later, Kubek got 1,000 letters dubbing him a Boston stooge. Prior to Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, NBC did a feature on replays narrated by Bob Costas. One of the plays cited by Costas was the Armbrister play, and Barnett and Costas both insisted that Barnett had made the correct call, although Barnett declared, \\"You won't find many people in Boston who believe it was the right call.\\" Costas used the feature to condemn the suggested notion of instant replay to settle calls, noting that it was the \\"same kind of mentality that adds color to classic movies and calls it progress.\\" While Gowdy was on hand in the press box for Carlton Fisk's legendary home run in Game 6 of the 1975 World Series, the actual calls went to two of Gowdy's Red Sox successors, Dick Stockton on television and Ned Martin on radio. Gowdy was Martin's color commentator on that home run. Meanwhile, according to the NBC cameraman Lou Gerard located above the third base stands, cameramen at the time were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. Instead Gerard was distracted by a rat nearby, thus he lost track of the baseball and instead decided to capture the image of Fisk \\"magically\\" waving the ball fair. NBC's last Monday Night Baseball game aired on September 1, 1975, in which the Montr√©al Expos beat the Philadelphia Phillies, 6‚Äì5. Curt Gowdy called the games with Tony Kubek from 1972 to 1974, being joined in the 1973 and 1974 seasons by various guest commentators from both within and outside of the baseball world (among them Dizzy Dean, Joe DiMaggio, Satchel Paige, Bobby Riggs, Dave DeBusschere, Howard Cosell, Mel Allen, Danny Kaye and Willie Mays). Jim Simpson and Maury Wills called the secondary backup games. Joe Garagiola hosted the pre-game show, The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola, and teamed with Gowdy to call the games in 1975. Except for Game 1 in both League Championship Series, all games in 1975 were regionally televised. Game 3 of both League Championship Series were aired in prime time, the first time such an occurrence happened. =1976= Under the initial agreement with ABC, NBC and Major League Baseball (running through the 1976 to 1979 seasons), both networks paid $92.8 million for the league broadcast rights. ABC paid $12.5 million per year to show 16 Monday night games in 1976, 18 in the next three years, plus half the postseason (the League Championship Series in even-numbered years and World Series in odd- numbered years). NBC paid $10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday Games of the Week and the other half of the postseason (the League Championship Series in odd-numbered years and World Series in even-numbered years). Major League Baseball media director John Lazarus said of the new arrangement between NBC and ABC \\"Ratings couldn't get more from one network so we approached another.\\" NBC's Joe Garagiola was not very fond of the new broadcasting arrangement at first saying \\"I wished they hadn't got half the package. Still, 'Game', half of the postseason ‚Äì we got lots left.\\" By 1980, income from television broadcasts accounted for a record 30% of the game's $500 million in revenues. In 1976, ABC picked up the television rights for Monday Night Baseball games from NBC. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \\"dead travel days\\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement as the national telecasts didn't compete against their stadium box offices. ABC on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated. ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with far too many games between sub .500 clubs from small markets. Reviewing the network's first two weeks of coverage for Sports Illustrated, William Leggett opined: \\"It may be unfair to say that Monday Night Baseball, as it has been presented by ABC so far this season, is the worst television treatment ever given a major sport, because by all odds somebody at sometime must have done something worse. But it is difficult to remember when or where that might have happened.\\" Just like with Monday Night Football, ABC brought in the concept of the three-man-booth (originally with Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts. Said ABC Sports head Roone Arledge \\"It'll take something different for it to work - i.e. curb viewership yawns and lulls with Uecker as the real difference\\", so Arledge reportedly hoped. Prince disclosed to his broadcasting partner Jim Woods about his early worries about calling a network series for the first time. Prince for one, didn't have as much creative control over the broadcasts on ABC as he did calling Pittsburgh Pirates games on KDKA radio. On the June 7, 1976 edition of Monday Night Baseball, Prince returned to Three Rivers Stadium, from which he had been exiled for over a year. Although Prince received a warm reception, he was confused when the next day the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette read: \\"Ratings are low, negative reviews rampant.\\" June 28, 1976, the Detroit Tigers faced the New York Yankees on Monday Night Baseball, with 47,855 attending at Tiger Stadium and a national television audience, Tigers pitcher Mark \\"The Bird\\" Fidrych talked to the ball and groomed the mound, as the Tigers won, 5‚Äì1 in a game that lasted only 1 hour and 51 minutes. After the game, the crowd would not leave the park until Fidrych came out of the dugout to tip his cap. For ABC's coverage of the 1976 All-Star Game, the team of Bob Prince, Bob Uecker and Warner Wolf alternated roles for the broadcast. For the first three innings, Prince did play-by-play with Wolf on color commentary and Uecker doing field interviews. For the middle innings, Uecker worked play-by-play with Prince on color and Wolf doing the interviews. For the final three innings, Wolf worked play-by-play with Uecker on color and Prince doing interviews. Bob Prince was gone by the fall of 1976, with Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell, and guest analyst Reggie Jackson calling that year's American League Championship Series. (Warner Wolf, Al Michaels and guest analyst Tom Seaver worked the NLCS.) On the subject of his dismissal from ABC, Bob Prince said \\"I hated Houston, and ABC never let me be Bob Prince.\\" MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn strongly objected to ABC's recruitment of Howard Cosell because of comments by Cosell in recent years about how dull baseball had become. But Roone Arledge held the trump card as the contract he had signed with Major League Baseball gave ABC the final say over announcers. So Cosell worked the 1976 ALCS and became a regular member of Monday Night Baseball the next season. Keith Jackson was unavailable to call Game 1 of the 1976 ALCS because he had just gotten finished calling an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC. Thus, Bob Uecker filled-in for Jackson for Game 1. Uecker also took part in the postgame interviews for Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS, while Warner Wolf did an interview of George Brett in the Kansas City locker room. =1977= On July 7, 1977, WMC 5 in Memphis, Tennessee aired a local Memphis wrestling program featuring Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler instead of NBC's baseball telecast between the Detroit Tigers and Milwaukee Brewers. On June 18, 1977, in the New York Yankees' 10‚Äì4 loss to the Boston Red Sox in a nationally televised game at Fenway Park in Boston, Jim Rice, a powerful hitter but a slow runner, hit a ball into right field that Reggie Jackson seemed to get to without much speed, and Rice reached second base. Furious, Yankees manager Billy Martin removed Jackson from the game without even waiting for the end of the inning, sending Paul Blair out to replace him. When Jackson arrived at the dugout, Martin yelled that Jackson had shown him up. The two men argued, and Jackson said that Martin's heavy drinking had impaired his judgment. Despite Jackson being eighteen years younger, about two inches taller and maybe 40 pounds heavier, Martin lunged at him, and had to be restrained by coaches Yogi Berra and Elston Howard. Red Sox fans could see this in the dugout and began cheering wildly; NBC television cameras showed the confrontation to the entire country. Still on the disabled list toward the end of the 1977 season, Mark Fidrych worked as a guest color analyst on a Monday Night Baseball telecast for ABC; he was subsequently criticized for his lack of preparation, as when play-by-play partner Al Michaels tried talking with him about Philadelphia Phillies player Richie Hebner and Fidrych responded, \\"Who's Richie Hebner?\\" As an American League player, Fidrych had never had to face Hebner, who played in the National League. The 1977 World Series marked the first time that the participating teams' local announcers were not featured as booth announcers on the network telecast of a World Series. 1977 was also the first year in which one announcer (in this case, ABC's Keith Jackson) provided all of the play-by-play for a World Series telecast. In previous years, the play-by-play announcers and color commentators had alternated roles during each game. Meanwhile, Yankees announcer Bill White and Dodgers announcer Ross Porter alternated between pregame/postgame duties on ABC and calling the games for CBS Radio. White worked the ABC telecasts for the games in New York (including the clubhouse trophy presentation ceremony after Game 6) while Porter did likewise for the games in Los Angeles. =1978= In 1978, Baseball Hall of Famer Don Drysdale joined ABC Sports with assignments such as Monday Night Baseball, Superstars, and Wide World of Sports. In , Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation. According to Drysdale \\"My thing is to talk about inside things. Keith [Jackson] does play-by-play. Howard's [Cosell] role is anything since anything can happen in broadcasting.\\" When ABC released and then rehired him in 1981, Drysdale explained it by saying \\"If there is nothing to say, be quiet.\\" Ultimately, Drysdale seemed to be slowly phased out of the ABC picture as fellow Hall of Fame pitcher Jim Palmer was considered ABC's new poster child \\"[of] superior looks and...popularity from underwear commercials.\\" By 1989, Palmer would earn $350,000 from ABC for appearing on around ten regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances. For a national television audience, the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game (New York Yankees/Boston Red Sox) aired on ABC with Keith Jackson and Don Drysdale on the call. Meanwhile, the game aired locally in New York City on WPIX and on WSBK in Boston. Phil Rizzuto, Frank Messer and Bill White called the game on WPIX while Dick Stockton and Ken Harrelson called the game on WSBK. Also in 1978, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and then, flew to New York, arriving just in time to call Game 4 of the ALCS that same night (October 7). =1979= In 1979, 22 teams (all but the Atlanta Braves, Houston Astros, New York Mets, and St. Louis Cardinals) participated in a one-year cable deal with United Artists Television and Columbia Pictures Television, then-owners of the USA Network. The deal involved the airing of a Thursday night Game of the Week in markets at least 50 miles (80 km) from a major league park. The deal earned Major League Baseball less than $500,000, but led to a new two-year contract for 40‚Äì45 games per season. The program ran through the 1983 season. With USA's Thursday night coverage, it ended ABC's Monday night broadcast's position as the exclusive national, prime time television franchise for Major League Baseball. The start of ABC's Monday Night Baseball coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing Sunday Afternoon Baseball games in September. The network also aired one Friday night game (Yankees at Angels) on July 13 of that year. On August 6, 1979 the entire Yankee team attended team captain/catcher Thurman Munson's funeral in Canton, Ohio. Teammates Lou Piniella and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson's best friends, gave eulogies. That night (before a national viewing audience on ABC's Monday Night Baseball) the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 5‚Äì4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and a two-run single in the bottom of the ninth.

Lady Knollys and Countess of Banbury Greys Court was built by her husband's father, Francis Knollys (the elder). On 23 December 1605 she married Sir William Knollys, who became Viscount Wallingford, and in 1627 Earl of Banbury. Elizabeth was said to be ambitious for her husband's promotion to viscount, so that she could have precedence over Elizabeth Pierrepont, wife of Thomas Erskine, Viscount Fenton.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 35. On 27 April 1613 she and her husband entertained Anne of Denmark at Caversham Park. A description of the entertainment written by Thomas Campion was printed in 1613. The queen was met by a Cynic dressed as a wildman who debated with a Traveller. These two rode to the park gate and were met by two of Robin Hood's men, who sang for the queen. The entertainment continued in the hall of the house after dinner and concluded with masque dancing. The masque actors included four of Elizabeth Knollys's brothers; Lord Walden, Sir Thomas, Master Henry, and Sir Charles.John Nichols, The progresses, processions, and magnificent festivities, of King James the First, his royal consort, family, and court, vol. 2 (London, 1828), pp. 629-39.

In December 1618 it was noted that \\"my Lady of Wallingford\\" was one of the first to sing a verse libel against her sister Countess of Salisbury, and another \\"cross-libel\\" was current, criticising her faction.Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 6. In January 1619 King James told William Knollys that he was unfit for public office, despite his long service with Queen Elizabeth, because he had \\"one fault common to him with diverse others of his friends and fellows, which could not stand with his service or the state, that he was altogether guided and overruled by an arch- wife\\".Norman Egbert McClure, Letters of John Chamberlain, vol. 2 (Philadelphia, 1939), p. 206. In June 1623 she travelled to The Hague to see Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia, with Isabella Smythe, Philadelphia Carey Lady Wharton, Lady Hatton and her daughter Lady Purbeck. Dudley Carleton thought she was an unsuitable guest for her (Catholic) religion and other circumstances. They sent a comic letter to Carleton, in the spirit of a masque, explaining their arrival deposited on the shore by Neptune, in hope of an introduction to the King and Queen of Bohemia.Mary Anne Everett Green, Calendar State Papers Domestic James: 1619-1623 (London, 1858), p. 596: Mary Anne Everett Green, Elizabeth of Bohemia (London, 1909), pp. 217-8: Samuel Richardson, The Negotiations of Sir Thomas Roe, vol. 1 (London, 1740), p. 169. William Knollys, Earl of Banbury died on 25 May 1632 and was buried at Rotherfield Greys near their home at Greys Court. She married Edward Vaux, 4th Baron Vaux of Harrowden in June 1632. Vaux was said to have wanted to marry her in 1605. He was found to be a recusant in 1606 and his aunt Anne Vaux was arrested in connection with the Gunpowder Plot. He was a probably a cousin of Elizabeth Roper, later Lady Mansell, a maid of honour in Anne of Denmark's household. In 1641 she had a licence to travel with her son Nicholas. She died on 17 April 1658 and was buried at Dorking, Surrey.

It is located west of the village of Gudarekhi, Tetritsqaro Municipality, in the Kvemo Kartli region. The monastery complex consists of the main hall church, a free-standing bell-tower, and ruins of various structures such as a palace, cells, chapels, wine-cellar, and stables. The church is adorned with medieval stone-carvings and inscriptions. The complex is inscribed on the list of Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  History  A wall inscription on the southern facade. Published by E. Taqaishvili, 1904. The Gudarekhi monastery was built in the 13th century, apparently on the site of an earlier church structure. North of it are the ruins of a medieval settlement, where archaeological digs revealed fragments of locally produced pottery and medieval coins, 18 Georgian and one Mongol. The more exact dating of the extant church depends on the interpretation of a commemorative inscription on the southern wall, which mentions \\"Queen of Queens Rusudan\\". Earlier historians such as Dimitri Bakradze and Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset saw in this queen Rusudan, daughter of Demetrius I of Georgia (died c. 1210), but Ekvtime Taqaishvili's identification with Rusudan of Georgia (reigned 1223‚Äì1245) gained more traction. More recently, Gurand Mchedlidze illustrated that this Rusudan could have been a daughter of King Demetrius II of Georgia and the construction of the church could have been started no earlier than 1282. The Gudarekhi monastery continued to function under royal patronage. King Simon I, in a charter of 1 January 1586, donated the monastery to the cathedral of Dmanisi. On 24 August 1643, King Rostom, himself a Muslim, granted the monastery to the princely family of Germanozishvili, a branch of the great house of Baratashvili. The monastery owned estates and serfs in nearby villages and served as a familial abbey and burial ground for the Germanozishvili. By 1756, both the princely family and the monastery had gone in significant decline; constant warfare and political instability depopulated the Gudarekhi area and the wider Kvemo Kartli region. The village was deserted, the monastery was abandoned and its environs were reclaimed by nature until being rediscovered by the 19th-century students of Georgian antiquities. The church was repaired through a government-funded program in 2006.  Architecture  Stone carvings on the eastern facade of the main church. Remains of the frescoes in the main church. The Gudarekhi monastery is perched on a wooded hill, west of the eponymous village. The complex is enclosed by a ruined wall, within which most of the structures are located. The main church, of the Theotokos, is a hall church design, measuring 16.2 √ó 9.5 m without annexes, and built of smoothly hewn yellowish stone blocks. It ends in a semicircular apse to the east and has the only entrance to the south. The eastern facade is adorned with decorative stone-carvings, inspired by an example of the earlier domed churches in Georgia. The southern wall, at the entrance, carries a seven-line inscription in the medieval Georgian asomtavruli script, which mentions the architect Chichaporisdze, Queen Rusudan, her children, and the bishop Anton of Manglisi. The interior is painted with the faded, partially fallen frescoes of the Archangels‚Äîaccompanied by the 17th-century Greek inscriptions identifying Michael and Gabriel‚Äîand the saints George, Demetrius, and Theodore. Inscriptions in Georgian on the altar murals are now barely legible. The surviving fragments of a 12th-century stone iconostasis have been removed for preservation at the Georgian National Museum in Tbilisi. The north end of the church is flanked by an apsed eukterion, a later annex in the north wall of which there are two stones with the 10th‚Äì12th-century Georgian inscriptions‚Äîapparently, remains of an earlier structure. Another annex, to the south, was a columnated narthex which is now in ruins. Southeast of the church is a free-standing stone bell-tower built in a rectangular plan. Completed in 1278, it is the oldest extant dated bell-tower in Georgia. It is a two-storey building, with the lower level open, the upper one being a hypostyle hall with eight arched pillars, and a small cell rested in between them. An asomtavruli inscription on the eastern wall commemorates King Demetrius II of Georgia and the priest Abraham.

Formerly a single unitary lake, it is now an expansive salt flat divided into four greater sections (Dabusun, Big/Small Bieletan, Suli, and N./S. Huoluxun) which contain a number of smaller salt lakes, the largest of which is Dabusun Lake. The area is heavily exploited for its valuable salt, mineral, and rare earth reserves but parts are also protected as a national park and contribute to regional tourism. Name Qarhan is the GNC romanization of the area's Mongolian name, originally derived from the word for \\"white\\" (Modern , tsagaan, or , ƒça…£an).. Cha'erhan is the pinyin romanization of the Mandarin pronunciation of , a modification of the original transcription into Chinese characters of the same name; it is also sometimes clipped into Charhan in English sources. The Chinese name, which does not distinguish between actual salt lakes and playas, also causes the playa to be called a \\"lake\\" or even \\"the largest salt lake in China\\" in less careful English sources. Geography The Qarhan Playa covers an area of , stretching over east to west and usually between north to south. The southwest lies in Golmud and the northeast in Dulan County, both in Haixi Prefecture, Qinghai, China. The roughly area of Qarhan inclusive of Taijinar to its west is sometimes known as the Sanhu (\\"Three Lakes\\"), after the two Taijinar lakes, Suli Lake, and Dabusun. Qarhan is part of the larger Qaidam Basin, lying between the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Altun to the west, and the Qilian to the north. Qarhan's lakes lie between above sea level, with Dabusun and North Hulsan being the lowest and Xiezuo being the highest. The effect of elevation is such that despite lying on the same latitude as Greece, Algeria, and Virginia in the United States, Qarhan has an mean annual temperature of . The mean air speed is , and the mean relative humidity is 27.7%. In the playa's hyperarid climate, there is generally only of annual rainfall but of annual evaporation. Despite this, meltwater rivers and mineral springs fill the basins of the salt flat's four main sectionsBieletan, Dabusun, Qarhan, and Huoluxunwith about ten large but shallow lakes usually collectively occupying an area of about : Suli Lake in the west, fed from the west by the Urt Moron; the Little and Big Biele Lakes beside it, fed from the south by the Tuolahai and Qingshui Rivers; West Dabusun and Dabusun Lake (the largest), in the center, fed from the south by the Golmud River; Dongling Lake to their northwest; Xiezuo and Tuanjie Lakes to their east, fed respectively by the intermittent Quanji and Shougong Rivers; and North and South Hulsan Lakes at the east end of the playa, fed from the east by the Qaidam, Nuomuhong, and Suolinguole Rivers. All of these are usually less than deep. There are also some ephemeral lakes. Most of the streams contributing to these lakes flow north into the playa from the Kunlun and its foothills. The Golmud River is the main contributor, providing a mean annual influx of 19.2 trillion L (5.07 trillion gal) of water. There is also contribution of about 1% from mineral springs, especially on the north end of the playa, which play an important role in the chemical composition of the sediment. The local flora consists of sparse forbs (particularly members of Chenopodioideae) and shrubs, especially members of Ephedra and Tamarix. Geology Most of the Qarhan Playa is solid halite underlain by a layer of brine to about under the soil,. and it holds enormous reserves of salt, with solid layers extending between . The 50 billion metric tons (55 billion short tons) are estimated sufficient to meet present world demand for 1,000 years. The area around Dabusun Lake has halite to depths of at least , although with alternating layers of mud in places. The salinity of the playa's lakes varies between 164.81‚Äì359.50 g/L (1.3‚Äì3 lb/gal); their pH values are between 5.4‚Äì7.85. Other minerals include potash, carnallite (potassium magnesium chloride), calcium chloride, magnesium, lithium, boron, iodine, and sylvite. The basin is one of China's richest sources for potassium, with an estimated of potassium oxide.. Its reserves are also important as the world's largest present-day accumulation of potassium-rich salt in the world, which helped scientists better understand the chemical and evaporation pathways involved in the creation of natural potash and disprove previous suppositions that it only formed in marine environments. The Bieletan subbasin in the west is the richest source of brine lithium in China, with an estimated reserve of of lithium chloride. The Sanhu as a whole holds 83% of the country's known lithium reserves, with some areas having concentrations of 330 ppm. History Paleoclimatologists believe that the playa's basin was created by tectonic activity during the Mesozoic. Between 770,000 and 30,000 years ago the basin constituted an enormous lake, which alternated nine times between being a fresh- and saltwater lake. Pollen studies suggest that the area of the lake bed which now underlies Dabusun was raised around in just the last 500,000 years. Tectonic activity also shifted the lake's tributaries and basins, although it remained with the present-day playa during this period. At around 30,000 years ago, this great freshwater lake spread over at least with a surface above the present levels of its successors, making it one of the largest lakes in the world. It was cut off and became saline again around 30,000 years ago and began precipitating salts about 25,000 years ago.. It has been shrinking in size by evaporation for most of that time,. eventually separating into the current separate lakes. Until the recent commercial exploitation of the salts and other minerals, the district remained largely unpopulated, as the salt deposits made it difficult for the nomads of northwestern China to use the area for their herds. National geological expeditions began investigating Qinghai in the 1950s, shortly after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. The major expedition to the Qarhan Playa was undertaken in 1955‚Äì6,. but the area's important carnallite (and thus potassium) reserves were discovered accidentally by geologists Zheng Mianping and Liu Dagang during a stroll on 2 October 1957. The next year, an exploratory well discovered the Yanhu Gas Field north of Dabusun Lake. Over the next decade, more detailed surveying and prospecting were undertaken while China continued to depend on Canadian imports for its potash. Commercial exploitation of the basin's own potash began in 1989, following the expansion of the PRC's Opening Up and Reform Policy. The opening of the Qinghai Potash Fertilizer Factory increased China's production of potassium chloride sixfold, from less than a year at Haixi and Tanggu to just under a year. As of 2010, production was over a year at the main site, with smaller operations around the playa each producing a further a year. During a 2016 inspection tour, Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping praised the importance of the factories and their workers to the entire country but emphasized the need for Qarhan's development to be environmentally responsible. As part of a national program to increase the use of electric cars, automobile companies like BYD have since moved to the area, opened factories, and signed contracts with local mining companies to exploit the area's lithium supplies. Infrastructure has been improved, including an overhaul of Golmud Airport. Tourism The fertilizer factory is now open to the public for free tours, and its parent company maintains a nearby museum covering the geology of the playa and hosting various salt sculptures. The area was designated a national mining park on 1 August 2008. Transportation Sections of the G3011 Liuge Expressway and the Qingzang Railway run over the playa's salt flats.

She was horrified by the rise of National Socialism, becoming involved both with the Confessing Church and, after 1933, with (illegal) opposition to the Hitler government. She was a particular supporter of Dietrich Bonhoeffer who became a regular guest, and whose students would frequently find a refuge at von Kleist-Retzow's Pomeranian estate. At the time of his execution Bonhoeffer was engaged to marry von Kleist-Retzow's granddaughter, with whom he was in love. Life Born near Neust√§dtel (as it was then known) in Lower Silesia, Ruth was the third of the six children born to Count Robert von Zedlitz-Tr√ºtzschler (1837-1914) by his marriage to Agnes Emilie Countess of Rohr (1840-1928). In 1881 her father was appointed President of the [regional] government in the city known at that time as Oppeln, and the family moved to Oppeln in Upper Silesia. It was here, when she was sixteen, that she first met J√ºrgen von Kleist-Retzow, a land owner and government administrator from Western Pomerania in the north. They married on Ruth's nineteenth birthday in 1886. Although they had, at that point, still only met three times, Ruth would always insist that theirs was a true love match. They set up home together at K√∂slin on the Northern coast and then quite soon relocated to nearby Belgard following von Kleist-Retzow's appointment as district governor (Landrat) of the Belgard district. Running a profitable farm on the sandy Pomeranian soil was always a challenge, and in material terms the marriage to a frequently indebted landowner and middle- ranking Prussian administrator left Ruth's quality of life disappointingly diminished, but her commitment to traditional aristocratic standards was undimmed, and she was attracted to the simple unquestioning adherence to patriarchal protestant values and obligations that she found in her husband's family. It was at Belgard that four of their five children were born. After ten years of married life at Belgard they moved again in 1896 to the von Kieckow family manor house at Kieckow which J√ºrgen had co-inherited with his siblings in 1892. As his father's oldest surviving son J√ºrgen now took on responsibility both for the manor and for the accompanying debts. The next year J√ºrgen von Kleist-Retzow booked himself a stay at a sanatorium, but while on his way he was obliged to stop off at Dresden where he died on 14 December 1897 of a kidney illness. His thirty year old widow was inconsolable. The couple's youngest daughter was just seven months old. At the urging of her father, Ruth von Kleist-Retzow decided to take on sole responsibility for the manor, and for the two villages that it contained. Two years later, concluding that she would never be able to afford to send her children to boarding schools, she moved to Stettin where she took an apartment for the family. She continued to take responsibility for the estate at Kieckow, which she visited monthly, while day-to-day administration was placed in the hands of a steward. In addition to her own children, she was joined in the Stettin apartment by two foster children, the brothers Gottfried and Herbert von Bismarck, (who were great nephews of the recently deceased ex-chancellor). Herbert later married her daughter Maria. War broke out in July 1914. With her sons conscripted into the army, and two of her three daughters married, Ruth von Kleist-Retzow moved back to Kieckow and assumed direct control of the family estate. She invited the women of the family to join her at the manor house for the duration of the war. While Ruth ran the estate, her recently acquired daughter-in-law ran the household. Ruth's eldest daughter Spes provided schooling for fifty children from the village. The middle daughter, Maria, already had small children of her own to look after. The still unmarried youngest daughter, Ruthchen kept the accounts for the household and for the estate. At the end of 1918 the war ended and Ruth's youngest daughter married into the land owning class. Her younger son, Konstantin, had trained as a pilot and then been killed in 1917 but her elder son, Hans J√ºrgen Friedrich von Kleist-Retzow III returned in one piece. He now moved with his family into the family manor house while Ruth gave up the city apartment in Stettin completely and moved into a smaller manor house at nearby Klein Kr√∂ssin. With her children now being self-supporting, money worries seem to have subsided, and she found the leisure to ponder and discuss with friends the theological, political and social questions which had hitherto been left to fester at the back of her mind. An indication of at least some of the questions that presccupied her comes from the title of the book that she publiashed in 1926: \\"Die soziale Krisis und die Verantwortung des Gutsbesitzers\\" (\\"The Social Crisis and the Responsibility of the Big Landowners\\"). Works Her book demonstrated Ruth von Kleist-Retzow's interest in the role of her own social class in the changed democratic conditions of the times. She called on landowners such as herself to acknowledge their responsibilities as \\"stewards of God\\" (\\"Haushalter Gottes\\") in the management of their estates, which should be used for the good of the people (...der Menschen). She also involve herself in the \\"Berneuchen Movement\\" (Chrisian youth circle) which took its name from the home of the Viebahn family at Berneuchchen Manor near Neudamm (Landsberg). That involved promoting a renewal if the Protestant Church to involve a holistic piety and commitment to a spiritual life. In many ways that reflected the lifestyle which she had already adopted in her daily life at Kieckow. When the so-called Berneuchener Book was published in 1926 it was signed off by 70 committed participants who shared in responsibility for its contents. 68 of the signatories were men. 2 were women: Ruth von Kleist-Retzow and the theologian Anna Paulsen. During the later 1920s Ruth von Kleist-Retzow became deeply concerned by the looming menace of National Socialism, entering into an intensive exchange of ideas with the aristocrat-lawyer Ewald von Kleist- Schmenzin whose own warning was published as \\"Der Nationalsozialismus ‚Äì eine Gefahr\\" in 1932. In 1935 she moved back from the countryside to Stettin where she rented and apartment which she converted into a \\"grandchildren's hostel\\" (\\"Enkelpension\\"), in order to facilitate and keep an eye on the school arrangements for her grandchildren: the return to the city also made it far easier to build up her contacts beyond her own immediate family circle. In Stettin she very soon came across the large group of enthusiasts around the progressive theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer who was in charge at the Evangelical Priest Training Establishment (\\"Predigerseminar\\") of the recently formed anti-Nazi \\"Confessing Church\\" (\\"Bekennende Kirche\\") at Finkenwalde, just outside the city on its south side. Von Kleist-Retzow became the intermediary between the two superficially contrasting worlds of the intellectual theologians around Bonhoeffer and the scions of the old Prussian army families, trying to perpetuate traditions of decency and honour on their landed estates in a fast changing worlds. The latter group included the family of her son, Hans J√ºrgen and her friend and neighbour, Ewald von Kleist- Schmenzin. Bonhoeffer himself spent a month working at his studies on the Klein Kr√∂ssin estate during September/October 1940 while keeping out of the way of the authorities. Over the next few years the manor became the venue for regular meetings of anti-government resistance activists, and it was in the course of those meetings that plans were drawn up for the assassination of Adolf Hitler.Maria Fris√©: Meine schlesische Familie und ich. Erinnerungen. Aufbau-Verlag, Berlin 2004, , p. 92. One of the grandchildren under the care of Ruth von Kleist-Retzow was Maria von Wedemeyer, a daughter of her own youngest child - another Ruth - through her marriage to Hans von Wedemeyer. (Hans von Wedemeyer had been killed on 22 August 1942 during the fighting in Russia.) In the course of Bonheoffer's visits to her grandmother's estate he frequently came across Maria von Wedemeyer, and in 1942 they fell in love. They became engaged to be married on 17 January 1943. The planned assassination was implemented on 20 July 1944: it damaged the dictator but failed to kill him. For Ruth von Kleist-Retzow it was followed by the grim experience of hearing that many of her friends and relations had been sentenced to death and executed. Others chose or were persuaded to choose suicide. Her son, Hans J√ºrgen, was arrested on 21 July 1944, the day following the failed assassination, by the K√∂slin Gestapo. It was the second time they had arrested him. They were unable to find persuasive evidence linking him to the conspiracy, however, and at the end of November 1944, just as he had been back in 1939, following his previous arrest. Death As the end of the war approached Ruth von Kleist-Retzow attempted to escape from the approaching Red army by joining the trek towards the west; but she failed. Ruth von Kleist- Retzow lived long enough to experience the arrival of the Soviet army in Kieckow. She was 78 when she died there on 2 October 1945.

Under the previous five-year deal with NBC (1996-2000), Fox paid $115 million while NBC only paid $80 million per year. Fox paid about $575 million overall while NBC paid about $400 million overall. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts implicitly values Fox's Saturday Game of the Week at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox's payment would've been $345 million while NBC would've paid $240 million. Before 1990, NBC had carried Major League Baseball since 1947. When asked about the new deal with Fox, Commissioner Bud Selig said, \\"We at Major League Baseball could not be happier with the result. They have been a good partner and an innovative producer of our games.\\" Neal Pilson, who served as the president of CBS Sports when the network had the exclusive television rights for Major League Baseball said of Fox's $2.5 billion deal: Some observers believed that gaining the relative ratings boost from the League Championship Series and World Series meant more to Fox than the other broadcast networks. This was because Fox had suffered the biggest prime time ratings decline among the four major networks during the 1999‚Äì2000 television season, with an average prime time audience of 8.97 million viewers, down 17% from the year before according to Nielsen Media Research. Year-by-year breakdown =2000= For a Saturday afternoon telecast of a Los Angeles Dodgers/Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field on August 26, 2000, Fox aired a special \\"Turn Back the Clock\\" broadcast to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the first televised baseball game. The broadcast started with a recreation of the television technology of 1939, with play-by- play announcer Joe Buck working alone with a single microphone, a single black-and-white camera, and no graphics; each subsequent half-inning would then see the broadcast \\"jump ahead in time\\" to a later era, showing the evolving technologies and presentation of network baseball coverage through the years. In 2000, NBC was caught in the dilemma of having to televise a first-round playoff game between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics over the first presidential debate between George W. Bush and Al Gore. NBC decided to give its local stations the option of carrying the debate or the baseball game. If an NBC affiliate decided to carry the debate, then the Pax TV affiliate in their local market could carry the game. NBC also placed a crawl at the bottom of the screen to inform viewers that they could see the debate on its sister channel MSNBC. On the other end, Fox said that it would carry baseball on the two nights when its schedule conflicted with the presidential or vice presidential debates. NBC spokeswoman Barbara Levin said \\"We have a contract with Major League Baseball. The commission was informed well in advance of their selecting the debate dates. If we didn't have the baseball conflict we would be televising it.\\" Although there has not been confirmation, anecdotal reports indicated that many NBC affiliates in swing states (such as Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania) chose to air the debate over the baseball game. This is an option that CBS affiliates did not have in 1992, when that network refused to break away from Game 4 of the American League Championship Series (which had gone into extra innings) to the first Clinton- Bush-Perot debate. Like NBC and Fox would do in 2000, CBS cited its contract with Major League Baseball. During NBC's coverage of the 2000 Division Series between the New York Yankees and Oakland Athletics, regular play-by-play announcer Bob Costas decided to take a breather after anchoring NBC's prime time coverage of the Summer Olympic Games from Sydney. In Costas' place was Atlanta Braves announcer Skip Caray, who teamed with Joe Morgan before Costas' return for the ALCS. It wasn't just Costas but all of NBC's production crews who were down in Sydney. The Olympics ended just two or three days before the MLB playoffs started that year, so the TBS crew worked the Division Series games for NBC. As previously mentioned, in September 2000, Major League Baseball signed a six-year, $2.5 billion contract with Fox to televise Saturday afternoon regular-season baseball games, the All-Star Game and coverage of the Division Series, League Championship Series and World Series. 90% of the contract's value to Fox, which was paying the league $417 million per year, came from the postseason, which not only attracted large audiences, but also provided an irreplaceable opportunity for the network to showcase its fall schedule. Under the previous five-year deal with NBC (running from 1996 to 2000), Fox paid $115 million ($575 million overall), compared to the $80 million ($400 million overall) that NBC paid. The difference between the Fox and the NBC contracts was that Fox's Saturday Game of the Week was implicitly valued at less than $90 million for five years. Before NBC officially decided to part ways with Major League Baseball (for the second time in about 12 years) on September 26, 2000, Fox's payment would have been $345 million, while NBC would have paid $240 million. NBC Sports president Ken Schanzer said regarding the loss of Major League Baseball rights for the second time since 1990: NBC Sports chairman Dick Ebersol added that it was not cost-effective for NBC to be paying out the kind of money that Major League Baseball wanted. The network was also reportedly concerned over disruptions to its regular fall prime time lineup that would result from having to broadcast the playoffs and World Series. In addition, NBC had several NASCAR races scheduled during the summer. Ebersol further added: The last Major League Baseball game that NBC has televised to date was Game 6 of the 2000 American League Championship Series, occurring on October 17, 2000. In Houston, due to the coverage of the 2000 Presidential Debate, KPRC-TV elected to carry NBC News' coverage of the debate while independent station KNWS-TV carried the ALCS game via NBC. =2001= For the 2001 season, Fox implemented a new graphics package for its MLB telecasts, which debuted on the network's NASCAR broadcasts in February of that year. The graphics package was an updated version of the design in 1999, but its score bug was revised as a top-screen banner. A simple, transparent black rectangle with a shaded area above it spanned the top of the screen from left to right, displaying the diamond graphic representing the baseball diamond, and the abbreviations of both teams in white. The scores would be shown in yellow boxes next to the team abbreviations; the center showed the inning (a triangle was placed to the left of the inning number to show which half-inning it was: pointing up to represent the top of an inning and pointing down to represent the bottom of an inning), to the right was the number of outs, right of that was the pitch count and the pitch speed (the pitch speed was in the same location as the pitch count, and the pitch speed would appear be in a yellow box); and the MLB on Fox logo was placed on the far right. This banner, along with the shaded area above it, retracted from the top of the screen whenever it appeared or was removed. For the 2000 and 2001 seasons, the Fox network's then-sister cable channel, Fox Family (later ABC Family, now Freeform) carried a weekly Major League Baseball game on Thursday nights (a game that had previously aired nationwide on Fox Sports Net from 1997 to 1999), as well as select postseason games from the Division Series. Among the noteworthy games that aired on Fox Family was the October 4, 2001 game between the San Francisco Giants and the Houston Astros, during which Barry Bonds hit his 70th home run of the season, which tied the all-time single season record that Mark McGwire had set only three years earlier (Bonds broke the record the next night). Meanwhile, the Fox Broadcasting Company's other sister cable channel FX, aired numerous Saturday night Major League Baseball contests in 2001, including Cal Ripken, Jr.'s final game at Camden Yards. FX also aired one game in the Major League Baseball postseason each year from 2001 to 2005, on the first Wednesday night of League Championship Series week when the league scheduled two games at the same time. On that night, Fox distributed one game to local affiliates with the availability of coverage being based on region, and the other game aired on the corresponding cable affiliate of FX, the main DirecTV or Dish Network channel, or an alternate channel on the satellite providers. ESPN was on hand for the Cleveland Indians' historic comeback against the Seattle Mariners on August 5, 2001. The Indians trailed 14-2 after six innings, but scored twelve runs in the final three innings before winning in the bottom of the eleventh, 15-14\\\\. The twelve-run comeback tied the Major League record for largest deficit overcome in a game. For the first year of its exclusive six-year contract (2001), Fox did a split telecast (which had not been attempted since the ill-fated \\"Baseball Network\\" arrangement existed) for the League Championship Series. This meant that two games were played simultaneously on the same night, with one game airing on the Fox network and the other on the regional Fox Sports Net cable channel (depending on market, as some markets did not have a regional sports network with a relationship to FSN). The rationale behind the split-telecast was that because of the September 11 attacks, the entire post-season schedule was delayed by a week. Because of this, two Sunday LCS games came in conflict with an Fox NFL doubleheader. Fans and sports journalists were unimpressed with the situation and MLB commissioner Bud Selig vowed that it was a one-time deal necessitated by circumstance. However, in later years, Fox used split telecasts on a few occasions to keep the playoffs \\"on schedule\\" and maximize its prime time advertising revenue, and aired the second game on FX, which has virtually nationwide distribution on cable and satellite. This ensured that Fox did not have to air an LCS game on a weekday afternoon, when many viewers are unable to watch. The 2007‚Äì2013 contract eliminated this issue, as TBS had rights to one of the League Championship Series each year. However, Fox continued to air afternoon LCS games on weekdays through the entire length of the contract. =2002= As part of its 2001 purchase of Fox Family, in addition to rights to the Thursday night game, The Walt Disney Company acquired the MLB rights that were also held by FX. Those two game packages were moved to ESPN beginning with the 2002 baseball season; however, the playoff games remained on ABC Family for one additional year due to contractual issues. A deal was reached to move those playoff games to ESPN, which produced the games for ABC Family, starting with the 2003 season. Although the games aired on networks owned by Disney, Fox kept the exclusive negotiation rights to renew the contract after the 2006 season. Fox chose not to renew its rights to the Division Series, which went to TBS as part of its new baseball contract. On June 16, 2002, Sunday Night Baseball covered a Subway Series at Shea Stadium in which Mo Vaughn hit a game winning three-run home run in the New York Mets' 3-2 win over the New York Yankees. =2003= In 2003, the Braves telecasts on TBS underwent significant changes for the first time in many years, reflecting an increase in the network's rights fee payments to Major League Baseball. In turn, national sponsors could fulfill their advertising commitments by purchasing ads on TBS, in addition to ESPN or Fox. In the process, Don Sutton and Joe Simpson assumed duties as lead commentators, while longtime play-by-play announcers Skip Caray and Pete Van Wieren had their participation on the broadcasts reduced. This was done in an attempt to combat criticism of Caray's on-air \\"home team\\" bias and to market its baseball coverage to fans of MLB teams other than the Braves. Meanwhile, the brand Braves Baseball on TBS was replaced by Major League Baseball on TBS. The move was strongly criticized by Braves fans, Atlanta area media outlets and Braves manager Bobby Cox. Over 90% of Braves fans who voted in an online poll conducted by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution preferred Caray and Van Wieren to the more neutral broadcasts. The move backfired, and ratings for the TBS broadcasts declined sharply. After that year's All-Star break, TBS brought back Caray and Van Wieren to work with the two analysts, while broadcasts reverted to the Braves Baseball on TBS brand the following year. =2004= On April 16, 2004, Fox aired a Friday night game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox to cover those teams' first head-to-head meeting since the memorable 2003 ALCS. Scooter debuted in the 2004 baseball season on April 16, during a game between the New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox. While Fox Sports television chairman David Hill called Scooter \\"really cute and really terrific\\", the character has garnered few positive reactions otherwise, with Sports Illustrated writer John Donovan warning \\"purists everywhere, grab the barf bag,\\" and Sports Illustrated media writer Richard Deitsch using Scooter as an example of \\"how technology does not always help society.\\" The Sporting News reported polling their staff with the question \\"What best summarizes your feelings for Scooter, Fox's talking baseball?\\": 45% of responders chose the answer \\"Send him to a slow, painful death.\\" Despite most reactions, Scooter would still be used in televised baseball games until after the 2006 World Series. Starting with the 2004 postseason, Fox's baseball broadcasts began using the same graphics package that debuted with NFL telecasts in 2003. The score banner was changed to match the layout adopted by the network's football coverage at the start of the 2004 season, but using the abbreviations of the teams playing instead of their logos. Team abbreviations were shown this time in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color, the shaded area above the score banner was removed, and the scores were shown in white text in black parallelograms. Whenever team-specific information was displayed in the banner such as a scored run or an out, the abbreviation would morph into the team logo with the scored run being displayed; the team who would score a run would have its abbreviation morph into its logo and a \\"strobe light\\" would flash over the black parallelogram as the score changes. When a home run was displayed in the banner, a split \\"strobe light\\" would flash a few times across the banner with the words \\"HOME RUN (team)\\" in the team's color then zooming in to the center from both left and right angles, accompanied by two distorted electric buzzes followed by a futuristic computer sounder. This marked the first time that a home run was displayed in the banner. When it appeared, flashing lights spanning the top of the screen with two moving lines on top and bottom would join to morph into the banner; when first formed, the team logos were shown before changing into the abbreviations. When it was removed, the banner became just a quick beam of light spanning the top of the screen, which would disappear very quickly. In October 2004, Fox started airing all Major League Baseball postseason broadcasts (including the League Championship Series and World Series) in high definition; Fox also started airing the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in HD that year. Prior to the 2008 season, one of the three regional games the network televises each Saturday was presented in HD. Since 2008, all MLB games televised by Fox ‚Äì including Saturday regional games ‚Äì are presented in high definition. Dave O'Brien provided commentary for MLB International's coverage of the World Series from 2004 until 2009. O'Brien teamed with his usual ESPN partner Rick Sutcliffe on broadcasts of the World Series and the American League Championship Series for MLB International. =2005= While covering the 2005 Major League Baseball All-Star Game at Comerica Park in Detroit, host Jeanne Zelasko angered many fans for her treatment of legendary broadcaster Ernie Harwell. Many disliked the way Zelasko abruptly ‚Äì and in many fans' eyes, awkwardly ‚Äì cut Harwell off just 17 seconds into a pre-game interview, as Harwell was detailing the accomplishments of famous Tiger Al Kaline. Harwell later said he was not offended by Zelasko, and let the matter drop. In September 2008, Zelasko took heat for referring to the Tampa Bay Rays as the \\"Tampa Rays\\". Jeanne Zelasko has, in general, been accused of being too flippant, not particularly knowledgeable about the sport of baseball, and inserting too many corny cliches or plays on words during broadcasts. OLN was briefly considering picking up the rights to the Sunday and Wednesday games, which expired after the 2005 season. On September 14, 2005 however, ESPN, then the current rights holder, signed an eight-year contract with Major League Baseball. The weekday afternoon \\"DayGame\\" telecasts that ESPN and ESPN2 had previously aired were eliminated in the new pact, along with the late (10 p.m. ET) Wednesday night game (although ESPN can elect to show a late game instead of an early one should it so desire), and the coverage of Memorial Day, Independence Day, and Labor Day games (except for games that fall under the regular Monday-night slot). ESPN's Monday and Wednesday telecasts remain mostly nonexclusive, meaning the games also can be televised by each club's local broadcasters. In fact, Wednesday games are blacked out on ESPN unless a participating team's local broadcaster does not choose to televise the game. The Sunday games remain on ESPN only, and with ESPN losing the rights to Sunday Night Football telecasts, it looks likely that Sunday Night Baseball will run uninterrupted on ESPN throughout the season, except on Opening Night (when it will air on ESPN2, since it usually conflicts with the NCAA Women's Basketball Final Four). Alternate telecasts for home-team markets which are blacked out have also been phased out, either in an effort to save costs or in an effort to allocate more satellite space for high-definition broadcasts on ESPNHD. Those who get ESPN via cable get ESPNEWS instead, and those who get the channel via satellite see a blank picture and a blackout notice. MLB will receive, on average, $296 million a year under the new agreement, a television and a baseball official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of a confidentiality agreement in the deal. ESPN will pay baseball $273.5 million in 2006, $293.5 million in each of the following four years, $308.5 million in 2011 and $306 million in each of the final two seasons. During the 2005 World Series on Fox, a new white banner was introduced. This would resemble a chrome finish, and the team abbreviations became white letters in the team's main color; the next few years, the new banner was adopted for all games. This banner, unlike the 2001‚Äì2004 version, would not be removed for the final out of the World Series but was dropped at other critical points (like whenever Alex Rodriguez came to bat, tied with an April record 14 home runs, and when Barry Bonds had 753). =2006= Fox has used numerous scheduling formulas for its Saturday regular season coverage. These have often changed based on the rights granted by new television contracts, and the pregame programs that the network has chosen to air. From 1996 to 2006, Fox began its weekly game telecasts on the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend or the weekend before. The selection of games varied on a regional basis, and the start times were staggered based on region. A half-hour pregame show aired at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time, followed by game broadcasts held at 1:00 p.m. in the Eastern and Central Time Zones. West Coast games did not air until 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (1:00 p.m. in the Pacific Time Zone). All of these games were exclusive to the broadcast network, and as a result, Fox's exclusivity window lasted through the entire afternoon. On July 11, 2006, Major League Baseball announced that the Fox network had signed a new seven-year contract, which guaranteed that Fox would remain the broadcaster of the World Series through the 2013 season. Fox had widely been expected to renew the deal, but it was unclear what the network would be willing to air beyond the All-Star Game and World Series. After weeks of speculation and rumors, on July 11, at the All-Star Game, Major League baseball announced that Time Warner's TBS will gain rights to a Sunday afternoon Game of the Week beginning in the 2008 season. TBS will be allowed to choose the games that it will carry and may select a single team up to 13 times. TBS also will gain exclusive broadcast rights to the Division Series in both leagues starting in 2007, as well as any tiebreakers starting with the 2007 season. On October 18, 2006, Major League Baseball announced that TBS will also carry the other League Championship Series. (Through the 2006 season, ESPN had national broadcast rights to tiebreakers, and ESPN and Fox shared coverage of the Division Series, with ESPN covering the majority of the games, while Fox was guaranteed the 8:00 p.m. Eastern slot most nights.) TBS also gained the rights to the All-Star Game Selection Show, formerly on ESPN. As part of the agreement, the network also announced that it will no longer cover the Atlanta Braves on an exclusive national basis after the 2007 season. Games will be subject to blackout in the teams' markets, but local broadcasters can still air the games. TBS would carry 70 Braves games in the 2007 season, in addition to the postseason package, but beginning in 2008 will only carry the Sunday game on a national basis. However, WTBS (now WPCH-TV) could still carry up to 45 games within the Braves' six-state geographical area (Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Mississippi). These games could conceivably air nationally as part of the MLB Extra Innings package. The package with Fox was officially announced on October 17, 2006. Under the terms of the arrangement, Fox retained its rights to the network's regular-season package, which would now begin in April, and would remain the exclusive home of the All-Star Game and World Series. Fox's postseason coverage beyond the World Series is limited to one League Championship Series per year (the American League Championship Series in odd numbered years and National League Championship Series in even numbered years), which alternates every year with TBS (which took over exclusive rights to the Division Series from ESPN) airing the other LCS. One of the terms of the deal was that, beginning with the 2007 season, the Saturday \\"Game of the Week\\" coverage was extended over the entire season rather than starting after Memorial Day, with most games being aired in the 3:30 to 7:00 p.m. (Eastern Time) time slot, which was reduced to 4:00 to 7:00 after Fox cancelled its in- studio pre-game program for the 2009 season. Exceptions were added in 2010 with a 3:00 to 7:00 afternoon window being used on Saturdays when Fox was scheduled to broadcast a NASCAR Cup Series race in prime time (which would start at 7:30) and a 7:00 to 10:00 window, when Fox is scheduled to broadcast the UEFA Champions League soccer final (which would start at 3:00). As previously mentioned, after the 2006 Division Series, ESPN lost the rights to broadcast playoff games on TV. All postseason games, from possible one-game playoffs to the World Series, have aired on Fox Sports and TBS since 2007. Games remained on ESPN Radio. ESPN also lost rights to ESPN DayGame presented by Fruit of the Loom and Thursday Night Baseball powered by Castrol. Because of the reduction of ESPN's weekly schedule from five games to three, ESPN released numerous commentators from the network, including Jeff Brantley, Tino Martinez, Steve Stone and Eric Karros. With the new deal coming into play this year, several things changed with the Monday and Wednesday night games in particular. For Monday Night Baseball, the telecast will now co-exist with teams' local carriers up to three times per year, up from two times in previous years. Wednesday Night Baseball also changed slightly. Now, in addition to the featured game that night, they will also have some live cut- ins to other games across the nation and discuss some the hot topics in the major leagues. ESPN telecasts in 2006, posted an average of 1,115,000 household impressions, up 27% when compared to 2005's 875,000. The corresponding 1.2 rating this year marks a 20% increase over the 1.0 average in 2005. ESPN2's baseball telecasts have averaged 704,000 households, an increase of 34% over 2005's 525,000. Ratings on ESPN2 went up 33% (0.8 vs. 0.6). During their broadcast of Game 3 of the 2006 American League Championship Series, Lou Piniella, who is of Spanish descent, made an analogy involving the luck of finding a wallet, and then briefly used a couple of Spanish phrases. Fox color commentator Steve Lyons responded by saying that Piniella was \\"hablaing Espa√±ol\\" ‚Äì Spanglish for \\"speaking Spanish\\" ‚Äì and added, \\"I still can't find my wallet. I don't understand him, and I don't want to sit close to him now.\\" On October 13, 2006, Fox fired Lyons for making these remarks, which the network determined to be racially insensitive. Lyons was replaced for the last game of the series in Detroit by Los Angeles Angels announcer Jos√© Mota. Piniella later stated that he thought that Lyons was just \\"kidding\\" and that Lyons was, per Piniella's experience, not bigoted. Lyons had previously maligned Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Shawn Green, who is Jewish, for sitting out a game on Yom Kippur in 2004, saying \\"He's not even a practicing Jew. He didn't marry a Jewish girl. And from what I understand, he never had a bar mitzvah, which is unfortunate because he doesn't get the money.\\" Lyons was suspended briefly without pay after his remarks, and Fox apologized for Lyons' comments, though Lyons never made an on-air apology. =2007= In 2007, Fox began airing games every Saturday during the season. A new scheduling format was devised, in which all of the regional games started simultaneously. Fox moved the pregame, which became part of the exclusive game window, to 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time. All of the Fox games would then start at 3:55 p.m. Eastern Time, regardless of region. This format gave more leeway for teams not being shown on Fox to schedule daytime games. Fox's exclusivity began at the start of the pregame at 3:30 and ran until 7:00 p.m. Eastern. On April 1, for the season-opening game between the New York Mets and the St. Louis Cardinals, ESPN changed its on-screen graphics to the version that debuted with Monday Night Football in 2006 and was later adopted by its NBA coverage at the start of the 2006-07 season. The previous graphics dated back to the advent of ESPN HD in 2004. In 2007, Joe Buck was only scheduled to call eight regular season MLB games out of a 26-game schedule for Fox (along with a handful of regional St. Louis Cardinals telecasts on FSN Midwest). In an interview with Richard Sandomir of the New York Times, Buck defended his reduced baseball commitment: In 2008, Buck drew criticism for comments he made during an appearance on ESPN Radio's The Herd with Colin Cowherd, in which he admitted to spending \\"barely any\\" time following sporting events he does not broadcast, and facetiously claimed that he preferred watching The Bachelorette instead. In general, Fox's initial lead broadcast team of Joe Buck and Tim McCarver had been heavily scrutinized, much less criticized over time. During the 2012 National League Championship Series between the San Francisco Giants and St. Louis Cardinals, Buck and McCarver were accused by the San Francisco media in particular, of being too biased towards the Cardinals. During the week of the All-Star Game, Baseball Tonight and SportsCenter did not travel to the game site as it normally does; the 2007 site was AT&T; Park in San Francisco. The reason was that MLB stripped ESPN of its on-site credentials for its studio crew as punishment for leaking the rosters of the All-Star teams before TBS did. TBS' announcement, which was billed as exclusive, was scheduled for 4 p.m. Eastern time but was delayed for nearly two hours, by which point ESPN, in apparent violation of its contract with MLB, went ahead and revealed the rosters anyway. ESPN later agreed to promote playoff coverage on TBS and Fox (alongside its own radio coverage) in return for Baseball Tonight going on the air shortly after each night's games concluded. ESPN pre- empted part of the Kansas State‚ÄìAuburn college football game on September 1 to show the end of the no-hitter thrown by Boston Red Sox pitcher Clay Buchholz. From 2007 to 2010, when TBS aired every Division Series game, start times were staggered throughout the day from early afternoon to late primetime. The first game was usually scheduled to start at 1:07 and the last game was usually scheduled for 9:07. If a game ran long, the start of the next game would be shifted to TNT (the game would move back to TBS during the first commercial break after the end of the earlier game, with an announcement from the in- studio crew to switch to TBS). For the LCS round, TBS would show all of the games at a start time pre-set by MLB. All coverage was followed by Inside MLB. This schedule was brought back for 2013 only, with the exception that MLB Network aired the two games scheduled for the early afternoon slot. During some broadcasts, Fox has experienced various technical difficulties. During its broadcast of Game 3 of the 2007 World Series between the Colorado Rockies and Boston Red Sox, for instance, a blackout occurred during the top half of the seventh inning, resulting in the disruption of a key moment in the game. =2008= Beginning with the 2006 NFL season, Fox's other properties, the NFL, NASCAR, the Bowl Championship Series, and Formula One, again upgraded their graphics packages (Formula One used a different graphics package than the other three properties), but baseball broadcasts continued to use this on- screen design in 2007. It was also used in the July 12, 2008 game between the Colorado Rockies and the New York Mets until the 9th inning, but with the 2008 graphics package instead of the package that was used with this banner. ESPN2 showed the season-opening games in Tokyo between the Red Sox and the Oakland Athletics. Unfortunately, due to a transponder failure, viewers on DirecTV reliant on the standard-definition feed missed the first of the two games. (ESPNHD was unaffected.) On March 30, ESPN showed the first-ever game at Nationals Park in Washington, D.C. The Nationals defeated the Atlanta Braves on a walk-off home run by Ryan Zimmerman. On May 4, ESPN introduced enhanced updates targeting viewers who play fantasy baseball. It shows season batting statistics for the current batter on each potential count and updates batting average and other selected stats after the at-bat concludes. Sunday Night Baseball broadcast the Washington Nationals' very first game at Nationals Park on March 30, 2008. The Nationals beat the Atlanta Braves, 3-2, on Ryan Zimmerman's walk-off home run in the bottom of the ninth. President George W. Bush, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch prior to the game, joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in the ESPN booth during the telecast. The final game played at Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008, pitting the New York Yankees against the Baltimore Orioles, was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball. The Mariano Rivera 500th career save (and also his 1st lifetime RBI) was broadcast on Sunday Night Baseball from Citi Field (home of the New York Mets). TBS began airing the game just prior to the last out in the bottom of the first, with announcer Chip Caray apologizing to viewers for \\"technical difficulties.\\" TBS acknowledged there was a problem with one of the routers used in the broadcast transmission of the relay of the telecast from Atlanta. =2009= Fox discontinued its pregame show in 2009, with the telecasts now beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern and the game time being pushed to 4:10. Fox gave up the first half-hour of its exclusivity, with its window now beginning at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. For the 2009 season, telecasts began using the same graphics package implemented by FSN, with the scoreboard now including a rectangular box in the top-left corner of the 4:3 safe area. Along with FSN in observance of the holiday weekend, the baserunner graphic was changed to a blue pattern with stars during the Fourth of July weekend and All-Star Game in 2010. Also in July 2010, broadcasts began to be produced in full 16:9 widescreen and letterboxed for standard definition viewers through the use of the #10 Active Format Description code (which is primarily used for Fox broadcasts transmitted to pay television providers via its stations). The score box was moved to be in the top-left corner of the widescreen feed. Some sports media critics were critical of the announcers used in the coverage on TBS as being more skewed towards the National League than the American League, along with the choice of Chip Caray (who along the way, was criticized for making factual mistakes during postseason broadcasts) as the lead voice of the network's coverage, as he had only done Braves baseball telecasts during the 2007 season before TBS assumed rights to playoff coverage. In response to such criticisms, Caray said, \\"It wasn't the job that I had when I came here in the first place. It would be like being a pinch-hitter or being a relief pitcher that works once every ten days. I'm better when I work more.\\"Caray to cover Braves for FOX Sports TBS and Caray parted ways following the 2009 playoffs. Ernie Johnson, Jr., Dick Stockton and Brian Anderson began handling play-by-play duties in his place. Following the Philadelphia Phillies' victory in the 2009 NLCS, TBS studio host Ernie Johnson went to the podium to present the championship trophy.

It is situated on the corner of North Terrace and Morphett Street in Adelaide's West End, in a refurbished and repurposed factory once owned by wholesale grocers D. & J. Fowler Ltd. With its distinctive red brick federation-style architecture, the 1906 building designed by Frank Counsell is state heritage-listed. After its use as a factory ceased, the building started being used as a performance space. It was known as the Living Arts Centre from about 1986 until 1992, during which time the building was renovated, converted and renamed to Lion Arts Centre. History =The building= The Fowler's \\"Lion\\" Factory, with its distinctive parapet topped by a statue of a lion, was designed by architect Frank Counsell in federation style for D. & J. Fowler Ltd in 1906. The brickwork was built by W. Sander & Sons, while the lion statue took three months to be carved by a Melbourne stonemason, John Patrick Jackson. The building is noted for its high-quality brick detailing and the well-designed composition of the facade. The building was used for packaging Fowler's Lion brand of flour, and the (original and now restored) signage on the parapet still says 'Fowler's \\"Lion\\" Factory'. Fowler's wide range of Lion brand products, trademarked in 1886, were very popular. The original symmetrical shape of the facade was destroyed in 1966, when the eastern wing was demolished for the widening of Morphett Street and the construction of two new bridges across North Terrace and the River Torrens. =Conversion to arts use= D & J Fowler was only taken over by Southern Farmers Ltd in 1982-83, but the factory lay vacant from around the middle of the 20th century, until the space was revived in the 1970s as offices and performance space for the Adelaide Fringe Festival, which included live music and was known as the Fringe Club. In 1984 there was a Steering Committee appointed to investigate the feasibility of the Living Arts Centre, the precursor to the Lion Arts Centre, with the full conversion of the building planned in 1991. AusStage lists ten sources which list performances at the Living Arts Centre between February 1986 and February 1990 (and one in 1994, but this may be an anomaly). In 1992 the factory and surrounds was converted into an arts centre, henceforth known as the Lion Arts Centre, which became home to a variety of arts organisations. In 1988 a copy of the lion was installed on the parapet, the original having moved with D & J Fowler. 1992‚Äìpresent After the creation of the Centre in 1992, its tenants moved in, including the Media Resource Centre, Leigh Warren & Dancers (now Dance Hub SA) and Craftsouth (formerly Craft Association of South Australia), a not-for-profit supporting visual artists and designers. the Lion Arts Centre accommodates the Media Resource Centre, Nexus Arts (an artists' collective, formerly Multicultural Arts Workers Committee), ACE Open galleries and studios, the State Theatre Company of South Australia offices and Guildhouse (formerly Craftsouth). The JamFactory and Mercury Cinema are adjacent and sometimes regarded as part of the complex. Music =Music House= In 2000‚Äì2001, Music House at the Lion Arts Centre was established, to provide in order to promote and develop the contemporary music industry in South Australia. It occupied Level 1 of the building until 2002. =Music SA= From sometime before 2007 until 2015, the not-for-profit training and music promotion organisation Music SA was located on Level 1, with the address given as \\"Fowlers Building\\" for some of that time. =Fowler's Live= On 4 July 2003, the music venue named Fowler's Live opened on the ground floor. It hosted a wide range of live music, including The Bellrays, Paul Dempsey, Ben Kweller, and Sonic Youth. The Fowler's Live Music Awards ran from 2012 to 2014, before being rebranded as the South Australian Music Awards in 2015. The lease ended and Fowler's Live closed at the end of 2018. =Lion Arts Factory= With a tender process selecting the new lessees of the venue in August 2018, Ross Osmon and Craig Lock from Five Four Entertainment and Hugo Pedler from West Oak Hotel, along with design collaborators Sam, Simon and Tim Pearce of Frame Creative, put together a pitch and won the lease to start operating from 1 January 2019, under the name Lion Arts Factory. After a major renovation in January 2019, the ground floor, basement and mezzanine are occupied by The Lion Factory, a new live music venue. The venue has been transformed, with previously boarded windows opened up to let light in, paint stripped off the red brick walls, the main stage extended to and the mezzanine reopened. Downstairs is the Coopers Green Room, with chesterfield sofas. Great attention has been given to detail throughout the whole venue, including the creation of comfortable amenities for the performers. The emphasis is on live music, but management is also keen to host other forms of performing arts, in particular theatre and comedy. All genres of music ‚Äì heavy metal, rock and goth, punk, electric, hip-hop, house and others - are featured. Capacity is 500 and the venue opens until 5am on weekends. The venue will host Adelaide Fringe performances from 2020. The street-level area outside the venue has been reactivated, with the intention of bringing some bigger shows into the courtyard.

The complex Wishart distribution was extensively investigated by Goodman while the derivation of the inverse is shown by Shaman and others. It has greatest application in least squares optimization theory applied to complex valued data samples in digital radio communications systems, often related to Fourier Domain complex filtering.

The score banner was converted to a score box in the bottom right hand corner of the screen. And instead of numbers to represent the balls, strikes and outs, dots were represented for each: three green dots for balls, two yellow dots for strikes, and two red dots for outs. The pitch count was also introduced, adopted from the New York Yankees' broadcasts on the YES Network, as well as NESN for the Boston Red Sox. College baseball and softball broadcasts, however, continued to use the previous (2007) graphics for the 2010 College World Series telecasts. ESPN's coverage of the Little League World Series also retained the 2007 graphics until midway through, and then adopted the current (2010) graphics package. Baseball Tonight, a daily highlight show aired on ESPN during the baseball season, likewise introduced new graphics adopted from SportsCenter in June 2010. Also in 2010, Jon Miller and Joe Morgan began their 21st consecutive season working together for ESPN. Among U.S. network television sportscasters, only Pat Summerall and John Madden (who called NFL games for CBS and Fox from 1981 to 2001) have had a similar length partnership in the booth. Following the 2010 season, ESPN announced that the television contracts of Miller and Morgan would not be renewed. Miller was offered, but chose to decline, a continued role with ESPN Radio. In July 2010, Fox's on-screen graphics were repositioned for the 16:9 aspect ratio, as all HDTV programming from the Fox network began to be presented in a letterboxed format using an Active Format Description code for standard definition viewers. The supposed high-definition picture, however, has been derided as coming across as highly imperfect, lacking the detail and clarity normally expected from a high-definition broadcast. From 2007 to 2010, when TBS aired every Division Series game, start times were staggered throughout the day from early afternoon to late primetime. The first game was usually scheduled to start at 1:07 and the last game was usually scheduled for 9:07. If a game ran long, the start of the next game would be shifted to TNT (the game would move back to TBS during the first commercial break after the end of the earlier game, with an announcement from the in-studio crew to switch to TBS). For the LCS round, TBS would show all of the games at a start time pre-set by MLB. All coverage was followed by Inside MLB. This schedule was brought back for 2013 only, with the exception that MLB Network aired the two games scheduled for the early afternoon slot. Beginning with the 2010 MLB playoffs, Fox has used its NFL theme music for its MLB coverage (and all other Fox Sports properties, including NASCAR and UFC events). There has been backlash from fans who believe that the NFL theme does not belong on MLB coverage, and that the previous MLB theme should return. A poll by Sports Media Watch noted that as of October 23, 2010, while nearly 60% of fans thought that Fox made a bad move, only 11% thought it was a good move and 30% had no opinion (all percentages rounded). =2011= Starting with Opening Day of the 2011 MLB season, both the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports Networks began using the same graphics package adopted for NFL on Fox telecasts in 2010, featuring a new horizontal layout with team abbreviations (as opposed to the use of team logos on the NFL version) and scores flanking a display of the inning, diamond, count, outs (represented by 3 lights), and pitch speed in the center. The new scoreboard was also able to slide open to reveal statistical information or home run notifications. The ESPN Major League Baseball score box was slightly modified beginning with the opening day game between the Detroit Tigers and the New York Yankees. Numbers indicating the ball, strike and out counts replace the dots used last year; the out dots were adopted by Fox Sports Net on their local broadcasts as well as Major League Baseball on Fox. The pitch speed and count are now fixed below the bases graphic. Also, the area around the bases graphic and ball, strike, and out counter is slightly translucent. Beginning with the Sunday Night Baseball interleague game between the New York Yankees and the Chicago Cubs on June 19, the graphics were slightly adjusted to fit in with the 16:9 aspect ratio for HD broadcasts, similar to what Fox Saturday Baseball, Root Sports and Fox Sports Net have done for their baseball coverage. TBS would follow suit in adjusting their graphics to the 16:9 aspect ratio. In 2011 and 2012, TNT aired its own slate of postseason Division Series games, due to MLB's desire to air fewer LDS games in the early afternoon. This was the first time TNT had ever aired regularly scheduled MLB games, however it used TBS's announcers and production crews with the only difference being the TNT logo in the scorebox replacing the usual TBS logo. In 2011, TNT aired Rays-Rangers Game 1, Tigers- Yankees Games 1 and 2, and Brewers-Diamondbacks Game 3. In 2012, TNT aired Reds-Giants Game 1, and A's-Tigers Games 4 and 5. During the network's coverage of Game 1 of the 2011 American League Division Series between the Texas Rangers and Tampa Bay Rays, TBS was alleged to have featured doctored headlines with incorrect attributions. On October 1, during the middle of an at-bat during Game 1 of the 2011 ALDS between the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, TBS suddenly cut to an ALDS game between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Texas Rangers, which was airing on TNT, for about 14 seconds. Moments later (as TBS was coming out of a replay and showing the Tigers' dugout), cameras missed Yankees right fielder Nick Swisher making a diving catch (instead showing Yankees pitcher Iv√°n Nova walking off the mound and pumping his fist). TBS (in particular, throughout their coverage of the 2011 postseason) has also been criticized for placing the center-field camera precisely in the center. Therefore, every time a pitcher began his windup, his head would block the view of home plate. =2012= The score box and other graphics on ESPN were carried over from 2011, but a new logo for all ESPN MLB presentations was unveiled at the start of the season. The ESPN logo is fixed on a CGI baseball, with the words 'Major League Baseball' (or Baseball Tonight and Sunday, Monday or Wednesday Night Baseball) in a stylized neon light surrounding it. A 2-D version is also used on print ads or on secondary program IDs. The graphics would stay virtually the same for the next three seasons. For 2012, Fox revised its schedule; while the 3:30 p.m. Eastern Time start time remained intact, weekly games on certain Saturdays when the network was to air NASCAR races held at Texas Motor Speedway, Richmond International Raceway and Darlington Raceway start at 12:30 p.m. Eastern Time. Starting with the date of the UEFA Champions League Final until the Saturday before the All-Star Break, all \\"Game of the Week\\" telecasts would start at 7:00 p.m. Eastern Time. The Baseball Night in America moniker was used for all MLB on Fox games in that span. For the 2012 MLB season, the score box on Fox was modified to use cap insignias instead of team abbreviations, and outs were now represented by only two lamps. Beginning with the 2012 NLCS, the score box was modified again to match the new layout adopted by Fox's NFL coverage at the start of the 2012 season; teams and scores reverted to being vertically stacked on the left, the base graphic moved to the right-hand side, pitch speed is displayed below the base graphic (which now displays the pitch count below the diamond after 40 pitches as well), while the count, outs, and inning number moved to a tab below the box. This graphic was also not removed for the final out of the World Series. In late-March 2013, the Fox Sports Networks began using this version in time for the start of the 2013 MLB season (the previous scoring bug was used for 2013 Spring training games). On July 24, 2012, Matt Yoder of Awful Announcing questioned Fox's need to hire local broadcasters on their national telecasts and therefore, bringing about a perceived sense of favoritism towards one of the participating teams. For example, Billy Ripken, who played for the Baltimore Orioles alongside his Hall of Fame brother Cal, was roundly criticized for his perceived favoritism towards the Orioles while broadcasting an Orioles‚ÄìDetroit Tigers game (even by actor Jeff Daniels via Twitter) for Fox the previous week. The following week came a Philadelphia Phillies‚ÄìSan Francisco Giants telecast on Fox, which was called by Phillies play-by-play announcer Tom McCarthy and former Phillies pitcher Mitch Williams. McCarthy and Williams were in particular, singled out for their rather downbeat manner of calling a Matt Cain home run off Cole Hamels in the top of the 3rd inning. This was contrasted by their more enthusiastic call of Hamels returning the favor with a home run in the bottom half of the inning. In 2019, Len Kasper, who is currently the voice of the Cubs, broadcast Cubs- Nationals on Fox with a rather monotonous tone of voice while calling Nationals home runs. On September 19, 2012, Sports Business Daily reported that Major League Baseball would agree to separate eight-year television deals with Fox Sports and Turner Sports through the 2021 season. Fox would reportedly pay around $4 billion over eight years (close to $500 million per year) while Turner would pay around $2.8 billion over eight years (more than $300 million per year). Under the new deals, Fox and TBS's coverage would essentially be the same as in the 2007-2013 contract with the exception of Fox and TBS splitting coverage of the Division Series, which TBS has broadcast exclusively dating back to 2007. More importantly, Fox would carry some of the games (such as the Saturday afternoon Game of the Week) on its all-sports channel, Fox Sports 1. Sources also said that was possible that Fox would sell some Division Series games to MLB Network, which did end up occurring. The new deal between Major League Baseball and TBS was officially confirmed on October 2, 2012. Under the deal: * TBS' postseason coverage would continue, but would be modified. TBS would now be the exclusive home for the entire postseason for the American League in even numbered years and the National League in odd numbered years. The other league's playoffs would be covered by Fox, with the exception of its Wild Card Game which would be carried by ESPN and select early afternoon games broadcast by MLB Network. * TBS would also air afternoon games with new co-existing rights on the final 13 Sundays of the regular season as part of the network's Sunday MLB on TBS Game of the Week package. * TBS would lose the broadcasting rights to the MLB All-Star Selection Show to the MLB Network. During the 2012 American League playoffs, TBS was criticized for its graphics and game preview packages. At the start of its coverage of the American League Wild Card Game between the Baltimore Orioles and Texas Rangers, a graphical snafu resulted in Cal Ripken, Jr., who was calling the game, being credited as \\"Carl Ripken, Jr.\\" During Game 1 of the American League Championship Series between the New York Yankees and Detroit Tigers, TBS showed a graphic depicting players who played in the postseason before the age of 24 and after the age of 40. In the graphic, Willie Mays's name was misspelled as \\"Willie Mayes\\". During the 2012 National League Championship Series, Fox's camera angles were criticized for being directly in-line with home plate, thus often ensuring that a pitcher's head blocked the view. Fox's camera angles were again criticized (this time in an elevated and more dead center camera angle) during FS1's coverage of Game 1 of the 2016 National League Division Series between the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco Giants. =2013= Fans of the Pittsburgh Pirates, which in 2013, had its first winning season as well as its postseason appearance since 1992, took TBS to task for not broadcasting the traditional pre-game player introductions, \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", or ceremonial first pitch during their coverage of the National League Wild Card playoff game against the Cincinnati Reds. Dick Stockton's performance on TBS has in particular, been subject to criticism. Stockton, for instance, during the 2013 NLDS (St. Louis vs. Pittsburgh) was cited as often misidentifying players, generally appearing confused at times, and never having hosting chemistry with his analyst Bob Brenly. Meanwhile, Joe Simpson, who was the only holdover from the Braves TBS Baseball days, has been accused of not really adding anything to the booth and often deferring to John Smoltz during their time together on the 2013 Boston-Tampa Bay series. Field reporter Erin Andrews' performance has been criticized since she joined Fox Sports' MLB coverage in 2012. For example, Andrews during trophy presentations, has been accused of showing an extreme lack of knowledge by reading off notes. More to the point, during the trophy presentation at the end of the 2013 American League Championship Series, Andrews misidentified former Anaheim Angels owner and honorary American League president Jackie Autry as her late husband Gene. Andrews was further criticized during the trophy presentations for the 2014 World Series due to her very generic questions that for the most part, lacked insight. During the bottom of the 9th in Game 4 of the 2013 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals, Fox's cameras missed Boston closer Koji Uehara picking off pinch runner Kolten Wong to end the game (it was the first postseason game in baseball history to end on a pickoff). =2014= For the 2014 season, Fox's sister cable channel Fox Sports 1 began providing Major League Baseball game coverage, carrying a Fox Saturday Baseball doubleheader on most weeks. FS1's coverage begins with the pregame show a half-hour before the game, which usually starts at 1:00 or 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time. A second game usually follows at either 7:00 or 8:00 Eastern Time. If there is a gap between the first and second game, a studio show is not aired in between. All of the telecasts are aired nationally instead of on a regional basis; however, the telecast is not exclusive, unless the game is between two teams that whose games are broadcast on the Fox Sports regional networks. Prime time games continue to air on the Fox network, and once again used the 2010 scheduling formula for these telecasts, including full national exclusivity. Beginning in 2014, Fox Sports 1 added several non-exclusive Tuesday night telecasts outside of its regular Saturday schedule. These games generally feature marquee teams which may attract a large audience, along the lines of the 2004 Red Sox- Yankees telecast or the Mark McGwire telecasts. In 2015, one Thursday game was scheduled, though this was during a rare week in which Fox Saturday Baseball was not scheduled to air. As part of Fox Sports' new Major League Baseball broadcast deal, in April 2014, Fox Sports 1 premiered MLB Whiparound, an hour- long nightly baseball highlight program (similar in vein to ESPN's Baseball Tonight and MLB Network's MLB Tonight) featuring quick-turnaround highlights, and news and analysis from around the league (live look-ins of games being played in progress generally can not be shown on Whiparound, as MLB Tonight is reserved that right exclusively). It is hosted by Chris Myers, who is joined by one or two analysts rotating between Frank Thomas, Eric Karros, Dontrelle Willis and C. J. Nitkowski. Although Whiparound airs most weeknights at 10:00 p.m., the Wednesday editions are usually delayed to 12:00 a.m. Eastern Time on weeks when Fox Sports 1 airs a sporting event in prime time during the MLB season (on weeks without predetermined programming conflicts, the program airs in its regular 10:00 p.m. slot). For the 2014 season, Fox's MLB coverage debuted a new graphics package first seen on its NASCAR broadcasts that year. Notably, the score box was moved to the bottom-left corner of the screen. The box places the team abbreviations and scores on the left side over the team's background color. On the top of the right side is the inning (which is the only component in yellow text) and the base graphic; the lower right contains the count and outs (represented by two dots). Above the main box is a new \\"dynamic\\" strip, which by default shows the last name of the current pitcher along with the number of pitches he has thrown. However, this strip can be expanded and change color to display team-specific information, such as on- deck hitters and pitchers warming up in the bullpen. In June 2015, this was also expanded to include a white area featuring the last name of the current batter and their performance throughout the game (or their average for their first time at-bat). When a home run is hit, the main box turns to the team's color and displays the text \\"Home Run\\", while the dynamic strip grows and displays the name of the team over the team's logo. Other times (usually on FSN), the dynamic strip displays the name of the player who hit that home run and the main box displays the type of home run and how many home runs that player has hit during the season. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous design, though these graphics are more in the shape of a square, with a typeface that is less athletic in style than the previous Fox graphic packages. Starting with the 2016 season, the score box was moved to the bottom right. With Fox Sports 1 taking over some of the Major League Baseball coverage in 2014, postseason coverage on Fox Sports' end of the package began to be split between the Fox broadcast network and Fox Sports 1. Four games from both National League Division Series matchups aired on Fox Sports 1, with the remaining game airing on MLB Network; however, all of the telecasts were produced by Fox and used Fox Sports announcers (although Bob Costas served as a play-by-play announcer for one of the games). Fox Sports then carried exclusive coverage of the National League Championship Series ‚Äì in which the Fox network aired a traditional telecast of Game 1, while Fox Sports 1 aired an experimental telecast supplemented by advanced metrics and statistics and standard telecasts for Games 2 through 5. Fox would air Game 6 if necessary, while a possible Game 7 (which did not occur) would end up airing on Fox Sports 1; the Fox network would air the World Series in its entirety. As part of their contract renewal before the 2019 season, Fox has agreed to air any LCS Game 7 on the broadcast network. With TBS only holding the rights to half of the postseason beginning in 2014, the network aired games at start times that did not conflict with Fox, ESPN, or MLB Network's coverage of the postseason, and airs Inside MLB following the conclusion of its own coverage instead of at the conclusion of all games on a given day. Ernie Johnson, Jr. has been accused of not playing to his strengths as a broadcaster in his role as TBS's lead play-by-play man. More to the point, Johnson was accused of (in part because of his very conversational announcing style in the booth) never really seeming to be able to capture the big, exciting, transformational moments during his broadcast of the 2014 American League Wild Card Game between the Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics. For example, there was Johnson's rather subdued call of Brandon Moss‚Äôs second home run that gave Oakland a 5-3 lead in the top of the 6th. Also during their coverage of 2014 AL Wild Card Game, TBS put a graphic that incorrectly said that Oakland manager Bob Melvin was in his fourth straight playoff appearance, but this was only his third straight (2012, 2013 and 2014). Throughout the evening, TBS's broadcast was cited in not having enough adequate camera angles for replays that provided value to viewers. As opposed to productions that bring extra resources and cameras to playoff games, TBS's broadcast of this particular game was cited as feeling more like a weekly or regional telecast. That was arguably manifested in Kansas City Royals legend George Brett being forced into a \\"Very Funny\\" promo. =2015= For the 2015 season, ESPN introduced a new on-air appearance for baseball. Among its changes were a new, persistent K-Zone Live graphic, consisting of a faded white rectangle that is overlaid live atop the strike zone on the home plate camera angle at all times. A new K-Zone 3D graphic, with ball trails and a three-dimensional box representing the strike zone, can also be used during replays. The new live K-Zone graphic was criticized by viewers and the media for being potentially distracting, drawing comparisons to baseball video games and Foxs \\"glowing puck\\" from its NHL coverage. On August 30, 2015, former softball player Jessica Mendoza joined the Sunday Night Baseball broadcast team as a color commentator. For the 2016 MLB season, former Yankees player Aaron Boone joined Shulman and Mendoza in the broadcast booth as the second color commentator for SNB. Shulman stepped down at the conclusion of the 2017 season, while Boone left the booth after being named new Yankees manager. During the bottom of the third inning of Game 5 of the 2015 National League Division Series between the New York Mets and Los Angeles Dodgers, TBS's cameras caught a tense exchange between Dodgers manager Don Mattingly and outfielder Andre Ethier. So when TBS went to an interview conducted between innings by Sam Ryan in the Dodgers' dugout with Mattingly, the assumption was that Ryan would ask Mattingly what happened. Ryan then proceeded to ask Mattingly instead, how he thought Zack Greinke was pitching, what he thought of the game so far. Later in the broadcast, Cal Ripken, Jr. brought up what we had all seen when Ethier came up to bat again in the fifth, saying, \\"We‚Äôre still guessing what that argument was all about.\\" In Game 2 of the aforementioned Mets-Dodgers NLDS, Ripken was quick to categorize Chase Utley's slide into Mets shortstop, Rub√©n Tejada (which broke Tejada's leg) as a clean play, \\"a little late,\\" and nothing more than \\"competitive baseball\\". Since along with Tom Verducci, succeeding Tim McCarver as Fox's lead color commentator in 2014, Harold Reynolds has been accused contributing to little more superficial, surface-level stuff on telecasts. For example, during Game 5 the 2015 American League Championship Series, when Toronto's Chris Colabello cranked a solo homer in the second, Reynolds' simple contribution was, \\"Well, I guess he made an adjustment.\\" More to the point, immediately after, Verducci jumped in and explained how that was the first home run that Kansas City starter Edinson V√≥lquez had allowed in his past 1,228 changeups. Reynolds‚Äô response was \\"How do you know that? Unbelievable, Tom. You were sitting on that one, weren‚Äôt you?\\" Fox suffered an outage during their broadcast of Game 1 of the 2015 World Series resulting in a brief delay in the game. After a brief cutaway to the Los Angeles studios (missing one at-bat), Fox picked up the MLB Network-produced feed, which is broadcast to viewers outside the United States. This feed used Fox's #2 announce team of Matt Vasgersian and John Smoltz. After two innings, Fox's #1 crew of Joe Buck, Harold Reynolds and Tom Verducci entered and called the action worldwide. An inning later, Fox had their own broadcast back up and running, with Buck, Reynolds and Verducci refunding to the Fox booth, while Vasgersian and Smoltz re-entered the MLBN booth. Since 2015, production of the MLB International broadcasts has been assumed by MLB Network. Matt Vasgersian (formerly of Fox and today part of ESPN Sunday Night Baseball in addition to the MLB Network, also former play-by-play television announcer for the San Diego Padres) has served as the play-by-play commentator; for the 2016 World Series onward, he was joined by Buck Martinez (play-by-play analyst of the Toronto Blue Jays for Sportsnet‚Äîwhich has carried the world feeds due to his involvement, and former color commentator for TBS) on color. Since 2018, with Matt now with ESPN part-time in addition to his MLB Network duties, Buck was joined for the All-Star Game duties by former Sunday Night Baseball voice Dan Shulman (who has also been paired with Martinez on selected Blue Jays games). =2016= At the beginning of the 2016 season, TBS introduced new graphics that were used all season including the postseason. The score box, which was originally docked to the top and left edges of the screen, was completely redesigned for 2017 after much criticism during the 2016 postseason. Beginning in 2016, the usually all-news network CNN en Espa√±ol carries TBS's postseason coverage with the Spanish language audio, though no language adjustments are made to the on-screen graphics. The Spanish audio is also available through TBS's second audio program, and the coverage on CNN en Espa√±ol is subject to pre-emption for appropriate breaking news coverage. During the top of the third inning of Game 3 of the 2016 American League Division Series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Texas Rangers, TBS's Matt Winer was doing a live interview with Texas third base coach Tony Beasley, when Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus hit a home run. Winer had to cut off Beasley during the interview to tell the audience that Andrus got \\"a double\\", before then realizing it was a home run. When Andrus finally rounded third base, Winer said, \\"Excuse me, that's not a double; that's a home run.\\" As a direct result of all of this, there wasn't full screen of the Andrus homer, nor was there a proper play-by- play of the home run. During the 2016 season, TBS debuted a new scoreboard design that was criticized by viewers for its large size. The following season, TBS was criticized again for having initially made its scoreboard too small. Following Game 1 of the 2016 World Series, Fox affiliate WJW in Cleveland, which would carry the Cleveland Indians' World Series appearance via Fox, aired a brief commercial criticizing TBS, in light of the mistakes and errors that had run rampant throughout their playoff coverage. =2017= In the 2017 season, ESPN introduced a new camera angle known as \\"Front Row Cam\\"; it is designed to provide a \\"low-home\\" camera angle, and utilizes a cylindrical camera pointed vertically at a mirror inside an enclosure positioned along the wall behind home plate. During the American League Wild Card Game, ESPN also introduced a new \\"immersive\\" K-Zone 3D component, which allows the data to be rendered into a virtual stadium environment to be viewed at different perspectives. For the 2017 postseason, Fox's MLB coverage unveiled a new graphics package first seen on its NFL telecasts, though the same layout from the 2014 version for the scoring bug continued to be used, with the addition of two statistical panes atop the scoring bug for batter/pitcher matchups, game at-bat results, and individual statistics. Also, the inning indicator, the ball-strike counter and the out counter (which is now back to being numerically represented) were all moved to the bottom of the scoring bug. =2018= The 2018 season saw a revamp of ESPN's lead commentary team, with Matt Vasgersian succeeding Dan Shulman, and Alex Rodriguez joining as analyst. ESPN also anticipated increased use of the Front Row Cam on Sunday Night Baseball, and the immersive K-Zone 3D feature being employed on all games (a move enabled by ESPN's full adoption of on-site graphics and replay systems operated remotely from its main studios in Bristol). ESPN also unveiled a major on-air rebranding for its MLB coverage. During the 2018 ALDS, analyst Ron Darling apologized after making an insensitive comment about New York Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka during Game 2 of the Yankees' series against Boston. Early in the broadcast while attempting to point out a weakness of Tanaka‚Äôs, Darling said ‚ÄúA little chink in the armor for Tanaka here. It‚Äôs the first inning where he‚Äôs lost a little of his control.‚Äù During the 2018 World Series John Smoltz was heavily criticized for appearing to hate the direction baseball is going in. On November 15, 2018, Fox renewed its rights, set to expire in 2022, through 2028. The contract maintains Fox's current coverage structure, but with expanded digital rights, and the commitment to air more games on the Fox broadcast network when the new deal takes effect. Fox also committed to airing at least two of its League Championship Series games, as well as any Game 7, on the broadcast network beginning in 2019; it had been criticized for airing only Game 2 of the 2018 National League Championship Series, while placing the rest on Fox Sports 1. =2019= In February 2019, Fox announced plans to air two weeks of regional games on Thursday nights in September of that season, in lieu of Saturday games (which creates conflicts with its college football coverage. They will additionally serve as a prelude to Fox's Thursday Night Football broadcasts.

It is a slender, elongated fish which has a small mouth with long extensions of both jaws forming a beak with the extension of the lower jaw being slightly longer than that of the upper jaw, the dorsal and anal fins are set far back on the body and have short bases, each is followed by 5-7 finlets between them and the deeply forked homocercal tail. Scomberesox scombroides is an epipelagic, schooling species which is found in the open sea near the surface, although it occasionally enters bays and inlets. Although the flesh is highly thought of for eating, the occurrence of large schools which can be exploited is too infrequent for the species to have any commercial importance. Its food consists mainly of small planktonic organisms. It is preyed on by larger fish such as yellowfin tuna, birds such as Cape gannets and by marine mammals. They spawn in warmer waters but for feeding it migrates to cool temperate, plankton-rich waters. Scomberesox scombroides was described by the Scottish naval surgeon, naturalist and Arctic explorer Sir John Richardson as Sairis scombroides with the type locality given as Dusky Bay, New Zealand.

Born to Polish √©migr√©s in Montreal, she sought to become a signer at an early age and made her public d√©but at the Sarah Fischer Concert. A first operatic appearance for Carson followed in 1953 and she portrayed various lead roles in performances across the world. She was inducted into the Canadian Opera Hall of Fame in 1998 and became the first Canadian to receive a commemorative plaque at the National Opera Center in New York in 2013. Biography She was born Clarice Katz in Montreal, Quebec on December 23, 1929. She was the daughter of Polish √©migr√©s who were employed in the garment industry. Although Carson's parents desired her to become a bookkeeper, her objective was to sing from an early age. She began studying professional vocal studies with soprano Pauline Donalda and pianist Jacqueline Richard in Montreal at the age of 19, before moving to New York to be taught by Julia Drobner. Katz adopted the local stage name Clarice Carson, which she subsequently adopted as her legal name. Carson made her public d√©but at the Sarah Fischer Concert series in Montreal in 1956, and later her first operatic appearance at the Op√©ra de Montr√©al as the Lady in Waiting in Macbeth three years later. In 1960, she was cast as Mica√´la in Carmen and as Siebel in Goethe's Faust three years later. With those roles, Carson received more offers to work in opera. She signed her first major contract with the New York City Opera to be part of its national tour for the 1965‚Äì66 season and made her d√©but as the Countess of The Marriage of Figaro. For the 1966‚Äì1967 season, Carson accepted a deal to join the Metropolitan Opera National Company. There, she appeared as Violetta in La traviata and the Female Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia. Carson subsequently spent three more seasons from 1967 to 1970 at the Metropolitan Opera, playing the Pamina in The Magic Flute. In December 1968, she came to further attention by portraying Musetta in La boh√®me, after two of the singers were afflicted by illness. Carson was later cast in Tosca from March to April 1969. Overall, she sang in 63 performances in ten roles at the Metropolitan Opera. Although she created few recordings of her performances, in 1970, Carson sang the title role of Tosca for CBC Television. That same year, she was cast as the title role in the Vancouver Opera Association's production of Aida. Carson then sang the lead role in Suor Angelica and Giorgietta in Il tabarro for the Op√©ra du Qu√©bec in 1971. The following year, she appeared in New York in a concert version of Les Troyens, and reprised the title role of Tosco for Canadian Opera Company (COC) at the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. Carson was cast as Desdemona in Otello in ' Opera du Quebec' production in 1973, before returning to New York to partake in the concert edition of Palestrina. During 1974, Carson portrayed Donna Anna in Don Giovanni, Cio-Cio San in Madama Butterfly and Alice Ford in Falstaff. For the 1975‚Äì1976 season, she rejoined the Metropolitan Opera to portray Fiordiligi in Cosi fan tutte. In 1977, Carson returned to the COC and was cast as Elisabeth of Valois in Don Carlos, and d√©buted with the Manitoba Opera for a second appearance in Don Giovanni. Operatic bass player Paul Plishka invited her to partake in a concert of selections from his most popular repertoires in high school auditoriums in 1978. Two years later, Carson joined the Pittsburgh Opera to sing the role of Donna Anna in Don Giovanni. Other performances that Carson portrayed during her career were Constanze in The Abduction in, Maddalena in Andrea Ch√©nier and the title roles of Salome and Turandot in opera buildings across the world. She retired from the opera after playing Senta in a production of The Flying Dutchman with the Lyric Opera of Chicago in late 1983. Carson confided in her friend and former manager Ann Summers at the time that, \\"I'm lonely on the road\\". Her final stage performance was in 1986, and she began operating a store called Carson-Palmer: Fashion Alternatives on Eglinton Avenue in Toronto, where she rented out formal dresses to women who did not want high- end gowns. Carson also served as an active board member and mentored several young singers with the International Resource Centre for Performing Artists (IRCPA). She died of kidney failure in the afternoon on May 2, 2015 at her home in Toronto. Personality and personal life Carson's daughter described her as \\"extremely intelligent\\", and a person who was \\"very generous\\" and liked to enjoy life. She was familiar to audiences in Ottawa, though she was unable to achieve much recognition and success outside of North America. Carson was a feminist from her childhood. Adrian Waller of the Montreal Gazette noted Carson's \\"especially large\\" and \\"extremely well placed\\" soprano voice. At the age of 18, Carson married William \\"Bill\\" Ornstein and they had two children. The marriage had an amicable conclusion. She later had a short marriage to Greek-American tenor and vocal coach Philon Ktsanes. Legacy Joseph So of Opera Canada called Carson \\"An important figure in Canadian opera history\\". In December 1998, she was inducted into the Canadian Opera Hall of Fame by the Op√©ra de Montr√©al at Place des Arts. In August 2013, Carson received a commemorative plaque at the National Opera Center in New York to acknowledge her career as an international opera soprano, making her the first Canadian to receive such an honour. She donated her musical scores, personal correspondence, program booklets and tape recordings of her performances to the IRCPA library to ensure her work was preserved for future generations.

The first serial killer in the country's history, he was released after serving out his sentence on June 24, 1993, and is living a normal life and working as a security guard. Early life Brown was born in Puerto Armuelles into a family of Afro-Panamanians, and studied in a primary school until the 4th grade. According to him, he had a wonderful childhood until the age of nine, when his father left the house. As there was now a lack of a male authority figure in his life, Silvano's behavior became problematic. At some point in his youth, he had to serve two years in a juvenile prison for an unspecified offence. Murders =Paula Caballero= In 1959, at the age of 18, Brown was looking for a house to break into in San Francisco, when he came upon the house of 18-year-old Caballero. After observing the woman undressing herself, he surprised Paula, causing to her to scream \\"Oh my God, my mother, my God!\\". Using a knife he carried for cutting fabrics from doors and windows while breaking into houses, Brown fatally stabbed her chest on the left side. Caballero managed to walk a few steps, before collapsing dead on the ground. The panicked Silvano ran away without looking back, but was captured by authorities, and sentenced to 12 years imprisonment on Coiba's island prison. While in there, he was examined by Jos√© Kaled, a medical and forensic psychiatrist. Kaled predicted that when released, it was very likely that Brown would kill again. On December 4, 1969, Silvano was released from prison and remained under the radar for a few years before striking again. =Dalila Gait√°n Troya= On June 7, 1973, Brown left his job on the \\"Spanish Man\\" boat, and decided to go with a friend to the town of Col√≥n. After returning to Panam√° around 1:30 AM, he left his friend and began driving along Central Avenue, passing by the National Bank. At 2:00 AM, he noticed a woman walking in the direction of the Economic Development Institute (now the Agricultural Development Bank), but decided to simply move along. He continued down the intersection, turned to the old Canal Zone (the current location of the Judicial Police) and left through a street to Gorgas Hospital, opposite the \\"Anc√≥n Inn\\" bar and old \\"Great Morrison\\" warehouse. However, Brown then changed his mind, and decided to go after the woman from before. He found the woman, 22-year-old prostitute Dalila Gait√°n Troya (AKA Delilah Gayt√°n Troya), on the Los M√°rtires Avenue, and began caressing her. Brown led her to an apartment in the Transistmica and gave her $15 in advance for her services, but, because of his impotence, he had erection problems. Dalila wanted to finish quickly and mocked Brown, angering him in the process. He asked her to give the money back, as he felt he shouldn't pay just to see her in her underwear, but she refused and slapped him. Immediately after, Silvano punched her in the jaw, and Dalila slumped on the bed. She got up, but was hit again and had her client wrap his hands around her neck, strangling her. When she was \\"more or less still\\", Brown took her sweater and wrapped it tightly around her neck. He then proceeded to put on his pants, wash the bloodied sheets and pillows in the sink, and then pick up the body. He put Dalila's corpse in the backseat of his car, and drove to the street next to the Paris Garden, throwing away the woman's wallet and shoes onto a nearby bridge. While on the road leading to a Bah√°'√≠ temple in the San Miguelito District, Brown stopped the car, undressed Dalila's corpse and pushed it onto the road, where it was later found by a couple who were passing by. =Rose Mar√≠a G√≥mez Orlas= Only eight days after the last encounter, Brown met up with another prostitute, 23-year-old Colombian Rose Mar√≠a G√≥mez Orlas (AKA Rosa Mar√≠a G√≥mez). He took her to the same place as Dalila, but yet again had difficulties with his impotence. Despite this, Rose agreed to go for a walk with him and return later. However, he had problems the second time as well, which ended in the woman teasing him. The now-angered Brown began hitting her in the face, before eventually strangling her with his bare hands. To make sure she was dead, he tied the sash she was wearing around her neck. Like the previous murder, Brown undressed the deceased prostitute in order to prevent her identification, and abandoned her body in the forest, near a road connecting Chilibre and the Transistmica from the old Canal Zone. Her body was found on June 19, 1973. Capture, confessions and imprisonment The National Research Department (DE-NI), then led by Dar√≠o Arosemena, quickly connected the two murders due to the similar circumstances. Only ten days after Rose's murder, Silvano Ward Brown was detained by the authorities, after they found the Rose's sash in the back of his car. He soon confessed in detail to his crimes, including the murder he committed at 18 years old. His story was published in an article by the newspaper 'Cr√≠tica, dated June 29, 1973 and titled \\"Confessions of a strangler\\". In a subsequent psychiatric examination, Brown was determined to be a cold and calculated individual, with a high IQ. He was also diagnosed as an amoral psychopath, mixed with a perverse sexual psyche, whose condition led him to act out his frustration in a violent and murderous way. He was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment in Model Jail, and was released after serving out his sentence on June 24, 1993. Brown now works as a security guard, and lives with relatives in the nation's capital.

The khlong was canalized in accordance with the orders of King Prasat Thong in the middle of the late Ayutthaya period to create a shortcut route of the Chao Phraya River. Its history is similar to Khlong Bangkok Yai and Khlong Bangkok Noi in Bangkok, in that the shortcut route's completion caused the original course of the Chao Phraya River to be reduced to only a khlong. Khlong Om Non is currently a waterway that is separated from the Chao Phraya River at Mueang Nonthaburi District, then enters Bang Yai District to the south to Khlong Bang Kruai, and then flows into the Chao Phraya River in Bang Kruai District (this phase is called Khlong Bang Kruai), with a total length of 17.5 km (10.9 mi). It is regarded as one of main watercourses of Nonthaburi Province, besides the Chao Phraya River. Originally, the province was called \\"Ban Talat Khwan\\" (‡∏ö‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏ï‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏î‡∏Ç‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏ç) and was a Bangkok's outpost. Later, in 1549‚Äì1550 during the reign of King Maha Chakkraphat, after many people evacuated from Ayutthaya Kingdom to settle here, the king established two new towns together and renamed them \\"Nonthaburi\\" for Ban Talat Khwan and \\"Sakhon Buri\\" for Ban Tha Chin (now Samut Sakhon Province). In 1665‚Äì1666 during the reign of King Narai the Great, the king ordered the construction of twin wooden forts on the khlong mouth, named \\"Pom Thapthim\\" (‡∏õ‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏°) on the left side and \\"Pom Kaeo\\" (‡∏õ‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°‡πÅ‡∏Å‡πâ‡∏ß) on the right side, along with the movement of the capital district of Nonthaburi to the left side of the khlong (west side of Chao Phraya River) and the construction of a city pillar shrine. The capital district would be moved twice in the Rattanakosin period (at present, it is the Old Nonthaburi Provincial Hall, adjacent to Nonthaburi Pier). Its name \\"Khlong Om Non\\", means \\"Nonthaburi roundabout canal\\", referring to its course. Other names that have been used include Khlong Om (‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°), Maenam Om (‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°), and Khlong Maenam Om (‡∏Ñ‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏≠‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏°) etc. Currently, Khlong Om Non is another cultural tourism route, as well as other nearby khlongs. The two sides are filled with many tourist attractions such as many ancient temples and antique wooden traditional Thai houses or durian estates with eateries.

He developed a sub-speciality interest in breast surgery and was one of the pioneers in the UK of screening for breast cancer. He served as president of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1991 to 1994.  Early life  He was born in 1927 in Annan, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, His father Frederick Charles Boulter was a civil engineer, and his mother was Flora Victoria (n√©e Black). He was educated initially at King‚Äôs College School, Wimbledon. When his parents moved to Carlisle he attended Carlisle Grammar School, which had close links to Carlisle Cathedral and subsequently became Trinity School. While at school he developed a love of the outdoors and walking, hill climbing and mountaineering were to become pastimes which he continued to enjoy for the rest of his life. His decision to study medicine was influenced by a visit to the operating theatre in the local hospital. He began medical studies at Guy's Hospital Medical School but these were interrupted when he was called up for National Service, with the King's Own Scottish Borderers. Because of his medical connections he was seconded to the Royal Army Medical Corps working in the operating department, mainly in Colchester Hospital in Essex. While waiting to return to his medical studies at Guy's, he worked at the Cumberland Infirmary, Carlisle, where his admiration for the surgeon Bill McKechnie decided him to pursue a career in surgery. After completing his studies in London, in 1955 he graduated MB BS with honours in both medicine and surgery and won both the University of London gold medal and the Royal College of Surgeons of England Handcock prize.  Surgical career  After house officer posts at Guy's Hospital he became a lecturer in anatomy at Guy‚Äôs l Medical School. He became a Fellow of the Royal Colleges of England and Edinburgh in 1958. His surgical training was at the Middlesex Hospital and Guy‚Äôs Hospital training under Sir Hedley Atkins. He became a consultant general surgeon at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford in 1962 developing a sub-speciality interest in endocrinology and breast cancer. His unit pioneered a screening programme for breast cancer in south-west Surrey in 1978, which became known as the Guildford Breast Screening Project. This involved recruiting around 100 volunteers to encourage women to participate. In 1983 they reported the results on over 24,000 women who took part. The Guildford centre was one of seven that took part in the first major multicentre UK trial of screening for breast cancer. The results of this trial were an important part of the evidence presented in the Forrest Report (1986) which led to the setting up of the UK national breast cancer screening programme 1988, the first such national breast screening programme in the world. Boulter took a particular interest in training young surgeons not only from Britain but from around the world. He was a prime mover in the establishment of the Guildford Postgraduate Centre which opened in 1964.  Honours and awards  He was made honorary professor in surgical science at the University of Surrey at Guildford. The university awarded him the honorary degree of doctor of the university (D Univ) in 1996. He was awarded honorary fellowships by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and the South African and Hong Kong College of Surgeons.  Family  He married Patricia Mary Eckersley (n√©e Barlow) in 1946. They had two daughters, Jennifer and Anne. He retired to the Lake District, close to Penrith, where he died on 30 November 2009.

The Cairo Institute for Human Right Studies also came under fire on a number of occasions, notably for having reportedly received foreign funding. According to the newspaper Egypt Today, the Cairo Institute for Human Rights Studies accepted funding from foreign states to publish false reports about the situation in Egypt and support the Muslim Brotherhood.

Slave trade  The illegal capturing and transporting of slaves was made as a bet to see if Meaher could avoid the 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves. Meaher reportedly described the bet as \\"a thousand dollars that inside two years I myself can bring a shipful of niggers right into Mobile Bay under the officers' noses.\\" Meaher sold some of the slaves but took the rest to work for his brother James and himself. Meaher burned the ship to try and hide the evidence of his lawbreaking. The slaves were freed in 1865, but Timothy Meaher refused to help them return home or provide reparations. He sold them some land where they created the slave colony of Africatown. The United States government attempted to charge Meaher, but due to factors such as difficulty proving the crime and the Civil War, he was never prosecuted. However in 1890, two years before his death, Meaher bragged in a newspaper interview about his slave trading. Death and legacy Timothy Meaher died on 3 March 1892 in Mobile, Alabama.

The Head Office of the Hanumanthanagar Cooperative Bank (which has many branches in Bangalore) is also located here. Temples in Hanumanthanagar =Ramanjaneya Gudda Temple= This Temple is located atop Ramanjaneya Gudda (Ramanjaneya Hill) adjacent to the Kengal Hanumanthaiah Kalaa Soudha and the Hanumanthanagar Park. =Kumaraswaamy Temple= This temple to Lord Kumaraswaamy is located on the top of a hill, with stairs going all the way up, known as Mount Joy. Special prayers are performed during \\"Subbaraaya (Subramannya) Shasti\\". Adjoining Lord Kumaraswamy are a sacred Shiva Linga, Lord Ganesha in a seated posture and Goddess Parvathi. Also have been consecrated the Navagrahas, in a separate shrine, within the same hall, adjoining the sanctum sanctorum. The Gopuram at the entrance precedes a huge hall and the sanctum sanctorum has a sculpted idol in the Lord's image of his role as a Guru to Lord Shiva himself. This is identical to Swamimalai (Swamimalai is one of the six pilgrimage centers or Aru Padai Kshetram dedicated to Lord Subramanya and it is at Swamimalai that the Lord Kumaraswamy became the Guru to His own father, the Lord Shiva himself), in Thanjavur, Tamil Nadu. In the past, the sanctum sanctorum had a panchaloha (made of five metals) idol. The granite idol seen and worshipped now is of much later origin. The original panchaloha idol is now seen enshrined separately in the hall preceding the main hall - having the sanctum sanctorum. =Panchamukhi Ganesha temple= At the foot of the hill is the Panchamukhi Ganesha temple. This temple has an idol of Lord Ganesha with five heads, hence the name Panchamukhi Ganesha. His vahana here is different from the usual Mooshika Vahana. Here, His vahana is a Simha (lion). The dominance of the negative, false EGO, that corrupts the mind, is depicted by the lion. Lord Ganesha, in this Panchamukhi form of His, is worshipped to win over the EGO. Since no trick, courage or bravery, whatsoever, of such a mind and the associated negative and false EGO, that corrupts the mind, succeeds in its war against Lord Ganesha, this form of His (also synonymous with the name Vakratunda Mahaganapathi), is worshipped for victory and a calm, balanced & composed state of body, mind and soul.

Tye is currently a Professor Emeritus (2015) at Cornell University and a visiting professor at the Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. She is married to Henry Sze- Hoi Tye and is the mother of Kay Tye and Lynne Tye.  Early life and education  Tye was born and raised in Hong Kong where she attended St. Stephen's Girls‚Äô College from kindergarten through high school. She then obtained a full scholarship to pursue undergraduate studies in chemistry at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, USA and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1969. Upon graduation, Tye moved to California to complete an M.Sc. in biochemistry at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) supervised by Cho Hao Li (ÊùéÂçìÁöì). Following her master's in 1971, Tye pursued Ph.D. training in genetics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the joint mentorship of David Botstein and Joel Huberman. In 1974, Tye was awarded the Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Research Fellowship with which she pursued further research training in molecular genetics under the supervision of Bob Lehman at Stanford University until 1977. Her postdoctoral work on DNA replication lead to the discovery of short Okazaki fragments generated during aberrant DNA repair in E.coli.  Career and research  After Tye's foundational contributions to the field of prokaryotic DNA replication while at Stanford University she moved to Ithaca, New York and started her own laboratory at Cornell University in 1977. In her independent career, Tye began forging new discoveries surrounding DNA replication in eukaryotes, an understudied area at the time. Tye took a genetic approach to isolate mutants that regulate DNA replication which led to her identification of the minichromosome maintenance (MCM) genes in yeast in 1984. She specifically identified the MCM2, MCM3, MCM5 and MCM10 genes in yeast. Her findings together with the identification of the origin recognition complex (ORC) by Bell and Stillman in 1992 generated substantial momentum in the field of eukaryotic DNA replication. Tye's contributions to the field continued throughout her tenure at Cornell. Throughout the 1990s, Tye functionally characterized the components of eukaryotic DNA replication machinery. At Cornell, Tye mentored numerous graduate students, was the associate chair of the Department of Biochemistry, Molecular, and Cell Biology, directed the Genetics and Development Graduate Studies Program, and finally received her Emerita status in 2015 for her contributions to the Cornell community. More recently, Tye began a visiting professorship at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology where she began to address a large gap in the field: the lack of high-resolution structures for ORC and MCM. To place genetic and biochemical DNA replication data into structural context, Tye began using cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to identify the structures of these molecular complexes at near-atomic resolution. She helped determine the high resolution structures of the MCM complexes in 2015 and ORC in 2018.  Selected publications  # Maine, G. T., Sinha, P. & Tye, B. K.

It runs from its junction with High Road, Beeston in Beeston Square to the Hop Pole public house. History The road was constructed as part of the Sawley to Nottingham turnpike road. In around 1820 a local farmer Edward Bonds built Bonds House which later became The Grange, Beeston. It is now Grade II listed. In 1878 a police station was opened on the north side of the road where it remained until the 1970s when it moved into The Grange which is almost opposite. The road underwent commercial and residential development from the 1880s. The most significant landmark constructed is Beeston Methodist Church which was built between 1900 and 1902 and stands on the south side of the road. Until the merger of all four methodist churches in Beeston in 2014, it was known as Chilwell Road Methodist Church. The western end of the road is marked outside the Hop Pole public house where the street sign is adjacent to that for High Road, Chilwell. The northern western side of the road is bounded by two conservation areas in Beeston: the St John's Grove, Beeston and the Cottage Grove estate. In between this is the Imperial Park estate which meets Chilwell Road at its junction with Imperial Road. Between 2012 and 2015, almost the entire length of the road was reconstructed as part of the extension of Nottingham Express Transit. Chilwell Road tram stop was constructed at the west end of the road and services started on 25 August 2015. Notable buildings =North side= 24\\\\.

Vanitha was also involved in the successful Mangalyaan mission to Mars in 2013. = Chandrayaan-2 = Vanitha was promoted from associate director to project director for ISRO's Chandrayaan-2 lunar mission. She is the first woman to lead an interplanterary mission at the ISRO. She is also the first woman project director at ISRO. Previous Chandrayaan-1 project director, Mylswamy Annadurai, who convinced her to take on the role, said that her data handling, team management and problem solving skills made her the ideal person for this position. Vanitha's responsibilities include ensuring complete oversight of the development and implementation of all systems and acting as a point of authority for the project. The launch successfully occurred on 22 July 2019. Unlike Chandrayaan-1, aimed to land a probe on the Moon surface rather than orbit around it.  Awards and honours  Vanitha received an award for Best Woman Scientist by the Astronomical Society of India in 2006. She was also noted as one of five scientists to watch by Nature in 2019.

A wide variety of revenue stamps have since been issued, including numerous provincial and local issues. China's first revenue stamps, the Red Revenues, were ordered by the Chinese Imperial Customs in 1896. Around 600,000 revenue stamps with a denomination of 3¬¢ were ordered from Waterlow and Sons in London, but they were not issued due to opposition from corrupt customs officials and political leaders. The stamps were stored by the Shanghai Customs Statistical Department, and in 1897 they were overprinted with various new denominations for use as postage stamps. In 1899, another series of revenue stamps was ordered. It had denominations of 20, 100 and 1000 cash and it was printed by the American Bank Note Company, but once again local opposition prevented the stamps' issue. Another issue consisting of six values (2, 10, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 cash) was authorized by the imperial government in 1907, but provincial governors opposed its issue and the stamps only exist unused. Following the Xinhai Revolution, some of the unissued stamps from 1899 were issued with \\"Republic of China\\" overprints. In 1912, the Republic issued a new series of revenue stamps depicting the Great Wall of China with denominations of 1¬¢, 2¬¢, 10¬¢, 50¬¢ and $1. This series remained in use until the 1920s, and many printing variations exist. A number of provincial, local and private overprints exist on this issue. Between 1926 and 1928, the so- called \\"Wheat series\\" of revenue stamps was issued, incorporating the name of each province in the design. A series depicting the Chinese flag on a map was issued in 1927. Many overprints exist on these issues as well. In addition, some provinces issued their own designs of revenue stamps. A set of stamps depicting the Liuhe Pagoda was issued between 1934 and 1944. In 1940, during the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Japanese government issued revenue stamps depicting the Temple of Heaven in Beijing for use in occupied areas. Meanwhile, between 1938 and 1944 the Nationalist government issued stamps depicting H. H. Kung, Chiang Kai-shek, Lin Sen and Sun Yat-sen for use in its territory. Various other designs of revenue stamps were used throughout the 1940s, including a flag over globe design, stamps depicting the Zhengyangmen and Fu Hsing gates, and stamps showing farming equipment. In 1946, the so- called \\"Transportation series\\", depicting various forms of land, sea and air transport, was issued. Various printings of these stamps exist, and they were also overprinted for postal use. China also issued stamps for specific uses, such as consolidated tax, judicial and commodity taxes. The latter included stamps for taxes on cigarettes, tobacco, alcohol and fuel.

It has no outlet to the sea and contains large areas of desert or semi-arid land. It is one of two basins in southern Libya on the northern flanks of the Tibesti Mountains in the central Sahara desert, the other being the Kufra Basin, further to the east. Formation The Fazzan Basin is situated on the junction between two tectonic plates. Collision between these occurred in the Paleozoic period and caused thickening of the earth's crust, which then downwarped under its own weight to form a depression in the ground, the Fazzan Basin. Since then, there has been a deposition of \\"continental intercalaire\\" and other continental rocks, and large quantities of water have been trapped in underground aquifers. An outcrop of basalt occurs between the Fazzan and the Kufra Basins, and both are overlaid by sand. The climate of this region has varied greatly in the past, with pluvial and dry periods alternating; the current arid phase averages less than of precipitation per year. During its geologic history, the Fazzan Basin has on at least four occasions during the Pleistocene been inundated with water to form a large lake. On each occasion, a thick layer of limestone was deposited. Armitage et al. (2007) estimated that two of these events occurred earlier than 400,000 years ago, another one was in MIS 11 (~400,000 years ago) and a further one in MIS 5 (between 130,000 and 80,000 years ago). Geye and Thiedig (2008) recognise further lake sedimentation periods in MIS 9 and MIS 7. They have also estimated that the lake extended to in MIS 11, and this was when it was at its maximum size. By MIS 5, the lake was reduced to and less than during the most recent iteration in the Holocene. However, Armitage et al. (2007), citing Brooks et al. (2003), put the Holocene lake area at . Although there is some disagreement about the exact timing and the size of Lake Megafazzan, both authorities agree that there has been no lacustrine activity between MIS 5 and the Holocene. The MIS 5 deposits include fossils of Cerastoderma glaucum, which indicates that the water was probably brackish. Lake Megafazzan During the Miocene, Libya was drained by two large rivers systems, both flowing into the Mediterranean Sea, the Wadi Nashu River in the west and the Sahabi River in the centre and east. In the late Miocene and early Messinian, increased volcanic activity in northeastern Libya resulted in the damming back of the Wadi Nashu, which caused water to accumulate in the Fazzan Basin, forming the proto-Lake Megafazzan during humid periods.

After winning one minor race as juvenile he improved to become one of the best middle-distance colts of his generation in Britain, winning the King Edward VII Stakes as well as finishing third in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As a four-year-old he won the Legacy Cup before recording his biggest success in the Canadian International Stakes. He raced without success in 2015 before being retired to become a breeding stallion in Ireland. Background Hillstar is a bay horse with a white blaze bred at the Rothschild family's Southcourt Stud near Leighton Buzzard in Bedfordshire. He raced in the colours of Evelyn de Rothschild and was sent into training with Michael Stoute at the Freemason Lodge Stables in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was ridden in most of his races by Ryan Moore. He was sired by Danehill Dancer, who won the Phoenix Stakes, National Stakes and Greenham Stakes before becoming a very successful breeding stallion. His other progeny have included Choisir, Mastercraftsman and Dancing Rain. Hillstar's dam Crystal Star won two races including the Radley Stakes and went on to become a very successful broodmare whose other foals have included Crystal Ocean, Crystal Capella (Princess of Wales's Stakes) and Crystal Zvezda (Fillies' Trial Stakes). Her dam Crystal Cavern was a half-sister to the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches winner Rose Gypsy. Racing career =2012: two-year-old season= Hillstar began his racing career by finishing fourth in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 31 August. At Leicester Racecourse on 16 October he started 2/1 favourite for a similar event and recorded his first success as he took the lead inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Flashlight. =2013: three-year-old season= Hillstar began his second campaign in handicap races, running second in events over ten furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse on April and Newbury Racecourse in May. At Royal Ascot on 21 June the colt was stepped up in class and distance for the Group 2 King Edward VII Stakes over one and a half miles and started the 15/2 third choice in the betting behind Battle of Marengo (winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial and fourth in the Epsom Derby) and the undefeated Mutashaded. After being restrained towards the rear of the field he made strong progress in the straight, overtook Battle of Marengo in the last 100 yards and won by a length. Michael Stoute commented \\"We had him in the Derby and we had him in the Irish Derby, but his first two runs this year just haven't gone right. At Newbury... he hit the gate too well and was too keen. We dropped him out today and made sure he didn't do that,but we've always loved this horse\\". Over the same course and distance five weeks later, Hillstar was moved up to the highest class and matched against older horses in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. As he had not been among the original entries for the race, his owners had to pay a supplementary entry fee of ¬£75,000. Starting at odds of 5/1 he stayed on well in the straight to take third place behind Novellist and Trading Leather, making him the best-placed of the four British-trained runners. His efforts earned him ¬£114,594, more than repaying his entry fee. In August, Hillstar was dropped back in distance for the ten and a half furlong International Stakes at York Racecourse and came home fourth of the six runners behind Declaration of War, Trading Leather and Al Kazeem. Richard Hughes took the ride in October when Hillstar ended his season by running sixth behind Farhh in Champion Stakes. In 2013 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Hillstar was given a rating of 118, making him the 83rd best racehorse in the world. =2014: four-year-old season= For his first run as a four-year-old Hillstar was sent to the United Arab Emirates and finished towards the rear of the field in the Dubai World Cup (won by African Story) on the synthetic Tapeta track at Meydan Racecourse in March. On his return to Europe he started odds-on favourite for the Ormonde Stakes at Chester Racecourse but was beaten by the six-year-old Brown Panther. Frankie Dettori took the ride for the colt's next two races which saw him run second to Telescope in the Hardwicke Stakes at Ascot and take the same position, a neck behind Cavalryman in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket. When dropped to Group 3 class for the Rose of Lancaster Stakes at Haydock Park in August he finished second for the fourth consecutive time as he was beaten a length and a quarter by the outsider Amralah. On 20 September Hillstar contested the Legacy Cup over eleven furlongs and Newbury and was made the 11/4 favourite in a seven-runner field, with his opponents including Tasaday (Prix de la Nonette), Cubanita (John Porter Stakes), Quest for Peace (Glorious Stakes) and Camborne (winner of the race in 2013). After racing just behind the leaders Hillstar moved up into second place in the straight behind Tasaday before going to the front a furlong out and kept on well to win by one and a half lengths. In October, Hillstar was sent to North America and started 5/4 favourite for the Grade I Canadian International Stakes at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto. Michael Stoute was unable to attend but expressed the hope that his brother Douglas, the Dean and Rector of the Toronto's Anglican Cathedral might bring the horse \\"good fortune\\". Hillstar's opponents included Big Blue Kitten, The Pizza Man, Dynamic Sky (Red Smith Handicap), Reporting Star (Play the King Stakes) and War Dancer (Virginia Derby), but the race went ahead without Brown Panther, who unseated his rider and bolted before the start. With Moore in the saddle, Hillstar raced in fifth place as Reporting Star and The Pizza Man set the early pace, but moved up on the outside in the straight to take the lead a furlong out. He opened up a clear advantage and held off the late challenge of Big Blue Kitten to win by three quarters of a length. Ryan Moore commented \\"this race was a target for the horse a long way out and it's always something we had in the back of our minds for him, if things were going well. I moved a bit too early today but he was the best horse and we just kept it straightforward.\\" In 2014 World's Best Racehorse Rankings Hillstar was given a rating of 117, making him the 105th best racehorse in the world. =2015: five-year-old season= Hillstar was kept in training as a five-year-old but failed to recapture his best form. In the summer of 2015 he finished fifth in both the Hardwicke Stakes and the Princess of Wales's Stakes before running sixth of the seven runners in the Glorious Stakes. He returned in autumn to finish fourth when attempting to repeat his 2014 success in the Legacy Cup. On 3 October he ended his racing career by finishing third behind the three-year- old Star Storm in the Cumberland Lodge Stakes at Ascot. Stud record After his retirement from racing Hillstar became a breeding stallion at the Garryrichard Stud in County Wexford, Ireland. His first foals were born in 2017.

She was built by Vyborg Shipyard in Russia and delivered to Rosmorport in 2015. Vladivostok, which represents a further development of the icebreakers Moskva and Sankt-Peterburg, has two identical sister ships: Murmansk and Novorossiysk.  Development and construction  In the 2000s, Russia began renewing the state-owned icebreaker fleet that, at the time, consisted mainly of Soviet-era vessels dating back to the 1970s and 1980s. In July 2004, the Saint Petersburg-based Baltic Shipyard won an international tender for the construction of two 16-megawatt diesel-electric icebreakers for Rosmorport, a state-owned company established in 2003 to manage Russia's port infrastructure and operate its fleet of diesel-powered icebreakers. These icebreakers, Moskva (delivered in 2008) and Sankt-Peterburg (2009), were the first non-nuclear icebreaker built in Russia for over three decades and the first new icebreakers ordered following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. In 2011, the Russian government decided to continue the fleet renewal within the framework of the federal program Development of the Transport System of Russia (2010‚Äì2020) with three additional 16-megawatt diesel-electric icebreakers. The construction of the first icebreaker awarded to the non-USC-affiliated Vyborg Shipyard on 2 December 2011. On 23 February 2012, the remaining two vessels were also contracted to Vyborg Shipyard which was acquired by the state-owned United Shipbuilding Corporation (USC) to solve the shipyard's financial problems. The new icebreakers, referred to as Project 21900M, represent a further development of the original Project 21900 design. Modifications to the original design include, among smaller general improvements, a slightly different diesel-electric power plant configuration and more efficient pulling-type propulsion units where the propeller is facing forward. While Project 21900M vessels were still sometimes referred to as \\"16-megawatt icebreakers\\", their propulsion power was increased to 18 megawatts. Externally, the most apparent difference is the helideck which has been moved to the foredeck and enlarged for the bigger Mil Mi-8 helicopter. The construction of the first Project 21900M icebreaker began at Vyborg Shipyard on 20 August 2012, a month ahead of schedule, and the keel laying ceremony was held on 17 October. Initially, the completed hull blocks were stored in the open while the shipyard was finalizing the construction of a semi-submersible barge Atlant that would be used for hull assembly and launching of the new icebreakers. The hull assembly began on 5 August 2013 and the vessel was launched on 29 April 2014. While the ceremonial flag raising was held in Saint Petersburg already on 23 September 2015, the acceptance certificate was not signed until 9 October when the icebreaker had successfully completed its sea trials. Like the preceding Project 21900 icebreakers, the new icebreakers are also named after major cities of Russia with the lead ship Vladivostok representing the largest Russian port city on the Pacific coast. Previously, the same naming scheme was also used for a series of five diesel-electric polar icebreakers built by the Finnish shipbuilder W√§rtsil√§ in the 1960s; the previous Vladivostok was in service in 1969‚Äì1992.  Design  Vladivostok is long overall and between perpendiculars, and has a moulded beam of . Fully laden, the icebreaker draws of water. While her official Russian Maritime Register of Shipping ice class is Icebreaker6, Vladivostoks hull and propulsion units are strengthened to meet the requirements for Icebreaker7, a higher ice class intended for icebreaking operations in the Arctic. Vladivostok has a fully integrated diesel-electric propulsion system with main diesel generators supplying power for both main propulsion as well as ship's service loads while underway. Her main power plant consists of four 12-cylinder W√§rtsil√§ 12V32E four-stroke medium-speed diesel engines rated at each. In addition, there are two W√§rtsil√§ 4L20 auxiliary diesel generators for use when the vessel is at port and a emergency diesel generator. For main propulsion, Vladivostok is fitted with two electrically driven azimuth thrusters. Her two Steerprop SP110ARCPULL Z-drive units, each driven by two electric propulsion motors in tandem configuration, were the most powerful mechanical azimuth thrusters in the world at the time of delivery. With a total propulsion power of , Vladivostok can achieve a service speed of in open water and break up to thick level ice. In addition, she has a transverse bow thruster for maneuvering.

Backer was a human rights activist who fought for Albanian national causes for much of her life. She published literature on Albanian family structures from studies conducted in the village of Isniq, in the Rugova valley of Kosovo. During her first visit to Albania in 1969, she became fascinated by the Albanians, and their culture and struggle for independence. She dedicated her research for a scholarly degree in social anthropology. Berit was fluent in Albanian. She published the book ‚ÄúBehind Stone Walls‚Äù, a social anthropological study of traditional Albanian society. It focuses on the formation and evolution of household and family structures among the Kosovo Albanians. It was written on the basis of fieldwork carried in the village of Isniq in western Kosovo in 1975. Backer died suddenly in 1993 after having been stabbed to death by a mentally disturbed person. John Halliday, editor of the memoirs of Enver Hoxha called her \\"an Albanian expert\\". In 2018, Kosovos prime minister Hashim Thaqi dedicated the Presidential Jubilee Award to the Backer family.  Background  Berit Backer was born on August 3, 1947 as the daughter of dedicated communist Ina Margrethe Danielsen and Norwegian allied war photographer Ola Friele Backer who had photographed the invading Germans in Bergen. They married shortly after the war. The father died suddenly one month later. Berit grew up in rough circumstances living in Kirkenes in northern Norway and moving several times. As the young daughter of a communist, Berit was sent to pioneer camps during summer vacations. She suffered bullying from other children which supposedly shaped her political views. After she finished secondary school she took a course at the Nansen School in Lillehammer in 1965‚Äì1966, and later, in the spring of 1968, she registered as a student at the University of Bergen. During the following years she studied statistics, social anthropology, philosophy and sociology. In opposition to her mother, Berit joined ranks with other young radicals towards the end of the sixties. Her interest in Albania was ignited when she visited the so-called ‚ÄúLighthouse of Socialism‚Äù for the first time in 1969.  Anthropological studies  Berit Backer became very popular amongst Albanian activists for her dedication working around the clock. Unable to visit Albania, she traveled to Kosovo in 1974‚Äì1975 being one of the first foreigners to conduct anthropological work. Her work was submitted as a master thesis for the Institute of Social Anthropology of the University of Oslo in April 1979. In 1982 she published a study of the self- reliance culture in Albania. At the time, Albania was the only country in the world without any debts. In 1990, Ann Christine Eek, a photographer at the University of Ethnographic Museum in Oslo, worked with Berit on an exhibition of Albanian culture in 1990 producing a book titled \\"Albanske tradisjoner\\" published in 1991. Between 1975 and 2007, Eek made journeys to former Yugoslavia together with Backer to study the rural life of villages. However the project had to be finished by Eek alone after Backer was killed. In 1992, Backer participated in a documentary film titled \\"The Albanians of Rrogam\\" in Rrogam and Thethi, Albania where she met villagers waiting for government officials to decide on the privatization of agricultural lands after the fall of communism. Berit stated in her studies that the Albanian old legal structures and rights to decide on family matters and feuds without state involvement was a characteristic which had enabled Albanians of Kosovo to survive Yugoslav oppression. She also writes that the rural ideal of a man in the village of Isniq was not someone who easily fell in love, as this was a sign of unreliability and immaturity, but rather someone who could keep women at a distance. Backer stated that in 1975 there were more Albanian girls in school than boys and that the 1981 economic crash forced women to be dependent on their husbands. Berit writes that the nus√´ does not move freely in the house she arrives at until years later.  Death  Backer was suddenly stabbed to death on Mars 7, 1993 in Norway by a 29-year old asylum seeking Kosovar Albanian man suffering from paranoia. The trial at the City Court of Oslo concluded that the perpetrator was mentally unstable and was sentenced to five years of preventive detention inside the psychiatric health service. He received citizenship in 2001. According to photographer Per Erik √Östr√∂m, who had been in a relationship with Berit, the perpetrator had murdered Berit at her home as a result of her work of abortion laws for Albanian migrant women in Norway. According to the police interrogation, he had been deeply offended by her immoral suggestions and that it was his duty to deliver a punishment. The police found the perpetrators body in 2013 in a lake.

She was regarded as very radical, and used confrontational language in her writing. She sold the paper to Catherine Michelle de Maisonneuve in 1763.

It was a national organization, with local branches all over the country. While the organization had the task to simply enforce the policy of King Zog I of Albania, this policy was, in fact, radical and progressive, as the Civil Code of 1928 secured women the right to equal inheritance, divorce, education and the right to work, as well as banning of arranged marriages, harems and the veil. It was under the protection of the queen mother Sadije Toptani, and its chairperson was Princess Senije Zogu. The task of this state woman's organisation was to support the official policy within women's rights rather than to act independently. The government policy was however radical, as the Civil Code of 1928 stated that women had equal right to inheritance and divorce, abolished arranged and forced marriage and polygamy and gave women the right to education and a professional life. Under Princess Senij√©, the Gruaja Shqiptare founded local branches in 20 cities, published its own paper and supported numerous projects in support of the regime's women's policy, especially regarding education. In reality, however, the work did not manage to achieve much success outside of the cosmopolitan elite of the cities and was in practice mostly of benefit to the upper class.

The church's mission is \\"To Learn, to Love, to Live the Word of God.\\"  History  The church began informally in 1890 as St. Andrews Mission, with support from All Saints Episcopal Church in nearby Pasadena. In 1905, a temporary structure was built on the corner of Monterey Road and Fremont Avenue, where the current church would be later built.  Building  The historic church was designed by chief architect Bertram Goodhue of Cram, Goodhue and Ferguson in a mix of Gothic Revival and Romanesque Revival architectural styles. The church is #33 on South Pasadena's list of historic landmarks. The stained glass windows were made by Judson Studios. In 1919, a $3,000 () addition was started, which included a stage and dressing rooms. The chimes were donated to the building by aviator Pancho Barnes, who, on January 5, 1921, had married Rev. C. Rankin Barnes at the church. The tower was damaged in the 1987 Whittier Narrows earthquake. When the tower was repaired and retrofitted to meet earthquake protection standards, the chapel's pillars were narrowed, which had been obstructing views of the front of the church from rear pews.  School  In 1968, the parish opened St. James' Episcopal School, then only an elementary school. The school relocated to St. Andrews Place in Los Angeles in 1981. The St. James' Parish Day School provides nursery, pre-kindergarten, and kindergarten schooling on the grounds of the main church.

It was the main women's suffrage organisation in Austria. History =Background= During of the Revolution of 1848, Karoline von Perin-Gradenstein founded the first Austrian women's association, the Wiener Demokratischer Frauenverein (Viennese Democratic Women's Association). However, in the aftermath of the violent suppression of the revolution, the political participation of women was forbidden and the club dissolved. With the Vereinsgesetz (Law on Associations) of 1867 political associations were allowed again, but its ¬ß30 discriminated against \\"foreigners, female persons and minors\\", which meant that women could officially only participate in charitable or educational societies. After the Revolution of 1848, a minority of women who owned significant property or a business had been given the right to vote in some local municipalities, and from 1861 also for the , but not for the actual legislative assembly, the Imperial Council. However, even this fragmentary and incomplete right to vote was retracted between 1884 and 1904 in the wake of electoral reforms, which prompted renewed efforts by women to gain proper voting rights. In 1892, the Social Democratic Party of Austria included the demand for a general, equal and secret suffrage without distinctions based on gender in its party platform. Yet male party members often provided little support, and women's suffrage was generally deemed a goal of only minor importance. =Foundation= On 28 January 1893 Ottilie Turnau presided over the inaugural meeting of the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein in the Altes Rathaus, Vienna. Auguste Fickert was elected its first president, other important members were Rosa Mayreder as vice-president, Marie Lang and Marianne Hainisch. =Early Years= Although associations were forbidden by law from being politically active,See section \\"Background\\". individual persons were not, which allowed Auguste Frickert to call public gatherings on political topics. Through statements on contemporary issues such as maternity leave, prostitution, sexuality and women's suffrage, the A√ñFV contributed to the politization of women. From the middle of the 1890s, the club campaigned for a reform of marital and family law, and championed the issues of middle-class working women and female civil servants. In 1894, Therese Schlesinger joined and became an important participant. Between 1893 and 1897 the monthly party paper Das Recht der Frau (The right of the woman) was published with the help of liberal politician and his Voksstimme (The people's voice). In 1899 the association published their own journal, the Dokumente der Frauen (Documents of the women), which put a major focus on the suffragette issue. After a fallout between Fickert and Mayreder and their associate Marie Lang, publication was ceased, and the new paper became Neue Frauenleben (New lives of women) which was circulated between 1902 and 1918. =Cooperation and Conflict= In 1902, several Austrian women's associations joined to form the (still extant) umbrella organization (Federation of Austrian women's associations), and the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein became a member. But Auguste Fickert demanded that the A√ñFV be represented in the new organization's executive committee, and wrote critical articles for the Neue Frauenleben, in which she accused the B√ñFV of being too unpolitical. Already in 1895, on initiative from Fickert a consulting service called Rechtsschutzstelle had been established in Vienna, which gave (especially poor and unmarried) women pro bono legal advice. Originally this counseling was done in Fickert's private home, but later the city of Vienna allowed the use of an office in a public building; by 1901 the service operated from three separate places, and a year later it had grown so much that it was organized as its own section of the A√ñFV. Also in 1902, the Beamtinnensektion (Section for female civil servants) lead by Ida Meyer was founded, which aimed to represent women who ‚Äì due to their work in civil service ‚Äì were not included in the \\"working class\\" notion of socialist organizations. These included primarily postwomen and later female operators of telegraphs. Brewing dissent between the A√ñFV and the B√ñFV escalated when in January 1906 the latter founded a new association in direct competition to the A√ñFV's Beamtinnensektion, the Reichsverein der Post- und Telegraphenmanipulantinnen und Posthilfsbeamtinnen (Imperial association of mailwomen and female telegraph operators and auxiliary mailwomen). This prompted the A√ñFV to leave the umbrella organization, which in turn resulted in the protest and resignation of 24 members of the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein, amongst them Marianne Hainisch. This has been interpreted as a split between a moderate (B√ñFV) and radical (A√ñFV) wing of Austria's women's movement. =Final Years= Auguste Fickert died in 1910, and the presidency was left vacant at first, with Mathilde Hanzel-H√ºbner sharing the vice-presidency with Sofie Regen. Although Jewish women had previously held important positions within the association, in the wake of the First World War, antisemitic discussions ensued related to Leopoldine Kulka (who was opposed to antisemitism) and her wish to succeed Fickert. The war at first halted most suffragette efforts, and it was not until 1916 that women returned to campaigning, and it took another year until women's associations held meetings again. The issue of pacifism was controversial, as pacifist activities were forbidden; but the A√ñFV - unlike other women's associations - adhered to its anti-war principles. Already in 1915 Leopoldine Kulka and had participated at the Peace Congress if The Hague, and in 1917 yet another section of the A√ñFV was founded called the Friedenspartei (Peace party) led by Elsa Beer-Angerer, which pleaded for an end of the war. On 12 November 1918, after the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the Republic of German-Austria was proclaimed, which granted active and passive suffrage to all adult citizens regardless of gender. This meant that women's suffrage had finally been achieved in Austria. Possibly as a result, in 1919 the Allgemeiner √ñsterreichischer Frauenverein was dissolved. Still, several members continued their political activities on an international level, for example within the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. Goals The association's primary aim was to enable women to participate in the improvement of the society, which included general welfare, the school system, and demilitarization. The right for women to vote was seen as a means to reach these goals.

In Revista Faces de Eva. Estudos sobre a Mulher, n.¬∫ 15, Lisboa: Faculdade de Ci√™ncias Sociais e Humanas da Universidade Nova de Lisboa. Early developments The first attempt to found a Women‚Äôs Council in Portugal was at the beginning of the 20th century, when Carolina Micha√´lis de Vasconcelos endeavoured to \\"bring together some ladies who speak English - and who wish to collaborate in the feminist movement\\" in order to meet a visiting Canadian feminist, Sophia Sanford. The idea was to try to form a National Council of Portuguese women, but the meeting was unsuccessful. Subsequently, the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas (CNMP) was founded on 30 May 1914, at the initiative of the politician and writer, Magalh√£es Lima, and the activist and gynecologist Adelaide Cabete, who was appointed president. Carolina Micha√´lis de Vasconcelos was invited to be honorary president. Aims of the Council The official bulletin of the Council, published in November 1914, stated that it aimed \\"to bring together, in a large association, all the associations and female groups that are spread throughout the country\\", putting an end to \\"alienation from the international feminist world\\". Its main objectives were the improvement of the legal situation of women in the family and in the State; the right to votes for women; the end of trafficking and exploitation of women; the improvement of public health; the defence of the rights of pregnant women and women who had recently given birth; and the protection of disadvantaged and abused women and children. Despite the Council‚Äôs apolitical approach, the fact that several prominent members of the Republican League of Portuguese Women, which advocated the overthrow of the monarchy, were part of the CNMP prevented the participation of more conservative, and, in general, more affluent women. As a consequence, the organization was short of funds and its headquarters, for most of its existence, were in the doctor‚Äôs office of Adelaide Cabete and her sister, Maria Braz√£o in Lisbon. However, in 1914 and 1915, there were fifteen affiliated associations. Activities To celebrate the tenth anniversary of its foundation, the Council organized the First Feminist and Education Congress in Lisbon in May 1924, which was inaugurated by the President of the Republic, Manuel Teixeira Gomes. Twenty-five papers were presented, 17 by women. The proposals made in the presentations were very advanced for the time, such as that the working woman should be entitled to a month of maternity leave; sex education should be given in schools; equal pay should be given for equal positions; women should have the vote; and that married women and men should have the same legal status. In the following year representatives of the Council spoke at several international conferences. The successful first Lisbon congress led to the decision to hold another in 1928, which discussed issues such as coeducation in primary schools, votes for women, and the need to ensure that a woman who became pregnant would not be sacked. Throughout its life the Council communicated with its members through a bulletin. Initially known simply as the Bulletin of the Portuguese Women‚Äôs National Council, its name was changed to Alma feminina (The Feminine Soul) in 1917. It was changed again to A Mulher (The Woman) in 1946. The magazine was mainly concerned with publicizing the association's activities and initiatives promoted by international feminist and female organizations, as well as informing readers about the situation of women and the state of feminism in other countries. In 1930, on the initiative of journalist Maria Lamas, the council organised an \\"Exhibition of Female Work, ancient and modern, of a literary, artistic and scientific nature\\", with the support of the newspaper O S√©culo. The purpose of the exhibition was to give visibility to the work of women from all over the country. Its success raised the profile of the CNMP. However, during the 1930s and 1940s, with the emergence of women's associations associated with the authoritarian Estado Novo government, the Council faced challenges as the State wanted women‚Äôs organizations that it could control. Closure Although Adelaide Cabete lived in Portuguese Angola from 1929 to 1934, she continued to serve as president. On Cabete‚Äôs death in 1935 Sara Beir√£o was elected president. She was followed by Isabel Cohen von Bonhorst in 1942, and Maria Lamas in 1945. In 1947, after holding the successful \\"Exhibition of Books Written by Women\\" at the Great Hall of Fine Arts at the University of Lisbon, the Conselho Nacional das Mulheres Portuguesas was banned by the Estado Novo and had to immediately cease its operations. Nevertheless, many of the Council‚Äôs members continued to work to promote the rights of and better living conditions for Portuguese women, joining other associations that had not been banned.

Initially part of a monastery, St Martin's later became a collegiate church under the jurisdiction of the diocese of Burgos. The existing church was built in the early 12c in the Romanesque style. Surviving remains of some mozarabic arches and windows located on the northern wall of the cloister suggest an earlier foundation, probably around the 10c.Fundaci√≥n Santa Mar√≠a la Real, Enciclopedia del Rom√°nico en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Cantabria - pp 1426-1433 The building The building follows the standard Romanesque style with a single rounded apse on the eastern side and a basilical nave of remarkable height. The exterior of the apse is divided into three panels by two decorative columns. The cornice is decorated with a set of corbels carved with animal heads, human figures and abstract motifs. The entrance to the church is placed on the western fa√ßade. It is decorated with a semi-circular arch which is supported on columns with capitals carved with vegetal motifs. The bell tower is of circular shape and is attached to the southern wall of the building.Fundaci√≥n Santa Mar√≠a la Real, Enciclopedia del Rom√°nico en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Cantabria - pp 1426-1433 The interior Interior The apse is decorated with blind arcades on two levels. The lower arcade is composed of four semi-circular arches while the upper one has been decorated with five arches, also semi-circular. The capitals are all sculpted but have suffered damage. The apse retains traces of Romanesque paintings, where two figures looking frontally, probably apostles, can be identified; the only surviving example in the province of Cantabria. The large rounded capitals that sit on top of the four columns supporting the cupola are decorated with carvings of remarkable quality. One of the capitals represents Daniel among the lions and a second capital seems to depict Samson fighting a lion. A third capital displays passages of the Adoration of the Magi and the Massacre of the Innocents. A fourth one is decorated with cone pines and another scene shows lions devouring human figures.Fundaci√≥n Santa Mar√≠a la Real, Enciclopedia del Rom√°nico en la Pen√≠nsula Ib√©rica, Cantabria - pp 1448-1453 The cloister The cloister is located west of the church and was built in the 16c in a simple Renaissance style.

He was the managing director of the Old American Company between 1758 and 1779. David Douglass was a member of the British Theatre Company of John Moody, which became the first permanent theater company in Jamaica when they came to Kingston in 1746; they were given their first permanent playhouse in 'New Theatre' or King's Store on Harbour Street seven years later. Douglass became the manager of the company in 1749. He married Sarah Hallam Douglass, the director of the Old American Company, and took over as manager with his stepson Lewis Hallam Jr. as co-manager. He accompanied the Company when they returned to the Thirteen Colonies from Jamaica. Douglass had his limitations: one Alexander Graydon described him as \\"rather a decent than shining actor\\". However, he was a capable manager and he gave North America its first Falstaff and King John. In 1774, the Old American Company returned to Jamaica. When they returned to Jamaica, the old building, having been in disuse for many years, was no longer regarded sufficient. The Old American Company under Douglass successfully asked the colonial government for a new theater building, and the Kingston Theatre was inaugurated on the Parade area in 1775. They had great success in Jamaica.

There is a hagiographical account saying that he was originally a blacksmith. When he was 30, he constructed an iron chest for the king. When he brought it to the court, he saw the members of course sitting in admiration of a man. He asked who that man was, and he was told he was a scholar. Sakkaki expressed his desire to become a scholar, at which time he was told that he was too old. In response, he dedicated himself to learning. Ten years later, he was still struggling with his studies. Frustrated, he went into the mountains, looked at the rocks, and decided that his heart (in his era, considered the center of intellect) was not harder than the rocks, rededicated himself to his studies, and became a famous scholar.Sayyid Ali Akbar Sadaqat, Anecdotes for Reflection, Part 1, Ch. 6, citing the Persian- language work Dastan-e-Ma (Our Stories) In any case, it is recorded that he had connections with the state, in that he was said to have created a magical statue or image for the king at the time ('Ala al-Din Khwarazm-Shah) to use in his war against the 'Abbasid caliph al-Nasir.Isabel Miller, \\"Occult Science and the Fall of the Khwarazm-Shah Jalal al-Din\\", in Journal of the British Institute of Persian Studies, vol. 39, no. 1 (2001).

Career He returned to the Midwest and became a professor of chemical engineering at Pennsylvania State College, now Pennsylvania State University. In the late 1930s he passed fluorine gas through a carbon arc creating fluorocarbon. Results were published in 1938. In 1940, he was recruited to the Manhattan project by Harold Urey, a physical chemist with expertise in isotope separation, to help with uranium enrichment necessary to build a nuclear bomb. Simons's fluorocarbons turned out to be inert enough to withstand the corrosive effects of uranium hexafluoride and thus could be used as factory parts in the chemical array of sealants, gaskets or pipes, for example. Simons invented a method for the large-scale, industrial production of fluorocarbons. In September 1948, he presented a series of papers at a Fluorocarbon Symposium by the American Chemical Society. On 29 November 1948 he filed an application to patent the electrochemical process of making fluorine-containing carbon compounds with two others from the Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing Company, St. Paul, Minnesota, which he received on 22 August 1950. On 4 September 1951 he also received a patent for \\"Fluorocarbon acids and derivatives\\". In 1950 he left for the University of Florida, Gainesville, and by 1952, he was affiliated with the 3M sponsored \\"Fluorine Laboratories, State College, Pennsylvania\\" and the \\"Fluorine Research Center\\" at the University of Florida, Gainesville. It was there in 1954, when the first unclassified technical report on the preparation of Fluorine containing compounds was written for the Office of Naval Research. He retired in 1967. Personal life Simons was married to Eleanor May Simons and at the time of his death was survived by a daughter, Dorothy Lanning of Spencerville, Md., and a son, Robert W. Simons, of Gainesville. Work and legacy Simons is credited with discovering electrochemical fluorination, and the procedure was named \\"Simons process\\" after him. =Publications= *Joseph H. Simons and L.P. Block. 1937.

After graduating from the Chilocco Indian School and taking courses at the University of Arizona, she earned a degree from Oklahoma State University and began working as a teacher. After a six year stint working for Fine Arts Diversified, she returned to teaching in 1979 in Washington, Oklahoma. Primarily known as a painter, using watercolor or acrylic media, Fife-Stewart has also been involved in fashion design. Her works have been shown mostly in the southwestern United States and have toured South America. Having won numerous awards for her artworks, she was designated as a Master Artist by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in 1997. Early life Jimmie Carole Fife was born in 1940 in Dustin, Oklahoma to Carmen (n√©e Griffin) and James Fife. The oldest surviving child in her family of nine siblings. She was raised on her grandfather's allotment, bordering the Hughes County-Okfuskee County line. Fife came from a long line of artists and teachers. Her grandfather was a wood and stone carver, her father drew with colored pencils and chalks, and her mother, who was a teacher, created traditional crafts like medallions and quilts. Each of her siblings were involved with art. These included Bill, one time principal chief of the Muscogee Creek Nation; a carver and draftsman; Sharon, Phyllis and Sandy who founded the Fife Collection, Inc. and produced contemporary fashion using techniques and motifs of the Southeastern Woodlands peoples; and sister Robin Elaine, who produced embroidery. Fife attended the Graham School in Weleetka, Oklahoma and then from 1954 to 1958 was a student at Chilocco Indian School. Between 1960 and 1961, she attended the University of Arizona, studying in the Southwest Indian Art Project and graduated in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Oklahoma State University in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Career After her graduation, Fife began her career teaching in Dustin and started her graduate studies, eventually earning a master's degree in Education. Teaching for six years in Oklahoma and Texas, she moved to Oklahoma City, where from 1972 to 1978 she worked for Fine Arts Diversified. Fife married Robert N. Stewart and in 1979 the couple settled in Washington, Oklahoma, where she returned to teaching and continued with her art. The couple had two daughters, Kelley and Maya Stewart, who has collaborated with her mother and is a fashion accessories designer. In 1968, when Fife won an award at the Annual Five Civilized Tribes Museum Art Show, the fact that a woman had won, inspired Virginia Stroud (Keetoowah Cherokee/Muscogee Creek) to team up with Mary Adair (Cherokee Nation), Jean Bales (Iowa), Joan Brown (Cherokee descent), Sharron Ahtone Harjo (Kiowa), Valjean McCarty Hessing (Choctaw), Ruthe Blalock Jones (Shawnee/Peoria), and Jane McCarty Mauldin (Choctaw) to support each other and their work. Stroud credited Fife with motivating the group's Daughters of the Earth exhibition, curated by Doris Littrell, which traveled for three years (1985‚Äì1988) and toured in the United States and Europe. While she was teaching, Fife-Stewart participated in various art shows including venues like the Scottsdale National Indian Art Exhibition, exhibitions of the U.S. Department of the Interior, and was one of the 28 artists selected by the International Communications Bureau to tour throughout South America. She and her sisters have also participated in the Santa Fe Indian Market. Fife- Stewart's preferred media are acrylic paints, watercolors, or pen and ink drawings. Though most known for her Flatstyle paintings, since the 1970s, she has also collaborated with her sisters in the Fife Collection. Their work was featured in a month-long exhibit at the Southern Plains Indian Museum in Anadarko, Oklahoma in 1979 and she and Phyllis exhibited their fashion designs in 1981 at the Indian Paintbrush Gallery in Siloam Springs, Arkansas. She and Phyllis also were featured artists in a production of the Creek Nation Communication Department and KOED television, The Folklore of the Muscogee People released in 1983. In 2019, Fife-Stewart was one of the artists featured in the Five Civilized Tribes Museum's Women of the Five Civilized Tribes exhibition. Along with her sister Phyllis, the works of Fife-Stewart and Joan Hill (Muscogee Creek/Cherokee), Joan Brown (Cherokee descent), Yvonne Cannon (Chickasaw/Choctaw), Joan Stone Hansen, Joan Hill (Muscogee Creek/Cherokee), Barbara McAlister (Cherokee Nation), Victoria McKinney (Echota Cherokee), Kitty Millar (Choctaw), Traci Rabbit (Cherokee Nation), Jeanne Rorex-Bridges (Echota Cherokee), Virginia Stroud (Cherokee/Muscogee Creek), Dana Tiger (Muscogee Creek/Seminole/Cherokee) and MaryBeth Timothy (Cherokee Nation) were featured. Fife-Stewart's 1968 work, New Barber is in the permanent collection of the Philbrook Museum of Art in Tulsa, Oklahoma. She has works in the permanent collections of the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in Muskogee, Oklahoma and her 1977 painting, The Earth is Our Mother, is part of the holdings of the Daybreak Star Cultural Center in Seattle. Among her many awards, Fife-Stewart won the Grand Prize at the 9th Annual Five Civilized Tribes Museum Art Show in 1975 and took First Place in the 11th Annual of 1977. In 1985, she was inducted into the Chilocco Indian School's Hall of Fame. Fife-Stewart was designated as a \\"Master Artist\\" by the Five Civilized Tribes Museum in 1997. The designation is the highest honor bestowed by the museum and artists must be nominated and judged. Only 35 artists had earned the designation through 2008, which allows them to participate in the Masters Art Show held annually.

Soldiers of the British Indian Army wearing Slade- Wallace Equipment in 1900. Valise Equipment, Pattern 1888 (also known as Slade-Wallace Equipment) was a leather harness used by the British Armed Forces. History The equipment was designed in 1888 by Colonel Slade and Major Wallace for use with the first .303-inch calibre rifles, replacing the Valise Equipment, Pattern 1870, which had entered service in 1871. The Slade- Wallace Equipment weighed , which was the lightest infantry equipment issued to British troops up to that time. The belts, straps and pouches were made from buff coloured leather, which was whitened with pipe clay; the haversack was made of white canvas, except for rifle regiments which had black. It was the standard equipment worn by British and Imperial infantry during the Second Boer War. It proved unsuitable for holding modern ammunition, because the pouches had been designed before the introduction of the clip charger which allowed for rapid reloading, and could only accommodate individual rounds. The leather also tended to deteriorate during long periods in the field. After the war, review of the British Army's performance was conducted by the 1903 Royal Commission on the War in South Africa, which heard evidence that the Slade- Wallace equipment was \\"cumbersome, heavy and badly balanced\\" and \\"an absurdity\\". As a stop-gap measure, the leather 1903 Bandolier Equipment was issued, but it quickly proved to be unsuitable for infantry use and was itself replaced by the 1908 Pattern Webbing. After the outbreak of the First World War, quantities of Slade-Wallace equipment sets were brought out of storage for the use of recruits in training, and was used on active service by some British colonial troops in the East African campaign. The whitened Slade- Wallace equipment continued to be worn for ceremonial duties by the Brigade of Guards until 1939, and other regiments in that era sometimes wore the whitened belt with Service Dress on formal occasions. Description The complete equipment consisted of: * one waistbelt * two pouches * a pair of braces with movable buckles and a keeper * two greatcoat straps * one mess tin strap * one valise The leather was coloured according to regiment. It was left buff and then coloured black for rifle regiments, and whitened on the outer surfaces for infantry regiments.

Her first novel, If You Leave Me, was named a best book of 2018 by The Washington Post, ALA Booklist, Literary Hub, Cosmopolitan, and others.  Life  Kim was born in Queens, New York, in 1987. Kim's parents immigrated from Korea, and she grew up visiting Korea often on her summer breaks. She has an MFA from Columbia University and an MSEd from Hunter College. She is a Teach For America alum and has taught elementary school, high school, and collegiate writing. She has lived in Chicago, and currently lives in Brooklyn, New York. Kim was very close to her grandmother growing up, whose stories have inspired her writing. In an interview with The Common, Kim says, \\"Growing up, I loved hearing about my parents‚Äô and grandparents‚Äô lives in Korea. I‚Äôm particularly close to my maternal grandmother, who helped raised me when I was young. Her stories about being a teenaged refugee during the Korean War‚Äîthe struggles, the uncertainty of life, the barriers placed upon women‚Äîalways stayed with me.\\"  If You Leave Me  Kim began working on the characters for her first book during her MFA program at Columbia University. \\"At first, I thought I was writing an interconnected short story collection that would span three generations, but in my last semester my teacher convinced me that I should write a novel about the first generation. I‚Äôm so glad I heeded his advice!\\" Kim told The Rumpus. If You Leave Me was published by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins, in August 2018.
