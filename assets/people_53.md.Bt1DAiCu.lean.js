Prior to that, he served as the Chief Pilot to six Heads of State in the Government of Uganda, from 1973 until 2012. Background and education Kiiza was born in Masindi District, in the Western Region of Uganda, circa 1944. After attending primary school, he was admitted to Masindi Secondary School (currently Kabalega Secondary School), where he completed his O-Level studies in 1965. That same year, he signed up at school, to join the Uganda Air Force. After recruitment, he attended basic training at Jinja, for about four months in 1966, before he transferred to Entebbe, to start flight school, in 1967. He first trained using a Piper PA-18 Super Cub, before graduating to a Fouga CM.170 Magister. In 1968, Kiiza was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant. Career He was then assigned to the VIP Transport Division, within the Uganda Army Air Force, using a Piper PA-23 aircraft. That is how he met Idi Amin, when the latter served as the Army Commander. Ali became Amin's personal pilot. In 1972, Ali saw combat during the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania border skirmish, when the Fouga Magister he was piloting was fired at by Ugandan exiles in Northern Tanzania. The bullet went through the co-pilot's seat, which was unoccupied at that time. He was awarded a Military Cross medal for his heroics. Also in 1972, Uganda acquired a Gulfstream II, for presidential travel. Kiiza, with three others were sent to FlightSafety Savannah Learning Center, in Savannah, Georgia, United States, to learn how to fly the Gulfstream. The other three were Andrew Mukooza, Paul Babula and Patrick Bogere. They continued their training at Vero Beach, Florida, where they acquired their commercial pilots licenses. Following training in the United States, Kiiza started to fly as co-pilot on the Gulfstream in 1974, with American pilots in control. In 1975, he flew the aircraft to Iraq, as captain for the first time. 1975 was a busy year for Kiiza. He undertook combat flight training in Iraq, under Russian instruction on Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 (MiG-21) fighter jets. He was then appointed the commander of the Uganda Army Air Force's MiG-21 unit, known as the \\"Supersonic Fighter Squadron\\". That same year, Uganda hosted the OAU Heads of State Summit, in Kampala. He piloted Yasser Arafat from Damascus, Syria to Entebbe, and then to Khartoum, Sudan. Also, General Yakubu Gowon, at that time the president of Nigeria, was overthrown while he was in Kampala, attending the OAU Summit. Amin tasked Kiiza to fly Gowon to Lom√©, Togo, where he went into exile. By 1978, Kiiza had risen to lieutenant colonel. In spite of the multiple changes in leadership in Uganda during the 1970s and 1980s, Kiiza continued to function as the presidential chief pilot, because of his training and experience. He flew Yusuf Lule, Godfrey Binaisa, Paulo Muwanga, and Milton Obote. Out of Uganda and into exile In June 1981, Kiiza felt unsafe in Uganda. He told Obote that the presidential jet needed servicing in the United States. He flew the plane to the US, then turned around and flew it back to London, in the United Kingdom. Kiiza handed the presidential jet to Lieutenant Colonel Paul Babula (RIP), who flew the Gulfstream II back to Uganda. Kiiza settled in the United States, where Gulfstream Aerospace offered him employment. He returned to Uganda in 1986, after Yoweri Museveni had become president. After 1986 In 1987, Kiiza was recalled back into he Air Force. He served as Museveni's chief pilot from 1987 until 2012. During this period, Kiiza recalls flying president Nelson Mandela, when he visited Uganda in 1994. He flew him from Entebbe to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, then to Pretoria, South Africa. Other notable passengers include president Paul Kagame of Rwanda. In July 2018, Ali Muhammed Kiiza was retired from the UPDF at the rank of Major General.

Rules  The following rules are based on G√∂√∂ck. A 32-card French pack (Piquet pack) is used. Cards rank in the usual Ace-Ten order and follow the Skat schedule whereby A = 11, 10 = 10, K = 4, Q = 3, J = 2 and the remaining cards are blanks or 'sparrows' (Spatzen). The aim is to avoid being the player who raises the total number of card points on the table past 100 (hence the name). The same number of cards is dealt to each player and any left over are placed, face up, on the table, the dealer announcing their total value in card points. Each player in turn plays a card of their choice from their hand onto the table pile, face up, and announces the new total of card points. When a player causes the total score of the cards on the table to exceed 100 points, they have lost and must pay each opponent a number of chips equalling the overshoot points i.e. if they have raised the total to 104, they must pay 4 chips to each opponent. If a player succeeds in raising the total to exactly 100 points they win 3 chips from each opponent. H√ºlsemann suggests that, with children, the loser may pay a forfeit. In Feder, the player overshooting the 100 mark pays one chip to each opponent. If he scores exactly 100, he receives one chip.  References   Literature  * Feder, Jan (1980).

It is her first fantasy novel. Based on the story of Hamlet, it recounts the story of Mawat, a prince seeking to overthrow his usurper uncle and regain his rightful place as the servant of a local god. He is accompanied by Eolo, his loyal retainer. Parts of the story are also narrated by a nature deity. Plot In the Raven Tower universe, many gods of varying levels of power exist. Anything that a god says becomes true; speaking a paradox may injure or kill a god. Gods may take the physical forms of animals or landmarks. The story is narrated by The Strength and Patience of the Hill, a god who inhabited a large boulder and later a millstone. Strength and Patience also discusses its long life, from prehistoric times through the arrival of humans. The country of Iraden is protected by various gods, including the Raven. The port city of Vastai is ruled by the Raven‚Äôs Lease, a human who is granted vast power in exchange for a shortened lifespan. When the Raven‚Äôs possessed bird dies, the Lease must die as well. Mawat, son of the Lease and commander of Iraden‚Äôs army, receives a message that his father is ill. Mawat is accompanied by his retainer, a transgender man named Eolo. When they arrive in Vastai, Mawat‚Äôs father has disappeared and his uncle Hibal is the new Lease. Mawat publicly accuses Hibal of foul play, threatening Vastai‚Äôs stability and trade relationships with other territories. In particular, members of the Xulhan Empire and their snake god are seeking a new alliance with Hibal. Eolo discovers that Mawat‚Äôs father is being held prisoner in the dungeons of the Raven Tower. He also discovers that Strength and Patience has been enslaved by the Raven. Strength and Patience has been protecting Vastai while the Raven‚Äôs power has secretly been weakening. Mawat, believing he is serving the Raven, inadvertently frees Strength and Patience from the Raven‚Äôs control. Mawat is then framed for murdering a high-ranking politician. A flood causes a dysentery outbreak and hostile forces begin invading, revealing that the Raven is no longer able to protect Vastai. Mawat kills Hibal and is then killed by the snake god. Strength and Patience states that he has killed the Raven. He vows to protect Eolo, but decides to leave Vastai to its fate. Style Strength and Patience describes its existence through first person narrative. It describes Eolo in the second person. This allows the reader to see the thoughts of Strength and Patience, while Eolo is only described from an external perspective. Thus, though we can see Eolo's actions, the reader is blind to his internal monologue. The contrast between the two styles invites the reader to consider whether Strength and Patience is omitting important details. Many of Strength and Patience's statements are written in the subjunctive mood or are framed as rumors. Background The Raven Tower is a loose retelling of Hamlet by William Shakespeare. While Strength and Patience's narration is original, the plot which takes place inside Vastai parallels the plot of the original Shakespearean story. Mawat serves as the analogue for Hamlet, while his loyal retainer Eolo serves as Horatio. Other similarities include the presence of a woman named Tikaz, who embodies some of the characteristics of Ophelia. Despite the similarities to Shakespeare's plot, a reviewer for Tor.com found that the presence of multiple gods in the story \\"reweaves the fabric of Shakespeare‚Äôs play into cloth of a different colour entirely.\\" Reception The novel received acclaim from critics. Kirkus Reviews gave a positive review, praising its \\"philosophical musings about politics, power, and revenge\\" and applauding its depth despite a relatively short page count for a fantasy novel. A reviewer for The Guardian called it \\"groundbreaking\\" and \\"a gripping tale of intrigue and politics\\". A reviewer for NPR praised its exploration of the political system of Vastai, as well as the contrast between the narratives of the human characters and the gods. Reviews for Locus magazine praised the story's originality despite its use of familiar building blocks. The review called it \\"a thoughtful reimagining of a genre, a re- examination featuring... variations, inversions, and overturned expectations.\\" The book was also praised by a reviewer from Spectrum Culture for its inclusion of a well-written transgender lead character in a genre that has not historically been kind to queer characters.

It was unsuccessful at this level but set a notable number of national records. Design and development Hungary had not previously competed in the World Gliding Championships but M√ñHOSZ, which organized all sports flying, called for a design to take part in the 1956 event, scheduled to take place at Saint- Yan in France. A team led by Ferenc Zseb≈ë at the Dunakeszi-based MRSz (Central Workshop of the Hungarian Aeronautical Association) responded, though time was short, resulting in a conservative and under-developed design, which first flew in May 1956. The 1956 Sir√°ly I was a largely wooden aircraft. Its two- part shoulder wing was built around a single spar with wooden flanges. In the inner part of the wing the webs were also wooden but the outer parts had duralumin webs which were glued to the flanges. The wing were covered with a double plywood layer to optimize finish and small \\"salmon\\" fairings were placed at the tips. Split Frise-type ailerons filled the outer third of the trailing edge. Inboard there were laps intended as airbrakes instead of the more usual spoilers, which allowed two water ballast tanks to be placed in the wings. Early flights showed the airbrakes were ineffective and they were supplemented by a tail-mounted drogue parachute. On the Siraly II, flown two years later, the parachute and flaps were replaced by G√∂ttingen-type spoilers which opened both above and below the wing, located just behind the spar well inboard of the ailerons. Both Sir√°ly variants had oval section, ply-covered semi-monocoque fuselages that tapered aft to the tail. The pilot's cockpit was ahead of the wing leading edge and under a one-piece canopy which blended smoothly into the deeper rear fuselage. The region ahead of the wing was slightly different on the Sir√°ly II, with a little longer and deeper nose and a slightly more humped canopy with curvatures adjusted to minimize optical distortions. The landing gear changes were more obvious. The Sir√°ly I had a long landing skid from the nose to the leading edge and used a two-wheeled dolly just aft of the skid for take-offs. In contrast, the Sir√°ly II's nose- skid was much shorter and it had a retractable, sprung monowheel under the trailing edge. Both variants had a small tailskid. The rear fuselage and empennage were the same in both variants. The horizontal tail, trapezoidal in plan, was mounted just above the fuselage on the base of the fin and on a long, shallow strake forward of it, placing the elevators ahead of the rudder. Both fin and rudder were approximately trapezoidal in profile. Operational history The 1956 World Gliding Championships at Saint-Yan opened at the end of June, so there was only a month to refine the Sir√°ly Is and for their pilots, L. Kalmar and G. Mezo, to familiarize themselves with their characteristics. The results were predictably disappointing, with Kalmar 25th overall and Mezo 37th. Both pilots at Saint Yen had been further handicapped by the absence of flaps. The Sir√°ly II, designed to compete in the next World Gliding Championships, scheduled to be held in Lezno, Poland in June 1958, was therefore fitted with them. Once again, the two aircraft were not flown until May and their pilots' unfamiliarity with them led again to disappointing results, not making the top twenty of a field of thirty-seven. Though unsuccessful at world level, the Sir√°lys set several national records, particularly for speed over triangular courses of various distances, straight line speed and out-and-return distances.

Barker is a self-discharging lake freighter owned and operated by the Interlake Steamship Company. She was originally built as the Edward B. Greene, and was later renamed Benson Ford before being sold to Interlake and named the Barker. It primarily hauls taconite pellets, stone, and coal across the North American Great Lakes.  Construction  The Barker was constructed in Toledo in 1952 for the Cleveland Cliffs Steamship Company as the Edward B. Greene, one of the eight AAA-Korea class freighters used for ore and coal shipping. The Greene was the first lake freighter to be constructed entirely in drydock. She was christened on January 10, 1952, with her sea trials beginning on June 18 of the same year. On her maiden voyage, which took place on July 29, 19,788 tons of iron ore were loaded to be shipped to Toledo from Marquette, Michigan. = Description = The Greene was built 647 feet long with a hull depth of 36 feet. It was powered by a 7,700 SHP DeLaval steam turbine and was equipped with 24 hatches. It measured 11,726 gross tons.  Service history  The Greene hauled taconite pellets from ore docks in Marquette, Michigan, to steel refineries in Detroit. = Lengthening and conversion to a self-unloader = In the winter of 1975‚Äì1976, Fraser Shipyards, Inc. was contracted by Cleveland Cliffs to lengthen the Greene with a 120-foot mid-body section, increasing capacity to almost 27,000 tons. At the same time, six of the other AAA-Korea class freighters were lengthened in the same way. In 1981, the ship was converted to a self-unloading vessel, with the addition of a 250-foot aft-mounted boom. = Purchase by Rouge Steel Company = In 1985, four years after the conversion, the Greene was purchased by Rouge Steel Company, originally a division of Ford Motor Company. Upon the ship's purchase, it was renamed Benson Ford III. Its new route stretched from Marquette to Detroit to supply the Ford plant there. = Purchase by Interlake Shipping Company = The Ford fleet was dissolved in 1989, leading to the Interlake Shipping Company's purchase of all remaining Ford boats. With the purchase, Interlake signed a contract to ship iron ore to the Rouge Steel plant. This created the Lakes Shipping Company, a new division of Interlake. = Service with Interlake = Second Renaming With Interlake's purchase of the Benson Ford, the decision was made to rename it to the Kaye E. Barker, after the wife of Interlake's president. Repowering In 2012, the Barker was repowered at Bay Shipbuilding in Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin. Her steam turbine was replaced with two 6-cylinder Rolls-Royce diesel engines and other equipment. Along with these upgrades, the Barker also received a replacement rudder and stock.

From May to September, seven scientific expeditions documenting the birds, geology, plants, insects, amphibians and reptiles of the islet were carried out, and an application to the Environmental Protection Administration to preserve Mianhua Islet and Huaping Islet as a Level One Ecologically Sensitive Area and Pengjia Islet as a Level Two Ecologically Sensitive Area was made. On March 18, 1996, the Mianhua Islet and Huaping Islet Wildlife Preservation Area () was established. In August 1996, the existing population of sheep on the islet was relocated to Taiwan to help restore the natural environment of the islet.

Vosko (born 1971) is a professor of political science and Canada Research Chair at York University. Her research interests are focused on political economy, labour rights, gender studies, migration, and citizenship. In 2015, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Education Vosko earned her bachelor of arts in political science from Trent University before attending Simon Fraser University. She published her thesis under the title \\"Shrink, cut...dye? : NAFTA and women's work in the Canadian clothing industry\\" in 1994 and earned her master of arts in gender studies. From there, Vosko earned her PhD at York University. Her dissertation from York University was titled \\"No jobs, lots of work: the gendered rise of the temporary employment relationship in Canada, 1897-1997.\\" Career In 2000, following her PhD from York University, Vosko published \\"Temporary Work: The Gendered Rise of a Precarious Employment Relationship\\" through the University of Toronto Press. Three years later, while working at York University in the Faculty of Liberal and Professional Studies, she co-edited \\"Changing Canada: Political Economy as Transformation\\" through the McGill- Queen's University Press. As a Canada Research Chair in Feminist Political Economy, Vosko conducted research through the Community University Research Alliance on Contingent Employment and the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council with Cynthia Cranford and Nancy Zukewich. Her research results showed that the Canadian labour market was becoming unstable due to \\"the growth of temporary and part-time wage work, self-employment and other forms of work not fully protected by labour laws and policies.\\" In March 2004, her research on precarious employment regarding foreign labour was featured on CBC Radio. In 2005, Vosko received funding from the Ontario government under the Early Researcher Award. Vosko's funding went towards her research project regarding precarious employment in first world countries such as the United States and Australia. That year she published \\"Self-Employed Workers Organize: Law, Policy, and Unions\\" through the McGill-Queen's University Press with Cynthia Cranford, Judy Fudge, and Eric Tucker. The book created a multi- disciplinary discourse around how legal, political, and social positions affected labour rights. The following year she edited \\"Precarious Employment: Understanding Labour Market Insecurity in Canada,\\" an interdisciplinary book with academic contributors from across Canada that focused on precarious employment and how laws, policies, and labour market institutions affected it. In 2009, Vosko, Martha MacDonald, and Iain Campbell published \\"Gender and the Contours of Precarious Employment,\\" which focused on precarious employment in Canada, Germany, the United States, Australia and in the European Union. In the book, the authors argue that precarious employment was the result of social, economic, and political inequality at the national and regional level. This was followed by \\"Managing the Margins: Gender, Citizenship and the International Regulation of Precarious Employment\\" which focused on capitalistic labour markets and the rise in precarious employment such as part‚Äêtime, temporary paid employment, and self‚Äêemployment. Four years later, Vosko collaborated with Valerie Preston and Robert Latham to create \\"Liberating Temporariness: Imagining Alternatives to Permanence as a Pathway to Social Inclusion.\\" The book focused on the ways in which temporariness, such as unstable work, was being institutionalized as a condition of life. In 2015, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada's Division of Social Sciences for her work on the political economy of work, gender, citizenship, migration and labour markets. That year she also helped lead a panel discussion at York's Global Labour Research Centre about the Canadian political economy. Vosko focused her research on employment standards and labour rights, specifically regarding migrant workers. As a result, she became the Principal Investigator of an employment standards research partnership titled ‚ÄúClosing the Enforcement Gap: Improving Employment Standards Protections for People in Precarious Jobs‚Äù with the Ontario Ministry of Labour. Simultaneously, she worked as the director of the Employment Standards Database which would work in conjuncture with this partnership to provide researchers with research on employment standards across national contexts. As a result, she was the recipient of York's inaugural Charles Taylor Prize for Excellence in Policy Research by Broadbent Institute in 2016. The following year, Vosko received $131,793 from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation for her research project \\"Canada Labour Code Data Analysis Infrastructure.\\" Her project's goal was to create a research tool that would allow for researchers to sift through the large databases the Government of Canada's Labour Program collected efficiently. In July 2016, the Government of Ontario published a study titled \\"The Changing Workplaces Review\\" which Vosko helped prepare. Due to her research in precarious work, Vosko had been approached by two government advisors to help create their study on the Ontario Employment Standards Act. She was also renewed as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in the Political Economy of Gender and Work and recognized by York University as a research leader in the Faculty of Liberal Arts & Professional Studies. In 2018, her research and recommendations from ‚ÄúClosing the Enforcement Gap: Improving Employment Standards Protections for People in Precarious Jobs‚Äù with the Ontario Ministry of Labour was used to shape the Canadian Labour Code Bill C-86. That year, Vosko was renewed again as a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in the Department of Political Science. In 2019, Vosko began collaborating with Mark P. Thomas, Carlo Fanelli, and Olena Lyubchenko to analyze the social change of the Canadian political-economic regarding work and social inequality. On September 10, 2019, Vosko became the first York faculty member to be the recipient of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada Impact Award.

Description The tree can grow to a height of up to and have several stems and has a spreading crown. The pendulous grey-green to green phyllodes have a linear to linear-elliptic shape and are straight or slightly recurved. The phyllodes have a length of and are in width with a prominent midrib and margins and obscure lateral nerves. The inflorescences occur in groups of 10 to 15 with spherical flower-heads that have a diameter of containing 50 to 60 densley packed bright yellow flowers. Following flowering firmly chartaceous, glabrous seed pods form with a white dusty covering. The pods have a length of up to and a width of . The shiny blackish seeds found within the pod have a circular to widely elliptic shape. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanist Leslie Pedley in 1969 as part of the work Notes on Acacia, chiefly from Queensland published in Contributions from the Queensland Herbarium. Pedley later reclassified it as Racosperma ensifolium in 1986 and it was transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. A. ensifolia is closely related and appear very similar to Acacia pruinocarpa which is found further to the west, it is also resembles Acacia beckleri. Distribution The tree is found in a small area of South West Queensland and the bulk of the population is found on and around the Gray Range with a scattered distribution extending out to Adavale in the north and to around Thargomindah in the south where it is found on low hills growing in clay loam soils.

She is known for her contributions in the development of local climate models as well as understanding the consequences of climate change. Her interests are diverse across mountain hydrometeorology, aerosol-cloud interactions, orographic precipitation and climate extremes. She is currently (2019) one of the eight Battelle Fellows at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL).  Education and early life  Leung completed her B.S. (1984) with honors in Physics and Statistics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. She then took two years to teach at a local high school after which she earned her M.S. (1988) and Ph.D. (1991) in Atmospheric Science from Texas A&M; University. Together with her advisor, Gerald North, she wrote her dissertation on 'Atmospheric Variability on a Zonally Symmetric Land Planet' where they studied the effects of external forcing on the atmosphere. During her post graduate degree, she also co-authored a paper titled 'A study of long-term climate change in a simple seasonal nonlinear climate model'.  Career and research  = Pacific Northwest National Laboratory = Leung completed her research dissertation at PNNL in 1989 before beginning her career as a research associate in 1991. She then worked as a staff scientist and senior scientist before becoming a laboratory fellow in 2004 and a Battelle Fellow in 2017. Her current research focuses on the dynamics of various land-atmosphere interactions as well as hydrological cycles. Her team at PNNL was the first group of researchers to link soot deposition with snowpack availability in the western United States. They also found that the primary cause of intense hurricanes is due to a climate cycle known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Along with other PNNL scientists, Leung contributed to the assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) that jointly won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 with Albert Arnold. As a contributing author of the report's Regional Climate Projections, she helped disseminate the knowledge on the consequences of anthropogenic activities in global warming. = Energy Exascale Earth System Model = In 2016, Leung was appointed as the chief climate scientist of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), previously known as the Accelerated Climate Modeling for Energy (ACME) project, by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). By shifting climate models from global to a regional scale, Leung and her team enhanced the efficiency of computational modeling. The model provides twice as much as details than the previous simulations and further allows for focusing on local climate effects. Leung's leadership was crucial in investigating climate change through the perspectives of various Earth System components including hydrological and biogeochemical cycles as well as cryosphere-ocean systems. She is currently working on Phase II of the project that is expected to be completed by 2021. = Professional service and membership = Leung is an editor of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Hydrometeorology and the American Geophysical Union's Journal of Geophysical Research- Atmosphere.

The company subsequently relocated its headquarters to Mountain View, California. Its initial public offering of 9 million shares took place on the NASDAQ stock exchange in March 2000. Also in 2000, Aclara was sued by Caliper Technologies for allegedly misappropriating Caliper's trade secrets in regard to the latter company's microfluidics technology. This suit represented one of several legal battles between the two companies, each of which accused the other of infringing on their patents. On October 26, 2000, a jury in California found Aclara guilty of misappropriating trade secrets and awarded Caliper $52,568,000. In 2004, it was reported that Aclara would be purchased by Virologic for $180 million in stock, the equivalent of $4.78 per share. In December 2004, Virologic completed its acquisition of Aclara for $160 million in stock; each of Aclara's shareholders received 1.7 shares of Virologic stock for each share of Aclara stock they had owned.

The organizations have emerged with differing political ideology and methods on how to achieve their goals. The South Korean Labor Movement is also active in other movements, allowing for solidarity between organizations. The movement originated in the 19th century while under Japanese rule as a way to organize workers. Later the movement developed alongside the growing working class. The movement employs a variety of methods as a means to bargain. Since its inception multiple unions have been created to advocate for workers.  Origins  The movement created the first union under colonial Japanese regime in 1910. Named the Seongjin Stevedores Union, it consisted of 47 workers. During this time period unions were limited in their scope as they were small in size and membership. Due to this unions were limited to occupational unions and regional based ones. It is during this time that differing ideology in the labor movement could be seen in the form of a pro Korean Identity and a pro Japanese Identity. The labor movement at this time was able to organize regional strikes as opposed to spontaneous revolts.  History  = Post 1945 = In November 1945 socialists formed Chun Pyung also known as the General Council of Korea Trade Unions (GCKTU) . Initial membership for the GCKTU was 180,000 workers and eventually grew to 553,408 members within two months. During August 1945 and February 1948 the GCKTU held over 3000 strikes which resulted in the deaths of 25 people and imprisoned 11,000. The fallout from the strikes led to the creation of a labor department created by the American military, which restricted union political activity. To protest this restriction, the GCKTU called for renewed strikes known as the September National Strikes, but failed to achieve anything significant, which led to the GCKTU being banned . In an effort to oppose the GCKTU a right wing trade union known as Daehan Dogrib Chockseong Nodong Chongyeonmyeng or the General Federation of Korean Trade Unions (GFKTU) was formed in March 1946. The ban of the GCKTU led to the GFKTU to become the sole representative of Korean trade unions. The GFKTU was later named to the Federation of Korean Trade Unions (FKTU). = Federation of Korean Trade Unions = The FKTU or Federation of Korean Trade Unions was formed in March 1946 as an effort to oppose the left leaning GCKTU. The formation of the FKTU had two goals, to support the conservative government and to oppose left leaning labor movements. The FKTU opposed many of the strikes the GCKTU conducted by attributing them as a means to gain political power. When the GCKTU was banned, the FKTU was the sole trade union, it represented South Korea in International Confederation of Free trade Unions in December 1949. In 1952 President Syngman Rhee took control of the union and incorporated into the Liberal Party. In 1953 the Labor Standards Act, the Labor Union Act and the Labor disputes adjustment act were passed by the government. The Labor Standards Act guaranteed an eight-hour work day. In April 1960 President Syngman Rhee was removed from his position by the student movement which led to the FKTU dissolve all ties with the Labor Party. In April 1971, the FKTU established the Committee on political Education (COPE) as a way to educated members on political issues and help political campaigns that supported workers' rights. = Chun Tae-il = Chun Tae-il was an activist who was most known for his act of martyrdom. Chun formed a group known as the Fool's Organization as a means to fight for the better treatment of workers. They reported problems such as illegal working conditions or other offenses that violated the Labor Standards Act to government officials . Spurred by the ineffectiveness of the government to improve working conditions, Chun Tae-il committed suicide by lighting himself on fire as a means of protest. Chun's actions inspired others to do the same. This method is one of the most extreme methods the labor movement employs. = Gwangju Uprising = The Gwangju Uprising served as the first step towards democracy in South Korea . The Gwangju Uprising refers to the events that took place in May 1980. Although the movement was conceived by students, overtime the working class made up a bulk of the participants. The events at this uprising led to the death of at least 164 people. Statistics for this event can vary from sources due to alleged coverups, where bodies were burned or dumped into the ocean and unmarked graves. On May 14, 1980, a student demonstration involving over 70,000 people sought to express their grievances against the authoritarian government. On May 17, the government arrested the leaders of the student movement as a way to stop the movement. On May 18, paratroopers were sent to confront the protesters and escalated the situation. What resulted was a massive slaughter of citizens which united ‚Äúworkers, farmers, students, and people from all walks of life‚Äù to oppose the government. On May 27, 1980 the uprising was put down. = June Struggle = The June Struggle also known as the Democratization Movement for 19 days in multiple cities were protesting for democracy. The Gwangju Uprising paved the way for student and worker solidarity which were instrumental for a democratic transition. A large number of people were arrested during the struggle, most of whom were laborers. In efforts to avoid another uprising, the government allowed for elections and democratic reforms. = Great Worker Struggle = During the democratization transition of Korea, In July and August 1987 over three million workers, inspired by the June struggle, led to an uprising of workers demanding for better wages, better working condition, and autonomous trade unions. Autonomous trade unions were an important goal as ‚Äúno legal independent unions existed‚Äù as the FKTU was ‚Äúloyal to the government‚Äù. The Great Worker Struggle failed to achieve much as it coincide with the democratization event. = Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) = On November 13, 1994 the groundwork for a new union to oppose the FKTU was created . Inspired by the Great Worker Struggle leaders of this union adopted the strategy of militant unionism as a way or bargaining. In order to be more effective regional cooperation with other unions was key in creating a new union, what followed was the formation of the Council of National Democratic Unions . In 1995 the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) emerged from the council. The KCTU represented the: automobile industry, shipbuilding industry, heavy industries, public transport sector, and white collar workers . In 1997 launched its first strike in order to protest the passage of the bills that limited workers' rights. Later the KCTU was able to negotiate for its semi legal status. = General Strike of 1997 = In December 1996 the National Assembly attempted to pass two laws that would limit workers' rights. These laws would have made it easier for the firing of workers and allowed the use of strikebreakers. In response to this workers responded en masse by walking off their jobs. By the third day the walk off amounted to 350,00 workers and stopped most of Korea's industrial production . On January 3, FKTU leaders met with KCTU leaders to create a united front. On January 15, the number of people who walked out of the jobs peaked at one million workers . On January 16 the government conceded and affirmed the bills would be sent back for revision . In March the laws were revised and the KCTU achieved semi legal status.  Methods  The South Korean Labor Movement employed a variety of methods in order to negotiate. These included strikes, protests, hunger protests, self immolation, violence, kidnapping, and the occupation of buildings.

He was a minister and a political prisoner for the Apollo Milton Obote regime after he opposed Obote's extension of power while Obwangor was a minister. Early life Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor was born in Omasia Parish, Bukedea District, Eastern Region, Uganda on 1 November 1920. He is a member of the Iteso ethnic group. = Education = He attended Ngora Catholic Church Primary School. He later attended the Nyenga Seminary, then attended Namilyango College from 1939 to 1941 and the Railway Traffic School in Nairobi, Kenya from 1942 to 1946.  Career  = Business = After graduating from the Railway Traffic School, Obwangor worked in Mombasa, Kenya for five years as a businessman, returning to Uganda in 1951. He first entered politics in Kenya, when he worked for Jomo Kenyatta and the Kenya African National Union executive council. Upon his return to Teso sub-region, he became a prominent businessperson in Magoro within the Magoro market where he built and ran a restaurant. = Political career =  Pre-Independence  In 1952, Obwangor entered Ugandan politics. He was elected to the Teso District Council and was elected to represent the Teso District at the Uganda Legislative Council, the precursor to the Parliament of Uganda during British colonial rule when Uganda was the Uganda Protectorate. He was a founding member of the Uganda National Congress, the first legal political party in Uganda that later merged into the Uganda People's Congress in 1960.  Obote Government  After the Independence of Uganda, the Uganda Legislative Council of the Uganda Protectorate dissolved on Tuesday 9 October 1962, being replaced on Wednesday 10 October 1962 by the independent Parliament of Uganda for the newly independent Republic of Uganda. Obwangor represented Teso again in the Parliament of Uganda. Ethnic conflict threatened to spry up after the independence of Uganda, and ethnic groups were naming kings to fight for their respective ethnic groups, and the traditionally kingless ITeso people attempted to name Obwangor as Iteso king, but Obwangor refused as he was dedicated to a multi-ethnic unified Uganda. Obwangor was a committed member of the Uganda People's Congress, the party of President Apollo Milton Obote that emerged from the pre-independence Uganda National Congress political party. Obwangor served as the treasurer of the Uganda People's Congress from the party's creation in 1960 until 1967, during which he oversaw the finances of the construction of the Uganda House. During the Apollo Milton Obote regime, Obwangor served in numerous ministerial positions as a part of his cabinet. When Apollo Milton Obote succeeded Benedicto Kiwanuka, Apollo Milton Obote appointed Obwangor to be Minister of Regional Affairs, which briefly assumed the responsibilities of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Felix Kenyi Onama also can lay claim to the Minister of Interior position between 1962 and 1964, as he was Minister of Works and Labour. That role assumed some of the other responsibilities of the Minister of Interior such as leading the Ugandan National Police Force. Obwangor and Felix Kenyi Onama were succeeded in their roles in 1964 by Basil Kiiza Bataringaya, who headed the newly created Ministry of Home Affairs, later renamed to be the Ministry of Internal Affairs. Bataringaya assumed the role after he flipped parties and joined the Obote administration. After he left the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor became Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs in 1964, succeeding Grace Ibingira. He also assumed the role of Minister of Housing and Labour in February 1966, serving in that role concurrently with being the Ugandan Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs. He remained as Minister of Justice and Constitutional Affairs and Minister of Housing and Labour until May 1966, when he became Minister of Commerce and Industry of Uganda.  Imprisonment  Obwangor, then minister of Commerce and Industry in Uganda, began to fall out of favor of President Apollo Milton Obote when he spoke out in favor of restraints on the presidential power in Uganda, with the following an excerpt from the journal of the Parliament of Uganda with his speech on 11 July 1967: After this disagreement and pushback upon Apollo Milton Obote's assumption of additional powers, Obwangor was fired from his role as Minister of Commerce and Industry of Uganda. On 19 December 1969, there was an Assassination attempt on Apollo Milton Obote's life, wounding him. The assassination attempt was allegedly led by Baganda civilians. Despite this, Obwangor along with Benedicto Kiwanuka, Paul Ssemogerere, Mathias Ngobi, and others were arrested, allegedly on the orders of Basil Kiiza Bataringaya and Felix Kenyi Onama. Obwangor was arrested while at a market in his home town of Soroti, shopping for food. He was taken to Luzira Maximum Security Prison by way of Mbale, and he was imprisoned at the Luzira Maximum Security Prison. In a 2012 interview, Obwangor alleged that because he was a political prisoner, \\"there was no mistreatment\\" while he was imprisoned in Luzira Maximum Security Prison. On 2 February 1971, the new head of state of Uganda Idi Amin released Obwangor, along with all other political prisoners in Uganda.  Post Imprisonment career  Obwangor reentered the political arena following his release, rejoining the Uganda People's Congress after the party temporarily excommunicated Obwangor after the leader of the Uganda People's Congress imprisoned Obwangor. In 1982, Obwangor shifted allegiances and joined the Democratic Party of Uganda. In 1984, Obwangor founded the Nationalist Liberal Party alongside Tiberio Okeny Atwoma, Anthony Ochaya, and Francis Bwengye. The Nationalist Liberalist Party was a splinter group from the leading opposition party at the time, the Democratic Party of Uganda. The Nationalist Liberal Party was created in response to former acting Secretary General of the Democratic Party Tiberio Okeny Atwoma's unsuccessful challenge to Paul Kawanga Ssemogerere for the leadership of the Democratic Party (Uganda). In 1986, Obwangor left the Nationalist Liberal Party, joining the National Resistance Movement party led by the new Head of State of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni. He was appointed by Yoweri Museveni in 1989 to serve as a member of the Justice Benjamin Josses Odoki led Uganda Constitutional Commission, which was tasked with reforming the Constitution of Uganda. In 1997, Obwangor left the National Resistance Movement, rejoining his original political party the Uganda People's Congress, although he left them after four years becoming a political independent which he remained until his death, stating in a 2007 interview that \\"politics is like wind, you move with the current affairs and temperature of the time\\". Obwangor was also committed to improving educational services for the poor of Uganda. Between 1986 and 1990 during the Lord's Resistance Army insurgency, many members of the afflicted areas fled to the more stable town of Soroti, Obwangor's hometown. This led Obwangor to help establish a school for displaced children at Moru Apesur in Soroti Town.  Death  Obwangor passed away on 18 May 2012 at 93 years old. He died in Alakara House, Soroti, Omagoro Sub-County, Katakwi District, Teso sub-region, Eastern Region, Uganda. Obwangor had a large state funeral that turned into a political affair. Members of the Uganda People's Congress fought with members of the National Resistance Movement at the funeral in Katakwi over who should speak, with the National Resistance Movement claiming the Uganda People's Congress neglected Obwangor in his time of need and therefore MP Olara Otunnu, a leader of the Uganda People's Congress, should be forbidden from speaking, something that resulted in brawls at the funeral until Otunnu was allowed to address the funeral. = Legacy = Obwangor House at Teso College Aloet was named in honor of Cuthbert Joseph Obwangor. The website for the school says that:  Personal life  He built his home, the Alakara House in Soroti, Omagoro Sub-County, Katakwi District, Teso sub-region, Eastern Region, Uganda in 1968 and lived their until his death, save for his years in prison. He lived there with his children and his four wives. Obwangor is a Christian.

It began forming in August, 1941 in the Siberian Military District. It followed a very similar combat path to that of the 374th Rifle Division. It joined the fighting front in December with the new 59th Army along the Volkhov River and it continued to serve in the battles near Leningrad until early 1944. The division took horrendous casualties in the combat to create and hold open a passage to the 2nd Shock Army during the Lyuban Offensive and was itself partly or fully encircled at several times during this dismal fighting. The division finally left this region as it advanced during the Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive in January 1944 and in July won a battle honor in the liberation of Pskov, while its 1250th Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In October the 376th as a whole would also receive the Red Banner for its part in the liberation of Riga. The division ended the war in Latvia, helping to contain and reduce the German forces trapped in the Courland Pocket, and was reorganized as a rifle brigade shortly thereafter. Formation Like the 372nd and 374th Rifle Divisions, the 376th began forming on August 10, 1941 in the Siberian Military District based on an RKO order of that dateWalter S.

Many of its personnel were Kuzbass coal miners, and it was given the name of the region as an honorific when it was formed. Its order of battle was as follows: * 1248th Rifle Regiment * 1250th Rifle Regiment * 1252nd Rifle Regiment * 943rd Artillery RegimentCharles C.

Col. Dmitry Ivanovich Ugorich was assigned to command of the division on September 1, and he would remain in command until April 9, 1942. In November the division was assigned to the 59th Reserve Army, and remained in there when it became the 59th Army. It moved by rail that month as far as Vologda from where it faced a march of about 700 km to reach the fighting front. The division and its Army joined Volkhov Front in December. The division contained a large number of experienced riflemen because when it first went into action it had 375 snipers on strength, five in each rifle platoon on average.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 101 Lyuban Offensive Operation Volkhov Front launched its main offensive on January 6, 1942. By the end of the day 59th Army's initial assault had expired due to heavy German resistance. Army Gen. K. A. Meretskov reported to the STAVKA the next morning, in part: \\"After repelling repeated enemy attacks, the 376th and 288th Rifle Divisions are along the Meneksha River line...\\" Following further bloody failure that day and later, on January 10 the STAVKA called a three day halt in the attacks at Meretskov's request. After regrouping and forming new shock groups he resumed the offensive on January 13, this time preceded by heavier and more effective artillery preparations. On January 17 the 2nd Shock Army resumed its attack, supported by more than 1,500 aircraft sorties, and finally penetrated the Germans' first defensive positions on the west bank of the Volkhov, advanced 5 - 10 km and created conditions that Meretskov considered favorable for developing success. Early on January 22 he proposed: This plan was approved later that day.David M. Glantz, The Battle for Leningrad, 1941-1944, University Press of Kansas, Lawrence, KS, 2002, pp. 158-62, 164-65 The 376th would remain in 4th Army until March.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 42 On March 15 the German 18th Army began its Operation Raubtier with the objective of pinching out the 10 km-wide corridor connecting 2nd Shock Army to the Soviet front along the Volkhov to encircle it and thwart its planned attack on Lyuban. Two days later the STAVKA ordered Meretskov to, among other measures, transfer the 376th to the Miasnoi Bor area to help hold the corridor open. In the event the German forces managed to link up on March 20, but this success was tenuous at best. Meretskov proposed that four divisions of the 52nd Army, including the 376th which had been transferred there, launch an offensive towards Novgorod on March 29, which would reopen communications to 2nd Shock and divert enemy forces to the defense of that city. He also noted that each division was understrength by 2,500‚Äì3,000 men. Despite these preparations by March 26, the 18th Army had formed outer and inner encirclement lines around 2nd Shock Army and part of 59th Army and a more direct approach became necessary. An operational group from the two trapped armies began an assault to link up with the stubbornly advancing 52nd Army on March 27 at or near Miasnoi Bor. By the end of the day a gap 3‚Äì5 km wide was forced through the enemy cordon, which salvaged the situation for the time being.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 174-78 In the event the Novgorod operation was never carried out. On April 8 elements of 52nd and 59th Armies struck again, widening the gap to 2nd Shock's positions, although the passage was still inadequate. The 376th was then withdrawn into the Volkhov Front reserves for replenishment, deploying again in the Miasnoi Bor area.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 180-81 On the 9th, Lt. Colonel Ugorich left command of the division, being replaced by Col. Georgy Petrovich Isakov. Volkhov Front was soon disbanded and the division returned to the front in 59th Army, which was now in the Group of Forces Volkhov Direction (later Volkhov Group of Forces) of Leningrad Front. It remained in that Army when Volkhov Front was reformed in June.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, pp. 80, 99, 120 =Operation Spark= In September the 376th was transferred to the rebuilding 2nd Shock Army, still in Volkhov Front, being briefly assigned to 6th Guards Rifle Corps.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1942, p. 187 Colonel Isakov handed his command to Maj. Gen. Nikolai Emilianovich Argunov on December 29; Isakov would go on to be promoted to major general and was made a Hero of the Soviet Union. On January 12, 1943, the Volkhov and Leningrad Fronts launched the third Sinyavino offensive, also called Operation Iskra (\\"Spark\\"). Volkhov Front's part in the offensive began at 0930 hours with an artillery preparation with more than 2,000 guns, including 300 conducting direct fire on the forward edge of the German defenses. Soon this was accompanied by attacks from 14th Air Army. The 376th was on the extreme left flank of 2nd Shock, and made a joint attack with elements of 8th Army which penetrated the forward edge of the enemy defense but was halted by heavy fire from the 1st Infantry Division. Repeated attempts to resume the offensive in this sector were stymied by German counterattacks. Overnight on January 12/13 Meretskov reinforced the division's thrust towards Sinyavino with the 71st Rifle Division supported by the 98th Tank Brigade but deteriorating weather and the dense forests hindered coordination and accurate artillery fire. While Sinyavino remained out of reach, to the north at 0930 hours on January 18 the 123rd Rifle Division of 67th Army joined hands with the 372nd of 2nd Shock just east of Workers Settlement No. 1 and the siege of Leningrad was officially broken.Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 273-75, 278-82 On January 27 General Argunov resumed his post as Deputy Chief of Staff for Combat Training, Volkhov Front, and was replaced in command by Maj. Gen. Mikhail Danilovich Grishin. Following Operation Iskra the 376th moved with its Army into Leningrad Front, where it remained through the rest of 1943.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 101 In August it was reassigned to 55th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1943, p. 213 Leningrad‚ÄìNovgorod Offensive In the preparations for the offensive that finally drove the German Army away from Leningrad for good, in December the 376th was reassigned again, now to the 116th Rifle Corps in 67th Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 9 The initial task assigned to this Army was to tie down the German forces south and east of Leningrad to prevent them from reinforcing their forces facing 2nd Shock and 42nd Armies. Subsequently the 67th was to attack through Mga and Ulyanovka towards Krasnogvardeisk. The offensive began on January 14, 1944, and on January 19 the latter town was liberated, primarily by 42nd Army. Early on January 21 Soviet intelligence detected a partial German withdrawal from Mga and 67th Army was ordered to pursue and destroy the enemy forces in the region. While the German forces evaded encirclement, Mga was liberated late in the day. On January 26 the 116th Corps was withdrawn into Front reserve,Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, pp. 333, 343, 352 and by the end of the month the division was transferred to the 118th Rifle Corps, also in Front reserve.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, p. 36 On February 6 that Corps was reassigned to serve as the second echelon of 42nd Army,Glantz, Battle for Leningrad, p. 377 and it would remain under that command until July, becoming part of 3rd Baltic Front when that was created in April. On March 4, General Grishin passed his command over to Maj. Gen. Nikolai Antonovich Polyakov. Baltic Offensive At the start of the summer offensive the 376th was directly north of Pskov, near the shores of Lake Pskov, facing the defenses of the Panther Line.Multi-Man Publishing, Inc., Baltic Gap, Millersville, MD, 2009, p. 10 After days of intense fighting the line was breached and on July 23 the division was recognized as follows: The 1250th Rifle Regiment was awarded the Order of the Red Banner for its role in the same action. By August 1 the division was back in the 116th Rifle Corps of 67th Army, but during that month it was reassigned to the 119th Rifle Corps of 1st Shock Army.Combat Composition of the Soviet Army, 1944, pp. 217, 247 It would remain under command of that Army for the duration. By the middle of September the 376th was in the vicinity of Ape in Latvia, continuing to advance to the west. On September 19 it took part in the liberation of Valga in Estonia.http://www.soldat.ru/spravka/freedom/1-ssr-1.html. Retrieved April 25, 2019. By early October it was approaching Riga just east of Limba≈æi.Multi-Man Publishing, Baltic Gap, pp. 29, 36 The division played a major role in the liberation of Riga, and was recognized with the award of the Order of the Red Banner on October 31. Battle of Courland After the battle for Riga the 3rd Baltic Front was disbanded and the 1st Shock Army was reassigned to the 2nd Baltic Front. Col. Dmitry Ivanovich Pavlov took command of the division from General Polyakov on December 28. The 376th remained in 119th Corps until February, 1945, when it was reassigned to the 123rd Rifle Corps, still in 1st Shock Army. It would remain under those Corps and Army commands for the duration, moving to the Courland Group of Forces with them in March.Sharp, \\"Red Tide\\", p. 101 On January 15 General Polyakov returned to command and would remain in that position for the duration.

Early life  Nicholson was born in Dallas County, in an area called Pleasant Hill, near Selma, Alabama. Although, by and large, New Deal programs, particularly those concerning agriculture, such as the Agricultural Adjustment Act, Resettlement Administration, and the Farm Security Administration, benefited white Americans more than black Americans, many families in Gee's Bend and the surrounding areas saw economic improvement during the New Deal era. For instance, Nicholson's family moved to Coy, Alabama when the McDuffie Plantation was broken up my the federal government for unfair sharecropping practices. Her father received 150 acres of arable land from this and seizure. Most black families were skeptical of the government program and moved north to avoid further systemic injustice. Nicholson and her husband, Daniel Nicholson, met when she was 18 years old. They married soon after and moved to Gee's Bend to farm and raise a family. Gee's Bend does not have many new families, and they refer to the Nicholson family as \\"incomers\\", though they have lived there most of their lives.  Work  Nicholson first began to make quilts when she was 16 and began making more after she married. Her husband, Daniel, proudly recalls helping her quilt, joking that, \\"She couldn't beat me sewing.\\" Their quilts, like most, were utilitarian, mostly used to keep their children warm at night and comfortable when sitting in the fields.

The shell has a long history of use by humans as a container and for decorative artwork. The eggs are not commonly eaten. Biology The female common ostrich lays her fertilized eggs in a single communal nest, a simple pit, deep and wide, scraped in the ground by the male. The dominant female lays her eggs first, and when it is time to cover them for incubation she discards extra eggs from the weaker females, leaving about 20 in most cases. A female common ostrich can distinguish her own eggs from the others in a communal nest. Ostrich eggs are the largest of all eggs, though they are actually the smallest eggs relative to the size of the adult bird ‚Äî on average they are long, wide, and weigh , over 20 times the weight of a chicken's egg and only 1 to 4% the size of the female. They are glossy cream- colored, with thick shells marked by small pits. The eggs are incubated by the females by day and by the males by night. This uses the coloration of the two sexes to escape detection of the nest, as the drab female blends in with the sand, while the black male is nearly undetectable in the night. The incubation period is 35 to 45 days, which is rather short compared to other ratites. This is believed to be the case due to the high rate of predation. Typically, the male defends the hatchlings and teaches them to feed, although males and females cooperate in rearing chicks. Fewer than 10% of nests survive the 9 week period of laying and incubation, and of the surviving chicks, only 15% of those survive to 1 year of age. A possible origin for the myth that ostriches bury their heads in sand to avoid danger lies with the fact that ostriches keep their eggs in holes in the sand instead of nests, and must rotate them using their beaks during incubation; digging the hole, placing the eggs, and rotating them might each be mistaken for an attempt to bury their heads in the sand. Human uses In Thebes, Egypt, the tomb of Haremhab, dating to approximately 1420 BCE, shows a depiction of a man carrying bowls of ostrich eggs and other large eggs, presumably those of the pelican, as offerings. Ostrich eggshells were used as containers in North Africa as early as the fourth millennium BC and in the Royal Cemetery at Ur from the third millennium. From the first millennium in the ancient Punic civilization, there are many examples of ostrich eggs decorated with painted geometric designs for use as cups and bowls. These have been found in Carthage, Sardinia, Sicily, the Iberian Peninsula and Ibiza. The tradition of using ostrich eggs as containers (sometimes decorated) continues to the present among the San people.. In the Middle Ages, ostrich eggs from Ethiopia were exported through the port of BƒÅ·∏çi ø on the Red Sea.Yusuf Fadl Hasan (1967), The Arabs and the Sudan: From the Seventh to the Early Sixteenth Century (Edinburgh University Press), pp. 64‚Äì66. During the Renaissance in Europe (15th‚Äì16th centuries AD), ostrich eggs were mounted in silver as goblets for display in cabinets of curiosities. Decorated eggs continue to be widely displayed in Eastern Orthodox churches, although their symbolism is disputed. They may symbolize the Virgin Birth, since according to the ostrich lays its eggs in the sand and forgets, so they are hatched by the sun alone. This significance may lie behind the egg suspended above the Virgin Mary in Piero della Francesca Brera Madonna painting.. In 2020, studies of decorated ostrich eggs in the British Museum showed that the methods by which they had been sourced, produced and traded were more complicated than had previously been imagined. Isotope analysis showed that eggs from the same archaeological site had originated in different places. The studies suggested that, rather than the eggs having been laid by captive birds, almost all had most likely been collected in the wild; a potentially hazardous undertaking. Today, ostrich eggs are a special luxury food. Gallery References Ostriches Eggs in culture ","title":"Ostrich egg"},{"id":"60565860","text":"Amelia Bennett (1914‚Äì2002) was an American artist.

Participated in the opposition movement, in 1889 he was brought to inquiry on the case of the distribution of the revolutionary magazine \\"Self-Government\\", in 1890 for three months he was in prison in the case \\"On the Criminal Community\\", which was conducted by the Smolensk Gendarme Office. In 1891 he was expelled from Moscow University with the prohibition to reside in Moscow and the Moscow Province. He moved to the Faculty of Law of University of Yuryev, which he graduated in 1893. Lawyer Since 1893 ‚Äì Assistant Attorney, from 1898 ‚Äì Attorney at Law of the Moscow Court of Justice District. In 1895‚Äì1896 he became one of the founders of the workers' advocates' circle, which included young Moscow lawyers: Nikolai Muravyov, Vasily Maklakov, Nikolai Teslenko, Mikhail Khodasevich. They not only did not take money from clients who were involved in political affairs, but also spent their own money on the way to the venue of the process. By 1902 the circle turned into a political defense group. He participated in many political processes ‚Äì he was a defender of the workers of the Morozovskaya factory (in 1899; out of 90 defendants 37 were acquitted). During this process, he denied the position of the prosecution, which was the collective responsibility of all the participants in the crowd for its actions. He defended demonstrators in Sormovo and Nizhny Novgorod (1902; among his clients were working Pavel Zalomov, who became the prototype of Pavel Vlasov, the hero of Maxim Gorky's story \\"Mother\\"), and participants in the unrest at Tikhoretskaya station (1903). In the same year, he successfully defended the workers of the Khludov pulp mill in the Ryazan Province (accused of unrest and resistance to the authorities) and the Kostroma workers who were accused of \\"economic hatred\\" attacks. He was also a defender of the peasants of the Kharkov and Poltava Provinces who were accused of unrest, the workers of Gus- Khrustalny. Then he was a lawyer not only for workers, but also for other revolutionaries ‚Äì from 1904 to 1905 he participated in the trial of Nikolay Bauman, Elena Stasova and other members of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party. During the revolution of 1905‚Äì1907, he defended members of the Saint Petersburg Soviet of Workers' Deputies (Lev Trotsky was involved in this process), participants in the uprising on the cruiser Memory of Azov (1906). Total spent over a hundred political processes. Together with his colleague Nikolai Muravyov, Malyantovich wrote a book \\"Laws on Political and Social Crimes. Practical comment\\" (Saint Petersburg, 1910). Actively sympathized with his client, made radical speeches at lawyers' meetings. He participated in the social democratic movement, hesitated between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks (he was not officially a member of the party), and was constantly under police surveillance. In 1905 his apartment was a turnout for the Moscow Committee of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party, whose members defended at the 1909 trial. According to the Police Department, in 1909 he gave the funds to the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party to dig up under a prison in order to free the prisoners. He won the civil process with the heirs of Savva Morozov, who challenged his will (100 thousand rubles were bequeathed by him to Maria Andreeva for the transfer to the Bolshevik party). Then he received the money by proxy and handed it over to one of the Bolshevik leaders Leonid Krasin. In 1915 he took to his assistant a participant in the revolutionary movement, the Menshevik Andrey Vyshinsky. Minister of Justice In September 1917, at the suggestion of Alexander Kerensky, Malyantovich became Minister of Justice of the Provisional Government (fourth composition). Before that, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Mensheviks) in order to represent it in the government. He was conciliatory towards the Bolsheviks, perceiving them as colleagues in the revolutionary movement. Despite this, he signed an order for the arrest of Vladimir Lenin, which was never executed, at the same time he warned Lenin about the impending arrest. On November 7, 1917, he was arrested along with other members of the Provisional Government by the rebels, and was sent to the Peter and Paul Fortress. A day later, like other socialist ministers, was released. Activities after 1917 Retired from political activities, he returned to Moscow. The writer Ivan Bunin, who met with him, noted in his diary (on March 12, 1918) that Malyantovich did not perceive the events as a tragedy: \\"And this is still a holiday, everything from them is like water. Pink, lively\\". In August 1918 he left for the South of Russia, lived in Pyatigorsk and Ekaterinodar. He was arrested in 1920. In September 1921, the People's Commissars of Education and Justice Anatoly Lunacharsky and Dmitry Kursky (colleague Malyantovich on political protection) summoned him to Moscow, where he served as legal adviser on the presidium of the Supreme Council of National Economy. He joined the Moscow Board of Defenders, which he headed for some time, was a member of the first staff of the Presidium of the All-Russian Lawyers Association. Participated in the activities of the Political Prisoners Assistance Committee (Political Red Cross). In 1930 he was arrested in the case of the Union Bureau of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (Mensheviks), was in Butyrka prison for several months, in May 1931 sentenced to 10 years in prison, but then released after intercession from the old Bolsheviks. Last arrest and death In November 1937 he was again arrested, was in the Lubyanka, in the Lefortovo and Butyrka prisons. He pleaded not guilty. In particular, during the interrogation on January 14, 1939, the investigator's demand to testify about \\"his counter- revolutionary activities\\" stated: \\"I intend to say the same thing today, what I will say tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, that I have never been engaged in counterrevolutionary activities, I have not been in any counterrevolutionary organizations and I have not led them\\". Malyantovich and his wife turned for help to Prosecutor General Vyshinsky, but he refused.

Although the credits for the film do not include the names of the actors involved in the episodes, the story seems to be confirmed by the significant portrait similarity of Malyantovich's face in the photo and in the film, unlike many other characters. This record Nikulin made in March 1964. The film was shot in 1937, and in November of the same year Malyantovich was arrested and later shot. The same fact confirms Alexander Solzhenitsyn in the \\"Gulag Archipelago\\". However, with careful viewing of the film \\"Lenin in October\\", we can be sure that the role of Malyantovich in the film was played not by Malyantovich himself, but by actor Sergei Tsenin.

PI is a proactive method of identifying, assessing, and mitigating possible threats to the client. It is meant to reduce the ability of an individual from getting close enough to attack the client or even the likelihood of them deciding to attack. Methods A PI analyst collects information through investigative methods, open source research, specialized databases, and other records on those who have the means and the interest in harming their client. Red team analysis is often conducted by PI analysts to help identify security threats to the client by looking from the outside in. This can include physical security assessments, such as observing the client‚Äôs schedule or transportation route and determining the points of vulnerability. Red team analysis for PI also includes cyberstalking the client through open source research to determine how much sensitive information is available to potential attackers. Countersurveillance operations are used to make it more difficult for an attack to be planned as well. PI analysts help focus these operations and identify the areas mostly likely to be exploited, analyze the operations' findings, and investigate any individuals of interest who are detected.https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/proactive-tool- protective-intelligence Components PI‚Äôs three main functions are identification, assessment, and management/mitigation. *Identification: The PI analyst must first determine where and how their client is vulnerable and who would want to exploit their vulnerability. The analyst then identifies these individuals who pose potential threats. *Assessment: Assessment occurs after an individual is identified as a potential threat to the client. A variety of tools and methods are employed during this phase of PI to investigate if the threat is legitimate and if so, how much of a threat. The information sought after is what the executive protection agents need to know to properly protect the client. Sources of information for the assessment can come from interviews from the individual or others who know them, records on the individual and background checks, writings by or about the individual, or travel and purchase receipts from the individual. This helps determine if and why the individual is interested in attacking the client, as well as if they have the means to do so. *Management/Mitigation: If the investigation shows the individual is not a threat then the case is closed, though the investigation and the individual's information is kept on record. If the investigation proves the individual is a threat, then the analyst will monitor the threat and occasionally perform reassessments. Monitoring can take the shape of surveilling social media accounts, physical surveillance, or reaching out to a third party that is connected to the individual. The analyst also provides the rest of the executive protection team with an unbiased explanation of who the individual is and why they represent a threat.https://www.protectivesecuritycouncil.com/intelligence/protective- intelligence-fundamentals-and-challenges/ The team PI analysts often interact with a number of other professionals when working in executive protection. Psychologists act as consultants to advise the team if an individual of interest has or appears to have a mental illness. Human resource managers and employee mental health program organizers are able to alert the team if an employee has shown the potential to become violent and to then help divert them from that path. Physical security guards work alongside the analysts, relying on them to provide pictures and information on possibly threatening individuals. The client, as well as their staff and family, can also be briefed on any important information pertaining to their security and the measures they should take to ensure it.https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/proactive-tool-protective- intelligence The clients The most common clients that utilize PI are internationally travelling dignities, high ranking politicians, corporate executives with a high net worth, and celebrities. Other clients can include schools and business that wish to guard against mass shootings.

Its core business is the production of integrated raw and refined sugar and engaging in engineering services. Trading on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE), the company is in Victorias City, Negros Occidental, Philippines where its plant facilities are also located.  History  = Early years = Victorias Milling Company (VMC), considered the Philippines' leading sugar firm and the largest sugar producer, was founded by Don Miguel Ossorio together with wife Maria Paz Yangco, Claudio Ruiz de Luzuriaga, his brother Francisco Ossorio, and Shiras Jones. Its mill and refinery facilities for sugar and allied products are in Victorias City, Negros Occidental. Established on May 7, 1919, it is one of the earliest sugar mills established in the Philippines. Two years earlier, Ossorio founded the North Negros Sugar Company, a 300-TCD (ton of cane per day) centrifugal mill in Manapla, Negros Occidental, where the sugar planters from Victorias milled their produce. VMC was bigger at a capacity of 1,500 TCD when it started operations in 1921, and both companies were merged after World War II. Equipment and machinery in Manapla were utilized to repair the site in Victorias which was heavily damaged, and a sugar refinery was constructed with a capacity of almost a million pounds of sugar per year. The Spanish-descent Ossorio was the president and chairman from the start until 1967. He invited his wife Paz, his brother Francisco, entrepreneurs Jones and Claudio R. de Luzurriaga, Sr. as partners. Later in 1921, the chemist Carlos Locsin of Silay City joined the management team. The following became president of the company: Jose Maria Ossorio, Miguel Ossorio's son (1967‚Äì1976; chairman emeritus until 1989); Claudio Luzurriaga Jr., Claudio de Luzurriga's son (1976‚Äì1991); Gerardo Javellana (1991‚Äì1997); Manuel Ma√±alac (1997‚Äì??). The company grew to become one of the largest integrated raw and refined sugar manufacturer in Asia and produced half of the country's demand for refined sugar. It successfully raised P525 million from its initial public offering in September, 1993. = Asian financial crisis = During the Asian financial crisis, it sought debt relief during its bankruptcy in 1995. Accounting issues were uncovered on the use of loan sugar quedans that could not be accounted for. Its dire financial situation was attributed to the competition brought about by cheap imported sugar, not operating to full capacity, loans that were spent for facility repairs and ventures to other industries, and trading extension of its subsidiary, the North Negros Marketing Corporation. On March, 1997, the company sought and was approved for a 90-day moratorium on principal payments on its loans from 32 creditors. The company also was suspended from trading in the stock exchange on that year due to its failure in filing the required documentation and fees, as well as concerns on material information of the company's disclosures. The local bourse issued a warning to de-list the company in 1999. The board replaced Gerardo B. Javellana with Manuel Ma√±alac as president in June, 1997. By July, it requested the SEC to suspend further debt payments and to establish a committee to oversee the company's management and to come up with a rehabilitation plan, which involved selling common shares, reducing debt such as converting debts to equity, reducing the workforce, and adding new business partners. Isidro Alcantara Jr., then vice president of PCIBank, was appointed by SEC as the committee head on the rehabilitation plan's implementation. = In the 2000s = The company established a creditor-driven program to improve its financial standing and to settle the maturity of obligations earlier than schedule. By May 31, 2013, it has turned around its operations by settling P4.4 billion restructured loans and by redeeming issued convertible notes. By December 16, 2013, it has converted P70.5 million in notes to 70,049,966 shares. In 2018, VMC sought SEC's approval to modify the rehabilitation plan to add loans worth P1.19 billion that were the subject of litigation with creditors. The loans consisted of refined sugar delivery orders (RSDO) and quedans (RSQ) that were allegedly issued by the company and then utilized by its subsidiary, the North Negros Marketing Co. Inc (Nonemarco), to facilitate borrowing. These loans were previously not part of the rehabilitation program, were up for resolution in the court, and according to the company, \\"lacked any factual or legal basis and that the officers who issued them acted fraudulently.‚Äù By December, 2018, VMC again proposed to amend the rehabilitation plan to include compromise payment scheme on some of its loans. Asserting that it didn't benefit from the proceeds of the loans, the company agreed to debt settlements spread over 10 years to prevent \\"future and protracted litigation.\\" = Stock trading = Filipino businessman Lucio Tan, who gave a critical lifeline in the midst of the Asian crisis, owned a 30.9% stake, while the public owned 24% of its stock. When VMC stocks were opened for trading in 2012, its price rose by 931%. Its share was valued at P0.29 when it was last traded on October 8, 1997, and it closed at P2.99 on May 21, 2012.  Subsidiaries  On July 3, 2013, the SEC approved the company to engage into other industries aside from manufacturing sugar and allied products and engaging in engineering services. The forerunners of its subsidiaries were established much earlier. For instance, the company's foundry division began in 1964, agribusiness in 1976, management and technical services group in 1977, and food processing division in 1979. The company's subsidiaries include Victorias Foods Corporation which is into sardines and meat products, Victorias Agricultural Land Corporation, Victorias Green Energy Corporation, Canetown Development Corporation, the 65-hectare Victorias Golf and Country Club, Inc., Victorias Quality Packaging Company, Inc., and Victorias Industrial Gases Corporation. In addition, the company also owns other facilities including farms, piggery, a 180-kilometer railway system, a school, a shipping company and the Saint Joseph Hospital.  Impact  The company, due to its ownership of lands and its various enterprises, had influence in the locality particularly in Victorias. Its businesses contributed to the promotion of the municipality to a city, which according to scholar Cesar Salda√±a, was \\"the city that sugar built.\\" The name of its annual Kalamayan Festival that started in 2014, which the city celebrates every December, comes from the Cebuano word kalamay (sugar) owing to the importance of this commodity to the economy and to the province of Negros Occidental. Upon celebrating 100 years since it was established, the company signed a memorandum of agreement with Philippine Postal Corporation to release a commemorative stamp that would contain the company's centennial anniversary logo. Since 2013, the company holds an annual art competition for grade school and high school students. Moreover, the renowned St. Joseph the Worker Chapel is located in VMC compound. It is considered one of masterpieces in modern Philippine church art and architecture, and it is part of the National Museum's Important Cultural Properties.

She was a part a group of female CIA analysts studying Al Qaeda and its leader, as portrayed in the 2013 HBO documentary, Manhunt: The Search for Bin Laden. She also served as the Chief Targeting Officer in the search for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of Al Qaeda in Iraq and predecessor of ISIS. After 10 years, she left the CIA. She is currently a foreign policy consultant and guest commentator on many international and national media outlets.  Early years  She graduated from high school with a class of nine students. She attended Montana State University from 1987 through 1991 and transferred to the University of Utah to finish her B.S. in International Economics.  CIA career  In 2000, at the age of 30, Bakos joined the CIA as an analyst in the Counterterrorism Center. At this point, she met Gina Bennet, who had been analyzing al Qaeda for 20 years and was tracking bin Laden. Bennet became her mentor. Bakos' role at this time is portrayed in the PBS Frontline episode, The Secret History of ISIS, as well as the Emmy award winning HBO documentary, Manhunt: The Search for Bin Laden. She was a part of the sisterhood of female CIA analysts studying the relationship between Iraq, al Qaeda, bin Laden, and the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This documentary shows the work that went into the raid that ultimately killed bin Laden, highlighting the work of analysts and case officers during that time. Following bin Laden's death and during the Iraq War, Bakos served as a Chief Targeting Officer in the CIA's National Clandestine Service searching for Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the founder of Al Qaeda in Iraq and predecessor of ISIS. Zarqawi was killed in a targeted drone strike on June 7, 2006 by the US military. It is the role that inspired Bakos' upcoming book, The Targeter: My Life in the CIA, Hunting Terrorists and Challenging the White House. She chronicles her time as part of the CIA's analytic team studying Iraq before and during the Iraq invasion. The Targeter describes conflicts with the White House when their analysis faces push back, Iraq war zones, the inner workings of the CIA, the world of the intelligence community following the 9/11 terrorist attacks, working with US Special Operations Forces while tracking Zarqawi and other terrorists, and Bakos' personal view of female government leadership as well as what problems women face in male dominated career fields. The book received a 75,000-copy first printing.  Post-CIA career  After 10 years at the agency, Bakos made the decision to leave. Since then, Bakos has worked with Starbucks and for a number of other organizations in a consultant role. She assists executives and government officials in understanding the global context surrounding new technologies. Many of her consultant roles have involved national security issues, illicit networks, human trafficking, and regional stability. In addition, she has been a commentator and resource for CNN, ABC, FOX, MSNBC, BBC, CBC, the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, and a number of other international and national media organizations. She is also a Senior Fellow in the Program on National Security at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. In April 2018, Bakos filed a lawsuit against the CIA as they were delaying the release of her book, The Targeter, for two years. In the lawsuit, she argues that the CIA is infringing on her First Amendment right to publish unclassified information. CIA employees are required to submit their work for approval by the Agency for the rest of their lives, however, by law, there is supposed to be a response provided within 30 days of submission.

ISA operatives worked in conjunction with Italian police to locate the kidnapped general primarily through the use of intercepted Red Brigades radio communications. The operation, which took place during December 1981 and January 1982, resulted in the successful rescue of Dozier as well as the arrest of a number of Red Brigades members.  Development of the ISA  Several unsuccessful special operations missions such as Operation Rice Bowl in Iran revealed weaknesses in the United States‚Äô ability to respond to high stakes hostage situations. Out of these failures came the creation of the Field Operations Group (FOG), the predecessor to the Intelligence Support Activity, on 25 August 1980. Colonel Jerry King was appointed as the head of the 50-man group for the purpose of executing a rescue mission in Iran code-named Operation Snowbird. However, King's team achieved a permanent status after its success during Operation Snowbird. Intelligence Support Activity (ISA), nicknamed \\"The Activity,\\" was approved for creation on 29 January 1981 and officially established a little over a month later, with 50 authorized personnel. The Activity's stated mission was to provide the collection of actionable intelligence and \\"operational preparation for the battlespace.\\" ISA had an initial budget of $7 million and King, now the commander of ISA, used it to grow the team to 100 members. The early ISA members were \\"knob-turners\\" who specialized in electronic surveillance, \\"spooks\\" who specialized in human intelligence, intelligence specialists, and some administrative and logistical staff. A large part of the 25-man team that participated in Operation Winter Harvest was made up of the \\"knob-turners.\\"  Kidnapping of Dozier  On 17 December 1981 in Verona, two members of the Italian terrorist organization Red Brigades disguised themselves as plumbers to gain entry into the apartment of Brigadier General James Dozier, the then senior U.S. Army officer in NATO's Allied Land Forces Southern Europe. Over the prior seven years, no hostages of the Red Brigades had been found alive. 10 days after the kidnapping, the Red Brigades released a photo of Dozier with a swollen left eye sitting in front of a banner with the Italian group's emblem, denouncing the general as an \\"assassin and hero of the American massacres in Vietnam\\" and announcing the start of his \\"proletarian trial.\\"  Search for Dozier and ISA contributions  Initially, the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), which was in charge of handling terrorist incidents, sent a six-man liaison team of Delta Force and ISA members led by Colonel Jesse Johnson, a senior Delta officer, to offer \\"technical assistance\\" to the Italian authorities. Johnson reported to the JSOC headquarters that the Activity should take the job of searching for the kidnapped general. ISA signals intelligence (SIGINT) operators primarily searched for the Red Brigades‚Äô communications networks. As part of this mission, ISA equipped a Bell UH-1 Huey helicopter with the \\"latest frequency- scanning radio sets and electronic direction-finding equipment.\\" This allowed the SIGINT operators to lock onto and track the Red Brigades‚Äô radio communications even after they changed frequencies. In addition to the Huey, ISA ground units were in vehicles and at static locations looking for more of the group's communications links. Once the ISA operators gathered information on the Red Brigades‚Äô frequencies, they passed it onto the NSA who used the Aquacade spy satellite to pinpoint the safe houses that the signals were coming from. During this time, Italian police had arrested 14 members of the Red Brigades with the help of ISA, which had used intercepted Red Brigade radio communications to find the coordinates of several Red Brigade safe houses. These arrests helped the authorities gain information through interrogation and the documents confiscated. One of the arrested members, Giovanni Senzani, was the leader of one of the two factions within the terrorist group and was in possession of a letter from the leader of other faction, Antonio Savasta, which strongly suggested that Savasta was holding Dozier. Information from both the arrests as well as ISA analysis reduced the search down to three separate areas between Padua, Verona, and Vicenza. The Red Brigades had transmitters active in each area and used speech that was easily discerned by ISA and Italian authorities as discussing Dozier. Additionally, the ISA tracked a yacht owned by Dr. Mario Frascella near Venice that was in regular contact with the Red Brigades team in the Guizza district of Padua. The Activity then studied the electricity usage of houses and apartments within the district in an effort to find irregularities, eventually finding an apartment that had a sharp and unusual increase in power usage the day of the Dozier kidnapping. The apartment, located above a supermarket, was only 48 miles from the kidnapping and being rented out by Mario Frascella, the owner of the Venice yacht, for his 21-year-old daughter, Emanuela. Further reports by neighbors mentioning the surprising amount of food and newspapers that Emanuela was buying for supposedly living alone. On 28 January 1982, ten members of the Italian antiterrorist unit Nucleo Operativo Centrale di Sicurezza, nicknamed \\"Leatherheads\\" for the facial coverings, conducted on the Padua apartment that saw them rescue Dozier, apprehend the six Red Brigades members present, and avoid any casualties without firing a single shot.  Aftermath  Operation Winter Harvest was the Activity's first major success and also was the second time a hostage of the Red Brigades had ever been safely rescued. Though ISA played a crucial role in the search and rescue mission, the American government gave the Italian authorities all of the credit in order to keep the organization's existence secret. A few months after the operation, budgets for special operations were increased in order to counter the growing terrorist threat. Furthermore, the operation's success meant that Jerry King's new organization would begin to receive more assignments.  References  * Smith, M. (2007).

History ODF was founded in 2009 in Warsaw, Poland and officially registered in 2010 by Lyudmyla Kozlovska, Ukrainian national from Sevastopol, Crimea. Kozlovska moved to Poland after the Orange Revolution in order to study. She had been a civic activist since the age of 13, when she opened the first Ukrainian library in Sevastopol. As a teenager she organized protests under the headquarters of the Russian Federation's Black Sea Fleet. Kozlovska launched ODF following a human rights forum on Central Asia she had organized in Poland in 2008 with activists from Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyzstan and after having met Andrzej Grzyb MEP, who invited her to the European Parliament to speak on human rights in Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan. Initially, ODF based its activities on experiences of student movements and civic organisations that developed from the Orange Revolution. Activities =Kazakhstan= During and following the 2011 Zhanaozen massacre in Kazakhstan ODF monitored the situation and campaigned for the release of the jailed oil workers and for the investigation of the allegations of torture. On the second anniversary of the events ODF opened an exhibition on the massacre at Warsaw University, inaugurated by Adam Michnik, and a dedicated website at www.zhanaozen.eu. In April 2013 ODF co-organised and co-financed an 8-day human rights monitoring mission of the Polish Supreme Bar Council to Kazakhstan. Since then ODF organises monitoring missions and advocates for human rights in Kazakhstan (e.g. in the framework of consultations for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights or for the OSCE). =Ukraine= ODF became known in Poland following its support for the Euromaidan revolution in Ukraine. The foundation organised 3 monitoring missions between November 2013 and January 2014 with Polish MPs Micha≈Ç Jaros, Tomasz Makowski, Micha≈Ç Szczerba and Marcin ≈öwiƒôcicki and 3 concerts at the Euromaidan. In January 2014 it started a long-term monitoring mission and opened a permanent tent at the Euromaidan with the goal to \\"monitor the situation, support visits of international observers and share knowledge on the European Union\\". The mission lasted 56 days and included around 30 volunteers on the ground, with a total of 480 volunteers involved with the foundation between January and April 2014. The ODF tent was the only permanent presence of an NGO from the European Union at the Euromaidan. ODF organised a mass humanitarian support campaign for the Euromaidan, sending a total of 35 tons of medicine, medical supplies, bulletproof vests and helmets to the protesters, journalists and observers, 10 tons of which went to the Donbas region. The total value of humanitarian aid delivered by ODF to Ukraine in 2014 was over PLN 1.000.000. Following its involvement in Ukraine the foundation became a target for Russian propaganda. From late February 2014 until early June 2016 ODF run a support centre in central Warsaw for Ukrainian refugees under the name \\"Ukrainian World\\". The centre was estimated to have supported over 30.000 people during its functioning. At later stages the centre changed its focus to promoting Ukrainian culture in Poland. Since 2014 ODF has been campaigning for Russia's release of Ukrainian pilot Nadiya Savchenko and the imposing of sanctions on Russia following her detention, as well as that of Oleg Sentsov and numerous other Ukrainian war and political prisoners illegally held in Russia. In October 2016 ODF co-organised a \\"march of solidarity with Ukraine\\" in Warsaw. The foundation has also been advocating for democratic reforms and greater integration of Ukraine and the EU. = Russia = The foundation's activities related to Russia started in 2014 and were at first focused on campaigning for the release of political prisoners and prisoners of war following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, most notably pilot Nadiya Savchenko and film director Oleg Sentsov. For this purpose ODF joined other EU and Ukrainian human rights NGOs to organise an international advocacy campaign under the name \\"#LetMyPeopleGo\\", with a platform for monitoring and listing the so-called \\"hostages of the Kremlin\\" launched with the Center for Civil Liberties / Euromaidan SOS at www.letmypeoplego.org.ua. In 2018, Swedish publishing house Ariel F√∂rlag published the story of the Russian persecution of Ukrainian director Oleg Sentsov and other Kremlin prisoners based on ODF's report. As of 2019 ODF has also been campaigning against the renewal of voting rights of the Russian Federation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, for the enforcement of European sanctions against Russia and for introducing a worldwide \\"Magnitsky Act\\". = Moldova = ODF has been advocating for human rights and the rule of law in Moldova by organising human rights monitoring missions. It cooperates with international bodies like the OSCE, where it advocated in cases of politically persecuted judges and the nullified 2018 Chi»ôinƒÉu mayoral election or the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, where ODF organised a seminar in June 2017, together with deputies from three PACE fractions, focused on corruption and the persecution of dissidents in Ukraine and Moldova. ODF's report on cases of persecuted judges and prosecutors in Poland and in Moldova was included, together with a similar report by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, in the United Nations General Assembly's 41st Human Rights Council's \\"Report on the independence of judges and lawyers\\", published on 29 April 2019. = Poland = In Poland ODF initially supported the civic opposition movements defending the independent judiciary, especially in mid-2017 during the attempted reform of the Supreme Court and other controversial reforms of the judiciary by the ruling majority. These reforms prompted the European Commission to invoke Article 7 of the European Treaty against Poland, denouncing the reforms as putting the judiciary under the political control of the ruling majority and citing \\"serious risk [to] the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers\\". In response to the crisis, on 21 July 2017 ODF Board's Chair Bartosz Kramek published an article on civic disobedience, which was viewed by pro-government media as a call for a revolution and prompted then-foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski to officially request that the article be removed and to instruct fiscal authorities to conduct a \\"complex fiscal control\\" of the foundation. In October 2017 the foreign ministry filed a request to the court to forcefully dissolve and replace the foundation's board, but the request was dismissed by the court on 7 December. ODF's advocacy in Poland focuses on the rule of law and especially the freedom of the judiciary and civic freedoms. ODF's report on cases of persecuted judges and prosecutors in Poland (incl. notable cases such as Igor Tuleya, Waldemar ≈ªurek & Jerzy Stƒôpie≈Ñ) was included, together with a similar report by the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, in the United Nations General Assembly's 41st Human Rights Council's \\"Report on the independence of judges and lawyers\\", published on 29 April 2019. During President Andrzej Duda's visit to Washington, DC in June 2019, an ODF delegation led by board member Martin Mycielski held meetings at the Capitol, with the State Department and with other US stakeholders to \\"update them on the state of civic freedoms in Poland, especially the persecution of civic activists\\" and share most recent reports on Poland. This mission was criticised by Polish pro-government pundits incl. Aleksandra Jakubowska, Dawid Wildstein and Rafa≈Ç Ziemkiewicz, as well as the Head of the Political Cabinet of the Minister of National Defence ≈Åukasz Kudlicki. = Interpol = At least since 2013 ODF has been campaigning for the reform of Interpol, focused on the abuse of its ‚ÄúRed Notice‚Äù system by authoritarian states - notably Russia, Turkey, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan - for the persecution of political exiles. To that end ODF has held events in the European Parliament and national parliaments of EU member states, at the PACE, OSCE PA and ODIHR HDIM sessions, as well as provided expertise for Interpol bodies. Controversies =Poland= ODF has been a subject of controversy since mid-2017, when its Board's Chair Bartosz Kramek had published a Facebook article on possible civil disobedience actions against the Law and Justice government in Poland. In August 2018 the Polish government expelled ODF President and Bartosz Kramek's wife Lyudmyla Kozlovska from the Schengen zone by entering her into the Schengen Information System, citing secret intelligence that the NGO had received Russian funding. In an interview, Polish foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski admitted that the reasons for the expulsion were ODF \\"pursuing anti-Polish goals in Brussels\\", and taking \\"actions against a democratically elected government\\" by \\"writing a detailed plan on how to topple the Polish government\\". The Polish government's action was met with criticism from EU officials and the international public opinion. Former Belgian prime minister and president of the ALDE Group in the European Parliament Guy Verhofstadt MEP commented that \\"Black lists against democracy activists are worthy of authoritarian regimes, not of EU Member States. The Schengen visa ban on Lyudmila Kozlowska must be withdrawn - or Poland‚Äôs role in Schengen reviewed\\", with the ALDE Group directing two open letters to the European Commission on the matter. The Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights, in its statement, noted that the actions of Polish authorities were incompatible with EU law. Protests were organised in Poland in support of Kozlovska and a public petition was initiated on August 21 by former Polish president and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa, asking EU heads of state to enable Kozlovska's return to the EU. The petition was signed by over 30,000 citizens and over 80 high- profile figures, including EU Commissioner El≈ºbieta Bie≈Ñkowska, Pulitzer Prize recipient Anne Applebaum, Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon, former government ministers Leszek Balcerowicz, Rados≈Çaw Sikorski, S≈Çawomir Nowak & Marcin ≈öwiƒôcicki, the S&D; Group in the European Parliament, Oscar-nominated director Agnieszka Holland, Gazeta Wyborcza editor-in-chief Adam Michnik, Newsweek Polska editor-in-chief Tomasz Lis, numerous Members of the European Parliament and Members of Parliament from Poland and Ukraine, NGOs, academics, journalists and other figures. In an open letter initiated by the Ukrainian Helsinki Group, 11 Ukrainian civil and human rights organisations protested the inclusion of Kozlovska in SIS, calling it a \\"dangerous precedent which triggers a new kind of harassment of public activists in EU countries because of their public disagreement with state policy\\". The organisations claimed they supported ODF as \\"The organisation is actively working to release Ukrainian citizens imprisoned for political reasons in Russia and occupied Crimea, and is consistently pushing for sanctions against Vladimir Putin and his entourage for gross human rights abuses\\". In mid-September 2018 the Schengen ban was disregarded by German authorities, who permitted Kozlovska to speak at the Bundestag, causing outrage in Poland, with the Polish foreign ministry summoning the German ambassador to protest and Polish president Andrzej Duda raising the matter with his German counterpart, Frank-Walter Steinmeier. She was next invited by Guy Verhofstadt to speak in the European Parliament on September 26, with Belgian authorities disregarding the Polish ban, again causing backlash in Poland. In the end also France, Switzerland and the UK have disregarded the ban, letting Kozlovska speak on her case and the rule of law situation in Poland at the Council of Europe, the United Nations in Geneva and the House of Commons, respectively. On March 4 Kozlovska received a 5-year residence permit in Belgium, which, according to EU law (Article 25 of the Schengen acquis) forces Poland to withdraw the SIS ban. In its ruling of April 16 the Voivodeship Administrative Court in Warsaw revoked the decision to include Kozlovska in SIS, claiming the secret documents on which it was based were \\"too general\\" and \\"failed to show how [she] poses a risk to nationality security\\". On June 24 the media announced that Poland had deleted Kozlovska from SIS, but that she likely still remains on the national list of unwanted persons. From June 24 to 26, Dziennik and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna published a series of articles under the label \\"DGP investigations\\", uncovering new details about the case and claiming Polish secret services had collaborated with those of Moldova. This information has supposedly surfaced following the change of power in Moldova and its aftermath, resulting in the fall of the Vladimir Plahotniuc-led regime and the election of Maia Sandu to the post of Prime Minister. The investigation furthermore included a controversial revelation that the Fiscal and Customs Office in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, tasked with investigating ODF by then-foreign minister Witold Waszczykowski, was until 28 February 2017 run by his brother, Tomasz, who still remains a senior official there. =Moldova= ODF's activities became a subject of controversy in November 2018 following a report published by a closed-door Moldovan parliamentary committee, claiming the organisation was linked to the Russian Federation and had attempted to interfere with domestic Moldovan politics by funding of opposition parties. Some Moldovan press articles on the other hand viewed the report as an attack on the pro-EU Party of Action and Solidarity and Dignity and Truth Platform Party before the upcoming parliamentary elections. The Moldovan parliamentary report on ODF again became a news story in Polish pro-government media in April 2019 following publications in the Scottish edition of The Sunday Times, which referenced the report, claiming ODF had received up to ¬£1.6 million in donations from companies registered in Glasgow and Edinburgh. Prominent Polish governing coalition politicians like Ryszard Czarnecki and Patryk Jaki used these publications during their EP electoral campaign to attack the opposition, especially MEP R√≥≈ºa Thun, who had advocated for Lyudmyla Kozlovska following her expulsion. On April 24, Onet.pl reported that the authors of the publications were in fact not Sunday Times journalists but the head of a PR agency and a pro-Brexit campaigner. The Economist's Balkan correspondent Tim Judah commented in an interview: \\"It's a very strange article. The authors cite the Moldovan parliament. I don't know anyone who would believe the findings of the Moldovan parliament.\\" Following the change of power in Moldova and election of Maia Sandu - who had earlier cooperated with ODF \\\\- to the post of Prime Minister, an investigation by Dziennik and Dziennik Gazeta Prawna revealed that the report, according to metadata, was \\"redacted or even entirely written by Andrian Candu\\", vice- chairman of the Democratic Party led by Vladimir Plahotniuc, who was not himself a member of the parliamentary committee. The publication also claimed that \\"Poland could have cooperated regarding ODF with security services controlled by Vladimir Plahotniuc\\", citing members of the committee. The Polish Chancellery of the Prime Minister responded to those allegations claiming that \\"the details of actions taken by special services are not revealed to the public due to legal reasons\\". The topic has reportedly been discussed by Polish foreign minister Jacek Czaputowicz and his Moldovan counterpart Tudor Ulianovschi at the OSCE Ministerial Council in Milan in December 2018. =Advocacy cases= ODF has received criticism from far-right French MEP Nicolas Bay for one of the individual cases of human rights abuses that it had advocated for (together with Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch) - the case of Mukhtar Ablyazov, founder of the opposition political party Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan and opponent of Kazakhstan's first President Nursultan Nazarbayev. Bay alleged that ODF receives financial support from Ablyazov. In 2013 ODF launched a website, mukhtarablyazov.org, as a project to present Mukhtar Ablyazov.

Humanitarian  In April 2012, Costa commenced a full-time voluntary role with the United Nations, World Food Programme as Food Security Advisor for Sub-Saharan Africa. Focusing on the crippling levels of food loss occurring in the region annually and its direct contribution to widespread starvation and poverty, Costa initiated a sustainable development strategy for reducing post-harvest crop losses, significantly benefiting millions of low-income families and farming communities throughout developing regions of Africa. The measurable and sustainable impact of his team's work was recognized by the United Nations WFP in 2015, receiving the Global Innovation Challenge Award for the Most Impactful Humanitarian Innovation. In September 2016 Costa was appointed a Director of the United Nations World Food Programme and given the role as Global Head of a Strategic Alliance between the United Nations and 7 private and public partner organizations, seeking sustainable solutions to the major systemic problems affecting food systems in developing countries.

His nephews Philip and Herman Harris operated the White House store in Santa Ana, California and together with his other nephew Arthur, founded the Harris Company in San Bernardino, California, which would become a large, grand department store and a chain across the Inland Empire. All three nephews had worked for Leopold Harris at his Los Angeles store. History Harris's first store, then called The London Clothing Co., was on the Los Angeles Plaza. Harris, alone and with partners, operated a succession of locations, each time further southwest from the Plaza, including *By 1870, Harris joined Isaac, Nathan, Charles, Abraham, and Lessor Jacoby to buy out Herman W.

Harris moved to San Bernardino for eight years, in which city his nephews would start the Harris Company department store chain.http://www.ci.san- bernardino.ca.us/about/history/the_harris_company.asp then moved back to Los Angeles.

Sewell is known for her sculptures made of found objects. Her work is included in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.  Early life  Sewell was born in Perry County, Alabama, growing up on a farm near the town of Marion. She was one of fourteen children born to Patrick Sanders, a dairy employee. Her parents were strict and organized, frequently mobilizing the children to harvest crops, tend to or slaughter their cattle, or immaculately clean the house and surrounding fields. Sewell's first memories of drawing came from the rests she would take during harvests. She would sculpt and draw in the open patches of mud on her parents' property. Sewell carries her parents' habitual, ritual cleaning into her work, as she is constantly tidying, sweeping her yard, and rearranging its contents to make her charms and protective sculptures. A performative child, Sewell excelled in school, particularly in music, performing arts, and arithmetic. Although most of her work is contained on her property, cumulatively, her oeuvre reads as a series of stages where her knowledge and spirituality perform.  Career  Sewell's work undulates through her childhood home and stretches from the road to the back edges of her property. Mundane objects such as mailboxes and old refrigerators become vessels for history and Sewell's personal spirituality, which is a syncretism of southern American Christianity and West African-derived ancestor propitiation. An X with dots in each quadrant also pervades her work. Sewell described \\" I put it on refrigerators and those things‚Äîsymbols of God.\\" Comparing this symbol to ancient Roman symbols that are now ubiquitous, \\"That is a sign of history. That sign is a great symbol of things. It‚Äôs no mean thing to it, nothing devilish in it. It is not. It is a symbol to recognize by. It is a symbol of recognized ways...Them little dots in it make it a star. Let you know you got good running. Knowledge can make you be a star You can use your knowledge and background.\\" Other notable assemblages include a generations-old doghouse bordering the woods, many Black Panther inspired scarecrows, which stand guard against animals in her crops and people entering her property, and shrines to ancestors or biblical tales which are assembled on tree branches.

It lives and breeds in a coastal environment. This is a unique behaviour for mosquitoes as globally just 5% of the group breed on the rocky shore. Adults of the species are found throughout the intertidal zone while its larvae and pupae can be found in rock pools just above high tide. It is one of two known species in the genus Opifex.  Description  Adults are stocky with a dark grey-black coloured body. They are a primitive mosquito with few scales. Wings are a light brown colour. The head is vertex with no erect scales but has numerous curved hair-like structures known as setae. The male of this species has long legs that allow it to walk on water and large claws used to grip females during mating.  Diet  Adults of this species use their long proboscis to feed on the blood of birds, humans, and other coastal animals. They will feed by day and night but are most active during the day. Their bite is known to be painful. Unlike other mosquito species, the female does not require a blood meal to produce their first batch of eggs. The larvae predate on small animals including the larvae of other mosquitos. They are also known to scrape organic matter from sediment at the bottom of rock pools.  Breeding  Adult females lay their eggs just above the water's surface. Larvae is washed into rock pools above the high tide mark where the develop over the winter. Once in the pupae stage they will not feed. In early spring, adult mosquitos emerge in large numbers from the rock pools. The males hatch first and use their long legs to sit on the water's surface where they wait to mate with females as they emerge.

At the end of 2008, it belonged with five other Namibian congregations to the denomination's Klassis Waterberg, while another 13 congregations belonged to the exclusively Namibian Klassis Etosha. However, in 2015, the Otjiwarongo congregation returned to the Klassis Etosha. Confirmed membership went down from 58 in 2014 to 44 in 2015, and baptized membership went down from 18 to 6 in the same year.  History  GKSA worshipers in Otjiwarongo, in then South West Africa, were served until 1954 as a district of the Outjo Reformed Church, established in 1930 along with the Gobabis and Outjo Reformed Churches as a result of the repatriation of 1,922 Afrikaners, survivors and descendants of those who made the Dorsland Trek from Angola and were mainly GKSA members. On March 19, 1955, Otjiwarongo was separated from Outjo in a partnership agreement with those in Grootfontein (where the pastor preached 11 Sundays a year), Usakos, and Walvis Bay (11 days a year in the latter two, along with 22 Sundays in Otjiwarongo proper). The Rev. M.W. van der Walt was the first pastor of this joint congregation. He gained his own parsonage in June 1956. It was also decided to secure a church building, since services had heretofore been held in the auditorium of the Otjiwarongo Secondary School and now competed with those of the Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NHK). On June 28, 1958, the first church building was inaugurated. After the Rev. Van der Walt took a post in the Krugersdorp-West Reformed Church, a new pastor arrived to take office in March 1959. E.W. Meyer was a native of Gobabis and the son of Ernst Meyer, South African consul in Angola. Seven lean years followed in which the congregation struggled financially with around 98 confirmed and 104 baptized members in 1959, much more than in 2014, and the pastor's family struggled with illnesses. On June 12, 1965, the Rev. Meyer left for a post in South Africa. The Rev. P.J.L. du Plessis subsequently began conducting services on February 26, 1966, in combination with Grootfontein. However, in 1970, he left for a post at the Kuruman Reformed Church. The Rev. J.J. Venter was the new pastor from 1972. The membership grew rapidly, and that same year, an organ was purchased. The congregation prepared to separate from other territories in 1975. After the Rev. Venter left for a post in 1976 at the Vryheid Reformed Church, as many as 10 filled the job, but a long-term successor was not forthcoming. For the second time, C.J.J. Putter of Outjo worked as a consultant and helped hire the church's 17th pastor, the Rev. D.H.P. Wijnbeek, on April 16, 1977. The congregation was based in Otjiwarongo but had a district in Okakarara.  Pastors  # M.W. van der Walt, 1955 tot 1958 (together with Grootfontein, Usakos en Walvisbaai) # E.W.

Generally the probability of the two alternatives is modeled, instead of simply outputting a single value, as in linear regression. Binary regression is usually analyzed as a special case of binomial regression, with a single outcome (n = 1), and one of the two alternatives considered as \\"success\\" and coded as 1: the value is the count of successes in 1 trial, either 0 or 1. The most common binary regression models are the logit model (logistic regression) and the probit model (probit regression). Applications Binary regression is principally applied either for prediction (binary classification), or for estimating the association between the explanatory variables and the output. In economics, binary regressions are used to model binary choice. Interpretations Binary regression models can be interpreted as latent variable models, together with a measurement model; or as probabilistic models, directly modeling the probability. = Latent variable model = The latent variable interpretation has traditionally been used in bioassay, yielding the probit model, where normal variance and a cutoff are assumed. The latent variable interpretation is also used in item response theory (IRT). Formally, the latent variable interpretation posits that the outcome y is related to a vector of explanatory variables x by : y=1 [y^*>0] where y^*=x\\\\beta +\\\\varepsilon and \\\\varepsilon \\\\mid x\\\\sim G, is a vector of parameters and G is a probability distribution. This model can be applied in many economic contexts. For instance, the outcome can be the decision of a manager whether invest to a program, y^* is the expected net discounted cash flow and x is a vector of variables which can affect the cash flow of this program. Then the manager will invest only when she expects the net discounted cash flow to be positive.For a detailed example, refer to: Tetsuo Yai, Seiji Iwakura, Shigeru Morichi, Multinomial probit with structured covariance for route choice behavior, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, Volume 31, Issue 3, June 1997, Pages 195‚Äì207, ISSN 0191-2615 Often, the error term \\\\varepsilon is assumed to follow a normal distribution conditional on the explanatory variables x. This generates the standard probit model.Bliss, C. I. (1934). \\"The Method of Probits\\". Science 79 (2037): 38‚Äì39. = Probabilistic model = The simplest direct probabilistic model is the logit model, which models the log-odds as a linear function of the explanatory variable or variables. The logit model is \\"simplest\\" in the sense of generalized linear models (GLIM): the log-odds are the natural parameter for the exponential family of the Bernoulli distribution, and thus it is the simplest to use for computations. Another direct probabilistic model is the linear probability model, which models the probability itself as a linear function of the explanatory variables. A drawback of the linear probability model is that, for some values of the explanatory variables, the model will predict probabilities less than zero or greater than one.

His information on the cartel‚ÄîOperation Cornerstone‚Äîled to its eventual disbandment, as a result of which Salcedo and his family have entered the United States Federal Witness Protection Program.  Early life  Salcedo was born on November 25, 1947, in Bogot√°, Colombia. His father was a member of the Colombian military. Salcedo lived in Kansas for two years while his father attended the United States Army Command and General Staff College, after which the family moved back to Colombia. He attended the University of Los Andes, from which he earned a degree in industrial economics. He joined the Army Reserve division in Cali.  Cali Cartel  = Recruitment = Salcedo was invited to join the Cali Cartel in 1989, after Mario del Basto, a member of Salcedo's reserve unit, made first introductions. Salcedo had previously worked on behalf of British commandos, who worked with the Colombian government to counter the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. At this initial meeting, the Cali godfathers asked Jorge to coordinate an attack on Pablo Escobar, a rival drug cartel leader. The two factions agreed, and Jorge worked with the commandos to develop a plan of attack. In May 1989, the attack was set to occur, but heavy cloud cover resulted in a helicopter crash, with most of the commandos failing to make it to Escobar's hideout, Hacienda N√°poles. The attack was subsequently called off. = Surveillance = After the failed raid, Salcedo focused his efforts on the personal security of the Rodr√≠guez Orejuela family. His expertise with radios and communication equipment allowed the cartel to communicate freely, all while monitoring the communications of national police and rival cartels. In 1992, Salcedo coordinated the purchase and retrieval of several Salvadorian bombs in another plot to kill Escobar. After the transaction was discovered by national police, Salcedo was outed as a member of the Cali Cartel. He was removed from his post in the reserve. After going into hiding, Salcedo focused his efforts on monitoring his electronic communication network, extracting intelligence on both national police and the Medell√≠n Cartel. After Escobar was killed by national police in 1993, Salcedo considered his duty with the Cali Cartel completed, and attempted to resign. His resignation was denied by Miguel Rodr√≠guez Orejuela, and he was forced to continue his relationship with the cartel. Whereas his previous role involved avoiding detection from Escobar's network, Salcedo now assisted Cali's men with avoiding detection by the National Police of Colombia. During this time, the Search Bloc‚Äîoriginally formed to hunt Escobar‚Äîfocused its attention on the Cali Cartel. In 1995, Gilberto Rodr√≠guez Orejuela was captured by a joint task-force in Cali. The raid operated off of documents seized from an inspection of an office owned and operated by Guillermo Pallomari, the cartel's chief accountant. After being ordered to kill Pallomari, Salcedo began to believe that he had no choice for leaving the operation other than its dismantling. Salcedo did not comply with his orders and pretended to not know where Pallomari was, believing Pallomari to be his bargaining chip for his freedom. = Cornerstone = Mario del Basto's arrest in 1995 promoted Salcedo to the cartel's chief of security. In that same year, Joel Rosenthal, an American lawyer who had helped the Cali Cartel with previous cases, was arrested for his connections to the cartel. Salcedo viewed this as an opportunity to begin his relationship with United States law enforcement. Rosenthal's arrest led to Salcedo being introduced to Chris Feistl and David Mitchell, two Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents operating in Cali. In July 1995, Salcedo met with Feistl and Mitchell to devise a plan to capture Miguel Rodr√≠guez Orejuela. After Jorge determined Miguel's location, the DEA agents planned a raid of the apartment complex. While the scheme was initially designed to be a surprise, bureaucracy led to a prolonged siege of the apartment which ended without an arrest. In the aftermath, Salcedo was demoted. On August 6, Salcedo and the DEA collaborated on another assault on Miguel, this time on the Hacienda Buenos Aires. This raid was successful, and the DEA arrested Miguel. Before being extradited by the DEA, Salcedo argued that Guillermo Pallomari must be extracted. Working under the pretense of casing Pallomari for assassination, Salcedo forwarded his location to the DEA. Pallomari was hesitant to respond to the DEA's offer, fearing it to be a ploy. Only through the recruitment of his wife did Guillermo agree to leave. William Rodr√≠guez Orejuela, Miguel's son, suspected Salcedo to be the leak, and reassigned Jorge's responsibilities. On August 12, the DEA successfully collected Pallomari and his family. Salcedo stayed in Colombia, awaiting diplomatic permission from the Colombia government to leave. On August 26, 1995, after six-and-a-half years with the cartel, he was extradited to the United States. He entered the Federal Witness Protection Program, where he remains to this day.  In media  Salcedo was portrayed by Matias Varela in the third season of the Netflix- produced television series Narcos. Salcedo was consulted on the show, and provided feedback on the role he played in the prosecution and arrest of the Rodr√≠guez Orejuela brothers.

It is an elongated barangay located in the northeast corner of Para√±aque adjoining the areas of Bicutan in Taguig and northern Muntinlupa. The village is unique in that it is connected to the rest of Para√±aque by only two bridges, one of which is a footbridge. Its western border follows the South Luzon Expressway, thus separating it from Merville, Sun Valley, Don Bosco and Marcelo Green. It neighbors Western Bicutan to the north, particularly the redevelopment area of the former Food Terminal Inc. (FTI) known as Arca South. To the east, it adjoins Taguig's barangays of Upper Bicutan, Central Bicutan, North Daang Hari and Tanyag. It neighbors South Daang Hari and Sucat, Muntinlupa to the south. The village is roughly divided into three parts, the main residential area and housing development in the north by the Arca South development, the mixed commercial and residential area in the center by the Bicutan Interchange and the narrow industrial strip in the south. As of the 2015 census, it had a population of 21,181. History The village took its name from the parish church founded by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila in 1967 within the gated community of United Para√±aque Subdivision Phase 1 (UPS1, now United Hills Village). The parish in turn was named after the patron saint and protector of mixed-race people and the first Black American saint from Lima, Peru canonized in 1962, Martin de Porres. Until the late 19th century, the village was a no man's land in the middle of a vast friar hacienda owned by the Order of Saint Augustine containing rice paddies and swamps between Para√±aque (as La Huerta, San Dionisio and Don Galo were then called) and Bicutan.Dulce Festin Baybay, Ariel Marquez-de Guzman (2001). Palanyag to Para√±aque: A History, p. 182. City of Para√±aque, Philippines. It was part of the then-sitio of Ibayo located in the Guadalupe plateau at an elevation of between 10-35 meters higher than the coastal elevation in the sitio's easternmost portion. In 1901 when Ibayo was reorganized as a barrio now known as Santo Ni√±o, Bundok Mani as the area was then called became one of its four sitios, along with Libro Balagbag (now part of Pasay), Dilain and Mataas na Kahoy. Subsequent development of the former friar estate as a U.S. airfield and military reservation and construction of the railroad line passing through this sitio towards the Bicol Region in the 1930s paved the way for the village's initial growth. With the destruction of Manila by the end of World War II came the mass exodus to the neighboring towns and the development of gated communities across the region, among them the United Para√±aque Subdivision. By the late 1960s the village became more accessible with the opening of the South Superhighway to Alabang, bringing with it new commercial and industrial enterprises, including the Greater Manila Terminal Food Market and the Philippine American Embroideries plant. And in 1978, the United Para√±aque Subdivision together with neighboring communities, Marian Park and Sitio de Asis, that were earlier physically separated from the rest of Santo Ni√±o by the superhighway, made the separation official by forming its own village and local government through Presidential Decree No. 1324.

The main access road into the village and its principal north-south corridor is a frontage road east of the expressway which is a national tertiary road known simply as East Service Road. The village's only road link with Don Bosco and the rest of Para√±aque is the Bicutan crossing at the three-level Bicutan Interchange serving as the junction between the South Luzon Expressway, Do√±a Soledad Avenue and General Santos Avenue, and between the Skyway and Do√±a Soledad Avenue. Its main east- west access road starts from this interchange as a continuation of Do√±a Soledad Avenue into Central and Lower Bicutan towards the Pateros-Alabang Road and C-6 Road on the shores of Laguna de Bay. At the village's north end separating it from Western Bicutan and Arca South is Cucumber Road which gives access to the San Martin de Porres Barangay Hall and which is also linked to FTI Avenue and Tanyag Avenue in South Signal Village at its eastern terminus. This portion of San Martin de Porres is a predominantly slum area with 600 families living there when a fire broke out in August 2015. Within the gated community of United Hills Village (UPS1) south of Cucumber Road linked to the East Service Road at its west end is its main street, Narra Street, which leads to the San Martin de Porres Parish Church. Just south of United Hills is Marian Park and UPS2 which is traversed by Marian Road where the Dr. Arcadio Santos National High School is situated. Its central section near General Santos Avenue is dominated by the Bicutan Market and Waltermart Bicutan shopping mall. The village's southern portion is a narrow strip of warehouses fronting the East Service Road. The Bicol Commuter and Metro South Commuter lines of the Philippine National Railways run along the median between East Service Road and South Luzon Expressway. San Martin de Porres is served by the Bicutan railway station situated near the Bicutan Interchange where a long footbridge also connects this village across the South Luzon Expressway to Don Bosco by the SM City Bicutan mall.

It was written in the country‚Äôs official language Kiswahili by authors Cassian Magori and Charles Saanane, with illustrations by the German graphic artist Thomas Thiemeyer. This book was published in 1998 with the support of the Goethe-Institut in Dar es Salaam, the local branch of the German cultural institute, by E&D; Vision Publishing, Tanzania.  Contents  In its pictures and a partly fictional story, the book tells the story of dinosaurs that lived approximately 150 million years ago in East Africa. Their skeletons were excavated between 1906 and 1913 in the former colony of German East Africa and until today represent the most important excavations of dinosaur fossils found in Africa. As the book is directed towards young readers in Tanzania, the authors invented a partially new narrative to put the story of the discovery, the subsequent excavations, and the scientific knowledge about natural history and the life of dinosaurs into a contemporary African perspective. For the first time, this book presented thorough information about the excavations and the reconstructed skeletons of the dinosaurs that are exhibited in the Museum of Natural History in Berlin, Germany, to Tanzanian readers in their own language.In his book on the history of the excavations, Gerhard Maier calls the effect of this booklet \\"A most welcome outcome (...) was the popularization of Tendaguru for the people of Tanzania.\\" See During several years, and under supervision of German natural scientists, 230 tons of excavation material containing fossil bones and other remnants of life 150 million years ago were packed into wooden boxes by African workers and carried to the nearby port of Lindi. From the excavation site at the Tendaguru Formation, they were shipped to Hamburg and, finally, to Berlin. Subsequently, scientists at the museum in Berlin reconstructed several skeletons of different dinosaur species, making the fossils of the Tendaguru formation one of the world‚Äôs most important collections for ongoing research. The exhibition‚Äôs highlight is an almost 14-metre-high skeleton of the species Giraffatitan, the largest dinosaur skeleton on display in the world. Along with presenting scientific knowledge about the existence and environment of the dinosaurs, the presumed reasons for their extinction, and their classification into different species, the story of their discovery is here presented in a different way than in the historical German sources.Henning, E. (1912) Am Tendaguru. Leben und Wirken einer deutschen Forschungsexpedition zur Ausgrabung vorweltlicher Riesensaurier in Deutsch-Ostafrika. Stuttgart: Schweizerbart (in German), online here Whereas the German excavation reports claim that the fossils were first found by a German mining engineer who was surveying the region of Tendaguru, the Tanzanian book attributes this discovery to a local farmer, a wise old man called Mzee Buheti, who by means of magical herbs supplied by his wife Mama Msomoe, is able to travel through time and space guided by a spirit. On one of his travels back millions of years, he comes across huge animals in the region of the Tendaguru hills. Upon his return through the millennia, he witnesses environmental changes that eventually lead to the extinction of the dinosaurs. By means of a time line reaching from the beginning of our universe to the present and showing pictures of different species, the reader is presented with short scientific information about the evolution of the dinosaurs and other species. By choosing the name of Buheti for their protagonist the authors referred to the historical Boheti bin Amrani who was the local \\"chief supervisor\\" (Oberaufseher) of more than 100 African workers involved in the excavationsCf Hennig, E. (1912) Am Tendaguru, p. 35 with Boheti's image When in 1906, the German engineer Bernhard Sattler is surveying the region, it is Mzee Buheti who shows him the place where the fossils were found, thus prompting the excavations and their scientific exploration. In his account of the history of the fossils, Gerhard Maier mentions that the assistant leading scientist of the excavations, Edwin Henning, considered the headman of the African workers, Mzee Boheti, as intelligent and highly suitable for his job. See Maier, Gerhard: African Dinosaurs Unearthed: The Tendaguru Expeditions, Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press, 2003 at books.google.com In order to present an adequate visual idea of the dinosaurs and their environment, Thomas Thiemeyer, a German illustrator specializing in this subject, created colour plates for both the presumed living conditions and the extinction of dinosaurs, and for the fictitious story of their discovery, told from a contemporary Tanzanian perspective. The text in Kiswahili was jointly written by the palaeontologist Charles Sanaane and the natural historian Cassian Magori of the University of Dar es Salaam, and edited for young readers by literary writer Bernard Mapalala.  Aims of the book  As scientific research and presentation for the general public of these excavations are usually published in German or English, very few Tanzanians knew about the existence and history of the fossils from Tendaguru before this book was published. Although the international discussion and demands for cultural cooperation and restitution of African cultural heritage from museums in Europe In 2018, such demands have received new momentum thanks to the report on the restitution of African cultural heritage by Felwine Sarr and B√©n√©dicte Savoy, commissioned by French president Macron. https://restitutionreport2018.com/ For the reaction of German cultural organizations to calls for repatriation, see https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/ have become more prominent, Tanzania does not have any specimens from Tendaguru, enough personal resources nor infrastructure to present dinosaur fossils in an adequate way. In order to make this important historical information accessible to a general local audience, the Goethe-Institut in Dar es Salaam suggested the story of the Tendaguru dinosaurs to the publishers of the book in 1998. - According to Elieshi Lema of E&D; Vision Publishing, 4000 copies were produced with the financial help of a sponsor and distributed free of charge to Tanzanian secondary schools. In Kenya, the booklet was also approved as instructional material for primary schools and teacher training colleges. It has since been out of print, but copies exist in libraries in Sweden, Japan and in the United States.https://www.worldcat.org/title/dinosaria-wa-tendaguru/oclc/729911218  See also  *Dinosaurs *List of African dinosaurs  References   External links  * Museum of Natural History, Berlin * Goethe-Institut Tanzania * E&D; Vision Publishing * Thomas Thiemeyer, homepage of the illustrator German East Africa East Africa East Africa History of German East Africa Tanzanian literature Natural history books Late Jurassic dinosaurs of Africa Tanzanian culture Books about Tanzania Swahili literature 1998 in Tanzania 1998 children's books ","title":"Dinosaurs of Tendaguru"},{"id":"60567256","text":"250px The 2019 United Kingdom wildfires were a series of wildfires which began on 26 February 2019 and ended on 18 May 2019. The series of wildfires was considered unusual due to the fact that they took place early in the year. Areas affected by the wildfires in 2019 included those that had already been burnt by wildfires during the summer of 2018. The fires have created many air pollution problems for the UK. The causes of most of the fires have been attributed to much higher than average temperatures and drought conditions that have prevailed since the spring of 2018. There were 137 wildfires larger than recorded in the United Kingdom in 2019.https://www.nationalgeographic.co.uk/environment-and- conservation/2020/04/british-wildfires-are-getting-more-frequent-heres-what- that This beats the previous record of 79 from 2018. Background Wildfires are a common annual occurrence in the United Kingdom, though they are rarely serious and generally have a limited impact. According to the Forestry Commission, between 2009 and 2017 an average of of land was burned by wildfire incidents every year in England, with the majority covering less than and only five exceeding an area greater than . With the exception of years featuring higher than average rainfall, wildfires in the United Kingdom typically occur in two spells between March and April and July and September, and are uncommon before spring. Controlled burns to manage the growth of heather are permitted in England and Scotland from October until mid-April. The United Kingdom had previously experienced a large number of wildfires in the summer 2018 following spells of high temperatures and low levels of precipitation in the preceding months. Other notable episodes of increased national wildfire activity have occurred with years of lower than average precipitation, such as in 1976, 2003, 2006, and 2011. Causes Elevated temperatures in February and April have been cited as contributory factors to the extent of the wildfires so early in the year. On 26 February the highest winter temperature ever recorded in the United Kingdom was reached with registered at Kew Gardens. This was caused by a high pressure system over central Europe driving air from southern latitudes towards the United Kingdom and Ireland, bringing dry, settled conditions and unseasonably warm weather. England, Scotland and Wales all broke their regional temperature records, with England and Wales exceeding in winter for the first time. The Easter weekend in late April additionally saw very warm conditions. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland all had their hottest Easter Sunday on record on 20 April, with all four countries of the United Kingdom recording their hottest ever Easter Monday temperatures the following day. Comparatively low rainfall over the winter was also suggested as increasing the probability of the wildfires, with the lack of moisture combining with the high temperatures in February to dry out vegetation, creating an easily flammable source within the grasslands and moorlands at an earlier stage of the year than usual. A spell of dry weather during the middle of April was also described by the Met Office as a factor that heightened the risk of the later fires. The impact of climate change in partly driving conditions conducive to wildfires in the United Kingdom is uncertain. Research does however suggest the probability of wildfires across moorlands in the Peak District will increase with warmer and drier weather. February Fires in three separate locations across England and Scotland broke out on 26 February, the day that saw the country's warmest winter temperature on record. Two separate fires reported one hour apart struck Ashdown Forest in West Sussex that afternoon, affecting of woodland, with a third noted shortly afterwards. The fires caused no injuries and were brought under control by 5pm that day after sixty-five firefighters attended the scene. It was later revealed that the first two fires had been unintentionally started by volunteers clearing gorse from the woodland, with an unexpected rush of wind and warm temperatures blowing a managed burn out of control. Other fires reported during the day included a grassland blaze Lancashire, a gorse fire in Glyndyfrdwy, Denbighshire, in which a man was taken to hospital after being trapped in his tractor by the flames, and in Aberdare. Emergency services also responded to several fires on Cornwall's Lizard peninsula thought to be caused by arson. Later on the evening of 26 February a fire broke out on Saddleworth Moor in West Yorkshire, rapidly spreading across . The same night saw approximately of gorse burn at Arthur's Seat in Edinburgh, prompting almost 200 calls to the emergency services. By the morning of 27 February both fires were brought under control, though Public Health England advised residents of communities close to Saddleworth Moor to remain indoors and close windows to avoid inhaling smoke. Though there were no reported injuries at Arthur's Seat, concerns were raised over the fire's impact on rare species living at the site, such as the bordered brown lacewing, whose distribution across the United Kingdom comprised just one other site in Scotland.

On 20 April Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire was ablaze with two fires covering an area of approximately . Fire crews remained on the moor for two days and a man was later charged with arson. On 21 April a barbecue caused a second fire in the county to break out on Marsden Moor, a Site of Special Scientific Interest thirty-five miles away, drawing more than fifty firefighters to the site. More than of moorland was affected, destroying more than ¬£200,000 of habitat restoration work and imperiling the nesting sites of rare birds, such as curlews, whose populations in the United Kingdom are considered under threat. By 23 April the National Trust, the owners of Marsden Moor, reported that the fire had spread to cover and described it as the most substantial blaze to hit the area for years. Other fires across England in late April included a series of twelve blazes over Dartmoor on 22 April, with eight crews battling burning vegetation spanning . A moorland fire near Tintwistle in Derbyshire was also tackled on the same day. ;Scotland 250px The evening of 13 April saw a forest fire emerge between Loch Bradan and Loch Doon in East Ayrshire, the source of which, while unknown, was suggested by the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service (SFRS) to have been exacerbated by the recent dry weather. Thirty-five firefighters also tackled a fire near Ballindalloch in Moray that evening, and helped by a helicopter waterbombing the area the blaze was extinguished by the afternoon of 15 April. Emergency services were further alerted on 14 April to two fires in the Scottish Highlands near Kinbrace in Sutherland and near John O'Groats. On 19 April the SFRS issued a wildfire warning and urged the public to abide by the Scottish Outdoor Access Code to minimise any further risk of fire formation. That day a number of fires across moorland and grassland on the Isle of Bute were extinguished with no injuries. A blaze covering later broke out in Lochaber on 21 April, and flames took hold of grassland in West Dunbartonshire on the evening of 22 April. A wildfire broke out in Knockando, Scotland on the 22nd around 3pm. It was described as 'one of the largest fires the UK has seen in years'. In the first day, the fire destroyed more than . The blaze created a plume of smoke that could be seen from space. By the 25th, firefighters thought they had tackled most of the blaze and left the scene. However, they were called back on the 26th when it was reignited. This further fire destroyed , as of the 29th. At its height, around 80 firefighters, two helicopters, 19 fire engines and specialist resources were called upon to help tackle the fire, which was on four fronts. At its height, around 80 firefighters, two helicopters, 19 fire engines and specialist resources were called upon to help tackle the fire, which was on four fronts. Additionally, the fire caused several nearby properties to be evacuated. The fire was fully extinguished by 9 May. ;Wales In Wales a series of grassland fires on the Gower peninsula were reported over three days to 15 April, causing local road closures and raising concerns over the potential ecological damage. That evening two large grassland fires fanned by strong winds spread in Rhondda Cynon Taff and Rhigos before being extinguished the following morning. May On 13 May the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service issued a wildfire warning for parts of Scotland after temperatures were forecast to rise above 20¬∞C. The day before a fire had broken out between Melvich and Strathy in the Scottish Highlands which burned for six days and destroyed of Flow Country peatland across Caithness and Sutherland, including approximately of the Forsinard Flows National Nature Reserve. Electricity to 800 households in Sutherland was also disrupted. Control over the blaze was assisted by rainfall over the night of 17-18 May, which also helped tackle a further fire burning across heath and woodland to the south of Forres in Moray since 16 May. A study published at the end of 2019 by WWF Scotland estimated that the Flow Country fire doubled Scotland's carbon emissions for the six days it was active by releasing 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent stored within the peatland. In England firefighters returned to Ilkley Moor in West Yorkshire on the morning of 18 May after the area was set ablaze for the second time in the space of a month.

History  In the 1950s in South Africa, military units were attached to each large university. The University of the Orange Free State acquired an artillery capability. The concept was for long term students to complete their obligatory military training in these units. Training would also be organised so as not to unduly interfere with university work. This unit could be considered a offshoot of the Regiment Potchefstroom Universiteit as that unit's Survey Battery was transferred to the University of the Orange Free State in the early 1950s.

In his own words: *Ustad Vilayat Khan, in his autobiographical accounts, mentioned about his acquaintances with and admiration to Nirmalendu Choudhury through a story which is heart touching. In 1955 Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India, visited Russia, and an Indian Cultural delegation accompanied him where Ustad Vilayat Khan was a member. Since then many years passed. Sometime during 1990s Khan Sahib called his friend in Kolkata and asked about a song which he heard in Russia in 1955, a song sung by an Indian folk singer, who was none other than Nirmaendu Chowdhury. Namita Devidayal writes: *Manabendra Mukherjee saw Nirmalendu in a music program at Beliaghata some time in the 1950s. In an interview taken by Sri Nimai Bhattacharya on behalf of Door Darshan Kolkata, Manabendra narrated the story. There was a heavy gathering of audience in the tune of five thousand people. Artists were waiting for the program to start. Suddenly the power went out and the microphone stopped working. In this situation one young man approached and offered to sing in front of the impatient audience without microphone. When he was allowed, he mesmerized the audience and charmed all artists with his deep and open voice and songs of the boatmen and the farmers of rural Bengal. When asked what his name was it was learnt that he was none other than Nirmalendu. Death Nirmalendu died in Kolkata on 18 April 1981. His son Utpalendu Choudhury carried on the task of propagating and popularizing folk music in line with his father until he died on 6 February 2011.

The main event was the Eponymous Rey del Ring tournament, the fourteenth annual version of the tournament, which is IWRG's version of WWE's Royal Rumble 30-man elimination match. The event was also the 54th Anniversary of Lucha Libre in Estado de M√©xico In the main event M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. outlasted 29 wrestlers, lastly eliminating Pirata Morgan to win the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship. After the match, M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Pirata Morgan continued to fight until a challenge was made for a Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\" between the two. In the semi-final match, champion Drag√≥n Fly successfully defended the AIWA Cruiserweight Championship against long time rival Demonio Infernal. The event also gained notoriety for a backstage incident where Alberto el Patr√≥n beat up Tortuga Rafy after a perceived insult. Production =Background= In 2002 the Mexican professional wrestling company International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; at times referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Mexico) held their first ever Rey del Ring (\\"King of the Ring\\") event, presenting the eponymous Rey del Ring tournament for the first time. IWRG's Rey del Ring match is a 30-man elimination match similar in concept to the WWE's Royal Rumble match, except that in the Rey del Ring match eliminations can also happen via pinfall or submission. From 2002 until the 2011 event the \\"prize\\" for winning the match itself was simply the prestige of outlasting 29 other competitors but did not give the winner any tangible prize. At the 2011 Rey del Ring IWRG introduced the IWR Rey del Ring Championship complete with a belt to symbolize the championship, this belt would be awarded to the winner each year. At that point in time the Rey del Ring title became a championship that could be defended and lost or won in matches in between the annual tournaments. When it is time for the tournament the reigning Rey del Ring champion would vacate the championship. All Rey del Ring shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general are held in Arena Naucalpan, owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2016 Rey del Ring was the 15th overall Rey del Ring tournament and show to be held by IWRG, as well as the first to be held in the month of December. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Event In the opening match, rookies and FILL trainees Black Drag√≥n and Fireman defeated fellow trainees Adrenalina and Ara√±a de Plata two falls to one. In the second match of the night Drag√≥n Fly defended the AIWA Argentina Cruiserweight Championship against long-time rival Demonio Infernal as the storyline feud between the two continued to build and evolve. In the end, Drag√≥n Fly was successful, pinning Demonio Infernal to retain his championship. Prior to the main event previous IWRG Rey del Ring Champion El Hijo de M√°scara A√±o 2000 came to the ring to surrender the Rey del Ring championship belt that would be awarded to this year's winner of the 30-man Rey del Ring match. The match started with 4 men in the ring, with another wrestler joining the match every two minutes. Wrestlers could be eliminated by being thrown over the top rope, or by pinfall or submission. The 30 man field was narrowed down to M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. and Pirata Morgan as the final two. During the closing moments of the match Pirata Morgan Jr. assisted his father, while Golden Magic tried to prevent the interference. During the fight, both Pirata Morgan Jr. and Golden Magic had had their masks pulled off, and ended up wearing their opponents' masks instead. M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. pinned Pirata Morgan to claim the championship. =Backstage Incident= During the show Alberto el Patr√≥n was backstage, visiting his brother El Hijo de Dos Casas along with his then-fianc√©e Paige. During the visit Rafy, of Las Tortugas Ninja, encountered Paige and made, what el Patr√≥n claimed, an inappropriate interaction with Paige. This led to el Patr√≥n attacking Rafy, beating him up backstage during the show. Rafy later explained that he did not intentionally meant to be disrespectful towards Paige, but admitted his words could have been better chosen. Aftermath The main event rivalry between M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr.and Pirata Morgan led to a Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet match\\") where both men risked their hair as part of the Arena Naucalpan 39th Anniversary Show that M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr. won, leaving Pirata Morgan bald. He successfully defended the IWRG Rey del Ring Championship twice, first against Pirata Morgan and later against Trauma I. M√°scara A√±o 2000 Jr was forced to vacate the championship prior to the 2017 Rey del Ring show. The rivalry between Golden Magic and Pirata Morgan Jr. that began in the closing moments of the Rey del Ring show continued over subsequent IWRG shows. The two were paired up for a Relevos suicida match in the main event of the Arena Naucalpan 39h Anniversary Show as they faced off against the teams of Pantera I and Killer Jr. / Imposible and Rel√°mpago. Both wrestlers survived the match without losing their mask. At the Prisi√≥n Fatal show Pirata Mogan Jr. lost a steel cage match to Imposible, a match that also included Golden Magic, and had to unmask. The feud between the two concluded at the February M√°scara vs. Cabellera show, where Golden Magic finally pinned his opponent, to earn the right to shave all Pirata Morgan Jr.'s hair off.

Opened, in 1872 in Barcelona, they were almost exclusively for women from the start. They closed in 1988, and were demolished in 1990. The baths were important for several reasons. First, they represented a safe place for lesbians who faced repression from Francoist Spain. They were also important for women in Barcelona in general, because the all-women space allowed women to wear clothing like bikinis or no clothing at all. The baths have been remembered at a feminist book fair and as part of an exhibition about women in Francoist Spain.  History  The baths were located at the Barceloneta beach. The Ba√±os Orientales were opened in 1872 in Barcelona with a neo-Arab architectural style. This was a period which saw over a dozen new spa projects open along city beaches. Others included Junta de Damas, La Deliciosa, La Florida, Estrella, San Sebasti√°n, Sirena, Neptuno, Trit√≥n, and Pabell√≥n del Ej√©rcito. The baths were one of two original located in the parish of Sant Miquel del Port. They had an 18 meter diameter pool. A storm later that year destroyed the bath's pool. The baths were almost exclusively for women from the start. In 1987, in a period that saw a large number of rats invading Barcelona beaches, a patrol of the Gu√†rdia Urbana discovered rats in the pool of the Ba√±os Orientales. When cleaning services arrived to deal with the issue, they collected 50 total rats. Bathers and swimmers were advised on another occasion to take showers and avoid entering the water because of the rat problem. People at the beach were not amused by this. It was announced in 1988 that baths were to be demolished as part of a broader plan by the Municipal Government to modernize the city's beaches. The baths were destroyed on 22 November 1990. Thirty women chained themselves to the fence of the Ba√±os Orientales in an attempt to stave off their destruction. The police had no sympathy for the protesters. They cut the wires they used to chain them to the fence. With protests still shouting and heavy rain starting, the bulldozers started to advance towards the baths. Protests ran inside the baths to try to save as much as they could from them.  Political context  Lesbians had few places of their own in Francoist Spain as a result of repression, not just against lesbians and LGBT people but against women in general. One of the few places where lesbians gathered in numbers was at the Ba√±os Orientales. The baths were popular with all classes of women in Barcelona. Bikinis were first introduced in the 1950s in Spain, but were highly disapproved of by the government. Some women used their bikinis, brought in from France, at the baths. Using them elsewhere risked fines from the Guardia Civil. During the 1970s, the baths were women only, and women would often go topless. Some women brought their children, including boys, with them to the baths in this period. The baths themselves turned a blind eye to women's behavior in this period. During the Francoist period, grown men would often hang around near the fence to the facility, being voyeurs and hoping to see topless and naked women that were alleged to be swimming there.  Remembrance and historical memory  In 1990, the IV International Feminist Book Fair was held in Atarazanas, Barcelona with about 300 booksellers having booths. As part of the celebrations, \\"A Night of Mediterranean Music\\" was held at the location where the Ba√±os Orienteles used to be. The baths were mentioned as part of an exhibit titled Mujeres bajo sospecha. Memoria y sexualidad (1930-1980) in 2013 organized by UNED Sociology professor Raquel Osborne at the Ateneo de Madrid.

It seeks to empower African women in the fields of politics and the economy on the local, national, regional and international levels. It pursues these goals by educating through workshops, research, publishing and consultations. ABANTU attracts international attention through its offices in London, where it was founded in 1991 by African women. Its other offices are in Kenya, Tanzania, Ghana, and Nigeria. ABANTU has a special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). Organisation An international non-governmental organisation (INGO), ABANTU was founded in 1991 in London by African women, including its future director Wanjiru Kihoro. The name Abantu means \\"people\\" in many African languages. Its present-day main offices are in London, United Kingdom; Nairobi, Kenya; and Tanzania. The regional office for West Africa is located in Accra, Ghana (Regional Programme Manager Rose Mensah-Kutin); and there is a branch office in Nigeria. ABANTU is an umbrella organisation for many smaller organisations. It works by formalising per-existing local and domestic networks of women and turning them into a political force. ABANTU has a special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC). It is also part of Gender Action on Climate Change for Equality and Sustainability. ABANTU has also collaborated with the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa and the Organisation of African Unity. Although ABANTU maintains links with non- African organisations, its focus is on maintaining indigenous control. Its status in the ECOSOC and central offices in London have contributed to success in attaining donors. In Africa, it is particularly known in the West African region. Goals ABANTU pursues to empower African women as decision makers on the local, national, regional and international levels. It seeks to increase women's participation in both politics and the economy, and erase political, legal and cultural barriers to women's equal standing before the law and their economic independence. Mobilizing women to further sustainable development in Africa is also on its agenda. The organisation has identified four areas of key interest: gender and poverty, gender and conflict, gender and governance, and gender and information and communication technologies. Although ABANTU focuses on women, it holds a view that pursuing women's interests is equally beneficial to men. Activities ABANTU uses three primary methods to reach its goals: training and capacity building; research, publication and communications; and advocacy, public awareness and networking. ABANTU has more than 500 trainers from its workshops in Africa and the United Kingdom. These trainers conduct gender and policy analysis and host workshops in their countries on themes such as gender stereotypes, social change, climate change and support of HIV-infected workers. ABANTU employs adult learning techniques and recognises that men and women learn differently. In addition to workshops, it organises seminars, forums on public policy and consultations with policy makers and other women's organisations. It has, for instance, produced a manual on taking women into account in budgeting in Africa that was chosen for a trial-run, and participated in the drafting of the Women's Manifesto for Ghana. ABANTU's series of Gender and Poverty Hearings in Eastern and Southern Africa have contributed to transparency of government policies. ABANTU publishes research reports and ABANTU News, a quarterly newsletter on a wide range of topics, such as health practices, sexual assault and women's issues in elections. The organisation also hosts its own radio programme, Gender Forum. ABANTU's research has highlighted the gendered nature of armed conflict, development policy and the effects of climate change.

It is the 2nd Act of 1987. According to this act, all records and correspondences, laws, proceedings in court and other legal actions must be written in the Bengali language in all courts, government or semi-government offices, and autonomous institutions in Bangladesh. The act is considered \\"a revolutionary step taken by the State\\" to empower common people's language and to remove language barrier installed by the colonial British authority obstructing people's access to public services and justice. Consequently, all subsequent laws by Jatiya Sangsad have been passed in Bengali since 1987. Notwithstanding the Act, English is often used by the Supreme Court of Bangladesh resulting in popular discontent that the constitutional and democratic right of the people are getting violated despite the bloodshed by the martyrs of the Bengali language movement. In February every year, the Act is discussed in seminars and newspaper op-eds.  Background  Silver Taka with Bengali script from the alt= Bangladesh is a language-based nation state. The Bengali language has developed over the course of more than 1,300 years and became one of the most prominent and diverse literary traditions in the world. Bengali was an official court language during the Sultanate of Bengal. Muslim rulers promoted the literary development in Bengali. Bengali literature, with its millennium-old literary history, has extensively developed since the Bengali Renaissance. The Bengali language movement from 1948 to 1956 demanding Bengali to be an official language of Pakistan fostered Bengali nationalism in East Bengal (renamed East Pakistan in 1956) leading to the emergence of Bangladesh in 1971. Bengali was adopted as an official language of Pakistan along with Urdu in the article 214(1) when the first constitution of Pakistan was enacted on 29 February 1956. In 1999, UNESCO recognized 21 February as International Mother Language Day in recognition of the Bengali language movement. After the liberation of Bangladesh in 1971, the third article of the Constitution of Bangladesh states Bengali to be the sole official language of the country. With more than 98% of Bangladeshis fluent in Bengali as their first language, Bangladesh is the only monolingual country in South Asia and Bengali is regarded as the de facto national language of Bangladesh. On 8 March 1987, the Government of Bangladesh introduced the Bengali Language Implementation Act, 1987 to ensure mandatory use of Bengali in all domestic affairs except in the cases of foreign relations. Previously on 12 March 1975, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman during his tenure as the President ordered in a government notification that all official activities in all courts and government offices must be performed in Bengali. Bengali is the 5th largest language by number of native speakers and 7th largest language by total number of speakers in the world. The Bengali language is the quintessential element of Bangladeshi identity and binds together a culturally diverse region.Shaheed Minar commemorates the martyrs of the Bengali language movement who scarified their lives to make Bengali the official language of their country. alt=  Provisions  = Section 3 = 3(1) After the introduction of this Act, all records and correspondences, laws, proceedings in court and other legal actions must be written in Bengali in all courts, government or semi-government offices, and autonomous institutions in Bangladesh. 3(2) If any one submits an appeal or petition at any offices mentioned in clause 3(1) in any language other than Bengali, the appeal or petition will be considered illegal and ineffective. 3(3) If any government staff or officer breaches this act, he or she will be accused of violating Bangladesh Civil Servant Order and Appeal Rules, and necessary actions will be taken against him or her. = Section 4 = 4 By notification in the official gazette, the government can create and impose necessary rules to enforce this Act. Implementation =Legislation and administration= Following the act, all legislative and administrative activities are being done in Bengali since 1987. =In the judiciary= In all district courts, Bengali is the medium of communication both for speaking and writing petitions and verdicts; but in the Supreme Court, verdicts are often delivered in English. On 9 February 2011, Bangladesh Law Commission recommended that the Act be implemented in the Supreme Court as well to ensure easy access to justice for all. Bangladesh Law Commission also stated that application of Bengali in all sphere of public life would be the proper way to observe Language Movement Day. The then chairman of Law Commission, Shah Alam wrote that due to the vested interest of certain quarter, Bengali was not being applied properly in the Supreme Court. Some suggested that \\"under section 137 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 and section 558 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 Bangladesh government may issue Order making use of Bengali mandatory in superior and subordinate judiciary.\\" = In the financial sector = While Bengali is predominantly used in the official activities of Bangladesh Bank, Bengali has a marginal presence in the commercial private banks to the dismay of their respective clients as most of them find it difficult to navigate through their financial documents in English. In 2018, Bangladesh Bank instructed all banks to use Bengali \\"in loan approval letters for implementing the goal of the Bengali Language Introduction Act, 1987 and protecting the client‚Äôs interest.\\" = In other areas of public life = In February 2014, following a writ petition by an advocate named Yunus Ali Akand at the High Court, Justice Qazi Rezaul Haque issued a rule that Bengali should be used everywhere in Bangladesh, in all offices, courts and media, following the act of 1987. He further instructed that Bengali should be used on signboards, billboards, number plate of motor vehicles and all electronic media excluding foreign high embassies. Three months later, the Ministry of Public Administration ordered all city corporations, and cantonment boards to implement the high court rule. Then again on 23 February 2016, the Ministry of Public Administration gave the same instruction, but the proper implementation is yet to be seen. Reception The act has been considered significant to empower people's language and remove colonial linguistic oppression. Muhammad Habibur Rahman, a former Chief Justice of Bangladesh stated that due to the lack of proper government initiative, English is still used frequently in the Supreme Court. Rahman further stated that if justice is a virtue and a service to the people, then verdicts should be given in Bengali. He also stated that if the people of the country want that all works in the Supreme Court must be operated in Bengali, then the representatives of the people in the Jatiya Sangsad (Parliament of Bangladesh) must enact and implement another law to ensure the use of Bengali in the Supreme Court. Sheikh Hasina, the incumbent and longest serving Prime Minister of Bangladesh, also suggested that the judges should deliver their verdicts in Bengali so that every Bangladeshi can read them.

Coalowners and others needed transport to get their products to market and lines were built from the main line into the mineral-bearing area. The topography was difficult and gradients were steep. The Great Western Railway became dominant, but a rival company built a competing line and branches. Brymbo was surrounded by a maze of duplicating branch lines serving pits and quarries and a passenger service was started on some routes. Brymbo became the centre of a considerable iron and steelmaking activity but the industry declined before World War II and in the 1960s it reduced considerably. The passenger service was discontinued, and mineral traffic declined as its customers ceased to trade. There is no railway in the area at the present day. North Wales Mineral Railway The North Wales Coalfield runs from near Talacre at the mouth of the River Dee through Wrexham to Oswestry. The coal and associated iron industries became active from the early-eighteenth century, but poor transport links to markets suppressed the potential of the trade. The North Wales Mineral Railway (NWMR) was promoted locally to connect pits and ironworks to Chester and wharves on the River Dee. Its title signified the intent, but differences with pit owners meant that connections to pits were not included in the Parliamentary Bill. The North Wales Mineral Railway obtained the Royal Assent to its Act of Incorporation on 6 August 1844, for a line from Wrexham to a river wharf at Saltney, and a junction with the Chester and Holyhead Railway at Saltney, was authorised in the same session. The C&HR; connection gave access to Chester. An extension to Ruabon was authorised on 21 July 1845, and the Act included a branch from Wheatsheaf, north of Wrexham, to Brymbo and Minera. A third Act on 27 July 1846, authorised short branches to collieries at Ffrwd,Some sources spell the place Ffrwyd, but that is a mistake. Brynmally, Brymbo and Vron.Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas Publisher, Nairn, 1991, , pages 36 and 37 On to Shrewsbury The Chester and Holyhead Railway announced its intention to build a line from Chester to Shrewsbury, the Cheshire and Shrewsbury Junction Railway. It would abstract a large proportion of the NWMR's income, and to counter the threat, the NWMR devised its own scheme to extend the NWMR southwards, the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Junction Railway which was authorised on 30 June 1845. The Cheshire and Shropshire Junction scheme was rejected. The NWMR and the Shrewsbury, Oswestry and Chester Junction Railway together formed a through route and a year later, authorised by Act of Parliament on 7 July 1846 they merged as the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway.Baughan, pages 37 to 39 Lines opened The Brymbo and Minera branch in 1847The main line from Ruabon to Saltney opened on 4 November 1846; the Company got access to Chester over a short section of the Chester and Holyhead Railway; this section opened on the same day; there were five passenger trains each way daily. Opening on to Shrewsbury followed in 1848. The branch line from Wheatsheaf through Brymbo to Minera was open in July 1847 and the other local branches, to pits at Gwersyllt and Broughton, were ready and open in November 1847. Together these connected a large number of pits and works, and the large lime deposits of Minera, to the railway network.J I C Boyd, The Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway, Oakwood Press, Headington, 1991, , pages 45 to 46 Boyd later adds that \\"two small branches off it ran to Brynmally and Ffrwd, opening in the November [1847]: in due time Westminster, Southsea, Brymbo and Vron Collieries were also rail served off the Minera Branch.Boyd, page 50 The line left the NWMR main line near an inn called the Wheatsheaf, and the junction took that name; not far from the junction the line climbed an inclined plane, called the Wheatsheaf or Summerhill Incline, at a gradient of 1 in 15. The section was operated on the balance system. At the head of the incline the line passed through a Summerhill Tunnel, 200 yards long. Now at the lower end of the Moss Valley, the line ran to the next incline, the Moss or Cerni incline, gradient 1 in 4. This was also a balanced incline. At the head of this incline the line entered Brymbo Tunnel, 396 yards, and soon reached the Brymbo Iron Works, operated by the Brymbo Mineral and Railway Company from 3 October 1842.The reference to \\"railway\\" in the company's title refers to the extensive siding and internal network at Brymbo.Boyd, pages 47 and 48 At first horse traction, and gravity, were used on the line, but a small locomotive is reported to have been brought in later, generally operating from Brymbo to Minera.Boyd, page 49 LNWR branch line In 1849 the Mold Railway opened, from near Chester to Mold. A branch line was opened at the same time, from Mold to Ffrith, where there were pits near the margin of the coalfield. The terrain was extremely difficult and the line had steep gradients. The Mold Railway was in the camp of the London and North Western Railway, and that company thereby had its first foothold in the area.Baughan, page 50 Wrexham and Minera Railway The Wrexham and Minera Railway in 1862The earlier (1847) branch from Wheatsheaf Junction to Minera via Brymbo was difficult to work, having two rope-worked inclines. As the mineral extraction in the area developed, the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway promoted a new line, the Wrexham and Minera Railway, which obtained the Royal Assent on 17 May 1861. It followed a longer, southerly course to gain height with gentler gradients, although they were still daunting. It ran from a junction south of Wrexham, at Croes Newydd, to Brymbo, where it joined the earlier branch line. It opened on 22 May 1862. Traffic to and from Minera continued to use the earlier railway west of Brymbo. The Moss (western) incline on the original Minera line was not required, and it was closed. The eastern incline continued in use for the time being, serving Moss and Westminster collieries.Baughan, page 51Boyd, pages 48 and 49 The situation in 1865 Site of the Brymbo Summerhill inclined plane in 2019The Mining Journal of 29 July 1865 summarised the railway situation at the time: > The only railway accommodation in this district at the moment is that > afforded by the Great Western Railway... there is a steep incline (The > Wheatsheaf Incline) averaging about 1 in 15 for about half a mile in length > up which the empty trucks are drawn with a wire rope by the weight of the > full trucks coming down. At the top of this incline there is a short tunnel > which brings the line into the Moss Valley close by the Moss Pits of the > Westminster Colliery. From this two branches go up the valley, one on the > west side to Mr Clayton‚Äôs Bryn Mally Pits and another on the east side to Mr > Clayton‚Äôs Pendwllyn Pits and to the Frood Pits and blast furnaces. From the > Moss Valley to the Brymbo Valley the line was carried up the west side of > the Moss Valley opposite the tunnel by a very steep incline (The Moss Valley > Incline) of nearly 1 in 4 then through a tunnel about a quarter of a mile > long which opened into the Brymbo Valley nearly opposite the Brymbo > furnaces. > In the Brymbo Valley two branches were extended south, one on the east side > of the Valley to the Nant Pits of the Westminster Company and to the pits of > the Broughton Company and another on the west side of the Valley to the pits > of the Vron Colliery. Northward the line is continued skirting the western > side of the Brymbo Valley until it debouches into a branch valley of the > Nantyffrith along which, skirting the outcrop of the measures, it continues > its course tor about three miles to the Minera lime quarries and lead mining > district. > As far as the Moss Valley (comprising the Moss pits of the Westminster > Company and the Bryn Malley and Erood Pits) was concerned this arrangement > gave sufficient accommodation. No practical difficulty was found in working > any reasonable traffic over the Wheatsheaf Incline. With regard to the > Brymbo Valley (including the Brymbo, Vron and Broughton Pits) the case was > very different. The Moss Valley Incline was a serious stumbling block over > which it was practically found that no considerable traffic could be worked. > When the pressure came it was found impossible to time the full trucks so as > to bring up the empties so that it more than once happened that the > collieries were brought to a standstill in a time of flourishing trade for > want of trucks which were lying at the bottom of the incline almost within > sight of the pits where they were required. This was to some extent met by > the erection of a stationary steam engine at the top of the Moss Valley > Incline for the purpose of drawing up the empty trucks, an arrangement which > was found to palliate but not to remedy the evil.

It was built from Wrexham to join the Buckley Railway, a former horse tramway that had been upgraded, and together the two short lines gave access to a wharf on the River Dee, and to a connection with the Chester and Holyhead Railway. The line opened on 1 January 1866, for mineral traffic, and for passengers after improvements, on 1 May 1866. There was a short spur to the Ffrwd Colliery, and a short spur to Brynmally. These were apparently the only WM&CQR; branches in the Wrexham area at first.Baughan, page 54Boyd, pages 106, 122, 133 and 134 Wrexham and Minera Extension Railway The LNWR (through the Chester and Holyhead Railway) had built a branch line from Mold to coal pits at Tryddyn (Treuddyn), near Coed Talon. The point of junction on the Mold main line was called Tryddyn Junction. On 5 July 1865 the Wrexham and Minera Railway (which was of course a GWR satellite) obtained powers to extend from Brymbo to join the Tryddyn line. This would give the GWR access to Mold, then an important market town. For the purposes of the Act it was known as the Wrexham and Minera Extension Railway. Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway The LNWR wanted access to Brymbo and negotiation resulted in transfer of the powers (no construction work had yet been done on the railway) were transferred to the GWR and LNWR jointly by Act of 11 June 1866, and the proposed line became known as the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway.It did not, of course, approach either Wrexham or Minera. Pits at Coed Talon and Ffrith were being developed at this time, and the LNWR decided that the earlier Tryddyn line was unsuitable. A new line was authorised from a new Ffrith Junction, near Padeswood on the Mold line, to Ffrith, making a junction with the Tryddyn line at Coed Talon. The new LNWR line (from Ffrith Junction to Ffrith) was opened in 1870, and the original Tryddyn line was closed, although it was reopened later. The joint line on to Brymbo was not yet ready.Baughan, pages 55 and 56Mark Casson, The World's First Railway System: Enterprise, Competition, and Regulation on the Railway Network in Victorian Britain, Oxford University Press, 2009, , page 218 As authorised, the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway was to run from Brymbo to Coed Talon, but before opening it was altered. Train operation was to be joint; at one time trains were operated by the LNWR and GWR on alternate days. However the infrastructure was divided, the LNWR having sole responsibility on the Coed Talon side of a point 2m 67 ch from Brymbo, near Pantystain level crossing. A boundary stone is clearly marked on contemporary maps, and the Joint Line ran from Brymbo to the boundary stone.Cooke, page 92Quick, for example Ffrith station, page 127Railway Clearing House Junction Diagrams 1915, David & Charles Reprints, Newton Abbot, 1969, , page 119 > By an Act of 1871 the Wrexham & Minera Joint system was divided as between > the GWR/LNWR jointly and the GWR alone; an end-on junction was determined at > a point south of Coed Talon and north of Llanfynydd where mileposts were set > up showing the distance to Paddington (to the south) and to Euston (to the > north). The immediate mileage north of Brymbo (GW) became the responsibility > of the GWR.

What > becomes of the other two days I do not know.Evidence and argument in the > House of Lords Committee for the 1881 WMCQR (Extensions and Dock) Bill, > quoted in Boyd, page 175 The line between Coed Talon and Brymbo, nearly three miles in length, opened to goods trains on 27 January 1872. It continued to be known as \\"the Joint Line\\". The Wrexham and Minera Railway joins the GWR The original Wrexham and Minera Railway (from Wrexham to Brymbo, but inactive west of Moss) vested in the GWR in 1871. GWR: Moss Valley branch and Brymbo line improvements The GWR built a Moss Valley branch of 3 miles, authorised on 21 July 1873, and opened on 11 May 1881;Baughan gives this date on page 56, but adds: \\"Some sources give 20 March 1882.\\" Boyd gives 8 May 1881 on page 172. it ran up to Ffrwd Ironworks from a junction with the W&MR; main line half a mile west of Croes Newydd, through Gatewen, and Gwersyllt, and intersecting the original eastern inclined plane there, continuing north from there. The inclined plane was retained, as it served other industrial sites. It was finally closed in October 1908.Boyd gives October 1907. Gwersyllt Colliery had a connection below the inclined plane and for the time being continued to be connected direct from Wheatsheaf Junction after 1908.Boyd, pages 171, 172 and 179Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Newton Abbot, 1984, , page 21 The GWR Wrexham to Brymbo line was doubled, and opened to passengers on 24 May 1882.Baughan, page 60 Gatewen branch built privately The WM&CQR; had been built in part because of dissatisfaction with facilities provided to coal owners and others by the monopoly GWR. Now that the WM&CQR; main line had been built, there was increasingly bitter complaint from those not reached by the limited branch network of the Wrexham company. In 1881 the proprietors of the Gatewen Colliery decided to build a branch line themselves, from Stansty on the Wrexham line. The junction later became Brymbo North Junction. The line was built without Parliamentary authority, and opened on 8 or 17 June 1882. WM&CQR; improvements The Brymbo lines in 1888After a period of dormancy forced by lack of money, the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway obtained powers on 25 July 1882 to improve its main line. At the same time, it was disclosed that the Ffrwd and Brynmally branches were out of use due to lack of traffic.Boyd, page 182 Nevertheless, the 1882 Act authorised a new WM&CQR; branch to Brymbo.This unwelcome incursion was hotly opposed in Parliament by the GWR. The line as approved was from triangular junction near Gwersyllt to Brymbo; the northern arm of the triangular junction was the privately built Gatewen Colliery line, soon to be called Brymbo Junction. The line would connect Plas Power colliery (newly opened, and already served by the GWR line) and the Brymbo works, with a southward line from Brymbo to Vron, parallelling the GWR Vron branch. There would also be a southward extension from Brynmally to the Westminster Colliery. Gradients on these lines would be stiff.Boyd, page 177Boyd, page 182 onwards The Brymbo line opened to Moss & Pentre in 1882, and to Plas Power in June 1884, making a junction with the Wrexham and Minera line there. Completion to Brymbo followed in 1887, and the line opened to passengers on 1 August 1889.Baughan, page 58 The line was very steeply graded, climbing all the way to Brymbo, with only short sections of double track. At first there were four trains daily between Wrexham and Brymbo, with two additional trains on Saturday. Notwithstanding the gradients, journey time was 23 minutes in each direction. By 1900 a remarkably frequent passenger service was operated between Wrexham and Brymbo.Boyd, pages 271 to 288 A further branch from Brymbo to Vron Colliery opened on 8 October 1888; this had steep gradients up to 1 in 27.Boyd, pages 266 and 268 A branch from the Ffrwd branch to Westminster Colliery opened on 27 April 1884.Boyd, page 184Boyd, page 264 More passenger routes On 2 May 1898 LNWR passenger trains started running from Mold to Brymbo, using the former joint line. There were four trains a day. On the GWR line from Brymbo to Minera, passenger trains started operating as far as Coed Poeth on 15 November 1897, and the passenger service was extended to Berwig in 1905. From this time the motor-train system favoured by the GWR was used: a single coach incorporated a small steam engine; the arrangement was economical on lightly used passenger services, and a number of motor halts were opened to take advantage of the system. The Moss Valley branch received a similar passenger service from 1 May 1905, running from Wrexham as far up the valley as Moss Platform.Baughan, pages 60 and 61 WM&CQR; absorbed The WM&CQR; had long been in financial difficulties, and acquisition by the Great Central Railway (formerly the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway) was authorised by Act of 22 July 1904; it became effective on 1 January 1905.Boyd, page 231 Passenger train services The Brymbo lines in 1908 with railmotor haltsThe 1910 Bradshaw's Guide shows thirteen trains each way between Wrexham and Brymbo, with most of them continuing to Berwig. There were several additional trains on Saturdays, but none at all on Sundays. All the trains were \\"Motor Cars: One Class Only\\". The term motor car referred to the self contained steam railway coach. The Moss Valley line had ten trains each way, with several additional Saturday-only services. The WM&CQR; line, now shown as \\"Great Central\\", had eleven trains each way, also with several additional Saturday trains. The trains are described as \\"Motor Cars, with the exception of Saturdays after 2 aft.\\". In other words, loadings on Saturday afternoons were expected to be too heavy for the limited capacity of the railmotor vehicles. The route had the advantage of running to the Central station at Wrexham; the GWR Wrexham General station was not situated close to the town centre, but was less convenient for the housing area at Brymbo. This was one of the few areas where the Great Central Railway ran railmotors.Christiansen, page 23 There were four trains each way between Mold and Brymbo, on the LNWR and GWR joint line; there was an additional train on Wednesdays and Saturday.Bradshaw's April 1910 Railway Guide, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, Later in the twentieth century The WM&CQR; passenger service was not consistently profitable, and during the manpower shortage of World War I, its passenger trains were withdrawn, on 1 March 1917.Baughan, page 62 In 1923 the main line railways of Great Britain were \\"grouped\\" into one or other of four new large companies. The Great Central Railway, which now owned the WM&CQR; network, was a constituent of the new London and North Eastern Railway. The Great Western Railway joined with other companies and formed the new Great Western Railway. After 30 December 1930 passenger trains ceased to operate on the GWR Brymbo lines, as a result of road competition. Paradoxically the LNWR and GWR joint service from Mold continued for the time being, providing the only passenger connection to Brymbo. It closed later, on 27 March 1950. The line was severed in 1952, operating from Brymbo as a stub to Ffrith. The GWR Moss Valley line lost its passenger service at the end of 1930, and when Brynmally Colliery closed in 1935 the branch was completely closed.Boyd, page 179 In the 1960s all ordinary goods services in the area were terminated, leaving only a connection for mineral traffic to Brymbo steelworks. This used the WM&CQR; line at the upper extremity (together with the extreme upper end of the GWR Vron branch), and a new connection to the former GWR line at Plas Power, from there running to Croes Newydd. This arrangement was in operation from 1954 until 1958, resuming in 1965 until final extinction in 1970. Rail traffic to the Minera lime works also finished, in 1971. There were eight unmanned crossings on the short branch at the time of closure.Christiansen, page 21 Christiansen adds: > After opencast mining began at Vron, a railhead was established at the site > of Gatewen Colliery, linked first by the part relaying of the WM & CQ Brymbo > branch, and later of the GWR Moss Valley branch from Brymbo North, ending > about 50yd north of the former Brymbo branch underbridge.

It was brought by the Derry City Council requesting that the British government change the official name of the Northern Irish city of Londonderry to Derry in keeping with the council's policy. The request was declined after the judge ruled that as the city was named Londonderry via a Royal Charter, any change could only be made by the Monarch under the Royal Prerogative or by British legislation.  Background  The historic city of Derry in the Kingdom of Ireland was destroyed in 1608. It was rebuilt by members of The Honourable The Irish Society and the livery companies of the City of London. The rebuilt city was granted a Royal Charter by King James I of Ireland giving it the name of Londonderry in recognition of the City of London's part in the rebuilding. A further Royal Charter was issued in 1662 by King Charles II of Ireland affirming the change of name as it stated; \\"We will, ordain, constitute, confirm, and declare that the said city or town of Derry, for ever hereafter be, and shall be named and called the City of Londonderry.\\" The name of the city has been contentious, pictured a vandalised road sign covering up part of Londonderry The city eventually grew to become the second largest city in Northern Ireland after Belfast. In 1984, the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) had gained control of the city council and changed the name of the council from Londonderry City Council to Derry City Council over opposition from unionist members. It was stated then that they needed to petition Queen Elizabeth II for the change to be official for the city name due to the charter. The nationalist-led council replied that they had no intention of \\"petitioning an English Queen to change the name of our Irish city\\". As such, the city's name officially remained as Londonderry. In 2005, the city's solicitor wrote to the Department of the Environment requesting official recognition of Derry being the name of the city, which was denied by the department. As a result, in 2006, the council applied for a judicial review in order to determine if it was legally possible to change the official name of the city, which was granted after the British government continued to call the city Londonderry.  Case  The case was heard at the High Court of Northern Ireland by Justice Weatherup. The council's argument was that they had legally changed the name of the city under the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 and by the Change of District Name (Londonderry) Order (Northern Ireland) 1984 made by the Department of the Environment. The government responded that the council lacked the legal authority to alter the charter as under the Government of Ireland Act 1920, which partitioned Ireland into Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland, it stated that the newly created Parliament of Northern Ireland had no authority over matters concerning The Crown, Royal Prerogative or any titles of honour granted by The Crown as these were \\"excepted matters\\". Justice Weatherup rejected the three arguments made that the council lacked the authority to attempt the change citing that the 1972 act made a clear separation of the authority of The Crown and the Royal Prerogative and that the name of the city was not a title of honour. The government then argued that as Derry City Council was the legal successor to the Londonderry Corporation which ran the city prior to 1972, then the council were obliged to maintain the original name. The court also rejected this assertion stating that there was no legal obligation to continue the name of the Londonderry Corporation. Justice Weatherup then considered if the council had officially changed the name of the city. He viewed that there was a separation between the city and the district and that the council could apply to substitute the name of the district under the 1972 act which was done in 1984; though it was noted that the city did not attempt to alter the name of County Londonderry. He found that the council had legally changed the name of the district but this had no effect on the legal name of the city. In summing up, Justice Weatherup affirmed the authority to change the name of the district was present in the 1972 act but it did not extend to changing the names of cities nor did he agree that any proposed change was \\"necessary or expedient\\". He stated that if the council wished to change the city name, then they needed to petition Privy Council of the United Kingdom and that it was the council's responsibility to pursue that option if they wished. As a result, the judgement of the court was to deny the application of the council confirming that due to the wording of the 1662 Royal Charter, the name of the city could only be changed by the Monarch using the Royal Prerogative or via legislation from the Parliament of the United Kingdom.  Aftermath  Following the ruling, Sinn F√©in councillors stated they would continue to fight for the name change. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) councillor Gregory Campbell said that the court ruling \\"should put the issue to rest\\". Sinn F√©in members on the council often made motions to change the official name of the city from Londonderry to Derry over the following decade; all were defeated in council votes by DUP and SDLP votes. In 2015, a motion in favour of a rename was passed and an official request was made to the government. The request was denied in the House of Lords, with Lord Dunlop stating \\"At this time the Government does not intend to change the name of the City of Londonderry.\\"  References  Law in Northern Ireland Derry (city) County Londonderry 2007 in British law Geographical renaming United Kingdom administrative case law ","title":"Derry City Council, Re Application for Judicial Review"},{"id":"60567672","text":"The Ruabon railway branch lines were a network of railways built to serve the mineral bearing area west of Ruabon, which contained many coal and iron deposits, as well as limestone, and a small but dense network of railways developed to handle the minerals. The Ellesmere Canal connected the area to Chester, for onward transport by coastal shipping. A tramway was opened in 1805 to extend the reach of the canal. When the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway was opened in 1846 ‚Äì 1848 the transport opportunities were transformed, and railway branch lines were built. The S&CR; merged with the Great Western Railway in 1854, and in time all the branches came under GWR control. Short branches were extended into the area west of Ruabon and for some time formed a dense local network. As the population density increased, a local passenger operation was put on, based on Wrexham, the local market town. In the period following World War I the mineral industry declined, and the passenger operation was discontinued. Mineral traffic reduced substantially by 1930, and the whole network was closed in 1963. Ellesmere Canal The mineral deposits, chiefly coal, iron and limestone, in the area immediately west of Ruabon led to an important, but localised, industry there in the eighteenth century. As the volume of production increased, the inadequacy of road transport facilities became more significant, and this led to the construction of the Ellesmere Canal; it opened to Trevor on 26 November 1805, crossing the River Dee by the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct. The basin at Trevor and the locality in generally came to be known as Pont Cysyllte, later Pontcysyllte.The village on the south side of the Dee is Froncysyllte.Charles Hadfield, The Canals of the West Midlands, David & Charles (Publishers), Newton Abbot, 1969, , page 176Peter E Baughan, A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 11: North and Mid Wales, David St John Thomas, Nairn, 1991, , pages 34 to 38 Ruabon Brook Tramway Ruabon area branch lines in 1863The canal company had considered extending the canal northwards to serve mineral extraction sites, but the terrain was difficult for canals, and it built a horse tramway instead. It had obtained powers on 29 June 1804 to build it, and the tramway opened on the same day as the canal, 26 November 1805, and was known as the Ruabon Brook Tramway.Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales\\", David St John Thomas, 1991, , pages 39 and 40 It ran from the canal at Pontcysyllte to Acrefair village, serving Plas Kynaston quarries, colliery and iron works, and brickworks, on the way. It was extended to Plas Madoc colliery by 1808, and later further extended to the Afon Eitha brook.and the Ruabon Brook (Wynn Hall) colliery, south of Rhosllanerchrugog. The total extent was three miles.Donald J Grant, Directory of the Railway Companies of Great Britain, Matador Publishing, Kibworth Beauchamp, 2017, , page 451 The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway opened its trunk line northward from Ruabon (actually Rhosymedre, two miles south) to Chester on 2 November 1846. This connected the industry around Ruabon and Wrexham to the River Dee for onward conveyance by coastal shipping. The company extended its line southwards to Shrewsbury in 1848. This transformed the transport situation, and soon the canal had become obsolescent. The Shrewsbury and Chester Railway merged with the Great Western Railway in 1854. The mineral industry grew rapidly with the improved transport offered by the main line railway, and numerous short branch lines were built to connect to the main line.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 ‚Äì 1863, published by the Great Western Railway, 1927; part 1, pages 342 to 346 Ffron branch to Castle limeworks Castle limeworks railwayThe Fron branch was a short branch line from Pentre, on the main line. It ran west for mile to Chirk Castle Lime Works at Fron, and to a canal wharf near there. It was worked by the Shrewsbury and Chester Railway as part of the main line. Its course was along the north side of the canal, and it then turned at right angles and passed under the canal, immediately resuming its westerly course, now on the south side of the canal. The turns were achieved by wagon turntables. Castle limeworks bridge, RuabonIt is likely that the line opened soon after the main line opened. A little after the Grouping of 1923 (following the Railways Act 1921, when lime traffic was growing‚Äîa contractor was charging 4s od to handle each wagon each way between the Works and the Junction. The line probably closed during World War II.Christiansen, pages 43 and 44 Vale of Llangollen Railway The Vale of Llangollen Railway was opened from a junction south of Ruabon to Llangollen, opened in 1861 (goods) and 1862 (passengers).MacDermot, volume I part 2 page 862 At first simply a short single track branch line, it was later extended to reach Barmouth, and became an important secondary through route.Baughan, page 136 onwards Control of the tramway under the LNWR The owning canal joined with others to form the Shropshire Union Railways and Canal Company, and that company leased its network to the London and North Western Railway in 1847.Hadfield, pages 233 and 234 At this early date it was not unusual for main line railway companies to operate horse tramways at mineral sites, and the little tramway system became an isolated outpost of the LNWR, worked locally by the New British Iron Company, owners of Wynnstay Colliery. It had probably been doing so in the horse-tramway period also.Baughan, pages 52 to 63Rex Christiansen, Forgotten Railways: North and Mid Wales\\", David St John Thomas, 1991, , pages 37 to 43 Conversion of the tramway into a proper railway began in 1861, under the control of the London and North Western Railway. Work began at Pontcysyllte and continued north in stages to Afon Eitha, connecting several short branches to pits and factories, and the final one from Wynn Hall Colliery to Llwyneinion Brickworks, just north of where Rhos station was later built. From completion on 30 January 1867, the railway was worked by the New British Iron Company, which owned Wynnstay Colliery, a major source of traffic until the colliery closed in 1886.Hadfield, page 239 In 1896 the Great Western Railway purchased the former tramway network, by agreement dated 12 February 1896, for the sum of ¬£51,000. Plas Madoc branch line The Plas Madoc branch ran from the GWR line half a mile south of Ruabon to Plas Madoc colliery; it had been built privately, by the coalowner. By the 1880s it was extended across the Ruabon Brook line, crossing it on the level near Pl√¢s y Waen, to brickworks north of Acrefair. Worked at this later period with traffic to and from Delph Brickworks, about two miles from the Shrewsbury and Chester line as part of the GWR, it was formally acquired by them from the LNWR in about 1896.Christiansen, pages 37 and 43 Ponkey and Pontcysyllte branch lines In 1861 the GWR opened a further branch: from a junction just north of Ruabon station to serve blast furnaces at Ponciau (then known as Ponkey) and Aberderfyn, opening on 1 August 1861, and in 1871 27 August 1876 the line was extended to Legacy.From Baughan, page 61; he mentions that MacDermot gives 27 August 1876 for the latter date. In 1896 the GWR purchased the Pontcysyllte line; this was to forestall a feared incursion by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway. The handover took place on 12 February 1896, and the LNWR branch engine returned to its home network.Baughan, pages 61 and 62 The GWR later obtained authorisation to construct a branch line (the \\"Rhos\\" branch) from a junction south of Wrexham to Legacy, making new connections there with the Ponkey branch and the Plas Madoc branch.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway: volume II: 1863 ‚Äì 1921, published by the Great Western Railway, 1931, page 601 This new group of branches opened on 1 October 1901. The Pontcysyllte line was extended at the south end to Trevor goods yard on the Ruabon-Llangollen line. A quarter-mile section between the station and Trefynant brickworks had been constructed by the owners, J. C. Edwards, and the GWR worked over it by agreement, for goods traffic only. Development Ruabon area branch lines in 1906The Great Western Railway made several efforts to operate worthwhile passenger services, but buses and the Wrexham-Rhos electric street tramway developed as stiff competition. Passenger trains were introduced between Wrexham and Rhos in 1901. As elsewhere on the GWR system, railmotors enabled a passenger service on local routes where patronage was not heavy; from 1 May 1905 a passenger service ran on the Pontcysyllte branch, and from 5 June 1905 southwards from Legacy on the Ponkey branch. The northern section of that line survived until World War I; the Wrexham-Rhos passenger service ceased in 1930. The public timetable for 1910 shows 11 trains from Wynn Hall Halt to Wrexham, with two additional trains on Saturdays. Two more trains started from Rhos. There were 11 from Ponkey. Most of the trains are shown from both Wynn Hall Halt and Ponkey; the timetable of the period does not show whether a service runs through, and it is likely that one or other of the arms of the service required a change at Rhos.Bradshaw's April 1910 Railway Guide, David and Charles, Newton Abbot, 1968, Service reductions and closure Retrenchment in World War I resulted in the railmotor halts closing, on 22 March 1915, as well as severance of the Ponkey to Legacy connection, on 18 January 1917.MacDonald, volume II, page 613 The Ruabon end of the Ponkey branch continued, serving private sidings: there were two brickworks, a petroleum company siding, and those of a furniture factory and the Rhos Gas Company. Later a short siding was laid at the Legacy end to provide access from the Rhos branch to a sub-station of the North Wales Power Company. Wrexham to Rhos passenger trains continued running until 30 December 1930. The line between Pontcysyllte and Pant closed in 1953, a mineral service then operating from the north end; this was closed throughout on 14 October 1963. The Ponkey line north of the Bryn-yr-Owen colliery connection at Aberderfyn closed in 1917; the line, then fed from the south end, was cut back to Ruabon Brick Works in 1954, and completely closed in 1964.

It was established in October 2017, as a successor to the former Public Policy Institute for Wales (PPIW). The Centre builds on the work of the PPIW, combining it with a broader approach which involves working with public services and as part of the UK-wide What Works network. The Centre is based at Cardiff University and is co-funded by the Economic and Social Research Council and the Welsh Government.  Function  Through close collaboration with leading policy experts the WCPP aims to provide Welsh Government Ministers, the civil service, and public services with high quality evidence and independent advice to enable them to improve policy decisions and outcomes for Wales. The WCPP helps policymakers and academic experts come together to make best use of the research base. The WCPP meets regularly with all ministers to discuss their evidence needs, conducts reviews of the existing evidence, and identifies experts who it can work with to provide support to ministers and officials. Working with experts, the WCPP then produce reports and ministerial briefings and facilitate roundtables, workshops and public events, where researchers and policymakers work together to identify solutions to policy problems. Using existing knowledge and expertise allows the WCPP to provide evidence more quickly than traditional academic studies involving new research. The studies are completed to short deadlines (three to six months, or less), meaning that results are available to Ministers when they are most useful.  Organisation  Professor Steve Martin is the Director of the WCPP. The WCPP is overseen by an independent Advisory Group, who steer the WCPP‚Äôs overall strategy and future development; advise on ways to ensure that its work makes a positive difference; and ensure that its work is rigorous, authoritative, and independent. The WCPP employs 20 full-time members of staff, and its administrative base is located as a part of Cardiff University, Wales.  Awards  In June 2018 the WCPP was awarded the Impact on Policy Award at Cardiff University‚Äôs Innovation and Impact Awards. In July 2019 the WCPP was named as a finalist in the ESRC‚Äôs Celebrating Impact Prize in recognition of the way in which it has enabled Ministers to use evidence to inform policy decisions.

Adam's wife, Lucy, is not happy about this but swallows her resentment and accepts their constant presence in their lives. Lucy comes from a wealthy Singaporean family, her Filipino mother was one of her father's wives. Her mother leaves and Lucy is raised by her Chinese Sinaporean father who hates and mistrusts Filipinos (including Chinese Filipinos). So when Lucy fell in love with Adam, her father disowns and curses her. Lucy never sees her family again. After Adam's indiscretion with Kai, Lucy saw it as the unravelling of her father's curse. Forced to accept her husband's mistress, the two families coexist under Adam's care. Because Adam is a prominent businessman, society accepts Kai as Adam's consort with a place in the social structure. Jia is an interior designer. Dana finished architecture in Singapore where she met and fell in love with David Chao. Dana becomes pregnant with David and the couple plans to marry. As part of a pre-wedding ritual, the families have the couple's fortune read. The seer warns them of the curse and urges them to stop the wedding. Despite Lucy's apprehensions, Adam does not believe in the curse and the wedding follows.

Medical experts from different countries step in with modern treatments but nobody can induce Dana out of her comatose state. The Wongs and the Chaos watch over Dana for over a year. Lucy believes that the curse is at work.

As she recovers, she is curious about what happened during the 18 months she was asleep. No one can give her a straight answer on why Jia and Kai left. Not believing that her father banished Jia for venturing out on her own, Dana becomes suspicious of David having an affair and that Jia's disappearance is related to David's emotional distance. While David tries to make up for his indiscretion by sticking to their marriage, Dana's obsession to get the truth drives her to maltreat David. He considers filing for an annulment. Adam and Lucy are happy about this because they have not forgiven David for his betrayal of Dana. Amidst the turmoil in their marriage, it is revealed that Jia's son did not die. Kai's brother Harry kidnapped the baby and was given to Lucy in exchange for money for Jia's cancer treatment. Unbeknownst to everyone except Lucy, the infant is left at the gate of the Wong's residence and adopted by David and Dana.

After advising Adam of their unsuccessful proposal, Adam makes some inquiries of his own and discovers Jia is the owner. He flies to Singapore and they have a happy reunion.

It is in the and part of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra, where it is the cathedral church of the monastery complex. The cathedral is the centre-piece of the ensemble of buildings that comprises the monastery complex. Work began on the cathedral in 1719, but as it was nearing completion severe cracks were discovered in the structure that threatened its stability, and the work was ordered to be demolished in 1744. A competition design early in the reign of Empress Catherine the Great failed to produce a suitable alternative, and it was not until 1774 that a design by Ivan Starov was selected. Construction began in 1778 and the cathedral was finally completed and consecrated in 1790. On the day of the consecration the relics of St Alexander Nevsky were ceremonially transferred to the cathedral in a grand ceremony. The cathedral remained largely unchanged for much of its existence, its importance highlighted by the rich and valuable furnishings that were donated by the Imperial family. It continued to operate after the Russian Revolution, though it suffered the loss of most of its historic artefacts during the general confiscation of Russian Orthodox Church property after 1922. After a period where it was run by the Renovationist movement, the cathedral was finally closed in 1933 and used as office space and as a warehouse. The cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church in 1955 and was re-consecrated in 1957. The relics of St Alexander Nevsky were returned to the cathedral in 1989, and the cathedral has resumed its role as the principal church of the monastery. Construction The first mention of the monastery complex is July 1710, when Peter the Great ordered the construction of a monastery to Saint Alexander Nevsky on a plot of land close to the present , believing this to be the site of Alexander Nevsky's 1240 victory over the Swedes at the Battle of the Neva. The first buildings on the site were wooden constructions, with the first church, the Church of the Annunciation, consecrated on 25 March 1713, the date used as the official foundation date of the monastery. The general plans for the monastery complex had been drawn up by Domenico Trezzini, and construction began on the cathedral in 1719, to a design by architect . The dome was installed by 17 June 1722 and work was nearing completion in 1731, when severe cracking was found on the supporting masonry. Work was stopped, and in 1744 orders were given to raze the building, Ivan Rossi overseeing its demolition down to its foundations between 1753 and 1755. Interest in completing the monastery complex waned, until Empress Catherine the Great acceded to the throne in 1762. In 1763 a competition to select the design of the cathedral was held, but none of the entrants was chosen. Finally eleven years later, in 1774, a design by Ivan Starov was selected, a single-domed cathedral in the neoclassic style. Aerial view of the Alexander Nevsky Lavra. The Holy Trinity Cathedral at centre dominates the monastic complex. Empress Catherine approved the project in February 1776 and the groundwork was laid on 30 August 1778 by the Metropolitan Gabriel, in the presence of the Empress. The first bell tower was completed in 1782 and the main structure was finished by 1786. An 800-pood bell cast in 1658 was brought from the Valday Iversky Monastery and hung in the second tower. The cathedral was consecrated by Metropolitan Gabriel on 30 August 1790, the feast day of St Alexander Nevsky, in a ceremony attended by Empress Catherine. The relics of Alexander Nevsky were brought from the Annunciation Church to the cathedral to the accompaniment of cannon salutes. Empress Catherine celebrated the consecration by donating expensive utensils and Flemish tapestries to the cathedral. The Alexander Nevsky chapel under the south tower was consecrated on 9 October 1790, though it was later removed in 1838. In 1791 part of the Feodorovsky building nearest to the cathedral was converted into a hall for the Knights of the Order of St. Alexander Nevsky. In 1797 a relief was placed over the cathedral entrance. Design and interior  Cathedral interior, showing the arched vaulting of the naves and the dome As completed the cathedral is surmounted by a single dome on a high drum, with two double- tiered bell towers on either side of the loggia of the central entrance. The main entrance consists of a portico of six Doric columns, with the facades consisting of shallow panels and pilasters. The north and south entrances are surmounted by bas-relief panels sculpted by Fedot Shubin, depicting events from the Old and New Testaments. The cathedral occupies a cruciform floor plan, with three naves. The main nave is supported by Corinthian columns, while the drum of the dome contains 16 windows. The iconostasis is made of marble, with images by and Ivan Akimov and bronze detailing by . The cathedral interior was richly decorated with paintings, bas-reliefs and statues. Sculptor Fedot Shubin produced twenty bas-reliefs and statues of saints, while the altarpiece was by Anton Raphael Mengs. The original paintings were by Fyodor Danilov, though in 1806 Antonio della Giacomo replaced them using the sketches of Giacomo Quarenghi. The sculpting was entrusted to F. Lamoni and Giovanni Maria Fontana. A portrait of Catherine II by Dmitry Levitzky hung above the royal pew; on the opposite side hung a portrait of Peter the Great. In 1794 Catherine II donated several valuable paintings by Anthony van Dyck, Jacopo Bassano, Guercino, Bernardo Strozzi and others from the Hermitage. She also later presented the church with a massive silver chandelier weighing about 13 pounds. Various relics and ornamental artefacts were collected in the cathedral, including the silver tomb of Alexander Nevsky, a piece of the Lord‚Äôs Robe, and the image of the Theotokos of Vladimir. The cathedral underwent several restorations during its existence, though its interiors remained largely as they were originally. The arches were repainted in 1862 by P. S. Titov, according to the sketches of Academician Fedor Solntsev. In 1847 a heating system was installed to allow the cathedral to operate in the winter. In 1862, a malachite canopy made in 1827‚Äì1828 in the Paris workshop of Pierre-Philippe Thomire was transferred to the cathedral from the Tauride Palace. Fifteen years later, a massive silver tomb was made under the shroud. In 1904, the main altar was lined with silver reliefs. Soviet period The silver sarcophagus of St Alexander Nevsky, removed from the cathedral in 1922 After the revolution, many of the valuables were removed from the cathedral and placed in museums, part of the state's general confiscation of Russian Orthodox Church property. The courtyard between the cathedral and the Metropolitan's house became a burial ground in 1917 called the Kazachye Cemetery, later the \\"Communist Square\\". The cathedral was operated between 1926 and 1933 by the Renovationist movement of the Orthodox Church, before a decision by the Leningrad Executive Committee on 16 August 1933 to close the cathedral. The last service was held on 7 December 1933, after which it passed to the on 20 December that year. In the 1940s, part of the building was occupied by the first district housing authority of the Smolninsky District and the , and the rest was used as a warehouse. In 1955 the Holy Trinity Cathedral was returned to the Orthodox Church. It had sustained damage during the siege of Leningrad, and after repairs it was re-consecrated on 12 September 1957 by Metropolitan . Further restoration works were carried out between 1957 and 1960, and 1986 and 1988.

The stories pursue the themes of relationships, family and love, with the humor and wit that is typical of Weldon's style. The book won the PEN/Macmillan Silver Pen Award in 1996.  Stories  Weldon populates her stories with people suffering from detachment, unequal power relations, and social irreverence. Considered a strong feminist writer, Weldon usually focuses on women navigating the dangers and difficulties of marriage and domesticity, as she does in Wicked Women as well, but in this book she find everyone wicked: Men, women, children, therapists, and even supernatural beings. The stories are divided by subject, as follows: * Tales of Wicked Women ** End of the Line ** Run and Ask Daddy If He Has Any More Money ** In the Great War (II) ** Not Even a Blood Relation * Tales of Wicked Men ** Wasted Lives ** Love Amongst the Artists ** Leda and the Swan * 'Tales of Wicked Children ** Tale of Timothy Bagshott ** Valediction * From the Other Side ** Through a Dustbin, Darkly ** A Good Sound Marriage ** Web Central * Of Love, Pain and Good Cheer ** Pains ** A Question of Timing ** Red on Black ** Knock-Knock * Going to the Therapist ** Santa Claus' New Clothes ** Baked Alaska ** The Pardoner ** Heat Haze  Reception  The collection was well- received by critics. According to the Publishers Weekly review, \\"These 20 saucy tales prove that the worst varieties of human pretension and evil are often the most entertaining, especially in the hands of an expert vivisectionist like Weldon.\\" The Kirkus review stated that, \\"Both sexes and all ages come in for some merry tweaking by this master of sexual satire-- making this outing a familiar pleasure for old fans and a thoroughly satisfying introduction for newcomers.\\" New York Times reviewer Deborah Mason writes, \\"Weldon's wrap-ups are eloquent and absolute. They are born of her belief in the dogged persistence of genetic bonds and in an uncompromising universe of clear rights and wrongs with their own inevitable consequences.

Bloomsbury The first occupation was at 5 Bloomsbury Square in central London, close to University College London and Birkbeck College. Speakers included Paul Mason. Fitzrovia The second occupation was at 34‚Äì35 Fitzroy Square, two adjoining townhouses owned by film-maker Guy Ritchie which had previously been a language school. When Ritchie sued for possession, the group attended the court wearing Vinnie Jones masks (since Jones has appeared in several of Ritchie's films, including Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels). District Judge Marc Dight was unimpressed by the squatters' defence, which was presented by a law student. He ordered the squatters to leave by the evening, so they organised a peaceful leaving party which spilled over into Fitzroy Square. Later occupations The group then occupied two pubs, firstly The Black Horse at 6 Rathbone Place and then The Hand & Racquet at 48 Whitcomb Street. The Black Horse was in Fitzrovia and received support from the Fitzrovia Neighbourhood Association when bailiffs attempted an illegal eviction. The Hand and Racquet was in central London, next to Leicester Square and behind the National Gallery.

Criticisms The owner of the Bloomsbury Square property, Peter Nahum, said that the squatters were \\"essentially nice, middle-class kids, who would go and wash at friends' flats nearby.\\" He complained that it cost a lot of money to evict them and asked \\"Why have a free school in central London?

Born in Lambeth, Kelly worked on the railways and became prominent in the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR). In his youth, he was a keen footballer, and captained the Northern United team when it won the Railway Challenge Cup three years in a row. He was a supporter of the Labour Party and was elected to Poplar Borough Council in 1919, representing Bromley North East, holding the seat until 1928. Also in 1919, he was elected to the Metropolitan Water Board, while he served on the Poplar Board of Guardians for six years. He was a supporter of the Poplar Rates Rebellion in 1921, but unlike many of the local councillors, he was not imprisoned. At the 1922 London County Council election, Kelly was elected in Whitechapel and St George's. He later claimed that, after the declaration, he had only 2d remaining, just sufficient to pay his tram fare home. He stood for Bethnal Green North East at the 1929 United Kingdom general election, and took second place, with 38.7% of the vote. At the 1935 United Kingdom general election, he stood in Norwich, but took only fourth place, with 17.8% of the vote. After his defeat in Norwich, Kelly's political expenses were no longer covered by the NUR and Labour Party, but Kelly continued to speak on behalf of the party. This led him into financial difficulties, and in October 1936 he stole jewellery from luggage he was transporting across London. The passenger owning the luggage lived in Edinburgh and reported the theft to police there. When Kelly attended a Labour Party conference in Edinburgh later in the month, he attempted to sell some of the jewellery; this was identified by local police, and he was arrested. In court, he admitted to similar offences committed over a three-month period, and he was sentenced to three months in prison.

Reception Devasheesh Pandey of News18 praised the cinematography, art direction, sound design as well as the acting performances of the show and gave it a rating of 3.5 out of 5 saying that, \\"Kota Factory maintains an edge over other shows in the genre, courtesy of its on-point, deadpan humour and a relatably bittersweet aftertaste of existential battle that the protagonist is facing.\\" Ishita Sengupta of The Indian Express found the show to be engaging and applauded it saying that, \\"The ingenuity of Kota Factory lies in its ability to deal with different narrative strands and coalesce them effortlessly.\\" Ishita also felt that the performances of the actors, specially Mayur More and Ranjan Raj, add a lot of value to the show. Rahul Desai of Film Companion was impressed with the mature depiction of the subject at hand and praised the acting performances as well as the writing of the show saying that, \\"Kota Factory‚Äôs biggest asset is its writing which somehow maintains a semi-dramatic progression without compromising on the factual tone of the series.\\" Gautam Batra of Koimoi praised the direction and the acting performances of the show and gave it a rating of 4 out of 5 saying that, \\"the web series has taken a very less dramatic route to narrate the story which makes it extremely relatable watch.\\" Priyanka Bansal of The Quint praised the show for presenting a fresh perspective on the education system in India. Impressed with the acting performances, production quality and music of Kota Factory, Priyanka gave the show a rating of 3.5 out of 5 and said that, \\"If you are looking for something worthwhile, The Kota Factory can be a nice watch that will make you think not about death and gloom but leave you with optimism.\\" Tanul Thakur of The Wire praised the show for being realistic and relatable but felt that the show shies away from criticising the culture of coaching institutes prevalent in the Indian society. Dilip D'Souza writing for The Caravan praised the storytelling, as well.

Its positions are close to the Identitarian movement, although it precedes that movement and its terminology.  History  = Background = Pierre Vial at a Terre et Peuple event in 2012 Pierre Vial (born 1942) is an academic medievalist tied to the Jean Moulin University Lyon 3. He had been involved in far-right political activism since the 1960s: Vial co-founded the Nouvelle Droite organization Groupement de recherche et d'√©tudes pour la civilisation europ√©enne (GRECE) in 1968, and served as the secretary general from 1978 to 1984. He represents a neopagan outlook in the vein of Marc \\"Saint-Loup\\" Augier. In 1988 Vial became a member of the Front National (FN) where he joined the leadership ranks. = Creation = Vial had been complaining about the lack of focus on the ethnic dimension of identity in both GRECE and the FN, and eventually decided to establish his own movement. Helped by former GRECE members Pierre Vial and Jean Mabire, he founded the cultural association Terre et Peuple (T&P;) in 1994 and launched it publicly in 1995. According to the political scientists Jean-Yves Camus and Nicolas Lebourg, T&P; could originally be understood as an externalization of the racialist faction of GRECE, which thereby could make more extravagant claims about ethnic civil war in Europe. Unlike Alain de Benoist and Charles Champetier of GRECE, T&P; have been receptive to Guillaume Faye's adaptation of the Clash of Civilizations hypothesis and its focus on physical conflict. Camus and Lebourg also tie the roots of T&P; to the neopagan tendency within the FN, and trace this tendency to the days of the FN co-founder Fran√ßois Duprat (1940‚Äì1978). Although he was an atheist with no sympathy for pagan revivalism, Duprat had clashed with the party's Traditionalist Catholic faction due to his conception of the nation, which was understood by the Catholics to be pagan. When Vial joined the FN, he became responsible for organizing the faction of the party that held views similar to those of Duprat. = Recent developments = The ties between T&P; and the FN were weakened in 1998 when Vial's faction sided with Bruno M√©gret and his failed attempt to take over the party. After this T&P; became linked with M√©gret's new party, the National Republican Movement. This connection was in turn broken after the September 11 attacks in 2001, when M√©gret began to portray himself as a defender of the Jews against Muslims. T&P; have since established international branches in Belgium, Spain (Tierra y Pueblo), Portugal (Terra et Povo) and Italy (Terra Insubre). Since 2013 it has participated in the Switzerland-based network Action Europ√©enne, labeled by Camus and Lebourg as a neo-Nazi network.  Activity and membership  Terre et Peuple activists in Paris T&P; organize annual roundtables, participate at conferences and publish an eponymous quarterly magazine, subtitled r√©sistance identitaire europ√©enne (European identitarian resistance). Vial announced in an editorial that the group's core principle is the \\"Identitarian cultural combat\\". To him, the cohabitation of two communities in one area could only lead to violence. \\"Ethnic conflicts, which have existed, will always exist\\", he said, the Identitarian goal then becomes to culturally arm the people \\"for the resistance, and then for the war of liberation which will allow it to survive and take command of its destiny.\\" He has associated his group with the historical German v√∂lkisch movement, writing in the magazine that \\"the German word v√∂lkisch describes perfectly the doctrine of Terre et Peuple\\". Vial rejects the term \\"neopaganism\\", as he does not perceive T&P;'s religious practices as new. This has been disputed by St√©phane Fran√ßois, a historian of ideas, who views the paganism of the organization as \\"a reinvention of a religion that never existed in this way\\". Fran√ßois describes T&P;'s paganism as something that has grown out of intellectual considerations rather than an immediate religiosity. It belongs to a current that began in the 20th century, which approaches paganism on a nationalist or regionalist basis. Fran√ßois does however set T&P; apart from neo-Nazis and other far-right neopagan currents that can be prone to violence. In 2014, Le Monde des Religions reported that the organization had more than 700 members.

Barbara Ruthven was a daughter of William Ruthven, 1st Earl of Gowrie and Dorothea Stewart, the oldest daughter of Henry Stewart, 1st Lord Methven and Janet Stewart, daughter of John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl. She was a maid of honour to Anne of Denmark with her sister Beatrix.James Balfour Paul, Scots Peerage, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 266-7. Beatrix had a prominent role at the christening of Princess Elizabeth in November 1596, for which the queen bought her a gown of figured black velvet with white sleeves and a yellow damask skirt. Christene Ruthven, another gentlewoman listed in the queen's household may have been another sister.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 146-7. James Hudson noted Barbara having a secret conversation with the Scottish ambassador Robert Crichton, 8th Lord Crichton of Sanquhar in May 1597.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 526. The Earl of Gowrie and one of his brothers were killed in a struggle with James VI of Scotland on 5 August 1600 at Gowrie House in Perth. After this, his sisters were protected by Anne of Denmark even though James wished them to be excluded from his presence, and had ordered them to be 'thrust out' of Falkland Palace. On 1 November 1600 Dorothea Stewart, who was staying at Dirleton Castle, hoped that the king could be persuaded to support her daughters, \\"quhais estait is verie desolait\\" and she could not help them herself.HMC 9th Report and Appendix: Elphinstone (London, 1884), p. 196. Two younger brothers went to Berwick-upon-Tweed and lived in hiding for a month, until the Marshall of the town Sir John Carey helped them travel to Durham and Cambridge.Border Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 684. Sir Robert Cecil, who was in the confidence of Anne of Denmark, helped Barbara travel to London. Sir Robert Cecil understood that Anne of Denmark and Queen Elizabeth were agreed that Barbara should come to London in August 1602. In September Roger Aston told James VI that Beatrix Ruthven was in England.Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 1033, 1049. However, an agent of Elizabeth told James that she would not have any dealings with the Gowrie sisters.John Bruce, Letters of Queen Elizabeth and James (London, 1849), pp. 146-7. Cecil wrote a letter, probably to the Master of Gray, explaining the delicate and flammable situation of Elizabeth receiving letters asking for the relief of 'that house which is touched with the infamy of attempting the king's blood'.HMC Salisbury Hatfield vol. 14 (London, 1923), pp. 247-9. Barbara was in London when on 25 December 1602 her sister Beatrix Ruthven was smuggled into the apartments of Anne of Denmark posing as a gentlewoman servant to Lady Paisley or Lady Angus, at the queen's request.Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 1092, 1096. There was a rumour in February 1603 that Barbara Ruthven had returned to Scotland by boat.Calendar State Papers Scotland, 13:2 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 1107. Roger Aston discussed with Anne of Denmark how her support for the Gowrie brothers and sisters and a suspected plot against King James may have dented her reputation in England. Early in 1603 Barbara came to London again from Cambridge (where her brothers were) and had new clothes made for her. James Hudson wrote to Sir Robert Cecil saying there were rumours she came to join Elizabeth's household or seek favours for her brothers.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 part 2 (Edinburgh, 1969), pp. 1110, 1126-7. Ruthven's appearance seemed striking and her speech foreign to the lawyer John Manningham who wrote, 'I sawe this afternoone a Scottishe Lady at Mr. Fleetes in Loathebury; shee was sister to Earl Gowre, a gallant tall gentlewoman, somewhat long visage, a lisping fumbling language. Peter Saltingstone came to visit hir' and 'was with the Lady Barbara, Shee saith the King will not swear, but he will curse and ban at hunting, and wish the divel goe with them all'.John Bruce, Diary of John Manningham (London, 1868), p. 156, 168. 'Saltingstone' is probably Peter Saltonstall of the Middle Temple who visited Scotland with Benjamin Rudyerd in October 1601, and perhaps a son of Richard Saltonstall, Lord Mayor of London. In May 1603 Cecil organised an exchequer payment to his steward Roger Houghton for ¬£300 spent on Barbara Ruthven's relief, and she was later given a yearly pension of ¬£200.Frederick Devon, Issues of the Exchequer during the Reign of James I (London, 1836), pp. 5, 36. She wrote to the Privy Council on 19 June accepting the king's wish that she should leave London, and that she would live at Mr Scott's house in the country, where she had previously lodged.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (London, 1930), p. 139. Later in 1603 Sir William Ingleby (1546‚Äì1618) of Ripley Castle captured one of the fugitive brothers of the Earl of Gowrie at Kirkby Malzeard. He was recognised at an inn kept by Christopher Mawlam, by Francis Wandesford, who had seen him before at Durham. At first he pretended to be from \\"Wutton\\" in County Durham, but his lack of local knowledge revealed him. Next day Ingleby received him as a prisoner. He had with him a satchel stuffed with books and some apothecary confections, according to Wandesford's letter to Robert Cecil.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 15 (London, 1930), pp. 376-7. In Scotland early in 1604, the Earl of Mar heard an unlikely rumour that Cecil would marry Barbara Ruthven.HMC Salisbury Hatfield (London, 1933), pp. 29-30. She was granted a royal pension of ¬£200 yearly.HMC Salisbury Hatfield, vol. 20 (London, 1968), p. 305.

Barbara was buried at Greenwich on 29 December 1625.Daniel Lysons, The Environs of London: Counties of Herts, Essex & Kent, vol. 4 (London, 1796), p. 474. Beatrix married Sir James Home of Coldenknowes and died in Scotland.Letters and Papers of the Reign of James VI (Edinburgh, 1838), pp. 349-50.

She is best known for her English translations of medieval Hebrew poetry, especially of the poems of Judah Halevi. Early life Paulina Ruth Davis was born on 15 July 1877 at Friarfield House, Derby, the second of two children of Louisa () and Arthur Davis. Her father's family were secular Jewish precision instrument makers, who had immigrated to England from Bavaria in the early nineteenth century. A civil engineer by trade, Arthur Davis became religiously observant and mastered the Hebrew language, becoming an accomplished Hebraist noted for his study of cantillation marks in the Tanakh. The family moved to Kilburn, London when Nina was six weeks old, later settling in Bayswater. There, Davis gave his daughters an intensive scholarly education in Hebrew and Jewish studies, teaching them himself each morning before breakfast from the age of four, and taking them regularly to the synagogue. The Davises moved in learned Jewish circles, and friends of Nina's parents included the families of Nathan Adler, Simeon Singer, Claude Montefiore, Solomon Schechter, Herbert Bentwich, and Elkan Adler. Arthur Davis was one of the \\"Kilburn Wanderers\\"‚Äîa group of Anglo- Jewish intellectuals that formed around Solomon Schechter in the 1880s‚Äîmembers of which took an interest in Nina's work and helped her find publication for her writings. Career =Early career= Nina's first published translation, of Abraham ibn Ezra's The Song of Chess, appeared in the Jewish Chronicle on 22 June 1894. Later that year, she contributed an essay and a poem on \\"The Ideal Minister of the Talmud\\" to the Jewish Quarterly Review, then under the editorship of Claude Montefiore and Israel Abrahams, and continued thereafter publishing translations of medieval Hebrew poetry in the Jewish press. Israel Zangwill, an acquaintance of her father, provided her with an introduction to Mayer Sulzberger of the Jewish Publication Society of America, which published her Songs of Exile by Hebrew Poets in 1901. The collection, which attracted widespread attention, included translations of poems by Judah Halevi, Abraham ibn Ezra, Eleazar ben Killir, Solomon ibn Gabirol, Joseph ben Samuel Bonfils, and Meir of Rothenburg, as well as passages from the Talmud and Midrash Rabba. From about 1900, her father worked with Herbert M. Adler, nephew of Chief Rabbi Hermann Adler, on a multivolume edition of the Machzor with a new and modern translation. Nina and her sister, Elsie, both contributed to the work, devoting themselves to translating the metrical sections of the original into poetry, while their father rendered the prose. The festival prayer book was published as Service of the Synagogue in 1904‚Äì9, and is still in use in synagogues across Great Britain, Canada, and Australia. =Marriage and family= Nina met physician Redcliffe Salaman during Shabbat services at the New West End Synagogue in July 1901. Redcliffe was one of the twelve children of Myer Salaman, a wealthy London ostrich feather merchant whose family had migrated to Britain from either Holland or the Rhineland in the early eighteenth century. They were formally engaged ten days later and married on 23 October 1901, after which Redcliffe temporarily relocated to Berlin to complete advanced training in pathology. He was appointed director of the Pathological Institute at the London Hospital in 1902, but ceased to practice medicine the following year after developing pulmonary tuberculosis. The Salamans spent the winter of 1903‚Äì1904 in Montana- sur-Sierre and Montreux, Switzerland, where Redcliffe slowly regained some weight. Upon their return to England, they moved to a thirty-room Elizabethan country house, Homestall, in Barley, Hertfordshire, a small village near Cambridge. Nina and Redcliffe Salaman lived comfortably in a kosher and Shabbat-observant home with numerous servants, and returned to London frequently to observe Jewish festivals and attend committee meetings. Nina and Redcliffe Salaman became active in the Jewish community at Cambridge, and entertained generations of Jewish students at their home. Nina travelled frequently to the town to use the university library and meet with Israel Abrahams, reader in Talmudic and rabbinic literature. Like her father before her, she personally educated her six children at their Hertfordshire home until they went to boarding school (at Clifton College and Bedales School), teaching them to read Hebrew before they learned to read English. =Later career= Solomon J. Solomon (1918) Salaman continued after her marriage to write in the columns of Jewish periodicals, principally the Jewish Chronicle, the Jewish Quarterly Review, the Menorah Journal, and the Jewish Guardian. A passionate Jewish nationalist, Salaman published in 1916 one of the first English translations of Hatikvah, and later composed the marching song for the Judaeans, the Jewish regiment that participated in the British effort to seize Palestine from the Ottoman Empire during the First World War, in which her husband served as medical officer. A book of original poetry appeared in 1920 to favourable reviews, entitled The Voices of the Rivers, which includes a hymn for the 9th of Av. The following year she released as a gift book for Jewish children Apples and Honey, a collection of poetry and prose by Benjamin Disraeli, Emma Lazarus, George Eliot, Israel Zangwill, Jessie Sampter, Leigh Hunt, Lord Byron, and others. Salaman's most important work was her Selected Poems of Jehudah Halevi, the second of a series of twenty-five volumes of Jewish Classics issued by the Jewish Publication Society. Released in 1924 after twelve years of preparation, the volume is divided into four sections (The Journey to Zion, Love and Bridal Songs, Poems of Friendship, and Devotional Poems) and contains an introduction by Salaman on the life of Halevi and his work. The translation was based on the Hebrew text from Chaim Brody's edition of Halevi, revised for him for the collection. =Activism and community work= Besides her scholarly work, Salaman served as vice-president of the Jewish League for Woman Suffrage, in which position she advocated for the right of women to vote in synagogue elections and for Hebrew education for Jewish girls, was an active member of the Federation of Women Zionists and the Union of Jewish Women, and helped establish the Tottenham Talmud Torah for Girls in North London, to which she donated the royalties of her books. She also participated in various non-Jewish charities, such as the Women's Institute at Barley. At Friday evening services on 5 December 1919, she became the first woman to deliver a sermon in a British Orthodox synagogue, when she spoke on the weekly parashah, Vayishlach, to the Cambridge Hebrew Congregation. The event was met with controversy; Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz supported Salaman, and ruled that since she only went up to the bimah after the concluding prayer, no religious law had been violated. Salaman was appointed to the council of the Jewish Historical Society of England in 1918, and was elected president in 1922. Her ailing health prevented her from taking office, however, and her husband was elected in her stead. Death and legacy Nina Salaman died of colorectal cancer on 22 February 1925, at the age of 47. The funeral was held three days later at the Willesden Jewish Cemetery, where the Chief Rabbi officiated and delivered a eulogy, customarily forbidden on Rosh Hodesh except at the funeral of an eminent scholar. An American memorial service was held by Ray Frank-Litman on 28 April, at which Moses Jung, Jacob Zeitlin and Abram L. Sachar made eulogistic remarks. Abraham Yahuda, Herbert M. Adler, Herbert Loewe, Sir Israel Gollancz, Israel Zangwill, Norman Bentwich, and others published tributes in her memory. Salaman's children were Myer Head Salaman (1902‚Äì1994), pathologist and cancer researcher; Arthur Gabriel Salaman (1904‚Äì1964), general practitioner; Raphael Arthur Salaman (1906‚Äì1993), engineer; Ruth Isabelle Collet (1909‚Äì2001), painter and printmaker; and Esther Sarah Salaman (1914‚Äì2005), mezzo-soprano. (A sixth child, Edward, the twin brother of Arthur, died in 1913 at the age of 9.) Salaman's granddaughter, Jenny Manson, is Chair of Jewish Voice for Labour. A portrait of Nina Salaman by Solomon J.

International Defense Consultancy is a private Turkish security contractor headquartered in Istanbul, Turkey. It is the country's first domestic military consultancy firm, founded in 2012 by former Turkish Armed Forces (TSK) brigadier general, Adnan Tanriverdi. The company operates within the Middle East and provides services such as military and interior training, defense consultancy, and ordnance procurement. SADAT's mission and purpose remains shrouded in controversy, facing allegations from anti-Justice and Development Party (AKP) sources. These allegations range from supporting establishing a private army loyal to President Tayyip Recep Erdogan. Company Profile Adnan Tanriverdi, along with 23 TSK officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs), created SADAT Inc. on February 28, 2012. The organization maintained a Board of Directors including Adnan and four other members. His son, Mehli Tanriverdi, is the current Chairman of the Board. The company employees between 50 to 200 former TSK officers from various branches and specializations. Its list of services include: *Consultancy *Training **Conventional Military Training **Unconventional Military Training **Special Forces Training *Ordnance The company's stated mission is \\"establishing the connection among the Islamic countries in the sense of defense and military industries, in order to assist the Islamic world to take the rank it deserves among super world powers as a self-sufficient military power, by submitting them the services regarding the organization of armed forces, defense consultancy, military training, and ordnance.\\" SADAT Inc. has a sister organization, ASSAM, with a more political focus that was also headed by Adnan Tanriverdi until January 2020. It runs a strategic studies center and hosts annual conventions. Controversies =Connection to President Erdogan and AKP= Following the attempted coup of July 15, 2016, President Erdogan appointed Adnan Tanriverdi to his cabinet as chief military counselor. The close relationship between Tanriverdi and Erdogan, who were relieved from political and military offices in the late 1990s for their Islamic convictions, has sparked allegations of corrupt behavior. These accusations including the belief that SADAT represents and exists as Erdogan's \\"private militia.\\" =Involvement in coup attempt= According to American Enterprise Institute's (AEI) Michael Rubin, SADAT personnel were active and participated in anti-coup efforts on the night of July 15, 2016. Rubin and others reference social media posts and videos captured by Turkish citizens, which supposedly show SADAT personnel attacking putschists on the Bosphorus Bridge in Istanbul, Turkey. =Training Islamist jihadists= Some Western and Israeli media outlets claim SADAT is connected to nefarious terrorist organizations such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and ISIS. These sources state that SADAT is actively training Islamist elements who adhere to a Salafist ideology in Syria and other locations in the Middle East. These locations include Somalia and Qatar, where Turkey has established military training centers and formed cooperative partnerships with the host countries' governments. Additionally, a QatariLeaks video identifies the Sudanese port city of Suakin as another potential site of SADAT involvement.

She is a professor of hydrology and researcher at the Institute of Physical Geography, Goethe University Frankfurt.  Early life and education  Petra D√∂ll was born and raised in Hof, later moving to Erlangen for university. She applied for a Fulbright exchange program between the University of Erlangen‚ÄìNuremberg and the University of Colorado Boulder (USA) for her fourth year. There, D√∂ll connected her background in geology to groundwater and hydrology. D√∂ll earned a Masters of Science from University of Colorado Boulder. D√∂ll was interested in sustainability and found that her new studies in hydrology gave her the ability to think about geology and water with a social-ecological perspective. After earning her first diploma in geology from University of Erlangen‚ÄìNuremberg and her Masters of Science in geology in Colorado, she continued her work at the Technical University of Berlin, modeling moisture movement under the influence of temperature gradients as it pertains to the desiccation of mineral liners beneath landfills to earn her PhD. Several years later, D√∂ll began her research on global and regional modeling of water availability and use at the University of Kassel. D√∂ll earned her habilitation degree from the University of Kassel in Environmental Systems Analysis.  Career and research  D√∂ll is currently a professor of hydrology and researcher at the Institute of Physical Geography, Goethe University Frankfurt. She has authored or coauthored 93 peer-reviewed articles and has been cited at least 8,574 times, putting her in the top 1% of most highly cited researchers of 2018 as of May 2019 according to Clarivate Analytics. She has two research focuses: global hydrological modeling and smaller scale research on transdisciplinary and participatory research methods. = Global hydrological modeling = D√∂ll is recognized for her work on the global freshwater model, WaterGAP. This model focuses on quantifying human impacts on the global freshwater system, including impacts of climate change, human water use and man-made reservoirs, and assessing water stress. D√∂ll and her team have collaborated with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN to compile global data sets relevant for hydrology pertaining to drainage directions, lakes and wetlands, irrigated areas, and irrigated and rainfed crops. D√∂ll models impacts that climate change and human activity may have on the availability of the world's freshwater supply in the near and far future. = Transdisciplinary and participatory research methods = In support of the sustainable management of social-ecological systems, mainly water management, D√∂ll spearheads the research and implementation of transdisciplinary and participatory research methods. She believes that sustainable solutions to complex problems can only be achieved by equitable stakeholder participation, and that suitable methods for integrating stakeholder knowledge and values need to be developed.  Other contributions  Since 2001, D√∂ll has contributed to reports for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change both as a lead author and contributing author on chapters about freshwater resources and their management. D√∂ll was a contributing author to the freshwater resources chapter of the Third Assessment Report: Climate Change 2001. She was the lead author of freshwater resources chapter of the Fourth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2007. In 2008 she was lead author of the IPCC's Technical Paper on Climate and Water. Additionally, D√∂ll was the lead author of another chapter about the water cycle as well as the Summary for Policymakers for the Fifth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2014. She was later a contributing author of a chapter on the water cycle in the Sixth Assessment Report: Climate Change 2021. Aside from her work with the IPCC, D√∂ll has been a member of the Senate Commission \\"Earth System Research\\" of the German Research Foundation since 2016.  Awards and honors  In 2019, D√∂ll was awarded the Henry Darcy Medal of the European Geophysical Union for her work in global freshwater system modeling, raising awareness about threats to freshwater security, and advocating for and researching participatory water management. She has also received the following awards: * eLearning Award of Goethe University (2006) * Water International Best Paper 2004 Award (2005) * Fritz Scheffer Award of Deutsche Bodenkundliche Gesellschaft (for Ph.D. thesis) (1996)  Publications  D√∂ll has authored or coauthored 93 peer reviewed articles and has been cited at least 8,574 times putting her in the top 1% of most highly cited researchers of 2018.

The Secretary of Security and Civilian Protection, Hugo Guti√©rrez, assured that they had identified some of the participants in the attack, who began to be sought. Investigators believe the shootout was a result of a turf war between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and Los Zetas, two major criminal groups that operate in Veracruz. La Becky was paying protection to Los Zetas. Events At 9 pm, three men broke into a woman's 52-year birthday celebration in Minatitl√°n. Asking for \\"La Becky\\", they began shooting people at the party, among them a one-year-old infant. The sister of the woman whose birthday was celebrated said, \\"It was my sister's birthday, she was 52, I was coming from the bathroom when the thundering began, I did not see how many they were because I did not leave. I lost my son, my only son, and you can imagine the pain I have, to see my only son dead. I'm standing here, with my pain, because you can not say anything else, he was 32 years old.\\" A majority of the attendees were women, including seniors. The older adults dancing were pointed at with weapons. \\"Yes, they killed several old ladies\\", indicated a surviving woman. \\"I do not know how many they were, what I did was to throw myself under the table, they pointed me out, but I entrusted myself to God and said: Forgive me, Sir, and let your will be done. It seemed eternal to me, I thought it was not going to end. We were like 50, we were all ladies.\\" One of the victims was a one-year-old baby who was repeatedly shot after he fell to the ground. According to a survivor's testimony, ‚ÄúI said, 'it was one bullet', but it was a bullet spray because they were dead and they were still giving it to the baby. They kept shooting at him, they shot him in his little heart, how they could not realize if the mother was carrying him. The mother was also shot, I think the father wanted to cover him, but they hit him in the face.\\" The mother of the baby was hospitalized; so far she is the only member of that family that survived the attack. Besides killing more than a dozen people, the armed group psychologically tortured those who survived, forcing them to observe how they shot other people. One testimony said, \\"Those who were crouched were told to turn to see the dead, then they were shot again, to look at them, to look at them and they told you to turn around. I think they were looking for someone, they were pointing at your head or your back with long weapons.\\" Reactions Through social media, the governor of the region, Cuitl√°huac Garc√≠a Jim√©nez, informed that an emergency meeting was held due to the shooting. An operative was activated to find those responsible and at the same time it was assured that there would be no impunity, despite the criticisms to the State Attorney General's Office investigations of being \\"eternal\\". For its part, the Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection said they were supporting the state agencies, deploying an operation to search and capture those responsible. Several citizens criticized the attitude of Mexican President Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, accusing him of not responding in a timely manner for the shooting. After former presidential candidate Jos√© Antonio Meade called for the criminals to be punished and the families of the victims to be certain of an investigation, his comments generated diverse reactions after social media contrasted them with President L√≥pez Obrador, who was criticized for not commenting on the shooting during the hours after the event. After posting a tweet shortly after the shooting where he attacked his political opponents, several citizens began to organize protests demanding his resignation. As a result, the hashtag \\"#AMLORENUNCIA\\" (\\"AMLO resignation\\" or \\"Resign AMLO\\") became trending topic on Twitter. Former Mexican presidents Vicente Fox and Felipe Calder√≥n also criticized the President's attitude, with Calder√≥n blaming L√≥pez Obrador's \\"corrupt regime\\" for the insecurity that led to the shooting, and Fox responding to L√≥pez Obrador's tweet against his political opponents saying \\"What a shame that even tragedies are used by you as a springboard for aggression.

History of Duchess County, New York With Biographical Sketches of Some of Its Prominent Men and Pioneers ¬∑ Part 1, 1882, page 525 Nathaniel had worked with his uncle, Nathaniel Hazard, who was a merchant based out of New York from before he was 12 years old. When Sackett was 17 years old, he traveled to New York to work as an apprentice in his uncle's shop. Upon completion of his apprenticeship, Sackett set up the first general store in Fishkill, New York. Nathaniel Sackett married Mary Rogers on January 3, 1759. Together they had five children: Annias Rogers Sackett, Samuel Sackett, Nathaniel Sackett, Hannah Sackett, and Elizabeth Sackett.  Role in the American Revolution  After the Battles of Lexington and Concord in 1775, Nathaniel Sackett helped form what was known as the Rombout Precinct Committee of Safety in his home county of Duchess, New York. Sackett later served on the New York Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies. This Committee lead him to work with William Duer, a Continental Congressman who was helping George Washington set up a network of civilian spies in New York. Duer later recommended Sackett to George Washington as the man to set up the new network. Duer and Washington believed that Sackett's ability to organize and status as a civilian made him the perfect candidate to set up a spy network consisting of agents who were not enlisted in the military. Washington sent a letter to Sackett in February of 1777 requesting that he enlist other civilians to monitor the activities of the British in New York. Washington granted Sackett an allowance of $50 per month to recruit others to the cause. The operations of the spy network consisted of movements of soldiers across the Long Island and New York City area. However, their progress was insubstantial. Nathaniel Sackett failed to make any considerable progress with the spies in New York. Despite Sackett's ability to organize, he and his agents failed several times and failed to satisfy Washington‚Äôs demands of the fledgling spy ring. Sackett was relieved of his position and replaced with Benjamin Tallmadge. Building upon Sackett‚Äôs work, Tallmadge later created the Culper Spy Ring.  After the Revolutionary War  After the war Sackett sought a position in the new federal government from George Washington. Washington declined to acquiesce to his request. Sackett served one term in the state legislature and retired. He eventually returned home to his shop and farm and later died in Sullivan County, New York on July 28, 1805.  References in pop culture  Nathaniel Sackett, as well as the Culper Spy Ring and their activities during the Revolutionary War were made famous by the airing of the AMC historical drama Turn: Washington‚Äôs Spies.

Life story Samuel Spencer was born in East Haddan, Connecticut on January 21, 1734.There are two different dates listed for his birth year in different sources listed below, e.g. 1734 and 1738. 1734 appears to be the most authoritative. He was the son of Samuel Spencer and Jerusha Brainerd. He graduated from Nassau College (now Princeton University) in 1758. (He later received a LLD from Princeton in 1788.) After graduation in 1758, he moved to the Cheraws District in South Carolina where he married Phillipa Sybil Tisdale.There are different names given for his spouse and also speculation that Phillipa may have died giving birth to his first child and he married a second time to Sybil. His children were Mary, Nancy Anne, Claudius, and William Samuel Spencer. He moved to Anson County before 1774 and acquired over 2,000 acres of land in Anson County. He was elected to represent Anson County in the 1st North Carolina Provincial Congress in New Bern in 1774. He was again elected to the 3rd Provincial Congress in August 1775 in Hillsborough and the 4th Provincial Congress in Halifax in April 1776. He was one of three judges appointed to the first North Carolina Supreme Court in 1777. He was on the board of trustees of the University of North Carolina in 1789 and 1790. He was a leader of the Anti- Federalists in the North Carolina Conventions in 1788 (in Hillsborough) and 1789 (in Fayetteville). He was one of three jurists to hear the first case before the North Carolina Superior Court in 1787. =Military service= Prior to the American Revolution, Samuel was a colonel in the local militia, probably the Anson County Regiment as colonial militia. He was at the Battle of Alamance in 1771 supporting the royal government but his loyalty changed as the time of the American Revolution approached. The North Carolina General Assembly appointed Samuel Spencer as the commandant and colonel of the Anson County Regiment on September 9, 1775. He served in this position until February 1776. He did not lead his soldiers in any known engagement. He was replaced by Colonel Thomas Wade, who took command on March 2, 1776 and remained in command throughout the war. =Death= Spencer died in 1794 while resting at his home on Smith's Creek in Anson County under unusual circumstances. \\"It is reported that he had not been well and between court sessions was resting at his home. While sitting on the porch, with a red cap on his head, he became sleepy and began to nod; a large turkey gobbler apparently regarded the moving cap as a challenge and attacked. The justice was thrown from his chair and suffered numerous scratches from which erysipelas developed.\\" Samuel Spencer's life is detailed as one of three leaders for the Bill of Rights in North Carolina by Albert Coates.

Background Dr. Mugerwa was born on January 2, 1942 to Yowana Ziryawula and Maria Namatovu. He pursued his education at St. Mary's College Kisubi for both the O-Level and A-Level and was at the top of his class for all six years. Upon graduation, he admitted to Makerere University, Uganda's oldest and largest public university, and completed both undergraduate and masters programs. He received training in medicine and cardiology at Mulago Hospital and also pursued higher level instruction in the United States, United Kingdom, and the Netherlands. He then returned to Uganda and developed a career in Kampala, serving as faculty at both Mulago Hospital and Makerere University. Career = Early career = Dr. Mugerwa's initial specialization was cardiology, and this is what he pursued in the early stages of his career. By 1972, he was one of the first five research fellows to be trained at Mulago Cardiac Clinic, which is the precursor of the present-day Uganda Heart Institute (UHI). Not only did Dr. Mugerwa have a role in founding UHI, but he also served as both Executive Director and Director. Among his other efforts in the world of cardiac health in Uganda are introducing the practice of echocardiography, founding the country's first hypertension clinic, and establishing the Uganda Heart Association. = HIV/AIDS epidemic = Dr. Mugerwa's career would take a turn away from cardiology after the discovery of HIV/AIDS being present in Uganda. When scientist Wilson Carswell first confirmed there were HIV positive patients in Mulago Hospital in 1984, Dr. Mugerwa was part of a team that joined him as they went Masaka and Rakai and ascertained that the virus had spread there too. They published their findings in 1985, believing these Ugandans suffered from a manifestation of AIDS called Slim Disease, although it would later be known that they were dying of AIDS. In October 1985, shortly after their Slim Disease publication, Dr. Mugerwa attended a Workshop on AIDS in Central Africa, which was put on by the World Health Organization (WHO). The workshop discussed the establishment of an AIDS Surveillance System in every African country, which would be charged with confirming the presence of AIDS and collecting data. Dr. Mugerwa, along with two other colleagues, was appointed to Uganda's AIDS Surveillance Sub-Committee, and by 1986 they had succeeded in implementing public health efforts such as educational programs, supplying condoms, and screening potentially infected blood donors. They also emphasized mutual monogamy, openly disclosing one's HIV status, and increasing the number of available HIV tests. In the 1980s, Dr. Mugerwa was the Director of Medicine at Mulago Hospital, where the patient prevalence of AIDS reached up to 40% in 1988. During this time, he struggled with low access to confirmatory HIV tests, hospital overcrowding, and the challenge of deciding to tell patients they were dying of AIDS, due to the stigma and shame surrounding the disease. Outside of hospital work, he was one of the founding members of the Uganda-Case Western Reserve University Research Collaboration and held the position of lead principal investigator for twenty years. The main focus of this collaboration was HIV/AIDS and coinfection of tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals, and this was conducted mainly through clinical studies, providing care to patients, and investigating treatment and prevention methods. Founded in 1988, the collaboration continues to this day. At its 20th anniversary celebration, it was stated that the collaboration had provided over fifty Ugandans with upper level degrees, published over two- hundred articles in peer-reviewed journals, and presented at over five-hundred conferences. Dr. Mugerwa was also a member of the Academic Alliance for AIDS Care and Prevention in Africa. Established in 2001, the Alliance succeeded in providing treatment to patients with HIV/AIDS, training medical providers about HIV/AIDS care, installing programs to increase outreach and prevention efforts, and providing lab resources. The Infectious Disease Institute at Makerere University broke ground in 2003 to help carry out these efforts. Around this time, suspicions that questioned if HIV truly causes AIDS were circulating, and these were supported by South Africa's president Thabo Mbeki. In opposition to these denialist claims, over five-thousand scientists signed the Durban Declaration in 2000, which cited multiple studies that link HIV as the only cause of AIDS. Dr. Mugerwa demonstrated his support for the Durban Declaration's stance by being on its Organizing Committee. = HIV vaccine trial = From 1999 to 2002, Dr. Mugerwa conducted a clinical trial of a potential HIV vaccine in Uganda, the first of its kind in Africa. There were concerns about the safety of the volunteers that were recruited, but the normal ethics requirements were waived due to the need for a vaccine as quickly as possible. Uganda had an HIV prevalence of around 20% in 1998, and most citizens could not afford the antiretrovirals needed to prevent the development of AIDS. The prospect of testing a vaccine, however, was not without controversy. There were fears about the vaccine's scientific merit, vaccine recipients falsely testing positive for HIV, and the use of Ugandans as guinea pigs for risky experiments that would only benefit the West. The vaccine (named ALVAC 205) was tested on forty HIV-negative Ugandans, but was stopped in phase I after newer vaccines started to receive more attention. There was previously doubt about whether the different subtypes of HIV would need different vaccines, but volunteers that received the ALVAC 205 vaccine (designed to fight subtype B) produced blood samples that showed resistance to subtypes A and D as well. This demonstrated that a single HIV vaccine could potentially be effective against multiple HIV subtypes. Personal life Dr. Mugerwa was married to Rosemary Kibulo Mugerwa, a physical therapist, and they had eleven children together. Many of them followed their parents' example and also pursued careers in the medical field. Outside of his profession, Dr. Mugerwa was both a businessman and a farmer. His wife preceded him in death in November 2018. Death Dr. Mugerwa died on April 19, 2019 at Nakasero Hospital in Kampala. At the time of his death, he was a Professor Emeritus at Makerere University, where he had also gone to school and conducted research programs. He was said to be suffering from depression, which led to an onset of other illnesses. He was buried in Meru Village, located in Southwestern Uganda.

Before coming to Purdue, she was an Associate Professor in Gender & Women‚Äôs Studies and History at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign  Under Wraps: A History of Menstrual Hygiene Technology  In this book, Vostral presents and defines the menstrual hygiene technology sector in the United States. She shows how, in the United States, for the better part of the twentieth century, menstruation went hand-in-glove with menstrual hygiene. But how and why did this occur? The book looks at the social history of menstrual hygiene by examining it as a technology. In doing so, the lens of technology provides a way to think about menstrual artifacts, how the artifacts are used, and how women gained the knowledge and skills to use them. As technological users, women developed great savvy in manipulating belts, pins, and pads, and using tampons to effectively mask their entire menstrual period. This masking is a form of passing, though it is not often thought of in that way. By using a technology of passing, a woman might pass temporarily as a non-bleeder, which could help her perform her work duties and not get fired or maintain social engagements like swimming at a summer party and not be marked as having her period. How women use technologies of passing, and the resulting politics of secrecy, are a part of women's history that has remained under wraps. Vostral's conceptualisation of pads and tampons as technologies, and her use of 'passing' provided important intellectual frameworks for the field of Critical Menstrual Studies.  Toxic Shock: A Social History.  This book provided the first academic history of TSS. Vostral shows how commercial interests negatively impacted women's health outcomes; the insufficient testing of the first super-absorbant tampons; and how TSS became a 'women's disease,' for which women must constantly monitor their own bodies. A study at the intersection of public health and social history, this book brings to light the complexities behind a stigmatized and underdiscussed issue in women's reproductive health. Importantly, it warns that as we move forward with joint replacements, implants, and internal medical devices, we must understand the relationship of technology to bacteria and recognize that their interactions within the human body can bring about unexpected, and sometimes deadly, consequences  References  American women historians Living people Year of birth missing (living people) Purdue University faculty ","title":"Sharra L.

The Southern Textile Exposition (1915-2004) was an intermittent trade fair for textile manufacturers held in Greenville, South Carolina. By the early 20th century, American textile production had moved into the Carolina Piedmont from its earlier center in New England.E.D.G., \\"South Carolina's Mills,\\" New York Times, February 4, 1900, 8. By the second decade of the century, South Carolina ranked second only to Massachusetts in textile production; and Greenville, located between Charlotte and Atlanta, was central to the industry. In 1914, the Southern Textile Association approved the bid of Greenville mill owners to host the first textile machinery trade fair in the South.Ray Belcher, Greenville County, Carolina: From Cotton Fields to Textile Center of the World (Charleston: History Press, 2006), 63-65. The first show, in 1915, was held in borrowed warehouses; but the trade fair was so successful that Greenville's Southern Textile Exposition, Inc. soon raised the money needed to build a permanent exhibition space, Textile Hall, on West Washington Street, which was effectively completed before the second exposition in 1917.Yancey S. Gilkerson, \\"Textile Hall's First Sixty Years,\\" Proceedings and Papers of the Greenville County Historical Society, 5 (1980), 77-78. The five- story Textile Hall, approximately 101 by 235 feet, was designed by J. E. Sirrine and Company in Renaissance Revival style and was built by Fiske-Carter Construction Company on West Washington Street, near its intersection with Academy Street, in the western part of Greenville's central business district. Its auditorium, on the second level, included a stage and a balcony; and the tongue-and-groove maple floors were designed to accommodate operating textile machinery.. In succeeding years the exhibition was often held biennially.From 1915 to 1972, the exhibition was held in 1915, 1917, 1919, 1920, 1921, 1922, 1924, 1926, 1928, 1930, 1935, 1937, 1938, 1939, 1946, 1950, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1958, 1960, 1962, 1964, 1968, 1970, 1972. Clemson Library Special Collections By 1946 Greenville could advertise itself as the \\"Textile Capital of the World,\\" and by 1962 Textile Hall, even with nine annexes and additional leased space, proved inadequate to host the Textile Exposition.

The main exports of the Sasanians were silk; woolen and golden textiles; carpets and rugs; hides; and leather and pearls from the Persian Gulf. There were also goods in transit from China (paper, silk) and India (spices), which Sasanian customs imposed taxes upon, and which were re- exported from the Empire to Europe.Sarfaraz, p. 353 Due to special geographical situation of the Iranian world, the Sasanians were able to control the sea routes and due to this, they were arguably most important player in the international trade in the late antiquity.  Local trade  We know that in the early Sasanian period, the empire showed a great interest in establishing ports on the coast of the Persian Gulf. In the Karnamag of Ardashir Papagan (Book of Deeds of Ardashir son of Papak), one of these ports is mentioned, and it is called \\"B≈çxt-Artax≈°ƒ´r\\", which is modern-day Bushehr. This port was important for the Sasanians because it linked Kazerun to center of Persis, modern-day Shiraz. There were other ports on the Iranian side of the Persian Gulf in the Sassanid period, like SirƒÅf, Hormuz, Kujaran Artax≈°ƒ´r, etc. According to Ammianus Marcellinus ‚Äúall along the coast [of the Persian Gulf] is a throng of cities and villages, and many ships sail to and from.‚Äù  International trade  = Rivalry with the Roman Empire = We know that in the sixth century, the Sasanians were not only bent on controlling the Arabian sea and of course, their own home waters, the Persian Gulf, but also looked further east. This brought the Persians into conflict with Rome. Silk was important in the ancient world and was something that the Romans wanted. With the seas under Iranian control, the Romans had to seek the aid of the Ethiopians. However, this plan failed and probably caused the Aksumite‚ÄìPersian wars, which made Yemen an Iranian vassal at the end of the wars. Procopius states that Justinian sent and embassy to Axum, and requested the Ethiopians \\"that they should buy silk from the Indians, and sell it to the Romans. thus they would make a lot of money, while they would only be bringing this gain to the Romans, that they [the Romans] would no longer be forced to send their own money to their enemies [the Persians.]\\" However, the plan didn't succeed, \\"for it was impossible for the Ethiopians to buy silk from the Indians, because the Persian merchants present at the very ports [of Ceylon in Sri Lanka] where the first ships of the Indians put in, since they inhabit a neighboring country, were always accustomed to buy the entire cargoes.\\" However, it is not believed that being neighbors was the reason behind cooperation of Iranian and Sinhalese merchants, and the better reason would be that the Iranians were long-established customers and they didn't want to offend the Sasanians by doing business with the rivals of the Persian Empire. However, silk problem of the Romans was solved by the introduction of silkworms to the Roman Empire. = Trade with China = We also have information about the Sasanian trade with China. Iranian-Chinese trade was conducted through two ways, through the Silk Road and the sea routes. Many Sasanian coins were found on the coasts of China.  Bazaars  The main economic activity in the cities was performed by the merchants (Middle Persian: wƒÅzarganan) and took place in the bazaars. In the Sasanian-era bazaars, each group of artisans had its own specific section, called rƒÅste in Persian. We know this information from the Denkard, which talks about the rules that existed \\"about the series of shops in the bazaar belonging to various artisans.\\" (VIII, Chapter 38) The Denkard also mentions a list of professions who occupied a section of the bazaar, like the blacksmiths (Middle Persian: ƒÅhengar) and barbers (Middle Persian: wars-wirƒÅy). For each artisan guild (kirrog), there was a head of the guild (kirrogbed) and the activity and the prices of the bazaar were overlooked by a head of the bazaar, known as wƒÅzƒÅrbed in Middle Persian. This office (wƒÅzƒÅrbed) is also mentioned in the Res Gestae Divi Saporis.  Merchants  While there were Sasanian merchants as far as China, the Zoroastrian view on them is not very good. The Mƒìn≈çg of Khrad (Spirit of Wisdom), one of most important Zoroastrian books, talks about the merchants very negatively.  Iranian colonies in South and East Asia  We also know about establishments of Sasanian colony and ports as far as East Asia. There were a Sasanian colony in Malaysia which was composed of merchants. Since Persian horses were shipped to Ceylon, a Sasanian colony was established at that island, where the ships came from Iran to its port. To expand their trade, the Sasanians built more ports, in the places like Muscat and Sohar. We even know about Sasanian colonies at Kilwa on the east coast of Africa. Establishment Iranian colonies in China has also been confirmed, by the existence of Zoroastrian fire-temples, found in the Chang‚Äôan region in southern China.

Founding The Wknd was founded in 2008 by Fikri Fadzil, together with a team of volunteers from the Malaysian music scene. It started as a hobby and passion project, where the team got together on one weekend to record live music performances by Malaysian independent musicians - hence the moniker Wknd. The series of music video content was named The Wknd Sessions, and has been one of the longest-running music series in Southeast Asia. The series has cemented The Wknd's place as a tastemaker, through new discoveries and early indie scene stars. Since its inception, The Wknd has left an indelible mark on the regional music scene, establishing itself as the go-to source for those seeking out the freshest unsigned and independent music from Malaysia and Southeast Asia. Subject matter The Wknd's central premise was about raising awareness on the undiscovered artists who, despite their lack of mainstream popularity, was actively pursuing a music career through small gigs and music showcases. Many of these artists were also releasing material, through DIY efforts and the limited access to Internet and the social media of the time (mainly Myspace). While starting out predominantly covering the Malaysian independent music scene, The Wknd's focus has grown to cover other countries in Southeast Asia. Since its founding, they have also covered acts from Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Despite this increase in regional coverage, The Wknd's primary music focus has remained consistent - covering little-known acts that have talent and potential. The Wknd has also been called upon in the past to interview international acts that have toured to Malaysia. Some of the more prominent acts include Franz Ferdinand, Dune Rats, Deerhoof, Bo Ningen, Tonstartssbandht, Postiljonen, Mac Demarco and Ash. Music events The Wknd has created and curated different music showcases, with a specific format and formula for each: * Cross Border Showcase (2014, 2016): a touring music showcase series, where Southeast Asian artists are flown in to Malaysia and taken for a two-city tour over a span of 2‚Äì3 weeks * Piring-piring (2015): a vinyl market with DJ sets, food stalls and local fashion * Buka Panggung (2019): a one-day event that combines a music marketplace, talks and a music showcase by artists that have appeared on The Wknd's digital content and series Discoveries Aside from The Wknd Sessions being seen by musicians as a way to get discovered, The Wknd is also responsible for directly unearthing raw talent through its The Wknd Recording Fund initiative. This is a talent discovery platform, where up-and-coming talent submit their material for consideration by The Wknd team. Together with its appointed panel of judges, composed of prominent figures in the Southeast Asian independent music scene, one winner is selected and is awarded a record deal. With this deal, The Wknd produces and releases a single for the winning artist. Past winners of The Wknd Recording Fund are: * 2013: The Venopian Solitude * 2015: Orang Malaya In later years, The Wknd has teamed up with Vans Malaysia to help organize a similar initiative, under the umbrella campaign of Vans Musicians Wanted.

Emotionally, we had both been going through a lot... and it was our first time really even meeting. So when you have that time together, and then you're like, 'Okay, let's spill everything out on the table' it can get a little heavy.

In the clip, Michaels and LANY lead singer Paul Klein wander around the Santa Monica beachfront in solitude. They both end up at a roller derby, skating around and observing a masked dancer under a giant disco ball. Reception Madeline Roth from MTV said \\"The way [Michaels] and Klein repeat the song's central lyric ‚Äî \\"I'm gonna be okay / Right?\\" ‚Äî makes it both a declarative statement and a self-conscious query.\\" adding \\"their voices are intertwined throughout, breaking the traditional formula of a collaboration wherein artists take turns trading verses.\\" Rania Aniftos from Billboard said \\"It's so common to feel so low after a heartbreak that you start to wonder if you'll ever be okay again.

The game was created by Mike Shefler. Gameplay Quest of the Great Jewels was a computer-moderated play- by-mail game. It was a \\"closed ended wargame\\" with turn times of about three weeks for regular games and slightly longer for team games. Reviewer Dale A Perkins noted that it was most simply described as a \\"fantasy wargame centered on hand-to-hand combat\\". Quest involved twelve players, each of whom could choose one of four races, each of which had different objectives and powers: * Azoni were fighters who bred slowly and earned victory points by building citadels * Quntag were empire builders who earned victory points by controlling territory * Rilris were treasure seekers who earned money by hoarding money and magic treasures * Slenth bred at a prodigious rate, and although they were the weakest fighters, they earned victory points by destroying and ravaging The four races were well-balanced, with no race offering an advantage over the others. In addition to building and conquering, players could seek out magical talismans that would give them some sort of advantage over other players. These were found in neutral cities, in dragon hoards or in ten Forbidden Cities. In order to enter a Forbidden City, the player first had to happen upon a key. However, the player then had to discover the hidden location of the Forbidden City that the key opened in order to successfully unlock the gate and retrieve the magic jewel. The game's goal was to acquire all three of the \\"great jewels\\" which were \\"talismans of immense power\\". Another way to win the game was to have the highest score on the final turn. However, obtaining all three jewels ended the game automatically. By 1986, no one had yet done this. Finally, Zorph Enterprises announced in the May/June 1986 issue of Paper Mayhem, that a game had ended with someone capturing all three jewels (game QJ-13). When the game began, the victory condition was to be the first player to gain a specific but unrevealed number of victory points. However, after player complaints that the games were too short, Zorph Enterprises changed the victory condition, making the winner the player with the most victory points when the game ended at a specific but unrevealed point somewhere between Turn 20 and Turn 30. Quest of the Great Jewels was computer moderated, with a turn every 10 days. The initial cost was $10 for the rulebook and the first two turns, $2.50 for turns 3‚Äì10, and $3 for subsequent turns. Reception In the April 1985 edition of Dragon (Issue 96), Mike Gray was enthusiastic about the game, saying that it was \\"one of my favorite play-by-mail games... I enjoy building up my empire, sending great armies into battle, and capturing special magic items.\\" Gray did question the game balance, noting that as a Slenth \\"it seems to be very hard to get enough victory points to win... A Slenth must kill and destroy things... this is not as easy a task as it is for an Azoni to build citradels in the safety of his kingdom, or for a Rilris to hoard his money turn after turn.\\" Gray also didn't like the length of time it took to find a key to a Forbidden City and then discover which Forbidden City the key opened. \\"By the time you find out and fight your way through enemy territory to get there, the game will be close to being over.\\" He ended with a recommendation and a caution: \\"I like Quest of the Great Jewels very much and recommend it highly. However, it is very much a game of diplomacy. If you don‚Äôt spend time and money communicating with other players, you‚Äôll soon have many uninvited guests in your kingdom.\\" In the Sept- Oct 1985 edition of The Space Gamer (No. 76), David Ladyman gave the game a thumbs up, saying, \\"On balance, let me give an enthusiastic endorsement to Quest of the Great Jewels and to Zorph Enterprises. Their game entertains without annoying, and there aren't many games, especially by mail, of which that can be said.\\" In 1986, reviewer Dale A. Perkins stated that \\"If you are into Dungeons and Dragons' style combat, this is the game for you\\", recommending trying the game, regardless of gaming background. In 1991, reviewer Vickie Lloyd advised that her concerns with the game were \\"very minor\\" and Quest was \\"a great game and I very much recommend it\\", especially for beginners. In 1985, the game tied with DuelMasters, Pellic Quest, and Power for Third Place in the 1st Annual Paper Mayhem Awards for \\"Best PBM Game\\".

Thomson served with the Royal Munster Fusiliers from 1893 to 1914, serving in both the Second Boer War and the First World War, in which he was killed in the latter. He also played first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club, Free Foresters and the British Army cricket team. Life and military career The son of William Thomson, he was born at Moss Side in Manchester. He was educated firstly at Reverend E. W. Hobson's school in Southport, before attending Fettes College in Edinburgh. After leaving Fettes, he decided on a career in the army and attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. He graduated from Sandhurst in October 1893, entering into the Royal Munster Fusiliers as a second lieutenant. He was promoted to the rank of lieutenant in February 1896, and served as the adjutant of the 2nd battalion from 1899 to 1903. He was promoted to the rank of captain in July 1901. Thomson served with his battalion in the Second Boer War and was present during operations in the Transvaal, for which he was mentioned in dispatches in July 1902. After the end of the war that month, Thomson left South Africa with other men of his battalion on the SS Orient in October 1902, and was stationed in Ireland. He later returned to South Africa and served as a staff captain for the Pretoria sub-district from March 1906 to June 1909. He was promoted to the rank of major in March 1912, while in May 1912 he was made a brigade-major and seconded to the Middlesex Infantry Brigade. In July of the same year he appeared in a Minor Counties Championship match for Wiltshire. He made his debut in first-class cricket for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against Kent at Lord's in May 1913. He appeared in two further first-class fixtures in 1913, playing for the MCC against Hampshire and for the Free Foresters against Oxford University. He made three further first-class appearances in 1914, playing twice for the MCC against Yorkshire and Hampshire, as well as appearing for the British Army cricket team against Cambridge University at Fenner's. In six first-class matches, Thomson scored 201 runs at an average of 18.27, with a high score of 53. At the start of the First World War in July 1914, he was still serving with the Middlesex Infantry Brigade, but returned to the Royal Munster Fusiliers in October 1914. He was killed in action on 21 December 1914, while leading an attack on German trenches at Festubert in France. His body was not recovered from the battlefield and he was later commemorated at the Le Touret Memorial.

Some opponents emphasized \\"calling out\\" tactics, labelling the alt-right with terms like \\"racist\\", \\"sexist\\", \\"homophobic\\", and \\"white supremacist\\" in the belief that doing so would scare people away from it. Many commentators urged journalists not to refer to the alt-right by its chosen name, but rather with terms like \\"neo-Nazi\\". There was much discussion within U.S. public discourse as to how to avoid the \\"normalization\\" of the alt-right. The activist group Stop Normalizing, which opposes the normalization of terms like alt-right, developed the \\"Stop Normalizing Alt Right\\" Chrome extension. The extension went viral shortly after the release of Stop Normalizing's website. The extension changes the term \\"alt-right\\" on webpages to \\"white supremacy\\". The extension and group were founded by a New York-based advertising and media professional under the pseudonym George Zola. Some on the political right, including Milo Yiannopoulos, suggest that the alt-right's appeal would be diffused if society gave in to many of its less extreme demands, including curbing political correctness and ending mass immigration. Yiannopoulos added that, as part of such an approach, the left should cease holding different social groups to different standards of behavior. He noted that if the left wanted to continue using identity politics as the basis of much of its mobilization, it would have to accept white identity politics as a permanent fixture of the political landscape. Similarly, in highlighting the commonalities between alt-right and \\"left-identitarian\\" forms of identity politics, Gray suggested the alt-right's presence might encourage \\"the intersectional Left and its allies\\" to increasingly critique the theoretical basis on which their own identity politics is built. Other commentators, like the conservative David Frum, have suggested that if issues like immigration policy were discussed more openly in public discourse, then the alt-right would no longer be able to monopolize them. Some opponents sought to undermine the alt-right's stereotype of leftists as being devoid of humor and joy by using its own tactics of humor and irony against it. For instance, when alt- rightists became angry or upset, some of their opponents described them as \\"snowflakes\\" who were being \\"triggered\\". Anti-fascist activists also adopted the alt-right's use of pranks; on several occasions they publicized events in which they were purportedly meeting to destroy Confederate monuments or gravestones. Alt-rightists mobilized to publicly defend these sites, only to find that no such anti-fascist event was happening at all. Within feminist circles, the alt-right's desired future was repeatedly compared to the Republic of Gilead, the fictional dystopia in Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale (1985) and its 2017 television adaptation. Anti-racist counter-protests at the 2017 Unite the Right rally Various opponents have also employed doxing, publicly revealing the identities and addresses of alt-rightists, many of whom had previously acted anonymously. This tactic discourages individuals from involving themselves in alt-right activities to begin with, as they fear that should they be outed as alt-rightists they might face repercussions such as job loss, social ostracization, or violence. From 2016 onward, some anti- fascist opponents of the alt-right also resorted to physical confrontation and violence against the movement. On Trump's inauguration day for example, a masked anti-fascist punched Spencer in the face when he was talking to reporters; the footage was widely shared online. Hawley noted that this tactic could be counter-productive to the anti-alt-right case, as it reinforces the narrative that alt-rightists peacefully engaging in their constitutionally- protected right to free speech were being victimized. Other commentators have called for more vigorous policing of the web by governments and companies to deal with the alt-right. If denied access to mainstream social media outlets, the alt-right would be restricted to far-right online venues like Stormfront, where it would be isolated from and ignored by those not already committed to its cause. Many in the alt-right concur that denying it access to social media would have a devastating effect on its ability to proselytize. It has however been suggested that such censorship could backfire, as it would play into the alt-right narrative that those campaigning for white interests were being marginalized by the establishment, thus aiding the movement's recruitment. Suppressing the alt-right in this manner would also set a precedent which could be repeated for other groups in future, including leftist ones. Phillips and Yi argued that such leftist attempts to prevent alt-right speech reflected an \\"authoritarian shift\\" which was becoming \\"increasingly hegemonic\\" within the American Left and that endorsed the view that \\"limiting or preventing the public speech of historically privileged groups (typically, whites, males) is acceptable until power relations are equalized.\\" In June 2017, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to \\"'decry every form of racism, including alt-right white supremacy as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ'\\".  Conservatives  U.S. conservatives were generally quick to condemn the alt- right as a racist movement. However, condemning it in this way placed conservatives in an awkward rhetorical position; for several years, conservatives had widely presented themselves as the challengers of liberal political correctness, but in condemning others for racism they opened themselves to the accusation that they too were upholders of political correctness. Writing in The Federalist, the conservative political scientist Nathanael Blake stated that Christianity and Greco-Roman philosophy, rather than race, are the foundations upon which Western civilization was built and that the alt-right is actually attacking Western civilization rather than defending it. Writing for National Review, French called alt-rightists \\"wanna- be fascists\\" and bemoaned their entry into the national political conversation; in the same publication, Ian Tuttle rejected the alt-right claim that \\"American conservatism was willfully complicit in the rise of the identity-politics Left\\" as \\"simply nonsense\\". In The Federalist, Cathy Young stated that the website Radix Journal had replaced the Alternative Right website and describes a Radix Journal article on abortion which proclaimed that the pro-life position is \\"dysgenic\\" since it encourages breeding by 'the least intelligent and responsible' women\\". Writing for The Weekly Standard, Benjamin Welton instead described the alt-right as a \\"highly heterogeneous force\\" that \\"turns the left's moralism on its head and makes it a badge of honor to be called 'racist,' 'homophobic,' and 'sexist'\\".  Liberals  Writing for The New Yorker, Benjamin Wallace-Wells described it as a \\"loosely assembled far-right movement\\", but he said that its differences from the conventional right-wing in American politics are more a matter of style than of substance: \\"One way to understand the alt-right is not as a movement but as a collective experiment in identity, in the same way that many people use anonymity on the Internet to test more extreme versions of themselves\\". Chris Hayes on All In with Chris Hayes described alt-right as a euphemistic term for \\"essentially modern-day white supremacy\\". BuzzFeed reporter Rosie Gray described the alt-right as \\"white supremacy perfectly tailored for our times\\", saying that it uses \\"aggressive rhetoric and outright racial and anti-Semitic slurs\\" and that it has \\"more in common with European far-right movements than American ones\\". Writing for Haaretz, Yishai Schwartz described the alt-right as \\"vitriolically anti-Semitic\\", saying that \\"[t]he 'alternative' that the alt-right presents is, in large part, an alternative to acceptance of Jews\\" and warned that it must be taken seriously as a threat. Also writing for Haaretz, Chemi Shalev has observed that alt-right supporters of Trump \\"despise Jewish liberals with same venom that Israeli right detests Jewish leftists\\".

Bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica and Megadeth have had the greatest influences on Bangladeshi heavy metal musicians. Other 1970s bands to influence are bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath and Mot√∂rhead. First bands to deploy heavy metal in Bangladesh are bands like Warfaze and Rockstrata. The most prominent era for heavy metal movement was between early 1990s to early 2000s. Warfaze, Rockstrata, Aces and In Dhaka are often considered as the \\"big four founders of heavy metal\\". Other 2000s metal bands are bands like Artcell, Aurthohin, Cryptic Fate, Powersurge, Mechanix, Metal Maze, Vibe and Stentorian. Alternative bands like Nemesis, Arbovirus and Black also played some alternative metal songs over the years. Warfaze, Artcell and Aurthohin together is the most popular rock/metal trio of Bangladesh.  History  = 1960s and 1970s (Pre-history) =  Antecedents: 1960s (Blues Rock)  Although there are no identical Bangladeshi metal bands formed in 1960s and 1970s, but some blues-based rock bands helped to emerge heavy rock in Bangladesh. Such a band was \\"Windy Side of Care\\", formed in 1964, Dhaka. Being one of the earliest rock bands to form in Bangladesh. Mainly inspired by rock n' roll artists like Elvis Presley, Cliff Richard and The Shadows, they mixed psychedelic rock, hard rock, blues rock with Bengali Classical music. Initially they didn't intend to record their stuffs but to mess with their gigs. They used to jam at Shahbag Hotel. They jammed at high volume, so loud that they were told to turn down their volume by their grandfather. Their long instrumental jamming through high amps, powerful distortion and frequent whammy bar sets an early example of heavy rock in the Bangladeshi music scene. They didn't go commercially successful but their early works and experiments indicate the major movement of heavy rock in Bangladesh. Although they are very less known to modern fans, but some of their records were recovered. They made a deal with EMI record labels to record an album in 1968.  Heavy rock influence: Mid to late '70s  Later in the 1970s, many pop rock and psychedelic rock bands were formed in Bangladesh. Although most of them did not play or contribute much to heavy metal but some bands like Miles, Feedback and Feelings played some hard rock songs in their concerts drawn from psychedelic and blues rock. Miles, despite being a pop rock and blues rock band, used to play few hard rock songs in their live concerts, around the early 1980s. James from Feelings (now known as Nogor Baul) was a pioneering psychedelic rock artist of Bangladesh. He too approached with heavy rock riffs and solos. Late Ayub Bachchu was a member of the pop rock band, Souls, who later formed his own band, LRB. Ayub Bachchu, too, came forward with his technical guitar playing by following the bluesy styles, which also helped emerging heavy rock in Bangladesh. = 1980s and 1990s (Origins) =  Foundation: 1980-1993  Rockstrata was one of the pioneering metal bands of Bangladesh along with Warfaze. They disbanded soon after their influential debut album, \\"Rockstrata\\" The 1980s was the most important decade for foundation of heavy metal in Bangladesh. heavy metal and hard rock became very popular among young music fans. The young musicians picked up their instruments and started to cover hard rock and heavy metal songs. They also followed the styles of English and American metal bands styles - growing long hair, forming bands with English names, wearing tight jeans, t-shirt, boots, etc. However, due to cultural impact and strictness, many boys weren't allowed to grow long hair until they became famous. Back in the 1980s, there was no Internet connection or much broadcasting facilities in Bangladesh for foreign heavy metal bands. But there was also a local shop called, \\"Rainbow\\", in Dhaka, which used to distribute foreign metal bands' albums. The shop played an important role for inspiring Bangladeshi musicians with foreign metal acts. The shop is still activate. Primarily drawing influences from NWOBHM bands such as Iron Maiden and Mot√∂rhead with an early influence of 1970s traditional heavy metal bands such as Deep Purple and Black Sabbath, many underground hard rock and heavy metal bands were formed in Dhaka from early to mid-1980s. It was an immediate response of New Wave of British Heavy Metal music from Bangladeshi musicians. Many psychedelic rock and blues rock artists of Bangladesh also inspired them to go forward. While some young guitarists at that time were also impressed by the guitar playing of neoclassical metal artists such as Ritchie Blackmore, Randy Rhoads, Yngwie Malmsteen, Jason Becker and Paul Gilbert. The first ever Bangladeshi heavy metal band to be formed was \\"Waves\\" on 25 December 1981, Frankfurt, Germany. The band was formed by three Bangladeshi teenagers - Iftekhar, Mahmud and Mithu living in the Germany. Their early influences include hard rock and metal bands like AC/DC, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Motorhead, Thin Lizzy and Van Halen. They returned to Bangladesh in 1983. In 1984, Waves recorded three songs for BTV for its upcoming Eid show but BTVs GM called the entire show an \\"Opo- Shankscrity\\" and decided not to air Waves. Following that incident, Waves was banned from performing at the venues in Bangladseh including BTV. Many line up changes happened while some of the members moved abroad. They covered \\"Heaven and Hell\\" of Black Sabbath in 1985. A video footage can be found on YouTube about their lead singer asking their audiences if it was right banning Waves from performing on BTV and if they (the audience) would want to cut Iftekhar's (their bassist) long hair. Waves disbanded in 1985. And after almost ten years they released their only album, Purono Smriti. They have been inactive for ever since after 1996. In 1984, Warfaze was formed. They were young heavy metal fans from St.Joeseph. At the time heavy metal wasn't yet mainstream music in Bangladesh. Mainstream music included genres such as pop, folk and blues. So, Warfaze started as a cover band. They used to cover English hard rock and heavy metal songs of bands such as Deep Purple, Iron Maiden and Dokken. After multiple line-up changes and 7 years later of their formation they released their self-titled debut album, \\"Warfaze\\", in 1991 under Sargam records. The album is considered one of the most influential heavy metal albums of Bangaldesh. Songs like \\"Boshe Achi\\" and \\"Ekti Chele\\" were big hits. Warfaze continued working on their following albums - \\"Obak Valobasha\\", \\"Jibon Dhara\\" and \\"Oshamajik\\" in the '90s. Although at the time, there were few bands who played heavy riffs and solos, but there were no bands who had a singer like Warfaze's first singer, Sunjoy. Most of the metal/hard rock bands' vocalists where singing in melodic vocals with heavy riffs. But Sunjoy's powerful high-pitched screaming voice helped developing the idea of heavy metal singing. He was inspired by and often followed the singing style of Ian Gillan. His screams in \\"Ekti Chele\\" is a perfect example of it which lasts for about 20 seconds. Sunjoy has been the most influential heavy metal vocalist of Bangladesh. On the other hand, Warfaze's lead guitarist, Kamal's fast arpeggios with alternate and sweep picking, tapping, dive bombs and melodic structures uses created heavy metal riffs and solos in their songs. Kamal is one of the pioneering shredders of Bangladesh. His shredding solos took Warfaze's music to neoclassical metal edge. Warfaze along with their music also helped to improve rebellious lyrics in Bangladeshi Rock music. Most of their songs were about anti-establishment, complicated lives and socialism. Both of their albums, \\"Jibon Dhara\\" (Living Style) and \\"Oshamajik\\" (Anti- Social) indicate it. While Jibon Dhara was more about political theme, Oshamajik was more about social struggles. Their lyrics helped pushing the boundary of romantic lyrics. Warfaze has been the most important rock and metal band of Bangladesh for their influence and consistency, running for over three decades and still going. Rockstrata, another metal band was formed in 1985. They too were students of St.Joseph college. They were initially inspired by Black Sabbath. They used to cover various songs of Black Sabbath. Later they gained interest in Iron Maiden. They released their self-titled debut album in 1992. Their music, especially guitar riffs were heavier compared to other rock bands of their time. But after releasing their debut album, they stayed dormant for over 20 years. Although they returned to the scene with their second album, \\"Notun Shaader Khoje\\" (In Search of New Taste) in 2014. Both Rockstrata and Warfaze have been cited as the first heavy metal bands of Bangladesh by music critics. However both being contemporaries to each other, Warfaze and Rockstrata had significant differences in their musical styles. Rockstrata sounded more brutal and heavy which could be compared to doom metal music of Black Sabbath. While Warfaze approached more as a technical and fast-paced band pretty similar to speed metal sound of Deep Purple. In Dhaka, another band formed in the late 80s to early 90s, was also influential towards hard rock and heavy metal. They released their debut album in, \\"Nishshobdo Kolahol\\" in 1992. But they too became inactive after mid 90s. Meanwhile, another hard rock trio named \\"Kirtinasha\\" (Destroyed) who formed in 1988, released their debut album, \\"\\"Kirtinasha\\" in 1993 under Asia Voice records. Kirtinasha was one of the few bands who didn't release their albums under Sargam label. They were one of the pioneering hard rock bands of Bangladesh who recorded some of their earliest stuffs in 1988 but didn't release anything until their debut album. Kirtinasha's songs were about natural calamities, anti-love, conflicts, narcissism, terrorism and deaths. Kirtinasha never went mainstream like Warfaze or Rockstrata. But their song, \\"Dhoroni\\" (Earth) was successful among hard rock fans of that time. Kirtinasha had no activity after mid-1990s. Their members pursued their personal lives and left the music industry after mid-1990s. Aces was another popular rock band formed in late 1980s. They were very technically proficient but didn't release any album. Thus they faded from the music scene after the 1990s.  Emergence: 1994-1999  Cryptic Fate was one of the leading metal bands to next-generation heavy metal of Bangladesh from the mid 1990s to early 2000s. Followed by the groundbreaking success of Warfaze and Rockstrata, several heavy metal and hard rock bands were formed between mid to late 1990s. Bands such as Artcell, Cryptic Fate, Aurthohin and Vikings were the main ones. Ever since then they have been playing important roles for developing different heavy metal genres in Bangladesh. Cryptic Fate is a prime example of it. They formed in 1993 and released their debut album, \\"Ends Are Forever\\", in 1994 which was written in English. Ends Are Forever was the first ever English metal album recorded by a Bangladeshi artist. Cryptic Fate was the second most important metal band of Bangladesh. They were one of the leading bands of next generation Bangladeshi heavy metal music. They started to write in Bengali in their later albums. Although they started as a traditional heavy metal band but their next albums included more complex guitar solos and drumming. Thus their songs became very influential towards development of progressive metal in Bangladesh. Their songs often contained fast-tempoed heavy riffs and deep voice which reached to progressive-death metal edge. Cryptic Fate often wrote lyrics about liberation war of Bangladesh. Cryptic Fate is the longest most active metal band after Warfaze. There have been some important metal bands from early to late 1990s, who were popular during that time but didn't go mainstream or didn't remain active. Bands like these include - Legend, Psychodeth, Trashold, Phantom Lord, Metal Warriors etc. Gibran Tanwir formed, Deth Row, in 1991, which did its first show in 1994 and was a huge part of underground Metal scene. Gibran had a band called, Glad Tiders with Sohel and drummer Daiyan Mir.Psychodeth, another metal band formed in the early 1990s, and performed in many shows together. Thrashold was formed by Zia of Shironamhin in 1992. Zia was a teenager at the time. The band played few live concerts, but this lasted briefly. Zia later approached his career as a folk and alternative rock musician. = 2000s and 2010s (Mainstream) =  Development of Subgenres: 2000-2010  Artcell, a progressive metal band formed in 1999. They released their debut album, \\"Onno Shomoy\\" in 2002 and \\"Oniket Prantor\\" in 2006. Both of their albums were big hits for their melodic vocals and acoustic riffs along with musical complexity. In 2000s heavy metal started to become mainstream in Bangladeshi music scene. Thrash metal bands like Metallica and Megadeth had directly influenced young musicians of Bangladesh. As a result, the thrashier tone had become more common in Bangladeshi metal bands. The groove metal sound also became common among musicians. Primarily inspiring by English and American thrash and groove metal bands with ground breaking success of Bangladeshi metal bands in the 1990s, many underground bands were formed in early 2000s. By the beginning of 2000s, Aurthohin released their debut album, Trimatrik in 2000. After that they constantly released their albums the next years, 2001, 2002 and 2003. They have been one of the most important bands for laying out different genres of heavy metal in Bangladesh. Aurthohin's leader, Sumon used to arrange different types of musical instruments to experiment with genres. He featured growling along with screaming in his songs. Singers such as Imtiaz and Rafa were invited to work for his albums. They backed up Sumon for growling and screaming when Sumon was unable to sing in metal voice. Some of their most notable growls in songs are such as Guti-From Hell, Shaat Din (Seven Days) and Protirup (Replica). Meanwhile, their first lead guitarist, Piklu, developed his guitar skills. He mastered on various fast-scales with different types of picking techniques. He then started to play various genres such as heavy metal, thrash metal, speed metal, groove metal etc. Piklu was one of the most important metal guitarists in history of Bangladeshi metal. Piklu is often considered as the first guitarist to play fast-paced heavy metal riffs. Piklu's fast-paced guitar riffs and solos helped bringing the extreme metal tone in Aurthohin's songs. Several extreme metal guitarists were inspired by Piklu's guitar playing. Aurthohin's song, \\"Shaat Din\\" from \\"Notun Diner Michile\\" spanned for 28 minutes and 31 seconds. Being the longest track ever recorded by a Bangladeshi rock artist. \\"Shaat Din\\" features various music arrangements, eleven guitar solos (all played by Piklu), several bass solos (all done by Sumon) and brutal growling as well as melodic vocals, pianos rhythms and violin solos, being a good example of progressive metal. Sumon's slap bassing also helped to create the funky sound for the band, emerging genres like funk rock and funk metal. Aurthohin due to Sumon's illness stopped their activities after 2003. But when Sumon started to recover from his illness, they continued their works from 2008. Vikings, another award-winning band of the 1990s released their debut album, \\"Jiboner Kolahol\\" in 2000. They featured heavy riffs in their songs. Their songs also featured massive whammy bar and pedal uses. Although they soon became inactive for over a decade but returned to scene with their movie soundtrack. Meanwhile, Artcell, another promising band formed in 1999, released their debut album 2002. Being the Bangladesh's most popular progressive metal band. Their main inspiration was Metallica. They used to cover various songs of Metallica at the earliest years. Warfaze also inspired them as a Bangladeshi metal band. They released their second album, \\"Oniket Prantor\\" in 2006. They have had the biggest hits for their catchy riffs and vocals. Two of their most famous songs, \\"Poth Chola\\" and \\"Oniket Prantor\\" both featured catchy acoustic plucking which helped making their music go mainstream even among general non-metalhead music fans. On the other hand, Lincoln, their lead singer's melodic vocal skills attracted many fans to their songs. Artcell has been one of the most technically proficient bands of Bangladesh. Their drummer, Shaju's fast and technical drum solos set a new example in Bangladesh. Shaju is often considered as the greatest and most technical drummer of Bangladesh. Some of his notable drumming are - \\"Oniker Prantor\\", \\"Dukhkhyo Bilash\\", \\"Poth Chola\\" etc. On the other hand, Ershad's technical guitar solos made their songs even more complex. Artcell's songs, combined with soft melody and complexity, helped making progressive metal go mainstream. Artcell also wrote some of the most complex lyrics in history of Bangladeshi rock music. Their primary lyricist was Rupok. But after his death, Ruman Ahmed wrote songs for them. During the mid 2000s, a music show program called, \\"Rock Link\\", hosted by Bassbaba Sumon and Jewel, used to promote several rock bands of Bangladesh. The show promoted many metal bands too. After mid-2000s several extreme metal bands were formed. Severe Dementia, being the first death metal band in Bangladesh, was formed in 2004. Severe Dementia was originally named as, \\"666\\". But due to cultural impact, it was named to Severe Dementia. Severe Dementia, however was no the only first metal band to play death metal. But their popularity crossed any other death metal in their time. The first death metal sound was introduced by bands like Cryptic Fate, who contributed to death metal riffs but didn't carry on it. Severe Dementia didn't release any full album. But they released an EP album, \\"Epitaph of Plassey\\" under Indian record label, \\"Demonstealer Records\\". Their music included blast-drum beats, fast-paced guitar riffs, guttural growls and screams. Their lyrics also were about ancient historical events and brutality. Powersurge was formed in 2006 as a thrash metal band. In 2006, De-illumination was formed. Sazzad Arefeen with help of Shams Mansoor Gani (keyboardist from Warfaze) experimented with classical and symphonic music. Sham's background keyboards helped creating the music of Symphonic Metal. Thus it led them being the first symphonic metal band of Bangladesh. They released only one album in 2010. Sazzad Arefeen also reformed his own side project, Sazzad Arefeen's Angry Machine and continued his works there. Hallucination is considered to be the pioneer of Bengali melodic death metal. Formed in the year 2010 Hallucination has released one single and one studio album Krittrim Prithibi (2013). The album was released digitally in Bangladesh by Incursion Music in 2013.They are the first ones in the music industry to introduce the bkash way of buying an album and in addition they are also the first band to release a Bengali album in compact discs in the Oceania continent(Satanica Productions Australasia). Their first album Krittrim Prithibi (2013) is the benchmark for Bengali Melodic Death Metal.  Fusion Genres and Experiments: 2010 and Onwards  At the end of 2010s many alternative rock bands were formed. However, they, too, played some heavy metal songs. Bands such as Nemesis, Black and Arbovirus have been the most notable ones. Arbovirus, despite having very few elements of metal in their songs, gained much popularity for their alternative and nu-metal musical styles. They are seen as a metal band by general music fans of Bangladesh. While, Nemesis often featured heavy solos and riffs which helped emerging the alternative metal in Bangladesh. Bands like Funeral Anthem, Minerva and Hallucination also helped making new extreme metal albums. But not all of them became successful. Combining the spirits of melodic structures with speed metal, Funeral Anthem became one of the pioneering power metal band of Bangladesh. In 2013, Minerva released their debut album, \\"Biday Shongbidhan\\" (Farewell Constitution). The album contained deep growling voice with groovy riffs and solos. Although not being the first groove metal band, but Minerva earned huge popularity as a groove metal band. In 2015 they held a tribute concert for Bangladeshi rock artists - Azam Khan, Nogor Baul, LRB, Mile, Warfaze, Aurthohin, Cryptic Fate, Artcell, Black, Nemesis, Arbovirus, Powersurge and Mechanix. Hallucination is another notable band, which was formed in 2010, Dhaka. Hallucination played melodic death metal songs with heavy metal elements. They released their full-length debut album, Krittrim Prithibi in 2013 and they are considered the pioneers of melodic death metal act in Bangladesh.Bay of Bengal, another band form Chittagong was formed in 2016. They released only one album in 2016. Their influences include, Megadeth, Pantera, Eluveitie etc. They collaborated folk and classical elements with heavy metal. According to their official Facebook page, they identified themselves as an experimental metal band. Their music feature flute solos, which often sound like, \\"Eluveitie\\". Bay of Bengal gained success from publishing their music videos on YouTube. One of their music videos was created to raise awareness about suicide.https://www.dhakatribune.com/showtime/2017/09/25/bay-bengals-music- video-raise-social-awareness-suicide Their lead singer Bakhtiyar said on the matter, There have been some solo acts by musicians too. Oni Hasan is a prominent Bangladeshi guitarist. He was initially the guitarist of band, Vibe. Later he joined Warfaze in 2008 in absence of Kamal. Oni Hasan worked on the albums - Pothchola and Shotto. He showed some extraordinary guitar skills. His influences include Dimebag Darrel, Jason Becker, Marty Friedman, etc. Although Kamal started the neoclassical metal act by playing technical solos on Warfaze's songs since the beginning, but Oni helped taking it further. After leaving Warfaze in 2014, Oni worked as solos artist. He released some instrumental tracks with other musicians. Most of his songs included shredding and jamming. Oni is currently living in UK for his study. He became popular internationally. Oni Hasan was endorsed by Carvin guitars.  Underground Metal Bands  Over the years there have been significant underground metal bands who didn't go mainstream. Most of these metal bands were either black metal or bands having satanic lyrics. Satanik a black metal band (later derived to technical brutal black metal) was formed in early 2000s,https://www.thedailystar.net/news-detail-107379 almost never went mainstream for their Satanic themes. Although in their interview they denied being a devil or Satan-promoting band. Their lead guitarist Nayeem said, Other bands include, Barzak, Bloodlust, Orator, Nafarmaan and Poizon Green. Poizon Green had initial success but only among hardcore metal fans. Apart from controversies bands, there have been many metal bands who didn't go mainstream and remained as underground bands. Bands such as Scarecrow, Metal Maze, and Exenemy are some notable ones. Musicians like Rafa and Jewel played important roles for development of underground metal bands. Many compilation albums have been released throughout the years for promoting underground metal bands. Popular underground mix albums are - Lokayoto, Agontuk 1 and 2, Underground 1 and 2, and Republic. Although these albums were recorded in intention to promote underground bands but many popular rock and metal bands like Aurthohin, Black, Arbovirus, Artcell also played on those albums. Underground 1, composed by Kamal, was a big hit.  International popularity of Bangladeshi metal bands  Although most Bangladeshi metal bands are not listened worldwide due to the Bengali language but because of some international ranking websites some bands have come to knowledge internationally. For example, Warfaze was ranked 5th in \\"Best Hard Rock Bands\\" on TheTopTens. Sometimes they pushed even further and ranked 4th, surpassing classic hard rock bands like Aerosmith, Queen, Bon Jovi and Van Halen. Their current drummer and leader Tipu said on the matter, Five metal bands, Ionic Bond, Karmna, Trainwreck, Infidel and Torture GoreGrinder were selected for participating WOA metal battle. Artcell was also ranked as number 1 as best Asian hard rock/metal band on TheTopTens. Surpassing bands like Boris and X-Japan. Warfaze was raked 4th on the list. Bassbaba Sumon, was also ranked as number 1 on \\"Best Slap Bassists\\" list. Surpassing bassists like Les Claypool, VIctor Wooten and Flea. He earned a significant position among top bassists. Although most of these Bangladeshi artists were added by Bangladeshi music fans, but they got well known and were praised by many foreign music fans. = Controversy = Although there are no controversies or conflicts of Bangladeshi heavy metal bands internationally, but some conflicts started between fans considering the \\"sound of heavy metal\\". Such a small conflict was when Aurthohin was denied being a metal band on Metallum. Moderators of Metallum never explained their reasons and the situation didn't affect anyone.  Current Status of Bangladeshi Heavy Metal  Even though heavy metal in Bangladesh was very popular from late 1990s to early 2000s, but in recent events and analysis it shows that the popularity of Heavy Metal is decreasing. Many soft rock and alternative rock bands are taking the place of heavy metal. Bands like Shunno, Old School, Lalon and Recall came forward in the medias and radios. So, newly formed metal bands are not getting enough recognition or becoming mainstream. Foreign music scenes, especially music from India - Bollywood music and hip-hop music are dominating the radios and television. Most radio channels and televisions are only interested in broadcasting soft music and pop. Only few hit metal songs are played sometimes. There aren't much broadcasting facilities for newly formed metal bands.  Important Record Labels  Although most record labels now are interested in recording any metal albums, but in 1990s it was very difficult to record a heavy metal album. Sargam was the first record label to record a heavy metal album.http://archive.thedailystar.net/magazine/2004/04/05/coverstory.htm If it wasn't for Sargam, then it would be much more difficult and would take many more years to release any metal albums by heavy metal artists. Sargam was interested in recording various genres of albums. All metal bands - Warfaze, Rockstrata, In Dhaka and Aces were signed by Sargam. Sargam signed a deal with Rockstrata with 30k tk to record their debut album, \\"Rockstrata\\". A mixed album called, \\"Hooray\\" was huge inspiration towards metal bands of today. It was the first movement for heavy metal. Iqbal Asif Jewel has produced and composed several metal artists' albums including most of Aurthohin's albums and Artcell's second album, \\"Oniket Prantor\\". He was a guitarist/vocalist for Warfaze on \\"Oshamajik\\" album. Other record labels are record labels like G-Series, Ektaar Music Ltd, Soundtek, Deadline Music and Incursion Music. G-Series is the most important record label of Bangladesh after Sargam. They have recorded a number of metal albums through the 1990s, 2000s and 2010s. Almost all notable metal bands are signed with G-Series.

Her parents were born in the United States, and are second generation to Holocaust survivors. She is the youngest of four children, three of whom left their religious life, including Kovari. Her mother, Hannah Levinsky, was a major influence on her. According to Kovari, \\"my mother is a feminist within the religious community.

While still at Rimon, she met fellow musician Ziv Zack, with whom she established the indie rock band Kovari. The other bandmates are Maor Allush (bass and backup vocals) and Itai Kfir (drums).

Kim wrestled for the South Korean squad in two editions of the Summer Olympics (1996 and 2000) and came closest to the medal haul in 2000 (finishing fifth overall in the men's 76-kg division). Outside the Olympic career, Kim collected a total of five medals in a major international tournament, including a gold at the 2002 Asian Games in Busan. Worked as a full-time employee for Korean Housing Company, Kim trained throughout his wrestling career for the company's sports club, under his personal coach Kim Chang-duk. Kim made his Olympic debut in Atlanta 1996, competing in the men's welterweight category (74 kg). There, he opened his match by easily throwing Sweden's Torbj√∂rn Kornbakk off the mat with a superb 11‚Äì0 verdict, but could not overthrow the defending champion Mnatsakan Iskandaryan of Russia in the next round, dropping him out of the winners' circle by a formidable 0‚Äì4 decision. Entering the repechage stage, Kim avenged his defeat from Iskandaryan to tame the U.S. wrestler Gordy Morgan with a close 3‚Äì2 verdict, before he lost his subsequent bout to Bulgarian opponent Stoyan Stoyanov (5‚Äì0) that left him injured and frail at the very end. At the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Kim qualified for his second South Korean team in the men's middleweight division (76 kg). Seven months earlier, he beat Uzbekistan's Evgeny Erofalyov for the top spot at the final match of the second Olympic Qualification Tournament in Tashkent. Kim dominated the three-man prelim pool by subduing Azerbaijan's Khvicha Bichinashvili (3‚Äì2) and Turkey's Nazmi Avluca (3‚Äì1) to secure a spot for the next round. He fell to his Finnish opponent and eventual bronze medalist Marko Yli-Hannuksela with a score 0‚Äì3 in the quarterfinals, but bounced back to forge a powerful 9‚Äì0 victory over Sweden's Ara Abrahamian for fifth place in a consolation match, a vast improvement from his previous Olympic feat. When his nation hosted the 2002 Asian Games in Busan, Kim capped off his sporting career with a golden triumph over Kazakhstan's Danil Khalimov by the delight of a massive home crowd in the men's 74 kg division, having been the last to score in a 3‚Äì3 draw.

The concept was first explored in the 1960s for use with underwater gliders, but has since been applied to autonomous aircraft as well.  Principle  Variable-buoyancy propulsion is based on the ability of a vehicle to change its buoyancy from negative to positive and vice versa (for aircraft, this means alternating between being heavier and lighter than air). While positively buoyant, the vehicle rises vertically or near-vertically; at the top of the climb, buoyancy is turned negative and the vehicle, normally fitted with hydrofoils or wings, glides forward while descending. The process can be repeated for as long as the buoyancy engine can operate, and allows for highly energy-efficient albeit generally slow propulsion. The vehicle's trajectory typically presents a sawtooth-like profile.

In November 1958, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev issued an ultimatum to the three other Allied powers to withdraw from Berlin within six months and make it a free and demilitarised city, after that access to Berlin would be controlled by East Germany. In response the United States, United Kingdom, and France stated their determination to remain in the city and maintain their legal right of free access to West Berlin. The Soviet Union withdrew the deadline before it passed in 1959 and engaged in negotiations with the other powers. The LIVE OAK staff, which was formed by the three countries during the crisis, prepared land and air plans to guarantee access to and from West Berlin. LIVE OAK was part of the contingency planning during the next Berlin Crisis of 1961, culminating in the city's de facto partition with the East German erection of the Berlin Wall.

It is a cosmic horror fantasy and secret history of the Cold War and the Watergate scandal, narrated by a fictionalized Richard Nixon. Synopsis Richard Nixon grows up on his parents‚Äô citrus farm, occasionally perceiving eerie forces and noticing strange behavior by his mother. When he grows up he returns from service in World War II and wins office against incumbent U. S. Representative Jerry Voorhis. Once in Washington Nixon works with the House Unamerican Activities Committee investigating Whittaker Chambers‚Äô accusations against U. S. State Department official Alger Hiss. While tailing Hiss, Nixon is apprehended by KGB operatives Arkady and Gregor. Through a misapplied spell, Gregor becomes possessed by a powerful supernatural entity. Both Arkady and Nixon shoot Gregor, but only wound him. Through subsequent study of Hiss‚Äôs papers, Nixon learns of a government project called Blue Ox, being run out of isolated Pawtuxet Farm in rural Massachusetts. The sponsor of Project Blue Ox, General Dwight Eisenhower, chooses Nixon as his running mate when he runs for President of the United States. Nixon witnesses Eisenhower cast a fatal curse on Josef Stalin, but Eisenhower is reluctant to pass on all the mystical secrets of the Oval Office to Nixon, and many are forgotten after Eisenhower‚Äôs 1957 stroke. Nixon withdraws from politics after losing the 1960 Presidential election to John F. Kennedy and failing in his 1962 bid for Governor of California, but he is drafted to run again for president by Henry Kissinger, in reality a millennia- old wizard. Once in office, Nixon finds himself and his country once again targeted by Gregor, who Kissinger tells him has made a deal with challenger George McGovern. It is in response to this action that the 1972 Watergate break-in is planned. Background and composition Grossman has said that he chose Nixon as the protagonist of his novel because Nixon was President when he was born, and also because he had always been regarded as a villain and a joke. When the novel was being written Grossman‚Äôs brother Lev read an outline. Critical reception Washington Post critic Ron Charles gave the book a mixed-to-positive review, saying, \\"Only when it comes to Henry Kissinger does the novel really live up to its comic potential...The scene of Kissinger ‚Äî Doctor Kissinger, please! ‚Äî showing the president his lair under the Pentagon is a delightful tip of the sorcerer‚Äôs hat to Dr. Strangelove.‚Äù Novelist Elizabeth Hand offered qualified praise in her review for the Los Angeles Times, writing, \\"The most impressive aspect of the novel is how Grossman creates a nuanced, funny and moving characterization of a man reviled during (and after) his term of office,\\" although she was more critical of the book's pacing. io9's Annalee Newitz praised Crooked alongside Linda Nagata's The Red, saying, \\"There‚Äôs a lot of sardonic humor in the retelling of Nixon‚Äôs career as a supernatural thriller, leading up to the ghoulish apocalypse of Watergate, [b]ut there‚Äôs also genuine insight into what motivates politicians, and how a lifetime spent clawing to get to the White House will drive people mad as surely as Cthulhu does.\\" io9 subsequently included Crooked on its list of the best science fiction and fantasy novels of 2015.

The organization has interviewed homeless people in over 100 cities across the United States, Canada, UK.  History  Invisible People was founded by Mark Horvath. In the early 1990s, a California resident, Horvath worked as a television distribution executive, but addiction to drugs and alcohol resulted in him becoming homeless in 1995. After eight years, he sought rehabilitation with the help of the Los Angeles Dream Center. and relocated to St. Louis, Missouri in 2005. alt=A headshot of InvisiblePeople.tv's founder, Mark Horvath During the Great Recession, Horvath lost his job, and home, and he returned to Los Angeles. Facing homelessness again, he recorded interviews with homeless people on a Flipcam and posted them on YouTube and Twitter. In November 2008, Invisible People was launched, which is registered in the United States as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.  Production  Horvath describes the organization as \\"a conversation about solutions to end homelessness\\" that \\"gives homeless people a chance to tell their own story.\\" Interviews are conducted on the subjects' sufferings filmed using a hand-held videocamera, microphone, laptop, and iPhone, and posted unedited on YouTube, Twitter and Facebook. Horvath initially interviewed subjects in California, then expanded across the United States and beyond, including Canada, Peru, and the United Kingdom. Hovarth travels worldwide to raise awareness about homelessness. Private companies provide goods to be donated to the homeless during Invisible People's road tours, as well as providing transportation and lodging for Horvath. In April 2009, Invisible People streamed live interviews with homeless people in a tent city in Sacramento, California on Twitter. After the interviews were posted, a Seattle-based company sponsored the organizations' first cross-country tour, in which Horvath traveled to over 20 cities and interviewed over 100 homeless people. The organization has also partnered with Hanes in the ten-year-old Hanes National Sock Drive raising awareness about the homeless Americans. By 2010, the organization had released interviews with over 200 homeless people. In 2011, the Canadian government commissioned Invisible People to tour 24 cities in Canada, starting on July 4 in Victoria and ending on September 12 in St. John's, including stops in Toronto and Calgary. The organization‚Äôs website received 50,000 hits per month in 2011.  Reception  According to NBC News, Horvath's interviews give the homeless a face and a voice. The interviews conducted by the non-profit have resulted in assistance being provided to the interviewed subjects. On August 22, 2010 YouTube allowed Horvath and Invisible People to curate YouTube's homepage for a day. In 2012, LA Weekly awarded Invisible People and its founder, Mark Horvath, a \\"Best Online Do-Gooder\\" award. In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the viewers raised money to buy shoes for 50 schoolchildren. In Arkansas, a farmer donated 40 acres to create a farm that feeds 150 homeless people a week. An interview with a 58-year-old homeless man dying of cancer in Calgary led to his brother finding him after 33 years of estrangement; the two were able to spend 53 days together before the man succumbed to cancer.

It is found in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean and is a parasitic castrator of the slipper limpet Crepidula cachimilla. Taxonomy When Jorge L. Fenucci originally encountered C. garthi, he first mistook it for the related (then placed in Pinnotheres). A few years later, he described the species under Pinnotheres as P. garthi (not \\"Fabia garthi\\", as cited in WoRMS). When Ernesto Campos described his new genus Calyptraeotheres for a species then still placed in Fabia, he noted that both P. politus (i.e. ) and P. garthi were also likely to belong to his new genus. He effected the transfer of these species in 1999. Description The female Calyptraeotheres garthi exhibits certain adaptations that are probably associated with its parasitic way of life. The invasive stage has a compact body shape, a hard carapace and large setae (bristles) on its swimming legs. At its next moult it loses these traits and becomes soft bodied with a rounded carapace and slender legs and claws. After several more moults it regains its hard carapace and more robust legs and claws. The male does not go through any soft-bodied stages. Distribution Calyptraeotheres garthi is native to the waters off the coast of Argentina, where its host slipper limpet lives at depths of between . Ecology Calyptraeotheres garthi is a parasitic castrator: it inhabits the brood chamber of the slipper limpet Crepidula cachimilla. Its host is a filter feeder, filtering phytoplankton from the water with the help of a string of mucus round the edges of its gills, and it is this green, plankton-laden mucus that the pea crab eats. The presence of the pea crab reduces the amount of food available to the slipper limpet. While the crab is present, the slipper limpet does not breed, and is effectively castrated. On removal of the pea crab, breeding in the slipper limpet resumes. It is unclear whether the cessation of breeding in the presence of the crab is due to a reduction in nutrients available to the slipper limpet, or to some other mechanism such as \\"steric interference\\" where castration occurs because the parasite physically prevents host reproduction in some way. The life cycle of this crab has been studied, and involves five zoeal larval stages and one postlarval stage, all of which are free-living. The infective stage is probably the first instar juvenile.

She then, studied at UBC-Okanangan, where she received her Master's Degree in Sociology in 2004. She received her Doctorate of Social Justice Education from the University of Toronto in 2014. While studying at UBC-Okanaagan, Bourgeois became involved with activism relating to missing and murdered indigenous women and human trafficking.  Career  Bourgeois is an assistant professor at the Centre for Women's and Gender studies at Brock University in St. Catharines, Ontario, Canada. Her scholarly work at the university includes Indigenous feminism, violence against Indigenous women and girls, Canadian colonial history and governance, as well as Indigenous women's political activism and leadership. Her work has been published in the Canadian Journal of Women and the Law, Canadian Women Studies, and UCLA Law Review. In 2014, Bourgeois was critical of the RCMP's National Operational Review on missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada, arguing that it misses a number of issues including colonialism, racism, and police accountability as causes of the violence epidemic affecting Indigenous women and girls. In October 2018, Bourgeois testified for the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls, which was established in September 2016 by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. The National Inquiry looks into potential causes of violence against Indigenous women and girls in Canada. Bourgeois has criticized government inquiries in the past, stating that the initiative allows ‚Äúthe Canadian state to appear that it is doing something without ever having to actually do anything,‚Äù but decided to contribute in order to ‚Äúspeak for other trafficked and exploited women.\\" During her talk, she discussed her own experience as a sexual assault survivor and the impact of settler colonialism on people's perception of Indigenous women. Bourgeois cited Disney's Pocahontas and Peter Pan's Tiger Lilly as examples, with each showcasing Indigenous women as sexual object that are prone to settler violence. In 2019, Robyn Bourgeois was featured in the documentary, Daughters, directed by Riayn Spaero. The film discusses sex trafficking, murder, and sex assault facing Indigenous women in the United States and Canada.

History The Women's Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC) was established in May, 1942, and began recruiting women with a 10% quota for black women. The WAAC was made part of the regular Army and redesignated Women's Army Corps (WAC) in July, 1943. At Fort Des Moines, the first WAAC Training Center and Officer Candidate School, the barracks, service clubs, and mess halls were segregated, as was the service band. When the black women at Fort Des Moines were not allowed to join the all-white WAC Band (which became the 400th Armed Service Forces Band), they organized WAC Band #2. Most of the women lacked previous band experience and had limited musical training or experience. Off-duty, they took music classes at Drake University, as the Army would not send them to Army Music School. In addition, the women in WAC Band #2 were given private lessons on their instruments by some members of the all white 400th Army Forces Band. After regular and frequent rehearsals, the women assigned to the band provided concerts on base, and performed in the 1944 Memorial Day Parade in Des Moines. The two women's bands coordinated their schedules, so that a band was always available on base. WAC Band #2 was deactivated in July, 1944, when the War Department decided that there were too many bands on some posts. A massive letter-writing campaign began protesting the deactivation of band, both from individuals, such as Mary McLeod Bethune, and organizations such as the National Council of Negro Women, the Racial Justice Committee of the Des Moines Interracial Commission, and Local 208 of the Musicians' Protective Union. The post commander recognized the blow to morale among black troops caused by the deactivation of the band, and recommended that the band be retained. As a result of the public protest and the commander's recommendation, the band was reactivated in September, 1944 as the 404th ASF Band. In addition to concerts on base, the band performed throughout the Midwest, appearing at bond drives and recruiting rallies. They were invited to perform at the Thirty-fourth Annual Conference of the NAACP in Chicago, and were credited with helping to sell over $450,000 of war bonds at the event. The 404th ASF Band was also part of the Mighty Seventh War Bond Drive in Chicago, May through June 1945, which brought in over $26 billion for the war. The 404th ASF Band became the 404th Army Band before the end of the war, and was deactivated permanently in December, 1945.

In 2014, the federal and provincial governments approved the construction of the B.C. Hydro Site C hydroelectric dam project, upsetting the people of the Prophet River and West Moberly First Nations, as it seems the dam will threaten three of the largest rivers in the Peace River territory: the Peace, Moberly, and Halfway Rivers. In an attempt to halt the Site C dam project, Knott, elders, youth, and Treaty 8 members caravanned to Montreal, where the West Moberly and Prophet River First Nations appealed the government's decision to begin construction on the dam. The construction of Site C violated the previously established Treaty 8, which states the First Nations could continue their traditional practices of hunting, trapping, fishing, and collecting medicinal plants \\"for as long as the sun shines, the rivers flow and the grass grows.\\" Against the wishes of the Treaty 8 Caravan, logging and land clearing for the dam began in 2015. The dam is proposed to be 60-meters high and 1,050-meters- long on the Peace River between the communities of Hudson's Hope and Taylor on Treaty 8 territory. It is planned to be operational in 2024.

Laird of a minor estate in Aberdeenshire, he fought in several successive Jacobite risings. Following the failure of the 1745 rising, in which he served with the rank of Major-General, he escaped to Norway before settling in France, where he died in 1750. Despite a reputation in later popular history as ‚Äúone of the most romantic of Jacobite heroes‚Äù,Tayler, Henrietta. ‚ÄúJohn Gordon of Glenbucket‚Äù, Scottish Historical Review, (1948) v27, 10, p.165 Glenbucket was a controversial figure who acted as a government agent between 1715 and 1745, and was accused of forcibly conscripting men during the 1745 rising. Early life The castle of Glenbucket (now spelt Glenbuchat). John Gordon's family purchased the estate in 1701. Glenbucket was born in 1673 into an obscure junior branch of the Gordon family; his grandfather, George, had held the tack of Noth. His father, John Gordon of Knockespock (c.1654-1704) purchased the small estate of Glenbucket, near Kildrummy on the border of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire, in 1701 from another branch of the Gordons.German, Kieran. John Gordon of Glenbucket, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography At the age of sixteen Glenbucket supposedly fought on the Jacobite side at Killiecrankie;Lenman, Bruce. (1980) The Jacobite Risings in Britain, Methuen, p.233 the battle was a Jacobite victory but their commander, John Graham of Claverhouse, was killed in its closing minutes and the rising later collapsed. Little else is known of his early life other than that he attended King's College, Aberdeen at the same time as Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat. 1715 rising Sheriffmuir, 1715. Glenbucket commanded a battalion of the Marquess of Huntly's forces at the battle. The 1715 Jacobite rising was sparked by the power struggle between the Whig and Tory factions of Parliament in the wake of Queen Anne's death: it was initiated by the Tory Earl of Mar, without the approval of the Jacobite claimant James Stuart, after George I deprived him of his offices. Glenbucket served as bailie to the Marquess of Huntly, later 2nd Duke of Gordon, which included an obligation to provide military service. When Huntly joined the Rising, Glenbucket raised men in Strathbogie and commanded one of the two Gordon battalions at the inconclusive Battle of Sheriffmuir.Reid, Stuart. (2014) Sheriffmuir 1715, Casemate, p.160 Following the collapse of the Rising, Glenbucket and his men surrendered to his neighbour Ludovick Grant at Strathbogie on 6 March 1716 and Huntly intervened on his behalf, suggesting his local influence could be of use to the government. Grant passed this recommendation onto the government commander William Cadogan, who told Glenbucket that rebels must be imprisoned but treated him ‚Äúmost civilie‚Äù.Tayler, (1948), p.168 Initially held in Edinburgh Castle, Glenbucket's preferential treatment there led to a complaint by the Lord Justice Clerk; he was moved to Carlisle and released without being charged in late 1716.Tayler (1948), p.169 The new commander in Scotland, Lieutenant-General Carpenter, reported he expressed \\"the highest gratitude and loyalty, protesting he will employ his whole life to do his Majesty and the Government the best service he can\\".Tayler (1948), p.171 As bailie for the Gordon estates, Glenbucket gained considerable influence over large areas of Aberdeenshire and Banffshire and both Jacobites and the government sought his backing during the 1719 rising. Its centrepiece was a proposed Spanish landing in South-West England but only the subsidiary rising in Scotland actually took place. The Jacobite Lord Tullibardine wrote to Glenbucket on 15 April 1719 urging him to join but he refused, instead providing Carpenter with regular reports on rebel activities.Tayler (1948) p.172 The attempt ended with Jacobite defeat at Glen Shiel in June. Bailies were rarely popular with all tenants and in March 1724, Glenbucket was seriously wounded by men from Clan Macpherson. He fought them off but Huntly, now Duke of Gordon, sent a large party of armed men into the district and since Lachlan Macpherson (1673-1746) was also a Jacobite sympathiser, both sides sought support from the exiles. In a letter to George Keith, Macpherson claimed Glenbucket was \\"a person capable of executing anything, however desperate\\", while James wrote to Gordon expressing concern at the attack on \\"honest Glenbucket\\", but advised caution in punishing the Macphersons as \\"you would be sorry to deprive me and the good cause of so many brave men\\".Glover (ed). (1847) The Stuart Papers. Printed from the Originals in the Possession of Her Majesty the Queen, v.1, Wright, pp.100-105 Attempts by Gordon to bring the perpetrators to justice were still ongoing in 1728. Further Jacobite activity James Stuart, ca 1741; he had little interest in Glenbucket's proposed rising Around this time, Glenbucket began regular contact with the Stuart exiles; this was hardly unusual and many Scots and English peers did the same, as an insurance policy. One factor may have been the death in 1728 of the Catholic 2nd Duke of Gordon, who was succeeded by his Protestant son, Cosmo 3rd Duke of Gordon; using Glenbucket to indirectly maintain links with the exiled Stuarts provided distance. It also coincided with an improvement in Jacobite prospects for the first time in over two decades, as French and Spanish statesmen looked for ways to reduce the expansion of British commercial strength. Glenbucket proposed a rising in Scotland, supported by French regulars from the Irish Brigades, arguing this could successfully resist the small number of government troops stationed there. He sold his estate in 1737, using the proceeds to finance a trip to Europe; in January 1738, he met with James, then living quietly in Rome having ‚Äúabandoned all hope of a Restoration‚Äù.Blaikie, Walter (1916) Origins of the Forty-Five, Scottish History Society, xlix-li James listened and gave him a Major-General‚Äôs commission but remained unconvinced.Tayler (1948), p.173 Glenbucket then went to Paris and presented his plan to Cardinal Fleury, chief French minister from 1723 to 1743, who gave him a hearing but nothing else; like the vast majority of French statesmen, he viewed the Jacobites as unreliable fantasists. Scepticism in Paris and Rome was mirrored by that within the Scottish Jacobite community, which remained riven by divisions going back to 1688. As a member of the minority Catholic faction, there was little support for Glenbucket's plan: John Murray of Broughton, appointed principal Jacobite agent in 1741, later characterised him as ‚Äúa man of no property nor natural following, of very mean understanding, with a vast deal of vanity‚Äù.Blaikie (1916), li Several prominent Jacobites sent a letter to Fleury in 1740 pledging their support, including Donald Cameron of Lochiel and the Duke of Perth, but Glenbucket was not a signatory. When Fleury died in 1743, Louis XV of France took over government; he planned an invasion of England in early 1744 to restore the Stuarts and to avoid incriminating Gordon in his pro-Jacobite activities, Glenbucket resigned as his factor in March 1744. Shortly after this, the plan was abandoned when winter storms scattered and sank the French invasion fleet but the Stuart heir Charles Edward continued to plan an expedition to Scotland in the summer of 1745. He relied on promises of support from a small number of clan chiefs in the western Highlands but ignored their stipulation this was conditional he provided French troops, money and weapons; without these, most Scottish Jacobites, including Murray of Broughton, attempted to dissuade him. 1745 rising Charles landed in Scotland in late July 1745, accompanied only by seven companions. Most of those he contacted advised him to return, but Lochiel and a few other influential figures were persuaded, providing Charles with the nucleus of the Jacobite army. The government seems to have believed that Glenbucket would not join Charles: ‚ÄúI have some confidence in my old friend Glenbucket‚Äôs prudence and temper,‚Äù wrote Lord President Forbes on 14 August, though by September Sir Harie Innes commented ‚Äúwe are in perpetual alarm for Glenbucket ‚Äì he took some of the Duke of Gordon‚Äôs horses this morning‚Äù. In fact, he was the first of the eastern lairds to join the rising, having been present at Glenfinnan on 19 August when Charles raised his standard.Grant, Charles. ‚ÄúGlenbucket‚Äôs Regiment of Foot‚Äù in Journal of the Society for Army Historical Researc, v.28, 113 (Spring 1950), p.31 Returning to Banffshire with a small party of Highlanders, he began raising men in Glenlivet, allegedly by threatening them ‚Äúwith being plundered if they did not join‚Äù.Grant (1950) p.32 He continued recruiting across Banffshire and by mid September his unit had grown to regimental size, around 300 strong, though Forbes commented that his men ‚Äúdesert him daily‚Äù. By the time he joined the main Jacobite force at Edinburgh on 4 October, he had about 400 men.Grant (1950) p.34 thumbrightBinhall, Aberdeenshire. In 1745 Glenbucket was accused of conscripting Charles Gordon of Binhall by force despite his father's offer to pay, saying he wanted \\"men, not money\\".Grant (1950) p.33 Despite being well into his seventies, and despite being reported dead in October,Tayler (1948) p.174 Glenbucket played an active role in the campaign. Though Lord George Murray described him as ‚Äúvery infirm‚Äù, Sir John MacDonald claimed that he was ‚Äúthe only Scot I ever knew who was able to start at the hour fixed, he was also the most active.‚ÄùGrant (1950) p.41 Glenbucket‚Äôs regiment joined the Jacobite invasion of England in November 1745, marching as part of Perth‚Äôs division. The Jacobites marched rapidly as far as Derby, but against Charles's wishes then decided to retreat to Scotland as there was no sign of the English support or the French invasion force Charles had promised. The retreat was conducted successfully; Lord George Murray later recorded Glenbucket was present at the rearguard action at Clifton on 18 December. About 50 of Glenbucket‚Äôs men were left with the garrison of Carlisle, under captains George Abernethy and Alexander Leith; after a short siege the garrison surrendered to the government army on 30 December.Grant (1950) p.36 In January 1746 the Jacobites besieged Stirling Castle. Glenbucket commanded the blockading troops until the Battle of Falkirk Muir, fought against a government relief force on 15 January, after which he was replaced by the Duke of Perth. The siege was abandoned shortly afterwards and in February, while his regiment marched northwards through Aberdeenshire, Glenbucket and a party of Highlanders besieged Ruthven Barracks.Grant (1950) p.38 Towards the end of February he was reported to be back with his regiment and recruiting in a remote area around Glenlivet and Strathdon. Increasingly short of money and supplies the Jacobites withdrew to Inverness. When the government army advanced from Aberdeen on 8 April, the Jacobite leadership were mostly in favour of standing and fighting, but in the ensuing Battle of Culloden on 16 April they were comprehensively defeated. Glenbucket and his regiment were initially positioned in the second line; some authors have suggested that they retreated in good order to Badenoch and disbanded there, but given that they were not far from their own country they are more likely to have simply dispersed after the battle.Grant (1950) p.40 Glenbucket himself escaped; In June he was again reported ‚Äúdead lately in the hills of Glenavon‚Äù but was able to leave Scotland in November on a Swedish ship. After some time in Norway he made his way to the Jacobite exile community in Paris, where he complained of living in poverty despite receiving a small number of ‚Äògratification‚Äô payments from the French. He requested accommodation in the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Germain- en-Laye, but this was refused; he died in 1750 at Boulogne. Family and legacy Glenbucket was married to Jean Forbes. He had a number of children, several of whom were officers in his regiment; the eldest, John, was involved in the 1745 rising along with his own eldest son William and was taken prisoner, though later claimed to be almost completely blind; he was released in 1747. His second son David Gordon of Kirkhill, described by one observer as \\"an insignificant creature\\",Blaikie (1916), p.114 accompanied him during his recruiting efforts but died in March 1746. The third, George Gordon, was taken prisoner, later escaping and travelling to Jamaica where he became a physician. Another son, Alexander, obtained a post in the Imperial Russian Navy through the influence of Admiral Thomas Gordon; he was killed in action in 1739. Glenbucket had cultivated his connections with other Jacobite families, particularly in the Highlands: a contemporary commented he was \\"the only instance of a Gentleman of a low country family and education, that both could and would so thoroughly conform himself to the Highland spirit and manners, as to be able to procure a following among them without a Highland estate\\".Blaikie (1916) p.115 One of his daughters, Helen, married John Macdonell, 12th chief of Glengarry; another daughter Isabel married Donald Macdonell of Lochgarry, colonel of Glengarry's regiment in 1745. His long service as a Jacobite rebel meant that \\"Old Glenbucket\\" was a central figure in the romanticised popular history of Jacobitism; a popular though unlikely story is that he used to give King George II nightmares.Barclay, W. Cambridge County Geographies: Banffshire, Cambridge UP, p.80 A more balanced assessment of his career reveals \\"a very brave man but perhaps [...] a little too 'canny'\\".Tayler (1948) p.175 References Sources   1673 births 1750 deaths Scottish generals Scottish Jacobites People of the Jacobite rising of 1715 People of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Alumni of the University of Aberdeen ","title":"John Gordon of Glenbucket"},{"id":"60571427","text":"Wilfried Colling (born 12 December 1959) is a German wrestler.

The deaths of four miners were confirmed, along with the later deaths of two rescue workers.  Collapse  At 23:30 MMT, a mud-filled pond at a jade mine in Hpakant collapsed. The mud and tailings in the pond buried miners below it in up to 30.5 metres of mud. At the time, the miners were asleep in their residences, which were located below the mine.  Rescue efforts  Rescue efforts were started on 23 April, the morning after the collapse. The efforts were coordinated by the local government and welfare organizations. According to Tin Soe, a politician representing the area, removing the mud \\"could cost millions of dollars.\\" Four bodies were recovered. The search for more miners was cancelled on 26 April, after another landslide killed two of the rescue workers.  Reactions  In response to the collapse, the acting UN Resident Coordinator to Myanmar called on the country to implement new safety legislation to protect mine workers. The natural resource minister of Kachin said that he would take action against mining companies involved in the incident, and said that he wanted mining companies to work to improve the safety of their mines. The Myanmar central government suspended operations in seventeen mine blocks in Hapakant, affecting eleven companies.
