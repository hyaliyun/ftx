The thriller features three leading players from the previous year's Dracula (Lugosi, Manners, and Edward Van Sloan), and was the first film directed by Edwin L. Marin. The film was produced by KBS Productions at Tiffany Pictures and released by Sono Art-World Wide Pictures. The film is currently in the public domain. Plot During the filming of a death scene of The Death Kiss, leading man Myles Brent is really shot and killed. Tonart Studios manager Joseph Steiner (Lugosi) is assigned to handle the situation. The studio wants to pass it off as a simple accident, but screenwriter Franklyn Drew (Manners) digs a bullet out of a wall and tells Homicide Detective Lieutenant Sheehan that it is a .38 caliber, while the guns used in the film are all .45s. Sheehan finds a letter in the dead man's pocket, in which Brent wrote to his lawyer that Marcia Lane (Ames), his co- star and ex-wife, would not sign a release as beneficiary of his $200,000 life insurance policy. Chalmers, an alcoholic extra with a self-admitted grudge against Brent for getting him fired as head gaffer (electrician), is spotted trying to dispose of a loaded .38, but Drew points out that the gun has not been fired. Drew suggests they view the footage of the fatal scene for clues, but somebody knocks out the projectionist and burns the print using a cigarette with rouge on it. It is a special rouge normally used by only two women. One was away on location, making Lane the prime suspect. Before another print can be made, the negative is destroyed with acid. While snooping around on the set, Drew finds a derringer mounted inside a lamp and electrically wired to be fired remotely, but he is knocked out and the gun taken. He goes to question Chalmers, but finds him dead beside a glass of poison and a written confession. However, Drew finds several clues that make him suspicious. Through more detective work, he discovers that the new battery of Lane's car is dry, and battery fluid is poisonous. Meanwhile, Goldsmith comes to see Lane; she rejects his advances once again. In Brent's dressing room, Drew finds a letter from a love-stricken married woman named \\"Agnes\\" and a hotel room key. Later, in Steiner's office, Sheehan takes Lane into custody; Drew spots a photo of a woman on the desk; the inscription reveals that Steiner's wife is named Agnes. When Drew goes to the hotel, he finds out from a bellhop that Brent had been there with a woman; her husband was waiting, and the two men got into a fight. The studio decides to finish the film (only the last, fatal scene needs to be shot), using a double for Brent and arranging for Lane's temporary release. Drew finds out from the prop man that the guns were originally supposed to be .38s, but he made an unauthorized substitution. Drew takes him to Sheehan. Just as he is about to reveal who ordered the guns, the lights go out. (The murderer had overheard the conversation through a studio microphone.) After a gunfight and chase, the killer falls to his death. It is Avery, the director.

Rinus started out in the band Lemming as the bass player and sound mixer. He chose bass because he liked the low sound. In 1977, he met up with Laurens Bakker and with various musicians, started Picture. By 1979, Jan Bechtum and Ronald van Prooijen had joined the band for their first stable (and the classic) lineup. Throughout various lineup changes, he carried the torch and kept Picture going until the final breakup. He felt there was still some life left in the band but with so many personnel changes and the changing music scene, he had to let it go. Rinus' influences included Pink Floyd, Jimi Hendrix, Deep Purple, and Frank Zappa. He used a Gibson Firebird bass and Sound City, Dynacord and later on, Peavey amps. Recently (late 2007), Rinus and the original members of Picture, with Ronald van Prooijen, teamed up for a reunion rehearsal. It went so well that they decided to continue rehearsing for some concert dates, and considered recording a new album in early 2008 with Shmoulik Avigal from the Diamond Dreamer lineup as their singer. As of mid-2008, a permanent lineup was established with Rinus, Jan Bechtum, Laurens Bakker, Rob vanEnkhuizen, and Pete Lovell. They are currently playing throughout Europe to very enthusiastic crowds. A limited edition live album was recorded at various venues and was released by the band. Plans are to go into the studio in early 2009 to record a new CD with new songs, two of which appeared on the limited edition CD.

It is about 2.5 miles (4 km) north of the town of Ringwood. It is in the civil parish of Ellingham, Harbridge and Ibsley. Overview The village of Ibsley lies to the east of the River Avon on the main road between Ringwood and Fordingbridge, and has some picturesque thatched cottages.Hampshire Treasures Volume 5 (New Forest) Page 103 To the southeast is a series of lakes known collectively as Blashford Lakes, which have been created as the result of sand and gravel extraction since the 1950s.Blashford Lakes , Hampshire & Isle of Wight Wildlife Trust Ibsley was a civil parish until 1974, when the parish was amalgamated with the parishes of Ellingham and Harbridge. The hamlets of South Gorley, Furze Hill, and Mockbeggar were all part of Ibsley parish. History Ibsley is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 when it was held by a certain Ralph from Hugh de Port. The name of the settlement at that time was Tibeslei and it means \\"Tibb(i)'s wood/clearing\\".Ibsley, Old Hampshire Gazetteer In the 14th century Ibsley was split into two moieties divided between John atte Bere and William de Melbury.Ibsley - Victoria County History of Hampshire That part which John atte Bere had owned was by the end of the 14th century in the possession of William Stourton. His son John, who later became the 1st Baron Stourton, inherited the estate in 1414. It then descended with the Baron Stourtons, until William Stourton, 7th Baron Stourton sold the manor in 1544 to Robert White, from whom it descended with Rockford in Ellingham to the Beconshaws and Lisles. In the 19th century it was sold to the second Earl of Normanton, and became annexed to the Somerley estate. That part which William de Melbury had owned had by the 16th century passed to the Berkley family. John Berkeley sold the manor to William Batten in 1556. It was sold to Jeremiah Cray in 1697. It stayed with the Cray family in the 18th century, but by the 19th century it was joined to the other manor, and also became part of the Somerley estate. The church of Saint Martin was rebuilt in 1832, replacing an earlier 17th- century church.Church of Saint Martin - Pastscape It is of brick with some stone dressings. It is now deconsecrated and was in use as an art gallery as of 2008. RAF Ibsley Derelict control tower overlooking the lakes near Ibsley RAF Ibsley was a World War II airfield near Ibsley. It was opened in 1941, and it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the war it was used primarily as a fighter airfield. After the war it was closed in 1947. The airfield appeared in the wartime propaganda film The First of the Few as the main wartime base in the production. Most of the airfield has since been quarried away by gravel extraction, and much of the site is covered by the Blashford Lakes nature reserve. One lake is overlooked by the derelict, windowless control tower with other remnants scattered around the nearby countryside.

It is located about north-west of Bury St Edmunds, south-east of Mildenhall and south-west of Thetford in Norfolk. The village is on the A1101 road between Bury St Edmunds and Mildenhall in the north-west of the county. The area around the village, characterised by a sandy gravel-laden soil, is known as Breckland, though an arm of the fen-like peat follows the River Lark past the village. The village straddles the River Lark, a tributary to the Great Ouse. It was once navigable up to Bury St Edmunds, with locks installed; these are now redundant, the remains of at least one lock being visible near Icklingham. The river is the reason for the siting of Icklingham's most prominent industry, the local flour mill. There are two churches in the village: St. James, and All Saints Church, Icklingham, which is of Norman in origin and a Grade I listed building. The village is characterised by flint and pale brick cottages. There were two thriving public houses, including the magnificent thatched Red Lion, in the village, but they both closed. However, in October 2019, the Red Lion was re-opened as the Guinness Arms. A village shop no longer exists, and the village hall, the former School House, is now in private hands. The village contains 11 listed buildings.https://britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/england/icklingham-forest- heath-suffolk History The village may take its name from an Iron Age tribe, the Iceni, who lived in the area and there are the remains of a Roman settlement to the south-east; alternatively Old English Iclingaham \\"home of the Iclingas\\" appears to derive from the royal house descended from Icel of Angeln, which would give rise to kings of both East Anglia and Mercia. Icklingham has a Roman Christian graveyard, and a lead receptacle, reputed to be a baptismal font, was found on the same site. It is now located in the British Museum. It was also one of the largest Anglo-Saxon settlements in the area and can demonstrate nearby occupation to Neolithic times, through research carried out by Liverpool University over many years. The Black Ditches boundary ditch runs to the south of the village and is believed to be the most easterly of a series of early Anglo-Saxon defensive earthworks built across the Icknield Way. From 1808 to 1814 Icklingham was the site of a station in the shutter telegraph chain which connected the Admiralty in London to its naval ships in the port of Great Yarmouth. It has been said that on a clear day, a message could reach Great Yarmouth from The Admiralty in London, and receive a reply, in little more than 15 minutes. The horse-borne messenger would take three days at best. Natural environment Icklingham is within the area known as Breckland, an area of sandy heaths and forests. This area has a number of important natural habitats, including for the protected stone curlew. The village is surrounded by the Breckland Farmland Site of Special Scientific Interest and close to the Breckland Forest SSSI, both of which cover large area of Breckland and are two of the largest SSSI areas in England. The Icknield Way Path passes through the village on its 110-mile journey from Ivinghoe Beacon in Buckinghamshire to Knettishall Heath in Suffolk. The Icknield Way Trail, a multi-user route for walkers, horse riders and off-road cyclists also passes through the village. A number of smaller SSSI areas are found in the Icklingham area.

Its name is first documented in the thirteenth century, as 'Ikewelle'.

The parish includes the hamlets of Bould and Foscot. The 2011 Census recorded the parish's population as 240. Archaeology About west of the village is a hillfort, Idbury Camp. It was used in the Iron Age, Roman occupation and Saxon era, and possibly earlier. The village's toponym is derived from the Old English for \\"Ida's burh\\", further attesting to the fort's continued use in the Saxon era. The remains of its rampart are about wide, up to high and enclose an area of about . The fort is a scheduled monument. Parish church The Church of England parish church of St Nicholas was originally Norman, but little survives from this period except the ornate north doorway. Early in the 14th century the bell-turret, north aisle, south porch and south doorway were added, new windows were inserted in the chancel and the chancel arch was altered. The east window is Decorated Gothic. The bell tower was added shortly afterwards. Later a clerestory was added to the nave and other windows were added to the nave and north aisle, all of them Perpendicular Gothic. The church is a Grade I listed building. The tower has three bells, two of which are medieval. The second and tenor bells were cast in about 1420 by an unknown bellfounder, and the treble was cast in 1749 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester. There is also a Sanctus bell that was cast in about 1320 and hangs in a bellcote on the gable end of the nave above the chancel arch. The tower also has an early turret clock of a type that is unusual for this part of England. It has a wooden frame more characteristic of the Midlands. Early in the 18th century the clock was modified with the addition of a new escapement of unusual design, but the clock itself is considerably older. St Nicholas' parish is part of the Benefice of Shipton-under-Wychwood with Milton-under- Wychwood, Fifield and Idbury. Social history Idbury had a Church of England school from 1845 until 1966.

The settlement has ancient origins and is listed in the Domesday Book. The village lies on the B3217 road, roughly central in its parish of around 2,900 acres, about eight miles north of the town of Okehampton. Iddesleigh has been described as an attractive small village, with good views of Dartmoor to the south. Its church is a grade I listed building and there are a number of other listed buildings in the parish. Toponymy and early history The name Iddesleigh derives from the Old English personal name, ƒíadwƒ´ƒ° (or perhaps ƒíadwulf), and lƒìah, a wood or clearing. The first documentary evidence of the settlement appears in the Domesday Book (1086), where it is referred to twice, as Edeslege and as Iweslei. By the 13th century its name was recorded as Edulvesly and in 1428 as Yeddeslegh. Domesday Book shows that in 1086 the majority of the manor of Iddesleigh (under the name of Edeslege) was owned directly by the king, but a small part of it (one virgate recorded as Iweslei) was held from the king by William of Claville. The pre-conquest owner of this land is unclear: two women's names ‚Äì Alware Pet and Aelfeva Thief ‚Äì are recorded. The overlord is recorded as Brictric son of Algar. Edeslege is discussed on page 1,63 and Iweslei on page 24,22. By the 13th century the lands had passed to the de Reigny family as part of the honour of Gloucester. Geography The village is three miles north-east of Hatherleigh and eight miles north of Okehampton. It is roughly in the centre of its parish, on the B3217 road that runs from Okehampton to Atherington, near the A377. The parish, which covers about 2,900 acres on the Culm Measures, has its southern border along the River Okement and its western along the River Torridge. Clockwise from the north, it is bordered by the parishes of Dowland, Winkleigh, Broadwoodkelly, Monkokehampton, Hatherleigh and Meeth. In 2001, the population of the parish was 198, down from 335 in 1901, and 441 in 1801. The village The landscape historian W. G. Hoskins, writing in 1953, described the village as \\"an excellent example of a cob and thatch village, most attractive to explore\\", and in 1973 S. H. Burton wrote that it gave the appearance of being \\"thatchier\\" than anywhere else in Devon. Situated on a south-facing slope, the village has good views of northern Dartmoor, including its highest point, High Willhays. The Church of St James, the parish church, is at the western edge of the village, and is a grade I listed building. With 13th-century origins, but mostly dating from the 15th century, it has wagon roofs in its nave and north aisle. A recumbent effigy of a knight with a plain shield, lying under an arch has been dated to and is believed to be of a squire of Iddesleigh, a member of the locally-notable Sully family. The church was partly rebuilt in 1720 with further work in the early 19th century, followed by restoration by Charles S. Adye in 1878‚Äì9. The listed village pub, the \\"Duke of York\\", is made of cob and thatch, and is slightly hidden from the main road being along a side street behind some terraced cottages. Its facade was used in the BBC television series Down to Earth, broadcast in 2000. It was in this pub that Michael Morpurgo says he talked to an old soldier with first- hand knowledge of the use of horses in the First World War which became the basis for his 1982 novel War Horse., the village was also used as inspiration for the Michael Morpurgo novel, Private Peaceful. Landmarks Ash House, a grade II listed building in the south of the parish, was the seat of the Mallet family from 1530 to 1881. It was later bought by the founders of the Rare Breeds Survival Trust. There has been a settlement at Barwick, in the south-east corner of the parish, since at least the early 15th century: a document dated 1440 refers to it as Berewyke. There are two listed buildings here. Little Barwick is a late 15th-century building with 17th-century and later alterations‚Äîits most notable feature is its medieval full cruck trusses, unusual in Devon. South Barwick Farmhouse dates from the first part of the 17th century. Barwick had a stud farm breeding shire horses before World War I. The \\"Barwick Madam\\" was noted in the local shire horse stud book.Shire Horse Stud Book Shire Horse Society ‚Äì Volume 26 1905 ‚Äì Page 200 \\"BARWICK MADAM\\".. Jonas B.

In 1885, when Sir Stafford Northcote was raised to the peerage, he took the title of Earl of Iddesleigh, which was, according to W. G. Hoskins, a curious choice since his main estates were not here. He did, however, own some 2,000 acres of the parish. The Scottish-born poet, Se√°n Rafferty lived in the parish from 1948 until his death in December 1993; he was landlord of the Duke of York pub until 1975. Rafferty was a friend of author Michael Morpurgo, who has lived in Iddesleigh since the 1970s. In his book Private Peaceful, the village is the home of the protagonist, Tommo, and it is one of the main settings for the book. In 1976 Morpurgo and his wife, Clare, set up the Farms for City Children charity which is based at Nethercott House in the parish. Poet Ted Hughes who lived nearby was a close friend and regular visitor to the Morpurgos and became the first president of the charity.

It served as an annex to the Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot. History =Beginnings= The land for the Annex was bought by the U.S. Navy in 1941, from local landowners, to expand the nearby Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot, in Hingham. The Depot was the main ammunition supplier for Naval Forces of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, during World War II, employing 2,091 civilians along with 721 naval officers and sailors and 375 Marine guards at its peak in June, 1945. A rail spur, sided off the Old Colony Greenbush Line, was built to facilitate the transfer of ammunition, stored in cement bunkers at the Annex, to the Depot at the Hingham Shipyard. =Reactivation= Reverted to maintenance status after the War, the Annex was reactivated for the Korean War, during which time it held some of the Navy's first experimental nuclear depth charges, in bunker N9. Depth charges, bombs, and rocket motors were assembled at the Annex until declared surplus, by the Navy, in 1962. =Post-Closure Usage= The Commonwealth of Massachusetts took possession of the Annex, in 1966, and later turned the into the present day Wompatuck State Park. The last military activity at the Annex took place when the U.S. Army Reserve 187th Infantry Brigade was stationed at United States Army Reserve Center Hingham from 1971 to 1982. In the late 1990s the government, who were in charge of the remaining section of the Depot that was not turned into Wompatuck, announced they were going to donate the remaining part to the park. This involved, first, cleaning the area, featuring the demolition of the remaining buildings, despite their historical value. This task was completed in the Spring of 2015, with the former building sites having been razed and covered with earth and new hiking and biking trails established, roadways refinished as walking and biking trails and access improved via the former rail bed, connecting to Route 3A in Cohasset near the Greenbush rail line. Gates have been created at the end of Leavitt St. in Hingham and from the Doane St. path from Cohasset. Bunkers here, as well as those in the remains of the original Hingham Naval Ammunition Depot in what is now Bare Cove Park, had been used as shelter by homeless persons. Following the grisly murder of two homeless men in Bare Cove in 2005, the remaining bunkers in the park have been demolished. However, local Boy Scouts have worked to preserve some of these bunkers, including N9, as a memorial to the military and civilian personnel who served at the Depot.

He is chiefly remembered for his works on horse racing and for a translation of Fran√ßois Guizot's Popular History of France, his most successful work. Life and education Black was born on 14 May 1829 in London, England, the second son of Robert Black, a clerk of the same city. He matriculated from Christ's Hospital in 1848, and was admitted to Pembroke College at Cambridge University on 24 June 1848 at the age of 19. He took his B.A. in 1852 and M.A. in 1856. During his last years he lived a life of seclusion in London, where he died on 8 April 1915. Career Cover of the second edition of Love or Lucre, George Routledge and Sons, 1879 Black commenced his writing career as a classical scholar who produced articles on current affairs and the Italian Renaissance, and translations of French works. His translation of Guizot went through numerous editions in England and America. He started contributing fiction to such periodicals as the Cornhill Magazine, Macmillan's Magazine and Chambers' Journal in the 1860s. His work also appeared in the Athenaeum and The Field. Black's early short stories were gathered into two collections, after which he attempted a novel, Love or Lucre, published by Richard Bentley & Son in 1878. A protracted dispute over Bentley's editorial practices appears to have soured him on fiction, and though another short story collection and novel were projected nothing came of these efforts. Black later achieved some success as an authority on horse racing, contributing articles on the subject to the St. James Gazette, the Pall Mall Gazette, The Times, and The Sportsman, and three books, the third of which was again published by Bentley.

It is part of Brimpton Parish, and part of the Benefice of Aldermaston and Woolhampton in the Diocese of Oxford. It is in the Aldermaston Ward of West Berkshire Council. Housing It has a population of just under 150. The majority of the housing stock is detached with generous size plots. There is a mixture of late 19th century estate and farm-workers' homes (some terraced or semi-detached), plus a post-war ribbon development of larger homes along Brimpton Lane, The Byway and Kingsclere Road. History Brimpton Common is the most westerly of a series of former medieval ‚Äúcommons‚Äù to the south of three rivers between Newbury and Reading: River Enborne, River Kennet and River Thames, the other commons being Tadley Common, Silchester Common, Mortimer Common, Wokefield Common and Burghfield Common. Geology The commons are flat land about 100 metres above sea level and the highest land between the watercourses to north and south. They are the remains of a marine sedimentation laid down in Tertiary times, subsequently raised by the uplift of the land in later geological times. A layer of clay between 0.5 and 1.0 metres thick provided an acidic topsoil on which the native vegetation was pine, heather and associated species. Below this was a bed of gravel, up to 3 metres deep. All of the exploitable gravel in Brimpton Common has now been extracted and the land has been restored to a mixture of agricultural land and fishing lake. Business There are no shops in Brimpton Common, but the local employment includes: AWE Blacknest, a major centre for international seismological research; Lakeside Garden Centre, The Pineapple Public House plus a few small businesses surrounding AWE Blacknest. The Pineapple is 900 years old and it is mentioned in the Domesday Book. It was frequently used by shepherds and drovers as an overnight stop. The name is derived from the pine forest that once surrounded the area, a pine apple being a local name for a pine cone. The furniture inside the pub is noteworthy. It was made by a local craftsman using only a chainsaw and chisel and carved from the last of the English elm. For many years up to the 1990s its local worthies included ‚ÄúCowboy Roy‚Äù (who lived in a wild-west mock-up in nearby Haughurst Hill) and Gerry the Poacher, and their portraits once hung on either side of the fireplace in the public bar. Notable residents There have been notable residents in Brimpton Common: * Ruth Ellis: the last woman to be hanged in England. Although born in Wales, she grew up in Brimpton Common, just along the road from The Pineapple, and attended Brimpton Primary School. Her family moved to London when she was 15 years old. * Victor Gollancz, the left-wing publisher owned Lane End in the 1940s and for a number of years it subsequently became the weekend retreat of the then Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan and his wife Jennie Lee. * Ron Goodwin, British composer and conductor, lived at Blacknest Cottage, Brimpton Common, Berkshire, where he died on 8 January 2003, aged 77.

It was commissioned by the Festival de Lille for the inauguration of the TGV North-European Paris-Lille line and was first performed by the Michael Nyman Band and the Orchestre national de Lille under Jean-Claude Casadesus on 26 September 1993. Background From the program note by the composer: \\"MGV runs continuously but was conceived as an abstract, imaginary journey; or rather five inter- connected journeys, each ending with a slow, mainly stepwise melody which is only heard in its 'genuine' form when the piece reaches its destination. The thematic 'transformation' is a key to MGV as a whole, where musical ideas- rhythmic, melodic, harmonic, motivic, textural - constantly change their identity as they pass through different musical 'environments'. For instance the opening bars establish both a recurrent rhythmic principle - 9, 11, or 13-beat rhythmic cycles heard against a regular 8 - and a harmonic process - chord sequences (mainly over C and E) which have the note E in common. (Coincidentally, MGV begins in C and ends in E). A later scalic, syncopated figure (again first heard over C, E and A) begins the second section, featuring brass, in D flat. And so on: the topography of MGV should be experienced without reference to planning, description or timetables. Tempo changes, unpredictable slowings down, bear no logical relation to the high speed of the Paris-Lille journey, while the temptation to treat MGV as a concerto grosso, with the Michael Nyman band as the ripieno, was resisted: more suitably the Band (amplified in live performance) lays down the tracks on which MGV runs.\\" Recording history and popular culture MGV was presented on The Piano Concerto/MGV by Argo Records, released in 1994. , this remains the only commercial recording. A rearranged excerpt from the start of \\"1st Region\\" was featured in an influential Sony Wega television ad campaign in 1995. The same movement is featured in the soundtrack to The Last Black Man in San Francisco, the 2019 debut of director Joe Talbot.

Ronald started out in the band Fragma. He originally sang and played a little guitar but decided to stick to singing. He had been hanging around with Laurens Bakker and Rinus Vreugdenhil as they went through various incarnations of what was to become Picture. By 1979, he and Jan Bechtum had joined the band for their first stable (and the classic) lineup. He finally left the band after the second album. Ronald's main influence was Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow with Ronnie James Dio as the singer. In late 2007, Ronald and the original members of Picture teamed up for a reunion rehearsal. It went so well that they decided to continue rehearsing for some concert dates, and considered recording a new album in early 2008. Though ultimately Pete Lovell became Picture's permanent lead singer, Ronald is still active musically and is the singer for the Dutch band Roslynn.

The company was founded in 1981 by Randi Patterson, an English/Norwegian choreographer and innovator of modern dance. Patterson was succeeded by American Warren Spears, Dane Anette Abildgaard and British Tim Rushton. Swedish choreographer and filmmaker Pontus Lidberg is artistic director from April 2018. Danish Dance Company is based in Copenhagen.  History  Since 2001, Tim Rushton (MBE) has been the company's Artistic Director and has successfully continued Danish Dance Theatre's vision of combining the classical arts with the modern. Today, Danish Dance Theatre is the foremost contemporary dance company in Denmark, as well as the largest. The company is composed of hand-picked dancers from all over the world. Especially during the early years, stories and literary sources have often been a central role in the inspiration and creation of the company's performances. The company often collaborates with well-known writers, visual artists and composers and the music often ranges from classical masterpieces to jazz, rock and new compositions. Danish Dance Theatre receives an annual operating subsidy from the Ministry of Culture. Since the company's funding represents approximately half the financial support that other comparable Nordic companies receive, it is necessary to have additional financial backing from private companies, foundations and endowments. Until 2005, Danish Dance Theatre was a touring company with no permanent stage. In 2005, the company moved to Folketeatret in Copenhagen, where they had both a permanent stage and dance studio. In November 2009, the company moved from Folketeatret to DANSEhallerne and together with Dansescenen and Dansens Hus they are now situated on the former site of the Carlsberg Brewery. Between national touring, international touring and stationary performances, the company conducts between 60-80 performances annually. Danish Dance Theatre was founded in 1981 by the English/Norwegian choreographer and pioneer Randi Patterson, in collaboration with Anette Abildgaard, Ingrid Buchholtz, Mikala Barnekow and soon after, Warren Spears. At that time, the company was named ‚ÄòNew Danish Dance Theatre.‚Äô The repertoire spans from large stage productions at the Royal Danish Theatre, Danish Dance Theatre also does an extensive amount of both national and international touring. Besides touring and several stationary performances in Copenhagen, the company is also famous for two annual open-air events: ‚ÄúCopenhagen Summer Dance‚Äù, which takes place in the Copenhagen Police Headquarters and runs for one week in August and the picnic-performances ‚ÄúSpring Dance at Carlsberg‚Äù, which takes place during the two first weekends of June. The company's Artistic Director Tim Rushton has been nominated ten times for Best Dance Performance of the Year at the Danish Theatre Awards, Reumert, receiving the award four times; in 1999 for Busy Being Blue, in 2005 for Chalk, in 2006 for Requiem and in 2009 for Labyrinth. In 2010, Danish Dance Theatre received the Reumert Award for Frost, choreographed by Tina Tarpgaard. Since Rushton came to Danish Dance Theatre in 2001, the company has quadrupled the number of audience members. In addition, Rushton has received many other awards. In 2006 he received the Teaterkatten (Theatrecat) award as best director, a title awarded by ‚ÄúThe Association of Danish Theatre Journalists‚Äù. In 2007 he received the ‚ÄúNational Arts Foundation Award‚Äù for exceptional works of art for the 2006 performance Requiem. In 2008 he received ‚ÄúThe Danish Arts Society‚Äù award and in 2009 ‚ÄúThe Wilhelm Hansen Foundation‚Äù award. In 2011 he was honoured with the British MBE ‚Äì Member of the Order of the British Empire ‚Äì for his outstanding work for modern dance. In 2012 Tim Rushton received an Honorary Award at the Danish Theatre Awards, Reumert - this award is given an artist who through the years has made a unique contribution to the positive development of the performing arts in Denmark - and who is still actively performing.

The denomination grew out of the Stone-Campbell Movement founded by Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell of Pennsylvania and West Virginia (then Virginia) and Barton W. Stone of Kentucky. History The congregation that eventually became the National City Christian Church was organized in 1843. James Turner Barclay (1807-1874), a physician and pioneering Stone-Campbell Movement missionary, helped to organize the congregation.Paul M. Blowers, \\"Barclay, James Turner\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement (ed. Douglas A. Foster et al.: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 2004), p. 69. In the 1950s and 1960s, the church had a congregation of some 800 regular Sunday worshipers. Attendance declined over time, however; in 2011, Sunday attendance was about 125, with mostly older congregants.Del Quentin Wilber, In crisis, National City Christian Church‚Äôs members find strength, Washington Post (November 22, 2011). In 2004, the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Alvin O. Jackson, resigned following a heated acrimonious dispute. The ouster of Jackson followed the resignation or firings of some two dozen church staffers, and the development of a deep intra-congregational dispute.Bill Broadway, Local Divisions lead National City Christian Church pastor to resign, Washington Post (November 4, 2004). Jackson was replaced as senior pastor by the Rev. Stephen Gentle, \\"a soft-spoken pastor of a Florida church.\\" Subsequently, the church's chief financial officer, Jason Todd Reynolds, was discovered to have embezzled $850,000 in church funds from 2003 to 2008. In 2011, Reynolds was convicted of 12 fraud-related charges.Maryland Man Convicted of Embezzling More Than $500,000 From District of Columbia Church (press release), United States Department of Justice (August 16, 2011). He was sentenced to eight years in prison.Del Quentin Wilber, Prison for former church CFO who stole $850,000, Washington Post (November 9, 2011). The losses from Reynolds' embezzlement scheme caused serious damage to the church's financial health. The 2011 Virginia earthquake caused structural damage to the church building, causing financial troubles for the church.  Architecture and surroundings The neoclassical church building was designed by John Russell Pope and completed in 1930.G. Martin Moeller Jr., AIA Guide to the Architecture of Washington, Part 3 (4th ed.: Johns Hopkins University Press/Washington Chapter of the American Institute of Architects, 2006), p. 271. The church is very large in sizeMoeller, p. 271. and has a \\"monumental character\\" typical of Pope's style and seen in his other works, such as the Jefferson Memorial.Thomas A. Tweed, America's Church: The National Shrine and Catholic Presence in the Nation's Capital (Oxford University Press, 2011), p. 337. The church's design was partly influenced by James Gibbs' St Martin-in- the-Fields church, built at Trafalgar Square, London, in the early 18th century.Moeller, p. 271; see also Pamela Scott & Antoinette Jos√©phine Lee, Buildings of the District of Columbia (Society of Architectural Historians/Oxford University Press, 1993), p. 295. The building is built of Indiana limestone.Tweed, p. 337. Scholar Thomas A. Tweed writes that the building's facade, \\"high on a terrace overlooking Thomas Circle, a prominent location in the city ... demands the attention of motorists and pedestrians.\\"Tweed, p. 337. The church \\"features stained glass windows commemorating the two presidents associated with the denomination, James Garfield and Lyndon Johnson.\\" Peter W. Williams, Houses of God: Region, Religion, and Architecture in the United States (University of Illinois Press, 1997), p. 76. The church is a contributing property to the Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District.National Register of Historic Places Registration Form: Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District (boundary increase); Fourteenth Street Historic District (name change), National Park Service, United States Department of the Interior; see also [Greater Fourteenth Street Historic District map], District of Columbia Office of Planning (April 3, 2016). Across the street from the National City Christian Church is the Luther Place Memorial Church, which is also a historic church. Luther Place Memorial Church's neo-Gothic style sharply contrasts with the Neoclassical style of National City Christian Church.Moeller, p. 270. Other historic churches nearby include the Universalist National Memorial Church.Tweed, p. 337.

Formation The business started in the 1820s when John Brogden (1798‚Äì1869) moved from his father's farm near Clitheroe to set up in business in the rapidly expanding Manchester (not yet a city). In 1828 he appears in the Manchester Directory in Every Street, Ancoats as a farmer, in 1829 at the same address as a horse-dealer. In 1832 he successfully tendered for a contract with the local council (the Bororeeve) to undertake the cleansing and watering of Manchester.Higgins (1978), p241 Around this time he obtained a similar contract in London.Richardson(1870) Vol 1-page 22 In 1843, as a partner of Joseph Whitworth (later Sir Joseph), he contracted to sweep the streets of Manchester with Whitworth's patent machines. They undertook a similar contract in Westminster. In 1844 Brogden moved to London because the focus of his interests had moved to there. Many Brogden contracts were financed and supported by Samuel Brooks of Cunliffe, Brooks & Co. They became acquainted during early life in North Lancashire and this relationship was renewed in Manchester.Smiles p225 Brooks was vice-chairman of the Manchester and Leeds Railway so he was also well placed to help Brogden gain early railway contracts.Marshall(1970), Vol 1, p55 First Railway Contracts In July 1838 Brogden obtained a contractHeaton Norris on the Manchester and Birmingham and in August 1840 two more contracts jointly with Easthed.Cheadle and WilmslowDirectors' Minutes: Manchester and Birmingham Railway Co. RAIL 454/1 In 1842 Brogden secured contracts with the Manchester and Leeds Railway to build a viaduct between the existing station at Oldham Road and Hunts Bank. Then in March 1843 he gained the contract for the new station at Hunts Bank. This was opened on New Years Day 1844 under the name Manchester Victoria station. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway started using this station in the following May.Marshall (1970) p 40+, Wells J (2000) pp 73‚Äì75 and Directors' Minutes: Manchester and Leeds Railway Co. RAIL 343/3 In October 1845 he obtained a contract to build the Ashton Branch of the M&B; (Heaton Norris to Guide Bridge).Directors' Minutes: Manchester and Birmingham Railway Co RAIL 454/3 and the contract 454/11 He obtained contracts with the East Lancashire Railway to build from Stubbins to Accrington in 1845 and Blackburn to Hapton in 1846 (jointly with Smith and Pearce).Marshall (1970) p111 In 1846 Brogden became a director of the South Eastern Railway Company and John Brogden junior obtained contracts from that company for the North Kent Railway in November 1846 and February 1847.Directors' Minutes South Eastern Railway 1845‚Äì1847 RAIL 635/20 The Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway received its Act of Parliament in 1849. It had two sections: from London Road Station to Knott Mill and the second from there to Altrincham. Brogdens had the contract for the second section.Wells, p333 Samuel Brooks persuaded the company to build what we now know as Brooklands station, providing a guarantee of receipts for the first three years. He owned the land there and expected the station to help with its development.See the article on Samuel Brooks Marsland Road (the A6144) crosses the railway at this point before reaching Washway Road (A56). Just at the junction of these two roads are Brogden Grove and Brogden Terrace, with Victorian terrace houses on them. It is likely that Brooks sold or leased this land to Brogden at a favourable rate and Brogden built these houses on it. In turn the houses helped to justify the station and launch Brooklands as a place to live. Nearby Brogden built Raglan House, Raglan Road to be their new home. In short, an alliance between Brooks and Brogden. Brogden was joined in his business by his four eldest sons: John, Alexander, Henry and James as they reached the age of majority.Smiles p233 His youngest son, George was never involved as he was too young.Higgins 1978, p240 Work in Cumbria =Ulverston and Lancaster Railway= In the late 1840s the Brogdens became interested in iron ore mining in the Furness area of North Lancashire (now Cumbria). In 1846 John senior became a shareholder of the Furness Railway. They took ore-mining territory at Stainton in the estate of the Earl of Burlington and were developing mines there by December 1850. In 1850 the second largest haematite ore deposit in British history was discovered by Schneider and Co. at Park, on the Duddon shore in Furness. By 1855, in addition to Stainton, Brogdens had mines at Adgarley and Bolton Heads.Marshall (1958) pp 203‚Äì6 Mining capacity was growing fast. This ore was sent to market via the Furness Railway and then by ship. George Stephenson had planned a West Coast main Line to cross the mouth of Morecambe Bay and this would have linked Furness with the developing national rail network. However this plan was shelved in 1843. The Lancaster and Carlisle Railway Act was passed on 6 June 1844, establishing this as the route for the main line. Instead of Furness becoming part of the national rail strategy, it was now a backwater. It could only be connected to the main network by local efforts and these would involve crossing Morecambe Bay, with its notorious tidal quicksands. The Furness Railway directors collectively, led by Burlington, were not keen to take responsibility for this risky project although the Lancaster and Carlisle Railway was considering it.Andrews(1965 and 1966), Marshall(1958) p212 In 1847, a group led by Brogden and his three eldest sons began to promote a rail link between Ulverston and Carnforth, on the Lancaster‚ÄìCarlisle line and they eventually obtained the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway Act (Royal Assent on 24 July 1851). The directors were: John (sen.) John (jun.) Alexander, Henry, James Garstang (Alexander's father-in- law) and Joseph (later Sir Joseph) Paxton.Higgins (1978) p242 and Marshall(1958) p214, but Richardson(1870), page 18 has John, John, William Gale and Paxton The line was planned by McClean and Stileman at in length of which comprised embankments and viaducts across tidal water. Much of this was sand running to a depth of 30 to . Work on the line was not in full progress until September 1853. McClean and Stileman had resigned as engineers the previous February and were replaced by James Brunlees.Gooderson The viaducts over the Kent and Leven were designed and built by W & J Galloway & Sons of Manchester. Brunlees had already completed a similar project and went on to achieve great eminence. He worked again with Brogdens on: the Solway Junction Railway, the Mont Cenis Pass Railway and New Zealand railways. He worked again with the Galloways on Southport Pier.Richardson (1870) p19, Brunlees (1855) Marshall (1958) p 214‚Äì6 In 1851 Brogdens had been poised to take over the Furness Railway itself and a draft agreement was made between Burlington and John Brogden senior but the F.R. directors refused to ratify it. Thus Burlington's fellow directors saved him and his family from losing a great prize and prevented the Brogdens from gaining it.Marshall(1958) p 213 However, as the expensive work proceeded Brogdens ran short of money and had to ask the Furness Railway for financial assistance. As the FR legally could not do this, two of their directorsThe Earl of Burlington and the Duke of Buccleuch Marshall(1958) p 217 made a loan of ¬£50,000 in their personal capacities.Richardson(1870) p21 The line was opened on 26 August 1857.Richardson(1870) p 21, Marshall (1981) p 217 Gross expenditure was over ¬£410,000.Richardson(1870) page 23 Brogdens were struggling financially and in 1858 approached the Furness for another loan but declined to accept the stringent conditions demanded.To sell the U&L; to the F.R. at par for 4% Preference Stock ‚Äì Marshall (1958) p 218 Finally in 1862 Brogdens sold the U&L; to the existing Furness RailwayRichardson(1870) page 24 having made little or no direct profit. This railway link however was critical to the later industrial development of Barrow-in-Furness and its locality and mining interests.J D Marshall (1981), Richardson(1870) Vol 1 p 18 It also caused silt to build up in former tidal areas, creating new agricultural land. Brogdens' decision to sell this valuable railway, with good growth prospects, suggests that they were short of cash. =Solway Junction Railway= Alexander Brogden was chairman of the Solway Junction RailwayEdgar and Sinton, page 9 is a photograph of the invitation to the cutting of the first sod on 28 March 1865 on which the chairman is stated to be \\"Alex. Brogden\\" so they clearly had a substantial stake in that railway but their precise involvement is not clear. For this railway the Act of Parliament was passed in 1864 and the railway was opened in 1869 (goods only) and 1870 (goods and passengers). James Brunlees, previously noted, was the engineer. It was a failure in the long run because the cast iron viaduct could not withstand the ice-floes which were a regular feature of the winters here.Edgar and Sinton, pp 5,10,12,13, 19, 25-29, 53-55 Work in south Wales Another area of expansion was in Mid-Glamorgan in south Wales. The bulk of iron ore mined in Furness had been sent there and the Brogdens became aware that Sir Robert Price, the owner of the Glamorgan Iron and Coal Works at Tondu, was in difficulties. In December 1853 they purchased for ¬£10,000 the leases of the land and mines that he held. In the following January they purchased the works itself for ¬£35,000. In July they acquired the leases of other farms and mines previously held by Sir Robert.Higgins 1978, p243 These purchases took place only a short time before the Bessemer process (announced 1856) began to undercut the old iron-making processes. That was bad luck but possibly they should have observed the Bessemer process more carefully before expanding the factory especially as Galloways, who supplied the bridges for the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, were key players in the development of the Bessemer process. =Llynvi Valley / Cwm Llynfi= These purchases were put under the control of James Brogden who was then at 22 the junior partner. He made good progress. In 1859 he married Helen Dunbar Milne. This marriage was unhappy and was dissolved in 1865. When the horse-drawn Dyffryn Llynvi and Porthcawl Railway was replaced by the steam-hauled broad gauge Llynvi Valley Railway in 1861, the prospects of the Tondu and Maesteg areas improved and in 1863 Brogdens obtained a new lease of the Tywith This name is not on the current Ordnance Survey maps. However the B road between Nantyffyllon and Spelter is called Heol Tywith (verified on Microsoft Autoroute 2002) and a small group of houses called Tywith Cottages can be found on the left. From this (as well as the references below) it seems reasonable to suggest that Brogdens‚Äô Tywith Colliery was in this area. It's worth noting that about half a mile beyond Tywith Cottages, but on the right, there is a road/pathway leading to the memorial for Coegnant Colliery. Richards (1982) says, \\"It (Tywith) was closed to make room for the sinking of Coegnant Colliery and was the only works at the time where workmen were paid in cash and not under the truck shop system.\\" Brynmor James (1987), D.P.L.R. The Story of a Railway and its Background, p 169 refers to Ty Chwith Bridge and Ty Chwith Cottages in this location. Ty Chwith may have been the original Welsh name for Tywith. lands in the Llynfi valley, from which they raised coal and iron in large quantities.Richards 1982 Tywith is very close to Coegnant and later there was a court case in which Brogdens were alleged to have extended their mine into Coegnant's territory (see below). In 1864 they leased the Garth land, sank the Garth pit and erected coke-ovens, which they worked until the depression in 1877 forced their closure.Owen (2002), p 28 Richards (1982) says (re Garth Colliery, 1864), \\"J. Brogden & Sons bought Garth Fach and Cwmdu Canol Farms and sank this pit in 1865. The sinking operations were supervised by James Barrow, who was later President of the South Wales Institute of Engineers. He was also mineral agent to the Margam Estate. In 1867 there was an explosion but no-one was hurt. It resulted in the closure of the colliery for a year. About 1880 the pit was idle for another year but in 1882 it was sunk to a depth of 250 yards, 3 seams being worked. In addition there were 60 coke ovens producing 1,000 tons of coke weekly. It was after the sinking of Oakwood and Garth Pits that the village of Garth developed. Garth Pit closed in 1930 when it employed 616 men.\\". =Ogmore Valley / Cwm Ogwr= The Brogdens also worked the Ogmore valley, first at the top of the valley but in 1865 they sank the Wyndham pit and opened the Tynewydd level. They worked both of these until 1872 when a new joint stock company was formed. In July 1863 they obtained an Act for the Ogmore Valley Railway of which Alexander became the chairman. This was a Standard gauge railway from Nantymoel at the head of the valley to a junction with the LlynviThe name was Anglicised from the Welsh spelling \\"Llynfi\\" Valley Railway (Broad gauge) at Tondu. They also gained power to lay a third rail along the Llynvi Valley line from Tondu to Porthcawl.Higgins 1978 p244, Barrie 1980 p???, Owen 2002 Vol.3, p 13 =Aberdare= The Bwllfa Dare No. 1 Pit was opened in 1856 by E Lewis and worked by the Byllfa Colliery Co. Ltd., then Brogdens and then the Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Coal Collieries Ltd. There seem to have been two Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare companies. The first was founded in November 1876 to purchase the lease from Brogdens. George, the only Brogden son not to be a partner in John Brogden and Sons, was connected with this first Bwllfa-Merthyr company. It seems to have been reorganised in 1881. On 17 April 1890 a meeting was held at the pit head, attended by about 700 colliers, at which George was presented with an illuminated address and described as the proprietor.David Owen (2001), South Wales Collieries, Vol. 1, Stroud: Tempus Publishing Ltd., .Higgins (1978) p 249 =Porthcawl= The decision to build standard gauge in a broad gauge area prevented them from sending their coal either to Cardiff (via Stormy) or Blackmill via the Ely Valley Extension Railway. They therefore decided to build a new port at Porthcawl as the old tidal dock was unsatisfactory. They obtained the co-operation of the Llynfi company and jointly obtained the Llynvi and Ogmore Railways Act in June 1864. This included the new dock, to be run jointly by the two companies. This covered 7 ¬Ω acres, had . wharfage, four high level loading stages and a capacity of 5,000 tons of coal per day. It cost ¬£250,000. In July 1866 the Lynvi and Ogmore companies were amalgamated to make the Llynvi and Ogmore Railway with Alexander Brogden as chairman.Higgins 1978, p244 When the new dock was opened on 22 July 1867 it was part of this new company. The place of honour went to the Brogden screw steamer SS John Brogden.Higgins (1964) By 1868 all lines were dual gaugeLlynvi and Ogmore Railway so the essential motivation for the dock was no longer present. It is not entirely clear why they built the Ogmore Valley as a standard gauge railway in a broad gauge area, forcing the decision to build a dock at considerable expense. It may have been unavoidable owing to the Gauge Act of 1846. If so then perhaps it would have been cheaper to build the line as dual gauge from the start instead of building a dock. Perhaps even this was not permissible. The Llynvi Valley Railway was formed in 1861 by reopening pre-1846 lines. This is probably why it was permitted to use broad gauge. What is clear is that Brogdens sold off the Ulverston and Lancaster at about the same time as they started the Ogmore Valley Railway. The trade of the new dock grew rapidly. In 1864 only 17,000 tons of coal passed out of the old outer basin but in 1871 the new inner dock shipped over 165,000 tons. In July 1873 the Great Western Railway took it over from the Llynvi and Ogmore, guaranteeing a dividend of 6%. At the end of January 1865 James Brogden acquired of land adjoining the dock on behalf of the firm. In May 1867 he granted leases on the western side of what was to be the main street, to be called John Street in honour of his father. When Alexander later assumed control he stopped this venture. However, when the firm was dissolved, Mrs James Brogden acquired the land and she and her husband established on it the nucleus of modern Porthcawl.Higgins 1978, p245 =Alexander Takes Charge= When John Brogden senior died in December 1869, Alexander assumed his father's position as head of the firm and came to Tondu to take control. He chose to reside in the vacant house of the co-respondent in James's divorce, despite the latter's protestations and offer to vacate Tondu House. This decision made it difficult to maintain the cordial relationship necessary to manage the business.Higgins (1978) =Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company= In December 1871 the fortunes of the Brogdens began to change when the firm made an agreement with the neighbouring Llynvi Coal and Iron Company Ltd which owned a large integrated ironworks at Maesteg, six miles (10 km) north of Tondu. As a result of the agreement, the two companies merged to form a new joint stock company, the Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company which was 'floated' in May 1872. The merger was probably inevitable as, in 1870, the Brogdens were challenged by the Llynvi company in the High Court after the former company had crossed the boundary of the latter in the Coegnant district and mined large quantities of Llynvi coal without permission. The Vice- Chancellor, Sir James Bacon, ruled in favour of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co. and the Brogdens had to face a very large demand for compensation or an expensive appeal. The merger of the two companies quickly followed. Although the Brogden family were the main shareholders in the new company and Alexander Brogden was the chairman, the family, for the first time, relinquished control over their fortunes as the new company had a large number of 'vocal' shareholders in the Manchester and Southport areas who closely monitored the progress of the new venture. In 1873, during a major strike among the iron company workers in south Wales, Alexander Brogden acted unilaterally and settled amicably with the workforce a month before the strike eventually ended in the rest of the coalfield. In the immediate aftermath of the strike Alexander Brogden was so highly regarded by his workforce in Maesteg that, for a time, it was suggested that the planned town hall in the valley should be named in his honour. By 1874 however, after a brief period of prosperity, profits slumped as the Tondu and Llynvi works faced competition from cheaper producers abroad and, more importantly, from cheap Bessemer steel. Losses accumulated until the company's debenture holders opted for voluntary liquidation in January 1878. The company would have probably survived the trade depression of the late 1870s were it not for the untimely intervention of one of the old Llynvi company's Debenture Holders, probably George Moffatt, former chairman of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co Ltd. Moffatt decided to withdraw his large debenture holding in December 1877, a move which would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings with disastrous consequences for the debenture holders. As a result, the holders opted for the lesser evil of voluntary liquidation. The merger of 1871‚Äì2 proved to be disastrous for the Brogdens as they forfeited effective control over their Welsh enterprises, and expanded their exposure to iron, at a time when the south Wales wrought iron trade was about to enter a period of terminal decline.Higgins (1978)The Iron Industry in Maesteg, David Lewis, Swansea 2007 =Metropolitan Railway= Brogdens had other difficulties. They owned the Bwllfa Colliery in the Aberdare Valley (see above) and since the beginning of 1870 had supplied coal weekly to the Metropolitan Railway at favourable prices. A draft contract had been initialled by Alexander but never formally completed and Alexander decided to cease deliveries without notice. The Metropolitan held that the draft contract was valid and had been breached. A case was tried at the Surrey Spring Assizes (1873), The Court of Common Pleas and the House of Lords (1877), each of which held for the Metropolitan.Higgins 1978, p247 This case is an important precedent in the law of contract.A Google search for Brogden v Metropolitan Railway will produce ample evidence of this. See also Brogden v Metropolitan Railway Company Alpine Crossing from France to Italy The Mont Cenis Pass Railway between France and Italy was promoted and construction overseen by a partnership consisting of Alexander Brogden, The Duke of Sutherland, Sir James Hudson, Thomas Brassey, The Duke of Vallombrosa, Lord Abinger, Sir Robert Dallas, Edward Blount, Jervoise Smith, Thomas Crampton, W B Buddicom, J B Fell, and James Brunlees. Fell and Brunlees were the engineers. Fell designed the engine/rail system for mountain use and Brunlees designed the route in accordance with Fell's design. This temporary \\"Fell Railway\\" was the first mountain railway in the world. It operated from 1868 to 1871, and was replaced by the railway through the Mont Cenis Tunnel. Although the railway was successful in technical and service terms, it is doubtful whether the shareholders got any of their money back and Brogdens had invested a lot. Out of 8,678 shares issued (as of August 1866), Alexander had taken 792. By November 1867 ¬£150,000 had been raised by shares and only ¬£2,600 by debentures. In October 1868, shareholders funds were unchanged but debentures stood at ¬£180,000, loans ¬£17,500 and creditors at ¬£65,000. It follows that Alexander's share investment, now lost, had been about ¬£13,700, plus one share of ¬£1,000 in the Mont Cenis Concessionary Company which had been formed earlier to negotiate concessions from the two governments.Gilpin(1988), Richardson (1881), p 47 and Ransom(1999) pp 22, 30-33, 42, 57/8, 64 Work in New Zealand Towards the end of 1870 the New Zealand Government, dominated by Sir Julius Vogel, the Colonial Treasurer and soon to be Prime Minister, authorised the colony's first major railway construction programme as part of his great Public Works policy. Vogel travelled to London to negotiate loans and concluded an agreement with Brogdens to construct railways and provide plant to the value of ¬£500,000. He also negotiated a much larger alternative contract, subject to Parliamentary approval, which would give the colony ¬£4,000,000 of railways and 10,000 immigrants in return for transferring of land to the contractors. James Brogden travelled to New Zealand to complete them. He left Liverpool in August 1871 and returned to England early in 1873. The diaryBrogden(1871‚Äì73) Diary Online that he kept during his journey shows that he was engaged in very difficult and protracted negotiations. In October 1871 the New Zealand Parliament rejected the larger contract but allowed the ministry to negotiate an extension to the smaller one. The government started its own immigration programme and also made an agreement with Brogdens that Brogdens would dispatch up to 2000 able-bodied men plus wives and children to a maximum of 6,000 adults. For this privilege Brogdens had to pay the government ¬£10 per adult and could take promissory notes from the adult immigrants not exceeding ¬£16 each. Brogdens hoped for great things and, under pressure from the New Zealand government began in April 1872 to ship immigrants. These immigrants, and rail workers in general in New Zealand, gained the nickname Brogdenites.See, for example, the term's contemporary usage in and . In England Brogdens were offering better terms than the New Zealand government, mainly in the sense that they paid most of the necessary costs themselves, relying on promissory notes from the immigrants, whereas the government wanted substantial payments in advance which were hard for a working man to find. For this reason the colony's Agent-General in London, Dr. Isaac Featherston directed staff to support the Brogden programme. It was not easy to persuade men or families to leave their homeland. However the 1866 recession in copper-mining in Cornwall and bitter disputes between farmers and farm labourers assisted the recruiters. Charles Carter (1822‚Äì1896), a member of Featherston's recruitment staff who interviewed nearly all the \\"Brogden navvies\\", had been a Chartist sympathiser and an active propagandist for improved working class conditions before emigrating to New Zealand in 1850 and the campaign worked closely with the unions.Arnold Chapter 1 In 1872 the Company was given six rail contracts as follows:New Zealand Government Archives * Auckland and Mercer: completed 1875Atkinson p 35 * Wellington and Hutt: reached Lower Hutt in 1874 * Napier and Paki Paki * Picton and Blenheim: completed 1875Atkinson p 32 * Dunedin and Clutha: part opened 1 July 1874, completed 1 Sep 1875G.B. Churchman & T. Hume (1992), South Island Main Trunk, p 9, IPL Books, Sydney and Wellington * Invercargill and Mataura: part opened 12 February 1874, completed 30 Aug 1875But Watt (1965) p 51 says completion was 7 June 1875 for sections of railway totalling at a cost of ¬£808,000. There were considerable difficulties in the operation of the contracts and the management of the men. During the period 1870‚Äì1875, political power gradually transferred from the Provinces to the central government, partly because of the railway question. The Bill to abolish the Provinces was carried in October 1875 and implemented a year later. However, in the interim it was very difficult for Brogdens to get clear prompt decisions.Atkins p 38 and Brogden (1873) Brogdens got less work than they had hoped and it became available more slowly than expected. Communications between UK and New Zealand were obviously slow so it was difficult to know how many men to send at any given time. Sometimes Brogdens could not find work for the men when they arrived. Men reneged on their promissory notes. There were disputes over working hours, wages and whether they should be paid when the weather stopped the work. Gradually the men drifted away. By August 1873, 2172 English immigrants had been brought out. They included 1299 working-age men who were contracted to work for Brogdens for two years but only 287 of them were still working for them. Most of the men were agricultural labourers, rather than true navvies and they found local agricultural labour and working conditions more attractive than navvy work. Consequently, work was slower than expected and in 1879 the Company was in dispute with the New Zealand Government over contract payments. Bankruptcy soon followed. Although this was not a happy result for Brogdens, the results for New Zealand and the families themselves were good. New Zealand obtained useful citizens who were very happy with their work, wages, food and social conditions. Their letters home encouraged more people to come. Many of today's New Zealanders have ancestors who were members of the families who emigrated at this time.Higgins (1978) p 245, Arnold (1981) chapter one, Leitch (1972), New Zealand Archives, Atkinson (2007) pp 28‚Äì39 Other work Brogdens built part of the Northampton and Peterborough Railway, from Oundle to Peterborough.Contract RAIL 384/196 dated 11 January 1844 They also doubled the line from Oundle to Peterborough (contracted 11 Dec 1845).Minutes of the N&P; Committee of the London and Birmingham Railway RAIL 384/105 They built sluices and tidal gates at St Germans, Norfolk, one of the outlets of The Fens.Richardson(1870) p 227 In July 1850 they joined Mr McClean in a lease of the South Staffordshire line. Alexander Brogden was general manager and Henry locomotive manager. This continued until February 1860 when the LNWR took a new lease.RAIL 410/869 and 410/870Richardson (1881) pp 46/7Yate, Bob (2010), The South Staffordshire Railway Vol. 1: Dudley-Walsall- Lichfield-Burton, The Oakwood Press, pp 13, 66, 67 This line ran through Wednesbury and Alexander was elected as the first M.P. of that town in 1868. He held the seat until 1880. In the Netherlands Brogdens held the concession to construct about of railway ‚Äì the Tilburg and Nijmegen in North Brabant and Gelderland, which formed part of the Dutch South Eastern Railway Company (DSERC) and a new direct route from London to Berlin via Flushing (Vlissingen). There was some dispute with the DSERC but the nature of this dispute is not clear. Richardson (1881) page 46 also refers to an ironworks in Finland and copper mines in Russia. An obituary of Henry Brogden refers to work in Australia and South America.Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, Annual Report of Council (1913), Obituaries, Henry Brogden The End of the Company The partnership of Alexander, Henry and James Brogden, trading as Brogdens from 52 Queen Victoria Street in the City of London, was dissolved on 31 July 1880 by order of the Chancery Division of Her Majesty's High Court of Justice with effect from 26 July. On 11 January 1884 the liquidations of Alexander and Henry were announced in the London Gazette. They had presented petitions for liquidation estimating their liabilities upwards of ¬£500,000 with assets of ¬£3,830. The properties associated with the Brogdens in Tondu and Maesteg were purchased by North's Navigation Collieries Ltd in 1889. The new company, initially led by Colonel John T. North, the 'Nitrate King', produced iron at the Tondu site until 1896 before concentrating on the booming coal trade in the Llynfi and Ogmore valleys.

It lies in the southwest corner of the county at the junction of Farm to Market Roads 1528 and 2890, three miles southwest of Cooper. As of the 2000 Census, the population was estimated at approximately 135. History Klondike's documented history began in 1852, when local landowner John Hunt donated parcel of land for a cemetery for the community, which was then known as Pleasant Grove. By the early 1860s a school had begun serving the area's pupils, sharing a building with a small Methodist congregation. Pleasant Grove entered a period of mild prosperity in 1895, when the Texas-Midland Railroad spur to Cooper was completed through the community, and by 1897 the population had risen to 75, and prominent citizen and landowner Joel Jefferson Hunt applied for a postal franchise under the name Klondike, in honor of the Canadian Klondike, site of the gold rush. In 1901 the Klondike Baptist Church of Christ, which had been sharing a building with the Methodist congregation, built their own building, and three years later Klondike's population exceeded 150 and by 1905 the community's two segregated schools had a combined enrollment of 183 students. Bolstered by the cotton shipping and processing industry, by 1914 Klondike was home to 3 doctors, several commercial businesses (including a bank), a telegraph station, two large cotton gins and a population of 400. The boll weevil blight of the 1920s brought a great degree of adversity to Klondike, however, and the onset of the Great Depression essentially ended the community's prosperity, and by 1933 the population had fallen to 154. When the school building was destroyed by fire in 1945, Klondike schools were consolidated with fellow Delta County community Shiloh's schools to form the West Delta Independent School District, but by 1970 Klondike's school children were attending classes in Cooper. Despite the adversity, the population has remained fairly consistent since the 1960s and as of the 2000 census, there were an estimated 135 residents still living in Klondike.TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association References Category:Unincorporated communities in Texas Category:Unincorporated communities in Delta County, Texas Category:Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth metroplex ","title":"Klondike, Delta County, Texas"},{"id":"14088762","text":"Jarkowice () is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Lubawka, within Kamienna G√≥ra County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

Route description Broadway Bridge in Greenville State Route 571 starts in the Indiana/Ohio border town of Union City. To the west, it turns into Indiana State Route 28, which goes west toward Albany and Alexandria, Indiana. To the east, SR 571 goes southeast through Hill Grove and Coletown, and then parallels Greenville Creek into Greenville. From Greenville it continues southeast through Painter Creek and Laura to West Milton where it turns due east, passes over Interstate 75 to Tipp City and New Carlisle. About southeast of New Carlisle, SR 571 meets U.S. Route 40, the eastern terminus of the state route. Although no longer a state route, the road keeps on going across US 40 as County Highway 303 (Medway-Carlisle Road) in Clark County. The road continues south, through the village of Medway and further on it turns into the northern terminus of I-675 at I-70. The portion of SR 571 between Union City and Greenville in Darke County is designated the \\"196th Light Infantry Brigade SP4 Robert L. Fowble Jr., and PFC Jack E. Beam Memorial Highway\\", in honor of two U.S. Army soldiers from the same brigade who were killed by enemy fire while fighting in the Vietnam War. Fowble, a Greenville native, died on November 23, 1966. Beam, a Union City native, died on Dec. 21, 1966. The portion of the route within Miami County is designated the \\"Robert E. Netzley Highway\\" in honor of the late former state representative. History The Union City-to-Springfield roads have been part of the Ohio state highway system since 1912. Before 1923, numerous highway numbers comprised the current route of SR 571. In 1923, the route between Greenville and then-SR 1 (now US 40); the remainder of the route between Union City and Greenville was the westernmost segment of SR 29. By 1932, SR 29 was truncated to Urbana with US 36 taking over its former route between Greenville and Urbana; SR 71 was also extended from Greenville to the Indiana state line in Union City. By 1939, the entire length of SR 71 had been paved. Following the extension to Union City, no major changes to the routing of SR 71 and SR 571 have been made. The only change to the highway came in 1962 when Ohio renumbered state highways that shared route numbers with proposed Interstates. Because of I-71, SR 71 was renumbered to SR 571. An unrelated SR 571 was in existence from 1937 to 1957 in Bridgewater Township, Williams County. This SR 571 ran from US 20 to the Michigan state line. In 1957, SR 576 was extended north and took over the highway.

It is the most abundant of the PARP family of enzymes.  Function  PARP1 works: * By using NAD+ to synthesize poly ADP ribose (PAR) and transferring PAR moieties to proteins.(ADP- ribosylation) * In conjunction with BRCA, which acts on double strands; members of the PARP family act on single strands; or, when BRCA fails, PARP takes over those jobs as well (in a DNA repair context). PARP1 is involved in: * Differentiation, proliferation, and tumor transformation * Normal or abnormal recovery from DNA damage * May be the site of mutation in Fanconi anemia * Induction of inflammation. * The pathophysiology of type I diabetes. PARP1 is activated by: * Helicobacter pylori in the development and proliferation of gastric cancer. = Role in DNA damage repair = PARP1 acts as a first responder that detects DNA damage and then facilitates choice of repair pathway. PARP1 contributes to repair efficiency by modulating chromatin structure and by interacting with and modifying multiple DNA repair factors. PARP1 is implicated in the regulation of several DNA repair processes including the pathways of nucleotide excision repair, non-homologous end joining, microhomology-mediated end joining, homologous recombinational repair, and DNA mismatch repair. PARP1 has a role in repair of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) breaks. Knocking down intracellular PARP1 levels with siRNA or inhibiting PARP1 activity with small molecules reduces repair of ssDNA breaks. In the absence of PARP1, when these breaks are encountered during DNA replication, the replication fork stalls, and double-strand DNA (dsDNA) breaks accumulate. These dsDNA breaks are repaired via homologous recombination (HR) repair, a potentially error-free repair mechanism. For this reason, cells lacking PARP1 show a hyper-recombinagenic phenotype (e.g., an increased frequency of HR), which has also been observed in vivo in mice using the pun assay. Thus, if the HR pathway is functioning, PARP1 null mutants (cells without functioning PARP1) do not show an unhealthy phenotype, and in fact, PARP1 knockout mice show no negative phenotype and no increased incidence of tumor formation. = Role in inflammation = PARP1 is required for NF-Œ∫B transcription of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin 6, and inducible nitric oxide synthase. PARP1 activity contributes to the proinflammatory macrophages that increase with age in many tissues. ADP-riboyslation of the HMGB1 high-mobility group protein by PARP1 inhibits removal of apoptotic cells, thereby sustaining inflammation. In asthma PARP1 facilitates recruitment and function of immune cells, including CD4+ T-cells, eosinophils, and dendritic cells. =Over-expression in cancer= PARP1 is one of six enzymes required for the highly error-prone DNA repair pathway microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ). MMEJ is associated with frequent chromosome abnormalities such as deletions, translocations, inversions and other complex rearrangements. When PARP1 is up-regulated, MMEJ is increased, causing genome instability. PARP1 is up-regulated and MMEJ is increased in tyrosine kinase-activated leukemias. PARP1 is also over-expressed when its promoter region ETS site is epigenetically hypomethylated, and this contributes to progression to endometrial cancer, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, and BRCA-mutated serous ovarian cancer. PARP1 is also over-expressed in a number of other cancers, including neuroblastoma, HPV infected oropharyngeal carcinoma, testicular and other germ cell tumors, Ewing‚Äôs sarcoma, malignant lymphoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. Cancers are very often deficient in expression of one or more DNA repair genes, but over-expression of a DNA repair gene is less usual in cancer. For instance, at least 36 DNA repair enzymes, when mutationally defective in germ line cells, cause increased risk of cancer (hereditary cancer syndromes). (Also see DNA repair-deficiency disorder.) Similarly, at least 12 DNA repair genes have frequently been found to be epigenetically repressed in one or more cancers. (See also Epigenetically reduced DNA repair and cancer.) Ordinarily, deficient expression of a DNA repair enzyme results in increased un-repaired DNA damage which, through replication errors (translesion synthesis), lead to mutations and cancer. However, PARP1 mediated MMEJ repair is highly inaccurate, so in this case, over-expression, rather than under-expression, apparently leads to cancer. = Interaction with BRCA1 and BRCA2 = Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are at least partially necessary for the HR pathway to function. Cells that are deficient in BRCA1 or BRCA2 have been shown to be highly sensitive to PARP1 inhibition or knock-down, resulting in cell death by apoptosis, in stark contrast to cells with at least one good copy of both BRCA1 and BRCA2. Many breast cancers have defects in the BRCA1/BRCA2 HR repair pathway due to mutations in either BRCA1 or BRCA2, or other essential genes in the pathway (the latter termed cancers with \\"BRCAness\\"). Tumors with BRCAness are hypothesized to be highly sensitive to PARP1 inhibitors, and it has been demonstrated in mice that these inhibitors can both prevent BRCA1/2-deficient xenografts from becoming tumors and eradicate tumors having previously formed from BRCA1/2-deficient xenografts. = Application to cancer therapy = PARP1 inhibitors are being tested for effectiveness in cancer therapy. It is hypothesized that PARP1 inhibitors may prove highly effective therapies for cancers with BRCAness, due to the high sensitivity of the tumors to the inhibitor and the lack of deleterious effects on the remaining healthy cells with functioning BRCA HR pathway. This is in contrast to conventional chemotherapies, which are highly toxic to all cells and can induce DNA damage in healthy cells, leading to secondary cancer generation. =Aging= PARP activity (which is mainly due to PARP1) measured in the permeabilized mononuclear leukocyte blood cells of thirteen mammalian species (rat, guinea pig, rabbit, marmoset, sheep, pig, cattle, pigmy chimpanzee, horse, donkey, gorilla elephant and man) correlates with maximum lifespan of the species. Lymphoblastoid cell lines established from blood samples of humans who were centenarians (100 years old or older) have significantly higher PARP activity than cell lines from younger (20 to 70 years old) individuals. The Wrn protein is deficient in persons with Werner syndrome, a human premature aging disorder. PARP1 and Wrn proteins are part of a complex involved in the processing of DNA breaks. These findings indicate a linkage between longevity and PARP-mediated DNA repair capability. Furthermore, PARP can also act against production of reactive oxygen species, which may contribute to longevity by inhibiting oxidative damage to DNA and proteins. These observations suggest that PARP activity contributes to mammalian longevity, consistent with the DNA damage theory of aging. PARP1 appears to be resveratrol's primary functional target through its interaction with the tyrosyl tRNA synthetase (TyrRS). Tyrosyl tRNA synthetase translocates to the nucleus under stress conditions stimulating NAD+-dependent auto-poly-ADP- ribosylation of PARP1, thereby altering the functions of PARP1 from a chromatin architectural protein to a DNA damage responder and transcription regulator. The messenger RNA level and protein level of PARP1 is controlled, in part, by the expression level of the ETS1 transcription factor which interacts with multiple ETS1 binding sites in the promoter region of PARP1. The degree to which the ETS1 transcription factor can bind to its binding sites on the PARP1 promoter depends on the methylation status of the CpG islands in the ETS1 binding sites in the PARP1 promoter. If these CpG islands in ETS1 binding sites of the PARP1 promoter are epigenetically hypomethylated, PARP1 is expressed at an elevated level. Cells from older humans (69 to 75 years of age) have a constitutive expression level of both PARP1 and PARP2 genes reduced by half, compared to their levels in young adult humans (19 to 26 years old). However, centenarians (humans aged 100 to 107 years of age) have constitutive expression of PARP1 at levels similar to those of young individuals. https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michele_Zampieri/publication/6313423_Oxidative_DNA_Damage_Repair_and_parp_1_and_parp_2_Expression_in_Epstein- Barr_Virus- Immortalized_B_Lymphocyte_Cells_from_Young_Subjects_Old_Subjects_and_Centenarians/links/575e952d08aec91374b3d6b7.pdf This high level of PARP1 expression in centenarians was shown to allow more efficient repair of H2O2 sublethal oxidative DNA damage. Higher DNA repair is thought to contribute to longevity (see DNA damage theory of aging). The high constitutive levels of PARP1 in centenarians were thought to be due to altered epigenetic control of PARP1 expression.  Plant PARP1  Plants have a PARP1 with substantial similarity to animal PARP1, and roles of poly(ADP- ribosyl)ation in plant responses to DNA damage, infection and other stresses have been studied. Intriguingly, in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ (and presumably other plants), PARP2 plays more significant roles than PARP1 in protective responses to DNA damage and bacterial pathogenesis. The plant PARP2 carries PARP regulatory and catalytic domains with only intermediate similarity to PARP1, and carries N-terminal SAP DNA binding motifs rather than the Zn-finger DNA binding motifs of plant and animal PARP1 proteins.

The charity provides mental health services by working in partnership with many other organisations, including housing associations, health trusts, local authorities, criminal-justice agencies and private- and other voluntary-sector bodies. The charity changed its name in 2005 from the Mental After Care Association. Key to the change was the incorporation of wellbeing, now a foundational concept in the charity's work.  History  Together was founded in 1879 by Rev Henry Hawkins, then chaplain of Colney Hatch asylum, who wanted to find ways to support people leaving the institution once they returned to the community. Wellbeing Week In 2008, Together held its first Wellbeing Week, a series of events taking place in Projects and offices across the United Kingdom.

His feast day is celebrated on 27 March. Several churches in the diocese of Guarda and elsewhere in Portugal are dedicated to him.http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=1312 Life Amador was born in Monsanto on the edge of the Bishopric of Guarda. He retired to the hermitage of S√£o Pedro Vir-on-Corces, where he lived for many years. One day he found an abandoned newborn, whom he raised and educated, and who also became a hermit and priest in the same place. Over time, the cave where they lived was converted into a chapel. Legend No one knew from where he had come nor his name, but because of his kindness, he was called Amador (\\"lover\\" or \\"embodiment of love\\"). In the neighborhood there was a woman of very bad temper who was reputed to fight with everyone. Her name was Ricarda and she was known to visit Amador, bringing him bread and fresh water. Despite her constant arguing and bad temper, Amador did not waver from his loving-kindness toward her. One day the woman went away, returning with a small child (possibly her son). Amador asked Ricarda to allow him to baptize the child, but Ricarda objected, saying that she would prefer if the child was taken by demons. According to the legend, a great storm instantly arose, the sun disappeared and a group of demons appeared and took the child, lifting it into the air. At the same time the ground opened and swallowed Ricarda. Amador prayed with such faith to save the child that the demons were forced to release it, and the child fell on a rock without receiving any harm to his feet. The hermit asked for help from God to raise the child, and God sent him a female deer every day who nourished the child with her milk. The child, growing up under Amador's care, became a monastic in the same tradition, and helped Amador as he aged. One day it was revealed that the father of the young monk had died and was suffering in purgatory, and Amador advised the young man to say Mass and to pray for his father's salvation. At some point soon after, Amador received a revelation that the prayers had been answered and the father's soul had been admitted to paradise. The boy continued to attend Amador and to praise his holiness and love until Amador's death and burial. The boy continued taking care of the church, following his master's way of life, and when he died he was buried with Amador beneath the altar of the church. Veneration The chapel became a place of pilgrimage and miracles attributed to the intercession of the saint, as well as protection against aphid pests and lizards in the fields. Some churches, particularly in the diocese of Guarda, are dedicated to him. His liturgical celebration is on 27 March.

He is a six-time Champion of Russia, European Champion, World and Olympic medalist. Ayrapetyan was awarded the Honored Master of Sports of Russia title in 2009. Early life David was born on 26 October 1983 in Baku, Azerbaijan SSR to an Armenian family. David received his name from his uncle, his fathers brother. His uncle was a wrestler and took David to his practices. After the beginning of the war in Karabakh, the family was forced to move to Armenia and then later to Russia. They lived in Pyatigorsk for 13 years. The family rented a room in a four-storey apartment in which David's parents, brother and grandmother lived in. In the fourth grade, David already knew some basics of combat from his uncle and once got into a fight with two classmates. He fought for what was right, but didn't win. When David came home, he scattered all of his school things around the house because he was angry. When his mother came home from work, he told her what's wrong, and she started crying and tried to clam him. His mother told him to go take revenge and he did. This is how everything started. Ayrapetyan started boxing when he was 13 years old under Valery Entaltseva. He graduated from North Caucasus State Technical University, Faculty of Law, Stavropol, Russia. Career Ayrapetyan became the 2002 World Youth Champion in his weight class after boxing for just six years. He was included in the Russian national boxing team in 2006 and won a gold medal at the 2006 European Amateur Boxing Championships in Plovdiv. Ayrapetyan is only the second Russian boxer to become a European Champion in the light flyweight division, after the highly decorated veteran Sergey Kazakov. In 2006 and 2007, Ayrapetyan beat Kazakov at the Russian Championships and took his spot on the national team as first in the light flyweight division. At the 2007 World Amateur Boxing Championships, Ayrapetyan beat returning Vice-Champion P√°l Bed√°k in the first round but next lost to reigning World Champion Zou Shiming, who went on to win the World Championships again. Ayrapetyan competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He unexpectedly lost in the first match to Georgiy Chygayev, who won the European Championship at flyweight that year and then moved down in weight class. Ayrapetyan reached the finals at the 2009 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Milan and won the silver medal. He won a bronze medal at the 2011 World Amateur Boxing Championships after losing to now reigning World and Olympic Champion Shiming, who went on to win the World Championship yet again. Ayrapetyan advanced to the semifinals at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won an Olympic bronze medal.

Splitrock, along with the nearby Boonton Reservoir, provides water for Jersey City, New Jersey. The reservoir is surrounded by woods and can be reached by traveling a mile on a dirt road known as Split Rock Road. The reservoir is three miles from end to end, with many large islands. There is a man-made dam on the southwest end of the reservoir. The reservoir and surrounding natural area were opened to the public on November 21, 2003.  Activities  Splitrock offers various outdoor activities. At the parking area (see below), there is an interpretive kiosk with three panels. One provides an overview for the fisherman, one provides an overview for the hiker and the third provides an historic overview on the Splitrock/Cobb furnace. Splitrock is a very attractive area for fishermen with small watercraft. The reservoir has a population of smallmouth and largemouth bass, as well as catfish, crappie, sunfish, perch, pickerel and bait fish. Anglers can expect decent fishing for bass, crappie and chain pickerel in the reservoir. Splitrock is categorized as a Lunker Lake by the state of NJ so there is a three bass limit and they must be over 15 inches. From April 15 through June 15 it is catch and release only. There is no shoreline fishing at Splitrock. There are many scenic hiking trails of varying difficulty. The hiking trails are part of the Farny Highlands Trail Network. A trail map is available on-line from the Morris Trails Partnership. The New Jersey Walk Book, published by the New York New Jersey Trail ConferenceNew York New Jersey Trail Conference has a detailed verbal description of the Four Birds and the Splitrock Loop trails. In April 2011 the New York New Jersey Trail Conference published a hiking map that includes the Farny Highlands Trail System. Hikers should look for signs of white-tailed deer, black bear and wild turkey along the trail, as well as waterfowl and neotropical birds during the spring and fall migrations.Splitrock gets a new parking lot, Daily Record  Parking  A 25-vehicle parking area for visitors was developed on November 23, 2003. The new parking area provides reservoir access for people who want to launch a car top boat for fishing, kayaking or canoeing. It is the only launch the public is permitted to use. Parking on Split Rock Road is prohibited and is patrolled by Rockaway Township police. The parking area also provides a trailhead for hiking the loop trail. This hike and another loop hike are described in \\"Hiking the Jersey Highlands\\", an illustrated guide to 35 hikes in the Highlands of New Jersey, with a trail map for each hike, introductory chapters on Highlands history and preservation, geology, plants, and wildlife, and a special 16-page insert of color photos of wildflowers seen along the trails. This book is published by the New York-New Jersey Trail Conference. This new parking area will provide generations of anglers, hikers and wildlife watchers with countless opportunities to explore all that Splitrock Reservoir has to offer. There is also a Clivus toilet at the parking area but no public telephone, and cell phone reception is generally poor unless you are out on the water.

Waiting was screened at more than a dozen festivals, including the Thai Short Film and Video Festival, where it won a special merit award, the Barcelona Asian Pacific Short Film Festival, where it won best short, and the Torino Film Festival where it won the Cinemavvenire Award for Best Short Film. In 2002, Aditya directed Pru Raw Velvet: A Concert Documentary, for the Thai rock band Pru, working with a childhood friend, Kamol \\"Suki\\" Sukosol Clapp, a member of the band. The 120-minute feature was screened on both Channel V Thailand and MTV Thailand. =3 Friends= In 2003, Aditya won the Hubert Bals Award at the International Film Festival Rotterdam, and was invited to take part in the Pusan Promotional Plan. Aditya also participated in the Annenberg Film Fellows Program at the Sundance Institute that same year.Mentors and Proteges, Filmmaker, May 28, 2004; retrieved 2007-11-05 During the year, Aditya helped develop an experimental feature film, 3 Friends (Ma-Mee), which had a limited release, including a screenings at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival, where it premiered, and the 2006 Bangkok International Film Festival.Ma-Mee (2005) Release dates, Internet Movie Database; retrieved 2007-11-05 He co-directed the film with Mingmongkol Sonakul and Pumin Chinaradee. It starred actress Napakpapha Nakprasitte, playing herself, in a film that was part documentary, part parody of the reality television phenomenon. =Pop Pictures= In 2006, Aditya and friends Soros Sukhum and Jetnipith Teerakulchanyut formed their own production company, Pop Pictures, making television commercials, music videos, TV programs and films. One of the company's works is Dreamchaser, a Thai reality television series. For the first season, shown in 2006, documented a cross motorcycle journey around Thailand by Aditya's friend, musician Suki Sukosol Clapp of Pru. The second season, set for 2007-08, is to feature Suki travelling with actor Ananda Everingham in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. =Wonderful Town= Also in 2006, Aditya was working on his first feature- length drama film, Wonderful Town set in post-tsunami Phang Nga Province, which premiered in 2007 and has since been shown and won awards at several film festivals. =Hi-So= Hi-So was screened at the Berlinale 2011 Film Festival. In an interview, Aditya explains that Hi-So was originally the first film he worked on after grad school, but ended up working on and releasing Wonderful Town first. The title Hi-So means \\"high society\\" and Aditya expresses that his film focuses on \\"the opportunities of people who have things and people who don't. And the biggest difference is in your mind. Some people would feel uncomfortable walking into a Prada store, just like some people are uncomfortable walking into a slum. I wanted to talk about the differences that exist in your head.\\" Working methods Aditya has remained an independent filmmaker, despite an offer to direct a film for a major Thai studio. \\"It wouldn't have worked. It was too far removed from my filmmaking style. But if the studio is willing to make the film with me, in my own style, it's worth trying. It would be difficult, though. There's not much of a market for alternative films here [in Thailand],\\" he said in a 2007 interview. Having been educated outside Thailand for many years, Aditya says he feels more comfortable writing his scripts in English language, which then must be translated into the Thai language. \\"It's the one real dilemma in my filmmaking. I haven't yet really worked through it,\\" he said in a 2007 interview. \\"But it's annoying as it slows everything down. What I want to say on film still has to go through someone else. I'll try to solve the problem in my next film by making my main character more like me - a Thai who's grown up overseas and speaks English for half the story.\\" References External links *Pop Pictures * *Aditya Assarat at Cinemasia Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:People from Bangkok Category:USC School of Cinematic Arts alumni Category:New York University alumni Category:Thai film directors Category:Thai screenwriters Category:Thai cinematographers Category:Thai film producers Category:Silpathorn Award winners ","title":"Aditya Assarat"},{"id":"14089009","text":"Ida of Lorraine (also referred to as Blessed Ida of Boulogne) (c. 1040 - 13 April 1113) was a saint and noblewoman. She was the daughter of Godfrey III, Duke of Lower Lorraine and his wife Doda. Ida's grandfather was Gothelo I, Duke of Lorraine and Ida's brother was Godfrey IV, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Family In 1049, she married Eustace II, Count of Boulogne. They had three sons: *Eustace III, the next Count of Boulogne *Godfrey of Bouillon, first ruler of Kingdom of Jerusalem *Baldwin, second ruler of Kingdom of Jerusalem A daughter, Ida of Boulogne, has also been postulated. She was married first to Herman von Malsen and second to Conon, Count of Montaigu. Ida shunned the use of a wet-nurse in raising her children. Instead, she breast-fed them to ensure that they were not contaminated by the wet-nurse's morals, i.e. her mode of living. When her sons went on the First Crusade, Ida contributed heavily to their expenses. Life Ida was always religiously and charitably active, but the death of her husband provided her wealth and the freedom to use it for her projects. She founded several monasteries: *Saint-Wulmer in Boulogne-sur-Mer *Our Lady of the Chapel, Calais *Saint-Bertin *Abbey of Cappelle *Abbey of Le Wast She maintained a correspondence with Anselm of Canterbury. Some of Anselm's letters to Ida have survived. She became increasingly involved in church life. However, current scholarship feels that she did not actually become a Benedictine Nun, but that she was a \\"Secular Oblate of the Benedictine Order\\". Death and burial Ida died on 13 April 1113, which is the date she is honoured. Traditionally, her burial place has been ascribed to the monastery of Le Wast. Her remains were moved in 1669 to Paris and again in 1808 to Bayeux. Her life story was written by contemporary monk of the monastery of Le Wast. She is venerated in Bayeux.

Function  Cyclin B1 is a regulatory protein involved in mitosis. The gene product complexes with p34 (Cdk1) to form the maturation- promoting factor (MPF). Two alternative transcripts have been found, a constitutively expressed transcript and a cell cycle-regulated transcript that is expressed predominantly during G2/M phase of the cell cycle. The different transcripts result from the use of alternate transcription initiation sites. Cyclin B1 contributes to the switch-like all or none behavior of the cell in deciding to commit to mitosis. Its activation is well-regulated, and positive feedback loops ensure that once the cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex is activated, it is not deactivated. Cyclin B1-Cdk1 is involved in the early events of mitosis, such as chromosome condensation, nuclear envelope breakdown, and spindle pole assembly. Once activated, cyclin B1-Cdk1 promotes several of the events of early mitosis. The active complex phosphorylates and activates 13S condensin, which helps to condense chromosomes. Another important function of the cyclin B1-Cdk1 complex is to break down the nuclear envelope. The nuclear envelope is a membranous structure containing large protein complexes supported by a network of nuclear lamins. Phosphorylation of the lamins by cyclin B1-Cdk1 causes them to dissociate, compromising the structural integrity of the nuclear envelope so that it breaks down. The destruction of the nuclear envelope is important because it allows the mitotic spindle to access the chromosomes.  Regulation  Cyclin B1 accumulates throughout the cell cycle but must be activated. It is degraded at the end of mitosis and accumulates again during the next cell cycle. Like all cyclins, levels of cyclin B1 oscillate over the course of the cell cycle. Just prior to mitosis, a large amount of cyclin B1 is present in the cell, but it is inactive due to phosphorylation of Cdk1 by the Wee1 kinase. The complex is activated by dephosphorylation by the phosphatase Cdc25. Cdc25 is always present in the cell but must be activated by phosphorylation. A possible trigger for activation is phosphorylation by cyclin A-Cdk, which functions before cyclin B1-Cdk in the cell cycle. Active Cdk1 is also capable of phosphorylating and activating Cdc25 and thus promote its own activation, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Once cyclin B1-Cdk1 is activated, it remains stably active for the rest of mitosis. Another mechanism by which cyclin B1-Cdk1 activity is regulated is through subcellular localization. Before mitosis almost all cyclin B1 in the cell is located in the cytoplasm, but in late prophase it relocates to the nucleus. This is regulated by the phosphorylation of cyclin B1, in contrast to phosphorylation of Cdk1 regulating the activity of the complex. Phosphorylation of cyclin B1 causes it to be imported to the nucleus, and phosphorylation also prevents export from the nucleus by blocking the nuclear export signal. Cyclin B1 is phosphorylated by Polo kinase and Cdk1, again setting up a positive feedback loop that commits cyclin B1-Cdk1 to its fate. At the end of mitosis, cyclin B1 is targeted for degradation by the APC through its APC localization sequence, permitting the cell to exit mitosis.  Interactions  Cyclin B1 has been shown to interact with Cdk1, GADD45A and RALBP1.  Cancer  One of the hallmarks of cancer is the lack of regulation in the cell cycle. The role of cyclin B1 is to transition the cell from G2 to M phase but becomes unregulated in cancer cells where overexpression of cyclin B1 can lead to uncontrolled cell growth by binding to its partner Cdks. Binding of Cdks can lead to phosphorylation of other substrates at inappropriate time and unregulated proliferation. This is a consequence of p53, tumor suppressor protein, being inactivated. Wild-type p53 have been shown to suppress cyclin B1 expression. Previous work has shown that high cyclin B1 expression levels are found in variety of cancers such as breast, cervical, gastric, colorectal, head and neck squamous cell, non-small-cell lung cancer, colon, prostate, oral and esophageal. High expression levels are usually seen before the tumor cells become immortalized and aneuploid which can contribute to the chromosomal instability and the aggressive nature of certain cancers. These high levels of cyclin B1 can also be associated to the extent of tumor invasion and aggressiveness therefore concentration of cyclin B1 can be used to determine the prognosis of cancer patients. For example, an increase in expression of cyclin B1/cdc2 is significantly higher in breast tumor tissue and shown to increase lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. Cyclin B1 can reside in the nucleus or the cytoplasm which can have an effect on the malignant potential of cyclin B1 when overexpressed in each location. Nuclear-dominant expression of cyclin B1 leads to poorer prognosis due to its weak activity compared to cytoplasmic cyclin B1. This trend has been observed in esophageal cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and breast cancer. = Down regulation and tumor suppression = While the exact mechanism that explains how cyclin B1 becomes overexpressed is not very well understood, previous work has shown that down regulation of cyclin B1 can lead to tumor regression. A possible treatment option for tumor suppression is to deliver gene or protein to target the degradation of cyclin B1. Previous work done has shown that cyclin B1 is essential for tumor cell survival and proliferation and that a decrease in expression levels only leads to tumor-specific and not normal cell death. Reduction of cyclin B1 can stop cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and triggers cell death by preventing the chromosomes from condensing and aligning. The specific downregulation of cyclin B1, however, did not influence other molecules that facilitated the transition from the G2 to M phase such as Cdk1, Cdc25c, Plk1 and cyclin A. Therefore the delivery of a therapeutic gene to correct these mutations is a viable treatment option for tumor suppression. = Tumor antigen = In early stages of cancer when the cyclin B1 concentration is high, it is recognized by the immune system, leading to the production of antibodies and T cells. It would then be possible to take advantage of this to monitor the immune response for early cancer detection. An ELISA (Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) can be performed to the measure the antibodies recognizing cyclin B1. = Breast cancer = Cyclin B1 expression levels can be used as a tool to determine prognosis of patients with breast cancers. The intracellular concentration can have important implications for cancer prognosis. High levels of nuclear cyclin B1 is associated with high tumor grade, larger tumor size and higher metastasis probability, therefore a high level of cyclin B1 is a predictor of poor prognosis. = Lung cancer = Studies in non-small cell lung cancer demonstrated that high levels of cyclin B1 are associated with poorer prognosis. The study also found that this correlation between expression levels was only found in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. This finding indicates the possibility of using cyclin B1 expression as a prognostic marker for patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer.

She was the lead ship of her class, the first modern warship designed and built in Canada.Macpherson and Barrie (2002), p. 244 St. Laurent was laid down on 24 November 1950 by Canadian Vickers at Montreal. She was launched on 30 November the following year and was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 29 October 1955 and initially carried the pennant number DDE 205 as a destroyer escort. Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent was present at her commissioning. She was reported to have cost $15,000,000 to build. She underwent conversion to a destroyer helicopter escort (DDH) in the early 1960s and was officially re-classed with pennant DDH 205 on 4 October 1963. Design and description The need for the St. Laurent class came about in 1949 when Canada joined NATO and the Cold War was in its infancy. The Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) was assigned responsibility for anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and controlling sea space in the western North Atlantic. The St Laurent class were built to an operational requirement much like that which produced the British Type 12, and were powered by the same machinery plant. The rounded deck-edge forward was adopted to prevent ice forming.Friedman, p. 161 The vessels were designed to operate in harsh Canadian conditions. They were built to counter nuclear, biological and chemical attack conditions, which led to a design with a rounded hull, a continuous main deck, and the addition of a pre- wetting system to wash away contaminants.

Following the conversion, the displacement remained the same at standard load but at full load, it increased to . Operational history After commissioning, St. Laurent was sent to the United States to work up and be evaluated and then proceeded to visit the United Kingdom. While there the ship was part of the escort for the royal yacht on a state visit to Sweden. She was then stationed to the west coast where she performed various diplomatic duties. Prior to undergoing her conversion to a DDH, she was test fitted with the variable depth sonar (VDS). In 1959 the Canadian government ordered that the St. Laurent class be modernized, even though the class was relatively new. This was based on the fact that the St. Laurent class was no longer capable of fighting the new nuclear submarines entering service.Tracy, p. 131 This was done to extend the detection range of the ships and to eliminate any speed advantage of the nuclear submarines.German, pp. 243‚Äì244Tracy, p. 134 St. Laurent was a member of the Second Canadian Escort Squadron in 1960 based out of Esquimalt, British Columbia. In February 1960, St. Laurent, with two sister ships, departed Esquimalt, British Columbia performed a training cruise around the Pacific making several port visits and returning in April. In March 1961, St. Laurent, Ottawa and deployed with the United States Navy's Carrier Division 17 off Hawaii.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), p. 36 Prior to undergoing her DDH conversion, a Variable Depth Sonar (VDS) system was test fitted to the ship, which required the alteration of the stern. The ship then underwent the DDH refit in 1962, emerging on 4 October 1963. This meant extensively rebuilding the superstructure. A hangar and flight deck were added and to make room for these the original single stack was twinned. The flight deck addition required the removal of one gun and one Limbo mount. The ship was then assigned to the east coast. In 1964, with and , St. Laurent sailed on a training cruise to the Pacific.German, p. 278 In 1966, Canada sent St. Laurent and to the Bahamas to participate in their independence celebrations, the only country to send warships.Tracy, p. 147 In 1969, the ship tracked a Cuban-bound Soviet task force that was transiting through Canadian waters. St. Laurent experienced keel damage later in her career and was paid off early as the Canadian Forces opted to not include her in the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program of the 1970s. She was decommissioned from the Canadian Forces on 14 June 1974 and sat in Halifax as a source for spare parts for her sisters. Her early decommissioning is attributed to cost-cutting in the Canadian Forces at the time.Milner, p. 273 The ship was sold on 27 September 1979 to Dartmouth Salvage Co. for scrapping.Colledge, p. 353 St. Laurent was resold and while en route to breakers in Brownsville, Texas, she took on water in the tail end of a hurricane and foundered off Cape Hatteras on 12 January 1980.

In 1962, with and , the ship took part in the large naval exercise JETEX 62 in the Pacific.Barrie and Macpherson (1996), pp. 25‚Äì26 On 25 September 1964 the ship began her conversion to a helicopter carrying destroyer (DDH) at Victoria Machinery Depot. The ship completed her refit on 15 October 1965 and transferred to the east coast. In 1968, the ship was a part of the Seventh Canadian Escort Squadron. In January 1973, Assiniboine and auxiliary ship were deployed to Standing Naval Force Atlantic (STANAVFORLANT), NATO's standing fleet. This was the first time two Canadian warships deployed together. In June 1973, Margaree collided with the fisheries research vessel Cygnus. In September 1976, Margaree took part in the major NATO naval exercise Teamwork 76. On 1 April 1979, Margaree sank the bow section of the commercial ship Kurdistan, which had broken in half on 15 March. The bow had been towed roughly south of Halifax. The vessel was selected by the Canadian Forces for the Destroyer Life Extension (DELEX) program and completed this refit on 28 November 1980. The refit was begun by Vickers Ltd. at Montreal on 5 May 1980. However the hull was towed to HMC Dockyard at Halifax when it appeared that the ship would be ice-bound before completion. In 1981, Margaree was pulled out of a major naval exercise due to cracks in their boiler heads. Following her DELEX refit, Margaree served several times with STANAVFORLANT. On 8 February 1991, two divers from Margaree drowned when conducting an inspection of the seawater intake pipes of the American frigate while in port at Funchal, Portugal, after becoming trapped. In August 1991, the ship took part in the re-enactment at Argentia of the signing of the Atlantic Charter, a pivotal policy of the Second World War. Margaree was paid off from active service in the Canadian Forces on 2 May 1992. The vessel was sold to Global Shipping Company of Tampa, Florida on 3 February 1994.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene is a protein-tyrosine kinase that is predominantly expressed in hemopoietic cell types, and belongs to the Src family of tyrosine kinases. The encoded protein may help couple the Fc receptor to the activation of the respiratory burst. In addition, it may play a role in neutrophil migration and in the degranulation of neutrophils. Alternate translation initiation site usage, including a non-AUG (CUG) codon, results in the production of two different isoforms, that have different subcellular localization.  Interactions  HCK has been shown to interact with: * ADAM15 * BCR gene, * Cbl gene, * ELMO1, * Granulocyte colony- stimulating factor receptor, * RAPGEF1, * RAS p21 protein activator 1, and * RASA3.

Bulbulian ( Art'ur Bulbulyan; December 20, 1900 - June 23, 1996) was a pioneer of Armenian descent in the field of facial prosthetics. His work as a part of the Mayo Clinic Aero Medical Unit led to his being credited with the creation of the A-14 oxygen mask for the United States Air Force in 1941. The A-14 fighter pilot's mask was frost proof, and included a microphone for radio communication, and allowed the pilot to talk and eat while wearing it. He was a member of the team which included Drs. W. Randolph Lovelace and Walter M. Boothby, which developed the BLB (Boothby, Lovelace and Bulbulian) nasal and orinasal oxygen mask, which was useful for clinical settings, and, as it turned out, for aviators at high altitudes. The BLB and A-14 oxygen mask was used in combat in World War II . Dr. Bulbulian also was the first director of the Mayo Medical Museum, and as such, developed content with staff doctors, and built the exhibits. This was the first medical museum in the United States. He also designed and created the exhibits for the Mayo Clinic's display at the 1933 \\"A Century of Progress Exposition,\\" at the Chicago Worlds Fair. Born in 1900 near Caesarea, Ottoman Empire, he moved to the United States in 1920. He attended Middlebury College, where he received a B.S. and M.S. degree in Science. He did more graduate work at Brown University and the University of Iowa. In 1928, he entered the University of Minnesota School of Dentistry, and received the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery. In 1931 he was appointed as an instructor in orthodontics at the same school.

It is also sometimes referred to as \\"ubiquitin conjugating enzyme E2I\\" or \\"ubiquitin carrier protein 9\\", even though these names do not accurately describe its function.  Expression  Four alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same protein have been found for this gene.  Function  The UBC9 protein encoded by the UBE2I gene constitutes a core machinery in the cell's sumoylation pathway. Sumoylation is a process in which a Small Ubiquitin-like MOdifier (SUMO) is covalently attached to other proteins in order to modify their behaviour. For example, sumoylation may affect a protein's localization in the cell, its ability to interact with other proteins or DNA. UBC9 performs the third step in the sumoylation life cycle: the conjugation step. When SUMO protein precursors are first expressed, they first undergo a maturation step in which the four C-terminal amino acids are removed, revealing a di-glycine motif. In a second step, an E1 activating complex binds to SUMO at its di-glycine and passes it on to the E2 protein Ubc9, where it forms a thioester bond with a cysteine residue within Ubc9's catalytic pocket. The loaded Ubc9 is now ready to perform the sumoylation of its various target proteins (also called substrates). It recognizes a particular motif of amino acid residues in these substrates: A large hydrophobic residue, followed by a lysine, followed by a spacer, followed by an acidic residue. This motif is usually described in shorthand as Œ®KxD/E. The central lysine within the substrate's recognition motif is inserted into the catalytic pocket. There the carbolxyl terminus of SUMO's di-glycine forms a peptide bond with the Œµ-amino group of the lysine. This process can be assisted by an E3 ligase protein. The sumoylation process is reversible. SENP proteases can remove SUMO from sumoylated proteins, freeing it to be used in further sumoylation reactions.  Clinical significance relevance  The protein UBC9 encoded by the UBE2I gene has been shown to be targeted by multiple viruses, including HIV and HPV. It has been hypothesized that these viruses hijack UBC9 to serve their own purposes.  Interactions  UBE2I has been shown to interact with: * ATF2, * Androgen receptor, * BLMH, * DACH1, * DNMT3A, * DNMT3B, * DAXX, * ETS1, * FHIT, * IPO13, * MAP3K1 and * MITF, * P53, * PIAS1, * PIAS2, * RAD51, * RANBP2, * RANGAP1, * SAE2, * SALL1, * SUMO1, * TCF3, * TNFRSF1A, * TOP1, and * WT1.

History =Early years= The building, designed by Messrs Giles, Gough and Trollope of London followed the compact arrow plan and was built at a cost of ¬£126,000. Originally named the Brecon and Radnor Joint Counties Lunatic Asylum, it was opened amid public ceremony on 18 March 1903, by the Rt. Hon. Lord Glanusk who said of it \\"everything has been done that human ingenuity could devise for the happiness and safety of the inmates, and under the blessing of God, for their speedy restoration to health.\\" Like other contemporary institutions, the asylum was designed to be self-sufficient, and had its own private water, electricity, heating and sewerage systems as well as a considerable agricultural estate on which able-bodied patients worked to produce food for the hospital. As well as residential wards, the hospital had a large recreation and dining hall, kitchens, workshops \\"in which the patients [were] encouraged to spend their time profitably\\", a tailor, bakery, shoe- maker and printing shops as well as 8 acres of market gardens. Initially dedicated to treating patients from the counties of Brecknockshire and Radnorshire, after the First World War, patients from Montgomeryshire were also admitted, and the asylum was extended and renamed the Mid-Wales Counties Mental Hospital. During the Second World War the hospital took in 67 male and 48 female patients from Cardiff City Mental Hospital which had been requisitioned as a war hospital. In July 1940 it was agreed that most of the hospital should be given over to military use and most of the patients were transferred to other Welsh mental hospitals. The hospital was returned to civilian use in 1947. In 1948 the hospital became part of the National Health Service. NHS management brought a number of innovations, including art and occupational therapy and the integration of the sexes, who had previously occupied opposite sides of the hospital. The site also became home to the Mid and West Wales College of Nursing and Midwifery and the Powys Drugs & Alcohol Council for substance misuse. Other services included treatments for the elderly mentally ill, rehabilitation and continuing care, day care, reflexology, physiotherapy, electro-convulsive therapy; chiropody and psychiatry. =Decline and sale= After the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s the hospital went into a period of decline and it finally closed in 1999. Some facilities moved into nearby Bronllys Hospital (formerly the South Wales Sanitorium). Following closure, the buildings and surrounding estate were sold to the former Chief Medical Officer for just ¬£227,000. Plans were subsequently made to redevelop the site as business park, and indeed several buildings were converted and occupied by local companies as part of the Black Mountains Business Park. However, due to the site's isolated location and the global recession, the venture failed and only one or two businesses remained on the site by early 2009. In 2009 the site was offered for sale. By this time, several properties that once belonged to the hospital, such as the gatehouse, had been sold off and the buildings were becoming derelict. There are signs of demolition throughout the site and many of the original slates (believed to be worth in excess of ¬£1 million) were stripped from the roofs. The large derelict site has recently become an attraction to many urban explorers despite improved security measures.

It is a prominent peak in the long and impressive escarpment facing north and running roughly east‚Äìwest of the central section of the Brecon Beacons. The summit lies on a ridge stretching from Talybont Reservoir in the east, to the A470 road. The ridge line to the west connects Cribyn with the peak of Pen y Fan. To the east, the ridge line descends to Bwlch ar y Fan, a col crossed by an ancient trail sometimes known as 'The Gap Road' before ascending again to the peak of Fan y Big. Geology Cribyn and the top of Cwm Sere from Pen y Fan In common with other peaks of the Brecon Beacons, the upper slopes of Cribyn are formed from sandstones of the Brownstones Formation of the Old Red Sandstone laid down during the Devonian period. The lower slopes of the hill are formed from sandstones and mudstones of the underlying Senni Beds Formation. The rock strata tilt gently southward like the rest of the peaks in the range. The heads of Cwm Sere and Cwm Cynwyn, to the northwest and east of Cribyn respectively, nurtured small glaciers during the last ice age and there are rock moraines at the foot of the cliffs. The glacial erosion resulted in the very steep northern and eastern faces which the hill possesses. Access Cribyn seen from Cefn Cwm Llwych The Brecon Beacons are of open access, so the visitor can walk anywhere in the highland zone. Trails and footpaths are well marked, and owing to frequent use, are also well trodden. The National Trust owns much of the land and the paths are well maintained and reinforced where wear and tear is heavy. The paths are intensively used by a wide cross section of society, such as the British Army for troop training, and by charity walks as well as by walkers and ramblers. The peak is adjacent to Pen y Fan so is often chosen for circular walks along the main escarpment. When the weather is clear, the views to the north are especially impressive towards Mynydd Epynt, Brecon and the Cambrian mountains beyond. Care is needed in mist or fog when walking near the edge of the escarpment, especially in snow and ice when all surfaces become very slippery. Because the rainfall is high in this elevated mountain zone, care is also needed owing to the high levels of surface water. Thunderstorms can be especially hazardous owing to lightning strikes. Wildlife Peregrine falcon in flight Buzzard in flight (Devon, England) Many mountain birds are present, such as birds of prey like peregrine falcons, common buzzards and the red kite. Ravens can also be seen occasionally, and more often heard by their deep croak. They use thermals in the valleys around the peaks to soar and search for food such as mice and voles. The lower parts of the moorland adjacent to the peaks is used for nesting by skylarks as well as some game birds like red grouse and partridges. The skylark can frequently be seen soaring and heard singing above its nest.

Dan Band, that he co-founded with film/TV actor Gary Sinise. While he is perhaps best known for his work with the Lt. Dan Band, Williams has worked on a number of other projects including: award- winning photography, releasing four CDs, writing a stageplay and working on an opera based on the Courts Martial of Henry O Flipper, the first black graduate from West Point. Cognizant of the opportunities he had, as well as those he did not due to a childhood in which he moved often, Williams speaks to students about his history, their future and their need to combat mediocrity. Background James Kimo Williams was born in Amityville, New York, and spent much of his childhood divided between Air Force bases, and on his grandparents‚Äô sharecropper farm in North Carolina, where he picked tobacco, plowed fields and tended livestock on their rural farm. In 1968, he moved to Hawaii to join his father (a career Air Force Sergeant) and attended Leilehua High School. A dedicated, but inexperienced guitar player, he also took up sports and was an all-star football performer with a scholarship invitation from Arizona State. The night before enlisting in the US Army on July 4, 1969, he attended his first major music concert: Jimi Hendrix playing at the Waikiki Bowl. He was so inspired by this concert and the music of Jimi Hendrix, that he dedicated himself to music and playing guitar. After leaving Vietnam in 1970, Williams used his GI Benefit and attended the Berklee College of Music. While a student he founded The Paumalu Symphony, now known as Kimotion. After teaching at Berklee for one year, he graduated in 1976 with a BA in Composition. In 1976 Williams met his music partner and future wife Carol, a fellow Berklee student and married two years later. Career =Military= After basic training, he was sent to Vietnam (the day after his 20th birthday), where he served with a unit of the 20th Combat Engineer Brigade in Lai Khe, building roads and clearing land in the jungle. One of Williams' earliest, and most often cited, musical opportunities was in Vietnam when an Army entertainment director heard him play and suggested that he perform for the troops in the field. The Soul Coordinators was born of this request and started Kimo Williams' long resume of performances, both with bands and on his own. After completing his studies at Berklee College of Music marrying his wife in 1978, the couple together joined the Army Band program, spending a year with the 9th Infantry Division Band at Ft. Lewis, Washington. Kimo went on to attend Officer Candidate School and was commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant in 1980. His first assignment brought him to Fort Sheridan, IL: close enough to Chicago that he and Carol could continue producing and performing with his large ensemble (now called ‚ÄúKimotion‚Äù) and their small-group ‚ÄúWilliams and Williams‚Äù, in local clubs and concert venues. They set up a music publishing company (One Omik Music), as well as launched their own record company (Little Beck Music). To record their music, they rehabbed an old storefront in Chicago, and built and operated a recording studio there. In 1983 he earned his MA in Management from Webster University. When he left the army in 1987 to pursue composing full-time he had risen to the rank of Captain. He taught at Sherwood Conservatory of Music in Chicago, and in the Music Department at Columbia College Chicago. He completed his military service in the Army Reserves by becoming the Bandmaster for the 85th Division Army Reserve Band, and retired from the Army Reserves as a Chief Warrant Officer in 1996. =Music composition and academia= In 1997, Williams wrote the music for the Steppenwolf Theatre production of A Streetcar Named Desire, leading to his partnership with Gary Sinise and, in 2003, the creation of the Lt. Dan Band (named for Sinise's character in film Forrest Gump). Also in 1997, he directed the Goodman Theatre's production of the August Wilson play, ‚ÄúMa Rainey‚Äôs Black Bottom‚Äù. In 2008, Williams' Fanfare for Life was performed during the Alabama Symphony's annual musical tribute to Martin Luther King Jr. His compositions include works for chamber ensembles and orchestras and have been performed by groups worldwide, including the Czech National Symphony Orchestra and the Chicago Sinfonietta. In October 2013 a commission by Williams for the string quartet ETHEL was premiered at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.BAM New Wave Festival In 1996, he accepted a position in the Arts Entertainment and Media Management Department of Columbia College. He remains as of 2011 a tenured associate professor teaching music. Honors Kimo Williams was named Chicagoan of the Year in 2006 and was recognized for a lifetime of work including the 1998 founding of the United States Vietnam Art Program. In 1999, he received the Lancaster Symphony Orchestra's Composer Award and has been the recipient of honors from the Detroit Symphony Orchestra and the Savannah Symphony Orchestra. Buffalo Soldiers, one of his most well-known works, was the result of a commission by The West Point Academy to celebrate their 2002 Bicentennial. In 2007 he was named a Fulbright Program for his works in music, education and history.

Archie, the youngest of the Tea Folk  Tea Folk history  The Canadian copywriter John McGill Lewis (1929‚Äì2009) of the advertising agency McCann Erickson originated the Tetley Tea Folk in 1973, working with art director Peter Rigby, who created the original characters of the Tea Folk, before briefing Wyatt Cattaneo to animate them.Lewis came to the United Kingdom in the 1950s, after a time working in Toronto, and then in New York. He came to London on the first stage of a planned excursion around the world, but when he discovered how much he loved London, he decided to make the city his home, and he lived in London until his death in 2009. The animated commercials were produced at Wyatt Cattaneo studios, where the Gaffer, Sidney, and supporting characters were animated by studio director Tony Cattaneo and animator Ramon Modiano. The series, from its start until the early 1980s, combined animation with live action sets and \\"props\\", such as real tea bags, cups, saucers, etc. The live action was first of all shot at the studios of Morgan and Mount, and later by Perkins StClaire. The series, from its start until the early 1980s, were animated by Ramon Modiano. The musical score for the \\"Tea Folk\\" song was composed by Ken Jones, with the lyrics coming from their originator J. M. Lewis. The art director was Peter Rigby. Towards the end of the 1970s, the Tetley Tea Folk account moved to the advertising agency D'Arcy, MacMannus and Macius. The line \\"That's Better. That's Tetley\\" was written by Jack Stephens, and ran on Tetley advertising for over eighteen years. From the early 1980s, Tetley's advertising was written and produced by the advertising agency D'Arcy, while the Tea Folk illustrations and advertisements were then animated by animator Richard Ollive. There have been sixty-seven animated television adverts, and many appearances in papers, magazines, on packs, radio, the internet, as well as Tea Folk memorabilia. Over thirty million Tea Folk items have been sold, and items from the Tetley Tea Folk can now be found in over five million homes in the United Kingdom. The Tea Folk have provided some of the most memorable advertising on Britain's television screens. Some well known lines include: * Tetley make tea bags make tea. * That's Better. That's Tetley. * Only Tetley will do. These, along with the original Tetley tune, and some notable soundtracks (Bill Withers‚Äô \\"Lovely Day\\", Irving Berlin‚Äôs \\"Keep Me Warm\\", and \\"Reach Out I‚Äôll Be There\\" by Holland, Holland and Dozier), have made Tetley‚Äôs Tea Folk adverts some of the most instantly recognisable ever seen. The characters' voices have been supplied by some distinguished actors throughout the campaign. For many years, Gaffer‚Äôs distinctive voice was provided by Brian Glover. He was later replaced by former Emmerdale star Bobby Knutt, while Sunburns George Layton is the voice of Sidney. The Tetley Tea Folk were at No. 40 in Channel 4's 100 Greatest TV Ads. =The end of the Tetley Tea Folk= In 2001, Tetley released a statement: \\"As part of an overall review of the marketing of the Tetley Tea brand in the United Kingdom, we are re examining our Advertising Agency arrangements. We cannot speculate on what changes this may lead to, and cannot say at this stage how it might affect the use of the Tea Folk in the future.\\" The Tea Folk were eventually replaced with a more modern campaign, aimed at recruiting young tea drinkers. In July 2002, Tetley announced sales fell dramatically due to axing the Tea Folk. =Return= On 30 June 2010, by now a nine-year absence, it was announced that the Tetley Tea Folk were to be reintroduced, in a bid to reclaim the title of Britain's Best Tea Brand from PG Tips.http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/833610-it-s-a-tea-jerker-as-tetley-tea-folk- return The first advert was shown on 20 September 2010, during the broadcast of Coronation Street. It showed an employee of Tetley spilling some Tetley tea, which caused the Tea Folk to wake from their decade of sleep. The second advert, shown in October, showed the Tea Folk exploring the factory, to the general awe of the factory's workers. They remark on how far Tetley has come, with introductions of product lines such as Redbush, Green and Extra Strong tea. Their latest advert in April 2011 promoted the Redbush variety. On 25 January 2014, after a four-year break, the tea folk returned, this time in CGI form, where they inadvertently averted an invasion of aliens by giving them tea. In an advert in December 2014, it featured Gaffer, Sydney and Tina getting caught up in a medieval battle, but are able to stop the battle by giving everyone tea. In a later advert, Gaffer sings about how many British events (such as Winston Churchill, rock and roll and the Spirit of '66) would never have happened without tea. Characters =Gaffer= Gaffer and Tetley go back a long way. He has worked his way up from Tea Boy to become the boss of the Tetley Tea Folk. He first appeared as the star of the very first Tea Folk advert in 1973. He is a bit of a perfectionist; after all, making the best cup of tea in the world is a big responsibility and he truly understands just how important Tetley tea is to people. =Sydney= Sydney first appeared in 1975. He is a gentle and kind fellow, who is always on hand with a well made cup of Tetley tea in times of a crisis. Although he may not be the cleverest of people, his kind heart and occasional daftness mean that, even when he gets himself into trouble, he is well loved and highly thought of by his peers. He apparently went missing for many a year, which resulted in the phrase \\"Where's Sydney?\\" being used as its own advertising campaign. =Maurice= Maurice is the inventor, a mechanically minded engineering genius whose machines help to keep Tetley at the cutting edge of tea technology. He is quiet, unassuming and practical with sparks of inspiration - an eccentric and gloriously unpredictable inventor constantly striving for excellence on behalf of Tetley. Maurice first appeared in 1982. =Clarence= Clarence first appeared in 1988, originally the \\"Waker Upper\\" who makes sure the hard working Tea Folk all get to work on time. He is fun loving, happy and exuberant, a young, cheeky character, whose occasional over-enthusiasm has been known to earn him a kindly reprimand from Gaffer, although it is always for his own good. When it comes to his tea duties, Clarence is a serious hard worker, who is learning to take more responsibility. =Gordon= Gordon, who first appeared in 1989, is the Tea Folk gardener. He is quiet, gentle and dependable. Gordon is the quiet, knowledgeable caretaker, who lovingly and methodically maintains the Tetley Tea Garden. With his love of tea and knowledge of gardening he has personally cultivated the Tetley Tea Rose. =Tina= Tina first appeared in 1990. She is caring, fun loving and helpful. Tina has a special place in the hearts of all the team of Tetley Tea Folk. Her straightforward approach to life means that she is often called upon to provide a listening and understanding ear. =Archie= Archie first appeared in 1993, and is the youngest of the Tea Folk. He is Gaffer‚Äôs nephew, and although he is fascinated by Tetley Tea, and is being nurtured to one day step into Gaffer‚Äôs famous slippers, he is still at school. Archie is full of life and always inquisitive. This enquiring and mischievous nature occasionally lands him in deep water, until his Uncle Gaffer helps him out. Tetley Tea Folk collectibles A wide range of collectibles have been produced focusing on the subject of the Tetley Tea Folk. Tetley has teamed up with some big name companies (including Wade and Lledo). According to Collecticus magazine, a gold trimmed Morris Minor money box, released in September 2006, is the most valuable of the collectables, worth as much as ¬£200 on the secondary market.

Early life Born 31 March 1979 in Birkenhead, Cairns attended Wirral Grammar School for Boys where he made his first representative appearances for the North Under-16s, followed by games at colts level for London and England while playing for Wirral Rugby Club. An all round sportsman, he also had trials for Liverpool F.C.. He then attended Brunel University, playing at the time for England Students. Playing career =Saracens 1998‚Äì2003= Cairns' first professional club was Saracens, joining the club's academy system and making two appearances for the first team as a substitute in the 1998‚Äì99 season, followed by a debut appearance in the starting line up the following season, along with several more bench appearances. In his third season he made several appearances in Saracens starting XVs and also recorded his maiden try. In the 2001‚Äì02 and 2002‚Äì03 seasons Cairns was making regular first team appearances, with 2003 bringing another step up the international ladder, touring with the England Saxons in their Churchill Cup campaign.

In the 2006‚Äì07 season he passed the 150 cap mark for Saracens in all competitions. In the same season he reached another landmark when he was called up to the full England side for their summer tour to South Africa, earning his first, and to date, only cap as a replacement during the first test against the Springboks on 26 May 2007 before falling victim to the virus that prevented many England players being considered for the second test. He signed a new contract with Saracens in 2006, that if completed will see Cairns mark ten years of service with the club. Following the 2008/09 season Cairns was one of the bunch who were released by Saracens. Cairns has recently signed with London club Harlequins and was named on the bench in the LV= Cup Match against The Llanelli Scarlet's.

One of the larger species within the genus, it produces pairs of leaves, sometimes whorled in threes or fours around particularly vigorous shoots on stems that generally arch elegantly outward from the base of the plant between in length. Trumpet-shaped, deep blue flowers occur in late summer into autumn. Like many members of the genus and indeed the family Gentianaceae, the roots have a close association with certain fungi in a similar way to the Orchidaceae and Ericaceae though of course completely unrelated to both of these families. This particular species is relatively easy to grow in most garden situations as long as it has plenty of organic material added to the soil. Gentiana asclepiadea likes moist, rich, well- drained soil in full sun or partial shade. The plant can be divided after flowering, however it seldom needs this. Propagate by seed sown as soon as the seed is ripe into a cold frame. If sowing the seed indoors then cold treatment is needed. This plant is susceptible to spider mites, slugs, snails and aphids.

She was built in 1981 by G√∂taverken, Gothenburg, Sweden, and first entered service in 1982 as MS Prinsessan Birgitta for Stena Sessan Line. She has also served under the names MS St Nicholas and MS Stena Normandy. Concept and construction The ship latterly known as MS Normandy was originally ordered from G√∂taverken in the late 1970s by Sessan Linjen, Sweden, with a planned delivery date in late 1981. Before the ship was completed, Sessan Linjen's main rival Stena Line purchased the majority of shares in Sessan, leading to the formation of Stena Sessan Line. After Stena acquired Sessan they cancelled the order for the new ship, and the shipyard were forced to complete her on their own account. Temporarily named MS GV 909 and registered in Gothenburg, the ship was completed in December 1981 and subsequently laid up in Gothenburg. Service history =1982-1983: Stena Line= In May 1982, Stena Sessan changed their mind and decided to purchase the GV 909 after all. The company wanted to name the ship Drottning Silvia in honour of Queen Silvia of Sweden, but the Royal Household of Sweden declined. Eventually the ship was named M/S Prinsessan Birgitta in honour Princess Birgitta, sister of King Carl XVI Gustav. Princess Brigitta herself christened the ship on 7 June 1982 (the ship had already entered traffic on 3 June). Prinsessan Birgittas service with Stena Sessan proved to be short, as she was chartered to Sealink in February 1983. =1983-1996: Sealink= Prior to entering service with Sealink, Prinsessan Birgitta was rebuilt at G√∂taverken with additional cabin facilities, renamed MS St Nicholas and registered under the flag of the United Kingdom, with London as her homeport. In June 1983, she was set on Sealink's Hoek van Holland‚ÄîHarwich route.Simplon Postcards: Prinsessan Birgitta, retrieved 12. 11. 2007 During the same month she was sold by Stena to Hill Samuel Trading Ltd, who continued chartering her to Sealink. In 1986 the ship was sold again, this time to a group of Stena subsidiaries. During the following two years she was sold three more times from one Stena subsidiary to another. None of these sales had any effect on her traffic, but in 1988 her homeport was changed to Nassau, Bahamas. Stena Normandy entering the River Itchen, Southampton. In 1989, St Nicholas was sold again, this time to the Sweden-based Rederi AB Gotland, who continued to charter the ship to Sealink. In 1990 Stena Line took over the Sealink services and their former ship. In January 1991 St Nicholas was rebuilt at Lloyd Werft, Bremerhaven, Germany and renamed MS Stena Normandy. After briefly returning to the Hoek van Holland‚ÄîHarwich route, she was transferred to the Southampton‚ÄîCherbourg service in June 1991. She stayed on the service until November 1996 (her last passenger sailing for Stena being from Cherbourg to Southampton on 1 December), when her charter agreement to Stena expired and she was laid up in Dunkerque. =1997: Tallink= After being laid up for two months, Stena Normandy was chartered to Tallink, Estonia in January 1997 and renamed MS Normandy. She began service with Tallink on 23 April 1997, after being re- registered in Tallinn, Estonia. Her charter to Tallink ended on 30 December 1997, after which she reverted to Bahamian flag. =1998-2007: Irish Ferries= In January 1998 the Normandy was chartered to Irish Ferries and re- registered to Ireland. On 29 February 1998 she began service on their Rosslare‚ÄîPembroke Dock route, in April moving to Cork‚ÄîRoscoff and Rosslare‚ÄîCherbourg services. In 1999 Rederi AB Gotland sold her to Irish Ferries and during the same year she was re-registered to Hamilton, Bermuda. Between January and March 2000 Normandy interiors were rebuilt at a Polish shipyard. During the same docking side sponsons were added on her hull for improved stability. Following the refit she was placed on Irish Ferries services from Ireland to France. In February 2004 the ship was out of traffic for four days due to a conflict between Irish Ferries and their employees on board. The same was repeated between 27 November and 14 December 2005.

They belong to the family Oedemeridae, which are commonly known as false blister beetles. Wharf borers are present in all the states of the USA except for Florida. It takes about a year to develop from an egg to an adult. The insect is called the 'wharf borer' because the larval stage of this insect is often found on pilings and timbers of wharves, especially along coastal areas. The adult beetles can be identified via a black band across the end of both elytra, or wing covers. In addition, wharf borers can be distinguished from other members of the family Oedemeridae via the presence of a single spur on the tibia of the forelegs, and the distance between both eyes (twice the length of one eye). Eggs are oviposited on rotten wood where larvae hatch and burrow to feed on rotten wood. Adults do not feed and depend on stored energy reserves accumulated during the larval stage. They are considered to be a pest because they damage wood used in building infrastructures. Identification The female of this beetle will lay eggs in any damp, decaying timber, which has been attacked by fungus. The eggs are creamy white in colour, slightly curved with tapered ends. The larvae, also creamy white, is equipped with brown mandibles, ready to bore into the timber and feed on the wood. The adult insects are around 10‚Äì12 mm in length, yellowish to reddish orange in colour, with a long slender body and antennae half of its body length. The adult beetles can emerge from under the floor of buildings in quite large numbers, causing the occupants to think they may be being invaded by cockroaches. The beetles themselves are quite harmless. They may be distinguished from cockroaches by the black band across the end of both elytra. Another distinguishing feature is the three raised longitudinal lines on each wing case - a feature common to all beetles in the family Oedemeridae. There are only seven species of this family in the UK. In general, in size and form they resemble Soldier Beetles found on flowers. Natural history =Distribution and habitat= This is a cosmopolitan species. They can be found anywhere where there is moist and decaying wood, such as wharf timbers that are regularly submerged by a tidal flow river, for example near the River Thames. A survey by Pitman et al. (2003) revealed the wharf borer to be widespread in temperate countries. There were samples recorded in Australia, New Zealand, Japan, France, Denmark and Canada.Pitman, A., J., Jones, E. B. G., Jones, M. A., Oevering, P. 2003. An overview of the biology of the wharf borer beetle (Nacerdes melanura L., Oedermeridae) a pest of wood in marine structures. Biofouling, 19, 239-248. Pitman et al. (2003) further noted that wharf borers are widespread in the UK and Wales, with a few records in Scotland, but neither adults nor larvae were found in Ireland. This beetle is thought to be a native of the Great Lakes region of North America and has been reported to cause much damage to dock timber in this region. However, others believed that they were introduced to the New World from Europe by the lumber trade or by driftwood. There is still uncertainty in the scientific literature about the origin of the wharf borer.Balsbaugh Jr., E. U., Kopp, D.D., Scholl, C. 1979. The wharf borer, Nacerda melanura L., (Coleoptera: Oedemeridae) in North Dakota. The Coleopterists Bulletin, 33, 455-458. Wharf borer adults may be present in different types of habitats but larvae are almost always restricted to damp, rotten wood. Buried pieces of wood may also harbor the insects. It was said that there was an increase in numbers of this insect in London following the Second World War, when masses of timber became buried under the ground following bomb blasts. They were found beneath the floor of gasoline stations, apartments, and even telegraph poles. =Life cycle= Like all beetles, the wharf borer undergoes complete metamorphosis. The development time from egg to adult is about 12 months, and adults tend to emerge around June to late August in the U.K. Eggs are deposited on wood surfaces where they are subjected to temperature extremes. Egg longevity is reported to be 5‚Äì11 days. First instar larvae burrow about 1 cm beneath the surface of the wood after hatching, where soft-rot type degradation is evident.Pitman, A. J., Jones, A. M., Jones, E. B. G. 1993. The wharf borer Nacerdes melanura L., a threat to stored archeological timbers. Studies in Conservation, 4, 274-284. The larval stage is reported to last from up to 2 months to 2 years, during which time larvae digest cellulose and hemicellulose. Larvae produce the enzyme cellulase, which enables them to feed on rooting wood, similar to many wood-boring Coleopterans. Tunnels formed by larvae during burrowing through the wood can be 30 cm long . A certain head capsule size must be attained for larvae to pupate, which takes about 8.5 months to attain. The cream white Pupae are reported to last 6‚Äì17 days, the exact amount of time being influenced by temperature and relative humidity. At the onset of pupation, the abdomen is reduced and the head loses its prognathous form. After 3 days, the eyes start to be pigmented, followed by the mandibles at six days and the elytra at nine days. Pupae are capable of moving the abdomen from side to side. Adults are short-lived, non-feeding, free-living, able to fly, and can locate wood via olfactory cues. They emerge from the resting pupal stage between May and September, though are more often observed in June. Adults live for about 2‚Äì10 days under laboratory conditions, during which time they mate and lay eggs. Females are not substrate specific when choosing an oviposition site. Wharf borers are known to infest both hardwood and softwood. =Temperature- and relative humidity-dependent development= Temperature influences development of eggs, and eggs only develop within the range 20-30 ¬∞C. The upper temperature limit for eggs to hatch is approximately 30-35 ¬∞C. This may explain the absence of the wharf borer in tropical climates. Relative humidity also influences egg development, with the lower threshold being 20-40%. Females lay eggs at temperatures that are suitable for egg development. Temperature is the most important factor that influences the development of the larva and the pupa. Relative humidity and photoperiods do not adversely affect development. It is important to note that winter does not induce the larvae to pupate. In fact, lower temperatures increase the time for the larvae to attain the required head capsule size for pupation by virtue of a reduced metabolic rate. Adults emerge from the pupal stage at almost all relative humidities. This indicates that the pupal stage is more resistant to desiccation than eggs because, as eggs do not develop at relative humidities lower than 20% . Pupae are reported not to develop below 10 ¬∞C, or above 30 ¬∞C. At higher temperatures, adult longevity is greatly reduced. This is because insect activity increases, and therefore speeds up usage of stored energy reserves. Lower relative humidity also decreases longevity due to increased desiccation, especially with non-feeding adults and those without an external supply of water. Human Impact The wharf borer‚Äôs name is of importance to fisherman, sailors, and quarrymen who work along coastal areas. Damage done to old ships and docks by the wharf borer is a good indication of how old the vessels are as the beetles only attack old timber. The presence of wharf borers and the simultaneous destruction can be accepted as a safety precaution to repair docks and ships to avoid dangerous accidents. It is known as a secondary pest, because the larva mainly feed on damp and decaying wood found along waterways and coastlines. The network of tunnels form when wharf borer larvae burrow and ingest the rotten wood, weakening the mechanical support given by the wood. This leads to increased damages in plumbing and rotting timbers. Oak, poplar, and pine are some of the timbers attacked by the wharf borer, indicating its development in both soft and hard woods. It is best to correct the wood moisture problems and remove the source of infected decaying wood. The beetles, generally only a nuisance between June to August, can be controlled by the application of a residual insecticide (such as permethrin). This can be applied to the wall and floor junctions of dwellings and offices. These adults can also be simply vacuumed or picked up and discarded.Iowa Insect Information Notes: Wharf Borer. Department of Entomology Iowa State University. URL: http://www.ipm.iastate.edu/ipm/iiin/wharfbo.html The larvae is found to be a pest of telegraph poles and fences where dogs have urinated. In Toronto, a large number of adults were discovered in a newspaper office, especially attracted to toilets. In America, Drooz (1953) reported that the insect was responsible for very costly damage to foundations underneath buildings in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.To protect stored archaeological timbers from the damaging effects of wharf borers, a procedure has been developed to control the attacks. The first measure calls for checking the particular area for infestation by the insects. Next, the extent of infestation in the stored timbers is determined. Once the degree of damage has been recorded, the timbers need to be isolated and quarantined. The storage area and the infected timbers are subjected to an appropriate treatment system which is compatible with future conservation treatment systems. References *James R.

It belonged to the Fourth Battalion which was the Palmach's Staff Battalion, attached to the Palmach's Staff Battalion (the 4th Battalion). The division was in charge of underwater demolition and maritime activity units. The majority of their activities were related to the escorting of ships of Aliyah Bet, immigration ships (66 of them in all) bringing Jewish refugees from Europe by boat, despite the British White Paper of 1939 limiting Jewish immigration into Mandate Palestine. From August 1945 to May 1948, approximately seventy Palyamniks escorted close to 70,000 immigrants in 66 sea voyages, from Sweden in the north to Algeria in the south, France in the west to Romania in the east. They also escorted the arms ships that brought vital arms during the war. On the eve of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Palyam consisted of approximately four hundred marines, eighty of them were graduates of the marine officers course which was held in the Marine School near the Technion, and seventy of them graduates of the ship commanders course at kibbutz Sdot Yam. Headquarters of Palyam was located in kibbutz Sdot Yam, but the unit had installations in kibbutz Neve Yam, Ma'abarot, Giv'at HaShlosha, Shefayim and Yagur. On March 17, 1948, the Naval Service (the precursor of the Israeli Sea Corps) was formed, and the Palyam were ordered to join. Many of the Palyam members formed the core personnel and command of the Naval Service. In fact, most ship commanders during the first years of the Navy, and up to 1975, most of the Navy's commander-in-chiefs, were Palyam veterans.

He was one of the rare players to be All-American in both baseball and in football. He was an All-American quarterback in 1951, when he guided the Baylor Bears football team to the Orange Bowl; he threw for 26 career touchdowns in college. In 1952, he was named the All-American catcher by the American Baseball Coaches Association. That season, he set a school record with a .431 average; through 2008, he still ranked second in Baylor Bears baseball annals for best single-season average, behind Mickey Sullivan. Isbell played minor league baseball for the Boston Red Sox and Brooklyn Dodgers organizations. He also played five years of professional football in the Canadian Football League (CFL) as a defensive back with the Saskatchewan Roughriders. He is a member of the Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Professional playing career The National Football League's Washington Redskins picked Isbell in the first round of the 1952 NFL Draft, but he opted to sign with Major League Baseball's Boston Red Sox. The club sent him straight to AAA and he hit .266/.360/.337 for the Louisville Colonels in 1952, very similar numbers to the other Louisville catcher, former Major Leaguer Al Evans. Back with the Colonels in 1953, Isbell was even better at .317/.386/.397 in 47 games while fielding .995; he outhit Pete Daley, the starter at catcher. In fact, he had the best average of any Louisville batter with 25 or more games player, ahead of Charlie Maxwell, Harry Agganis, and Ken Aspromonte, among others. He also played three games for the Fort Worth Panthers, hitting .200. Isbell's baseball career ended despite those two productive seasons. He then signed with the Saskatchewan Roughriders of the Canadian Football League (CFL) and played for five years as an All-Star defensive back as well as a punter, quarterback and wide receiver. Later life and honors In 1977, Baylor began handing out the Larry Isbell MVP to its top baseball player. Isbell is a member of both the Baylor Hall of Fame and Texas Sports Hall of Fame. Isbell was living in Waco, Texas and working as a car salesman in Clifton, Texas when he died of a heart attack in 1978.

A saber arch is a wedding tradition in which sabers or swords are used to salute a newly married couple. The bride and groom pass under an honorary arch of sabers, typically when exiting the building in which the wedding ceremony took place. The tradition is in use worldwide. United States and United Kingdom In the United States and United Kingdom, the tradition is often performed at the weddings of military service members and had its origins in the Royal Navy. The tradition varies slightly among the different branches of the U.S. armed forces and is considered a privilege accorded to members of the service. Usually, an honor guard composed of officers or NCOs, often from the same unit as the service member, form the arch with sabers or swords. =The ceremony= Officers and enlisted personnel in the bridal party wear formal dress uniforms in accordance with seasonal regulations of the services. A female may wear a traditional bridal gown, or she may be married in uniform. White gloves are required for all saber or sword bearers, who are normally officers or NCOs. Military guests usually have the option to attend the wedding in uniform or appropriate civilian attire, but none may carry a saber or sword unless attired in a formal dress uniform. Immediately after the marriage ceremony is officiated, usually but not always in a building such as a church or chapel, the saber team positions itself in formation just outside the doorway, with typically six or eight saber bearers taking part. The guests of the wedding are afforded the opportunity to assemble outside to view the event before it begins. On the command, the saber team raises their sabers into a high arch, with tips nearly touching and the blades facing up and away from the bride and groom. As the newly married couple exits the building, the senior usher announces, \\"Ladies and gentlemen, it is my honor to present to you (Rank) and Mr/s. (insert name)\\" This is modified when both parties are in the military. The bride and groom proceed into the arch, and as the couple passes through, the last two saber bearers usually lower the sabers in front of the couple, detaining them momentarily. Before releasing the couple, the saber bearer to the couple's left gives the bride a gentle swat on her backside with his saber, announcing \\"Welcome to the (insert branch) Ma'am!\\" If the bride is in the military, this step is omitted. In some ceremonies, every pair of saber bearers may lower their sabers, stopping the couple from proceeding each time. One of the pair may say something along the lines of, \\"Kiss required to pass,\\" and the bearers will not raise their sabers until the bride and groom share a kiss. After the couple leaves the arch, the saber team recovers on command and dissolves formation. Only the bride and groom pass under the arch. It is also traditional at the wedding reception for the wedding cake to be cut with a saber or sword. Germany and Austria In Germany and Austria, saber arches are commonly employed by various types of male-only Studentenverbindungen (student fraternities). At weddings, the current officials ‚Äì usually a team of three ‚Äì salute their newlywed member and his bride by a single arch featuring a flag just outside the church. No further protocol is common. In a similar fashion, the aforementioned officials salute their deceased brothers at funerals. Usually walking directly behind the coffin bearers in the procession, they surround the grave from three sides at the graveyard. The saber arch is then presented from both sides, and the flag is raised above the head of the corpse. As the coffin is lowered into the earth, both the saber arch and the flag follow him, usually resting there while last words are uttered. Sabers are commonly held by the first and second member in charge, whereas the third highest-ranking member presents the flag, usually displaying the fraternity's characteristic colors or coat of arms. The process is inspired by military traditions, as early Studentenverbindungen consisted mostly of officers or aristocrats. The uniforms worn are usually derived from those employed in the Polish revolution of 1830 and are complete with hat, sash and jacket in the fraternity's colors, white pants, riding boots with spurs and white gloves. Indonesia In Indonesia, this ceremony is known as \\"Pedang Pora\\". This ceremony is done on weddings of a military or police officer as the groom. Other uniformed services also has the similar ceremony for an officer's wedding ceremony. References *Service Etiquette Fourth Edition, by Oretha D. Swartz.

Function  The protein encoded by this gene catalyzes the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate. This reaction uses calcium as a cofactor and plays an important role in the intracellular transduction of receptor-mediated tyrosine kinase activators. For example, when activated by SRC, the encoded protein causes the Ras guanine nucleotide exchange factor RASGRP1 to translocate to the Golgi apparatus, where it activates Ras. Also, this protein has been shown to be a major substrate for heparin-binding growth factor 1 (acidic fibroblast growth factor)-activated tyrosine kinase. The receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase PTPmu (PTPRM) is capable of dephosphorylating PLCG1. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. Common to all PLC isozymes, PLCG1 consists of an N-terminal PH domain, which translocates PLC to the plasma membrane and binds PIP3; four EF hands; an X and Y catalytic region comprising the TIM barrel; and a C-terminal C2 domain. Specific to the PLCG isozymes is a large separation between the X and Y domains consisting of a split PH domain, tandem SH2 domains, and an SH3 domain. The SH2 domains bind phosphorylated tyrosine residues on target proteins via their FLVR sequence motifs, activating the catalytic function of PLCg; and the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences on the target protein. PLCG1 can be activated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and non-receptor tyrosine kinases. For example, when activated, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 and epidermal growth factor receptor are RTKs that have phosphorylated tyrosines, which provide docking sites for PLCG1 SH2 domains. The activated RTKs phosphoylate PLCG1 at tyrosines located at position 472, 771, 775, 783, and 1254. Non-receptor tyrosine kinases interact with PLCG1 in large complexes at the plasma membrane. For example, in T cells, Lck and Fyn (Src family kinases) phosphorylate immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). The phosphorylated ITAMs recruit ZAP-70, which phosphorylates tyrosines in LAT and SLP-76. PLCg1 binds to LAT through its n-terminal SH2 domain and to SLP-76 via its SH3 domain. Has been shown to interact with CISH which negatively regulates it by targeting it for degradation. The deletion of Cish in effector T cells has been shown to augment TCR signaling and subsequent effector cytokine release, proliferation and survival. The adoptive transfer of tumor- specific effector T cells knocked out or knocked down for CISH resulted in a significant increase in functional avidity and long-term tumor immunity. There are no changes in activity or phosphorylation of Cish's purported target, STAT5 in either the presence or absence of Cish.  Clinical significance  Researchers studying PLCg1 and its role in breast cancer metastasis discovered this gene can promote cancer metastasis and subsequently blocking it stopped cancer from spreading. Research is ongoing but this gene could lead to the development of new anti-cancer drugs.  Interactions  PLCG1 has been shown to interact with: * BAG3, * CD117, * CD31, * Cbl gene *CISH * Epidermal growth factor receptor, * Eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1 alpha 1, * FLT1, * GAB1, * GIT1, * Grb2, * HER2/neu, * IRS2, * ITK, * KHDRBS1, * Linker of activated T cells, * Lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2, * PDGFRA, * PLD2, * RHOA, * SOS1, * TUB, * TrkA, * TrkB, * VAV1, and * Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein.

She was used by the Union Navy as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways. The side wheel gunboat Mount Vernon, built at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1846, was seized by order of the War Department 21 April 1861 and transferred to the Navy on that date for active duty with the Potomac Flotilla, Lt. J. Glendy Sprosteon in command.  Assigned to duty on the Potomac River to protect Washington, D.C.  After fitting out at the Washington Navy Yard (striking the wharf in the process), Mount Vernon was ready for duty. In May she reconnoitered the Potomac River and up the Rappahannock River 16 May to Urbana, meeting no southern forces. She chased a steamer 16 May and noted, the 18th, that people on shore were most mistrustful. During the summer, she served as a utility boat. Dispatched 26 June to seize a small sloop convoying armed men from the Maryland to Virginia shores, she departed the Washington Navy Yard 28 June for Fortress Monroe. On 5 July, she towed Teaser, the sloop captured by , from Nanjemoy to Washington, D.C.. Part of the James River Squadron later in July, she was in Aquia Creek in August, where dispatched her for Freehora. She carried troops to Aiken's Landing 17 August.  Change of name to USS Mount Washington  In this area for the remainder of 1861, Mount Vernon changed her name to Mount Washington 4 November 1861 to prevent confusion. She carried provisions for the squadron in 1862, arriving Norfolk, Virginia, from Washington, D.C., 12 July with ordnance stores. She towed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, 24 December 1862.  Heavy action encountered in Virginia waterways  Mount Washington saw heaviest action in 1863 in the Siege of Suffolk, Virginia. She towed to Washington 8 January, joining the campaign in April. She found aground at the mouth of the Nampony River 13 April and learned that the Confederates planned to cross the river to attack the Union's rear forces at Suffolk, Virginia, and to silence the gunboats for this purpose. In the subsequent Battle of Suffolk at the Norfleet House Battery, Mount Washington exchanged artillery fire with the Confederates at Hampton Roads, 14 April, meeting sharp musketry. Four sailors temporarily assigned to Mount Washington were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions during this battle: Coxswain Robert Jordan, Seaman Henry Thielberg, Coxswain Robert B. Wood, and Seaman Samuel Woods. Later in April, she and Stepping Stones were fired on at Norfleet's Point. Towing West End downriver, Mount Washington ran aground but moved off with the next high tide. Four Negroes boarded her a few days later, reporting no sign of Confederates; nevertheless, Mount Washington was fired on moments later, and a severe engagement ensued.  Severely damaged, Mount Washington continues her work  After this venture, Mount Washington moved to the mouth of the Western Branch, 6 May, where she was completely riddled and disabled. Participating in the naval action against the batteries at Hatt's Point 12 May nearly destroyed her. She towed Sangandon off Jamestown Island 4 June. She joined the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron at Norfolk, Virginia, 25 February 1865.  End- of-war decommissioning, sale, and civilian career  In April, she served as supply ship downriver until decommissioning. She was sold at public auction at Baltimore, Maryland, 21 June 1865. Redocumented 18 October 1865, she continued to serve American commerce until 1880.

College career Rossi played college football at the University of California, Los Angeles as a halfback and defensive back. During his career, he rushed for 1,490 yards on 255 carries, which put him third on the all-time list. His career rushing average of 5.85 yards per carry was the highest in school history at the time. In addition, Rossi's 169 rushing yards against the University of Oregon in 1945 stood as a school record for 15 years. He ended his career with seven interceptions, including a team-leading three picks in 1947. Rossi was the second leading rusher in the nation before being transferred to the Naval Corps Supply School at Harvard University as part of his military service requirements. Rossi also played baseball in college. He hit .456 in 1945 and won All-Coast honors and hit above .300 in two other seasons. He was the first football player to be selected twice in the NFL Draft. He was first drafted in the first round (ninth overall) of the 1946 NFL Draft by the Washington Redskins. This is considered to be one of the biggest blunders in NFL Draft history because Rossi was a junior, and was not draft eligible. He was again chosen in the first round of the 1947 NFL Draft by the Redskins, but he never played football professionally. Rossi was inducted into the UCLA Bruins Hall of Fame in 1997. Coaching and teaching career Rossi's first teaching and coaching assignment was at Visalia High School. Next, he moved to Redondo Beach, where he taught business classes and coached at Redondo Beach High School. It was there that he eventually became an advocate for teachers' rights through his work with the California Teachers Association. In 1971, Rossi moved his family to Los Altos Hills, California, where he continued working for CTA, and his work focused on higher education. He retired from his position as Deputy Executive Director of CTA in 1984. Death In later life, Rossi suffered from Alzheimer's disease. He died on January 23, 2013 at the age of 88.

It is one of the many possible double helical structures of DNA. This form of DNA can be observed at some conditions such as relatively low humidity and the presence of certain ions, such as Li+ or Mg2+. Recent research suggests that both C-DNA and B-DNA consist of two distinct nucleotide conformations, B-I and B-II. The ratio of B-II conformation in C-DNA is more than 40%. However, the ratio of B-II conformation in B-DNA is only about 10%.It has 9.33 bp/turn. This form of dna is not very stable and not very common. It has right handed helice. In a past experiment performed, it was noted that counterions such as primary amides under basic conditions were used to show the relationship between B and C forms of DNA. The overall shape and orientations of DNA is heavily dependent on its primary sequence and hydrogen bonding between its base pairs, which stabilizes and holds the confirmation of the double helices. C-DNA was shown to hold its confirmation without water and was able to form upon dehydration [1]. Some amides under basic conditions and low humidity showed to hold the C-form confirmation, but smoothly transitioned to B form DNA as the humidity was increased [1]. This may suggest a strong correlation between C-form and B-form DNA, which was also seen using Lithium salt at low humidity. also *B-DNA *A-DNA *Mechanical properties of DNA Notes References * Category:DNA ","title":"C-DNA"},{"id":"14090117","title":"1920 Philadelphia Phillies season"},{"id":"14090122","text":"This article is about the particular significance of the year 1816 to Wales and its people.

He is famous for having carried three shells to an artillery piece during the Allied attempt to force the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915. Personal life and military career Born in the village of Havran, he enlisted into the army in April 1909. After serving in the Balkan Wars of 1912‚Äì1913, he was transferred to Mecidiye Coastal Battery defending the Mediterranean entrance to the √áanakkale. Following the heavy naval bombardment of the forts guarding the Narrows on 18 March 1915, the gun he was serving in the Mecidiye fort remained operational, but its shell crane had been damaged and the other gunners in the area were injured. Corporal Seyit, by himself, is said to have carried three artillery shells each weighing 275 kg to the 240/35 mm gunhttp://www.navyingallipoli.com/heavy_a.html and enabled it to continue firing on the Allied Fleet. He shot three rounds to the British pre- dreadnought which was trying to fish sailors of hit and disabled by a mine earlier.Burt, p. 174 His first two shots didn‚Äôt inflict much damage but his third shot inflicted a severe injury to HMS Ocean. The shot fell under the water mechanism of the ship, causing the ship to lie down, drift towards and hit one of the mines that the mine crew of Nusret had dumped. HMS Ocean capsized shortly after. Following the repulse of the naval assault, Seyit was promoted to corporal and publicized as an iconic Turkish hero. After the Battle of √áanakkale, he was asked to have his picture taken with the shell which he famously carried. Corporal Seyit could not move the shell no matter how hard he tried. Afterwards, Corporal Seyit uttered the famous words \\"If war breaks out again, I'll lift it again.\\" After that, his photo was taken with a wooden shell. He was discharged in 1918 and became a forester and later a coal-miner. He took the surname √áabuk in 1934 with the passing of the Surname Law. He died of pneumonia in 1939. A statue of him carrying a shell was erected in 1992, just south of Kilitbahir Castle on the Gelibolu Peninsula  Further reading   * French Battleship Bouvet * Naval Operations in Dardanelles Campaign * Dardanelles Fortified Area Command * Coastal artillery of the Dardanelles Strait References External links * Picture of Seyit √áabuk  Category:1889 births Category:1939 deaths Category:Deaths from lung disease Category:Deaths from pneumonia Category:People from Havran, Balƒ±kesir Category:Ottoman military personnel of World War I Category:Gallipoli campaign ","title":"Seyit √áabuk"},{"id":"14090190","title":"1923 Philadelphia Phillies season"},{"id":"14090191","text":"Marcisz√≥w is a village in Kamienna G√≥ra County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

It was located next to the rail bridge over Barrington Road, near Coldharbour Lane, in Brixton, London and closed in 1976.  History  East Brixton opened in 1866 as Loughborough Park. It consisted of two platforms with wooden buildings on high piers next to the railway viaduct. In 1870 the station was renamed Loughborough Park and Brixton, before it was finally renamed East Brixton in 1894. Passenger services were operated by the Southern Railway and after nationalisation by the Southern Region of British Railways. The station was included in a proposal published in 1905 by the Australian engineer Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney for an underground monorail-type railway. The plans for the Kearney High-Speed Railway envisaged running a tube line from via central London, Brixton and to , but were never realised. East Brixton station made a brief appearance in the 1948 comedy film A Date with a Dream. It is seen in the background of a scene in which two soldiers (played by Len Lowe and Bill Lowe) walk along Barrington Road.  Decline and closure  Over the years the station became progressively neglected and lost passengers from 1971 when Brixton Underground station opened nearby as the southern terminus of the new Victoria line. With declining passenger numbers and the station requiring extensive repairs to the wooden platforms and buildings it was decided that the expense was not justified. There was a fire in 1975 which temporarily closed the station but the station reopened and was finally closed on 5 January 1976. The platforms and its buildings were demolished shortly after closure. Nothing now remains of the station at track level: there are some arches and windows in the viaduct of the still used line. Future Proposals Map of rail & tube lines passing through Brixton, showing the location of East Brixton View northward on Gresham Road, Brixton, under the South London line; the former East Brixton station site is just east of this location (right). Between 2005 and 2012, most of the South London Line was incorporated into the London Overground network as part of the East London line extension project to create an orbital railway around London. Westbound London Overground services run along this section of the line as far as Wandsworth Road and then branch off at Heathbrook Park, passing through Battersea towards Clapham Junction. This route crosses over Loughborough Junction and Brixton stations and the plans have been criticised for missing opportunities to create new interchange stations with Thameslink services and the London Underground Victoria line respectively. Under current proposals, no stations are planned at these locations as the line is on high railway arches, making the cost of any station construction prohibitive. It has been suggested that a re-opened East Brixton station could provide a form of interchange with the Victoria line and Thameslink as it would be located almost exactly in the middle of the two lines. This was the subject of a petition to parliament in 2014. In March 2017, Lambeth Council started a review to see if there was a business case for reopening the station. The council is currently working with Transport for London and Network Rail. In August 2018, the Liberal Democrats along with London Assembly member Caroline Pigeon called for the reopening of East Brixton.http://www.lambethlibdems.org.uk/demand_better_connections_for_brixton Maps File:Streatham & Tulse Hill Hastings & St Leonards RJD 100.jpgA 1908 Railway Clearing House map of lines around East Brixton railway station File:East brixton station map.png1914 railway junction diagram showing the former East Brixton Station File:London Overground map 2012.pngThe London Overground network; East Brixton is between Denmark Hill and Clapham High St  References  Further reading * Category:Disused railway stations in the London Borough of Lambeth Category:Former London, Brighton and South Coast Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1866 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1976 Category:Brixton Category:History of the London Borough of Lambeth ","title":"East Brixton railway station"},{"id":"14090315","text":"Doman√≥w is a village in the administrative district of Gmina Marcisz√≥w, within Kamienna G√≥ra County, Lower Silesian Voivodeship, in south-western Poland.

Early career, A&R; work After graduating high school in Huntington Beach, California Altman attended college at UC Santa Barbara, for a major in business and a minor in music. He left UC Santa Barbara before finishing his degree to attend the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. After finishing at Grove, he went on to perform a series of odd and side jobs such pizza delivery, waiter, and swim teacher while also working for free as a music programmer. Eventually he started a recording career with a studio as a second engineer. When that studio went out of business, he borrowed money to set up his own small recording studio in Hollywood. While running his own studio he did work writing software, which then lead to software work with Capitol/EMI. He quit his studio and left for a job at Capitol, working in sales and eventually moving to the A&R; department as a scout. During this time he formed a band called Farmer in 1995 that was signed by Aware Records and later released an eponymous album in 1997. While on the road touring with Farmer he served as an A&R; scout for Capitol, while also listening to demo submissions. One of those submissions was for the artist Citizen Cope (Clarence Greenwood), which he helped develop and was able to get signed a record deal to Capitol. Following the signing, Altman was awarded with an executive A&R; job. He quit his band and focused on A&R;, keeping the career for ten years. During this time he moved from Capitol Records, to Hollywood Records and to finally Columbia Records where he principally A&R;'d Katy Perry & OneRepublic. Record Producer During his last years as an A&R; executive at Columbia, he also began actively working as a record producer. Some of his early work includes producing Marc Broussard's first two albums, Momentary Setback and Carencro, as well as an album for the band Jupiter Sunrise. He eventually left Columbia to pursue being a full-time record producer in 2005, starting the Galt Line Music label and a studio in Burbank, California. During the production of Todd Carey's album Watching Waiting he was introduced to engineer Eric Robinson by Carey, and Altman and Robinson would continue a working partnership at the Galt Line for years afterward. At the Galt Line he would go on to produce for a variety of artists, achieving commercial success with albums such as Kate Voegele's Don't Look Away and Matt Nathanson's Some Mad Hope.

It's situated within the Solway Coast, a region designated by the United Kingdom as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The civil parish includes the larger village of Crosby and the hamlets of Birkby and Crosby Villa. The population of the parish was 1,054 in 2001, increasing to 1,113 at the 2011 Census. The parish is served by one public house, the Stag Inn, and a primary school (both in Crosby). Etymology The earliest form of the name was 'Crosseby' (1123‚Äì50), from the Old Norse \\"'krossa b√Ωr' meaning 'b»≥ (village, hamlet) marked by crosses'. The name 'Crosscanonby' results from the gift of land in Crosby with the church to the canons of Carlisle.\\"  Location  Crosscanonby is located less than from Cumbria's West Coast, 0.5 miles off the A5996 and North of the River Ellen. It is close to the southern end of Allonby Bay, an inlet of the Solway Firth. It is where the Norman church, St John the Evangelist's Church, Crosscanonby is situated, along with the Crosscanonby Carr. North of the village is where the Crosscanonby salt pans are found. Being known for its history as the location where salt was produced from the 1630s until about 1760, it is thought that some of the worker's cottages were constructed in this village at the same time. These cottages became a pub, then reverted to being cottages again in 1900. The coast road, B5300, which runs between the salt pans and the former cottages, was built in 1824. Crosscanonby is southwest of Carlisle, south of Silloth and less than northeast of Maryport. Governance Crosscanonby is in the parliamentary constituency of Workington. In the December 2019 general election, the Tory candidate for Workington, Mark Jenkinson, was elected the MP, overturning a 9.4 per cent Labour majority from the 2017 election to eject shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman by a margin of 4,136 votes. Until the December 2019 general election, the Labour Party had won the seat in every general election since 1979.The Conservative Party had only been elected once in Workington since World War 2, at the 1976 by-election. Historically Crosscanonby has been a Labour supporting area. For the European Parliament residents in Gilcrux vote to elect MEP's for the North West England constituency. For Local Government purposes it is in the Ellen & Gilcrux Ward of Allerdale Borough Council and the Maryport North Division of Cumbria County Council. Crosscanonby has its own Parish Council; Crosscanonby Parish Council. Crosscanonby Parish church Crosscanonby church, a grade I listed building, is known as St John the Evangelist's Church, Crosscanonby.St John the Evangelist's Church, Crosscanonby It occupies one of the earliest Christian sites in Cumbria. The church was built in c1130 A.D. and has been extensively restored since 1880. The southwest view includes a Viking era gravestone in the lower centre to the church wall. Some of the stonework in the original construction is believed to have come from earlier Roman settlement in the Crosscanonby area. Outside the church is the tomb of local salt tax officer John Smith, who died in 1730. The tomb has an unusual panel showing the salt officer working at his desk. Crosscanonby Carr This is a nature reserve, the first in the Solway Plain AONB. It first began as a Solway Plain Rural Initiative Project, which evolved from a vandalised site. Crosscanonby Carr now provides a wetland, meadow and woodland refuge for numerous animals, birds and plants. The site has an Access for All Trail provided for people with all disabilities. Education The parish has one local Primary School, Crosscanonby St John's Church of England School, located in the Village of Crosby. The primary school has approximately 66 students aged 4‚Äì11 on role. History The Roman Milefortlet 21 north of Crosscanonby. North of the village, along the coast, is the Roman Milefortlet 21 and the Elizabethan salt pans. Milefortlet 21, now part of the Hadrian's Wall World Heritage Site, is believed to date back to between 79 AD and circa 130 AD, revealing a wealth of information about the lifestyle of Roman troops in Britain. Milefortlet 21 was part of a system of defence, including Hadrian's Wall, developed to protect this far-flung corner of the Roman Empire. Another fortlet, Milefortlet 22, is west of the village, but it now lies underneath Maryport Golf Course.BROWNRIGG MILEFORTLET 22, Pastscape, retrieved 26 November 2013 Close to Milefortlet 21 are the remains of the Elizabethan salt pans. It is thought that they were begun around 1630 and leased to Richard Barwise in 1634. On the beach was a water tank on a wooden scaffold, whose footings remain, from which sea water ran onto the Sleech in the Kinch. Sleech is the sand from the beach; the Kinch where it was piled up is the large pond, sealed by puddled clay. The remains of these salt pans can be clearly seen to date. The strong brine from the Kinch trickled down to the south. The brine was then boiled in iron pans to produce salt, which crystallised out of the brine. From 1698 a salt tax was levied. One salt tax Officer was John Smith, (died in 1730), whose tombstone is at St John the Evangelist's Church, Crosscanonby, with a carving of him at his desk. After being abandoned for salt production, the salt pans suddenly had a new use in the 20th century between 1918 and the 1930s, when holiday cottages and a caravan site grew around them. These pans were seen as a tourist attraction up until when the caravan site was abandoned in the 1970s as a result of coastal erosion. Later in the mid-1980s, the significance of the Salt pans was realised leading to the redevelopment of the historical monument after some research had been carried out. Between 1997 and 1998, Major works were carried out to protect the Salt pans at Crosscanonby from threat of Coastal erosion by the Solway Rural Initiative, having realised that one or two more tides could result in the loss of the Salt pans forever. To protect the Salt pans, emergency work which included building a wooden palisade around the most affected site was carried out. Over 2,000 tonnes of material from nearby Crosscanonby Carr nature reserve were used in the process. Today, the site remains intact, although under constant threat from the tides. Demography Population: 1801‚Äì2001 The earliest census available for the Crosscanonby area is that of 1801. As the Table below on the right shows, the total population back then was 3252. This then increased exponentially over the next Census reports carried out every ten years until up to 1851 where it had almost doubled to 6,182. The 1891 census report shows the total population reaching its peak at 9,196. However, ten years later the population seems to have dropped significantly to 931 people. Comparing census reports from this period, the population of Crosscanonby has fluctuated leaving the population at 1,054 in 2001. Total Number of Houses: 1841‚Äì2001 The same trend seen in the population of the parish from the 1800s epitomises the change in the total number of houses. A total of 1,372 houses were recorded in the 1841 for the entire parish. Just like the population did, the number of houses increased in the next couple of years with a total count of 1,915 in 1891. Likewise, The number of houses suddenly fell to 229 in the 1901 census report. This number also fluctuated to the total 439 houses in the 2001 census report. Most Common Occupations: 1881 The 1881 Occupation Census report shows that the most common occupations for men were Works in Dress employing 118 people, Works in Food and Lodging (123), Works in House Furniture and Decorations (245), Works in Mineral Substances (408) and Works in Transport and Communications (423). 269 men had their occupations reported as 'Works in General or Unspecified Commodities' while 29 were Without Specified Occupations. Ten men were reported with Unknown Occupations. The most common occupations for women at this time were Works in Food and Lodging employing 52 women, Works in Dress (158) and Domestic services or Offices (384). 484 Women were reported as Persons Without Specified Occupations while 1,172 were reported with Unknown Occupations.

The Meeting Place (commonly referred to as TMP) is an evangelical Christian church located in the heart of downtown Winnipeg, Manitoba. It is a member of the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches and the Mennonite Brethren Church of Manitoba. The front of the Meeting Place Church in Winnipeg, Manitoba. The Meeting Place's mission statement is \\"to be a biblically-functioning community leading people to become fully devoted followers of Jesus Christ.\\" In June 2013 the membership established a vision statement to encourage and challenge the church to be about both experiencing and expressing compassion: Reordering our lives for the compassionate cause of Jesus in our friendships, our city, and our world. The Meeting Place is about a casual and inclusive Sunday morning experience. There is no dress code, and all are welcome to attend. The services sometimes include drama, dance, and visual art as ways of allowing people to connect with God, and feature relevant and understandable messages of about 25-minutes that are most often part of a teaching series. The worship band occasionally plays songs from popular music. There is a cafe at the back of the meeting space and attendees are permitted to enjoy food and drink during the service. All of this is done in order to create an atmosphere in which both people who have attended church much of their lives, as well as those who have maybe never attended church, can feel comfortable, but also be challenged to believe the Bible and live according to what it teaches. Most weeks from September through June there are two services of just over an hour each Sunday morning at 9 and 11am. During the summer, TMP offers one service at 10am. Sunday morning service at The Meeting Place 2018 History of the Church The Meeting Place Church service held in basement during 1991 renovations. The Meeting Place was founded in 1991 by a small group of former attendees of Portage Avenue Mennonite Brethren Church, as well as a few people from other church backgrounds. The hope was to create a new church with a focus on making a Sunday morning worship experience more comfortable for first time visitors and offering them identifiable steps and pathways toward greater spiritual growth. The Meeting Place Church offices located in lower level of the building seen here on the left next to the main building. The Meeting Place was originally located in a small office building on Maryland Street prior to moving in 1993 to its current location on Smith Street in what was previously a night club. Church services were held in a temporarily renovated area in the Smith Street building basement while major renovations took place in the soon to be main auditorium. Once the main auditorium began being used for the weekend services, the basement was renovated to accommodate the Children's Ministry program. Subsequent renovations on the top floor have allowed for a theater to be built to accommodate the Youth Ministry programs. In addition, staff offices have been moved around a number of times. Initially these were in the Smith Street building when it was first acquired by the congregation, but were taken out and moved to an office building one block away on Broadway Ave and remained there for a couple of years until once again being relocated to a basement office on Smith Street next door to the main auditorium building. Over the years, The Meeting Place has seen both increases and declines in attendance. At its peak in the late 90s and into 2000, over 2200 attendees were coming on a weekly basis. Currently, 800 or more people attend on a weekly basis, with as many as 1500 people indicating they would call The Meeting Place their home faith community. The Meeting Place has seen its share of Christian recording artists on staff, most notably Juno Award nominee and Covenant Award winner Jon Buller, and Covenant Award winner Drew Brown. The Meeting Place is also where Christian recording artist and Juno Award winner Amanda Falk was discovered. In September 2008, John Neufeld became the lead pastor. He had previously been the head of the Canadian Conference of Mennonite Brethren Churches' Leadership Development department Ministry Activity In addition to Sunday program for both all ages, The Meeting Place offers various other spiritual growth opportunities. The Alpha Course, which is a multi-week program for people who are exploring Christian faith, is offered twice yearly. There are also water baptism and membership preparation classes, mid-week groups for those dealing with divorce/separation or bereavement, and parent training and equipping events. There are also Life Groups, which are small groups of people who meet weekly or semi-monthly for Bible study, prayer, and an opportunity to get to know and care for each other. These met at the church or in various homes across the city and on all nights of the week. In addition, Youth programs are offered on Friday evenings.

During the 1970s frequent trips to the Mediterranean inspired Sanchez to adopt a more geometric and minimalist approach in his Moroccan paintings or Boston City Hall drawings. By the late 1980s, however, he turned his attention to New York scenes and depicted Bronx bodegas, storefronts, and garages as solid blocks of color. During this time he exhibited at the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale and the Miami-Dade Public Library in Florida as well as at galleries in Fort Lauderdale, Boca Raton and Coral Gables, and in Miami, home to many exiled Cubans.

He was also recognized internationally and was awarded first prize at the 1974 Biennial in San Juan, Puerto Rico. During his career, his critical supporters included American art collector Barbara Duncan and A Hyatt Mayor, print curator at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In style and subject matter Sanchez's work reflected both Latin-American and American culture. His colorful Caribbean palette and interest in light and shadow on vernacular architecture is attributed to his formative years in Cuba. Although his flat, sometimes abstract, geometric style was not unlike his Brazilian contemporaries Alfredo Volpi and Livio Abramo, his paintings evoked a sense of place that, for art historian Rafael D√≠azCasas, reflected a \\"feeling of displacement\\" and \\"idea of an absent household\\".\\"Thirteen paintings and works on paper by Emilio Sanchez at Frederico S√®ve Gallery.\\" Art Daily. 2011.Web.Angeline, John; Bleys, Rudi C.; and DiazCasas, Rafael.

He is best remembered for having headed the Spruce Production Division during World War I, for conceiving the idea of sending military troops to work in the logging industry to spur wartime wood production, and as the creator of a government-sponsored union, the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen. Early life He was born in California, Ohio, which was located southeast of Cincinnati, Ohio on July 17, 1879. Growing up, he attended Cincinnati's public schools and the Walnut Hill School. Early career Disque enlisted in the United States Army in 1899 to serve in the Philippine-American War, rising in rank from private to first sergeant to second lieutenant in Company E, 47th Infantry, United States Volunteers, between September and November 1899. In January 1900, his company landed at Sorsogon in the Bicol Region of Luzon in the Philippines, where it did garrison duty, advanced north against the Filipino Army, and engaged in operations against Filipino guerrillas. In February 1901, he mustered out of the volunteers to accept a regular's commission as a 2nd lieutenant in the 5th Cavalry, with temporary duty at Fort Thomas, Kentucky. In September 1903, he accepted a transfer to the 3rd Cavalry, where a 1st lieutenant's billet was available. Disque was a Distinguished Graduate of the Infantry and Cavalry School at Fort Leavenworth in 1904-1905, then completed the Staff Course in 1905-1906, where his thesis was in law: The Suspension of the Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus in the United States. Disque served as a first lieutenant until 1916, when he was promoted to captain under the 14-years-in- grade rule. In 1917, he resigned to become the warden of the Michigan State Prison. When war was declared, he volunteered to return to the Army, hoping for a battlefield command. On May 7, 1917, he was called to Washington to meet with Gen. John J. Pershing and Chief of the General Staff Maj. Gen. James G. Harbord. They convinced him to remain a civilian and investigate the lumber shortage, caused by a combination of labor union strikes and mill owner profiteering, which was hindering airplane production. Disque decided to bring in military crews to replace lumberjacks who had joined the military forestry divisions, as well as striking workers,Brice P. Disque photographs, c. 1912-1950s who had shut down most timber operations in Washington, and the subsequent on-the-job \\"slow-down\\" actions.Chapter 4: Rebels in the Woods World War I Disque was reinstated on September 29, 1917, as a lieutenant colonel, promoted to colonel on November 6, and placed in charge of the Spruce Production Division of the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps, headquartered in Portland, Oregon. When Congress approved the formation of corporations by the United States government as war instrumentalities in the summer of 1918, the United States Spruce Production Corporation was incorporated in September 1918 to control logging production and the building of railroads to move the lumber. Brice also became its president from 1918‚Äì1919. He was sent to Seattle, Washington in October 1917 to deal with the alarming lack of production of woods vital to the war effort, especially the spruce necessary for airplane production. Brice worked with local lumber barons to establish another union for the lumbermen, in an effort to get them to work eight-hour days. The first local of the Loyal Legion of Loggers and Lumbermen (Four L) was organized in Wheeler, Oregon on October 30, 1917. Several more locals were established in short order: by January 1, the Legion had 10,000 members; by January 24, 35,000.Seattle General Strike: International Union of Timberworkers For his service with the Spruce Production Division, Disque was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.Guide to the Brice P. Disque Papers 1899-1957 The Four L was organized after opposition to the Spruce Production Division by the IWW's Lumber Workers Industrial Union, which had declared an industry-wide strike in the summer of 1917, latching onto the momentum of the many spontaneous strikes that were occurring. The goal of the Four L was to counter the IWW as the union of lumber workers by fostering a spirit of patriotism. The Four L required its members to sign a loyalty oath to the United States and no-strike agreements. The Four L was headed, at first, by army officers, and all 28,000 soldiers of the Spruce Production Division became members.Brice P. Disque papers - Special Collections, UW Libraries Post-war career Despite problems that arose within the Four L and accusations against Disque, Congress approved his promotion to Brigadier General in September 1918. Disque continued service as a general in the Army's Organized Reserves from 1922 to 1939, alternating between performing training missions for the Army and serving on the board of trustees of various private firms.Brice P. Disque papers - Special Collections, UW Libraries From June 6, 1922 to April 14, 1937, he commanded the 151st Cavalry Brigade, headquartered in Rochester, New York, and from April 15, 1937 to June 1939, the 152nd Cavalry Brigade, headquartered in New York City. Both were the major subordinate units of the 61st Cavalry Division. Disque served as president of several corporations such as the Anthracite Equipment Corporation, G. Amsinck and Co., and the Sulphide Ore Process Company. He also served on various private and public boards and commissions such as the Anthracite Institute and the Solid Fuels Administration for War. Disque died February 29, 1960.

Tarsilah Brunei- Sejarah Awal dan Perkembangan Islam. Bandar Seri Begawan: Jabatan Pusat Sejarah Local Brunei Malay folklore suggest that there was a Chinese settlement in present-day Kinabatangan, Sabah. Linguistic evidence does not support the view held commonly by the Brunei History Centre that \\"Kinabatangan\\" could mean \\"Chinese river\\". According to early accounts which survive only in copies dating back to the 19th century such as Salasilah Raja- Raja Brunei (Genealogy of the Brunei Kings) which was possibly first compiled during the reign of Sultan Muhammad Hassan (1582‚Äì1598) and subsequently copied and updated from time to time and also the Sejarah Melayu (written by Tun Seri Lanang in 1612), Ong Sum Ping \\"succeeded his father-in-law. He was known as Sultan Ahmad and ruled Brunei\\". This version, however, contradicts later account engraved on the Batu Tarsilah (Genealogical Tablet of the Sultans of Brunei) founded in 1807 that Sultan Ahmad was a brother of Sultan Muhammad Shah and he was not Ong Sum Ping. The latter version is the accepted official history of Brunei.Muhammad Jamil Al-Sufri.(1990).Tarsilah Brunei- Sejarah Awal dan Perkembangan Islam.

In the early 20th century, a Chinese trader, Huang Zhuoru ÈªÑÂçìÂ¶Ç claimed that he visited the tomb of Ong Sum Ping located on a hill 1 li (about half km) from the Brunei capital at that time and there were Chinese inscriptions ÈªÑÊÄªÂÖµ‰πãÂ¢ì on the tombstone which meant 'Tomb of Commander Huang'.„ÄäÈ©¨ÊòüÂçé‰∫∫Âøó„Äãhttp://www.intimes.com.my/yeo-html/yeo591a.htm In another version of this story a Chinese trader from Guangzhou, Huang Qhuo Qi, allegedly discovered the tomb of Ong Sum Ping by accident in 1942, during a business trip to Brunei. . However, the present whereabouts of this tomb is unknown and remains a mystery. In 1947, a reef in the South China Sea for a short while was named 'Senping reef' Ê£ÆÂ±èÁ§Å by the Government of the Republic of China in honour of Ong Sum Ping. In the Brunei capital of Bandar Seri Begawan, there is a street named after him, Jalan Ong Sum Ping, which is the only street in Brunei with a Chinese name. In popular culture Ong Sum Ping has been repeatedly cited as one of the main subjects in the legend of Mount Kinabalu. The legend tells of two Chinese delegates of the Ming ‚Äî Ong Sum Ping and his well-built assistant Wang Kong ‚Äî sent to capture a precious gemstone from the mountain which was being guarded by a dragon. Using his wits, Ong Sum Ping swapped the pearl for a lit glass bottle. Wanting to get all the credit, Wang Kong snatched the retrieved treasure and ran away. Bitterly appalled by his trusted assistant's behaviour, Ong Sum Ping chose to stay behind in Brunei.

The Austrians under Karl Josef Batthy√°ny defeated the outnumbered French under General S√©gur, ending the war in Bavaria. Prelude In October 1744, the Franco-Bavarian army had succeeded, in coordination with Prussia, to expel the Austrians from Bavaria, and to reinstate Charles VII, Prince-elector of Bavaria and Holy Roman Emperor, in his capital Munich. Here he died 3 months later. His 18-year-old son and heir Maximilian III Joseph wavered between the Peace- party, led by his mother Maria Amalia, Holy Roman Empress and Army Commander Friedrich Heinrich von Seckendorff and the War-party, led by Foreign Minister General Ignaz von T√∂rring and the French envoy Chavigny. This hampered the ongoing peace negotiations, so Maria Theresia ordered the Austrian Army to start a new offensive to put pressure on the Bavarian negotiators. Amberg and Vilshofen were taken and the Bavarian army under T√∂rring and its French, Hessian and Palatinate allies were pushed on the defensive. T√∂rring decided to pull back his Bavarian and Hessian troops behind the Lech River. The French Army commander Henri Fran√ßois de S√©gur was not informed of this manoeuver and waited unaware and unprotected near Pfaffenhofen on Palatinate reinforcements under General Zastrow, which arrived on 14 April. The next day Segur decided to also pull back behind the Lech. The Austrians, aware of the isolated French position, had by then reached Pfaffenhofen with a force larger than the French. The battle First the Austrians attacked the town of Pfaffenhofen and were met by French fire. But the Austrians took the town in house-to-house combat in which the fierce Croatian Pandurs inflicted heavy casualties on the French defenders. Meanwhile, Fran√ßois de S√©gur had hastily improvised a defensive position around a hill west of the city. But, when more and more Austrian troops, including the main force under Batthy√°ny, reached the battlefield, de S√©gur was forced twice to withdraw his army, to avoid encirclement. When the sign for a general withdrawal was given, panic broke out amongst the Palatinate troops and they fled. de S√©gur had the greatest difficulty in preventing the panic spreading amongst his French troops. The retreating army was harassed by the Pandur and Hussar light cavalry, which inflicted many casualties. Only after the French and Palatinates had crossed the Paar river at Hohenwart at 18:00, the Austrians gave up their pursuit. The defeated army reached Rain on the Lech the next day at 11:00 at set up camp. But the next morning the Austrian army appeared and the allies fled over the Lech River, leaving all its material behind. Only the burning down of the bridge prevented a total disaster for the allies. de S√©gur had lost many troops and material, but his maintenance of discipline had prevented the total destruction of his army. Consequences The day after the defeat, T√∂rring was dismissed and the Peace-party prevailed. One week later, Maximilian III Joseph concluded the Treaty of F√ºssen with Austria. Maximilian recognized the Pragmatic Sanction. He also abandoned his father's claims on Bohemia and the imperial crown and promised to support the imperial candidacy of Maria Theresa's husband, Francis Stephen of Lorraine, who in fact became the next Emperor on 13 September 1745. The Battle of Pfaffenhofen eliminated Bavaria-Bohemia as one of the four theaters of War the Austrians had to fight on, releasing troops for the war in Silesia, Italy and the Austrian Netherlands.

J. Caruso, written by John Glenn, Travis Adam Wright, Hillary Seitz, and Dan McDermott and stars Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, and Billy Bob Thornton. The plot follows two strangers who must go on the run together after receiving a mysterious phone call from an unknown woman who is using information and communications technology to track them. The film was released in traditional theaters and IMAX theaters on September 26, 2008 and grossed $178 million worldwide. Plot In January 2009, Stanford University dropout Jerry Shaw learns that his identical twin brother Ethan, an officer in the U.S. Air Force, has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find in his bank account and his apartment filled with illicit items. He receives a phone call from a woman who warns that the FBI is about to arrest him and he needs to run. Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan. While Morgan confers with Air Force OSI Special Agent Zoe P√©rez, the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman, a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam, who is aboard the Capitol Limited en route to the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid law enforcement by controlling networked devices, including traffic lights, mobile phones, automated cranes, and even power lines. Meanwhile, the caller redirects a crystalline explosive to a gemcutter, who cuts it and fixes it into a necklace. Another man steals Sam's trumpet in Chicago and fits the crystal's sonic trigger into the tubing before forwarding it to Sam in Washington. Agent Perez is summoned by Secretary of Defense George Callister to be read into Ethan's job at the Pentagon. Ethan monitored the Department of Defense's top-secret intelligence-gathering supercomputer, the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA; ). Callister leaves Perez with Major William Bowman and ARIIA to investigate Ethan Shaw's death. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that the woman on the phone is actually ARIIA, and that she has \\"activated\\" them according to the Constitution's authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense. Perez and Bowman find evidence that Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber and leave to brief Callister. Afterwards, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon. Both groups learn that after ARIIA's recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in Balochistan resulted in the deaths of U.S. citizens, ARIIA concluded that \\"to prevent more bloodshed, the executive branch must be removed.\\" ARIIA is acting on behalf of \\"We the People\\", and cites the Declaration of Independence (\\"whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it\\"). Belatedly, Jerry learns he has been brought to circumvent biometric locks placed by his twin that prevent ARIIA from bringing into effect Operation Guillotine, a military simulation of maintaining government after the loss of all presidential successors. Because Secretary Callister agreed with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he is to be the designated survivor and new president after the crystal detonates at the State of the Union (SOTU). Another of ARIIA's agents extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the explosive necklace to wear to the SOTU. Sam's school band has also been redirected to the United States Capitol to play for the president, bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together. Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence. Before sacrificing himself to stop an armed MQ-9 Reaper sent by ARIIA, Morgan gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol. Arriving in the House Chamber, Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the Secret Service. Sometime later, in April 2009, Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and recommends against building another; the Shaw twins and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and Jerry attends Sam's birthday party, earning Rachel's gratitude and a kiss.

Caruso, who directed the 1996 TV series High Incident under Spielberg's executive production, replaced the director in helming Eagle Eye, with Spielberg remaining as executive producer. In June 2007, actor LaBeouf, who was involved in Spielberg's and Caruso's 2007 film Disturbia and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, re-joined the director and executive producer to star as the lead in Eagle Eye. McDermott's script was rewritten by screenwriters John Glenn, Travis Wright, and Hillary Seitz in preparation for production. Filming began on November 6, 2007 and wrapped in February 2008. The film's visual effects were created by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Caruso said by the time the film came to fruition twelve years later, \\"the technology had finally caught up to the storytelling... Everybody has a BlackBerry on their belt, and we think we're constantly being tracked. It's less science fiction than when Steven Spielberg conceived it.\\"Vary, Adam B. \\"Fall Movie Summer Preview, September: Eagle Eye.\\" Entertainment Weekly, Iss. #1007/1008, August 22/29, 2008, pg.52. Caruso wanted to bring a gritty, 1970s-era sensibility to the film. Accordingly, a key chase scene in a high- tech package-processing hub on conveyor belts was shot without the use of computer-generated imagery. \\"It was like Chutes and Ladders for adults. It was pretty dangerous, and a lot of fun.\\" While filming the scene, Monaghan suffered a welt after a cable brushed her neck and Caruso hit his head on a protruding bolt, requiring stitches. Music The music to Eagle Eye was written by composer Brian Tyler, who recorded the score with an 88-piece ensemble of the Hollywood Studio Symphony at the Sony Scoring Stage. The session was interrupted by the Chino Hills earthquake on July 29, 2008‚Äîand a recording of the quake hitting the scoring stage is online. Promotion The official website features an ARG type of gameplay system to promote the film. The voice previewed behind the phone in multiple trailers contacts the player, placing them in unique experiences. This has been called the \\"Eagle Eye Freefall Experience\\". While official cast listings do not list the name of the actress behind the mysterious voice featured in the film and trailers, Rosario Dawson confirmed at the Hollywood premiere that it belongs to Julianne Moore. Reception =Box office= In its opening weekend, Eagle Eye grossed in 3,510 theaters in the United States and Canada, reaching the first-place position at the box office. The film went on to gross $101.4 million in the United States and Canada and $76.6 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $178 million worldwide, against its production budget of $80 million. =Critical response = Eagle Eye received generally mixed reviews from critics. , the film holds a 26% approval rating on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 182 reviews, with an average rating of 4.67/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Eagle Eye is a preposterously plotted thriller that borrows heavily from other superior films.\\" Metacritic gave the film an average score of 43 out of 100, based on 28 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave Eagle Eye a score of two stars out of four, saying: \\"The word 'preposterous' is too moderate to describe Eagle Eye. This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness.\\"Eagle Eye review, Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times, September 25, 2008 James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying: \\"This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the payoff is a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by keeping things moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot‚Äîit's mice on a treadmill, running and running and not getting anywhere.\\"Eagle Eye review, James Berardinelli, ReelViews, September 2008 The Hollywood Reporter called it a \\"slick, silly techno-thriller\\" and \\"Even those who surrender all disbelief at the door will be hard pressed not to smirk at some of the wildly improbable plotting.\\"Film Review: Eagle Eye, Michael Rechtshaffen, The Hollywood Reporter, September 25, 2008 Josh Rosenblatt of The Austin Chronicle enjoyed the film, calling it \\"good, manic fun plus a heavy dose of political intrigue adding up to two hours of clamorous, mind- numbing nonsense,\\" calling it \\"Transporter 2 on crack.\\"Eagle Eye review, Josh Rosenblatt, The Austin Chronicle, September 2008 William Arnold of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer also gave Eagle Eye a positive review, remarking that it's \\"engrossing as an intellectual puzzle\\" and \\"a solid thriller.\\"Eagle Eye review, William Arnold, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, September 2008 Mark Bell of Film Threat said: \\"the film isn't a complete waste of your time [...] but don't expect anything brilliant.\\"Eagle Eye review, Mark Bell, Film Threat, September 2008 Neely Tucker of The Washington Post said that Eagle Eye is \\"sometimes entertaining\\" but \\"doesn't have much to say.\\"Eagle Eye review, Neely Tucker, The Washington Post, September 2008 Robert Koehler of Variety felt that the film's \\"first 35 minutes sizzle\\" but \\"the story [becomes] near- parody in the final act.\\"Odessy Eagle Eye review, Robert Koehler, Variety, September 2008 Eagle Eye was a nominee for a 2009 Saturn Award for \\"Best Science Fiction Film\\" and was nominated by the Visual Effects Society Awards in the category of Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture. =Home media= Eagle Eye was released on DVD and Blu-ray only in select stores on December 26, 2008, exactly three months after its theatrical release, September 26, 2008. In the first week on the DVD sales chart, Eagle Eye sold 182,592 units which translated to in revenue. In the second week, however, sales rose tremendously to 1,044,682 for that week, opening at No. 1 and acquiring revenue of for that week. As per the latest figures, 2,181,959 units have been sold, bringing in $38,008,436 in revenue. This does not include Blu-ray sales/DVD rentals. The next day, it was released nationwide. iTunes released it a month later as a rental and buy. Mobile game A mobile game based on the film was developed and published by Magmic Games. It was released for BlackBerry, Windows Mobile, BREW, and Java ME devices prior to the film's launch in early September. There are also two games on the film's web site.

Russia"},{"id":"14090650","text":"Serum paraoxonase and arylesterase 1 (PON1) also known as A esterase , homocysteine thiolactonase or serum aryldialkylphosphatase 1 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the PON1 gene. Paraoxonase 1 has esterase and more specifically paraoxonase activity. Serum PON1 is found in all mammalian species studied so far but is not present in the serum of birds, fish and reptiles or in insects. PON1 is the first discovered member of a multigene family also containing PON2 and PON3, the genes for which are located adjacent to each other on chromosome 7.  Structure  Human PON1 is a glycoprotein composed of 354 amino acids and has a molecular weight of 43000 Daltons which associates with high-density lipoprotein (HDL, \\"good cholesterol\\") in the circulation. Serum PON1 is secreted mainly by the liver, although local synthesis occurs in several tissues and PON1 protein is found in almost all tissues. X-ray crystallography has revealed the structure of PON1 to be a 6 bladed propeller with a unique lid structure covering the active site passage which allows association with HDL.  Function  PON1 is responsible for hydrolysing organophosphate pesticides and nerve gasses. Polymorphisms in the PON1 gene significantly affect the catalytic ability of the enzyme. PON1 (paraoxonase 1) is also a major anti-atherosclerotic component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The PON1 gene is activated by PPAR-Œ≥, which increases synthesis and release of paraoxonase 1 enzyme from the liver, reducing atherosclerosis. The \\"natural\\" substrates for PON1 appear to be lactones. However, PON1 has evolved to be a highly promiscuous enzyme capable of hydrolysing a wide variety of substrates such as lactones (including a number of important pharmaceutical agents such as statins), glucuronide drugs, thiolactones, arylesters, cyclic carbonates, organophosphorus pesticides and nerve gases such as sarin, soman and VX, oestrogen esters and lipid peroxides (oxidised lipids).  Genetics  PON1 in humans is encoded by the PON1 gene which is located on the long arm of chromosome 7. Although many nutritional, life-style and pharmaceutical modulators of PON1 are known., by far the biggest effect on PON1 activity levels, which can vary by over 40 fold between individuals, is through PON1 genetic polymorphisms. The coding region PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity. Some substrates e.g. paraoxon are hydrolysed faster by the R- isoform while others such as diazoxon and lipid-peroxides are hydrolysed more rapidly by the Q- isoform. Both the coding region PON1-L55M and the promoter region PON1-T-108C polymorphisms are associated with different serum concentrations and therefore activities. The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and serum protein levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. The -108C allele has greater promoter activity than the -108T allele which results in different serum activities. The distribution of the PON1 polymorphisms varies with ethnicity. The frequency of the PON1-192R allele increases the further from Europe a population originates, the frequency in Caucasians of 15-30% increases to 70-90% in Far Eastern Oriental and Sub- Saharan African populations. In the southern US African-Americans are five times more likely to be RR than Caucasians. In contrast the PON1-55M allele is much less frequent in Oriental and black African populations compared to Caucasians and are extremely rare or absent in some populations e.g. Thais. These ethnic differences in SNP distribution can lead to large activity differences between populations.  Clinical significance  PON1 was first discovered through its ability to hydrolyse and therefore detoxify organophosphorus compounds which are widely used as pesticides and nerve gases. Despite decades of research it is only now becoming clear that PON1 protects humans from the acute and chronic harmful effects of these compounds Low PON1 activity found in children may increase their susceptibility to organophosphates. Oxidised-lipids are the major cause of inflammation and are responsible for the initiation and/or propagation of several inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis (heart disease and stroke), diabetes, liver and kidney diseases, rheumatic diseases, eye diseases (macular degeneration), cancer and HIV infection . Because of its ability to destroy oxidised-lipids PON1 appears to play some role in all these diseases. However, the greatest research interest has been the role of PON1 in atherosclerosis, where, because of its ability to remove harmful oxidised-lipids, PON1 protects against the development of atherosclerosis Oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (notably in oxidized low-density lipoprotein) form lactone-like structures that are PON substrates. PON1 also protects against bacterial infection by destroying the bacterial signalling molecules that cause gram negative bacteria to invade human tissue and form colonies, thus PON1 contributes to the bodies innate immunity Recently it has been suggested that PON1 has a role in healthy aging, however, the mechanism is currently unknown PON1 activity is low in infants compared to adults. A study of Mexican-American children showed that PON1 activity increased 3.5 times between birth and age seven. An association between PON1 gene polymorphism and susceptibility to Parkinson's disease was not found in a Chinese population.

It appears that the team existed from 1899 to 1900, then from 1905 to 1966, then from 1973 until 1984. It existed again in 1993 and for the last time in 2003, as . In addition Bianchi has been a co-sponsor of many cycling teams. History The Bianchi‚ÄìPirell team of the 1911 Giro d'Italia In 1899 Giovanni Tommaselli won the first international cycling victory for Bianchi at the world championship of track racing: the Grand Prix of Paris. During the existence of the Bianchi team in Italy in 1919‚Äì1920, Bianchi was also a co-sponsor of a French team that was called Peugeot-Bianchi-Pirelli which according to a historical cycling website, the team rode on Peugeot bikes. It is possible that this team rode on Bianchi bikes in Italy. The team had many famous cyclists on the team over the course of its existence. In 1945, Fausto Coppi joined the team and would stay with the team until 1956 and 1958. It has been said that the team of the mid 1940s was built around Coppi. During this time the Tour de France was disputed by national teams and Coppi won the Tour in 1949 and 1952. Coppi won the Giro d'Italia for the team in 1947, 1949, 1952 and 1953. Coppi became the first cyclist in history to achieve the Giro-Tour double. For which it was suggested at the time that he was the greatest cyclist ever seen. During this time, the directeur sportifs were Giovanni Tragella and Franco Aguggini. In the seventies, Bianchi returned as main sponsor to the peloton in the Bianchi-Campagnolo team that contained the 1972 and 1973 world champions Marino Basso and Felice Gimondi. This team was the continuation of the Salvarani team that Gimondi had started his career with and which, in 1972, was directed by 1965 Giro d'Italia champion and 1968 World Champion Vittorio Adorni who had retired from professional racing just two years previously. Adorni directed the Bianchi-Campagnolo team with Giancarlo Ferretti in 1973. Ferretti took over as the main directeur sportif of the team the following year. This team also included the four-time winner of the Vuelta a Colombia Martin Emilio Rodriguez who won stages in the Giro d'Italia. Finally Team Bianchi was main sponsor when German Jan Ullrich challenged American Lance Armstrong in the Centenary edition of the Tour de France. After the cycling season of 2003 ended, Bianchi became co-sponsor of the Alessio-Bianchi team and again they were a co-sponsor of the Liquigas- Bianchi team for the 2005 season. In 2005 Bianchi also became the co-sponsor of the Norwegian cycling team Team Maxbo Bianchi, a continental cycling team, with whom they co-sponsored until the end of the 2010 season. In October 2011, it was announced that Bianchi would be the bike sponsor of the Vancansoleil- DCM team on a two-year contract from 2012 Since 2014, Bianchi is the supplier of . Bianchi became involved in sponsorship in Mountain biking in the early nineties. Bruno Zanchi won the first World Championship for Bianchi in 1991 in the downhill speciality. Two years later, Dario Acquaroli became World Champion in cross country for Bianchi. From 2000 to 2006, the Bianchi MTB (Bianchi-Motorex and Bianchi-Agos) team dominated the sport with Jos√© Antonio Hermida and multiple World Champion Julien Absalon. In 2007 the team was renamed Gewiss-Bianchi.

There is a large Gorzan√≥w Castle in the village. It lies approximately north of Bystrzyca K≈Çodzka, south of K≈Çodzko, and south of the regional capital Wroc≈Çaw. The village has a population of 921. Name and history Saint Anthony chapel The earliest name of the locality seems to have been the German appellation Arnoldsdorf (or Arnsdorf), derived from the personal name Arnold (+dorf), probably the name of the Lokator who brought German farmers to the village. The later German name of Grafenort derives from the noble title Graf (+ort, \\"locality\\"). In the seventeenth century the owner of the village was Johann Gundacker Graf von Heberstein. The name \\"Gorzan√≥w\\" was introduced officially only after 1945.Nazwy miejscowe Polski: historia, pochodzenie, zmiany, ed. K. Rymut, vol. 3 (EI, ed.

The village discussed in the present article is listed under the name Grafenort (S≈Çownik geograficzny, vol. 2, p. 791, col. 1), without a corresponding Polish toponymic. The history of the village dates back to the 12th century, when a defensive stronghold existed at the site.Waldemar Brygier, Tomasz Dudziak, et al., Ziemia K≈Çodzka: przewodnik dla prawdziwego turysty, Piast√≥w, Oficyna Wydawnicza Rewasz, 2010, p. 328\\\\. . In the Middle Ages at various times it was part of Poland or Kingdom of Bohemia. Probably in the 14th century a royal castle was built, which was destroyed in 1470, and the remains were dismantled around 1804. It was annexed by Prussia in the 18th century and from 1871 to 1945 it was also part of Germany. The S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego states that, historically, theatrical performances were staged at \\"the beautiful castle of the Hebersteins\\" three times a week for eight months of the year, and that the place was known for its \\"steam baths\\". The village had a Catholic church, and a chapel dedicated to St. Anthony surmounting a hill of the same name, which rises to the height of 1,053 feet above sea level.

Mansur, this building burned down in the Great Fire of 1911. Its steel-framed, yellow-brick replacement was built in 1913 on Harlow Street, just across from its earlier location, from designs by the Boston architects Peabody and Stearns, who also designed the new Bangor Public Library next door. The high school moved into its present building on outer Broadway, designed by architect Eaton Tarbell, in 1964. Sports Bangor High School is known for its athletic teams and earned its 100th team state championship in 2016. Im that year, Bangor won its third consecutive Class A Baseball title.

Graduation exercises for Beal College also use the Peakes Auditorium. The school year runs from September to June. School days are 8:00 to 2:00. The day is split up into sixteen 'mods', or 20-minute blocks of time. There are five minutes between each class, and each class takes up 2 mods. Lab sciences take up 3 mods 2, 3, or 5 days a week, depending on the difficulty of the class. The school utilizes locally developed assessments to document student proficiency in Maine learning standards. Although Bangor takes students from communities lacking a high school, about 2/3 of the students come from Bangor's two public middle schools: the William S. Cohen School and the James F. Doughty School, each of which enrolls approximately 500 students.

She was used by the Union Navy first as a dispatch boat, and also as a gunboat assigned to patrol Confederate waterways.  Built in New York City in 1861  Stepping Stones -- a wooden ferryboat built at New York City in 1861 -- was purchased by the Navy at New York on , and was commissioned on or before .  Civil War operations  = Assigned Potomac River operations = The ferryboat departed New York City on 21 October, served briefly at Hampton Roads, Virginia, reached the Washington Navy Yard on 5 November, and was promptly placed in service as a dispatch boat in the Potomac Flotilla. These first few weeks of her service typified her fortunes throughout the Civil War. Her services were wanted both in the Potomac Flotilla and in the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron for service along the west coast of the Chesapeake Bay and on the rivers -- roughly parallel to the Potomac -- which drain Tidewater Virginia. As a result, the ferry was shuttled between the two commands as ground operations ebbed and flowed over the Virginia farmlands which separated Washington, D.C., and Virginia. When assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron, the ship was moved from the James, to the York, or to the Rappahannock River as demanded by the military situation ashore. = Operations on the James River in Virginia = Highlights of Stepping Stones service were the operations on the James in July 1862 to help protect General George B. McClellan's beleaguered army at Harrison's Landing. During 1863 She was stationed in the Nansemond River and participated in the Siege of Suffolk (VA) undertaken by Longstreet's Corps. One notable event was rescuing, under heavy fire, of when that ship had been grounded and disabled during and engagement with an earth works near Suffolk, Virginia. Later, after running the same battery, she made two landings against the earth works; which fell in an assault by Union Army units supported by the Stepping Stones' boat howitzers. Also notable is her participation in a mid-April 1864 Army-Navy expedition up the Nansemond River. In May 1864, she became part of a torpedo sweeping (mine sweeping) and patrol force on the James. = Capturing Confederate blockade runners = On 9 November, she captured two blockade-running sloops, Reliance and Little Elmer, in Mobjack Bay. In March 1865, less than a month before Robert E. Lee surrendered, Stepping Stones was in a naval expedition up Mattox Creek to Colonial Beach, Virginia, where the Union ships attacked a supply base for Confederate guerrillas operating on the peninsula between that river and the Potomac River.  Post-war decommissioning, sale and subsequent civilian career  After the war ended, Stepping Stones was decommissioned at the Washington Navy Yard on 23 June 1865 and was sold on 12 July 1865 to W. D. Wallach. Redocumented as Cambridge on 27 July 1865, the steamer was reduced to a barge on 2 August 1871 and soon disappeared from maritime records.

Aubert was born in Paris and became a student of Jean Baptiste Senaill√©. His first position was as violinist in the service of the Prince of Cond√©. Thereafter he was a member of the Vingt-quatre Violons du Roy. From 1728 to 1752, he was the first violinist at the Paris Op√©ra. He regularly and successfully appeared for a dozen years beginning in 1729 at the Concert Spirituel with, among other works, concertos for violin and orchestra of his own composition. thumbJacques was born in Belleville, Paris. Belleville, Paris, a small neighborhood in acre count, lies in between borderline Main Street & Rue de Belleville. Together with Jean-Joseph Cassan√©a de Mondonville and Jean-Marie Leclair, Aubert brought the zest of Italian violin virtuosity into the French musical fare of their time. He died in Belleville. Aubert's father, Jean was a member of the 24 Violins du Roi until his death in 1710, his son succeeded him and became an immediate pivot point for music in Belleville. In 1727, Aubert replaced Noel Converset, a well- respected violinist in the du Roi. He served within the years until 1746. Within a year, he took a member slot with Academie Royale and was the first Violinist there, he remained there until he earned himself a position at the Concert Spirituel in 1729. His son, Louis Aubert (painter) (1720-c.1800), was also a violinist and composer. Another son, Jean-Louis Aubert (1731‚Äì1814) was a dramatist, poet and journalist, also known as the Abb√© Aubert. Aubert's oldest son; Louis, was greatly influenced by the Italian style of music. As a back desk violinist, he played a major role in showing how much impact his father had on his very own format & techniques in music. With such drive in styles within Italian methodology, he participated in many startup Concertos and Sonatas. Aubert highlighted many French elements in his music also. Using elements such as the Gavotte, Menuet and other forms, he achieved the slow muddle movements fully written out and published them as solo pieces to the people.

The game was released on April 28, 2009 for Windows. The game restricted to free-to-play up to level 20, although there was access to additional game content via a membership fee. The game allowed the player to fight, interact with other players, and more. The game was shut down on March 31, 2014; SOE stated that It didn't have the resources to keep the game going. Business model The game was available to download and play free of charge. The PC version was accessed via the Free Realms web site or, through game arcade sites Candy Stand or Miniclip. During character creation a 3D client downloaded in the background and then streamed as the user played; the same method was used to download new content or updates, which reduced file size and download times. A version of FreeRealms for Mac was announced at SOE Fan Faire 2010 for release \\"within the next 3 months.\\" The Mac version was released on November 2, 2010. The PlayStation 3 version was released on March 31, 2011 on the US PlayStation Store and on September 11, 2011 in the EU and was accessible via the PlayStation Network. Free Realms offered an optional membership for a single player, which allowed for 3 characters to be created per account (plus other benefits such as member-only quests, jobs, and items). Only one character can be played at a time; the game will kick extra active characters. Before Free Realms was shut down, SOE planned to offer a \\"family\\" membership that would allow multiple logins at the same time. Separate to memberships is the Station Cash currency which can be used for premium features across Sony Online Entertainment games (including Free Realms). Reception In the New York Times, Free Realms was well received. The reviewer, Seth Shiesel, noted \\"For Sony Online, Free Realms is a triumph of the company‚Äôs own reinvention.\\" USA Today reviewer Marc Saltzman gave Free Realms a 4/5 score, noting \\"Sony Online Entertainment's Free Realms is an extraordinary online adventure that is sure to please tweens and teens looking for a fun and free fantasy world.\\" Eurogamer gave the game a largely positive review, MMO editor Oli Welsh describing the game as \\"an effortlessly light and addictive indulgence\\". MMOHuts gave the game a 4/5 and noted that \\"Free Realms is one of the most feature-rich free MMORPGs currently available and it‚Äôs all delivered in a beautiful package\\". In a review of Free Realms at USA Network's Character Arcade, David Chapman stated that the game \\"is a surprisingly deep game experience for a free to play model. There's never a shortage of things to do ... even if you never pay a dime to Sony.\\" John Smedley, president of Sony Online Entertainment, revealed that one million users had signed up to Free Realms 18 days after its launch; a month after release Free Realms reached two million users, and registrations have continued growing at a steady rate since then. As of July 24, 2009, it had nearly five million registered users. Sony Online Entertainment announced in February 2010 that the game had eight million registered users. In April 2010, it was announced that the game had ten million players, with two million players signing up in March 2010. Comic A Free Realms tie-in comic, published by DC Comics' Wildstorms and released for $4.99 per issue, held twelve issues each of which contained a unique one time code redeemable for an in game virtual reward. The comic was written by J.S. Lewis, writer of the \\"Gray Griffon\\" series of young-adult fantasy books, with art by Allen Martinez and Jon Buran. The comic featured Dane Kensington, an aspiring Brawler who set out on his adventure in hopes of becoming stronger. Possible revival Shortly after the game shut down, a small team of community developers known as Kaldron Interactive announced plans to revive the game via an emulator known as Free Realms: Sunrise. Development on the emulator began in late 2015, and the application experienced a short period of alpha testing in April 2017. As of December 2019 main Developer Mayhem has started weekly updates showcasing progress of the game. According to him the release will be a surprise.

She was involved in the capture of Fort Graville on 6 February, and Camp de Louise on 8 February.Fonds Marine, Vol. 1, p.268. On 28 June 1803, as she sailed with the frigate Poursuivante, she encountered a British convoy off San Domingo, part of the Blockade of Saint-Domingue. One of the escorts, HMS Goliath, was sailing inshore off Cape Nicholas Mole, to try to find two vessels seen earlier. She encountered Mignonne at 10:45, and after a few shots captured her at 11:45.Troude (1867), pp.44-45. In Captain James Brisbane's words, Mignonne was a \\"remarkable fast sailing Ship Corvette\\". She carried sixteen long 18-pounder guns, six of which she had landed. Her crew of only 80 men was under Commander Jean-Pierre Bargeau,Fonds Marine, p.286 and she was two days out of Aux-Cayes, sailing to France via the Cape.

The Royal Navy took her into service as the 18-gun ship sloop-of-war HMS Mignonne, but never commissioned her. Her captain was Commander Edward Hawker.He had been promoted to Commander in 1803 and he received his promotion to post captain in June 1804, though he served on Mignonne for some time thereafter. In June 1804 Mignonne ran ashore off Lucca, Jamaica.

Background Shrewsbury was the second but eldest surviving son of Charles Chetwynd-Talbot, 2nd Earl Talbot, by his marriage to Frances Thomasine, a daughter of Charles Lambart. He was styled Viscount Ingestre from the death of his elder brother in 1826 and succeeded his father as 3rd Earl Talbot in 1849. In 1860, following a long and expensive legal case in the House of Lords, and against the claims of three others (Lord Edmund Howard Talbot, infant son of the 14th Duke of Norfolk by whom he was represented, Princess Dorio Pamphili (daughter of John, 16th Earl) and Major Talbot (descendant of William, 4th Earl),Dublin Evening Packet and Correspondent and others 26 May 1857 he succeeded to the titles and estates (including Alton Towers) of a distant cousin and became 18th Earl of Shrewsbury and 18th Earl of Waterford. Military career Talbot (as he then was) entered the Royal Navy in 1817. He commanded at the Battle of Navarino, and was picked by Vice- Admiral Codrington to bring home the despatches announcing the victory. He was soon after promoted to captain. On 9 March 1831, his father, the Lord Lieutenant of Staffordshire, commissioned him a lieutenant in the Staffordshire Yeomanry, which he gave up in 1833. On 2 June 1832 his father appointed him lieutenant-colonel of the Staffordshire Militia, which he resigned in early 1846. He was promoted a rear-admiral in 1854 and a vice- admiral and admiral in 1865. As Viscount Ingestre, while serving in the House of Commons, he was a leading supporter of the charlatan naval inventor Samuel Alfred Warner. Political career Ingestre was returned to Parliament as one of two representatives for Hertford in 1830. In May of the following year he was elected for Armagh City, a seat he only held until August 1831, and then represented Dublin City until 1832. In 1832 he was once again returned for Hertford. However, the election was declared void on petition in 1833. He returned to the House of Commons as one of the two representatives for Staffordshire South in 1837, a seat he held until he succeeded his father in the Talbot earldom in 1849. After entering the House of Lords he served under the Earl of Derby as a Lord-in-waiting (government whip in the House of Lords) in 1852 and as Captain of the Honourable Corps of Gentlemen-at-Arms from 1858 to 1859.Kidd, Charles, Williamson, David (editors).

These councils did not universally represent the church and are not counted among the official ecumenical councils. Early synodal councils of Reims *The first synod, said to have been held at Reims by Archbishop Sonnatius between 624 and 630, is probably identical with that held at Clichy (Clippiacum) in 626 or 627. * In 813 Archbishop Wulfar presided at a synod of reform (Werminghoff in \\"Mon. Germ. Hist.: Concilia aevi Carol. I\\", I, Hanover, 1904, 253 sq.). Council of Reims, 991 Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims at the Council of Reim, 991 A council, usually called the Synod of St-Basle, was convoked at Reims by King Hugues Capet, assisted by Gerbert of Aurillac, later Pope Sylvester II, to consider the case of Arnulf, Archbishop of Reims, illegitimate son of the late King Lothair. Arnulf was accused of conspiring with his uncle, Charles, Duke of Lower Lorraine, against Hugh Capet. He was duly deposed by the council, and Gerbert appointed in his place. This was done without the approval of Pope John XV, who refused to accept either Arnulf's removal or Gerbert's appointment. The matter dragged on until 995 when Arnulf was restored, and was only completely resolved by Pope Gregory V in 997.Rich√©, Pierre (1983), Les Carolingiens: Une famille qui fit l'Europe, Paris: Hachette, pp. 306 & 321‚Äì322. Council of Reims, 1049 In 1049 Pope Leo IX was invited to be present at the consecration of the church of Abbey of Saint-Remi at Reims. He accepted the invitation and announced that he would at the same time hold a council. This irritated King Henry I of France, since it was generally held that no pope could hold a council in Kingdom of France without first consulting the king, which Leo IX had neglected to do. Consequently, in order to frustrate Leo IX, Henry I ordered all of his vassals to attend a feudal levy at the very time that the council was to be held. This placed the bishops and abbots in France in a very difficult position: they were ordered by Leo IX to attend the council; they were ordered by Henry I to attend the levy. Henry I hoped that his action would prevent the holding of the council, but Leo IX went on with his preparations without paying any attention to Henry I's act. The council was held at the appointed time, and in addition to churchmen from other lands about one-third of the bishops and abbots from the king's territory attended. Those who were absent with Henry I were excommunicated by Leo IX. Then Leo IX took up cases of simony and other ecclesiastical crimes which were reported. Several of those who were present at the council and held high offices in the church were accused of very serious offenses. Leo IX did not push any of them to an extreme, even when the guilt seemed definitely known, but adjourned all of the cases to his own court at Rome. Leo IX acted in the same way with regard to the accusations made against the great nobles. By this policy Leo IX hoped to have the authority of the papacy fully recognized. He was able to accomplish so much because of the weakness of the French monarchy. Leo IX was aided by Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor, in other attempts at reform, with whom he worked apparently in complete concord. Leo IX died in 1054 without having an opportunity to see the full effect of his act which had done so much to strengthen the power of the papacy. Three canons of this council were legislated about simony. Hugo of Breteuil, bishop of Langres, was accused of simony and extortion, fled the proceedings, was deposed, and excommunicated. According to Eamon Duffy, \\"In one week, Leo had asserted papal authority, as it had never been asserted before\\". The Council excommunicated Geoffrey II, Count of Anjou, for the imprisonment of Gervais de Ch√¢teau-du-Loir, bishop of Le Mans. The Council has a dogmatic declaration about the primacy of the Bishop of Rome: \\"'.\\" See 12th century * In 1115, a synod was held at which the cardinal legate Cuno of Praeneste excommunicated Emperor Henry V. * In 1119, Pope Calistus II convened a synod for the purpose of concluding peace with Henry V. There were present 15 archbishops, over 200 bishops and as many abbots. * In 1131, a Council of Reims met. * Council of Reims (1148) Later councils * In 1164 Pope Alexander III presided at a synod which urged the crusade against Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. * In 1407 Archbishop Guido III convened a synod to abolish the abuses that had crept into the Church of Reims during the Western Schism. * In 1528 Archbishop Robert III held a synod against Martin Luther. * In 1564 Cardinal Charles of Lorraine convened a reformatory synod to enforce the Tridentine Council decrees. * In 1583 Cardinal Francis of Guise held a synod at which 27 reformatory decrees were enacted. * After a lapse of almost three centuries Cardinal Gousset, Archbishop of Reims, convoked a synod at Soissons in 1849; another, at Amiens in 1853; a third, at Reims itself in 1857. The acts of the last three synods are printed in \\"Collectio Lacensis\\", IV, 91-246.

Following her return, the ship sailed again 12 May for New Guinea to debark 3,400 troops at Oro Bay, and steamed thence to New York, where she arrived 3 July 1944. Convoyed by ships and planes and under constant threat of submarine attack, General J. R. Brooke operated in the Atlantic throughout the remainder of the war. In her unflagging efforts to insure an even flow of men from the United States to the European Theater, she made 12 transatlantic voyages (8 from New York, 2 from Boston, and 2 from Norfolk) to the United Kingdom (Plymouth, Liverpool, and Southampton); Italy (Naples); France (Cherbourg, Marseilles, and Le Havre); and North Africa (Oran) from 26 July 1944 to 5 September 1945. She brought to the European ports tens of thousands of American and Allied fighting men and thousands of tons of vital supplies; and she brought to the United States countless German prisoners of war (POWs). thumb After the war's end, General J. R. Brooke made two \\"Magic-Carpet\\" and troop-rotation voyages from New York to Calcutta and Ceylon via the Suez Canal from 11 September 1945 to 3 January 1946. Subsequently, she made five identical troop-carrying voyages from New York to Le Havre between 19 January and 10 June 1946. In May 1946 she transported over 2,700 German POW's back to France. General J. R. Brooke moored at Norfolk 13 June and decommissioned at Newport News 3 July 1946. Returned to the WSA on 18 July 1946, she entered the National Defense Reserve Fleet, James River, Virginia. She was sold to Bethlehem Steel Wilmington of Wilmington, Delaware in April 1964, rebuilt as a general cargo ship for Bethlehem's subsidiary Calmar Line, and renamed SS Marymar, USCG ON 294730, IMO 6413742.

The British captured her in 1809 and she the served with the Royal Navy under the name Jewel, and later Alcmene until she was broken up in 1816. French service She was built in Nantes in 1803 on plans by Pierre-Alexandre-Laurent Forfait and launched on 1 March 1805. She was put into service in September.Winfield and Roberts (2015), p.146. She departed from Nantes in June 1805 for Fort-de-France to carry new instructions to Admiral Villeneuve, but failed to reach him as the fleet was already heading for Europe. On 19 July she was the lead vessel of a squadron of four vessels that captured . The other three were the 22-gun corvette D√©partment des Landes, the 18-gun Torche, and the 16-gun brig-corvette Faune.Walters (1949), p.35-6. On 14 August, a British squadron comprising the 74-gun , and HMS Raisonnable captured Faune, which was trailing. Two days later, the British caught up with the three remaining ships, and Baudin had to abandon Torche, which surrendered after a token resistance against Goliath.Troude (1867), pp.427. Raissonable chased Topaze, which she engaged in the morning of 17 August. The two ships were becalmed at first and unable to manoeuver, until Topaze caught some breeze. Baudin prepared to board Raisonnable, but abandoned the project after considering that his frigate was ferrying the crew of Blanche; he later told Captain Mudge to testify that Raisonnable would have been taken, had it not been for Mudge's presence on Topaze. On 13 January 1803, Topaze, Pierre-Nicolas Lahalle, approached Cayenne. She was carrying flour and was under orders to avoid combat. At the time, the sloop HMS Confiance was at Cayenne, supporting the Portuguese conquest of French Guiana. However, three-quarters of her crew, as well as her captain, James Lucas Yeo, were ashore, attacking the French defenders. Midshipman G. Yeo, Yeo's younger brother, another midshipman, the remaining 25 men of the crew, and 20 local Negroes that the two midshipmen induced to join them, set sail towards Topaze. Topaze, judging from the sloop's boldness that she had company that would be forthcoming, turned away.Long (1895), pp.149-50. A little over a week later, Topaze met HMS Cleopatra, which captured Topaze in the subsequent action of 22 January 1809.Norton Shaw, Hume Greenfield, Henry Walter Bates. (1851). The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. Volume 20. (p. xxxv). The British took her into the Royal Navy as HMS Jewel. British service Alcmene and the Squadron under the command of Sir James Brisbane attacking Fort Maurigio on 11 April 1814 After the loss of Alcmene in 1809, Jewel was renamed Alcmene later that year. On 5 October 1809 Alcmene was in company with and and all three shared in proceeds of the capture of George. Prize money was forwarded in 1815 from the Vice admiralty court in Antigua. On 23 December 1813, Alcmene captured the Cerf-class schooner Fleche between Corsica and Cape Delle Molle. Fleche was armed with 12 guns, and carried a crew of 99 men and 24 soldiers. She was carrying the soldiers from Toulon to Corsica. French records place the capture off Vintimilles, and add the Fleche was escorting the storeships Lybio and Baleine, which were also carrying troops for Ajaccio, Corsica. That same day drove Baleine, ashore near Calvi, where she bilged on the rocks. Baleine was armed with 22 guns and carried a crew of 120 men. Alcmene was in company with and on 11 April 1814 when they captured Fortune, Notre Dame de Leusainte, and a settee of unknown name. On 13 May 1815 Alcmene, with Captain Jeremiah Coghlan in command, was present at the surrender of Naples during the Neapolitan War. A British squadron, consisting of Alcmene, and more importantly the 74-gun , the sloop , and the brig-sloop blockaded the port and destroyed all the gunboats there. Parliament voted a grant of ¬£150,000 to the officers and men of the squadron for the property captured at the time, with the money being paid in May 1819. On 6 July, Alcmene captured the French naval schooner Antelope (Antilope) off Sardinia. Antilope was a Cerf-class schooner armed with two chase guns of 6 or 8-pounds, and two 24-pounder carronades. She had a complement of 86 men and displaced 273 tons (French).Winfield and Roberts (2015), p. 252. Fate The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy offered the \\"Topaze, of 38 guns and 917 tons\\", lying at Portsmouth, for sale on 11 August 1814. The buyer had to post a bond of ¬£3,000, with two guarantors, that they would break up the vessel within a year of purchase. Topaze did not sell immediately and was not broken up until February 1816.

He has also represented England playing for the England Saxons and England Sevens sides. Early life Born 9 October 1983 in Harlow, Skirving was educated at The Bishop's Stortford High School and showed early promise as a rugby player, captaining England U16s against Wales in 2000. He played for local side Bishop's Stortford Rugby Club before joining the Saracens academy system in 1999. Club career After joining Saracens' academy system in 1999 Skirving worked his way through the club's development sides before making his first team debut against Leeds Tykes in the final fixture of 2002. There were to be a handful of further first team appearances in the 2002‚Äì03 season both in the starting line up and from the bench. Places in the starting line up were hard to come by in the succeeding two seasons, with competition from established players such as Taine Randell, however Skirving appeared with increasing regularity from the replacements bench, giving him the opportunity to make his mark as an emerging talent. Further international recognition came at the end of the 2004‚Äì05 season, where his pace brought him a place in the England Sevens squad. The 2005‚Äì06 season was set fair for Skirving to establish himself at the top level, making regular first team starting appearances and scoring his maiden try in the top flight. Further success came in the form of a debut at England 'A' level in February 2006, before a shoulder injury cut short his season. Skirving's comeback in the 2006‚Äì07 season was hampered by a pre-season injury but he was soon a regular fixture in the starting line up, passing the 100 cap mark for the club during the year at the age of just 22. His displays brought another call-up for the rebranded England 'A' team, now the England Saxons to take part in the 2007 Churchill Cup, unusually to be held in England. Skirving though was to travel to South Africa to take the place of the injured Peter Buxton in the full England squad for their two test series against the Springboks. Skirving was not involved in the first test, but won his first England cap starting the second test on 2 June 2007. He was called into the England Saxons squad to face Italy A in Ragusa, Sicily on 9 February 2008. Skirving was one of 15 players told in February that they could leave Saracens at the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. On 16 April 2009, it was confirmed that Skirving had signed a two-year deal with Bath Rugby. On 12 March 2013, Skirving left Bath to join Bristol in the RFU Championship for the 2013/14 season. In September 2015, Skirving has been the Head of Rugby at Hymers College, Hull. And in 2020, he became head of rugby at churchers college, Petersfield .

Historically Drypool was a village, manor and later parish on the east bank of the River Hull near the confluence of the Humber Estuary and River Hull; it is now part of the greater urban area of Kingston upon Hull, and gives its name to a local government ward. Modern Drypool ward is a mixture of light industrial developments and housing, mainly terraced, as well as the post 1980s housing development 'Victoria Dock Village' built on the infilled site of the former Victoria Dock. The area also includes 'The Deep' aquarium, several schools, and a swimming baths. Geography =Drypool ward= The local government ward of Drypool (2001) has its north-east border formed by Laburnum Avenue and Chamberlain Road, south-west of East Park, and its western border former by the River Hull, and its eastern border former by New Bridge Road, and the eastern limit of the Victoria Dock Village estate (Earle's Road). The population of the ward in 2001 was about 12,500. The local government ward of Drypool includes the entirely industrial area known as The Groves on Stoneferry Road, a western part of the area of Summergangs including the Garden Village estate and the house and grounds of Holderness House. Also within the ward are the Victoria Dock Village, the area known as Garrison Side including Sammy's Point and The Deep aquarium. The south-western part of Holderness Road lies in the ward; including the Mount Retail Park (2002), East Hull Baths (1898) and listed James Reckitt Library (1889), and the area known as Witham. The Drypool Ward includes four primary schools: Buckingham Primary School, Craven Primary School, Mersey Primary School and Victoria Dock Primary School. It also includes much of the catchment area for Westcott Primary School (formerly Archbishop William Temple CoE Primary). The current catchment secondary school is David Lister on Rustenburg Street, but this is due to change to Malet Lambert School on James Reckitt Avenue. Drypool Ward is an electoral district returning three councillors to Hull City Council. Both Labour and Liberal Democrat party candidates have been elected since 2007 in a roughly two-way split of votes.Sources:   =Drypool Parish= The Anglican Parish of Drypool covers a larger area than the council ward, taking in parts of Southcoates West and Holderness Wards, with a catchment population of over 24,000; the parishes regular services take place in the churches of St Columba of Iona, St John the Evangelist, and Victoria Dock Church which (as of 2010) uses Victoria Dock Village Hall for public worship.  History  Hollar's map of Hull. (up is roughly east) The hamlet of Drypool lay on the east bank of the River Hull, roughly opposite the Old Town; it is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it is said that the two manors of \\"Sotecote and Dridpol\\" were worth thirty shillings at the time of Edward the Confessor. Both manors were owned by Drogo de Bevrere, a relative by marriage of William I. Drypool was a chapelry of the parish of Swine; the region consisted mostly of floodable low-lying land or fen; Drypool, literally meaning \\"Dried up pool\\" was one of the areas (along with Southcoates) which was sufficiently raised to be habitable. To the north-east of the hamlet was the area known as Summergangs, a region of Ings only usable in summer. During the early medieval period work was undertaken to improve the land by drainage; in the 13th century Saer de Sutton created a drainage ditch (later known as Summergangs Dike), and is thought to have diverted the River Hull along a new more easterly route, along the stream known as 'Sayer's Creek'; these waterways, along with the River Wilflete and the Humber later formed the boundaries of parish of Drypool. In 1302 a road from Hull to Hedon was made into a King's highway; it which originated at the River Hull, passing through Drypool and then roughly north-eastwards through 'Suttecotes Som'gang' (Summergangs) passing Southcoates at the west side before joining the old Sutton to Hedon road at Bilton; this was later to become Holderness Road (A165). There were jetties on the river at Drypool, one was removed in 1470, possibly due to silting of the haven, or due to the threat of invasion. There was also a staith for the 'north ferry' across the Hull; it became obsolete after the North Bridge was built as part of Henry VIII's fortifications of Hull. During the Pilgrimage of Grace (1536) Hull had been taken by the rebels. After the rebellion Henry VIII ordered improvements to the fortifications of the town; these included the construction (1540s) of a castle (Hull Castle) and blockhouses with connecting wall on the Drypool side of the river, as well as a bridge connecting the two banks at a cost of ¬£23,155 17s 5d. After the restoration of Charles II of England the obsolete fortifications on the east bank of the river were extended and improved, at the same time incorporating a garrison into the city which had sided with the Parliamentarians during the Civil War; the new fortress, built in the 1680s, named \\"The Citadel\\" was a moated triangular bastioned artillery fortification built in the south-west corner of Drypool; approximately of land was taken by the new fortification. The area of the citadel became known as Garrison Side, and was an extra- parochial area (1880s). Drypool fell within the Parish of Swine until the 17th century, when a new parish of Drypool cum Southcoates was created. By 1821 Drypool had a population of 1409, increased from about 800 in 1811, and about 400 in 1801; by the 1820s the urban growth was such that it had become part of the greater Hull conurbation. Drypool (with the parish of Drypool cum Southcoates) was formally incorporated into Kingston upon Hull in 1837. By 1849 the Citadel was out of military use, and in 1863‚Äì64 the site was sold, and the structure demolished. Victoria Dock had been constructed north-east of the garrison between 1845 and 1850.SPG Note 27 Heritage & Development Management at Garrison Side.., section 27.8 The Dock company, having acquired the site of the Citadel, began to develop it, laying out streets,SPG Note 27 Heritage & Development Management at Garrison Side.., section 27.11 a toll bridge connecting to the west bank was also built in 1865 (demolished 1944), known as South Bridge or \\"Ha'penny Bridge\\". Building development on the garrison site was limited; by 1890 the site was used primarily for timber storage, with extensive railway sidings.Ordnance Survey. 1:2500. 1893 The area was heavily damaged by bombing during the Hull Blitz of the Second World War. Victoria Dock closed in 1970.SPG Note 27 Heritage & Development Management at Garrison Side.., section 27.12 In 1981 the A63 road (Garrison Road section) was constructed through the parish,SPG Note 27 Heritage & Development Management at Garrison Side.., section 27.13 which included the construction of a new swing bridge over the River Hull, Myton Bridge. The Victoria Dock site was redeveloped as Victoria Dock Village in the 1990s with about 2,500 houses.  Architecture =Churches= ;Anglican thumb The Domesday Book does not mention a church in Drypool, though one is shown on a drawing of 1350; some archaeological evidence suggests a date of as early as the 12th century for its construction. The original church of St Peter was demolished in 1822, being in ruinous condition; and with the intention of building a new larger vessel, with over a 1,000 seats, increased from 200. The new church was designed by William Hutchinson and had a four bayed nave incorporating the former church's arches and windows, with a four-storey tower, and was entirely rendered in cement, it was completed in 1823. The church's chancel was rebuilt in 1867. St Peter's remained in use until 1941 when it was destroyed during the Second World War. There was briefly a church in the former cemetery on Hedon Road, first called St Nathaniel, later St Bartholemew's; it was used to service the growth of population due to the construction, and operation of Alexandra Dock. Initially a sacristy (the mortuary chapel) in the cemetery was used, in 1891 replaced by an iron church of the tin tabernacle type. The church closed and was demolished in 1929; the cemetery was later converted into park gardens by Hull City Corporation. The church of St Andrew was consecrated in 1878; designed by architects 'Adams & Kelly' in Geometric Decorated Gothic style of brick with stone; it was built in response to the expansion of the east of the town due to the construction of Victoria Dock, and became the parish church in 1879. The parish church became St Columba in 1961. St Andrews has been demolished. The church of St Columba in the Garden Village area of Summergangs became the parish church for Drypool in 1961. On Rosmead Street another temporary church was opened in 1919, but burnt to the ground in 1923. A permanent replacement 'St John the Evangelist' was built 1925, but was bombed in 1941 during the Second World War, after repairs it was reopened in 1952. In The Groves in the parish of Sutton was St Mark's, built in brick with stone facings 1844 in early medieval style. It was bomb damaged during the Second World War and demolished in the late 1950s. ;Other denominations The Roman Catholic church of St Mary's was built in 1890/1891, supplementing a school with chapel built in 1856. It was demolished in 1982. The Wesleyan Methodist Holderness Road Methodist Chapel was opened in 1962, replacing the 1877 Brunswick Chapel on the same site, built to replace a temporary school and church built in 1873 nearby on Durham Street. There was also a church on Lime Street in The Groves built 1826. It was later used as a Sunday School, then by the Methodists, then as a warehouse. Another building on Church Street/Raikes Street corner (Drypool) was built in 1805, used first as Sunday school, and from 1877 (to 1930) as a chapel. Both were superseded by Kingston Chapel, built in a Greek architectural style with an Ionic portico. It opened in 1841, with about 2,000 seats.Ordnance Survey, 1856, 1:1056 The chapel was damaged in 1941 by bombing, and later demolished. An independent church on Holborn Street (Witham) was built in 1830, after 1860 it was used by the Primitive Methodists. It closed in 1954. The primitive Methodists also had chapels at Hodgson Street (The Groves), built 1884, closed 1940; also at Bright Street (Holderness Road), an Italianate style red and white brick building with over 1,000 seats opened 1864, it was bomb damaged in 1941, and demolished 1964; and at the Bethesda Chapel, Holland Street (Holderness Road), built 1902, closed 1962; and the Henry Hodge Memorial Chapel in Williamson Street, built 1873 and closed 1940. The Congregationalist Latimer Church in Williamson Street, was built in 1875 in red and white brick in gothic style. In 1923 it was taken over by the Port of Hull Society for the Religious Instruction of Seamen. The Salvation Army built a Citadel in Franklin Street in 1970, closed in 2006 and converted to housing. A Presbyterian church in the Gothic Revival style was built in 1874 on Holderness Road, it was bomb damaged in 1941, and was demolished in 1972 (part of the adjacent Sunday School remains). There is a modern Evangelical Presbyterian church on Holderness Road. =Other structures= East Hull Baths (2006) The East Hull Baths (Holderness Road) opened in 1898, and are adjacent to the James Reckitt Library. The building is of red brick with ashlar banding and decoration, the interior includes Art Nouveau tiled decorations. The building remained in use as council run public baths until April 2018 when it closed, with swimming facilities transferring to the nearby Woodford Leisure Centre which had been renovated. The James Reckitt Public Library (Holderness Road) opened in 1889 adjacent to the East Hull Baths to serve the east of Hull. It was Hull's first free library and was established by James Reckitt with more than 8,000 books. The library was donated to the borough of Hull in 1892 when the city adopted the Public Libraries Act. The building, designed by Albert Gelder was built of red brick with some ashlar window and banding features in a gothic revival style, a pyramidal tower roof was lost due to bomb damage during the Second World War, the remainder of the building is a listed structure. The library closed in 2006. The striking building housing the Deep public aquarium is situated at Sammy's Point, at the confluence of the River Hull and the Humber Estuary. It was designed by Sir Terry Farrell, and construction completed in 2001.  Notable people  *John Venn (1834‚Äì1923), logician and inventor of the Venn Diagram, was born in Drypool, son of Rev.

Davids Immediately, Bernard was sent to the Church of St. Mary Overie and made a priest, that same day; the following day he was made a Bishop, in Westminster Abbey. At that time, the lands of the Bishop were a quasi-sovereign territory,Francis Jones, The Lordship and Manors of Dewsland in Journal of the Historical Society of the Church in Wales, Volume 16, page 15 a status confirmed that year by Henry I when Bernard, after acknowledging Henry as suzerain of the Bishop's realm, was given a charter by the king which designated the lands - Dewisland - as a Marcher Lordship.Judgement in Crown Estate Commissioners v (1) Mark Andrew Tudor Roberts (2) Trelleck Estate Ltd: ChD (Mr Justice Lewison), 13 June 2008 Bernard was thus the head of the Judicial system in Dewisland, could mint coinage, levy tax, raise an army, and declare war on other Marcher Lords, without falling foul of the king. Furthermore, Bernard disputed the authority of the Archbishop of Canterbury over him, arguing that he himself was the metropolitan of Wales; he was the last bishop to dispute the primacy of the see of Canterbury.

Music The song follows the plot of the main story of the album. For more information of it, see the plot at the article of the album. It is the seventh day, and Best Friend decides to make an attempt to reach Me through his position, and decides to take Me back to the days when they were young, when they didn't have a worry in the world. Best Friend calls to Me, telling him to come back to the real world, in pain. Me feels as if he is trapped, and tries to shout, but something holds him back; as if his quest was not yet complete. Though in this version there's an extended bridge before a different tone of the ending; whereas in the album version Me's screams end the song to dark powerchords to represent his plight, the ending of Come back to Me is more upbeat, the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù arpeggios keep playing, Arjen keeps singing the chorus with Me's screams repeated.

On that day, at the Frenzenberg Castle in Weisweiler, Germany, Sheridan exposed himself to intense fire in order to blast a hole through the doors of the enemy-held castle with his bazooka. He successfully created a gap in the doors, but was killed after charging through it. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor six months later, on May 30, 1945.

He was killed in 1942 by a bomb dropped from an American B-25 Mitchell bomber, the tenth American war correspondent killed in action in the war. Darnton's work in reporting on the war in the Pacific was respected by military officials, including General Douglas MacArthur, who personally reported Darnton‚Äôs death to the Times and Darnton‚Äôs widow.  Journalism career  Darnton was born November 8, 1897 in Adrian, Michigan. His interest in journalism began in adolescence, when he and his family visited his uncle Charles Darnton, a drama critic for Joseph Pulitzer's Evening World in New York, New York. After leaving high school in 1917, Darnton joined the American Expeditionary Force and served in World War I,Time, Nov. 2, 1942, accessed November 5, 2007 before returning to the United States and entering the University of Michigan, where he joined the fraternity of Sigma Phi. The Sandusky Herald in Sandusky, Ohio, provided Darnton‚Äôs entry to the newspaper industry; he followed this with a stint at The Baltimore Sun. Darnton also provided several short stories to The Smart Set magazine, then edited by H.L. Mencken, who attempted to convince Darnton to shift his attention to writing fiction. Instead, Darnton went on to write for the Philadelphia Bulletin and Philadelphia Evening Ledger, then in 1925 moved to the New York Post, where his work on the rewrite desk earned him the sobriquet, \\"the all-American rewrite man\\". Then, after a period as the Associated Press city editor in New York, he joined the staff of The New York Times in 1934.  With The New York Times  At The New York Times, Darnton was selected to establish the newspaper‚Äôs ‚ÄúReview of the Week‚Äù section for a time, but in 1939 returned to reporting, and in 1940 began roving assignments that took him around the United States and eventually into the Pacific theater. During that period, he was married to Eleanor Choate and had two sons. His first overseas assignment was in February 1941, when he was among the first correspondents to leave the United States for Australia. Once there, he took the first opportunity to move to forward bases in New Guinea, where the United States 32nd Infantry Division had been designated to be one of the first U.S. units to attack the Japanese. Darnton had served with the 32nd Infantry Division during World War I and was looking forward to reporting its operations in World War II. He was based near Port Moresby and his reporting included his characteristic wit through amusing anecdotes related by servicemen, and discussed the mood of the troops on the ground and their thoughts regarding the war and its future. On October 18, 1942, Darnton was aboard the King John, a seventy-foot wooden trawler of the Small Ships Section of U.S. Army Services of Supply SWPA that was also carrying 102 troops of the 128th Infantry, off the coast of Pongani in New Guinea when a B-25 mistook the ships for Japanese vessels and bombed and strafed them. Darnton, suffering a shrapnel head wound, died in a boat on the way to shore and Lt. Adam Bruce Fahnestock, prewar South Seas explorer and then head of the Small Ships Section, hit in the spine, died in the arms of the King John's severely wounded Australian Chief Engineer moments after reaching shore. His notebook, which was taken from his body by a fellow correspondent and returned to his son, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist John Darnton in 1976, ended with a question about the bomber that would end his life: ‚ÄúJap or ours?‚ÄùIn the Name of the Father, John Darnton, The New York Times, October 16, 2005, accessed November 5, 2007 Darnton‚Äôs passing was marked by many other journalists and officials, including General Douglas MacArthur, who wired to The Times that ‚ÄúHe served with gallantry and devotion at the front and fulfilled the important duties of war correspondent with distinction to himself and The New York Times and with value to his country.‚Äù Major General Edwin F. Harding of the 32nd Infantry Division wrote that, \\"Everyone hereabouts is distressed over the death of Darnton and [Lt. A. B.] Fahnestock. I knew Darnton quite well... and considered him one damn good correspondent and swell guy. He was hot to be on the spot for the first contact of American Army ground troops with the Japs. I told him that this would probably be it and gave him permission to go.\\" Darnton was buried with full military honors at an Australian-American cemetery outside Port Moresby. Darnton and Fahnestock were buried side by side with British, Australian and American war correspondents acting as pall bearers.  The Byron Darnton  In 1943, a 10,500-ton Liberty ship was christened with Darnton‚Äôs name in Baltimore, Maryland. The ship was launched by his widow Eleanor and her sons, John and Bob. Bob wrote his name on the hull in crayon. Both sons followed in their father's footsteps and became journalists. John Darnton joined The New York Times as a copy boy in 1966 and went on to work for The New York Times for four decades. He received the Pulitzer Prize in 1982 for his coverage of Poland under martial law when he smuggled stories out of the country. Robert later became a renowned cultural historian. The ship sailed a regular run to Murmansk through the remainder of the war. On March 16, 1946, the Byron Darnton ran aground in an easterly gale off the coast of Sanda Island in the North Channel off the coast of Scotland. In 2003, a pub was opened on Sanda Island named the Byron Darnton. The owner says it is one of the two most remote pubs in the country.

Named for Secretary of the Treasury Samuel D. Ingham, she was the first United States warship to engage a Mexican ship in combat; and for her service in that battle, a newspaper called her Semper Paratus (always ready), which later became the motto of the United States Coast Guard. Ingham was sold in 1836 to the Republic of Texas and served in the Texas Navy until she was captured as a prize-of-war by Mexico and was rechristened Independencia. History of the cutter The Morris-Taney class cutters were the backbone of the Revenue Cutter Service for more than a decade from 1830‚Äì1840. Samuel Humphreys designed these cutters for roles as diverse as fighting pirates, privateers, combating smugglers and operating with naval forces. He designed the vessels on a naval schooner concept. They had Baltimore Clipper lines. The vessels were built by Webb and Allen, and designed by Isaac Webb. They resembled Humphreys' design, but had one less port. Career The Ingham was initially stationed at New Orleans, Louisiana. She did a short term of duty in Baltimore, Maryland during late 1831 and returned to duty in New Orleans in January 1832. The revenue cutters in New Orleans were increasingly monitoring the situation in Texas, because settlers and merchant traffic between the United States and the Mexican province of Texas mostly traveled by sea and usually through New Orleans. Starting in 1835, the central Mexican government attempted to collect excise taxes and disrupt trafficking in slaves into Texas. This led to seizures of Texan-owned and American-owned and flagged vessels, the most famous being the American merchant ship Martha. She was seized on 7 May 1835, by the Mexican schooner Montezuma and the Americans on board were held as prisoners. The Ingham, under Captain Ezekiel Jones, was dispatched to the Texas coast to monitor the situation and on 14 June, near Brazos Santiago, Montezuma fired on Ingham and the fire was returned. There is some discrepancy as to whether the Mexican warship was trying to evade battle once she realized the identity of the ship she had fired on, but Captain Jones did not allow Montezuma to evade the battle. Eventually the Mexican schooner ran aground and Ingham broke off the battle, having fired 13 guns. These became the first conflict between Mexican and United States forces and are considered by some historians as the first broadside of the Texas Revolution. The following day General Martin Cos ordered the release of the Marthas passengers. In January 1836 the Ingham was sold to the Republic of Texas for $1,710 and Captain Jones was duly transferred to another command within the Revenue Service. The newspaper, the New Orleans Bee wrote about Jones, \\"his prompt and efficient action in the affair of the Montezuma, has taught a neighboring state a valuable lesson of respect for our flag...\\" and concerning the Ingham, the paper wrote, \\"the vessel is entitled to bear the best motto for a military public servant‚ÄîSEMPER PARATUS.\\" The United States Coast Guard would adopt Semper Paratus (always ready) as their motto in 1896. Subsequent career Ingham became the Independence in the Texas Navy, and was later captured by the Mexicans and renamed the Independencia.

The Spaniards and their Neapolitan allies under General De Gages were fought to a standstill by the Austrians and their Sardinian allies under Field Marshal Traun on the Panaro. The Spanish sustained heavy casualties, but as darkness fell, Traun ordered a general retreat; de Gages, rather than pursue, himself drew back over the river. Preliminary Maneuvering In January 1743, General De Gages' Spanish army--13,000 strong--lay at Bologna, south of the Panaro. Count Traun's Austrian and Piedmont-Sardinian army--11,000 strong--lay to the north of the river, blocking De Gages' attempts to cross the formidable barrier. Traun preferred a maneuvering defense to risking his army in a pitched battle with his opponent, but concerns in Madrid were more political than strategic. Needing a victory, Philip V of Spain and his Queen Elizabeth Farnese demanded that De Gages launch an offensive or tender his resignation. Accordingly, leaving Bologna on the night of 3 February, De Gages slipped across the Panaro and entered the Duchy of Modena, seeking a decisive encounter with Traun. Fortunately for De Gages, Marshal Traun was ready to oblige him. Aware of the criticism leveled at him in Vienna where his enemies were trying to relieve him of his command, and also that Spain's recent seizure of Savoy might well induce the King of Sardinia to negotiate with the Spanish Crown, the Marshal decided that a victory would quell the uproar and induce Austria's allies to think twice about negotiating. Gathering up his army, Traun moved to block De Gages' path and prevent him from advancing further into Modena. The two armies met at the village of Camposanto. The battle On the morning of the battle, De Gages drew up his army on the outskirts of the village in the traditional fashion with his infantry in the centre and the cavalry on the wings. Traun also drew up his army in the same way, but being slightly outnumbered, he chose to gamble with an un-orthodox strategy. Instead of aligning himself directly opposite the Spaniards, he shifted his troops to the northwest, which meant that the centre of Traun's infantry was directly opposite the gap between Gages' infantry and the right wing of cavalry. Although this meant that Traun would have a greater superiority of numbers on this wing and that he could also deliver a flank attack on the Spanish right, his own right flank would, however, be vulnerable to a Spanish flank attack. It seems that the Marshall was relying on the troops of that wing to delay the Spanish long enough for the action on his other wing to be decisive. Matters were helped when De Gages chose 4:00 in the afternoon to launch the attack, which left very few hours of daylight for a battle. The Spanish were initially successful on both wings, where their cavalry drove off the Austro-Piedmontese cavalry, wounding Count Aspremont in the process and leaving the Austrian infantry vulnerable. However instead of reforming to attack the infantry, the Spanish chased them off the field. Traun stabilised his left flank, and led his infantry into the attack against the Spanish. Meanwhile, Count Schulenberg regrouped the Austrian cavalry on the Austrian right, and launched a counterattack against the Spanish cavalry. On the other flank, General Leutrum (Aspremont's replacement) led his wing forward as well, smashing the Spanish right wing. At this time due to the darkness for both the army it was necessary to withdraw the field; the Spanish back across the Panaro towards Bologna. Due to the smoke and the darkness, many units lost their way. The 1st Guadalaxara marched in the direction of the advancing austro-sardian infantry columns, and it had to surrender after a short defence inside the walls of a farm. Casualties in the battle were 1,755 dead, 1,307 wounded and 824 prisoners for the Spanish, while the Austro- Piedmontese lost 397 dead and 1,153 wounded or prisoners. Traun himself had two horses shot from under him during the battle. Aftermath De Gages retreated to Bologna but on 26 March he was also forced to retreat to Rimini. Despite this, the battle was widely considered a victory in Madrid, and de Gages was awarded a victory title: Count of Campo Santo. Following the battle, France promised support and co-operation with the Spanish, but for the moment Traun had saved North Italy for Maria Theresa.

The Pr√©vost reaction  Reaction mechanism  The reaction between silver benzoate (1) and iodine is very fast and produces a very reactive iodinium benzoate intermediate (2). The reaction of the iodinium salt (2) with an alkene gives another short-lived iodinium salt (3). Nucleophilic substitution (SN2) by the benzoate salt gives the ester (4). Another silver ion causes the neighboring group substitution of the benzoate ester to give the oxonium salt (5). A second SN2 substitution by the benzoate anion gives the desired diester (6). The mechanism of the Pr√©vost reaction In the final step hydrolysis of the ester groups gives the anti-diol. This outcome is the opposite of that of the related Woodward cis-hydroxylation which gives syn addition.

The text commands: \\"Dutch ships are allowed to travel to Japan, and they can disembark on any coast, without any reserve. From now on this regulation must be observed, and the Dutch left free to sail where they want throughout Japan. No offenses to them will be allowed, such as on previous occasions\\" - dated August 24, 1609 (Keich≈ç 14, 25th day of the 6th month); n.b., the goshuin (Âæ°Êú±Âç∞) identifies this as an official document bearing the shogun's scarlet seal. VOC Opperhoofden in Japan were the chief traders of the Dutch East India Company (Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie or VOC in old-spelling Dutch, literally \\"United East Indian Company\\") in Japan during the period of the Tokugawa shogunate, also known as the Edo period. Opperhoofd is a Dutch word (plural opperhoofden) which literally means 'supreme head[man]'. In its historical usage, the word is a gubernatorial title, comparable to the English chief factor, for the chief executive officer of a Dutch factory in the sense of trading post, as led by a factor, i.e. agent. The Japanese called the Dutch chief factors kapitan (from Portuguese capit√£o). The Dutch East India Company was established in 1602 by the States-General of the Netherlands to carry out colonial activities in Asia. The VOC enjoyed unique success in Japan, in part because of the ways in which the character and other qualities of its Opperhoofden were perceived to differ from other competitors.

To the right on the shore-line, the Dutch East India Company trading post is marked with the red-white-blue flag of the Netherlands. To the far left, somewhat back from the shore-line, notice the white flag with the red cross, the St George's Cross of England at the East India Company trading post -- drawing, 1621. =Hirado, 1609‚Äì1639= View of VOC compound at Hirado island - west coast of Ky≈´sh≈´ -- engraving, circa 1669. The first VOC trading outpost in Japan was on the island of Hirado off the coast of Ky≈´sh≈´. Permission for establishing this permanent facility was granted in 1609 by the first Tokugawa-sh≈çgun Ieyasu; but the right to make use of this convenient location was revoked in 1639. =Dejima, 1639‚Äì1860= An imagined bird's-eye view of Dejima's layout and structures. Note the island's fan-shape. Japanese wood-block print made by Toshimaya Bunjiemon in 1780. In 1638, the harsh Sakoku (\\"closed door\\" policy) was ordered by the Tokugawa shogunate; and by 1641, the VOC had to transfer all of its mercantile operations to the small man-made island of Dejima in Nagasaki harbor. The island had been built for the Portuguese, but they had been forced to abandon it and all contacts with Japan. Only the Dutch were permitted to remain after all other Westerners had been excluded. The Dutch presence in Japan was closely monitored and controlled. For example, each year the VOC had to transfer the opperhoofd. Each opperhoofd was expected to travel to Edo to offer tribute to the shogun (Dutch missions to Edo). The VOC traders had to be careful not to import anything religious; and they were not allowed to bring any females, nor to bury their dead ashore. They were largely free to do as they pleased on the island; but they were explicitly ordered to work on Sunday. For nearly 200 years a series of VOC traders lived, worked and seemed to thrive in this confined location. In 1799 the VOC went bankrupt. The trade with Japan was continued by the Dutch Indian government at Batavia, with an interruption during the English occupation of Java, during which the English (Stamford Raffles) unsuccessfully tried to capture Dejima. After the creation of the Kingdom of The Netherlands (1815) the trade with Japan came under the administration of the Minister of the Colonies by way of the Governor General in Batavia. The directors of the trade (Opperhoofd) became colonial civil servants. From 1855 the director of the trade with Japan, J.H. Donker Curtius, became 'Dutch Commissioner in Japan' with orders to conclude a treaty with Japan. He succeeded in 1855 to conclude a convention, changed into a treaty in January 1856. In 1857 he concluded a commercial paragraph in addition to the treaty of 1856, thus concluding the first western treaty of friendship and commerce with Japan. His successor, J.K. de Wit was Dutch Consul General in Japan, though still a colonial civil servant. In 1862 the Dutch representation in Japan was transferred to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. This change was effected in Japan in 1863, Dirk de Graeff van Polsbroek becoming Consul General and Political Agent in Japan.

Early life  Robert Forde was born in rural parish of Moviddy near Bandon 16 miles from Cork City, Ireland . His father's name was George and his mother's was Charity (n√©e Payne). George and Charity Forde married in 1859 in Bandon, Co. Cork. His mother was born in 1836. Forde was the youngest of three children. Sarah Forde was born in 1867 and his brother John Forde was born in 1874. In 1901 Charity, now a widow, and her children lived in Teadies, Co. Cork. By 1911 she had relocated with Sarah her eldest child to Brinny, Co. Cork. Forde was a Protestant and he lived near Kilmurry. He was related to the legendary car maker' Henry Forde', who lived near his family. At the age of sixteen, he had joined the Royal Navy which was 1891, rising to the rank of Petty Officer 1st Class. This was from his hard work. On 16 April 1910 at 35 years old and as Petty Officer he volunteered to take part in Robert Falcon Scott's second expedition, The British Antarctic [Terra Nova] Expedition 1910‚Äì1913. Forde was one of a number of Irishmen who took part, including Tom Crean and another Corkman, Patrick Keohane. Forde was part of a group which headed out from Cape Evans in January 1911 to explore the polar capes.  Career  Forde took part in two depot laying journeys. During the Western Party journey, he was sledge master which was led by Griffith Taylor in 1911. The Terra Nova expedition undertook an extensive survey of the Antarctic from 1911‚Äì1913. Forde and his companions had the responsibility of examining the area around Ross Island and the Polar Plateau. This is the reason behind the glacier being called Mount Forde in the Victoria Land. Temperatures dropped as low as -62C leaving Forde to return home due his hand being severely frostbitten. By March 1912 Forde was suffering so badly that he was ordered to the Terra Nova by Captain Scott. His hands were saved and he was brought back to New Zealand in April 1912. As a result, he did not participate on the final and fatal attempt on the South Pole. He was missed deeply by his team. Scott's logs of the expedition stated that he missed Forde when he was gone - \\"no one who could replace him,\\". When he returned home he was able to serve in the Royal Navy at the height of the First World War. He served on number of ships. He received a promotion to chief petty officer. He was assigned to his former ship 'HMS' vivid in October 1913. His job in World War one was to serve on several vessels He survived the war and remained in the Royal Navy 17 February 1920 when he returned to Cobh, Co. Cork. Cobh, Co. Cork was where he spent the rest of his life. Until his death he wore a glove to protect his hand from the effects of the severe frostbite he had suffered half a century before hand. = Terra Nova Expedition = Robert Forde Cooking Seal Fry on the Terra Nova Expedition on the Blubber Stove at Cape Roberts On 15 June 1910, The Terra Nova left Cardiff. Some 8000 people volunteered to take part in this expedition. It was traveling via the uninhabited Ilha de Trinidade and Cape Town to New Zealand. On 19 November 1910, they collected supplies and members of the expedition and left Port Chalmers. It reached Ross Island on 4 January 1911 after coming in contact with severe storms and heavy pack ice. A shore party of 34 spent two seasons exploring on and around the Ross Island Shelf. They were unable to reach the old Discovery hut at Hut Point. Scott had to settle for base on Cape Evans and started to unload the same day. One of the expedition's three experimental motor sledges was lost in the process, plunging through the sea ice. The Terra Nova left on 26 January carrying a four-man team headed for the Victoria Land mountains opposite Ross island, and six-man Eastern Party under Lt Victor Campbell. The Victoria Land Party included the geologists Thomas Griffith Taylor ad Frank Debenhams, the physicist Charles Wright, and PO Edgar Evans. It investigated the geology and glaciology of the McMurdo dry valleys and the Taylor and Koettlitz Glaciers, returning to Hut Point on 14 March . A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes and history that have shaped it. The Terra Nova left Cape Evans with the remains of the expedition on 19 January 1903; pausing to pick up Taylor's and Debenhams's and the Eastern Party's specimens from Victoria Land, they sailed for New Zealand. They arrived to telegraph the news of Scott's death on 10 February 1913. =Robert Forde's relationship with Captain Scott= Captain Scott, whose full name was Robert Falcon Scott was the Captain of the Terra Nova. On this expedition Captain Scott was nicknamed ' The Skipper'. While on this expedition with Forde, Robert Scott wrote numerous diaries on the South Pole. This was then published in 1913 as Scotts Expedition. In January 1912 Captain Scott and the remaining men on his team reached the South Pole. They had been gone for 93 days and covered 960 statute miles. Scott died on his way back from the expedition from starvation and exposure. He and the rest of the team had been dead eight months before they were found.  Death  Forde's role in the expedition led to his promotion to Chief Petty Officer on board HMS Vivid, and he served on her and several other British ships during World War 1. After demobilisation he retired to Cobh, which was still then known as Queenstown and was a major naval port for the British in Ireland. He died there in March 1959. He is remembered by the naming of Mount Forde, a monumental peak of over 1,200 metres at the head of Hunt Glacier in Victoria Land Antarctica (76¬∞53'S, 162¬∞05'E). Robert Forde is buried at the Clonmel Old Church Cemetery, Cobh in his native County Cork. In March 2009, on the 50th Anniversary of his death, a Memorial was unveiled to Forde by The Robert Forde Memorial Committee in The Promenade, Cobh. The rough hewn granite stone faces out to Cork Harbour and has a bronze plaque showing Forde with his sled. A Plaque was also unveiled at 52 Harbour Row, Cobh where he lived.

He fought in nearly all of the major battles of the Eastern Theater of that war. Grimes was the last man in the Army of Northern Virginia to be appointed as a major general.see footnote Eicher, p. 810. He also led the last attack of that army not long before its surrender to Union forces at Appomattox Court House on the morning of April 9, 1865. Early life and career Bryan Grimes, Jr. was born on the ancestral family plantation, called \\"Grimesland Plantation,\\" in Pitt County, North Carolina. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1971. His father, Bryan Grimes, Sr., was a prosperous planter. His mother, Nancy Grist, was the daughter of a prominent general from Georgia; she died when Grimes was only four months old, and his older sister for a time raised him. He attended school in Nash County and an academy in Washington, North Carolina, before attending a noted private school in Hillsborough. Grimes, at the age of fifteen, enrolled in the University of North Carolina, where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society. He graduated four years later in 1848. In 1849, his father gave him the Grimesland estate, along with control over its 100 slaves. On April 9, 1851, he married Elizabeth Hilliard Davis, but she would die only six years later. The couple had four children, one of whom, Bryan Grimes III, died in childhood. A grief-stricken Grimes later traveled to Europe. Civil War service Upon his return to the United States, he was elected as a delegate to North Carolina's secession convention. He resigned from the commission after the passage of the Ordinance of Secession and joined the Confederate Army as the major of the newly formed 4th North Carolina Infantry on May 16, 1861. He saw his first combat action at the First Battle of Manassas in Virginia on July 21. Grimes was promoted to lieutenant colonel on May 1, 1862, and fought at the Battle of Seven Pines, during which he was wounded when his injured horse fell on top of him on May 31.Eicher, p. 269. On June 19, 1862, Grimes was promoted to the rank of colonel and given command of the 4th North Carolina Infantry, now part of the Army of Northern Virginia. Grimes led the regiment during the Peninsula Campaign, but missed the Maryland Campaign and the Battle of Sharpsburg due to a severe leg injury incurred when his horse kicked him on September 5 near Edward's Ferry in Maryland. Upon recovery Grimes returned to field duty in temporary command of an infantry brigade within the division of Maj. Gen. Daniel Harvey Hill. He fought with the rest of Stonewall Jackson's Second Corps at the Battle of Fredericksburg that December, where his men repelled a Union attack. Grimes returned to his regimental command before the 1863 Chancellorsville Campaign, where he was wounded again, this time in a foot, on May 3. During the first day's fighting at Gettysburg, Grimes' regiment was the first organized Confederate unit to enter the streets of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He was in charge of the rear guard during a part of the army's retreat into Virginia following the three- day battle. On September 15, 1863, he married Charlotte Emily Bryan, and they eventually had ten children together, including John Bryan Grimes, who would become North Carolina's secretary of state. Again, another son named Bryan Grimes died in childhood. During the 1864 Overland Campaign, Grimes was promoted to the rank of brigadier general on May 19, and given permanent command of his brigade of North Carolinians. That autumn, he fought in the Shenandoah Valley Campaign as part of the army of Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early. When Maj. Gen. Stephen D. Ramseur was killed at Cedar Creek, Grimes assumed command of his division on December 9 and led it for the rest of the war. On October 19 while at Cedar Creek he was wounded in a leg. On February 15, 1865, Grimes was promoted to major general, the last man appointed to that rank in the Army of Northern Virginia.Eicher, p. 810. Grimes' rank of major general dates from February 15, 1865; the last two CSA major generals (Thomas J. Churchill and John S. Marmaduke) both rank from March 17, but neither were part of AoNV. He served in the trenches surrounding Petersburg and joined Robert E. Lee's retreat to the west that ended when the way was blocked by Federal columns near Appomattox Court House. Grimes led an attack that temporarily cleared Federals from the Lynchburg Road, briefly opening up a possible route of escape for a portion of Lee's army. However, Lee chose to surrender instead of risking useless further bloodshed. Following the Appomattox Campaign, Grimes surrendered along with the rest of the Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, and was paroled at Appomattox Court House. He was pardoned by the U.S. government on June 26, 1866. Postbellum career and death After the war, Grimes returned to North Carolina and settled briefly in Raleigh. He subsequently moved back to Grimesland in January 1867 and resumed farming. Ten years later, he was named as a trustee of the University of North Carolina. In 1880, Grimes was ambushed and killed in Pitt County, North Carolina, by a hired assassin named William Parker, presumably to prevent him from testifying at a criminal trial. Grimes had taken part in an attempt to deport immigrants, and was killed by their hitman.Wakelyn, p. 213. Parker was later acquitted at his trial. However, a number of years later Parker returned to the area drunk and boasted of his killing Grimes but winning acquittal. He was arrested for drunk and disorderly. That night a mob entered the deserted jail house, grabbed Parker and lynched him. Nobody was ever tried for the act. Grimes was buried in the family cemetery on his plantation, Grimesland, about five miles northwest of Chocowinity, North Carolina. A monument (a cenotaph) to the fallen former Confederate stands in Trinity Churchyard Cemetery located in the village of Chocowinity. Portions of the letters written home by Grimes throughout the Civil War were published after his death in 1883, entitled Extracts of Letters of Major Gen'l Bryan Grimes, to His Wife. In memory In April 1898, the U.S. Army established \\"Camp Bryan Grimes\\" in Raleigh and named it for the former Confederate general. It served as a mustering point for North Carolina troops in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The Sons of Confederate Veterans local camp in Greenville, North Carolina, was designated as the Major General Bryan Grimes Camp 1988.

This protein is a member of the TIMP family. The glycoprotein is a natural inhibitor of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a group of peptidases involved in degradation of the extracellular matrix. In addition to its inhibitory role against most of the known MMPs, the encoded protein is able to promote cell proliferation in a wide range of cell types, and may also have an anti-apoptotic function.  Function  TIMP1 is an inhibitory molecule that regulates matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), and disintegrin-metalloproteinases (ADAMs and ADAMTSs). In regulating MMPs, TIMP1 plays a crucial role in extracellular matrix (ECM) composition, wound healing, and pregnancy. The dysregulated activity of TIMP1 has been implicated in cancer. In pregnancy, TIMP1 plays a regulatory role in the process of implantation, particularly the cytotrophoblast invasion of the uterine endometrium. Additionally, it plays a role in regulating the transcriptional profile of fetal and placental tissues associated with the early stages of pregnancy. Studies attribute this role to a mechanism involving the chromatin structure at the TIMP1 promoter region, implicating new pharmaceutical possibilities for the therapeutic regulation of TIMP1. Accordingly, TIMP1 can be manipulated in vitro using techniques, like the TIMP1 knock-out.  Other names  * Erythroid potentiating activity (EPA) * Human collagenase inhibitor (HCI) Regulation of TIMP expression Transcription of this gene is highly inducible in response to many cytokines and hormones. In addition, the expression from some but not all inactive X chromosomes suggests that this gene inactivation is polymorphic in human females. This gene is located within intron 6 of the synapsin I gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction. In adrenocortical cells the trophic hormone ACTH induces expression of TIMP-1 and the increase in TIMP expression is also associated with decreased collagenase activity. Increased expression of TIMP1 has been found to be associated with worse prognosis of various tumors, such as laryngeal carcinoma or melanoma.

Career  Born to a family of rich merchants, Forfait studied at a Jesuit college in Rouen, where he was awarded prizes in Mathematics and Hydrography upon graduation.Lebreton, p.146 In 1773, and in spite being a Commoner, he was admitted as an assistant member of Rouen Academy and assistant naval engineer, before serving at Brest harbour.Levot, p.190 In 1777, Forfait rose to sub-engineer under Antoine Groignard. In 1781, he was made an adjunct member of the Naval Academy. In 1783, he embarked on the 110-gun Terrible, part of a Franco-Spanish fleet assembled before C√°diz under Admiral d'Estaing, but the end of the American War of Independence occurred before it saw action. Forfait nevertheless helped repair eleven of the ships of the fleet.Levot, p.191 After the Treaty of Paris, he returned to work at the Naval Academy and notably authored a Trait√© de la m√¢ture\\"Treaty of Rigging\\"Forfait, Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de la m√¢ture des vaisseaux √† l‚Äôusage des √©l√®ves de la marine upon request by Castries, then Secretary of State of the Navy. In recognition, he was admitted as a corresponding member in the Academy of Sciences. He simultaneously developed new techniques to improve the disposition of cargo in ships' holds. In 1789, he was appointed director of service of Le Havre harbour, where he improved the design of fluyts. He was then sent to England to study the British shipbuilding techniques, and authored the Observations sur la marine de d'Angleterre\\"Observations on the Navy of England\\" upon his return. After the outbreak of the French Revolution, Forfait was elected at the Legislative Assembly in 1791 as deputy for the Seine-Inf√©rieure. His moderate positions earned him the mocking nickname of \\"Juste Milieu\\",\\"Right Middle\\" which he wore with pride. At the end of his mandate in September 1792, he returned to shipbuilding at Le Havre. Around this time, Forfait designed the 38-gun frigate Seine, which included structural innovations\\"L'acculement du ma√Ætre-couple, et le transport vers les extr√©mit√©s des capacit√©s perdues au milieu par cet acculement\\"; Levot, p.192 and were designed to carry 24-pounder long guns ‚Äî more powerful than the usual 18-pounder long guns usually born by ships of this size, although the Seine was eventually armed with 18-pounders. The Seine class, built on these plans, came to comprise 7 ships. Forfait furthered his efforts with the Romaine class in 1794, and was also involved in the design of the Etna-class corvettes. During the Reign of Terror, he was accused at a political club of Le Havre. He was eventually freed by the Committee of Public Safety and made general inspector for forests. In 1794, he was tasked to design specialised ships to navigate the Seine river; he consequently design a lugger, the Saumon, and authored a M√©moire sur la navigation de la Seine.Levot, p.192 In 1797, the Directory tasked him, along with Rosily-Mesros and David, to study the possibility to establish a military harbour in Antwerp; these studies were followed by the construction of an arsenal. He was then sent to the recently captured Venice, where he oversaw the launch of ships under construction in her harbour and appropriated by the French in the Campaign of Italy; in August 1797, these frigates were launched as Muiron and Carr√®re. Tasked with the naval preparations of the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, Forfait prepared 15 ships of the line, 14 frigates, 72 lesser warships and 400 transports in Toulon, Genoa, Ajaccio and Civitavecchia. He then returned to Le Havre, where he designed 3 heavily armed gunboats to repel British bomb vessels. After the 18 Brumaire, Forfait became Napoleon Bonaparte's first Minister of the Navy, office which he held from November 1799 until his resignationLebreton, p.147 on 1 October 1801, while simultaneously designing ships of the Navy and plans for Boulogne harbour. At the collapse of the Peace of Amiens and the outbreak of the War of the Third Coalition in May 1803, Forfait was tasked with improving the Flottille de Boulogne. In 1805, Forfait was sent to Genoa as Maritime Prefect, tasked to establish a naval presence there. He managed to successfully launch the 74-gun , whose originally intended launch had been botched by her constructors, leaving the ship damaged and stuck on her railing.Roche, p.223 He nevertheless fell in disfavour after the affair. Forfait retired in Rouen, where he died on 8 November 1807.

The film was directed by Nick Grinde (under the working title The Wizard of Death), and was one of several films Karloff starred in contract with Columbia.Pitts, 2010, p. 9Stephen Jacobs, Boris Karloff: More Than a Monster, Tomahawk Press 2011 p 260‚Äì261 Plot Dr. John Garth (Boris Karloff) is on trial for murder after performing a mercy killing on an elderly friend. In the trial, he reveals that he had been researching a cure for aging, but had not had time to perfect it before his friend's pain became unbearable. Despite his pleas for mercy, the judge sentences him to be hanged in three weeks' time. As he awaits his execution, Dr. Garth is allowed to continue his experiments, thanks to support from the prison warden (Ben Taggart) and another scientist who is interested in his research, Dr. Ralph Howard (Edward Van Sloan). Using the blood of a recently executed prisoner, they succeed in developing a serum that will reverse the effects of aging and they decide to test it on Dr. Garth immediately prior to his execution. As he is being taken away to the gallows, however, the prison receives a call informing them that Dr. Garth's sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment. At the same moment, the serum's effect on his body causes Dr. Garth to collapse. When Dr. Garth awakes in the prison medical ward, he discovers that the serum has reversed some of the effects of aging on his body, including the graying of his hair, the appearance of his face, and his physical fitness. Encouraged, he decides to perform another test of the serum, this time on Dr. Howard. As he is preparing Dr. Howard for injection, however, Dr. Garth is overcome by a sudden urge to kill, induced by the presence of an executed murderer's blood in his system. After he strangles Dr. Howard, a wandering prisoner enters the room who, after a struggle, is also killed by Dr. Garth. When the prison authorities discover Dr. Garth, who doesn't remember committing the murders, and the two bodies, they believe that the wandering prisoner killed Dr. Howard and attempted to kill Dr. Garth. As a result, Garth is labelled a hero and granted a full pardon. He returns home to live with his daughter, Martha (Evelyn Keyes), and continues his research on the anti-aging serum. Wishing to test it further, he confronts three of his aging friends and requests that they be his test subjects. Initially, they refuse, but one of them, Victor Sondini (Pedro de C√≥rdoba), later changes his mind after Dr. Garth pays him a personal visit. Just as he is about to administer the serum, Garth is again overcome by the impulses of the executed prisoner and strangles his friend. Finally beginning to realize what he has been doing, Garth visits one of his other friends, George Wharton (Wright Kramer), to confess his crimes and request that he be his final test subject before he turns himself in. Wharton attempts to call for help, but Garth kills him before he can do so. As the bodies begin to pile up and Dr. Garth's behavior becomes more erratic, Martha begins to suspect that something is up and confronts her father. Garth begs her to leave as he continues to fight the impulses of the murderous blood, but she refuses and he comes at her. She faints and Dr. Garth flees. In the final scene, Dr. Garth, now being pursued by the police, approaches the prison where he had been incarcerated. The warden admits him, but Garth immediately makes aggressive movements toward the armed guard at the gate. The guard shoots him and, as he is dying, the doctor admits that he committed suicide in order to prevent himself from killing anyone else.

He was venerated at what was called Pedona (present- day Borgo San Dalmazzo). His biography was composed in the 7th or 8th centuries, its author perhaps a Lombard monk of the monastery of Pedona who was drawing from oral tradition.

In some jurisdictions, a cart operator must meet stringent health regulations designed to protect the public. Hot dog carts are quick and easy food services, supplying millions of people with food every day. In 2015 the U.S. Hot Dog Council estimated that 15% of the approximately 10 billion hot dogs consumed by Americans in 2014 were purchased from a mobile hot dog vendor cart.National Hot Dog and Sausage Council Hot dog carts are very common in New York City, and most of the hot dogs purveyed by hot dog carts in New York City are sourced from Sabrett. Overview Hot dog cart hot dogs in heated water A hot dog cart is generally a compact cart, fully self-contained and designed to serve a limited menu. The hot dogs are often kept hot within a pan of hot water, and some refer to them as \\"dirty water dogs\\" per this method. An on- board cooler is used to keep the hot dogs safely chilled until ready for reheating. It also provides cold storage for beverages, such as sodas, and multiple sinks for washing and cleaning utensils. Most hot dog carts use propane to heat the foods, making them independent of electrical power. Some carts may also be fitted with a propane grill, griddle, deep fryer, or other such cooking appliance.Indiana State Dept of Health - Retail Food Establishment Sanitation Requirements - page 61 - Equipment Design and Materials A colorful umbrella is often installed to protect the food preparation area from contamination, provide some shade, and advertise the cart's location.Willydogs Operations Manual Construction Hot dog carts are generally built from materials that resist corrosion, are hygiene friendly, and are easy to clean. They are often made of stainless steel, but some carts also have components made from plastic, wood, or fiberglass. The food preparation body of the cart is often mounted on a chassis that can be easily towed, to a vendor's location by a vehicle or pushed to a location by hand. Types of carts may vary from a lightweight push cart of only about 200 lbs (90 kg), to fully enclosed walk-in carts weighing 1/2 a ton or more. Issues Although hot dog carts can be equipped to cook a variety of other meats and foods from fresh or raw states, local health code regulations in the U.S. and Canada governing food safety and the types of food that can be sold from mobile food stands usually limit hot dog carts to selling reheated pre-cooked wieners and sausages. These health code regulations vary widely from state to state and county to county. In addition, health regulations often limit what side dishes, condiments, and garnishes may be sold from a mobile food cart, which are potentially hazardous foods, foods at high risk for spoilage due to rapid bacterial growth at certain temperatures. For example, and it is rarely done, but some stands may offer eggs and dairy products. Meats that are considered to be hazardous, such as pork and poultry, may also be banned from sale at mobile foods stands. Bacon Wrapped dogs are typically forbidden, however a common workaround is offering pre-cooked bacon bits as a condiment. Hot dogs are only served on buns with certain approved condiments such as, but not limited to: mustards, pickles, pickled relishes, chopped onions, and tomato ketchup.Illinois Department of Public Health - Food Safety fact Sheet for Temporary Food Stands Health regulations Health code regulations are usually dictated by county health departments, and as a result, they vary widely across the United States and Canada. In addition to determining what types of foods are allowed to be served, these local codes often specify mandates of what equipment should be installed on a mobile food cart. Such codes also ensure that the food cart has built-in facilities for achieving appropriate hygiene levels for the cart, the equipment and utensils being used, and the operator handling the food. This may include hot and cold running water, an insulated ice box, and a number of separate sinks for washing hands and utensils. Some areas specify that a cart have as many as four of these sinks. In addition, local health codes may require the cart to be physically inspected by the local health department, and that a cart operator attend a training course in safe food handling and preparation.http://www.mchd.com/pdf/fdphotdogcarts.pdf Marion Indiana County Health Department - Hot Dog Cart Regulations Guide This is why, when planning to start operating a hot dog cart, the first thing one should do is to contact the local health department and ask for the person in charge of the restaurant inspections.

It is one of the oldest schools in Johannesburg.Oldest School in Jhb Oldest Schools in Johannesburg Series Parktown Boys' sister school is Parktown High School for Girls.  History  North Western Suburbs High School was founded in January 1920, in disused wood and iron buildings which had previously been Police Barracks at the top of Canary Street in Auckland Park. There were eighty-seven pupils in five Form II classes, four for boys and one for girls, with acting Headmaster, C. Hare. The site is now occupied by the South African Broadcasting Corporation. The Acting Director of Education, W.E.C. Clarke, the Inspector of High Schools, officially opened the new school with an address to the scholars and staff. He apologised for the lack of decent furniture and playing fields and promised that a new modern high school for boys would be built on the Parktown Ridge overlooking Milner Park and a new high school for girls near Zoo Lake. The first Headmaster, P.M. Druce, arrived at the beginning of 1921 and, in February, the name of the school was changed to North Western High School. In April the first hatbands and ties arrived. The colours were purple and white. On 1 September 1921 the school was divided into five houses: Romans, Spartans, Thebans, Trojans and Tuscans. On 19 September the name was changed again, this time to Parktown Boys' High School with the motto Arise, and the school badge a rampant lion. When the Rand Revolt took place in 1922 the school, which was in no- man's-land, had to be evacuated for a short while. At the beginning of 1923 the masters and boys moved to the new buildings in Wellington Road on Parktown Ridge. They took little with them except the school name, motto and badge, the names of the five houses and the traditions they had built up. When the school reopened in the new premises, there were 435 boys on the roll and the school colours were changed to red and black. The girls remained at Auckland Park. The Old Parktonian Association, which was formed in 1925, bought the grounds in Bedfordview but later moved to Craighall Park. Strong links with the school are maintained. When Mr Druce retired in 1938 he was succeeded in turn by B.A. Logie, C.A. Yates, F.J. Marais, J.A. Cameron, N.A.M. Scheepers and T.P. Clarke, Parktown's previous Headmaster for a record 23 years, as well as Mr C. Niemand, and Mr D. Bradley. In 1985 Druce Hall was opened to accommodate boarders and following the school's tradition in the classics, in 1987, the name Vulcan was given to the sixth school house to which all boarders belong. Parktown Boys' High School was the first government school to allow boys who were discriminated against because of their colour into a mainstream 'white' school in 1991. Parktown Boys' High School was the first school in South Africa to install an international standard water-based Astroturf playing surface. This surface has hosted many national and international games. More recently, Parktown has built Surgite House overlooking the McCorkell Oval (named after Neil McCorkell the school's former cricket coach and former Hampshire county cricketer who became a centurion in March 2012) to incorporate the administration and entertainment needs of Old Parktonians, as well as the Sydney Klevansky Sports and Cultural Centre.

Archibald Smith of Jordanhill (10 August 1813, in Greenhead, North Lanarkshire - 26 December 1872, in London) was a Scots-born barrister and amateur mathematician. Early life and education He was the only son of James Smith FRSE (1782-1867), a wealthy merchant and antiquary and owner of the Jordanhill estate in Glasgow,George Stewart, 'Archibald Smith', in Curiosities of Glasgow Citizenship, 1881, p. 238 and his wife Mary Wilson, granddaughter of Alexander Wilson, professor of astronomy in Glasgow University (and brother of Patrick Wilson). He was educated at the Redland School near Bristol from 1826 to 1828. Archibald studied Law at Glasgow University from 1828, and then at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was Senior Wrangler, said to be the first Scot to achieve this position, and first Smith's prizeman in 1836, elected a fellow of Trinity College. He was one of the founders of the Cambridge Mathematical Journal. He graduated BA in 1836 and MA in 1839. Career as lawyer He entered Lincoln's Inn, and was called to the bar as a barrister in 1841. He then practised as an equity draughtsman and property lawyer in London. Career as scientist His scientific work was mainly in the field of applications of magnetism and the Earth's magnetic field. He obtained practical formulae for the correction of magnetic compass observations made on board ship, which General Sir Edward Sabine published in the Transactions of the Royal Society: Smith later made convenient tables. In 1859 he edited William Scoresby's Journal of a Voyage to Australia for Magnetical Research and gave an exact formula for the effect of the iron of a ship on the compass. In 1862, in conjunction with the hydrographer Sir Frederick John Owen Evans FRS (1815-1885), then superintendent of the compass department of the navy, he published an Admiralty Manual for ascertaining and applying the Deviations of the Compass caused by the Iron in a Ship.J.

Proteins with this domain are known informally as Gla proteins. The Gla residues are responsible for the high-affinity binding of calcium ions. The GLA domain binds calcium ions by chelating them between two carboxylic acid residues. These residues are part of a region that starts at the N-terminal extremity of the mature form of Gla proteins, and that ends with a conserved aromatic residue. This results in a conserved Gla-x(3)-Gla-x- Cys motif that is found in the middle of the domain, and which seems to be important for substrate recognition by the carboxylase. The 3D structures of several Gla domains have been solved. Calcium ions induce conformational changes in the Gla domain and are necessary for the Gla domain to fold properly. A common structural feature of functional Gla domains is the clustering of N-terminal hydrophobic residues into a hydrophobic patch that mediates interaction with the cell surface membrane. At present, the following human Gla-containing proteins (Gla proteins) have been characterized to the level of primary structure: the blood coagulation factors II (prothrombin), VII, IX, and X, the anticoagulant proteins C and S, and the factor X-targeting protein Z. The bone Gla protein osteocalcin, the calcification-inhibiting matrix Gla protein (MGP), the cell growth regulating \\"growth arrest specific gene 6\\" protein GAS6, periostin (a factor necessary for migration and adhesion of epithelial cells), plus two proline-rich Gla-proteins (PRGPs) and two transmembrane Gla proteins (TMGPs), the functions of which are unknown.

He wrote the screenplay for the film Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, for which he is perhaps best known. Before moving to New York to stage several of his early plays, he studied Theology at the University of California, Davis. He tried to get the script for Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, made seven years before director Sidney Lumet agreed to direct it. In describing his script he has said: :\\"I don't know. It was winter, and I was depressed I guess when I was writing it. I'm fascinated by the folly of human nature. I love characters who we understand and sympathize with, but we just shake our heads at how stupidly they act. This probably comes from my theology background but I love the big themes of good and evil and how we're such a combination of both. We try to chart a path that's on the side of good, but we all have evil impulses in us.\\" Subsequent to his success with Before the Devil Knows You're Dead, he has worked in several media including stage plays, film and television. Masterson's play Edith. about Woodrow and Edith Wilson premiered at the Berkshire Theater Festival in 2012. He also collaborated with Korean director Bong Joon-ho on the critically acclaimed Snowpiercer, an English-language production that received a North American release in 2014.

A person is said to be \\"getting cold feet\\" when, after previously committing to a plan, they ultimately do not carry out the planned course of action. Definitions (psychological) * Apprehension or doubt strong enough to prevent a planned course of action. * A loss or lack of courage or confidence; an onset of uncertainty or fear. * To ‚Äúhave cold feet‚Äù is to be too fearful to undertake or complete an action. * A wave of timidity or fearfulness. * Loss or lack of courage or confidence. * Timidity that prevents the continuation of a course of action. Origin and history The origin of the term itself has been largely attributed to American author Stephen Crane, who added the phrase, in 1896, to the second edition of his short novel, Maggie: A Girl of the Streets. Crane writes, \\"I knew this was the way it would be. They got cold feet.\\" The term is present in \\"Seed Time and Harvest\\" by Fritz Reuter published in 1862. Kenneth McKenzie, a former professor of Italian at Princeton University attributed the first use of the phrase to the play Volpone produced by Ben Jonson in 1605. The true origin and first usage of the phrase remains debated and unconfirmed as exemplified above. Common uses =Marriage= A common use of the phrase is when people fear the commitment of marriage and get \\"cold feet\\" before a wedding ceremony. This pre-marital doubt or fear may manifest for a variety of reasons and sometimes cause the bride or groom to back out of a planned marriage. Original research on the \\"cold feet\\" phenomenon is very limited, but a four- year study conducted by UCLA researchers found feelings of pre-marital doubt or uncertainty about an impending marriage were associated with future marital problems and a viable predictor of divorce.

As of 2015, the town had a total population of 28,040.http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/chih/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e;=08 It is a rural bordertown on the U.S.-Mexico border, with the city of Presidio, Texas, directly opposite, on the U.S. side of the border. Ojinaga is situated where the R√≠o Conchos drains into the R√≠o Grande (known as the Rio Bravo in Mexico), an area called La Junta de los Rios. Presidio and Ojinaga are connected by the Presidio-Ojinaga International Bridge and the Presidio‚ÄìOjinaga International Rail Bridge. History Ojinaga was founded around AD 1200 by the Pueblo Native Americans, who were later assimilated by Uto-Aztecan speakers. Ojinaga was first visited by Spanish explorers (led by √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca) in 1535. (See La Junta Indians) Battle in Ojinaga with General Toribio Ortega's troops opening fire on federals.During the Mexican Revolution, Ojinaga was the scene of the Battle of Ojinaga, between Pancho Villa's revolutionaries and government troops. The U.S. writer Ambrose Bierce may have died there, although that is uncertain. Culture Ojinaga still retains its rural culture and environment, with relatively little pollution and few urban problems. Some of the most famous norte√±o-sax artists are from Ojinaga, such as Polo Ur√≠as, Adolfo Ur√≠as, Los Diamantes de Ojinaga, Los Rieleros del Norte, Conjunto Primavera, Los Jilgueros del Arroyo, and Los Norte√±os de Ojinaga. Location Because of its location on the R√≠o Grande border between Chihuahua and the U.S. state of Texas, Ojinaga is often a station for narcotic smuggling and illegal immigration. The creation of the \\"La Entrada al Pac√≠fico\\" or \\"The Entrance to the Pacific\\", has made Ojinaga and Presidio, Texas, into a proposed inland trade corridor between the two countries. The route extends into Odessa-Midland, Texas. Several changes have also had to be made to the port of entry in Presidio, Texas, to accommodate the growing amount of traffic crossing the border. Truck lanes for heavy vehicles have also been added. Economy Ojinaga serves as a support center and market community for the surrounding area. Though it is on the border Ojinaga has drawn little benefit in the form of maquiladoras. Selkirk has a plant which makes chimney, venting and air distribution products. Solitaire Homes has established a factory for producing prefabricated homes.

He married Anne Garstang on 6 September 1848 at Manchester Cathedral. He joined his father's contracting business, John Brogden and Sons, in 1846. He had intended to join the Bar but was persuaded to support his father instead. Among his first work for the firm was the supervision of contracts for the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway, the Ashton Branch of the Manchester and Birmingham Railway and the East Lancashire Railway. In 1850 Brogdens took a lease of the South Staffordshire Line jointly with John McClean and Alexander managed this for about six years. During the building of the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway, Alexander supervised for the firm while James Brunlees was the Engineer. Alexander Brogden was the first chairman of the Solway Junction Railway, again with James Brunlees as the Engineer., page 9 is a photograph of an invitation to the cutting of the first sod on 28 March 1865, in which the chairman's name is given as \\"Alex.

With the sudden death of his elder brother John in 1855 and the increasing age of his father, it can be assumed that he gradually took control of the business in the late 1850s and assumed full control on his father's death in 1869. During the 1860s he and his wife resided at Holme Island, Grange-over- Sands, This is now in Cumbria but was then in North Lancashire.

He drew up the plans for the disastrous defeats at the Battle of Rivoli, Battle of Hohenlinden and the Battle of Austerlitz, in which the Austrian army was defeated by Napoleon Bonaparte twice and Jean Moreau once. Early career Weyrother was born in Vienna as the son of cavalry Major (Major) Anton von Weyrother, who was Chief Rider of the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. After studying at the Ingenieurakademie in Vienna (Military engineering academy), he joined the army as a Fahnencadet (Academy graduate) in Infanterie-regiment Nr. 22 Franz von Lacy on 1 December 1775 as Lacy was his godfather. On 1 May 1777, he was promoted to F√§hnrich (cadet officer or ensign) and on 16. November 1778 to Unterlieutenant (second lieutenant). In August 1779, he was chosen by Generalmajor Major General Graf Wenzel Colloredo as his adjutant and stayed in post until 1783. On 1 June 1784, he was promoted to Oberlieutenant and after his transfer on 1 August 1787 to Infanterie- regiment Nr. 2 Erzherzog Ferdinand, he served in the 1788‚Äî1790 Turkish War as Adjutant of Feldmarschalleutnant Maximilian Browne and on 1 February 1789, was appointed to Capitain-lieutenant (junior Captain) followed by Hauptmann (full Captain) on 6 July.Jens-Floria Ebert, Die √ñsterreichischen Gener√§le 1792-1815, Franz von Weyrother, Napoleon Online (de) Portal zu Epoche . October 2003. The War of the First Coalition brought about Weyrother's important transfer to the Generalquartiermeisterstab on 16 July 1794 and he joined its former chief, Generalmajor Neu, who was now the Governor of the key fortress of Mainz, where he soon gained the reputation of a cunning and well-educated officer, who was entrusted by Major General Neu with defensive actions against the French besiegers, when Neu was too ill to direct them. he moved over to offensive operations and on 19 November 1794, took the Wissenau Lines, followed by the Zahlbach Lines on 1 December. GM Neu commended him to Feldmarschall Albert Casimir, Duke of Teschen for his untiring efforts and exceptional skills on 1 December 1794. Feldzeugmeister (General) Graf von Wartensleben commended Hauptmann Weyrother to Feldmarschall Clerfayt for his skillful leadership of the advance-guard in the assault on the Hartberg in May 1795, which led to his promotion to Major on 22 May, but on 30 August, in repelling a French assault on the Wissenau Lines, Weyrother was shot in the left shoulder. After his recovery, he was sent to the Army of the Rhine under the Archduke Charles to serve on his staff. On 11 May 1796, was awarded the Military Order of Maria TheresiaDigby Smith, A Biographical Dictionary, at Napoleon Series, Franz von Weyrother, 28 December 2016. and was promoted to Oberstleutnant (Lieutenant- Colonel). Italy and Bavaria In September 1796, Weyrother transferred to Northern Italy, where he fought in the Battle of Bassano under Field Marshal Dagobert von Wurmser, distinguishing himself at the Battle of Bassano on 6 November 1796. He then joined the renewed effort to relieve the Mantua, serving on the staff of Feldzeugmeister J√≥zsef Alvinczi, helping to plan the campaign, which ended in a narrow defeat by Bonaparte at the Battle of Arcole.Boycott-Brown, p 440 His own plan for the Battle of Rivoli provided for three widely separated striking forces and unrealistically called for one flanking column to march across mountainous terrain in January.Boycott-Brown, p 491 His plans were compromised by Napoleon's chief spy, Toli, who obtained a copy of the plan for the advance in January 1797,Gachot, Edouard 'Histoire militaire de Mass√©na.

One of a group of three, known as \\"Thugut's Benjamins\\" (trusted assistants to the Foreign Minister Johann Amadeus Francis de Paula, Baron of Thugut, during the campaign of 1799, Weyrother served as chief of staff to Feldzeugmeister P√°l Kray, where he distinguished himself at Legnago (26 March), Magnano (5 April) and, now serving as liaison officer with the Russian Field Marshal Alexander Suvorov, at Novi on 15 August. He then planned the epic march of the Russian troops under Alexander Suvorov across the Saint Gotthard Pass. Promoted to Oberst (colonel) on 5 February 1800, Weyrother was given command of Infanterie- regiment Nr. 7 Schr√∂der, which was part of the army in Germany under P√°l Kray, but a further wound and the strains of campaigning led to his leaving the army to recuperate. Recalled in the autumn of 1800, Emperor Francis II assigned him to be chief-of-staff to the 18-year-old Archduke John of Austria, the new commander of the army in Bavaria, and his Adlatus (chief adviser) Franz von Lauer. Believing Jean Moreau's French army to be in retreat, Weyrother organised an aggressive pursuit through heavily forested terrain by four non- mutually-supporting columns.Arnold, p 221-222 Instead, Moreau stood his ground, sprang an ambush, and enveloped the Austrian left flank. The resulting Battle of Hohenlinden turned out to be a catastrophe for the Austrians, effectively ending the War of the Second Coalition. Nevertheless, Weyrother was appointed military adviser to the new Foreign Minister, Graf Ludwig Cobenzl in the negotiations following the Armistice of Steyr, which led to the Peace of Luneville in 1801. Napoleonic Wars When the War of the Third Coalition broke out, Weyrother was promoted to Generalmajor (major general). After the death of the Allied army chief of staff, Johann Heinrich von Schmitt at the Battle of D√ºrenstein on 11 November 1805, the Allied commander-in- chief, the Russian General Mikhail Kutusov requested that Weyrother be made chief of staff of the Austro-Russian army. Although the two men soon fell out, as Kutuzov wanted a defensive strategy, Weyrother gained the favour of Tsar Alexander I of Russia with his aggressive strategy. With the Tsar's support, he created the plan for the Battle of Austerlitz Chandler, p 416-417 in which the Allies were crushed by Napoleon on 2 December 1805. The defeat was so bad, the Russians accused Weyrother of being in the pay of the French. Weyrother withdrew from military life and retired to Vienna, where he died aged 51. His inappropriate dispositions for the battle at Austerlitz are satirized by Leo Tolstoy in War and Peace. References * Arnold, James R. Marengo & Hohenlinden.

Using the standard amino acid abbreviations, AFPep has the sequence cyclo-(EKTOVNOGN), where O is hydroxyproline. This peptide has been shown in experimental animal models to be efficacious in the prevention and treatment of ER+ breast cancer.  Biological activity  = Background = Multiple births by a woman are strongly associated with a lower risk of developing breast cancer later in her life. One of the contributing factors for this association appears to be Œ±-fetoprotein (AFP) produced by the fetal liver which crosses the placenta and enters into the maternal circulation. Pregnancy-associated protection from breast cancer is directly proportional to exposure level to AFP. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that tumor growth can be inhibited by AFP in animal models of breast cancer. It is speculated that AFP may induce apoptosis in pre-malignant breast tissue cells which would have later developed into malignancies. = Anti cancer effects = Through mimicking the effects of AFP, AFPep inhibits the proliferation of estrogen receptor-positive human breast cancer cells growing in culture. It is also able to inhibit the estrogen stimulated growth of human breast cancer cells growing as xenografts in immune deficient mice. According to a recent study, AFPep prevents the development of carcinogen-induced breast cancer in an animal model. Hence AFPep may have utility for preventing or treating estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. = Mechanism of action = AFPep inhibits estrogen-stimulated growth of immature mouse uterus and thus is antiestrogenic. In culture, AFPep inhibits the estrogen induced proliferation of T47D cells but has no effect on the basal growth. AFPep also inhibits phosphorylation of the estrogen receptor and activates the phosphorylation of p53. AFPep has been shown to bind the heat shock protein Hsp72. Hsp72 together with Hsp90 form a heterocomplex with the estrogen receptor. Hence AFPep through interaction with Hsp72 controls the ligand binding and transcriptional activation of the estrogen receptor.  Combination therapy with tamoxifen  AFPep increases the efficacy and decreases the toxicities of Tamoxifen Tamoxifen has been a very effective drug for the treatment of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. But tamoxifen has certain toxicities and side effects such as uterine hyperplasia which can lead to endometrial cancer. Moreover, some breast cancers acquire resistance to tamoxifen during the course of treatment and few are totally resistant to it. It has been established that AFPep when used in combination with tamoxifen, reduces the uterine hyperplasia and increases the antitumour effects of tamoxifen. A rational combination of AFPep and tamoxifen may prove to be a better chemopreventive or chemotherapeutic approach against estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.  Route of administration  AFPep active whether administered intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or orally.

The station, which began broadcasting in 1996, was previously owned by Adelante Media Group and the broadcast license was formerly held by Bustos Media of California License, LLC. On October 21, 2014, Adelante announced that it was selling KLMG, its sister stations and its LPTV outlet in Sacramento to Lazer Broadcasting, pending FCC approval\\"Lazer Expands Into Sacramento and Modesto\\" from Radio Insight (October 21, 2014) The transaction was consummated effective December 31, 2014, at a price of $2.9 million. Programming KLMG broadcasts a Spanish AC music format to the Sacramento metropolitan area. This format is designed for the 18- to 34-year- old advertising demo and features popular Hispanic recording artists, plus \\"reggaet√≥n and bachata hits\\". Unlike \\"Mega\\"-themed Spanish Top 40 stations in Miami, Texas and Puerto Rico, KLMG refrains from airing many English-language crossover records and instead taps into the Mexican contemporary music charts. The station targets first-generation and second-generation Hispanic adults with an upbeat presentation, even with ballads and a balance in the on-air tempo of the station. History =The beginning= This station received its original construction permit from the Federal Communications Commission on February 6, 1995. The new station was assigned the call sign KZAC by the FCC on March 17, 1995. KZAC received its license to cover from the FCC on April 23, 1996. The station's original studios were located in the Old Sacramento State Historic Park even though its broadcast tower was located in Esparto, California, its legal city of license. When it signed on, KZAC became the fifth Spanish-language radio station to serve the greater Sacramento area. By April 1998, the station was branded as \\"Radio Fiesta\\" and broadcast a Spanish- language adult contemporary music format aimed at the 25- to 54-year-old advertising demographic. The station's owners applied to the FCC for new call letters and received the KTTA call sign on July 6, 1998. =Ownership changes= In December 2002, original owner Pacific Spanish Network, Inc., reached an agreement to sell KTTA to Aztec Media, Inc., for a reported $7 million. KTTA had been operated by Aztec Media since July 1999 under a local marketing agreement. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 21, 2003, and the transaction was consummated on April 1, 2003. In October 2004, Aztec Media, Inc., announced an agreement to sell this station to Bustos Media through their Bustos Media of California, LLC, subsidiary, for $15 million as part of a two-station deal valued at $21.7 million. The deal was approved by the FCC on December 15, 2004, and the transaction was consummated on January 21, 2005. Just one week later, as part of an internal corporate reorganization, Bustos Media applied to the FCC to transfer the broadcast license from Bustos Media of California, LLC, to Bustos Media of California License, LLC. The transfer was approved by the FCC on January 28, 2005, and the transaction was consummated on February 10, 2005. Founded in 2004, Bustos Media was one of the largest Spanish-language broadcasting corporations in the United States. =97.9 today= The station's former longtime Regional Mexican music format, \\"La Ke Buena\\" branding, and KTTA calls moved to 94.3 FM in February 2009; the station is now the flagship of Adelante Media Group's \\"La Gran D\\" regional Mexican network. This station, which flipped to a Spanish- language CHR format branded as \\"Mega 97.9\\", was assigned the KLMG call sign by the FCC on February 24, 2009. In 2010, the branding shifted to \\"Latino 97.9\\" and continues today under new owner Adelante Media Group.

As a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family, this protein catalyzes the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds, which allows it to regulate many biological processes, including intracellular signaling, transcription, inflammation, and apoptosis. Due to its various functions, PPIA has been implicated in a broad range of inflammatory diseases, including atherosclerosis and arthritis, and viral infections. Structure PPIA is an 18 kDa, 165-amino acid long cytosolic protein. Like other cyclophilins, PPIA forms a Œ≤-barrel structure with a hydrophobic core. This Œ≤-barrel is composed of eight anti-parallel Œ≤-strands and capped by two Œ±-helices at the top and bottom. In addition, the Œ≤-turns and loops in the strands contribute to the flexibility of the barrel. Its active site is a hydrophobic pocket that binds peptides containing proline. Cyclosporine can bind this pocket to inhibit the protein‚Äôs enzymatic activity.  Function  This gene encodes a member of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family. PPIases catalyze the cis-trans isomerization of proline imidic peptide bonds in oligopeptides and accelerate protein folding. Generally, PPIases are found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, as well as in a few archaebacteria, and thus are highly conserved. Of the 18 known human cyclophilins, PPIA is the most abundantly expressed isozyme. In particular, PPIA is predominantly expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of the cell, where it partakes in intracellular signaling, protein transport, and transcription regulation. In hemopoietic cells, subcellular localization of PPIA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm has been observed during c-Jun N-terminal kinase- and serine protease-dependent microtubule disruption. This localization has been correlated with G2/M arrest, indicating that the protein's PPIase function may be regulated by microtubule dynamics during the cell cycle. PPIA has also been associated with the mitochondria. Moreover, the enzyme participates in inflammatory and apoptotic processes in extracellular settings. In the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS), vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), monocytes/macrophages, and endothelial cells (ECs) secrete PPIA to induce an inflammatory response and mitigate tissue injury. PPIA may also activate Akt and NF-Œ∫B signaling, resulting in the upregulation of Bcl-2, an antiapoptotic protein, and thus preventing apoptosis in ECs in response to oxidative stress. PPIA may also regulate ERK1/2, JNK, p38 kinase, Akt, and IŒ∫B signalling pathways through activating the CD147 receptor. PPIA- mediated activation of the ERK, JNK, and p38 kinase pathways also contributes to angiogenesis. Additionally, PPIA induces cell migration and proliferation in smooth muscle. In the case of T cells, PPIA regulates the T-cell-specific tyrosine kinase ITK upon T-cell receptor stimulation.  Clinical significance  The PPIA protein is an important apoptotic constituent. During a normal embryologic processes, or during cell injury (such as ischemia-reperfusion injury during heart attacks and strokes) or during developments and processes in cancer, an apoptotic cell undergoes structural changes including cell shrinkage, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and fragmentation of the DNA and nucleus. This is followed by fragmentation into apoptotic bodies that are quickly removed by phagocytes, thereby preventing an inflammatory response. It is a mode of cell death defined by characteristic morphological, biochemical and molecular changes. It was first described as a \\"shrinkage necrosis\\", and then this term was replaced by apoptosis to emphasize its role opposite mitosis in tissue kinetics. In later stages of apoptosis the entire cell becomes fragmented, forming a number of plasma membrane-bounded apoptotic bodies which contain nuclear and or cytoplasmic elements. The ultrastructural appearance of necrosis is quite different, the main features being mitochondrial swelling, plasma membrane breakdown and cellular disintegration. Apoptosis occurs in many physiological and pathological processes. It plays an important role during embryonal development as programmed cell death and accompanies a variety of normal involutional processes in which it serves as a mechanism to remove \\"unwanted\\" cells. As a proinflammatory cytokine, PPIA is highly involved in acute and chronic inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, atherosclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis. Thus, therapeutic targeting of PPIA with selective inhibitors may prove effective in combatting such inflammatory diseases and symptoms. Correlation between plasma PPIA levels and hyperglycemia symptoms also promotes utilization of PPIA as a biomarker for diabetes and vascular disease. Furthermore, PPIA is involved in cerebral hypoxia-ischemia by contributing to the nuclear transport of AIF, a proapoptotic factor, in neurons. To maintain the integrity of the blood brain barrier and mitigate brain injury, PPIA helps to recruit circulating monocytes and stimulates survival and growth pathways. In cardiac myogenic cells, cyclophilins have been observed to be activated by heat shock and hypoxia-reoxygenation as well as complex with heat shock proteins. Thus, cyclophilins may function in cardioprotection during ischemia-reperfusion injury. Currently, PPIA expression is highly correlated with cancer pathogenesis, but the specific mechanisms remain to be elucidated. PPIA overexpression has been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma, lung cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, endometrial carcinoma, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The protein can also interact with several HIV proteins, including p55 gag, Vpr, and capsid protein, and has been shown to be necessary for the formation of infectious HIV virions. As a result, PPIA contributes to viral diseases such as AIDS, hepatitis C, measles, and influenza A.

After returning, he was asked to inspect and oversee the projects that were taking place at several shipyards across America. One of those shipyards was the Crescent Shipyard of Elizabeth, New Jersey, where the United States Navy's first submarines were built by John P. Holland's Holland Torpedo Boat Company. Later on, this company changed its name when Isaac Rice merged his other holdings (Electric Storage and Electro-Dynamic) with Holland's to create the Electric Boat Company. In 1902 Spear resigned his Navy commission and joined Electric Boat as a naval constructor He was appointed Vice-President when Holland resigned in April 1904. Spear served as President from 1942 to 1947, running the company during World War II, when it was a leading producer of submarines. He served as Chairman of the Board from 1947 until his death on 9 September 1950.

Its studios are in North Sacramento and a transmitter site is near Woodland. Sunny 101.5 debuted on August 30, 1996. On August 10, 2011, KMJE replaced KUBA on a translator at 95.5 FM. On February 11, 2013, KMJE became a simulcast of KCCL sister station along with a change in its city of license. On May 30, 2013, officially switched signals and call letters with KMJE, becoming \\"101.5 K-Hits,\\" but continued to simulcast until a new format on 92.1 FM was unveiled in July 2013. Joey Mitchell Long-time Sacramento radio personality, Joey Mitchell, currently hosts the morning show on KCCL/K-HITS weekdays from 6:00am to 9:00am. Starting in 1969 in Southern California on radio station KVFM located in Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley, Joey gained attention thanks to the 1971 San Fernando 6.6 earthquake. Waking to the 6:00am shaking, Joey ran to the radio station located in the fourteen story Panorama Towers on Van Nuys Blvd. and began broadcasting emergency information to the local community. He was forced to evacuate the tall building by local police when aftershocks deemed the building unsafe. Joey did not leave the studio until he had the police actually order him to, live on the air. That story was heard by KPRO 1440 AM Riverside's general manager Howard Fisher and he immediately offered Joey a job. KPRO was then owned by TV and radio personality Dick Clark and Joey's involvement with the station led to a longtime association with Dick Clark. In 1975, Joey moved his wife and sons to Northern California and Mitchell began 20 years as Sacramento's most-popular morning man with famed country station KRAK. His comedy and antics are legendary. He was named Billboard magazine's \\"Best Country DJ\\" in 1988 and was nominated again in 1992. Local TV station KXTV named him Sacramento's top radio personality two years-in-a-row. He has been featured in Sacramento Magazine,http://www.sacmag.com/Sacramento-Magazine/September-2007/Radio/ the Sacramento Bee, and other local publications. The State of California once declared a \\"Joey Mitchell Day.\\" His on-air presence expanded country music's popularity in the Sacramento market. Despite his success at KRAK, he was not immune to the changes on the radio dial. With music on the AM side becoming a rarity, Joey Mitchell joined KHYL-FM, an oldies channel, where \\"Mitchell and Company\\" was able to raise station ratings. When the new KRAK-FM with a country oldies format went on-the-air, Mitchell was brought aboard as the morning man. But continued movement on the FM dial and an eventual move to 1470AM would prove confusing to listeners. Even Joey Mitchell would find himself doing \\"afternoon drive.\\" To keep up with all the changes, Willie Nelson's \\"On The Road Again\\" would receive substantial airplay. After the final demise of KRAK, he would returning to playing oldies, first at KOOL 101.9, now at KCCL/K-HITS 92.1. Joey Mitchell also owns his own advertising and production company, known as \\"Joey Mitchell Productions.\\" Big Jim Hall Big Jim Hall, a veteran of 45 years on the Sacramento airwaves, hosted the afternoon show on KCCL/K-HITS weekdays from 4:00pm to 6:00pm from 2007 through 2017. Called the \\"World's tallest disc jockey,\\" Big Jim started his radio career at Merced's KYOS-AM before moving to Sacramento's KROY. But it was at the legendary country station, KRAK-AM, where Big Jim Hall found his greatest fame. For two decades he held the 2-6:00PM afternoon \\"drive\\" and like his friend and colleague, Joey Mitchell, was responsible for increasing the interest of country music in the greater Sacramento market. After KRAK flipped its format, Hall moved to smooth jazz-oriented KSSJ then joined the original KCCL \\"KOOL 101.9\\" as the \\"Midday Mayor.\\" After this station flipped to a modern country format in 2007, both Hall and Mitchell joined the new KCCL.

Biography Alfred Radley was born in 1924 in the East End of London, the youngest of seven children. His father died when he was eighteen months old, and he was brought up partly at the Norwood orphanage. During the Second World War he volunteered for the Navy and served in all theatres of war from the Atlantic Convoys to the Pacific. In June 1944, D day +1, he served on a ship landing troops on the beaches in Normandy and was on the first Allied ship to dock in France (Cherbourg). Towards the end of the war, he served on a ship (RMS Monoway) taking returning Russian prisoners to Odessa and bringing back Jewish survivors (among them Otto Frank, the father of Anne Frank) from the death camps to Marseille. He also was on one to the first ships to enter Japan following the dropping of the atom bombs when he visited Hiroshima. After the war, he started his own company selling dresses and by the early 1960s was part of the Swinging London movement, specialising in party dresses. By 1965 Radley was one of the most important fashion houses in London, with its own fabric mills as well as factories producing gloves and handbags for many high street stores including Marks & Spencer. In 1968 Radley acquired Quorum with its famous designers Ossie Clark, Alice Pollock and Celia Birtwell. While Ossie Clark flourished under the Quorum label, Radley promoted the careers of many designers including: Betty Jackson, Sheilagh Brown, Sheridan Barnett, Wendy Dagworthy, Rosemary Bradford and Terence Nolder (who in 1980 won the British Eveningwear Designer Award and The British Designer of the Year Award in 1981) For this, he has been given the epithet \\"the patron saint of British Fashion\\" Sir Philip Green. Radley remained in contact with Ossie Clark throughout the rest of his life. Although Radley retired in the late 1980s, he has retained a passionate interest in fashion and in particular Ossie Clark and has worked tirelessly to keep his work and memory alive. In 2002, he convinced the Victoria & Albert Museum to stage a major exhibition in celebration of Ossie Clark's work which was mounted in July 2003 for ten months. Radley provided many of the garments that were on display from his personal collection and the centrepiece was his daughter Diane's wedding dress.

Work Perdue's Sweet-Scented Manuscript was completed within a year of his \\"retirement,\\" but was not published until 2004 when it was issued by Baskerville Pres). The novel is a love story that attempts to convey the impressions and yearnings of an 18-year-old boy, Leland Pefley, in his first exploration of the world; the novel is largely autobiographical. Perdue's next novel, Lee, was about the same Leland Pefley, now an old man, bitter, hostile, angry at a world that no longer recognized the values and culture of the 1950s. He spewed venom at those who, surrounded by beauty, culture and literature, didn't bother to avail themselves of it. Other works include The Node, Fields of Asphodel and The New Austerities, which depicts Lee Pefley's flight from New York City back to his ancestral home in Alabama. That same year, Baskerville Press published Perdue's Opportunities in Alabama Agriculture, a strange fictional account of an Alabama man, school teacher, rural route mail carrier, and farmer. In the pages of Kirkus Reviews it was said Perdue \\"writes convincingly and iconoclastically‚Ä¶ a marvelous black comedy that is sometimes as astringent as John Yount's Toots in Solitude‚Ä¶\\" Political opinions Perdue is a member of the League of the South, a Neo- Confederate group. The Southern Poverty Law Center has labeled the group as a \\"hate group\\", something Perdue contests. Publications *Lee ‚Äì Four Walls Eight Windows, 1991; repr.

It was inspired by BBI's original Mystery Science Theater 3000 TV series, and was directed by former Executive Producer Jim Mallon. The series featured the robot characters from the original series in a variety of brief sketches taking place at an undetermined point during the original show's fictional timeline. However, no human character (Joel or Mike) is present. Cast * Paul Chaplin as Crow T. Robot * James Moore as Tom Servo * Jim Mallon as Gypsy History The animated version of MST3K was first announced on the Satellite News website (formerly BBI's official website) on October 29, 2007. The new cartoon was described as a \\"weekly series of animated adventures,\\" and would debut as part of an all-new MST3K website. This new site would also feature content from the original series as well as a new online store. The website went live on November 5, 2007 along with the first installment of the animated series. New episodes were scheduled to be posted every Monday. However, despite regular updates to other parts of the site, no new episodes of the cartoon have been posted since November 26, 2007. In June 2008, the website was redesigned and the cartoons removed for unspecified reasons; however the Flash likenesses of the characters were still present on some pages. On July 18, MST3K fansite Satellite News posted an interview with Jim Mallon, who explained that the cartoons cost more to produce than was initially estimated. He also stated that the existing cartoons will return to the site, and expressed hope that the series may continue at some point in the future. Animation producer Shadi Petosky responded that the costs were low and flat rates that never changed from the original estimates, she suspects that the revenue was the problem and the mouse pads, post-it notes, and T-shirts being sold to pay for the show did not sell as fans did not like the poorly designed and written animated characters. Shad refers to Shadi. Reactions Initially, response to the new website on both of the major fan discussion boards was largely negative. Michael J. Nelson, star and head writer of the original series, called the animated series \\"cute\\" but felt it was an \\"after-the-fact\\" idea. Viewers of the flash series had said that the animation was poor and the voice actors did not fit with the characters. Episodes # \\"Reel Livin'\\": Crow goes fishing and discusses the benefits of his \\"incredibly stable\\" kayak before being capsized by Servo on a jet ski. # \\"Feels Like\\": Gypsy and Servo discuss actual temperature versus the wind chill factor. Servo then begins translating everything Gypsy says into \\"feels like...\\" statements, much to her annoyance. # \\"Thanksgiving Clown\\": Servo dresses up as a clown, thinking it to be a Thanksgiving tradition. Crow consults an old World Book encyclopedia to verify. # \\"Solitaire\\": Crow plays solitaire while Servo advises. Eventually Crow becomes fed up with Servo's pestering and leaves. Servo sees a fantastic move, but can't play as his arms don't work. Desperate, he unsuccessfully tries to move the cards using telekinesis, but in the process breaks himself.

However, the Jewish Genealogical Society of Great Britain have no records of this as a Jewish family name. Albeit, the Consolidated Jewish Family Name Index of U.S. based Avotaynu indicates Adin is a Jewish family name that was present in Poland and Belarus prior to World War 2.

Some branches remained in Derbyshire until they emigrated to Foxton, New Zealand, in 1863, arriving on a ship called the Helvellyn. = Cultural assimilation within the United States= During the 19th and 20th centuries many immigrants poured into the United States from various European countries and the dominant culture found their names to be difficult to pronounce and/or even spell. Adin, as a family name was chosen by a very small number of Eastern European immigrants during the cultural assimilation to the United States for socio-political reasons and acceptance by the dominant culture. Entire families legally modified their family name from ‚ÄúAdinski‚Äù and ‚ÄúAdinus‚Äù to Adin; some decades after their arrival into the United States. =Emigration to Israel= Since 1948 many immigrants have also changed their names back to Hebrew names; some have chosen Adin, in order to erase remnants of \\"galuti\\" (exiled) life still surviving in family names from other languages.

The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The District is a participant in: Healthy School Zone, PANA, and the Carlisle Health and Wellness Foundation's Wellness @ Work initiative. The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education ‚Äî Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. The High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced- price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that Districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non-subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk.

Sinclair Lewis was born in that house on February 7, 1885, joining two older brothers, Fred (born 1875) and Claude (born 1878). When Lewis was just a few months old the family moved across the street into this house. Edwin Lewis was a physician and conducted his medical practice out of the house, as was common at the time. Emma Lewis died in 1891, when Lewis was six. The following year Dr. Lewis married Isabel Warner, whose company young Lewis apparently enjoyed. He began reading books at a young age and kept a diary. He began writing as well, sometimes in the garret of the carriage house. Dr. Lewis was a stern disciplinarian who had difficulty relating to his sensitive, unathletic third son. Throughout his lonely boyhood, the ungainly Lewis‚Äîtall, extremely thin, stricken with acne, and somewhat pop-eyed‚Äîhad trouble gaining friends and pined after various local girls. At the age of 13 he unsuccessfully ran away from home, wanting to become a drummer boy in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. In late 1902, at the age of 17, Lewis finally left Sauk Centre to attend school on the East Coast, ultimately graduating from Yale University in 1908. Lewis's experiences growing up in Sauk Centre were the inspiration for his first novel, Main Street, published in 1920. Many episodes in the novel derive from real events in his youth. More crucially, he bared his frustrations with his outsider status, extolling small-town values while savaging those who were hypocritical about them. Main Street brought Lewis swift international fame. However the residents of Sauk Centre recognized the real-life inspirations in the novel's fictional town of Gopher Prairie and were offended. Later history By the mid-20th century the house had been converted to a duplex, with the lower level dining room converted into a bedroom and bathroom and a kitchen installed on the second floor. Other alterations included stucco applied to the exterior, the ground floor kitchen partitioned and the door to the rear porch sealed, floors replaced, the front porch enclosed, and a dormer added to the roofline. In 1956 the Sinclair Lewis Foundation acquired the house. With assistance from the Minnesota Historical Society, they restored the house to its appearance during the time of Lewis's residence. In addition to reverting the numerous alterations, they brought back period wallpaper, reroofed the house and carriage house, installed HVAC equipment in the basement, and restored the grounds. The restoration was largely funded by the Foundation's sale of the Sinclair Lewis birthplace house across the street, and was completed in 2003. The house is now furnished with appropriate period items, including several genuinely owned by the Lewis family.

It stars Kirk Douglas and Anthony Quinn. Douglas and Holliman had previously appeared together in Sturges' Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), which used much of the same crew. Plot Two old friends, Matt Morgan (Kirk Douglas) and Craig Belden (Anthony Quinn), now find themselves on opposite sides of the law. Belden, a rich cattle baron, is the de facto ruler of the town of Gun Hill. Morgan is a U.S. Marshal living in another town with his Native American/Indian wife (played by Ziva Rodann) and young son, Petey. Two young drunken cowboys rape and murder Morgan's wife while she is returning with their son from a visit to her father. The boy escapes on one of the killers' horses which bears a distinctive, fancy saddle. Morgan sets off to find the killer. His one clue is the saddle, which he recognizes as belonging to Belden. Assuming it was stolen from his old friend, Morgan travels to the town of Gun Hill to pick up the trail, but once there he quickly realizes that Belden's son Rick (Earl Holliman) is the killer. Belden refuses to turn over his son, forcing Morgan to go against the entire town. Morgan vows to capture Rick and get him on that night's last train from Gun Hill. Morgan takes Rick prisoner, holding him at the hotel. Belden sends men to rescue his son, but Morgan manages to hold them off. In the meantime, Belden's former lover (Carolyn Jones) decides to help Morgan. She sneaks a shotgun to his hotel room. The second rapist, Lee, sets fire to the hotel to flush out Morgan. Morgan presses the shotgun to Rick's chin on the way to the train depot, threatening to pull the trigger if anyone attempts to stop him. Lee tries to kill Morgan but shoots Rick instead. Morgan then kills Lee with the shotgun. As the train prepares to leave, a devastated Belden confronts Morgan in a final showdown and is gunned down.

A trained physician from New York State, he first traveled to Oregon as part of the Methodist Mission in the Willamette Valley. He returned to the region after a falling- out with mission leader Jason Lee as the leader of one of the first large wagon trains across the Oregon Trail and as a sub-Indian agent of the federal government. In Oregon he used his authority to regulate affairs between the Natives and settlers, and even between settlers. White left the region in 1845 as a messenger for the Provisional Government of Oregon to the United States Congress, returning in 1850 before leaving again for California in the early 1860s. Early life White was born in New York, in 1806.Corning, Howard M. Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing, 1956. There he received his education, including medical training at a school of medicine in Syracuse, New York. Prior to 1836 he married, and the couple had a son named Jason as well as adopting another son named George. In 1836, White accepted an appointment to join Jason Lee in Oregon Country at the Methodist Church‚Äôs mission. White and his family sailed to the Sandwich Islands aboard the vessel Hamilton, arriving in July 1836. Others on the ship bound for the mission included William H. Wilson, Alanson Beers, and Miss Anna Maria Pittman who became Lee's first wife.Horner, John B. (1919). Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. The J.K. Gill Co.: Portland. p. 71 On the islands both White and his wife taught to the Native Islanders until May 1837 when they continued on to Oregon. Oregon Seal of the Provisional Government After arriving the family took up residence at the Methodist Mission along the Willamette River at Mission Bottom. His infant son Jason drowned in 1838 after a canoe his wife and David Leslie were traveling in flipped over on the Columbia River. His other son also drowned that year while trying to ford the Willamette River. Elijah White and Jason Lee developed animosity towards each other and differences in opinion on the direction of the mission leading to White leaving in 1841 to return to the East. In 1842, White led the first wagon train over the Oregon Trail that had more than 100 people. Trapper and later politician Osborne Russell served as guide to this migration.The First Men In Charge. End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center, accessed November 5, 2007. The party set out on May 16, 1842, from Elm Grove, Missouri, with 112 people, 18 wagons, and a variety of livestock.Clarke, S. A. 1905. Pioneer Days of Oregon History. Portland: J.K. Gill Company. Along the journey, some in the migration grew wary of White‚Äôs leadership and L. B. Hastings was selected as leader for a time until the party split into two groups. Fran√ßois X. Matthieu along with several other Canadians joined the party along the way to Oregon. White arrived at Fort Vancouver ahead of the main party, arriving on September 20, 1842. White also returned as an official agent of the United States Government, after appointment as sub-Indian agent. Also in 1842 in his official capacity he brokered a code of conduct for the Nez Perce tribe as well as placating tensions with the Walla Walla and Cayuse tribes near the Whitman Mission in the eastern section of the region. In Oregon he served as teacher to William J. Bailey, training Bailey as a doctor. On September 22, 1842, White organized a meeting at Champoeg where he informed the settlers that he had been commissioned by the United States War Department as a sub- Indian Agent and implied that the pioneers could select him as their leader. He appointed judges to deal with disputes between Native Americans and United States citizens, and even between citizens.Gray, William Henry. 1870. A History of Oregon, 1792-1849, drawn from personal observation and authentic information. Portland, Or: Harris & Holman. In 1843, White was selected as one of twelve members of the second Wolf Meeting to determine if the settlers wanted to form a government while waiting for the Oregon Question to be resolved. He was not involved in the final meetings, but in May 1843 the settlers voted 52 to 50 in favor of creating the Provisional Government of Oregon. The following year White was involved with the Cockstock Incident when the provisional government‚Äôs recorder George LeBreton was killed by a Native American by the name of Cockstock. He had tried to capture Cockstock prior to the bloodshed, and then worked to resolve tensions between the settlers and Native Americans after Cockstock and two settlers were killed.Jette, Melinda. The Comstock Incident. The Oregon History Project, accessed November 5, 2007. White then discovered a pass through the Oregon Coast Range to what is now Newport, Oregon in 1845 before leaving the region with a petition from the Provisional Government to the United States Congress that same year. According to historian Frances Fuller Victor, White, through his exploration and advocacy for a southern cutoff to the Willamette Valley, may have been primarily responsible for the disastrous Meek Cutoff party of 1845. Later life Elijah White returned to what had become the Oregon Territory in 1850 to promote the community of Pacific City, Washington along the Columbia River. Located near what is now Ilwaco, he partnered with James Duval Holman to sell property to settlers. White received a second commission as an Indian agent in 1861 for the region west of the Rocky Mountains and moved to California. Doctor Elijah White died on April 3, 1879, at the age of 73.

They were one of the founding members of the Rugby League Conference as Kingston. History In 1978, schoolboys at Ambleside Middle School in Walton-on- Thames, Surrey were introduced to the game by a teacher. The boys really took to it and began to play matches against other schools in 1979. An early claim to fame came in September 1980 when the boys were invited to take part in a curtain raiser at Craven Cottage when Fulham RLFC took on Wigan in their first ever fixture. They also became the first school team from the South of England to win a game in Yorkshire. Graham Belbin, long serving coach at Elmbridge was involved in that first curtain raiser game for Ambleside. However, when the boys transferred to the local senior school, the PE teacher there wouldn't allow them to play. Undeterred, they carried on, surreptitiously using the school's facilities until they were found out. When they reached the age of 16 they became an Open Age club under the name Ambleside. Then someone from Wokingham in Berkshire found a council ground, so the club relocated and changed their name to Wokingham. Players trained at Bracknell Leisure Centre but a lot of the players still came from the Walton area and travelling to Berkshire to train and play was too far. The club found a pitch at Lightwater Country Park, which they shared with Lightwater RFC for around seven seasons. The club were nicknamed the squirrels with the club logo being modelled on the squirrel badge of the country park. So by 1986, the club had changed its name again to Surrey Heath and were playing in the Southern Amateur Rugby League. For the 1986/87 season, they joined the Midlands and South West Amateur Rugby League Association (MASWARLA) in its second season but returned to the Southern Amateur Rugby League, which had been rebranded the London League, for the 1988-89 season. The local council decided to re-lay the pitch at Lightwater, which left the club looking for another home. They played at Esher RFC for about three years. They then moved to nearby Claygate as tenants of a rugby union club, Old Johnians, they would subsequently take over the ground as Old Johnians moved on merging with another club. This move prompted another name change to Kingston in 1996 and were one of the founding members of the Southern Conference in 1997. They were placed in the Eastern Division but resigned from the conference after only playing one game. They remained in the London League until the final winter season of 1999/2000 but had their results expunged from the table for calling off too many games. Newly rebranded Kingston Warriors returned to the Southern Conference now known as the Rugby League Conference in 2000 and competed in the Southern Division. The club played at the same level for the next few years with its division being known as the London & South Division between 2001 and 2003; the South Division in 2004 and the London & South Division in 2005. Kingston Warriors won the London & South Division and made it as far as the semi-final of the Harry Jepson Trophy but lost 36-16 to Gloucestershire Warriors. In that very same season Kingston Warriors legendary wing/full back Damian Lawton scored 17 tries in 15 games which still stands as a record today. Warriors were promoted to the Rugby League Conference South Premier division in 2006. The move to Claygate became permanent; the club now had a home of their own and became Elmbridge in 2006, because the ground was owned by the local council and didn't want them playing under the name associated with the neighbouring Kingston borough. The club added \\"Eagles\\" in 2009. Elmbridge Rugby League Club later moved to their current ground in Claygate (currently going through refurbishment) under the name of Kingston Warriors. Eventually the identity was changed to Elmbridge Rugby League, Elmbridge being the Borough council district that the ground is situated within. The Club is a founding member of the Southern Conference and has teams from Under 7 to Adults. During the ground refurbishment period Elmbridge Rugby Club are now based at nearby Old Cranleighans Sports Club in Thames Ditton. The Elmbridge Club has an experienced coaching team that all have strong links to the region and all of whom are coaches for the Broncos Regional Origins Representative programme, providing a pathway to the Broncos Scholarship and Academy Squads. Alongside Graham Belbin, Kevin Rudd, the former head of the Rugby League European Federation is now a volunteer at the Club and was coached by John Risman, during their time with Scotland Rugby League. John played for Fulham in that opening game in 1980 and is listed as Player No.1 on the London Broncos Heritage Players List. Brother of Sir Bev Risman, whom was also influential with Rugby League in London in the 1980‚Äôs/90‚Äôs, establishing many foundations for the sport. A statue to their father Gus Risman can be found outside Wembley Stadium. Matt Walker also played at London Skolars, before moving to the Elmbridge region and going into coaching at the Club. Elmbridge welcome contact from players and volunteers alike interested to get involved in Rugby League at one of the oldest Community Clubs in London.

In 1838, he obtained contracts with the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company to build their Manchester station (now Manchester Victoria station) and the viaduct from the station to Miles Platting.Wells p73 Other railway contracts followed. Early life and career Brogden was born on 2 February, 1798 on his father's farm at Worston, near Clitheroe in Lancashire. He was raised on Worston and another farm near Clitheroe. As a young man he migrated to a rapidly growing Manchester and established himself originally as a cleansing contractor. Whereas other ambitious young men in Manchester at that time chose to work in the burgeoning cotton industry, Brogden was an outdoor man, fond of riding and hunting and experienced with horses, so he preferred to work in haulage and transport. For further details of his work see John Brogden and Sons. He partnered with Joseph Whitworth to use the latter's patent cleansing machines. He also started the same business in Westminster. As the eldest four of his five sons came of age and joined him to form John Brogden and Sons he took iron-mining leases in Furness. They quickly saw that a rail link from Furness to the rest of England and Wales was critical to the industrial development of Furness so they promoted the Ulverston and Lancaster Railway to run across Morecambe Bay from Carnforth to Ulverston, receiving the Royal Assent in 1851. This was an innovative, challenging and risky project but it was eventually completed in 1857 and soon purchased by the Furness Railway.Marshall pp 153, 204Andrews pp 75‚Äì88 Beginning in 1853 the family expanded into South Wales buying mining leases and an Iron Works in the Llynfi and Ogmore Valleys. They developed these vigorously, also building a railway in the Ogmore Valley and a new harbour at Porthcawl.Higgins From an early age Brogden was a Methodist and in later life he contributed generously in time and money to Methodist and other good causes. He was educated at Clitheroe Grammar School.According to Smiles p223. Also a John Brogden of Worston was baptised at Downham (the local parish church for Worston) on 25 February 1798 and many earlier Brogdens were baptised, married and buried there. However some authorities say he was born in Furness. The reason for this is that Casson, page 66, misquoting Smiles, changes the place from Worston to \\"Marton, in North Lancashire\\". Then Marshall (1958) accepts this and mentions that Marton is \\"near Dalton-in-Furness\\". Then Higgins (1978) in his turn accepts Marshall, leaves out Marton and just puts \\"Furness\\". It is quite clear from Smiles' text that Brogden was born at a farm called Worston, moved a short distance to another called Hookcliff and from there attended Clitheroe Grammar School \\"the nearest and best that was accessible\\". The place names Worston and Hookcliff can still be found near Clitheroe. The Furness theory can be rejected.  Family life  In 1822 he married Sarah Hannah McWilliams, only daughter of Alexander McWilliams of Hazelhurst near Ashton-under-Lyne. She had been educated at the Moravian School in Dukinfield .Smiles (1870)The County Families of Glamorganshire (c. 1875), page 165: Brogden, Alexander, provides 'Sarah Hannah', which is not given in Smiles The family lived as Methodists. The Methodists had close connections with the Moravians and John would have found Methodist chapels much easier to find on his many travels. Their children were: John, born Manchester 1823, married Ellen Garstang 20 March 1849 at Manchester Cathedral, died suddenly on 6 November 1855 at his home, Lightburn House, Ulverston, age 32.Higgins (1978) Lightburn House was later pulled down and replaced by the Coronation Hall.Gilpin (1988) Alexander, born Manchester 3 November 1825, married Ann Garstang 6 September 1848 at Manchester Cathedral., died 26 November 1892 in Croydon.The Times (1892) Henry, born Manchester 1828, married Sarah Ann Marshall on 11 September 1862 in Stockport, died at Hale Lodge, Hale, Altrincham, Cheshire in 1913. James, born Manchester 7 April 1832, spent most of his adult life in Mid-Glamorgan, first at Tondu and later at Porthcawl, where he died in January 1907. George William Hargreaves Brogden, was born in 1842 and died in London in 1892. All the above sons except George joined him in his business on reaching the age of 21. Sarah Hannah, born in 1834, married Samuel Budgett on 5 June 1858. He was son and joint heir of the Bristol grocer Samuel Budgett.Richardson, p. 231 She died in 1905. Mary Jane, referred to as Jenny, married William Billing in Manchester Cathedral on 18 December 1867 and at one time they lived at Dunham Grange, Bowdon, Cheshire.  Death and afterwards  John Brogden (sen.) died at his home, Raglan House, Raglan Road, Sale (then in Cheshire) on 9 December 1869.Wednesbury Herald In his will he left his business to his sons Alexander, Henry and James but he also set up a trust for Mrs Billing of ¬£7,250 and previously a marriage settlement of ¬£10,000. The trustees were: Alexander and James Brogden, and Samuel Budgett. For five years from his death the partners were empowered to use the trust money in the business but after that they had to provide evidence of good assets that were independent of it. They failed to do this so that, from December 1874, all the trustees were in breach of trust and therefore all individually liable to replace all the assets of the trust. No doubt they hoped that the firm would pull through. In fact, Brogdens failed in 1880 and Mary Billing sued the trustees for the money. The action \\"Billing vs. Brogden\\" was tried in 1887 and appealed in 1888 with the result that Samuel Budgett, the only solvent trustee, had to replace all the trust's missing money himself. The partnership of James, William and Samuel Budgett, trading as H.H. & S. Budgett, broke up.

Informedness is its generalization to the multiclass case and estimates the probability of an informed decision.  Definition  Youden's J statistic is : J = \\\\text{sensitivity} + \\\\text{specificity} -1 with the two right-hand quantities being sensitivity and specificity. Thus the expanded formula is: : J = \\\\frac{\\\\text{true positives}}{\\\\text{true positives}+\\\\text{false negatives}}+\\\\frac{\\\\text{true negatives}}{\\\\text{true negatives}+\\\\text{false positives}}-1 The index was suggested by W.J. Youden in 1950 as a way of summarising the performance of a diagnostic test. Its value ranges from 0 through 1 (inclusive), and has a zero value when a diagnostic test gives the same proportion of positive results for groups with and without the disease, i.e the test is useless. A value of 1 indicates that there are no false positives or false negatives, i.e. the test is perfect. The index gives equal weight to false positive and false negative values, so all tests with the same value of the index give the same proportion of total misclassified results. While it is technically possible to obtain a value of less than zero from this equation, e.g. Classification yields only False Positives and False Negatives, a value of less than zero just indicates that the positive and negative labels have been switched. After correcting the labels the result will then be in the 0 through 1 range. Example of a receiver operating characteristic curve. Solid red: ROC curve; Dashed line: Chance level; Vertical line (J) maximum value of Youden's index for the ROC curveYouden's index is often used in conjunction with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The index is defined for all points of an ROC curve, and the maximum value of the index may be used as a criterion for selecting the optimum cut-off point when a diagnostic test gives a numeric rather than a dichotomous result. The index is represented graphically as the height above the chance line, and it is also equivalent to the area under the curve subtended by a single operating point. Youden's index is also known as deltap and generalizes from the dichotomous to the multiclass case as informedness. The use of a single index is \\"not generally to be recommended\\",Everitt B.S. (2002) The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics. CUP but informedness or Youden's index is the probability of an informed decision (as opposed to a random guess) and takes into account all predictions. An unrelated but commonly used combination of basic statistics from information retrieval is the F-score, being a (possibly weighted) harmonic mean of recall and precision where recall = sensitivity = true positive rate, but specificity and precision are totally different measures. F-score, like recall and precision, only considers the so-called positive predictions, with recall being the probability of predicting just the positive class, precision being the probability of a positive prediction being correct, and F-score equating these probabilities under the effective assumption that the positive labels and the positive predictions should have the same distribution and prevalence, similar to the assumption underlying of Fleiss' kappa. Youden's J, Informedness, Recall, Precision and F-score are intrinsically undirectional, aiming to assess the deductive effectiveness of predictions in the direction proposed by a rule, theory or classifier. Markedness (deltap) is Youden's J used to assess the reverse or abductive direction, and matches well human learning of associations; rules and, superstitions as we model possible causation; while correlation and kappa evaluate bidirectionally. Matthews correlation coefficient is the geometric mean of the regression coefficient of the problem and its dual, where the component regression coefficients of the Matthews correlation coefficient are Markedness (inverse of Youden's J or deltap) and informedness (Youden's J or deltap'). Kappa statistics such as Fleiss' kappa and Cohen's kappa are methods for calculating inter-rater reliability based on different assumptions about the marginal or prior distributions, and are increasingly used as chance corrected alternatives to accuracy in other contexts. Fleiss' kappa, like F-score, assumes that both variables are drawn from the same distribution and thus have the same expected prevalence, while Cohen's kappa assumes that the variables are drawn from distinct distributions and referenced to a model of expectation that assumes prevalences are independent. When the true prevalences for the two positive variables are equal as assumed in Fleiss kappa and F-score, that is the number of positive predictions matches the number of positive classes in the dichotomous (two class) case, the different kappa and correlation measure collapse to identity with Youden's J, and recall, precision and F-score are similarly identical with accuracy.

In either case, the goal is to cool the hot, compressed air going from the turbocharger into the engine. With the tip turbine, a small quantity of compressed air is bled off to spin a small fan that draws air through the aftercooler tubes. In some later models, a water cooler was also used, in addition to the tip turbine setup. Mack called the tip-turbine setup an intercooler and used a pyrometer to alert the operator if the exhaust gas exceeded a limit. The tip turbine setup was compact and the shorter plumbing runs allowed boost to build faster. Later models with the front mounted air- to-air cooler required a larger turbocharger to fill the tubes faster but with the benefit of additional power. Modern trucks use the air-to-air cooler in nearly all cases. Large Mack trucks from the 1970s such as the Mack R-600 used coolpower systems. Some coolpower systems used vertical bar shutters that could be opened and shut in front of the radiator to maintain proper operating temperature. The Mack Cruise Liner model built in 1984, a 6X4 Primemover, used a coolpower engine.Trucks Plus Other meanings =Air intakes on turbochargers= The term is also used to refer to ‚ÄúCool Power‚Äù air intake systems for turbocharged engines. These systems provide cooler air to the turbocharger and engine, instead of the potentially too-warm air from the engine compartment. Cooler intake air is denser, which means that the engine can produce the same power with less fuel. Cooler air also gives the engine more power for applications such as towing heavy loads up driving up steep grades during the summer. Cooler air drawn into the engine compartment lowers the temperature under the hood, which allows plastic, rubber and electronic parts to last longer. Lastly, cool power systems will supports larger turbochargers by creating additional air flow to the engine. http://www.psmdiesel.com/air_03_without.html =Hydraulic drive system= The US military uses the expression \\"cool power\\" to describe its \\"regenerative drive unit\\", a \\"light-weight hybrid hydraulic drive system\\" that weighs 330 pounds.

The station is owned by American General Media and broadcasts an adult album alternative (AAA) radio format. KKAL is notable due to its linkage to the area's wine industry and culture, both in its imaging (e.g. the \\"Krush\\" name, as in crushed grapes) and various wine-related programs that air regularly. The studios and offices are on Sacramento Drive in San Luis Obispo and the transmitter is off TV Tower Road in Santa Margarita, California. History =Early years= KKAL first signed on November 20, 1972 as KPRA, the sister station to KPRL (1230 AM), with a country music format. In December 1982, KPRA switched its call sign to KDDB but kept the country format. In April 1991, Owensville Communications Company sold KDDB to Zindy Broadcasting, headed by Stephen B. Jones, for $350,000. =American General Media era (1997-present)= In 1997, American General Media purchased KDDB for $675,000. The country format lasted until 2000, when the station became KWSR, a modern adult contemporary outlet known as \\"Star 92.5\\". In 2004, the station changed its call letters to KKAL and flipped to classic country, a format that lasted only two years. In April 2007, KKAL switched formats to hot adult contemporary with the new moniker \\"The Krush @ 92.5\\". This branding is inspired by the surrounding Paso Robles wine country, conjuring up images of the vineyards that host wine tasting tours that have grown in popularity.
