But life happens. You don’t see the years rolling into each other, then you wake up one day, and you’ve been in England 20 years\\").Miriam N. Kotzin, \\"Molara Wood, The Per Contra Interview\\", Per Contra: The International Journal of the Arts, Literature and Ideas. In a 2015 interview with Oyebade Dosunmu for Aké Review, Wood elaborated: \\"Even long before my UK days I had lived in Northern and South-Western Nigeria as well as Los Angeles—all by the age of eleven or twelve. There’s a sense in which you’re always out of time, out of place—and the years in Britain merely compounded that. The feeling doesn’t go away with return to Nigeria, it merely mutates, as people remark about me coming across as someone from ‘away’, even when I’m trying to blend in. I am therefore pretty sensitive to the permutations of dislocation and re-integration, and London was a huge tableau for me to observe this theatre of human experience as far as Nigerian immigrants were concerned.\\" In 2007 her fiction was highly commended in the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association Short Story Competition, and in 2008 she won the inaugural John La Rose Memorial Short Story Competition.\\"The John La Rose Memorial Short Story Competition\\", Wordsbody, 17 March 2008.

These worlds spiral into one another, and their inhabitants spin along, negotiating extremes of human circumstance—barrenness, the (fated) pursuit of glamour, madness, death—struggling, all the while, to plant roots in shifting sand.\\"Oyebade Dosunmu, \\"Peripatetic Lives: An Interview with Molara Wood, Author of Indigo\\" (interview), Aké Review, 30 November 2015. Many of the stories deal with the lives of African women negotiating concerns such as barrenness, polygamy and widowhood, and Wood has said that \\"these are the writings of a womanist, a feminist. I have a great empathy, a well of feeling for what women go through. I don’t feel these are given adequate treatment in the writings of male writers, so it’s really up to us, the female writers, to privilege the voices and experiences of women.\\" Wood was a judge for the 2015 Etisalat Prize for Literature,Judges, Etisalat Prize for Literature. is on the Advisory Board of the Aké Arts and Book Festival and has been a participant in many literary events including the Lagos Book & Art Festival.\\"Molara Wood Reads from 'Indigo', Other Works, At Quintessence\\", CORA 2016 Events, 5 July 2016.

Denis attended the Blackheath School of Art. Avebury Stone Circle Grant King was employed at Avebury from 1938 to 1941 as a draftsman and surveyor. His accurate site recording facilitated the repositioning of the fallen stones.Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine 1995 vol 88 As well as producing site plans and archaeological drawings, he kept a diary of the excavationhttp://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/nra/lists/GB-1659-MS.Collections.htm and created observational cartoons for the amusement of his colleagues. The high standard of his site drawings was a notable feature of Grant King’s career. Grant King was a conscientious objector during the wartime period and was allocated agricultural tasks. Although initially charged with caring for poultry at the evacuated Beltaine School, he was promoted to teaching history and archaeology. Excavations in Wiltshire After World War II, Grant King was employed by Keiller’s archaeological successor Dr Isobel Smith on her site at Windmill Hill, Avebury. After this, he went on to lead excavations of his own.

He published a series of excavation reports for Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine.WANHM vols 58, 62 and 64 Another project was Lanhill Long Barrow (known locally as Hubba's Low). The barrow had been recorded by John Aubrey in 1647, but was subsequently largely obliterated through quarrying and invasive excavation. In 1954 the Ministry of Works gave permission for Lanhill to be cleared of brambles. Grant King wrote several letters of complaint to the Ministry and other heritage organisations, highlighting the damage caused by using a bulldozer to undertake the clearance. Ultimately, King lead an excavation in 1963 to record the barrow. He called upon his Bury Wood Excavation Club to assist in rebuilding many of the damaged areas. Through painstaking investigation he was able to construct a plan of the barrow.D Grant King, The Lanhill Long Barrow, an essay in reconstruction. Proceedings of the Prehistoric Society 1966 vol 32 Later work In his later years Grant King became increasingly concerned with the effects of development on the historic landscape of Wiltshire. In 1972 he convened the Ridgeway Conservation Conference, to protect the ancient trackway from traffic damage.http://www.ridgewayfriends.org.uk/about-us/history/ He opposed aspects of the Salisbury ring road and the negligent treatment of medieval buildings in Devizes.

In the mid-1860s Pinker left Box and traveled to London, where he found employment as a mason in Kensington. Shortly afterwards, he met Jane Harris. They married on 31 December 1876 in Southwark. They would go on to have three daughters: Jennifer \\"Jenny\\" (1878–1970), Florence (1881–1929) and Rose (1884–1976). Pinker became employed at the British Museum on 18 November 1872, and would go on to work there for just under 60 years. From 1 January 1873 he worked for the Department of Antiquities, and was foreman of masons from 1894. He undertook many highly skilled tasks, not only for the Department of Antiquities but also for other areas of the British Museum. He played a significant role in situating fragments of the Elgin Marbles, and also advised during the construction of the model of the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus. Alexander Stuart Murray commented that Pinker's work was \\"more appropriate to a sculptor's assistant than to a mason.\\" He retired on 5 April 1932, due to failing health.

Subhash is shown as a clever, left- wing ideologist, and tries to bring his friends, including Paul, into the party. Krishnan, who came from Irinjalakuda, is also seen as a strong figure, but not completely absorbed in the leftist ideology. There is eventually a skirmish between Subhash's gang and a bunch of people lead by KSU activist Kanjan (Jinu John), but it's stopped safely.

These debates were conducted, sometimes with royal patronage, to examine various religious, philosophical, moral and doctrinal issues. The corpus of knowledge on conducting a successful debate was referred to as vādavidyā and several manuals dealing with this discipline had been produced. It was from these debates that the Indian tradition of logic and allied investigations were evolved and developed. The antiquity of this tradition can be traced even to pre-Buddhist period. For example, Brhadaranyaka Upsanisad, a pre-Buddhist text, has references to King Janaka as not only organizing and patronizing debates between the sages and priests but also as participating in such debates. Women also used to participate in these debates. Gargi was a woman scholar who used to participate in the debates in King Janaka's court. Though debate was popular at the time of the Upanisads, there was no theory of debates during that period. Such a theory evolved along with the spread of the teachings of Buddha, Mahavira, and other ascetics or religious reformers. By the third and second century BCE, monks and priests were required to have a training in the art of conducting a successful debate. Several debate manuals were written in different sectarian schools. But these early manuals written in Sanskrit have all been lost. However, the nature of these manuals could be glimpsed from Buddhist Chinese sources as well as from Pali sources like the Kathavatthu. Theory of debate in Charaka Samhitha The earliest available treatises in Sanskrit in which the principles of debates are systematically explored are, strangely, two texts on Ayurveda, namely Charaka Samhita and Sushruta Samhita. These are the two foundational Hindu texts of this field that have survived from ancient India. Charaka Samhitha is a voluminous work containing 120 chapters divided into eight parts. In the third part, called Vimanasthana, along with other topics like training of a physician, ethics of medical practice, pathology, diet and nourishment, taste of medicines, etc., there is also a discussion on the principles of debate. The related doctrines are treated in Caraka-samhita under three heads, namely, 1) Karyabhinirvrtti, the aggregate of resources for the accomplishment of an action (2) Pariksa, the standard of examination, and (3) Sambhasha-vidhi, or vada-vidhi, the method of debate. This is followed by detailed discussions on these three topics. For example, there is a discussion on the various resources that are to be examined to accomplish an action. These resources include Karana (the actor, or agent who accomplishes an action), Karya (the action), Karya-phala (the effect), Desa (the place of the action), Kala (the time of the action), Pravrtti (the activity or exertion put forth for achieving the action), etc. The second head, Pariksa, deals with the standard of examination. These standards are aptopadesa (reliable assertion) pratyaksa (perception), anumana (inference), yukti (reasoning). The discussion under the third head is much more elaborate. The examination of vada-vidhi begins by dividing debates into two classes, namely, anuloma sambhasha (peaceful debate) and vigrihya sambhasha (hostile debate). The respondents are then classified as superior, equal and inferior. Also, the assembly witnessing the debate is classified as learned and ignorant. Each of these is then further classified as friendly, indifferent or hostile. There are suggestions as to how to handle the debate depending on the nature of the respondents and of the assembly. The treatise then goes on to give a list of 44 items a thorough knowledge of which is essential for the successful conduct of a debate. Theory of debate in Nyayasutras The Nyayasutras contain a more systematic and improved version of the theory of debate than the one presented in Charaka Samhitha. The term katha (meaning speech or discourse) is the preferred term to denote philosophical debate in Nyaya literature. The Nyayasutras mention three kinds of debate, namely, vada, jalpa, and vitanda. The first variety is between a proponent and his teacher or somebody with a similar status. The other two are between those who want victory. The goal of the first is establishment of truth or an accepted doctrine, that of the other two is victory. The first corresponds to Caraka's friendly or congenial debate, and the other two to his hostile debate. =Vada, the honest debate= Vada, the good or honest debate, is constituted by the following characteristics: * Establishment (of the thesis) and refutation (of the counter-thesis) should be based upon adequate evidence or means for knowledge (pramana) as well as upon (proper) hypothetical or indirect reasoning (tarka). *The conclusion should not entail contradiction with any tenet or accepted doctrine (siddhanta). *Each side should use the well-known five steps of the demonstration of an argument explicitly. *They should clearly recognize a thesis to be defended and a counter thesis to be refuted. =Jalpa, the bad debate= Jalpa is defined in Nyayasutra as a debate where, among the stated characteristics of the first type of debate, only such characteristics as would seem appropriate would be applicable. In addition, the debater can use, for the establishment of his own position and for the refutation of the opponent's thesis, such means as quibbling, illegitimate rejoinders and any kind of clincher. Three kinds of quibbling are listed, twenty-four kinds of illegitimate rejoinders and twenty- two kinds of clinchers. =Vitanda, the wrangling debate= The third debate mentioned in the Nyayasutra is called vitanda, which has sometimes been translated as wrangling. It is defined as a debate where no counter-thesis is established. In other words, the debater here tries to ensure victory simply by refuting the thesis put forward by the other side. It is sometimes claimed to be a type of bad debate, for the only goal is victory, as in the second type, and the use of such trickery as quibbling and illegitimate rejoinder is allowed.

It served as infantry in some of the bitterest fighting on the Western Front in World War I and as a searchlight regiment in Anti-Aircraft Command during World War II. Origin The unit had its origins in two of the many Rifle Volunteer Corps (RVCs) formed in the wake of an invasion scare in 1859.Beckett. The 47th Lancashire RVC formed at St Helens on 29 February 1860, consisting of five companies. It was under the command of Major David Gamble, a local chemical manufacturer, and members of the Pilkington glassmaking family of St Helens and Brunner chemical manufacturing family of Widnes were prominent among the unit's officers.Frederick, pp. 188–9.Westlake, pp. 146–7.Beckett, Appendix VII.Lancashire Record Office, Handlist 72Army Lists. Its drill hall, built in 1861 and known as Mill Street Barracks, was at the corner of Volunteer street and Mill Street, St Helens.St Helens, Mill Street barracks at Great War Centenary Drill Halls.'TA meeting place restored to former glory', Liverpool Echo, 1 July 2013. The 48th Lancashire RVC was a single company unit formed at Prescot under Captain Walter Wren Driffield on 15 March 1860. The two units were combined on 19 October 1880 under the Childers Reforms as the 21st Lancashire RVC (the original 21st (Wigan) Lancashire RVC having merged into another unit). The new unit had an establishment of eight companies and a uniform of Rifle green with scarlet facings. On 1 July 1881 it became a Volunteer Battalion (VB) of the Prince of Wales's Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment) and on 1 July 1886 it was designated the 2nd VB. Under the mobilisation scheme introduced by the Stanhope Memorandum of 1888, it formed part of the Mersey Volunteer Infantry Brigade, later the Cheshire and Lancashire Brigade, and then the Lancashire Brigade from 1900. South Africa In January 1900, the 2nd VB, commanded by Col W.W. Pilkington, offered to send volunteers to reinforce the 1st Battalion South Lancashires fighting in the 2nd Boer War. Between them the two Volunteer battalions raised a service company which, after a short period training at Orford Barracks, Warrington, was sent out and joined the Regulars at Ladysmith on 29 March 1900. It took part in the all the 1st Bn's operations up to the occupation of Vryheid, and then went back to Ladysmith for garrison duties until it returned to England in May 1901. It was followed by three further contingents to serve with the 1st Bn, as well as numerous individuals from the Volunteer battalion serving with the Imperial Yeomanry, the Mounted Infantry, the South African Constabulary and various non-combatant corps.Mullaly, pp. 146–7. The battalion was subsequently awarded its first Battle honour: 'South Africa 1900–01'. Territorial Force On the formation of the Territorial Force (TF) under the Haldane Reforms in 1908, the 2nd VB became the 5th Battalion of the South Lancashires, forming part of the South Lancashire Brigade in the West Lancashire Division of the TF.James, p. 81.Becke, Pt 2a, pp. 133–9. World War I =Mobilisation= The West Lancashire Division had just begun its annual training when war broke out on 4 August 1914. The units immediately returned to their drill halls to mobilise for war, and the bulk of them volunteered for overseas service. The 5th Bn went to its war station at Edinburgh, moving in October to Tunbridge Wells. On 31 August 1914, the formation of Reserve or 2nd-Line units for each existing TF unit was authorised. Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. These were designated by a '2/' prefix to distinguish them from their 1st-Line parent unit (prefixed '1/'). Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right and 3rd-Line battalions were created to train reserves.Becke, Pt 2b, pp. 1–7. =1/5th Battalion= During the winter of 1914-15 the battalions of the West Lancashire Division began to be sent to reinforce the Regulars of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) fighting in France. The 1/5th Battalion South Lancashires, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel L.E. Pilkington, disembarked at Le Havre on 13 February 1915 and joined 12th Brigade in 4th Division for instruction in Trench warfare.Becke, Pt 1, pp. 57–63.Mullaly, p. 177. The sector occupied by 12th Bde was one of the worst on the BEF's front, with the water table so high that trenches could not be used and defences consisted of breastworks. The battalion was also employed in mining, and won four Distinguished Conduct Medals (DCMs) for gallantry during these operations.Mullaly, p. 180. 2nd Ypres The 4th Division was engaged in the 2nd Battle of Ypres from 28 April to 25 May 1915, including the Battles of St Julien, Frezenberg Ridge and Bellewaarde Ridge. The 1/5th Bn marched up on 28 April as 12th Bde took up positions at Turco Farm alongside French troops. At midday on 2 May the Germans began a heavy bombardment of 4th Division's front, and then at 16.00 released a heavy concentration of chlorine gas and attacked. 1/5th Battalion was in reserve, and sent up 'A' Company, commanded by Captain Guy Pilkington, to help. Charging through the gas cloud, 'A' Company reached the front line trenches in time to help repel the attack. The British line south of St Julien had given way, so the following day the 1/5th Bn, less 'A' Company, took up new positions around Shell Trap Farm while the Germans consolidated. About 17.00 on 5 May the battalion's positions received a violent bombardment, which caused many casualties and collapsed most of the parapets. Company Sergeant-Major F. Smith won a DCM for rescuing seven men who had been buried. This fire continued until midnight, during which the battalion repulsed four small attacks. During the night the battalion was reinforced by 'A' Company, and was relieved the following night.Mullaly, pp. 180–1. Over the next few days the battalion frequently moved up to reinforce or support the line as German attacks continued, until it was relieved on 16 May. The 1/5h Bn was back in the line on 22 May, and two days later the Germans released the heaviest concentration of gas yet encountered, followed by an infantry attack. The situation quickly became critical, and the battalion sent up 'B' and 'C' Companies under Major W.N. Pilkington to hold the line near Shell Trap Farm to connect with the French while the rest moved into 4th Division's support line. The two companies suffered heavy casualties under shell fire, and at one time there as a gap of 1500 yards between them and the French flank. Contact with the French was restored with great difficulty, and during the night 4th Division fell back to the support line, and the South Lancashires had to improve the positions while keeping the enemy at bay with snipers and bombing parties. Fighting died down on 25 May, ending the battle.Mullaly, pp. 182–3. Lieutenant-Colonel L.E. Pilkington was later awarded a CMG, and Major W.N. Pilkington a DSO for their work in the Ypres Salient.Mullaly, p. 190. In August 1915 the 4th Division left the Salient and took over a new sector of the line north of Albert, Somme. On 4 November 1915 the experienced 12th Brigade was transferred to help train the newly arrived 36th (Ulster) Division.Becke, Pt 3b, pp. 61–9.Mullaly, p. 186. At the beginning of 1916 the West Lancashire Division, redesignated 55th (West Lancashire) Division, was reconstituted in France, and 1/5th South Lancashires rejoined it on 6 January, taking its place in 166th (South Lancashire) Brigade and holding a quiet sector south of Arras. Somme The 55th Division entered the Somme sector in August 1916, occupying part of the line around Fricourt,Mullaly, p. 213. and later took part in the following battles of the Somme offensive: Guillemont, Ginchy, Flers-Courcelette and Morval. The High Street of Guillemont in September 1916. The 166th Bde was in reserve for the start of 55th Division's attack on Guillemont, but continued the attack on 9 August, with 1/5th Bn in support. 166th Bde's attackers became entangled with the troops who had made the previous attack, and 1/5th Bn's supporting companies became hopelessly mixed up with them under shellfire. Later that day it was pushed forward to consolidate a new position in front of Trônes Wood. On 13 August, 'D' company took part in a minor operation against an isolated trench, but the adjacent French attack failed, and the operation was unsuccessful. When the battalion was relieved on 15 August, it had suffered over 80 casualties for no advantage.Mullaly, pp. 213–4. Delville Wood in September 1916. 55th Division returned to the line in front of Delville Wood on 4 September, where 1/5th Bn was kept busy digging communication trenches and strongpoints. On 8 September an attack by a neighbouring brigade elicited a violent counter-attack that almost broke through the battalion's barricade near Delville Wood. It spent the night building new strongpoints in front of its line, and when it withdrew it had suffered another 160 casualties. When it went back into the line it occupied trenches that had already been taken in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, nor was 1/5th Bn involved in 55th Division's actions in the Battle of Morval. The division let the Somme sector at the end of September.Mullaly, pp. 217–8. 3rd Ypres British wounded at the Battle of Pilckem Ridge The 55th Division took part in the Battle of Pilckem Ridge, the opening phase of the 3rd Battle of Ypres, on 31 July 1917. The 1/5th Bn had been withdrawn from the line for training during June, and moved up to its assembly position on 30 July. Its role in the attack was to support the attack by the leading battalions, passing through to take the second objective on the 'Black Line'. The leading wave went over the top at 03.50, and the 1/5th advanced at 05.05. As it advanced towards the Black Line the firing became heavier and the platoons advanced by short rushes until they got to within 200 yards of the objective. Here they were checked until two tanks came up and allowed the battalion to resume its advance and clear the enemy dug-outs. Despite harassing fire and bombardment the battalion consolidated its position in Capricorn Trench, which was the most advanced reached by the British on that depressing day. Although 55th Division's casualties were unusually high, 1/5th Bn suffered moderately, with 28 killed, 138 wounded and 12 missing. After holding Capricon Trench through torrents of rain and consequent mud, it was taken out of the line on 4 August.Mullaly, pp. 257–8.Wolff, p. 159. The Menin Road. The battalion returned to the same sector in September and was in reserve when 55th Division attacked Gravenstafel Ridge in the Battle of the Menin Road Ridge in 20 September. About mid-day, the 1/5th was ordered to send up 'B' and 'C' Companies to continue the attack on Hill 37, which was holding out. The two companies advanced by rushes and took the position. Not knowing of this success, the rest of the battalion was ordered up to take Hill 37 and Gallipoli Copse. Finding Hill 37 already in their hands, the rest of the 1/5th carried on the capture Gallipoli Copse and consolidate before the expected German counter-attack. Assisted by heavy artillery fire, this nearly succeeded, and the situation for 1/5th Bn became precarious, with both flanks in the air and ammunition running out, but it held its positions until nightfall, when the rest of 55th Division was able to link up from either flank. There was a further counter-attack the following day, which the battalion repulsed with heavy casualties. Its own casualties when relieved on 22 September had been comparatively light given the severity of the fighting: 27 killed and 143 wounded.Mullaly, pp. 262–3. Cambrai In November the 55th Division was switched to the Cambrai sector, where it made a feint attack on the southern flank of the main assault (the Battle of Cambrai). 1/5th Battalion was not involved in this operation, but on 26 November it had to take over an extended front (over 2500 yards) held with a series of platoon posts. Two days later there was an increase in German artillery fire and it was obvious that an attack was imminent. The divisional commander, Major-General Hugh Jeudwine, visited the battalion at midnight on 29 November and urged the men to 'Stand or fall at your posts'. When the attack came through the morning fog, with a bombardment of extreme intensity followed by ground attacks by the Richthofen 'Circus', the battalion was overwhelmed. While massed German infantry attacked its position, a 'box barrage' isolated the battalion and its headquarters, which were then surrounded and all survivors were captured. Its strength that morning had been 21 officers and 540 other ranks, and all that remained were a handful of officers and men left behind at the transport lines. These took part in the fighting the following day and were then withdrawn.Mullaly, pp. 268–3, 272.Cooper, p. 174. Defence of Givenchy All officers and men absent on leave or on courses were recalled, and 1/5th Battalion began to be recreated on 8 January 1918, when a draft of 300 men from England joined the survivors. A further 100 men came from the 2/5th Bn on 1 February when that unit was disbanded (see below) and the battalion resumed duties in the trenches near Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée at the end of March.Mullaly, pp. 272, 277. 55th Division was involved in the Battle of the Lys, the second phase of the German Spring Offensive in 1918. When the attack opened on 9 April, the division held Givenchy, with 1/5th Battalion protecting the division's flank on the La Bassée Canal. It had 'A' and 'C' Companies under Major W.N. Pilkington at Loisne Chateau under 165th (Liverpool) Brigade and the other two at Le Preol under 164th (North Lancashire) Brigade. The battalion was heavily engaged by early afternoon, but the front held firm. The following day the attacks continued, being particularly heavy at Loisne, which was held by 'C' Company and the Liverpool Scottish. There the first German onrush nearly succeeded in breaking through, but the position was partially restored by 'A' Company, and the enemy's attention switched to trying to cross the canal. In the evening of 11 April the Germans made another attempt to gain a foothold in the Loisne sector, but Maj W.N. Pilkington led an immediate counter-attack that killed large numbers of the enemy and took several prisoners. Major Pilkington was awarded a bar to the DSO he had won in 1915.Mullaly, pp. 296–8. Hundred Days Offensive Staff of the 1/5th Battalion, South Lancashires, near Bethune 5 September 1918. After the fighting died down, Givenchy became a quiet sector, and the 55th Division remained there until the end of August when the Allied counter-offensive began, and the division captured the craters near Givenchy.Mullaly, pp. 307, 313. On 20 September the 1/5th Bn was given responsibility for taking some objectives just north of La Bassée. The battalion attacked with 'B' Company on the right, and 'D' Company with a section of 'C' company on the left, while 'A' Company protected the right flank and the rest of 'C' Company was in reserve. The 'smart little action' was entirely successful, and 'was noteworthy as an example of platoon tactics and the resolute and resourceful leadership of the junior leaders', a number of whom were awarded medals.Mullaly, pp. 318–20. Men of the 55th (West Lancashire) Division cross a pontoon bridge over the Scheldt at Tournai, 9 November 1918. On 2 October the Germans began a large-scale withdrawal followed up by 55th Division to Tournai and the River Scheldt, which the enemy held in strength. On 22 October the 1/5th Bn attacked Barges Chateau and mill about 1,000 yards in front of its position, but although it reached the objective it could not hold it.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 419–21. The BEF made no serious attempt to force Tournai or the Scheldt, but continued active patrolling and raids, in which 1/5th Bn was prominent.Edmonds & Maxwell- Hyslop, pp. 538. On 8 November, as the Germans withdrew further, Lieutenant H.R. Fright led his platoon in a 'gallant effort to prevent a bridge being blown up by the enemy, in the course of which nearly the whole platoon became casualties'. Lieutenant Fright was awarded the Military Cross. That night a company of the battalion crossed the river by means of a light bridge and secured a foothold for the rest of the battalion to cross in the morning.Edmonds & Maxwell-Hyslop, pp. 541. The battalion was at Moulbaix on 11 November when news of the Armistice with Germany was received. It later moved to Brussels, where it stayed until demobilisation began in 1919. 1/5th South Lancashires was formally disembodied on 14 November 1919. =2/5th Battalion= The 2/5th Battalion formed at St Helens in September 1914 and began training round Blackpool in November. When the 1/5th Bn went to France in February 1915, the 2/5th replaced it in the West Lancashire Division, now composed almost entirely of 2nd-Line units. The 2/5th Bn continued its training round Tunbridge Wells, sending drafts to the 1/5th Bn as required. In August, the Division officially became the 57th (2nd West Lancashire) Division, the 2/5th Bn taking its place in 172nd (2/1st South Lancashire) Brigade. There was a shortage of weapons and equipment, and the men were issued with .256-in Japanese Ariska rifles with which to train. Only in the second half of November 1915 did the infantry of the division receive Lee- Enfield service rifles, and these were in poor condition. They were issued with Lewis guns towards the end of February 1916, by which time the battalions were about 800 strong.Mullaly, p. 246. Until the middle of 1916, the 57th Division formed part of Second Army in Central Force, quartered around Canterbury, Maidstone and Ashford. In June it was transferred to the Emergency Reserve and moved to Aldershot Command, with 2/5th Bn at Mytchett, then from October at Blackdown Camp. The division crossed to France and the battalion disembarked at Le Havre on 20 February 1917. The division joined II ANZAC Corps, taking over part of the line in the Bois Grenier sector. During April and May the 2/5th Bn was engaged in mutual raiding with the Germans opposite. The 57th Division carried out diversionary activities on 28 October for the Second Battle of Passchendaele near the end of the 3rd Ypres offensive, but was stooped in its tracks by mud.Mullaly, pp. 246, 249–50. The battalion was broken up at Steenwerck on 25 February 1918, and its men were distributed to the 2/4th South Lancashires and 57th Machine Gun Battalion in 57th Division, 1/5th South Lancashires in 55th Division (see above), and 2nd Entrenching Battalion.Mullaly, p. 274. =3/5th Battalion= Once 2/5th Battalion had joined the West Lancashire Division, the 3/5th Bn was formed at St Helens on 20 April 1915 as a reserve unit to supply drafts to the other two battalions. It moved to Blackpool in the autumn, and then to Oswestry in early 1916. On 8 April 1916 it was redesignated the 5th Reserve Battalion, and on 1 September it was absorbed into the 4th Reserve Bn.South Lancashires at Long, Long Trail. Interwar When the TF was reconstituted on 7 February 1920 the 5th Battalion Prince of Wales's Volunteers (South Lancashire Regiment) was reformed at St Helens, with Lt-Col W.N. Pilkington, DSO and Bar, in command and Maj Guy Pilkington, DSO, as second-in-command. Once again it was in 166th (South Lancashire and Cheshire) Brigade of 55th (West Lancashire) Division in the retitled Territorial Army (TA).Mullaly, p. 358.Titles and Designations. 90 cm 'Projector Anti-Aircraft', displayed at Fort Nelson, Portsmouth. In the 1930s the increasing need for anti-aircraft (AA) defence for Britain's cities was addressed by converting a number of TA infantry battalions into searchlight (S/L) regiments. The 5th South Lancashires was one unit selected for this role, becoming 61st (5th Bn The South Lancashire Regiment (The Prince of Wales's Volunteers)) Searchlight Regiment in 1938.Frederick, pp. 860–1, 870.Monthly Army List, January 1938.Litchfield, pp. 133–4.Mullaly, p. 376. It consisted of HQ and three S/L batteries (432, 433 and 434), and was attached to the Royal Artillery while remaining part of the South Lancashire Regiment.Monthly Army List May 1939.AA Command 3 September 1939 at Patriot Files.61 S/L at RA 39–45. World War II =Mobilisation= In February 1939, Britain's AA defences came under the control of a new Anti-Aircraft Command. In June a partial mobilisation of TA units was begun in a process known as 'couverture', whereby each AA unit did a month's tour of duty in rotation to man selected AA and searchlight positions. On 24 August, ahead of the declaration of war, AA Command was fully mobilised at its war stations.Routledge, pp. 65–6, 371. On the outbreak of war, 61st S/L Regt was assigned to a newly organised 54th AA Brigade in 4th AA Division, which was responsible for the North West and North Midlands of England and Wales. Routledge, Table LX, p. 378. =Orkney= The regiment was first employed manning AA light machine guns (LMGs) in the area of Runcorn and Widnes. In November 1939, one battery was detached to form part of the defences of the Royal Navy's anchorage at Scapa Flow in Orkney. The other two batteries followed in April 1940, and in addition to its AA role, the battalion was called upon to find two infantry companies for ground defence. On 1 August 1940, 61st S/L, in common with all the TA S/L units, was transferred fully to the RA.Farndale, Annex M, p. 340. =The Blitz= The 61st S/L Rgt returned to North West England in November 1940, when it joined the 1st AA Brigade (a Regular Army formation returned from Dunkirk) in a new 11th AA Division. 1st AA Brigade had responsibility for North Staffordshire, Cheshire and South Lancashire.Routledge, Table LXV, p. 396.Farndale, Annex D, p. 260. The regiment supplied a cadre of experienced officers and men to 234th S/L Training Rgt at Carlisle where it provided the basis for a new 528 S/L Bty formed on 14 November 1940. This battery later joined 86th S/L Rgt. At this time The Blitz was in full swing, with frequent night air raids on the industrial cities. The role of the S/L units was to track and illuminate raiders for the AA guns of the Gun Defence Areas and for the few available Royal Air Force Night fighters. New tactics included grouping the S/Ls in clusters, and later in 'killer belts' for the fighters and 'indicator belts' for the guns. In April and May 1941, Merseyside and the North Midlands were particularly badly bombed (the Liverpool Blitz).Routledge, pp. 389–99. Although operating within AA Command, during the Blitz, 1st AA Bde HQ remained part of the War Office Reserve, and later went to the Middle East.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/5. It had left AA Command by May 1941, and 61st S/L Rgt came under a new 68th AA Brigade, with which it remained until April 1944.Order of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non-Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA file WO 212/5.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, TNA file WO 212/79.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, TNA file WO 212/81.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, TNA file WO 212/82.Order of Battle of Non- Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 13 March 1943, TNA file WO 212/83.Order of Battle of AA Command, 1 August 1943, TNA file WO 212/84. =Operation Diver= 90 cm Searchlight equipped with No 2 Mk VI Searchlight Control Radar. 61st Searchlight Rgt remained in NW England until April 1944 when it moved to Kent, to join 27th (Home Counties) AA Bde.Order of Battle of AA Command, 27 April 1944, TNA file WO 212/85. The AA defences of South East England were being strengthened, firstly to protect the concentration of shipping and troops preparing for the invasion of Normandy (Operation Overlord), and secondly in anticipation of the arrival of German V-1 flying bombs. Searchlight Control Radar (SLC or 'Elsie') was important in allowing S/Ls to track these fast-moving unmanned aircraft. During the summer of 1944 61st S/L Rgt was engaged in Operation Diver against the V-1s crossing Kent on their way to London.Routledge, pp. 408–16. =North West Europe= By the end of 1944, the German Luftwaffe was suffering from such shortages of pilots, aircraft and fuel that serious aerial attacks on the United Kingdom could be discounted and the War Office began reorganising surplus anti- aircraft regiments in the UK into infantry battalions for duties in the rear areas. In November, 61st Searchlight Regiment was one of the units selected for conversion, and was redesignated 61st (The South Lancashire Regiment) Garrison Regiment, RA.Frederick, p. 879.61 Garrison Rgt at RA 39–45. Meanwhile, 21st Army Group fighting in North West Europe was suffering a severe manpower shortage, particularly among the infantry.Ellis, pp. 141–2. In January 1945, the War Office accelerated the conversion of surplus artillery into infantry units, primarily for line of communication and occupation duties, thereby releasing trained infantry for frontline service.Ellis, pp. 369, 380. 61st Garrison Regiment was redesignated again, becoming 612th (The South Lancashire Regiment) Infantry Regiment, RA in February.Frederick, p. 881.612 Rgt at RA 39–45. In April 1945 it crossed to France, where it was attached to 1st Czechoslovak Armoured Brigade and was present at the surrender of the German garrison of Dunkirk. On 8 May (VE Day) it joined 306th Infantry Brigade (previously 55th Light AA Bde) and moved into Germany for occupation duties until it passed into suspended animation in October 1945.Josen, p. 402. Postwar AA Command's formation sign. When the TA was reconstituted on 1 January 1947, the regiment reformed at St Helens with a new role as 596th Light AA Regiment, RA (The South Lancashire Regiment). It formed part of 59 AA Bde (the former 33rd (Western) AA Bde based in Liverpool).Frederick, p. 1025.Litchfield, Appendix 5.592–638 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.AA Bdes 30–66 at British Army 1945 on.Watson, TA 1947. In March 1955 AA Command was disbanded, and there was a considerable reduction in the number of TA AA units. As part of this reorganisation, 596 LAA Rgt merged with 644 LAA Rgt, which had been formed at Warrington in 1947 by conversion of 2/4th Bn South Lancashires.638–677 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on. Together, they constituted 436 (South Lancashire Artillery) Light AA Regiment, RA, in 2nd Army Group Royal Artillery (AA). 596 Regiment formed P and Q Btys, and 644 Rgt provided R Bty; RHQ remained at Mill St, St Helens.Frederick, p. 1013.414–443 Rgts RA at British Army 1945 on.Routledge, Table LXXV, p. 442.AGRAs at British Army 1945 onwards. In 1961 the regiment absorbed Q Bty from 253 Field Regiment (The Bolton Artillery), which became Q/436 Bty, and in 1964 the regiment was redesignated as a Light Air Defence regiment. When the TA was reorganised as the TAVR in 1967, the regiment was merged into The South Lancashire Territorials (PWV), RA, with 436 LAD Rgt finding RHQ, P and Q (South Lancashire Artillery) Btys, while R (South Lancashire Regiment) Bty came from the 4th Bn South Lancashires. However, in 1969 this unit was reduced to a cadre attached to 103 (Lancashire Artillery Volunteers) Rgt, RA.Frederick, p. 1043. In 1973 the cadre was expanded again to form 213 (South Lancashire Artillery) Air Defence Battery in the 103rd. In 1992 the battery merged with the regiment's HQ battery, which was moved to Jubilee Barracks, St Helens. The 103rd Rgt remains part of the Army Reserve.103 Rgt RA at British Army website. Insignia When the battalion was attached to the Royal Artillery in 1938, each battery was authorised to wear the Prince of Wales's feathers badge of the South Lancashires as an arm badge. This was embroidered in white on a coloured backing: salmon buff for 432nd Bty, maroon for 433rd Bty and dark blue for 434th Bty, these being the regimental colours of the South Lancs. After World War II, 596 LAA Rgt wore an arm badge consisting of a rectangle divided vertically into three equal bands, in dark blue, gold and maroon. Honorary Colonels The following officers served as Honorary Colonel of the battalion: * Sir David Gamble, 1st Baronet, CB, VD, original CO of the 48th Lancashire RVC, appointed 17 December 1887. * William W. Pilkington, VD, CO of the 2nd Volunteer Battalion from 17 December 1887, appointed 4 March 1907. * R.W.H. Thomas, VD, appointed 29 April 1922. * L.E. Pilkington, CMG, TD, CO of the 5th Battalion from 9 November 1912 to April 1916, appointed 21 March 1934. Battle honours The 2nd Volunteer Battalion was awarded 'South Africa 1900–01'. During World War I, the 1/5th and 2/5th Battalions contributed to the honours of the South Lancashire, including 'St Julien', 'Bellewaarde', and 'Ypres 1915', 'Guillemont', 'Ginchy' and 'Somme 1916', 'Pilckem', 'Menin Road', 'Passchendaele' and 'Cambrai 1917'. Units of the Royal Artillery are not awarded Battle honours, so none were received for World War II. Notes References * Maj A.F.

Sapundu is the sacrificial pole of the Dayak Ngaju people of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The sacrificial pole is usually carved into a human figure or an animal figure. The sapundu is an integral part of the Tiwah dead festival, where animals are tied to it to be sacrificed. Form Sapundus are traditionally made of ironwood, although today a lighter more common wood are increasingly being used. It is usually about 1.5 - 3 meter height, and has a diameter of between 15-25 cm. Sapundus are carved into different figures e.g. a man or a woman, or sometimes of animals. A sapundu represent a figure that would escort the soul of the dead into the paradise during the tiwah. The type of figures represented by the sapundu is usually a figure that is deemed appropriate to accompany the deceased during their final journey into the paradise. For example, if the deceased was a female, a sacrificial post representing a man is usually prepared for her tiwah, and vice versa. Contemporary sapundu can be very creative. For example, there is a sapundu depicting a young woman in blue jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt wearing a Sony Walkman. Some sapundus contain English inscriptions, e.g. \\"Tiwah Party\\" or \\"God Save Our Soul\\". Notches inscribed onto the post are intended to serve as reminders to the souls of the animals, rice, and other goods donated by survivors to ensure the deceased's comfort in the afterlife. The following are different kind of sapundu figures found in the Dayak villages along the Kahayan, Central Kalimantan: *Sapundu hatue (\\"male sapundu\\") is shaped like a man, usually a ritual specialist, carrying a traditional iron dagger (duhung). *Sapundu bawi (\\"female sapundu\\") is shaped like a woman, usually carrying materials used in preparing betel leaves for chewing. *Sapundu embak bakas resembles a man carrying a container of uncooked rice around his neck. *Sapundu sambali resembles various types of animals, e.g. a male tiger, a dog, or a crocodile. *Sapundu haramaung is shaped like a female tiger carrying a snake in her mouth. *Sapundu rahu nyampang depicts two persons, husband and wife. Many sapundus are set in front of house courtyard, such as those found in the villages of Central Kalimantan. Some sapundus are kept in Belanga Museum, Palangkaraya, to simulate the tiwah festival; this sapundus are donated by the villagers and are purified accordingly following the traditional rite. Tiwah festival On the fifth day of the Tiwah festival, buffaloes, pigs or cows are tied to a sapundu to be sacrificed. One animal is tied onto one sapundu. The timing of the killing of the animal is adjusted with the intended length of the Tiwah ceremony; if only one buffalo is to be killed, usually the killing is done one day before the exhumation of the deceased. Multiple animals may require several days or it can be done all at once in one single day. The animal is tied onto the tiwah using a 10-20 meter tree root. A male animal should be tied to a female- gendered sapundu, vice versa. All villagers are allowed to kill the livestock by spearing on them. The blood of the sacrificed livestock will be used to purify various items for the Tiwah, e.g. the sandung bone ossuary. The meat will be give to those performing the killing of the livestock following a strict rule.

It was founded in January 2011 by Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, who had previously developed Grounded (2009) while studying video game design. Notable games developed by the studio include The Last Tinker: City of Colors (2014), Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun (2016), and Desperados III (2020). As of January 2020, Mimimi Games employs 30 people.  History  Mimimi Games began as a co-operation between Dominik Abé and Johannes Roth, video game design students at the in Munich. In October 2008, they began working together under the name \\"Mimimi\\" and developed their first game, Grounded, which was released in November 2009. The game got second place in the \\"Gamesload Newcommer Awards\\" at the 2009 German Developer Innovation Prize and was nominated in the \\"Best Concept from a Student Competition\\" category for the 2010 Deutscher Computerspielpreis ceremony. Following Groundeds release, the team began working in the Unity game engine to create a game, later titled daWindci, in which the player would control the weather to direct a hot air balloon to a destination. A prototype for personal computers was shown at Gamescom 2010, where it received positive reception. However, its mouse-based input system was perceived as an obstacle and the studio was advised to bring the game to mobile devices instead. Planning to develop it for iPad devices, the team found that it would need approximately to acquired the needed hardware and software, which they could not finance themselves. They thus turned to developer Reality Twist, which agreed to publish the game and Mimimi hired Florian Smolka and Lucas Reiner as artists to overhaul the game's style. On 13 January 2011, Abé and Roth founded Mimimi Productions GbR, and daWindci was released on 14 April that year. Mimimi Productions was incorporated anew as Mimimi Productions UG in January 2012.

He allied with the Sanusi, powerful traders of the eastern Sahara, and with the Sultan of Darfur to resist French aggression in the eastern Sahel, but was defeated. His sultanate was incorporated in the French military territory of Chad. Early years Muhammad Salih bin Yusuf, Dud Murra, was the son of Yusuf ibn Muhammad Sharif, who ruled Wadai from his capital of Abéché (Abeshr) from 1874 to 1898. Yusuf's reign was a period of prosperity and stability. In 1898 a force of Anglo-Egyptian troops reconquered the Sudan and defeated the Mahdist forces at Omdurman, near Khartoum. They reestablished the sultanate of Darfur to the east of Wadai under Ali Dinar, a relatively effective ruler. When the Kolak Yusuf of Wadai died in 1898 there was a struggle for the succession in which Dud Murra was the candidate of the Sanusi. However, Ahmad al-Ghazali, sponsored by Ali Dinar, gained the throne. In November 1901 Dud Murra deposed Ahmed al-Ghazali with the aid of the Sanusi. Muhammad al-Mahdi as-Senussi, the Sanusi leader, died in January 1902, but the Sanusi remained strong in their base of Kufra, midway between Al-Fasher in Darfur and the Mediterranean. Ahmed al-Ghazali was captured in June 1902, blinded and then executed, making Dud Murra the undisputed ruler. Dud Murra rewarded the Sanusiyya by letting them trade freely. It was said of him, \\"If a merchant is killed the Sultan is sure to revenge him, and should the merchant kill a native the Sultan himself would pay the blood money\\". Early in his reign Muhammad Salih Dud Murra had to deal with French aggression from the west. The French had defeated and killed the Sudanese warlord Rabih az-Zubayr, who had taken control of the former Bornu Empire in the west of the Lake Chad region, in the Battle of Kousséri on 22 April 1900. The French were now advancing eastward. Their goal was to defeat the Sanusiya, powerful traders in the eastern Sahara, and to replace local rulers who opposed them with puppets. The French expanded their military camel corps and launched attacks on the Sanusi zawaya posts. Loss of Abéché Wadai sultanate east of Lake Chad around 1890, from an American map In 1906 the French initiated hostilities against Wadai. The ruler of Dar Sila took advantage of the situation to encroach on the Wadai monopoly of ivory from Dar Kibet. This almost led to war between Dar Sila and Wadai. The French advanced eastward methodically, setting up fortified posts along their route, and were within of Abéché by 1907. In 1908 there were two battles between the forces of Wadai and the French led by Captain Jérusalemy, one on 29 May at Dokotchi and the other on 16 June at Djoua in which the governors of the Wadai provinces of Mahamid and Debaba were killed. In 1908 the French claimed the sultanates of Dar Tama and Dar Masalit as part of Wadai, and tried to establish friendly relations with the sultanate of Dar Gimr. Captain Jean-Joseph Fiegenschuh entered Abéché on 12 June 1909 with a force of 180 men and two cannons. The next day he proclaimed that Wadai was a French territory. The French installed Dud Murra's cousin Adam Asil as puppet sultan. Asil had fled from Abéché because Dud Murra meant to blind him in punishment for an attempted coup. The French began to subjugate the Wadai vassal states. The Daju Sultan of Dar Sila sent a letter to Fort Lamy offering his submission directly, in a move to break loose from Wadai. He did this before paying homage to the puppet king Adam Asil and before being visited at his capital of Goz Beida by a French lieutenant. Despite this, the French treated Dar Sila as a Wadai dependency. Further struggles with the French Dud Murra moved north to Kapka, where he spent the next ten months gathering a force of loyal subjects and Sanusi allies. The Sanusi gave him their full support. The French made an \\"inspection tour\\" into Dar Masalit where they were opposed by the combined followers of Sultan Taj ad-Din of Masalit and of Dud Murra. On 4 January 1910 Fiegenschuh and his force were massacred at Wadi Kadja in Dar Massalit That year Ali Dinar, Dud Murra and Sultan Taj el-Din of Dar Masalit invaded Dar Tama and Dar Gimr and replaced the French puppet rulers with their own. Ali Dinar was less than wholehearted in supporting Dud Murra, but by April 1910 Dud Murra and Ali Dinar both had powerful armies and planned to act together to defeat the French. However, Ali Dinar was defeated on 7 April 1910 and Dud Murra was defeated on 19 April 1910 in separate battles.The submission of Dud Murra on a French newspaper Dud Murra retreated south into Dar Masalit after his defeat at Kapka, and many refugees from Wadai fled to Darfur. The French mounted punitive expeditions and put down a major rebellion in the east of Wadai. Commander Joseph Édouard Maillard, head of the Chad Territory forces, advanced with 300 men into Massalit. On 8 November 1910 5,000 of Dud Murra's cavalry and troops of Sultan Tadj ed-Din surrounded and defeated Maillard at Dorothe. The French called on Colonel Victor Emmanuel Largeau, who had commanded in Chad in 1902–04, to retrieve the situation. In January 1911 the French invaded Dar Masalit, where they won several battles and destroyed Darjil, the capital. Ali Dinar took advantage of this distraction to raid and loot Dar Tama. Dud Murra advanced towards Abéché with an escort from Masalit, but was defeated by the French at Shekoiung, two days away. He returned to Endoka's base at Mugurni. Afraid that the French would invade Dar Masalit again, the sultan Endoka, son of Abbakr, expelled Dud Murra. Dud Murra surrendered to the French in October 1911. Asil was dethroned by the French in 1911 after a major revolt in Wadai in which he was suspected of conspiracy. The French placed the region under direct colonial rule. Dud Murra was exiled. A 1924 report said that Dud Murra was then a political prisoner at large in Fort-Lamy, and was receiving a French government pension.

Jack Skelly was born to American parents of Irish descent in the Dominican Republic. The family moved to Cuba a year later where his father, George Martin Skelly, was head of the railroad department for the United Fruit Sugar Co. He spent his formative years in the town of Banes where Castro’s first wife, Mirta Diaz-Balart, was a neighbor, close childhood friend, and later a mutual teenage crush. Skelly was in Cuba on assignment for United Press when the Batista regime collapsed and Fidel Castro came to power in January, 1959. He was at the home of the then ex-Mrs. Castro watching on television as Fidel rode triumphantly into Havana on a Sherman tank. He recalled Mirta telling him, “If he’s as good a leader as he was a father and husband, poor Cuba.” Castro, who was unprepared to handle the glare of the international media spotlight, noticed Skelly, whom he had met ten years earlier through Diaz-Balart, in the incomprehensible scrum of English-speaking reporters and requested his help. Skelly assisted with translations and subsequently resigned his position at United Press to handle international press relations for Castro. He was at the comandante's side for the January 11, 1959, appearance on Face the Nation from Havana, quietly translating some of the questions and answers, which Castro provides in struggling English. Skelly, initially hopeful that the new government would usher in an era of democratic reforms, quickly grew disillusioned with course the revolution had taken and left the island permanently, becoming a harsh critic of the Castro regime. Jack Skelly attended high school at Mt. St. Joseph’s High School in Baltimore, Maryland, followed by a two-year stint the Army where he was stationed in Austria and Germany. He then attended George Washington University where he obtained a degree in journalism. He married Lucy Alexander Freeman in 1953, with whom he was to father seven children. Skelly’s thorough grounding in the languages and cultures of the United States and Latin America, much less common during the years that spanned his career than it has become in more recent years, along with his skills as a writer and interviewer, made him uniquely qualified to report and comment on the political upheaval that roiled Latin America during those decades. He referred to himself as an “American Cuban,” or one of the more generic “bamboo Americans”, children born of American parents who grew up in Latin America. In addition to his distinguished career as a reporter he served as advisor and speech writer for U.S. presidents of both political parties who sought his insights and assistance in delicate matters concerning intelligence operations and international relations. At various times during his career, Skelly was a correspondent for the now defunct Washington Star, a publicist for the Pan American Coffee Bureau, and a special assistant to two Organization of American States secretaries general. He was also Washington Bureau Chief for Puerto Rico’s largest newspaper, El Nuevo Dia.\\"Processing Modernity: Social and Cultural Adaptation in Eastern Cuba, 1902–1933” ~ PhD dissertation by Joshua Henry Nadel, UNC Chapel Hill, 2007Insight on the News, February 14, 2000, \\"How Fidel Snatched Fidelito from Mirta\\"Skelly, Jack, I Remember Cuba: A Memoir of a Town Called Banes, 2006, BookStand PublishingWashington Times, August 12, 2006, \\"Fidel at 80\\"Miami Herald, June 9, 2015, \\"After fleeing Fidel, newsman ready to return to Cuba\\" References  1927 births 2016 deaths American male journalists Columbian College of Arts and Sciences alumni ","title":"John T.

Background The December Crisis is described as the only occasion when the king himself attempted to assert his power; previous attempts had always been staged by his queen, Louisa Ulrika of Prussia. In 1767, French envoy Louis Auguste Le Tonnelier de Breteuil suggested a coup to increase royal power to the Hovpartiet. Crisis In December 1768, the king refused to sign state documents in protest to his limited power and on 15 December, the king formally resigned his throne in order to bring about the gathering of a new Riksdag, during which a reform to increase his capacity could be introduced. This created a difficult political situation, as he had thereby technically abdicated and the nation was in interregnum. The Hovpartiet suggested that the crisis could be used to stage a coup to establish absolute monarchy. The queen opposed because she did not consider the time right for such a step and advocated negotiation with the Hats (party) and the Caps (party), but at this point, the Hovpartiet for the first time turned to the Crown Prince rather than the queen; however, the crisis could not be used for a coup because the Caps party broke an agreement. Results On 20 December the government agreed to assemble the Riksdag and promised new reforms, and the king thereby agreed to retake the throne, and thereby, the crisis was averted and the government could function again. The Riksdag was however not assembled until 1769, and it did not give the royal house more than an increased allowance.

Examples include breast cancer, which is dependent on estrogens like estradiol, and prostate cancer, which is dependent on androgens like testosterone. Hormones play important roles in our body, they're also effective in some types of cancer by promoting some tumors grow and spread, which are so-called hormone-sensitive or hormone-dependent cancer. A hormone-sensitive cancer, or hormone-dependent cancer, is a type of cancer that is dependent on a hormone for growth and/or survival. If a tumor is hormone-sensitive, it means that there are special proteins called receptors on cells surface. When the hormone bind the matched receptor, it results in growth and spread of cancer cells.  Mechanism of carcinogenesis  While tumor initiating event for hormone-related cancers can be varied, the promotion event and subsequent proliferation is driven by a sex hormone. Both endogenous and exogenous hormones, by driving cell proliferation, increased the number of cell divisions and the opportunity for random genetic errors to lead to cancer.  Hormone-sensitive cancer types  The main types of Hormone-sensitive cancers are the following. = Breast cancer = Breast cancer is often hormone responsive, since growth or regression of tumors can often be regulated by appropriate endocrine manipulations. Estrogen and progesterone seem to be main hormones involved in growth of breast cancer. = Ovarian cancer = Ovarian cancer can be affected by estrogen. β-estradiol (E2) can stimulate the growth of some estrogen receptor(ER)-positive ovarian carcinoma cells, and these effects may be related with changes in the cellular levels of steroid hormone receptors. = Uterine cancer = Uterine or endometrial cancer are activated by estrogen and progesterone are related to this type. The uterine endometrium is extraordinary sensitive to steroid hormones, observation that women who ovulate and produce progesterone have an extremely low possibility to get endometrial cancer proves progesterone as a critical inhibitor of carcinogenesis. = Prostate cancer = Prostate cancer is dependent on androgens like testosterone and similar hormones that can help it grow and spread.  Treatment  Treatments for hormone-sensitive-cancers include blocking the synthesis or action of the hormone or surgery to remove the organ that produces the hormone. Androgen deprivation therapy includes treatment with androgen receptor antagonists and/or surgical removal of the testes while estrogen deprivation therapy involves treatment with estrogen receptor antagonists and/or surgical removal of the ovaries. = Receptor antagonists = Antiandrogens or antiestrogen are used to block the binding of androgen and estrogen to their respective nuclear hormone receptors and thereby blocks the proliferative effects of these hormone on hormone dependent cancer. For example, the antiestrogen tamoxifen used for the treatment of breast cancer while the antiandrogen bicalutamide alone or in combination with castration is used to treat prostate cancer. Interruption of hormonal stimulus. For example, tamoxifen can slow the progression until actual hormone independence occurs in the pathway later. In more recent years, evidence in support of this cell proliferation model of hormone responsive cancer etiology has continued to accumulate. Anti-hormone therapies are proved to be effective in stopping progression and thereby increasing the time to recurrence or death. = Receptor agonists = Progesterone is regarded as the major endometrial tumor suppressor, = Synthesis inhibitors = Various agents that block key events in the synthesis of hormones are sometimes used to treat hormone dependent cancers. Aromatase inhibitors such as anastrozole block the synthesis of estrogen while CYP17A1 inhibitors such as abiraterone block the synthesis of androgen. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone antagonists blocks the signaling that stimulates androgen synthesis. = Surgery = As the growth of hormone dependent cancer is driven by sex hormones, surgical removal of the organs that synthesizes the sex hormone is sometimes performed. In the case of prostate cancer, orchiectomy (surgical castration) of the testes is sometimes performed while oophorectomy (surgical removal of the ovaries) is sometimes performed to prevent breast cancer in high risk women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.

Early life Julie Fisher was born on 17 February 1972 to Thomas Fisher, and was brought up in Sugar Grove, Illinois, as one of five siblings. She went on to study computer science at Indiana University. Fisher moved to London to work for an internet-based company, and was setting up a film school when she met Luke Montagu. She was a single mother at the time, and had assumed he was not interested in her. Three months after they began dating, she noticed that one of his payment cards had \\"Viscount Hinchingbrooke\\" written on it. Only then did he explain that he was a member of the aristocracy and his father was the current Earl of Sandwich. A year after they first met, they married at Mapperton House, Dorset, the country estate of the Earl of Sandwich. Career When Luke Montagu suffered years of side effects from being removed from prescription medication by an addiction clinic (and was later awarded £1.3 million in compensation), Julie Montagu began running yoga classes in nearby church halls in order to bring some money into the household. She also started a blog, called the \\"Flexi Foodie\\" and wrote a successful cookbook, Superfoods: The Flexible Approach to Eating More Superfoods & Superfoods Superfast. She founded the charity Council for Evidence-Based Psychiatry after Luke's recovery, based on their experiences. She was then offered a position on the reality television series Ladies of London as her husband was recovering. She later said of the series, \\"We thought long and hard before accepting as it offered financial support for a while. But it was not fun to do. I was expected to behave in a way I wasn't, like an It girl or socialite, when I'm not. They edit you... You have to go along with things or you get fired. But you know it was a job. I was acting.\\" She celebrated when it was cancelled after three seasons. In 2016, the couple took over the running of the Mapperton Estate. The series brought financial stability which allowed the couple to invest further in the Mapperton Estate, turning an old stable block into a wedding venue. Julie also opened her own school of yoga on the grounds, but continues to practice yoga elsewhere, headline an act at the Wanderlust yoga festival in Victoria Park, London. During the lead-up to the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Julie Montagu was interviewed on a number of occasions because she is a US citizen who married into British aristocracy; she was also an on-site commentator on the wedding for the BBC. She was also interviewed following such events as Markle's father selling a private letter his daughter had sent him, and the royal couple's break from the monarchy in 2020. In 2020, she began hosting a show on the Smithsonian Channel An American's Aristocrat's Guide to Great Estates. Personal life She is married to Luke Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke, and has four children, two of whom are from her first marriage and two with Luke. She supported her husband through his recovery from a dependency of prescription drugs and now campaigns for greater awareness of the issue.

It starts at Mo Mi intersection in the area of Bangkok's Chinatown in Samphanthawong District and ends at the junction with Sukhumvit Road in Khlong Toei District near Bangkok Port, (Khlong Toei Port).  History  A canal called Khlong Thanon Trong (คลองถนนตรง; Thanon Trong canal; literally 'straight road canal') originally defined the route of the current road. Around 1857 a parallel paved road was added. In 1919, Rama VI renamed Rama IV Road. In 1947 the canal was drained to make way for an extension of the road. The Paknam Railway, Thailand's first railway line, followed the route of Rama IV Road from 1893 until it closed in 1960 due to under-use and increased road traffic. Several flyovers were added in the 1980s and 1990s to improve traffic flow. The road is considered to be the first road in Thailand. It was built four years before Charoen Krung Road. Western merchants called on the Siamese government to build a new road. Waterways were then the main transport arteries in those days, but were much slower than overland. When first built, the road had no official name. Locals called it Thanon Trong (ถนนตรง; straight road) or Thanon Hua Lamphong (ถนนหัวลำโพง; 'Hua Lamphong Road'). The MRT Blue Line snakes underneath Rama IV Road between Hua Lamphong MRT Station and Queen Sirikit National Convention Center MRT Station. Bordering the road are the Hua Lamphong railway station, Wat Hua Lamphong, New Sam Yan Market, Lumphini Park and Rama VI Memorial Plaza, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thai- Japanese Friendship Flyover, and 3HD.

Located along United States Route 2 and Stowe Street south of Thatcher Branch of the Winooski River, the sprawling village has been shaped by changes in transportation in the 19th and 20th centuries, and by key economic developments such as the founding of the Vermont State Hospital, which anchors the village's southern end. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history Waterbury's early settlement took place about 1770, with the establishment of a small cluster of houses along the Winooski River near what is now Winooski Street. When Main Street, a stagecoach route paralleling the river opened in the 1790s, development moved to that area, including the construction of churches, residences, and businesses. Development also began along Stowe Street, running north from Main Street roughly along the eastern side of Thatcher Branch. Thatcher Branch was also amenable to the development of industry powered by its waters, whose early successes spurred further growth. In 1849, the railroad was built through the area, with the main depot located further south of the main business district. A cluster of commercial development took place in that area, and industries arose along the railroad corridor. Vermont State Hospital opened in 1892, spurring additional growth south of the station, which included development of Randall Street, paralleling Main Street, as a tree- lined residential enclave. with The historic district's main spine of Main Street (US 2), extending from its crossing of Thatcher Branch south just beyond the campus of the Vermont State Hospital (now mainly occupied by state offices, and separately listed on the National Register in 2016). The railroad line runs parallel to Main Street to the northeast, and the district includes Railroad Street and Union Street, which flank it on the other side. Connecting streets include Park Row, where the former train station is, and Stowe Street, where the densest part of the business district is located at the junction with Main Street. The district extends about half way along Winooski Street to the Winooski River, and along Randall Street between Elm Street and hospital complex.

Early life and education Isa Sedigh was born in June 1894 in Hammam Ghebleh, Tehran. His father, Mirza Abdollah Shamloo, also known as Abdollah Sedigh Al-Tojjar Isfahani, was a grandson of Mirza Mehdi Khan Astarabadi. Isa Sedigh finished his undergraduate education in Kamalieh School and Dar ul-Funun. After finishing school, he traveled to France with the first student expedition in 1911. In 1918, he completed his education in Versailles, Yvelines, receiving his bachelor's degree in mathematics from the University of Paris. In 1930, upon receiving an invitation to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, Sedigh went to United States and, after one year, received his doctorate in Philosophy. Career Isa Sedigh was a member of the Socialist Party. He worked in the University of Cambridge as an assistant teacher of professor Edward Granville Browne in Persian literature. After returning to France, he made Persian one of his foreign languages classes, which students could choose as their foreign language course. While Iran was under attack by the Russian empire, Sedigh wrote many related articles in The Times. He returned to Iran in 1918; just after his arrival, he was selected as inspector of schools. He worked as the head of the education organization of Gilan Province. Isa Sedigh served as chief of staff of the Ministry of Justice in Iran. In 1921, he received the title of Sedigh Alam from Ahmad Shah Qajar per Samad Khan Momtaz os-Saltaneh's request. He was a member of the Iranian constituent assembly when it officially began in 1921. When Ali-Akbar Davar founded the Radical party, Sedigh was selected as vice president. During his education at Columbia University, Abdolhossein Teymourtash asked Sedigh to plan the founding of a Dar ul-Funun (university) in Tehran. (Isa used the word Daneshgah (meaning a university) instead of Dar ul-Funun (meaning a complex institute for teaching various courses)) After returning to Iran in 1931, Reza Shah commanded him to found the University of Tehran. He was selected as minister of education in Mohammad Ali Foroughi's first cabinet on September 21, 1941. Two years later, he was selected again for this position in Ali Soheili's cabinet. Sedigh maintained this position in Morteza-Qoli Bayat's (November 25, 1944) and Ahmad Qavam's (September 11, 1947) cabinets.

In 1967, he won a Pulitzer Prize for National Affairs Reporting. Early life and education Penn was the son of Murray Penn and Lillian (Richman) Penn. He attended Brooklyn College and received a B.A. from the University of Missouri. Penn studied journalism at the latter institution, but later said, \\"Journalism school was largely a waste of time...If I started out again, I'd major in English, history, or philosophy.\\" Career Penn joined the Wall Street Journal in 1952, serving in its Chicago and Detroit bureaus between 1952 and 1957. He became an investigative reporter in that newspaper's New York bureau in 1957, and stayed there until 1990. He was praised in New York magazine as one of the few true investigative reporters in the U.S. Penn wrote exclusive articles about the financial dealings of Robert Vesco and Howard Hughes. He established that Vesco had clandestine financial ties to President José Figueres Ferrer of Costa Rica, and that Robert Wagner, the former mayor of New York City, had clandestine financial ties to \\"a questionable offshore real estate fund.\\" In 1964, he reported on ballot security. A statement by Penn in a 1966 article has been widely quoted in recent years as an example of faulty prognostication. \\"Despite the trend to compactness and lower costs,\\" wrote Penn, \\"it is unlikely everyone will have his own computer any time soon.\\" In 1969 and 1970 he reported on the Newark, New Jersey Mafia. Penn reported in 1971 on a lawsuit filed by Allen & Co., a New York investment bank, charging that Occidental Petroleum had cheated the bank \\"out of a share of oil concessions in Libya.\\" He quoted from a sworn deposition in which a former Libyan oil minister stated that \\"he had been close friends with a European promoter hired by Occidental and had kept in touch with him during the bidding on these concessions, with the result that two of the best concessions, worth hundreds of millions dollars, had gone to Occidental.\\" Penn also \\"found out that the brother-in-law of the former oil minister had received financial interests in a Liechtenstein construction firm controlled by a former representative of Occidental,\\" who, at the minister's request, \\"had financed a $100,000 movie extolling Libya, for which the former oil minister wrote the script,\\" with his brother-in-law receiving \\"90 percent of any profits the film might make.\\" Penn's research \\"showed that if the oil minister received no benefits from the award of the concessions to Occidental, his brother-in-law might have.\\" When President Nixon nominated William Casey to head the Securities and Exchange Commission, Penn heard that \\"Casey might have been involved in questionable activities,\\" and after some investigation discovered that \\"Casey was a rich man who had had interests in a lot of small electronic firms that sold stocks to the public\\" and that he had been the defendant in several lawsuits. In one suit, \\"Casey had been accused by a stockholder of violating the same securities laws he would have to uphold as head of the S.E.C. The plaintiff claimed that he had been duped by misleading information into investing $10,000 in Casey's firm, which had collapsed. Casey, the only defendant, had settled out of court for $8,000.\\" When Penn spoke to Casey, Casey described the lawsuit as a \\"nuisance suit\\" and maintained that \\"he hadn't been close to that company.\\" In fact, \\"Casey's law firm was general counsel to the company, and that he was a stockholder and a director as well as the chairman of the board.\\" Despite Penn's reporting, Casey was confirmed by the Senate to be head of the SEC. On May 21, 1981, he and Julie Salamon wrote a piece about recent cases of embezzlement in which Chase Manhattan and Wells Fargo had lost millions of dollars. Book He wrote a book entitled Have I Got a Tip for You... And Other Tales of Dirty Secrets, Political Payoffs and Corporate Scams: A Guide to Investigative Reporting. It was published by Dow Jones in 1994. Honors and awards In 1967, Penn and Monroe W. Karmin shared the Pulitzer Prize for National Affairs Reporting for exposing links between organized crime in the U.S. and gambling in the Bahamas. Their investigation established that American gangsters had infiltrated the gambling business on the islands and contributed to the fall of the Bahamian government in a later election.

Built about 1900, it is a well- preserved example of a Queen Anne style apartment house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2014. Description and history The Robarge-Desautels Apartment House stands on the east side of North Champlain Street in Burlington's Old North End neighborhood, a short way south of its junction with North Street. It is a long rectangular 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof augmented by long shed-roof dormers to provide a full living space in the attic level. Its vernacular Queen Anne features include gabled bracketed hoods over two of its entrances, which flank a central projecting polygonal bay. That bay is capped by a gable that projects beyond the corners of the bay. Along the right side there are two porches, one set above the entrance to the third-floor unit, the other two stories at the rear. In between is a polygonal bay. The apartment house was built about 1900, during a building boom caused by Burlington's rapidly increasing demand for workers in its burgeoning lumber-related industries. It was built by John Robarge, a blacksmith who built several properties on North Champlain and nearby streets in an area that had formerly been a private estate. He used the building as a rental property, and in 1921 his widow sold it to Wilfred and Clara Desautels, who occupied one of its units for thirty years.

Early life  Medina was born in New York City, the son of Judge Harold R. Medina Sr. and Ethel Forde Hillyer. He had a brother, Standish, who also became a New York City lawyer. He graduated from The Hill School. He received a B.A. summa cum laude from Princeton University and in 1937 a law degree from Columbia University.  Career  In 1937, Medina joined the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore and spent his entire career there, reaching partner in 1949 and retiring in 1974. =Hiss Case= During the Hiss Case (1948–1950), Medina represented Time (magazine) in the defense of Time senior editor Whittaker Chambers. In his memoir, Chambers explained his role: > Once Hiss sued me, Time, with its usual generosity, came to my aid. The > magazine took the position that in charging me with libel, Hiss had impugned > my veracity, not merely as an individual man, but as an editor of Time. > Time, therefore, had a direct concern in my vindication. > > For one reason or another, which I did not seek to explore, I was never > privy to the exact arrangements made by Time. But I was presently informed > that the costs of the legal defense had been, in so far as possible, lifted > from me. Some of the costs I must unavoidably bear. Time’s interests in the > Case were looked after by Harold Medina Jr., son of the now celebrated judge > who was soon to preside over the long trial of the Communist leaders. It was > sometimes necessary for me to confer with young Medina. I learned that now I > had investigators of my own. > > Note: Their business was not to pry into Hiss’s family history or > finances—matters that were never publicly touched upon by any member of my > counsel, by the Government’s prosecutor or by me, and that not because no > startling facts came to light. My investigators worked almost wholly to > locate witnesses who could corroborate my story about Hiss. Nearly always, > they found that Hiss’s investigators had been there first and that possible > witnesses had sometimes suffered strange black-outs of recollection. My > investigators soon passed out of the picture. In early December 1948, Chambers conferred with Medina about his employment with Time. Medina assured him \\"In six weeks this whole thing will be forgotten and you will be back at work as usual.\\" He escorted Chambers to a meeting at Time headquarters, where Chambers decided he should nevertheless resign. (Less than two weeks later, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury, which turned into two trials that ended with sentencing in January 1950.) When Chambers sought his advice on picking counsel in New York City during the Hiss trials, Medina received a call from congressional representative Richard M. Nixon. Nixon told Medina that Kodak had found that the microfilm from the \\"Pumpkin Papers\\" did not exist until 1945 (and not in 1938), the date of Chambers' microfilm. Chambers attempted suicide that evening, failed, and then learned from Kodak next morning that they had made an error: Kodak had merely discontinued production of that kind of microfilm during WWII. =Time v. Hill Case= In 1967, Medina won a 5-to-4 US Supreme Court vote on Time, Inc. v. Hill, 385 U.S. 374, in a suit brought by a family that claimed invasion of privacy based on portrayal of family members in a review of the 1955 Broadway play, The Desperate Hours. He argued that \\"articles or broadcasts that give a false impression of a person do not constitute an invasion of privacy unless the falsehood is published deliberately or recklessly,\\" thus extending constitutional protections of the press. Personal and death Medina married Janet Williams. They had three children: Harold R. Medina III, Robert Medina, Ann Medina Welch. He died from lung cancer on February 17, 1991, at home in Village of Golf, Florida, at the age of 78. (His father had died eleven months earlier at the age of 102.)

PTIP) aims to relieve emotional disturbances within the parent(s), the baby, and/or their interaction, for example, postnatal depression and anxiety, infant distress with breastfeeding and sleep, and attachment disorders. It rests on attachment theory and psychoanalysis. Sigmund Freud suggested that a modification of his method could be applied to children, and child analysis was introduced in the 1920s by [Anna Freud]..A. Freud, 1926, [Melanie Klein] Klein, 1932, and Hermine Hug von Hellmuth MacLean & Rappen, 1991. Klein speculated on infantile experiences to understand her patients' disorders but she did not practice PTIP. Donald Winnicott, a pediatrician and analyst, focused on the mother-baby interplay in his theorizing and his brief parent-child consultations Winnicott, 1971, but he did not work with PTIP. Definitions PTIP was introduced by Selma Fraiberg and Françoise Dolto after World War II.Selma Fraiberg, 1980Dolto, 1982; Dolto, 1985 Fraiberg was trained in the ego- psychological tradition, while Dolto was a pupil of Jacques Lacan. Another section Attachment-based therapy (children) complements the present one. A related method was developed by Esther Bick Bick, 1964 at the Tavistock Clinic in London, psychoanalytic infant observation, aiming to enhance therapy students' skills and to train clinicians who work with babies. This article focuses on \\"the phase prior to word presentation and the use of word symbols\\",Winnicott, 1960 p. 588 that is, up to 18 months of age. A psychodynamic perspective sees humans as struggling with unconscious urges that impact on their character, relationships, interests, passions, conscious attitudes, and cognitive capacities. PTIP focuses both on patients' behaviors and feelings as well as their unconscious motives for developing and maintaining them. Supportive elements are limited, though the therapist's \\"holding\\"Winnicott, 1960 or \\"containing\\"Bion, 1962 the patient's distress does have such ingredients. Other methods are more supportive and encourage the mother to change her behavior with the baby; developmental guidance,Lojkasek, Cohen, & Muir, 1994 infant massage,Field, 2000 interaction guidance,McDonough, 2004 and Marte Meo.Aarts, 2000 They are not covered here. Parents strive consciously to bond with the child and provide a fertile ground for attachment. Simultaneously, their unconscious impulses may run in opposite directions. Psychoanalytic theory often regards the mother as the baby's primary object, especially, her body parts or functions that stimulate the infant's fantasy life. Her bodily closeness with the foetus and the child will add unique qualities to their relationship. Yet, modern fathers are involved with their babies and some therapists argue that they should be invited more often in PTIP.Barrows, 1999Fivaz-Depeursinge & Corboz-Warnery, 1999von Klitzing, Simoni, Amsler, & Bürgin, 1999 A late development Sigmund Freud viewed the baby as involved in passionate relationships with his parents. He also uncovered infant-like remnants in every adult's personality. This affects the countertransference, the therapist's emotional reactions to the patient, even more so if the patient is a baby. The PTIP therapist is prone to a \\"massive identification with the child… it is not always easy to control one's reactions to [the baby's] positive or negative provocations\\" Watillon, 1993, p. 1045. This may explain why PTIP took a long time to develop. Also, the notion of psychoanalysis as a \\"talking cure\\" led to the idea that the primary therapy data are words, rather than all the \\"representations or signifiers of process\\" Olinick, 1985, p. 500. This, too, may have prevented analysts from treating babies. Those from the tradition of ego psychology advise against attributing mental capacities beyond the baby's developmental time-table Stern, 1985. This may make them reluctant to view the baby as an active participant in therapy. A final reason for the late development of PTIP might be that the high prevalence of postnatal depression Gavin et al., 2006 and infant emotional disturbances Skovgaard et al., 2007, Zeanah, 2009 was demonstrated only recently. Many \\"baby worries\\" emerge at Child Health Centers without the mother feeling that she needs psychotherapy herself Stern, 1995. It is the baby who functions, through various symptoms, as the alarm-clock. PTIP methods: A survey =Infant-parent psychotherapy= Selma Fraiberg formulated brief crisis interventions, interaction guidance-supportive treatments, and infant-parent psychotherapy. The first focused on problems arising from a \\"circumscribed set of external events\\" Fraiberg, 1989, p. 60. The second aimed at guiding parents with a more limited psychological- mindedness and was more of an \\"educational technique\\" Sherick, 2009, p. 231. Infant-parent psychotherapy, in contrast, was a PTIP method used when a baby reminded the parents of \\"an aspect of the parental self that is repudiated or negated\\" Fraiberg, 1989, p. 60, for example a painful childhood memory. This \\"ghost in the nursery\\" marred the parent's interactions with the baby, who got engulfed in the parental neurosis and developed an emotional disturbance himself. The treatment goal was that \\"the pathology which had spread to embrace the baby\\" Fraiberg, 1980, p. 111 could be withdrawn and the mother- baby relationship improve. In randomized controlled trials (RCT), Cohen et al., 1999, Lieberman, Weston, & Pawl, 1991, Robert-Tissot et al., 1996, Fraiberg's method was about as efficacious as Interaction Guidance (Robert- Tissot et al.) and Watch, Wait and Wonder (Cohen et al.), though the effects were slower in coming. Compared with a non-intervention group, its results were superior (Lieberman et al.). Lieberman and Van Horn also wrote a comprehensive monograph, see under \\"Further reading\\". Therapists in Geneva Cramer & Palacio Espasa, 1993, Manzano, Palacio Espasa, & Zilkha, 1999 work with less disadvantaged families than Fraiberg. Some publications were published in English Cramer, 1997, Espasa & Alcorn, 2004, Zlot, 2007. Their thinking resembles Fraiberg's but they focus more on the mother's psychopathology, for example, her self-preoccupation. The infant's symptoms might express \\"a repressed tendency in the parent\\" Cramer & Palacio Espasa, 1993, p. 85, which enters into a \\"core conflictual relationship\\" with the baby and will be enacted in therapy. These clinicians seem to regard the child as less of an active therapy participant than did Fraiberg. =Therapeutic consultations= The interventions of Serge Lebovici at the Centre Alfred Binet http://asm13.org/Le-Centre-Alfred-Binet in Paris resembled Winnicott's therapeutic consultations Winnicott, 1971 and Fraiberg's crisis interventions. Whereas Fraiberg suggested the mother's trauma might build up to forming the \\"ghost\\", Lebovici focused more on how her unconscious infantile sexuality colored her relationship with the baby. The baby's presence in sessions stimulated the therapist's metaphoric function, which he used to understand the roots of the dilemmas of mother and child. Some books by Françoise Dolto, another Parisian psychoanalyst, were translated into English Dolto, 2013/1971 but they do not cover her work with infants (see, however, Paglia, 2009). She thought a baby may understand some literal meaning of the therapist's words. This is refuted by research, Karmiloff & Karmiloff-Smith, 2001. On the other hand, babies seem to grasp that words indicate something special though they do not understand their literal sense Gervain, Macagno, Cogoi, Peña, & Mehler, 2008. Dolto claimed that when parents conceal painful or embarrassing facts it may stunt the baby's development, as when a mother wishes to protect her baby and conceal her personal worries. This creates a paradoxical situation for the baby who might sense mother's painful affects beneath her care-taking. Dolto thought words impacted on the baby via the parent’s courage in pronouncing embarrassing emotional truths: \\"Before the age of words, the presence of a mother speaking to her infant is a nourishment more valuable than the milk she offers at the breast\\" Dolto, 1994. Other Parisian therapists http://www.ipso- marty.org/ focus on psychosomatic disorders, which they link theoretically to infantile distress Aisenstein, 2006. =Mother-infant psychoanalytic treatment= Like Dolto, the Swedish psychoanalyst Johan Norman sought to establish a relationship with the infant, whom he thought possessed a primordial subjectivity and an intersubjectivity. He also thought the baby sought for containment from the therapist, and that she had a \\"unique flexibility in changing representations of itself and others that comes to an end as the ego develops\\" Norman, 2001, p. 85. Early therapy was thus recommended. He addressed the baby about emotional processes but disagreed that she can understand the lexical meaning of words. Questions about the baby's role in PTIP become less puzzling once we clarify that human communication takes place at various levels, among which the verbal is only one. Many analysts today use concepts by the American philosopher of Semiotics, Charles Sanders Peirce to describe the therapeutic process. They can help us understand the communicative levels in PTIP treatments Salomonsson, 2007. A similar perspective is used by infant researchers who micro-analyze the interactive mismatches of certain mother-infant interactions Beebe & Lachmann, 2014, Tronick, 2007. =The infant as subject= Therapists in Melbourne work with babies to \\"enter treatment through the infant's world rather than primarily through the parents' representations\\" Salo, 2007, p. 965. They develop a relationship with the baby in presence of the parents, believing that \\"the infant as subject\\" needs engagement in his own right. They, too, are convinced that a baby may direct emotions towards a therapist but in some contrast to Norman, they do not privilege promoting the baby's negative affects towards him/her. =Watch, Wait and Wonder= This technique (WWW; Lojkasek et al., 1994 from the Hincks-Dellcrest Center in Toronto has been compared with Fraiberg's mother-infant psychotherapy in an RCT Cohen et al., 1999, Cohen, Lojkasek, Muir, Muir, & Parker, 2002. Its proponents argue that if a mother does not perceive and respond to her baby's signals, a secure attachment will not develop. The therapist asks her to get on the floor, observe the baby, and interact at the baby's initiative. Mother becomes an \\"observer of her infant's activity, potentially gaining insight into the infant's inner world and relational needs\\" Cohen et al., 1999, p. 433. The therapist is \\"watching, waiting, and wondering about the interactions between mother and infant\\" (p. 437). The method also contains supportive elements in providing \\"a safe, supportive environment…\\" Cohen et al., 1999, p. 434. See also Tuters, Doulis, & Yabsley, 2011. =The PIP team at the Anna Freud Centre= Parent-Infant Psychotherapy (PIP) at the Anna Freud Centre in London Baradon et al., 2005 integrates Freudian metapsychology with infant research, attachment theory and developmental psychology. The authors use a psychoanalytic framework and wish to promote \\"the parent-infant relationship in order to facilitate infant development\\" (p. 25), support the baby's \\"attachment needs\\" towards his caregivers (p. 8), and scaffold him to help in his \\"emotional regulation\\" (p. 26). The baby is seen as a \\"partner in the therapeutic process\\" (p. 79). The overall goal is to support his \\"beginning mentalization and emotional regulation\\" (p. 75). The impact of the setting and the clinical sample Most authors worked in public health clinics, whereas Norman's cases were drawn mainly from his private practice and were long, high-frequency treatments with what seemed well-motivated parents. Fraiberg often treated mothers with a low educational and economic status Dowling, 1982, which also applies to the London PIP team. The Melbourne therapists treat severely sick children and their parents. Such factors will influence the parents' trust in the clinician, motivation for therapeutic work, and economic and practical means of taking part in treatment. Outcome research PTIP therapists have published clinical studies in various scientific journals. Randomized controlled trials (RCT) are increasing: Armstrong & Morris, 2000, Clark, Tluczek, & Wenzel, 2003, Cohen et al., 2002, Cohen et al., 1999, Hayes, Matthews, Copley, & Welsh, 2008, Lieberman et al., 1991, Robert-Tissot et al., 1996, Salomonsson & Sandell, 2011a, 2011b, Sleed, Baradon, & Fonagy, 2013, Toth, Rogosch, Manly, & Cicchetti, 2006. Most used follow-up periods of up to six months, except two with a follow-up of four years Cooper, Murray, Wilson, & Romaniuk, 2003, Murray, Cooper, Wilson, & Romaniuk, 2003, Winberg Salomonsson, Sorjonen, & B. Salomonsson, 2015. Many problems pertain to evaluating PTIP. Mother and baby are at different developmental levels and during infancy, emotional experiences may change swiftly. The baby's health is inferred through questionnaires or mother-baby recordings. Another validity problem is that most studies were made at the clinical center where the investigated method was developed. Thus, we do not know if it is equally effective in other circumstances. This may explain why a recent Cochrane review Barlow, Bennett, Midgley, Larkin, & Yinghui, 2015 only found some evidence of improved infant attachment but none concerning parental mental health. This is in contrast to several RCTs, which did find effects on maternal depression. Plausibly, the Cochrane study comprised several samples of different socio-economic and psychiatric characteristics. Some methods may be efficacious if the clinician takes such pre-treatment factors into consideration and recommends \\"the right treatment for the right family\\". Another meta-analysis Singleton, 2005 found, in contrast, minor treatment effects on infant development and mental health, and significant effects on parent-infant relationship and parenting ability. To sum up, research methods need further development and we need studies from more centers. Training and organization There are courses, for example, at the [Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research] and the Anni Bergman Parent Infant Training Program in New York, the Anna Freud Centre and the Tavistock and Portman NHS Foundation Trust and the School of Infant Mental Health in London, [International Psychoanalytic University Berlin], the University Sackler School of Medicine in Tel Aviv, the \\"Säuglings-Kleinkind-Eltern- Psychotherapie\\" or SKEPT in München, Centro Studi Martha Harris in Italy, the Eriksson Infant Mental Health Certificate Program in Chicago, the Infant- Parent Program at the University of California, San Francisco, training programs in Barcelona organized by the Spanish Psychoanalytical Society http://www.sep-psicoanalisi.org , and in Buenos Aires at the Hospital Italiano Cardenal, 1998.

It is an estrogen and is used mainly in menopausal hormone therapy and to treat low sex hormone levels in women. It is also used in hormonal birth control for women, in hormone therapy for transgender women, and in the treatment of hormone-sensitive cancers like prostate cancer in men and breast cancer in women, among other uses. Estradiol can be taken by mouth, held and dissolved under the tongue, as a gel or patch that is applied to the skin, in through the vagina, by injection into muscle or fat, or through the use of an implant that is placed into fat, among other routes. Side effects of estradiol in women include breast tenderness, breast enlargement, headache, fluid retention, and nausea among others. Men and children who are exposed to estradiol may develop symptoms of feminization, such as breast development and a feminine pattern of fat distribution, and men may also experience low testosterone levels and infertility. Estradiol may increase the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in women with intact uteruses if it is not taken together with a progestogen such as progesterone. The combination of estradiol with a progestin, though not with oral progesterone, may increase the risk of breast cancer. Estradiol should not be used in women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or who have breast cancer, among other contraindications. Estradiol is a naturally occurring and bioidentical estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptor, the biological target of estrogens like endogenous estradiol. Due to its estrogenic activity, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects and can inhibit fertility and suppress sex hormone production in both women and men. Estradiol differs from non- bioidentical estrogens like conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol in various ways, with implications for tolerability and safety. Estradiol was discovered in 1933. It became available as a medication that same year, in an injectable form known as estradiol benzoate. Forms that were more useful by mouth, estradiol valerate and micronized estradiol, were introduced in the 1960s and 1970s and increased its popularity by this route. Estradiol is also used as other prodrugs, like estradiol cypionate. Related estrogens such as ethinylestradiol, which is the most common estrogen in birth control pills, and conjugated estrogens (brand name Premarin), which is used in menopausal hormone therapy, are used as medications as well. In 2017, it was the 61st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than twelve million prescriptions. Medical uses =Hormone therapy= Menopause Average number of moderate-to-severe hot flashes per week with placebo and different doses of oral estradiol in menopausal women. Estradiol is used in menopausal hormone therapy to prevent and treat moderate to severe menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness and atrophy, and osteoporosis (bone loss). As unopposed estrogen therapy (using estrogen alone without progesterone) increases the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer in women with intact uteruses, estradiol is usually combined with a progestogen like progesterone or medroxyprogesterone acetate to prevent the effects of estradiol on the endometrium. This is not necessary if the woman has undergone a hysterectomy (surgical removal of the uterus). A 2017 meta-analysis found that estradiol had no effect on depressive symptoms in peri- and postmenopausal women. Hypogonadism Estrogen is responsible for the mediation of puberty in females, and in girls with delayed puberty due to hypogonadism (low-functioning gonads, which can result in low sex hormone levels) such as in Turner syndrome, estradiol is used to induce the development of and maintain female secondary sexual characteristics such as breasts, wide hips, and a female fat distribution. It is also used to restore estradiol levels in adult premenopausal women with hypogonadism, for instance those with premature ovarian failure or who have undergone oophorectomy. It is used to treat women with hypogonadism due to hypopituitarism as well. Transgender women Estradiol is used as part of feminizing hormone therapy for transgender women. The drug is used in higher dosages prior to sex reassignment surgery or orchiectomy to help suppress testosterone levels; after this procedure, estradiol continues to be used at lower dosages to maintain estradiol levels in the normal premenopausal female range. =Birth control= Although almost all combined oral contraceptives contain the synthetic estrogen ethinylestradiol, natural estradiol itself is also used in some hormonal contraceptives, including in estradiol-containing oral contraceptives and combined injectable contraceptives. It is formulated in combination with a progestin such as dienogest, nomegestrol acetate, or medroxyprogesterone acetate, and is often used in the form of an ester prodrug like estradiol valerate or estradiol cypionate. Hormonal contraceptives contain a progestin and/or estrogen and prevent ovulation and thus the possibility of pregnancy by suppressing the secretion of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the peak of which around the middle of the menstrual cycle causes ovulation to occur. =Hormonal cancer= Prostate cancer Estradiol is used as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy to treat prostate cancer and is similarly effective to other therapies such as androgen deprivation therapy with castration and antiandrogens. It is used in the form of long-lasting injected estradiol prodrugs like polyestradiol phosphate, estradiol valerate, and estradiol undecylate, and has also more recently been assessed in the form of transdermal estradiol patches. Estrogens are effective in the treatment of prostate cancer by suppressing testosterone levels into the castrate range, increasing levels of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and thereby decreasing the fraction of free testosterone, and possibly also via direct cytotoxic effects on prostate cancer cells. Parenteral estradiol is largely free of the cardiovascular side effects of the high oral dosages of synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol ad ethinylestradiol that were used previously. In addition, estrogens may have advantages relative to castration in terms of hot flashes, sexual interest and function, osteoporosis, cognitive function, and quality of life. However, side effects such as gynecomastia and feminization in general may be difficult to tolerate and unacceptable for many men. Breast cancer High-dose estrogen therapy is effective in the treatment of about 35% of cases of breast cancer in women who are at least 5 years menopausal and has comparable effectiveness to antiestrogen therapy with medications like the selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) tamoxifen. Although estrogens are rarely used in the treatment of breast cancer today and synthetic estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol have most commonly been used, estradiol itself has been used in the treatment of breast cancer as well. It has been used orally at very high doses (30 mg/day) in the treatment of therapy-naive breast cancer and orally at low doses (2 to 6 mg/day) in the treatment of breast cancer in women who were previously treated with and benefited from but acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors. Polyestradiol phosphate is also used to treat breast cancer.http://pharmanovia.com/product/estradurin/ =Other uses= Infertility  Estrogens may be used in treatment of infertility in women when there is a need to develop sperm-friendly cervical mucous or an appropriate uterine lining. It is also commonly used during in vitro fertilization (IVF). Estrogen helps maintains the endometrial lining of the uterus and help prepare for pregnancy. Research shows higher pregnancy rate if the mother takes estrogen in addition to progesterone. Estradiol is the predominant form of estrogen during reproductive years and is most commonly prescribed. Lactation suppression Estrogens can be used to suppress and cease lactation and breast engorgement in postpartum women who do not wish to breastfeed. They do this by directly decreasing the sensitivity of the alveoli of the mammary glands to the lactogenic hormone prolactin. Tall stature Estrogens have been used to limit final height in adolescent girls with tall stature. They do this by inducing epiphyseal closure and suppressing growth hormone-induced hepatic production and by extension circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a hormone that causes the body to grow and increase in size. Although ethinylestradiol and conjugated estrogens have mainly been used for this purpose, estradiol can also be employed. Breast enhancement Estrogens are involved in breast development and estradiol may be used as a form of hormonal breast enhancement to increase the size of the breasts. Both polyestradiol phosphate monotherapy and pseudopregnancy with a combination of high-dosage intramuscular estradiol valerate and hydroxyprogesterone caproate have been assessed for this purpose in clinical studies. However, acute or temporary breast enlargement is a well- known side effect of estrogens, and increases in breast size tend to regress following discontinuation of treatment. Aside from those without prior established breast development, evidence is lacking for a sustained increases in breast size with estrogens. Schizophrenia Estradiol has been found to be effective in the adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in women. It has been found to significantly reduce positive, negative, and cognitive symptoms, with particular benefits on positive symptoms. Other estrogens, as well as selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like raloxifene, have been found to be effective in the adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in women similarly. Estrogens may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia in men as well, but their use in this population is limited by feminizing side effects. SERMs, which have few or no feminizing side effects, have been found to be effective in the adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia in men similarly to in women and may be more useful than estrogens in this sex. Sexual deviance Estradiol has been used at high doses in the treatment of sexual deviance, such as paraphilias, in men. It has specifically been used for this indication in the form of subcutaneous pellet implants of estradiol and intramuscular injections of estradiol undecylate. =Available forms= Estradiol is available in a variety of different formulations, including oral, intranasal, transdermal/topical, vaginal, injectable, and implantable preparations. An ester may be attached to one or both of the hydroxyl groups of estradiol to improve its oral bioavailability and/or duration of action with injection. Such modifications give rise to forms such as estradiol acetate (oral and vaginal), estradiol valerate (oral and injectable), estradiol cypionate (injectable), estradiol benzoate (injectable), estradiol undecylate (injectable), and polyestradiol phosphate (injectable; a polymerized ester of estradiol), which are all prodrugs of estradiol. Contraindications Estrogens like estradiol have a number of contraindications. Estradiol should be avoided when there is undiagnosed abnormal vaginal bleeding, known, suspected or a history of breast cancer, current treatment for metastatic disease, known or suspected estrogen- dependent neoplasia, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or history of these conditions, active or recent arterial thromboembolic disease such as stroke, myocardial infarction, liver dysfunction or disease. Estradiol should not be taken by people with a hypersensitivity/allergy or those who are pregnant or are suspected pregnant. Side effects Common side effects of estradiol in women include headache, breast pain or tenderness, breast enlargement, irregular vaginal bleeding or spotting, abdominal cramps, bloating, fluid retention, and nausea. Other possible side effects of estrogens may include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, enlargement of uterine fibroids, melasma, vaginal yeast infections, and liver problems. In men, estrogens can cause breast pain or tenderness, gynecomastia (male breast development), feminization, demasculinization, sexual dysfunction (decreased libido and erectile dysfunction), hypogonadism, testicular atrophy, and infertility. =Blood clots= Oral estradiol and estradiol valerate, for instance in menopausal hormone therapy or birth control pills, are associated with a significantly higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) than non-use. Higher doses of oral estrogens are associated with higher risks of VTE. In contrast to oral estradiol, transdermal and vaginal estradiol at menopausal replacement dosages are not associated with a higher incidence of VTE. Low doses (e.g., 50 μg/day) and high doses (e.g., 100 μg/day) of transdermal estradiol for menopausal replacement do not differ in terms of VTE risk. The higher risk of VTE with oral estradiol can be attributed to the first pass and a disproportionate effect on liver synthesis of coagulation factors. Even high doses of parenteral estradiol, such as high-dose polyestradiol phosphate, have minimal influence on coagulation factors, in contrast to oral estrogen therapy. However, sufficient doses of parenteral estradiol, for instance very high doses of estradiol valerate by intramuscular injection, can nonetheless activate coagulation, presumably increasing VTE risk. In addition to the route of administration, the type of estrogen influences VTE risk. Oral conjugated estrogens are associated with a higher risk of VTE than oral estradiol. Estradiol- and estradiol valerate-containing birth control pills are associated with a lower risk of VTE than birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol. The relative risk of VTE is thought to be highest with oral ethinylestradiol, intermediate with oral conjugated estrogens, low with oral estradiol and parenteral estradiol valerate, and very low with transdermal estradiol. Conjugated estrogens and ethinylestradiol are thought to have a higher risk of VTE than estradiol because they are resistant to hepatic metabolism and have a disproportionate influence on liver production of coagulation factors. The combination of oral or transdermal estradiol and a progestin is associated with a higher risk of VTE than estradiol alone. Dydrogesterone is associated with a lower risk than other progestins such as medroxyprogesterone acetate and norethisterone, while oral progesterone is associated with no increase in risk of VTE. Older age, higher body weight, lower physical activity, and smoking are all associated with a higher risk of VTE with oral estrogen therapy. Risk of VTE with estrogen therapy is highest at the start of treatment, particularly during the first year, and decreases over time. The absolute risk of VTE with estrogen and/or progestin therapy is small.https://web.archive.org/web/20190427143241/https://www.fda.gov/drugs/drug- safety-and-availability/fda-drug-safety-communication-updated-information- about-risk-blood-clots-women-taking-birth-control Women who are not on a birth control pill or hormone therapy have a risk of VTE of about 1 to 5 out of 10,000 women per year. In women taking a birth control pill containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin, the risk of VTE is in the range of 3 to 10 out of 10,000 women per year. Birth control pills containing estradiol valerate and a progestin are associated with about half the risk of VTE of ethinylestradiol/progestin-containing birth control pills. Hormone therapy for transgender women likewise is associated with a lower risk of VTE than birth control pills containing ethinylestradiol and a progestin. The risk of VTE during pregnancy, when estrogens and progesterone increase to very high levels, is 5 to 20 in 10,000 women per year, while the risk is 40 to 65 per 10,000 women per year during the postpartum period. =Long-term effects= Uncommon but serious possible side effects of estrogens associated with long- term therapy may include breast cancer, uterine cancer, stroke, heart attack, blood clots, dementia, gallbladder disease, and ovarian cancer. Warning signs of these serious side effects include breast lumps, unusual vaginal bleeding, dizziness, faintness, changes in speech, severe headaches, chest pain, shortness of breath, pain in the legs, changes in vision, and vomiting. Due to health risks observed with the combination of conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) studies (see below), the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Estrace (estradiol) advises that estrogens should be used in menopausal hormone therapy only for the shortest time possible and at the lowest effective dose. While the FDA states that is unknown if these risks generalize to estradiol (alone or in combination with progesterone or a progestin), it advises that in the absence of comparable data, the risks should be assumed to be similar. When used to treat menopausal symptoms, the FDA recommends that discontinuation of estradiol should be attempted every three to six months via a gradual dose taper. The combination of bioidentical transdermal or vaginal estradiol and oral or vaginal progesterone appears to be a safer form of hormone therapy than the combination of oral conjugated estrogens and medroxyprogesterone acetate and may not share the same health risks. Advantages may include reduced or no risk of venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer, among others. Overdose Estrogens are relatively safe in overdose. During pregnancy, levels of estradiol increase to very high concentrations that are as much as 100-fold normal levels.http://www.ilexmedical.com/files/PDF/Estradiol_ARC.pdf In late pregnancy, the body produces and secretes approximately 100 mg of estrogens, including estradiol, estrone, and estriol, per day. Serious adverse effects have not been described following acute overdose of large doses of estrogen- and progestogen-containing birth control pills by small children. Symptoms of estrogen overdosage may include nausea, vomiting, bloating, increased weight, water retention, breast tenderness, vaginal discharge, vaginal bleeding, heavy legs, and leg cramps. These side effects can be diminished by reducing the estrogen dosage. Interactions Inducers of cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4 such as St. John's wort, phenobarbital, carbamazepine and rifampicin decrease the circulating levels of estradiol by accelerating its metabolism, whereas inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes like CYP3A4 such as erythromycin, cimetidine, clarithromycin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir and grapefruit juice may slow its metabolism resulting in increased levels of estradiol in the circulation. There is an interaction between estradiol and alcohol such that alcohol considerably increases circulating levels of estradiol during oral estradiol therapy and also increases estradiol levels in normal premenopausal women and with parenteral estradiol therapy. This appears to be due to a decrease in hepatic 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (17β-HSD2) activity and hence estradiol inactivation into estrone due to an alcohol-mediated increase in the ratio of NADH to NAD in the liver. Spironolactone may reduce the bioavailability of high doses of oral estradiol. Pharmacology =Pharmacodynamics= Estradiol is an estrogen, or an agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs), the and . It is also an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), including the , , ER-X, and ERx. Estradiol is highly selective for these ERs and mERs, and does not interact importantly with other steroid hormone receptors. It is far more potent as an estrogen than are other bioidentical estrogens like estrone and estriol. Given by subcutaneous injection in mice, estradiol is about 10-fold more potent than estrone and about 100-fold more potent than estriol. The ERs are expressed widely throughout the body, including in the breasts, uterus, vagina, fat, skin, bone, liver, pituitary gland, hypothalamus, and other parts of the brain. In accordance, estradiol has numerous effects throughout the body. Among other effects, estradiol produces breast development, feminization, changes in the female reproductive system, changes in liver protein synthesis, and changes in brain function. The effects of estradiol can influence health in both positive and negative ways. In addition to the aforementioned effects, estradiol has antigonadotropic effects due to its estrogenic activity, and can inhibit ovulation and suppress gonadal sex hormone production. At sufficiently high dosages, estradiol is a powerful antigonadotropic, capable of suppressing testosterone levels into the castrate/female range in men. There are differences between estradiol and other estrogens, such as non-bioidentical estrogens like natural conjugated estrogens and synthetic estrogens like ethinylestradiol and diethylstilbestrol, with implications for pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics as well as efficacy, tolerability, and safety. =Pharmacokinetics= Estradiol can be taken by a variety of different routes of administration. These include oral, buccal, sublingual, intranasal, transdermal (gels, creams, patches), vaginal (tablets, creams, rings, suppositories), rectal, by intramuscular or subcutaneous injection (in oil or aqueous), and as a subcutaneous implant. The pharmacokinetics of estradiol, including its bioavailability, metabolism, biological half-life, and other parameters, differ by route of administration. Likewise, the potency of estradiol, and its local effects in certain tissues, most importantly the liver, differ by route of administration as well. In particular, the oral route is subject to a high first-pass effect, which results in high levels of estradiol and consequent estrogenic effects in the liver and low potency due to first-pass hepatic and intestinal metabolism into metabolites like estrone and estrogen conjugates. Conversely, this is not the case for parenteral (non- oral) routes, which bypass the intestines and liver. Different estradiol routes and dosages can achieve widely varying circulating estradiol levels. For purposes of comparison with normal physiological circumstances, menstrual cycle circulating levels of estradiol in premenopausal women are 40 pg/mL in the early follicular phase, 250 pg/mL at the middle of the cycle, and 100 pg/mL during the mid-luteal phase. Mean integrated levels of circulating estradiol in premenopausal women across the whole menstrual cycle have been reported to be in the range of 80 and 150 pg/mL, according to some sources. Chemistry Estradiol is a naturally occurring estrane steroid. It is also known as 17β-estradiol (to distinguish it from 17α-estradiol) or as estra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17β-diol. It has two hydroxyl groups, one at the C3 position and the other at the C17β position, as well as three double bonds in the A ring (the estra-1,3,5(10)-triene core). Due to its two hydroxyl groups, estradiol is often abbreviated as E2. The structurally related estrogens, estrone (E1), estriol (E3), and estetrol (E4) have one, three, and four hydroxyl groups, respectively. =Hemihydrate= A hemihydrate form of estradiol, estradiol hemihydrate, is widely used medically under a large number of brand names similarly to estradiol. In terms of activity and bioequivalence, estradiol and its hemihydrate are identical, with the only disparities being an approximate 3% difference in potency by weight (due to the presence of water molecules in the hemihydrate form of the substance) and a slower rate of release with certain formulations of the hemihydrate. This is because estradiol hemihydrate is more hydrated than anhydrous estradiol, and for this reason, is more insoluble in water in comparison, which results in slower absorption rates with specific formulations of the drug such as vaginal tablets. Estradiol hemihydrate has also been shown to result in less systemic absorption as a vaginal tablet formulation relative to other topical estradiol formulations such as vaginal creams. Estradiol hemihydrate is used in place of estradiol in some estradiol products. =Derivatives= A variety of C17β and/or C3 ester prodrugs of estradiol, such as estradiol acetate, estradiol benzoate, estradiol cypionate, estradiol dipropionate, estradiol enantate, estradiol undecylate, estradiol valerate, and polyestradiol phosphate (an estradiol ester in polymeric form), among many others, have been developed and introduced for medical use as estrogens. Estramustine phosphate is also an estradiol ester, but with a nitrogen mustard moiety attached, and is used as a cytostatic antineoplastic agent in the treatment of prostate cancer. Cloxestradiol acetate and promestriene are ether prodrugs of estradiol that have been introduced for medical use as estrogens as well, although they are little known and rarely used. Synthetic derivatives of estradiol used as estrogens include ethinylestradiol, ethinylestradiol sulfonate, mestranol, methylestradiol, moxestrol, and quinestrol, all of which are 17α-substituted estradiol derivatives. Synthetic derivatives of estradiol used in scientific research include 8β-VE2 and 16α-LE2. History Estradiol was first discovered and synthesized in 1933 via reduction of estrone. Subsequently, estradiol was isolated for the first time in 1935. It was also originally known as dihydroxyestrin, dihydrofolliculin, or alpha-estradiol. Estradiol was first introduced for medical use, in the form of estradiol benzoate, a short- acting ester prodrug of estradiol administered by intramuscular injection in oil solution, under the brand name Progynon B in 1933. Estradiol itself was also marketed in the 1930s and 1940s in the form of oral tablets and solutions, vaginal suppositories, and topical ointments under a variety of brand names including Dimenformon, Gynoestryl, Ovocyclin, Progynon, and Progynon DH. Marketed vaginal estradiol suppositories were also used rectally. Estradiol dipropionate, another short-acting ester of estradiol in oil solution for use by intramuscular injection, was marketed under the brand name Di-Ovocylin by 1939. In contrast to estrone, estradiol was never been marketed in oil solution for intramuscular injection. This is attributable to its short duration of action and the availability of longer-acting estradiol esters like estradiol benzoate and estradiol dipropionate. Delivery of estrogens by nasal spray was studied in 1929, and an estradiol nasal spray for local use was marketed by Schering under the brand name Progynon DH Nasal Spray by 1941. Sublingual administration of estradiol was first described in the early 1940s. Buccal estradiol tablets were marketed by Schering under the brand name Progynon Buccal Tablets by 1949. Estradiol tablets for use by the sublingual route were marketed under the brand name Estradiol Membrettes in 1950, as well as under the brand name Diogynets by 1952. Longer-acting esters of estradiol in oil solution like estradiol valerate (Delestrogen, Progynon Depot), estradiol cypionate (Depo-Estradiol), and estradiol undecylate (Delestrec, Progynon Depot 100), as well as the polymeric estradiol ester polyestradiol phosphate in aqueous solution (Estradurin), were developed and introduced for use by intramuscular injection in the 1950s. Due to poor absorption and low potency relative to other estrogens, oral estradiol was not widely used as late as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol were typically used by the oral route. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for medical use under the brand name Progynova. Esterification of estradiol, as in estradiol valerate, improved its metabolic stability with oral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and oral potency by several-fold. In 1972, micronization of estradiol was studied in women and was likewise found to improve the absorption and potency of estradiol by the oral route. Subsequently, oral micronized estradiol was introduced for medical use in the United States under the brand name Estrace in 1975. Oral micronized estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have similar bioavailability and are both now widely used throughout the world. After the introduction of oral micronized estradiol, vaginal and intranasal micronized estradiol were evaluated in 1977 and both subsequently introduced. The first transdermal estradiol gel, a hydroalcoholic gel known as EstroGel, was initially described in 1980 and was introduced in Europe around 1981. Transdermal estradiol gel did not become available in the United States until 2004, when EstroGel was introduced in this country as well. A transdermal estradiol emulsion, Estrasorb, was marketed in the United States in 2003 as well. One of the earliest reports of transdermal estradiol patches was published in 1983. Estraderm, a reservoir patch and the first transdermal estradiol patch to be marketed, was introduced in Europe in 1985 and in the United States in 1986. The first transdermal matrix estradiol patches to be introduced were Climara and Vivelle between 1994 and 1996, and were followed by many others. Ethinylestradiol, a synthetic derivative of estradiol, was synthesized from estradiol by Inhoffen and Hohlweg in 1938 and was introduced for oral use by Schering in the United States under the brand name Estinyl in 1943. Starting in the 1950s, ethinylestradiol became widely used in birth control pills. Estradiol-containing birth control pills were initially studied in the 1970s, with the first report published in 1977. Development of birth control pills containing estradiol was motivated by the thrombotic risks of ethinylestradiol that were uncovered in the 1960s and 1970s. More than 15 attempts were made at development of an estradiol-containing birth control pill starting in the 1970s, but were unsuccessful due to unacceptable menstrual bleeding patterns. Estradiol valerate/cyproterone acetate (Femilar) was introduced for use as a birth control pill in Finland in 1993, but was never marketed elsewhere. Subsequently, estradiol valerate/dienogest (Natazia, Qlaira) was marketed as a birth control pill in 2008 and estradiol/nomegestrol acetate (Naemis, Zoely) was introduced in 2012. Society and culture =Generic names= Estradiol is the generic name of estradiol in American English and its , , , , , and . Estradiolo is the name of estradiol in Italian and the and estradiolum is its name in Latin, whereas its name remains unchanged as estradiol in Spanish, Portuguese, French, and German. Oestradiol was the former of estradiol and its name in British English, but the spelling was eventually changed to estradiol. When estradiol is provided in its hemihydrate form, its is estradiol hemihydrate. =Brand names= Estradiol is marketed under a large number of brand names throughout the world. Examples of major brand names in which estradiol has been marketed in include Climara, Climen, Dermestril, Divigel, Estrace, Natifa, Estraderm, Estraderm TTS, Estradot, Estreva, Estrimax, Estring, Estrofem, EstroGel, Evorel, Fem7 (or FemSeven), Imvexxy, Menorest, Oesclim, OestroGel, Sandrena, Systen, and Vagifem. Estradiol valerate is marketed mainly as Progynova and Progynon- Depot, while it is marketed as Delestrogen in the U.S. Estradiol cypionate is used mainly in the U.S. and is marketed under the brand name Depo-Estradiol. Estradiol acetate is available as Femtrace, Femring, and Menoring. Estradiol is also widely available in combination with progestogens. It is available in combination with norethisterone acetate under the major brand names Activelle, Cliane, Estalis, Eviana, Evorel Conti, Evorel Sequi, Kliogest, Novofem, Sequidot, and Trisequens; with drospirenone as Angeliq; with dydrogesterone as Femoston, Femoston Conti; and with nomegestrol acetate as Zoely. Estradiol valerate is available with cyproterone acetate as Climen; with dienogest as Climodien and Qlaira; with norgestrel as Cyclo-Progynova and Progyluton; with levonorgestrel as Klimonorm; with medroxyprogesterone acetate as Divina and Indivina; and with norethisterone enantate as Mesigyna and Mesygest. Estradiol cypionate is available with medroxyprogesterone acetate as Cyclo-Provera, Cyclofem, Feminena, Lunelle, and Novafem; estradiol enantate with algestone acetophenide as Deladroxate and Topasel; and estradiol benzoate is marketed with progesterone as Mestrolar and Nomestrol. Estradiol valerate is also widely available in combination with prasterone enantate (DHEA enantate) under the brand name Gynodian Depot. =Availability= Estradiol and/or its esters are widely available in countries throughout the world in a variety of formulations. United States Vivelle-Dot, an estradiol patch. , estradiol is available in the United States in the following forms: * Oral tablets (Femtrace (as estradiol acetate), Gynodiol, Innofem, generics) * Transdermal patches (Alora, Climara, Esclim, Estraderm, FemPatch, Menostar, Minivelle, Vivelle, Vivelle-Dot, generics) * Topical gels (Divigel, Elestrin, EstroGel, Sandrena), emulsions (Estrasorb), and sprays (Evamist) * Vaginal tablets (Vagifem, generics), creams (Estrace), inserts (Imvexxy), and rings (Estring, Femring (as estradiol acetate)) * Oil solution for intramuscular injection (Delestrogen (as estradiol valerate), Depo-Estradiol (as estradiol cypionate)) Oral estradiol valerate (Progynova) and other esters of estradiol that are used by injection like estradiol benzoate, estradiol enantate, and estradiol undecylate all are not marketed in the U.S. Polyestradiol phosphate (Estradurin) was marketed in the U.S. previously but is no longer available. Estradiol is also available in the U.S. in combination with progestogens for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and as a combined hormonal contraceptive: * Oral oil-filled capsules with progesterone (Bijuva) * Oral tablets with drospirenone (Angeliq) and norethisterone acetate (Activella, Amabelz) and as estradiol valerate with dienogest (Natazia) * Transdermal patches with levonorgestrel (Climara Pro) and norethisterone acetate (Combipatch) Estradiol and estradiol esters are also available in custom preparations from compounding pharmacies in the U.S. This includes subcutaneous pellet implants, which are not available in the United States as FDA-approved pharmaceutical drugs. In addition, topical creams that contain estradiol are generally regulated as cosmetics rather than as drugs in the U.S. and hence are also sold over-the-counter and may be purchased without a prescription on the Internet. Other countries Pharmaceutical estradiol subcutaneous pellet implants were formerly available in the United Kingdom and Australia under the brand name Estradiol Implants or Oestradiol Implants (Organon; 25, 50, or 100 mg), but have been discontinued. However, an estradiol subcutaneous implant with the brand name Meno-Implant (Organon; 20 mg) continues to be available in the Netherlands.https://www.gezondheidsnet.nl/medicijnen/meno-implantr Previously, for instance in the 1970s and 1980s, other subcutaneous estradiol implant products such as Progynon Pellets (Schering; 25 mg) and Estropel Pellets (25 mg; Bartor Pharmacol) were marketed. It has been said that pharmaceutical estradiol implants have been almost exclusively used in the United Kingdom. Subcutaneous estradiol implants are also available as custom compounded products in some countries. In 2019 estradiol become “long-term out of stock” in the United Kingdom. =Usage= Besides ethinylestradiol used in birth control pills, estradiol was the most used estrogen in the U.S. in 2016, with 13.4 million total prescriptions filled. The next most used estrogen in the U.S. in 2016 was conjugated estrogens, with 4.2 million total prescriptions filled. =Cost= Generic oral estradiol tablets are much less expensive than other forms of estradiol such as transdermal gel and patches and vaginal rings. Research A variety of estradiol-containing combined birth control pills were studied but never marketed. In addition, a variety of estradiol-containing combined injectable contraceptives were studied but never marketed. Estradiol has been studied in the treatment of postpartum depression and postpartum psychosis. Estrogens such as estradiol appear to improve sexual desire and function in women. However, the available evidence overall does not support the use of estradiol and other estrogens for improving sexual desire and function in women as of 2016. An exception is the use of estrogens to treat vaginal atrophy.

The lot the Sacred Heart Church sits on is owned by the City of Phoenix, Aviation Department. Sacred Heart Church was the pillar of the Golden Gate Barrio, and the Braun Sacred Heart Center Inc. has been hosting a yearly Christmas Day Mass at noon for former residents since 1987, with the permission of the City of Phoenix. History Around 1950, Victor Stinger donated a small lot at 17th and Sherman Streets in Phoenix, AZ to be used for Catholic mass for the residents of the Golden Gate Barrio and its surrounding barrios. The original structure was a ramada with a dirt floor and a palm thatch roof. The construction of Sacred Heart Church is credited to Albert Braun. Around 1952, Father Al, as he was known, began working within the community and requested that he remain in the barrios and not be moved around like \\"all the others\\" until he \\"completed his work\\". Father Al held his first mass under the ramada on August 10, 1952 and held mass there for two and one half years. During this two and one half year period, Father Al began acquiring land through political activism and brick through a local fundraising campaign within the Golden Gate Barrio whereas every single resident, including children, would each buy at least one red brick after the supply of adobe bricks was destroyed in a rain storm. With an $8,000 loan from the Bishop of Tucson, the rectory was completed on March 15, 1954. Two chapels were constructed on the southern and eastern sections of the parish: Saint Isabel (later named Saint John's) on 18th St. and Magnolia and Saint Mary Magdalene on 11th St. and Hilton with first mass dates being on March 18, 1954 and May 17, 1954, respectively. The altar, made of Italian marble, the roof, bell tower, and copper dome were added shortly after, completing construction. Father Al left the parish in 1962, but remain involved in the church at various capacities until his death in 1983. The Dioceses of Phoenix sold the Church to the City of Phoenix, Aviation Department in 1985 through the West Approach Land Acquisition Project. Cultural & Historical Significance Although Sacred Heart Parish was one of the poorest parishes during its active tenure, Father Al committed the church to the community by having its two most active parishioners, Ramon Arvizu and Pete Avila, graduate from St. Vincent De Paul Society's charity training school to help the local residents with food insecurity and inadequate housing.

He began his career as a cornet in the Royal Danish Army, serving in the dragoon regiment of General Major Frederik Gersdorff in Rákóczi's War of Independence. Von Koppelow's regiment engaged in several campaigns in areas of the Habsburg Empire and took part in the decisive Battle of Zsibó against the Kuruc (Hungarian) army in Transylvania.Dybwad, Jacob. \\"Grønvold Slægts-krøniker, 1500–1800\\", J.

Von Koppelow was deployed in Østfold in southeast Norway to serve in the Smaalandske Company as lieutenant in the 2nd Søndenfjeldske Dragoon Regiment by 1711. At age 32 Von Kopplow had been promoted to the position of captain in the Norwegian Army. The young officer gained several promotions in quick succession during his engagement in the Great Northern War.Ovenstad, Olai. \\"Den norske hær 1628–1900. 53 plansjer, utarbeidet 1920–1948\\" Samfundet for dansk-norsk genealogi og personalhistorie (1948): 50–52 Coat of arms of the House of Koppelow =Service in the Great Northern War= Von Koppelow led his Vesterlen Company, around 100 men strong, in the crucial Battle of Gjellebekk (1716) on 23 March 1716 and Battle of Norderhov (1716) on 29 March 1716 during the Swedish invasion of Norway.Vaupell, Otto F. \\"Den danske hærs historie til nutiden og den norske hærs historie, indtil 1814\\" Gyldendal (1876): 31Jacobsen, John W. \\"Gjellebekk Skanse – Karl XIIs felttog i 1716 og skansens viktige betydning\\" Lier kommune (1716) On 8 March 1716 the Swedish Army led by King Charles XII of Sweden crossed the Swedish-Norwegian border, hoping that a strike against the country would compel Denmark-Norway, one of its main adversaries in the Great Northern War, to withdraw from Sweden’s prize territory Scania. To achieve this objective the main body of the Swedish force laid siege to Akershus fortress at Christiania (the contemporary name of Oslo). A force numbering an estimated 7,000 men took part in the invasion, and threatened Norway’s entire southeast region. However, prior to the siege much of the Dano-Norwegian force had retreated to Gjellebekk (variant Jellebeck) in Lier, a strategic position in the corridor between Christiania and Drammen. Intent on remaining on the offensive, the Swedish king directed a part of his force to push further into the countryside towards the Dano-Norwegian position.Faye, A. \\"Carl XII og hans Angreb paa Norge 1716 og 1718\\" Historisk Tidsskrift, Bind 3. No. 6 (1867–1869): 431 =Battle of Gjellebekk (1716)= 600 dragoons under the command of Swedish colonel Dietrich Johan Löwenstierne were tasked with the objective of engaging the Norwegian Army head on. Yet the southeast region of Norway had experienced heavy snowfall in March, and the forested countryside presented a not insignificant hurdle for cavalry units that depended on mobility and speed. Despite the difficult terrain the Swedish force initially moved aggressively westwards, and managed to surprise a Dano-Norwegian position at Gjellum (variant Hellum). The forward position was quickly overwhelmed. However, three dragoon companies led by Captain Von Koppelow, Colonel Johan Wilhelm von Ötken and Lieutenant Peder Tønder Collin came to the aid of the isolated units, and drove back Löwenstiernes’s force. While both sides suffered casualties, the counter-attack and stiff resistance by Von Koppelow’s dragoons dissuaded the Swedish Army from proceeding further towards Gjellebekk.Bjerke, Alf E. \\"Nordens løve – Karl 12. i Norge: felttogene i 1716 og 1718\\" Aschehoug (1992)Jensen, Åke F. \\"Kavaleriet i Norge, 1200–1994: utvikling og innsats gjennom 800 år\\" Trandum (1995)Jacobsen, John W. \\"Gjellebekk Skanse – Karl XIIs felttog i 1716 og skansens viktige betydning\\" Lier kommune (1716) =Battle of Norderhov (1716)= In coordination with Löwenstierne’s frontal attack, the Swedish king had also instructed Axel Löwen to move with a force of 500 dragoons northwest to Ringerike and then, in an intended pincer movement with Löwenstierne’s dragoons, move south to ambush the Dano-Norwegian army on its rear and flank. Löwen’s ambush force had initially escaped the attention of the Dano-Norwegian command, permitting the Swedes to move unnoticed for nearly three days. However, by noon 28 March 1716 Lieutenant General Barthold Heinrich von Lützow had received intelligence about the large Swedish cavalry force. Lützow immediately dispatched a part of Colonel Johan Wilhelm von Ötken’s 2nd Søndenfjeldske Dragoon Regiment towards Ringerike to halt the Swedish advance. Captain Jürgen Christoph von Koppelow, Captain Knud Sehestad and Lieutenant Peder Tønder Collin were tasked with intercepting the Swedes as quickly as possible.Faye, A. \\"Carl XII og hans Angreb paa Norge 1716 og 1718\\" Historisk Tidsskrift, Bind 3.

A reconnaissance search of the area revealed that the entire Swedish force had camped at Norderhov manse, a clerical estate located only a few kilometers to the north. The Dano-Norwegian officers held a brief council to decide whether to proceed, or to wait for the larger backup force riding under Colonel Ötken. It was decided that the element of surprise outweighed the numerical inferiority of the dragoons vis-a-vis the Swedish force.Nilssen, F.

The guard positions were neutralised, and the dragoons moved within a stone’s throw from Norderhov until the entirety of the 150 men strong dragoon body moved into full gallop onto the Swedish encampent.Tverran, Frank. \\"300 år siden 'Svenskeslaget'\\" Ringerike Historielag (2016) By the morning of 29 March Colonel Ötken and the main force of the dragoons had arrived at Norderhov. Commander Löwen had been taken prisoner together with a sizeable segment of the Swedish force, while the remaining troops had fled into the woods and surrounding countryside. Forced to contend with a string of losses, Sweden’s invasion initiative was seriously hampered. =Dragoon regiment command= Von Koppelow was described by a peer in Christiania in 1731 as a \\"vigilant and quick-minded officer, and of great talent.\\"Anker, C.

Dr. Hafez identifies with what he calls the \\"racism studies-informed postcolonial approach\\" in studying Islamophobia.\\"Engineering a European Islam: An Analysis of Attempts to Domesticate European Muslims in Austria, France, and Germany.\\" Insight Turkey Quarterly Research and Information Journal with Focus on Turkey. 20.3 (2018): 131-56. \\"Many of the measures taken to regulate Islam- state relations reveal an approach that on one side attempts to give Islam a place in their society, while on the other side clearly refers to a stereotypical imagination of the Muslim, where the notion of Europe stands for enlightenment, modernity and progressiveness, while Islam and Muslims represent the opposite. Hence, we can observe a notion of ‘civilizing’ Islam that goes back to colonial times and introduces a division between the good and the bad Muslim; the former who submits to the state and its rules, versus the latter, who remains the uncivilized, barbaric, alien Muslim, prone to extremisms and fanaticism and incapable of fitting into modernity. The Islam dispositives revealed here show that the states legitimize their interference based on this implicitly reproduced imagination of the bad Muslims, and thus endeavor to ‘civilize’ Muslims subjects, reminding us again of the “white man’s burden.”\\"\\"Engineering a European Islam: An Analysis of Attempts to Domesticate European Muslims in Austria, France, and Germany.\\" Insight Turkey Quarterly Research and Information Journal with Focus on Turkey. 20.3 (2018): 131-56. In one of his major recent essays, Hafez, F. \\"Unwanted Identities: The ‘Religion Line’ and Global Islamophobia.\\" Development. 63.1 (2020): 9-19. Dr. Hafez also states that “Islamophobia constitutes a major racist discourse today and illustrates how we can make sense of this global relevance of Islamophobia. The author explains the centrality of the ‘religion line’ in the current global world system by drawing on the post-Cold War era. Through a decolonial reading of Islamophobia, three empirical cases are chosen to discuss differences and commonalities between various forms of Islamophobia in the Xingjiang/China, Egypt, and the USA exploring the effects of this global phenomenon on the discursive construction of identities, citizenship rights, and governance.” For Hafez, there is a central role of Islamophobia by referring to the works of scholars who advise the US political elite and regularly inform the US public in regard to US politics in the Middle East such as “Bernard Lewis and Fareed Zakaria.” Hafez, F. \\"Unwanted Identities: The ‘Religion Line’ and Global Islamophobia.\\" Development. 63.1 (2020): 9-19. With the American scholar Stephen Sheehi https://stephensheehi.com/, Dr. Hafez believes that an additional reason why “Islamophobia has become engrained in American culture and its political unconscious is that Islamophobia operates in a society with its own troubled history of racism. The United States has a sustained history not only of the dehumanization, disenfranchisement and occupation of Blacks, Native Americans, and Asians but also of transforming this racist hate into political action, with hunts and pogroms to control dissent and discontent. Islamophobia has now been interwoven within this same history.” Hafez, F. \\"Unwanted Identities: The ‘Religion Line’ and Global Islamophobia.\\" Development. 63.1 (2020): 9-19. and Sheehi, Stephen. 2011. Islamophobia: The Ideological Campaign Against Muslims. Atlanta, GA: Clarity Press. Sheehi is the Sultan Qaboos Professor of Middle East Studies and Professor of Arab Studies at the College of William and Mary. For Hafez, the conclusion is: “To conclude, we can argue that Islamophobia is a means of gaining, stabilizing, and widening power for the US empire. Through this lens, 9/11 was only a confirmation of the clash of civilizations-theory that had already preceded the terrorist attacks on the Manhattan Twin Towers. It allowed for an expansion of this colonial structure. “Hafez, F. \\"Unwanted Identities: The ‘Religion Line’ and Global Islamophobia.\\" Development. 63.1 (2020): 9-19.

This seriously questions the right to freedom of expression and thought in Europe. According to the editors of the EIR, even the public discussion of the political Islam of the Muslim Brotherhood and other radical currents should be prevented. They are not concerned with an open democratic debate, but with preventing it. We suspect that the EIR’s publishers have the long-term goal of influencing the legislation of the EU and its member states with the help of a Turkish, government-friendly foundation that acts as an NGO so that a critical examination of political Islam is impossible. The signatories reject this attempt at censorship.\\" Commissioner Johannes Hahn answered a questionnaire saying: \\"The EU rules governing grant awards, in particular transparency and equal treatment, were respected in the selection process.

She is also an activist on Muslim issues including female integration and extremism, and has written numerous texts discussing Islam and politics.  Early life  Khankan was born in Denmark in 1974, to a Syrian father and a Finnish mother. Her father was a political refugee and a feminist. Khankan studied in Damascus and returned to Denmark in 2000. She sees herself as being born between two worlds and considers her goal to reconcile opposites. She holds a Masters in Sociology of Religion and Philosophy from the University of Copenhagen.  Career  Khankan led the foundation of the Mariam Mosque in Copenhagen. The mosque differs from other Danish mosques because it is led by women. Normally, women would watch religious ceremonies from a balcony. Similar women-led mosques exist in the US, Canada, and Germany but, in Denmark, this was novel. Khankan founded Critical Muslims, an organisation to link religion and politics. In 2007, she published a book titled Islam and Reconciliation - A Public Matter. Khankan notes that Christianity, Jewish, and Muslim institutions have become patriarchal, and she sees women-run mosques as a challenge to this tradition. She has had some moderate opposition but, in general, she says the reception has been supportive. The mosque opened in February 2016 and held its first formal service that August. Khankan gave the call to prayer and 60 women gathered above a fast food shop. Another imam, Saliha Marie Fetteh, took the service where she spoke on the subject of women and Islam. The new mosque has conducted several weddings. The mosque marries couples of different religions, which some mosques will not allow. She stood for parliament as a candidate for the Danish Social Liberal Party. Khankan was named one of the BBC's 100 Women of 2016.  Personal  Khankan has two daughters and two sons. She is divorced.

Printed in Roman type and in fonic-shorthand. was a nineteenth century American shorthand inventor and promoter. Her simplified alphabet, arranged in the basis of Isaac Pitman's Phonography, was the subject of Mark Twain's essay A Simplified Alphabet.  Biography  She was born Eliza Boardman in Essex, England; her parents were John Boardman and Anna Thomason. She moved with her family to the United States in 1837. She was married twice and had four children. As a librarian and the 'mother' of women stenographers, Burnz championed spelling reform and founded the Burnz' Fonic Shorthand in 1869. Burnz claimed no originality in its method, as it was based on Isaac Pitman's method, which she had become familiar with in 1846. The Burnz system's best feature was its ability to enable the writer to write with legibility and speed. In 1872, she began teaching shorthand at Cooper Union and the Young Women's Christian Association. Burnz was a suffragist and promoted Dianism, a sexual practice which permits sexual contact without ejaculation. Burnz died June 19, 1903 in Walters Park, Pennsylvania.

He was the son of President Grover Cleveland. Whittaker Chambers considered him critical to the successful outcome of the Hiss Case.  Early life  Cleveland was born in Princeton, New Jersey, the eldest son of Grover Cleveland, the 22nd and 24th President of the United States, and Frances Folsom. He was born nearly eight months after the end of his father's second term, and was named for his grandfather, Richard Falley Cleveland. He was the next to youngest of five siblings: sisters Ruth (1891–1904), Esther (1893–1980), and Marion (1895–1977), and brother Francis Grover (1903–1995). He attended Phillips Exeter Academy and in 1915, he entered Princeton University, became freshman class president, and played on the freshman football team.  Career  US Marines at Scott Belleau Wood. In 1916 or 1917, Cleveland broke off studies and joined the U.S. Marine Corps during World War I. In 1918, he joined the U.S. diplomatic corps and served in six months in Beijing (then still called \\"Peking\\") as military attache at the U.S. legation. Later that year, he returned to Princeton and graduated in 1919. In 1921, he obtained an MA from Princeton and then enrolled in Harvard Law School. =Law= Baltimore Trust Building In 1924, he joined the law firm of Semmes, Bowen & Semmes in Baltimore, Maryland. He worked there throughout his career. Though he retired in 1969, he continued to work part-time at the firm until his death in 1974. During those years, Semmes, Bowen and Semmes occupied the twenty-first floor at 10 Light Street, at what was called the \\"Baltimore Trust Building,\\" then the tallest building south of Manhattan (now the \\"Bank of America Building\\"). =Hiss Case= During the Hiss Case (1948–1950), Cleveland represented Time senior editor Whittaker Chambers. In his memoir, Chambers recalled of him: > The names of a number of other Baltimore attorneys were given me from which > to make my choice of counsel. I listened to as many first-hand opinions as > possible about all of them. Then I decided on the man whom I had decided on > the first time that I read over the list—Richard F. Cleveland, the youngest > son of the former President of the United States, Grover Cleveland, and a > partner in the Baltimore law firm of Semmes, Bowen and Semmes. > Until his name was handed to me, I had never heard of him. Yet it is hard to > imagine that any other man could conceivably have filled the role that was > thrust upon this quiet, deliberate, shrewd, deeply devout and deeply > understanding gentleman. From the first, he sensed that there was something > missing in the Hiss Case. From the moment that I confirmed his intuition and > told him what that missing factor was—espionage—he grasped the Case in its > full meaning. He understood exactly what I had to do and why I was doing it. > Twice, at least, his words reaching me when he himself was not present, bore > me up in critical moments. His letter, which was handed me by the FBI a few > moments before I went in to testify in the first Hiss trial, offering me the > support of a shared understanding and the force of his prayers, was a > powerful help to me during my public evisceration by Lloyd Paul Stryker. The > other occasion was of a kind that no man could ever forget. It occurred in > December 1948, during my days before the Grand Jury, when the outcry against > me was deafening. Richard Cleveland and his wife had driven from Baltimore > to our farm. If any conscious factor had influenced my choice of Cleveland > as my lawyer, it was my respect for his father. To my gentle wife for whom > in her loneliness that dark moment was darker than for me, Cleveland said in > his gentle way: \\"In many ways, Whittaker reminds me of my father.\\" It was, > of course, the measure of Richard Cleveland, not of me. Chambers was impressed by Cleveland's legal acuity: > I was sitting alone one day with Richard Cleveland. Once more he led me over > parts of the story. After a time, he paused and gazed off toward Druid Hill > Park. \\"You feel, don't you, that there is something missing?\\" I asked. \\"I > was discussing the case with my wife last night,\\" he said, \\"and we both > agreed that there was something missing.\\" \\"There is something missing,\\" I > said. \\"I am shielding Hiss.\\" Cleveland glanced at me over his half-glasses > as he sometimes did. \\"Espionage,\\" I said. =Politics= Cleveland supported the presidential candidacies of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Alfred M. Landon, Wendell L. Wilkie, and Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1967, he served as a delegate to the Maryland Constitutional Convention. Personal life In 1923, Cleveland married Ellen Douglass Gailor (d. 1954), daughter of Thomas F. Gailor, an Episcopal bishop in Tennessee, after having met her abroad. Ellen, a teacher, was a graduate of Vassar College and Columbia University, where she received a master's degree. Before divorcing in 1940 due to Ellen's alcoholism, they had three children: *Anne Mary Cleveland *Thomas Grover Cleveland *Charlotte Gailor Cleveland In 1943, he married Jessie Maxwell Black, the daughter of Capt. and Mrs. George Crosbie Black. They had three children: *Frances Black Cleveland *George Maxwell Cleveland *Margaret Folsom Cleveland He used the desk his father had used in the White House as president, and so it remained in the offices of Semmes, Bowen & Semmes because he was still working there as emeritus partner at the firm in 1974 when he died. Cleveland was rather relieved upon meeting Chambers, as Chambers recounted: > My first interview with Cleveland and Macmillan was chiefly to give them a > chance to look me over and to listen to my story before they decided to > accept me as a client. I found that I came as something of a relief. \\"To > tell the truth,\\" said Cleveland as we parted that first day, \\"Bill and I > were a little worried. When we heard that you were an ex-Communist, we > expected a wild-eyed man without a necktie. You are quite a surprise. His first wife, Ellen, died in 1954. He died in Baltimore on January 10, 1974, of chronic pulmonary illness. He is buried at Fowlers Mill Cemetery in Tamworth, New Hampshire.

Engström got familiar already at early age with large machinery and engineering workshop environment due to his stepfather's work as engineer in the Finnish State Railways. After completing his mechanical engineering studies in Helsinki Polytechnic School in 1877, Engström went to gain experience abroad in Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom and United States. Upon his return in 1884, Engström got vacance in the State Railways. He took successfully part in steam locomotive designing, which was followed by railway projects in Savonia and Karelia. He worked as director for stone company Ab Granit in 1889–1895, after which he returned to State Railways for another five years. Engström was appointed manager of Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works in 1900. During his time the company developed rapidly and the sales increased significantly, largely due to Russo-Japanese War and the First World War. On the other hand, the time was difficult due to increased strikes and confrontation between the workers and employers. Engström left his position as company manager in 1918; this was affected by the death of his son in the previous Finnish Civil War.  Early life  Adolf Engström was born in Vörå, Ostrobothnia. His parents were land surveyor Leonhard Engström and Adolfina née Taxell, who was daughter of Messukylä vicar Jonas Gabriel Taxell. The couple had two daughters and sons Adolf and Otto. Leonhard Engström died when Adolf was four years old, and the widow married her late husband's older brother Carl Petter Engström, who was Mechanical Engineer. The family moved to Helsinki in 1862, and the Ostrobothnian boy had to adopt to a new environment. The stepfather worked for the Finnish State Railways, and that way Adolf got familiar with engineering workshops and large machinery during his childhood. C. P. Engström became Chief Engineer in the State Railways in 1870 and during 1877–1890 he was board member in railway administration.  Studies and early career  Engström graduated from Helsinki Swedish Normal Lyceum in 1874 and continued his studies in Helsinki Polytechnic School and graduated Mechanical Engineer in 1877. He wanted to gain abroad useful practical experience abroad, which he could later use for developing his home country. Engström first worked for Motala Engineering Works in Sweden as draftsman, and then in Germany for Hannoversche Maschinenbau AG and Hohenzollern Locomotive Works. He went next to England, where he worked for Beyer Peacock & Co in Manchester. Engström's following step was the United States; he worked for Pennsylvania Railroad Company Altoona Works.  State Railways  In 1884 Engström returned to Finland, for State Railways, to take part in a locomotive project. The target was to design a locomotive suitable for Oulu railway; it should be firewood compatible and also stronger and more fuel efficient, than a type used on Nikolaistad railway. Engström redesigned the firebox and made the structure more robust. This locomotive type was produced total 104 units. After the Oulu railway was built, Engström continued in Savonian and Karelian railway projects. He worked for State Railways until 1889. Engström returned to State Railways for 1895–1900 to work as engineering workshop manager's assistant.  Ab Granit  As there were no new railway development projects, Engström sought for new opportunities. In 1889 he was appointed director and technical manager of Ab Granit, which was a stone company in Hanko. The company had gained foothold in construction business in Helsinki and grown amongst 30 largest companies of Finland. At the turn of the 1890s the company employed 268 people. The 1894 erected Tsar Alexander II statue in Senate Square, of which foundation was constructed by Granit, promoted the company's sales in Russia.  Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works  Engström was appointed manager of Sandvikens Skeppsdocka och Mekaniska Verkstads Ab (\\"Hietalahti Shipyard and Engineering Works\\") in 1900. He followed engineer Edvin Bergroth, who was the first manager of the company that was re-established after bankruptcy. Bergroth had developed the operations through investments, and Engström received leadership of a financially solid company, which he continued developing determinedly.Osakeyhtiö Hietalahden...: Toiminta uuden vuosisadan aikana. Vuodet 1901–1914. pp. 58–77. Engström sometimes faced situations which needed quick decisions – he for example received repair work of a shipwrecked vessel which was too large to the dock; the dock was extended during the salvage process. The Russo-Japanese War in 1904–1905 led to increased order intake of torpedo boats for the Imperial Russian Navy. During 1900–1914 the company built total about 60 steam and motor vessels. In addition to shipbuilding, the company produced large number of ship engines, steam boilers and also railway wagons. Engström's personal contribution was significant in the rolling stock production, and the wagon projects balanced the wintertime docking workload drop. Engström developed and modernised the shipyard; this meant new methods, as electrical welding and pneumatic tools. The dock was further extended in 1910 and 1912 and a new brass foundry was taken into use in 1914. Two years later a new main engineering workshop was opened. Prior to the First World War, the company employed 597 people and the annual sales reached 2.4 million marks. The First World War increased the business again; during 1915–1917 the company docked total 400 vessels. Engström had also further plans which did not actualise, such as a new dock layout, that would have enabled building many large ships simultaneously. All the investments were funded by company profit, and the company did not collect capital from outside during that. By 1919, when Engström left his position, the share capital had grown from half million to six million marks. Engström's era as shipyard leader was the time of organisation of labour and employers. The yard experienced some occasional strikes at the late 19th century, and after the yard faced larger strikes and conflicts in 1902, Engström called other engineering industry employers to negotiate about forming an employers' association. The first general collective agreement between the union and employers was signed in 1906. Already in 1908 the employers planned to end the agreements because they had not put an end to striking. At the beginning Engström supported collective agreements, but changed his mind in 1909. This led to a long-term strike, which eventually ended to defeat for the union – the engineering industry workers returned to work without having a collective agreement. Consequently, the relations between employers' association and trade unions suffered badly.  Organisational activities  Engström was founding member of the 1903 created Finnish Engineering Industry Employers' Association and deputy chairman until 1911, after which he served as chairman until 1919. He also took part in founding the Swedish Technical Science Academy of Finland and he became honorary member of the Finnish Technical Association in 1920. During 1903–1911 he was member of Helsinki City Council.

Their only son died in the Finnish Civil War in 1918. This made Engström to leave his position as company manager. The couple donated a large sum to be shared as scholarships to young technicians, who were orientated to shipbuilding and engineering industry.

In 2018, the distillery's Duality Double Malt Whiskey became Georgia's first-ever Double Gold Medal Whiskey, as judged by the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. Distillery and tasting room The distillery operates, along with a tasting room, in 6,500 square feet of a retrofitted industrial space in Atlanta's Armour Yard district, near SweetWater Brewery. Distillation ASW Distillery makes its spirits in small batches, predominantly in copper pot stills, including a 500-gallon wash still and a 300-gallon spirit still manufactured by the Louisville, Kentucky-based Vendome Copper & Brass Works. In addition to the spirits ASW Distillery distills at its Atlanta facility, it has a line of whiskies sourced from across the country that the distillery then finishes in-house, known as Fiddler. For the spirits that ASW Distillery distills on-site, the distillery works with smoked malts, uses corn from Riverview Farms in Ranger, Georgia, apples from north Georgia, and staves from oak trees that the company hand-harvested in Jackson County, Georgia. Products American Spirit Whiskey was the first commercial offering from ASW Distillery, introduced to the Atlanta market in late 2011. American Spirit Whiskey is not distilled in Atlanta, but is an 80 proof spirit whiskey distilled in Charleston, South Carolina using a recipe created by the founders of ASW Distillery in 2010. It is described as having \\"a soft minerality to it and, like the nose, a slight fruitiness.\\" Fiddler Bourbon was the first bourbon offering from ASW Distillery, introduced to the Atlanta market in late 2016. Fiddler Unison Bourbon is a marriage of a high-malt bourbon distilled in Atlanta and a \\"foraged\\" high-wheat bourbon.

It was a fully integral coach, unlike most contemporary British designs which had a separate body and chassis, and was notable for its streamlined design with a sloping upper windscreen and a , hence the model designation. History In the early 1980s the British coach market underwent considerable change, putting pressure on the established British coachbuilding firms which had previously dominated the market. In the 1970s the great majority of coaches sold in the UK had comprised a British-built chassis with separately assembled bodywork by one of the two dominant domestic coachbuilders, Duple and Plaxton. The highest sales volumes were achieved by lightweight chassis such as the Bedford Y series and Ford R series, and even imported chassis such as the Volvo B58 usually carried Duple or Plaxton coachwork. However, the 1980s saw a move away from lightweights towards heavier and more sophisticated designs, increasingly supplied by foreign chassis and bodywork manufacturers. Some of the foreign coaches now selling in Britain were of integral construction, and Duple wished to produce an integral design of its own to compete more effectively with these. The first attempts were a pair of prototypes built in 1983, one of which was a semi-integral variant of the Duple Caribbean body built on German Auwärter Neoplan N716 running gear, which remained a one-off. The other prototype employed Dutch BOVA Europa running gear within a unique style of semi-integral body known as the Duple Calypso, and a further 50 production vehicles of this type were built for the 1984 season. However, in June 1983 Duple had been sold to the Hestair Group, which had previously acquired the British chassis manufacturer Dennis Brothers of Guildford. Duple was renamed Hestair Duple, and rather than persisting with semi-integrals built on third party running gear it was decided to develop a fully integral coach with running units from sister company Hestair Dennis. As a result the Duple 425 was developed, and production commenced in 1985. The 425 had a rear-mounted Cummins or DAF engine with automatic transmission, and a typical layout seated 57 passengers (or 53 with a toilet fitted), which was a relatively high capacity for a 12 metre coach at the time. Plaxton 425 Sales of the 425 were limited with only about 130 vehicles being completed, although many of them enjoyed unusually long service lives. Most of Duple's output continued to be conventional bodies on third-party chassis, but overall sales volumes continued to decline leading to financial pressures. In November 1988, the coachbuilding business was sold and renamed Duple International. In July 1989 the Blackpool factory was closed down, and the manufacturing rights and jigs for Duple coach products sold to its main domestic competitor, Plaxton, for £4 million. The 425 design was modified by Plaxton and re-entered production in 1991 as the Plaxton 425, which was assembled by Plaxton's French subsidiary Carrosserie Lorraine. However the Lorraine factory closed in 1992 after only 12 further 425 models had been built.

The accident killed all twenty people on board. The death toll was equal to that of another cable car accident in Italy which occurred one year previously. The disaster remains the deadliest cable car accident in France, and one of the deadliest such incidents anywhere in the world. Accident details In the early morning hours of 1 July 1999, twenty staff members who worked at the Plateau de Bure Astronomical Observatory boarded a gondola which was serviced by an aerial tramway owned by the company. All twenty people on board the gondola were of French nationality, and included five astronomers, nine construction workers, four technicians, and two maintenance workers. At approximately 07:15 local time, when the cable car had traveled from its starting point, the car detached from the cable and plunged onto the rocky slopes of the valley beneath it. The cable car disintegrated on impact, killing everyone on board. Aftermath According to the chief representative of the cable car company, Jean-Charles Simiand, the aerial tramway was built in 1981. He said that it was \\"working in perfect order\\" prior to the accident, as it had recently passed an inspection. Simiand indicated that Apav, a private engineering firm, had carried out the last major inspection of the cable car in 1998. During the inspection each part of the cable car was evaluated, including the cabin, cables, motors, and pylons. He stated that major inspections of the gondolas take place every five years once they are commissioned. Witnesses reported that it seemed as though one of the cables holding the car had snapped. Local officials stated that the gondola broke free from two of the three cables which supported it, causing the third cable to collapse. However, the prefect of the Hautes-Alpes region, Remi Caron, told a press conference that it seemed as though the car unhooked itself from the cables for an unknown reason. Initially, the state prosecutor demanded a six month prison sentence for eight maintenance workers at the observatory, for their contributing roles in the accident. However, nearly five years after the accident, the court acquitted five maintenance workers at the observatory of charges related to their actions which contributed to the accident. The Plateau de Bure Astronomical Observatory was fined €200,000 ($209,700 USD). €130,000 ($136,305 USD) of this fine was later dropped. Three maintenance workers at the observatory were convicted on negligence charges. Aldo Oberti was the maintenance engineer who removed the safety brake from the cable car, allowing it to accelerate uncontrollably along the cable and slip off it. Oberti received a 30 month suspension from cable car operations (which was later reduced to 24 months), and was also ordered to pay a €10,000 ($10,485 USD) fine for his role in the accident. Édouard Ponchier, the cable car inspector, also received a 30 month suspension from operations, as well as a five year ban from being allowed to inspect cable cars. Ponchier was also fined €12,000 ($12,582 USD). In addition, Marinus de Jonge, the former director of the Plateau de Bure Astronomical Observatory, received the same sentence as Ponchier, along with a €15,000 ($15,728 USD) fine.

The library is currently located on the NCF campus along US 41 Tamiami Trail right next door to the Ringling Museum. In addition to serving USFSM and NCF, this facility also accommodates to the community by allowing modest borrowing privileges and Wi-Fi usage.  History  = Library = Originally, the New College Library was maintained in College Hall, the mansion left over from Charles and Edith Ringling, and was converted in the mid 1960s from living space to learning space. The acquisition of books was fairly quick and the collection grew to around 27,000 volumes within the first three years. When the request was made to make the conversion, there wasn’t a perceived need even for a new library building, this however changed soon as space in the mansion was running out quickly for materials plus there was still a need for much more materials as well. In 1975 the school became part of the State University System allowing for many more sharing opportunities for the library and in the mid 1980s the colleges (USF and NCF) together with the New College Foundation with its many supporters managed to amass enough capital to construct a new library which would be shared with USF. It received its name officially two years later as the Jane Bancroft Cook library and remains a shared library between the two institutions. = Jane Bancroft Cook = Jane Bancroft Cook Portrait and Book Stacks Above Jane Bancroft Cook, sometimes mentioned as the Dow Jones heiress, was a prolific philanthropist giving to many campuses across the United States. She moved to Sarasota in the early 1950s and as time progressed she found herself more and more involved with the town; Cook served on the Resource Center's Board of Directors for Sarasota County in the late 1980s and was even a trustee for the college and foundation. The JBC Library holds tribute to her name and her contributions to the school overall.  Offerings  The Jane Bancroft Cook Library uses the Library of Congress Call Number system and holds its main circulating collection of physical books on the second floor, beginning in the far northwest corner with the Juvenile section. This proceeds to the DVD stacks coupled with alternative media such as audiobook cassettes and CDs, and VHS videos followed by musical CDs. The rest of the general collection then starts at A and wraps around the northeast corner, then heads south and wraps around the southeast corner where it stops at Z and the Oversized collection. In this area there are tables, soft furniture, and study carrels. Downstairs, where the lobby can be found, is where the Circulation Desk sits. Reserves for classes are located here and it is also the location for interlibrary loan or UBorrow pick-ups. The large selection of physical periodicals is located on the first floor as well. There is a section where the Faculty/Alumnus Authored and Writer in Residence works are on display, and on the far side of the periodical shelves, there is the Dr. Helen N. Fagin Collection for Holocaust Genocide Humanitarian Studies. Physical copies of undergraduate student theses are also located on the first floor (digital copies published in 2009 up to the present can be found on the library's Student Theses page). Dr. Helen N. Fagin Collection The library houses many other areas of specialized studies including the Writing Resource Center, the Qualitative Resource Center (these first two operated mostly by students), Educational Technology Services, Language Resource Center, Study Abroad, and the Center for Engagement and Opportunities. Lastly, the JBC Library also has regular study rooms available to check out, many computer stations (PC and Mac) for active students, staff, and faculty of NCF and USF, a 'Collab' room for open group collaborations, a silent study room, a workshop room available by appointment, and a section displaying the Student Theses. = Collection = The Collection stands around 280,000 volumes, 400 serial titles, has access through UBorrow to lend and borrow from all the institutions in the State University System and Illiad which allows borrowing and lending from institutions world-wide. USF is able to contribute, in addition to books of their own in the library's stacks, access to hundreds of Ebooks and databases ranging from dissertations to news articles and full-text academic journals. = Users = The Jane Bancroft cook facilitates to active USF and NCF Students, Faculty, and Staff. Faculty receives a checkout length of one academic year, Students and staff receive an academic semester, and community members that have applied for and obtained a guest borrower pass are allowed three weeks with their loan. Media for all borrowers are allowed a week.

In his role as creator and publisher of the books, Warrell was known pseudonymously as Big Chief I-Spy. Life and career Warrell was born in Farmborough, Somerset in 1889. Having trained at Culham College, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, he became the headteacher at Higher Wych School in Cheshire, then later Pleasley Hill School, Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, during the 1940s. He first devised the concept for the I-Spy books in 1948, towards the end of his teaching career. He was an advocate of active learning, and originally created the books as a method of keeping children entertained and stimulated on long car journeys, and making children more aware of the world around them. =I-Spy books= Warrell was initially rejected by eight different publishers, so resorted to publishing the books himself, using his acquaintance with a book-buyer at his local branch of Woolworths to secure that store as a distribution outlet. The books were initially entitled Learning from Life, but Warrell changed the name on the advice of his wife Marian. Each book in the I-Spy series covered a different subject, such as I-SPY Cars, I-SPY on the Pavement, I-SPY Churches, I-SPY on a Train Journey, and so on. As children spotted the objects listed, they recorded the event in the book, and gained points, varying according to how unusual the sight. Once the book was complete, it could be sent to Warrell (known as Big Chief I-SPY) at \\"Wigwam-by-the-Water, EC4\\", for a feather and entry to the order of merit. The children participating in the game were known as The I-SPY Tribe. A success on publication, the books were soon picked up to be published in the Daily Mail and then the News Chronicle, where completed entries were mentioned by name in Warrell's column. By 1953 the I-SPY Tribe had half a million members. The I-SPY Tribe was also an activity club, with events held for members, known as \\"pow-wows\\" and attended by thousands of children, featuring Warrell in a giant Indian head-dress, and one event in London consisting of 8,000 children taking part in sight-seeing tours on 80 hired double-decker buses. By the time Warrell retired in 1956, 18 million copies had been sold. The books continued their popularity, switching between several different publishers over the years, before being taken on by current publisher Michelin Travel Publications in 1991. The original series of books remained in print until the mid-80s, and eventually sold 25 million copies worldwide. After retirement Warrell and his wife settled in Budleigh Salterton, Devon. As old as 93, he was still writing articles for publication in national magazines, and at 104 years old he was reportedly still phoning friends to discuss developments in education. Charles Warrell died in a nursing home in Matlock, Derbyshire in 1995, known to the nursing home staff as Big Chief. He was survived by two daughters from his first marriage, to Elizabeth Gill.

It is also known as the Library of Ivan IV (Ivan the Terrible) to whom it is believed the disappearance of the library is attributed. The lost library is thought to contain rare Greek, Latin, and Egyptian works from the Libraries of Constantinople and Alexandria, as well as second century Chinese texts and manuscripts from Ivan IV's own era. The library has been historically placed as being underneath the Kremlin and has been a source of interest for researchers, archaeologists, treasure hunters, and historical figures such as Peter the Great and Napoleon Bonaparte. Under Ivan IV's rule the library's legend had grown. Myths surrounding the library include Ivan cursing the library before his death, causing blindness to those that came close to locating the library, and Ivan attempting to have scholars translate the ancient texts in order to gain knowledge of black magic.  History  The earliest reference to the lost library was in 1518 when Michail Tripolis known widely as Maximus the Greek was sent to Russia and came into contact with Moscow Grand Prince Vasili III, the son of Ivan III. Tripolis' reputation as a scholar and translator of works like the Psalter into Russian brought him to the attention of Vasili III. It was in a meeting between Michail and Vasili wherein it is described that \\"countless multitudes of Greek books\\" were shown to Michail by Vasili III. A Russian contemporary of Michail wrote a biography of him called \\"The Tale of Maxim the Philosopher.\\" This biographer, Prince Kurbskii, a member of the Moscow nobility, detailed this meeting between Michail and Vasili III. Kurbskii wrote that \\"Maxim was astounded and impressed, and assured the prince that even in Greece he had never seen so many Greek books.\\" Close to eighty years after Kurbskii wrote Maximus the Greek's biography the next mention of the lost library as well as a location appeared. Livonian writer Franz Nyenstadt wrote about Johannes Wetterman, a German Protestant minister who established a church in Russia and met with Ivan IV. Ivan IV purportedly had been hiding multitudes of weapons underneath the Kremlin. Some of the weapons were actually discovered in 1978 by Soviet construction workers working on the subway. Wetterman was summoned by Ivan IV not to look at a weapons arsenal but to look at ancient books that had been secured in a locked storeroom somewhere inside the Kremlin for well over a hundred years. Wetterman and three other Germans and three Russian officials were told to conduct a survey of the works. Wetterman noted that there were many works present that were only referenced in passing by other scholars because they had been either destroyed in fires or lost during wars previously. Wetterman was offered the opportunity to work with and translate a book found in the survey. Wetterman however was afraid that taking such an assignment would lead to more work which would keep him in Moscow indefinitely. The works were then locked away again in the underground Kremlin perhaps to protect them from potential fires. A 1724 report of Moscow Petty Official Konon Osipov mentions a discovery made by V. Makariev in 1682. Makariev while being ordered to go into a Kremlin secret passage found a room full of trunks. When Makariev reported the find to Princess Sophia Alekseyevna she made it forbidden for anyone to access those rooms.  Search for the Lost Library  In the early nineteenth century, Professor Dabelov of the University of Dorpat (University of Tartu) claimed to have found in the archives of the city of Pernau (Pärnu) a document called \\"Manuscripts Held by the Tsar.\\" Dabelov left Pernau to inform a university associate, Professor Clossius, of the find, yet when returning to the Pernau archives the document had seemingly vanished. The only information left on the document was some of what Dabelov had copied down on his first visit. This information detailed that the tsars had around 800 manuscripts and some of these were gifted to Russia from an unknown Byzantine emperor. In 1834, Professor Clossius wrote on a collection of Russian history including the work of Nikolay Karamzin author of \\"History of the Russian State.\\" Karamzin mentions the meeting between Ivan IV and Protestant minister Wetterman. In Professor Clossius' article, he wrote that he believed the lost library had been destroyed by fires caused by the seventeenth century Polish invasion. In the 1890s, Professor Thraemer of the University of Strasbourg located a manuscript of Homer's hymns that he believed was once a part of the collection of manuscripts brought to Moscow by Byzantine Princess Sophia Palaiologina when she married Ivan III. Ivan III and Sophia married in 1472 and her dowry included a rare collection of books from the Library of Constantinople and Library of Alexandria. For several months in 1891 Professor Thraemer lived in Moscow searching through all of the city's libraries and archives in the hopes of locating the lost library. Thraemer eventually decided that it must be located inside hidden subterranean rooms underneath the Kremlin. In 1893 Professor I.E. Zabelin wrote an article called \\"The Underground Chambers of the Moscow Kremlin\\" where he concluded that the library did exist there but that it was destroyed in the seventeenth century. Around this time some attempts were made at excavating underneath the Kremlin. The excavations found several underground chambers and tunnels but all were found empty. Several Russian scholars of the era also refuted the existence of the library. S.A. Belokurov in 1898 wrote that the \\"Tale of Maxim the Philosopher\\" was not written by Prince Kurbskii, but 75 years after the fact by another monk. Belokurov states that he found enough contradictions and inconsistencies in the Maximus the Greek biography that he believed Maximus never even saw the library. Belokurov also believed that Professor Dabelov's document was a forgery and he refuted other sources as well. In the early twentieth century Archaeologist Ignatius Stelletskii became a seeker of the lost library. A 1929 article of The New York Times details Stelletskii's search. The article reports that Stelletskii found archives showing \\"two large rooms filled with treasure chests and known to exist under the Kremlin\\" half a century after the death of Ivan IV. Also reported is the fact that Protestant Minister Wetterman never returned home after being in Moscow. Ivan IV according to myth had the architect of Saint Basil's Cathedral blinded in order to never be able to recreate it, hiding its secrets. Therefore, Ivan IV involved in Wetterman's disappearance after seeing the library would seem standard protocol. Peter the Great also attempted to locate the library hoping to find treasures that would help the treasury after his several years involved in wars. Stelletskii's search however ended without ever finding the library. S.O. Shmidt in 1978 described an unpublished work by N.N. Zarubin from the 1930s called \\"The Library of Ivan the Terrible and His Books.\\" Zarubin argued that the work of S. Belokurov was not impartial when claiming that the library did not exist. By the 1990s archaeologists broadened their search beyond the Kremlin into Sergiyev Posad, Alexandrov, Vladimir Oblast, and Dyakovo, all places under the influence of Ivan IV.

He was head of the shurṭa (security forces) under caliphs Marwan I and Abd al-Malik, and may have served in the same capacity under their predecessor Caliph Yazid I. He commanded the Kalbi- dominated shurṭa in the Battle of Khazir in 686, and a year later joined the rebellion of the Umayyad prince Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As against Abd al-Malik. After the revolt's failure, Humayd reconciled with the latter. In the years following the battles of Marj Rahit (684) and Khazir, Humayd led the Kalb in numerous tit-for-tat raids and battles with enemy Qaysi tribes, including the Banu Amir, Banu Sulaym and Fazara. Family Humayd ibn Hurayth was a grandson of Bahdal ibn Unayf, the preeminent chieftain of the Banu Kalb tribe. Humayd's family and tribe had kinship ties with the early Umayyad caliphs Mu'awiya I (), Yazid I () and Mu'awiya II () and gained influential positions in the Umayyad state.Crone 1980, p. 93. Humayd's cousins Hassan ibn Malik and Sa'id ibn Malik served as the governors of various Syrian ajnad (military districts) during the reigns of the aforementioned caliphs.Crone 1980, pp. 93–94. Career =Head of security forces= According to medieval historian Ibn Habib, Humayd succeeded Yazid ibn al-Hurr al-Ansi as Caliph Yazid I's ṣāḥib al-shurṭa (head of security forces),Crone 1980, p. 94.Donner ed. Bakhit and Schick 1989, p. 253. a senior Umayyad governmental post;Kennedy 2001, p. 13. the shurṭa served a dual role as the military division that guarded the caliph in battle and the police force of the capital city,Kennedy 2001, p. 17. in this case Damascus. However, most medieval Muslim accounts hold that Yazid ibn al-Hurr died just before Caliph Yazid's reign. Moreover, there are no indications that Humayd served Caliph Yazid in any capacity. However, Humayd is described as the ṣāḥib al-shurṭa of Caliph Marwan I () and continued this role under Caliph Abd al-Malik during the Battle of Khazir in 686; at the time, the shurṭa was dominated by Humayd's Kalbi tribesmen. =Feuds with Qays= The Kalb were the major component of the pro-Umayyad coalition that routed the pro-Zubayrid Qaysi tribes at the Battle of Marj Rahit in 684. In the blood feuds that occurred between Kalb and Qays in the following years, the Kalb were led by Humayd. In general, Humayd's attacks against the Qays were in response to raids by Zufar ibn al-Harith al-Kilabi of the Banu Amir and Umayr ibn al-Hubab al-Sulami of the Banu Sulaym.Wellhausen 1927, p. 201. The latter was an Umayyad commander whose defection during the Battle of Khazir was blamed for the Umayyads' defeat there.Wellhausen 1927, p. 203. The first counter-raid Humayd led was an attack on Palmyra that killed sixty tribesmen of Banu Numayr, a branch of the Amir.Wellhausen 1927, p. 202. This was in retaliation to a raid by the end Amir against Musaiyakh in the Samawah (desert between Iraq and Syria), that killed twenty Kalbi tribesmen. Later, after 686, the Qays under Umayr launched a day-long assault that killed between 500 and 1,000 Kalbi tribesmen at Iqlil in Samawah. Humayd attempted but failed to capture Umayr as they withdrew to their headquarters in al- Qarqisiyah. In another attack by Umayr against the Samawah settlement of Ka'aba, Humayd barely escaped on his horse. After this, Humayd and his tribesmen temporarily evacuated from the Samawah to dwell in the Jordan Valley in Palestine. =Revolt and reconciliation with Abd al-Malik= In 687, Humayd joined the rebel Umayyad prince Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As who seized Damascus and claimed the caliphal throne from Abd al-Malik while the latter was on a military campaign in Jazira. When Abd al-Malik reached Damascus and clashed with Amr's forces, the latter dispatched Humayd as head of his cavalry and another Kalbi, Zuhayr ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi. In response, Abd al-Malik sent out Humayd's cousin Hassan ibn Malik and Zuhayr's brother Sufyan to confront them.Al-Tabari, ed. Fishbein 1990, p. 156. According to a report cited by medieval historian al-Tabari, the two sides fought for an extended period until the women of the Kalb tribe intervened with their children and appealed to Humayd and Sufyan not to kill each other for the sake of the Umayyad family; after another standoff, Humayd ultimately relented and withdrew to Damascus.Al-Tabari, ed. Fishbein 1990, p. 157. Amr was later defeated and executed, but Humayd and Abd al-Malik reconciled. In 689, Abd al-Malik dispatched Humayd, along with Kurayb ibn Abraha Abu Rishdin, to Constantinople to negotiate a treaty with the Byzantine emperor Justinian II. =Feuds with Fazara= By 691, Abd al-Malik conquered Zubayrid-held Iraq and made peace with Zufar, while Umayr had been slain by the Taghlib, an allied tribe of the Banu Kalb. Though Abd al-Malik's arrangements with the Amir and Sulaym precluded further retaliation against them by the Kalb, Humayd decided to avenge his tribe's past losses on another Qaysi tribe, the Fazara.Wellhausen 1927, p. 205. The latter were based in Medina's eastern countryside and had not taken part in the Qaysi–Kalbi war, but by dint of their tribal affiliation and possible assistance to the Amir and Sulaym, they became an alternative target for Humayd. The latter obtained a government warrant to collect the cattle tax from the Fazara, which he used as a cover for a punitive expedition. With a massive Kalbi coalition consisting of the Ulaym and Abd Wadd clans, Humayd led assaults that killed and wounded numerous Fazari tribesmen, particularly at a place called Ah.Wellhausen 1927, p. 206. In retaliation, the Fazara killed nearly seventy Kalbi tribesmen at Banat Qayn in the Samawah .

His disappearance was investigated by the police in Dubai and by the Royal Navy. In 2014, the Royal Navy issued a death certificate listing death by drowning, despite there being no evidence of this and contrary to his wife's wishes. Disappearance MacColl was serving aboard the Type 23 frigate as part of the ship's seven-month security mission in the Middle East. The ship docked in Port Rashid, Dubai on 26 May 2012 and left four days after MacColl's disappearance on 31 May. MacColl spent an earlier part of the day swimming at the Seafarers Mission in Dubai before he and some of his shipmates went out drinking in the town. The last time that MacColl was accounted for was when they were at the Rock Bottom Café in the Deira area of Bur Dubai. MacColl was put into a taxi to take him back to the ship at 2:00 am local time by some of his shipmates. The drive time between the Rock Bottom Café and where HMS Westminster was docked was about 15 minutes. He never made it on board the ship and there have been possible sightings of MacColl getting into a taxi at 3:00 am local time to head back into Bur Dubai. Investigation The Royal Navy reported him missing later that same day. An investigation was launched by the Dubai Police Force and two Counter Terrorism Command officers from the United Kingdom were flown out to Dubai to assist in this. Members of HMS Westminster walked the route that the taxi should have taken between the Rock Bottom Café and the location of the ship's berth and also talked to local people in the area. The port area was searched by divers, dogs and helicopters with heat-seeking equipment, but nothing was found. The police in Dubai interviewed the taxi driver who dropped MacColl off at a tea shack in the port area. Checks were made at police stations, hospitals, mortuaries, medical centres and prisons with there being no record of him. His wife Rachael said that the disappearance was completely out of character and that she had arranged to talk to her husband via Skype later on in the same day that he went missing. Despite not Skypeing with his wife as arranged, Rachael MacColl was not informed of his disappearance for 72 hours, something that she has criticized the Royal Navy for. MacColl's family have also been openly critical of the Royal Navy and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's investigation into his disappearance. They say that they have often been met with a wall of silence, that no information is being passed along and that the Ministry of Defence prevented MacColl's shipmates from wearing yellow ribbons as a tribute to their missing co-worker. Rachael MacColl and Neil Cunningham (MacColl's uncle, who is a detective constable in Hampshire) flew out to Dubai in January 2013. After the new witnesses came forward, they asked MacColl's former shipmates if they knew anything at all. Cunningham was quoted as saying \\"197 members of the ship's company in and around Dubai for eight days - I'm sure there's more information that can assist us and encourage the Dubai Police to carry on the investigation.\\" Theories The belief held by the Royal Navy is that MacColl fell into the sea near to where HMS Westminster was berthed, and drowned. This is what they have recorded on his death certificate. However, a new theory came to light when new witnesses recalled seeing another taxi turn up at the ship with MacColl getting in and returning to Dubai. Subsequent events When HMS Westminster returned to dock in the United Kingdom at Portsmouth, the crew were instructed to leave a space when they stand on the deck as they were cheered on by family and friends. The lining of the deck, known as Procedure Alpha, is traditional when returning to port for Royal Navy ships. In February 2013, Rachael MacColl closed down the Facebook group associated with her husband's disappearance. The group had attracted over 100,000 people and offered up lots of information, but Rachael MacColl said that it just reminded her of what she and her children had lost. By that point, it had been over a year since the family had last seen Timothy MacColl due to him setting sail for the naval mission that HMS Westminster was undertaking. Rachael MacColl described the website as having an adverse effect on all of their lives. Two years later, in May 2014, Leading Seaman MacColl was declared dead. His death certificate lists his death as being due to drowning. His wife maintains that MacColl \\"is disappeared, not missing\\" and contested the notion that he died by drowning and disagreed with the Navy about declaring death. The Navy maintain that this was necessary to enable his wife to claim his pension, and she was also served notice that she must vacate her military Service Family Accommodation (SFA) at Gosport as she no longer had an entitlement to it, as is normal procedure for all spouses. A headstone has been erected in Haslar Royal Naval Cemetery in Gosport, Hampshire.

The AI learns from each drawing, increasing its ability to guess correctly in the future. The game is similar to Pictionary in that the player only has a limited time to draw (20 seconds). The concepts that it guesses can be simple, like 'foot', or more complicated, like 'animal migration'. This game is one of many simple games created by Google that are AI based as part of a project known as 'A.I. Experiments'. Gameplay The player starts with an object to draw (for example it may say \\"Draw a chair in under 20 seconds\\"). Then the player has twenty seconds to draw that object. Based on what they draw, the AI guesses what they are drawing. When the drawing is close enough to the item they were given to draw, it will say something like \\"I know, it's a chair!\\" and the player will be moved on to the next round.

Butler and Robert Finch. The design became one of the most popular sailing keelboats of all time and was built from 1971 to 1991. Production The boat was built by Catalina Yachts in the United States starting in 1971 and was also built under licence in Canada. In the first three years of production, 1500 boats were completed and sold. A total of 6662 examples were completed. The design was replaced in production by the Catalina 270 in 1991. Design Catalina 27 The Catalina 27 is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass. It has a masthead sloop rig, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder and a fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast. Designed for inland sailing and not ocean passages, the boat's hull is made from solid fiberglass, while the deck has a plywood core. The hull and other parts were built with molded headliners to streamline production. Early boats were all fitted with a tiller, but later ones had a wheel steering as optional. The boat has a draft of with the standard keel and with the optional shoal draft wing keel. The boat was originally fitted with an outboard motor well, but some later ones were equipped with inboard Universal Atomic 4 gasoline or Universal diesel engines. The boat has a PHRF racing average handicap of 204 with a high of 207 and low of 204. It has a hull speed of . Operational history Catalina 27 Catalina 27s have been sailed from the mainland US to Bermuda and the Caribbean, and have also carried out globe circumnavigations. In a 2002 review of the design as a used boat, Sail magazine writer John Kretschmer noted: \\"you don't buy a Catalina 27 for the craftsmanship, you buy it to have fun on the water ... One of the most surprising features of the 27 is how nicely it sails. The boat is fairly well balanced, and according to several owner reports, thrives upwind in moderate conditions. In heavy air the 27 is a bit tender and one owner suggests putting the first reef in the main at 12 knots.\\" He concluded, \\"The Catalina 27 didn't become one of the most popular boats ever built without good reason.

The draft bill was presented to parliament on 7 March with the provisions passed on 27 March. Overview =Betting= Horse racing courses and greyhound tracks were forced to limit their race days to a maximum 104 per annum whereas previously they were able to race on an unlimited basis. On course bookmakers and totalisators were also restricted to betting on a maximum of 104 days per annum. Power was given to local councils to issue (and revoke or refuse) the betting licences required and the 104 appointed days of trading must be published in advance. The racecourse and tracks were to charge on course bookmakers a specified admission price and it was illegal for under 18 to be involved in any betting organisation. The issue of street bookmaking was not addressed which the press felt should have been. The restriction to 104 days was primarily brought in due to rapid growth of greyhound tracks after 1927 and the associated gambling implications that had followed. =Lotteries and Prize Competitions= All lotteries were made unlawful with the exemption of small lotteries incidental to certain entertainment and private lotteries. Restrictions were made on certain prize competitions (i.e. in newspapers) and warrant rights were given to any constable to investigate premises that are suspected of breaking the restrictions. This was primarily directed to combat the Irish Free State Hospitals' Sweepstake. The Official Act Sections =Part 1 - Betting= *1. Restriction of betting on tracks. *2.

Associated with Keien court poetry, she founded the Haginoya poetry school (萩の舎, \\"House of Bush Clover\\"), the most notable of the poetry conservatories during the Meiji period. Nakajima Utako was born in 1844 (or 1841), the second daughter of Nakajima Matazaemon (中島又左衛門). Her childhood name was Tose (とせ). As descendants of the statesman, Ōta Dōkan, the builder of Edo Castle, the Nakajimas were known for generations as village leaders. The house of Fukushima (福島), the mother's family, was also a powerful trading house and court supplier of the shōgun. The mother was active in the inner service of Kawagoe Castle and was able to establish close relations with the house of Nabeshima. When Nakajima was 10 years old, she became a maid of honor in the estate of the highest administrative officer of Matsudaira (松平) in Harima Province (in today's Hyōgo Prefecture). At the age of 18, she married a vassal of Mito-han, Hayashi Chūzaemon (林忠左衛門), and moved with him to Mito. But he was seriously injured in 1864, just before the Meiji restoration, and committed suicide. After the Meiji restoration, Nakajima returned to Edo (now Tokyo), where she received an education in waka and calligraphy under Katō Chinami (加藤千浪).

Biography =Early years and family= Blake was one of seven children of Michael and Elizabeth Blake, immigrants from County Westmeath, Ireland. He and his siblings were all born in Manhattan, in their family home at 312 East 18th Street, just off Second Avenue. James Blake went to P.S. 40 in Manhattan, worked as a stock boy and office boy in various drapers' shops, then went to evening school and became a real estate agent. His oldest brother, Michael F. Blake, a classmate of Charles F. Murphy and James A. Foley, was first a news reporter, then went to law school, joined his former classmates and Tammany Hall, and became a City Court judge for 20 years. =Career, songwriting, and lyrics to Sidewalks= Blake became a hat salesman, and songwriting was only a hobby, which he turned to when sales were slow. One day in 1894, Charles Lawlor, a friend who was also a well-known vaudevillian and singer, walked into John Golden's hat store on Third Avenue between East 13th and East 14th Streets to visit Blake, humming the melody that became The Sidewalks of New York. Blake took a liking to the 3/4 tune, and had him repeat it several times. \\"You get the music on paper,\\" he told Lawlor, \\"and I'll write the words for it.\\" Lawlor returned to the store in about twenty minutes with the musical notes on paper, and Blake was halfway through the lyrics, having been interrupted by a customer. He finished the words in another half-hour. The tune and words became extremely familiar and well-known throughout New York City. It was first made famous by Lottie Gilson, and it had staying power because the melody was catchy and easy to sing. The words were a shared vision of Lawlor and Blake, and recall their childhood neighborhoods and those who grew up with them. It was a universal longing for youth, yesteryear, and place, although it was also idealized because both Lawlor and Blake had grown up quite poor. Lawlor said that he envisioned a \\"big husky policeman leaning against a lamppost and twirling his club, an organ grinder playing nearby, and the east side kids with dirty faces, shoes unlaced, stockings down, torn clothes, dancing to the music, while from a tenement window an old Irish woman with a checkered cap and one of those old time checkered shawls around her shoulders, looking down and smiling at the children.\\" The children's names in the lyrics were those of Blake's childhood friends. The song became popular right after it was published, and decades later had a huge renaissance when Al Smith used it as his theme during his three failed presidential campaigns in 1920, 1924, and 1928. Over the years, Blake wrote the words to many songs, including some others with Lawlor, such as \\"Pretty Jenny Slattery\\", \\"Every Boy Has Quarreled with His Sweetheart\\", \\"The Best in the House is None Too Good for Reilly\\", \\"I Did My Drinking When The Drinking Was Good\\", but none came even close to matching the popularity of \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\". =Personal life and later years= The rest of Blake's life was much tougher than his big hit suggested. He married a girl from Brooklyn named Ida McBurney and they had two children, but both died in infancy and Ida died after only two years of marriage. He and Lawlor sold the rights to \\"The Sidewalks of New York\\" for $5,000 to the music publishers Howley, Haviland, and Dresser, so they did not get any residuals. Lawlor died blind and penniless in 1925. Blake worked for many years selling hats, velvets, and related items, including at Macy's and at Shendell and Co. In 1932, Blake joined his two surviving siblings, Mary and John, in an apartment on Walton Avenue in the Bronx. However, by January 1933 they had no money and were evicted from their building. They even walked the sidewalks and streets he had written about, and spent time in Pennsylvania Station just to keep warm. But he remembered being interviewed several years earlier by Ishbel Ross of the New York Herald Tribune, so he got in touch with her. When his story became known, Smith, who had by then retired from politics, arranged for the Emergency Unemployment Relief Committee to provide an apartment for the three Blakes at 407 West 22nd Street, and Max Mayer, who then owned the rights to Sidewalks, arranged for the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers to provide a $25 weekly pension even though Blake had never even been a member of the organization. When Blake became ill, Smith arranged for him to be hospitalized at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City, where he died of stomach cancer several weeks later. He was buried in a family plot in Calvary Cemetery in Queens. References 1862 births 1935 deaths People from Manhattan American lyricists ","title":"James W.

The land preserve, which is operated by the Macon County Conservation District, centers on hiking and picknicking for users in the farming area southwest of Decatur. It is based on a land parcel donated to the county in 1973 by local benefactor and landowner Harry E. Griswold, and the conservation area is named in his honor. The nearest major highway is Illinois Route 48, at Blue Mound. Description =The kame= The adjacent village, Blue Mound, is named for the Griswold Conservation Area's significant glacial kame. This is a surface mound left behind by glaciers during the Illinois glacial period. Ice masses, which melted circa 130,000 years B.P., left random heaps of gravel and loose rock behind. After the kame was quarried for aggregate stone during an extended period of time, with removal activity climaxing in the 1930s, the remains of the mound were set aside for public preservation and use. The remaining kame reaches 706 feet above sea level, up to 80 feet above the flat farmland around the land preserve. A trail serves a public overlook. =Wildlife= The conservation area features predatory birds such as hawks and owls, which use the raised ground as an observation point just as humans do.

One route of begins at Highway 7 in Sparkman and runs east to Highway 9 at Holly Springs. A second route of begins at Highway 51 at Joan and runs east to Highway 7/Highway 8 at Gravel Junction. A third route begins at Highway 7 near DeGray Lake Resort State Park and runs east and north to US Highway 270 Business (US 270B) in Hot Springs. A fourth route begins at Highway 5 in Fountain Lake and runs east to US 70\\\\. All routes are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ArDOT). Route description All four routes are low-traffic, two-lane, undivided roads winding through the Piney Woods of Southwest Arkansas. No segment of Highway 157 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. The ArDOT maintains Highway 128 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. =Sparkman to Holly Springs= Highway 128 begins at Sparkman, a small town in rural Dallas County. It runs due east as Main Street, passing Sparkman Elementary School and Sparkman High School before entering downtown. Continuing east, Highway 128 exits the town and enters a rural, forested area. It passes through the unincorporated community of New Hope, and intersects Highway 207 at Pine Grove. Near Pine Grove, Highway 128 passes the historic Sardis Methodist Church, listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Continuing southeasterly, Highway 128 passes near the Brazeale Homestead, also listed on the NRHP, before crossing Tulip Creek and White Oak Creek. Southeast of these creek crossings, a proposed intersection with Highway 273 is marked on the county map produced by ArDOT (as of January 2018). The Highway 273 extension was approved in 1973, but remains unbuilt.. Highway 128 continues southeast to Holly Springs, passing the NRHP-listed Capt. Goodgame House. In Holly Springs, Highway 128 terminates at an intersection with Highway 9. AADT for the highway was highest at the western terminus, 1,600 vehicles per day. Outside the city limits of Sparkman, the traffic counts dropped below 1,000 with a low of 740 between Pine Grove and Holly Springs. =Joan to Gravel Ridge= The highway begins at Highway 51 east of Arkadelphia. It runs south through a sparsely populated rural area with swamps, sloughs, and pine trees, crossing L'eau Frais Creek and becoming a section line road southbound. The highway passes a small, discontinuous segment of the Big Timber Wildlife Management Area (WMA) south of the creek crossing. Highway 128 turns west at Mill Creek, terminating at an intersection with Highway 7/Highway 8 at Gravel Junction. Other than the termini, Highway 128 does not intersect any other state highways. AADT for the highway was estimated to be 270 VPD at a point north of the route's midpoint in 2016. =De Gray Lake Resort State Park to Hot Springs= First reassurance marker eastbound in Hot Spring County Highway 128 begins north of DeGray Lake Resort State Park in the Ouachita Mountains. It runs east across Caney Creek to Caney, where it serves as the northern terminus of Highway 283\\\\. Highway 128 turns north at the junction, weaving through a sparsely populated pine forest. The route briefly overlaps Highway 84 at De Roche. North of the overlap, Highway 128 becomes the eastern edge of the Jack Mountain WMA, which offers deer, turkey, and bear hunting (among others) to permitted hunters through the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission (AGFC). Upon entering Garland County, Highway 128 begins an overlap with Highway 290 around the southeastern edge of Lake Hamilton, with the concurrency ending just north of Red Oak. The highway bridges the Ouachita River between Lake Hamilton and Lake Catherine just east of Carpenter Dam before entering Hot Springs, the county seat of Garland County, where it becomes Carpenter Dam Road. Highway 128 winds north through an undeveloped section of the city before crossing US Highway 70 (US 70) and US 270, known as the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Expressway in Hot Springs, at exit 7. North of this interchange, the highway passes an industrial facility and the Arkansas State Police Troop K Headquarters before terminating at a junction with US 270B (Malvern Avenue). =Fountain Lake to US 70= In northeast Garland County, Highway 128 begins at Highway 5 (Park Avenue) in Fountain Lake. The entire length of the highway is known as Lonsdale Cutoff Road. The highway runs east across the South Fork Ouachita River, with a historic 1928 bridge paralleling the highway's modern span. East of the town, Highway 128 passes through rural forested area, nearing the Saline County line before turning southward. Highway 128 briefly enters Saline County before returning to Garland County, intersecting US 70, where the route terminates. The roadway continues south to Lonsdale as a county road. AADT for the highway was estimated to be 1,700 VPD near the eastern terminus in 2016. History The original Highway 128 was created in 1928, from Highway 27 southwest of Murfreesboro southwest to Highway 24 (now US 371). In 1937, Highway 128 became part of Highway 26, and State Road 7A between Holly Springs and Pine Grove was renumbered as Highway 128. Highway 128 was extended later.

It is attributed to the queen Khentkaus II, who may have ruled Egypt as a reigning queen after the death of her husband Neferirkare Kakai. The pyramid is now a heavily damaged ruin, which only stands 4 metres high.  Discovery pyramid complex of Neferirkare The area of the pyramid of Khentkaus II, directly south of the pyramid complex of Neferirkare was first explored at the beginning of the 20th century by Ludwig Borchardt, who also found remains of the complex, which he incorrectly identified as a double mastaba after carrying out some soundings.Miroslav Verner: Die Pyramiden. 1999, pp. 332ff.: Die Pyramide der Chentkaus II. Excited by the discovery of a papyrus fragment from the 5th dynasty, the Czech archaeologist Miroslav Verner investigated the previously unexplored area during the excavations which he undertook in Abousir with his team from 1975 to 1980. In the process he discovered that it was not a mastaba at all, but a small pyramid complex. Through his excavations, Verner was able to clearly assign the structure to a queen named Khentkaus. It was not initially clear whether this was the same individual as Khentkaus I of the Fourth dynasty whose is at Giza. Both Khentkaus I and Khentkaus II had an unusual title which indicated that they had ruled Egypt personally. From the archaeological context, however, it was possible to date the pyramid at Abousir to the 5th dynasty and to identify the owner of the pyramid with the wife of Neferirkare: Khentkaus II.  Construction  Construction of the pyramid of Khentkaus II began in the reign of her husband Neferirkare and appears to have been originally planned as a simple queen's pyramid within the pyramid complex of Neferirkare. Inscriptions from this phase of the construction give the name of Khentkaus with the title \\"Royal Wife.\\" Between the tenth and eleventh regnal year of the king there was a change in the building work, which had reached the height of the grave chamber roof by this point. The reason for the change was probably the death of the king. Although the continuation of construction during the subsequent short reign of Neferefre cannot be ruled out, there is very little evidence for it.Miroslav Verner: Further Thoughts on the Khentkaus Problem. 1997, S. 109ff. Only under Nyuserre Ini does work seem to have resumed on the complex. On inscriptions from this time, Khentkaus' title is \\"Queen mother.\\" In this period, the pyramid was completed, a temple was erected in two phases and the rest of the complex was built. There is also an inscription from this time, which gives her title as Mw.t-nsw-bj.tj-nsw-bj.tj, which might be read as \\"Mother of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt and King of Upper and Lower Egypt\\" or as \\"Mother of two kings of Upper and Lower Egypt.\\" The first interpretation would indicate that Khentkaus II had reigned as monarch in her own right for at least a short time - a possibility which is also supported by the depiction of her with the symbols of the king.  Pyramid  Reconstruction of the Pyramid The pyramid had a base which measured 25 metres by 25 metres and, if its slope was the 52° angle which was usual for pyramids in the 5th dynasty, then it would have been about 17 metres tall. The core of the pyramid was formed by three stages of small limestone blocks, which were held together by clay morter. This material was the left over remains of the material used to build Neferirkare's pyramid. The core seems to have been covered with a fine Tura limestone cladding. The top of the pyramid was formed by a grey-black granite pyramidion, fragments of which were found in the ruins. In the first phase of construction, under Neferirkare, the core structure of the pyramid was built, but the cladding and the mortuary temple were not added. The archaeological evidence suggests that the cladding was first added at the same time as the limestone mortuary temple was built, under Niuserre. The pyramid structure has been heavily damaged by spoliation, such that the ruins are now only 4 metres high. The shoddy masonry work and poor quality material facilitated both destruction by quarrying and erosion. = Substructure= The substructure of the pyramid is a flat, open tomb which is very clearly preserved. From the north, a corridor descends for about half its length, then continues on the horizontal and turns slightly to the east. Shortly before the burial chamber there is a granite fall-trap. The grave chamber itself was oriented in an east-west direction. The building material for the passageway and the chamber was small blocks of fine limestone. The ceiling of the grave chamber was flat and formed from massive limestone blocks. The chamber itself is heavily damaged, but fragments of a pink granite sarcophagus have been found. Some of the bindings from the mummy and fragments of alabaster grave goods were also found. These remains indicate that the pyramid was indeed used as the queen's final resting place.Rainer Stadelmann: Die ägyptischen Pyramiden. Vom Ziegelbau zum Weltwunder (= Kulturgeschichte der Antiken Welt. Bd. 30). 3. Ausgabe, von Zabern, Mainz 1997, , S. 174.  Pyramid complex  Plan of the pyramid and the temple Light grey: first building phase Dark grey: second building phase The pyramid of Khenkaus II had its own independent pyramid complex and was not part of the pyramid complex of Khentkaus' husband Neferirkare. The complex contains all important elements necessary for the maintenance of a ruler cult. Thus far, a causeway and a valley temple have not been identified. = North chapel = At the centre of the north side of the pyramid, there is a small offering chapel, which probably contained an altar. This small structure is located slightly east of the entrance to the pyramid's substructure. There are only the smallest traces of the north chapel now remaining. = Cult pyramid = In the southeast corner, there was a small , which measured 5.2 x 5.2 metres at the base and had a height of about 4.5 metres - significantly steeper than the main pyramid, with an incline of around 60°. The cult pyramid was made from the same material as the outer wall of the complex and was built as part of a late expansion of the complex, along with the second phase of the construction of the mortuary temple. The cult pyramid has been almost entirely destroyed; only slight traces remain. No substructure has been detected so far. = Mortuary temple = Remains of the inner mortuary temple of the pyramid of Khentkaus II. In the background are the ruins of the Lepsius XXIV pyramid and the Double Pyramid. The mortuary temple is on the east side of the pyramid and was constructed as part of the final phase of the complex's construction under Niuserre. The construction of the temple took place in two phases: first, a small temple was built of limestone, which was later enlarged with mud brick. The original limestone temple was entered from the east through a columned portico. Inside, there was an open-roofed pillared court with eight columns, a statue hall which contained sixteen cult statues of the queen according to a papyrus fragment found in the temple archive, an offering hall with a pink granite false door, an altar and storage chambers. A stairway led to a roof terrace. The offering hall was decorated with images carved in relief and inscriptions. Other rooms may have been as well. The pillars in the courtyard had similar decoration. One of them had a depiction of the queen with the uraeus on her forehead - a royal symbol which has been interpreted as meaning that Khentkaus II had been a reigning queen. Other images show offering scenes, a meal for the dead, landscapes, processions, and family scenes. In the expansion of the temple in the second phase, a new entrance way was added on the east side, as well as five more storage chambers, and a dwelling for priests. Mud brick was used for these new additions, rather than limestone masonry. In the course of the expansion, a mudbrick wall was built around the complex, separating it from the pyramid complex of Neferirkare. The mortuary cult of Khentkaus II is still attested over three hundred years later at the end of the 6th dynasty.Mark Lehner: Geheimnis der Pyramiden. Genehmigte Sonderausgabe. Bassermann, München 2004, , pp. 145f.: Die Pyramide der Königinmutter. = Compound wall= The complex was surrounded by a massive mud brick wall, which is clearly distinct from the compound wall of the neighbouring pyramid complex of Neferirkare. Some remains of an earlier limestone wall from the first construction phase indicate that the complex was originally intended to be connected to her husband's pyramid complex. The complex was turned into an independent area during the expansion of the mortuary temple.  Spoliation and destruction  The pyramid was first robbed in the First Intermediate Period. In the Middle Kingdom, the pyramid was reopened and the sarcophagus was reused for the burial of a child. The pyramid complex suffered major damage at the end of the New Kingdom as a result of spoliation. The material taken from the complex was reused in new building work.Miroslav Verner: The Pyramid Complex of Khentkaus. Reprinted edition. 2001.

It is much larger than modern day rollers and its sister taxon Primobucco, more similar in size and proportion to kingfishers, motmots, and bee-eaters. It had a stout, slightly curved beak, and the upper ridge of the beak curves gradually towards the tip of the bill like in living roller species. This is different from Primobucco which has stronger curvature on the anterior end of the beak. It had small, egg-shaped nasal openings, much different than any of its close extinct relatives or extant rollers, which have either elongated openings, slit-like openings, or large triangular nares. The only fossil specimen of Septencoracias does not preserve the sternum and shoulder girdle, except for the left scapula, which is not bifurcated as in Late-Eocene and later rollers. Like in Primobucco, Septencoracias has a small claw on its alular digit, which is usually absent in modern birds. Septencoracias had a very wide pelvis, and had similar proportions in its hind limbs as modern rollers. Though most modern Coraciiformes show syndactyly, with three forward- pointing toes and toes three and four fused at the base, Septencoracias is not entirely certain to have this condition. The third and fourth digit do lie on top of each other in the fossil, with the second digit separated; however in the left foot the fourth digit is slightly separated from the third, and thus it cannot be said for certain if this condition is present in Septencoracias. The fossil remains show soft tissue preservation, mostly in the thoracic and abdominal cavities, though portions were also seen in the skull. Apart from remains of potential food material, these remains have not been thoroughly examined. Discovery and naming Map showing where the holotype was found Block containing the holotype Septencoracias is based on a single specimen, MGUH.VP 9509, consisting of most of the skeleton but lacking the sternum and portions of the shoulder girdle. The specimen was preserved in three dimensions, with the skull partly eroded due to it being exposed at the time of discovery. It was discovered in the Moclay Pit on the Island of Mors, in Jutland, Denmark, in the Fur Formation. This location dates to the Ypresian age of the Early Eocene, around 54 million years ago. It was found during a geology field course in an abandoned diatomite quarry. The genus name stems from 'septentrio', meaning north, and the genus name of many modern rollers, Coracias. The specific name stems from the Island of Mors. An additional specimen from the Tielt Formation in Egem, Belgium was referred to cf. Septencoracias sp. in 2019. The specimen only consists of an isolated tarsometatarsus, however it resembles that of Septencoracias in both size and shape more than any other fossil Coraciiformes, although it is slightly larger. Classification A phylogenetic analysis in 2016 recovered Septencoracias as the sister taxon of Primobucco. The most parsimonious tree, based on 21 taxa, is shown below. Paleobiology Elements of the holotype Septencoracias is the oldest known member of the Coraciiformes, so it shows that this group was already fairly diversified by the Early Eocene, following the end-Cretaceous extinction. It already shows many of the derived characteristics of this group, as well as characteristics shared by its sister taxon, Primobucco. It was found with fish remains in its gut, of a very common taxon from the Fur Formation, argentinoids of about 10 cm in length. These may be the contents of the stomach, indicating that Septencoracias fed upon these fish prior to its death, and they were dissociated due to digestion and may have spread outside of the abdomen due to decay and breakage. This contributes to the idea that early roller and roller relatives had a much more varied diet than modern members of the group, which almost exclusively feed upon insects and small land vertebrates. However, Septencoracias probably mostly fed on insects and small land vertebrates, similar to its modern relatives, given that it was a terrestrial bird. Septencoracias was found in the Eastern Hemisphere, which is where all modern rollers are found, though they all occur in modern tropical and subtropical regions. Given the warmer climate of the Eocene, the finding of Septencoracias in Denmark indicates that the range of early Coraciiformes was much wider within the Northern Hemisphere during this time, due to the increased number of suitable habitats. As the globe cooled, the range of rollers was thus reduced to their present ranges. This was part of a much broader trend in which many modern bird clades that were formerly found in higher latitudes during the Eocene are now restricted to the tropics and subtropics from cooling climates.

The by-election was called after the death of the incumbent parliamentarian from Calcutta South East, Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee. The election saw the internationally renowned barrister Radhabinod Pal defeated by a young communist barrister Sadhan Gupta. Background In the 1951–1952 Indian parliamentary election the Calcutta South East seat had been won by the Bharatiya Jan Sangh leader Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee. But a by-election was called in 1953 to fill the vacancy after Mukherjee died.The Hindu. Veteran Leftist Sadhan Gupta passes away Mukherjee, a right-wing nationalist hardliner on the Kashmir conflict, had been detained in June 1953 whilst trying to enter Kashmir. Whilst detained he suffered a heart attack and died. Due to the dramatic circumstances of Mukherjee's death and the complexity of the Calcutta politics (whilst the constituency was seen as a Congress stronghold it had also elected a Bharatiya Jan Sabha MP as well as communist members of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly) the by-poll caught attention in national politics. Candidates Four candidates contested the by-poll, all fielded by national political parties.Election Commission of India. STATISTICAL REPORT ON GENERAL ELECTIONS, 1951 TO THE FIRST LOK SABHA =Indian National Congress= Ahead of the by- poll, the Indian National Congress contacted Radhabinod Pal to convince him to stand as their candidate. Notably Pal had been a long-time associate of Mukherjee and sharp critic of the Congress Party. Reportedly, Pal initially rejected the offer but was later convinced. Pal's conditions for accepting the candidacy included a promise that Pal neither would have to campaign for himself in any major extent nor spend any money of his own on the campaign. Pal, who was a prominent jurist, served in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and was in Japan between 26 September and 7 November 1953. Considering Pal's recognition as a jurist, the newspaper Ananda Bazaar Patrika expected that Pal would emerge victorious in the by-poll. =Communist Party of India= Pal's main challenger was another barrister. Whilst Pal was a senior jurist with international recognition, his opponent was a young lawyer linked to the labour movement. Sadhan Gupta had positioned himself in the legal community through the 1945 case \\"Emperor vs Shibnath Banerjee\\" and represented many persons affected by preventive detentions.Frontline. A stalwart passes away Gupta, who was blind, stood on a Communist Party of India ticket. His father was a member of the West Bengal Legislative Assembly at the time, representing the Indian National Congress. The CPI election campaign highlighted Pal's sudden shift in political affiliation, reminding voters that Pal used to be an opponent of the Congress government. =Bharatiya Jan Sangh= Dr. Mukherjee's party fielded Jasho Prakash Mitter as its candidate. A Bengali Hindu refugee from the Partition of India, Mitter was a prominent barrister in Calcutta. He had represented the British Crown in the 1930s Meerut Conspiracy Case. He had also defended accused at the Red Fort trial. At the time of the by-poll Mitter was the president of the Council for the Protection of the Rights of Minorities, a body with links to the Hindu Mahasabha. The organisation called for carving out a separate territory for Hindus in East Pakistan and was organising a paramilitary body amongst Hindu refugees. =Forward Bloc (Marxist Group)= Another party in the fray was the Forward Bloc (Marxist Group). The FB(MG) candidate Dr. Bhupal Bose was supported by sectors of the non-communist left. Bose was a veteran revolutionary leader and former prisoner at the Andaman jail. However, within the FB(MG) there was a sector (including leaders such as Satyapriya Banerjee, Amar Bose, Suhrid Mallick Chowdhury and Ram Chatterjee) that argued in favour of support to the CPI candidate. During the election campaign they worked for the CPI candidate rather than the one nominated by the FB(MG). The by-poll provoked a split in the party as the Working Committee of the party expelled the pro-communist group. The expelled group later formed the Marxist Forward Bloc in April the following year. Results The vote was held on 22 November 1953. A by-election was held on the same day in another West Bengal Lok Sabha seat, Nabadwip.The Economic Weekly.

Service An artist's impression of Forfait sinking in the Tyrrhenian Sea on 21 July 1875, drawn around the time of the sinking.Early in her career, Forfait actively supported the French intervention in Mexico by transporting troops and equipment to Veracruz, Mexico, and landing a shore party to assist in the capture of Tuxpan, Mexico, in 1864. Later in the 1860s she operated in Southeast Asia and the Pacific Ocean and conducted hydrographic surveys off the northwest coast of Borneo.

The ironclads were steaming in beautiful weather at 8 knots in two parallel columns, with Magenta leading one column, followed by Jeanne d′Arc and Reine Blanche, and Armide leading the other, followed by Thétis and Alma. Operating as a dispatch vessel, Forfait was steaming outside of the columns. At 12:00 noon the admiral commanding the squadron ordered Forfait to pass astern of Magenta to receive orders. Attempting to place his ship in the column between Magenta and Jeanne d′Arc, the commanding officer of Forfait misjudged his turn, and Jeanne d′Arc collided with Forfait, her ram bow tearing into Forfait′s side. Forfait sank 14 minutes later, her crew of 160 taking safely to her boats. Her commanding officer remained on the bridge until Forfait sank beneath him, but floated free, clung to floating wreckage, and was rescued.

The organisation provides facilitation/mentoring, studio and exhibition spaces for artists with intellectual disabilities, and as such has been identified as a major centre for the promotion and exhibition of outsider art, or art that has been produced outside of the contemporary and historical mainstream. In 2016 there were approximately 130 artists attending the studio, with the work of exhibiting artists featuring alongside works from the broader contemporary art community in the annual rotating exhibition program.  History  Arts Project was founded in 1974 by Myra Hilgendorf OAM and was the first full-time not-for-profit art studio in Australia for artists with intellectual disabilities. Hilgendorf sought to provide the opportunity for artists with intellectual disabilities to access the same resources, materials and opportunities to exhibit, as non-disabled artists. The seminal exhibition Minus/Plus was launched in 1975, the title working as a counter response to the negative implications of a series of articles printed in The Age newspaper, entitled ‘The Minus Children.’ This was followed in 1980 by the exhibition Tommy’s World, which opened at the Australian National Gallery in Canberra. In 2004, APA moved to its current premises where it is governed by a volunteer board and operates via funding attained from government grants, the sale of artwork, donations and bequests from private groups and individuals, as well as grants from philanthropic trusts and foundations. In recent years, a greater interest in contemporary Outsider art, as evidenced by Massimiliano Gioni’s 2013 Venice Biennale which included several exhibits dedicated to self-taught or Outsider artists, has led to an increase in the media exposure and significance attributed to organisations such as Arts Project Australia. In 2013 three artists represented by APA, Boris Cipusev, Alan Constable and Patrick Francis, were featured in the Melbourne Now exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria, which also acquired a collection of work by Cipusev and Constable for its permanent collection. In 2014, APA partnered with Melbourne University to host the international conference Contemporary Outsider Art: The Global Context. The conference coincided with several outsider art exhibitions at major institutions in Australia, including Albert Tucker and the Mystery of HD at Heide Museum of Modern Art and exhibitions at the Dax Centre and the Social Studio. In 2016 APA received the Award for Outstanding Organisation, in the HESTA Community Sector Awards. Notable curators and artists who have produced exhibitions at APA include Philadelphia-based curator Alex Baker (former Curator for International Art at the National Gallery of Victoria), Ricky Swallow, Karra Rees (Centre for Contemporary Photography), Vincent Alessi (Ian Potter Museum of Art), Emma Busowsky Cox (Castlemaine Art Gallery), Richard Lewer, Linda Judge, Jim Pavlidis, Angela Cavalieri, Paul Hodges, Katherine Hattam and Judy Holding. Additional significant figures from Australian public life who have collaborated in APA artistic projects include Michael Caton, John Clarke, Fiona Corke, Abi Crompton, Brian Dawe, Mick Harvey, John-Michael Howson OAM, Lukas Markovic and Thérèse Rein. APA has collaborated to produce exhibitions at a number of major Australian institutions, most recently for the Centre for Contemporary Photography (Clay Cameras, 2009), Australian Centre for the Moving Image (Outsider Art Shorts, 2014), Ian Potter Museum of Art (Everyday Imaginings: new perspectives on Outsider Art, 2014), Melbourne Theatre Company (The Sublime 2014, Endgame 2015), Art + Climate = Change (Altered Vistas, 2015), Art Centre Melbourne (Home, 2015), Linden New Art (Wild Lands, 2016), Next Wave Festival (Telltale, 2016), Gertrude Contemporary (In Concert, 2016). Artists who work in the studios at APA are represented in major Australian art institutions. Some notable examples are the National Gallery of Australia (Lisa Reid, Dorothy Berry, Valerio Ciccone, Brigid Hanrahan, Chris Mason, Steven Perrette), National Gallery of Victoria (Boris Cipusev, Alan Constable, Bobby Kyriakopoulos ), Shepparton Art Museum (Michael Camakaris), State Library of Victoria (Chris Mason), Monash University Museum of Art (Julian Martin), National Sports Museum (Valerio Ciccone) Gold Coast City Gallery (Kaye McDonald), La Trobe University Museum of Art (George Aristovoulou), Deakin University Art Collection (Julian Martin), City of Melbourne Art and Heritage Collection (Julian Martin).

AT&T; TV, launched nationally in March 2020, is the company's main national pay television service, positioned to succeed U-verse TV. It is sold on-contract and optionally bundled in the same manner as traditional television providers, but utilizes Android TV-based set-top boxes rented to subscribers. AT&T; TV Now (formerly DirecTV Now) is a direct-to-consumer service launched on November 30, 2016, designed to compete with other over-the-top television services, and sold without a contract. AT&T; WatchTV, first offered in June 2018, is a skinny bundle service aimed at cord cutters, featuring no local or sports channels.AT&T;’s low-cost TV streaming service WatchTV goes live - TechCrunch, 29 June 2018  History  On July 13, 2017, it was reported that AT&T; was preparing to introduce a cloud-based DVR streaming service as part of its effort to create a unified platform across the DirecTV satellite television service and DirecTV Now services, with U-verse to be added soon. In March 2019, DirecTV Now instituted a new package structure for new subscribers with fewer channels included (although with HBO now included in the base package), and increased pricing for all subscribers. By the second quarter of 2019, DirecTV Now lost 168,000 subscribers (decreasing to 1.3 million), with AT&T; citing \\"higher prices and less promotional activity\\" as reasoning. On July 30, 2019, AT&T; announced an upcoming streaming television service known as AT&T; TV, which would feature an Android TV-based set-top box with a Google Assistant-based voice remote, use the same apps used by DirecTV Now, and offer cloud DVR with 500 hours of storage. Unlike DirecTV Now, this service is sold on a contract basis (and in bundles with AT&T; Internet), and requires the rental or purchase of proprietary set-top boxes. The service allows user self-installation, but activation fees are still charged. AT&T; CEO Randall Stephenson referred to AT&T; TV as a \\"workhorse\\" service succeeding DirecTV and AT&T; U-verse in its pay television business. The service was initially launched in selected markets in California, Florida, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas, with additional markets to follow. Concurrently it was announced that DirecTV Now would re- brand as \\"AT&T; TV Now\\". The similar names between the different services have been noted as possibly causing confusion, with media outlets even citing examples occurring within the company itself. In September 2019, a class action lawsuit was filed against AT&T;, alleging that it had falsely inflated its reported number of AT&T; TV Now subscribers by engaging in \\"unrelenting pressure and strong-arm tactics\\" and giving unwanted subscriptions to the service to customers without their consent, as well as making false claims surrounding risks related to the service in its SEC filings related to the purchase of Time Warner. On March 2, 2020, AT&T; TV launched nationally. AT&T; president John Stankey stated that AT&T; TV would be promoted as the company's main pay television service, with DirecTV being downplayed outside of markets with insufficient broadband quality to use AT&T; TV. AT&T; TV Now would struggle through 2019, with a loss of 138,000 subscribers in 2020 Q1 according to its quarterly earnings report. The service as a whole was down to 788,000 subscribers, compared to its peak of 1.86 million subscribers, before the large discounts to attract initial subscriber interest were scaled back.AT&T;'s massive TV losses continue as another 900,000 customers flee Programming The service consists of four main bundles, including the base \\"Entertainment\\" service, \\"Choice\\" (which adds regional sports networks), \\"Xtra\\", and \\"Ultimate\\". =Now version = AT&T; TV Now logo The service's current base package \\"Plus\\" includes channels from co-owned division WarnerMedia as well as the four other major television conglomerates: The Walt Disney Company, Fox Corporation, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS.

While working primarily as a painter, Howard-Wilks is also a ceramicist and animator and has worked in the Arts Project Australia studio since 2000. His diverse subject matter explores themes such as the Australian landscape, seascapes, and Australian Rules Football. With a fine attention to detail and a special interest in oceanic and environmental imagery, Howard-Wilks' works have been widely exhibited both Australia-wide and internationally. His works are held within many collections, most notably at the National Gallery of Australia and the Museum of Contemporary Art. He is viewed as an important figure in outsider art in Australia.  Early life and education  Howard-Wilks was encouraged in artistic pursuits by his mother, also an artist, from a young age. However, it wasn’t until he attended Churinga at the age of 20 where he began working with the artist-in-residence there that he started to make art seriously. Following this time Howard-Wilks studied art at TAFE and, at the age of 22, began attending Arts Project Australia. While Howard-Wilks has received no formal fine art training, the artist's participation at Arts Project Australia's studio program has seen Howard-Wilks develop his very singular style.  Career, themes and style  Howard-Wilks works independently, often painting from memory. His subject matter reflects his personal interests and often depicts the Australian landscape, Australian Rules Football, marine life and trains. Howard-Wilks’ paintings are often characterised by the construction of unique perspectives and compositions, which emphasizes the spatial vastness of the sky and clouds. Rather than producing realist depictions, Howard-Wilks’ imagery combines his acute observations with his use of reference material. As the environmental arts organisation CLIMARTE has noted, Howard-Wilks \\"is dedicated to exploring themes such as Australian landscapes, seascapes, the environment, football and more specifically, sharks, magpies and trains.\\" This echoes the sentiments of journalist Julia Irwin, who states that \\"The inspiration for his [Howard- Wilks'] detailed gouache painting stems from his diverse interests including Australian animals and plants, trains and his favourite football team — Collingwood.\\" Howard-Wilks' practice is also meticulously detailed in its unity of seemingly disparate references. This ability, as art critic Dan Rule writes, \\"creates wild hyper-natural scenes awash with giant crocodiles, sharks and an ever-present magpie, each of which shift in scale, prominence and perspective.\\" Continuing Howard-Wilks ongoing interest in environmental issues and climate change, in 2016 the painter collaborated with esteemed artist Jon Campbell for the CLIMARTE 2016 Poster Project. The pair produced a work based upon the environmental degradation of the Great Barrier Reef which was praised for its ability to \\"encourage people to think about the damage we are doing to the reef’s fragile ecosystems.\\" Environmental and oceanic themes pervade Howard-Wilks' work, \\"illustrating his concerns for marine environments.\\" As Howard-Wilks' career has developed, so has the commitment Howard-Wilks shows to his work, which is evident in the development of his animated films produced since 2004. Howard-Wilks' video works have been screened at events such as the 2004 Disability FIlm Festival (as part of the British Film Institute) and the Annual Westgarth Film Festival in Melbourne. With inclusion in numerous group exhibitions, Howard-Wilks has held two solo exhibitions at Arts Project Australia and Melbourne's West Space. In a testament to Howard- Wilks' ever-expanding career and practice, the artist's work is now held in several collections with two works notably within the collection of the National Gallery of Australia  Solo exhibitions  2015 My solo with a magpie in it, West Space, Melbourne 2004 Sharks and Everything, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne  Group exhibitions  2016 Clay: it’s a matter of substance, Arts Project Australia, Melbourne A History of the Future; Imagining Melbourne, City Gallery, Melbourne Town Hall, Melbourne Climarte Poster Project, LAB-14 Gallery, Carlton Connect Initiative, University of Melbourne 2015 Somewhere in the city, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne Altered Vistas, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne 2014 CCP Salon, Centre for Contemporary Photography, Fitzroy Sit Down, Shut Up and Watch, Film & New Media Festival, South Australia Connected, Yarra Gallery, Federation Square, Melbourne Small Universe, No Vacancy, QV Melbourne 2012 Walsh Bay Arts Table, The Wharf – Pier 2, Sydney NSW Melbourne Art Fair, Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne 2011 Exhibition #4, Museum of Everything, London 2010 Pacifica, Gallery Impaire, Paris, France We Call Them Pirates Out Here: MCA Collection, Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney Myscape, Trongate & Collins Gallery, Strathclyde University, Glasgow, Scotland 2009 Pearls of Arts Project Australia: The Stuart Purves Collection, Orange Regional Gallery, NSW 2008 Without Borders: Outsider Art in an Antipodean Context, Monash University Museum of Art, Melbourne 2007 Otherworlds, King Street Gallery on Burton, Sydney 2005 Leo Cussen with Selected Artists, Australian Galleries, Collingwood 2003 Home Sweet Home: works from the Peter Fay collection, National Gallery of Australia, Canberra (travelling exhibition)  Publications  Anne Stonehouse and James McDonald, Paul Hodges in So Far… Eight Artists/Eight Stories, Arts Project Australia Inc., 2014, pp. 24–39.

In aviation, a ski-jump is an upward-curved ramp that allows aircraft to take off from a runway that is shorter than the aircraft's required takeoff roll. By forcing the aircraft upwards, lift-off can be achieved at a lower airspeed than that required for sustained flight, while allowing the aircraft to accelerate to such speed in the air rather than on the runway. Ski-jumps are commonly used to launch airplanes from aircraft carriers that lack catapults.  Principle  HTMS Chakri Naruebet with ski-jump deck in the South China Sea in April 2001. A fixed-wing aircraft must build up forward speed during a lengthy takeoff roll. As the forward velocity increases, the wings produce greater amounts of lift. At a high enough speed, the lift force will exceed the weight of the aircraft, and the aircraft will become capable of sustained flight. Since the aircraft must reach flight speed using only its own engines for power, a long runway is required so that the aircraft can build up speed. On an aircraft carrier, the flight deck is so short that most aircraft cannot reach flight speed before reaching the end of the deck. Since lift is less than gravity, the aircraft will lose altitude after the wheels leave the flight deck and possibly fall into the sea. A ski-jump ramp at the end of the flight deck redirects the aircraft to a slight upward angle, converting part of the aircraft's forward motion into a positive rate of climb. Since the aircraft is still traveling at an inadequate speed to generate enough lift, its climb rate will start to drop as soon as it leaves the flight deck. However, the ski-jump launch has given the aircraft additional time to continue accelerating. By the time its upward velocity has decayed to zero, the aircraft will be going fast enough for its wings to produce enough lift. At this point, the aircraft will be in stable flight, having launched from the carrier without ever dipping below the height of the flight deck. Many modern aircraft carriers lack catapults, so heavy aircraft must take off using their own engines. Ski-jumps make it possible for heavier aircraft to take off than a horizontal deck allows. However, ski-jump launches cannot match the payloads made possible by high-speed catapult launches.  History  A Fairey Barracuda takes off from the temporary ski-jump on HMS Furious in 1944. The wooden support structure of the ski jump is clearly visible. Early aircraft carriers could launch aircraft simply by turning into the wind and adding the ship's own speed to the airspeed experienced by the aircraft. During World War II, carrier aircraft became so heavy that assisted take-off became desirable. Deck catapults were used to accelerate aircraft to takeoff speed, especially when launching heavy aircraft or when it was inconvenient to change course. An early use of the ski-jump occurred in 1944, when the British aircraft carrier HMS Furious launched a strike against the German battleship Tirpitz. A ski-jump ramp was temporarily installed on the end of the flight deck to help the bomb-laden Fairey Barracudas take off. As carrier aircraft kept getting heavier after World War II, it was feared that even a catapult would one day not be enough. An NACA study from 1952 proposed the use of a ski-jump after the aircraft catapult to assist aircraft in taking off. In his 1973 M.Phil. thesis, Lt. Cdr. D.R. Taylor of Britain's Royal Navy proposed using a ski-jump to help the Harrier Jump Jet take off. Initial testing with various ramp angles was carried out at RAE Bedford, using the two-seat Harrier demonstrator G-VTOL. Tests showed that performance increased with ski-jump angle, but the minimum angle was selected to avoid putting excessive stress on the aircraft's undercarriage. The Royal Navy subsequently built its Invincible-class aircraft carriers with ski-jumps to support Harrier operations. After the success of the Harrier, the ski-jump became a proven method for launching aircraft from ships without the complexity and expense of a catapult. Ski-jumps were added not only to aircraft carriers, but also to amphibious assault ships and landing helicopter docks. After Brazil retired the aircraft carrier São Paulo in 2017, only the United States and France still operated aircraft carriers with catapults.  Aircraft carrier operations  = STOBAR = On Short Take-Off But Arrested Recovery aircraft carriers (STOBAR), conventional aircraft are launched using a ski-jump. The pilot increases the aircraft's thrust by switching on the afterburners, while holding the plane by braking. Two panels are raised from the deck of the aircraft carrier in front of the aircraft's main landing gear, ensuring the plane remains motionless. Upon command, the pilot releases the brake; the panels from the deck drop back into their slots; and the aircraft rapidly taxis forward under maximum thrust. Rolling over the ski ramp launches the plane both upward and forward. A MiG-29 launching over the ski-jump ramp on a can take off at a speed of about instead of the usual (depending on many factors such as gross weight). With the exception of the United States and France, every navy in the world that currently operates naval fixed-wing aircraft from carriers uses ski-jump ramps. = STOVL = Sea Harrier launches from the Indian Navy aircraft carrier Short Take-Off, Vertical Landing aircraft (STOVL) make a conventional rolling takeoff, with the jet exhausts set to provide maximum forward thrust. As the plane nears the ski-jump ramp, the jet exhausts are rotated to provide lift as well as forward thrust. Such takeoffs allow a larger takeoff weight than an unassisted horizontal launch, because the ski-jump ramp provides a vertical impetus when most needed, right at takeoff at the slowest takeoff speed. Ski-jump ramp takeoffs are considered safer than takeoffs over a flat-top carrier. When a Harrier launches from an American LHA, it would finish its takeoff roll and begin flight at above the water. It might not have a positive rate of climb, especially if the ship had pitched nose down during the takeoff roll. Using a ski-jump ramp, a Harrier will certainly launch with a positive rate of climb, and its momentum will carry it to above the water. In 1988 a detachment of US Marine Corps AV-8B Harrier conducted a number of flight tests on the . They found that takeoff conditions which would use all of a 's flight deck would only take with the Asturias's 12° ski-jump ramp. The dramatic improvement for a ship without catapults was described as \\"nothing short of amazing.\\"  Land operations  NAS Pax River during feasibility tests. The U.S. Air Force has examined the use of ski-jumps on land to enable short-field takeoffs. This was seen as \\"a possible solution to the runway denial problem in Europe\\" during the Cold War. When a ski-jump with a 9 degree exit angle is used, the takeoff roll of an F/A-18 Hornet can be cut in half.

Serving from 1951 to 1956, he was associated with Prime Ministers Clement Attlee, Winston Churchill, and Anthony Eden. With his colleague Jock Colville, he was one of Churchill's last two principal private secretaries at 10 Downing Street. Biography David Pitblado, born in London in August 1912, attended Strand School and then matriculated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He chose the civil service as a career, and was named assistant private secretary to the Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in 1937. He joined the War Cabinet Office in 1942, and became an undersecretary for economic planning in the Treasury in 1949. His career trajectory continued and he became the Principal Private Secretary to the Prime Minister, Clement Attlee, in 1951. His service for Attlee was brief, as the Labour prime minister did not retain his majority in the 1951 General Election. Pitblado continued his service to Attlee's replacement, Winston Churchill. During Churchill's third Government in 1951–1955, the Prime Minister enjoyed uncertain health. The office of Principal Private Secretary to 10 Downing Street was thus of greater importance than usual, and the Government made use of two principal private secretaries. Pitblado informally specialized in home and internal affairs, and his colleague Jock Colville was the centerpiece of these duties with respect to defense and external affairs. Upon Churchill's stroke in June 1953, functions at 10 Downing Street were carried on by senior staff for some weeks. Churchill biographer Martin Gilbert credits Pitblado, Colville, and Churchill's son-in-law Christopher Soames with supervising the operation of the office while the incapacitated Prime Minister fought toward partial recovery. After Churchill's retirement in 1955, Pitblado rounded out his service at No 10 with brief service to his successor, Anthony Eden (later Earl of Avon) in 1955–1956. He then returned to the ministerial civil service and served in a variety of posts. He became Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Power in 1966–1969, and Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Technology in 1969–1970. =Later life and honours= David Pitblado was listed in the 1953 Coronation Honours, receiving the rank of Commander of the Royal Victorian Order.

Biography  Barsoum is Distinguished Professor in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering at Drexel University in Philadelphia, PA. He is a member of the American Ceramics Society and the World Academy of Ceramics. Barsoum is an internationally recognized leader in the area of MAX phases, which were first fabricated and fully characterized with Dr. Tamer El Raghy at Drexel University in 1995. They synthesized two families of ternary machinable carbides and nitrides, namely Ti³SiC² and the H-phases. Barsoum and his collaborators have published over 200 papers on MAX phases. He is the author of the two entries on the MAX phases in the Encyclopedia of Materials Science and Engineering. Professor Barsoum was awarded a Humboldt Max Planck Research Award in 2000 and worked one year at the Max Planck Institute in Stuttgart, Germany. In 2008-2009, he was a prestigious Wheatley Scholar at Los Alamos National Lab in Los Alamos, New Mexico. He is a visiting professor at Linkoping University in Linkoping, Sweden. He is an inventor of 2D transitional metal carbides, carbonitrides and nitrides labeled MXenes and derived from the MAX phases. They can be used in many applications, most significantly in lithium-ion and sodium-ion energy storage systems. The polycrystalline nanolaminate structure of these compounds endowed them with a set of unique and remarkable properties that have application in electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and water purification. Most recently Barsoum discovered a new universal mechanism – ripplocation - in the deformation of layered solids. With over 450 refereed publications and a Google h index > 100, his work has been highly and widely cited--57,684 times (Google Scholar). He has been on the Web of Science’s highly cited researchers list in 2018 and 2019. Barsoum is a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Society of Engineering Sciences, fellow of the American Ceramic Soc. and the World Academy of Ceramics. He is the author of the books, MAX Phases: Properties of Machinable Carbides and Nitrides, 2013, and Fundamentals of Ceramics, 2020, a leading textbook in the field and now in second edition. Barsoum was a recipient of a Chair of Excellence from the Nanosciences Foundation in Grenoble, France in 2017. In 2020, he was awarded the International Ceramics Prize for basic science by the World Academy of Ceramics, to be presented in Montecatini Terme, Italy 2021. This prize is awarded quadrennially and is one of the highest in his field.

CONSTITUENCY DATA – SUMMARY As of 1952, the constituency had 381,486 eligible voters. Political dynamics At the time, south-east Calcutta was viewed as the political nerve-centre of Calcutta, a city known for its vivid political life. Calcutta South-East had a predominately middle class character. Whilst most of the assembly segments of Calcutta South East elected Indian National Congress legislators in the 1952 West Bengal Legislative Assembly election, the constituency was politically diverse. With a Bharatiya Jan Sangh MP, there was also a significant communist presence (at least two communist legislators elected from the area). The area of the constituency belonged to the areas that had elected Sarat Chandra Bose (Netaji Subash Chandra Bose's brother) against a Congress candidate. 1952 election In the first elections after the independence of India, four candidates were in the fray in Calcutta South East: Mriganka Mohan Sur of the Indian National Congress, Dr. Syama Prasad Mukherjee of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, Sadhan Gupta of the Communist Party of India and Satya Ranjan Bakshi of the Forward Bloc- National Synthesis.Election Commission of India.

He served as regent and de facto monarch during the interregnum period when the royal succession of Mangareva was in doubt. His name is also written as Akakio Matereikura in some French sources. Biography Akakio Tematereikura was the son of Matua, the high priest of Mangareva, and his wife Toa-Matui. He was also a cousin of King Maputeoa. He and his family were members of the royal togoʻiti class of chiefs of the island of Mangareva in the Gambier Islands. Christianity was introduced to the Gambier Islands in the 1830s by French Picpus priests, Honoré Laval and François Caret with the support of King Maputeoa and his father Matua. When King Maputeoa died on 20 June 1857. he was succeeded as King of Mangareva by his young son, Joseph Gregorio II, with his widow Queen Maria Eutokia Toaputeitou as regent. Akakio's daughter Agapa was chosen as the consort of the new king from a list of three noblewomen. However, she died young and King Joseph later died childless after an eleven-year reign. Akakio married Agnès Toamani and had three known children. His daughter Agapa married King Joseph Gregorio II. He also had two sons: the youngest unnamed son was studying to be a priest before his father's death while his eldest son Maria-Tepano Teikatoara married Agnus Tepaïru, the sister of the king and eldest surviving child of King Maputeoa. The ruins of Rouru Convent, where Queen Maria Eutokia Toaputeitou retired to in later life as a novice After the untimely death of the king without issue in 1868, the succession of the throne was thrown into doubt. Traditionally only male heirs could ascend to the throne of Mangareva, so a regency was installed pending the birth of an heir from one of the king's two surviving sisters: Agnès (his daughter-in-law) and Philomèle. A series of regents ruled in the name of these two royal sisters. Initially, the queen dowager served as regent while Akakio presided as president of the regency council. In a report dated to 4 April 1869, French Lieutenant Xavier Caillet noted that Queen Maria Eutokia Toaputeito had resigned and retired to Rouru Convent, on Mount Duff, and Akakio had been chosen as her successor to the regency. Akakio died on 24 August 1869, after receiving all the sacraments of the Catholic Church administered the French missionaries in Mangareva. The former queen regent had to come out of her religious retirement to attend to the political affair left by his death. She considered choosing Father Laval, the head of the Catholic mission, as the new regent and turu (guardian) of her two daughters but the French priest refused the offer. Instead, she selected Arone Teikatoara (the paternal uncles of her daughters) as Akakio's successor with the chiefs Bernardo Teoaiti, Agapito and Bernardo Putairi serving as his assistants. After the appointment, Queen Maria Eutokia Toaputeito returned to the Rouru convent and died there as a novice on 27 August 1869. The Gambier Islands steadily fell under colonial influence, becoming a French protectorate in 1871 and fully annexed to the territory of French Oceania in 1881, today part of the overseas country of French Polynesia.

It was an early step in the process that, along with other publicized outrages involving black American soldiers, eventually resulted in President Harry S. Truman issuing Executive Order 9981, which desegregated the United State armed forces. Beginning within months of publication, the letter has been an inspiration for literature and the performing arts highlighting racial inequality. Life Trimmingham was born in Port of Spain, Trinidad, the son of Harris and Lillian Trimmingham. In 1917 he emigrated to Wales, where he was a merchant seaman from 1918 to 1921. He emigrated to the United States, sailing from Southampton, England, and arriving in New York on 13 October 1925. In 1928 he married and lived in Newark, New Jersey. On 23 August 1943 he married his second wife, Harriet B. Lawsen, in Pima County, Arizona. He joined the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1942, working as an electrician. After his discharge in 1946 he lived in Gary, Indiana, working for the Singer Sewing Machine Company as an electrician. He became a naturalized U. S. citizen in 1950. In 1956 he moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, where in died and was buried in Fairview Cemetery, Ann Arbor. His wife died in 2005 and is buried beside him.Obituary, Ann Arbor News, 11 May 1985; Ancestry.com. Incident and letter to Yank In April 1944 Trimmingham and eight fellow black soldiers were traveling by train from Camp Claiborne in central Louisiana to the military hospital at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, when the train made a one-day layover in a small Louisiana town. The next day the soldiers could find only one place that would serve them a meal, the rail station lunchroom, but only on the condition that they ate in the kitchen, not the lunchroom itself. Around 11:30 a.m. two dozen German prisoners of war, accompanied by two American guards, came into the lunchroom and were served lunch while Trimmingham and the men with him looked on from the kitchen. Trimmingham wrote a letter recounting the incident that was published in the 28 April 1944 edition of Yank Magazine. In it he expressed how earlier that month he: \\"stood on the outside looking on, and I could not help but ask myself these questions: are we not American soldiers, sworn to fight for and die if need be for this our country? Then why are they treated better than we are? Why does the Government allow such things to go on?\\"Carroll, Andrew, ed. War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2008), p. 315. The reaction to the letter was strong and immediate. In a follow-up letter published 28 July 1944, Trimmingham said that he had received 287 letters, 183 from whites, supporting his position. The editors reported that Yank had received \\"a great number of comments from GIs, almost all of whom were outraged by the treatment given the corporal.\\"Brinkley, Douglas, ed.

Hill also met with President Donald Trump at the White House on at least four occasions to discuss various issues. Hill opposes the legalization of marijuana in Indiana and medical marijuana; in November 2017, Hill issued an official advisory opinion declaring the use of cannabidiol oil illegal in Indiana.Curtis Hill, Why I found that CBD oil is illegal, Indianapolis Star (December 14, 2017).Indiana Attorney General Official Opinion 2017-7 Re: Cannabidiol & HEA 1148, November 21, 2017. Although a state law passed in April 2018 legalized the possession and use of a particular cannabidiol oil by persons registered with the Indiana Department of Health, Hill determined that the selling or distributing CBD oil was still illegal \\"under any circumstances, and even individuals entitled to use CBD oil under state law still are prohibited by federal law from doing so.\\"Dan Carden, Attorney general finds cannabidiol remains illegal in Indiana, despite law authorizing limited use, The Times of Northwest Indiana (November 22, 2017). The following year, the Indiana General Assembly overruled Hill's opinion, passing new legislation reaffirming and expanding CBD's legality in Indiana; the bill was passed 97-0 in the House and 36-11 in the Senate and was signed into law by Governor Eric Holcomb.Dan Carden, New Indiana law clarifies that CBD oil is legal for all Hoosiers to use, The Times of Northwest Indiana (March 21, 2018). Hill strongly opposes needle exchange programs,Mike Emery, AG Curtis Hill says Wayne County exemplifies needle exchange dangers, Richmond Palladium-Item (June 21, 2018). and successfully pressured Madison County to halt its program.Adam Wren, Does Indy Need A Needle Exchange Program?, Indianapolis Monthly (December 2017). He favors harsher penalties for drug offenses, and supported the use of civil forfeiture. In 2017, Hill filed an appeal from a U.S. district court decision holding that Indiana's forfeiture law was a violation of the U.S. Constitution's due process clause. In 2017, Hill joined with other conservative attorneys general in a filing in the U.S. Supreme Court defending \\"stop-and-frisk\\" programs from constitutional challenge. In August 2017, Hill was criticized by some state legislators for spending $279,000 in state funds for renovations to his office at the Indiana State House, and for spending almost $31,000 in state funds for the purchase of a large passenger van to serve as a mobile office. Hill's office defended the expenditures.Tony Cook, Attorney General Curtis Hill catches heat for spending on new van, office renovations, Indy Stat (August 16, 2017). As attorney general, Hill is leading a 17-state lawsuit against the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, seeking to strike down a Massachusetts state animal welfare law that would require eggs, pork and veal sold in Massachusetts \\"to come from animals raised with room to lie down and turn around without touching an enclosure\\" beginning in 2022. Under Hill, Indiana also sued California over a law that bars eggs sold in California from coming from battery cage hens.Nick Janzen, Indiana To Fight Another Food Production Law, WFYI (December 17, 2017). In 2018, Hill filed an appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, seeking to challenge a settlement between the Marion County Sheriff's Office and American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana that stopped the county from detaining people in Indianapolis based only on federal immigration agency requests and without a warrant or probable cause.Indiana AG Challenges Settlement Over Immigration Detentions, Associated Press (January 11, 2018). Hill asserted that the settlement would endanger public safety. In 2018, Hill objected to a consent decree to add additional early voting locations in Marion County. The decree, resulting from an agreement between Common Cause Indiana. the Indianapolis NAACP, and the county Election Board, resolved a voting rights lawsuit. The consent decree was approved over Hill's objections by U.S. District Judge Sarah Evans Barker, who wrote: \\"The state's lawyers may entertain what preferences they will, but violations of federal rights justify the imposition of federal remedies.\\"Mark Alesia and Holly V. Hays, Judge denies Curtis Hill's challenge to agreement for early voting sites in Marion County, Indianapolis Star (August 10, 2018). Hill was criticized for his intervention in the case by Common Cause, the NAACP, and the Election Board, as well as Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson (a fellow Republican) who said that: \\"By his reckless action, the Attorney General has disrupted more than 18 months of productive bi-partisan conversations.\\"Phil Cannelongo, Federal judge denies efforts by AG Curtis Hill to stop satellite voting agreement in Marion County, WTHR (August 9, 2018).Holly V. Hays, Curtis Hill draws criticism for 'reckless' challenge of early-voting case, Indianapolis Star (August 8, 2018). Hill opposed the adoption of hate-crime laws (Indiana is one of five U.S. states without such laws). In 2019, Indiana adopted a bias-motivated crimes law, but the law's failure to list gender identity, gender, or sex as specifically protected classes prompted criticism from anti-hate groups (such as the Anti-Defamation League, which termed the omissions \\"unacceptable\\"). Hill defended the new law in an op-ed.AG Curtis Hill: New hate crimes law protects everyone, WTHR (April 9, 2019). In 2017, Hill staked out a public position regarding athletes who have protested police violence against black citizens. In an essay distributed to news outlets, Hill criticizing the players' methods and message, writing that the number of instances of police brutality \\"is but a fraction of the number of black people murdered by black people\\" and that \\"(black-on-black violence) deserves the attention of every American.\\" As attorney general, Hill has used personal email accounts to conduct public business, a practice that is not illegal, but is discouraged by experts in open government and cybersecurity.Ryan Martin, Curtis Hill is breaking state record laws by keeping his email address secret, Indianapolis Star (April 11, 2019). In documents produced to the Indianapolis Star following a public-records request made by the newspaper in July 2018, Hill's office redacted personal email addresses. In March 2019, following a complaint by the Star, Indiana Public Access Counselor Luke H. Britt released an opinion stating that Hill's office violated the Indiana Access to Public Records Act by redacting \\"private email addresses embedded in otherwise disclosable public records.\\" Hill's office refused to produce the names of the email addresses even after being notified by the Indiana Public Access Counselor that Hill's office was in violation of the public-records laws, citing a different exemption as a reason to withhold the email addresses. During the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Indiana, when local governments imposed restrictions on the size of gatherings to prevent the spread of the virus, Hill sent a letter to Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett and Marion County health department head Virginia Caine, asserting that the restrictions, when applied to religious gatherings, were unconstitutional religious discrimination. The local government disagreed with Hill's position.Crystal Hill, AG Curtis Hill to Mayor Joe Hogsett: Church restrictions are unconstitutional religious discrimination, Indianapolis Star (May 14, 2020). =Sexual harassment investigations and temporary suspension of law license= In 2018, Hill has been accused by multiple women of inappropriate sexual behavior in March 2018. Four women have accused Hill of groping them during a party at a bar on the last night of the Indiana General Assembly session, prompting an investigation by the Indiana Inspector General.Ethan May, Tony Cook and Ryan Martin, Attorney General Curtis Hill: What we know about allegations of inappropriate touching, Indianapolis Star (July 6, 2018).Tony Cook, Ryan Martin & Kaitlin Lange, 4 women allege Indiana Attorney General Curtis Hill touched them inappropriately at bar, Indianapolis Star (July 2, 2018). At the request of General Assembly leadership, a law firm prepared a confidential memorandum dated June 2018 that summarized interviews with the woman; the memo was obtained by The Indianapolis Star and made public the following month. Of the four women, three have publicly come forward--State Representative Mara Candelaria Reardon and two legislative staffers.Aide to Bremen state senator becomes third woman to publicly accuse Curtis Hill of groping, South Bend Tribune (July 13, 2018). The accusations against Hill prompted calls for his resignation from top elected officials in the state, including fellow Republicans, such as Governor Eric Holcomb, House Speaker Brian Bosma, and Senate leader David C. Long. Mike Braun, the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2018, also called on him to resign. Hill said he would not resign, and denied allegations of misconduct. Republican attorney Jim Bopp set up a legal defense fund to cover costs of Hill's defense.Ryan Martin, Kaitlin Lange and Tony Cook, Special prosecutor appointed for Curtis Hill investigation — and it's not his first rodeo, Indianapolis Star (July 25, 2018). In July 2018, a Marion Superior Court judge appointed Daniel Sigler to serve as special prosecutor investigating the allegations against Hill. The Marion County Prosecutor asked the court to make the appointment to avoid a conflict of interest, because Hill, in his capacity as state attorney general, is representing the county prosecutor's office in civil litigation.Tony Cook, Special prosecutor sought in Curtis Hill groping investigation, Indianapolis Star (July 25, 2018). Hill unsuccessfully sought to block the appointment of the special prosecutor.Mark Alesia, Curtis Hill's attempt to block special prosecutor is 'plainly wrong,' Terry Curry says, Indianapolis Star (July 25, 2018). In October 2018, special prosecutor Sigler publicly announced the results of his investigation, concluding that the allegations of the accusers were \\"credible and true\\" but that there was not enough evidence to support a conviction for misdemeanor battery given the difficulties of proving Hill's state of mind.Tony Cook, Ryan Martin and Kaitlin Lange, No charges against Hill, but investigation reveals searing new details, Indianapolis Star (October 24, 2018). Simultaneously with the release of Sigler's findings, Inspector General Lori Torres released the results of his office's investigation into Hill's conduct the same day; the report was critical of Hill's conduct on the night in question, but determined that Hill did not violate state ethics laws when using state resources to defend himself. Torres said that \\"the public and others will judge whether the evidence in this case disqualifies Hill from holding elected office in the future.\\" In March 2019, the Indiana Supreme Court Disciplinary Commission, which oversees the ethical rules governing attorneys in the state, filed a complaint against Hill, alleging that he violated the Indiana Rules of Professional Conduct by engaging in acts of battery or sexual battery against the women.Tony Cook, Ryan Martin & Kaitlin Lange, Complaint could cost Attorney General Curtis Hill his law license — and elected position, Indianapolis Star (March 15, 2019). In a response, Hill said that the Supreme Court should not become involved in allegations against him.Kaitlin Lange & Ryan Martin, Curtis Hill says Supreme Court shouldn't get involved in allegations against him, Indianapolis Star (March 22, 2019). At a four-day hearing in October 2019, the four women who accused Hill of groping them at the March 2018 party testified against Hill; a fifth woman gave evidence that Hill had propositioned her when she worked under him at the prosecutor's office in Elkhart County.Tony Cook & Tim Evans, Disciplinary commission: Suspend AG Curtis Hill's law license for 2 years, Indianapolis Star (December 17, 2019). In December 2019, the Disciplinary Commission issued a filing calling Hill's actions \\"deliberate, loathsome and demeaning\\" and recommending that Hill's license to practice law be suspended for at least two years. In February 2020, the hearing officer in the case, former Indiana Supreme Court justice Myra Selby, concluded that Hill had committed battery and had violated the ethical rule requiring attorneys \\" to behave in a manner that upholds public esteem for the legal system,\\" but found that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Hill had committed sexual battery or violated the ethical rule requiring lawyers to \\"promise to abstain from offensive personality.\\"Crystal Hill, Disciplinary hearing officer recommends 60-day suspension in Curtis Hill groping case, Indianapolis Star (February 15, 2020). Selby recommended that the state Supreme Court suspend Hill from the practice of law for 60 days, without automatic reinstatement. In March 2020, the state House passed (by an 84-9 vote) an amendment filed by Representative Timothy Wesco, Republican of Elkhart, that would provide that \\"if the individual who holds the office of attorney general is disbarred in Indiana or suspended from the practice of law in Indiana for 30 or more days or at any time during the five years before taking office, the individual forfeits the office and a vacancy in the office exists.\\"Crystal Hill, Gov. Holcomb says he would sign bill that could oust Attorney General Curtis Hill, Indianapolis Star (March 6, 2020). The bill would have had the effect of disqualifying Hill from office if he were suspended from the bar for 30 days or more; Governor Holcomb said he would sign the bill if it reached his desk. However, the bill died at the end of the legislative session, as the state House and state Senate did not both pass the measure.Crystal Hill, Bill that could have ousted Attorney General Curtis Hill won't become law, Indianapolis Star (March 12, 2020). On May 11, 2020, Hill's law license was suspended for 30 days by the Indiana Supreme Court, which unanimously found that Hill had committed a misdemeanor battery in 2018, and therefore violated the rules of professional conduct for attorneys.Olivia Covington, Hill's fight to stay AG continues, Indiana Lawyer (May 26, 2020). The suspension began May 18, 2020 and ended June 17, 2020. Hill said, \\"I accept with humility and respect the Indiana Supreme Court's ruling.\\" Governor Holcomb filed a motion asking the Indiana Supreme Court whether the suspension of Hill's license to practice law should result in his removal as attorney general; the governor suggested that if Hill were removed, he would be able to appoint a new attorney general. The Supreme Court declined to clarify Hill's status, since Holcomb was not a party to the underlying proceeding.Crystal Jill, Indiana Supreme Court denies Gov. Holcomb's request to clarify Curtis Hill's job status, Indianapolis Star (May 18, 2020).Tom Davies, Court sidesteps ruling on suspended Indiana AG, Associated Press (May 19, 2020). (Indiana law requires that the attorney general be \\"duly licensed to practice law in Indiana\\" but does not specify the effect of a suspension of a law license on eligibility.) Hill designated his chief deputy to supervise the AG's Office during his suspension. A lawsuit challenging the designation, and asking for the post of attorney general to be declared vacant during Hill's suspension, was filed by four members of Common Cause Indiana.Crystal Hill, Lawsuit asks court to declare vacancy during AG Curtis Hill's suspension, Indianapolis Star (May 21, 2020). =2020 re- election campaign= Despite the allegations against him, Hill continues to seek the Republican re-nomination for attorney general in the 2020 election. He is opposed by three challengers--Decatur County prosecutor Nate Harter, former U.S. Representative Todd Rokita, and Indianapolis attorney John Westercamp--all of whom have called into question Hill's fitness for office. The nominee will be selected through a Republican state convention, rather than a primary election. Two Democrats, state Senator Karen Tallian and former Evansville Mayor Jonathan Weinzapfel, are seeking the Democratic nomination.Haley Carney, Decatur prosecutor challenging AG Hill for GOP nomination, TheStatehouseFile.com (April 23, 2020).

The provocative, politically charged slogans of his self-designed T-shirts brought his boutiques public attention on numerous occasions before the eventual closing of his second boutique in 2009. He released his debut album in 2001 and has since released many more. His song \\"Party in My Pants\\" appeared in the film Religulous. In 2015, Apollo appeared on the Israeli TV show HaKokhav HaBa (English: The Next Star), where he sang two original songs.Mako Israel Braunshtein's music consists primarily of spoken word, and often references or sexualizes celebrities, politicians, and religious figures. He began writing books in 1999 and has since published over a dozen books in English, as well as several in his native language Hebrew. The content of his writing includes philosophical essays, plays, poems, and frequently concerns sexuality (Braun is himself openly bisexual). In recent years, Braun has turned his attention to travel photography, releasing a series of books documenting his travel and research about repercussions of the Holocaust in countries such as Bulgaria, Mexico, and China.  Boutiques  In 2003, Braun opened two self-named boutiques in the Lower East Side of New York City. One at St. Marks Place closed in 2004, while the second on Orchard Street remained open until 2009. The boutique garnered attention for its flamboyant provocativeness: NYMag described it as a \\"wonderland for the sexually (and stylishly) uninhibited.\\" In 2008, Braun released a series of T-shirts with highly provocative slogans concerning presidential candidate Barack Obama, including \\"Obama = Hitler,\\" \\"Obama is my Slave,\\" \\"Jews Against Obama,\\" and \\"Who Killed Obama?\\" In July 2008, Metro New York ran a cover article about a 25-year old Manhattan graduate student who was allegedly assaulted by a group of four teenagers while wearing Braun's \\"Obama is My Slave\\" T-shirt. When Braun refused to allow the student to return the $69 shirt, she threatened to bring Braun to court, but never did. The media outlet Gawker later questioned the veracity of the story. In 2009, Braun closed his last boutique. He denied having financial difficulties, instead telling Racked New York he was \\"fleeing endless death threats\\" and that he is \\"just terrified from big black penises and [is] sure that Obama has a huge black penis.\\"  Music  Braun's music, which he creates under his birth name Doron Braunshtein, is mostly spoken word poetry. However he also created instrumental and vocal tracks in his earlier music. His poems often focus on American celebrities, satirizing the obsessiveness of American Pop culture. Some poems consists of overtly false news stories about celebrities, such as \\"Jenna Jameson Dead.\\" Other poems sexualize celebrities in surrealist ways, such as \\"Questions - And Answers - About Amal Alamuddin's Vagina.\\" Braunshtein's poetry also frequently toys with the subject of Judaism, his own religion, as well as Nazism and Adolf Hitler. In doing so Braunshtein creates strangely autobiographical poems. One such poem states \\"If I Wasn't a Jew, I Would be a Nazi. Or not!\\" Another common theme in Braunshtein's music is the phrase \\"after all,\\" which often acts in lieu of a rational justification for a surreal statement. An example of such a usage comes his poem \\"Michelle Obama's Last Words,\\" which states \\"After all, Jesus was black too!\\" Braunshtein's most famous poem is \\"Obama is My Nigger,\\" which has amassed 15,000 plays on Spotify as of March 2017.

He served as Premier Burgomaster of the capital of the Congo, Léopoldville, from 1960 until 1962. He later served in the National Assembly.  Biography  Daniel Kanza was born in 1909 in the Manianga area of the Luozi Territory. He received a Protestant Christian education before enlisting in the Force Publique, being stationed all over the Congo. He reached the rank of sergeant. After his service he became a Protestant deacon. Between 1929 and 1940 Kanza had seven children with Élisabeth Mansangaza, including future sociologist and politician Sophie Kanza and future politician and diplomat Thomas Kanza. He worked as a functionary in the colonial administration. In 1957 he became vice president of the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO) party. He was arrested after the Léopoldville riots of 4 January 1959. Kanza attended the Belgo-Congolese Round Table Conference in Brussels on behalf of ABAKO in January 1960, and was chosen to be a vice president of the talks. He heavily criticized party president Joseph Kasa-Vubu for his attitude during the conference and his failure to consult other party members. Kasa-Vubu also pushed for a federalist government, which Kanza strongly opposed in favor of a unitary system. He and two of his sons published a series of articles in a Congolese newspaper they ran that accused Kasa-Vubu of collaborating with France to divide the Congo. After Kasa-Vubu walked out of the conference, Kanza attempted to assume leadership over the party but most members remained loyal to Kasa-Vubu. During the conference questions were raised over whether Belgium should retain any powers or official responsibilities in the Congo after 30 June. Kanza was appointed to a committee formed to address the problem, and ultimately it was decided that the Congolese state should assume all responsibilities of governance. Kanza was expelled from ABAKO on 1 February. On 4 March, he announced the formation of a dissident wing of the party, which became known as ABAKO-Kanza. This later transformed into the Alliance des Congolais (ALCO). Most of Kanza's support came from the Manianga area of the Luozi Territory. The Manianga Council, a regional association, unsuccessfully attempted to reconcile him and Kasa-Vubu. In October he was elected Premier Burgomaster of Léopoldville. The following year he dismissed all European members of the city council. Kanza left office in June 1962 when ABAKO had him removed and replaced by a candidate they preferred. In January 1965 a group of Maniangans nominated him as candidate for national senator in anticipation of upcoming elections. However, the Lower Congo provincial governor demanded personal loyalty from all local candidates. Kanza refused to pledge such, and as a result was not included on the ballot for ABAKO. Yet by 1972 he was serving in the National Assembly. He died in 1990.

A library committee was formed in 1904 by the Village Improvement Association. Dr. J.C. Pelot donated a lot at 12th St. West and Avenue West for the library to be built on. In 1904, T. J. Bachman loaned $500 to aid in the construction of a small library. In 1914, $10,000 was given by the Carnegie Foundation to establish the first library in the area, Palmetto Carnegie Library. In 1918 the County Library System was established with the opening of the Bradenton Carnegie Library, where the first bookmobile was started in 1956. That same year, some additions were added to the Bradenton Carnegie Library, increasing the overall square footage by one third. In 1963, a plan was approved for a countywide system which allowed the cities of Bradenton and Palmetto to join together with Manatee County. From 1966 to 1969, the South Manatee Branch Library and the Island Branch Library were built. In the early 1970s, the idea of a large central library was proposed by the county. On April 24, 1978 the Central Library was opened to county citizens. In 1990, the library system decided to use the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) to catalog books and other items. OCLC has become a vital part of the information infrastructure that supports research, scholarship, and learning around the world.http://eds.b.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&sid;=75fdf973-0171-41e0-85d5-0c9570630217%40pdc- v-sessmgr05 In 1992, a text-only computer was added to the libraries that was connected to the Bradenton Herald newspaper and had access to the index software. Two years later, one public computer was added for the use of word processing and educational software. In 1996, the first online catalog computers were added for the staff, which replaced the old large wooden card catalogs. Soon after, a few were added for patrons to use. In 2000, the Central Library gained twelve Windows-based PCs in the second-floor computer lab, thanks to a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2001, bookmobiles were updated, but their services ended in 2010. Throughout the 2010s, other technology was brought to the library, such as iPads, PCs, laptops, e-readers, and Wifi systems to enhance patrons' experience.  Elizabeth Eaton Florida History Reading Room  Elizabeth M. Eaton was a local philanthropist of Manatee County who created a trust provision in her will for the Manatee County Library System. The room is located at the Downtown Central Library. It contains a special collection of Manatee County's historical materials which came from local library collections and from the Manatee Historical Society. The materials include yearbooks, telephone books, directories, oral interviews, and archival negatives. The yearbooks are from local private and high schools dating back to 1916, and the telephone directories date back to 1897. The federal census for Florida starting in 1830 is on microfilm. There are also microfilm copies of local Manatee County newspapers, weekly and daily, as well as older magazines. Patrons can access historical maps and aerial photos of different time periods of the county.  Genealogy collection  The Manatee County Public Library has a genealogy collection for patrons to use to learn about their family history. Most materials are for in-house use only, but some may be checked out. The collection focuses on areas east of the Mississippi River and the colonial states. Patrons can search through census indexes, as well as marriage, birth, death, and other vital records. The library system provides manuals to inform patrons on how to search through the vast amounts of records. Other materials show how to identify name changes, nation migration trails, genealogical periodicals, military rosters, and church records. Patrons also have access to foreign ancestry materials to show immigration and passenger lists, guides to research foreign countries, and migration and settlements in the United States. Online genealogy resources are available, such as Heritage Quest Online and America's Genealogy Bank.

The inscriptions are important records of Theravada Buddhist history and of that era.  History  The ordination hall was first built by King Dhammazedi of the Hanthawaddy Kingdom in 1476 to re-ordain the kingdom's Buddhist monks, in an effort to purify the kingdom's Sangha, which had undergone several internal schisms. To this end, in 1476, Dhammazedi sent 22 senior monks and their disciples to Sri Lanka, where they were re-ordained at the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara. After the monks had returned, Dhammazedi built the Kalyani Ordination Hall, which derives its name from the Kelani River in Sri Lanka. The construction of the first Kalyani Ordination Hall spurred construction of similarly-named Kalyani Ordination Halls; throughout the Hanthawaddy Kingdom, 9 large ones and 107 small ones were constructed. The ordination hall was destroyed several times. Portuguese explorers burnt the structure in 1599, and King Alaungpaya destroyed the hall during his invasion of Bago in 1757. The ordination hall was also destroyed by fires and earthquakes, including an earthquake in 1930 that levelled the structure completely. The extant ordination hall was reconstructed in 1954.

He entered as a boarder in a religious college at age 11. Unhappy during these \\"overwhelming years\\", he took refuge in reading the works of Balzac, Stendhal and above all, Jean de La Fontaine. For love of literature, he believed he had the vocation of a journalist and studied at the École supérieure de journalisme de Lille between 1962 and 1966. He did his military service as a cooperant in an educational service in Quebec. He extended his stay there by working in a weekly supplement in the Montreal press. Assistant to the Quiet Revolution, he dreamed of staying permanently in this country after falling in love with Mara, a bookseller from Latvia, as he recounts in his narrative Courlande.  Hostage in Lebanon  Returning to France in 1970, he was employed as a journalist for Radio France Internationale for seven years, then to AFP. In 1977, he joined the editorial office of the daily Le Matin de Paris and in 1984 became a grand reporter for '. While his magazine sent him to Lebanon, he was abducted in Beirut with sociologist Michel Seurat on 22 May 1985. His wife was actively committed to his releaseIna.fr Affaire Kauffman which happened on 4 May 1988 with other hostages, through the intervention of Jean-Charles Marchiani, while Jacques Chirac was Prime minister of François Mitterrand. Michel Seurat, for his part, died in custody in 1986. On the occasion of this abduction, Jean-Paul Kauffman lived the traumatic experience of traveling on several occasions, wrapped in an Oriental carpet where asphyxia led him to lose consciousness, which led him to deepen his reflection and strongly marked his life:  Writer  In 1994, Jean-Paul Kauffmann created the magazine L'Amateur de cigare. As a writer, he published L' (1993) which earned the Prix Jean- Freustié, then La Chambre noire de Longwood : le voyage à Sainte-Hélène (1997) which was awarded numerous prizes (prix Roger Nimier, Grand Prix Lire-RTL, Prix Jules-Verne, prix Joseph-Kessel and ) ; La Lutte avec l'Ange (2001) and 31, allées Damour - Raymond Guérin 1905-1955 (2004). All these books have a common theme: enclosure, but never directly evoke his experience of hostage. In 2002, Jean-Paul Kauffmann received the Grand prix de littérature Paul- Morand awarded by the Académie française. For the first time in 2007, in La Maison du retour (2007), he evokes his captivity, his hostage position and the moments that followed his return, the painful relearning a \\"normal\\" life, his inability to read, him the literature enthusiast. As in all Jean-Paul Kauffmann's books, everything is written in a hushed tone through the history of buying a house, a den or an airlock to return to his family, towards life. An amateur of Bordeaux wines, he has published several books on this subject. With Courlande (Fayard, 2009), the story of a journey is the plot of several quests including that of the identity of a country, Courland.

The She-Wolf with Romulus and Remus, sculpture by Francesco Biggi and Domenico Parodi in the Palazzo Rosso of Genoa, Italy The she-wolf on a coin of the late Roman republic (c.77 BC) In the Roman foundation myth, it was a she-wolf that nursed and sheltered the twins Romulus and Remus after they were abandoned in the wild by order of King Amulius of Alba Longa. She cared for the infants at her den, a cave known as the Lupercal, until they were discovered by a shepherd, Faustulus. Romulus would later become the founder and first king of Rome. The image of the she-wolf suckling the twins has been a symbol of Rome since ancient times and is one of the most recognizable icons of ancient mythology.Wiseman Remus preface pg xiii Origins There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Osco-Umbrian word for wolf: hirpus).Strabo Book V Ch.12 (Loeb pg.467) The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the twins, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman god Mars, the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupercalia. In Greek mythology, Apollo's mother Leto is reported to have given birth to him as a she-wolf, to evade Hera. Literary sources The 3 \\"canonical\\" versions of the myth—those of Livy, Plutarch and Dionysius of Halicarnassus—all draw heavily on Quintus Fabius Pictor.Dionysius I 79 He is considered one of Rome's earliest historians and his now lost work describes the she-wolf and her episode with the twins. The twins were abandoned at the order of Amulius. Some tales claim that they were to be left along the riverbank, others that they were to be cast into the water. The servant charged with the task either thought better of it, or could not get close enough to do the deed because of the flooding. Instead, he left them in the standing water that had formed at the foot of Palatine Hill. The twins were found either after their basket had been left at the foot of the fig tree, or came to rest there after floating in the water. In each case, the she-wolf rescued them and gently cared for them in or near the Lupercal. Later, they were discovered by local shepherds. Dionysius reports that the rains had raised the water so much so that Amulius' servant had to abandon the twins, before the intended spot (where the current was stronger). The basket, containing the twins, gently went with the receding water until it struck a stone, flipping the twins and the basket into the mud. The she-wolf then arrived and lowered her teats to the crying babes, and licked them clean of the mud. After a shepherd happened upon the scene in the course of tending his flock, he ran to tell his companions, and a group gathered to witness the remarkable sight. The twins were clinging to her as she was their true mother. The she-wolf was nonplussed when the men began making a ruckus to scare her off. She withdrew into a cave that was sacred to the Greek colonists who had formerly lived in the area and held an altar to the nature god Pan.Dionysius I ch.79 Livy claims that the servants of Amulius dropped the twins in the standing water out of simple laziness. The fig tree just happened to be the first spot they came to and they figured the twins would drown no matter what. The twins cried in their basket until the waters receded and left them back on land. The she-wolf arrived from the hills looking for a drink of water when she heard their cries.Livy I pp.17-19 The servant was too afraid of the torrential waters to fully carry out the king's orders, according to Plutarch. After being left on the bank, the waters rose further and swept the twins away. It gently carried them along and then dropped them at the fig tree.Plutarch Romulus IV pp.99 The three relay accounts wherein the term \\"lupa\\" refers not to a she-wolf, but is a slang word for prostitute. Plutarch tells two other stories not involving the she-wolf or abandonment. In one, the twins are fathered by Hercules after he wins a dice game. Their mother is the unwitting \\"prize\\". In another, the twins are switched at birth by their grandfather for a different pair of infants and secreted out of the city to be raised by shepherds and later, educated in nearby Gabii.Plutarch Romulus IV pp.101-105 Iconography Figurehead from the title page of Geschichte der Kunst des Alterhums Vol. 1 (1776) by Johann Joachim Winckelmann. Winckelmann was a pioneer in the study of Graeco-Roman art and ancient Roman art in particular. He is center, with the she-wolf suckling the twins and Homer closest to him. The Sphinx and an Etruscan vase are in the background. =Earliest representation= The \\"Bolsena Mirror\\" features a depiction of the she-wolf and the twins surrounded by human and animal figures. Differences in interpretation have precluded virtually any consensus regarding many of its features.Mazzoni pp173-178 This includes its age. However, it is consistent with other such mirrors, made as bridal gifts, in 4th century BC Euritria, perhaps circa 330-340. The famous Capitoline Wolf may be of Etruscan or Old Latin origin.Tennant p.81 But, a discovery during its restoration in 2000 and radiocarbon dating has cast doubt on an ancient origin.Adriano La Regina,\\"Roma, l'inganno della Lupa è \\"nata\\" nel Medioevo \\"Rome: the phony She- Wolf wasn't born until the Middle-ages\\" La Republica. 17 November 2006, accessed 1 December 2016 A stele from Bologna, dated to between 350-400 BC, depicts an animal, possibly a wolf, nursing a single infant. By 269 BC, the silver didrachm is the earliest depiction of the complete icon, with the characteristic \\"turning of the she-wolf's head\\" backward and downward at the twins.Rissanen p.336 The distinctive imagery of the she-wolf and the twins made it more recognizable than other symbols of the city, such as Roma, the patron deity of the city, or the Roman eagle. That was useful as the Roman world expanded and symbols of Rome became more important in maintaining unity. By the 1st century AD, the she-wolf was common in both Rome and the provinces. She and the twins were featured on the elaborate Ara Pacis, built in honor of Augustus and dedicated to Pax, the goddess of peace.Rissanen p.336-8 Coins with their depiction were minted and widely circulated. They were also produced in Roman Colonies as a way to express their own \\"Roman-ness\\".Rissanen p.339 They have been found on personal items such as swords, buckles, lamps and statuettes as well as monuments, mosaic floors and funerary stones that date from the 1st through the 3rd centuries AD.Rissanen p.343-7 File:Bolsena mirror Roscher Lexikon p1465.jpgThe controversial Mirror of Bolsena.

It is a popular destination for both locals and international tourists for its murals and scenic setting. History and environs Ihwa Mural Village is located between Hyehwa Station and Dongdaemun Station, just below Naksan Park. In 2006, when the public art project started, Ihwa-dong, one of Seoul's oldest neighbourhoods, was a decaying suburb designated for demolition, and home to mostly poor families and elderly people. The government's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism \\"Art in the City\\" campaign set about to improve conditions in some of these areas, and included the Ihwa-dong Naksan Project in Iwha-dong and Dongsung-dong near Daehangno in central Seoul. Ihwa-dong is adjacent to Changgyeonggung Palace on the slopes of Mount Naksan. Jongno-gu's mural village sits at the foot of Naksan Park and is called \\"Ihwa village\\" or \\"Ihwa mural village\\". Ihwa-dong and Dongsung-dong were culturally isolated towns despite their location near the busy college area of Daehangno, and the historic neighborhood of Dongdaemun with its many tourist activities. Ihwa-dong was one of South Korea's many daldongnae or 'moon villages', a name derived from their hilltop locations, traditionally thought to offer a better view of the moon than the cities below. They were inhabited by mostly working class and poor people who couldn't afford housing in flat or central parts of the city. The mural village sat against the old boundary walls of the capital and was a place where refugees squatted after the end of the Korean War in the 1950s, building homes wherever they could. Many residents worked in the nearby garment and textile industries in Changsin-dong making items sold at Dongdaemun Market. But, as other neighborhoods prospered in the 80's and 90's, with high-rise apartment towers, and the redevelopment of early 2000, residents started moving away, draining the neighborhood's vitality. 2013 \\"Flower staircase\\" mural, removed by residents in April 2016. Artwork =Project beginnings= The village was part of the history of street paintings in South Korea, with locals and visiting artists carrying out similar projects around the country. In the mural village, buildings and surroundings became part of the art; flowerpots, telephone poles, stone fences, stairs and even \\"the crack on a wall has been transformed into a wrinkle on a smiling woman’s face\\". The 2006 project took about six months, with citizens and college students, including nearby Hansung University students recruited to volunteer. About 70 artists participated with the paintings and installation art that covered the walls, streets, homes, businesses, underpasses and schools. One of the artworks was a wall of the neighborhood police station which was painted with white eagles and Korea's national flower, the Rose of Sharon; others were a house with the image of Mount Naksan, the painting of a rabbit, the wings of an angel, and a flower staircase. Over the years, the art had a continued evolution of additions and changes. =Naksan Park artwork= The region at the foot of Naksan Park is a preamble to the mural village with its steel art structures. The park was established in 2002 to increase green areas in the region and restore the historical site, as much of the mountain area was destroyed during the Japanese colonial era and again during re-development projects of the 1960s. It is one of the most popular photo spots, and sculptures include a gentleman and dog walking towards the sky and a couple holding hands and looking at each other. Popularity problems, art removed and re-added Naksan Park steel sculptures, N Seoul Tower seen in distance, 2015.2013 'Silent Campaign'. The 2006 art project brought people back, and a sense of community with art collectives and communal gardens. But the influx of tourists and their littering, noise and graffiti made long-term residents of the neighborhood wonder if the changes were for the better. About a year after the project began, they requested the removal of many of the murals, amounting to almost half the original art. In 2010, the KBS2 entertainment show 2 Days & 1 Night with Lee Seung-gi was filmed in the village and made a \\"wing mural\\" with two white angel wings so popular among tourists that the resident removed the artwork. Later, more wing murals were painted elsewhere. In 2012, it was used by the SBS drama Rooftop Prince as a filming location, where Lee Gak (Park Yoo-chun) had a date with Park-ha (Han Ji-min), which became a stop on the typical Korean Wave tour course. In 2013, Jongno-gu's tourism division started the \\"Silent Campaign\\", \\"to help visitors understand that the (mural) village is also someone’s home\\", said staffer Lee Sun-min. Lim Young-suk, one of the artists involved in both the 2006 and 2013 projects, said the connection forged between art, the residents and visitors is at the heart of the village, \\"You come up, and you’re in a village where everybody knows everybody, and then you go down and you’re in the city. Up here, everybody enjoys life together.\\" Also, in 2013, artists united again and added another 60 displays, which brought the total number of works to more than a hundred. Professional artists, and students from Kookmin University, Konkuk University, Chung-Ang University, Dankook University and Ewha Womans University made contributions. By 2015 it had become even more popular with locals and a tourist destination for international travelers, with a continued tourism spike that year. The influx of visitors to the village continued to create problems for local residents, including a loss of privacy. In April 2016, this resulted in the removal of more artwork by residents. The most popular mural in the village, called 'flower staircase', which had been renovated in 2013 with colored irregular tiles, was painted over with grey paint, along with another mural 'fish staircase'. Efforts were being made by government and locals to build a better relationship between residents and visitors. Local artists addressed the issue by taking more care to integrate residents into projects, By 2016, there were about 100 nationwide areas where murals had been created, and ten mural villages in Seoul.

He served as one of the regents for his nephew Maputeoa and was instrumental in the conversion of Mangareva and the Gambier Islands to Roman Catholicism. His name is often written as Matoua. Biography Matua was the son of Terehi-kura and Mapurure (also known as Te Mateoa), the King or ʻAkariki (paramount chief) of Mangareva, who was known to be alive in 1825 and said to have died in 1830 or 1832. Because his elder brother Te Ikatohara was killed by sharks in about 1824, his son and Matua's nephew Maputeoa became king after Mapurure's death. Matua served as regent during the minority of his nephew and enjoyed the full trust of his people and may have had intentions of usurping power. As ʻakariki (paramount chief), the young king Maputeoa had complete authority over the kingdom, excepting his four uncles, who jointly owned the land with the king. The uncles' allegiance to the king was only formal. On August 1834, French Pipcus missionaries, headed by Father Honoré Laval and Father François Caret from Chile of the order of the Congregation of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary, landed at Mangareva, but were rebuffed by the king. They managed to land on a small island where the local chief gave them support to learn the Mangareva language and the islanders learned about Christianity. Within one year of their arrival, the missionaries converted the islanders at Taravai, Aukena and Akamaru to Christianity, established churches, and even made the islanders wear tunics. Father Caret and Father Laval eventually converted Matua and he donated the marae (temples) to the missionaries to build churches. Fearing the ulterior intentions of his uncle, Maputeoa began appearing in churches during mass. Matua and Maputeoa consented to the dismantling of the Te Keika marae, which was the largest of its kind on Rikitea, and in its place, St. Michael's Cathedral was built, which became the largest church in the South Pacific islands. Both uncle and nephew reconciled with each other around this time after the deathbed baptism of an aunt of the king. On 11 May 1835, Matua and his family were baptized. Matua had his long hair, sacred in the old pagan religion, cut short. He was baptized with the name Marie-Etienne, written as Maria Tepano in the Mangarevan language, in honor of Étienne Jérôme Rouchouze, the Vicar Apostolic of Eastern Oceania. King Maputeoa was baptized later on 25 August 1836 at the Church of Saint-Joseph-de-Taku on Mangareva along with 160 other people of the kingdom. With his wife Toa-Matui, he had a son, Akakio Tematereikura, who served as regent of Mangareva in 1869. When French naval explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville visited Mangareva with the ships Astrolabe and Zélée in 1838, he met \\"Matoua\\" and his nephew King \\"Mapou-Teoa\\". Jacques Marescot du Thilleul, an artist with the expedition, drew a picture of the king, Matua, and another chief named \\"Mabou-Kouiké\\". Matua's exact date of death is unknown, although he was last described in French sources as alive in 1840. He was buried in a chapel at the Kara-Ea Cemetery.

Early life Born in Coolock, Dublin, Ireland in 1892, Murnane was the third son of David and Mary (née Cummins) Murnane. At the time of the 1901 census the family lived in Carrick- on-Suir, Co Tipperary; their religion was recorded as Roman Catholic and the father's occupation was given as head constable in the Royal Irish Constabulary. Murnane joined the Royal Engineers and served in Gallipoli in the World War I; there he suffered typhoid as a result of drinking water from poisoned wells. As 2nd Lieutenant, he was commended for conspicuous gallantry in action in 1916https://www.thegazette.co.uk/Edinburgh/issue/13001/page/1895 and was awarded the Military Cross. His rank was given as Captain according to a National Archives online record.http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C1097039?descriptiontype=Full&ref;=WO+339/43146 An engineering graduate of Queen's University Belfast, when he applied for membership of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1917 he gave his home address as Dunsany, Co. Meath. Work on Singapore water supply projects Murnane joined the Municipal Water Department in February 1920 and became the head of the department in 1925. Significantly, during his time, Singapore began importing water from Gunong Pulai in Johor (now part of Malaysia). Under an agreement with the Sultan of Johore, raw water began to flow on 2 June 1927 and, as a result, the \\"danger of a water famine in Singapore ... had practically disappeared\\". Filtered water from newly built reservoirs and filters in Gunong Pulai began to flow on 31 December 1929 This water flowed by gravity to the Pearl's Hill Reservoir about 33 miles away. At that time the population of Singapore was 525,000 and water consumption was 16.5 million gallons per day. The total project cost was $16.2 million, a tremendous investment which would cause Singapore water rates to be the highest in Malaya. Arguably, the Gunong Pulai water supply project was the most significant public infrastructure project undertaken in water-scarce Singapore. It was reviewed favourably in 1928 by a visiting independent commissioner from Burma who said it was the biggest municipal project he had heard of in the region. The Municipal Treasurer reported in 1930 that he found the project was managed to a very high standard in terms of financial controls. For photographs of the Sultan Ibrahim reservoir at Gunong Pulai, which was handed back by the Singapore Public Utilities Board to Malaysia in 2011, including the commemorative plaque with the names of the key engineering staff, click through the footnote By 1938 Singapore needed additional water supply for the growing population and Murnane was responsible for the long term planning: 'many a water-works engineer spends his time carrying out the plans of his predecessor and thinking out the work to be done by his successor'.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19380626-1.2.129?ST=1&AT;=advanced&K;=Water%20Engineer%20singapore%20&KA;=Water%20Engineer%20singapore%20&DF;=05/12/1900&DT;=15/02/1950&NPT;=&L;=&CTA;=&P;=5&Display;=0&filterS;=0&QT;=water,%20engineer,%20singapore&oref;=article Murnane proposed a major $5.5 million investment which involved a new 39\\" duplicate pipeline from Gunong Pulai to Singapore, a doubling of water treatment capacity in the Johor reservoirs, and the building of a large new permanent reservoir in Seletar in Singapore. By this date water consumption in Singapore was 21 million gallons per day. The Straits Times on 2 April 1939 has photos of construction work including one of Murnane supervising the works which involved 1,400 workers installing -ton lengths of pipe. Murnane was already planning a second major water supply project in Johor, this time tapping the Johore river near Kota Tinggi. He oversaw a one-year experiment which demonstrated the river water could be turned into \\"pure sparkling drinking water\\". The municipality of Singapore either approved or was about to approve the project in 1941 but stopped because of the war. After the war Murnane made the case for the $40 million investment in the Johor river water supply project which was ultimately undertaken by his successor F. G. Hill Reflections on Singapore water supply and comparisons with other cities in Asia Murnane gave a talk to the Singapore Rotary Club in 1932 about 'the most plentiful thing on earth' i.e. water. He told his audience that 'the traveller coming to Singapore is surprised to hear that we drink water from the tap; it is something unusual for this part of the world'. He ended with the surprising statement that 'No town in the world takes greater precautions to ensure the purity of its [water] supply [than Singapore]; no town in the world has a purer or safer supply [than Singapore]'. In a vote of thanks the municipal water engineer was described as 'the one man who is probably more responsible than any other for our health, which is the keystone of our happiness.' Under Murnane, the quality of the water supply improved. All mains water in Singapore was filtered for the first time in 1927 and he dealt with the problem of seasonal water discolouration around the same time. One of his first annual reports (1927) was 'voluminous having no less than 19 tables not to mention charts and appendices'.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19281011-1.2.9?ST=1&AT;=advanced&K;=Water%20Engineer%20singapore%20&KA;=Water%20Engineer%20singapore%20&DF;=05/12/1900&DT;=15/02/1950&NPT;=&L;=&CTA;=&P;=6&Display;=0&filterS;=0&QT;=water,%20engineer,%20singapore&oref;=article At the end of his career he declared that water purity was tested '50–60 times daily' and was always found to be pure. The Water Department pursued its own research and development and in 1932 Murnane reported excellent test results of a specially-made rubber water pipe that had been submerged in the sea for 2 years. The water department also tested the performance of copper pipes under local conditions and these were approved as safe for use in 1932. There was public disquiet about Singapore water charges which were the highest of any town in Malaya on account of \\"the high overhead cost of the Johore supply scheme\\". For a discussion of the impact of water charges on the poor in Singapore in 1936, a comparison of water charges in towns and cities in Malaya and a discussion on why the water department should not be a profit-oriented trading department, see extensive footnote. Water meters had begun to be introduced in Singapore by 1902, a year in which the then head of the Water Department, Robert Peirce, faced a serious 'water famine'. By 1935, a flat water meter rental charge of 50 cents per month was being levied on all households, 'a trifling sum to the rich man but a heavy drain on the income of a poor man'. It is often assumed that Singapore's focus on water conservation and efficiency is a recent phenomenon. According to The Sunday Times of 26 June 1938 (which has a photograph of Murnane and coverage of the major $5.5 million water supply project): \\"Singapore uses less water per head than any other city in the East. This is not because whisky soda is preferred to whisky ayer (i.e. water), but because the city is fully metered and the people have been trained not to waste water\\". Consumption was half that of Penang, Bombay and Calcutta and two-thirds that of Shanghai at the time. The water department was committed to data collection and benchmarking itself against other cities, even in the 1930s. The eve of Chinese New Year had the highest daily water consumption in the year (on account of house cleaning and washing activity) while the first day of Chinese New Year had the lowest consumption.

He resigned his commission in 1938.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/maltribune19381001-1.2.131?ST=1&AT;=search&k;=Murnane&QT;=murnane&oref;=article He was active for many years in the management of The Singapore Municipal Employees Co-operative Thrift and Loan Society Limited. 1932 was not an easy time in Singapore which suffered the effects of the global trade depression. Murnane was active in making an appeal for relief funds in his capacity as President of the Society; he raised $300 monthly through a 20c monthly voluntary contribution from municipal employees to assist indebted members \\"make the slate clean\\" and to alleviate \\"sufferings and even starvation\\". Murnane was active in the St Patricks' Society of Singapore during the 1920s and 1930s and was President of the Society in 1937. He was also a member of the general committee at the Island Club. Murnane was married to Stephanie. They had two daughters, Moira (Moya) and Sheila, and two sons Conn and Niall.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/morningtribune19400129-1.2.52?ST=1&AT;=search&k;=mr%20and%20mrs%20d.j.%20murnane&QT;=mr,and,mrs,dj,murnane&oref;=articlehttp://notices.irishtimes.com/death/murnane/2385893?s_source=itir_titi In 1939, Sheila was described in glowing terms at a society garden party http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/sundaytribune19390730-1.2.62?ST=1&AT;=search&k;=moira%20murnane&QT;=moira,murnane&oref;=article and there is a newspaper photograph of both sisters as providers of entertainment in aid of a Children's Aid Society benefit at Raffles.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19390427-1.2.124.3?ST=1&AT;=search&k;=moira%20murnane&QT;=moira,murnane&oref;=article While their father was interned by the Japanese in Singapore, Conn was in boarding school in Ireland (Clongowes) and Niall in England (Ampleforth College). Earlier, both the boys and their sisters had attended a Catholic convent boarding school in Boscombe in England from where the two girls went on to school at Mount Anville Secondary School in Dublin. It appears Stephanie spent the war years in Australia. Surrender of Singapore by General Percival in 1942 In an effort to slow the Japanese forces' advance into Singapore, Murnane's old regiment, the Royal Engineers, was responsible for destroying the Johor-Singapore Causeway on 31 January 1942. Ironically, when they destroyed the causeway, the Royal Engineers also cut the water pipes that carried water from Gunong Pulai to Singapore, the same pipes installed by Murnane's Water Department in 1927 and 1939. Murnane had an important role leading up to the surrender to the Japanese on 15 February 1942, described by Churchill as the worst disaster and the greatest capitulation in British military history. The Municipal Water Engineer advised Arthur Percival on the state of the water supply on 14 February 1942, following extensive Japanese shelling in the city during the Battle of Singapore. Although Japanese forces were by then in control of Bukit Timah hill, as well as MacRitichie and Peirce reservoirs, they did not shut off the water supply to the city, a widespread misconception. According to oral history records, quoted by Louis Allen (author of Singapore 1941–42), Murnane asked for and was promised by General Percival \\"ten lorries and a hundred Royal Engineers\\" so he could fix the water supply leaks caused by Japanese bombing and shelling. He never got what he needed: Louis Allen says Murnane got 'one lorry and ten frightened Sikhs'. When confronted again, all that Percival delivered (on 14 February) was one lorry and ten Royal Engineers but it was too late. It would appear that Percival had given up already and he formally surrendered to the Japanese on 15 February 1942. The involvement of David Murnane in the critical final hours before surrender is confirmed by General Percival in his published Despatches, no 567, dated 14 February 1942. In the post-war Percival Report (written in 1946, published in 1948) the \\"imminent collapse\\" of the water supply, estimated by Murnane on 14 February to occur within 24–48 hours, was highlighted as a direct cause for surrender. On the day of surrender The Sunday Times was reduced to one page; it included the plaintive headline \\"Fill your baths\\" and a plea to \\"conserve water very carefully and to use every receptacle possible – bottles, baths etc\\". Murnane remained at his post and was interned in Singapore during the war (Changi Prison camp). After the war, and recuperation in England, he returned to work whereupon he picked up projects begun before the war, including the expansion of the Gunong Pulai water supply project and the new Johor river water supply project. The reservoir on Jalan Kampong Chantek / Rifle Range Road Three Reservoirs in Singapore are named after influential Municipal Engineers: James MacRitchie, Robert Peirce and David J. Murnane. The Murnane Service Reservoir, named after him, is a service reservoir located near the Bukit Timah Expressway and the Pan Island Expressway in Singapore. Built at a cost of $5.5 million, the reservoir supplements and provides backup water supply for the western regions of Singapore. The first section, with storage capacity of 16 million gallons, was opened in 1956 by the Singapore Governor Sir Robert Black. At the time, it was 'believed to be the largest covered service reservoir in the world', with eventual capacity of 56 million gallons of water. There is a detailed engineering description of the reservoir and Singapore's water supply needs in the New Zealand Engineering journal in 1958Murnane reservoir: Singapore Author: Wheeler, CM Source: New Zealand Engineering, Vol. 13, No. 9, Sept 1958: 329–333 and we can surmise that the project design started when Murnane was the Water Engineer: \\"Murnane Reservoir, now completed and in service, holds 57 million gallons of water, which is equal at present to one day's supply for Singapore, and is intended to be a reserve to balance the periods of low and high demands and also to provide a supply on the Island during a temporary interference with the flow of water from South Johore in the Federation of Malaya, whence most of the Island's water comes. The Reservoir is named after D. J. Murnane who was Water Engineer of Singapore from 1925 to 1947. The work was planned immediately after the War as part of an overall expansion of the water supply system, designed to increase the safe available capacity of the system from 30 million to 100 million gallons per day. Active work on the overall scheme was commenced in 1949 at which point the demand was 30 million gallons per day.\\" A World Health Organisation water sanitation seminar held in Singapore in December 1957 made a field visit to the reservoir (see page 50). \\"This is believed to be the biggest covered service reservoir in the world. The reservoir when full carries a 20 ft. depth of water over an area of 13 acres. It is in two sections containing respectively 16 and 40 million gallons, the total being equal to one day's supply to the whole of Singapore. The roof of the reservoir is formed of reinforced concrete arches of 40 ft. 9 in. span and only 3 in. thick, supported on concrete columns. At the time of the visit both sections were empty for cleaning and it was therefore possible for the party to enter the resevolr and appreciate its magnitude.\\" Death Murnane died in 1953 in Newlands, Cape Town, South Africa. Shortly afterwards, it was agreed that the new reservoir on Jalan Kampong Chantek in Singapore would be named in his honour. His newspaper death notice indicates he was a recipient of the Military Cross.Death notice for UK newspapers from the Andrew's Newspaper Index on Ancestry His wife Stephanie died in Cape Town in 1968. Murnane Pipeline Project As a footnote, the Murnane Pipeline Project is under construction and likely to be finished in 2019, nearly a century after Murnane first came to Singapore.

History The B-Girls formed in 1977 with an all-girl line-up with Lucasta Ross (A.K.A. Rochas) on vocals, Renee Chetsky (guitar), Xenia Holiday (guitar), Cynthia Ross (bass) and Rhonda Ross on drums. who would later be replaced by Marcy Saddy who had briefly played with the Demics. The band had a sound that was closer to that of a 1960s Mersey Beat band than the usual loud and fast punk sound of the era which was also shown in their fashions which included go-go boots, tight leggings and matching sweaters. The band gigged heavily locally with bands like Teenage Head, The Viletones and The Poles as well as opening for The Clash and The Undertones at an infamous O'Keefe Centre gig where a riot broke out. After getting much press attention they relocated to New York where they would play with Blondie, The B52's, The Romantics, Levi and The Rockats, Nikki and The Korvettes, Richard Hell, Lee Dorsey, The Cramps, Joey Ramone, Joan Jett, Johnny Thunders, The Dead Boys and even Allen Ginsberg. Cynthia Ross would become engaged for a time to Dead Boys singer Stiv Bators. In 1979 Greg Shaw, owner of Bomp! Records signed them and recordings were made produced by Bob Segarini resulting in a single \\"Fun At The Beach\\" b/w \\"B-Side\\" which was also released in Europe. They also sang backup vocals on Blondie's Autoamerican and Stiv Bator's solo album. A video was shot for \\"High School Dance\\" (A.K.A. \\"Boys Are Drinking\\"). Further demos were produced by Debbie Harry and Mick Jones but possible record or production deals with Bomp!, I.R.S. Records and Phil Spector fell through. I.R.S. would instead sign the similar sounding Go- Go's who were also fans of the B-Girls. Line up changes would lead to Lucasta leaving after the single and being replaced by Xenia moving to vocals, Rhonda having already left and been replaced by Marcy Saddy who had previously played in the London, Ontario band Demics. The reformed band carried on until 1981 before breaking up and returning to Toronto. Lucasta formed a new band called Minutes From Downtown who had a hit with \\"Wrapped In Velvet\\" breaking up a few years later. Marcy Saddy returned to London drumming in various bands and becoming an artist. The rest of the band dropped out of music although Cynthia Ross has since returned with a new band, New York Junk. The band's collected recordings were released in 1997, remixed by Chris Spedding, in a CD entitled Who Says Girls Can't Rock. The members of the band also appear in the documentary The Last Pogo Jumps Again. References *Worth, Liz. Treat Me Like Dirt Bongo Beat, 2010 *Sutherland, Sam.

History The Dishes were formed in 1975 with a lineup of Tony Malone (keyboards), Scott Davey (guitar), Murray Ball (vocals), Steven Davey (drums), Ken Farr (bass) and Michael LaCroix (saxophone); later joined by Glenn Schellenberg (keyboards) who replaced Tony in early 1977. Their sound was heavily influenced by art-rock bands and artists such as Roxy Music, David Bowie and Sparks, with a fondness for Bonzo-style comedy and the use of props during their live shows. They were one of the earliest bands of the new wave era in Toronto along with Rough Trade and both bands were notable in having openly gay members. Both bands played gigs at the Ontario College of Art (OCA) and The Dishes went on to play regular gigs at the Beverly Tavern. The Dishes presaged the Toronto punk scene by 2 years. They broke up just as the new scene was about to explode. Among their friends and admirers were future members of The Viletones, the B-Girls, and Martha and the Muffins; The Diodes played their 2nd gig opening for The Dishes at the OCA. Their musical style had little in common with the loud and fast three chord punk of much of the era having more in common with art-punk bands of the era such as the Talking Heads and early (John Foxx era) Ultravox, and the band would continue to do art gallery gigs including shows with the art collective General Idea and at fashion shows. The band recorded an EP Fashion Plates in 1977, becoming the first Toronto band to record and release a self-created 45. In 1978 they released a second 45 \\"Hot Property\\". In 1977, The Dishes also filmed a televised concert for TV Ontario becoming the second Canadian new wave band to appear on television after FM had previously done a TV Ontario show in 1976. Though thought of as an art-school band, none of the members had ever attended an art school. But their residency at The Beverley Tavern, a few blocks from OCA, meant a lot of art students would be checking them out. Their arty use of visual and graphic arts in aggressive street postering brought them a lot of attention. Later, collaborations with art collective General Idea (who designed their two record covers) and starting a fanzine as well as engaging in other photo-arts situations, established them as artists rather than just a band. The band broke up in 1978 although they did reunite for a show at the Winnipeg Art Gallery in 1984. When Tony Malone left in '77 he started Drastic Measures, a band that would achieve greater heights than The Dishes and even land a record deal with CBS. After The Dishes disbanded, Steven Davey switched to vocals/guitar and started his own band, The Everglades. Both Drastic Measures & The Everglades contributed tracks to \\"The Last Pogo\\" LP although they do not appear in the film. Steven would later go on to become a journalist for the Toronto Star, MacLean's Magazine, Xtra and Now. He died suddenly and unexpectedly in 2014 of a heart attack. Tony kept playing. Scott Davey joined a new band The Sharks with Sherry Kean and played with Rough Trade and then retired from music. Ken Farr joined Drastic Measures for awhile, then went on to work for the Canadian government in its Silviculture dept. Murray Ball became a successful restaurant and club owner. Michael LaCroix became a professional sound recorder on big budget film sets. Members of the band appear in the documentary \\"The Last Pogo Jumps Again\\".

It is owned by Robert L. Go, the President of the Philippine Retailers Association.  History  Prince Warehouse Club Incorporated started in April 1990 with Robert L. Go as its chairman. Their first branch is at North Reclamation Area (today's Prince Wholesale Center NRA) when they converted a plain warehouse into a store with a single cash register. Initially they sold glassware, kitchenware, plastic ware and other household items. It expanded in 1993 with their second branch in A.C. Cortes, Mandaue City as Prince Hypermart Mandaue. Currently, Prince Hypermart Mandaue is managed by Prince Mandaue Chain of Stores (Prince Warehouse Club Mandaue Inc.) and separated from the Prince Warehouse Club Inc. Robert's brother is Prince Mandaue's managing supervisor. Prince later initiated programs to help the sari-sari store owners with their Prince Warehouse Club's Sari-Sari Store Society (SSS). The program became a tool for Prince to help sari-sari store owners to grow their business and can buy goods at Prince Hypermart with discounts and perks. Their operations in Cebu soon expanded to nearby towns and provinces within Visayas Region. Like their giant rival Gaisano, they expanded outside Cebu when they knew that Cebu is becoming \\"saturated\\" with a lot of their stores in the province. In 2013, Prince expanded their operations in Mindanao with its first branch in Oroquieta City, Misamis Occidental. Their operations in Mindanao soon expanded in Zamboanga del Norte, Agusan del Sur, Agusan del Norte, Surigao del Sur, Surigao del Norte and Misamis Occidental. At that same year, they had 24 stores with 500,000 customers served every day. They also introduce ECPay, an electronic payment to their branches nationwide. The company continued to expand in more provinces, even reaching Luzon. In addition to the expansion, Kapatagan, Lanao del Norte branch was opened on October 7, 2018 located at the heart of the municipality. Their expansion over Visayas and Mindanao as of 2019 took PhP 1B+ investment. They closed the year with a total of 58 branches nationwide.

Alan Constable (born 1956) is an Australian artist well known for his ceramic sculptural depictions of photographic cameras. Constable has worked principally from his Northcote-based studio at Arts Project Australia since 1991, gaining critical success as a multi-disciplinary artist proficient in a wide diversity of media including pastel, gouache, paint and ceramics. He has been working on his series of ceramic cameras since 2007 and works from this series were represented at the 2009 Australian Ceramic Triennale in Sydney and featured in a solo exhibition of his work, Clay Cameras, at the Centre for Contemporary Photography in Melbourne. Thirteen works from this series were acquired for the collection of the National Gallery of Victoria in 2014, and appeared in their blockbuster exhibition of contemporary art, Melbourne Now, in the same year.  Early life and education  Constable was born in Melbourne. His “fascination with light and love of cameras” began at the age of eight, when he would construct intricate replicas of cameras, made from cereal cartons and glue. As artist Peter Atkins states, this early “interest in cameras – objects that are totally reliant on vision to find, frame and capture an image – is not without irony,” due to the fact that Constable is both legally blind and deaf. He participated in his first group exhibition in 1987 at St Martin’s Theatre Gallery in South Yarra, Melbourne and shortly thereafter he began regularly working at Arts Project Australia (APA), an organisation devoted to supporting and promoting artists with an intellectual disability. Although Constable received no formal training, his participation in the studio program at APA gave him access to fine art materials and the informal tuition provided by the practicing artists employed by the organisation. Following the commencement of his work at APA he began exhibiting regularly in Australia and participated in his first international group exhibitions in 1995, in the USA and Belgium.  Career, themes and style  Both Constable’s lack of formal training and disability has identified him as one of the key figures within the Outsider Art category in Australia. This categorisation is confirmed by his repeated inclusion in Outsider Art exhibitions and fairs, both in Australia and in the USA [see Exhibitions]. However, in recent years his work has also achieved critical success in the wider sphere of the Australian contemporary art institution and his first solo exhibition occurred at Helen Gory Galerie, a commercial art gallery located in Melbourne, in 2009. This exhibition was quickly followed by his inclusion in the Melbourne Now exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in 2014, a solo exhibition in Los Angeles curated by the artist Ricky Swallow in 2013 and his inclusion an exhibition curated by the Museum of Everything at the Kunsthal, Rotterdam, in 2016. A multi-disciplinary artist, Constable’s drawings and paintings are typically depictions of landscapes, solitary figures and animals, which are sourced from expired books and magazines, such as National Geographic. His style for both his two dimensional and ceramic works has been attributed to the way in which he utilises his extremely limited sight to focus on a singular aspect of a scene or subject. This stylistic focus, the selection of his subject matter and the tactile nature of his works (which often feature the imprint of the artist’s fingers on the clay surface) imply a close personal relationship between the artist and the works; as David Hurlston, Curator of Australian Art at the NGV, notes, the ceramic cameras “become a very personal and touching tribute. [They] contain traces of humanity.” His work has been compared that of Claes Oldenburg, in that both artists transform utilitarian objects by “altering scale and exploiting differences in materials” and former NGV curator Alex Baker has compared his work to that of Philip Guston, stating that “if Philip Guston was a ceramicist, these are the kind of objects he would make.”  Solo exhibitions  Alan Constable: Close –Up, Andrew Baker Art Dealer, Brisbane, 2015 Alan Constable, Darren Knight Gallery, Sydney, 2015 Alan Constable/Ten Cameras, Curated by Ricky Swallow, South Willard, Los Angeles, 2013 Viewfinder: Alan Constable Survey, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2011 Constable, Stills Gallery, Paddington, Sydney, New South Wales, 2011 Alan Constable Clay Cameras, Helen Gory Galerie, Melbourne, 2009  Selected group exhibitions  Gold Coast International Ceramic Art Award, Gold Coast City Gallery, Gold Coast, 2016 Clay: it’s a matter of substance, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2016 Museum of Everything, Kunsthal Rotterdam, 2016 Tell ‘em I’m dead, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2016 It takes more than 140 characters to write a novel, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2015 Victorian Craft Award, Craft, Melbourne, 2015 Polaroid Project, Horsham Regional Art Gallery, Horsham, 2014 Deakin University Contemporary Small Sculpture Award, Deakin University Art Gallery, Melbourne, 2014 Melbourne Art Fair 2014, Royal Exhibition Building, Melbourne (1994 – 2014) Renegades: Outsider Art, Moree Plains Gallery, NSW, 2014 Into the Vault and Out of the Box, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2014 Renegades: Outsider Art, The Arts Centre Gold Coast, Queensland, 2014 Melbourne Now, National Gallery of Victoria, 2014 Chicago Expo: Fleisher/Ollman Gallery, Chicago, USA, 2013 Nocturne, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2013 Manningham Victorian Ceramic Art Award, Manningham Art Gallery, 2013 Outsiderism, Fleisher/Ollman Gallery, Philadelphia, 2013 Error and Judgement, Arts Project Australia Gallery Melbourne, 2012 Exhibition #4, Museum of Everything, London, 2011 The Shilo Project, national exhibition, 2009 - 2011 This Sensual World, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2011 National Gallery of Victoria 150th event, Melbourne, 2011 Human Nature, Alan Lane Community Gallery: Warnambool Art Gallery, 2011 Hobart Art Prize, Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart, 2010 Pacifica, Gallery Impaire, Paris, France, 2010 Snapshot, ACGA Gallery, Federation Square, Melbourne, 2009 Off the Edge: Ceramics Triennale, Chrissie Cotter Gallery, Sydney, 2009 BloodLines: Art and the Horse, QUT Art Museum, Brisbane, 2009 Alan Constable & Julian Martin, Australian Galleries, Melbourne, 2009 Clay Cameras, Centre for Contemporary Photography, (CCP) Melbourne, 2009 17th Annual Outsider Art Fair, The Mart, New York, 2009 Short Stories, Tall Tales and the Way They Wore Them, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2008 Pearls of Arts Project Australia: The Stuart Purves Collection, Ivan Dougherty Gallery, College of Fine Arts, UNSW Sydney, 2008 The Dinner Party, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2007 Private and Confidential, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2007 Double Take, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2005 A Sense of Place, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 2003 Face Up, Idiom Studio, New Zealand, 2002 Arterial - artists from Arts Project Australia, Paralympic Arts Festival, Sydney Opera House, 2000 2000 National Works on Paper, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery, 2000 Works on Paper, Australian Galleries, Sydney, 1999 Connexions Particulières, MADMusée and Musée d’Art Moderne et d’Art Comtemporain, Liège, Belgium, 1999 Nine Artists from Arts Project Australia, Australian Galleries, Melbourne, 1999 The Inner View, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1999 Prints & Artists’ Books, Arts Project Australia, Melbourne, 1997 Border Crossing, McClelland Regional Gallery, Langwarrin, 1996 Wild Things, Arts Project Australia, Melbourne, 1996 Reversed Image, Arts Project Australia Gallery, Melbourne, 1995 MADMusée, Liège, Belgium, 1995 Vita Gallery, Portland, Oregon, USA, 1995 Beyond Words, National Gallery of Victoria, 1994 International Works on Paper Fair, Powerhouse Museum, Sydney, 1993 Gone to PAC, National Gallery of Victoria, 1993 Inside Out/Outside In, National Gallery of Victoria, 1992 Arts Project, 200 Gertrude Street, Melbourne, 1991  Publications  Alan Constable: Viewfinder, exhibition catalogue, Arts Project Australia, Melbourne, 2015.

Ovčarević was the main commander of the Hungarian river flotilla during the siege, which ended in Ottoman victory. Petar Ovčarević (; 1521–41) was an Ottoman and then Hungarian river flotilla commander, who during his Ottoman service spied and informed the Christian army on the intentions and movements of the Ottoman army. His last years were spent in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom, as one of the most notable magnates. Petar Ovčarević hailed from Belgrade, and was a hajduk. As a youngster he was captured by the Ottomans, but managed to have himself freed and join the Ottoman army. He for long served the Ottomans, then joined Hungarian service. He was a commander of the Šajkaši (Danube river flotilla) in Zemun, and during the Siege of Belgrade (1521) was the main commander of the Šajkaši in Belgrade. After surviving the siege, which ended in Ottoman takeover, and vacillating for a time, he joined the Ottomans and became a confidant of Ottoman general and sanjak-bey of Belgrade, Bali Bey Jahjapašić. He became a Martolos commander, commanding Serbs, based by the Belgrade rivers, inhabiting their own quarter and commanding a galley fleet. His unit was entrusted with the protection of Ottoman ferries on the Sava and Danube. Through Pavle Bakić, Ovčarević came into contact with Hungarian commander Pál Tomori, and helped the safe transfer of Bakić and his followers into Hungarian territory. He was a friend of Bakić, who seems to have assisted his secret crossing into Hungary a few months prior to the Battle of Mohács (29 August 1526). It seems that his aid to Bakić led to loss of confidence, according to D. Popović, as the Serb crew was replaced by an Ottoman one. All this time he was in confidential service to both King Ferdinand I and John Zápolya (rival kings of Hungary) and also representatives of other states, informing them of affairs in the Ottoman Empire. After Bali Bey's death, he rose further in rank and became the second-in-command and adviser of Bali Bey's younger brother and successor Mehmed Bey Jahjapašić, evidence of the very high trust he enjoyed. He greatly helped the Christian side in the war with the Ottomans by spying and sending secret reports to Hungarian commanders on the intentions and movements of the Ottoman army. Ovčarević was explicitly mentioned during the defense of the Buda fortress when Ferdinand I attacked at the end of 1530. He led 800 Serb and Turkish soldiers who arrived at Buda via the Danube. In 1531 Ferdinand's main confidant in Belgrade, the Ragusan Bocignolo, reported that Petar Ovčarević \\"participates in all consultation in the Belgrade Sanjak, especially those relating to the war, and that he for the second day informs him\\". Ovčarević informed Ferdinand through Bakić, whom he personally met, about affairs in the Ottoman Empire and Zapolya's country. In 1531 he and Stepko Vratković were in the company of Lasky, Zapolya's envoy, during negotiations with Rogendorf. It is unknown when he crossed into Zapolya's country. He received nobility status, and was mentioned in 1540 as the owner of Solymos and one of the most notable magnates in Zapolya's lands. After the death of Zapolya, he was the tutor (or guardian) of minor king John Sigismund, alongside Queen Isabelle and monk Đorđe Utešinović, and likely the commander of the Šajkaši. In 1541 he influenced Queen Isabelle into leaving Buda. His family, the Ovčarević, was one of the notable Serb noble families in Hungarian service in the 16th century. His kinsmen or descendants were Mihailo Ovčarević (fl. 1550–79), a Šajkaši commander, Dimitrije Ovčarević (fl. 1552–66), captain of Gyula, and Jovan Ovčarević (fl. 1557), an emissary., References Sources   16th-century Serbian people Serbian military leaders 16th-century Hungarian people 16th-century spies Hungarian spies Medieval spies Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Habsburg Serbs People from Belgrade 16th-century people of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Petar Ovčarević"},{"id":"52407553","text":"Muḥammad Abū Numayy II ibn Barakāt ibn Muḥammad ( ) was Sharif of Mecca from 1512 to 1566.

His mother was Sharifah Ghabyah, the daughter of Humaydan ibn Shaman al-Husayni, Emir of Medina. At the age of six he was appointed co-ruler with his father by the Sharif's Mamluk suzerain, Sultan Qansuh al-Ghawri of Egypt. In 1517 after the Ottoman conquest of Egypt, Barakat quickly recognized the change in sovereignty. He sent Abu Numayy to Sultan Selim I in Cairo, bearing the keys to the holy cities and other gifts, and the Sultan confirmed Barakat and Abu Numayy in their positions as co-rulers of the Hejaz. Following his father's death in 1525 Abu Numayy assumed sole rulership of the Hejaz. Later in 947 AH (1540) he secured from Sultan Suleiman I the appointment of his eldest son Ahmad as his co-ruler, and then the appointment of his next eldest son, Hasan, after Ahmad's death in 961 AH (1554). In 974 AH (1566/1567) Abu Numayy received permission to abdicate in favor of Sharif Hasan. After retiring from the Sharifate he devoted his time to worship and religious studies while continuing to assist his son in an advisory capacity. He died on 9 Muharram 992 AH () at Wadi al-Abar, south of Mecca. He was prayed over in Masjid al- Haram and buried in Jannat al-Mu'alla, where a tomb was constructed over his grave.

It consists of what was originally two individual but almost identical warehouses from circa 1800 which were merged into one building in the 1860s and has now been converted into apartments. The name, which is of modern origins, refers to Snorrebroen, the bridge that carries nearby Sankt Annæ Gade across the canal. History The warehouse to the right (No. 47) is slightly older than the warehouse to the left (No. 45). It was built in 1799-1800 for Hartvig Marcus Frisch who was director of the Royal Greenland Trade Department. The Frisch House, Frisch's former home at Nytorv, was built around the same time. The warehouse at No. 45 was built in 1800-01 for the merchant Jens Bay Perch. He traded in colonial goods from the nearby Danish Asiatic Company but died on 3 July 1800 before the warehouse was completed. He is buried inside Church of Our Saviour where his gravestone is one of only five stones that was not removed in 1817. Perch was a close friend of Niels Brock. His son, who was given the name Niels Brock Perch after the friend, would later found the Perch Tea House. In 1863, the two warehouse came under the same owner. An interior renovation merged them into one building. The building was listed in 1945. The building was converted into apartments by Dissing + Weitling between 1979 and 1987. The renovation received an award from Copenhagen Municipality in 1994. Architecture The building wivewed from the tower of Church of Our Saviour The exterior has undergone few changes and its origin as two individual warehouses is still clearly visible. The building stands on a foundation of sandstone from Bornholm and consists of three storeys and a Mansard roof with two two-storey wall dormers. Each half of the building has a central row of large, arched opening with shutters, flanked by two rows of arched windows. Remains of the hoist is still seen on the dormers.

The victims were Edward Nickols (aged 50), Roy Wilson (aged 35), and Dewey Morris (aged 25), all of whom were working as fur trappers in the Deschutes National Forest in late 1923–1924. Their bodies were discovered in Little Lava Lake in April 1924, where they had been deposited under the surface ice. Each of the men had been murdered via gunshot and blunt force trauma. Though police identified a potential suspect, Charles Kimzey, a conviction never reached fruition. The crime is one of the oldest unsolved murder cases in Oregon history, and was the subject of a 2013 investigative book titled The Trapper Murders by Melany Tupper. Background Edward Nickols, Roy Wilson, and Dewey Morris, residents of Bend, had made plans to spend the winter of 1923–1924 in a log cabin owned by a local logging contractor, Edward Logan, to work as fur trappers in the wilderness. Transcript here. The men moved into the cabin in the fall of 1923. The week before Christmas, Nickols visited Bend, reportedly in a \\"jovial\\" mood, and sold a sled full of expensive furs. He told locals that the fur trapping had been going well. After Christmas, Allen Wilcoxen, a resort owner, was traveling by snowshoe from his home in Fall River to his resort at Elk Lake; en route, he stopped at Logan's cabin to visit the three men. Wilcoxen arrived on January 15, 1924, and spent the evening there; according to Wilcoxen, Nickols, Wilson and Morris were in good spirits and had been successful in their trapping. On the morning of January 16, he departed the cabin for Elk Lake. This was the last known sighting of the three men before their deaths. Discovery Having had no correspondence with any of the three men since December 1923, and having noticed that mink traps set in the area had been left unmaintained, Innis Owen Morris, a brother of Dewey Morris, and Pearl Lynnes, superintendent of the Tumalo Fish Hatchery, became suspicious. In April 1924, a search team traveled to the cabin, but found no sign of the men. Inside the cabin, burnt food was in pots on the stove, and the dining table had been set for a meal. Outside, the sled used for the transport of goods and equipment was missing, and a fox pen behind the cabin that contained five valuable foxes owned by Logan was empty. Upon searching inside, a blood- stained claw hammer was found in the corner of the pen. The search team checked on the men's trapping lines, and discovered the frozen remains of twelve marten, four foxes, and one skunk, suggesting that their traps in the surrounding forest had been unattended to. The following day, Deschutes County Sheriff Clarence A. Adams arrived at the cabin to begin an investigation. Near the shore of Big Lava Lake, the searchers found the men's large sled, which was marked with dark stains that were later confirmed to be blood. On the edge of the lake, a depression in the ice was detected where a hole had visibly been cut, and frozen over. Nearby, on a trail leading to the lake, a searcher discovered pools of blood in the thawing snow, as well as clumps of hair and a human tooth. The coating of ice on the lake having thawed enough that the searchers could explore by boat, Innis Morris and Adams discovered the bodies of all three men, which had floated to the surface of the lake. Investigation Autopsies revealed the men had all died of gunshot wounds, as well as blunt force trauma, likely from a hammer. Wilson had been shot in the right shoulder and the back of the head, while Nickols' jawbone had been shattered by a shotgun blast; he also had a bullet hole, likely from a revolver, in his head. Dewey Morris had been shot in the left forearm, and also had a skull fracture, presumably from a hammer. It was estimated that the murders occurred in late December 1923 or early January 1924. In an official police report, Sheriff Claude McCauley wrote of the scene: According to a published report in April 1924, police believed at least two of the men had not been murdered in close vicinity to the cabin, but had been lured away from it. Initially, police suspected a woodsman and moonshiner named Indian Erickson of the crimes, who maintained a camp at the nearby Cultus Lake. Erickson was dismissed by police, however, after supplying an alibi. =Charles Kimzey= Logan provided police with a potential suspect shortly after the men's bodies were discovered—a fellow trapper named Lee Collins, who had at one time quarreled with the men over a purportedly stolen wallet. Collins had reportedly threatened to come back and kill Nickols. He was discovered in actuality to be a man named Charles Kimzey, who had been arrested in 1923 for robbery and attempted murder in Bend, in which he threw W. O. Harrison, a stagecoach driver, down a well. Harrison survived, but Kimzey fled before the case went to trial. A traffic officer in Portland, Oregon recognized Kimzey as a man who had approached him on January 24, 1924, carrying a gunnysack and asking for directions to a fur dealer in the city. The officer directed him to Schumacher Fur Company on Third Street in Northwest Portland, where the man sold the sack of furs for $110. Police issued a reward of $1,500 for Kimzey's arrest and conviction in connection with the murders, but the case went cold. On February 17, 1933, nine years after the murders, Kimzey was spotted in Kalispell, Montana, and was apprehended by police and returned to Oregon for questioning in the murders. Though police had a circumstantial case against Kimzey, the fur dealer who had purchased the furs in January 1924 could not positively identify the man as Kimzey. Kimzey was charged, however, in the 1923 attempted murder of Harrison, and sentenced to life imprisonment in the Oregon State Penitentiary. In spite of the circumstantial evidence suggesting Kimzey's involvement in the murders, the case remains officially unsolved. In culture A book about the murders, entitled The Trapper Murders, was published by Melany Tupper in 2013. In the book, Tupper suggests that the murders were committed by both Kimzey and an accomplice, Ray Jackson Van Buren, a man from Sweet Home, Oregon, who committed suicide in 1938.

The film is a sequel to Raju Gari Gadhi (2015). It is a remake of the Malayalam film Pretham (2016). Plot The film begins with three youngsters Ashwin (Ashwin Babu), Kishore (Vennela Kishore), and Praveen (Praveen), who are friends from college days, deciding to lead a life by investing in a resort business. As they start the business, everything goes smoothly until they begin to witness paranormal activities in the resort, making their lives tougher. Immediately, they contact a nearby Church Father (Naresh), but it fails miserably, and their fear of that ghost increases. The Father suggests them to approach a world- renowned mentalist named Rudra (Nagarjuna Akkineni) who has parlor tricks, mental tenacity to make clever guesses, special powers of contacting with the spirits, and also assists the Police Department as a human lie detector with his cold reading techniques. Rudra decides to solve out the mystery in the resort. Beyond a shadow of the doubt, he finds out that it is a soul of a girl Amrutha (Samantha Akkineni), who is seeking answers for her death. Rudra ensures Amrutha that he will definitely help her. So, she starts revealing her past. Amrutha was a bright and intelligent student who has grown up with values and norms given by her father Parandhamaiah (Rao Ramesh). Once, she goes out on a college excursion when someone secretly films her while bathing in the same resort which is purchased by three youngsters and uploaded it in the internet, which led to her father’s death. After that, Amrutha also committed suicide due to the pain caused by the society. Now, Rudra starts his investigation to catch the real culprit. At last, he cracks the mystery it is Kiran (Abhinaya), the daughter of Chandra Shekar (Devan), who is the Vice Chancellor of the Institution. The reason behind Kiran's deed is jealousy, about Amrutha's popularity and her love interest Nandu's (Nandu) fondness towards Amrutha. After knowing the truth, Amrutha tries to kill Kiran, but Rudra obstructs her way by remembering the morals taught by her father and make her soul rest in peace. Finally, the movie ends with the three youngsters running their resort successfully with a caution that cell phones are not allowed and Rudra moving towards a new mission.

He is best known today as the patriarch of the prominent Khouw family of Tamboen. He was born in Batavia in the late eighteenth century. His father, Khouw Tjoen, was a successful, Chinese-born merchant, who had migrated around 1769 from Fujian to Tegal on Java's north coast, thence to Batavia. Khouw Tian Sek succeeded his father in the family business upon the latter's death. He significantly reinvested the family fortune away from moneylending and pawnbroking to landownership, which was seen as more respectable. Among his acquisitions was a great deal of land along the Molenvliet canal, a semi-rural area immediately south of old Batavia, which became the city's most prestigious business district in the mid-nineteenth century. As Arnold Wright points out, '[t]his [area] subsequently increased so enormously in value that without further effort on...[Khouw's] part he was changed from a comparatively well-to-do into an exceedingly wealthy man.' Khouw and his family commissioned three extravagant compounds along the fashionable Molenvliet (now Jalan Gajah Mada and Jalan Hayam Wuruk), of which only one, Candra Naya, has survived today. Outside Batavia, Khouw became an important landheer through his acquisition of many particuliere landerijen or landed estates – including, in 1841, the family's largest and most important estate: Tamboen. Here, they would build their palatial country seat, landhuis Tamboen (now :id:Gedung Juang Tambun). Rice, indigo, sugar, coconut, rubber and peanut were all cultivated at Tamboen and the family's other landholdings. In old age, Khouw became the first member of his family to be elevated by the Dutch colonial government to the dignity of Luitenant der Chinezen. His lieutenancy, however, was honorary and entailed none of the usual political and legal jurisdiction over the local Chinese community. Khouw died in 1843. His family became one of the principal dynasties of the Cabang Atas or the Chinese gentry of colonial Indonesia. All three of his sons, Khouw Tjeng Tjoan, Khouw Tjeng Kee and Khouw Tjeng Po, were later also given honorary lieutenancies by the colonial authorities. In contrast, many of Khouw's grandsons would later serve as substantive Chinese officers as part of the colonial bureaucracy. Khouw Yauw Kie (son of Khouw Tjeng Po) became the first member of the family to be appointed to the higher rank of Kapitein der Chinezen with a seat on the Chinese Council of Batavia. Another grandson, Khouw Kim An (son of Khouw Tjeng Tjoan), was appointed to the highest rank in the Chinese administration, that of Majoor der Chinezen and ex officio chair of the Chinese Council of Batavia. Other prominent grandsons included the philanthropist O. G. Khouw (son of Khouw Tjeng Kee); the bureaucrat Khouw Kim Tjiang, Kapitein der Chinezen of Buitenzorg (son of Khouw Tjeng Tjoan, brother of Majoor Khouw Kim An); and the planter and landowner Khouw Oen Hoei, Kapitein der Chinezen (son of Khouw Tjeng Kee, brother of O. G. Khouw). To this day, an area in Asemka, Pinangsia, Jakarta is called Kebon Tengsek in his memory.

He served as director of the Bank of England, chairman for the Bank of London and South America and executive director of the International Monetary Fund. He twice served as High Sheriff of the County of London. Biography Bolton was born in Lower Clapton, Hackney, London in 1900, the son of William Bolton, a shipping clerk, and Beatrice (née French). He went to school at Leyton County High school in Waltham Forest. At age 16, he joined the London branch of the Société Générale de Paris to be trained as an exchange dealer. In 1920, he joined the merchant banking firm of Helbert, Wagg & Co., and learned the trade in London and Paris. At Helbert, Wegg, & Co., Bolton started and managed a successful foreign exchange dealing department. After the Bank of England had abandoned the gold standard in 1931, the bank sought out Bolton for his expertise in this industry. In 1933, Bolton joined the Bank of England, where he was largely responsible for the market management of sterling exchange rate, using the resources of the Exchange Equalisation Account created by Neville Chamberlain the previous year. During the late 1930s, Bolton was involved with classified preparations for a structure of wartime exchange control plans, which were implemented when the war broke out in 1939. From 1941 to 1948, Bolton served as an adviser to the Bank of England's Board of Governors on policies of development of the sterling area, in addition to the technical apparatus of foreign exchange control. In 1948, he was named Executive Director of the Bank of England. From 1946 to 1952, Bolton was the UK's executive director of the International Monetary Fund and Alternate Governor from 1952 to 1957. He also served as director of the Bank for International Settlements. In 1957, he became chairman of the Bank of London and South America (BOLSA), staying in that role until he retired in 1970. After his retirement, he remained a director of BOLSA, and subsequently of Lloyds Bank International, after their merger in 1974. Bolton also served in various other positions and sat on the boards of many companies, including the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and the Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada. He was deputy chairman of Bank of London and Montreal and chairman of the Commonwealth Development Finance Corporation. He was High Sheriff of the County of London in 1952–52 and 1961–62, and governor of the London School of Economics. After his retirement in 1970, a collection of his speeches and writings on London was published as a book, Banker's World: The Revival of the City 1957–1970, edited by Richard Fry, former financial editor of The Guardian, with a preface by Sir Frank Lee, Permanent Secretary of the Treasury. Honours Bolton was knighted as a Commander of the Order of Saint Michael and Saint George in the 1950 New Year Honours. In 1960, he was appointed a Gran Oficial of the Order of May by the Argentine government, and in 1965 was awarded the Order of Merit from Chile. Personal life In 1928, Bolton married May Howcroft. They had one son, Nicholas George, and two daughters, Sheila and Gillian. He died in London in 1981. Nicholas married the Hon. Lavinia Valerie Woodhouse, daughter of David Woodhouse, 4th Baron Terrington, and their daughter Carina married Alexander Burton Conyngham, Earl of Mount Charles, heir to the Marquessate of Conyngham.

(German language) Born in Livorno, Celeste was the daughter of a librettist, Marco Coltellini. In 1780, she made her debut at Teatro alla Scala in Milan, performing in three operas: Giovanni Valentini's Le nozze in contrasto, Giacomo Rust's Gli antiquari in Palmira and Giovanni Paisiello's La Frascatana, singing in mezzo-soprano register. She then sang at Teatro San Carlo in Naples, where she had the opportunity to meet Emperor Joseph II, who later invited her to perform in Vienna. When her voice changed to soprano, she accepted the Emperor's invitation. In 1785, she went to Vienna with her mother, and stayed there for a year. In Vienna, she made her debut singing Domenico Cimarosa’s Contadina di spirito. She returned to Vienna again in 1788, but stayed just for a few months. She was seen with Mozart several times at music performances and parties, however, there was no record or any official report mentioning about any affairs or collaboration works between them. Coltellini was famous for her excellent interpretation of the title role in Nina, o sia La pazza per amore by Giovanni Paisiello. Her sister Annetta, also a singer, often accompanied her in the production. In 1792, at the age of 32, Celeste retired from the opera stage and married the Swiss banker Jean- Georges Meuricoffre who owned a bank in Naples.Carola Bebermeier, Celeste Coltellini (1760-1828) - Lebensbilder einer Sängerin und Malerin, Böhlau Verlag, Köln/Wien/Weimar 2015, pg. 248.

Originally 96 F, she was a 250t-class torpedo boat, and saw active service during World War I, performing convoy, patrol, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. Following Austria-Hungary's defeat in 1918, 96 F was allocated to the Navy of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy, and was renamed T7. At the time, she and the seven other 250t-class boats were the only modern sea-going vessels of the fledgling maritime force. During the interwar period, T7 and the rest of the navy were involved in training exercises and cruises to friendly ports, but activity was limited by reduced naval budgets. The ship was captured by the Italians during the German-led Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941. After her main armament was modernised, she served with the Royal Italian Navy under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Following the Italian capitulation in September 1943, she was handed over by the Germans to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia. She was driven aground by British motor torpedo boats in June 1944 and destroyed by the British Army to prevent her salvage. Background In 1910, the Austria-Hungary Naval Technical Committee initiated the design and development of a coastal torpedo boat, specifying that it should be capable of sustaining for 10 hours. This specification was based upon an expectation that the Strait of Otranto, where the Adriatic Sea meets the Ionian Sea, would be blockaded by the hostile forces during a future conflict. Under such circumstances, there would be a need for a torpedo boat that could still sail from the Austro-Hungarian Navy () base at the Bocche di Cattaro (Bay of Kotor) to the Strait during the night, locate and attack blockading ships and return to port before morning. Steam turbine power was selected for propulsion, as diesels with the necessary power were not available, and the Austro-Hungarian Navy did not have the practical experience to run turbo-electric boats. Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was selected for the contract to build the first eight vessels, designated as the T-group. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them, designated as the F-group. The F-group's designation signified the location of Ganz & Danubius' main shipyard at Fiume. 96 F was the fifteenth boat of the F-group to be fully completed. Description and construction The 250t-class F-group boats had a waterline length of , a beam of , and a normal draught of . While their designed displacement was , they displaced about when fully loaded. The crew consisted of 38–41 officers and enlisted men. The boats were powered by two AEG-Curtiss steam turbines driving two propellers, using steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal. The turbines were rated at with a maximum output of , and were designed to propel the boats to a top speed of . They carried of coal and of fuel oil, which gave them a range of at . The F-group had two funnels rather than the single funnel of the T-group. Due to inadequate funding, 96 F and the rest of the 250t class were essentially coastal vessels, despite the original intention that they would be used for \\"high seas\\" operations. They were the first small Austro-Hungarian Navy boats to use turbines, and this contributed to ongoing problems with them. The boats were armed with two Škoda L/30 guns, and four torpedo tubes. They could also carry 10–12 naval mines. 96 F was the second-to-last of its group to be completed, and was laid down on 24 February 1915, launched on 7 July 1916 and completed on 23 November of that year. Career =World War I and the interwar period= During World War I, 96 F was used for convoy, patrol, escort and minesweeping tasks, and anti-submarine operations. In 1917, one of the guns on each boat of the class was placed on an anti-aircraft mount. On the night of 11 May 1917, the , accompanied by 96 F and two other 250t-class boats, were pursued in the northern Adriatic by an Italian force of five destroyers, but were able to retire to safety behind a minefield. On 3 June, the destroyers and Csikós, along with 96 F and another 250t-class boat, had a brief encounter with three Italian MAS boats off the mouth of the Tagliamento river in the far north of the Adriatic. 96 F survived the war intact. In 1920, under the terms of the previous year's Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye by which rump Austria officially ended World War I, she was allocated to the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (KSCS, later Yugoslavia). Along with three other 250t-class F-group boats, 87 F, 93 F and 97 F, and four 250t-class T-group boats, she was transferred in March 1921 to the Navy of the KSCS, which later became the Royal Yugoslav Navy (, KJRM). Renamed T7 in KJRM service, she and the other seven 250t-class boats were, at the outset, the only modern sea-going vessels in the KJRM. In 1925, exercises were conducted off the Dalmatian coast, involving the majority of the navy. In MayJune 1929, six of the eight 250t-class torpedo boats accompanied the light cruiser Dalmacija, the submarine tender Hvar and the submarines and , on a cruise to Malta, the Greek island of Corfu in the Ionian Sea, and Bizerte in the French protectorate of Tunisia. It is not clear if T7 was one of the torpedo boats involved. The ships and crews made a very good impression while visiting Malta. In 1932, the British naval attaché reported that Yugoslav ships engaged in few exercises, manoeuvres or gunnery training due to reduced budgets. =World War II= In April 1941, Yugoslavia entered World War II when it was invaded by the German-led Axis powers. At the time of the invasion, T7 was assigned as the flagship of the 3rd Torpedo Division located at Šibenik, which included her three F-group sisters. On 8 April, the four boats of the 3rd Torpedo Division, along with other vessels, were tasked to support an attack on the Italian enclave of Zara (Zadar) on the Dalmatia coast. They were subjected to three Italian air attacks and, after the last one, sailed from the area of Zaton into Lake Prokljan, where they remained until 11 April. On 12 April, the 3rd Torpedo Division arrived at Milna on the island of Brač, and refused to follow orders to sail to the Bay of Kotor. All four F-group boats, including T7, were captured by the Italians. T7 was then operated by the Italians under her Yugoslav designation, conducting coastal and second-line escort duties in the Adriatic. Her guns were replaced by two L/40 anti- aircraft guns, but no other significant alterations were made to her. The Italians capitulated in September 1943, and once under German control, T7 was handed over to the Navy of the Independent State of Croatia, serving under her Yugoslav designation. Her crew came under the influence of the Yugoslav Partisans, and were preparing to mutiny when the Germans intervened. On 24 June 1944, she and the German S-boats S 154 and S 157 of the 7th S-Boat Flotilla were sailing between Šibenik and Rijeka, protecting German sea supply routes along the Adriatic, when they were attacked by the Royal Navy Fairmile D motor torpedo boats MTB 659, MTB 662 and MTB 670 near the island of Kukuljari, south of Murter Island. Considering T7 one of the few significant threats to British vessels in the region, the British commander ordered MTB 670 to launch a torpedo attack. The two torpedoes missed, so the MTBs pursued and approached the ship from abaft the beam. T7 opened fire at . The MTBs returned fire with their forward and port guns, and within 30 seconds they had disabled T7's weapons and set her ablaze. At a speed of about , T7 suddenly veered starboard, narrowly avoiding a collision with MTB 662 (it is not known whether her steering was damaged or if her crew was attempting to perform a ram) before running aground on Murter Island. The MTBs rescued 21 crew. The British crews later examined the wreck, capturing five more sailors and leaving her flooded and burning. A British Army demolition team destroyed the hulk to ensure it could not be salvaged.

In South Korea, it is generally considered that people with tattoos are anti-social individuals who violate social norms, criminals, gangsters, or juvenile delinquents. Korean law allows professional doctors to open tattoo parlours and it is not illegal to have a tattoo. Only the army prohibits tattoos. You can sport a tattoo after you serve in the military.  History  The historical backdrop of tattoos in Korea began in Samhan. There is no record of inking in the northern region, as individuals who worked in the angling business by and large had tattoos on their body such as four leaf clovers keeping in mind the end goal to anticipate wounds. The significance of tattoos changed into discipline in the Goryeo period and proceeded into the Joseon Dynasty. The record can be found in the Gyeongguk Daejeon. Amid the Joseon period, individuals who stole dairy animals or steeds were rebuffed by engraving the name of the wrongdoing on their body. There was likewise a tattoo for recording love, however ladies who were being inked received discipline for disloyalty. Amid the 1970s, tattoos turned into a questionable issue due to skin maladies as a symptom of tattoo strategies and disgrace of tattoos. In 1990, the Ministry of Health and Welfare proposed that inking has a place with needle therapy, so they managed that the system of inking ought to be done just by restorative work force. However, it is not common for restorative work force to perform tattooing. According to the tattooist organization, around one million individuals in South Korea experienced being inked. The quantity of individuals who work in the tattoo business raise up to two million.  Changed consciousness regarding tattoos  The number of youth with tattoos and the number of inked individuals is expanding. As indicated by a study led by warriors in 1983, 72.6% of individuals responded that they have not seen an inked individual. In 2007, 67% of residents expressed that they have seen a tattoo. Before, inking was viewed as damaging social standards and figured just criminal do. In 2014, individuals feel that they end up noticeably liberal about tattoo contrasted with the past and they anticipate that the time of inked individuals would be different and the number of inked individuals would increment. As indicated by an overview led in Busan, 83.1% individuals connect tattoos to the infringement and hostile to social pictures when they consider the term called Munsin (Hangeul: 문신; Hanja: 紋身). Munsin is a Korean elocution of tattoo. They connect tattoos to chic and appealing pictures when they consider the word tattoo (Hangeul: 타투). As self-perception was the fate of expanded concern, the general population began to utilize the tattoo as a physical and social articulation. Tattoo individuals are getting a charge out of lasting tattoos and semi-perpetual tattoos as a type of engaging themselves. Individuals have turned out to be keen on tattoos of big names, vocalists, and games stars. For instance, Ahn Jung-hwan, a South Korean previous football player, uncovered his inked arm for his significant other in an objective service. This was very stunning to the general population. After this, numerous youngsters affected a change from a negative picture of inking to a positive one of a type of imaginative articulation.  Controversy of legalising tattoos  In Korea, there are no laws about inking, however tattooing is viewed as acupuncture and requires restorative affirmation. Tattooist foundation has asked for law amendment to Ministry of Health and Welfare. In December 2015, new vocations were advanced including occupations for tattooists. The legislature said that law update in regards to inking and checking lawful issue is essential. They arranged an exploration about the case in different nations, symptoms and legalisation of inking. Tattooists suggest the necessity of legalizing tattoo for changing an image of illegal, protecting tattooists by law and registration of entrepreneur. The awareness of tattoo is changing around the world; still, it is illegal in Korea. Tattooist iIda said “I can not hang up a sign for my shop because it is an illegal, making laws about the tattoo is necessary.” She said customers and tattooists can’t be protected by law. Tattooist Doy expressed his opinion that legalization should be processed for better recognition. He said, “tattooing is obviously not a medical procedure, but some past precedents worsen the prejudice.\\" He also suggested the law, which regards tattooing as a medical service, should be changed for solving misunderstanding of tattoo.  Semi- permanent tattoo  As the number of working women jumped dramatically, new cosmetic techniques appeared. Semi-permanent makeup provides women all around the world with convenience and efficiency. It also offers confidence and feelings of relaxation. In fact, many social commerce sites are providing various incentives such as offering coupons to increase its popularity. Semi permanent make up is a cosmetic technique that applies tattoo pigment onto the dermis for a certain amount of time. Compared to a permanent tattoo, it is a preferable cosmetic technique for many people because of safety and durability. According to Korean Agency, The reported incidences of side effects from semi-permanent tattooing—as written in CISS (Consumer Injury Surveillance System) number 77 cases in the last three years. The Ministry of Agriculture conducted tests on 25 tattoo inks to determine the amount of toxicity; 12 products were declared improper and dangerous because they possessed cadmium exceeding the accepted. Six products contained lead that is known to cause central nervous system lesions over 5.5 times the accepted. Zinc, copper, and nickel are components that may cause atopic dermatitis if people are exposed to those ingredients for a long time.

A searchable database of updated archival holdings listed in the book is available in the Archive Database on the Routes to Roots Foundation website.  Overview  In 1997, in official cooperation with the Polish State Archives (Naczelna Dyrekcja Archiwów Państwowych in Warsaw, Poland), Weiner authored and published the book, Jewish Roots in Poland. The book includes archival holdings of the Polish State Archives, the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw, local town hall documents throughout Poland, Holocaust documents found in the archives of the death camps located in Auschwitz near Krakow and Majdanek near Lublin. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs. There are individual town listings for localities with more than 10,000 Jews in 1939. Jewish Roots in Poland took over ten years to complete. The book includes an inventory of 1,250 towns and over 5,000 record entries for these towns. Sources of the material were the Polish State Archives (which included 75 archives throughout Poland), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (which included 434 offices throughout Poland), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. Holocaust documents came from Majdanek Museum Archives and Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum Archives. There are over 300 color photos and over 200 black and white photos of 127 towns, 52 document examples, and 14 color maps.  Reception  Jewish Roots in Poland was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Poland and the former Soviet Union that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. It is a combination of genealogical resources and Holocaust references as well as a coffee table book. Weiner's book can be categorized thusly: \\"It's a genealogy book; it's a Holocaust book; it's a coffee-table book; it's a scholarly reference book. It's also a travel book.\\" Warren Blatt from the JewishGen Kielce-Radom Special Interest Group (SIG) described the work as a tour de force and as a magum opus that is the most comprehensive work ever published on Polish-Jewish genealogy. He describes it as a work of great interest for genealogists, historians, travelers, or anyone interested in Polish-Jewish research. He further describes Weiner's book as a \\"lavishly illustrated volume\\" and states that \\"you'll want to display it as a coffee-table book, as well as mine the incredible depth of its comprehensive inventories and fantastic reference material for genealogical research.\\" In a detailed analysis, Blatt found that the book provided information not previously available to genealogists. He concludes with \\"I love this book. I have enjoyed many hours with this indispensable volume, using it every day. It is truly a unique and timely masterpiece. This magnificent book belongs in the library of every serious Jewish genealogist.\\" Marilyn Silverman of the Jewish Post of New York said Jewish Roots in Poland is the first Polish government-sanctioned book to document the holdings of the Polish State Archives that are of interest to Jewish genealogists. She sees the experience of discovering these documents as being both painful as well as inspiring a feeling of exhilaration, tied to survival.

Photo taken July 1990 In the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, DOROT, their review called Jewish Roots in Poland Weiner's magnum opus, noting the genealogical holdings as well as the capsule town descriptions of 28 towns with large Jewish populations pre-WWII. The New York Times highlighted the book's importance as an information resource as well as the feelings of poignancy and nostalgia captured in the many images throughout the work. The Forward described how Weiner was able to organize the original archival material – which lacked a town-by-town inventory and was uncatalogued and inaccessible for genealogical purposes – into a user-friendly format, with the data becoming accessible and organized.

Overview  In 1999, in official cooperation with the Ukraine State Archives (Ukraïnskyi derzhavnyi arkhiv) and the Moldova National Archives (Arhivă Naţională a Republicii Moldova), Weiner authored and published Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova. The book includes archival holdings of the Ukraine State Archives and its branch archives throughout the country and the Moldova National Archives in Chișinău as well as local town hall documents throughout Ukraine and Moldova. The book also features document examples, maps, antique postcards depicting towns and daily life, and modern-day photographs. There are individual town listings for localities throughout both countries. The book includes an inventory of 1,392 towns and over 5,000 record entries for these towns. Sources of the material were the Ukrainian State Archives, Moldova National Archives, Ministry of Justice (ZAGS) in Ukraine and Moldova, Polish State Archives (AGAD in Warsaw), Urzad Stanu Cywilnego (Warsaw-Srodmiescie), and the Jewish Historical Institute in Warsaw. There are over 1,200 images in the book, of which there are 970 color photos of 190 towns, 121 black and white photos, 115 document examples, and 20 color maps. The archives of Ukraine and Moldova were not accessible to the public for genealogical research purposes until the two countries gained independence in 1991. Once available, the ability to access even one birth record could take more than a week. Weiner made repeated visits to Ukraine and was aided by the former mayor of Otaci, Moldova, who served as a driver and translator. The book and the Routes to Roots Archive Database are the only known town-by-town inventories of archival documents (published in English) in that these lists were officially sanctioned by the directors of the both the State Archives and Ministry of Justice (includes local town hall archives) in Ukraine and Moldova. Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova took over seven years to complete. Weiner worked with two directors of the State Archives of Ukraine, Borys Ivanenko and Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, and collaborated with archivists throughout Ukraine to compile the information for the book. The Director of the Moldovan National Archives, Antonina A. Berzoy, contributed an article on the archives there, as did other regional scholars and experts.  Reception  Miriam Weiner in the Kiev Historical Archives in Ukraine points to boxes of historic documents dating back several hundred years, Aug 1991 Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova was the first work of its kind, as it collected details on archival documents from Ukraine and Moldova that had previously been deemed inaccessible or fundamentally lost. The book also serves multiple functions, so its diversity of offerings often made categorizing what the book was difficult. In the New York Jewish Genealogical Society, Inc.'s publication, DOROT, their detailed review focused on the extensive scope of the materials presented in the book: over 1,200 images of almost 200 towns, and the inclusion of over 5,000 documents of almost 1,400 towns. Jewish Standard noted the fact that Jewish Roots in Ukraine and Moldova presents a wide range of information that is both useful and interesting. The New York Times praised the book for being lavishly illustrated, voluminous encyclopedic guides that provide glimpses of life in Poland before World War II. At the New York City book launch that was held at the Consulate of Ukraine in September 1999, Dr. Ruslan Pyrih, director of the Main Archival Administration of Ukraine, stressed the importance of the book not just from a genealogical perspective, but from a historical perspective.

Since it feeds until late in the autumn, affected trees are weakened and often die in the subsequent winter. The species is found all across Europe, with outliers elsewhere. It affects the Scots pine, mountain pine, eastern white pine, radiata, Lodgepole pine and black pine. Scots pines are not generally killed by a single defoliation, but weakened trees may suffer increased attack by bark beetles, buprestid beetles, and pine weevils, which can kill trees, as can repeated defoliation.

In recent years, there has been an influx of tourists to its river. Etymology Bichnakandi is made up of two words in the Bengali language; Bichhana (or Bisna in Sylheti) meaning bed and kandi meaning a dam or cluster. The abundance of stones piled on top of each other like a bed gives this name. Geology Bichnakandi is a quarry spot that is used to collect rocks from the riverbed. It is the place where many layers of the Khasi mountains from both sides meet at one point. Fountains from the Khasi Hills make a lake that is connected to Piyain River. The rocks are also natural and come down with water streams from the mountains. It is one of the most visited tourist spots in Bangladesh. This place is alongside Bangladesh-India border and has two tectonic plates on the verge of colliding. Geologist also have proved that these kinds of places in Earth have a high rate of earthquakes.

Language Mulluk- Mulluk is classified as an independent member of the northern Daly languages, and is considered a language isolate. By 2002 it was estimated to have less than 10 speakers. Ecology The Mulluk-Mulluk lived traditionally on the northern side of the Daly River. Social system Stanner studied two particular institutions: the merbok system of intertribal exchange and the kue, a ceremonial gift exchange which had both a legal and religious function in the local system of marriage. Exchange among aboriginal groups was widely thought to be a mere matter of elementary barter. Stanner argued, instead, that it could involve quite complex systems, and he likened the merbok system he uncovered to the Kula system of exchange described by Bronisław Malinowski among the Trobriand Islands and later found to be widespread in areas of Papua New Guinea, such as Milne Bay Province. In essence merbok, the word denoting both the act and the object exchanged, required 3 individuals, within a tribe or with one from an outside group, in which a material article (ninymer), never food, was given to one person, retained by them for a time, and then passed onto the third. The objects exchanged seem to have followed a particular direction, with a trade circuit from north to south involving the Warrai Kungarakan, Djerait, Wogait, Ponga Ponga, Mulluk Mulluk, Madngella, Yunggor, Maranunggo, Marithiel, Marimanindji, Nangiomeri, Wagaman, Nangimeri, Kamor, Moiil, Nangor, Nordaniman, Kadjerawang and Jaminjang. History By the time W. E. H. Stanner managed to interview them, the Mulluk-Mulluk tribe had lost contact with many of its traditions, after suffering the brunt of half a century of contact and dispossession from the incursion of white settlement. They were almost decimated in the wake of the killing of 4 settlers in 1884 by members of the Wulwulam tribe, as the Darwinian hinterlands were explored and occupied by traders, miners and settlers, from Macassan trepangers scouring the coasts for beche-de-mer, and Chinese hardscrabble farmers to European pastoralists, causing dispersal, deracination and decimation of numerous distinct tribes, the remnants of which tended to gather about stations or missions for hand-outs. A Jesuit mission established on the Daly in the Mulluk-Mullak heartland in 1886 noticed the influx from all quarters, and on closing three years later, relocated to Hermit Hill, 20 miles inland, westwards.

Context  The related process of symbiogenesis or endosymbiosis was proposed by Lynn Margulis in 1967. She argued that the internal symbiosis of bacteria-like organisms had formed organelles like chloroplasts and mitochondria. She proposed that this had created the eukaryotes, and thus driven the expansion of life on Earth. She had argued that this process of symbiotic collaboration had run alongside the classical Darwinian cycle of mutation, natural selection and adaptation.  Genetic symbiosis from parasites  Roberto Cazzolla Gatti, Ph.D., associate professor at Tomsk State University (Russia), argued in his hypothesis that \\"the main likely cause of the evolution of sexual reproduction, the parasitism, also represents the origin of biodiversity\\". In other terms, this theory suggests that sexual reproduction acts as a conservative system against the inclusion of new genetic variations into cells' DNA (supported by the DNA repair systems) and, instead, the evolution of species can take place only when this preservative system fails to contrast the inclusion, within the host genome, of hexogen parts of DNA (and RNA) coming from obliged \\"parasitic\\" elements (viruses and phages) that establish a symbiosis with their hosts. \\"As two parallel evolutionary lines – Cazzolla Gatti wrote in his original paper – sexual reproduction seems to preserve what the endogenosymbiosis moves to diversify. Following the former process, the species can adapt slowly and indefinitely to the external factors, adjusting themselves, but not 'creating' novelty. The latter process, instead, leads to the speciation due to sudden changes in genes sequences. Not only organelles can be symbiotic with other cells, as suggested Lynn Margulis, but entire pieces of genetic material coming from symbiotic parasites, can be included in the host DNA, changing the gene expression and addressing the speciation process\\". This idea challenges the canonical natural selection models based on the gradualism of the mutation-adaptation pattern, providing more support to the punctuated equilibrium theory proposed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge.  Evidence  Two independent studies provide support for the hypothesis. Jamie E. Henzy and Welkin E. Johnson demonstrated that the complex evolutionary history of the IFIT (Interferon Induced proteins with Tetratricopeptide repeats) family of antiviral genes has been shaped by continuous interactions between mammalian hosts and their many viruses.Henzy, J. E., & Johnson, W. E. 2016. Phylogenetic sleuthing reveals pair of paralogous genes. eLife, 5, e17224 David Enard and colleagues estimated that viruses have driven close to 30% of all adaptive amino acid changes in the part of the human proteome conserved within mammals. Their results suggest that viruses are one of the most dominant drivers of evolutionary change across mammalian and human proteomes.Enard, D., Cai, L., Gwennap, C., & Petrov, D. A. 2016. Viruses are a dominant driver of protein adaptation in mammals. eLife, 5, e12469 Previously, it was estimated that about 7–8% percent of the entire human genome carry about 100,000 pieces of DNA that came from endogenous retroviruses. This may be an underestimate. In 2016 the biologists Sarah R. Bordestein and Seth R. Bordestein reported that genes are frequently transferred between hosts and parasites. Eukaryotic genes are often co-opted by viruses and bacterial genes are commonly found in bacteriophages. The presence of bacteriophages in symbiotic bacteria that obligately reside in eukaryotes may promote eukaryotic DNA transfers to bacteriophages.Sarah R. Bordenstein & Seth R.

It has rough, fibrous bark on the trunk and branches, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three or seven, white or creamy white flowers and cup-shaped to bell-shaped fruit. Description Angophora robur is a tree that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has rough, fibrous, greyish bark on the trunk and branches, Young plants and coppice regrowth have sessile leaves that are lance-shaped to oblong, long and wide with a stem-clasping base and arranged in opposite pairs. Adult leaves are also arranged in opposite pairs, lance-shaped to egg-shaped or oblong, paler on the lower surface, long, wide and sessile. The flower buds are arranged on the ends of branchlets on a branched peduncle long, each branch of the peduncle with three or seven buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are globe-shaped, long and long with a ribbed floral cup and white or creamy white petals with a green keel. Flowering has been observed in December and the fruit is a cup-shaped to bell- shaped capsule long, wide and longitudinally ribbed with the valves enclosed in the fruit. Taxonomy and naming Angophora robur was first formally described in 1990 by Lawrie Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea from specimens they collected near Kremnos Creek on the Glenreagh - Grafton Road in 1984. Distribution and habitat Sandstone rough-barked apple has a limited distribution near the coast of northern New South Wales along a sandstone belt running from near Glenreagh, north-west of Coffs Harbour to Coaldale north- west of Grafton. It grows in woodland on shallow sandstone soils. Conservation status This eucalypt is listed as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and the New South Wales Government Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995.

During intermission at a Wednesday evening performance, Sondheim showed up with 'No One Is Alone.' He played it for the cast after the show that night, and it was part of the score by Friday. The next day Sondheim and Lapine left for New York.\\" There was initially an issue over whether the song had been inspired by a preexisting poem. James Lapine explained to LA Weekly that he killed the Baker's Wife in Act II because in real life tragedies happen to human beings, and quoting \\"No One Is Alone,\\" \\"Sometimes people leave you halfway through the woods\\". Stephen Sondheim liked the duality of the title, which trumped the alternate title of \\"No Man Is An Island\\". In 1994, lyrics from the song was emblazoned on a signed charity t-shirt for the Minnesota AIDS Project. Rob Marshall recounted a story where he heard President Barack Obama quote the song during a speech at the 10th anniversary of 9/11, which inspired him to direct the film version of the stage musical. Half of the number was cut for the film. Context In the musical, this song is sung during Act II, as the four remaining leads (Baker, Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack) try to understand the consequences of their wishes, and begin to decide to place community wishes over their own. The song serves a dual purpose to demonstrate that even when life throws its greatest challenges, you do not have to face them alone and there are still people who love you, and secondly that each of your actions are not made in a bubble and that you are not guaranteed to be the protagonist of your own story. Critical reception and analysis In 1987, Frank Rich of The New York Times described the song as \\"cathartic\\" and \\"beautiful\\", and thought the song's \\"terrifying opening admonition\\" of mother cannot guide you as a callback to the frantic rant in the Gypsy number \\"Rose's Turn\\".https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/07/19/specials/sondheim-woods.html In 2014, the publication's Stephen Holden suggested that the song was a \\" double- edged lullaby\\" due to \\"acknowledg[ing] that everyone is ultimately alone\\" while asserting that the \\"shared understanding of that isolation makes life bearable\\". The LA Times thought the song was \\"remarkable\\". While claiming that the song has the potential to come across as \\"unearned sentimentality\\", Vanity thought the crew of the original stage version managed to turn the song into an \\"affirmation of the newfound society of sorts that represents a clearing in the woods\\". New York Magazine thought the song was the closest to being a self-contained tune, as opposed to the others which come across as musical \\"foreplay\\". The Cambridge Companion to the Musical suggests the song is a \\"benevolent anthem to outsiders\\". The LA Times also commented on the switch from \\"individually sought wish-fulfillment\\" to \\"togetherness\\" that becomes realised in this song. Chris Bay described the song as a \\"magnificent double duet\\" in his essay A Look Behind Into the Woods. In Don Whittaker and Missy Wigley's essay Once Upon a Time to...Happily Ever After, cited the song's universal theme that permeates throughout Sondheim's work, from Bobby in Company to George in Sunday In The Park With George to Fosca in Passion. Into The Woods cinematographer Dion Beebe asserted that the song accurately sums up the struggles and challenges of life: \\"you will lose people in the Woods as you go and your expectations will change as you experience the joys and sadness of life.\\" The book You Could Drive a Person Crazy: Chronicle of an American Theatre Company stated that the second meaning of the reassuring and positive song, which is a warning and caution for how one's actions affect others, \\"raises this show out of the ordinary\\". The book Sondheim and Lloyd- Webber: The New Musical and New York Magazine both suggest the song has an aural resemblance to The Candy Man. The song has the form of AABA. The song is frequently compared with You'll Never Walk Alone from Carousel, which You've Got to Have a Dream: The Message of the Musical rejects. In analysing how the second act relies on a sense of accumulated community wisdom, Reading Stephen Sondheim: A Collection of Critical Essays draws ties between this song and an earlier number called It Takes Two, which was originally included as a reprise in the Act II finale in the pre-Broadway tryouts. Bustle ranked the song at #2 in a ranked list of songs from the film version. The book Walking in the Wonder: A Memoir of Gratitude for a Lifetime of Miracles' states the number is the \\"hit song\\" of the show.  Covers  The song was covered in the Glee episode \\"Bash\\", in which Kurt's friends rally around him after he is the victim of a gay bashing. Jazz artist Cleo Laine recorded a version of the song for her album Cleo Laine Sings Sondheim, which secured Jonathan Tunick the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)/Best Background Arrangement. The film version of the song was nominated for an OFTA Film Award for Best Music, Adapted Song, along with two other numbers from the production. Judy Collins recorded a cover of the song on her album \\"A Love Letter to Sondheim\\" in 2017. The American jazz composer Fred Hersch composed a piece \\"No One Is Alone\\" for Liaisons: Re-Imagining Sondheim from the Piano inspired by the Sondheim song. The song was performed by Mandy Patinkin as Satan in the Touched By An Angel episode \\"Netherlands\\" when he tempts Monica to climb to the top of a cliff and jump off.

Today Meiser's political stance between 1933 and 1945 is intensely studied and debated within the parameters of Germany's Culture of Remembrance. In his unsuccessful attempt to maintain his 'landeskirche' and its independence he decided to make several compromises with the Nazi state. His attitude towards Judaism is also controversial in light of studies of the Shoah. Theologically, Meiser was in the tradition of Wilhelm Loehe, supporting a single church with a single clear Lutheran confessional identity. Unlike other Bavarian theology professors such as Werner Elert, Paul Althaus and Hermann Sasse, Meiser explicitly recognized the Barmen Theological Declaration and engaged with the links it brought to Unitarians and the Reformed Church. His confessional orientation aligned him with Theophil Wurm and divided him from Martin Niemöller. Life =Childhood, School and University (1881-1904) = =Parish vicar (1904-1922) = =Seminar Director and Church Elder (1922-1933) = =Bishop (1933-1945) = In 1933, Hitler sought to centralize his control over Germany’s Protestant Churches by establishing a ‘Reich Church’ which would put all 28 protestant bishops under the authority of one Reich bishop, answerable to Hitler. Despite the agreement to this plan by the vast majority of Protestant bishops, Bishop Hans Meiser of the Bavarian Diocese, together with Theophil Wurm, a Bishop of the neighboring diocese, refused. Their objection was not due to theological reasons, but was instead an insistence that their churches maintain their traditional independence. Meiser and Wurm did not protest the Nazi regime or Hitler. Following their refusals, Meiser and Wurm mobilized their congregations in opposition to the Reich Church. Through speaking Meiser was able to produce popular opinion throughout Protestant Bavaria that the regional Nazis could not overturn. For example, “some six thousand gathered in support of Meiser while only a few dutifully showed up at a meeting of the region’s party leader, Julius Streicher.” This mobilization and the information given to church members increased numbers in protests and protest services. The regional paper accused Bishop Meiser of treason in prominent headlines. In October 1934, Hitler’s Reich Bishop (Reichsbischof) Ludwig Müller placed Bishops Meiser and Wurm under house arrest, declared that they were no longer Church officials, and named successors to be bishops in their place. In the two weeks following Meiser’s arrest, mass public protest spread into “one of the largest” protests in the Third Reich. After the Bishops were under house arrest for two weeks, Hitler backed down, released Meiser and Wurm, and restored them as Bishops of their dioceses. In addition, Reich Bishop Müller was removed. These dramatic events illustrated how this protest movement tested the regime and its limits. Compared to brutal backlashes of the regime like the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler chose to appease the Protestant protesters even though, in effect, his hopes for a Reich Church were now negated. =Postwar (1945-1955) = =Retirement (1955-1956) = Meiser and Nazi Germany =Attitudes towards German Jews and Judaism= =Other positions towards German Jews= =Meiser and the Jewish community after 1945 = Meiser and the Church =The Evangelical Church= =Tensions between the Lutherrat and Bruderrat= =Balancing secret protests= Meiser during denazification Honours Works =As author= =As editor= =Catalogue references= References  Further reading  *Baranowski, Shelley. \\"Consent and Dissent: The Confessing Church and Conservative Opposition to National Socialism,\\" The Journal of Modern History 59, no. 1 (Mar., 1987): 53-78. *Barnett, Victoria, (1992).

First of all a liberal nurse (an experience which she described in her narrative Des gens du monde), she was a playwright and literary advisor for the Éditions Gallimard. Her novels intertwine intimate and family history and political history. The memory of the Second World War, the Indochina War, the Algerian War, the colonial tragedies and those of the totalitarian world haunts her characters on which she looks with empathy and tender irony. All her work is marked by a profound criticism of bourgeois hypocrisy, arbitrary power and obtuse conformity. She excels at reproducing oral speech, while deepening the subtleties of inner reflections, intrigues with acute psychological tensions, and creating a poetic and lyrical climate that remind of Virginia Woolf and some Russian writers. Music, painting, and artistic creation in general played a decisive role here. Her second husband was the Germanic philosopher .

He is known as one of the most prolific cartographers in Switzerland and one of the best interpreters of mountain landscapes and geologic forms. Leuzinger was also the first to produce terrain maps in color lithography. His more than 300 maps are a rare combination of accuracy, scientific thoroughness and artistry and earned him several national and international honors. Article \\"Leuzinger, Rudolf\\" Viktor Hantzsch in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, herausgegeben von der Historischen Kommission bei der Bayerischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Band 51 (1906), pp 678-680.; digital text edition to Wikisource (version of October 5, 2016, 13:43 UTC) Life Rudolf Leuzinger was the son of master carpenter Jacob Leuzinger and Barbara Weber. As a young orphan, he grew up in the ‘Linthkolonie’, an educational institution for poor children and orphans near Ziegelbrücke, Canton of Glarus. In 1851 he married Barbara Trumpi and in 1859 he married her sister Rosina Trumpi. Leuzinger died at the age of 69 from heart failure.Leuzinger, Rudolf Historisches Lexicon der Schweiz 17/01/2008 Work In 1844 after a brief apprenticeship with a stonemason in Wädenswil, Leuzinger started as an apprentice at the lithographic section of the geographic institute Wurster & Comp. in Winterthur which at the time was led by the cartographer Jacob Melchior Ziegler. After completing his apprenticeship, he worked for several years as a cartographer on the topographical maps of the Canton of St. Gallen and Canton of Appenzell (16 sheets, 1849-1851), the Atlas of all Continents (1851), the hypsometric Atlas (1856) and the topographic map of the island of Madeira (1856). Own work from that period concerns maps of the Canton of St. Gallen, Canton of Ticino, Canton of Graubünden, Canton of Glarus and Canton of Freiburg as well as a map of the island of Sumbawa. After 15 years at Wurster's, Leuzinger founded his own cartographic and lithographic institute in the city of Glarus in 1859. It soon became known for its scientifically and technically valuable productions, including map engraving. It so happened that in 1860 Leuzinger was commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III to produce some maps for his \\"Histoire de Jules César\\" in Paris. In 1861 he accepted the invitation of the Berne cantonal government to come work for the cantonal forestry and construction directorate (kantonal Forst- und Baudirektion) in Bern. Here he produced several school maps, tourist maps and maps as attachments to a number of scientific works. Fragment of map 263 \\"Glarus\\", Topographic Atlas of Switzerland - aka Siegfried Map - 1st edition 1879, lithography by Rudolf Leuzinger A new work field presented itself in 1863 as the newly established Swiss Alpine Club decided to issue yearbooks including maps. Many of these tour maps were engraved by Leuzinger and hence almost all volumes contained work by his hand. Because the tour maps were often based on the original geodesic recording by the Federal Topographical Bureau (Eidgenössisches Topographisches Bureau), Leuzinger developed a close relationship with this organisation, in particular with Colonel Hermann Siegfried. When in 1868 the Federal Parliament (Bundesversammlung) decided to issue a new Topographic Atlas of Switzerland, Siegfried commissioned Leuzinger to do the difficult engravings of the mountains – based on the original maps of Dufour and Siegfried himself. Leuzinger then made no less than 117 monochrome engravings for which he was lauded both in Switzerland and abroad. He also made many other maps, partly in copper engraving, partly in chromolithography, highlights being some maps of Switzerland, maps of the Canton of Neuchâtel Canton of Bern and Canton of Aargau, special maps of Central Switzerland, Bernese Oberland, Grindelwald area and the mountain Rigi as well as a large map of France. As off 1881 he continued his work from Mollis in his native Canton of Glarus. This period includes his terrain maps of Switzerland, South- Bavaria, Tyrol and Salzburg and Palestine, a travel map of Northern Italy, a railway map of Europe in 6 sheets, numerous small maps for Baedeker's and Meyer's travel guides and the terrain indications for Imfeld's famous Mont Blanc-map.  Trivia  Through marriage of his daughter Rosina Susanna in 1876, Leuzinger became the father in law of Eduard Rubin, Swiss Colonel and the inventor of the full metal jacket bullet and military Schmidt-Rubin rifles.

For detailed information of the history of Tibetan regime, see Tibetan regime. The history of the relationship between Tang, Song and Tibetan regime is a diplomatic history between central China and Tibetan regime.  Tang Dynasty  Although some materials show that Tibet has long been established as a political entity, no concrete historical evidence has recorded the situation before the end of the sixth century. In the late period of sixth century A.D, the leader of a tribe called Yalongxibuye in Shannan Prefecture of Tibet, Namri Songtsen, started to launch a unification war and then conquered a tribe named Supi. Thereafter Songzain Gambo, the son of Namri Songtsen established capital in Luoxie after defeating the tribe of Yangtong, Bailan, Dangxiang and Fuguo successively, building a strong Tibet kingdom then, which made him be regarded as the first person who has successfully united Tibet. Tang dynasty, at that time, was also in its prime. In the year of 630 A.D, Li Shi-min, the second emperor of Tang, was called respectfully as Heavenly king by leaders from western areas of China. Since then, Tang and Tibet started an unavoidable relationship in economy, politics and other areas. Envoys sent by Songzain Gambo came to central China to pursue a friendly relationship with Tang in the 8th year of Zhenguan (the reign title of Li Shi-min), i.e. 634A.D, bringing back officials of Tang entering and settling down in Tibet. In 636A.D, Songzan Gambo invaded Tuyuhun, a vassal country of Tang, in an excuse of attributing the decline of political marriage proposal by Tang to Tuyuhun. Tang entitled Hou Jun-ji, the minister of official personnel affair department, to the Chief Administer of Dangmi Vennue; Zhi shi Si-li, the Leading General of the Right, to the Chief Administer of Bailan Vennue; Niu Jin-da, the military defense general of left, to the Chief Administer of Kuoshui Venue; Liu Jian, the Leading General of the Left, the Chief of Taohe Vennue, to lead the army of Tang to defend Tuyuhan. Songzan Gambo was frightened after being defeated by the spearhead of Tang led by Niu Jin-da and therefore withdrew his army from Tuyuhun, Dang Xiang and Baiyuqiang before the arrival of the principal force led by Hou, sending envoys to Tang to apologize for the attack . = The First political marriage between Tang and Tibet = Songzan Gambo then decided to change the marriage proposal into a peaceful one after seeing the prosperity of Tang and it is recorded that Songzan sent his chancellor, Lv Dong, to Tang with five thousand golds and hundreds of antique treasures to show his sincerity. Two years later, after receiving the third political marriage proposal made by the Geer Dongzanyusong, an envoy sent by Songzan Gambo, the emperor of Tang selected a daughter from royal nobility, crowned her as Princess Wen-cheng, to be the wife of Songzan Gambo. What's more, the emperor of Tang appointed Li Dao-zong, the Minister of Rites and the Highness of Jiangxia, to convoy the Princess with a tally symbolized the power of the Tang emperor to Tibet. Princess Wen- cheng entered into Tibet in 641 A.D, and brought various techniques in production of central China, including 60 books on manufacturing and constructing skills, over 100 prescriptions that could curing up to 404 illness,5 methods of medical diagnosis, 6 medical devices and 4 medical weighty tomes, along with a myriad of living items and crop seeds, to Tibet region. According to the classics of The New Book of the Tang Dynasty, Songzan Gambo welcomed his bride in Baihai and Princess Wen-cheng lived in Tibet for nearly 40 years until she passed away in 680 A.D. This is the first formal contact established between Tang and Tibet. Tang and Tibet regime maintained a peaceful and friendly relationship when Songzain Gambo was alive and the diplomatic communication increased gradually every year, making Tibet region a transportation hub between Tang and Sindhu(now India) at that time. In the year of 645 A.D, emperor Li Shi-min returned to Chang-an, the capital of Tang, after conquering Koguryo and Songzan Gambo immediately sent envoy, Garl Donzawickson, to Chang-an to congratulate on Li's triumph with a gift of seven-feet-tall gold goose. Three years after, Wang Xuan-ce, the Tang envoy who visiting Sindhu, was looted there as Sindhu was in military disorder then and escaped to Tibet where Songzain Gambo dispatched armies and recruited soldiers from Nepal to assist Wang to suppress the conflicts in Sindhu, safely bringing back the whole diplomatic mission along with hundreds of prisoners of war to Chang-an. The cliff stone tablet of Tang envoy visiting Sindhu is still kept in the Gilong town of Tibet, recording Wang's revisit to Sindhu bypassing Tibet in the third year of Xianqing (658A.D), the reign title of emperor Gaozong. Songzan Gambo Emperor Li Shi-min passed away in the year of 649 A.D whose throne was then acceded by his son, Li Zhi, namely Emperor Gaozong. Li Zhi sent an envoy to Tibet to inform the obituary of his father and offer an honorary title of Groom martial supervisor and Highness of Xihai to Songzan Gambo while Gambo also in return sent a special representative to Chang-an to attend the funeral of Li Shi-min with a tribute of 15 gold, silver and jewelry, as well as congratulating and expressing his support for Li Zhi. Zhang Sun Wu-ji, the civil and administrative official, also received a diplomatic statement from Gambo saying that Tibet would not hesitate to send armies to help if there are any unfaithful officials in Tang who dare to threaten the authority of the emperor. Thereafter Li Zhi progressed Songzan Gambo's title into ‘the king of Cong’ and put a stone statue of Songzan Gambo before Zhao mausoleum, the mausoleum of Li Shi-min. Manglunmangzan, the grandson of Songzan Gambo, took over his grandfather's crown in 650 A.D after Songzan Gambo died. However, the actual executive power was in the hand of Geer Dongzanyusong who continued to adopt Songzan Gambo's political policy of improving and revising the law, checking the family registration and implementing tax policy to ensure the inner stability of Tibet. He also availed himself of the inner turmoil in Tuyuhun, attacking it for several times even at the risk of conflicting with Tang who has supported Tuyuhun for a long time. After the death of Geer, his son(someone said his grandson), Lun Qing-lin, took over the control of Tibet. In order to support Tuyuhun, Tang convoyed the king of Tuyuhun, Murong nuohebo, back to his country in 670 A.D, with an army of over 100 thousand soldiers, but encountered a Tibetan army of over 200 thousand soldiers deployed by Lun Qing-lin, and was defeated in the battle of Dafeichuan. From then on, Tibet has strengthened its control over the west region of Qinghai Lake but thereafter lost in a warfare fighting with Tang for the east region of Qinghai Lake and 4 towns in Anxi. The posthumous Sons of Manglunmangzan, Dusongmangbojie, became the king of Tibet after his father's death in 676 A.D but the political power was still in the hand of Lun Qing-lin then. As Dusongmangbojie grew up, from 695 A.D to 698 A.D, Lun's family was denounced guilty and crusaded against for threatening the power and authority of the king, as well as conflicting with other noble families. Lun Qing-lin finally suicided in Zongke, Qinghai province after a war rout. Zan Po, the brother of Lun, and his son Mang Bu-zhi surrendered to Tang after the military defeat and were separately entitled to ‘Assisting general and Highness of GuiDe’ and ‘Marquis of Anguo’. Mang Bu-zhi progressed to Highness of Ba Chuan for outstanding contribution in wars and his descendants all stayed in Tang to be Tang's officials. = The Second political marriage between Tang and Tibet = The kingship of Tibet kingdom, therefore, was strengthened. However, shortly after he eliminated the threat of Geer family, Dusongmangbojie died during a war vanquishing a region called ‘Nanzhao’, and his one-year-old son, Me agtsom, succeeded to become the new king of Tibet under the help and supervision of his grandmother, Chi Ma-tou. With hope for peace and friendship as both Tang and Tibet at that time suffered the painful results of years’ war, Chi Ma-tou sought for political marriage with Tang again for Me agtsom as she had once done such for her son. Emperor Zhongzong agreed the marriage proposal by Tibet and sent Princess Jin-cheng along with a special gift of part of the Yellow River region(the region that above Gui-de whose name was Tangmu town and this region later was taken back by Wang Zhong- si and Ge Shu-han in a later war that defeating Tibet) to enter into Tibet in 710 A.D. The emperor himself leads a group of Tang officials saw Princess Jin- cheng off with a solemn farewell ceremony in Shiping town. In 731 A.D, Me agtsom and Princess Jin-cheng dispatched an envoy to Tang to ask for ancient Chinese classics of Mao's Explanation on the Book of Songs, Books of Rites, and Spring and Autumn Annals, as well as seeking for open market and boundary division, with a statement from Me agtsom saying that Tang and Tibet are of the same family as he was the remote nephew of the former emperor and now the husband of Princess Jin-cheng, therefore, people of the two countries should enjoy a peaceful and joyful life. Tang and Tibet then established a monument in Chiling(now ‘sun and moon mountain’ in Qinghai province) to set the boundary between the two country. Frontier generals and officials from two countries attended the open market set in Chiling and Gan Song-ling and official announcement that prohibiting robbery and attack, as well as maintaining a friendly relationship was released. However, wars still broke out shortly after as both Tang and Tibet wanted to expand their territory and power, as well as frontier generals wanted to grab for more fame and military exploits. Military officers such as Li Wei, Zhang Shou-gui, Wang Zhong-si, Ge Shu-han defeated Tibet in the region from east to west successively, making Tibet sue for peace for several times. In 754 A.D, the prime minister in Tibet, Modongzebu and Langgese, rebelled and killed their king Me agtsom. In 755 A.D, a 13-year-old new king, Thrisong Deutsen, took over the reign. At the same year, the cataclysmic ‘An Shi Rebellion’ broke out in Tang. Emperor Xuanzong fled from Chang-an to Sichuan and the deployment of Tang's army to suppress the rebellion gave Tibet the opportunity to occupy the Tang's territory of Longyou, Hexi and four towns in Anxi. In October of 763 A.D, availing themselves of the opportunity that there was a discord among the emperor and officials in Tang, in addition to that Shuofang army turned a blind eye on their aggression towards the east, Tibet occupied the Chang-an city with an army of 200 thousand soldiers, making emperor Daizong escape to Shanzhou, and selected Li Cheng-hong, brother of Princess Jin-cheng, to be the new emperor. Tibetan army withdrew after occupying Chang-an for 15 days on hearing that Tang's army of loyalty was marching toward the city. The Tibet kingdom expanded its territory to a great extent in the reign of Thrisong Deutsen. At that time, Tibet bordered itself in east by Long Mountain with Tang (the Tibetan army even occupied to Baoji once, threatening the safety of Chang-an), in north by Helan Mountain that connecting Huiqi, conquering Nanzhao in east-south to be its tributary. In 790 A.D, Tibet occupied the four towns in Anxi and Beiting in the west direction and stretched its northern territory to the north coast of Ganges River in India as historic Tibetan classics recorded. = The Meeting Tablet of Tang and Tibet = Historical materials show that Tang and Tibet officially meet for 8 times during 705 A.D to 822 A.D, and the tablet of the eighth meeting is still stand before the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. The eighth meeting was also called \\"Changqing meeting\\" as it took place in the first and second year of Changqing (821 A.D to 822 A.D), the reign year of Tang emperor Muzong and the content on tablet is shown as following: According to incomplete statistics, there had been up to 191 mutual communications between Tang and Tibet from the fourth year of Zhenguan (630 A.D), the reign name of emperor Taizong, to 842 A.D, including Tang's officials' entering into Tibet for 66 times and their counterparts entering into Tang for 125 times. Tibet kingdom was also haunted by the religious fight between the local religion, Bon, and the newcomer, Buddhism. In 841, Thrisong Deutsen was assassinated by an official who opposing Buddhism and then his brother, Lang Darma who belonged to the anti-Buddhism group, succeeded to be the king of Tibet. In 843 A.D, Lang Darma enacted a law banning Buddhism and then carried out a series actions like killing the heads of the Buddhists, closing the Buddhist temples, forcing the remaining Buddhists to secularize and destroying hundreds of thousands of Buddha statue and Buddhist classic scriptures, which was called the \\"Lang Darma destroying the Buddhism\\" event in history. In 846 A.D, Lang Darma was shot dead by a Buddhist monk called Lalongbeijiyundan and 4 years later Zhang Yi-chao from Tang dispelled Tibet in Gansu province, making Hexi and Longyou region under the control of Tang again. After the death of Lang Darma, inner scrambles between the two sons of Lang Darma and melees between military officials broke out now and then. Such anarchic situation which lasts for 20 years has finally triggered the rebellious war launched by the citizens in Tibet in 869 A.D.In 877 A.D the insurrectionist army excavated and damaged the imperial mausoleum, killing the royal family and the aristocracies, bringing an end to the unified situation in Tibet region that has lasted for 200 years. Thereafter Tibet's region splits in different tribes and parts while the similar situation happened in Tang at that time. Tang dynasty ends up in 907 A.D, from then on central China enter into the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period and finally regained unification in Song dynasty.  Song dynasty  The earlier Song dynasty establishes in 960 A.D. Although the military power of this new empire is not so strong as that of Tang and it rarely contact with Tibetan tribes of Ü-Tsang that dwell far away from Han nationality, it does keep in touch with Tibetan tribes living in Gansu, Qinghai and Yunnan province where Han people also domicile. Not long after the establishment of the earlier Song dynasty, a Tibetan tribe leader named Chio-ssi-lo set up a regime in Huangshui basin centering in Miaochuan(now Ledu)and Qingtang(now Xining) and defended the attack from the kingdom of Xixia launched by its leader, Li Yuan-hao. The Chio-ssi-lo regime is the biggest as well as the first feudal Anduo regime that led by Tibetan people at that time. The Chio-ssi-lo regime maintained a harmonious relationship with Song, sending envoys to pay tributes and asking for honorable official titles from Song. In 1032 A.D( the first year of Mingdao, the rein title of emperor Renzong of Song), emperor Renzong entitled Chio-ssi-lo to \\"Ningyuan General\\" and \\"defending militia leader in Aizhou\\", along with a generous salary. In 1041 A.D (the second year of Kangding), emperor of Song formed an alliance with Chio-ssi-lo to combat the kingdom of Xixia, as well as awarding Chio-ssi-lo another two official post, \\"inspecting and supervising officer in Chongbaoshun\\" and \\"supply commissioner for Hexi army\\". Thereafter the descendants of Chio-ssi-lo, Dong zhan, E guo-gu, Xia zheng, Long za, Xi she-luo-sa, all accepted the honorable official title given by Song. However, the relationship between Chio-ssi-lo tribe and the earlier Song dynasty was not peaceful. After Wang An-shi got into office as the prime minister of Song, he changed the policy of allying with Chio-ssi-lo to combat the kingdom of Xixia into conquering Chio-ssi-lo as a springboard for attacking Xixia. In 1072A.D, military officer of Song, Wang Shao, led an army to attack Chio-ssi-lo, occupying the Xihe region that was once under the control of Chio-ssi-lo, which forces Chio-ssi-lo to cooperate with Xixia to assault Hezhou in Song. The frontier general of Hezhou was killed in this military attack. In 1077 A.D, Song was forced to ally with Chio-ssi-lo again, progressing its king, Dongzhan, as the ‘Highness of Wuwei’. In 1096 A.D, Song availed the opportunity of inner melee burst out after the new king, Xiazheng, took over the throne in 1099 A.D, sending two generals, Wang han and Wang zhan, to assail Chio-ssi-lo, which forced Xia zheng and his successor Long za to surrender to Song sequentially. However, Song failed to control that region and had to withdraw its army in the next year, bestowing the successor Xi she- luo-sa the title of ‘supply commissioner of Xiping army’ and the ‘head of Miaochuan’. In 1103A.D, Song again defeated Xi she-luo-sa and established a puppet government there, comprising the whole territory of Chio-ssi-lo into Song in 1116 A.D.In 1134 A.D, the original territory of Chio-ssi-lo was occupied by another military power, Jin, and the last leader, Zhao Huai-en, in Chio-ssi-lo region fled to the Southern Song Dynasty (1127 A.D-1279 A.D) In addition, emperor Zhenzong of Song bestowed another Tibetan leader, Pan Luo- zhi, of Liu Gu tribe in Wuwei region the title of ‘defending minister of Jianzhou and inspecting and supervising minister for the west part of Lingzhou’ in the year of 1001 A.D( the fourth year of Xianping, the reign title of emperor Zhenzong) The Song dynasty has long been carrying out the policy of ‘farming in the frontier region to supply the army’ in the south part of Gansu Province, Hexi corridor, east part of Qinghai Province and the west-north part of Sichuan Province that were once controlled by Tibet regime since the 11th century to defend the attack from Xixia, as well as improving its self-protecting power. What's more, Song has also imported weapons like arrows and bows to Tibetan tribes living in Hexi corridor and recruit Tibetan archers into the militia system to mutually defend the assaults of Xixia. The military general, Wang Shao, greatly exploited the land in Linxia and Lintao in Gansu province, recruiting up to 300 thousand Tibetans to do the ploughing work. The renowned ‘Tea and Horse market’ was also promoted in some special markets opened by Song in regions of Yaan in Sichuan province, Linxia in Gansu province and Shanxi province, inaugurating the fixed trade of horse and tea that lasts for hundreds of years.
